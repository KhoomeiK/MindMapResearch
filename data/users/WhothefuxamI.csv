Also before you do anything really think about your reasons. Because what you wrote sound kind of contradictory. Are you doing this for her or for you? If it's for you then ok, you have the right to do what's right for you, but make sure you do it i don't know gently. And if you think you're doing this for her, then I think this is a wrong reasons, because it's not really for you to decide what's good for her. Staying in relationship just to protect her feelings is not the best but I feel like breaking up with her to 'shake her up' is also a bad idea. You think it's going to help her build self esteem and make her love herself but honestly it might go the opposite, especially  when as you said she has emotional issues"

But as for solutions I don't think there is a way other than surgery. There are some pencils or something that you can basically draw your hair but I don't think it would look good and natural.
TheGlowUp,ffc78w0,t3_esqxw3,1579793155.0,"Honestly until I read your comment I didn't see any difference between this photos. And even now I see only your forhead. You don't have wide jaw and your chin is compeletely fine. And I actually think it kinda looks better on the left photo. I think all you need is to wear your hair down, styled nicely and wear nice clothes that are right for your season/body type and you'll look really great :) maybe try some bangs?

When i hit the bottom I decided to go to a psychoterapist first time in my life, I could cry and vent to someone and it cleared my head. The therapist also gave me a lot of advice and it made me want to actually get help.

But maybe you have a close someone that you could share your feelings? And if not you can just vent here if you want. Sometimes putting what's it's boiling inside you out there is really helpful. 

You might also want to express your feelings. I don't know what exactly you go through but maybe some artherapy? Boxing? Etc.

Also take a free day. Practice some self care. Things like a nice bubble bath or watching a movie while eating ice cream sounds cliche but doing something nice for yourself can be helpful too. 

The thing I learned from this visit with psychoterapist is that I should treat myself like a small, abandoned puppy that needs love and care. Wrap myself in a blanket and lay on soft pillows. Literally and figuratively. You may want to try this too."

mentalhealth,ffbcf3q,t1_ffba9qt,1579759528.0,It's ok. I understand. I have so many issues myself and I feel overwhelmed at times. Just take one step at a time. That's how you move forward. Nobody in this world can teleport.
mentalhealth,ffb9zx5,t3_eso7j7,1579756793.0,"Ok, first of all I'm sorry that happened for you. I know you wrote you can't afford to fix this things, but they're all really fixable. So hold on to that hope. Maybe it takes more time, but it's never too late. Do what you can, one thing at a time. I'm going to go in the same order:

1. Your voice. Actually that sounds like people that told you that you have ugly voice and would avoid you because of this are really mean and childlish. It's not something we should judge a person on. But either way it's fixable by yourself. I'm on a sub about getting prettier and better and there is a term called 'voicemaxxing'. You can type it on Reddit. You can train your voice to sound better and improve your communication skills. There's a lot of resources for that. And it's basically free, all you need is internet and a recorder on your phone.

2. Your body. I don't know how bad this things are, but stretchmarks are ok, almost everybody have them. If you have a little fat that's ok too. As for loose skin this is fixable by surgery though it's expensive. But I have a feeling it's not as bad as you make it out to be. Just work on your fashion (it doesn't require a lot of money, I personally mostly shop second-hand). If you want to look even better and you are able to afford it, invest in a good shapewear. And look for body positivity resources. Look for inspirational people that are beautiful despite their imperfections. Because it's not the end of the world.

3. Your teeth. Ok, this is hard. It takes money and time to fix it. But remember, there's never too late. You will get there. 

4. Your personality/communication skills - again, there's a lot of recources online. And as for your mental health problems, aren't there any ways you could get to a doctor or a therapist for free or for little money? Maybe some fundations etc.? Look around and use whatever is possible. As for communicating and socializing maybe you can practice talking to people online if it makes it easier? 

And as for HPV, it doesn't make you dirty. Actually a lot of people are infected, just not everybody will have symptoms. And you could easily get infected by just shaking hand with someone who has it or in public transport or something. Just get checked because it might lead to other health complications.

Ok, so to finish my long rant, take care. You can try to work on some things yourself at a little cost of money, though it will require a lot of emotional cost. Look for support groups for any of your problems, I assure you, there's plenty. Other things that require money may take more time. Just be patient. You'll get there. Look around for help, maybe you find somewhere to get it treated earlier for cheaper. Your still young and have plenty of time to get better. All the best."

Anxiety,ff9hqod,t3_es98la,1579713274.0,"I keep seeing a lot of people saying how medication went wrong for them and it sounds unsettling tbh. Makes me a little scared. Sorry it happened to you too.

 I started pregabalin and sertraline about two weeks ago and side effects of sertraline already dissapeared and lasted for like 3 days but I feel like pregabalin makes me really tired and sleepy. I don't know exactly if it's this or just my depression because sertraline needs some more time to work if it will work at all, but I did notice that around the time I take the pills I literally get swamped off my feet. And I feel tired, heavy and sleepy and not motivated during the day for the most part. It makes it more difficult to keep on with what I need to do. But on the good note it does help with feeling anxious and stressed. And help me to fall asleep at night. I literally drift off the second I lay down. 

So it's really weighting pros vs cons. What I'm able to handle and sacrafice. I'll wait and see for sertraline to work and then I'll see how I'm going to feel."

'Death is so final, yet life is full of possibilities'. This along with not wanting to hurt my family and be a burden to them because funerals are expensive, is what keeps me. You can call it stupid hope but the truth is you never really know what tommorow brings. And no ones life is all bad or all good. Even when it sometimes feels like it. It's a rollercoaster of a lot of different shit. 

This is my fear, that if I kill myself, I'm going to miss on something. That maybe something would happen that could make my life better but I won't be able to expierience it.

Hang in there. Your time to die will come. Again I'm going to quote Game of Thrones because why the f*** not. 'if we die, we die. But first we live'

Also be easy on yourself. Don't take too much, focus on what's the most important and necessary. 

And do one thing at a time. I had a really though time today getting myself to do a project and I did it finally, but I'm drained and tired so for now I'm taking a break. Maybe I'll menage to do something else today, but if not I'll do it next time."

Also try to think about what exactly makes presentations so scary for you. Is it that you say something wrong? Or someone would laugh at you? Then try to think of the worst possible scenario. And try to find a way to work it out. And just know that you may be taking this way too seriously. 

You got this. Also practice makes perfect. Don't run away from doing this. First few times might be far from perfect. If you have a nice and understanding classmates and teacher you might tell them about your struggles. 

Last year I had classes about doing presentations. A lot of people already knew that we are going to to a lot of speaking in front of others. We also had this system of other giving their anonymous opinions. And you know what they were writing? Only nice things.

There was a girl in our group. She didn't have classes with our group and this teacher before and when we started to do this presentations she was also scared to the point that she skipped classes. But then one time she gave a presentation about her feelings about this and how she came to understand that there is nothing to be afraid of. It was really touching. And nobody was mean or judgemental about her. We were proud that she went out to speak up and she opened up. A lot of people also said they relate to this. But each one presentation was better. 

So be strong, take a deep breath and just try :) And if you have trouble standing ask if you can sit. If you voice trembles it's okay. Take a breath and repeat what you wanted to say. It's not a big deal really :) you got this x"

I think a  lot of my features are neither too round nor too sharp so that's it. Also when I was on higher weight I collected most fat around my waist and had more rectangular shape.

Other than that, I don't think this kind of approach, to avoid your feelings by doing something else instead of working on them is the best. My therapist was shocked when I told her I'm planning to work, especially while I'm studying, because as she said I need time to heal and taking too much responsibilities and tasks is going to be draining.

Sometimes doctors require additional tests to see if it really is a mental illness or if it has other causes. But even if you get a diagnosis and meds prescription at the first meeting it doesn't mean it will be the right one. And you usually have to go in like a month to see if the meds are working and generally check everything. 

Also a tip if you decide to go, write down everything you go through, that causes problems (your feelings, thoughts, what triggers them, how often you have them, intensity, etc).

Also I don't think it's unnatural. If you have depression you have less serotonin, if you have anxiety there's also physical things that happen inside our bodies. That's what I call 'unnatural'. It's an illness. Medication just help to keep things on a 'normal' level. That's how I see it. 

I personally started to take meds. I tried to hide, cover, or just wait out and get through the things I was expieriencing for so long and it didn't work. It came again and again and worse. If there is something that can help then I have no objections. I should also go to therapy but it's impossible now so I need to rely on meds, because I'm done with feeling bad.

But be careful, because it's also risky. There might be side effects and a lot of anxiety meds can be addicitve. 

At the end of the day it's your decision. And it's not permanent. If you decide not to take meds and then see nothing is working you can go back and get them. If you decide to take meds and you won't like them you can stop taking them.

mentalhealth,fd85nz9,t3_ek9zy9,1578214162.0,"Maybe try to talk with her about what exactly is making her feel that way, what is causing that. Maybe she was bullied or criticized constantly when she was a child? Or maybe try instead of telling her general things about how she's amazing tell her complements about certain things she does. 

But it still can be hard because you won't help her if she doesn't want to be helped. Is she diagnosed or aware of having depression? Is she undergoing treatment for that? If yes, leave it to the professional and just keep being there for her. If not you may gently suggest that you see she's hurting and it might help her to talk to someone who can help. 

Be gentle, and not pushy, don't tell her she's wrong for feeling the way she feels, just let her know it doesn't have to always be that way. 

I personally struggle with low self-esteem and have a negative view of myself, often generalizing and thinking I'm the worst in any way possible. I was reccomended by a therapist a book about self compassion. If you type that in your browser you should see a website about it by the author, might want to check it out. But this therapist also told me something. She wanted me to imagine a puppy. A small, sad puppy in the garbage can, wet from the rain, cold and starving. What would you do? She asked. Take this innocent pup, wrap in a blanket, give food and cuddle, trying to make it feel safe and comfortable. Then imagine you are this puppy. And you should treat yourself exactly the same. Because you're hurting. The truth is it doesn't even matter how amazing you seem to the outside world. Or it doesn't matter that you're not perfect, because nobody is. You make mistakes, you fail, you are sometimes not good enough. But it's okay. You still deserve love and care just because. This is very important thing to understand when building self-esteem. You may want to share this with your friend. I wish her all the best, she may be amazing or she may be not, but she deserve to love and feel good about herself, because we all do. I wish you all the best because you are an amazing and caring friend, and she's great for having you x"

I would advice you to try and outline that shape with white eye pencil, then remove all hair that are outside of the lines. I personally prefer  using eyebrow razors instead of plucking them with tweezers. Your hair seems quite long so before you may want to brush them upwards and trim alongside your outlined shape. Then just fill the sparse areas with eyebrow pencil and use tinted or clear brow gel to 'style' your eyebrows so the hair stay in the right place."
mentalhealth,fd1crf4,t3_ejtvud,1578129916.0,"If you can, seeing a mental health professionalist to go to the roots of the problem might be really helpful.

Other than that I currently started to read a book, recommended by a therapist about how to be good to yourself and the power of self-compassion. I find it quite helpful and an interesting approach to building confidence and self-esteem.  Unfortunately I can't find the original book, because I'm not english speaker and mine has a different title than what I found online, but the author has a website with a lot of informations about that. I don't know if I can post links or something or if it require mods approval, but if you search 'self-compassion' it should pop out."

MaladaptiveDreaming,fcwyj27,t3_ej2066,1578043139.0,"Yes, I'm usually not very active and easily get tired. I don't think my daydreaming is the main cause, but it might be sort of related. I think my daydreaming is a coping mechanism. I was introverted and a loner since I was a child. Also I come from kind of dysfunctional background and deal with some mental issues. I always loved to read and had vivid imagination and I tried to use it to compensate for the reality or to escape from it. Now I think it might be kind of a loop where I'm not satisfied with my life and it makes me depressed, so I turn to daydream, but this in turn only makes my real life feel emptier and makes me depressed. 
 But also I never was much of an active person, I could stay in one place for hours reading instead of some physical activity and it didn't make me any more energized. Again  a loop."

Vindicta,fcvlcqj,t3_ej2th4,1578004572.0,"I use macadamia oil as a moisturizer and it's great! It moisturizes, smoothes the skin and shrink pores. 

Coconut oil or baby oil (made with natural oils and not paraffin) are also great for removing makeup. I massage it on my face and eyes and then when everything is melted i use makeup wipes or a wet cloth.

And the tip when it comes to using oils on your hair - different oils works for different hair types, mostly depending on porosity. Coconut oil works more for low porosity hair (I tried it on my medium porosity and it was a disaster), shea butter as well, generally saturated oils. For medium porosity hair monounsaturated oils like olive oil, avocado oil, macadamia oil works best. For high porosity hair the best are polyunsaturated oils like flaxseed oil or sunflower oil."
infp,fcv2nqd,t3_ej11nd,1577993384.0,Well I mostly just get really uncomfortable and don't know what to do and how to behave. I can sometimes give them advice but emotional comfort is beyond me. I feel really unnatural doing that and as selfish as it sounds I usually prefer to be the one held and comforted. Maybe that's the problem.
Anxiety,fcu5wzj,t3_eitz5c,1577973335.0,Well I usually just take painkillers but doing it daily seems not really wise. Maybe try head or face massaging? I heard also that massaging the point between your thumb and index finger on your right hand helps but I don't know if it's true. Or if you have time or you get them in the evening there are some ASMR videos on YouTube for headache I sometimes use them.
Anxiety,fcu5cc9,t3_eiw4kl,1577972935.0,"As for pills or teas something with valerian root extract, lemonbalm or lavender etc might be helpful for mild anxiety, but it's not a long term solution and not very strong. Also I personally find isochronic tones to be helpful but only when listening to that, again not a long term solution, just a relaxation for a moment. 
The other thing I heard about are adaptogens, but I don't know much about them. They are claimed to help your body to adapt and be more resilient, some are told to increase the resilience to stress. You may want to look into that and read about them."

Anxiety,fcu3dab,t3_eivt5h,1577971363.0,"That's really interesting, also on more anecdotal note the more you try to not think a certain thought the opposite happen. That's why with things like meditation and mindfullness it's not about stopping your thinking or emotions because they appear unconsiously, but more like observing them from different perspective."
Anxiety,fcu2zvi,t3_eix2eg,1577970989.0,"Everybody gets anxious and stressed from time to time. The problem begins when this feeling is taking over, you feel it often and more intensely and it might be inadequate to the cause and you can't simply relax. If you feel like it makes you life worse and affects your daily tasks, school performance or social life etc you might suspect it's no longer within 'healthy' range. The best way to know is to talk to a mental health professional, telling them what is the problem, how much it affects you and find the best solution with them. It doesn't matter if it's really severe or just a light inconvienience everybody deserves to feel good and at peace."

I also struggle right now to push myself to write my master dissortation and there was time I seriously thought about giving up. Also doesn't help that I have no idea what to do after, i'm just so scared. 
What helps me is thinking about the positive things. About every time I did something well. When I feel like I can't do something I try to recall other times that I felt like this and remember that I went through this. And  I think about the bad things that could happen if I'd stop. Because studying is what keeps me sane, occupied. That's my almost only way to socialize. 

Have you visited a therapist or psychiatrist? Some time ago I visited a therapist when I was really low and wanted to give up on my studies and it cleared some things about why I feel the way I feel. She suggested meds and therapy and I'm going to try it in hope to get better.

I was myself quite hesistant to agree when I heard from a psychologist that I in fact struggle with depression. But as she told me it's not always laying and doing nothing for days. And when it is it can be like this because chemical imbalances that can't be corrected with a strong will alone.
It's often hard to motivate myself to do all of this. And it doesn't make things worse, but it doesn't make it better either. It's just DESPITE doing all of this I'm still depressed. I still feel loads of self hatred. I still have suicidal thoughts. It doesn't make me satisfied. And I feel overwhelmed when I think how much of this is still before me."

Maybe it can make you occupied for some time but for me personally even when I do get up, do stuff it doesn't really change anything in the long run. Life feels pointless anyway and all I want to do is just stop. Also saying things like this, that you should just get up and do something can add to feeling guilty and like a failure which in turn can make depression worse. Lack of motivation and energy is just a part being depressed. It can be way more complicated."

And the dosage should depend on what you are using, usually it should be noted on the box or something if you're using pills.

It can make you quite sleepy and heavy though."

I personally thought about hair extentions and honestly I feel like the best would be flip in or halo extentions. I can't recommend certain brands since I didn't use them myself but I saw them in Amber Scholl video and they seem like a great idea! It's like clip in but instead of clips you have a clear string that the hair is attached to.
