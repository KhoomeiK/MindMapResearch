aww,fel3rb1,t3_epli8t,1579213423.0,One does one have to do in their human life to be reincarnated as a pampered dog/cat?
cats,fehmq11,t3_ep1t4f,1579119677.0,"He's so beautiful and fluffy! We used to have a super chill cat, was the best I've ever had. Just a cuddle bunny and a lover, wanted to be on your lap or snuggled up beside your head on the back of the couch. Wasn't even into toys which I found weird. Loved that cat!"
BeAmazed,fecryhp,t3_eoak80,1578982341.0,One of these achievements is impressive but he's living 3 highly successful lives.
funny,fdrd0d3,t3_emsurj,1578682732.0,Gorilla warfare!
Seattle,fdr9hrf,t3_emlmha,1578681347.0,I'm so prepared (generator and batteries for millennia ready) this year so nothing will happen. You're welcome.
PoliticalHumor,fdr8mfm,t1_fdqo6dz,1578681050.0,"Watch God in America on PBS. I think it's a 5 part series. Enlightening since I'd never really thought (beyond my time on this planet) that religion & politics weren't always married. Fascinating to watch each president adopt their ""feigned"" religious zealotry to garner support."
LadyBoners,fdklm4d,t3_ell07p,1578506091.0,"So much love. If you've not seen The Fall, you're missing out. I've loved him in everything he's been in!"
Seattle,fdhbi1i,t3_eleegz,1578419407.0,"Considering I lose power if someone sneezes, I'm only excited about the potential for snowshoeing my way to the nearest coffee shop for warmth."
cats,fdf87ru,t3_ekym3c,1578355574.0,"Yes. ..and henceforth, you shall never poop alone."
cats,fcjefm6,t3_eh8t7j,1577684686.0,Came here to ask for the IG. Lovin' the cat doodles!
OkCupid,fc6f7uv,t3_egfbcs,1577479157.0,I feel like this kind of date lends itself to real conversation. I'd imagine your chatting about the exhibits will still allow you to get to know enough to determine if you'd like to do something afterwards or have a 2nd date. Meetups don't have to be all Q&A and just be two people hanging out enjoying an activity.
LadyBoners,fc6923v,t3_egcce4,1577475077.0,"Hmmm, Fuck!"
MurderedByWords,fc67a12,t1_fc5yr2v,1577473901.0,...or the scene from Waitress where she gives him a MoonPie because he's no longer worthy of home baked delicious pies.
LadyBoners,fc3ncyr,t1_fbw1f0i,1577393844.0,"This is where I'm headed. I'm sure I missed little subtleties, right?!"
PoliticalHumor,fbw0l0e,t3_eekoi5,1577138795.0,A narcissist that NEVER looks good. He's had that hairstyle for 50 years and it's always been horribly outdated.
travel,fbvzww7,t3_eekfck,1577138511.0,I love that park! I did a hike there in May via Glendalough. Gorgeous shot. Sadly I have no photos of it b/c I somehow changed the effects setting on my camera when it was in my pack so everything looked like a painting/cartoon. I managed a few good ones of the cemetery though.
LadyBoners,fbvyzwl,t3_eeo188,1577138137.0,I'm trying so hard not to binge this show. I want (NEED) it to last!
LadyBoners,fbvenxj,t3_eeknr0,1577129721.0,I've officially gone down a rabbit hole! Face & voice of an angel!
