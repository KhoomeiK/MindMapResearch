raisedbynarcissists,ff7rn8v,t1_ff7hfsm,1579656694.0,Interesting
LaBrantFamSnark,ff6s9gk,t3_ermau9,1579633820.0,That waste of cupcakes though.
LaBrantFamSnark,ff6s7ui,t1_ff4gadc,1579633792.0,What's an aldi Ken? I love aldi.
brakebills,ff6s2ht,t3_erxebu,1579633702.0,I wish my friends would watch it. My husband doesnt really watch it but he knows the main characters and saw how sad I was after last season ended.
Broadway,ff1q8fj,t1_fezxnb4,1579483766.0,Lol I remember watching spring awakening and seeing spit fly.
Parenting,felkmqb,t3_epj8we,1579224446.0,Would she let you plop her on the potty when you can tell she has to go? We've had to do that a few times with our 5 year old.
Parenting,felkfbi,t1_fekqjra,1579224307.0,No major life changes other than she turned 5 last month and knows she's really getting older and going to kindergarten next year.
Parenting,felk4ts,t1_fekwycq,1579224105.0,If I have to cancel on my mom I'll probably say I'm not feeling well or H hasn't been feeling well (also true.)
Parenting,feljth9,t1_fel7se8,1579223892.0,"Honestly I'd be devastated if she felt like she couldn't come to me or her dad. In the past when she's had an accident shes asked her dad not to tell me and vice versa and I stressed that she can tell us anything and asked why she wants secrets like that.

My mom likes to bring up my abuse as a cautionary tale and emphasizes how beautiful my kids are and says be careful and look what happened to you. And I'll sit there thinking well who was supposed to be my parent at the time? It's both hilarious and sad. 

She hasn't had an accident since the hallway thing this morning so that's good news so far."
Parenting,fekwuq7,t1_fekum6t,1579209257.0,Yeah ours still has regular poops and she hasn't pooped herself. She did poop her pants a few times when we brought the baby home last year though.
Parenting,fekwrqq,t1_fekfnon,1579209207.0,I love true crime but I stay home with the kids and am around them all the time.
Parenting,fekwoa5,t1_fekuae7,1579209150.0,"Yes. No constipation, they expect to have her results in by tomorrow."
Parenting,fekwk16,t1_fekbzri,1579209081.0,"They took a urine sample and won't have anything finished until tomorrow.

I doubt shes being sexually abused. I'm with her 90% of the time and had the talk with her recently. Shes a pretty vocal person so I hope she's being open with us. I was abused for most of my childhood and definitely want to avoid those patterns that allowed it to happen to me."
Parenting,fekce5e,t1_fekbpgy,1579197113.0,I just wish I knew if any of it was developmental or mental. Or is she really just sick. They did say there was some labial adhesion going on but you keep going back in your mind trying to figure out what else is going on.
Parenting,fekc81p,t1_fekbqcr,1579197012.0,"We're waiting on lab results for additional info, they said tomorrow is the longest it will take to get them back.

I think I will cancel all our engagements and just try to keep things low key. Maybe rent some movies or something and go for walks in the neighborhood. My mom is going to be annoying about it no matter what it is."
Parenting,fekb1r3,t3_ephxbk,1579196316.0,"Our 5 year old potty trained at 3 and has been peeing all over the place lately and it hurts to pee. All we have is a prescribed ointment for her.

She just peed all over the carpet a few minutes ago. I really want to yell at her and threaten to take something away but I didn't really say anything because I don't want to make things worse."
clothdiaps,feiu5y7,t3_epaihv,1579147298.0,Same. A lot of sickness here.
normalnudes,feeezck,t1_fedibqq,1579032385.0,I feel the same way when I see people the same height and weight as me on here.
breakingmom,feeevuh,t3_eoirte,1579032326.0,"I've had a few close mom friends have to move far away. It's been years and I still miss them all so much.

My first friend that moved away had to do it because of her ex. I'm happy for her that she's in a much better place now. He was an awful guy to her."
breakingmom,fdzns7x,t1_fdz1jyu,1578792153.0,"There are biodegradable diapers but it's not like they're going to decompose in a landfill anyway. And even if we could decompose them in our yards what would we do, let them pile up while they take who knows how long to break down? One number I read said 50 years."
breakingmom,fdzbc09,t3_encs9x,1578788480.0,"I try to reduce my waste but people really do try to over simplify how ""easy"" things should be for people to do. 

We do the best we can and sometimes that just means simply trying to survive. I wish we all had access to clean drinking water that is free and much better public transportation (my spouse cannot drive.) A lot of these environmental issues are on corporations and government infrastructure. As individuals, what we do only matters so much."
AmItheAsshole,fdxh00i,t3_en6jau,1578768615.0,NTA. Shes learning an important lesson that will hopefully make her a better person long term.
PublicFreakout,fdxg6t9,t1_fdw5g1i,1578768433.0,"It's more of an ""AAH!!! You scared me"" thing.

My mom screamed at us all the time when I was growing up though. Over anything. And she never ran out of steam doing it. My mother in law is similar too."
PublicFreakout,fdvm8f1,t1_fduik0h,1578748941.0,"Iirc from when my parents brought me to police for my own molestation, there is a statute of limitations.

I don't remember the exact number but I think it was something like 7 years from when incident happened. Depends on the state I think."
PublicFreakout,fdvlzg1,t1_fduqckq,1578748837.0,I literally screamed yesterday because my husband and kid came home last night while I was so wrapped up in cleaning. It's like an involuntary thing. I don't get as startled as I used to but it's still embarrassing for me. I used to be really jumpy in general.
AskReddit,fdlgeyo,t1_fdk8nbb,1578523467.0,I loved baths for a while. It really depends on how awesome the bathtub is that we're renting. The last one was huuuge.
AskReddit,fdlgbzi,t1_fdk71f8,1578523417.0,"My dad thinks it's weird that I didn't stop watching cartoons. Like, spongebob can be really funny but then my daughter was copying him all the time so we're on a hiatus. I have a new appreciation for the kid ones too since I've had kids."

AskWomen,fdf166u,t3_ekvi2h,1578350974.0,"I don't like my name which has always screamed sorority girl to me. It is about as common and has a similar vibe to the name Tiffany. I don't look like a ""Tiffany"" at all.

When I was younger I liked the name Elizabeth and liked the many possible nicknames but I'm over it now. 

My 2 girls have old style names."

entitledparents,fd6h2xt,t1_fd5qbph,1578190912.0,"Yeah that would definitely get the cops called on you where I live. My kid is 5 and I know someone would call the cops on me if I told her tomorrow to walk over to a house down the street. When I was in 3rd grade it wasn't weird for kids to walk home alone but I feel like now people would judge you so idn exactly what the ""acceptable"" age is."
entitledparents,fd5gwuk,t1_fd58tgg,1578177510.0,I feel like I don't know anyone who would think it was ok to let your 3 or 4 year old leave the house alone.

ptsd,fcwogee,t3_ej536l,1578031608.0,"I somewhat get it. My stuff happened at a very young age so sometimes I question who I really am or who I could have been.

There are times when I feel happy and not bogged down by the past. But lately that's not the case. So maybe this stuff is subconsciously bothering me again. I feel paranoid and don't trust everything. I'm not sure."

I took steps to distance myself from a toxic group of former ""friends"" which is tough because we have mutual friends. I'm not going to brag about it on social media though."

bisexualadults,fcjch65,t3_ehhl3a,1577682971.0,I didnt come out until after I married a guy. I was still questioning when we started dating. If not for that maybe I would have at least told my friends earlier.
AsianParentStories,fcjc5jv,t1_fcj0x9w,1577682701.0,When I was 13 I was moody and my mom asked if I was pregnant. I hadn't even kissed anyone yet and didnt until I was 19. I was so offended though.

bisexualadults,fc3is51,t1_fbvby1t,1577390721.0,Good for you. I feel like I don't feel close enough to my parents to do it even though some of my family knows. And I also feel silly because I'm married to a guy. Which in itself is silly since it doesn't negate anything.
bisexualadults,fc3iolw,t1_fc2iz82,1577390658.0,"Just say what I'm thinking about more openly. The other day he asked who I find attractive and the convo wasn't really bad at all. And then yesterday we ran into one of the people I mentioned lol.

Talking really helps. I also found out some of my friends are bi. I've spent a lot of time feeling like a fraud and my own worst critic and have been trying to work on that as well. 

A year into our relationship he felt insecure about some things including not feeling like enough and I think it helps that we've been together 10 years. I think sometimes he feels bad for me that we met so early in life but I am happy with him and I want him to be reassured about our relationship which is also where the open communication comes in."
breakingmom,fc1ryra,t3_efh891,1577327840.0,"I posted a similar thread on the parenting sub and the first few comments said I was coming off as spoiled or entitled. I don't complain about the gifts to people's faces but sometimes I get stressed out by the plastic crap as you put it. I also don't get a lot of electronic toys.

Granted I got my kid way too many books for today because some books were for her birthday earlier this month and I forgot to give them to her. And then the last month we have been taking home so many free books from the library so. I definitely could have planned it a little better I guess. 

I can relate to not getting everything I wanted to get her because I wanted to give other people (mostly grandparents and godparents) the chance to get her stuff off the wish list. I tried to make it a lot of open-ended toys that can be played with for years. 

She loves the art supplies I got her though and my dad's family is coming tomorrow and I just hope we don't get flooded with things. I did send my stepmom the wishlist."
bisexualadults,fc179zv,t3_eenz0u,1577310285.0,I'm not a resolutions person but I've always had a hard time talking about my attractions. H and I had a recent convo about it and I would like to talk more openly in future. I think it was a lot of repression and feeling embarrassed only to realize it's really not a big deal.
AmItheAsshole,fbz1v95,t3_ef49r2,1577232571.0,"The tapestry thing is hilarious. If she doesn't love your gift then she doesn't have to use it.

I only give picture gifts of the kids to the grandparents and my 2 aunts. Even when we end up with too many photos from school picture day, I doubt anyone else really wants them."
