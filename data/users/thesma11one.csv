raisedbynarcissists,ffoko74,t3_cnr9bq,1580078643.0,"Hello, I saw your post while looking up posts about ACA information and groups. I know your post is old, but it’s still up, so I figured I’d provide my input in case it helps you.

I’ve been going to ACA meetings since November of last year. My father was an alcoholic, and my mom is dating an alcoholic. My mom has taken on some of the toxic traits of alcoholics, even though she isn’t one herself. So I would say that ACA meetings can be applicable toward dysfunctional families as well, even if your parents don’t drink. While many members are Adult Children of Alcoholics, there are members who’s family members don’t drink. If you go through the laundry list traits on the ACA website and they apply to you, you do belong.

Some groups go through a certain set structure for each meeting. We do an opening prayer and meditation, we go around and introduce ourselves, we say something we’re grateful for, we do some readings from the ACA Big Red Book, and then we can talk about whatever struggles we’re going through. While there are prayers, they don’t have to be religion-focused prayers. There is an ACA non-religious one as well. When they reference to a “higher power,” they say it can be to a role model or family member or someone that you look up to or want to be like. I am an atheist and I haven’t felt pressured to convert to religion or anything like that. It’s just there if you need it. 

It’s not like a cult at all. Everyone is very supportive and welcoming. You can find a “sponsor” to help guide you through the 12 steps of the step work books and just be there for you in general. You can give the group leader or any other members your information if you want to have people to keep in touch with and provide a network of safety and communication. Or you can remain completely anonymous, not share anything, and keep to yourself if you want. All you have to do is say you “pass” to anything your uncomfortable with. 

The only drawback some people are surprised by at first is that you aren’t supposed to crosstalk - talking or interrupting someone while they’re sharing their struggles, or hugging or touching - because ACAs/dysfunctional children have one of the traits of caring for others before taking care of themselves. So they want to hold the meetings to help facilitate us working on and helping ourselves instead of those around us. But you can always hug or comfort group members outside of the meetings, if it’s appropriate and you get close to some people and they/you just need a hug sometimes.

I would really recommend checking out the ACA website, laundry list & traits, and try a phone/in-person meeting if you haven’t already. They say to try at least 6 before you see any improvements and decide to quit. And if there are others in the community, I’d try different ones to get a feel for different settings.I knew I fit in at 2 meetings :) I hope this helps you."
NIU,ffofcbf,t1_ffbxwi9,1580077110.0,"Luckily my boyfriend has a decent budget because he already works full-time. Plus I have a couple friends looking to rent as well, so an additional roommate could increase our budget and get us the amenities we need.

I told him he might have to deal without a garage and/or not bring his dad’s dog if we can’t find the right fit in time. We just want somewhere relatively safe to walk a dog down the street, if we do end up bringing the dog. So yeah we aren’t settling for dirt cheap. I found a place that we can tour next week though that would be perfect for us, so fingers crossed all works out!"
AdultChildren,ffjhzv9,t1_ffjgba5,1579998632.0,"That is so true, I didn’t think about how we like to keep family life hidden from others. I’ve been so open about my family life around my friends for so long that I didn’t think about how students would perceive going to a group with other students. 

Thank you, this has been really insightful. I’ll wait for more input, but I might be leaning more toward off-campus now!"
college,ffaysuz,t1_ffaq6hx,1579747634.0,"I'm a junior transfer student at a university of about 15k-20k students. Before that I did 75% of two associate's degrees online for 5 years. I was super isolated and depressed before, but I kept using the phrase ""fake it until you make it"" at my new school, and it has helped a ton. 

It helped to change my mindset that I might always feel awkward sometimes, but they feel awkward too. Everyone feels awkward. But I kept telling myself that university is a once in a lifetime opportunity and I am spending so much money, that I should take advantage of all the new connections and friends I could miss out on. 

It really is a hit or miss if you connect with people. But you won't know until you start talking to others. And you never know if a conversation in class, in the dining halls, or around campus could lead to an acquaintance, someone who can tell or teach you something, or even a friend or romantic partner. So I try and find some value out of making new friends, and if I'm too nervous and shy that day, I tell myself to ""fake it until I make it,"" and pretty soon I was just having standard/happy days with a good amount of social interaction with people I saw every day and friends that reached out *to me*."
NIU,ffaxqqh,t1_ffanwhi,1579746937.0,"Thanks for the comment! I'm just wondering where you tried to apply to last year that it was hard to find anything. Were you looking for student housing, a room to rent, or your own place? 

A realtor I spoke to today claims there are plenty of rentals in the Spring, not sure if that's accurate. I'm honestly willing to put the work into calling online listings since my boyfriend and I need cetain amenities and we don't want to settle for something cheap and poorly managed. I've also done my research into the rental agencies around here, and I wouldn't trust most of them. The consensus on most of the reviews are less than positive."
NIU,ff94nwd,t1_ff8rewe,1579704751.0,"I applied to several last night and this morning, and some rental agencies are already saying to apply closer to April. I guess I'll have to wait until then to apply for houses and condos."
relationship_advice,ff8m1x4,t3_es9iu4,1579685198.0,"Yes, if it's causing you to have any doubts, it's a valid enough reason to bring it up and ask what's going on between them. I would be a little concerned if I were you, seeing as she's reciprocating or not outright ignoring the ""smiley face"" comments and the likes on pictures. She had to have given her Snapchat or Instagram, or he looked her up via both and she hasn't blocked him, which are both also cause for concern...

She may or may not realize it, but it sounds like she's cheating on you emotionally, by seeming available online enough to not shut down his likes, comments, or messages. Whenever I am in a commited relationship, I perma-ban anyone who doesn't respect my relationship and continues to contact me.... Continuing to message someone who I knew seemed like they were into me would just feel like cheating. 

So yeah, I would sit down with her and say something like ""Maybe I'm reading between the lines here, but... I see this, and this, and this."" And then continue to observe if there's any further behavior that hurts or threatens your relationship."
relationship_advice,ff8lcrf,t1_ff8iiy5,1579684126.0,"Then you can either
1. Confront him, like you mentioned
2. Ignore him
3. Report him to HR or higher ups if he continues to bother you. You have witnesses that you know who can attest to his poor behavior."
relationship_advice,ff8j6fh,t3_es8i51,1579680938.0,"You need to communicate with her what your issues are with her in a calm, respectful manner. If she still continues her habits, and you can't deal with what she does, it might be time to end it. Part of relationships is figuring out if people can love and live with each other, despite their flaws. But just because you have one standard of living, and she has another, doesn't always mean it's hopeless. You just need to figure out how to coexist. Otherwise, you might be happier off on your own.

Is there another underlying cause to your upset mood and anger? Or are her poor habits the root of your frustrations? I would reflect on what is truly causing you to lash out. If you need help figuring out any of your deeper thoughts and emotions, journaling or some form of therapy might be helpful for you."
relationship_advice,ff8ifa7,t1_ff8h3b6,1579679929.0,"It's probably not all in your head, especially since other coworkers pointed it out. If you're comfortable with it, you can confront him and tell him how you feel. 

If you want him to stop but don't want to confront him, the cold shoulder works too. Just remain respectful at work, but curt and to the point when/if you need to communicate. That worked wonders when I kept getting hit on at work. 

I also started wearing a ring on a necklace around my neck... He would for sure notice and ask right away. Feel free to get creative with your story. Mine was actually a promise ring and helped fend off some of the creeps."
relationship_advice,ff8i0s9,t3_es8jtk,1579679396.0,"Wait, so you left the company he works for but still have his work email? If that's the case, I would just go for it and send your phone number, with something like ""Hi it's me, this is my phone number""... And whatever else you'd like to add, like ""Feel free to contact me if you're interested"" or ""Let's set up a date"" if you're really bold. If that makes you hesitant, maybe you get your friends/coworkers to help you set things up? Or just snag him away from everyone saying you ""need him for something for a sec.""

I started dating my boyfriend through work! He is older, has tattoos and a beard, but he was also just like your dude friend when it came to interacting - friendly and chatty enough in group settings, yet awkward and kind of shy one-on-one. Our old coworker actually kind of hinted to each of us we were both into each other/available.

With shy guys, I've just had to make the first move because I'm impatient but know what I want. And I thought he was cute and wanted him! So I kissed him once after he drove me home, and we've been together for almost 3 years! Sometimes guys just need a little nudge - or kiss -  in the right direction ;)"
relationship_advice,ff8g0y8,t3_es85a7,1579676853.0,"As far as texting goes, to get a girl to want to text YOU first, you have to keep her interested. Find out about her hobbies, interests, personality, etc. If she likes to have conversations via text, ask questions, and ask questions about those questions to keep things going. Some girls love building rapport and connections through text, some through memes, some through phone calls, some just in person. I personally only want to invest my time in people through text with those who show they are investing time in getting to know me as well. Also figure out if texting is even her preferred way to communicate or if she uses something else... A lot of my college friends use Snapchat, Instagram, or Facebook messengers because they're more fun and convenient. 

As for ""initiating,"" if you aren't the one to step up, depending on her type, you could potentially forever be friendzoned. As a college student, I've seen and heard the mindset of many women, including my friends, and can attest to this. 

If you don't show some signal early on (if she's at all interested in you) eventually she'll have doubts about whether or not you're into her. Any small hint will be brushed off as her thinking she's jumping to conclusions or seeing things. 

So unless she's very confident, outspoken or feisty, odds are you're going to have to make the first move, because our society is built upon certain norms of chivalry and masculinity."
relationship_advice,ff5irw7,t3_errhp0,1579594788.0,"I love giving gifts to my boyfriend and I've given him everything from handmade (by me) picture collages, to unique items on Etsy, to concert tickets and game systems. I know it's cheesy, but the best gifts really are gifts that ""come from the heart."" People will always want shiny, new and useful things, but items of sentimental value will last a lifetime.

I believe the things I've made by hand meant so much more than anything I could buy. These sentimental items have honestly been the best tokens of our relationship and no matter where we are in our lives, we'll always want to take these collages with us. 

You don't have to be a crafty genius to find something sentimental though. You just have to listen to your partner, find out what they're interested in, what they want, what their tastes are to come up with ideas for presents. You can tailor gifts toward their favorite tv shows, bands, interests (such as automotives, science, literature,  humanities, politics) or any hobbies.

Or if this is last minute, you could always just ask them, and then that way you know what *not* to spend so much money on."
college,fem61vv,t3_epvvhi,1579241025.0,"Sometimes people skip the first week of classes because they think it's just a ""pointless syllabus week."" So maybe give it until next week. But if it's mid-week and he's still not back, I would personally talk to your RA about it and see if anything could be done to contact your old roommate and/or his parents to see what's going on.
You've been living with him for several months and you saw some signs of concern. I think it's better to say something out of concern than to not say anything at all and drop it. You could be one of the only people thinking about him and noticing his odd behavior."
relationship_advice,fecd6t1,t1_fe7tquj,1578971149.0,"Oh yeah, people definitely lie in order to hide their insecurities, so I agree that could be another factor. Just reiterate that you love him just the way he is, that you're also not buying into certain standards about the male body, and that you've remained by his side because he's perfect to you.

That's great, I'm glad you were able to communicate your issues and he was able to understand and respond to them in an appropriate manner. Not everyone does! 

Just keep an open, honest, communicative relationship with your partner and it will do wonders. I think holding off to meet the parents a bit is a good idea. I wish you all the best with your future :)"
relationship_advice,fe7k7mp,t3_eo2hoy,1578915738.0,"Let's see, there are 2 major screw ups he did:

1. He exaggerated his count, going to the extreme of making up stories about them.

2. He lied about a poem he plagiarized off of the internet.

I've learned to give new relationships (whether acquaintances, friends, coworkers, etc.) 3 major infractions that hurt me or go against my personal morals before give I up on them and move on. It's really not worth the emotional toll on you to keep getting hurt over and over with no repercussions. You need to talk to him face-to-face or via video cam and tell him how he messed up and why it hurt you. ""I feel"" statements are supposed to be one of the most effective ways to communicate how and why you are hurt, without stating any assumptions about him or his feelings.

So maybe you could say ""I felt hurt when you made up all those people you'd slept with, when I don't care about your number or experience. I care about us and our current relationship. I care about honesty. I feel like there's a reason behind why you lied to me and I would like to know why."" 

It sounds like he is feeding into stereotypes about what women want or need in a relationship. He exaggerated his count, likely because of perceived assumptions that women want men that are ""skilled in bed"" and ""vastly experienced."" He is trying to impress you to the point of plagarazing poems. Explain to him that you don't have any expectations or standards for him to live up to, you just want him to be himself and (hopefully) that's enough for you. Maybe figure out how you like to feel loved and tell him how he can do that being long-distance (ex - love notes, phone calls, cute texts, stories, sharing favorite songs, cute selfies).

In the end, if he keeps trying to live up to certain standards and doesn't understand that you just want a genuine relationship with his authentic self, it might be time to leave. I hope all works out for you."
relationship_advice,fe7erxe,t3_eo2i5v,1578913617.0,"Remember that no partner is required or entitled to know your past history or struggles. Your history is yours to tell if and when you see fit. But I think that anything that has been on your mind, bothering you, is worth mentioning to your partner. A relationship is all about communication, sharing, and support.

Sometimes there's just never going to be a ""right time"" to say something, but you feel that it still needs to be said. Thats called honesty and not withholding your past, and being open and honest is really great! From my own personal history, I've learned that it's better to tread into it slowly rather than just drop a bomb on them, so they can take it in slowly. 

I think story format is best, like ""So a long time ago, I was (your age) with this (blank) mentality. I was going through (issue) and (issue). And that's when (crisis) happened. But since then, I've changed by (improvement) and (improvement).
*Obviously each and every personal issue and crisis is different, I'm just giving an example story template for those not so eloquent in storytelling*

college,fe784zu,t1_fe6lirv,1578911225.0,"Week one is the slowest and best week to enter in every single assignment and due date if/when you get your syllabi and deadlines! It's well worth a little time out of your week and won't take up too much time.

Odds are not every professor will upload their syllabus ahead of time because they don't want students freaking out, they want to wait until the first day of classes, or they just don't know how to use the online systems."
NIU,fdgbtm2,t3_ejst2u,1578389095.0,"If you apply to campus jobs, email or call each department individually asking if they are still hiring. Sometimes there can be issues with the NIU job page or the jobs posted are very old. Dining halls are always hiring."
NIU,fcwxk5n,t3_eg2n7i,1578041905.0,"Like other people have said, there isn’t a whole lot to do around the town like big cities do, but there are events, activities and hobbies to participate in if you look for them. They have around 200+ clubs on-campus, so you can find a club for basically anything. There are occasional events thrown by NIU and many more by clubs. There is the recreation centers, Student Holmes Center, and organizations or clubs you can go to meet new people. It is a town surrounded by farms, so you really need to utilize your resources to make your experience the best you can. I made a lot of friends in the dorms, some who drink or smoke, some who don’t. There are a good mix of different types of people, you just have to put yourself out there and start making conversations, because not everyone is talkative or wants to be the one to initiate conversation.

To summarize:

Pros - Many clubs, pretty good classes, acceptance of transfer credits, affordable education, Huskie Line transportation, many nice people

Cons - Farm county, not the “city life,” many sketchy areas right off and around campus, dining food is meh, some buildings are outdated, some people are meh"
relationship_advice,fcwwk9v,t3_ejcly9,1578040657.0,"Well, if you don’t mind losing him as a friend, I would leave it that way. It sounds like he needs help. He abused a girl to the point of needing therapy? If it was physical abuse, you have proof and know this for sure, I would consider notifying his parents and/or the police. Even if it was just mental or verbal abuse, I would still consider telling at least his parents so that they could get him the help he needs (but you might still need proof, especially if the parents are in denial). Because it sounds like he needs some sort of intervention, whether that be anger management classes, therapy, medicine, or programs.

Maybe he has something going on internally that makes him act out toward everyone around him. If you are interested in some sort of resolution for yourself, I would communicate the message “Hey, your cruel words of insults and bringing up my personal private information felt a little extreme and hurt me a little. But I’m worried about you, is something wrong? Do you need any help?” Something along those lines, because sometimes people don’t always know how to express their thoughts and emotions, they just take them out on others. Maybe he has something horrible going on in his life that he feels ashamed to tell anyone. Or maybe he’s just a terrible kid, he’ll never change, and you’re better off without him. But you can rest assured you were the better man in this situation."
relationship_advice,fcwvwqs,t3_ejcgft,1578039843.0,"She might have been jumping to conclusions and she might have thought that you were hesitating this time when she asked if she could come over. If it’s a routine question, in the past you typically accepted quickly, but this time you were slower to answer, it was probably seen as hesitation. As an anxious, quiet, introverted women myself, I often make assumptions about people’s behaviors because I’m more of an observer/listener than a speaker. I think that if someone is behaving odd, there has to be a reason behind it. And if they are acting odd around me more than normal, then I think “Oh it must be me.” I ask myself “What did I do,” “Why are they mad/sad/anxious around me??” Or “Why are they so quiet now.”

But my boyfriend has ADD and ADHD and I’ve learned that sometimes he will often zone out or stare off into space. I’ll ask “What’s up” or “What’s wrong” or “Did you catch that” and he can usually summarize what I said and also explain why he zoned out, like “Oh I was thinking about work” or “Oh I thought of that funny joke from earlier today..” 

So my advice is just to communicate what was going on through your head at the time. Explain that you definitely still want to see her, that you still like/love her and enjoy your quality time together, at that moment you had just thought about how your friends invited you to chill on Fridays as well. Ask her if this acceptable, or see if you guys can work out when to have “alone time” another night, such as Saturday. I will guarantee that if she is as introverted as me, she would much rather stay in with you at least once a week rather than going out. But that’s my preference; she could be a social introvert. It’s all about communication with her and asking the right questions."
AdultChildren,f8t0vqz,t3_e19b6b,1574793377.0,"I am 23 and just went to my first ACA meeting. There were 2 other ladies (it's a very new group) at different stages in their lives with different experiences, but we could all relate to each other in some way. 

But I get the desire to have more peers to go through this together. I've been reaching out to any friends who might find the organization beneficial to join it with me. 

I've dealt with my mom's dysfunctional parenting style, her boyfriend that is an alcoholic, and my deceased father who was an alcoholic so I'm glad I found this group to help me through things. Message me if you wanna talk more!"
