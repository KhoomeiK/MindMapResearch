britishproblems,fee69ce,t1_fed9147,1579027263.0,I love the comments section though. I like to bet on what the comments will be.
dogs,fds03rr,t3_emqkwq,1578692271.0,Sleep well Winchester. I wish you had much much longer with your family.
lostinspace,fdlnbb6,t1_fdkdn9t,1578527915.0,"Completely agree. From the pilot episode, seeing the two, I felt there was no way there could be a romance between them. She looks and is portrayed to behave like a child (albeit a teenage child) whilst he looks and acts like an adult who has life experience. This is like the original TV show or the film where the actors were looked to be of a similar age and Judy was portrayed as an adult."
Pets,fdlmjkj,t3_elt3c4,1578527405.0,I have a cat. I learnt I can either have him or house plants/flowers as he just wants to eat them and poison himself.
curledfeetsies,fdl4y6w,t3_eluy7r,1578517116.0,Most children and babies are heavy sleepers!
ProRevenge,fdjuji5,t3_elm6kt,1578487963.0,A very satisfying read
JusticeServed,fdisyj9,t1_fdi8ngb,1578450346.0,Who knows what he planned to do to these girls if they weren't able to defend themselves?
relationship_advice,fdgbpge,t3_ekytlv,1578388923.0,Why hasn't he paid you back to get a new car? Was he even insured to drive your car as surely insurance should have given you money? No wonder you are angry. His negligence has cost you a car. He should be working hard to repay the money back since this accident was very much his fault from how you describe it happening.
StartledCats,fdet5nm,t3_ekxl8m,1578346071.0,Ralph is nice and big boned. I love him!
AskReddit,fdesvv3,t3_ekt5n3,1578345911.0,"Yes, definitely. I probably wouldn’t get to sleep that late as my work would have been phoning witching 10 minutes of being late to check where I was."
cats,fdc3phl,t3_ekd7yr,1578266500.0,What a sweet wee face he has
interestingasfuck,fd3b6u3,t1_fd29v04,1578156517.0,I'd also read male puppies will let smaller female puppies 'win' too so they don't lose interest when playing.
ChoosingBeggars,fcybay0,t3_ejewev,1578077585.0,Why are these women like this? When did they start to get so entitled? I don’t think you get military spouses behaving like this outside the US.
aww,fcvjrlq,t1_fcvgp4q,1578003583.0,Thankfully not always. My colleague specifically got a puppy when she had a baby as she had a year maternity leave to raise them both. And her dog is the most pampered dog ever.

TouchThaFishy,fco40rb,t3_ei3wee,1577823658.0,This kitten knows how much doggo loves him.
dogpictures,fco3y4c,t1_fcnuz6v,1577823619.0,Although such a young puppy wouldn't be out unless they're a stray.
insaneparents,fcnua3c,t3_ei20ok,1577818545.0,Why are people so thick? You should have to have some sort of test to be a parent.
AnimalsBeingBros,fcnnk5x,t3_ehwqm3,1577814872.0,I love how he helps his new baby into the house.
dogpictures,fcn18g7,t3_ehxglg,1577800329.0,He's beautiful. My dog used to hate getting up early in the morning.
nursing,fck9ag7,t3_eh9saw,1577720041.0,I've had the labs once trying to tell me bloods taken from a Hickman had clotted.

todayilearned,fci61xz,t3_eh82wi,1577658184.0,I love him
UnresolvedMysteries,fcfe0k8,t3_eh48zo,1577628985.0,"Great write up of a very sad case. When police don't take on board the seriousness of two young children going missing, you have to wonder if high ups are involved in a possible paedophile ring."
JUSTNOFAMILY,fcfajed,t3_egwf1u,1577628063.0,I'd be seriously tempted to dump him from future gatherings.
Catswithjobs,fcb65sa,t3_egtr23,1577582871.0,What lovely chonks you have
OldManDog,fc30lsr,t3_efrqiu,1577378729.0,He's a beautiful boy. I hope you get a few more years with him.
