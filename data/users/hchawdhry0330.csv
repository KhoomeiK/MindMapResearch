news,fem3k0b,t3_epobdj,1579238582.0,"You know a similar situation happened at DQ a while back, a blind person was in line and this customer as progressing through the line dropped $20 on the floor. Some ahole customer behind him picked it up and pocketed it. The employee a young guy spotted this and confronted the thief and told him to give it back. The thief denied it and left. The employee told the blind customer what happened and pulled out a $20 out of his own pocket and gave it to the man. Some customer posted the story and it was picked up. The owner of DQ which I believe in Warren Buffet via Berkshire invited the employee to his annual shareholder meeting and rewarded his behavior. US Bank, my bank, could have rewarded their employee for being human."
