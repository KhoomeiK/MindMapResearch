90DayFiance,ffmoef6,t1_ffk7jy1,1580057280.0,I was thinking the same thing at first. Although Libby looks stunning and she did do all the work to carry and birth the baby on this day. And baby doesn't care yet anyway. :)
AskReddit,ffmg04v,t1_ffjj97j,1580054171.0,That sounds more manageable. I've got a 3-month old right now and am trying to strategize. I've always cursed quite freely.
AskReddit,ffmf0xn,t1_ffk9n6y,1580053665.0,I hope my kid is like you. :)
