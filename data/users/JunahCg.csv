They are cheap to buy, last practically forever, and could even be made at home for the especially thrifty. They can be washed by whatever means you already use for laundry. 

For internal methods to replace tampons instead there are cups of silicone, or biodegradable applicators, or ones with no applicator at all. Or if you really can't quit the plastic applicator, you can get a reusable applicator and cut the disposable plastic out of the equation.

ZeroWaste,feox4ez,t1_feov2er,1579307293.0,"What? No. You are objecting to your idea of cloth pads and not the reality.

You keep as many cloth pads as you need for the day the same place you keep plastic ones now. After changing, you put it in a watertight bag and wash it at home. (Tbh I just fold mine up and button it closed without a bag, they dont leak, but most ppl use a baggie) It takes up no more room than the new pad you grabbed and takes no extra work. It folds small enough you can keep it in a pocket, a purse; you can tuck your used pads away where you pull the fresh one from. I doubt most anyone is scrubbing these down at work, and I imagine it would be even more burdensome to try to carry a sink-washed pad with you as it'd be even wetter.

Once home you put it in the wash. It can wait till laundry day if you want. You can pre-treat or pre-wash however much you choose or none at all. It's literally easier than plastic, since you eliminate trips to the store. 

Your last post does kinda prove the point though. ""Ain't got time"" is a choice. Your personal argument against cloth pads is ""I don't want to"", which was my original point."

I know for some folks they can just never use it because it burns like hell. I have eczema as well, and when if irritation shows up I quit the baking soda hard stop until things clear up. It's also a bummer that nothing on this earth will treat eczema better than petroleum jelly. I don't really know what to do to heal it if I run out of the pre-zero waste bucket I own. I have a lot of coconut oil that I'll try but I'm not excited to lose the only thing that ever worked for me. But when it comes to eczema, nothing works better than keeping on top of it. Start treating irritation and avoid the irritant as soon as you see it, in order to keep it from becoming a whole thing.

For alternatives, if I can I'll work from home a little bit and not use any sort of deodorant for a day or two. If I can get away hiding under a stank sweater I'll use scented lotions occasionally, only if I know I won't have to see people. (I don't buy this crap, but lotion is such a common gift that I have a many-years long backlog from people who don't know me very well. People give this shit away). But the real answer for being seen in public is yup, sometimes you just need to use a deodorant that comes in plastic. Sadly.

If you can afford it, nothing works better than laser hair removal. Yes, there's a big resource use to get it in the first place, but surely it's better for reducing waste that you'll never have to shave again. Also, the doctor will use that same machine for years and years for many many patrons. It's been a blessing to my eczema to just never have to worry about hair removal anymore. I haven't had a full-blown eczema attack under the arms since I was able to stop shaving, and now only get irritated if I give things a touch-up shave, which I only do 4 times a year at most. If you're interested keep an eye on groupon, for just underarms it's not even so crazy expensive. But don't even consider it until your skin is 100% healed and a normal color.

Some of the homebrew deodorants use arrowroot powder. I think it's just a thickener and the baking soda was doing the work, but I was going to try a teeny batch and see if it has any success deodorizing. If anyone's tried different active ingredients in homebrew deodorant I'd love to hear about it.

&#x200B;

ZeroWaste,fckplgs,t1_fckfm39,1577730446.0,I'm sure coconut oil could mess a pipe right up. It's easy to go crazy with olive oil in a vegan meal since odds are the main components of the meal don't have much fat.
ZeroWaste,fckpd9u,t1_fckfsx7,1577730306.0,"Any time you'd use oil you can use cooking fat. You can saute, fry, or just add a dash in place of regular oil. I strain it first to avoid little chunks, and then keep it in the freezer."
AskReddit,fchohjr,t1_fch1y0g,1577652437.0,"Yes, the fastest and most throuogh change would be top-down. But if we didn't buy disposables, fast fashion, plastic packaging, food and goods from animals and items shipped from around the world than the money would dry up for the companies profiting off destructive practices. 

Maybe the guy's a buddha and shitty flip flops are his only luxury. We dont know. But odds are without the rampant consumerism that raised him he'd never have the idea to buy crap shoes just to chuck'em. 

Besides. Crappy shoes on vacation just sounds like torture."

Still haven't seen any evidence the artists actually got paid either."
newyorkcity,fchfd75,t1_fcgqilj,1577649914.0,"The street art ""theme"" for the high rise is the cringiest shit I've ever seen. No one who can afford the place will care what the building's footprint held 6 years before they ever heard of LIC."
ZeroWaste,fcbsx86,t1_fcbrzi2,1577590609.0,I didnt even know they were a thing. Until Thinx went broad with their advertising it was as if nobody even knew.

ZeroWaste,fcaoa0n,t1_fcaly6j,1577573238.0,"A warning is the direct opposite of hiding something. It's just a heads up to prepare the reader in case they'd like to self-select away from sore subjects. You're still free to share your message, and in some cases, may even share more openly knowing that the folks who it would trouble were already asked to steer clear. 

Imo the headline would be perfectly clear without a TW in this case, but I can't possibly understand why the TW itself would ever upset you. You're not the only person on the internet. Warnings allow the reader to choose their own adventure."
ZeroWaste,fcannmr,t1_fcaj4st,1577572859.0,I was under the impression TSS is still possible with cups. Is that not the case? You still don't want to forget the bugger either way of course.
