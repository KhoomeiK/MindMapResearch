fakehistoryporn,ffq87lq,t1_ffq85zx,1580125505.0,"Never claimed to do so, just offering another perspective. No need to be so aggressive."
fakehistoryporn,ffq85ud,t1_ffpzdqj,1580125442.0,Basketball really isn't that popular outside of the USA.
fakehistoryporn,ffq81iq,t1_ffq43dk,1580125285.0,Neither me or anyone I know had heard of him before (norwegian).
Showerthoughts,ffme4bs,t1_ffliz2z,1580053202.0,"Didn't use ö either. And considering that the majority of Scandinavians don't use ö in ragnarok, I don't see why the ""actual"" name should contain one. Also, o is closer than ö to the pronunciation of the word."
Showerthoughts,ffl3ibe,t1_ffkrucg,1580034138.0,"That's not true. Only swedes writes it as 'ragnarök'. Both danes and norwegians write it as 'ragnarok'. 
Another point is that the pronunciation of 'r' is quite different throughout Scandinavia. Coastal Norway has the french-type 'r', while Northern and Eastern Norway has the rollng 'r'."
Showerthoughts,ffl370r,t1_ffkxho1,1580033970.0,In norwegian it's just ragnarok.
Showerthoughts,ffl34e4,t1_ffl0b9p,1580033926.0,Depends on where in Scandinavia you are. Lot's of coastal Norway and southern Sweden (Skåne) have a guttural 'r' like in France and Germany.
Showerthoughts,ffl2wl7,t1_ffkztqr,1580033811.0,"Nah, in Norwegian it's just Ragnarok."
todayilearned,ff8si6z,t1_ff8qpwk,1579694378.0,"Military aviators with academic degrees. Most, if not all, astronauts have engineering or physics degrees."
worldnews,ff8pflm,t1_ff8km9s,1579690338.0,"No, LCA's show that plastic is more environmentally friendly than glass. Some reasons why: initial cost of creating glass is much higher than plastic per unit volume, and in addition, you use much more glass than plastic per bottle. Transport weight and volume of glass bottles is much higher than for plastic. Cleaning glass bottles is really bad (actually one of the worst parts), taking into account water usage, the extra transport and cleaning agents. Plastic can be recycled or burned to be used for heating."
norge,ff8id0e,t1_ff6giea,1579679844.0,"Nei, forskningsgruppa de tilhører arbeider hovedsaklig med hydrogensprøhet og materialegenskaper på mikro/nanonivå. Som all forskning finnes det sikkert militære anvendelser av dette også, men hele saken er bare overdrivelser eller misforståelser av media."
worldnews,ff8hmz7,t1_ff8dj1d,1579678902.0,It harms the environment to use glass bottles.

facepalm,fekw1x2,t1_fekr38p,1579208782.0,"Yes. However, the natural constants were selected so that the new definition coincided with the ""old"" metric definitions. It's kind of similar to AD/BC changing to CE/BCE,  but referring to the exact same dates."

facepalm,fejyobs,t1_fejwqjk,1579188846.0,"You are just pulling arbitrary number out of your ass to fit your fahrenheit scale. I could similarily say that almost all temperatures fall within -20 to 40 degrees celcius, and claim that -4F to 104F doesn't make sense."
facepalm,fejy7w1,t1_fejvhgg,1579188557.0,The base units were defined such that they corresponded to already existing metric units.

Considering rocks are only a few times more dense than water, these will have many of the same drawbacks as water storage, but to me it looks much less practical to implement."

Breadit,fctvllr,t1_fcso7rl,1577961803.0,"You are misinterpreting my words. All I said is that obtaining a patent for an invention is completely reasonable. Unless the original inventor has the right to exclusively produce or license a product for a certain amount of time, they are not fairly compensated. If other people can immediately produce copies of the inventor's product, they can get all the profit without any of the research costs."
Breadit,fcsmbza,t1_fcs5w8k,1577919600.0,Because otherwise people who didn't invest their time or money into the invention will take the compensation instead.
chess,fck5gau,t1_fck4u4e,1577717128.0,"This is correct. The default rule is that you lose if you run out of time. Then they have made the EXCEPTION that if there is no possible way for the opponent to win, the result is a draw. Here, there was a theoretical possibility for mate, so the result was a win for Carlsen."
Showerthoughts,fbulk82,t1_fbuki3y,1577116455.0,"No, we don't have those. The water level is just much lower than in the us."
