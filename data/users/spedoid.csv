asktrp,ff69e0h,t3_ermila,1579622202.0,"She's trying to work her way towards being her girlfriend. It's honestly not a bad thing. It means you're doing a good job and she likes you. But here are the facts:

1. If you just start doing date-y things with her BECAUSE she asked for it, she's going to go down the rabbit hole with it and start to demand more things. All women are like this. It is best to keep things the way they are for now, at first. If you want to change the situation then do so but it has to be YOUR choice and she has to know that.
2. If she is cool and nice, she is aware that just fucking you is not what she wants to be doing. She wants that emotional connection or whatever.

Just keep doing what you're doing. If you don't want to escalate emotionally, TELL HER. Just be totally honest with her. Be 100% honest with her and maybe tell her you need more time to decide if you're ready for commitment. I always tell girls that ""In old relationships I let stuff move too fast and it didn't work out"" and that seems to always do the trick. They respect that you've had prior ex's and whatnot. Hell, even when I was younger and didn't have any ex's I would pull the ""muh ex's"" card. Gets you another few weeks or months, for sure.

&#x200B;

If she's a decent quality woman she's not going to be content with you two just fucking and never going out and doing anything. 

&#x200B;

My advice: Tell her you need some more time. Then when she is asleep at your place, go thru her phone. Read her texts and DM's. See if she's flirting with other guys or not. I guarantee that will give you a better insight as to if you really like her or not. If she is totally dedicated to you then dating her might not be a bad idea anyway tbh."

Meanwhile my mlbs can rack up 10-16 sacks per year just blitzing uonthe middle constantly. 

Friendly reminder that blitzing with even an average secondary will get you fucking burned and that you need a good coverage unit to try and apply constant pressure

Patriots,fcmnhi9,t3_ehvtq9,1577782945.0,"Van Noy, McCourty, Tom Brady, Matthew Slanter, Joe Thuney and Jamie Collins are up for extensions next year: Here is how I would break it down:

Brady negotiates a contract to stay. 2yr/$40m with a player option for the 2nd year perhaps?

Sign Joe Thuney for whatever he's worth. Can't afford to lose a good interior OLine player

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Kyle Van Noy walks. There is no fucking WAY he is worth 4 years/ $50m like Whitney Mercilus is. No way Van Noy is worth that much. He's a good player but not at that price. Was also surprised to see that Van Noy was already making \~$6m a year. He puts up good volume numbers but I don't think he's an ideal pass rusher in a vacuum.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Jamie Collins will probably re-sign on a team friendly deal. I doubt he walks...again...to a shit team. I bet he stays here as a role player on a modest deal going forward. Mutually benefical. Will help ease the loss of losing KVN

Slater will most likely sign a cheap deal with the Pats. how much $$ can a special teamer even ask for, anyway? He's one of the best in the league but a guaranteed near-minimum contract would be appropriate I think. Can't break the bank for him, as good as he is

McCourty is interesting. I doubt he will ever play anywhere else. I think he will re-sign a decent deal and play for another year or two. He's getting up there in age but I don't see him in another jersey. A true patriots lifer. I think they can get him for reasonably cheap.

&#x200B;

RECAP:  
Brady & Thuney definitely get resigned (large deals)

Collins/Slater/McCourty could come back on modest deals at the right price (I doubt they will walk)

KVN is 99% gone unless he takes a fat discount (he wont)"
