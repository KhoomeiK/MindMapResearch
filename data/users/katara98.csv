depression,fg3mgxn,t1_fg3ld2h,1580484983.0,"First of all, there's this whole ""do I even have depression"" part. If somebody told me I did I would not believe it.    
Getting help does sound good. Too good. But I don't want to be a negative Nancy."
depression,fg3ma64,t3_ewoogk,1580484864.0,Of course an act or memory would make you feel uncomfortable. If my fears came true I bet I'd too be distressed by mentions or depictions of it.
depression,fg3m07g,t3_ewpq27,1580484688.0,"I feel like therapists actually make you realise your issues and reflect on them, as opposed to online comments that's mostly a note of advice and not a whole therapy session focusing on your illness."

My mentor was the tech lead who decided my road map, and so he decided what tasks I'd get everyday. He was a pissed off guy because he had a lot to do everyday, along with managing clueless interns. It was nerve wracking to approach him for doubt clarification."
cscareerquestions,ffzjkqo,t3_ew0gvq,1580382356.0,My mentor started giving me the easiest tasks like changing css of a page and I managed to screw up that too. Work environment was so new to me that it was almost jarring.

Again, not doing it doesn't cause me anxiety but when I'm anxious I do it so much that my mom has to move to another room. I don't know what to do and my jaw is really starting to hurt.
