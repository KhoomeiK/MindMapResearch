I've managed to make the rent and bills each month, but next month I am not going to be able to do it. I've been stuck here. I have not had the money to put a deposit, app fee, administration fee and pet deposit for 3 dogs on a new, cheaper place and make my rent and bills here at the same time. Well that all changes on February 1st because now I don't even have enough money for rent. I'm so screwed. I wish you luck. People like our exes want instant gratification and it's only their happiness that matters. Screw everyone else. But you know what? Karma will eventually catch up to these kind of people."

Please don't be like my friend. You know that it's going to take detox to get you off the Xanax. You also know it's the Xanax causing all of your problems. I hardly recognize my friend anymore, mentally. The panic attacks the med was supposed to treat are now so much worse on the med. And you're on the most evil Benzo of them all. The Xanax is messing your brain up. Please get yourself into a good program and get off them before it's too late. You have to, you know you can't detox at home. You know how dangerous that would be. If you could talk to my friend before and after her 10yr, 8mg+ a day Klonopin addiction, you'd start crying. Just do it, you can do it. Take that great insurance plan and go to another state if you want, just get off the Xanax. I'm here if you want to talk. Have faith, you can beat this."

Several years ago I was going through something and thought maybe I needed some counseling. A family member of mine told me they could set me up for a couple sessions with a counselor from their sister church for free. I went and it happened to be an older man, probably 60? Anyways he was creepy and kept wanting to sit next to me. Than he started staring at my chest and said, ""oh I'm looking at your boobs, my wife had breast Cancer."" I was shocked and luckily the session was over. I left out of there fast and never went back. I cried all the way home and had nightmares for a week. This old man didn't put his hands on me, thank God. I can honestly tell you that if he had, I would have been in bad shape, bad.

However, if it's always hurt her I can kinda understand where she's coming from. What kind of bothers me is the fact that she is unwilling to try and fix the problem. You said you've had around 10 conversations with her about this and nothing has come from those convos. Has she ever been to a Gynecologist before? If not, I'd talk to her about going to one. Heck, even if she has gone before, she needs to go back and get checked out. There may be a physical reason that's causing the pain. If that's the case, you'll both have an answer. If she is OK physically, then there's something psychological going on. If you love her take the next step and try to find out. If she is unwilling to find these things out then you guys have some long talks ahead. But no, this is not normal, and as a woman I can with confidence tell you that."

As stated above, like you I was thrown out like the garbage. He initiated the break up, and it was unexpected and out of the blue. I believe he had been cheating with a woman who lives out of the country, online, since February of this year. He denies this and swears he didn't meet her until a month after he left. An 8 year relationship that was just discarded. He left me in a financial mess, that I still haven't recovered from. I've had to sell my piano, pool table, 2 big screen TVs, blueray player, IPad, lawnmower, electric fireplace and etc.. just to supplement my income to make the bills. I'm sick that I've had to sell my things, so I harbor ALOT of anger, along with the pain of a lost relationship. I 100% believe this man is a Covert Narcissist. He matches every symptom of one.

But I'd like to break contact in a mature manner. I don't care about closure, as I have never gotten closure, even after 6mos. The man is a monkey brancher too, and if I had just dug into his past, I'd never of gotten with him.

I do still love this person, though. I wish I could turn all feelings off, but after 8 years of living with someone and sharing every aspect of your intertwined life together, it's not possible to shut it all off. I can't have contact with him anymore, or I'll never be able to get on with my life."
