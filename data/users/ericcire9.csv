AskReddit,fewmb5q,t3_eqss6u,1579414482.0,"What is your paranormal experience?

I’ve personally never experienced anything myself, but am interested in hearing your stories. Here’s one my wife has told me happened to her:

“I was walking in the hallway with my sister when we were younger in our old house. We passed our room and we both decided to look in just randomly. We have blackout curtains, so the room is totally dark, but we both clearly saw a dark silhouette of a man sitting at the edge of our bed. We obviously freak out and turn on the lights. There is no one there, but you see the bed, where we saw the figure, rising up as if someone had just sat there. We also smelled the scent of men’s cologne. My dad is the only male in a family of 7 and he was working that day.”"
AskReddit,fewk61f,t3_eqies2,1579412389.0,"So there’s 3 bands I really only listen to, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Audioslave, and Soundgarden. During that time I was just listening to The Getaway album on repeat and I decide that it’s been a while since I listen to Soundgarden. So I put my playlist on shuffle, and “Petty Noose” come on followed by “Burden in my Hand” and finally “The Day I Tried to Live.” After the 3rd song, I turn on the radio and the news breaks that Chris Cornell has died due to hanging himself. I was so freaked out, but also so so heartbroken."

AskReddit,fdndu8w,t3_em2vfz,1578583684.0,"Not my family, but my wife's. When we first began dating at 17 in highschool, she had a strict curfew of only going out one day on a weekend from 12 PM to 4 PM sharp. The dates had to be  at least 2 weeks apart and she had to ask for permission 2 weeks ahead of time. If I were to go over, at least one family member had to be present for me to stay. It got to the point where I would just go over over and when someone was home and stay an extended amount of time just to be with her, even if it meant someone was hovering over us. Or I would go out with her when she'd go out with her family because, again that would be the only way I could go out with her more than once every 2 weeks. This went on into our 20s when we were in college, same strictness. Even when I proposed to her and got engaged, the rules didn't change one bit. Everytime I'd confront my her, she'd say that all families are like that and they just don't want her to be in danger. There are so many more things, that we can write a novel. After we got our own place, it opened her eyes at how abusive they were. It's no surprise my wife hasn't talked to them since we got married 3 years ago, we hated them so much."
