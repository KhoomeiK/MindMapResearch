AskMen,ffdrxf9,t1_ffd986r,1579827430.0,Yeah it would feel weird for me if it didnt have any weight to it.
AskMen,ffd6klr,t1_ffd6729,1579814409.0,Ahh. I researched like a year ago. What i found was that the only things 100% safe from all the recentish research i did are surgical steel and platinum. Gold often uses nickel to harden it so any jewelry i get is going platinum from now on. RIP my wallet.
AskMen,ffd3ex0,t1_ffcn5lo,1579812647.0,You didnt look up what type of metals nickel allergies could wear before you bought it? I also have a nickel allergy. Extensively researched it so i would know for the future.

MurderedByWords,ffardmc,t3_esa4sn,1579742712.0,"I mean, im fat and i like any human whether fat or thin so im assuming this ""article"" is just another fluff piece trying to get a reaction from people for contraversys sake."
interestingasfuck,ff9g69b,t1_ff97gq9,1579712317.0,"Some find them annoying, others incredibly painful. Everyones teeth are different and require different things to be forced to move. I infact had 5 years of braces and headgear. The headgear was so painful i couldnt sleep at night so i would take it off which is why it took 5 years for the braces."
boyfriends,ff9em52,t3_es4zya,1579711353.0,"You have 2 choices. Either trust him until he gives you a reason to not trust him anymore, which you then break up with him for. OR, break up with him now since you already dont trust him. Dont make a game out of this."
college,ff9ck5a,t3_eryxub,1579709930.0,Online classes bro. Theyre great for the antisocial
boyfriends,ff75a00,t3_es0rzj,1579641396.0,Just ask him why?
college,fehyqkb,t3_ep1or8,1579126569.0,There will be vegetarian and vegan options so steer towards those.
boyfriends,feei2nv,t3_eoidhv,1579034186.0,"I think youre going to have to tell someone else who knows him, like parents or a best friend, and see if they can get whats wrong out of him. I would stop pushing the work thing. Focus on his emotional and mental state for now."
AskMen,febhobw,t1_febeym2,1578958880.0,Yeah my life revolves around food. I would probably save an easy 2k a year if i was more frugal with my food choices.
AskMen,feb229j,t1_featn9g,1578954733.0,"So what you're saying is that you disagree with the statement that if you stop eating out you will save money by stating that because you buy EXPENSIVE food you won't save money? I'm not saying that buying good quality food is bad or you shouldn't do it but you also can't compare the two when the goal is to save money, which for someone who is trying to save money I doubt they would be buying all the expensive food you are. You cant accurately compare the two."
college,feb05ol,t3_eo5gcl,1578954093.0,I love going to college actually. I graduated back in 2017 and actually got depressed that it was over. I'm now back for a second degree and enjoying it more than I did my first. My first degree halfway through I started dreading the time I was spending there but I realized that was more because I didn't have my priorities sorted out. Now I have priorities settled and goals I want to achieve and I am enjoying the time at college.
Boyfriend_Experience,fds2ddo,t1_fdrxa3g,1578693243.0,Youre only 2 months in! He doesnt know how he feels about you yet! Love doesnt happen overnight. And he said you guys havent said the L word YET. meaning he isnt plannning on never saying it. You are practically a lost cause at this point. I feel sorry for this guy. You are not mature enough for a relationship.
Boyfriend_Experience,fdrx25c,t1_fdrwsl7,1578690998.0,"Saying ""we havent said we loved each other yet"" isnt the same as ""i dont love you"". YOU HAVENT SAID IT TO HIM EITHER. Stop being so self centered. You wont talk to him and all you do is complain. Frankly i would say youre still not mature enough for a relationship."
Boyfriend_Experience,fdrww5k,t1_fdruixr,1578690897.0,"I mean if you want to break up with him over that comment youd be acting like an immature 12 year old with her first schoolyard boyfriend but do you. 

IMO i dont think he did anything wrong and wasnt rude at all. But do you boo"
Boyfriend_Experience,fdrwoja,t1_fdrvyfh,1578690782.0,"Look. Like i dont know why you are so immature about this but he is not a mind reader and hes his own person with his own thoughts. OBVIOUSLY if he mentioned it, its because it has been on his mind. Just because you werent talking about it doesnt mean he cant or shouldnt mention something that is on his mind. Instead of thinking the worst of him you should learn how to communicate and ask him why he said it and say that it offended you. Youre overdramatic AF and making this a huge mess when it doesnt need to be."
Boyfriend_Experience,fdrvqd5,t1_fdrvi4x,1578690437.0,Im sorry but how old are you both?
boyfriends,fdrvnwn,t3_emm9nz,1578690397.0,"Resentment kills relationships and all the stuff above that you mentioned is breeding resentment in you. You will have to have a hard talk with him and i think either way its going to end up with you guys either taking a break or breaking up permanently. 

A relationship should be 50/50. This sounds more 80/20 on your part. Ive been in those relationships. They are depressing and fuel resentment. Ask yourself if you can live with that forever."
Boyfriend_Experience,fdrumnt,t1_fdru8ck,1578690021.0,"Usually for guys the first ""i love you"" is super important. A huge milestone in a relationship. I think youre being immature and making a mountain out of a molehill but if it upset you that much then just talk to him about it, because honestly you come off as a petulent child with that comment. Not trying to be mean, just honest."
boyfriends,fdrtx63,t3_emmra0,1578689599.0,You also have to realize that you guys are really young and you have a lot of changing to do over the next few decades. What you will be comfortable with will change but for now tell him it makes you uncomfy and if he doesnt take you seriously and blows you off i would say that you should break up and find yourself and what you want.
Boyfriend_Experience,fdrt08i,t3_emndg3,1578689296.0,"Youre trying to rush things. You are only 2 months in. He is not saying that he will never love you or anything, he is saying that until your relationship deepens neither of you should meet the parents. His mom probably changed his mind from before where he thought you guys should meet each others parents."
Boyfriend_Experience,fdm3j6d,t1_fdlqacv,1578538948.0,You have to give him a chance to fix his mistakes but if hes not willing to then you know where the trash goes.
Boyfriend_Experience,fdlkgsn,t3_elz8ru,1578526048.0,"So i had a boyfriend that did similar things. Wouldnt defend me or even stand up against others talking badly anout me for no reason. I flat out told him that when you love someone you wont allow others to hurt them and that if it happened again and he didnt say anything about it not being okay i would dump his ass. 

Say the same thing to your guy. He seems to not be good with confrontation but he needs to mature and you need to see if he is willing to put you over her."
boyfriends,fdfjwup,t3_el271h,1578363438.0,Have him give classes
Boyfriend_Experience,fd5ym55,t3_ek4fx0,1578183146.0,Is this a joke? Why is this acceptable to you? You clearly and not ready to have a baby seeing as you currently are already caring for one... HIM.  Youre crazy for even thinking you want a kid together. This is toxic AF
college,fd1kq6c,t3_ejrq13,1578132602.0,"Every department has a chair and you can even go to the dean about it. Document all the attempts to reach out and complain about it. Personally for me, if i have to retake a class i take the same teacher because i already know what they are looking for and want. Even if theyre shitty you at least already went through it once so its way easier."
college,fd1hwa1,t3_ejjmmx,1578131450.0,Im stooooked. I honestly love college
boyfriends,fd1hu7e,t3_ejrdbd,1578131426.0,"Just tell him how it made you feel dude. Communicate or else he wont know.

Theres no use ruminating over this when you could just talk to the guy"
boyfriends,fd107yq,t1_fd0z9op,1578126168.0,Yeah i love my boyfriend and want to be with him for the unforeseeable future yet i know i will be miserable and wont be able to take it if gthis shit doesnt change so once he gets back from winter break im going to give him a serious talk. Like im only 23 but cmon.... were all adults and i take relationships very seriously.
boyfriends,fczouma,t3_ejnufr,1578105924.0,"My boyfriend is the same way but wont get a job because of anxiety. Hes never had a job and wants to wait til he gets his degree which is a terrible idea IMO. Hes completely dependent on his parents whims and its extremely frustrating. 

This is a serious problem for you. I know its something that might get better with age but he needs a reality check. Honestly with the way your bf is i would say hes clearly not ready to have a girlfriend if he cant even get his shit together. Tell him youll support him in getting therapy for his anxiety or teaching him to drive or whatever but he needs to do something.

You shouldnt waste your time on something that wont change, ya know?"
boyfriends,fcx0m2o,t3_ej8tz4,1578045874.0,"From experience im gonna tell you some shit you dont want to hear but ptobably already know. 

Saying that no one would want to listen to you rant about your bad day and that you should be grateful that he did is toxic and manipulative. The right guy will care for and support your emotional wellbeing. This guy is trash and definitely does not care about you as much as you care about him.

The honeymoon phase is over and youre seeing what this asshat is really like. It will not get better. 

I think you know that as well and i hope you make a choice thats good for you."
boyfriends,fcwsvjx,t1_fcvr5cr,1578036246.0,Good luck!
boyfriends,fcvqm0f,t1_fcvoaph,1578007885.0,"Honestly, i think it will cause tension, because asking them to speak in english around you for me feels kinda nosy, but i understand your mentality. And i think just explaining that it makes you feel socially alienated would be the best way to explain why you would like them to speak in english sometimes."
boyfriends,fcvntf2,t1_fcvmy4x,1578006110.0,"Have you said anything to them? Having your bf say something is weird and offputting. 

Like you could tell them that you are trying to learn the language but until then if they could use english while youre around you would feel a lot better. If they dont want you hearing something then they can speak the other language?"
boyfriends,fcvmkfc,t3_ej37y1,1578005324.0,"I have a similar situation. For me, i dont think its fair to make my boyfriends family try to speak english so starting this semester im taking spanish classes in college. 

In my opinion, if i want to be able to communicate with them then i need to do the work to learn the language. Until i learn it i have my BF translate for me."
Boyfriend_Experience,fctj0qr,t1_fctf6yg,1577944956.0,"The ability to observe a pattern in my mind isnt the same as being unable to ""let things go"". When i read her comment it made me think of the girlfriend who brings shit up 4 months after its no longer relevent and holds onto something they should have moved past already. 

Girls generally are great at observing patterns and if there is an established pattern then that is far different issue from dragging on a mistake someone has made. 

OP, if you feel that there is this pattern where he makes you feel stupid then talk to him about it. Tell him its unacceptable and you wont be around someone who consistently makes you feel like that"
Boyfriend_Experience,fct1x4z,t1_fcsrlwb,1577930747.0,I doubt hes thinking about it after youve told him you accept his apology. If you cant let go of things thats ALL on you and you should seek therapy because thats a toxic trait. You need to be able to move on dude. Stop letting your insecurities ruin your relationship.
college,fcsnalm,t3_eii1l4,1577920261.0,"6-9 hours a day is WAY too much and ineffective. You will never be able to remember all the information youre trying to cram into your brain in that day. Shorten that to a max of 4. Also, if youre studying that much and still dont feel prepared, i would assume you are not stidying effectively. Your school will have resources on effective studying techniques and so dies the internet. Find out what type of learner you are, and what techniques work well with that. 

ALSO, if you know what class youre taking next semester, get the textbooks early and start reading through them and take a set of reading notes and when xlass starts take a set of lecture notes and compare the two to see if you have any questions or learned anything new.

That way youll be ahead on your classes."
Boyfriend_Experience,fcslo62,t3_eifg1j,1577919167.0,"It seems like you already corrected the situation, why are you trying to make more out of it than there is?"
Boyfriend_Experience,fclucl8,t1_fclu015,1577756672.0,Id do it when his parents arent around or in a neutral place like a park. Just somewhere you can be alone
Boyfriend_Experience,fcljo22,t1_fclf6o5,1577749352.0,"Honestly you need to have a hard talk with him before you decide anything. I would show him this thread. Say you dont know whats going on and dont know what to do about it but that something needs to change. 

If he thinks everything is fine then tell him its not and that if nothing changes youll have to break up, because youre miserable"
Boyfriend_Experience,fcjtlgv,t3_ehgbbg,1577704059.0,"So multiple things could be going on, my 1st guess is health problems that are killing his sex drive or hes realizing he is asexual. The 2nd guess would be he no longer finds you attractive and does not want to be with you physically but is too pussy to break up with you. 

Either way, if you are feeling like your relationship is unfulfilled, break up and find one that works"
boyfriends,fcjtciy,t3_ehe1kn,1577703693.0,Why would it piss you off? You guys broke up. Getting mad over him wanting his things back is immature. Put all of his stuff in a box with his name on it and drop it off at his place or tell him where he can pick it up.
Boyfriend_Experience,fci9zrp,t3_eh83br,1577659576.0,"Extreme red flag for me. Also, just because he has a law degree and seems calm for the most part doesnt mean he doesnt have a temper and anger management issues. 

Frankly if it was me, i would wait until the holidays are over, go back home and break up with his ass."
boyfriends,fc8dift,t1_fc7lk5h,1577532472.0,Is this a new thing or has it been going on all this time?
ChoosingBeggars,fc7jdt1,t1_fc7ga9f,1577509293.0,Yeah theres always been very strict circumstances where kids 12+ could work. Back when i was 15 i couldnt work until 15.5 so its cool that its changed to younger since 14 is usually freshman in HS age.
ChoosingBeggars,fc6xoi9,t1_fc2l5rr,1577492163.0,California. Here its 15.5 years old to work.
ChoosingBeggars,fc6xn93,t1_fc2juaw,1577492138.0,"I live in cali. It is illegal to work in a public? job (i dont know the right word to describe these jobs), say a grocery store for instance, until you are 15.5 years old. So lets say if OP lives in cali, her daughter just turned 15. She would need to wait 6 months before being able to work a job where you would get a paycheck with taxes deducted. All states in the US have their own regulations and each country has their own federal child labor regulations so check your country/state laws before attempting, it saves time."
ChoosingBeggars,fc6x89s,t1_fc2mlmi,1577491832.0,True.
ChoosingBeggars,fc41hci,t1_fc2tus9,1577404144.0,"I used the word force because that is the situation that all the comments are putting forth -- how the mom should make the kid get a job. No one knows the kids narrative on if they want to get a job so until that is revealed then yes, forced would be the word. 

As for your other comments you are correct, there are many things kids can do to earn money i was a tutor myself before 15, however many people do not consider them to be ""real"" jobs which is why i advised about checking the laws since you do not know what the mothers definition of a job for their child would be."
college,fc2ejhu,t3_efsmfi,1577355626.0,"Look up your professors on ratemyprofessor.com and see what students have said about your specific class (by the class code). Its a huge help in preparing mentally and physically for the type of teachers you will get. 

Also, at the beginning of the semester i go HARD on the work. Get it done immediately after it is assigned. That was you dont fall behind, also the fresher it is in your mind, the easier the work is to do. After the first month or two youll figure out where you can cut some slack in each class to keep yourself from burning out."
ChoosingBeggars,fc2e7xh,t1_fc2bj84,1577355079.0,In many states its illegal to work at 15 so OP needs to check her state laws before attempting to force her child to work.

boyfriends,fc0wxo6,t3_efeijb,1577301880.0,"I feel like you should break up now nefore things get worse, because from my experience this is one of those things that bugs you now but in a few years youll have come to resent. Resentment destroys relationships. You two just arent compatible when it comes to your emotional/social needs from each other and thats okay. It doesnt make him less of a man or you out of his league. Youre both equal, just not right for each other."
