AmItheAsshole,fgofqwl,t3_ezhlhs,1580968419.0,"NAH.  My kid goes to Montessori and they take her at the door and whisk her into class.  She’s been in 2 different Montessori’s and they both have done the same.  It seems standard practice and a way to get the kids to be more independent and ready to “work”.   All kids get whisked away and parents are not allowed into the classrooms.

Maybe her teacher is trying to get your daughter to be more independent and let go of this routine which seems unusual for a Montessori, even with precare.  She should have talked to you in a parent/teacher conference about helping your daughter be more independent, but I don’t think she was doing it to harm your child.

And again, my kid started Montessori at 20 months and it was hard the first week having her taken back to the classroom, but she has adjusted and I think it’s been positive for her (she’s almost 4 now and just runs straight to her classroom with a quick goodbye)."

dogs,fgm0zp6,t1_fgll39n,1580915704.0,"I hate how they hold a metaphorical gun to a dogs head and say ""if you don't adopt this dog right this second it will DIE!""  My in-laws went in to get a small dog for my mother-in-law and they came out with two dogs.  When we were like ""why did you get two dogs!!"" they replied that the shelter told them they were scheduled ""to be destroyed"" the following day and if Jane didn't take them it they would be put down.  

Maybe it's true, maybe it's not...but they convinced two 60+ year old retirees to adopt TWO chihuahua mixes by making them guilty.   These dogs are obviously litter bonded or whatever the phrase is and have been kind of psycho dogs since the beginning (mostly due to poor training and handling by said in-laws who probably should not have gotten dogs in the first place).   It's absolutely been my experience using shelters in southern US that they will threaten to destroy dogs or cats if you don't adopt them immediately in an effort to move dogs and make space.

Are the shelters being malicious?  Not really, I think they are desperate to move animals and not have to put any down.  But they really need to rethink shoving animals onto people who obviously aren't suited to have more than one, a certain type, or whatever."

My kid was a reflux baby from the start, I couldn’t breast feed so she was angry and starving and I was angry and self loathing, my husband was helpless because everyone yells “breast is best” at new parents and he could only watch us struggle...and that was the first couple of weeks.  It didn’t get easier after two weeks, but I didn’t want to throw myself of a building after I eventually switched to formula and we got more of a routine going.  

I apologize for getting defensive, it just really irks me when other parents and not lifting up new parents and recognizing their struggles and helping them look for the bright spots that will be coming.  The original couple is struggling right now.  How on earth does it help them to say “if you think you are struggling now, just wait until it really starts sucking!”  That’s not helpful and it may not even be true.  We don’t know what their experience is.  Let’s just try not to shit on each other and lift each other up when we struggle.

Now she’s almost 4 and an utter delight compared to the new born stage.  My husband still has PTSD from the newborn/infant phase (by that I mean first 10 months).  He had to have extensive therapy to help him cope.

Anyways, my point is, it doesn’t get harder for some babies.  Some children are fairly straightforward and easy newborns and then horrendous toddlers, others are tough infants and then become easy toddlers.

Then, around 2, I would let her help me in small ways.  She’s now 3.5 and able to store pour ingredients and stir stir stir, help me decorate (poorly), and adores hanging with me in the kitchen.  A lot of times she will just stand on her stool and watch from a safe distance or help me throw away strawberry tops when I chop fruit.  It’s lovely."
