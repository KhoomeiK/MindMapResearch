ChemicalEngineering,ff5hbz7,t1_ff4x0m3,1579592889.0,"Goodness, why not take the free option? Really, the undergraduate school isn't that important. Work hard, do well, learn how to interact and be social (I mean, learn how to talk to people, which a lot of people overlook as a skill for job search), and you will be fine. Then this way you don't start off with mountains of debt. That will itself give you more flexibility in your future and it will help you feel SECURE when you graduate. If you are considering a family in your 20s/30s then this gives you a jump-start. 

When I was your age, Cincy had a good reputation for polymers. J&J is local. There's stuff not far in Michigan and elsewhere in Ohio. Agriculture everywhere. But that is in the future. You can shape your future. It is largely up to you. 

All of these are solid schools. Reputation doesn't go that far, especially when looking for local jobs. Grad school, maybe. But local employers love to take local people. They're inexpensive to interview and hire, they tend to have roots to keep them in town. Things like that. 

I went to State U for free. I did well because I worked hard. I got into grad school at a top 5 and admitted to another top 10. State U didn't hinder me. I had another friend who went to MIT for his PhD. Another to NC State, another into the UC system. Those who didn't go to grad school ended up largely in the big cities in the state working for engineering firms of varying flavors. Generally we were all happy and stable. 

Take the free option. Beyond that, it will be what you make of it. Do a minor if you want. Not even a close call."

CFB,ff2hgkv,t1_ff1mhkf,1579506307.0,"In Monopoly the board comes with some number of houses and hotels. Hotels are the highest rank, and only 1 per property is allowed. Houses are lower, and you have to build 4 houses on a property before you can build a hotel, like leveling-up. As you build houses and then graduate to a hotel, the rent a competitor plays when landing on your property increases. A lot. It's already usually very high before you promote to a hotel. 

Let's say there are 10 hotels in the game and 30 houses. When you build a hotel on a property, all the houses go back into the stock supply. Others can use them. Recycled. But while on the board, obviously they are yours and could only be mortgaged/sold by you. 

A player can strategically choose NOT to promote to hotel to lock the other players out of some of the houses. This depresses their rent significantly. If you never promote to a hotel, others can't buy houses. 

It's a stategic option to try to race to _any_ monopoly or monopolies on the board and build-out houses but not promote to hotel. With enough luck, it's almost unbeatable if you achieve it."

intermittentfasting,fdvsy6k,t3_emznic,1578751170.0,"Never done IF before. Started to think about it earlier this week to jump start losing some extra pounds. I had been skipping breakfast here and there. I wasn't hungry on Tuesday night, so I skipped dinner, then skipped breakfast on Wednesday. I had a very filling lunch of one can of sardines and a lot of steamed spinach and some zucchini in tomato sauce, and felt so full I wondered if I could skip dinner again.

Then the next day I woke up a little hungry but decided to skip breakfast and see if I could go 24 hours. Feeling fine at lunch, I decided to try for 48. Feeling fine at dinner, I started thinking ""what if I can push this to 72 hours?"" Never intentionally fasted for even a day before, so why not see where my willpower could take me? 

I pushed and pushed because on Friday it was tough while making snacks and dinner for my kids to not eat or even lick the peanut butter knife. God everything looked delicious. I made it to *70 hr 8 min* before I couldn't do it any longer and slowly ate a half a banana and a slice of whole wheat bread. 

Almost three full days fasting, nothing but water and black coffee, *only one small meal in 96 consecutive hours!* I'm honestly amazed I had the discipline to do that. This is great though, it jumpstarted the weight loss by getting me a couple or few weeks worth of calorie deficit in a few days.

I had a light lunch and I will eat light tonight. I feel totally fine. Right back to baseline. Not hungry. 

I won't do that again, no way, but I'll keep skipping breakfast and periodically skip dinner when I feel fine. Eat lean and I'll be where I want to be in a few months."

But since then the courts have realized they massively fucked up because she has been found to have lied in court nonstop for years, neglected the kids, and now a custody evaluator is reporting she emotionally abuses them, too (alienation from me, parentification towards her). She stole so much money. So much. But she did it in a way that it wasn't ""stealing"" as we were married technically but she knew we wouldn't be soon so she shoveled a lot away where it became hers. 

And also I just recently found she illegally registered our children as living in another country for many years so she could collect social benefits from that government while we were not living there, and she shoveled that money to her parents so they could pay their debts. Over ‚Ç¨20k in fraudulently received, tax-free funds that weren't even used for the children. I'm waiting to bring this to the authorities very soon and considering suing her on behalf of our kids.
