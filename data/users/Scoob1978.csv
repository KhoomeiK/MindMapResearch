gadgets,ffcf5wz,t3_esv1lu,1579798137.0,I freed up 15-20% of my bandwidth thanks to this. It doesn't interfere with Netflix or Disney +. I point my DNS settings in DHCP to my pihole so the whole family is protected. No one complained except the one time the pi died. Luckily I already have the image backed up. I also use Barracuda as a dropbox replacement on the same device. It's great.
AskReddit,ffce2i7,t3_esuhmm,1579797464.0,There is a 99% invisible episode detailing this. It turns out we mostly are already metric. The medical industry is fully metric. A lot of companies are half metric. Gas companies use the English system when selling to customers but covert to metric when calculating total cost. It makes it easier to compare costs across countries. Same with milk.

slaythespire,febwj7e,t1_febbzjg,1578963514.0,Build your deck based on the relics/cards you can get early on and go from there. You have until the beginning of the second Act to pivot if you get a great card like demon form despite building a blockers deck. The defect has a few cards that allow for bigger decks and is a bit more forgiving. With Ironclad you sort of have to get a little more lucky but he is the strongest one. The Ironclad has more ways to win than any of them but you need to build on what you get early on. For example if you get \[\[Searing Blow\]\] really early on you can smith it until it does over 100 damage while eliminating as many cards as possible and keep defense cards and dominate.
slaythespire,febblpa,t1_feb5msl,1578957182.0,With Ironclad go with straight Strength or Block builds (whatever the game gives you). With defect focus on keeping looping and cycling the orbs. Defect is hardest at higher ascensions because he doesn't really have a killer build like entrench+barricade+body slam or poison stacks.
