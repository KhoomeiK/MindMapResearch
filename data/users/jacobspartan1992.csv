MapPorn,ffcydb7,t3_esdctf,1579809817.0,"I find Wallace's line not quite accurate. Taiwan and the Philippines should be on the other side since Austronesians resemble East Asians much more than Papuans. 

Austronesians clearly were Asiatic since Polynesians who intermixed only a little with Papuans appear more Asian as well."
MapPorn,ffcxgpi,t1_ff96vls,1579809298.0,"The genetic distance between the most genetically distant modern human populations is 120k years. For anyone outside Africa it's just 70k years.

The nearest genetic distance between Homo Sapiens and Neanderthal 'pureblooded' populations was 700ky. You're moving well into species differentiation ranges there. 

For Denisovians it will be similar, they were probably a much closer relative to Neanderthals than to us. 

For Erectus you're looking at a genetic distance as high as 2my. That's another species folks."

todayilearned,ffcm55a,t1_ffcan0y,1579802381.0,"It's more the decline in the economy, mismanagement and corruption rather than military per se. Diplomatic and trade transactions can sustain you sufficiently. This accounts for most small and medium sized civilisations throughout history. Though tbf most of these had imperial ambitions anyway so militarize because of that..."
todayilearned,ffclt4c,t1_ffcafan,1579802181.0,"Incidentally enough, the Inca presented an exception for the most part due to geography. They benefited from the natural mountain fortress that was the Andes. Tibet also faired well in the Himalayas.

Other nations under low pressure to militarize were the Minoans of Crete who were a peaceful trading civilisation and the Ancient Egyptian civilisation through out much of its history, protected by flanks of hot, dry desert."
todayilearned,ffc8g72,t1_ffc2iaq,1579793928.0,"The thing about China and Rome was that when they were bested by a foe they held their hands up and made the marauders an offer to sign on as auxiliaries and plunder that other city state over there...

This worked for a time but eventually as the dynasty or state fell upon hard times they couldn't pay the mercs."
todayilearned,ffc7yxh,t1_ffbzzw1,1579793621.0,"No because there's more to establishing the basic aspects of civilisation than 'smash! smash!'.

What you need is an agricultural complex that can provide high enough yields and have sophisticated enough methods of food storage and preservation to allow a section of the population to specialise in pursuits outside food production. Every society than deserves the title 'civilisation' has at least this."
todayilearned,ffc7hvz,t1_ffbyo3d,1579793316.0,"It was the Maya that produced those. Since there was little pre-Columbian contact between Mexico and Peru, the Inca probably didn't know of the wheel at all.

All the American civilisations expect maybe the Mississippians who fell short of establishing themselves, had little incentive to develop wheeled vehicles since they either inhabited difficult terrain, mountains and jungles or had everything they needed resource wise nearby like in Central Mexico."
todayilearned,ffc6z0v,t1_ffbyfiv,1579792977.0,A llama would be able to pull a cart up to a certain size for sure. The earliest wheeled carts in Mesopotamia would've likely been pulled by people first and beasts of burden later.
todayilearned,ffc6pvt,t1_ffc4fce,1579792812.0,"But then no one expected the Spanish Inquisition.

The Inca could've done with establishing themselves a thousand years earlier, then we would've seen more of their potential as a civilisation."

nextfuckinglevel,ffbxwlv,t1_ffa30fw,1579786294.0,It's probably genetic. Dogs have a gene which if deleted will double muscle mass naturally. Humans also have a muscle reduction gene which our closest relatives Chimpanzees lack so they appear ripped. When the gene is deleted in humans you get ripped 6 year olds.

AskReddit,ff8waxm,t1_ff8m0mp,1579698220.0,"This is a problem mainly in Anglophone countries. I'm rooting for other nations like Germany and the Far East because, for the time being at least, they are minimally rational about stuff. 

There's a lot to cuss China for I get it but I think they are still more committed to not seeing the earth become a smouldering rust ball than the US elite."

As for the Balkan Muslims, I'd say they are still similar culturally to their Christian neighbours. I was also thinking about the Armenians and how asiatic they seem, more similar to Levant Christians and Copts than Europeans."

MapPorn,fez9e4k,t1_fewya9n,1579455048.0,"I've a feeling that in the past, fish consumption in the UK would've been notably higher. In recent years environment damage and declining fish stocks have been in the news, the price of fish has gone up and we've got cheap alternatives everywhere.

It's older folks who tend to eat more fish. Younger people prefer meat and there's also lots more vegans around here."

MapPorn,fez7my8,t1_fez69qg,1579454525.0,I actually think this border makes more sense geopolitically since the Caucasus is so culturally distinct from Europe. It certainly seems more aligned with the Middle East.

I can probably settle for some inaccuracies and fantastical accounts of places but prefer not to embellish terra incognita regions with detailed lore.

I tried a succeeded at No Nut November and after that dropped out of the habit of doing it regularly. The new medication I've been on and change in living circumstances also played a subconscious part I think.

todayilearned,felce3m,t1_fekvjv0,1579218880.0,Yes that's my idea of it. The civilisation that spawns from that is sustained by the long-term food stores produced by reliable harvests. People can spend more time pursuing the arts and sciences when they've got that food sorted.
todayilearned,fektrnh,t3_epls22,1579207433.0,"Back when I was inquiring about faith, I had a fixation on Zoroastrianism.

She was responsible for the deaths of thousands at least during her reign and specifically targeted Christians and sought to purify the country of European influence. She also instituted a forced indentured labour tax and brought in a number of brutal methods of capital punishment.

She was true metal album material."

AskReddit,fee97qo,t1_fedrp5l,1579029003.0,"Putting a stigma on virginity or on men clearly struggling, probably cause of adverse circumstances and mental or physical illness is not progressive AT ALL.
