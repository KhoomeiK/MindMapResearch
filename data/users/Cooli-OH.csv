It’s orbiting at 90 miles a second, so it’s reckoned , a sun that is the source of all our power. 

The sun, and you and me, and all the stars that we can see, are moving at a million miles a day 

In the outer spiral arm of 40,000 miles an hour of the galaxy we call the Milky Way 

Our galaxy itself contains one hundred billion stars. It’s one hundred thousand light years, side to side. 

It bulges in the middle, 16,000 lightyears thick, but out by us it’s just 3,000 lightyears wide. 

We’re 30,000 lightyears from galactic central point, we go round’ every two hundred million years

And our galaxy is only one of millions of billions in this amazing and expanding universe! 

The universe itself keeps on expanding and expanding, in all of the directions it can wizz. 

As fast as it can go, the speed of light, you know. Twelve million miles a minute, and that’s the fastest speed there is! 

So remember when you’re feeling very small and insecure, how amazingly unlikely is your birth...

And pray that there’s intelligent life somewhere out in space, cause’ there’s bugger all down here on earth 💗✨

For background, I did it because one time at a birthday party I wore a tophat to be funny and wacky but by the end of the night I felt like the reaction was overall pretty positive so I became tophat me and I changed all my photos and my bio to reflect my cool new persona. I felt that my sepia tone profile picture of me, tilting the hat so one eye was juuuust visible, was perfectly emblematic of my cool new ‘tude. The next day at the bus stop I couldn’t help but ask if my friends had noticed my edgy new online personality and they sort of stared while acknowledging that, yes, they’d seen it. A couple days later an emo girl liked my profile picture and referred to me as top hat. She had over 1,000 friends so you can imagine how validating that moment was. I also went through a phase where I was very attached to a Matrix Halloween costume. I saw ‘the matrix: reloaded’ a few years earlier and it was the first time I saw breasts in the movie theatre. Anyways that’s my story and I’m sticking to it. MCR 4 Lyf. TopHat out."

It’s staggering to bare witness to the embodiments of heightened American ideals, as we all see Trump as leaning far right, and Bernie as far left (I hate saying “far-x” I’m only using it to illustrate the point.) 

And I think it’s interesting how two sides of the same coin are often subjected to similar reactions. The media attacked Trump repeatedly to the point where the focal point of every debate was “what do you think of trump?”

Oddly enough it seems that Bernie is going through the same thing. And the results may very well be similar too: attention will lend itself to credibility. I’m personally happy. I think people who don’t know much of Bernie will see his name enough to look him up themselves, and I think that most of them will hear the sincerity of his message.

Meaning that when he throws out any kind of complicated accusation, it’s almost certainly something he’s done himself. Again, he lacks the empathy and imagination to deduce someone’s intentions, he can only draw from personal experience. Honestly I wouldn’t be surprised if Trump faked his birth certificate. Seriously, he probably faked it, or knows someone who did, thought to himself, “jee that was easy! And you know, Obama IS black, and black people are from Kenya. And Hussein sounds Muslim! I’ll bet he’s a Muslim from Kenya, and I bet he faked his birth certificate!”
