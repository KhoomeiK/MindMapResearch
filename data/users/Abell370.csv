At 127lbs, you have a TDEE of around 1,400 tops. In order to get to 2,400, you'd need to do about 3 hours of intense activity a day. Unless you work an active job, that's a hell of a commitment to sports.

Pick a program from the sidebar (or on /r/fitness), run it and stick with it, even when school starts again. If your plan is to go ham for 2 months and then quit once school starts, I say don't even bother.

Make a plan for how you can start now and continue. I.e.: pick 2 programs you like and try them both for 4 weeks and stick with the one you like most when school starts again."
