The egregious picture? 

My family was on the log flume (canoe looking thing, all in a straight line, big drop into water at the bottom, you get maybe splashed a little). We were arranged smallest to biggest so we could all be seen in the picture. I yell out to everyone ""make sure your hands are in the air for the picture just before we drop"" 

Both my young sons (late elementary school age) have their hands in the air, my wife has her hands in the air, and I have my hands around my wife with my hands on her tits (over her clothes of course) and I caught her completely off guard so she is in the middle of super shocked face moving toward laughter and I've got a giant goofy grin on my face and our kids are oblivious. 


It was one of the best pictures of a funny moment for our family and I would have paid twice their exorbitant price so I could take it home and frame it.

We were all interested in maybe finding a church to join so we started all going to different churches in the area to visit. 

One sunday, my wife and I were going out of town and so the other two couples went to a new church without us. Apparently we missed a good time. It was more than advertised I guess.

After an hour or so in, things started to heat up a little ...revving up toward some congregational healing stuff I guess. They started getting amped up and chanting and loud praise whooping and the like. Well, about that time the pastor announces, ""For the next hour we're going to do some healing!!""

One of the women in our couple friends grew up in a very conservative evangelical church. She was open to a little less traditional, but she apparently felt like she'd walked in on the snake charmers. She stood up and told the group, ""oh, hell no. We gonna bounce up outta this mad house right now""

It is accelerating as bandwidth goes up and storage costs come down. 

If gamestop survives it will be through incredibly savvy asset consolidation, a  revised business model, and incredibly good marketing. I just don't see it happening. Once second hand media for this generation of consoles dies off, the largest amount of their revenue will drop like a rock.

I've never hated building software. I still like the problem solving aspect of it, but the entire world has malformed into some giant fucking corporate slog with cookie cutter problems and bullshit red tape and miles of bureaucratic  filth you have to wade just to stay in the field. Everywhere you turn it's more of the same. Non technical people with a fucking handbook and a business degree and no understanding of how to build software or logically solve problems trying to define the methodology for creative analytical people to be successful yet doing nothing but throwing up more barriers to success.

Welcome to corporate development. Where you are paid well to slowly watch your soul die.


Edit: for those finding it bleak, I too echo what others have said. Find a change. I have been lucky to have finally found a place I really like with a role that fits where I am at this place in my life. I transitioned to management and technical leadership a few years ago after always denying it as a path. It had its own share of blech, and I don't knock out much code these days, but it brought a completely new set of problems to me which has forced me to challenge myself and grow in new ways and I have found that rewarding. 

I can also say that in years past, it was usually the place or the repetition that was getting me down. A change of scenery with a new set of challenges and/or technology was often a big help in getting past the feeling of burnout.

Yet I believe them on the stress factor. I can pinpoint the year for me. I was about the right age, at 36, but my son entered 6th grade and it was a rough year for all of us. It did not go well. I also transitioned between 3 companies in 18 months and in one I had a highly stressful role with extreme responsibilities but no authority, a looming deadline, and 60+ hour weeks for months. It didn't take 5 years. The grey showed up inside 9 months for me. Speckled and not heavy, but it came out faster that year than ever beford.

I haven't moved that way just yet, but I'm here and I'm interested.  My first step will likely be aligned more vegetarian/pescatarian? than hardcore vegan, but I may start making a few days a week become completely plant-based in order to reduce my footprint on the planet a little bit more and to hopefully start nudging my body into a healthier place. 

I believe in gradual changes. I've only made a few radical changes in my life that were behavior driven and gotten them to stick. I have up soft drinks cold turkey in 1999 and it was hard. I was a mountain dew and coke classic 200oz a day guy. Then one day I just said enough is enough. 21 years later and I've been willing to cheat a little here and there as a mixer or a special treat I'll have a special ginger ale I like, but I've never had another mtdew or coke. That was my cocaine and I know not to go play with the devil. 

I'm hoping I can gradually pull more and more meat from my diet and find a healthy balance that is sustainable. I'd love for that to be zero meat, but I'm also realistic and I want to find a balance as close to zero that I will live with and sustain. 

I hope this change is good for you!! I'm looking for motivation where I can find it."

pics,fepcvct,t1_fep7g73,1579317404.0,"Depends. My senior year of college, we were hit by a massive hailstorm. It was two weeks before graduation. I was in the middle of loading my car to go home with a load for the weekend. I was parked in the loading zone and had just gone up to my room when the sirens went off. There was a tornado warning and massive winds. The sky opened up and it sounded like the end of days. There were a bunch of us huddled in the stair well of my dorm and we weren't sure what we would find when we went outside. The year was 1998 and mankind threw.....ah, just kidding, it was for real 1998. Bowling Green, KY and one of the worst hail storms on record in KY. 

When we exited from the stairwell we saw a surreal sight. It looked like it had snowed. The field in front of the dorm was white with 4 inches of ice. The hail came down so hard and so fast, none of it had really started to melt yet. It was everything from nickel to softball sized hail. The town had been flat wrecked. Tree limbs down everywhere, broken glass everywhere, pretty much every car parked in the open was turned into a golf ball. 

See, the trick to totalling a vehicle is doing more damage than the repair cost of the vehicle. What really amped it up wasn't just the hail. Though, that did a doozie. The problem is when it breaks all of the glass and then it continues to rain for the next 8 hours straight. Between the dents creating breaks in seals because of deformed metal, and all the broken windows, water gets everywhere in the car. In all the electrical areas, standing in thw floorboards, into the dash, puddled in the seats, etc. So now you have a car with dents everywhere, every body panel needing to be replaced, all windows replaced, electrical problems, ruined carpets and leather and seats soaked into the foam that will start to mold, etc. Basically a destroyed car with the equivalent of flood damage. 

 I saw cars with dents so big, you could put your fist in them. There was a car lot in town of new cars that had a complete loss. Every car totalled and sold in bulk to a reclaim yard. I drove by it before they were all sold off and it looked like a monster truck had driven through their lot. 

I was incredibly lucky. I happened to be parked under a big tree that took the brunt of the damage. I had a handful of smaller dents and no broken glass. For 10 years you would see cars around town and you knew they had been there when it happened because they'd have rippled dents on the hood, trunk, and roof."

There were no skid marks at the scene, my son said the driver had a turn signal on, and had corroborated statement from one of the other 2 people in his car. The car hit my son's car so hard it bent the engine compartment, shoved the radiator and battery against the block, bent the frame on the OTHER side of the car, then careened off him, went up a 6 foot embankment, slid on his side, then didn't stop until he hit trees 150 yards away.

I'm 43 now and it's been about 5 years since I was in absolutely wonderful shape (37-38). I'm ready to go back to it, but this time around I am researching a plant-centric diet as a major component to it. I've always been a meat eater but post 40, I've started to see more and more how much meat affects how I feel. I may never go 100% meatless,  but I may go 5/7 days a week or something manageable for me and my life.  At some point there is a psychological point to food consumption as well and for me as someone who loves food, cooking, and consuming it, will have to be realistic with myself that a zero state may not ever be achievable. Same with sugar. It may be the most dangerous chemical on the planet, and yet I know there is no way I will even try to go 100% sugar free for life. 

That was rambling. Sorry. I just really feel the pain. I'm looking at lifestyle change and that only comes for me usually by ramping in. Hard switches generally always have rebound periods."

What if they offered a version where you had to confirm having mics on, if you needed help or not, etc.  What if they set it up so that it would queue you up in a lobby with two other people and you could talk about your load out before it started?

DestinyTheGame,fd9q22h,t1_fd7uzll,1578236610.0,"I think the cost curve is the problem.  I am season pass level 103. I've master worked only 3 or 4 pieces of armor this season, and maybe 5 or 6 guns. 

I love to play with builds, as the game was built around that idea, but it's hard to justify when a MW piece has an effective score in the 80-90 range and I can get 10 points worth of mods in it. 

So, instead, by the end of the season I'll probably have maybe 1 or 2 more masterwork armor pieces if I'm lucky. 

The curve should really be setup so that if you do every bounty from banshee in a day, that is enough to masterwork 1 piece of armor. Or at the least,  each of his weeklies can effectively masterwork 1 piece of gear each.


This is even more justified if the armor is just going to be obsolete at the end of the season"

DestinyTheGame,fd2wyej,t3_ejlouv,1578152428.0,"Here's what I don't understand.  MICRO transactions are to be small by nature. 

If every weapon ornament, gear ornamet set, speeder, ship, emote  were $1 a piece, I would probably have spent $40 in the last two seasons. As it stands now, I've spent $0.00.

They are truly missing their audience I think. Yes, people do purchase. But when an item is literally $7-10, fuck that noise. 

Make every single item $1. I contend they would sell 10x as much stuff. If they'd actually  use the psychology of checkout lane purchase decisions to their advantage, they'd easily snag more interest."

I guess maybe after 3 years of loot I kind of want to stop having to justify ""should I keep this near God roll austringer because it's better for pvp over this near God roll over version?
