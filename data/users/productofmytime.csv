bulletjournal,ff7l1tl,t3_es3che,1579652084.0,This is so pretty. I want this pattern on a pretty bowl or a tea towel or something.
Longmont,ff6vf10,t1_ff6sn2p,1579635683.0,"I clarified and yet you're still inviting me to move elsewhere. The elsewhere that I am from btw is Broomfield. Not any of those others you listed. 

And as for other places to live, I have looked, *very* extensively. VT, NC, IA, IN, IL, UT, MT, WI and MN. I've house hunted in person in each of these states over the past year and didn't find anything compelling enough about any of them to make the move from CO. It's been very eye opening about why so many people want to live here."
Longmont,ff6hg2z,t1_ff697r4,1579627279.0,"I don't have a problem overall with Longmont. I like the smaller city feeling, with the one exception about the Asian/Indian market. I should have phrased it differently. That is how I've seen others describe it here, significantly less than their expectations, based on what so and so told them, that got them to move here."
Longmont,ff5frgt,t1_ff5eewe,1579590932.0,"It's uniquely Japanese, and not associated with a seasonal event like King Cakes are with Mardi Gras. Bakeries like the one at whole foods probably make holiday specific things because they can do them in small batches for a very limited time. There isn't enough call for unique international foodstuffs here, if there were maybe I wouldn't have to drive an hour round trip to get ingredients for Indian cooking. 

I'm just tired of seeing posts like these that imply that someone has moved here without much knowledge of where they've chosen to live, and then *some* of those people go on to complain. As if they were lured here under false pretenses that this is some kind of cosmopolitan oasis or something with amenities like they used to enjoy back in Texas or California. Not saying that you're necessarily one of them.. your post is just another in a long stream along the same theme."
Longmont,ff4fupp,t1_ff4evsm,1579562607.0,"A movie theater that struggles to get access to many films, and that feels more like a discount theater than almost every other theater within a 30 min radius.

And yes, the bookstores here are much more preferable to me than a Barnes and Noble would be.. but the lack of one is just one more indication of the lack of ""amenities"" in this fast growing but smaller-town-feeling (in a bad way) city."
Longmont,ff42j4p,t3_erj6u6,1579554135.0,"At this point I wonder very much if we are being trolled with these cake posts. 

Longmont doesn't have an Asian grocery, a Barnes and Noble, a decent movie theater, or a lot of other things besides. Why on earth would anyone think they could find a place in this city to purchase *very* *niche* fresh baked goods??

If you want something that you're more likely to find in Boulder or Denver, post in their respective subs."
bulletjournal,ff3izam,t1_ff3g68g,1579542055.0,"Agreed, except that most standard writing implements still ghost through the pages of the leuchtturm. I used LePens in my last Leuchtturm and they ghosted like crazy.. and a year later all of the ghosting now looks green!"
bulletjournal,ff3inu0,t1_ff38few,1579541858.0,"Another vote for the SeQeS.

160 gsm, no ghosting whatsoever, and MUCH cheaper than Archer & Olive (especially since it also has a lot more pages!)"

unpopularopinion,feksci4,t1_fejn9vi,1579206593.0,"The popularity of goldens makes the effect even more pronounced. Maybe if I saw nothing but pitbulls on my feed I'd say the same about them eventually. 

But no.. not even close actually. Even the most generic looking pitbull has more distinction and personality in its appearance than any golden out there."

AskWomen,fej4cnn,t3_epd46j,1579156423.0,"I've always remembered the compliment that one of my university professors gave me once. She said I always looked very ""put together."" I prefer that compliment to most others because it reflects that the other person notices your effort, and it's not dependent at all on beauty or fashion trends."

atheism,fd5hokm,t1_fd4khlw,1578177769.0,"Over my entire membership in the church? Tens of thousands of dollars.

atheism,fd3rq8g,t1_fd3hy7w,1578161088.0,"Fast and Testimony meeting is not community oriented. It's open mic hour where members of the congregation get the chance to speak. Some talk about their own struggles or the struggles of those people in their immediate circle. Some talk about their own privilege. Always it is framed in a way to ""strengthen faith."" I attended these meetings for 28 years in congregations all over the world and never saw anyone talk about or request participation in events that benefitted the wider (not just LDS) community. Not once. 

Announcements of any kind have been eliminated from Sacrament meetings church-wide, and that change came at least a decade ago. 

In RS and Priesthood meetings the classes are always about church doctrine and policy, and if a discussion arises about helping someone in need, their ""worthiness"" for the aid is informally discussed by the group. 

In my 28 years of very active participation, there weren't as many service projects as you imply. The majority of them were during my Primary and YW years. A few as a YSA. Only two or three a year as an adult. I'm not including serving in teaching or leadership callings or doing temple work, which are the two things that LDS adults are pressured to spend the most time on. 10+ hours per week every week of my life as a TBM. 

Mormons prefer to give thoughts and prayers and tithing donations because in their minds it leaves the decision about whether or not the recipient deserves or is ""worthy of"" the aid up to their god. They don't want blessings to go to the unworthy."

antinatalism,fctcheu,t3_eieejg,1577938956.0,I'm an exmormon and spoke with my Mormon family about this very subject just a couple of hours ago. It's disturbing to me that they think their religious beliefs trump every other consideration.
OrganizationPorn,fcqs72v,t1_fcpm21u,1577891379.0,"I'm struggling to understand what you want me to learn from your comment. People will be less likely to show off and seek praise if their efforts aren't so praiseworthy? You think that lowering the bar for what defines good dietary health, and the bar for what defines actual organization are both good things to do?  Because that would be... inclusive?? Or something?"
OrganizationPorn,fcp36lv,t1_fco4dzk,1577849059.0,"Multiple plentiful varieties of pasta, bread crumbs, a huge bin of AP flour, a huge sack of potatoes, oatmeal, shake n bake, processed rice mixes, manwich, pudding cups, jif PB, more than 5 boxes of ultra sugary breakfast cereal, multiple bins of supplies for baking sweets.... Yikes. 

Eating like this regularly is a really good recipe for diabetes, inflammatory issues, messed up blood pressure, and eventual heart disease and Alzheimer's (type 3 diabetes) too."
OrganizationPorn,fcp2lyw,t1_fcopkog,1577848559.0,"Upon further investigation, this isn't even particularly well organized. Dry goods are mixed in with wet, baking mixes are separate from baking ingredients, etc. Organization doesn't just mean things putting some things in bins and stacking others. 

Also, you can't eat healthfully if you're using processed mixes, which are here in abundance. I'm curious what the owner of this pantry thinks is healthful eating. It'd have to be virtually all vegetables all the time, exclusively to balance out eating from this pantry stock just once a day."

Just because one has the space doesn't mean it needs to be filled, and especially not with totally empty calories. If I had this space it would be used for canned and beans and vegetables, linens, small appliances, and cleaning supplies."
