atheism,fdh8jl7,t1_fdh1k3n,1578417705.0,"Belief exists in the absence of knowledge and certainty, similar to how darkness is just the absence of light. One doesn't believe in science, but observes its truth for themselves, which fills the vacancy of faith."
AdviceAnimals,fdh3c5f,t1_fdg2pd1,1578414487.0,"I have a running theory that nobody reads anything. This is from the stand point of designing UI for software, but I find it often spills over into everyday life. Mispronouncing common names is an example."
todayilearned,fdh1pc0,t1_fdh0uyg,1578413466.0,"Nope, the universe is cold and uncaring. She's happily married to some other dude now, and he owns a farming supply outfit, which is performing very well.

And my dad is also doing quite well in healthcare management, so it all worked out I suppose."
todayilearned,fdgzoxh,t1_fdgwkk0,1578412188.0,My dad had to liquidate and close his very successful accounting practice because his wife cheated on him then divorced him. She took 67% of the cash the business was worth and split. Dad never did re open it.
AdviceAnimals,fdfal6b,t1_fdf6qf9,1578357179.0,"Making you accrue your time before you get PTO isn't really about the money - they can deduct it from your final cheque if you leave. It's more about making you ""put in your time"" or some other kind of business hazing. Doesn't serve a functional purpose except for fucking you if you happen to get the flu sometime in your first year.

Even worse is when you can't use any time accrued until your first year. That's just retarded, because they'd have to pay it out to you if you quit anyway."

pics,fcwc0o2,t1_fcvxnpt,1578021906.0,"I would say (as a personal, unsourced opinion) that age doesn't preclude wisdom, but it is less common to find there. Likewise, surviving additional revolutions around the sun doesn't intrinsically bestow critical thinking and decision making abilities. There are plenty of brilliant, young individuals with the capability to be excellent leaders if given the chance (we'll see if the Finnish PM ends up being one of them). Likewise, there are very clear cases of older people in leading positions who are vastly unqualified."
pics,fcvw35o,t1_fcvtyx0,1578011410.0,"Governments are run on systems of reliance. No one person can be competent - let alone good at - all the requirements of their office. They will likely have a small handful of useful skills, and rely on others with different skill sets to make the job work. This doesn't change based on age. Life experience contributes, but the number of competencies someone has doesn't increase drastically with a few more years under your belt. Best case is you have a better understanding of what you don't do well, and play to your strengths. 

A good low level example of this is simply looking at most upper management roles, or professionals like lawyers or accountants. Many will employ an aid, assistant, receptionist, additional warm body of some sort to handle the minutiae of their jobs. It's required for the job they do, but they either don't have the time or the auxillary skill sets required to do them.

TL;DR, younger people with sufficient skill sets are just as effective as someone older with similar skill sets. Everyone relies on other people to fill in the gaps."
todayilearned,fcipdzb,t1_fci41xu,1577666677.0,"Fair enough, but it's not like nature goes ""Well shit, we forgot to put cats on Madagascar. We have quotas to hit! Ehhh, mongoose are close enough."" Feline traits are advantageous in this case, so they stuck. It could have just as easily been social bonds and pack hunting or something. This happens regardless of what other critters happen to be around with similar traits."
GifRecipes,fbyauyc,t1_fby68xl,1577212315.0,You want those lactose enzymes (lactase) if you're lactose intolerant. The lactose sugar is broken down by those enzymes so you can eat it without becoming the world's grossest fountain!
