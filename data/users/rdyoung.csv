explainlikeimfive,ffiqylg,t1_ffip38v,1579980510.0,"None of this is from random blogs. Fat and salt being good for you and carbs being not has been known for millennia, in the early 1900s there was a push to sell more wheat and wheat based food like bread so bad information about it being healthy was pushed to the masses and became what we know as healthy. The tide is finally turning but it's slow going. Plenty of health professionals still believe that carbs are good and essential when they are not.

Just because something is in a textbook does not mean it's correct or still applicable. The only difference between carbs vs fat/protein and any other subject where we learn more and realize that what we currently know is wrong is the fact that carbs were pushed on the masses by an industry that lobbied for it. Science has always known what carbs and sugar do to the human body and that its not healthy at all."
explainlikeimfive,ffinzag,t1_ffihf7z,1579978441.0,"Not true. Reducing carb intake will definitely help with t2, it reduces blood sugar levels and that will reduce the need for insulin. If you increase your protein intake the body will turn that protein into glucose via gluconeogenesis. That same process will also turn fat into glucose as it's needed. The body most definitely does not need a high intake of carbs. I should also note that carbs have been linked to inflammation that causes a slew of issues that go away when intake is reduced. 

Have a read.

There is a lot of bad information that medical professionals still tell their patients. A lot are still stuck on the old way of thinking that carbs are good and fat is bad, it's actually the opposite. That pdf you linked is a good example. It talks about low salt and fat intake as healthy, it's NOT. The human body needs salt, it's one of many electrolytes that are essential. We also need fat, men especially as it's one of the building blocks of testosterone, low levels of which cause all kinds of issues."

If you go low carb, keto, etc. The protein you consume will be turned into glucose as your body needs it. The body and brain prefer carbs, sugar, etc because it's easier to metabolize and extract energy from.

Do I think this is the best way forward for rideshare? No. But, this is a needed step that will either kill the incumbents and let a new player take over OR it will force them to make drivers employees and pay them hourly.

What will likely happen is drivers will be able to set a rate that they feel their time is worth. If they can't get enough rides at that rate they will either drop their rate down but not lower than ubers floor OR they will stop driving and find another job. 

While I would be happier to see a real bidding system and not one being partially controlled by uber, this is a step in the right direction.

There is also taco bell. They spent a lot of time and research/testing to find the right price point. When they priced them cheap but still profitable they didn't sell as well as when they were priced higher. Same goes for things like rent, I learned this first hand. Was renting a room out for a long time, when I had it priced low to try and help those who were hurting financially and maybe trying to rebuild I got shit for roommates, when I jacked the price up to higher than market I got a much better selection of people applying to rent the room.

The abstract from the study you linked. It most definitely does not support your initial assertion nor what cosmo had to say about it.

>The study purpose was to assess, in a U.S. probability sample of women, experiences related to orgasm, sexual pleasure, and genital touching. In June 2015, 1,055 women ages 18 to 94 from the nationally representative GfK KnowledgePanel® completed a confidential, Internet-based survey. While 18.4% of women reported that intercourse alone was sufficient for orgasm, 36.6% reported clitoral stimulation was necessary for orgasm during intercourse, and an additional 36% indicated that, while clitoral stimulation was not needed, their orgasms feel better if their clitoris is stimulated during intercourse. Women reported diverse preferences for genital touch location, pressure, shape, and pattern. Clinical, therapeutic, and educational implications are discussed

We use one every so often, usually when she is riding me so she can focus on herself.

As for the vibrator and being one and done, a lot of it is mental. It took some time for to be able to handle touching her clit after she came but now that she is used to it for the most part I can get her off multiple times back2back. I do have to back off from direct stimulation on the clit and I focus on the underside of the clit, her labia, thighs, etc and keep going back to the clit to see when she is ready to go again."
AskRedditAfterDark,feit0u3,t1_feip18m,1579146447.0,Cosmo is recognized as a giant joke all around the world. They routinely make things up and even recycle articles every few years. The fact that you think cosmo is reliable tells me a lot.
AskRedditAfterDark,feiqxei,t1_feipr5c,1579144968.0,"Which are you asserting?

Can't ever?

Or

Can't consistently?

You need to pick a goal post and stick to it. 

It is likely true that 75% of women can't ***consistently*** achieve orgasm through penetration alone. It is also likely true that 5% can do it consistently.

I also ask why it has to be mutual masturbation instead of you focusing on her and the piv? Our typical routine is that I get her off a few times with my fingers maybe a few more times orally and then we fuck. Sometimes I focus on getting her off a few more times with me inside her but sometimes she is content with me focusing on getting myself off. We typically end up with her getting herself off one more time after I cum because it gets her worked up again."

My GF comes fairly easily from piv, it takes her clit grinding on me along with me hitting her gspot. It did take her some time to figure out how but once she had it down it's easy."
