traumaticchildhood,ff90u44,t3_es2fy6,1579701986.0,"If you're in an intimate relationship then touch will inevitably come up. If you can not be touched you do need to tell him that it's not hos fault. He may assume that you are repulsed by him and be hurt. You might not have to share all of the details with him, but you need to both express what your expectations of the relationship are because they may not be the same. You may have expectations of pure devotion without anything else, and he may simultaneously be trying to earn the right to have your trust, and will likely blame himself when it doesn't work out towards his expectations."

depression,ff0fidz,t3_eqs4h8,1579468384.0,"That's because you think being better is being happy.

Happiness isnt the opposite of depression.

Being able to feel things... All emotions... Is the opposite of depression.

I found out shitty news and expected to cry or feel adrenaline or whatever. I didn't. I haven't cried. I know I probably should cry about this, but my brain isn't creating the chemicals to cry because it says, fuck that I'm too tired to shit out some chemicals rn. Fuck off.


So be thankful when you get tears. Be thankful when your heartrate goes up. Be thankful for the emotions you feel.

Animals get depression. But animals that aren't depressed aren't always super smiley or hyperactive. They just are. They just can go about their day doing thwir business. Depressed animals, like those caged in shelters, have a hard time eating, etc.

We live in a society that's like an animal shelter. We have our basic needs met, but we're not free. We don't get enough love or whatever else.... Animals taken out of a shelter get back to themselves, but that just means doing normal things."

NoStupidQuestions,fejrtdu,t1_fejreg0,1579184264.0,"True. But my statement stands even with non- instant mac.

Why would anyone freeze a block of noodles in general?

It's a lot of extra trouble to spread it thin on a cookie sheet so it doesn't turn into a giant brick. Then you have to remember the cookie sheet before it absorbs the flavor of the freezer and scrape the lil noodles quickly into a gallon ziplock bag.

Most of the time when you freeze pasta dishes you freeze the sauce separate in ice cube form and freeze the noodles al dente.

If you don't do it this way it tastes weird or falls apart.

Still seems like way more trouble than necessary for old milk Mac."

Also when someone close passes away we feel they're not really gone for a very long time.

Something that might bring full circle grieving in the future might be like when you have kids of your own or get married or a big event you'd think she would be at. The times you realize loss will be when things hit you the hardest.

It will be ok eventually. It's a strange time now. There's no wrong way."

Vent,fdecis5,t3_ekwtud,1578336036.0,"I am so very sorry for the state of our mental health stigmas in this country. Only you can make the choices of who you speak to, but I think that you can anonymously reach out to crisis hotlines. I've heard that the texting lines are better. You might be able to even download a Google phone number that's anonymous to do so.

That being said, you will most likely benefit from therapy sooner rather than later. It also depends on your triggers. If you are grieving something specific that can be the focus of a session.

The military actually breaks minds moreso. I know this is a goal of yours to be a fighter pilot but if you don't get help, then you join the military, you'll be facing a lot more pressure. It's not the right fit for everyone. I suggest talking to veterans with PTSD before signing a contract."

gardening,fcmj7xc,t1_fcmhwcu,1577777481.0,"Here is a direct quote from Reddit from an expert on poppy seed tea:

“Poppy tea consumption can be lethal. It has already killed people. Consuming poppy tea is essentially a crude method to ingest morphine, codeine, thebaine, oripavine, papaverine, noscapine, and another ~45 additional alkaloids present on the surface of seeds contaminated with poppy latex during harvesting.

Depending on your personal metabolism, it can take up to 8 hours before full effects are noticeable, and can last for well over 24 hours. The quantity and ratio of alkaloids remain largely unquantified, with 6000-fold differences documented from the same plant material between different batches.

The potential for a 6000-fold difference makes consuming poppy tea inherently dangerous; even experienced users may get an unexpectedly strong batch, overdose and die."
