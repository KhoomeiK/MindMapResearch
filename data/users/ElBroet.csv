todayilearned,fgarvbs,t1_fgalg7u,1580654692.0,"One thing on those data tables is that they are often misinterpreted.  It didn't mean that most people just died around 40,  that was the life expectancy of \*infants\*, brought down heavily by the high infant mortality rate. If you made it out of childhood, for instance, the life expectancy is around 60 years old (still lower than now of course,  but its important to note because that means that likewise most people aren't dying at 38,  because as it is by the time they get there their life expectancy is already up to around \~65, and you might say 'well, maybe then most die off before that' but even at the beginning of adulthood, its around \~60, meaning adults are flat out expected to live into their 60s, and that the deaths we're expecting bringing that number down must come before that)  
(Also, as for source, excuse me as this:  [https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc284/line\_chart2/index.html?initialWidth=700&childId=a04-4a73-a9fc-0117fdcf2b96&parentTitle=How%20has%20life%20expectancy%20changed%20over%20time%3F%20-%20Office%20for%20National%20Statistics&parentUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ons.gov.uk%2Fpeoplepopulationandcommunity%2Fbirthsdeathsandmarriages%2Flifeexpectancies%2Farticles%2Fhowhaslifeexpectancychangedovertime%2F2015-09-09](https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc284/line_chart2/index.html?initialWidth=700&childId=a04-4a73-a9fc-0117fdcf2b96&parentTitle=How%20has%20life%20expectancy%20changed%20over%20time%3F%20-%20Office%20for%20National%20Statistics&parentUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ons.gov.uk%2Fpeoplepopulationandcommunity%2Fbirthsdeathsandmarriages%2Flifeexpectancies%2Farticles%2Fhowhaslifeexpectancychangedovertime%2F2015-09-09)   is actually a table from England around that time,  but the last I remember seeing of America was about the same \[and you can even see here it already matches closely to what we know from the other table;  infant expectation is around 40, and is now 80\]. I'll try to find one of the proper American ones, I have one right now I'm looking through but I have to find the proper data, as its a full report)  


I'll also add that even in a hypothetical world where people did just die in their 40s,  I still don't think she'd really be considered an 'old woman' -- old people would still be the old ones, just rarer.   But I don't know if you were saying otherwise anyways ahahah as much as just pointing out that 'with crazy numbers like that, in a way she was an old woman'"

news,ffzx0wb,t1_ffzhwcg,1580395085.0,"Oh there's definitely a law. Quick question, who here knows what a Chicago sunroof is?

Anybody? You sir? No? Well back home, there was this guy named Chet. Chet was a real asshole. He might have owed me some money, he might have slept with my wife before she became my ex-wife. The details don’t matter. Suffice to say I was wronged.

Alright, so one summer evening, I was out having a few drinks. Or two, maybe three. You get the picture. And, uh, who do I see? Chet! He drove up and he double-parked outside of Dairy Queen. He went in to get some soft-serve. Now Chet drove, and just to give you an idea of what kind of a douchebag he was, Chet drove a white ‘97 pearlescent BMW series. With white leather interior. So I saw that thing, and I’d had a few like I said. And, uh, I climbed up top, and I may have, uh… defecated through the sunroof. Not my finest hour, I’ll grant you that. But that’s what a Chicago sunroof is, now you know! It’s a real thing, I didn’t make it up, I’m not the first person to do it, there’s a name for it. Guy wanted some soft serve? I gave him some soft serve. I did not know that his children were in the back seat. There was a level of tint on the windows that I’ll maintain to this day was not legal in an Illinois-licensed vehicle. But somehow that’s on me, I guess. Who leaves two Cub Scouts in a double-parked car with the engine running? Come on! Well Chet was connected, you see, like, uh, Cicero connected. So usually I’d be looking at malicious mischief, public intoxication, disorderly conduct, maybe. But he’s got the DA saying indecent exposure. Calling me a sex offender, what?! One little Chicago sunroof and suddenly I’m Charles Manson?! And that’s where it all went off the rails! I’ve been paying for it ever since."
