MadeInAbyss,ffbqst9,t1_ffbptgf,1579779011.0,"Arguably, if I were the inventor that made Reg, I'd have installed a device that allowed him to condense whatever the curse is, and store it within some sort of reservoir for later discharging/purging, or conversion to some form of usable energy.

But I doubt that's the case.  Or even possible."
cats,ff21rca,t3_er0kyu,1579491467.0,"I was not expecting this.  I was expecting freaking out, but that kitten really wanted to be up close to you."
dndmemes,fe8a4rg,t1_fe7pfhg,1578924113.0,"They probably paid for it by having to spend several hours trying to catch it without getting (more) injured, shortly after this picture was taken and it jumped out of the hand.  But yeah.  Sucks to be the hamster when they do take the tape off."
blackcats,fe88k68,t3_envl22,1578923731.0,"Bright, well-lit room.  Or just accept the void-with-eyes appearance.  In any case this picture was well-done."
cats,fe5sa6r,t1_fe5l0ew,1578873844.0,"My guy mostly started showing his age in his last year of life.  But up until that point, he was relatively small, and his fur stayed nice and kitten soft for his entire life.  He also had some odd quirks.  One eye going all brown(It was fine), fur on the tip of the tail that never grew back, quiet for the first 10 years of his life, then all of a sudden raspy meowing."
cats,fe5js3j,t3_enojwz,1578870351.0,"Yep.  Had a stunted-growth cat of my own, lived to 18.  His growth was presumably stunted due to the conditions we found him in.  Someone abandoned him out in the middle of a snow-covered field in the middle of a Canadian winter.  By the time my parents got to him, his fur had started freezing and falling off.

Did yours by chance not meow for the longest time, and then one day just up and start emitting a really, really raspy meow?"
