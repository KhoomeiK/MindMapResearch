I'm gonna play one of them (Little Nightmares) using my controller as it looks like it's better than using the keyboard. I really want to finish my video games when I leave college this year as I want to improve my skills in playing. I'm not aiming to be the best but I still want to be better than what my current level is.

I also got a couple of Stephen King books such as Doctor Sleep and Mr Mercedes, which I saw in the cinema and on the telly respectively.

One time she drove into a lamppost close to her home, and if I remember correctly she‚Äôs probably been done a few times for reckless driving. However, she‚Äôs gotten off it because she and her husband are friends with the commissioner.
