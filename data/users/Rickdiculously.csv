raisedbynarcissists,fgizxye,t1_fgi8x1l,1580834346.0,"Yeah. As an 18yo I talked back to my dad one day, next thing I knew I was on the floor, getting kicked in the ribs.i was totally shocked. My dad wasn't violent. He was all into the mind torture. Interrogation until you cry, lies, gaslight ING, empty promises, stealing, all that. But physical abuse was usually my step mom's jam (she was a lawyer BTW..) 

Anyway, said step mom jumped in between my dad and I and said, I shit you not, ""stop! You can't leave a trace or if she goes to the police they could take the kids away!"" they had 3 kids together, much younger than me.

I was completely shocked, and bitter, and soon after ran away from home... But I do regret not calling CPS on them. First off because it would probably have been a favour to my siblings, and second out of pure revenge. My household was the true narc deal. Everyone socially related to us thought we were the perfect suburban home, with loving parents, lots of happy, well provided for children, and when I came clean, some family members downright doubted me and were incredulous, saying they couldn't believe my father to be capable of half the shit he rejoiced in.

I should have done it if not to save myself (long scarred beyond repair), but to destroy their heinous little nest of comfort from which they wrought their abuse."
aww,fgef57m,t1_fge5jw0,1580698133.0,"Hah! And in the meantime when a pipistrelle flew in my flat, my chubby monster of a cat did a jump so high and crazy, I'd never seen the like before, caught the poor thing, and I had to pry it off his Jaws. Surprisingly unharmed. I put it in a box, sideways, on my balcony. It flew off soon enough. It wasn't even hurt that I could tell.

There is no rabies in France but fuck me what else was I supposed to do? Let my cat kill an endangered species in my bedroom?"

A shell... Heck, you can have your jaw shorn off, your eyes popped out of the sockets, and your innards splattered about and you may still take hours or days to die. Plus the time it takes you to die you're all alone in the mud being scared and screaming for your mom.

I'd pick the wolves. You're like ""heck yeah, killed by wolves"", and you're fighting and screaming the whole time. Then suddenly it's over."

suggestmeabook,fga1mms,t1_fg999pg,1580645704.0,"I'd say so as well. It definitely has a slow and confusing start, which you'll probably understand and appreciate more later on. But things do pick up and become more of a format one is used to."

suggestmeabook,fga17r4,t1_fg9lejk,1580645608.0,"My fav is the Chrysalids! Wyndham is fantastic! He has a very unique prose that feels old, yet he managed to make his stories impressively timeless.

I'd say the main way you can see it's dated, is that some of his work is a bit passive. Main events can happen off screen and be just related back from character A to B, etc. That's the case with midwhich cuckoos. His more action driven ones are seriously good. He reminds me of Shirley Jackson at times."
suggestmeabook,fga0uul,t1_fg9laxw,1580645459.0,Totally. A super easy read. I was so sad when I got Artemis and found it really bad. Martian remains a work of genius.

I genuinely cannot put up with his work. I find it boring and the weird element comes across as forced to the point of pretentiousness. But he has good ideas... Just a shame I can't cope with how he packages them.

I loved the Annihilation film though."
suggestmeabook,fga0e7x,t1_fg9as9b,1580645260.0,"If you like the sci-fi in a fantasy world element, I can recommend Vernor Vinge, ""A Fire Upon The Deep"". It's one of the greatest sci-fi masterworks I've read. It has fantastic aliens, a high stakes plot, great concept, and a whole storyline following two kids being taken from their crashed shuttle by multi-mind-puppies-aliens to be leveraged in a political struggle wracking their world.

Also, Sherri S. Tepper, ""Grass"" and the subsequent ""Raising the Stones"". She's a feminist and does a fantastic job at sneaking change under your nose. I felt like a hypnotised snake the whole time."
suggestmeabook,fg9zdqv,t1_fg94rdh,1580644985.0,"Yeah. And then I liked it so much I was afraid Fsll of Hyperion would disappoint me and I took a year to get around to it.

Major mistake. In the end that's where all the big hitting ideas are at. Recommend it as a duology."
Fantasy,fg9z6uh,t1_fg88mcy,1580644905.0,"Yes, agree. BUT, I feel like the author still failed to convey this properly. I also disliked the second half because I felt like Kuang needed stuff to happen, and thrust and squeezed her character in it, and didn't do as good a job with Rin anymore. I definitely felt like I could csee what she was trying to do"" and yet how she failed to make me care or feel invested. I became more and more detached from Rin. I actually dropped the book before the end. Had to force myself to return to it to speed read to the end. Still no desire to continue.

So while I agree with your analysis, I can also see where op is coming from."
raisedbynarcissists,fg9u4q9,t1_fg7yb5s,1580643229.0,"Yeah. You're not alone in there. I'm an avid reader, always have been, which is the main thing I thank for my running away from home and going full NC as early as I did. I got through it a lot more exposure to how abnormal a family dynamic it is. But I still thought it was normal to live with the stress levels I had. Never questioned if I should see someone about it when I was doing panic attacks in the street and felt unable to sleep for fear of dying in my bed (as a totally healthy 18yo). No matter how freed you think you are, it takes some serious work of introspection to seize the extend of the damage they did to us."

They are mostly unfit for it and aren't professional in their dealing with staff. I know one or two who definitely enjoy a little power trip, most of the others just lack enough empathy to understand why that's scary or a problem. This is also the least of our problems at work, so I'm not even willing to bring that up to them... They'd nod, act sympathethic and forget it all in a minute."

Only then, do I press the buttons on the till.

Very seriously though, my comment was a bit tongue in cheek, but your makes the situation seem even bleaker : you'd think a company that has to lose so much time and money over the hiring process would then proceed to care for the staff. Its really depressing."
raisedbynarcissists,fg7vrrm,t1_fg7d672,1580602708.0,"I never pick up the phone either... I also tend to panic when my managers come to my floor and go 'come over here, need to talk'. Like, I don't even fucking mind losing my job, and I'm a bloody top employee, I've got no reason to worry about being taken aside, and never had. It's always to talk about an upcoming event or catch up on some unfolding projects, etc.

And yet my blood always runs cold. Like a jacked up version of the ""we need to talk"" of relationships, and I get it with everyone."
science,fg7v74o,t1_fg7n9qb,1580602279.0,"No, the latter is more subdivided. You guys are forgetting the managers who think they're great, run a great ship, and are totally shocked and hurt when a big staff exodus happens and everyone is scathing in their departure reviews."

suggestmeabook,fg7ep17,t3_ex6pci,1580590687.0,"No one recommended A Fire Upon The Deep by Vernor Vinge it seems... I waited so long to read it... And was an idiot for that. It has a very smart underlying concept, super cool aliens, space chases, survival on alien medieval worlds... and a literary prose and style despite what I just plugged in.

It's a very sweet scifi book. Bit of a chonk, though not as much as The Terror, so you'd be fine."

You could actually kill them if you committed to it, but because of the mechanics of their immortality, only other immortals could kill them, or someone who could afford to contain them long enough to strap them on to an exploding space rocket. I had fun with them though it was mostly a sort of murder mystery in a post apocalyptic autonomous City. Never finished that wip. I still call it a wip because I like to dream...

If you like that sort of jam though, the federal weird shit intrigue, I recommend you play or watch some playthroughs (if you like that) of Control. It's about a woman with mysterious abilities entering a building in her quest to find her brother... And finding herself not only trapped but chosen as new president of the FBC, the federal bureau of control. Would have been best 2019 game for me if I hadnt played Death Stranding right after.

Fantasy,fg6fpa2,t1_fg59tzp,1580566651.0,"No, it's not hard. You don't have to do anything. Picture this : the president on his first day is taken to a small room by his senior intelligence guys. The ""deep state"" type. They sit him in a chair in front of another person.

The president is confused, asks what's this about.

The person in front of him smiles. They introduce themselves, saying ""lets go with Jay for this new term,"" and compliments the increasingly confused president on a good campaign. Jay turns to one of the intelligence guys and says ""alright, let's cut to the chase"". The CIA guy nods, steps forward, shoots them in the face, point blank.

The president is on his feet, screaming, but find himself unable to leave the room as strong hands force him back down. He's about to bellow for someone to explain wtf is going on, but an officer is already answering, sort of, by pointing across the table, to Jay's remains.

The president looks and indeed something odd is going on : the face, where it was shorn, is frothing. The brain, which had become visible when the skull was blown off, seems to be almost bubbling. Soon it is glistening coils again, a pulsating membrane crawls over it, thick with new veins, and bone extends from the skull's jagged edges, reforming, growing skin in turn. Finally hair bursts forth, growing and growing until their length matches that of the rest.

Jay tips their head back then, their eyes drift, opaque, and slowly come back into focus as the bullet hole on the cheekbone, right under their left eye puckers, the skin stitching itself back together like this was all a dream. But the president's ears are still ringing, there is still blood on the table, and drenching Jay's shirt.

""What..."" but words are pretty meaningless by now.

Jay smiles, licks a finger and rubs at the trail of blood on their cheek.

""I find the conversation goes easier when we're past the theatrics. You've yelled, I've shown off my... skills, and we can move on, talk business.""

They steeple their fingers, lean forward on the metal table.

""You're a smart one though, for a change, so let me simply forward that yes, stuffing me in a barrel would work. I would not die, and I also would not be able to get to you. But my... friends—my colleagues, let's say— they would get to your staff. Starting with their youngest children, their pets. Make their way up the emotional ladder until I'm back in one piece, free. Of course the last time that happened, the presidency had to be terminated a little early. Set an example, all that. Very tedious. It creates a lot of top secret paperwork—"" they wave a hand, and a CIA agent steps forward to put a heavy folder on the table. The president looks up and sees it's a young woman, green around the gills. A new recruit being broken in on the secret too, he assumes. Or maybe she's never gotten used to seeing someone regrow their mushy brains from the inside out.

""Of course,"" Jay goes on, ""we realise you people need to have at least the illusion of free will, and we have no desire to micro manage every last detail of your cumbersome institutions. So we'll be in touch, and you'll do your best to follow instructions. And in that way, we shall have a fruitful cohabitation. What do you say? ""

The president nods, remembering to close his gaping mouth just in time to look half dignified, and Jay's face is stretched by a big smile. It would have been a warm one too, if it had not looked so predatorial.

TwoXChromosomes,fg65w1g,t1_fg5ziva,1580555263.0,"Yeah I mean, one of my best pals I lived with in recent years (when we were live in staff in a big European hostel) was from a strict Muslim background, and he did all the pork and all the booze and all the haram chasing of ladies. He was a basic French guy. His dad had converted, his mom was the one who was from an Islamic background. Our running joke was that if he annoyed me at all, I'd say ""alright, I'm calling your mom!"" he knew that'd be the end of him, so he would give me some pretty dramatic puppy eyes. It was fun. 

Seriously though. Muslims live in a lot of countries with a lot of cultures, and Islam is like Christianity, it bends and shapes itself according to local tradition. As an (atheist) raised roman Catholic, I see Mormons/latter day saints, pentecostals and other freaky tele evengicals as a bunch of fucking weirdos. Can't guess how they got there from the same book. Same goes with Muslims. Some will shake women's hands, some will go out and drink a little wine, some will seem just like you in any respect until they take a big sigh and say they should at least try to be good with Ramadan this year... And others will go around decked in foreign garb and refuse to look women in the eye."
TwoXChromosomes,fg656vg,t1_fg5p5rp,1580554214.0,"I bet that also is galling to a male nurse.

Once the confrontation is over, you may lick your wounds, but you don't freak out over them. That's from my personal experience. No one has hit me in years, and if it happened tomorrow I'd have a much stronger reaction than back when I was a kid and could get some pretty casual violence any other day. I don't know how much we can read into it tbh. I feel like both our interpretations are valid given how few clues we get beyond the obvious harm received and the dialogue.

I don't think he really freaks out from being hit. First off that happens afterwards, in the cool down period, and second when he gets riled up it's always while protecting or helping someone else.

When you realise she's behind the deaths and transformations that have been bothering our heroes, it also becomes apparent she's doi g this to find a cure for her dying lover. What's 20 dead if it means her lover lives forever? Bad, but relatable.

But in my case it's easier because my setting is a weird futuristic urban one. Technology can be any state I want.

BTW, have you considered sticking to a terraformed Mars? It could be just as remote if people lost the ability to travel. They could see blue earth rise and fall in the sky, and be stuck on Mars where things slowly revert and crumple as technology fades? You could have red desert eating up pastures and seas becoming too acidified for life? Does that sound too madmax? XD"
scifiwriting,ffvjhrt,t1_ffvej4j,1580265579.0,"Why does having better tech need to equate with destroying ourselves? You're the real god here, nothing is stopping you from writing a positive sci-fi where people are mostly nice and past conflict.

It would depend on the past of your people, and their current culture. Space based sf doesn't have to be grim, Chambers proved that.

Now though, if you want to limit technology, I don't think a highly irradiated iceball like Europa is the setting you want. Underwater habitat though, are defo a great way to limit the tech of your people, because it's so resource scarce. Maybe they recycle and use 3D printers, but maybe they're slowly losing both material and knowledge, and there are no resupplies coming and ships and communications also stopped. They're stranded, with maintaining the habitats being the best use of their technology. Maybe recent ""inventions"" destroyed an entire bubble and people are getting a bit technophobic, sticking to what they feel is safe?"

Mind you there is a manga I like which is about a (mentally deranged level) stalker, who is so obsessed with a former senpai, she keeps pictures of him, but also the skins of his straws from fast food, any towel he touched, etc etc. She still is an interesting character in a pretty compelling world, but her actions aren't depicted as healthy.

There is also zero swearing or naughty words. He's the perfect entry to SFF for young readers, even when the content gets gark (and it does at times).

Honestly, if you want to grasp what the hype is about without committing to his mammoth series with marvel-universe-like level of planning and interconnection, just grab ""the emperor's soul"". It's a novelette, really tiny, yet one of his best works imo. Quite emotional in places."

I also meet countless deep SFF nerds who are huge fans of the guy. I started reading Sanderson at 24 after a very hard to digest book that kinda traumatised me (the collector by Fowles). I loved the first mistborn so much... I'd not been this excited for a book in a year at least. Then I hated the second and third so much I stayed off Sanderson for a whole year. Eventually listened to my friends and gave him a chance with his standalones. Elantris, which I find mediocre, and Warbreaker, which I really enjoyed, and really mended my relationship with Sanderson.

While I actively recommend him, I'm well aware he isn't some writing god. His prose is incredibly non descript, his humour pretty childish, and his mormonism peaks out often enough.

But he's also reliably productive, writes a mean twist every time, creates cool worlds to lose yourself into. Being a fan of his is great and *easy*, and a lot of SFF fans think so too, meaning he's top of the recommendation lists just as easily."

You can't give the kids back to him, he's an abuser. So in that case, it makes sense he at the very least helps to care financially for his children.

Then you have cases like my dad. Charismatic fucker won the rights to me, got my mother in court as often as he could. Near ruined her. She wants holiday rights? Gotta ask in court etc. My mom never cheated on him, she just tried to leave him when she realised he was a violent, manipulative nut job. She tried legally to have me back and failed.
