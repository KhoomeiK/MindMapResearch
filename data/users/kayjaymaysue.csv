Teaching him to sit up like that was surprisingly easy! We started with just luring him up and rewarding for lifting his front paws up for a second and worked up to longer duration. We had to help him balance for a while until he figured out how to hold that position. It’s his favorite thing now, he does it all the time to get attention!"
