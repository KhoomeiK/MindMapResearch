findapath,ffic4mz,t3_etk29q,1579970347.0,"Food trucks can be a money sinkhole if you're not in an area that can support one especially something as niche as a vegan truck. I live in the midwest and the two vegan trucks I know of only operate during special events or weekends and as far as I know the owners work full time regular jobs aside from their trucks. If you're as good as you say at cooking maybe you could do a pop-up bistro at a brewery to showcase your skills? I know a few breweries in my town do things like that and they have dedicated nights for specific food trucks. 

Also like another commenter said, cooking as a job is different. Try putting in time as a line cook to get a feel for what you're up against. Or cooking at a vegan eatery. 
If you do pursue this dream I hope you succeed!"

I am type -O and don't regularly donate because the last time I did I passed out the next day and busted my face on the toilet from low blood pressure and a hot shower. When people ask I just ask when they'll make time to go with me to make sure I don't pass out. That usually makes them stop.  Also, the donation centers would rather not put up with you passing out, the liability of you getting hurt while falling or upsetting other donors is not worth it to them."

In Hawaii after the age of 70 or 75 you need to renew your license every year and have your doctor sign an affidavit that you're healthy enough to drive. My friend's dad was 96 and still driving! He was profoundly deaf and going blind but his doctor just signed the paperwork.

legaladvice,ff52j0n,t1_ff4t5bt,1579578468.0,"Do you have homeowner's insurance? Rekeying due to theft is usually covered. You can file a claim on your homeowner's insurance for rekeying the house and for your stolen items. Iirc, most auto policies only cover $250 in stolen property. Some up to $500. Use your homeowners or renter's insurance in tandem to cover your lost valuables, though you may be subject to a deductible.

Edit to add: even if someone had hit you while driving and totaled your car even your own insurance would not throw additional money at you because you had new tires. Tires are routine maintenance."

On top of everything, they smoke in their house so it can't even be donated!"
AmItheAsshole,femx4lm,t1_fekit72,1579271900.0,Exactly. When my mom was trying to have more kids when I was a teenager I told her very bluntly that I would love my siblings but I would not be raising them if something happened to her. I lost my childhood at 8yrs old because she had my little brother and his dad didn't want my mom to leave the bed at night (massive control freak that stayed over 3-4 nights a week and completely ran our house).  They would wake 8 yr old me up at 3am to feed and diaper my brother then I would have to go back to sleep and get up for school. I'm in my 30s and still don't have children because I raised my brother.

Columbus,feic4gk,t1_feh62ow,1579135042.0,Not all the vacant houses in the Hilltop are bank owned. I worked for a small property mgmt company where an owner we managed for had 6 houses and 4 were vacant in the Hilltop. He still paid taxes on them. He also liked to complain about them not being rented. He asked to put section 8 resident in but they weren't up to the standards required without more money invested. So he just whined and let them sit empty. Because his taxes were lower than improving the houses.
Columbus,feibohs,t1_feha0i1,1579134746.0,"I saw a craigslist ad where someone flipped a house in the Hilltop and put in the most basic white cabinetry (max $500), cheap laminate flooring, cheap laminate countertops, and a cheap backsplash. I couldn't tell if it was the peel and stick kind or the actual tile sheets on mesh. There was a basic black apartment sized fridge and an electric stove. They wanted $1400/mo for 2 bedrooms with a den, and 1 bathroom. I can't remember what the address was but it was smack dab in the Hilltop and not near any nice houses. I laughed. People think because they put $1500 bucks into a house they can charge crazy rent. Especially in a neighborhood that is not on the ""up"". These types as well as the luxury apartments are the problem with our skyrocketing rents. Because as soon as someone builds a luxury complex everyone else thinks they can jack up their rent while doing the bare minimum. Or the people keeping things affordable do absolutely nothing."
IdiotsInCars,fehqaca,t1_fegdmky,1579121733.0,Same. Most people would catch it before they pulled out and I would let them stew in gas covered shame while I paged the manager to fill out the insurance forms.

You could write Wizarding Britain at civil war against a move towards a ""safe"" regime which is actually a move toward a totalitarian state by the Ministry.
