AskUK,feb1nq8,t1_fe8ohxu,1578954580.0,"Christ, that's the whole point of your question? You worry you're under tipping??

I'd willingly bet there at least 30% of the UK population who have never tipped in the life. I highly doubt more than 10% tip on any sort of regular basis.

You really do need to lose the US attitude on this one. I've worked hospitality, on pretty much every level. Tipping is nice, but never expected (1 caveat being big parties - 8+, who don't leave anything might be grumbled about by the staff, but nothing too severe)"

If these people are so fucking inept they couldn't figure out how to opt in to the filters provided by the ISPs (or use a 3rd party product), how many others are going to be equally incapable of opting out of the filters, if they are even aware they are being filtered.


Edit: Grammar"

Yep that sounds entirely reasonable and not at all open to abuse."
