Neither are cheap. I know I would never win a fight with him unless I broke a chair over his head or something, but I'll be damned if I  don't stand up for myself and try to protect my property after the way he treated us.

I'm not pressing charges this time, but I am 100% going to if he ever pulls anything like this again. He's an abusive POS and it's about time he faced real life consequences for what he does to the people who love him. That and he has a six month old daughter he doesn't have any business raising bc she doesn't deserve to grow up watching him abuse his family like our father did. If it comes down to her being removed from his home for her own safety and well being, then there needs to be a paper trail of police reports to document his behavior where appropriate.

Edit: Not gonna lie, I'm still pretty fucking pissed more than a week later."
depression,fcj5bva,t1_fc0g7kz,1577677647.0,"Yeah I feel it. Most recently, I met a guy and his bf who had just moved to my town and didn't know anyone outside his bf's graduate program. We hung out a few times and I had fun, and I thought they did too. Then he invited me out with some of his bf's classmates, and he hit it off with someone else. He was clearly more interested in hanging out with this guy than with me, and after that night I never heard from him again, save for a few brief texts we exchanged a few days later."

Now that I have something that relieves the complete lack of motivation and energy and the constant fantasizing about killing myself, everything that's left is just gray because that's the way it actually is."

depression,fcj3yaq,t1_fc2037y,1577676674.0,"I kind of wonder why they recommend it for people who don't respond well to other medications. That makes it sound to me like it's either a superior drug or that it's more effective but has higher risks. My psychiatric NP made it sound like Viibryd and Trintellix were less likely to cause side effects, though. Why not just prescribe the best meds first so the patient doesn't have to try ten combinations of meds before finding something that works?"
