We gave her chemo and it may have added a small amount of time to her life but looking back I regret doing it. The quality of her life for much of that time was very poor. It is a very, very difficult decision to make and is different in every circumstance. I know you are trying to do what is best for your precious pet and I wish you the best. I hope you hear from a variety of people because mine is only one story and it may not apply to you. Take care, and love that precious creature while you can."

arizona,fdirvks,t1_fdhk9gq,1578449652.0,"Cherry-picking the best of Tucson from the post above - the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum is world class and absolutely worth the drive.  Plan at minimum a half a day there and you will not regret it. You can check it out online to get a preview and see if it’s something you’re interested in. 
Pima Air and Space Museum -  If you are an aviation buff then you will really enjoy this otherwise you might want to pass. You might find the guided AMARG tour at Davis Monthan Air Force Base’s boneyard (we’re not supposed to call it that) far more interesting. The only one in the US that you can tour and it is under very strict guidelines. You can check out some images of the boneyard online and see if you think it is of interest.
The San Xavier mission is very beautiful and can be a quick visit. 
You could potentially do all three of these in a day if you started early enough. DM me if you want any more information about Tucson, etc. Have a great trip!"
