Maybe you could help her out by getting her to take a class with you (like art or music, something fun she can do on her own at home as well) if you're in the area, or with a friend if she knows anyone who'd be interested!"
TrollXChromosomes,ffg62hf,t1_ffe28iq,1579899237.0,"For sure! My MIL is dope. She was a stay at home mom for a long time. Now, she is talking about going back to school since her kids are grown/out of the house. She wants to study forensics! Nevermind that she's simultaneously renovating 2 different houses, setting up rentals, and learning Spanish. Moms are awesome, moms are people, and they can do anything any other person can do."
