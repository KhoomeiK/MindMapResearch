She was so scares and still approached us. I don't even know why its hit me so hard but man, i never want to make anyone feel like that."
offmychest,ffvge02,t1_ffvg2z8,1580263498.0,"There's apparently been a few keyed up cars and smashed windows the last few weeks and she thought that's what we were up too.


I did also explain she could've been in a dangerous situation approaching a car full of strangers

She was polish, i dunno if that makes any difference to her attitude. But it scares me to think if we were going to do something horrible she could have been in serious danger."

unpopularopinion,femqnc5,t3_epry71,1579266771.0,"I moved out quite young due to the social pressure of being a male living with his mum.

I've since moved back in due to her falling ill and needing constant care, plus i love my family and enjoy their company immensely. They are my greatest friends.

I still feel ashamed when people find out i live with my mum (im now 26) and quite frankly will be for the foreseeable future.

People assume im a deadbeat, even though i work full time and have a decent job. It fucking sucks, i just try not to let it get to me."
