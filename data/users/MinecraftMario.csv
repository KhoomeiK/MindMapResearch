yiotro_games,ff4xx8v,t1_ff4x9v5,1579575107.0,Build up armies (upgrade your starter planet for max production ASAP) and wait for yellow to take the planet right next to your starting one. Then immediately take the planet to the left of it and upgrade it. Take some time to build up armies and hope blue doesn't go after you. Once you have about 70 send them up and have them take out the planet the blues started on. You should then be able to take out their only other high production plant immediately after. You now out produce them. Just don't leave your main planets undefended and don't let blue build back up and you're good.

gaming,feoddnw,t1_fenaave,1579298642.0,Maybe its different where you are but in my experience it's not the exact same people. What I've seen is a bit of a generational shift. The people shitting on fortnite and those who play it appear to be the people who got shat on for playing minecraft when that was the popular thing to do. The people shitting on minecraft grew up and moved on and minecraft became popular again because the people who played it in its heyday are becoming adults. I suspect we'll see a similar cycle again in a few more years.

Seattle,fefw9lc,t1_feevumd,1579067258.0,Details on what crime this individual has performed help significantly in trying to identify them. If this person has stolen something then it makes it far easier to identify them as someone could notice that they recently came into possession of a similar object.

PrequelMemes,fefv6wy,t1_feesq0z,1579066246.0,Because they weren't exactly uncommon things to run into and had been in service for about 20 years. Anyone who wanted to stay out from under the Empire's thumb probably would be able to simply figure it out after realizing that they never could pursue in hyperspace. Obi-Wan lived near a massive hub for smugglers and it doesn't seem to ridiculous that he might have simply overheard people talking about it.

MurderedByWords,fe6sjbb,t1_fe6s9qj,1578903361.0,Well I think you found our core disagreement in your first sentence. You think land is more valuable than human life and something tells me I can't change your entire moral code over night. Its midnight where I am so I'm going to get some sleep. Thanks for the debate.
MurderedByWords,fe6ruib,t1_fe6rqx2,1578902423.0,Is it? True communism is when you force everyone to be equal regardless of how well they otherwise perform. You are arguing above that the electoral college is better than a popular vote system because it forces the result to be more equal regardless of the way people vote.
MurderedByWords,fe6rpl6,t1_fe6r714,1578902240.0,It's unfair because it doesn't accurately reflect the popular vote is the precise issue. It puts its finger on the scale to make an issue that isn't even even. This is something that people fight over all the time. I don't think we should force equality of outcome. When we try to force such a system in econmics it's called communism and I would be willing to guess you're against that.
MurderedByWords,fe6qybk,t1_fe6qc40,1578901233.0,Let's say I am arguing for a system that disproportionately benefits the democratic party because I want them to win. How are you not arguing for precisely the same system but for the opposite party. Under the electoral college the rural vote is absurdly over represented wherein a statistically conservative citizen of Wyoming has 3 times the voting power of a statistically liberal Californian. All people are created equal and should be treated under the law as equals. Here we see an egregious example of people being treated differently for no other reason than they happen to live in different areas.
MurderedByWords,fe6q248,t1_fe6pefx,1578900095.0,I am arguing for a more fair system. A person is a person and I have been in favor of voting reform and was for it even under the Obama administration. This country was founded to escape the rule of a disinterested minority. The electoral college enforces that. Worse still it hurts both sides. Under this system  a handful of swing states have all the power because most states are completely locked down by a majority. This helps no one except the small group in those swing states.
MurderedByWords,fe6p6js,t1_fe6ow19,1578899008.0,If it's not going to be close under the popular vote then it shouldn't be close. In the Olympics you don't put weights on Usain Bolt to make it a close race. The vote should reflect the will of the people. It shouldn't be half and half if it won't be half and half.
MurderedByWords,fe6oo4j,t1_fe64qz2,1578898398.0,Consider this. What if we made everyone's vote everywhere matter. Right now if you're a Republican in California your vote does nothing and the same goes for a Democrat in Texas. If we had a popular vote in place everyone's vote everywhere would matter. Not only that but they would matter equally. We would have outcomes that actually reflect that the nation wants every time all the time. We could make it even better by installing the alternative vote which makes it so that you can support smaller more niche candidates while also not guaranteeing the victory of a candidate you strongly oppose.
coolguides,fe6mm4v,t1_fe2a1t9,1578896094.0,Around the time we were trying to standardize electrical systems and it probably would have been effective to do so a minor conflict that you may know as World War 2 occured and preoccupied everyone long enough that we couldn't really standardize anymore.

HistoryMemes,fe4aqon,t1_fe0faq2,1578857363.0,It depends on the way the timeline works. If it's a model where new timelines are formed at any major decision like is proposed in some form by quantum physics then the time travelers would be quite unaffected by their own travel merely creating new timelines which are affected by their shenanigans. It would also be fine if we're in a universe where what happens is what always happened then time travelers would have always time traveled and therefore the future would always be as if they had. The later creates a chicken and egg issue of course and erases the concept of free will but it still works.

TrueOffMyChest,fdxnogw,t1_fdwwc6q,1578770968.0,Even if you're brave enough to hop into controversial you'll really only find stuff that goes against the reddit hivemind. Stuff railing on large subs like r/atheism or suggesting that maybe social justice isn't an awful thing.  It's very rare to find a true unpopular opinion and the ones that you can find are typically comedic nonsense like the madman who showers in socks.
KOTORmemes,fdu3bsb,t1_fdtfy0r,1578726781.0,I never did dark side because you have to be a complete asshat to everyone. Sometimes I would do a more minor transgression like the death match against Bendak because that was a fun challenge but most DS points require torture or senseless murder or otherwise awful behavior and I don't exactly take pleasure in being ruthlessly evil only to be rewarded with more ruthless evil.

PrequelMemes,fdg17gb,t1_fdfeq92,1578376293.0,She was born 36 BBY and the battle of Exegol of 35 ABY. She would be 71. Han was only about 4 years younger than that and didn't have the force to enhance physical feats. The only excuse for her being dead would be if the First Otder managed to off her somehow. However if we consider that Empire couldn't kill her in 20 years I doubt the first Order could kill her in 1.

TIHI,fd75n6w,t1_fd6y7xj,1578199744.0,You clearly don't live in the northwest. A couple years ago some idiot set off a firework in the forest. Wildfires went out of control and burned through huge portions of the BC and Washington. The sun was red for most of the summer and you couldn't be safely outside. The Pacific northwest is wet enough that wildfires only happen in summer but they still happen and they're still a massive issue.
