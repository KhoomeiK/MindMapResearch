The objective wouldn't be increase the occurrence of any heritable characteristics. There's no need for that.

As for incentives:

* Stop giving people money simply for reproducing (e.g. in the UK parents get child tax credits).

* Stop enforcing mandatory parental leave.

* Apply tax benefits for people who *don't* reproduce (e.g. tax rebates).

* Improve access to sexual education.

* Improve access to contraception (e.g. have governments pay the cost).

* Lower the barriers for contraceptive surgeries (e.g. make it illegal for doctors to deny vasectomies, unless there are medical complications).

* Encourage / promote fostering and adoption through education, and tax benefits. There are thousands of children who deserve homes, and love. Reproducing instead of adopting is just selfish, and arrogant.
