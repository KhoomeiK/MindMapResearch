MandelaEffect,fecodgk,t3_eo19je,1578979045.0,"I blame thought processes. All brains are different, yet many processes develop similarly. Where some may hold value to certain memories, other's let go of it in lieu of more important things to remember.  
Think of it this way. Some people have or still do this thing where they try to remember a meaningless moment. ""I will actively try to remember this meaningless moment of just sitting here and staring at the wall on this date"" for whatever reason. This may sound stupid to some people but for other's its somewhat of a thought experiment.

Whatever brought one person to such a thought experiment could possibly have brought others, but not everyone. In the same way, some people remember certain details, other's fill in blanks as they go along.

gaming,fcwnya2,t3_eiv97h,1578031131.0,"Personally I like survival games where it's more about building your own empire from scratch. Like you said, end game is usually the same thing over and over again. Get a way to change end game instead of simply extending it with more ""tech"" or upgrades. Like carrying your survivor over with new skills and talents to a new map with different challenges to face.  
I have never liked the whole ""survivors kills each other on site for their goods"" part. I like Rust and ARK but people rarely work together. I like Space Engineers a bit more to be honest.  
Zombies are tired. Post apocalypse is tired. Alien world is tired. We need something new."
