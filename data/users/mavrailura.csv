HaircareScience,fdwgyql,t3_en8c5u,1578758572.0,"I have a couple diagnostic questions:

Have you moved to a different area? Air and water quality can take a toll on your hair.

Has your diet changed? Hair issues can be traced to health issues. 

Because you're at a standstill with products, try a water filter showerhead. You may be dealing with mineral buildup from water issues. During the time you try this out, stay with one type of shampoo and conditioner to isolate the cause of the problem."

HaircareScience,fdwaruo,t3_en6qpe,1578756810.0,"TIL! That's fascinating and it makes sense that air pollution could have that impact on your hair. You'll want to get as much moisture back into your hair as possible. Get a good leave-in conditioner for the daytime (probably something lightweight to avoid style issues), and then at night, dampen your hair slightly, do a heavier leave-in conditioner, and braid. 

I haven't tried this, but you could also make your own leave-in conditioner with regular conditioner and water in a spray bottle. I hope this helps!"
