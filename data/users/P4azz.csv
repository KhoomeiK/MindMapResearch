You should always doubt wikis, though, since they're hardly ever official and one guy misunderstanding a minor detail can translate to hundreds of people misinterpreting something.

For the ingame info, I gotta say there's no real excuse. The best I can think of is the fact that Japanese to English translations simply can't be 100% accurate without multiple revisions and even then you can have ""small"" mistakes that lead to big misunderstandings.

Once she jumps back I prepare for superman and then see if she does it instantly again, because I've been murdered by the tempered version just spamming that move twice in a row before.

Being familiar with LoL is about as helpful as being familiar with Guild Wars when you start WoW. Just because they're in the same genre they don't play exactly the same and require 0 effort to transition.

Turbo is probably the worst shit to get started in, since it teaches fucking nothing and is possibly the worst area to start learning in.

You don't vent about real issues, you vent about issues you created for your friend. You didn't start a coop bot match with him, something that can introduce him to the very basics of heroes and items and let him try out shit in a safe environment with other like-minded people who are either on the same footing or also teaching others.

Instead you queued for a real match with 8 other people who WILL be above his skill, since you are queuing with him, dipshit. Even if, and I highly doubt it, you just watched his game live, jumping straight into pvp is something you can't do. Of course he'll get shit on, you moron, he doesn't know jack shit about what anything does.

Accentuating it with an extra frame seems more jarring, but helps the joke, since you don't instantly realize that's what it is."

I don't even know what ""interesting ideas/promotions"" is supposed to mean. What the fuck should be promoted? How is a completely new patch with tons of changes not full of interesting ideas?

Free stuff. Fuck off. You don't need to get free stuff from a free-to-play game.

And it's not even close to spring yet, we're not even halfway through winter, what are you talking about?"

This is supposed to be all ""wow, look how smart they are"" and all I can think of are the myriad ways this could easily be faked and probably is, let's be honest here.

Always the second one, signalling of some sort behind the camera, certain things the guy holding the shit does etc.

They're smart animals. Why not just show that off realistically rather than exaggerate like this?"

Report him, so he gets muted or low prio and hopefully he'll learn in time. If not he'll keep getting reported and end up banned at some point.

There's no need for an instant ban just for horrible human beings."

All this guy does is hate on the new patch whenever he can and scream in unison with the others that ""game ded"" and ""new patch bad"".

1: 5 still buys all the wards, but just has more money and xp now. Just pick someone who can be very active in early fights and maybe scale a bit, but don't go for stupid shit like aghs rush, just cause you have a little more money.

2: Meta is lots of fights, not terribly much farming.

3: RNG has been overblown and is not as impactful as so many people wanna make it out to be. The items that drop are nice, yeah, but they're not gamebreaking until we're talking 70+ minutes ingame. Sure, getting an Iron Talon on an AM is nice, but it's not gonna instantly win you the game. And you still have to make sure you don't just afk jungle for these items while the enemies just take your towers.

I've personally stopped playing for now. But that's not necessarily because of the new patch and rather because I currently just can't get enjoyable matches anymore. Patch is really exciting and being a wardbitch isn't a death sentence as it was previously."

I had a cousin who just put flies in a tupperware box one summer vacation. I can still remember him pouring milk over them for some reason and they wiggled around, since he had ripped their wings off.

My sister and I deeply cared for two slugs on a vacation in Denmark.

Wouldn't be surprised if he'd just shown his dad a pile of fly corpses on the windowsill or something."
AskReddit,fdmygms,t1_fdmfo84,1578571333.0,"I feel like that's a better way to go about it than prohibiting stuff.

We weren't really allowed to watch much TV and we were usually found out, because we didn't know that the TV would actually heat up, so quickly shutting it off when mom/dad came in wasn't really as inconspicuous as we thought."
AskReddit,fdmyb6l,t3_em2vfz,1578571163.0,"This one only applies to my aunt&uncle's house, but still:

For every single meal you had to be present, sitting down until everyone was finished and always make sure to drink a glass of whatever beverage was there.

You couldn't finish early, you couldn't make your own or different food and you couldn't drink straight from a bottle. And these rules stayed around when I was like 12 and used to make my own shit on my own time at home.

Granted, my other aunt was even crazier and demanded I follow proper etiquette when eating. And no, that doesn't mean ""don't throw food"" or ""don't spill"", it meant following a whole slew of rules (""knigge"") like cutting your spaghetti, then twirling the fork in a spoon."
