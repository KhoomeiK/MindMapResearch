Awwducational,ffq1muc,t1_ffpuhs6,1580115434.0,They actually did a study with barn owls removing light sources that they could use to see you never still able to successfully hit be is it was dragged across the floor.
Awwducational,ffq1haa,t1_ffpzwk6,1580115203.0,Owls only understand your head to be you. Not arms or legs. An imprint won’t fear you like a normal owl bc your “ one of her kind” so whether your mate or rival the interaction will involve her talents and your head. A big female great horned owl could play 1000 pounds of pressure per square inch at the end of each foot. Eagle gauntlets are usually made of I believe Kevlar material and also contain plates to keep them from breaking bone even though their talents may not penetrate the Kevlar.
Awwducational,ffq1eap,t1_ffputzt,1580115076.0,"Ive worked with long and short eared owls, barred owls, great-horned owls, screech etc. Basically any native species found in New York State. The only time o have ever had one turn on me while I attempted to catch it was a barn owl like the one pictured. Every animal has that fight or flight distance. Unfortunately this bird will never mate successfully. Will if female sit year after year on eggs not fertilized in hopes of hatching babies. Her calls may be answered by wild birds near by, but she won’t notice as she tries to catch the eye of her human interest. She will never be human and she won’t ever fit with her own. The best thing will be if she can be used to prevent future babies from imprinting in captivity. If you love em, leave em alone."

IAmA,ff5j32t,t1_ff5iwij,1579595219.0,Dont see it
IAmA,ff5j12t,t1_ff41dkb,1579595140.0,Nice movie reference! B
IAmA,ff4m8tc,t3_erd8si,1579567021.0,I have a close friend who is xxy. Similar issues. Long limbs and such. He also thought he might be gay at one point. Any feeling that there is a genetic component to sexuality?
Awwducational,fd59gss,t1_fd4kq3s,1578175390.0,They don’t see well and are really short lived. Not very friendly for most part either but the babies are handleable.
Awwducational,fd1yjw2,t3_ejgjeh,1578138829.0,For any interested while on the subject of moral dues and  don’t ‘ s I will say falconry is my favorite form of hunting however using selective behavioral modification through hours of food association with the glove and careful weight manipulation to keep a healthy bird while also hungry enough to be properly motivated to hunt may not be the most moral of ways to keep captive animals.  Especially since the first allowed birds are red tails and kestrels. The latter are small enough that a new falconer can easily do damage.
Awwducational,fd1xef5,t1_fd0cd3k,1578138317.0,As to handling. The owl was only touched on rare occasion she’d let me to demonstrate non symmetrical placement of her ears and flat facial disc which suggests primary hunting hours( flat at night ) and more rounded like a snowy hunting both day and night.
Awwducational,fd1x3u3,t1_fd0cd3k,1578138188.0,And at this point I have twenty years experience handling raptors. Screech both red and grey phase long eared and short eared owls barn owls kestrels red tails rough legged great horned etc.  Basically any species found in New York and even a spectacled owl though foreign.
Awwducational,fd1wplu,t1_fd0cd3k,1578138002.0,This owl is a human imprint which is why she’s “flirting” with me. A non releasable owl used for education programs as is required by federal standards of a scientific license to collect and possess as well as preventing future imprints. She is in jess’s and can’t leave the glove. The child is my daughter. We love only what we know so we start young in my family. I was a little older than her when I began.

Awwducational,fd04q96,t3_ejrq2u,1578113600.0,Well I don’t see or understand the difference. I copied the link to the page.
history,fd03v62,t3_ejmlt4,1578113240.0,They were instrumental in Hannibal crossing the alps and surprising the romans weren’t they?
Awwducational,fd01cwb,t3_ejgjeh,1578112171.0,Thanks! It’s about ten years old now.
gifs,fcwuivx,t3_ej6s0m,1578038178.0,I’ve heard theories advanced that they might see in a spectrum that makes urine visible. Allows them to sit over only active rodent trails.
