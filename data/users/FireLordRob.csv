With the talent on this roster, if they can find a way to play with fire and heart again (imo something they've been missing since round 1 verse Colorada that they should have lost. Winning the Presidents doesn't mean anything if you fail in the playoffs. Washington fans can attest to that) then we'll be in a really good spot and have a real shot to win. Look at last year's Blues. This current Pred's roster has the talent and the skill to be competing for cups. They just need to start acting like it. Also gotta get Forsberg and Arvy more ice time."
hockey,fg7bzb4,t1_fg7494k,1580588849.0,Yea =( I've been a Pred fan since 2009 and it's been a tough thing to see. Especially the past couple of seasons being a life long Red Wings fan and a 10-year Preds fan. Someone give me something to cheer about! It's like I don't even enjoy watching the Preds play anymore. They almost seem bored out there. Grimaldi usually looks like the only one out there giving a care. It hurts my frail little heart to see =( The Preds roster is way too good to be this bad.
detroitlions,fg7brgv,t3_ex6pub,1580588700.0,Seeing all these clips of Coach P on with McAffe and all the Senior Bowl clips and I want to know where this personality hides during the year and during the season. In Season Patricia is boring and annoying and answers every question poorly and seems like a generally unlikeable guy but off season Patricia seems like just a good dude who's got some good input and seems fun. I want to see that Patricia during the season you know? Because clearly the other side of him hasn't been working out so well in season.
detroitlions,fg7bii0,t1_fg744cg,1580588529.0,"It always confused me how it's just ""2019 season"" even though there are games in the new year.
