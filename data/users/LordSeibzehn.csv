transformers,felh5h1,t1_felcnhk,1579222057.0,"As someone who has followed TFs continuously since the 80's and has followed the evolution of the toys and media, here are some thoughts:

\- Regarding materials: although the plastics used currently vary in quality depending on toy line (the Siege line, for instance, uses very solid quality plastics), they stand up to play *much* better than their G1 counterparts.  Many G1 toys would not pass a modern drop-test, due to flimsy and delicate designs.  For example, just consider how many G1 Jazz toys have the broken roof piece, just from normal play?  Sure there was die-cast, but in many cases that just made the toys poorly balanced.  You can throw a Siege figure against a wall, and the most that would happen is that an arm  orr a leg with a socket joint would just need to be popped back in.

\- Complex designs - again, this would depend on the line.  There are variety of concurrent TF toy lines that cater to different age groups and purposes, from toddlers to hardcore collectors.  The complexities vary accordingly.  

The Chevy Volt that you're referring to is likely the character Jolt from the Revenge of the Fallen movie line.  The Michael Bay movie designs are admittedly a mixed-bag, and Jolt is really kind of ""meh"".  But there are definitely some outstanding designs that have come out of those movies!"
transformers,fecnlrm,t1_fece3zo,1578978435.0,Interesting take! Why do you think so?

AskMen,fdmkbd7,t1_fdmjy0h,1578553096.0,"I hear ya. In my experience, even casual sex sometimes elicits feelings of possessiveness and jealousy. It’s really not for everyone. So at least they recognize that and were honest about it before things were further.

EDIT: I realize now that I misread your post a bit. The guys were the ones who thought you might “rope” them into a relationship."
AskMen,fdmjn0n,t3_em5ud7,1578552334.0,"I think the issue is with the guys being unable to face the possibility that you are engaging in casual hookups with other partners as well. It becomes a competitive enterprise with your other (possible) partners, and they did the mental math and decided to withdraw from the “competition”.  Just my theory though."

My guess is that they wanted the first release of the seeker mold to come with a more neutral, conventional face so it showcases the design and concept of the line instead of having people focus on the face."

AskMen,fdfjz17,t1_fdfirm6,1578363477.0,"I recognize that most times it’s more so a greeting rather than a genuine question, and I generally don’t talk about my life anyway, so I typically respond with “eh, all right” or “eh, not too bad”, followed by a heavy sigh.

If this prompts follow-up questions about my “weekend” or whatever, that’s when I respond with... the same thing. “Meh, it was all right” (even though I might have won the lottery or done something amazing)."

nextfuckinglevel,fcz21tk,t3_ejkrdr,1578092091.0,"Just a follow-up observation and a thought: the missile is initially propelled out of the launcher by another force other than the missile’s own boosters, since the boosters don’t ignite until after launch.

Makes me wonder if this system is designed to be able to deploy in tight, potentially populated areas. Vertical launch to clear buildings/structures, then boost towards target."
nextfuckinglevel,fcynkht,t1_fcymdxp,1578083389.0,I see! Hence that flat flight path. It probably is more efficient to dedicate all your boost towards the intended direction/axis rather than wasting fuel on needless parabolic motion.
