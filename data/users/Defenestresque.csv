The guy saying that women and men can't have close platonic relationships without it meaning something more is calling people who believe the opposite ""horny teenagers""..?!

>if one of them finds a girlfriend/boyfriend, it would be disrespectful to your relationship to hang out one on one and say I love you to a friend of the opposite sex.

OP never wrote anything about saying ""I love you"" to her so I'm not sure where that's coming from. Regardless, if you consider someone spending time with a friend (going out for drinks and having a heartfelt conversation alone) disrespectful to your relationship I think you may have some deep-seated insecurities that you may need to examine."

It's a Discworld meme from Going Postal. Yo copy the plot synopsis:

In Terry Pratchett's Discworld series, the clacks are a series of semaphore towers loosely based on the concept of the telegraph. Invented by an artificer named Robert Dearheart, the towers could send messages ""at the speed of light"" using standardized codes. Three of these codes are of particular import:

G: send the message on

N: do not log the message

U: turn the message around at the end of the line and send it back again

When Dearheart's son John died due to an accident while working on a clacks tower, Dearheart inserted John's name into the overhead of the clacks with a ""GNU"" in front of it as a way to memorialize his son forever (or for at least as long as the clacks are standing.)

""A man is not dead while his name is still spoken."" - Going Postal, Chapter 4 prologue

Basically it's been applied to Terry Pratchett himself. People still talk about him, so he's not dead, and so forth."

> The man flew from Wuhan to Guangzhou and from there to Toronto, arriving at Pearson International Airport Wednesday on China Southern Airlines flight CZ311. Upon arrival at Toronto, the man did not report to border-service officers that he was feeling ill, despite “detection” measures at the airport, which includes screening questions at electronic border kiosks that ask about previous travel to Wuhan in the past 14 days and remind people to report flu-like symptoms to border service agents.

> Instead, the man went home. The next day a family member called 911 to report he was feeling ill, and that he had recently travelled to Wuhan.

> Instead, the man went home. The next day a family member called 911 to report he was feeling ill, and that he had recently travelled to Wuhan.

Compare that to what it says now:

>The man, now in hospital in Toronto, was interviewed by a Canada Border Services Agency officer after he got off a flight from Guangzhou, China at Toronto’s Pearson airport, said Tam. He had indicated on an electronic questionnaire that he had been in Wuhan, she said.

>The traveller was allowed to leave freely, equipped with a form that explained what he ought to do should his symptoms get worse, Tam said. His family called 911 the next day and he was taken to hospital when he did feel worse.

I suggest anyone who wants responsible reporting in our media contact the NP editorial board and express exactly how they feel about the NP not issuing a public retraction for the story.

worldnews,ffnmbu9,t1_ffneub4,1580067801.0,"It's not so much that the system is stupid, it's just really old and full of legacy quirks. The title *is* supposed to be demarcated with a space. The problem happens when travel agents/counter staff don't enter the names in the right format.

Take a look at [this](https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/149323/my-name-causes-an-issue-with-any-booking-names-end-with-mr-and-mrs) StackExchange thread (scroll to top answer), it's a pretty interesting case.

Excerpt:

GDS -- such as Amadeus and Sabre -- generally offer multiple interfaces into their systems, from old ones kept for compatibility reasons to more modern ones. More modern interfaces will accept structured messages which leave no room for ambiguity; the old ones however... are full of quirks.

In general, Travel Agencies are loathe to modernize their IT: it requires re-training the agents, and buying new software, which costs quite a bit of money with little to no benefits to them.

In the case of a Travel Agency connected to Amadeus, for example, this means that they are likely using ATE: the Amadeus Terminal Emulator, which as the name implies emulates the terminals of old.

Check the Quick Reference Guide, p. 33 on how to create a PNR:

    NM1SMITH/JOHN MR 

    NM: ""Name"" command.

    1: 1 passenger with the following surname.

    SMITH: surname.

    JOHN: first name.

    MR: title.

Using a space, the parsing is unambiguous, however not all agents put a space, thus if instead the agent types:

    NM1ELADAWY/AMR 

Then the command will be parsed as (NM, 1, ELADAWY, A, MR) to be ""helpful"".

Edit:

Interestingly enough, just like with the user who posted above, forcing the travel agent to put the name down as ""Dr. Amr ElAdawy"":

    NM1ELADAWY/AMR DR

would also solve the issue."

worldnews,fedwnyi,t1_feda595,1579021465.0,">If a 13 year old kills their whole family what is the punishment? Why should it be any different than someone who is over 18?

Here is a brief argument from the Roper v. Simmons Supreme Court case referenced above:

>Under the ""evolving standards of decency"" test, the Court held that it was cruel and unusual punishment to execute a person who was under the age of 18 at the time of the murder. Writing for the majority, Justice Kennedy cited a body of sociological and scientific research[1] that found that juveniles have a lack of maturity and sense of responsibility compared to adults. Adolescents were found to be over-represented statistically in virtually every category of reckless behavior. The Court noted that in recognition of the comparative immaturity and irresponsibility of juveniles, almost every state prohibited those under age 18 from voting, serving on juries, or marrying without parental consent. The studies also found that juveniles are more vulnerable to negative influences and outside pressures, including peer pressure. They have less control, or experience with control, over their own environment. They also lack the freedom that adults have, to escape a criminogenic setting.[10]

tl;dr: the national consensus on punishment of juveniles is changing. more people are asking the quedtion ""if a person under 18 is deemed to not be mature enough to be given the privilege of entering into a explicit contract or voting, then how can you expect them to be able to enter into a societal contract with regards to capital punishment? especially given the immaturity of their brains and high susceptibility to immediate cultural/environmental factors and peer pressure?

Of course noone is saying they should escape punishment or that punishment should be massively reduced. 

But if you're asking ""if a 13 year old kills their whole family what is the punishment?""  the Supreme Court ruled that it's (at maximum), life in prison. As to the 'why', well, see above."

I agree that he may have been hyperbolic but that's absolutely not what he said.

>I stared at the pacing tiger and figured it enjoyed a territory of about 200 square feet.

Which is much closer to the interpretation of the user you are replying to than yours.

Edit: ohhh okay, I get what you meant now. The definition of 'enjoyed'. Okay, I see how that can be confusing. However in this context, 'enjoy' usually means 'has' or 'is allowed'. For example: ""Studies show that for best outcomes, a mother of a newborn needs 4 months of parental leave. However in most American workplaces women enjoy only 2-4 weeks"" doesn't mean they are literally only enjoying the first 2-4 weeks and spend the rest of the time wanting to get back to work.

I mean, if you disagree that's fine because I see how that sentence could be ambiguous but to me it's pretty clear what OP meant."

worldnews,fdjbfaj,t1_fdj7pvy,1578464186.0,"It's a literal thing. In 2014, amid intense corporate lobbing by cable executives concerned about the falling profits of the Netflix era, Congress passed the ""Restoring Customer Freedom Act.""

The act mandated that in order to cancel a cable subscription, customers had to show proof of the seriousness of their intention by literally cutting the coaxial cable going from their wall to the TV and email a video of the act to the cable company as proof. Hence the term ""cord-cutters.""

Interestingly enough, originally the act required that customers cut the power cable going to the cable box as well but a couple of melted scissors and singed eyebrows later (from people who didn't understand you had to remove the plug from the wall first) led to the industry dropping that particular requirement.

Basically it's a regional quirk, like British ""TV licences.""

I was particularly intrigued by this part:

>CRUZ: What I would tell especially young people all the time, you know, I'd meet Bernie's supporters and I'd say, ""You know what? I agree with Bernie,"" and they'd look at me, startled.

>THRUSH: Right.

>CRUZ: They didn't expect a Republican to say that. I said, ""Listen, Bernie talks about how Washington is corrupt, both parties are in bed with the lobbyists and special interests. I think he's exactly right.""

>THRUSH: Yeah. That's your message.

>CRUZ: And I said, ""The difference is — where Bernie and I differ is on solutions."" If the problem is Washington is corrupt, why on Earth would you want to give more power to Washington?

I wish I had the chance to ask Cruz ""Ok, so we agree on the first part. Of course to fix massive problems there must be some sort of power to do so, whether it's the centralized power of the government or the diffused power of the free market and corporations. Knowing what we know about the fundamental purpose of running a company (to make money) and the nature of corporate executives, what makes you think that they will do a better job at benefiting *all people* (not just their shareholders) compared to say, a government with Sanders at the helm?""

**Edit:** to those who lean Libertarian and are inclined to say ""in a free market with rational actors and access to information, people wouldn't deal with companies that do [bad thing]"" or ""don't be naive, governments can only waste money they are fundamentally incapable of actually putting the money they steal from taxpayers to good use"" I *highly* recommend you read Scott Alexander's [Non-Libertarian FAQ](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/02/22/repost-the-non-libertarian-faq/#political_issues)."

>This is a really misleading title.

How so? The title states they killed a tool that let you pull your blood sugar data off the device. I don't see how that's misleading.

>They issued a take-down notice for a tool on github that violates copyright of the code that extracts said data.

How did the code violate their copyright? Merely building a doo-dad to read data a company doesn't want you to read off a device you own doesn't violate copyright as long as that doo-dad doesn't use the company's own proprietary code to do so. I see no evidence proposed that this was done.

Further, the article makes three compelling argument that the code was **not** violating copyright which I pasted below. At least, it's more compelling to me than your blanket assertion that copyright was violated with no explanation as to how.

>First, they say that creating a tool that interoperates with the Freestyle Libre's data is a copyright infringement, because the new code is a derivative work of Abbott's existing product. But code that can operate on another program's data is not a derivative work of the first program -- just because Apple's Pages can read Word docs, it doesn't mean that Pages is a derivative of MS Office. In addition, as Diabettech points out, EU copyright law explicitly contains an exemption for reverse engineering in order to create interoperability between medical devices (EU Software Directive, Article 6).

>More disturbing is Kirkland/Abbott's claim that the project violates Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which prohibits bypassing ""access controls"" for copyrighted works. Factual data (like your blood sugar levels) are not copyrightable -- and if they were, you would hold that copyright. It's your blood. What's more, DMCA 1201 also contains an interoperability exemption.

>Finally the whole thing is obviously fair use: it's a highly transformative work for an obviously socially beneficial purpose.

>Just before five o'clock in the morning, Fearless, loaded with about 400 marines, began moving toward the harbour.[37] A small crowd had assembled, including several policemen still waiting for the customs boat. The British consul had received advance notice of the invasion and was waiting with his associates to assist the troops when they arrived. Uncomfortable with the crowd, Consul Shepherd turned to the Icelandic police. ""Would you mind ... getting the crowd to stand back a bit, so that the soldiers can get off the destroyer?"" he asked. ""Certainly,"" came the reply.[37]

>The Fearless started disembarking immediately once it docked.[38] Arnalds asked to speak with the captain of the destroyer, but was refused.[39] He then hastened to report to the Prime Minister, who ordered him not to interfere with the British troops and to try to prevent conflicts between them and Icelanders.[39] Down at the harbour, some of the locals protested against the arrival of the British. One Icelander snatched a rifle from a marine and stuffed a cigarette in it. He then threw it back to the marine and told him to be careful with it. An officer arrived to scold the marine.[40]
