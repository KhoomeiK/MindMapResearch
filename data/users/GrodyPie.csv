computer,fekecw7,t1_fejuxud,1579198280.0,Was just gonna say that might be the issue. It's probably thermal throttling itself to keep the temp down.
hardwareswap,fej3qm5,t1_fei7ap5,1579155769.0,Okay cool. I'll take that then.

college,fecim63,t3_eo50o7,1578974818.0,Same thing for me man. Every Wednesday I'm gonna go in from 10am til 8:50 at night. Good thing about it though is that I only have 1 class for all the other days. The advisor also told me that if I don't like that schedule I can drop 1 of the classes if it's too much. Good luck in school!
