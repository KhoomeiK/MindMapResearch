Yeah, the game just isn't in a great spot for balancing. Just keep in mind, the reason people want shorter chases is because of how much pressure you need to apply as killer. It isn't a 1v1 for killer, and that's where the issues come in."

deadbydaylight,fdj0o0l,t1_fdfn730,1578455451.0,"Believe it or not, they is a massive chunk of players that classify as high level players. After a certain amount of time, that just happens, and there will always be that large amount of players (unless changes like these and the motive behind them drives them away).

It's ridiculous to ignore the very valid thoughts of these players, and influencers in favour of some newbies who tremble at the sight of ruin and crouch away the moment they hear a heartbeat, when there are so many other players that can take advantage of every tile and split pressure across the huge maps to the point where it's near impossible to even pip as killer without using the absolute pinnacle loadout(s). Just look at marth88's experiment."
deadbydaylight,fdj047u,t1_fdivi1c,1578455067.0,"It could do with a rework, but then, that provides incentive to killers to camp and slug to constantly get 4ks and end the game asap, same for survivors to gen-rush and end to leave.

They strayed away from the original killer ranking system for that reason.

&#x200B;

And yes, they absolutely need to balance more around high rank players, as i stated in another thread, they were on a good path and now have just thrown it all out the window in whatever bizarre train of thought this is.

I think they need to all play a bunch of high rank games as killer like mcote did on that fateful day and open their eyes."

deadbydaylight,fdiaxne,t1_fdgfmp0,1578438921.0,"Can definitely empathize. Been there before and it sucks, I'd like to say that's a minority but I know it fucking isn't hahah.

Its all part of a cycle inherent in the games mechanics though, killer gets salty and plays like an ass, then the survivor plays the next game (or after the 5th against constant moris) like an ass."
deadbydaylight,fdiaod5,t1_fdgd2bl,1578438778.0,"That's an excellent point. The only way currently to even have a chance of escaping without a loop is running quick and quiet, lithe and dance with me haha

Edit: another thought, the issue still is that the loops can be way too strong, good survivors can loop around a killer for the whole match, especially with all good survivors.

You can still stealth around, but christ that's boring."

deadbydaylight,fdg1ijw,t1_fdfrmll,1578376600.0,"Not what I said.
