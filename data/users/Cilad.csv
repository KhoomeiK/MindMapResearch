coolguides,ffeykv2,t1_ffcxenj,1579870506.0,"Easy. Let the steak get to room temperature. Get a griddle, or cast iron skillet pretty hot. 1"" thick or better steak. Put a little EVO on the griddle, place steak on griddle. Do something else for 3.5 minutes, do NOT touch the steak. Flip steak after your timer goes off. Cook for 3.5 minutes. Remove steak from heat. Let the steak rest for 5 minutes. Return here and thank me later.

Edit: When your steak is done. Push on it with your finger. Note how it feels. I like the feel to be what it feels like to push between my thumb and index finger (bottom of the V). Then eat the steak. To rare, add 20 seconds. To much subtract 20 seconds. Thin steak? Less time. I say practice a lot :)"
Woodworkingvideos,ff9c8q1,t1_ff6uq0t,1579709690.0,Sorry about that. But I guess that means the test is apples to oranges. I hate using PVA glue due to the mess it makes. But it is very strong.
Woodworkingvideos,ff6haia,t3_ertufw,1579627182.0,"First. That was not Gorilla PVA glue. Second. I would like to get an up close look at how the glue joints failed. I'd bet money the glue joints didn't fail. The wood under the glue joint failed, is my guess. Also Titebond III is waterproof ( know because of how many shirts I have ruined ). And I read below, pretty much what I was saying in a longer post."

woodworking,ff32jrt,t3_eqp594,1579532008.0,"Nice! Your bandsaw bearings are not adjusted properly. The blade should be right against them, but not quite touching. Your blade is moving back, what looks like 1/8 of an inch when you push."
Whatisthis,femlkhq,t3_epvi5m,1579261501.0,Love magnetix. Absolutely do not let little children play with them. They could swallow two and that would be really bad.
woodworking,femlgou,t3_epndhm,1579261372.0,That looks AMAZING! Question: what is that vertical board on the shingles between the tower and chimney.
radiocontrol,fejio6c,t1_fehelg4,1579175940.0,"Many years ago I bough a SIG Chipmunk. The clear plastic canopy, and landing gear wire were missing. They sent me a freaking whole new kit. Most brands will do everything they can to make it right."
iRacing,fejikz4,t1_fejhkm1,1579175832.0,This has to be what the idiots are like in WOW Classic sitting at a flight point and ganking people as they fly in.
iRacing,fejie2j,t3_ep64de,1579175599.0,God I want to do this!!!!! It looks so fun!
dogs,fejibkj,t3_ep5jpm,1579175517.0,This has to be one of the most loving subreddits out there.
dogs,feji5yp,t3_ep5jpm,1579175326.0,"Let me start by saying this. There is just a time to do this. I think a lot of people wait too late. I was giving an 18 year old cat an IV every morning. And finally took TC (That Cat) for his trip to the Vet. The Vet. glared at me. It is just heartbreaking to put down a pet. The unquestionable love they give us makes it so hard to be put in the position to make such tough decision. TC died five years ago, and I have tears in my eyes right now. I believe that if you are asking here, then you know it is time. It us just so hard. So very hard to do. Just know that we don't even know Emily but we love her too. When you need to grieve we are right here for you. Lean on us."
radiocontrol,fehc4e2,t3_ep4jq5,1579113511.0,"The yellow stuff looks like it does nothing. My guess is they tin the pots. Then tin the wires and stick them down on the joystick with that yellow tape stuff just to hold it in place. There is no need for strain relief because there is no strain. 

Me I would cut the yellow crap off and hit the single connector with an iron and remove the broken wire. Strip the green wire back (what looks like) 1/4 inch, and tin it. Put a drop of flux on the cleaned up tab and re-solder the green wire. 

You could also call Frsky and show them the images. They might just replace the whole unit. You never know. 

Be sure to unplug the battery while working on it. If you can."
dataisbeautiful,fehax2b,t3_ep0l6b,1579112793.0,What is startling is Thriller at 65.9M and next on the list is Dark Side of the Moon at 43.3M. Dark Side of the Moon was my first Album. Chicago 6 was the second (in High School).
Woodworkingvideos,fdq48qq,t3_emiuua,1578654097.0,Very nice. I tend to not use sapwood from walnut. That looks fantastic.

formula1,fdnzg6o,t3_emch2k,1578595978.0,That video just breaks my heart. I am no Hamilton fan. But I seriously  love that he did this.
Whatisthis,fdnz1dk,t3_em9ssr,1578595740.0,Those are tele-prompters. And he was obviously reading from them. Someone is managing the scrolling for him as he reads.

politics,fdjngyy,t3_elku7e,1578479454.0,Why don't have Patriot batteries at these bases? Or spread across the eastern parts of Iraq?!?!?!
Spooncarving,fdjmley,t3_elle3a,1578478177.0,That looks fantastic. That look is why so much furniture is made out of it. And over time it will get darker.
woodworking,fdhzrdg,t3_elbpvi,1578433143.0,That is a great idea. That I am totally going to steal.

woodworking,fdhz8os,t1_fdhhfkt,1578432866.0,And it is incredibly strong.
Woodworkingvideos,fd9ha4d,t3_ek29dj,1578233346.0,Wow. Nicely insulated! I love it. So why face nail the siding? I want one! In my backyard for my office!
woodworking,fbg60pg,t3_ed0o4u,1576836231.0,Dang! I can't wait to see it finished. Uhm. Does it come apart? Or is it going to be a built in? :)
