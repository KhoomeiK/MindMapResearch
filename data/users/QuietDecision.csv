Also thought â€œIâ€™m youngâ€ and everyone acts like this in their early 20s, right? 

Not true. 

I masked my severe anxiety to look like I had my shit together and finally confided in my SO that drinking was the only way to cope. He then left me because he didnâ€™t want to deal with it. It took him leaving me to get treatment, and I wished heâ€™d been there by my side everyday. But Iâ€™m now a better daughter, friend and woman for it. 

You truly have to decide if you want to love him through it."
careerguidance,fdluv2u,t3_elx1rm,1578533037.0,"I work in social media so Iâ€™m constantly under a microscope. Even if I make one typo, it feels like I made a thousand mistakes and sabotaged my other successes. In reality something like this can easily be fixed and I probably am the only that truly cares. 

Donâ€™t take negative feedback personally. You are not your job or your mistakes."
stopdrinking,fdlubef,t3_elutax,1578532668.0,I could never drink it either because I was too hungover and it was too acidic...now itâ€™s the best feeling in the world. Keep it up!
careerguidance,fdlethq,t1_fdlaw4v,1578522490.0,"I agree. You're going to have to try a lot of things and plan it as you go, even if that means picking up a couple of ""odd"" jobs along the way! In more of a people-based, hospitality role, use it as a chance to network and learn about what people do for a living. You never know who you could meet and who could help you land your dream role."

Either way, this is why it's important to have \*multiple\* friend groups who, for the most part, don't interact with each other."

Making peace with that can take days, months, years but I just try to be as kind to myself as possible and that this is happening so I can be the perfect person for someone else"

careerguidance,fdh63no,t3_el4vlp,1578416180.0,"Honestly, I show up thinking I probably won't get it and that takes my nerves away. This is mainly for physical reasons so my voice doesn't shake and so I don't crack my knuckles. This also helps me with maintaining eye contact.

Beyond that, I extensively research the company and study their work/portfolio. I'm in social media marketing so I like to see if the agency's work is similar or different to mine. I always explain my creative processes and that usually lends itself to theirs as well, which is how I know whether I'm a good fit or not."
careerguidance,fdh3cu3,t3_el1crt,1578414498.0,"English major here! Graduated 3 years ago. While in undergrad, I started out contributing to the student newspaper at my university, then worked in graphic design at a local marketing agency, and then landed a social media role (mainly copywriting). While these didn't pay well, they helped me land my entry-level role, Social Media Coordinator, with no master's degree.

I dabbled in a lot of different roles because I loved copywriting, journalism, photography, video and even web design. I didn't know what I would like most and thought I had to pick just one. Turns out there are now roles that can combine all of these things. What I would do is put your freelance work on social and promote it there, as well as reach out to the connections you already have and explain your interests. What are you passionate about? What stories do you want to tell and how do you want to tell them? 

I currently want to transition out of the Social Media Coordinator role and move into a Social Media Producer role where I'm ""making"" content, so I'm putting my photography/illustrations on Instagram, copywriting and cross-promoting my art on Twitter, and planning to put my portfolio on LinkedIn once it's final. I, too, have considered a master's (like an MFA) to really hone in on Adobe Creative Suite, but through the connections I've made online I don't think it's worth it. Twitter is filled with creatives and writers sharing insights across multiple industries. Join the conversation. There's also a tutorial for literally everything nowadays; at least enough to build a portfolio and get your foot in the door.

I'm excited for your journey. I'm constantly soul-searching but I know you're going to find your place!"
