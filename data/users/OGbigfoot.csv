educationalgifs,fdx3vi9,t1_fdwedth,1578765031.0,When I worked at home depot a coworker was lifting a boxed but broken toilet into the compactor. The bottom of the box gave way and the shards tore through his slacks and fucked up his knees and thighs pretty good. Cut ligaments and all kinds of carnage.

My wife is a huge help with it since she's super organized and always reminds me about things I need to do and whatnot. I find for some reason building Legos is highly relaxing and focuses my mind.
