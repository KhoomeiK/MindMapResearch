AskMen,ff7al6c,t1_ff78uxp,1579644725.0,"Blatant sexism aside because i didn't realise that you 2 knew every single woman on earth. Don't you think it's safer for literally anyone to be on a snowmobile in fields of snow rather than on roads in a car where there a lot more people? 
Maybe use your brain before commenting shit like that too."
AskMen,ff7a7s5,t1_ff4xhj9,1579644422.0,To me a sled is definitely a toboggan but maybe that's my English side.
AmItheAsshole,ff4raa8,t1_ff4je9t,1579570544.0,"I think that it should really depend on the relationship. If any of the above is a deal breaker, they shouldn't be doing it. If the couple has given each other a pass then it's up to them how to deal with it. 
What i don't like is the fact that these parties are seen as the last night of fun. Why? You are literally getting a ring and a certificate, nothing should change in your relationship. Should be a celebration not a last attempt at living like you are single when you are ina relationship."
AmItheAsshole,ff4qgi2,t3_erfvwt,1579569979.0,"NTA. Even if you didn't change up the dress, what makes your sister think that it would be okay to wear your supposed wedding dress after what happened? You can get perfectly good dresses for cheap 2nd hand or in op shops."
sex,fexj333,t1_fex8vfx,1579431812.0,Can I ask what you would have done differently given the chance? I'm the same with my dad and he survived a heart attack a few years back. Nothing has really changed though but I don't want to regret anything.
AskReddit,fewka0e,t3_eqies2,1579412476.0,"Not sure if anyone will believe this but here goes.

About a year ago now, maybe less, my smoke alarm in the bedroom went off. As i walked towards the door threshold, the alarm stopped and i felt my whole body go cold to the point that i felt nauseous.

For some reason I instantly thought that it was my grandfather. I had no reason to believe that, i studied science and am not spiritual or religious in any way. He died in 2015 and i hadn't seen him since 2006. It was really weird why I even thought of him."

Apart from anything, it's your ex husband's money too, why the hell would he want it going to your fully grown step daughter?"
JustNoSO,feig3ew,t3_ep1l3h,1579137715.0,"Unfortunately i know how you feel, with slightly less physical abuse but trust me when you are getting back to your old self you with be wondering why you ever stayed. You can do a lot better and i know that because if i can, you can too."
AskCulinary,feifn4v,t3_ep6ku8,1579137409.0,Is that under the storage instructions? I would have thought that you defrost anything prior to cooking unless it specifically states cook from frozen.
sex,feiegur,t3_ep440j,1579136617.0,I did something similar and I just said that i really want to suck it and he said go on then. I don't think it takes anything away from if if younsay you want to or ask to.
offmychest,fefvva2,t3_eojf0n,1579066883.0,I'm so sorry for your loss. I'm kinda worrying about the day this happens to me too. My brother is definitely an alcoholic but is still in denial.
relationship_advice,feeatvj,t3_eoihfs,1579029950.0,"I've had both ends of this. One guy i was with REALLY struggled to get off during sex, he had to have all these things done at the same time and after an hour on top i literally gave up. I was so put off by it that we remained friends. 

I'd much rather be with a guy that comes quickly because he is turned on than one that doesn't at all. 

Plus this isn't one sided, girls can come quickly too but we don't get shit about performing in bed. That's an immense amount of pressure for guys so i hope you don't make him feel bad."
DeadBedrooms,feea0ek,t3_eok6ze,1579029472.0,"Wow, that's such a long time to be with someone and to just find that out. I am so glad you kicked him out. No one deserves to be in a relationship like that, yet so many stay because they are afraid or just don't believe they are good enough."
sex,fecg1vq,t3_eo99rw,1578973046.0,"I'd say riding is more the up and down bobbing but you can mix in some grinding because that's probably going to feel better for you.
As fo hurting him, it definitely can happen if you raise up too much and he slips out and then you're bouncing back down on him. Just be mindful of it."
AmItheAsshole,fec03qq,t3_eo4xsd,1578964796.0,"NTA. I would suggest that if he mentions anything you do again maybe take it up with his wife and if it continues, some one higher up. I'm not sure if the council or the police would be of any use here."
relationships,fe7178b,t3_enp4s5,1578908642.0,"I would quite clearly point out to her exactly what you said in your post. You've had other friends who still kept in contact regularly regardless of being in a relationship and she has made little effort to contact you first.

It all sounds exactly how you think, she just wants a free wedding planner."
AmItheAsshole,fe6zepb,t1_fe6nav6,1578908087.0,"Exactly, it's a bit hypocritical to get married and then make a joke out of it. 'Traditional' marriages aren't exactly common these days if you have a look at what they were like."
relationship_advice,fe538j5,t3_enmw2v,1578865259.0,Just move on boy. She is being manipulative and she is just saying all that so you'll crawl back to her. Do yourself a favour and find someone who treats you with some respect and can talk maturely about their feelings
relationships,fe02nbb,t3_encilj,1578801537.0,"You have 2 conflicting ideas. You don't need to compromise on this. You don't want to share and he wants to try things out with this other girl. 2-4 weeks seems like a big gap for visits to me considering it's 2 hours and there are weekends. 

You've been together for how long and are still doing long distance? Are you happy with how this relationship is progessing? If not, i think it might be worth looking into what you actually want."
childfree,fe01ixc,t3_enbzby,1578800764.0,Wtf. How fucking rude to say hurry up. I would have definitely said that i was actually getting a massage so buzz off. I have no qualms about shutting that down quick.
cockatiel,fduqric,t1_fduqjx6,1578737522.0,I suggest that you get them used to your voice and hand feed them before even trying to get them out when you do. If they get out again it's not a big deal as long as you shut all the windows and doors.
cockatiel,fdupahq,t3_en3v7s,1578736703.0,"I would probably have suggested that you don't get them out until they have been in their new environment at least a day because they need to get used to their surroundings.

Unfortunately until they are finger trained all you can really do is catch them or let them return to the cage in their own time when they get hungry."

DeadBedrooms,fdfskgm,t1_fdf7m64,1578369155.0,"I have read up on it. Blue balls in this context is just a way guys pressure women into having sex. There is such a thing as EH but it is extremely rare and only usually happens if an erection is held for HOURS. 

I'll just point out again that the common use doesn't actually refer to these cases. As soon as you lose your erection you are fine. Nothing bad will happen if you don't orgasm."

family,fdc9r2u,t3_ekhspn,1578269902.0,"I mean I complain about my siblings to my mum so sometimes she'll ""agree"" in her own way but she's not full on bitching about them. I guess it depends what exactly she's saying."
JustNoSO,fdbrfcs,t3_ekbl7p,1578260821.0,"I don't understand, did you actually discuss having the baby with him or did you just assume that he wants kids? He is so hands off it makes me wonder."

family,fcp4tg4,t1_fcp4gyv,1577850487.0,That's a shame. I feel that it would be a great idea to have somewhere to stay that wouldn't let your parents say you're ditching family because technically you aren't.
family,fcp45gn,t1_fcp38w2,1577849903.0,Have you spoken to any of them much? I wonder if they know how your parents are treating you.

financialindependence,fcoxnqm,t1_fc8m4bj,1577844419.0,"Isn't this why you rent the house out? You have a family covering most if not all your mortgage repayments while you live in somewhere cheaper, being single makes it really easy to get a place with flatmates. You could even get some in while you live there too assuming that it is more than just your bedroom?
Otherwise it will be quite hard doing it by yourself  i imagine."
family,fcowcyr,t1_fcovpv6,1577843377.0,"My dad used to hit my mum and had some fights with my brother. I seem to only remember a few things, i guess i block out most of it.  He definitely picked on my brother and sister more. I remember that he used to bang our heads together if we were misbehaving (i have 2 sisters and a brother).

 I remember one time he held my nose so hard so i couldn't breathe because I was being too loud or something. I remember one time my brother had done something and he was curled up on the floor cowering from our dad and my dad was just kicking him, he ended up with rug burns. 

It sounds so bad typing it out but you don't actually realize that it's so not okay until you start telling other people.

My mum finally started to get separated from my dad after i turned 15. At that point i was barely home. I would be out staying at friends houses as much as I could. 

My mum is just as bad really though like yours, she's not physically abusive but definitely emotionally and mentally."
family,fcovjy6,t1_fcovah7,1577842746.0,Sounds like a good first step. Just don't give up for me. I had pretty much moved out of home by 15 but my situation was different. It's doable but it's not easy. Give us an update if you manage to sneak your passport.
family,fcotrpo,t3_ei4ig2,1577841334.0,"This is SO abusive and I am so sorry that you are in this situation. The only way out is to find an adult you can trust. A female teacher might be more understanding or know more about resources to help.

You NEED help and the only way to get it is to find out WHO can help. Your teachers have noticed that your learning is being affected so it would explain to them why.

Your parents are very abusive, no parent who loved their kids would say they were glad they broke a bone. You don't even say that to people who you don't like.

And no, you shouldn't have to get up when your dad does, it's his problem for staying in a job that he clearly doesn't want to get up early for.

Please message me if you want any more advice.

Edit to add: I just saw that you are in Australia, I'm in NZ. I'm tempted to fly over and get you the hell out of there. I can help you."
sex,fcot2x7,t1_fcossqp,1577840792.0,"Uh yes, I've touched someone but i don't just do it without knowing they'd be okay with it. I don't know why you say 'real people' like there are fake people though. And no, I'm 23 and i don't agree with your approach. It's not a fantasy book."
sex,fcost6f,t1_fcosg4l,1577840581.0,"Yes, i 100% agree with this but not 'drunken consent is consent' it depends on how drunk they are. There can be a fine line so you have to be careful about making sure that they consent."

sex,fcos50g,t1_fcopspz,1577840078.0,Uhhh no. People do stuff drunk that they often don't remember. Therefore it's not a conscious decision. Try again.
sex,fcorzhz,t1_fcocnm7,1577839961.0,"Drunk or not, why would it be okay to just start touching or kissing someone and making them walk away to say no? Just ask them first ffs"
sex,fcorpqy,t1_fcopux2,1577839756.0,"A bit selfish is right. Sex is for both (or more) people to enjoy. Not just the guy. I'm not sure where you got the 'any hole is a goal' but my guess is that you either think it's cool and just copy the other assholes or someone has hurt you before and you treat women as just a hole to pump your load into.

 You KNOW how gross that is? Do you have a sister? A mum that you talk to? You know that we're people too.

I think you should look at the real reason you think that that's okay to say and why you care so much about getting off. There's no such thing as blue balls so maybe read up on it."

Your wife's going to freak out wach time regardless so she needs to find a way of dealing with the seizures herself and not wasting $1000 a pop."

You say that your sister was fine after 2 years which i think is bs. That stays with you but after 10 years, she should consider getting therapy or something if she still gets like that.

On the other hand, I'm not sure why you guys have made this a competition. Why does it matter to you so much that your mum is helping your sister. Are you insecure about the time and attention your mum spend on you?"

You don't need to be a manly man. You are perfect the way you are. Even the most feminine men had a father figure, it doesn't change who you are.

As for learning skills from him, you are perfectly capable to learn these yourself through trial and error.
