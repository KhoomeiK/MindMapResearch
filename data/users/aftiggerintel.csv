Only reason I got the dog back was the microchip stating my name and having pictures of the dog predating the drop off. Person who dropped it off claimed owner surrender - found out later neighbor who didn’t like the breed waited for the 2 minute window dog was in yard alone and got the dog and took it to the shelter and filled out most of the surrender paperwork. Im not judging anything beyond words presented but being cautious of the timeline. Yes there’s questions but at the same time if the timing is as it says and LAOP was there before holding period ended AND has at least 1 police report documenting that fact along with being able to prove ownership there’s not anything the shelter has to stand on and they’re grasping at straws. That’s why the claim went from timing to medical. That’s the only other claim that invalidates the holding period entirely but if LAOP already had taken care of the dog medically then that argument holds no more weight than a leaky bucket and the site director knows it. That’s why the latest claim is dog isn’t on site now. Without exact county it’s difficult to know the exact procedures and city would certainly give the exact holding period."

Imagine their shock when I called to not only find out their legal obligation, policy, and all financial accountings since he had been placed there.

Girlfriend tried to claim common law to SSA but messed up there because I beat her to making sure she couldn’t get anything from it by laying out a timeline of every single marriage (thanks to Ancestry.com I had all the dates from the women I didn’t know or were predeceased and couldn’t ask), all the dates of marriage and divorce, plus the exact month the girlfriend came into his life and when my parents’ divorce was legal. Common law was gone well before the time my dad could even claim her as a CL wife so that flew out the window as a chance. My father also had said that 5 times married was enough for him back in the early 2000 when out of her ear shot.

I had one of my teachers send me a note asking if my father had passed as it was an unusual name only found in two states in the country so when you googled it, it came up in those two states and if you did his name, my sibling and I were the only two in that state that came up besides him. No way no one would not know we were related even being stupid. Couldn't even say they didn't have phone numbers either. My cell number which is our business and home number comes up when you google his name (that's actually how his creditors called me both before his death and after it). Shocking right?

A similar one with coins primarily struck in the Qing Dynasty with coins bearing the names of Emperor Quianlong and Jiaqing (around 1736-1820) was listed with Ira and Larry Goldberg Auctioneers back in June 2015 and remained unsold with an estimated value at 1,000USD - [https://www.numisbids.com/n.php?p=lot&sid=1124&lot=3652](https://www.numisbids.com/n.php?p=lot&sid=1124&lot=3652).

That is just saying that the auction did not reach an audience at that time (auctions are hit and miss as they're usually quick turn around with very small audiences especially like this vs eBay where many go unless it's a very specific collector's market).

There's one on eBay listed as a Bali Statute made from Antique Chinese and Japanese Keeping Coins for 22.50 right now. There are some similarities to the one you have but more differences as well. The Bali cash coin were used until 1970 and statuettes were made stringing coins and cotton string together with wooden, metal, or glass faces/hands/feet so origin might also be Bali as well since it is unknown. The coins themselves will point to what might be the majority country. If origin is mixed for coins, it is most likely Bali in nature."

aww,ff993wx,t1_ff8nm3j,1579707679.0,"The cat we had from the time I was 4 to 22 loved the vet we got her from. She ruled his house and would beg for bacon beside his huge dobermans when she got abandoned there. He had her for about 6 months when we got her and she was about our age (4) when we got her. 

The reason he suggested the fit to my mom was our cat Sammy passed from feline leukemia and he was our basset’s cat more than anyone else’s in the house. She wasn’t eating and had little interests in anything else. He didn’t want to see her suffer and since Minnie looked like him, he thought she might ease a little more to that transition. Smell wise she knew she wasn’t him but she followed Minnie around the entire office just wanting to cuddle her. Once the cat figured out the dog wasn’t going to chomp her (a norm with random animals), she warmed right up. 

We had her until she was 22. She liked going back to the same vet who rescued her. She was weary to visit any new vet on the first visit but warmed up to them quickly because she knew she had a place in our home no matter what changed. Her favorite spot was sitting on the counter rather than the table watching and seeing what the vet was doing.

Outback ground clearance: 8.7”

The outback is tall enough if you have knee issues (some of us have bad knees even from our 20s and arthritis - We’re not old yet and I don’t have a seniors discount so no old lady status). It’s also tall enough to have an ornery 4 year old drop to the ground and low crawl under it before you register that she’s gone full limp arm to break contact with you to do it. Then you play 20 minutes of round around the car to catch the kid. Neighbor had to end up helping catch her on that one with busy street out front and me not being able to be on both sides of the car. Bribes weren’t working because she didn’t get her way and get to go to school with the older siblings. Thankfully she’s done that once and the novelty wore off with me. She did it to every other relative though. “Hey grandma! I can fit under here!” Dives under grandma’s Crosstrek. Yup I sent the teenagers out to get her that time. 

It’s got great leg room for everyone. We need that since oldest is in jr high and 5’11” already. I’m just hoping he slows down on shoe sizes because I’m not going to be able to find them big enough. Leg room though, we’ve had my brother in law and my father in law in my car and both are 6’4” sitting one behind the other so i think we will be good there. Add a topper and you’ve got tons of storage.

I have put a 48” bathroom vanity cabinet, 49” vanity top, and the odds and ends stuff from Home Depot in there and still had room. The guys were looking at me like I was nuts but really it’s like a game of Tetris.

Close second is picture of the flat paper - genius scan is my favorite app for this when it doesn't fit in any of our scanners (we've got a wand scanner and 3 different flat bed scanners so if it doesn't fit then you've probably drawn it on a giant canvas that I'm not wand scanning and patching up strips because they get all wonky after the 4th one). As far as transparencies, staples is an ok medium to print to,  however, the film might not be dark enough and might need doubled up. We print our films at 13"" x 19"" films and have rip software for smooth halftones which staples does not. That's the upside of using a screen printer that offers a printing service is getting the rip vs grainy halftones in whatever their software conversion decided to open it as. I've seen some pretty interesting translations posted to one of the FB groups.   


When drawing, I suggest designing with the end print in mind. Use bold colors and aim for spot colors right off or pencil the design and scan it to add the colors in on the computer design side. I have been known to draw the basic and then color and shade once I vector. Once I have the image in the spot colors I want and with registration marks where I need them to print (minimum 1 at top and 1 at bottom in the middle for lining up on our boards), I turn all the channels to 100C100M100Y100K because our rip uses all of it's 6 cartridges in the all black system. Each time we've sent film to other printers when they've purchased film prints from us because either their printer was down or they weren't sure they would be able to get their printer to print out the halftones, we were able to wow them with how crisp ours was over their previous method. I never realized how varied people had results when we all have similar printers and that our shop does something just a little different that makes such a difference so I've been passing that tip along to get deep black prints."

She’d open both their cages while we were at work, tell me no, limp when she thought people were watching to get me in trouble, etc. the neighbors all knew what she was doing because they saw mountain goat husky on the counter. She got off her lead once and got over to the golf course and was stealing golfers’ balls on the course and “helping” them score by putting them in the holes. Best call I got right there “um hey we think we found your husky, she’s terrorizing the golfers by putting the balls into the holes for them” ok what hole is she at now so I can go grab her before she spreads her good will to more unwilling people? “14th I think? She’s over on the back side close to the old housing but she’s moving quick...” Yeah got to lure the dog off the course that day. Everyone was laughing because she wasn’t mean or anything but wanted to play her own way."
aww,fden31r,t1_fdei3w5,1578342495.0,"See that didn't hold true for our 13 year old boy. His 2 year old measurement was 1 week after his birthday that year at the doctors office and it was 34.0"" which doubled puts him at 68"" / 5'8"" roughly at adult height right? This freaking kid is 5'11"" already as of 12/17 when he went in for leg cramps after running Jr Olympics XC Nationals the week prior. I looked at the nurse and asked her if I was screwed if he's already that tall and he isn't even in high school yet. Pretty sure the answer is yup I'm going to have to look for special shoe sizes now (he's wearing size 14 running shoes). He hasn't finished catching up to his feet size yet on height apparently.   


He went from 47th percentile of his peers on height at age 2 to now he's 98.21th percentile for height of his peers at the same age he is now (he'll be 14 in April)."
bestoflegaladvice,fdel4fc,t1_fdedcsl,1578341331.0,"It is. The itinerary if anyone actually looks it up for Greyhound is 13h 25m from KCMO to Ft Wayne, IN with stops in STL, Indy, and Marion, IN before it arrives in Ft Wayne. This route is not eligible for the unaccompanied minor travel for several reasons. 1. It's too long. and 2. it's a partner station rather than a Greyhound station. It probably didn't get noticed until Indy when that was the last company stop on that line and that's when the company had the cops called and decided to turn the kid around. They should have returned him to city or origin but that's something to take up with Greyhound or why they didn't have the ticketing service disallow the purchase because it doesn't qualify."

Limits the pool of possibilities greatly there. Still at cross country practice where the team is pretty much an ad for Subaru (there’s at least 20 of us strong and all current models except BRZ represented), one of our 11-12 year old boys went to hop into my car instead of his mom’s Hyper Blue crosstrek. My car is a twilight blue Outback that has no color or shape similarities especially since it was morning and we didn’t even park close together. I told him he just wanted to go home with us and continue having fun instead."

If your poly is colored - use poly specific white plastisol ink just as a base then proceed to print the logo on top

The reason I wouldn’t suggest dye sub for any other color fabric is because of color shifting. It sounds like you aren’t sure how to get the logo on it in the first place and might not know how to compensate for any shifting or know that it won’t be a true to color as dye sub can’t add white where it doesn’t exist."
RealEstate,fd2ss4n,t1_fd2qhek,1578151329.0,"I’ve stuck with them for home insurance because they actually rate replacement value at a realistic rate rather than “let’s tell you that you can demo and fully rebuild a 2,200 sqft home that’s code compliant in today’s market in your area for under 200,000 plus fit it on a weird lot layout to contend with that wasn’t there to deal with when building these as a subdivision.” It’s just not realistic. I actually called 5 of the top restoration builders in our area to get normal numbers including one that had rebuilt a house in our neighborhood after a total loss thanks to the federal pacific electrical panels and it was right at 300,000 for a smaller home than ours. No one else would even rate it that high."
RealEstate,fcyzzue,t1_fcyzeru,1578090853.0,That is your opinion. I have had USAA close in under 3 weeks where as a local based national bank that shall remain nameless couldn't close a refi in 2+ months when provided all paperwork and it was an easy close. They had the funds for the appraisal but couldn't even seem to order that one either. Just put us off for even doing the refi for a while after that experience. Went with USAA and it was night and day difference. Wish I had called them first and skipped the national bank that was local.
RealEstate,fcyg4f8,t3_ejfuqr,1578079615.0,"USAA, Navy Fed, or Boeing Fed (if qualify for membership there) for lender as they all understand the area and unique situation for active duty. We used USAA as well as BIL & SIL. We’re in NE and they’re in WA. We both had equally easy experiences with USAA on loans and ease of closing. Yes SIL did have to be on the loan. If your job loss is because of military move and expected time of unemployment is low, they usually count your income from current employer. We experienced that with husband transitioning from military to civilian  when we purchased our home and his income was a little lower but not by much. Remember you don’t have to use the aggressive lender or the lender you start talking to at all. Interview them and let them know you’re trying to find out who fits your situation best. It might not be the first or even 3rd one you talk to either. On our first mortgage it was the 4th that had the right numbers and benefits. On the refi it was the 3rd because the first two lost capability to do VA refis."
RealEstate,fcye6o1,t3_ejhiyh,1578078763.0,I’m surprised your home owners insurance company didn’t pick up on previous claims and ask for evidence of remedies prior to close. Ours did about 14 years ago on a house built in 1978. The only claim filed? 1982 for minor basement flooding in an unfinished basement. Remedy? Sump pump that’s pictured in older listing pictures in a finished closest with a false wall. Fun times right? Our seller was states away from the home but made sure the agent had paperwork for it.
RealEstate,fcycwuz,t1_fcy214u,1578078237.0,"It’s only sold as is if the disclosures are correct. From what OP has already stated, it sounds like the Sellers have materially misrepresented the property in the disclosure and filed a home owners claim for it prior to listing the home for sale/filing the disclosures which is evidence enough to show the sellers were aware of some sort of flooding /water issue in the basement. The scoping of the sewer shows the cause has not been remedied where as they might try to say that they fixed X which was the cause (it wasn’t)."

The contractor didn’t even put the trim flush mounted in some places and one of the bedroom doors doesn’t close and latch fully! This is a contractor well known for flipping properties in the area and I can certainly tell them to steer clear of them now.

UnresolvedMysteries,fcuebl1,t1_fctawv9,1577978931.0,"Doesn’t matter. All base housing is still Federal jurisdiction until it is released to county/local law enforcement. In many cases, annex housing has an agreement for concurrent patrolling to facilitate faster response times to assist in mutual aid to better overall serve the whole. I’ve seen that with every base I’ve been to with off base housing. 

Yes crimes on a federal installation can and do get tried in county/state courts if federal feels it is best heard there. One of the guys I served with and had my own gut feelings about was convicted of multiple sexual assault charges against minors - all committed in base housing that was in the annex portion but OSI felt the county would be a better jurisdiction - he’s currently in state penitentiary for foreseeable future where he belongs. 

Another individual with domestic violence with both wife and him assaulted each other - she hit him first and admitted that to SF who arrived on scene, city who responded as she was a civilian and he was AD, and told the court that? Military court also in annex housing - Wife was never charged and he served 18 months at a military prison as the judge wanted to make an example of him to other members and took into account his grappling training on top of receiving a discharge from the military. It goes both ways and that includes murder investigations. We had a murder - suicide that involved an AD member who killed his spouse then himself while kids were present/nearby because one of the older children called it in and it was heartbreaking to hear that on scanner. All agencies responded because at first no one knew what happened but the community as a whole reached out and helped that family in crisis."
