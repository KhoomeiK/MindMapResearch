AskReddit,ff5piuh,t3_ero8mj,1579604800.0,"I'm still alive! 

I had incredibly bad depression starting around that age so I was sure I wouldn't make it to college. Well, I did and it was only a little better than high school. But I made it past that too so hey, I'm doing something right."
migraine,fezdoad,t1_fexmzbw,1579456260.0,I had an ice cap and it's amazing? Just got for Christmas from my bf and it's one of my top favorites gifts.

Damnthatsinteresting,fedunk2,t1_fedcwj6,1579020259.0,Drugs.com or something like that. You can get coupons for meds and shows you the cheapest pharmacy to use. Saves me so much money. My meds would normally be approx $250-300 and a coupon takes it down to $80.
adhdmeme,fe49h7c,t3_enm96w,1578857028.0,Seriously 3 times today. It'll leave my head and come right back after being on Reddit for a bit. That's enough for today.
ADHD_Programmers,fe48eqc,t3_enjeye,1578856762.0,"Practice. Practice. Practice. You'll get faster at recalling answers and take less time. 

If you can't get an internship, have you looked at local tech shops and/or your schools tech support? If they hire students, you can gain experience that way. Just getting into the field is already a step up from nothing. Any CS experience is good."
EntitledPeople,fe3hax4,t1_fe2ogzh,1578849264.0,"Heck, not a mom, but I do that before work. I order on the bus and when I get there, I can grab my coffee and go. It saves me 10 minutes of waiting. It's only a problem when someone else snatches my drink before I get there, despite having my name on it."
AmItheAsshole,fdrndw2,t1_fdqemi2,1578686929.0,"I'm result of 2 failing as well. If it wasn't for my surprise, my parents wouldn't have stayed together. I like to remind my younger siblings that."
AmItheAsshole,fdlwqa7,t1_fdkva6v,1578534332.0,"Yeeaaa this sounds like your husband could be narcissistic. Only cares about what you get him, what people think of him, whatever is best for him and barely does anything for anyone else unless he has something to gain. 

If he thinks hes not in the wrong here, then yea, he might be a narcissist..."
worldnews,fdde8c6,t1_fdcxsyp,1578308180.0,It still boggles my mind that my dad believes every word this guy says. It's incredibly disappointing and sad. I used to look up to him but now I kind of pity him. I get his reasons financially but that shouldn't be the only thing that matters.
WatchPeopleDieInside,fdcaj3p,t3_ekjoag,1578270373.0,"Yell ""oh dear gosh wtf is that thing?!""

WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fd9zahp,t3_ek8gxe,1578239816.0,"I think it's under appreciated

He's/she's so adorable"
YouShouldKnow,fd9xuwh,t1_fd9osew,1578239335.0,Same!! It actually hurts and makes my eyes water
aww,fd4t91f,t1_fczamyf,1578170861.0,Thank you! It's been a couple years now so it hurts less. Less enough for me to think about getting my own cat. I think I'm going to search for a cat that chooses me.
entitledparents,fd3aewl,t1_fd37mq3,1578156349.0,Stealing money and forgery is illegal. What she deserves is a nice jail cell
aww,fcyv7ra,t1_fcxyth2,1578087800.0,I'm afraid of that! I want a small dog but I'm not sure my apt is good enough for one yet. I could totally make it work if I have a moment like you did but that's also why I won't go volunteer or visit a shelter bc I'd fall in love with a dog that deserves everything.
aww,fcyukpu,t1_fcycxp0,1578087402.0,"They totally do. My friend's cat was a lil turd but really misunderstood. He didn't get a ton of attention so whenever I'd come over, I'd pet that cat til he clawed me. 

One sad day, my dog died, less than a year after my other dog died. Both were sudden and heartbreaking. So this also happened at a busy time for me, I broke down. I was over at my friend's house when I got the call and I broke down on the floor. 

That mean, attention deprived cat wouldn't leave me alone. He was putting and making me pet him. He comforted me... Until he was bored then he went back to being a turd."
TalesFromTheSquadCar,fclbdb9,t1_f9krvpv,1577743911.0,"I believe it. I've been yelled at for faking I work at a store (in uniform bc I was in fact working). The lady's argument was I looked too young to work. I get it. I have a baby face and I wasn't wearing makeup so I looked even younger. But I was 19 and in college at the time. 

The lady refused to believe she was wrong and thankfully the supervisor passed by, came over and handled it. 

Idk there are some people out there who refuse to accept they're wrong or made a mistake. Some just want to pick fights and arguments, cause drama."
adhdwomen,fckysot,t3_ehp3gs,1577736099.0,"
I also have some anxiety so it's comforting when my bfs sleeps with me. Sometimes though, I barely sleep or I sleep rough. Luckily, my bfs and I have different work and sleep schedules. I work days, he works nights."
Bad_Cop_No_Donut,fcit0wg,t1_fcirh0w,1577669110.0,Nope. They were cleared of all charges apparently. So freaking frustrating.
TalesFromYourServer,fc7k3wy,t1_fc7641q,1577509980.0,That's when I admit I have them a different number bc I don't like them and they can fuck right off
Celiac,fc2vss3,t3_efqbuu,1577375373.0,"I need this. I did this all Christmas. ""Can I just check the label? What's the recipe for that? What ingredients did you use? Did they have the gf seal of approval?""

My family was amazing this year and I didn't get glutened at all! I had plenty to eat and felt so loved. Amazing progress"
Minecraft,fc2uems,t1_fc2suht,1577374325.0,This is awesome to know bc I have and played Minecraft on my raspberry pi. I've been debating on turning it into a magic mirror but I think I'll wait and play Minecraft again on it. I love python too so this will be fun to play around with.
AskReddit,fc07750,t1_fc01h0g,1577281499.0,I have to keep my gluten free bread in the fridge or else it will mold within a couple days. It used to seem strange to me but now it's necessary
entitledparents,fbzmnvp,t1_fbz1ze0,1577251963.0,"If only there were a Kingsman and a microchipped phone that, when activated, would send the Kingsman into a mad frenzy inside a large banquet hall filled with members of that ""church""."
LifeProTips,fbxw3nz,t3_eevtso,1577202031.0,"My mom currently has my siblings on Life360. The only time I'll ever join that is when I am on dangerous roads or in an area I don't know, alone. Then if my car breaks down, she'll know exactly where I am. 

Other than that, my family doesn't need to know if stay home all the time and only leave to go to work and taco Bell."
HumansBeingBros,fbxvjac,t1_fbxle9i,1577201619.0,9:30am here and the tears are streaming.
mildlyinteresting,fbxv848,t1_fbxmzbs,1577201392.0,Moooole
ADHD,fbxn1sq,t3_eetbyw,1577194486.0,"Ya know, I never associated that with ADHD but it does make a ton of sense. My bfs doesn't do that and he can follow along just fine. I need the subtitles to stay focused on the movie. Which is funny because it's more to pay attention to."
Minecraft,fblke1m,t1_fbknr97,1576964307.0,It looks like you can see a tiny bit of it in the dungeon mob spawner pic in the link to his Minecraft world
