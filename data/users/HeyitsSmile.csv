And Scott/Phone Guy wouldn't be able to be the phone guy in the first few FNAFs. I always just say that Vincent is Micheal Afton's kid, Mike is just a bald guy (or maybe there was another animatronic  instance later on) and PG is the phone guy for whatever location they work at. Other than that, Fritz and Jeremy don't need changing, really.

maybe there aren't as many good ones around anymore. I recently came back to the fandom a few months ago, so I guess the good ones left with the rest of the fandom when the hype died down.

fivenightsatfreddys,fenyr39,t1_fenxese,1579292754.0,"Glitchtrap/Springtrap is the main murderer, the nightmares are literal *nightmares*, the funtimes were built by Afton, and Scrap Baby is a funtime, and thus shouldn't be excluded from that line-up. These are all exclusively evil characters because they have to be evil for story purposes. Also, Scrap Baby/Elizabeth is evil in particular because she's a vengeful dead kid in a robot body, hence the ending of Pizzeria Sim.

My character would appear in the FNAF 1 and 2 locations, probably as a toy animatronic, along side they main 4, or rather.. the main.. 12? If you count the Toys and the OGs, plus BB, Marionette and Goldie. She doesn't have a child in her belly, and thus has no intention on being near the night guard. The other animatronics are haunted by the dark reminent of angry dead children who think that Micheal (The guy you play as) looks a lot like William (The murderer/Mike's father)."

fivenightsatfreddys,feno7q1,t1_fenndcu,1579288467.0,"It was a stylistic choice, mostly because it's supposed to resemble poster art, like what they would use to promote her at the restaurant. Her actual reference sheet has her looking very animatronic-like.
Edit: Also, I know, the color palette is pretty offensive. I've been thinking about making her grey, but what's the fun in realistically colored animals when you can just burn people's retinas?"
fivenightsatfreddys,fenmuz0,t3_eq4ra3,1579288032.0,"Sorry, dark mode users, for this being so bright! She was gonna be in Foxy's color palette originally, but I thought that encroached on Foxy too much, especially since she would be in the same pizzeria as him in whatever AU she exists in. It was second best in the colors department, since she didn't look good as purple.. or blue.. or green... Psh, who needs subtle color? I may like my dreary, saturated tones, but they don't fit her. Do you guys have any color suggestions for her?

I wanna emphasize that she is an animatronic, but is in an antho style for this particular piece. Thank you!

Edit: Also, yeah, she looks like she came from FNAC. She's a bobcat instead of a regular cat, if it does her any justice. I just... Like cats."

fivenightsatfreddys,felxo14,t3_epkbwr,1579233550.0,"Gosh, Scott is sweet. I saw a lot of these posts around christmas, so it's a few people who got these packages back. This, along side his consistent donations, plus the big dono to St Jude with MatPat and Mark and them, are all examples of his generosity and genuine care for his fans.

FNAF was a last ditch effort at programming, with Scott saying in Dawko's interview he was going to go to a different job if FNAF flopped, because he had a family to take care of, and programming wasn't exactly doing wonders. He's doing his best to give back, because we all gave in his time of need.

Edit: I hope that if I become a popular programmer, I'll be able to do a fraction of what Scott does. This man is like a god-sent, tbh :). Sorry for all the Scott praise. Its just.. FNAF came out at a dark time for me, and really helped me make friends."
