I'm telling you that Hunters only OHK is also a single ability in a single tree. By your own logic, hunters deserve a OHK grenade. Titans one hit requires you to be directly in front of them. Worse than HHSN. If you can't use it as well as others use their OHK, you're just not a great player. Sorry, but there's no other reason. Also wtf is a spikewall? You mean spike nade or voidwall?

DestinyTheGame,fgelzwq,t3_exe1ve,1580702866.0,"Amazing post with incredible ideas. Only thing I'd change is a thought I had not too long ago. That would be to expand the factions of the last city. Allow people's choice to side with the Vanguard or Drifter grant them rewards in the form of making these organizations their own factions. Shaxx as well should have faction functionality. I'd love to earn some redjack armor for my Hunter.

Opens us up for more interesting gear sets too. Something I mentioned when I made my post about factions, for the Vanguard, a set of armor reminiscent of what Ikora's Hidden might use. Maybe a Cayde-6 memorial set for Hunters. Full Last City military set might be cool. Similar to what Zavala wears, but slightly toned down. Maybe some enhanced versions to earn for each. Redjack sets would get a flashy upgrade. Something for the Vanguard sets to signify a military rank up. This entire second paragraph could use some more thought actually, so I'll stop here.

apexlegends,ffptta9,t1_ffpneik,1580105454.0,"Considering the base game and most activities are free to play now it's not bad. I wouldn't pay for Shadowkeep (most recent), but Forsaken is worth it. I'd only get Shadowkeep or the season passes if you play a decent amount and enjoy the game. And Forsaken mostly for the exotics it unlocks for you. As a solely PvP player, I can say the game stays relatively exciting as long as you have weapons to play around with.

DestinyTheGame,ffpt23z,t1_ffplwpv,1580104659.0,"Really? I literally only play what I want and I make level 100 of the season pretty quick. I never felt that it was a checklist of chores to get done, and I often ignored activities right up until the next weekly reset. It comes down to the person. If you feel like you have to get absolutely everything done, this isn't the game for you. Not that it couldn't be made fresher with some more content for each aspect of gameplay. 

I just find that I enjoy the game less when everyone complains about how they have to get everything done. This usually leads to people whining to make activities they don't like easier, which ruins those activities for people who enjoy them. Iron Banner is one that I constantly bitch about. Because every time I see a post, people whine about how it takes more than a single gaming session to complete bounties. I personally enjoy the IB grind and will happily play it all week. When I can earn my pinnacles on 2 characters in a day with only a slightly longer gaming session than normal, there's no reason to. Though I still play all week, there's nothing for me to really earn.

The issue is less defined than people may think is all I mean I guess. This game would be a lot better if each kind of activity was equally rewarding. This way people wouldn't feel like they have to get everything done. As well as leaving players like me something to actually earn."

Also if a Hunters dodge is enough for you to lose them, you've engaged too closely.

Also I play on 10 sensitivity, and like I said, no trouble tracking. And if the battery bothers you, there's an exotic that does the exact same thing, except that doesn't cost you a large amount of mod slots.

And if movement is an issue, how about the fact that without an exotic (stompees) *and* a lightweight frame Hunters can't compete with the other classes. Without either, Hunters are definitively slower. Both other classes have jumps and other abilities to boost speed and movement. Hunters can't outrun a half decent Titan or Warlock moving towards them, often leading to death by shotgun, even with 100 mobility. Also can't outrun most roaming supers, if any.

Your only argument against Hunters is the most invalid argument there is. Hunters don't have nearly the movement advantage people seem to think. It's why I stopped playing the class, and am now using a Warlock. Top tree solar is by far the most mobile class to play."

These rewards would be meant for the PvP players. Not the ones that couldn't benefit from it. The whole point of this change would be to make it more rewarding. Give us something to grind for.
