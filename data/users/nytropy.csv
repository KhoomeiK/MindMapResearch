Let your characters notice or collect something that at the current point in the story seems insignificant but is later used and contributes to the main plot.

Sometimes books give this impression that  everything the MC did was purposeful and well thought out. But life doesn’t work like. It’s the in-betweens where a lot of life happens. So I try to use them for it."

I wonder if that is the human nature no matter what (to turn everything to the worst possible purpose) or is some of it down to historical circumstances.

Lets take penicillin as a simple example - how many lives and suffering did it save? Many scientists have worked with the good of humankind in mind, some refused to patent their discoveries for moral reasons. There were scientists who tested their theories and drugs on themselves because they were at odds with the popular believes of their times. Is it the fault of the scientific community that the big pharma is a money grabbing monster? 

And even aside from medical advances, I for once find a motivation to continue living in the fact that there are little advancements in our understanding of the universe every day. We’re just mud pigs looking up at the stars but if it wasn’t for that seemingly pointless effort of looking up, we would be just mud pigs.

This is prob way too bright-eyed and naive for this sub but I don’t think science and progress is inherently bad, it’s the wider system we’re operating from that’s rotten."
