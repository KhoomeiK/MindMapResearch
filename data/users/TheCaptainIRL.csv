But sure, r/woooosh"
PewdiepieSubmissions,ffienxd,t1_fficzk1,1579972060.0,I’m reading over the comments and don’t get any joke. But it’s early
PokemonGoSpoofing,ffddw75,t1_ffddc3z,1579818825.0,A year ago or so I had a spoofer that would sometimes count “steps” or distance and sometimes not. Well my work just happens to involve walking around 15 miles some days. So I would have liked to have the adventure sync in that circumstance
Boruto,ff6a7oa,t1_ff65e9m,1579622738.0,I’m hoping from what we’ve seen so far that doesn’t happen. At this point in the manga and anime Sakura was already hated so here’s fingers crossed they keep him likeable

Unexpected,feei4q0,t1_feehwyr,1579034219.0,"So a batter has 2 strikes, foul tips it and the catcher misses. What’s the call?"
Unexpected,fecmj0a,t1_fecm5sk,1578977608.0,Now I’ve never experienced what’s happening in the video. Just the rule on tipped catches lmao
Unexpected,fecly3i,t1_feclvp9,1578977184.0,"There is a rule specific to tipped balls. Check my other reply for a description of the rule :)
I had no idea it was a little known rule"
Unexpected,fecluwn,t1_feclseg,1578977119.0,If the batter were to pop the ball up in the air and the catcher caught it they would be out by the rule you were originally thinking of.
Unexpected,feclgr8,t1_feclbb1,1578976837.0,Yes. With the exception of what is called a foul-tip. It’s when the batter tips the ball when swinging so slightly that the catcher is still able to catch it. If the batter has 2 strikes already it counts as strike 3. If they have one or no strikes it’s only counted as a missed swing and not a foul ball in the terms of being an out or not
Unexpected,feckem0,t1_fechh06,1578976064.0,Only if there were 2 preexisting strikes. Otherwise even if the catcher caught it it’s still a strike not out
