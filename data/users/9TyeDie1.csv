AskReddit,ffedsvw,t3_et5wmp,1579844319.0,"Not any more but Ive  done it. I never should have said hello, I was young and desperate to not be alone. Often I wouldn't have another friend (grew up next to an apartment building, one or two kids at a time but not for long) so it was bear them or have no friends. Though most of them sucked anyway. The kind of person who has bad ideas and doesn't think ahead before executing them, then looking at you to help clean it up. Then there are the backstabbing two-faced variety that I long since gave up on."

Our country does have a prison problem though."
