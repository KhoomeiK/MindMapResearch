RocketLeague,ffdmf20,t3_eszb9n,1579823985.0,What a horrible player. I've seen a lot of these dudes out there and I call them crappers.
RocketLeague,ffbgbln,t1_ffber1a,1579764031.0,Multiple other games have online rigged matchmaking to make the players feel a sense of pride and accomplishment when the MM system finally lets them move up the ladder. It would not surprise me at all to learn Psyonix has been rigging the game since the beginning.

RocketLeague,ff0twpy,t1_ff0992s,1579472265.0,I believe the Dominus hitbox matches the graphics of the car better so it's easier on the eyes. The octane is a little weird and sometimes you think you're hitting the ball with the front but you end up hitting it with the wheels because the graphics and the hitbox don't match.

RocketLeague,feuptng,t3_eqkw8l,1579388853.0,It's just the old item exploit thing where you can generate items to scam people but the items don't actually work. You can see the other's dude car in the main window but it doesn't work in-game.

RocketLeague,fdzwgqr,t3_eng21v,1578797459.0,"Nobody wants to play their rank, that's why there are massive holes in the ranking system. 

Your friend should be playing C2 games (or deranking to C1) but he's not because he's partied up with you. Where are the low C3s that would give you a ""better"" matchmaking experience? Nowhere to be seen. Why?  Because just like your friend, they're not playing their rank and they're playing with a GC friend, getting GC games."
