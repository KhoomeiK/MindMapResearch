Oh yes, assuming the dancer is ok with it, but that's usually how they get paid lots of money; they allow men to feel up their breasts and the rest of body while they rub their hips on the guy's groin.

> Do gentlemen’s clubs require that he accompany me because I am a girl?

Sometimes.  They might assume you're a jealous wife or a prostitute trying to entice the customers.  Some clubs might let you in though but just be aware of the reasons they might not.

>Are strippers allowed to touch their clients like that one girl did for me?

Only if you consent to it.  I don't know what state you're in so I don't know the local laws.

>Am I allowed to touch them if they tell me I can? I’ve heard that isn’t allowed?

So when you do get to touch a stripper, it feels naughty, like she's breaking the rules for your benefit so you're more likely to tip her well.  It's in the best interest of the strippers for people to think that everything's off limits so that you pay more to convince her to break the rules with you."

Root canals are probably the worst of the three but only because they take so long.  It's easy to keep your numb mouth open for 15 minutes but it gets really annoying when you're doing it for over an hour.  There's some pain in your gums for about 6 hours after the numbness wears off but you can simply control it with some Ibuprofen.  However, there's a soreness in your jaw that will last a few days afterwards from having your mouth open for so long.

You have options to get sedated if you want or even get some Nitrous Oxide (I think that's the gas they used) which was fun.

His betting might go up or down from there (from $75 all the way up to $900 or so).
