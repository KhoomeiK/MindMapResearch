When I woke up, I was in a lot of pain, but the worst part was every time I sat up, I'd get the hiccups. Those were painful, my body would uncontrollably jolt and send serious pain through my head and neck. 


This happened over and over as I was recovering. To add insult to injury I was unable to urinate, because I was so tense. I'd get up, get the hiccups and sit in the toilet trying to relax enough to pee.  After several hours the two nurses had no choice but to give me a catheter.
