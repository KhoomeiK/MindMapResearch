My point is that they’re trying to convince themselves and others that it’s perfectly healthy to be obese. I can only think of one benefit to being obese and that’s being able to survive a famine a lot longer than the average person. Then again, people like this love warping statistics"

badteachers,fcx1q5e,t3_ej3exv,1578047328.0,"My second grade substitute teacher (my original teacher had a baby and this sub was there for most of the year from the beginning of the school year until almost the end of it) seemed to really hated me for some reason. My memory isn’t the greatest, so some details may be fuzzy, but 2 things in particular stand out to me.

One time, somebody was talking about the middle finger or something and I did it (not knowing how rude of a gesture it was.. I was maybe 7 at the time) and I unknowingly told my entire class to fuck off. 

Some kid went to go get the teacher and I was trying to apologize before he ran down the hall to get her. An important thing to note, I have a very difficult time trying to apologize to people, especially authority figures (and I think it may be because of my autism). 

So the teacher came back and didn’t even explain anything to me. She just yelled at me to apologize, and like I said earlier, I didn’t know what I had to apologize for, as far as I was concerned, I was apologizing for something harmless. She didn’t let us go for something (I can’t remember what it was) until I coughed up an apology. All of the attention was on me for 15 minutes, maybe a half hour, and that put even more pressure on me (didn’t have anxiety back then, I was just really shy). She didn’t even care that I was sobbing

The second instance was with a test. We apparently had to write the answers in one of the two boxes (it was a matching question) and I ended up drawing a line from the word to the box that they belonged in. I went to go hand it in and she (once again) yelled at me and didn’t explain anything in a calm tone. I didn’t cry from the experience (that I can remember) but I do know that I at least teared up"

But if a woman loves you, dick size *shouldn’t* matter (but that’s all some women care about and there’s really nothing you can do about it)

Edit: that is not to say that you shouldn’t change yourself, and you can’t just blame everything on your looks (it has a little bit to do with it, but that’s more of a first impression, and you should probably lose the weight before it really becomes a problem (aka: obesity)) but the biggest factor is your personality.
