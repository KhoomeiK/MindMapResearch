Which I got the SD Tool version 1.1 and apparently it is junk so I need to order another one which is only sold by Weekend Modder it seems which his store is down and on top of all of that I had to buy a Post Fix Adapter which took almost a month to get here (to the US) from Malaysia. Mine is a Corona V2 4GB. Some V2 require the post fix. Mine has 4gb (or supposed to; more like 3) of internal memory that is practically useless.

PlaystationClassic,few5iim,t1_few3nb6,1579405703.0,PSP and Vita rocked. If they'd have correctly marketed they could have been more groundbreaking with more exciting titles. ~~Vita~~ **PSP** actually outsold the ~~DS~~ **3DS** *(edited for the cry babies)*. Handhelds as a whole have been basically phased out with how easy it is to create something from a Raspberry Pi and Android phones already possessing the power. DS & 3DS certainly weren't winners in my book. Nor has been the Switch. I guess if Microsoft had a console I wouldn't be too excited for it either simply because I'm not real into any of these new generation games. Sony really had nothing that stood out on the PSP or Vita but they were definitely powerhouses for their time. Vita pretty much still is even though commercial development for it is dead.
