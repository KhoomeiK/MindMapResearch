AskAnAmerican,fgkcwo9,t1_fgk6zqy,1580862640.0,"Fix why people want to commit suicide instead of fixing the how. How someone could do it doesn’t matter if they don’t want to do it.  
  
If a kid is struggling in school, you don’t just say “Hey, if we just give him an A+ on every assignment, that fixes everything! Now he’ll pass his classes and go on to college and be successful”, because we know that kid is still going to have problems, even if we artificially “fix” his poor grades. It’d be better to figure out WHY he’s struggling and fix that — better study habits, better family life, tutor to help with homework and studying, or whatever method appears best.  
  
But taking a gun away from a suicidal person (although I agree, that’s good), doesn’t fix their want to suicide. They’ll still be depressed and miserable. Get them counseling, anti-depressants, or whatever is the best thing to help them."

help,fg7ipzp,t1_fg7a8zi,1580593489.0,"It certainly would be quite possible to do that. Just save an instance of “u/RS702” with “<550329>” or something like that, then when it’s read from the DB do a lookup and change it to whatever my username is. 550329 would be my userID in this example.  
  
Then again, that might take up more resources than reddit wants and it’s far easier to just say no you can’t change your username."

Although I like the idea another commenter made about watching/listening to an abridged version. I actually tried watching it earlier, but it seemed like Adam Schiff was going on and on and on so I kinda tuned out."
