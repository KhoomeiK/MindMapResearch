politics,ffdvwwf,t1_ffcp6sv,1579830245.0,"The Militia isn't just a random bunch of yahoos with guns who decide on their own to form a group... or at least, it wasn't back then. The Militia was what you got when it was *required by law* that every able bodied male maintain a state of military readiness, and that includes regulations requiring military drills every Saturday, and readiness to muster at any time the lawful authorities required it.

Mostly this was just a hated burden the peasants were only too eager to be relieved of. This changed as a result of the English Civil War, when the wide availability of firearms and military capabilities allowed locals to protect their property from *both* sides of the civil war, by being able to be a thorn in the side of whichever side menaced them most, and aid the other side. Both Cromwell and Charles had to tread carefully so as not to upset the locals. This was widely regarded as a Good Thing, and enshrined the Militia as a beloved institution in the English speaking world.

This is why the Militia was regarded as necessary for the protection of a *free* state. You can secure a state just fine with a professional army, but the Militia could do double duty, both being able to play a role in protecting the country from external threats, without presenting the same internal threat that relying entirely on a profesional army would.

But again, it did so *under government authority*. Militiamen are just more likely to say ""no"" than a professional army if given undesirable orders.

The second part, guaranteeing a right to keep and bare arms, was simply America's answer to a question that had been a controversial matter in England: should people be required to store their arms in a central armory, or should they be allowed to keep them at home? The Second Amendment comes down on the side of allowing people to keep them, and bear them in a lawful fashion.

Personally, rather than ""gun control"", I would favor legislation declaring that ownership of a firearm was synonymous with membership in the Militia, explicitly directing state governments to draw up regulations that ensure the following in a fashion palatable to local customs: the securement of firearms in the home, the maintenance of the firearm, and the maintenance of marksmanship (along with any other related skill the State deemed necessary) gun safety, and readiness to respond to emergency under the direction of the appropriate authority. Any individual who failed to observe these regulations could be disciplined under said Militia regulations, and even be ejected from the Militia (following due process), thus losing the privilege of keeping and bearing arms."

CrusaderKings,ff427ha,t3_erimnz,1579553936.0,"Everyone else that has posted so far [is wrong](https://ck2.paradoxwikis.com/Attributes#Improving_attributes), assuming Conclave is active. If it is *not* active, a character's base stats come from their guardian. So just invite some genius to educate them, and they'll get good stats.

If Conclave is active, the child's base stats, once grown up, will be influenced by the stats of both parents. So a parent with higher base stats will tend to have a child with higher base stats.

That's why I personally think the most important thing to pay attention to, particularly if you don't have control over which child will inherit your titles, is the base stats of the parents. Genetic traits are helpful, sometimes very helpful. But they can also conceal low base stats. There's no guarantee your firstborn is going to inherit your wife's genius trait, but he is likely to inherit her low base stats, if all her stats come from traits. 

That said, if you *do* have control, genetic traits are great. And there are a lot of ways to control it. Muslims do it by granting land. Buddhists can control it directly, of course, and Christians can adopt ultimogeniture, join a monastic order, and just take a vow of celibacy once they have that genius child they've been waiting for.

Problem is, Anakin never went through youngling school. He was ""too old to begin the training"".

AskScienceFiction,fezlkrv,t1_fetnut8,1579458647.0,"I think the start is to simply treat them with respect, to take *their own wishes* into account. And if it is their desire to serve, then let them serve. But treat them with respect within that context. Don't abuse them. Don't yell at them, or punish them for minor mistakes and such.

Let their environment of service be a *safe* one, such that they become comfortable enough to speak their minds when necessary. Heck, from the perspective of a master, *order* them to speak their minds, when they believe their master to be in error, since that can, in fact, be a great service, to one who is willing to listen.

And if asking them for their wishes causes them anxiety... don't ask. Just pay attention, and then *secretly* fulfill them. Let them come around to the idea that they're allowed to have their own desires, even in Master's presence, slowly, so as to avoid the trauma.

Perhaps, over enough generations of this sort of treatment, they'll have become accustomed, at the very least, to better working conditions, and will perhaps be more inclined to insist upon the conditions to which they've now become accustomed."

He could use his super strength for moving heavy objects, but his big advantage is his ability to climb. I *could* see this being useful in any number of areas, but his training as a scientist suggests a particular use.

Imagine being able to place a camera *anywhere*. Without any special equipment, without any lengthy, dangerous procedures. What would take a normal human hours (including prep time), he could do in a matter of minutes, and could do it *safely*. So anything of interest to science that could be found out by sticking a camera somewhere, he can stick it there, no issues whatsoever.

This assumes, of course, we're going with the usual version of Spider Man, whose web comes from a technological device. If we're going with the version from those movies in the early 2000s, then probably his best bet is to just become a spider silk cow. Just milk himself as much as he can stand, and hand the threads over to the highest bidders. Spider silk rope. Spider silk clothes. Spider silk armor, and parachutes, and all kinds of things. Spider silk would be ridiculously useful, if human beings could use it."
AskScienceFiction,fezec60,t3_eqxia1,1579456488.0,"Superman would suffer from too many potential choices. Dude could literally do anything. But given he's demonstrated the ability to do incredibly complex tasks incredibly fast, I think the thing he might make the most money at is construction. 

Dude could probably put together an entire skyscraper by himself in a matter of minutes. Super strength for moving I-beams. Heat vision for welding. X-ray vision allows him to verify things behind things. Super speed would allow him not only to assemble it incredibly quickly, but to literally transport the material to the site on his own. And he's invulnerable, which means he's not an any risk whatsoever if something goes wrong. No need to slow things down keeping things OSHA compliant. (OSHA couldn't even show up in time to see the violations, let alone cite him for it.)

The only thing he'd have to stop for is to allow the foundation to harden. And his combination of heat vision and frost breath would allow it to harden at the *perfect* temperature; no weather variations. (And he *might* be able to forego concrete altogether, instead quarrying out massive stones the likes of which were found at Baalbek)."

AskScienceFiction,fez8ht0,t1_feu9poh,1579454806.0,"> Why would anyone want him to? He was a monster.

One of the great truths of the universe is that there's no such thing as monsters. We are all but men. There is nothing *special* about men who create great evils; they are made from the same stuff as the rest of us.

Vader believed he was *trapped* in his evil. That he could never turn back from the path of darkness he had slipped onto. And so he continued to do evil, well past the point where he *could have stopped*, if it had occurred to him to do so, if he believed anyone could ever forgive him.

Luke offered him that forgiveness. Vader took him up on that offer. Then he *ended Palpatine's reign of tyranny*. Luke could not have done that. Hell, *Yoda* proved incapable of doing that. Palpatine was simply too powerful to be overpowered, too perceptive and cautious to be caught unaware. But Vader did a thing that nobody except Luke, *not even Vader, himself* until that very moment, not Yoda, not Obi-Wan, believed could be done. He turned away from the Dark Side, for the sake of Love, and destroyed the closest thing to a monster that can actually exist.

Sidious and Vader were an evil that could not be defeated from without. They could only be defeated from within. Sidious was defeated by Vader. Vader was defeated, ultimately, by Anakin.

The reason this is *important* is because many, *if not most* people persist in evil because they do not see a point to stopping. They've already crossed that moral event horizon. Nobody starts evil because they think, ""Hey, wouldn't it be awesome to be evil?"" It begins in a moment of impaired judgement, or mistaken ideas, or even by accident. In Anakin's case, it was love and grief that pushed him over the edge that first time. The second time, it was justice and guilt, a desire not to *repeat* the sin he'd committed with Count Dooku, earlier in the film. And that second time resulted in the death of a Jedi, the apparent choosing of a side. Having chosen his side, he thought he had little choice but to make the best of it.

Had he known that forgiveness was possible, even for him, he could have turned back from that path. There are, I think, a lot of people that, if they knew that forgiveness was possible, would turn from their path. A great deal of evil that is committed would not be committed. The world would be a better place.

Vader's redemption might seem like a violation of that need for vengeance we all carry with us. But it also provides an example, a source of hope for those would stop, if they believed they could. To paraphrase Rocky Balboa (Rocky IV), If Vader can change, then anyone can change. And so those who might have otherwise reached Vader's point might, perhaps, not.

Confession. Repentance. Forgiveness. We all make mistakes. This is the only path of light available to humans. And it must be available to all, or else it is available to none, and we are all doomed."
