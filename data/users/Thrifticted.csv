Those racers (or others who do tractor pulls) run the engine super rich so it has every bit of fuel it needs. For some guy driving around town in his pavement princess, grocery getter truck, there's no need for that extra fuel, meaning it's improperly tuned for the conditions it's being used."

Also the exhaust broke off right at the exhaust manifold and was never fixed. It sounded like driving a monster truck around.
