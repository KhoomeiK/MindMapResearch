Plus the leaves were localized to the inside of the canopy, which could mean it's either dead, dying, or some leaves persist through winter. It's very hard to be sure. I see growth habits like that when a tree's roots were damaged during install and/or the tree should have been pruned back when planted; both very common for trees planted in a location like that, by the type of crews who plant boulevard trees.

Wellthatsucks,ffh08yf,t1_ffgyxwj,1579919640.0,It would certainly add needless wear and tear to the engine. Cold oil doesn't move/lubricate as well. A cold engine will also be less fuel efficient because it has to move through all that cold oil.

trashy,ff9t552,t1_ff9lva9,1579720694.0,"Yes I'm certain those guys know how to properly tune a diesel. And I appreciate the link but that didn't mention anything about rolling coal. It only showed engines rolling coal when under heavy load/the most extreme conditions an engine is ever exposed to. Those racers (or others who do tractor pulls) run the engine super rich so it has every bit of fuel it needs. For some guy driving around town in his pavement princess, grocery getter truck, there's no need for that extra fuel, meaning it's improperly tuned for the conditions it's being used."
trashy,ff9l00x,t1_ff9j8k6,1579715218.0,"The consensus on the internet is if you're rolling coal, you're running it too rich. If you're not pulling something heavy there's no reason for your injectors to be dumping that much diesel. Can you send me a link proving otherwise? I drive a 6.5 td k3500 so I'm not just some blithering hippie idiot when it comes to diesel engines"

Also the exhaust broke off right at the exhaust manifold and was never fixed. It sounded like driving a monster truck around. Also the exhaust vented right into the cab, so if you didn't keep the windows down, you'd get light headed. Kinda a shame we don't have emissions testing here in MN. Oh also the brakes hardly worked so you'd have to rely mostly on engine braking."
