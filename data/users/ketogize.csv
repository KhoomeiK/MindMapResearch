fatlogic,ffegj9f,t3_et4oms,1579847136.0,"As someone who is doing keto and remembers all too well how bad the initial phase of glycogen depletion/pre ketone production is... why on EARTH would you subject yourself to this awful yoyo-ing? Also, the only way she lost 60lbs in a month is if she lost and regained the same couple lbs of water weight over and over (usually going on keto makes you lose a couple lbs of water immediately after starting), and only counted the losses but not the gains."
fatlogic,ffbd1vs,t3_esos5i,1579760225.0,"I held on to this kind of belief for sooooo long and honestly it’s a hindrance to your health. No one is saying work out like Serena Williams or the Rock or Usain Bolt on day one, you legitimately cannot do it. But there’s something to be said for pushing yourself to the point of failure once in a while. Some activity may not appeal to you (like me, I despise running even though I’ve tried so hard and so many times to like it and to do it and I absolutely loathe it and inevitably give up a few weeks into training), but I find it hard to believe that NO ACTIVITY EVER is fun for you. Maybe lifting! Or hiking! Or swimming! Or dancing! Or even yoga - but then you gotta push yourself to reach further and achieve more. Yes your hamstrings will burn or you’ll get out of breath - but that’s the point. There is joy (like, chemically. Endorphins are a powerful thing) in pushing yourself against and then past the wall. Exercise is excellent for your mental health. Again, don’t do the thing that you legitimately find torturous, but you don’t get to put all exercise in the torturous category. Then you’re just making excuses."

I’m not a huge fan of dosa tbh so I’ve never tried. But some of her other recipes are good! As for sambhar, masoor dal is the lowest carb dal there is, maybe you can try making sambhar with that?"
fatlogic,ff6k6j5,t1_ff601q8,1579628945.0,"The first 55 or so lbs of my weight loss were achieved with 0 exercise. Since I’ve started exercising I’ve lost an additional 10-11lbs but that took me several months to achieve and I still needed to eat healthy and low calorie. I’m still trying to lose weight but I know between diet and exercise if I had to give one up to achieve my weight loss, I’d give up exercise."
loseit,ff5d7p2,t3_erl82o,1579588022.0,"The chances are that you will probably lose the boobs as you were small chested earlier, as other posters have said. However, anecdotally speaking, my body shape currently is completely different from my body shape the last time I was around this weight or a bit heavier (my boobs are bigger and my waist is smaller). I don’t know what the scientific rationale might be, but it happened to me. At 18 I was around 72-73kg and I was a 34C and pant size 30-31in. Now at 25 I am around 67kg and I’m a 34DD and pant size 27-28in. This might be because my boobs were still growing when I was 18. So you might just have to stick to your weight loss plans and see how you end up! I did lose some boob from my fattest btw (I was a 36DD at my fattest) but I’m quite happy with how much I’ve ended up with. I still have another 10kg to lose though, so they might disappear."
fatlogic,ff561jy,t3_eqhfl0,1579581242.0,"I’ve consistently been to the gym 4-5 times a week for a couple months now, and it shows. Working out was the last bastion of “healthy fit girl behaviour” I needed to conquer and I feel like I’m getting close to getting over that mental hurdle. I’m still usually one of the most useless people in a class - gassing out after 2 circuits when everyone else manages to do at least 3 before flopping down like a beached sea slug - but the 2 circuits are better than the 1 that I was barely capable of doing a month ago. 

And last week there was a new girl at the gym who struggled even more than I did in the class I was doing with her and it made me feel so much better! Not because she was struggling but because it puts into perspective how it’s just a cycle and it always sucks being the newbie but if you stick with it, you WILL get there - all the other insanely fit girls also started somewhere! 

And you can’t argue with the results - the tyres on my back are almost gone, so I look a lot better in backless dresses, and I tried on this formal skirt (non stretch fabric, made to measure) that used to fit fine under the navel last year January and is now at least 2 inches loose, so will need to be altered before I can wear it again! The scale has decided it’s not budging but I can see my body getting smaller and that’s enough for now!!"
fatlogic,ff2grdx,t1_fezvr8c,1579505445.0,"It’s such a weirdly narcissistic viewpoint as well, to think that every social interaction is so calculated and coded with multiple meanings. Chill, you’re not that important. No one is. People don’t put this kind of energy into every person they meet unless they actively feed off drama, and frankly not even then. Life’s too big and too exhausting on it’s own, thanks."
fatlogic,fewc6pf,t1_fesjvtz,1579408236.0,"I really like this theory! I was at roundabout 31.something BMI when I was 19 and when my weight continued to creep up over the next 3 years, I got to a point where I basically stopped getting my period at 22 (BMI near 40) and my doctor told me that I was heading full tilt to T2 (especially because it seems to be genetically predominant in my family, almost everyone regardless of lifestyle and weight has T2 on one side, that they developed in their 40-60s) within a few years, my hba1c was already approaching/at insulin resistant levels. I lost a ton of weight and switched to a low carb lifestyle to keep it away as long as possible and to get my period back, and at last check according to my doctor it shouldn’t be a problem till I’m in my 50s at the earliest, since my hba1c is back to normal levels."
ketorecipes,fely4s5,t1_felxiyd,1579233904.0,"There are tons of other keto friendly indian entrees though! I wasn’t sure if you were implying that only butter chicken/paneer is keto friendly or not but just in case that’s what you meant, there’s lots of others you can eat :) (palak paneer, kadhai chicken/paneer, chicken/mutton fry, shorshe maach, tandoori chicken, paneer tikka, malai tikka etc and this is just what you can get off a restaurant menu. There’s several other home style options!)"
fatlogic,fe06nlg,t1_fdx172r,1578804418.0,"I don’t think it’s okay to shit on her for existing. She’s an artist and she does her thing and she seems to be more of “unapologetically fat” than “fat activist” which is totally fine. It’s not her fault she got turned into this HAES icon or whatever. 

Though the point of my comment is that I really don’t like her music haha. I thought it was funny that the first time I heard a song of hers I had the same thought you did in reverse (I genuinely can’t imagine liking her music). But I really don’t like hip hop or “talking instead of singing” type music in English except for very specific songs from the 90s and early 00s, and pretty much exclusively listen to jazz or indie folk. It truly is amazing how different music tastes can be."
xxketo,fe05eu7,t1_fe02vkb,1578803485.0,"I’ve lost a couple sizes on my feet since my fattest - like 1-2 sizes depending on the brand. I actually can’t wear my old shoes now because I pitch out of them while walking which is really scary when it’s high heels and you’re on stairs. Your bones stay the same, but the fat cap on top and on the sides goes away."
xxketo,fdxd5o4,t1_fdxbjq1,1578767615.0,"If you already do OMAD, you might find it even easier to fast tbh. You might need to shift your meal times around a bit, but the idea then becomes that you eat 6 days a week and you don’t eat 1 day a week. Then you’ll be doing maintenance calories 6 days a week and zero calories 1 day a week, leaving you with a calorie deficit of (assuming) 1300cal a week. A pound is usually a deficit of 3500cal, so you’ll lose around 1.5lbs a month this way. Of course weight loss isn’t so linear and exact so it might fluctuate a bit but in general that’s the kind of loss you can expect."
xxketo,fdxbet9,t1_fdx75yp,1578767168.0,"Another thing you could try would be to eat maintenance calories, and then fast one day a week. That would net you a loss that’s roundabout 1-1.5lbs a month, and fasting has other health benefits too :) just that for me, the idea of fasting one day a week is daunting, but hey, if it works..."
xxketo,fdx6m2o,t3_enab7w,1578765847.0,"You can do that, that’s basically what I did, but as you get closer to your goal weight it’ll become harder and harder to lose and you’ll have to either up your TDEE or reduce your calories to get rid of the last 10-15lbs at a reasonable pace instead of really really really slowly."
fatlogic,fdx6bos,t3_en8h4h,1578765744.0,"I found an old jacket of mine (really old, like childhood jacket) that is labelled age 14 but I remember outgrowing at age 10. 

It fits just fine now! Obviously snug on the chest region but the waist is just perfect. So yay for another sorely needed jacket in this interminable winter!!"
keto,fdvwsk0,t3_emubix,1578752567.0,"Steak and eggs is one of my favourite meals, ever. I’m a simple woman: steak done rare (or at most medium rare), butter basted, with a couple garlic cloves and herbs tossed in for flavour, salt and pepper; and lightly cheesy scrambled eggs. I scramble the eggs in the rendered beef fat / garlic butter and toss in a little Parmesan, finish with a seasoning of salt and pepper. If I want something fresh and light with it, I dress a little arugula with some lemon juice, olive oil and salt. Minimal carbs and a very hearty and delicious meal!"
keto,fduxxmg,t3_emoupi,1578740785.0,"Despite the wintery weather, I’ve been spring cleaning this week. I’ve saved the good quality clothes from my childhood to pass on to any kids in the family once they get old enough (high quality jackets are expensive!) and I was idly sorting them through. Came across a jacket labelled age 14 that I vaguely remember outgrowing when I was 10 years old. Fits me like a dream now and it’s become a regular part of my wardrobe again!! 

I’m short (5’2”), which is it why it works, and it isn’t a great fit in the chest area (though it zips), but it fits perfectly in the shoulders and the waist! It’s been three years since I’ve been on keto now and it’s just such a spectacular feeling that I can still have victories like this."
vegetarianketo,fduejvv,t3_emvoqs,1578731933.0,"The desi keto subreddit will probably have a lot of recipes for you as a lot of Indians are vegetarian. I personally am not vegetarian, but I like to eat vegetarian once in a while and get recipes from there and other sites I know of that post keto friendly recipes (just look through for a vegetarian one there). Websites I frequent: priya keto for India, headbangers kitchen, I breathe I’m hungry, Maria mind body health, all day I dream of food etc.

Edit: as for fat, I rely on my own body to provide that, lol. As in, I cook my meals in butter/olive oil/coconut oil, and I frequently eat my body weight in cheese, but I don’t look for ways to try and up my fat consumption."
fatlogic,fdpcl03,t1_fdp341p,1578625232.0,"The latter is a fairly apt analogy, I think. My mother is T2D but fit and thin leading a reasonably healthy lifestyle. She just got screwed by the genetic lottery and that’s why it’s something I need to monitor my whole life as I am also at fairly high risk. She’s managed to keep it under control reasonably well though through her diet and lifestyle though she still needs to take medicine. I think that’s the difference between some people who get it due to genetics over lifestyle choices, they need less medical intervention because they don’t let their lifestyles exacerbate the problem."

fatlogic,fajfh2r,t3_e9cgbo,1576135284.0,"There’s no diet to make stomachaches vanish? Funny, when I drastically cut down carbs I noticed my gastric discomfort and energy fluctuations vanished. And that’s saying something, because I’d had them for so long I just assumed it was part of living. 

Not saying everyone should or even could cut down carbs, but it definitely was the magic lifestyle change for me. The weight loss is secondary to all the other benefits, honestly. 

This just sounds like “do nothing, you’ll fail anyway.”"
