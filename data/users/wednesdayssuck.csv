thatHappened,ffa5ozp,t1_ffa3hci,1579728387.0,I'm so sorry that you had to go through that. Your creation actually sounds yummy. I was about the same age when my dad showed me how to push a chair to the gas stove to heat my own spaghettios (before microwaves were a thing).  All so he could sleep more.

One friend's family took me in for a month when she beat my head in and them tossed me out at 14 with just my high school uniform on my back.  Another friend's family who had six kids and not a lot of money would feed me all the time which I felt bad about because my parents had money, they were just lazy and neglectful."
