DiagnoseMe,ffjvlyh,t3_ejqfj0,1580008173.0,"That sounds like Pure O OCD. It’s OCD but only the intrusive thoughts. It doesn’t involve the rituals and compulsions that come with many forms of OCD. 

As a Redditor with this disorder said, a normal person would be like “oh what would happen if I hit my car in that pole” a Pure O person would think that over and over again, and worry over these thoughts and ruminate them."
DiagnoseMe,ffjv6z7,t3_etisul,1580007851.0,I have something similar to this in my eczema crisis. I usually put on corticosteroid cream (diprosalic) but I’m probably used to it and eczema treatment is different for everyone. See a dermatologist.

worldbuilding,ffffrl9,t3_eq2oqh,1579882997.0,"One of the most powerful woman would probably be the Head Monk of Arcadia (yes I am aware that Arcadia sounds cliché as all hell but it's a working name) 

All monks MUST be women. The only men allowed in the church are menial laborers such as Temple cleaners and the high-ranking monks' servants.

This is due to a belief that, due to their inherent predisposition to agression, men are.cpnsodered inferior in Arcadian society, where peace and calmness are the greatest virtues of all."

AskReddit,ffdj5ho,t1_ffd94rk,1579821977.0,"Oh my, I think I got it wrong. Apparently it wasn't that were required to have as many kids, it's just that women could only have contraception if they had more than 4, if the pregnancy was risky, or if they had gotten pregnant from incest. Damn, I always forget that one."
