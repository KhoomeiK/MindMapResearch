I did the same for years. Was in the 110-120 range. Then I decided, fuck it, I'm only using clubs that I can hit. So I only used my 7i-pw, tee to green. And I literally took out the other clubs and left them at home. Took me 3 rounds to break 100, and maybe 10 to break 90.

2.   If a movie has been out for 6 months. It's fair game. If she can't find the right mood in 6 months, she's never gonna be in the exact right mood.


For TV shows:

1. If it's a super popular show that gets spoiled easily, fair game. No timeline.


2. If it's something not as popular you both want to watch. She gets a year to watch. After that fair game. Cause if you can't find time in a year to watch a show? It's not gonna happen."
