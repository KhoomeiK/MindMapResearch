Glaucoma,ffdybzl,t3_et0utc,1579831970.0,"Air puff tonometers aren't as precise as the contact tonometer (Goldmann, the one with the blue light)


Advice no.1- get your IOP measured with the Goldmann tonometer
Advice no.2- get OCT (of the optic nerve) done
Advice no.3- get your central corneal thickness measured

(It should be 3-1-2 actually)

All of these things will take 15 minutes of your time (assuming you're doing all this at the same place).

Have a glaucoma specialist read your results. 

High myopic eyes are prone to primary open angle glaucoma, but it doesn't mean that you have glaucoma at this point.

Also, I hope you're seeing a retina specialist once in a while.

See an ophthalmologist if you develop blurry vision.

It can last up to 3 weeks, be patient

Glaucoma,fefgvmn,t1_fefbtd1,1579056058.0,"Get that eye checked in the next 24 hours just to make sure you're fine. You should have your pupils dilated for the exam, because your doctor should take a look at the retina. IOP is not a primary problem right now. 

If there's a problem, you will need your doctor's report since you were hit at work (it's how it works in my country)


I hope things get better for you.. good luck."
Glaucoma,fef8t5r,t3_eotscp,1579050892.0,"Blunt trauma to the eye (such as that slap) can cause the IOP increase. This usually goes away and some short term treatment (eye drops) is used.
You should go to an ophthalmologist because elevated IOP isn't a big deal in this situation, there are other complications that can be related to a trauma. This is probably unlikely, but you never know.
Is your vision blurry in that eye?

eyetriage,fdoplai,t1_fdohka6,1578610023.0,"I'm in Europe, so I suggested some products that are available here. The main thing is to go for perservative free drops, you can also ask for tears that are dense, such as Hylo Gel and Thealoz Duo (these contain a substance called trechalose) that I mentioned. They keep your eye wet for a longer period than the regular artificial tears. These are all OTC products, so you can ask at your local pharmacy.

I hope you're safe in Australia, knowing what's going on there.. it breaks my heart.

Edit: [here's](https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/systane-overnight-therapy-lubricant-eye-gel/ID=prod6177512-product) an example of the gel I wrote about. This one might be available in Australia, and it's a good product."
eyetriage,fdog3ie,t1_fdmhjso,1578604439.0,"I wouldn't do anything with your left eye as long as there is no pain (and it doesn't ever have to start hurting), because I like avoiding eye removal as long as possible. 
I also assume that your left eye is slightly smaller compared to your right eye.

If your artificial tears don't help, try another ones (I prefer Thealoz Duo, Artelac Splash, Blink personally). Eyes get used to certain substances over time, so you might want to swich to something else.

Also, you can try using some of the eye gels at night. Look up Blu Gel, so you get the idea. There are many like that one on the market. It might help you feel more comfortable."

Do you have any vision in that eye?

Watering will have nothing to do with the silicone oil, there are multiple reasons why eyes water. 

You should be using perservative free artificial 
tears (4-6x a day). They help a lot.
I know it sounds weird to pour more tears into eyes that are watering, but your natural tears aren't working properly, so they're just 'washing off' without helping your eyes maintain the optimal moisture. This is where the artificial ones help."
