socialanxiety,ff7siu9,t3_es4ges,1579657303.0,"Yeah sometimes I think all I've ever done is embarrass myself etc.and I've screamed in embarrassment too many times haha. With the memories comes the onslaught of self-deprecating voices telling me how embarrassing I am, how I hate myself, what a shit person I am etc. And I don't want to meet new people to protect myself from creating any more painful memories, this stops me from moving forward in my life. The only thing I can do to stop the thoughts and the memory playing in my head is to distract myself. I think what you really have to do is confront the memory and work through it with yourself telling yourself embarrassing things happen, we do things we look back on and question they're all part of the lessons life teaches us. How can we eventually become better people without experience? You could say you're mature and good for realising perhaps some things in the past you shouldn't have done, you shouldn't hate yourself because everyone gets embarrassed and does 'embarrassing' things. It's in the past and it wasn't as bad or as embarrassing as you think it was, plus nobody but you probably remembers it. It takes a huge amount of vulnerability to sit with yourself and actually face the memories and idk if it's a permanent solution but maybe worth a try next time you have a bad thought."
lonely,ff23km7,t1_ff22x55,1579492851.0,"It's no problem at all, I would've loved some reassurance when I was in school so I wanted to give some to you, keep strong you've got this."
lonely,ff21tm8,t3_er71rd,1579491513.0,"You will get through this, this is coming from someone who spent almost their entire school life from the first day to the last alone. Boy did I suffer from loneliness, I was bullied and friendless for the majority of the years, I would get odd looks from people who didn't even know me, from other years, when I would simply take a spare seat at a table, right on the edge. I would walk in to every class knowing wherever I sat I would be judged because no one wanted me. My friends that I had for a year, they were like yours so I left them. The amount of days I threatened to quit education because the isolation and the loneliness from that were destroying me, I cried, a lot, but I stayed until the end. For myself, because I told myself once I left school all these people who make me feel so small would just be a memory and it's true looking back now they are nothing more than that, yes there are mental scars but you owe it to yourself to finish what you started and leave with qualifications. You owe it to yourself to stay strong and not let other people who are insignificant in this long thing called life make you give up, they won't remember you and you definitely won't remember them, give yourself the chance to have a great life after school. In the meantime, find things to love that fill the holes left after each school day, find a hobby or tv shows or books, music, art, writing, anything to express yourself and it will be your lifeboat to help assist you on the way to the end of the two years. Oh and I recommend counting down the days until your last day there, it goes from 300 to 0 quicker than you can imagine. I promise you can make it, keep your head up because you're stronger than you think."
lonely,fei8gra,t3_epaqgl,1579132621.0,"I understand, I've been the friend left behind more than once. Doesn't help your feelings of self-worth does it...it's rude how she left you on read knowing you'd see that. You are her friend and you shared things that should mean something. I had an internet friend and she would take months to get back to me or never get back at all, this began to bring me down so last year I stopped trying and I haven't heard from her for a long time, it makes me sad because I'm the fool who still cares but it's absolutely the right thing to do, so I'd advise to move on unless she starts to make an effort. I'm sorry this has happened to you, I hope soon you find better friends as you deserve that."
depression,fefgsd7,t3_eovgsv,1579056003.0,"I feel like you've got a lot you need to get out of your head, I understand the worry of being told what you're feeling is nothing, but you shouldn't invalidate your feelings, they're real, it's clear you're struggling and you shouldn't keep it to yourself, you deserve to feel better. Maybe whatever is going on isn't what you think it is but there will be a reason behind you feeling negative and it would be worth it to talk to a counselor. They will listen to you and at least try to help you understand what's going on. Those people you confided in probably didn't know how to help you but they could have reacted better."
lonely,feffdjo,t3_eovpjn,1579055156.0,"I know how you feel. I'm so lonely, everyone in life just seems to move on and leave you behind because you're not good enough for them, they find better. I want to die all the time but like you I have to live."
depression,fefewu5,t3_eovraa,1579054868.0,"This is your life and you should get to decide what you want to do, my advice would be to start looking for another job and that might make you feel better knowing you're looking for a way out. No one deserves to be treated the way you are being and it's clearly having a really bad effect on your health, there is a better job out there for you and plenty where you don't have to work nights if that isn't what you want so go find your next adventure and get out of that awful place."
depression,fef9vxm,t3_eov1jr,1579051609.0,"Same I can never stop overthinking, not only am I anxious socially so every thing I do practically comes with overthinking but I make every day things have deeper more negative meanings, I think my brain is just constantly trying to bring me down. I had a counselor a few years ago who told me it sounded like I had a 'war going on inside my head'."
AnxietyDepression,fe6bto8,t1_fe6b3q6,1578886446.0,Thank you and the same to you ❤️
AnxietyDepression,fe69l6l,t1_fe69axd,1578884828.0,"I'm sorry, it does feel a bit better knowing I'm not alone though thank you for sharing"
AnxietyDepression,fe5zp3e,t1_fe5y1l3,1578878529.0,"Thank you for your advice, I used to volunteer at a charity shop, only stopped last year and I met some lovely people there although not around my age group but it did definitely help my confidence when speaking to people"
AnxietyDepression,fe5wdrb,t3_enwgds,1578876433.0,"And yes, posting this has now triggered me haha"
depression,fe5styo,t3_envmp8,1578874180.0,"Same here, my depression takes everything I love from me, I don't enjoy much anymore but when it comes to music it has always been there, thankfully my mind hasn't taken that away from me. If it weren't for music I don't think I'd be here either."
socialanxiety,fe5sgcp,t3_envvbd,1578873946.0,"I'm sorry you go through this but I'm not going to lie I'm glad I'm not alone. I do it a lot and for a while I didn't, perhaps I was in a better place but now anxiety keeps me up, last night I didn't sleep until 8 in the morning because I knew if I tried to sleep I'd end up over-worrying instead."
depression,fdzystx,t3_enhrhw,1578799075.0,"I'm so sorry you're suffering so much, please don't downplay your own pain because others might have it worse, you're still struggling and that matters. I'm 21 and my life is going nowhere right now, I haven't even tried university or college as you say because of social anxiety so I respect you for keeping on trying, it's so easy to give in and you haven't so you should be honestly proud of that. I understand about having issues with your weight because I was bullied for years about mine, I struggle with my weight all the time and have tried to eat better and exercise but being depressed and dissatisfied with the other aspects of my life means I can't stick to it, I could say the typical clichés of just love yourself but it's much harder than that. Perhaps try to achieve one goal at a time, something I am trying to do this year, perhaps focus on just getting back in to college life first because if that goes well you might feel better about things and then be able to achieve other things later, it's too much to take it all on at once and will just leave you miserable. I understand about keeping people at arms distance, life has left me believing in basically no one so I do the same, I'm afraid though I'm also one of those people that can be hard to reach to organise things but it's not because I don't like the person for me depression and anxiety keeps me drained of energy and indoors. I understand about feeling inadequate compared to your siblings, I have five sisters and all of them are intelligent and all went to/are at uni (one is younger than me) and have had relationships and here's me achieving nothing. I can feel people looking at me like 'we've achieved so what are you doing?' anyway I just wanted to reassure you're not alone and from your words I feel you're much stronger than you think x"
socialanxiety,fdzgoix,t3_enetc9,1578790025.0,"Yep I can relate to this completely, it's so hard to shake the memory and the embarrassment even years after something has occurred it still hits me in the present. It appears in the front of my mind, the event and I start to fixate on what I said and did and my mind tries to torment me with the memory I fought so hard to push to the back of my mind. The way I get rid of it is probably not healthy, I angrily tell the memory to go away in my head and I go to do something else, watch something or play music anything just to push the memory away once more, it works but I know it's only a temporary fix."
