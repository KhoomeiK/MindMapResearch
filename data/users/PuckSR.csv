todayilearned,ffi8gcs,t1_ffi3cq5,1579967791.0,"No, that is wrong.  
First, you are mixing up GW with GWh.   
My 100W lightbulb uses 876,000 Wh per year.  
A 12GW dam could hypothetically produce 105,000 GWh!  
A 12 GW hydro plant produces 1000x more than the largest wind turbine
  
Second, dams are actually better. They are predictable and always have the same output. A grid of hydro power would be the best system from a grid management perspective"
todayilearned,ffi7qqr,t1_ffgpops,1579967286.0,"To add to this, the US current has 100 GW of hydro.  
Total energy production in the US is ~1,000 GW  
  
So, going batshit crazy and building hydro generation on every little pond is only going to add a tiny fraction of US power at an insane expense"
todayilearned,ffi7cxn,t1_ffh6qpx,1579967010.0,"Probably not.  
A lot of Army Corp dams were built for flood prevention of drinking water, like those around San Antonio. They exhibit drastically fluctuating flow rates and their outputs are typically rivers which cannot accept drastic flow changes that are typical for dam outputs"
technology,ffi13re,t1_ffhqv8s,1579961899.0,What do you think insider trading is?
technology,ffgrhwf,t1_ffgob5m,1579913201.0,"1)  senators and representatives can be charged with insider trading. One just was   
2)  the whole recent discussion was family"
technology,ffgi6n3,t1_ffge7of,1579906795.0,"Right. Your company, despite being one of the big 4, handles this by just making judgement calls.  
  
You are proposing a LAW. A law is much more complicated. You have to plan for all of these eventualities.  
Finally, I was explaining the whole ""right to make money"". The US government generally cannot just tell random people that due to circumstances entirely beyond their control, they are now forbidden from holding a certain job.  
  
So, you have to craft a law around these known issues. You just can't do it. 
It's a great policy and in fact the government already does it as a matter of policy. However, they can't make it a law/rule"
technology,ffgbi71,t1_ffg9gz1,1579902592.0,"and what if the scenario I described happened to you in an accounting firm?

would you just be shit out of luck?"
changemyview,fffv44a,t3_et9kvt,1579892454.0,"> I think it is well established that the Amazon rainforest is integral to the health of the planet, as a carbon graveyard and heat sink; home to stunning biodiversity and cultural heritage; its loss would have unimaginably harmful global impacts. 

Is this well-established?

If you burned the entire Amazon, you would release 15 billions tons of CO2.  
We regularly release 45 billion tons of CO2 every YEAR.

While it wouldn't be great for the environment, it isn't as if it is locking up half of the world's CO2.

Also, I have never heard of this ""heat sink"" you are describing"
technology,fffsb5t,t1_fffq7o2,1579890717.0,"Yes, you can be stopped from making money because of ""crimes"". Those are things YOU did.

You also lose many of your rights when convicted of ""crimes"". I dont think that prisoners frequently complain about the violation of their 4th amendment rights when their cell is searched for contraband?

So, allow me to explain this more clearly: You have a right to make money unless YOU do something that the government is a violation of the law. In that case, you can be suspended from making money all together.

>Having a law which only says ""Your family can choose to invest in a company OR have sway over the laws governing that company"" doesn't prevent anyone from making money in all the other myriad ways that exist.

So, imagine this scenario:Me and my brother do not get along. We haven't spoken in 10 years.Your law says that family of govt employees can't work for any company that has govt contracts. A company that I started does construction work for the Army.

My brother hates me. So, he goes and gets a low-level job with the Army. Immediately, my company must stop all projects?!?!?I have to shutter my company and go into debt because my brother, against my desire, took that job?

edit: or hell, maybe it wasn't even malicious. My brother needed a job and that was the only job hiring. Should he be banned from taking a job because of my company?

I also forgot to explain that ""happiness""=""profit"" in the context of the constitution. That phrase basically means you have the right to do what you want in your life, which was a reference to career"
technology,fffq2rw,t1_fffou9x,1579889338.0,"""Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of happiness""=you have the right to make money.

> I'm sorry, I must have missed the law which says you have a right to make money. So have millions of people below the poverty line, apparently. 

This is why I don't love having these conversations on reddit.  
Everyone has a RIGHT to make money. That doesn't mean that they are given anything.

You have the RIGHT to vote. That doesn't mean that the government is going to go out of their way to let you vote. They aren't going to show up at your front door and beg you to vote.

You have the right to avoid unnecessary search and seizure. That doesn't mean that a cop cannot even ask to search your car.

Having a right simply means that the govt isn't allowed to impede your access to that thing. That is all.

**If you disagree:**

Find me a case where the government passed a law that explicitly excluded people from owning property for things outside their control(i.e. you can't own X if you have Y)  
The only cases I know of are anti-trust laws, which are pretty restricted."
