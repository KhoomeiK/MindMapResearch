I’m here and I would love to chat with you for as long as you need. Please don’t give up just yet dear. One day at a time, one minute at a time and one second at a time. 

I have wanted to die for all the 18 years I have lived but I have learned that even if it doesn’t get better you will have wonderful wonderful days. Be proud of every little victory. I celebrated today because I took a bath and brushed my teeth and i was so proud. Celebrate all the time and every single victory and write them down! Some day the victories will get bigger and bigger, but don’t think about that, just do the smallest thing tomorrow and be proud. 

Please dear girl, you are talented, your dolls are amazing and you have so much potential. Don’t give up, text me, just keep on going till tomorrow. I know you can do it, I believe in you!"
