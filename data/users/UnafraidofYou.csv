Yup, it's a great system.

First down, short run up the middle.

Second down, short run up the middle.

Third down, incomplete pass.

Fourth down, punt.

Brilliant."

Yes, because facts are the last thing people need in a time of crisis."

You can technically amass one of the best records in the NFL by consistently going 10-6 or 9-7 every year, but that's not a successful result with the talent on this roster."
minnesotavikings,fcipzpq,t1_fci0me7,1577667070.0,Why am I deeply stupid for thinking that Zimmer should be fired after consistently under-performing for years?

Well, yeah, exactly."
