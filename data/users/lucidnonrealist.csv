college,fc2a95i,t3_efs9wn,1577348249.0,"I was able to follow that type of schedule last semester, but lemme y’all you it really comes at the expense of mental health. I always set a goal for myself to do something because if I didn’t I would consider myself a failure (Which looking back I don’t recommend) so I always aimed to be the best that I could. The last week of the semester to really felt the burnout, at one point having a mental breakdown at 3 a.m in an empty library. I would just stick to focusing on yourself in two or three things and not focus on 10 like I did. Next semester, I’m just focusing on getting a good amount of sleep and getting good grades."
