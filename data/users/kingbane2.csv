todayilearned,feg6aqj,t1_feg4jde,1579078973.0,"it's not so much that the hot roof will heat your house. it's that the hot roof means lower heat transfer. the greater the difference in temperature the faster heat is transferred. so if your roof is hot the warm air in your house that slowly escapes through your attic transfers more slowly to your roof. essentially the heat from the sun on your roof acts like a heat buffer to slow the heat transfer from your house.

the effects aren't really huge, assuming no snow on your roof. you lose far far more heat through windows than your roof."

todayilearned,fefyb1i,t1_fefwy6m,1579069314.0,the idea that a dark roof help in winter is that it's dark and absorbs more heat from sunlight as it absorbs more of the color spectrum. but if snow covers the roof that advantage is entirely negated.
AskReddit,feftddi,t1_fefo6ph,1579064608.0,"the animatrix kind of clearly lays out that humans were the bad guys because humans refused to adapt their economic model to a powerhouse society of robots who could outproduce them for far cheaper. the machines reach out for peace a few times but humans refused.

AskReddit,feft892,t1_fefswnq,1579064486.0,"depends which version of him i guess. in many story arcs he doesn't really act villainous until people do shit to him or mutants. he see's it as a war and he's simply retaliating. the whole point of his holocaust backstory is that he's seen what happens when good people stand around and do nothing while evil people oppress a minority. so when people in power oppress mutants he lashes out.

there are other story arcs like the asteroid M storyline, where he makes a safe haven for mutants on an asteroid. then people try and launch nukes at him.

essentially he's only a villain if you look at him from 1 side. the other side of him is that he's a freedom fighter, and a defender of the weak. he's a leader leading an uprising to overthrow an oppressive regime."

news,fecyq2v,t1_fecf9oi,1578990164.0,"piercing the corporate veil is notoriously difficult though. i mean your first example about a company being too thinly capitalized and therefore you can sure the owner almost never happens. if it did venture, or vulture, capital firms would be sued into the ground. their whole business model is to buy a business then have the business take out loans to pay back the capital firm's initial investment + profits, then leave the business to go bankrupt now that it's overloaded with debt. i would be absolutely SHOCKED if there was even 1 case nationwide where a venture capital firm did that and got pierced and was on the hook for the bankrupted business."
