Saying sanders campaign is built on communism is just not true, the stuff he’s putting on the table isn’t actually radical at all there’s heaps of Scandinavian countries that already have healthcare and free college 

My own Australia has healthcare that’s actually pretty good (even if our right wing gov took out optical dental and physio recently) under sanders your healthcare would be better than ours.

Another thing to note is that while sanders said he was raising taxes - he’s technically cutting tax, that tax being the Private Tax which is the premiums, co payments and deductibles

He’s adding on to the public tax, but he’s essentially eliminating the private tax which is where predatory insurance companies have free reign which give families thousands of dollars in net savings"
