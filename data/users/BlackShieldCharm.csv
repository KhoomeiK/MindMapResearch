HaircareScience,ffjg242,t3_etvp7e,1579997491.0,"Jojoba sits on top of the hair. It seals in moisture rather than add it.

Argan on the other hand does sink into the hair and nourishes it.

EDIT: Watch out for over moisturising. Unless your hair is really dry and damaged, you don't need oil every day with 2c hair. Over moisturised hair becomes limp and lifeless."

I did see the things you mentioned, but only because I peered at the picture trying to find them. If I were you, I wouldn’t worry about this at all.

That said, you could probably further minimise the differences between your eyebrows with a brow product that lets you draw on individual hairs (the English name eludes me atm, sorry), but I wouldn’t do anything drastic.
When it comes to your eyes, I’m not sure what options there are with your dry eyes, so I will let someone more knowledgeable advise you there.

Best of luck!"

You need to get your affairs in order before you can drag another person into them. Delaying the engagement doesn’t mean cancelling it.

You can check out /r/personalfinance too. They have an excellent wiki as well as countless posts of others who have come before you should you need the motivation. Look into the snowball and avalance methods for paying off debt efficiently.

Putting your head in de sand really isn’t an option  when you’re in debt, as it will continue to grow exponentially due to the interest accumulating. If you don’t tackle it head on, it will continue to restrict you for the rest of your life.

Best of luck, op! I look forward to seeing a happy update sometime into the future."

sexover30,fctc2rp,t1_fct1pw6,1577938617.0,"A vagina is made to fit an entire baby through it. Unless you’re lugging a third leg, no cock will ever truly stretch out a woman.
Good sex is mostly about the emotional connection it reenforces, and much less about the ‘part A into slot B’ side of it.

You’ve really got nothing to worry about. Many women don’t enjoy large penises. They can hurt you during piv, and they’re much more straining to suck. So yay for you if you like bj’s!

To answer your question, loads of women like to have their g-spot stimulated during piv as it’s one of the most sensitive internal areas, and lucky for you, it’s easier to do that with a smaller cock. You can look up specific positions to capitalise on that. Alternatively, there are also positions that will make a small cock feel much bigger. Iirc, /r/sexpertslounge has a good wiki for beginners.

Over the years I’ve read multiple posts on Reddit from women singing praises about their partner’s small cock. I’m sure you could look them up to boost your confidence.

Good luck, and don’t let your self-doubt get you down!"
