It usually takes me several hours to be convinced that I don’t hate it, and then several more to genuinely like it, and then a few more to fall in love with it. Then the next game I start I’m annoyed about how this isn’t the game I just beat. It’s a never ending cycle."

MadeMeSmile,ffessx6,t1_ffes845,1579863839.0,"Positive reinforcement is crucial, sure. But it’s important what you communicate with it. Say your kid is taking violin lessons and sounds terrible. If you shower them with praises about how great they are, that’s going to go to their head and create an imbalance between ego and reality. If, on the other hand, you praise their diligence and determination and save the compliments about their progress for when you actually notice progress being made–even slight progress–that keeps them encouraged to continuing to try to grow. Otherwise it just waters down the impact of your praise. That’s my take on it at least."
