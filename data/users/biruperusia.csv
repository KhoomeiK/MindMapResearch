If you don't look like a local or from SE Asia, most people will speak to you in English by default. Ideally, if you need to approach someone, you should mention that you don't speak Malay so they can direct you to somene who speaks English if they can't speak it. The locals are mostly a friendly bunch, so even if they don't speak good English, they'll try to help you out with the limited English they know.

rareinsults,fglgwca,t1_fgldecn,1580897144.0,It's amazing how cats assimilate into our lives and how much we are willing to accommodate their demands for affection. Surely I can't imagine a world without cats.
MuslimMarriage,fglgkzz,t3_ez1ewh,1580896682.0,"Dealing with mild irritation: when I see something that other people do that triggers me to get irritated (eg eating with their hands that have dirty finger nails), I remind myself of the dozens of flaws I have, and by doing that it gets easier to just shrug it off. Maybe whenever you feel irritated reading their texts, just focus on the context and disregard the lols and lmaos as fluff? People have questionable habits and when the habits are considerable and not harmful to us, it's best to excuse them as we do to our own."

Someone coming up to you and making that kind of remark, it just shows that they must be uncomfortable up in their head and in their own skin. Keep on doing you and cheers to a healthier lifestyle!"

I get my art supplies from there and I have seen jewelry listings with affordable prices. You can ask questions to the jewellers directly and do some window shopping there, just to get an idea before you head to the local jewelry store."

It's soooooo difficult but whenever I get the urge to go to the local nursery or the gardening section, I have to restrain and keep telling myself to focus on the ones I already have! It's much more of a struggle now as I just shifted to a new place in the office that gets a great amount of morning sun... I want more succulents and bright-light plants, but I will have to stay strong!!!"
