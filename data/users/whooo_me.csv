sports,fenhzez,t1_fen9goz,1579285098.0,"If you're familiar with American football, the key differences are:

**Scores:**

\- Try (touch the ball down in the 'in goal' area behind the opposition's posts) Worth 5 points. Followed by a conversion kick (taken from a point in line with where the try was scored) 2 points.

\- A penalty goal (similar to a field goal) is worth 3 points.

\- A drop-goal (any player can kick mid-play) is also worth 3 points

**Passes:** lateral and backwards only, no forward passes. You can kick forwards though.

**Phases (Downs) :** unlimited. You keep going until you score, the ball goes out of play, an offence is committed, or the ball is unplayable (everyone lying on it). So the game has much longer passages of continuous play than American football.

**Set-pieces/ plays:**

\- lineout: if the ball is kicked/knocked off the field, the other team throws the ball back in, in between two lines of players. The team throwing has an advantage so wins the ball back more often than not. (You also have the sneaky option of taking a quick throw to a team mate before the lineout forms)

\- scrum: if the ball was spilled forwards, or became unplayable, the forwards (big heavy guys) from both teams form a 'phalanx' and push against each other. The ball is thrown in the middle(ish) and they try to push each other back to win it. A very technical area, lots of possible offences for turning/collapsing/not binding onto other players correctly.

\- maul: similar to a scrum, except it can happen at any time, and with any number of players involved.

\- ruck: when the ball-carrier is tackled, he releases the ball, and the defenders try to 'steal' it. The attacking side try to drive the defenders away from the ball, until they're ready to play the ball again and the next phase/down starts.

**Offside:**

Too much to explain here, but generally when there's a lineout, or scrum, or maul or ruck, there's a line across the pitch that defenders can't cross. (you can't just ""sneak around the back"" and steal the ball).

There's also a rule that if a player kicks the ball, any teammates who are 'ahead' of them can't play the ball.e.g. I can kick the ball forward, but my teammates must be behind me when I kick it, or else wait for me to run past them and they're 'in play' again.

(The offside rule is why you'll often see a lot of aimless kicking back and forth. If I'm the last player back and have the ball, I can't pass or kick to teammates ahead of me, so I'm vulnerable. The safest thing is just to kick the ball downfield as far as possible and chase it, which the opposing player catches, and repeats...)

That's a bare summary.. if it's any consolation, I'm not sure anyone fully understands all the rules. Especially not the referees. :)"

With the current 90% / 80% limits now in place, you'd need to have tens of thousands cash in hand to purchase a property. Since many don't - and the high rental costs make it even more difficult to save - it's harder for a lot of buyers to match the pre-LTV limit prices.

Feck, sorry to hear that.

I was smart (more like: very lucky) that the place I bought was somewhere I'm happy in long-term, rather than being a 'step on the ladder'. Being in negative equity is nowhere near as bad if you like where you live and can afford the payments. 

The mortgage payments have dropped substantially, and where I bought (Cork city centre) sale prices have likely rebounded more than most. Even if I couldn't readily sell due to the current mortgage rules I could rent out the apartment and turn a profit."

And, while mortgages can increase, they aren't spiralling like rents in recent years. In fact my payments have dropped 600 euros per month since I initially bought.

There are some very good reasons to own.. while I was a bit wary after I bought ('07, not a good year to buy!) now I'm thanking my lucky stars."
