I would consider piano far and away the most difficult and for what it’s worth djing is not an instrument, therefor it doesn’t qualify you as a musician. Neither does producing which is the most difficult of all and uses every instrument and sound our ears can hear, along with an entire world of other shit to make the sounds more rich, fit together and just sound right to us. Doesn’t require you to be a musician though, just helps immensely if you are."
LifeProTips,fevzrmh,t3_eqlzfl,1579403541.0,"Wow, you just allowed me to listen to so many playlists I stopped listening to years ago that I’ve been missing. I’d get multiple ads in a single song in a 3 hour long playlist. YouTube ads are far and away the worst I’ve ever dealt with, I barely use the site because of it."

StopSpeeding,fekron3,t3_epnihv,1579206206.0,"All those things seem impossible in the beginning because they pretty much are. They don’t stay impossible forever, in fact most things become very fun and enjoyable again eventually. I cannot stress enough how much better your life will be if you stop and never look back. Don’t acknowledge the bad moments even though they’ll be quite common for a while. They aren’t real and they will not last forever. Just sleep all day, who the fuck cares. You’re doing what you need to do. The dogs will probably love it anyway. The only thing really holding you back is you. Cut the shit and move on to a better life."
StopSpeeding,fee7xs2,t1_fedivzr,1579028251.0,Well said buddy
StopSpeeding,fee7huf,t3_eoh06k,1579027991.0,"How people haven’t experienced this is beyond me and the main reason this drug should be pulled from the shelf. You have substance induced anxiety disorder man, I’m sorry to say. It happened to me too. I’m 4 years clean and it has still messed my life up horribly, but life is a million times better now than it was at the start. Booze and nicotine are my only vices now, alcohol is the only thing that makes it go away. Life was too good before this happened and it’s a blessing in disguise until the damage has already been done. I’d suggest stopping use because it’s never going to get better unless you make some big lifestyle changes. I’m two weeks sober from alcohol for the first time in years and I feel great and symptoms are at an all time low since it happened, but it still affects my mood on some days. I wish you the best, PM me if you have any questions.

For what it’s worth, it took me a looooooooong time to get to this point. Don’t give up and let what happens happen if and when you stop taking it. I had to throw myself in the weeds for years with full on derealization and a chance of panicking any moment for years before it went away.

EDIT: I feel like it’s important to mention that I do live a totally normal life now, and for the most part my symptoms are in complete remission. The only thing that sucks is that my tolerance for any discomfort or anxious feelings is way worse than it ever was before this happened. I don’t have any panic attacks at all and never worry about them at all, I barely think about this stuff anymore unless I’m having a particularly bad day, but even then something usually happens and turns my mood around and the next day always turns out much better. I travel alone and enjoy it, I sleep completely normally, I have two jobs and I’m making music again. The only thing I’m missing is a relationship which I’m just hoping doesn’t bring me back down like my last one did. I think that was a little more due to my situation at the time and the person I was with though, I think I’m in the clear from here on out. Don’t give up on yourself."

StopSpeeding,fdtfl0p,t3_emnpuu,1578716050.0,"You are lucky to be in the position you are in if you are able to feel so good while off of it. I remember those days and I still regret it every day of my life that I didn’t stop when I wanted to the first time. I refilled anyway like you and I proceeded to have a panic attack while on 30mgs and some weed about a week after I refilled. That one moment destroyed my life for years. I still cant treat life the way I used to even while sober back then because of the monumental distress that incident caused for me. If I had stayed away it never would have happened and if I ever knew something like that was possible I never would have touched the shit in the first place. I went for years without any problems like that at all and it was all over in an instant. Do yourself a favor and stop now. Life is so much more genuine and real without it, even through the times that it’s all you want. Trust me."
