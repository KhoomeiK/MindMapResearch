Here’s a freeware photo editing program:
https://www.gimp.org/ 
You can upload your image to GIMP, and use a digital ruler to make a grid of guide lines over the photo. Then take a ruler, and your sketchpad, and make a grid with the same number of squares on your paper. Make sure to use very light lines since you’ll have to erase them later. It will really improve your accuracy."

Dreams,ff2axwq,t3_er8u4q,1579499133.0,"That is actually really cool and means you could probably lucid dream/control your dreams. It sounds like your mind is trying to tell you you’re dreaming.

I read up on lucid dreaming and one thing that is recommended is to look at your hands or a clock several times a day and ask yourself if you are dreaming (in the daytime). You ask yourself if you are dreaming then you look back at your hands or the clock. If you were in a dream your hands would look different or the clock would look weird or have a different time the second time you look. If you keep practicing like that you can train yourself to notice differences in your dreams and realize you are dreaming. Then you can eventually control your dreams."

depression,feyk8cv,t3_eqx2mc,1579446617.0,"You said you deserve to be selfish for once. Did you know that being selfish is actually a good thing? The literal psychological term ‘selfishness’ means to take care of and focus on ones self- which is healthy. The psychological term ‘self-centered’ means to focus on ones self with the ongoing exclusion of all others, which is unhealthy after a certain point. Self-centered is the only bad term. However it’s easy for us masochists to think we’re always being bad and deserve punishment, even when we’re just taking care of ourselves. 

Have you ever seen a counselor?  I saw several when I was a teenager and the first one was a Crisis Counselor who dealt primarily with suicidal ideation-which you have. You inferred that killing yourself would be the same thing as ‘taking care of yourself’. This counselor would have told you:

It is ok to have suicidal thoughts. In fact almost everyone will have them at some point. It is a natural response of your brain when you are put in a difficult situation that you can see no other escape from. Your brain says to you “Look there’s an obvious way out over here!” and that thought keeps repeating. But the truth is, there are many ways out of most situations in life. Getting out of bad situations takes time and effort and you can’t always see the finish line from where you are, but it IS possible. What MOST people REALLY want is for the situation to go away, and the pain inside to end. 

I’ve been asking myself a question when I have suicidal thoughts. It goes something like this: “You WILL die, and sooner than you expect. Is there anything you want to do first?” I have another recommendation for you too just PM me if you’re interested."
AskReddit,feyhj6l,t3_eqx2n0,1579445662.0,Once when I was desperate I volunteered to live in this trailer rent free and take care of this lady’s mentally handicapped kids. It would have been awkward enough but also Rent-A-Center guys were coming by daily and banging on the door asking for money. She wanted me to ignore them. Got out of there as fast as I could.
