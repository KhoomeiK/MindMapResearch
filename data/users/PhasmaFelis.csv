NoStupidQuestions,ffiises,t3_etskok,1579974872.0,"A lot of it is ultimately caused by intelligence and posture.

Humans stand fully upright, unlike any other species, and that places constraints on the shape of our pelvis. Humans also have extremely large brains, and thus heads, even at birth. Most birth complications are caused by trying to squeeze an entire baby head out through the mother's pelvis. Other animals can pop their babies out without relatively little difficulty, once it's time.

[There's some research now](http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20161221-the-real-reasons-why-childbirth-is-so-painful-and-dangerous) suggesting that this may have been somewhat better in hunter-gatherer times, because agriculture changed our nutritional profile and the way our bones develop, leading to narrowing pelvises among other things. But that's still under debate, as far as I can tell.
