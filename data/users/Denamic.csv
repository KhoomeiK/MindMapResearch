Familiarity bonus only makes you earn familiarity on your weapons faster, which, if you're at a stage in the game where you can get level 300 items, is entirely useless.

Amrita bonus is good, that I'll agree on. But it's a common property.

Lightningstop bonus duration is only mildly useful in cases where lightningstop talismans are useful. Same with steel talisman. I mean, they're not *bad*, but by no means amazing.

And ethereal item drop rate can be good if you primarily get your gear through drops. I prefer to craft and defile, so for me it's a kind of meh property. But to each his own."

MonsterHunter,fehgpsl,t1_fehe52s,1579116181.0,"Assuming ideal (unrealistic) circumstances, such as a stationary target without obstructions to using your best combos on weak spots, then yes, absolutely. SA is absolutely the highest possible DPS in the game. SA was even the highest DPS in the base game, before it got fixed/buffed in iceborne. Other weapons can obviously burst more damage, like bowguns and GS, but over time, SA wins.

However, how much damage you can actually put out in real gameplay depends heavily on the monster, gear, group, and a million other variables, so weapons with lower *potential* DPS can absolutely out-DPS heavier hitters."
