*  Many of us treat politics like an Us vs Them thing - like a football match.  ""My dad said we're X so I will always be X""

There’s a connective tissue wrapping around every muscle and muscle group in your body, and it’s very tough and inelastic. If you get a lot of swelling under the fascia, it can compress and kill the underlying tissues; the treatment is a fasciotomy, which just means opening the fascia. It relieves the pressure and keeps the muscles alive. 

I mostly heard about it in the context of injuries, but it could happen with an infection - “itis” means “inflammation”, and swelling is a part of that. It would explain why they opened the whole thigh instead of just the gluteal area.
