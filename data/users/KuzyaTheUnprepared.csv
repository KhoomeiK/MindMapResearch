As a Mom of a kid who once was that kid needing money for gas - and got helped by a kind stranger - it really helped, thank you very much kind person. He was still rather young at the time. He had $20 in his bank account. He found himself some serious distance away from home needing gas. He went to get his $20, the ATM charged him for the transaction which left him with less than the $20 the machine could dispense - so no money. No gas. He did not want to call and get me to drive get him as it was night and it was a distance away (I wouldn't mind though). So somebody helped him out. It was very helpful. If you gave a kid some money for gas at a rest stop at night a while back, maybe it was my son you helped. Thank you so very much."

After it, Dan Brown's books were difficult to listen to. That magnificent language in Moby Dick provided too much of a contrast to the poorly constructed pedestrian narration shuffling  of the Deception Point (even though the plot of the latter is interesting enough)."

There is only a small handful of people I told my real name either. And I always told my child to NEVER give out his personal info for any reason. I guess we both be out of luck if something bad were to happen to either one of us while in game...  

This is like a weird rare side benefit of an extremely risky behavior (of telling people you play with your address)."
college,fdqxrqm,t1_fdqwnx2,1578676345.0,??? Friend. I am not sure what you are reading into my response. I never said you are lying or any other such. I am just trying to tell you that you don't need to feel like you are asking for something when it comes from the disability office. It is not something that you get judged on or anything.
tifu,fdok1cx,t1_fdmzcyh,1578606710.0,"no. no, no. 9 first to get into the outside (outside of the business' phone system) - that's the action that puts you on the line and then you dial 1 and everything else. It actually doesn't have to be a 9, it depends on how admins set it up. If you do not dial that magic 9, you can only call to other phones inside the business, so if you start with a 1, it will think it needs somebody's internal phone starting with 1."

tifu,fdhm2xg,t1_fdg9h73,1578425535.0,"There was this short story - probably, by Somerset Maugham - about this plain-looking girl in a diner and this one day a guy comes over and kisses her, out of a blue. And she feels on top of the world! She feels like men notice her and want her. Others in the diner look at her differently now, start noticing her. The boss is going to give her a raise, since patrons seem to like her. And then the guy shows up and apologizes. He explains that he was drunk and it was a mistake. And here she was, starting to believe in herself.

I always think of that story in situations like this.

So, a hot girl comes over and asks for a mojito. Ha! Cool! even though a bit weird but hey. Makes a guy feel a bit cool, no? Oh, scratch that feeling. She mistook you for a waiter. What a downer."

Don't worry about it. When you go to the gym, act normal. Do not conspicuously avoid the guy, just be normal self, wave hello and go on to exercise.

Here's the story: I ordered a washer and dryer from Loews at 40% discount black Friday sale some time early November (yes, it was not yet the Black Friday, but they did run the Black Friday sale already). I was supposed to get them in something like ""up to 3 weeks"". Fast forward 3 weeks, they have a dryer but not a washer. They order the washer and it will arrive from KOREA!!! in 45 business days!!!! Aaaaargh. Me so mad. anyway. 45 business days (and weeks of using a laundromat) later. It's not there. Took like a whole full month longer. Scheduled the delivery in a couple weeks from then (because NATURALLY it could not have been scheduled before! AAARGH twice.) The day before, a call from the warehouse - my dryer has a broken door. They can order another one from me from Korea and I will get it in 45 business days!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So I am jumping into my car and driving the 45 min to Loews - and the manager is like, well, I can refund you your money... Are you kidding me? After so many months of being jerked around? And here's where I see another brand of dryer, of similar color, about a hundred or two bucks more, on some sale. Can I have that one please instead? He thought for half a minute, yes. Now, I have a mismatched set but I have a set and no longer need to go to the laundromat with my laundry, yay! I can only imagine how angry I would have been if he refused."
ChoosingBeggars,fbn72hh,t1_fbn3tpt,1576993598.0,Completely agree. I am willing to settle on some things but not on others. I am not particularly attractive nor young. Mine wasn't the best degree or best university even though it was a decent degree at a decent university; I am not looking for somebody who is all that. But - I still have some standards. So I am living by myself and not particularly bothered by it. I like doing what I want when I want.
