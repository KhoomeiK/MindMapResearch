Aleague,ffd7gav,t1_ffd3bng,1579814896.0,"I’m confused. 

Are you saying the passion at the Australian open is out of hand due to one incident which happened close to 15 years ago, in an event which has had hundreds of different nationalities represented and thousands of fans of those nationalities represented?

Or 

Are you saying this one incident in well over 50 years of Australian Open competition justifies why ethnic teams shouldn’t be in the national soccer league?

I don’t really get what you are trying to say."

This is all bullshit.

Like is said, there is no 'official' meaning of continent.
You’re explaining your definition of what a continent is. That's it. 

>Even those greeks colonies you mention, they were considered, at that time, part of Asia

I know that's my point. So in other words not culturally different to Greeks from Europe. Thus further proving my point boundaries of continents they don’t have to be based on ethnic or cultural differences. 

> or part of the persian empire/zone of influence.

No.... no they weren't.
They were conquered by the Persian Empire at some points in history... but then again, so was Macedonia and Thrace and no one claims them as part of Asia."
todayilearned,fdikdam,t1_fdi9z1j,1578444850.0,"This is a really dumb argument. My whole point before was that there is no proper definition of what a continent is and different countries have different landmasses defined as continents and there is no right or wrong.

Your response is to argue with me that there is 6 continents not 7.
What's worse is your definition of what a continent is not even consistent. First you said that a continent is a land mass surrounded by water and that North America and South America is joined, so it should be one continent but then you made exceptions for Asia, Africa and Europe because they are culturally different. 
I mean that doesn't make sense, as North Africa is culturally more similar to the West Asia, yet it is never referred to as Asia. 
It should also be noted the definition of Asia and Europe goes back to the antiquity with the Bosphoros being the boundary between Europe and Asia, at the time Greeks inhabited both sides of the Bosphoros, meaning the boundary was not even defined by ethnic or cultural difference between peoples.

I still fail to understand what point you are trying to prove.

todayilearned,fdi2ky0,t1_fdgr6im,1578434609.0,"> And how can you make a difference between Australia (continent) and Australia (country). Your definition doesn't even make sense.

As i’ve said earlier in my comments, continents are arbitrary and are just culturally defined but don’t follow any geographic principles, 
So I haven’t given any definition.

Australia is a country and a continent.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_(continent)

Even your own definition doesn’t make sense.

> The definition of continent  is land masses on the earth's surface, surrounded, or mainly surrounded, by sea and usually consisting of various countries: Americas is actually America because there is no ocean separating North America from South America, it’s all continuous land from Alaska to Patagonia. There isn’t even any big natural barrier separating the two subcontinents

So North America and South America are one continent because there is no ocean separating it yet you admit Asia, Africa and Europe are all different continents. How does that make any logical sense."
todayilearned,fdgndfn,t1_fdgb9jf,1578403064.0,"So?

What exactly is your point?

I literally just proved in my previous comment that continents don’t match tectonic plates and your argument against that is that continents pre-date tectonic plates.

Wouldn’t that prove my point rather then clash with my understanding of what continents are?"
todayilearned,fdgn3r0,t1_fdgmj8v,1578402827.0,"No they don’t.
