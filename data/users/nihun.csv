offmychest,ff4jz91,t3_erhisj,1579565446.0,"I ended a friendship over a girl telling me she was hooking up with a coworker who’s wife was sick and therefor not wanting to me intimate with him, and she acted like I was the asshole and being selfish. It’s definitely not normal or okay and is a very very hurtful thing to do to someone"
PlusSize,fep2odq,t3_eq59yk,1579310783.0,"I’ve always been scared of this too as I fly often and I’m very broad as well as bigger. Besides the advice already given, maybe pick seats out early so you can sit next to her and either be in the aisle or next to a window so you don’t have the anxiety of bothering a stranger. Good luck and have a kick ass vacation!!"
TrueOffMyChest,fep26d7,t3_eq4eud,1579310462.0,"You absolutely did the right thing and I am SO sorry that you are the one taking the beating for it. What a disgusting way for the university to handle such a situation, letting her stay while you miss out because SHE hurt you. Keep your head up"
offmychest,fep1lw4,t3_eq7mmn,1579310106.0,"If this is how he is now, it’s not going to change in the future. I’m so sorry about your friend and I hope you still have other loved ones around who understand you may need someone. I’m not gonna say dump him but unless you’re ready for a life of being let down emotionally, it may be a good time to have a chat with him because that is a horrible way to react to anyone who just lost a friend."
AmItheAsshole,fenfdqa,t3_epydga,1579283501.0,"Soft YTA. It seems you guys are open and when’s she is ready to talk about it I’m sure she will but maybe right away isn’t the time. I understand your concerns and wanting to know what’s hurting your partner makes sense but getting frustrated with her about it isn’t going to help either of you, it’s therapy and it’s confidential for a reason."
offmychest,fdlow6h,t3_em0bxr,1578528986.0,"Often while serving, we have to do the take out shifts every once in a while and everyone dreads it. You still make minimum wage and since the majority of take out is from these apps, we don’t make any tips. It’s all a joke with how expensive it is."
AmItheAsshole,fdjdmxx,t3_eld14g,1578466469.0,"NTA. I have a semi aggressive dog (she’s very anxious around other dogs) and I know when I do get the chance to go to a dog park, I only go when there isn’t other dogs because as you said it’s public."
AmItheAsshole,fdcgw4b,t3_ekig9o,1578274596.0,"Ehh NTA.  My parents aren’t very creative and my name is my sisters name, and basically the female form of my brothers, and honestly I don’t really care. It’s a name and it’s beautiful enough and if you two feel that you’re set with it, than good on you! It’s your child and if middle names aren’t very important where you live, than it might be a little annoying for her but not life altering in any way."
AmItheAsshole,fbydezw,t3_ef582q,1577214102.0,"NTA. A sanitary issue? That has to be a joke. It’s not an issue for men’s leg hair, and it’s not like woman grow different, dirtier hair. You not shaving shouldn’t have made anyone uncomfortable including your massage therapist because it’s literally HAIR. How you take care of your body, as long as it’s cleanly, is up to you and her opinion on it shouldn’t affect how you chose to take care of yourself."
Serverlife,fbetgok,t3_ecv2vq,1576793540.0,"I had an old lady accidentally poop in her nylons so she threw them away completely in the woman’s little garbages for feminine products and there was liquid poo all over the outside of the garbage... 2 days later someone pooped in the middle of the bathroom. It’s a high end restaurant, I don’t know why this keeps happening"
