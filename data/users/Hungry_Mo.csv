NoStupidQuestions,ff7rujk,t3_es3gsw,1579656834.0,"Ok so i did some math and a cup of white mushrooms is 70g. That is 15.4 calories. 1 cup is 15 calories. Of those calories 7.7 are from carbs, 2 are fat, and the last 5.7 are protein. That leads to a macro nutrient 50%carb 37%protein and 13%fat. Which in itself isnt that outlandish to think a body could survive on. Not peak health, but not many would argue that its impossible for a year.

The part that gets questionable... 70g is 15 calories like we said. The daily general recommended calorie is 2000. That means roughly 9100 grams a day and 450g in a pound maths out to around 20lbs of mushrooms everyday. Not counting psilocybin into this, its looking to be a challenge. 


Spread out over a full day and if you aren't moving or doing much(and with that much tripping going on yikes), you could probably get away with less than 20lbs a day. 

A major problem would be that (white mushrooms and i would assume magic) mushrooms lack vitamins A, E, K, and B12.  If you had a daily multivitamin and fresh water, i think a human could surive a year on white mushrooms. Not thriving by any means. I imagine a long recovery to get back to healthy.


But! Do i think a human could live a year ingesting a daily 20lbs of magic mushrooms? No i do not"
2007scape,ff7pm3i,t3_es3mxn,1579655271.0,"Get your crafting to lvl 8 and make gold rings. Then make gold amulets as soon as you can. Gold bars are around 70gp and amulets normally sell at least 120gp. And then you can make gemstone amulets which is a lot more exp but not necessarily more money all the time, but sometimes. If you get momentum at it, youll be be able to but a few thousand gold bars at a time. It gets tedious. I made my first million around 70 crafting but i would get some profit and then goof off and make more and then spend some. *insert meme about honest work*"
