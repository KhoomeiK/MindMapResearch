insaneparents,fghxxgm,t3_eyehdw,1580797411.0,"[The full scene](https://youtu.be/r5WeAmEVW8o) puts much more meaning behind marges words as marge learns how to deal with a sad little girl after being a sad little girl herself. At first she tells lisa the advice she got from her mother which is basically when you are sad to just smile through it and everybody will be happy and thats how people know what a good mummy she has. To repress the bad feelings down down down and then everybody will like her and she will become happy.

Its great character development as she realises moments later that her mothers advice didnt work for her and definately wont help lisa, that getting through the sadness with support is healthier than dealing with it alone with a fake smile which makes the moment in the post even more amazing.

After this lisa has a big smile and marge tells her she doesnt have to smile to which lisa replies that she feels like smiling."

She is amazing but the focus needs to be on the koala killers. The photos of koalas crushed between dozed trees shows indescribable evil. 

My heart hurts.

There should be fines at minimum in the 6 digits for each koala hurt or killed like this and at a certain number of dead bodies there should be an additional fine ontop of that at least in the 7 digits.

If the penalties are so minimal they will just take the fines rather than do the right thing, then they need to be changed. Its like giving a speeder a fine of $5 for going 90 in a school zone (40)."
