unpopularopinion,fgjnu7m,t1_ffw6yic,1580847868.0,"Yes and the data always tells the truth. Although they haven’t been formally caught, some researchers have a sketchy reputation when it comes to data integrity. The only reason more aren’t called out on it is because proving something like that, especially intent, is difficult. Sometimes inexperienced scientists design poor experiments or there are other variables affecting the integrity of the data. And I’d like to think that accounts for the vast majority of the studies that people aren’t able to replicate. And I would hope its a minority of those people who are intentionally manipulating their experiments to fit their hypotheses."
unpopularopinion,fgji1l3,t1_ffv6yx2,1580844476.0,"Don’t know why someone downvoted this comment. I agree with you though. Peer review is definitely important - I’d say it’s especially important for an extensive review process to take place BEFORE the article is published. Because nowadays fake reviews and false information are easy enough to create. A study with fabricated, tampered, and/or otherwise misleading data can and often does create a lot of false buzz within the scientific community. It happens all the time. I forget the guy’s name, but not too long ago a very well known biomedical researcher was exposed as having fabricated/tampered with data in something like 300 of his 320 published studies. People looking from the outside-in have a hard time understanding the pressure a lot of these academics feel to “find something” that leads them down this path. And there is also the classic phrase “publish or perish”. This is something else hanging over many academics’ heads and it contributes to this mindset. With academics frequently publishing and always competing for funding, a researcher who isn’t finding anything significant will feel the pressure to fabricate or manipulate data to fit a certain hypothesis. It’s a complex issue, and it’s very common. And it’s difficult to explain to anyone unfamiliar with the process."
unpopularopinion,fgjh355,t1_ffvnam7,1580843907.0,"All science has to start somewhere. Things like the combustion engine don’t just pop up randomly. Complex concepts like that are the result of generations of a societal filtering process. The research article titles you created (as hilarious as those topics sound) are probably not that far off from reality. And, as preposterous as it sounds, yes, those fields correlate to the hard sciences and use the scientific method as much as any other field."
unpopularopinion,fgjg6dn,t1_ffwqjdv,1580843362.0,"Perhaps that was a slight generalization. Yes, although my experience lies more in the hard sciences, I definitely agree that the social sciences use the scientific method just as rigorously as anyone else. The reason I mentioned using regressions with ordinal ranges and/or hierarchical responses is because it is common in social science research to incorporate these analyses into their studies because a lot of psychology studies are based on multiple choice surveys, scales/ranges (“on a scale of 1 to 10, ———Insert Question Here——-”, etc.), and other similar methods like focus groups. 

Many people don’t realize how strongly social science research relies on pure mathematics, and that is the point I was trying to make. I’m sorry if it came off like I was generalizing an entire field. It would be presumptuous of me to do so, especially a field that’s so far separated from mine. I’ve seen colleagues in the social sciences use hierarchical multivariate regressions on binary datasets (typically: yes/no, success/failure, 1/0, etc. - there are two possible outcomes), and I’ve helped those colleagues with multivariate logistic regressions with ordinal ranges to examine datasets based on “range-based questions” (ie. On a scale of 1 to 10...). And helped them develop a proportional odds model to examine probabilities within each range. 

Many people fail to see that correlation between social sciences and pure mathematics, but they coincide with one another. Large enough datasets, even for topics/studies that may be subjectively skewed for some people, large enough datasets and a solid experimental model provide the foundation needed to offset those factors and generate a reliable statistical analysis. And it’s as reliable as any dataset in the hard sciences.  Not to mention that nowadays many of the social sciences are intricately intertwined with neuroscience and other biomedical-related fields. Neural networks in psychology are just one of MANY examples."

AskReddit,fg0qn6v,t1_ffx1vu5,1580413117.0,"Agreed. I have high functioning autism and it’s right at the level where I’ve learned basic social skills. Some people (very rarely) sense that I’m a little off, but for the most part I’m just functional enough to where most people don’t notice. And that’s challenging because people tend to dismiss that which they can’t see and/or understand. I’ve developed social skills and become more adept at hiding my autism in plain sight (so to say); however, many people who find out about my condition confuse something that’s hidden and it not being there. My improved social skills (which have taken me years to learn) make it seem like I am less disabled than I am. So it’s disappointing to me when someone sees where I am now and dismisses something they don’t understand. My improved ability to cope with my symptoms through years of effort doesn’t make me “less autistic”. It only makes me appear as such. I still have the same amount of trouble with executive functioning, social anxiety, etc that I’ve always had - the only difference is I’ve learned to suppress urges and tendencies that I know aren’t “normal” and/or “socially acceptable”"

unpopularopinion,ffvp04j,t1_ffun4y3,1580269349.0,"The social sciences are DEFINITELY sciences, and I think it’s dangerous to say that they aren’t. The real enemy here is media/new outlets taking that data and selectively presenting it to fit the best-selling story. Probability and statistics are a huge part of social science research - just because you don’t understand how something works doesn’t mean you can dismiss it as pseudoscience. Running multivariate linear regressions with ordinal and/or hierarchical responses is more than enough to identify quantifiable trends. The two main issues are as follows: 


1.) Money - it takes a lot of money to do good research. Data takes time to collect, reliable experimental models require precision instruments, people need financial incentives to participate in studies, and so-on-and-so-forth.; 


2.) Non-reputable for-profit journals. This one is huge. Many of the studies you’re probably thinking of come from one of these journals. Any well known scientific journal like Nature or Biotechnology has an extensive review process. I’ve had several papers rejected by journals because they wanted more data, a more reliable experimental model, etc. And I’ve also had random journals email me offering to pay me to publish with them. This tactic is common. They’ll offer to pay well-regraded academics, who often unwittingly assume it is a reputable journal, for their research and mix that in with less reputable research. Those are the type of studies you are talking about. Any well-regraded journal does not publish trash. This is why certain journal names have become synonymous with high quality research. And it plays into the topic of this thread. I agree that misinformation is a huge enemy. However, I would shift the focus from the research to who is publishing it. Garbage publishing companies trying to play it off like they are Nature or some other super reputable scientific journal are the issue here."

toastme,ffjxng3,t3_ets6uc,1580009781.0,"Been through something similar, and I have emerged a much stronger person. It took me 8 years to get my undergrad degree for the same reason as you, except my circumstances were slightly different. PM if you want to chat. 

It’s easy to catastrophize, and I used to do it all the time. Your life is not over. Far from it. Many people have been in much much worse positions and emerged successfully. I know of several. Be proud of yourself - it takes a lot of courage to start fresh. I’ve reinvented myself so many times, and it is always hard, no matter how many times you’ve done it. 

If I can share one of the more valuable life lessons I’ve learned - in my mid-20s I was in a rough patch, and I made some tough decisions that improved my life. The first of those decisions was I chose to view what others might view as failures as opportunities. I know it’s painful to think about now; however, I’d encourage you to think of this as an opportunity. 

Not saying I’d wish what happened to you on anyone else, including myself. All I’m saying is to control what you can control. You can’t control the past and ruminating over what happened doesn’t change that. I’ve made many mistakes. And I don’t even know you, but all I can say is you are a person and you need to be kind to yourself like I am being kind to you. No matter what, that’s what it boils down to: you are a human being, and you are not perfect. Like everyone else, you make mistakes. Be kind to yourself and be kind to others - life is too short to go around blaming ourselves and others for things we can’t control. 

The second decision I made that improved my life was to identify what was causing me to feel so horrible; and, for me, it was guilt. And I came to a realization: guilt does nothing for me, and right there I decided to stop giving that emotion power over me. Control what you can control. You can control your emotions or you can let them control you. Take a deep breath and be the former, not the latter."

That was about 6 years ago, and I moved to LA about 3 years ago. Weed is like any other medication - getting it to work properly is done with proper dosing. The tricky thing with weed is that it’s not just one chemical component - literally hundreds of components from terpenes to THC to CBN are in flower. And different strains have different combinations of these components which create different effects. So it’s not only the general dosing of THC, it’s also the dosing of the other cannabinoids and chemical compounds relative to the THC that matters as far as effects are concerned. I’m 1000% convinced weed has amazing health benefits when utilized properly. When abused, I agree it can be harmful. However, compared to anything else, the effects from abusing pot are relatively mild. Sure it can cause laziness in some and increases risks of psychosis in those already prone to such tendencies, but let’s compare that to what happens when you take too much of an SSRI (hint: you get something called serotonin syndrome and die) or get prescribed the wrong SSRI and keep taking it despite suicidal tendencies developing. And I can keep going for everything from mind altering substances (OTC and pharmaceutical) to something as innocuous seeming as nasal spray. And each time the consequences of overdosing or misuse is far more harmful than those caused by cannabis, even in the worst cases."

Either way, that would still leave 39 and 195 sperm, respectively, that are able to survive. And it only takes one. A lack of pregnancy is usually the result of defective sperm, faulty eggs, and/or poor timing relative to the woman’s ovulation cycle.
