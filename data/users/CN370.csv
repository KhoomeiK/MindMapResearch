So far we have a few odd medicine bottles - all glass, all very old; a Billy Beer can from the 70s (Jimmy Carter’s brother), and random liquor bottles. No discernible origin as they’re all pretty generic. No telltale shapes (Jack, Jim, Maker’s, etc:) to determine the brands. The meds bottles are by far the most entertaining find, besides our friend in the picture."

I ended up killing the dude and letting the woman and the inept dude meet on neutral ground, getting them to co-manage the settlement. 

It was a pissing contest. The “prophet” (I forget names) orchestrated a massacre to make himself look right and lead his people away from the corporation. That’s why I took him out in the end. 

I want to go back and play the entire game as a psychopath - killing everyone I come across, hated by all factions, selling out the Doctor, etc. just to see what happens. Already played a moron who’s terrified of robots. THAT was entertaining AF."

personalfinance,fepgbwp,t3_eqbfxo,1579319789.0,Go part time. Your degree will help you in the end if you stay in your job.  You’ve got a good in with your already having the job. Advancement is easier when you have a track record and a degree. I would also advise progressing to a Masters degree as full-time for advanced degrees is 6 semester hours. Advanced degrees can (not always a guarantee) make you eligible for higher salary grades.
