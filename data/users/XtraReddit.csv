Didn't know abortion laws relate to being racist or Republican, but there does seem to be something there with early abortion bans. Also Ohio and Utah have early abortion bans and some Southern states don't have them. I don't know why we're jumping to abortion now.

Florida [has the third most openly LGBT public officials in the country](http://www.lgbtmap.org/equality_maps/profile_state/10) at 25 (tied with Illinois). Georgia elected the nation's [first state legislator who was openly lesbian and African-American](file:///C:/Users/rmurray/Desktop/first%20black%20lesbian%20state%20legislator).

I would expect hate groups in some Southern states as the history is there. What I didn't expect was New Hampshire to be #1 on the list of highest rate of people in hate groups. Idaho, #2, is also not a Southern state. Though combining all Southern states against the rest of the nation I'd figure it leans the way it does. The roots are there, but thanks to people moving south for the nicer weather and immigration it's really becoming increasingly diverse and younger generations are changing the thinking. Soon the South will only be as racist as the rest of the country.

That sounds like more of a you thing. I haven't screeched, been as vulgar, or rejected sources like you have. You keep wanting me to be some Trump supporting idiot even though I have never shown myself to be. I was simply defending where I live in a reply to u/necrovore who was singling out the South and you came in. I was civil and provided sources proving conservative aren't only in the South and in fact there are more heavily Republican states in other areas. You've been nothing but vulgar and rude. A few shitty states in the South is no reason to criticize the entire region. There are plenty of Democrats here as well. If you go into the rural area of any state you're going to find higher concentration of Trump supporters.

So to make it more clear I maybe should have said let's not blame the entire region. Also why single them out when there is much stronger Republican support in other regions?

Don't bother replying if you can't be civil. There's absolutely no excuse for your insults. Your parents clearly never taught you manners."

You sit in a chair and a divider has to be put down between you and the dancer. There are different laws in places. Some clubs can have different rules.

As to why people go? I mean it's a club with drinking and naked women (or men) everywhere. Believe it or not many women go as well. It's not unusual for couples to go and have a great time. If it's not your thing that's understandable. Some also have really good food. I know that sounds disgusting to some people, but I've even seen Grubhub orders going out for people who want the food without the club experience.

science,fggijk3,t1_fgg7xoy,1580762594.0,"Back when I was in high school there was a tradition known as ""cracker day."" On this day black students would beat up white students just for being white. It wasn't some inner city school or anything either. Also every other day was fair game to bully and rob white students. Sometimes when I'd walk into the restroom I could tell immediately that I was about to be robbed because there was a group openly saying how they were targeting white kids standing there. One would block the door right after I walked in. There are other times in and out of school that I've been the victim of violent, racist acts I won't get into. 

In the end I grew up still not becoming a racist because I was so turned off by their racism. Problem I see is that many people think only white people can be racist and that is the only racism that needs to be addressed."
MurderedByWords,fgc06fd,t1_fgb38wa,1580667704.0,"I also fully support a single-payer healthcare in the U.S. I used the system in Europe and loved it. Just wanted to add (further down in this thread because I know I'll get hate for saying it) that a transition to single-payer faces a huge issue that usually goes unsaid. Similar to your last point doctors, hospitals, insurance companies, and pharmaceuticals would see a huge drop in profits. This would surely have a negative impact on the entire healthcare sector in the stock market. Politicians know this would upset their wealthy donors and the middle class voters know it will hurt their 401k.

Basically, no one wants to be part of the generation that gets screwed so that future generations can have better, affordable healthcare."

20% at a restaurant, sure. At a tattoo shop, you're being way too generous imo."
unpopularopinion,fg35fpf,t1_fg34b77,1580471076.0,"I asked the artist who did my first tattoo about tipping and he definitely wasn't expecting 20%. They understand that everyone doesn't have extra money to throw around. Tip what you feel is good for you. No one should be pressuring you into giving a large extravagant tip. In fact I've never paid full rate. Due to my tattoos being large I've always worked out an affordable flat price to save me hundreds. I was told the hourly rate is to make the usual small tattoo customers get worth it for the artist.

Also one time I only smoked a joint with the artist and he was totally cool with that as a tip."
