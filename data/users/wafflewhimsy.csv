AskReddit,feed0y2,t1_fed9khk,1579031233.0,"It took me a while to even get the three layers part. I kept on catching it on TV at my parent's when I'd stop by for dinner. I've actually never seen the beginning; the closest to the start I've seen is when Babydoll first dances. So I never got the narrative set-up that planted the seeds that even the characters are all in her head (and her = Sweet Pea)! Sweet Pea was always my favorite, but man, talk about complex. I don't think I would have been able to come to that realization on my own, haha."
AskReddit,feecme6,t1_fedt2y2,1579030997.0,"Yes, exactly. I think it would have benefited from smaller, independent vignettes to introduce the characters and then start to weave them together in a more cohesive narrative. Less jumping around in each episode would have worked better with the non-linear narrative. Would have also benefited from a longer season, too, but I get that this was just a pilot season. 

I'm also with the book people (haven't read the books, to be fair) that are complaining about the >!lack of an earlier meeting between Geralt and Ciri in Brokilon(?). Apparently they met then and Geralt realized Ciri was his Child Surprise but then left her to try and inadvertently thwart destiny. So they have a meeting and already develop a bond, and then a significant amount of time passes and Ciri becomes his Child Surprise *again* because of the merchant who he helped, which really hammers in this whole destiny thing without verbally stating ""she is your destiny"" three thousand times. Show and not tell, writers, please!!<"
AskReddit,feebvom,t1_fedcwk5,1579030563.0,"I think it's because it's such a beloved IP and we all want it to do well, so any rumblings of discontent are downvoted into oblivion. I kind of expected as much when I posted. 

I mean, I also feel like there's reason to be cautious about nay-saying too much; if there's too much negative publicity there's a chance it will be cancelled rather than trying to improve, and I think we all would rather it exist in the form it is rather than be cancelled. I'm really hoping S2 turns a new leaf. I've already heard they have a new costume designer for S2 (one who has one a BAFTA for costume design in the past, no less), so it's clear to me they are trying to improve. They just need to beef up their writing team a bit for the Yennefer and Ciri parts (they had the amazing Henry Cavill to carry Geralt's parts and the only issue I had with Geralt at all was his terrible clothing that looks like he stepped out of medieval Hot Topic). 

I'm personally hoping for a reverse Game of Thrones scenario where it starts pretty meh but gets better and better each season. Fingers crossed!"
AskReddit,fed7t9y,t1_fecaxqk,1579002853.0,I just watched this again the other day after not seeing it since I was young. The whole movie is brilliantly dumb and I love it. Favorite bit by far was the brief conversation West and Lovelace have when they meet at the southern ball and go back and forth throwing veiled insults at each other. So many sly puns!
AskReddit,fed7m04,t1_fecd3x5,1579002611.0,"To be fair, there were some pretty dumb decisions. And this is coming from a fan who *really* wants it to be good. I'm really hoping they hit their stride in S2 and figure out how to write Yennefer."

movies,fe9ebu8,t1_fe942pj,1578936813.0,"Weird art house-y and lack of appeal to the average moviegoer, I'd say. Keep in mind who Academy voters are (someone mentioned in this post that their 92 y.o. grandma and her friends are Academy voters, and I recall an article from a few years back interviewing voters about the animated picture category and the consensus over there was ""well my kid liked Frozen and I didn't watch any of the others, so it was what I voted for"")."
movies,fe968vb,t1_fe8xtjp,1578934730.0,From a filmmaking perspective I loved it. But from an audience perspective (especially from someone who is really empathetic) it was so incredibly stressful to watch that I will likely never watch it again.

movies,fdsierb,t3_emv3p6,1578703338.0,"My friend said when we walked out of the movie: ""Ad Astra? More like *Sad* Astra"" and honestly that's the only thing I think of whenever I recall the movie. 

But for reals, I'm with most people who think that it felt like a letdown, or at least didn't really feel like there was a point to it. I don't watch trailers so it wasn't like I had any expectations going in besides ""Brad Pitt in space."" I was kind of confused by the tone at times - went from pure sci-fi to a >!car chase and shootout on the moon!< and then I thought it was going to turn into space horror (>!did his dad find aliens? is that why he fried the reactor to send the message back to earth so he could warn them?!<) and was actually pretty disappointed that the horror part was just a red herring. 

I am a very empathetic person and I didn't emotionally connect with this movie at all. But on the other hand, I kind of felt like that was the point? Brad Pitt's character seemed like he was portrayed on the spectrum and since this movie is from his perspective I felt like that detachment and aloofness was totally appropriate. So I think the movie accomplished what it set out to accomplish, but unfortunately for most people it left them dissatisfied."
worldnews,fdos8f1,t1_fdond2n,1578611721.0,">Barry Sweeney, whose 28-year-old son Liam was on board, told the BBC that he believed the passengers did not suffer.

>He added: “I'm going to have to go away and think 'Yes, Liam died instantly as (did) 297 other people'. If you think otherwise, it's just going to hurt forever.”

There was even a passenger who was found with an oxygen mask on (though supposedly we don't know if they put it on or someone who found their body). We lie to ourselves to save us from the truth. Utterly tragic."

The whole training sequence where she chucks her saber and ends up killing the training bot with her staff just reinforced the fact that she's better with a staff than single bladed saber.
