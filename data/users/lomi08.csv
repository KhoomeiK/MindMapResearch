AskReddit,ffh2ri9,t3_etbrdf,1579921547.0,My dog was obsessed with garbanzo beans. We went through dozens of brands of treats that he’d eat happily for a day or two and then just start spitting them out. Switched to rinsed garbanzo beans (chic peas) and he ate them for years.
vegan,ffdnzgz,t3_esty65,1579824935.0,My mom told me once if I killed a bug “his mom would never stop looking for him” Really messed with my mind. That being said she also would pour boiling water on anthills.

aerogarden,feie5cd,t3_ep6f3m,1579136399.0,I have a pantry and ended up just cutting a hole in the back for the plug to go through. Dang cats. You know what they say- you can have cats or you can have nice things.

awfuleverything,fecsc1c,t3_eofq8u,1578982745.0,When I was a kid my dad had back surgery and to tease us he would always grab our hands and run our hands up and down the staples!! Argh so so creepy!! He was a real jokester!

bulletjournal,fecokrx,t1_fecoefx,1578979210.0,He used to come sit on my pillow and grumble at me every morning and I used to think he was telling me about his dreams so I’d respond. Dang girl now you got me tearing up! Have a good birthday.
bulletjournal,fecnyu3,t1_fecmxst,1578978717.0,I understand! Oh the grumbles!! My dad always called them gruntles- you can be disgruntled so when the dog was happy he made gruntles. Silly but makes me smile. I got a couple cats too and they’re pretty good. But I know you get it.  It sucks sooo much! He was lucky to have you. Feel free to PM me if you ever wanna send me a pic or anything and hear me gush over him. I’m always trying to find people to send pictures of my old baby too so I will for sure for sure understand.
bulletjournal,feclk6h,t3_eof5qi,1578976906.0,"I can relate so much. I lost my little old man in November 2016 and I also have a doodle I do of him pretty frequently. He was a good boy and I’m sure your Rocky was too. Seeing this post makes me hope so much that they’re hanging out in doggy heaven together watching over their girls. I had him for over 1/3 of my life as well so I truly know how much it’s sucks. And hearing him all the time- well I get that too. My boy HATED having his toenails trimmed so he clickedy clacked all over the house. 

It is so hard. It does get better. But the memories don’t go away, and so he’ll always be with you. 

PS I did get another dog- he’s no little old man and it did take me AWHILE to fall in love with a dog again but we are cuddling as I write this if that gives you any hope. He’s no Shadow (or, for you, Rocky), but he is MY dog. 

Also, happy birthday!"

MadeMeSmile,fdtx5jh,t1_fdslq4h,1578723647.0,"I have broken my thumb twice (same thumb) so bad it required surgeries, pins, PT and time off work within a year. The first time I slammed it against a door- not in, mind you against and the doctor said it was the worst Bennett’s fracture he had ever seen. The second time I tripped walking my dog and broke the actual thumb into a “z” shape. Boring injuries are dangerous girl! Congrats on walking! That’s incredible! I broke a teeny bone and the pain was incredible- I can‘t IMAGINE what you went through. Just wow. Get it queen."

aerogarden,fcynpw9,t3_ejhmxb,1578083470.0,"I don’t worry about this- I have a bunch of herbs that have spots on their leaves, yellow leaves, brown stems etc and they always grow back fine. I just don’t eat the weird looking bits! Even if the top half of a leaf is weird looking I’ll just cut it off and use the bottom. Never had any problems!"
