OSU,fegvdp3,t1_fegt319,1579103383.0,Not in CSE! They don't know 95% of their students' names and they're not even embarrassed about it
college,fe8vs6n,t1_fe780qq,1578931550.0,"Lol, that was my thought too. If OP's not complaining about how Italy sucks, *she's* the one who needs to adapt to the local culture. Italians are very aware of how dysfunctional their country is."
college,fdxllj8,t1_fdxjvhe,1578770189.0,"""Information Technology"" and ""Software Developer/Engineer"" are two entirely different career paths. I'm talking about software developers, who tend to come from computer science major programs. I don't know anything about how things work in IT."
college,fdxb4qn,t1_fdx38mw,1578767075.0,"Unfortunately, computer science seems to be shifting towards the ""target school"" model as well. FAANG isn't so picky about school, probably because they have so many employees and so much money that they're okay with casting a wide net in recruiting. But the small-size big-name tech companies (think Dropbox, AirBnb, etc) seem to use school name very heavily in their resume screens."
cscareerquestions,fcy1mln,t3_ejfk9x,1578073473.0,"There usually aren't real ""deadlines"". They put up a job posting, then review resumes, interview, and hire until they've hired as many interns as they want. So you should always try to apply as soon as possible."
cscareerquestions,fcnqidj,t3_ei5oox,1577816525.0,"Apply early and apply often. Don't reject yourself because you ""don't know enough"", that's the employer's job."
cscareerquestions,fcklhou,t1_fckgq0f,1577727925.0,Anecdotal but I know some *very* qualified people who tried and failed to get new grad jobs in NYC. It seems to be extremely competitive at the entry level.
OSU,fc4ix9o,t1_fc4fce4,1577417984.0,"Just tailgate your way in, it's very easy (way too easy tbh)"
cscareerquestions,fc0kftu,t1_fbzviit,1577292919.0,I wouldn't say I *like* cold winters but I definitely prefer them over Southern summers.
cscareerquestions,fc0k71h,t1_fbzwtpo,1577292721.0,* Post-grad internships are not normal and seem to be more common in sketchy dumpster fire companies
cscareerquestions,fc0h7h1,t1_fbwm0ms,1577290771.0,"I mean you're not strictly wrong but CS internships are pretty sweet gigs, I don't think it's wrong to be excited about getting one and then disappointed when the opportunity disappears. Considering my alternative summer activities would have been working a minimum wage job in my suburban hellhole of a hometown, I was always very very grateful to get internship offers that paid me well to spend a summer somewhere cool away from my parents. I honestly never even saw it as at ""rat race"" type thing."
cscareerquestions,fbyeceg,t1_fbwn6mc,1577214766.0,"I assume it's because OP is pretty young/inexperienced, so saying ""just walk away"" isn't super practical advice because he was lucky to get even this job."
cscareerquestions,fbydw0i,t1_fby1eyd,1577214440.0,"That's been my experience as well. Big Bank Corporation didn't even drug test me, but Regional Insurance did."
Columbus,fbyc26n,t1_fbwcoge,1577213156.0,"Columbus has really good ethnic food in general, a lot better than most people expect/give us credit for."
AskMen,fblwg7q,t1_fblnsev,1576972073.0,"I'm sure they do, programmers are in-demand enough that they can afford to be picky on stuff like this. Anecdotal, but I can't think of anybody I know who has ever gone back to a business casual workplace after working someplace casual actually."
