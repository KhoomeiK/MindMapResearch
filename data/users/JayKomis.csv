While I wish my marriage hadn’t ended, it was the best thing that happened to me. I no longer have a spouse who doubles as a mother, which forced me to be an independent person. I finally pursue my own interests without wondering if it’s something that she would enjoy to do with me.

bikecommuting,fcg5y1i,t1_fcg0iw7,1577636795.0,"You can actually still get auto insurance for quite cheap from some places. Talk to an agent if you’re interested. Basically you will need medical coverage (sometimes called no-fault or personal injury protection), as well as uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage.

Otherwise you’re at the mercy of the driver of the car carrying insurance. It’s likely that they do, but their bodily injury liability will have limitations. Most states require a minimum of $20-30k coverage, however it’s most common for people to have $100k in injury liability. If neither of you have insurance, then you can go through your medical coverage and then sue the other party for damages.

If you have to sue someone to reimburse your medical expenses, then your chances of getting paid are very slim. Auto insurance is generally compulsory if you own a car, therefore the people who illegally drive uninsured generally do so because they can’t scrape the money together to pay their premiums.

This is because no fault laws are in place to cut out the BS and get your claim paid without the insurance companies bickering at who’s at fault. If you’re in an auto accident of any kind (even if you’re hit by a car when you’re not even in an automobile) then you file a claim for your injuries using your own auto insurance.
