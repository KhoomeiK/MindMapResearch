Wait, nvm, Hilag's only procs on solo attacks. This clears it up."
EpicSeven,ffhsucc,t3_etp3e5,1579952131.0,"Got this one this morning. Is it just me or is it a completely inferior version of Hilag's Lance?

Edit: Hilag only works on solo attacks, I now understand."
EpicSeven,ffh6c96,t3_etellt,1579924334.0,For around 20 CritD I wouldn't sacrifice the speed. If this is PVP then you need a booster anyway so CritD.
EpicSeven,ffgnjxr,t1_fff11et,1579910398.0,"I used him in my first account and he was much too slow for his utility. I recommend getting him Speed/Crit or using speed boots to get him to at least 160 speed. 

But that's for PVE. PVP he is outmatched by most nukers and his utility isn't good enough IMO.

Still love him. Got him today on my alt actually. He'll get all my best Speed+damage gear."

wow,few0b59,t1_fev9cx3,1579403648.0,"You're right. I tried it, but never owned it or finished it. 
The atmosphere didn't appeal to me because, while I like Japanese culture, the game was just too cliché in its approach and design. 

I also find that the difficulty is high for other reasons as before. I hope their next game is less spammy :/"
wow,fevzxq4,t1_fevitzu,1579403570.0,"True. They're a bit different from what I expected, but they're quite atmospheric in the same way."

Instead, we got assault. :/"
wow,feuoyl0,t1_feufiam,1579388646.0,"Bloodborne, the most difficult and atmospheric game that I have played in my life.

If you like BFA's new alliance zone, you'll love BB."
wow,feuonvp,t1_feugzsk,1579388543.0,"Feral is just cool and fun, but I'm so mad that it always ends up feeling like a forgotten spec :(

DH I like for soloing content, but the gameplay always ends up boring me too much to main."
wow,feskc7f,t1_ferytxg,1579366133.0,"I know this is a joke comment, but I've never been more insulted by a game than when I was leveling for the first time. 

Lvl 110? Felt amazing. I was so powerful, running around killing fools with my Leggs and Broken-But-Still-Useable-Artefact-Weapons. It's the strongest I've ever felt as a Fury Warrior.   


Then, I hit lvl 116. Oh god. I couldn't kill 2-3 mobs at the same time anymore. I got my ass handed to me over and over again. Everything felt slow and sluggish. I almost stopped playing my main right then and there. 

&#x200B;

I would take the feeling of being 110 over current 120 any day."
facepalm,feo1tqw,t1_fenbdnf,1579294027.0,"I want to agree in theory, but too often in practice ain't nobody got time for that. 

Especially with certain search algorithms that will favor certain websites over others. But I do agree that extraordinary claims require evidence. 

I guess I'm just tired of seeing pseudo-intellectual debates where one side yells ""SOURCES"" and then discredits everything said because the other person can't be bothered to do a two-hour long research haha."
facepalm,femng2a,t3_ep0tk4,1579263665.0,"I guess I'm just old enough to remember all the previous times global warming was supposed to kill us all. In the last 40+ years there have been so many ""we will all die in 10 years if we don't..""

I think climate change is real, but it is also used as a political tool, that's why so many people are sick and tired of hearing about it. You can't ask questions, you can't talk about it, otherwise you're some kind of moronic denier because ""the science is settled"" despite that same science's conclusions being constantly wrong.

Convincing people is an art form, but people have decided to use hammers instead of brushes."
facepalm,felwkw1,t1_fel7tta,1579232743.0,"Don't forget that a lot of degrees also don't have the same value as some once did, nor the same as physically demanding jobs.

You can spend a lot of money and never get a good job because your expertise is not in demand.

Wage stagnation is but a part of this story."
writing,felpwpd,t3_epkvh8,1579228061.0,"I do think there's a lot of snobbery in the literary world, but I'mma go off on a tangent. 

Your professor is exactly the reason why, even though I'm a teacher myself, I hate the idea of people ""admiring"" professors or teachers. 

Especially when it comes to creative domains. The age old expression  **Those who can, do; those who can't, teach** comes to mind. I've seen too many teachers and professors who take personal pleasure in shitting on something they dislike and others love. 

Only a pretentious moron would describe fantasy as a whole as ""nothing but elves and trolls"", but that's exactly what many a university professors are. 

Pretentious morons. 

Do not built your likes and dislikes on what professors have told you. Do not believe everything they tell you, and for the love of all that is holy, do NOT let their own self-hatred become yours."
facepalm,fekd6nf,t3_ep8p2n,1579197579.0,"Internet debates in a nutshell. Doesn't matter if he's right or not, he doesn't have the source so he loses and we can laugh at him. 

Not that he should say things without proof, but expecting everybody to go out of their way to source everything is not really reasonable."
facepalm,fejlo4o,t1_fejjil0,1579179101.0,"That's pretty cool! 

Thanks, you too. 

For the record, I think cartoons have some of the best ""simple"" English, because the characters usually do what they say immediately. But for something serious, I recommend Forrest Gump. Always works well in my classroom. Same thing with the Shawshank Redemption. Lots of voice over that takes its time."

Basically, have her watch anything that catches her interest. The brain works wonders when we want to understand.

Subtitles if necessary of course.

The goal is to do as much in English as possible to learn it."

Without his specific actions, none of that shit would have happened. 
Someone else made a thread about this where they go into much more details."

wow,fehzjpv,t1_feh8lp3,1579127056.0,"That's nonsensical though.

Thrall IS to blame for what Garrosh did in MoP, but thrn he was captured and being sentenced. Thrall even helped. 

Meanwhile, Wrathion freed the known genocider and let him cause all the trouble.

Of course, I wouldn't say he's responsible for all of Legion, but his actions directly created the events needed for Legion. Without him, there is no Legion expac and thus no dead Varian."
