Ghoststories,ff8h7cv,t3_es50vq,1579678343.0,"Your spirit guide is also known as your guardian angel.  It a spirit that is with you to guide and protect you as you make your way in your journey through this physical life.  Many people have stories of meeting or seeing angels.  For others who have not, it is a matter of faith.  To believe that we are not alone even in our darkest hour is a great source of peace and solace.  Take care."
Ghoststories,ff87sxg,t3_es50vq,1579668465.0,Possibly sprit guides ?  My friendâ€™s young son saw a knight standing in his bedroom doorway. We live in the US and my best theory is that he saw his spirit guide.

dogpictures,ff5w2we,t3_erhtu1,1579612204.0,"Thank you.  The grieving process sure isnâ€™t a straight line.  One step forward two steps back on some days.  And even though it hurts to lose them, someday Iâ€™ll get another dog.  Not to replace him but because Iâ€™m a good pet owner who loves dogs and someday there will be one that needs me.  Have a good day."
DOG,ff5vhcz,t3_ernr7z,1579611650.0,Itâ€™s so hard to lose our doggos and we sure do love them.  Thereâ€™s a special place in heaven for these beautiful souls where they all run and jump and play while they watch over us.  Take care.

dogs,fen4tbz,t3_epza1e,1579276980.0,Lucy mustâ€™ve loved you to the moon and back.  Please take comfort in knowing youâ€™re not alone in your grief.  Your story here on Reddit created a community of support and prayers from really good people who know your pain.  We know that a dog is not just a dog ... your Lucy was everything to you.  We cry with you.  Your pain is raw today but each day you will start to heal from this very traumatic loss.  I lost my 12 yr old golden on December 26 2019.  I still cry almost every day but Iâ€™m getting better every day too.  I hope the same for you.  Take care.
goldenretrievers,fempazc,t3_epu1hb,1579265532.0,"Love her and kiss her and tell her youâ€™ll take care of her all the days of her life.  Tell her at the end sheâ€™s a really good girl bc dogs love hearing those words. Youâ€™ve taken good care of her, sheâ€™s had a loving safe home.  You did good too."
dogs,fei56lv,t1_fehd7wc,1579130527.0,I really like your response to OP.  I promised my golden in his declining years that I would do right by him.  That I wouldnâ€™t let him live in pain and that I would stay with him until the end.  Promise kept on Dec 26 2019.  Enough said.

DOG,fegophp,t3_eowahh,1579098900.0,Thank you.  Itâ€™s been truly awful losing my Kasey.  The house is so empty without him.  But Iâ€™m getting better and someday I will find another puppers who needs an overindulgent momma.  Itâ€™s all good.

dogs,fdqfyet,t3_emqkwq,1578665686.0,I feel your loss.  You loved Winchester and that made the whole world a better place.  Please take care.  Cry out those tears for as long as you need.  The raw pain will subside but your love is forever.
Empaths,fdqecd9,t3_emoenn,1578664453.0,Itâ€™s very hard to say goodbye even when we know our sweet babies need relief from physical pain. I tried to be brave but completely lost my mind on my boyâ€™s last day.  If it helps close your eyes and imagine this ... your best mateâ€™s spirit is going to step outside his physical body and give a good body shake like they do and then start running around in pure joy like a pup.  Take care.

dogpictures,fdgfz1l,t3_ekw9zt,1578395053.0,My condolences to you.  Iâ€™m sure Sam knew you loved him deeply.  It breaks our hearts when they leave us... it hurts so much.

dogs,fcwylyt,t3_ej93p4,1578043239.0,So sorry for you and this sweet girl.  I know you hoped for many years together and things arenâ€™t turning out as planned.  You gave her the best 2 weeks and she knew what comfort and love are supposed to be.  Thereâ€™s so much good in that.  Take care.
dogpictures,fcwxilg,t3_ej7fjk,1578041853.0,"We lost our golden on Dec 26.  Our sweet boy was 12 years old too.  Itâ€™s taken a full week to start feeling just a little bit better. The grief was so raw and consuming and Iâ€™ve cried a billion tears.  The tears have flowed in private and when Iâ€™ve had to scrape myself off the couch, in front of anyone unlucky enough to glance my way wherever Iâ€™ve been.  I am not ashamed of these tears!  Let everyone see that I loved my sweet boy because he loved me back a hundred times over.  If only the world over loved their pets as much as those of us who give our hearts to them knowing that our time with them is too short.  I donâ€™t know how to help you say good bye but I do know you gave that sweet baby a good life and people like you make the world a better place.  Take care."
