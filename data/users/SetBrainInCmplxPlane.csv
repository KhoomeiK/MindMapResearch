You are fixated upon a notion and flat out manic. I promise you the egregious and obvious flaws in your proposal have already been covered here. My concern is your state of mind right now. A poster above me pulled apart your proposal by the seams already so I dont need to revisit that. They responded patiently and in good faith and good humor and you creepily jumped down their throat like a defensive weirdo. You are in a manic state. You are in a manic state right now. Step away. Take a good nights sleep and revisit this in the morning.

Do you see how **everyone** is downvoting you? Is that a coincidence? Or are you maybe out of touch with whats happening here? No one *hates* you. Its no conspiracy. But maybe just take that as a sign to leave this be until you get a good sleep in before revisiting.
