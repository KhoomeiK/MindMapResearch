CPTSD,ffa3tur,t1_ff93mwx,1579727338.0,"Funny, I was just going to write that! 

Years ago, I had a professor who introduced me to Emerson's Self-Reliance.

 She said she found comfort in the conflicts we face in life and uncertainties we have by going back to Emerson. I keep it on my night stand, I carry a kindle edition and a pocket edition. Each time I read it, it just makes more sense and I feel grounded and connected and less uprooted, if that makes sense.

It's also because I have never stayed at a place too long, maximum of three years, and then I start to feel restless. 🤷🏻‍♀️"
CPTSD,ffa1i9g,t1_ff8s7in,1579725999.0,">Whenever my family ""cared"" about me, it was to manipulate me, or to then revoke whatever they had done, in order to screw with me.

>So now... If people act caring, and nice, I automatically assume bad things.

Absolutely!!

I have trouble accepting love, gifts, or letting friends pay for me. I always go dutch at restaurants or if I have the cash, offer to just pay the bill (which is still strange).

I found out about possible C-PTSD after Jan last year. I just kept thinking I was broken, but didn't know how or why.

I can give love or care for others but if someone does that I start worrying because what have I done now? I am going to do something bad and they are going to leave or punish or take everything away. 

I am beginning to trust, like you, and strangely not everyone has a motive to manipulate!"
CPTSD,ff9zs6r,t3_es9yg6,1579724988.0,"Oh. My. God.

>worry=a threat

Absolutely! I thought it was just me. Anytime anyone says they worry about me or care about my wellbeing my spidey sense goes off.

The primary cause of inaction, even in situations dangerous to my emotional health, was because someone close to me said they worried about me. I have worked through it mostly, but wow, it's not just me?!

You say smothering, I think it was coercion for me."

netflix,ff33dre,t3_ere3g2,1579532640.0,"> I was just watching the couple going through the legalities of divorce...

That's pretty accurate. To me, it was also a story of a couple unconsciously uncoupling and becoming strangers and even enemies to a degree, at least until they figure out a way to separate and be together.

It delivers what it says on the box, the story of a marriage. I am at the beginning of a divorce and it did impact me, didn't find it boring, found it crushingly real. The writer/director based the story on his divorce so there's element of reality too.

I don’t think it deserves an oscar nomination though. If you've followed the ordinary drama / tragedy in marriages (who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?, The Doll's House, etc) this will be a welcome change, something more measured and balanced.

Why did you find it boring?"

I don’t have an answer for you except saying that my oldest friend, someone who I grew up with and have known for almost 20 years now speaks like your friend does.

Is that her personality? Does she get offended if someone's blunt with her?

I have felt hurt sometimes by her, but I have also learnt that she just doesn't know of another way to ask after or mention certain things. You can always choose to tell your friend that she offended you."

Don't identify too much with their illness (not saying you are). It gets romanticised in literary circles and classes, reality of the illnesses are not accurately represented.

That's a good sentiment, any references? I have anxiety sometimes and have trouble starting something or keeping at it because of how I think it will turn out -- 'if it's not perfect why even bother' 😅"
