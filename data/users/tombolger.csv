Ah, got it. Your bike is basically lowered. You didn't say you can flat foot your lowered Street Triple R. I wouldn't have even commented if you had. You have normal legs and normal boots but a non-stock bike. If you had a stock Street Triple R, you would need much longer legs and much taller boots to flat foot it. Obviously with a custom suspension it makes perfect sense, but you were replying in context of flat footing bikes when below average height and you made it sound like it's possible to flat foot a popular and also awesome bike with just boots and bones, but that's misleading, you also need mods."
AnycubicPhoton,ffv462k,t1_fft99lf,1580255254.0,"The photon S apparently does not use good enough rails for the upgrade to matter. Apparently, an original photon with linear rails does a far better job than a photon S for less money. The light array seems to be a major upgrade, though, please don't think I'm knocking your purchase. 

The linear rail upgrade is $24 for the rails, and you need to either drill and tap into the existing z axis rail, or if you don't have the ability to drill and tap, some people have had success simply gluing the rails in place. You can 3D print the bracket to hold the build plate to the new rails and then bolt it on.

I don't know about glue jobs, but people who drill and tap their rails in have outstanding results with z-axis rigidity. I'm thinking about doing it."

dogs,ffum1lt,t1_ffufrap,1580244814.0,"I'm not sure how Germany works, but I  speak up to people who leave their dogs on leash in a dog park because my dog is more likely to be bitten by a dog that might normally be absolutely no problem at all without the owner realizing the risk. If you want your dog on-leash, there are a billion places you can take your dog. The dog park is the one place that I can go for legal off-leash time and leashed dogs risk ruining it for everyone. 

Again, I know nothing about German dog parks, but my perspective is that no dog should be allowed in the dog park leashed at any time. There's usually, in the USA, a vestibule where there's a gate on each side - this is the area to let your dog off-leash before you go inside and where you put the leash on as you're leaving, that way leashed dogs are always isolated from off-leash dogs. 

This is just my American perspective, but I think it's a good policy. Take a careful look at the rules at your dog park; at all of mine, it forbids leashes and similar inside.

Edit: Also, I wanted to add that I find it funny how differently I approached off-leash training with my dog. From 8 weeks old, we had him off-leash as much as possible, anywhere it was legal. That way he wouldn't view being off-leash as a chance to finally escape a lifetime of leashes, it would just be a normal Tuesday. His recall is very strong, he comes when called even if distracted. That could be totally unrelated, just thought it was worth mentioning."

Upper-class is a 750k+ home, plus other expensive assets like either a massive retirement fund, a vacation home, a large boat, etc. If you're making 200k+, you're going to pay attention to taxes. Even middle-class people tend to know how to properly calculate taxes. I think you're thinking of lower-middle-class, mostly, where people work hourly and just file for free online with the standard deduction and no other forms (which is what I personally do, by the way.)"
dogs,ffuexip,t3_ev3mja,1580240527.0,"In the USA, we strongly discourage leashes specifically inside of fenced dog parks. The reason is that dogs on a leash are in a position of great weakness compared to nearby off-leash dogs and are much more likely to react in fear because they cannot flee. They are trapped near dogs they cannot escape. In fight or flight fear reaction, a dog that normally would run away peacefully and submit to a larger dog might feel forced to fight and bite. 

ANY OTHER PUBLIC PLACE though, leashes are a requirement. This rule only applied to dog parks because they're the only public place that people go with off-leash dogs specifically to let them off-leash."

Some notes on your suggestions: regarding the taper and the o-rings for the barrel - since the design is based around using a PETG barrel, these aren't necessary. They're great ideas for barrels made of materials that aren't self sealing.

I actually originally had threads on the knob and end pieces with an identical pitch to the threads in the rod end, but eliminated those for ease of machining since this has always been a prototype for a titanium version. I've since forked the project into a 3D printable variant and may add the threads back. I'll be sure to keep you posted on my SLA specific progress. I used all right hand 8-32 threads for the rod tip, section ink cut off, and piston.

I've seen homeless people act as described here a few times. Thankfully it hasn't happen TO me, just around me. I'm very surprised that you believe is just about impossible for even a fraction of homeless people to do wrong when it's commonly known that they're quite often both desperate and unstable.

It's absolutely awesome for you that nothing has ever gone awry in your life, all according to plan. I am financially quite happy at the moment, I'm saving away thousands every month to buy a home any day now when we find one. A few hundred bucks from a phone sale won't really impact my wife and I too badly, which is awesome for us, and we worked really hard to get to this point. If you're completely and absolutely certain that you can predict the future and you cannot possibly have a slight financial hardship that means that resale value of your phone would allow you to justify an upgrade but without that you're stuck keeping your same phone indefinitely, you're right. You wouldn't need to concern yourself in the slightest. Might as well take a knife to the back of your phone and carve your name in it under the case. 

But for those of us who think ahead but cannot see the future, I'd really prefer if my phone wasn't worth $60 after 2 years when other phones that old are worth over $200. It's not a strong enough preference to change my mind about anything, it's just a con in the pro/con list. 

It's sort of like if there were 2 otherwise identical phones and one had 256 GB and one had 1 TB. Lets say you really didn't need any more than 64 GB. The 1 TB is on sale for the same price as the 256 GB, but again, you do not anticipate ever needing even close to that much storage. What you're arguing is that it's *completely irrelevant* which one you buy because it's not a metric you're planning on caring about.

Your ideas are wonderful. The only reason that I didn't go with them to start with is that the plan is to press-fit metals together which will be absurdly strong - the 3D printed prototype is not meant to hold together long term - but with your ideas, it could be made to do so. I've also been thinking about a way to make the barrel work without a lathe so anyone with a 3D printer could easily make this from scratch... More on that to come.

So the rod is threaded into the section normally, blocking ink flow, and needs to be removed to pull the rod back to allow flow, and moved back to the piston. Then you just thread it into the piston counter clockwise to engage the piston with the rod and push the rod up and down at will. Once the piston is in the position you like, you unscrew it clockwise and then push the rod back to meet the section."

I don't believe the government should do what ends up working out the best if it requires an immoral means, like a sin tax, even if people get hurt or die. The blame is on the driver for making a bad choice, not on the government for failing to control the population. That's not valid logic, you can take it far too far.

I have a 3D printed barrel which was fine for prototyping, but wouldn't work for liquids. Take a look at my prior posts on the pen, links in my top comment. 

First off, the threads didn't seal properly when printed on both sides. They seal fine with PETG into the printed threads, because PETG is squishy and seals well. They use it for water bottles for a reason.

The other issue is the smoothness of the cylinder for oring sealing. You need a really, really smooth and very close to perfectly round finish on the interior to make an oring seal and pull a vacuum and slide properly."

Instructions:

Barrel is a 14mm PETG PC watercooling pipe. Machine the ends down to an OD of 0.495"" and cut the threads single point or with a 1/2-27 die. Rod is a 2mm titanium rod. Use 004 o-rings and 007 for the piston. Print with supports and pick them out with a blade. Locktite/superglue the rod tip on, test thread into the piston and section, and then cut the rod to length and assemble, gluing the knob onto the rod.

Also, like with any other potentially dangerous chemical, clerks are allowed to refuse service to someone who appears to be under the influence, and that would likely happen more if unadulterated ethanol was available for sale in hardware stores.

It's not like it would bring prices down from hundreds to tens, it's really just a couple of bucks. I'm not saying it wouldn't happen.
