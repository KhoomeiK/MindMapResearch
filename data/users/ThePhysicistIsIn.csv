Do you mean deductible? Co-pay is the portion you pay when you see a doctor, it's usually fairly low, like 20-50$. 

Deductible is what you have to pay out of pocket before the insurance starts reimbursing services. Then you have co-insurance - the portion the insurance will cover. Finally you have out-of-pocket maximums - after which the insurance picks up everything (assuming they don't find reasons to argue why it doesn't apply).

no ability to manipulate their physical

They **developed the ability to burrow into the
flesh of the less vulnerable species indigenous
to Zerus**. Feeding off the nutrients contained
within the **spinal fluids of their hosts**, the Zerg
learned to parasitically merge with their host
creatures. Once they **became capable of

You are talking about an extremely wealthy micronation though - I bet you that the UAE, Luxembourg, Monaco also have wonderful systems. Micronations don't operate by the same rules as normal nations do.

I do know enough about other countries to know that private healthcare is often \*faster\* but either \*more expensive\* or \*lower quality\*.

The problem of dual systems is that everyone - the government, the healthcare providers - are incentivized to make the public option less good than the private option. The government benefits from every taxpayer dollar it doesn't spend, and the healthcare providers benefit from double-dipping and seeing more patients paying higher rates through the private sector.

Thus, it's an extremely slippery slope. There are *some* aspects of healthcare that can be privatized, but not many."
CanadaPolitics,fgip4qd,t1_fgio0uz,1580827686.0,">Private enterprise saves money because of competition. 

Of course they do. I believe pizza is cheaper because Dominos, Little Caesar's, Pizza Hutt, the local chains, and the independent restaurants, are all competing against each other, some trying to deliver higher quality at higher cost, others trying to go for the cheapest, each finding their own niche. Some of them succeed, some of them fail.

But we don't need Pizza to live. If all the pizza shops went bankrupt, we'd be OK. I mean I'd be bummed not to order pizza, but I'd order indian instead. It doesn't matter.

That's where privatization works the best - *for things that don't matter*. Where it's OK whatever happens.

But this is ***healthcare***. People do need it to live. We can't afford to let it fail.

Private enterprise doesn't work very well when 1) the nature of the industry means there is little chance for competition (e.g. water, gas, electricity, roads), 2) the product is so necessary that the demand is not flexible and will not follow usual cost-demand relationships you learn about in econ 101 (most of the above + healthcare/education), and 3) having competition means that these enterprises now need to devote a non-trivial effort to advertise and compete for customers

I've worked in the Canadian healthcare system, now I work in the USA. Do you know how much effort and money we spend trying to 1) convince patients to come to our clinic, 2) fight with insurance companies to get them to pay us? Just one clear and egregious example: we have to do things like offer patients free valet parking, which of course we'd never do in Canada. Who do you think pays for that? We don't. We pass that cost on to the billing companies. They pass the cost on to the ""customer"". The customer has no choice but to pay. 

The customer doesn't get a line item that says ""valet parking"" - they pay the same either way. But they come to us because of the valet parking. We ask more from the insurance company to treat patients, and the insurance company passes that cost on through customers through increased premiums and decreased coverage. Because the patient doesn't see the direct correlation between the valet parking and the increased cost, he can fool himself that he didn't pay for it. But of course he did.

Because both us and the insurance companies are private enterprise, they hire people to try and read our documents and deny our claims, we hire people to review our documents and get our claims reimbursed. We also pay people to produce tremendous amounts of useless paperwork to support our claims so we can get paid. All of this produces tremendous overhead, as both us and the insurance companies have to pay large number of well-paid staff to compete against one another. Does it produce higher quality healthcare? Nope. Who ends up paying for it? The billing company, who passes it on to their customers.

There are cases where private enterprise is a net loss for everyone. Some monopolies - so long as not privately owned - are good. When the government pays for everyone's claims, they don't need to hire people to reject claims. Doctors, clinics, hospitals don't need to hire people to fight with the government to get reimbursed. Doctors aren't paid 1000$/hr to produce futile documents that no one cares about which serve only to get themselves reimbursed. Everyone wins."
