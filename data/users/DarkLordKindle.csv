But because of the way he published his works(by insulting the church along with his publications), they had to punish him. The whole ""Galileo was persecuted for his work"" thing is a myth.(source: my college astronomy class).

The Catechism(the catholic church's official public polices) had that the earth was round hundreds of years ago, and evolution was accepted sometime between 1940-1970. It was the protestants who were against evolution. 

Religions are needed to control the morality of the masses. I say that as someone who isnt even religious. There are many many people who WOULD do evil things if they didnt think that they would be judged after death. Without religion, they would have no incentive to actually do good, if they thought they could get away with doing evil. 


Scientists weren't as persecuted as much as you think. 

1. In the middle ages the only people who COULD be scientists were either monks/priests themselves, Nobles who had the time and money for it, or people who had the patronage(and protection) of a king. 
2. The church didnt have any significant motivation to persecute science types. You cant argue that its against Christianity, as so was the greek and roman philosophers, but they taught and maintained that knowledge as well. 

No one actually had the knowledge to replicate everything that the romans did. Canals, Aqueducts, roads. Most of these they didnt actually know how to build for hundreds of years."

They kept the old knowledge of the greeks and romans. They were the only source of education(what little there was), a big push on philosophy and science was only done by the church.(occasionally a king here and there would make a finance support for random noble scientist).

Is it the responsibility of the west to solve the problems in africa? And before you say EU caused those problems with their imperialism. I say that they were savage primative tribes before europeans showed up, and they are only slightly better after. Now they just use machine guns to wage larger scale tribal wars against each other. 

In comparison, look at southern/eastern asia. With India, Thailand, Vietnam, Korea, Japan. All countries that were under imperial EU control, that when the yoke of imperialism came off, they have(with different rates) progressed themselves into the modern world. Japan is a first world country, Korea is a first world country, Vietnam, thailand(siam region), India are all first world or almost.
