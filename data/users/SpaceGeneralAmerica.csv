Jokes,ffb420d,t3_esgjkv,1579751244.0,"The actual context of the water to wine incident is pretty funny as well.

Basically, the bride and groom had run out of wine, and the wedding wasn’t over. So Mary, knowing who her Son is, decided He needs to do something.

So she goes up to Him and says “These people need more wine.” And Jesus is like “Mom, no, it’s not time yet, please don’t do this-“ Then she turns to the servers and points at her son and is all “do as he tells you.” Then leaves.

She basically put her son on the spot right there. And he does it anyway."

My father was in charge of me and my siblings and my little brother manages to walk out the door and down the street and starts walking toward the nearest airport.

philosophy,feitjio,t1_feiprvo,1579146829.0,"*cracks knuckles* Okay. Let’s play this game.

Religion is supposed to be a lifestyle meant to seek the betterment of human existence via faith and spirituality. Religion varies from culture to culture, with no one religion having some sort of general guideline for how to be a religion. However, an established religion often goes back centuries and has enormous cultural roots and social influence. Now, as each religion is different, it can be hard to say what religion is supposed to be, however, the general gist - simplified- is this. Establishing a spiritual relationship with a deity or supernatural force that leads to a person achieving a spiritual state of being, encouraging a person to become better and grow. Now, Buddhism isn’t exactly one of the more textbook examples in this regard, but I bring it up because while it doesn’t have a deity it does have the core ideal of striving toward bettering oneself as a person through a relationship with a supernatural force, in this case, achieving nirvana and escaping the cycle of reincarnation.

Now, the Christian religion is supposed to be about understanding Jesus’s message, that while we humans are flawed that does not mean we are beyond salvation, we just need a guiding hand to get there. To save us, Jesus died for our sins, the sins of every single person to every exist in the whole timeline of human history, sacrificing himself for us. Now, this is an act which says one thing and one thing only - that God’s love is unconditional and is open to all. That’s what the Christian religion is supposed to be - unconditional love and open to all.

However, some people instead focus on hellfire and flames to spread hate and point out man’s flaws, judging people for their sins and closing them off from the world. This isn’t religion. This is hate, ignorance, and apathy, some of the most destructive emotions humans can wield. These things can twist anything, not just religion, into something awful. For example, let’s say you’re afraid of vaccines. Let’s say you don’t know a lot about them and wish to get educated, but you end up in a rabbit hole that leads to you becoming a hardcore anti-vaccination advocate because you have chosen to be ignorant, ignore the damage this movement has caused, and hate everyone you disagrees with you. This is not all that dissimilar to what happens to several other movements, though the anti-vaccination one is just stupid. It was the best I could think of."
