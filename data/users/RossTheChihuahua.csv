touhou,ff2yddv,t1_ff2uf10,1579528553.0,"I've played a mobile app for Touhou for about 2 years before ""getting"" my first real Touhou game. Back then, I thought Moriya shrine was the official website for ZUN (facepalm) My first Touhou game was Imperishable Night, and like nearly every other IN player, I always used the border team because they were broken AF. I ended up 1cc'ing hard mode ""by accident"" when I was really just messing around at first

After IN, I got PCB a year later by NOT getting it from Moriya Shrine. I got the physical disc off of Amazon that time. PCB was a lot harder than IN, and I still can't beat the extra stage. I HATE ALL YOUR SPELLS, RAN!

Then, after 3 years, I got TD off of Amazon, and... I honestly did not like it at all. It's literally the only Touhou game where you're forced to restart at stage 3 if you die once. It literally only gives you three extra lives throughout the entire game. However, the danmaku is extremely easy in that game. Screw Mamizou, though. I'm so close to beating her, but her stupid deserted island spell keeps draining my lives like a mom's bathtub drain.

Just two weeks after, I got UFO, and it's still my favorite Touhou game! People said it's extremely hard, but it's pretty easy if you either use Sanae B or just get all the red UFOs. Green UFOs are also good, but I'm horrible at deathbombing, so I just get extra lives. The blue and rainbow UFOs are crap though

And then three weeks later, I got Mountain of Faith! I jumped straight to hard mode and beat the crap out of it. I swear the game is so easy, I could beat the game on Lunatic. Okay, maybe I'm exaggerating, I could at least get to stage 6 though. Kanako is an old hag.

Just one week after, I got LoLK, and that game is so hard, it made me want to gouge my eyeballs out with my bare hands and slam my head against the desk until I'm unconscious. SERIOUSLY, LOLK IS THAT HARD. I can't even beat normal mode for Mononobe no Fucko's sake. The game gives you so many lives, but the game literally fills the screen with a fuck load of bullets. Doing normal mode on LoLK is like doing lunatic on MoF, seriously.

Soon, I'm either getting SA or DDC. SA has much more interesting danmaku and characters, but DDC has way better shot types and a not-so-terrible bomb system."

touhou,ff2oiaa,t1_ff2n9j7,1579516421.0,"I just got Touhou 15 on steam today.

I've played Touhou 7, 8, 10, 12 and 13, and Touhou 15 is literally the hardest Touhou I have played so far

When I first played UFO and 1cc'd normal on my first try, I thought ""Huh, that was a lot easier than I expected. Maybe Touhou 15 won't be so bad if people consider UFO to be just as hard!""

I was so innocent back then... The game gives you so many lives yet kills you SO MUCH.
