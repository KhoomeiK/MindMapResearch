socialskills,ffebvz1,t3_et5fcs,1579842515.0,"Its so easy to be hard on ourselves about public speaking, even for those of us whose native language is English! I used to struggle with this a lot and talk very fast to the point where I'd be so out of breath. The biggest thing I can say is that it takes practice. Took me about 2 years of giving weekly presentations until I finally felt confident enough to where I'm not crippled by my anxiety.
Also, try being creative with your delivery styles. For example, instead of you talking for the whole time, try to make it interactive. Ask your client/audience a question to engage them. This will break up the talking and force you to slow down. Take 2-3 second pauses between sentences. This seems very strange and 10x longer to ourselves, but our audience doesn't notice a pause until it's more than like 8 seconds long (according to my speech professor)."
