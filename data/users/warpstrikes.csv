In TFA, he hears when Starkiller base is used- he hears people screaming, much like Obi-Wan did in ANH. It could be argued that in TLJ when he and Rey are running towards each other and the rocks rise that they rise around him too, although I don‚Äôt know how intentional that one was. Then in TRoS it‚Äôs shown a couple times- he tells Jannah that he believes it was the Force guiding him to stop his gun and meet Rey and the others, then he senses which ship the navigational stuff has been transferred to or w/e. Then of course he senses Rey die, much like Leia did with Han.

SequelMemes,fd2grnx,t1_fd2fvn9,1578146993.0,"I guess we‚Äôre just going to have to disagree on this front. Nowhere in the actual movie of TFA did it imply that Rey cared about having a legacy or specific bloodline or whether her parents were nobodies- in fact, given the opportunity to fit in with Finn (who she thought was in the Resistence), Han (who offered her a job), or Jedi (when the lightsaber called to her) she reiterated that she had to go back to Jakku and wait for her family. She had several opportunities to fit in with people who she thought were involved in something big and grand, and she turned them down initially to wait for her family, whom she gave no evidence of believing were big and ‚Äúimportant‚Äù themselves. 

It‚Äôs only when Finn, who she has learned is an ex-Stormtrooper who initially didn‚Äôt even want to be involved and has no spot in the Resistance or anywhere to belong to himself, cared enough to come back for her (stayed in the script as the ONLY thing she‚Äôs ever wanted), and Kylo kills Han, someone she had started to admire and care about, that she decides to get involved and take the lightsaber to Luke. 

Again, all of the things you‚Äôre attributing to Rey are things that a lot of people in the audience wanted- her to have some grand destiny or be related to someone we knew from previous movies. You (and the movies) trying to fit it to Rey‚Äôs character and motivation feels a little like reaching to me. To be clear, I also would have preferred her to not be a Palpatine- I‚Äôm definitely not defending *that.*"

Him and Poe would have been a better duo for sure. They also could have done soooo much more with him confronting Phasma, and one of my wishes since TFA was for him to inspire other Stormtroopers (even if only a few) to defect as well. And, of course, his hints of being force sensitive in TFA to come to fruition sooner. 

Like, there was SO much that could have been done with him. That‚Äôs one of the things I‚Äôm most disappointed in JJ and TRoS for, even. I thought him coming back meant that Finn would finally have a real arc since JJ seemed to care about the character so much and fought so hard to cast John Boyega, but..."
SequelMemes,fd2dsab,t1_fd23wa9,1578145767.0,"Seriously. Subverting expectations for the sake of subverting expectations does not a good and cohesive storyline make. It *can* be done in good ways but TLJ, for me, is not one of them."

When she was confronted with the possibility in TFA when Anakin‚Äôs lightsaber called to her, she freaked out and high-tailed it out of there. 

That‚Äôs sort of the problem a lot of people have with TLJ- it seems like it‚Äôs talking straight to the audience sometimes in ways that don‚Äôt make sense for how the previous movie set things and characters up. 

REY just wanted a family, to think that there were people coming back for her and/or a good reason why they left her. She didn‚Äôt care about bloodlines or legacies. Her greatest fear was abandonment."

Her only experiences with him are him doing things like torturing her, hurting her friends and the galaxy, and things like that.

SequelMemes,fcqng1d,t1_fcpupi2,1577889067.0,"I think the difference for me is that Vader‚Äôs ‚Äúredemption‚Äù in the OT wasn‚Äôt really originally meant to be a complete redemption- it was meant to be a consequence of Luke‚Äôs faith that there was still some good in him. Part of Luke‚Äôs story arc is, of course, learning about the force, which involves a sort of faith (in EST when Yoda raises the ship and Luke says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe it,‚Äù Yoda responds with ‚ÄúAnd this is why you fail.‚Äù) 

Luke is a compassionate, empathetic character who truly wants to help people. He felt one small shred of good left in his father and put his faith in him, denying his anger and the dark side to do so, and from a narrative stand point he was rewarded by Vader doing one last good thing and saving him and the galaxy. They even make sure Vader says ‚ÄúYou were right about me.‚Äù One good act does not a redemption make, but stopping doing the horrible things you‚Äôve been doing to do one (big) good one is certainly a start. That‚Äôs why narratively they had Vader die- what were they gonna do otherwise, send him to space jail? Have him do community service? He still had years and years of atrocities he‚Äôd committed. And in the (now non canon) Legends books they do still deal with his effects on the galaxy, and on Leia in particular (who told his force ghost she couldn‚Äôt forgive him.)

The difference with Kylo Ren, and why I don‚Äôt think his redemption is a redemption or even as effective as Vader‚Äôs, or effective *at all*, is because narratively they make it about him instead of a secondary character. His going back to the light side is not about Rey- they try to make *Rey* a supporting character in his story, but then don‚Äôt show up enough about him to make his fall to the Dark or rise to the Light believable or understandable. They wanted to combine Anakin‚Äôs journey in the Prequels with Luke‚Äôs effect in Vader in the OT, and for me that‚Äôs why it falls completely flat and leaves me going ‚Äúuhh where did any of this COME from?‚Äù

This was a huge essay accidentally, understandable if no one reads, lol."
SequelMemes,fcqm9n5,t1_fcphot6,1577888500.0,"I‚Äôm on board with you.

Chemistry is also very subjective- I definitely don‚Äôt see any chemistry between them. 

Honestly, maybe with a different plot and writing I could have enjoyed her wanting him to return to the Light side and them developing a friendship- *maybe*- but as it stands I just don‚Äôt see how it makes sense at all, other than as fan service for a particularly... loud set of fans.

Kylo Ren always absolutely felt like that mold of young man who deluded himself into thinking he‚Äôs doing something important to change the world- just listen to his conversation with Vader‚Äôs helmet- and then ends up committing horrible things because of it. 

Glad there are still people that remember those vibes, ha."
SequelMemes,fcn1xmo,t1_fcn1ahu,1577800945.0,"Most people don‚Äôt like Rey- I‚Äôm used to hearing that, yeah. Her writing in TLJ and ROS wasn‚Äôt good in most parts (which to be honest, I partially attribute to how they wrote her having to interact with and suddenly support Kylo‚Äôs storyline) but I absolutely loved her in TFA. There were hints of her having a story I would have loved- her struggle with the dark side would have been so much better, for example, if it came from her own anger, loneliness, and fear of abandonment from her life than just because... she‚Äôs a Palpatine, I guess. I also love a good found family trope, so the part where Palpatine calls the Resistance her ‚Äúnew family‚Äù and then all the Jedi tell her to rise and that she‚Äôs not alone and has *never* been alone really gets me, despite the battle‚Äôs other flaws. 

I don‚Äôt particularly care about Kylo getting to kill his demons, either; for so many in the galaxy, HE was their demon, and again he shows absolutely no remorse for that. Rey tells him she can tell he‚Äôs haunted by killing his father and... that‚Äôs it. 

I also can‚Äôt find it it myself to care about Kylo‚Äôs ups and downs, because everything is from his own choices and doings. 

Just to be clear, I do love a good redemption arc and a good complicated villain. Kylo just does not hit any of those for me, personally. If I were to say who I thought the most interesting character in this trilogy was, it would have to be Finn- TFA Finn, mainly, because they super wasted him in the other two movies. I also think that the very existence of Finn, someone who was raised in the First Order and more or less trained and brainwashed but still realized that what they were doing is wrong and left, makes sympathizing with Kylo extra difficult. 

Man, this is so long, I‚Äôm so sorry and I completely understand if you don‚Äôt read it, hahaha."
SequelMemes,fcn0wx9,t1_fcn0fci,1577800043.0,"Personally I would hate for Kylo Ren to suddenly become the big hero of the series, when the only minuscule hint of that he‚Äôs ever shown is some regret over killing his father (and none at all about all the other people whose lives he‚Äôs ruined or killed) and deciding to help Rey after she had to (unfortunately, thanks writers) spend a huge amount of time trying to convince him to. 

Obviously this is just a difference in opinion primarily of Kylo Ren himself, but I barely cared about him except for as a villain and for the pain he put Leia through, so I was never on the ‚ÄúKylo is the REAL MAIN CHARACTER‚Äù train at all."

But I‚Äôve also never seen a single shred of romantic or sexual chemistry between Rey and Kyle Ron, no matter what essays Reylos shove at me. 

I agree that I felt more like she wanted to turn him for Leia and Luke, and think that would have been a more poignant reason than any weird forced bond."
