StarWars,fc5xus7,t1_fc5xac5,1577468160.0,"> Is it firmly established in TFA that Luke left immediately upon losing his new temple?

I don’t think it was clearly established that he left immediately, but it would be bad storytelling to have a major event happen after that with no explanation.

I think you have to infer that the vision is explaining what happened to Luke and why he’s in hiding..."
StarWars,fc5wx7j,t1_fc5w1cz,1577467618.0,"None of those really fit the context that TFA establishes, though. I mean, there’s a whole scene in Reys flashback where Kylo is destroying Luke’s temple.

It’s clear that Luke went into hiding because of the embarrassment of failing his nephew and getting his students murdered.

All of the reasons you list don’t fit that context, unless you just ignore what happened in TFA, and some of them just aren’t possible, as it’s clear Luke is completely cut off from the force in TFA."
StarWars,fc5v1vt,t1_fc5ojq1,1577466523.0,">Him going there for being ashamed he attempted to murder his nephew is something else entirely.

I respectfully disagree. What noble reason would Luke have for abandoning his friends and family? Remember? It was in TFA that they established Luke failing Kylo, the Jedi temple failing, and all that stuff.

JJ painted RJ into a corner they let him take all the heat for “ruining”  Luke... It was JJ that made him a failure and exile.

Also, Luke never attempted to kill Ben, it was a passing thought."

It’s not TLJ fault Luke was hiding out like a little bitch. TFA establishes Luke in exile cut off from the force. Blame JJ for Luke’s character arch..."
