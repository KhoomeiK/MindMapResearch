Damnthatsinteresting,ffj42t9,t1_f4iiu58,1579989869.0,"Imagine that they are connected rods, about six inches long each. The weight of the chain pulls it down, but as each rod goes into the ""teeter totter"" position at the top it pushes down on the whole chain. Because it's so massive and a bit rigid ( no ropes to absorb this little push) the teeter totter reacts to this resistance and the back end of the teeter totter flicks up a bit. This positions the next rod a little higher before it teeter totters, finds the same resistance, etc."

modernwarfare,ff4beo1,t1_ff41ep8,1579559676.0,"In some older games, *relentless* camping would slow the game down too much and made it less fun. Battlefield 2 IMHO had this issue. It was too easy to just sit still for 90% of the game, making trivial moves only to mix up your cover. This would often cause the other team to be react by being equally cautious, and now there's no movement for a number of minutes. I think most newer games have addressed this by creating a motive to move or disincentive to remain in one spot for too long.  

But I tend to agree, people who complain about campers nowadays on $60 games tend to simply be paying for their over-impatience and carelessness."

AmItheAsshole,fcv002z,t3_eizcvf,1577991877.0,"im not going to vote but the crux of this conversation is not the amount. Its that your cousins wanted to party and you were their only way to do that. You didn't want to, but they felt entitled to it.

""I have zero interest in watching 3 babies for 3 days, sorry"" and sticking to the script would have probably resulted in the same reaction, because it doesn't solve their problem. They want to stop being parents for 3 days.

But just saying no and being firm is probably better than asking for a thousand dollars to do it.

You're a mom, this is what you signed up for. Spending every day with your kids, switching off with your spouse for ""me time"", and having a few hours off in the evening every once in a while to spend with your spouse. If you want less, you best be pretty fucking rich. Bring your kids to go see your friends.  

My kids are late teens now. We had a 10 year anniversary weekend and 5 days to drive to canada to have laser surgery. Grandparents provided the child sitting. This concludes the ""time off"" we had together while raising kids. Of course Mom would take the kids and I'd go see my buddies and vice versa all the time, but raising kids is pretty relentless. Maybe having 3 of them in a row wasn't the greatest plan..."

You should know if you're speeding. And if you're within 10 mph of the speed limit, just admit it and you'll get out of it.

Lights go on, note your speed. Pull over. Pull out DL and insurance, and put them on the dash. but have hands at 11:00 and 1:00 on steering wheel.

""Good evening, may I have your license and registration?""

""Sure, officer."" <casually pick up DL insurance and hand it over>

""Yep. I wasn't paying attention to my speed.""

""I only had you at 62. Are you in a hurry?""

""I'm really not. I just lost focus on my speed for a bit. I'll slow down.""

Nine times out of ten, no ticket. This also works for ""rolling stop signs"" if you rolled it at 5 mph or less.
