politics,ffa7oud,t3_esesns,1579729492.0,It's a crime what has happened to Ukraine. People have no clue how brutal the fighting is.
todayilearned,fezsg7q,t1_fezlcpi,1579461064.0,The vast majority of the whole world was a backwater by your reasoning. The Germans were dependant on draft animals for the entirety of World War 2.
California,feyyqao,t3_eqr4jv,1579452130.0,They also killed thousands of small growers ability to grow legal and destroyed many lives with this law.
news,fem42gx,t3_epubpe,1579239058.0,Concussion protocol. Very glad it was taken seriously but ultimately this headline insinuates something very different.
news,fem1uok,t1_feluai8,1579237020.0,I find these fines to often be excessive. This feels like a poll tax to me. To attach the franchise to any sum of money is a slippery slope in my estimation. Can we disenfranchise people who owe back taxes? What stops this at felons?
news,fem1nch,t1_felsxaz,1579236840.0,It's still a bit sketch to me. I don't like the government playing favorites like this. These fines smack of the debtors prisons of old. Very tough to support this as a Republican voter.
canada,felf14w,t1_fekg7ti,1579220639.0,Hitler was inspired by Islam's violent ideology and fancied himself to be the European Muhammad.
television,feh4l4k,t3_ef30mg,1579109020.0,I hated it as a fan of the books personally.
FreeCompliments,feh44am,t3_ep0b3m,1579108744.0,I love your nose. Prettiest nose I've seen in ages
todayilearned,fecx0ci,t1_fecqjwj,1578988010.0,No no. The top comment is telling us we are all phobes by being honest about a person's genetics.
todayilearned,fecwsi7,t1_fecejrh,1578987750.0,He was a woman who lived as a man. We can't change his DNA or his chromosomes just because you're offended.
geopolitics,fdtoy42,t1_fdthkb8,1578719962.0,"These are terrorists who publicly execute gays. We sell them guns when their our bastards and kill their generals when they aren't, but they never had a worthwhile reputation"
canada,fdlve62,t1_fdl2cbr,1578533395.0,Because they bombed some desert and were worried the US would retaliate.
HumansBeingBros,fdls8zg,t1_fdlb5ty,1578531272.0,That's the whole point of 3 strikes. It removes discretion
politics,fdlq8f5,t1_fdlf5gq,1578529896.0,It was a huge victory and he didn't cause it. The fellow we assassinated killed many of my fellow soldiers and I'm very happy he was killed. Iran cannot do anything to stop us from killing their top leaders and threw some ordinance into the desert and claimed retaliation. We killed their number two who killed Americans and they angrily bombed sand. You'd have to be delusional not to see what a short term win for Trump this was. Long term is yet to be known.
worldnews,fdkdhds,t1_fdk47z9,1578501556.0,I think Trump would argue that his meeting with the Iraqi PM was diplomatic cover to conduct meetings with local terrorist leaders.
worldnews,fdkbobi,t1_fdk9uhb,1578500472.0,I don't think they are using viewfinders at this point.
GunFights,fdi1hvr,t3_elhrk4,1578434074.0,Likely a ww2 vet.
worldnews,fdftvvr,t1_fdft2yt,1578370092.0,He was on an approved hit list complied under Obama. Quds Force are designated terrorists.
worldnews,fdc5ssn,t1_fdbq11b,1578267669.0,They have ballooned their budgets as well. The University's are wasteful as a rule
syriancivilwar,fcwtf6a,t1_fcwseka,1578036877.0,That treaty was never ratified. We have the right to conduct our own foreign policy.
syriancivilwar,fcwtaur,t1_fcwa3lf,1578036735.0,"It's crazy how this conflict shaped the world as we know it. Why we ever went down this road is beyond me, but Iran should have known better than to mess with the US embassy. How can you go back from this? It's like a mafia hit"
Lyft,fcv6ub2,t3_ej1ill,1577995856.0,You absolutely paid Lyft for that ride. You lost 40 bucks with depreciation on the car by the time you get home.
personalfinance,fcv5pes,t3_eizvk5,1577995183.0,That's the kind of job you can do better than with ease. It's not worth your time. Start looking and I bet you get 18 plus

HumansBeingBros,fco3nqi,t3_ei5gyj,1577823464.0,I've seen these in the US. What the hell?
rage,fcnxy5p,t1_fcnx5km,1577820609.0,No one asked her to get that drunk. They aren't responsible for her bad choices. She's either an adult or a child.
WestVirginia,fcma1zl,t3_ehr5so,1577768340.0,These people were set up for failure by their leadership. They are all being sacrificed to protect whomever had looked the other way above their instructors. Unless there is a total house cleaning I call bullshit. These people went along with a joke in an institution that allowed a Hail Byrd banner to be printed and hung. They all thought it was a joke condoned by the State Prison system. Those who protested were pressured t participate. Byrd had full support for this type of thing and he felt so comfortable in his position he felt he could pressure unwilling recruits to do this salute. How he had such comfort shows this goes up the chain. Unless they clean house all the way to the top this is total bullshit.
KotakuInAction,fc66qrq,t3_eg8qvk,1577473544.0,This is good and reasonable.
LateStageCapitalism,fc2m0sr,t3_eft6lx,1577366586.0,"This has to be one of the dumbest things I've ever read. It has no basis in reality, nor does the poster have a basic grasp of history. We are dumber for having seen this post."
MyPeopleNeedMe,fc24gp3,t3_efmmvn,1577340034.0,I didn't expect that long of a jump.
Veterans,fbzauv2,t1_fbzaenp,1577240581.0,They passed over my E4 for JSOQ for some bag of ass that was fucking an Chief. I lost my shit and made a beef so they gave me a NAM and SOY to shut me up. I lost my mother on that deployment and my wife left me so when we got home I just said fuck all of it.
