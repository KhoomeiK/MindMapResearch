 ‚Äú Their six-page letter, which Padden passed along to the dean, points out how the SignAloud gloves‚Äîand all the sign-language translation gloves invented so far‚Äîmisconstrue the nature of ASL (and other sign languages) by focusing on what the hands do. Key parts of the grammar of ASL include ‚Äúraised or lowered eyebrows, a shift in the orientation of the signer‚Äôs torso, or a movement of the mouth,‚Äù reads the letter. ‚ÄúEven perfectly functioning gloves would not have access to facial expressions.‚Äù ASL consists of thousands of signs presented in sophisticated ways that have, so far, confounded reliable machine recognition. One challenge for machines is the complexity of ASL and other sign languages. Signs don‚Äôt appear like clearly delineated beads on a string; they bleed into one another in a process that linguists call ‚Äúcoarticulation‚Äù (where, for instance, a hand shape in one sign anticipates the shape or location of the following sign; this happens in words in spoken languages, too, where sounds can take on characteristics of adjacent ones). Another problem is the lack of large data sets of people signing that can be used to train machine-learning algorithms.‚Äù"

I started with the desk pad, the dust cover, watch batteries, & a couple of case back openers (var. styles). 

I already had from previous hobbies the screwdrivers and loupes. I recently ordered watch bracelet assorted pins, and a couple of NATO straps for watches with bracelets beyond repair.
