If it's unnecessary rabble rousing, be part of the group that advocates for peace.

If there is no fighting, rebuild.

If the children, sick, or women are in need, help them.

If an election comes up, vote for what's best for the country, not some silly ideological score to settle.

Can't do any of that from outside the country in Europe. Worse yet to leave your dependents behind in a situation you yourself thought was so untenable that you had to leave. It's an abdication of a moral responsibility you have to your family and to your community.

Not gonna lie, It's not an easy thing to stay. The easier thing was to throw their hands up and start walking to Europe. But that's not responsibility. It's cowardice."

It's not really a weakness, because we're all in our little sandbox. You can't use it to hurt Him with it. Travel to as many bubble universes as you like.there's no way to get to Him. The civilization can sin all it likes in this little sandbox, they only screw themselves because the only wages of sin are death.

It's a rigged game if you wanted a fight, to be sure, but it's kind of a theological philosophy necessity more than an ancient fanfic writer giving his character the power of all the powers. It's part of the whole systematically laid out theory of who God is and what his relationship to us is."

Solving for v, the best Wolfram alpha could give me was (35156249999999991/390625)^{1/2) km/s.

When asked for a real number it rounded it to 300000km/s, or the speed of light itself. 

So the answer is close enough to the speed of light that even Wolfram doesn't want to deal with it.

I'm usually against working out mid-season at home, barring special circumstances. 4 days a week of practice and two day weekend tournaments are usually what your body wants to handle. Your coaches try to calibrate the amount of work you do so you don't overexert yourself. If your not feeling like that is enough, you're probably not working hard enough during practice.

Special circumstances include: 

You aren't given weight room access. Get an outside gym membership. Watch yourself in there. Skip a day between the same muscle group. Never the day before a match.

You need to cut. The goal is to lose the water weight with as little physical exertion, especially anaerobic, as necessary. Layers, as many as possible. Olypticals and recumbants are good. Treadmills are OK, but it's more knee strain."

After that it took population 3 stars forming and exploding to fuse together the necessary oxygen. Whenever that exploded out oxygen and other gasses floating in space clumped together to make our sun the violence of its creation meant that they were separated (hard to form bonds as a plasma). Then as the dust settled in the stellar cloud hydrogen and oxygen could finally come together making the water we have today.
