I also totally understand having tiny eyebrows. Mine are dark, but they‚Äôve always been really thin and don‚Äôt have much natural arch. I pluck some stray hairs here and there, but I pretty much don‚Äôt touch them. I‚Äôve never been one to fill my brows...cause I‚Äôm lazy lol I have gotten them shaped and tinted, though."

Their face is the LAST thing I hate about them. When google images loaded immediately I was breathing heavy, I tensed up, and my toes curled lmao  Their legs are the *worst*. And the odd body shape just exacerbates the whole thing. However, you did warn me....though even without the warning, I still would‚Äôve googled them.  Just like you said.

One of the only other spiders that has given me a similar physical reaction is the banana spider, Argiope aurantia. Growing up, in my backyard, in between our toolshed and our lawn mower shed a banana spider would set up her web every single spring/summer. It was a massive web with the very distinct zipper down the middle of it. And there she would sit, right in the middle of the web, the horrifying banana spider. If I would get too close she would shake her web back and forth. It was terrifying. I always thought she would jump on me. Banana spiders‚Äô legs give me chills to this day. Thus far, they are my most feared spider. I would handle a brown recluse before I‚Äôd handle a banana spider."
