cute,fgi2mmi,t3_eydmaa,1580802675.0,"I have a coworker who’s crazy about corgis, and I’m absolutely showing this to her tomorrow."
AskReddit,fghiuep,t3_ey9qbh,1580785798.0,2010’s live action The Last Airbender. I was NINE when that movie came out and even then I knew it was terrible.
Baking,fgcoabq,t3_exho1f,1580674677.0,How wonderful! So talented!
aww,fg763xr,t1_fg71u11,1580584885.0,"I think I know what you’re seeing, and I think they’re her hackles? They’re not up much but you can kinda see she’s got some extra floof on her back, too."
aww,fg75xqw,t1_fg71r4g,1580584770.0,"Me and my mom do work full time, so that does create some issues in sharing responsibility. She’s 8 years old now, though, and these discussions have been had. It was harder when we were younger (I was 10 and sis was 8 when we got her). 

I try to help sometimes just by picking up food when my parents can’t. Feeding her is the responsibility of the first one who leaves the house in the morning (at night my mom usually does it). Exercise is easier just because he works out so much already, and we even have a couple family friends (like everyone we know is active in some way) who just like taking her along in a casual hike. In the warmer seasons, I can just drive two minutes to the lake so she can run around a bit.

I guess I shouldn’t have implied he does ALL the work. He does a lot, but we never mean to dump all the dog’s care on him. My dad’s a very vocal person on stuff he doesn’t like."
aww,fg6z17k,t1_fg6wiq3,1580580168.0,"She LOVES playing under blankets! Only issue is she gets braver with the biting, so we use a thick one. If she’s in a play mood, and we hide a toy in a crumpled blanket, she has a ball trying to find it."
aww,fg6yj2l,t1_fg6gzuz,1580579841.0,That’s my mom! She’s a nurse so she has a lot of bright scrubs.
aww,fg6y8xd,t1_fg6f081,1580579655.0,"Agreed, absolutely, but we were willing to put in the work and we all love her.

Admittedly my dad does take a lot of the responsibility. Especially since his work hours used to be a lot more flexible. He’s her ride to the vet, and he’s the one that gives her most of the exercise (though me and my sister will walk her when he can’t. Helps we live near a lake). She’s a very high energy dog.

Our neighbor has a dog with similar demands (you can see her head over the fence in the last frame) that they don’t meet and the thing is a nightmare. It’s not the dogs fault, but the owner’s. My dad and my family love our dog enough that the responsibility is worth it.

Also my sister’s in charge of poop duty so that helps."

aww,fg6wt3l,t1_fg66qkn,1580578706.0,Husky/lab/pit/German shepherd! Her whole litter was rescued from a pretty bad place and we adopted her from a foster home!
aww,fg6w4fs,t1_fg6uxw4,1580578251.0,He wrestles with her a lot in winter because it gets too cold to just take a casual walk/run with her. This helps her get the exercise she needs to stay healthy!
aww,fg6vy8w,t1_fg6ce7c,1580578135.0,"I’d say yes. He used to play like this with me and my sister when we were little, and small children are pretty savage.

Otherwise, nope, but he works out a lot! You can bet the dog comes along when he goes hiking or biking."
aww,fg6vqmh,t1_fg6db98,1580577996.0,"It’s so sad that pits get such a bad rep! 

I’d love a big dog when I’m living on my own! It’s a self care goal on top of a general goal because I know I need to get in shape before I have a dog like that. Something like a Samoyed mix!"
aww,fg6vfn6,t1_fg6dpzi,1580577793.0,"What a little darling! She’s a big mix, most prominently pit/lab/German shepherd/husky. 

Another redditor sent me another lookalike! I don’t think the mix is too uncommon up here, I swear I’ve seen her littermates around. We’re from southern Alaska."
aww,fg6v4mz,t1_fg6elug,1580577586.0,"Im actually not sure! She is a little prone to ear infections, though l. We try to nip it as soon as we notice."
aww,fg6uzuo,t1_fg6era3,1580577499.0,"I understand the concern, but my dad is the ONLY person she’ll get this rough with. Me, my mom, and my younger sister still wrestle with her sometimes, but she doesn’t do it to this level.

She’s been around a lot of little kids, and all she ever does is wanna sniff them."
aww,fg6ujlj,t1_fg659f3,1580577199.0,"I messaged you back, but I’d like to reply here, too! It’s just a lipoma, and it’s the only lump she’s ever had thankfully. The only times she’s needed a trip to the vet for something other than routine was when she got giardia and needed a cyst in her cheek removed.

Other than that, she’s healthy! Lump’s been there awhile. It doesn’t bother her and it’s just gross to feel."
aww,fg6u6p2,t1_fg6j67k,1580576961.0,"This is his first pup, and me any my sister’s too. We’d only had cats before. It helps that my mom had three!"
aww,fg6tyl2,t1_fg6m8qm,1580576814.0,"That’s adorable! I don’t think he’d take the suggestion, though. Whenever she wants to thrash she’ll run outside and grab that stick!"
aww,fg6tsje,t1_fg6pl9c,1580576702.0,"The only thing that make my dad (and me) bawl outta nowhere is knowing that day’s gonna come. But right now, she’s eight years old and still going real strong. No slowdown yet. She’s healthy and hopefully she’ll be around a long while more!"
aww,fg6th8w,t1_fg6rbe2,1580576495.0,That’s her woobie! Not the first one. She has a single log she’ll play with until it wears down the middle so much it breaks.
aww,fg61sh0,t1_fg607pu,1580549139.0,"Yup! We’ve barely had a couple accidents in all the time we’ve had her, and this is exactly how we deescalate in the rare times she does get too rough. She’ll shove her head in your legs to apologize, too."
AnimalsBeingBros,fg61n8t,t3_ewsr6i,1580548926.0,"Seeing this absolutely turned me around on ferrets (a not great person in my life owned a pair, and it was...bad). I would never have taken a ferret for such a doting mother! You get back in there with your little brothers and sisters!"

aww,fg60mcp,t1_fg5z3ru,1580547446.0,"We got lucky with how well behaved she turned out to be, and she’s super smart. For the longest time, she had a specific hour where she’d pick a fight to wrestle.

I have learned that husky mixes make for some great dogs in general, and I live somewhere where huskies are incredibly common! My own dog has a little husky and she has brilliant eyes. Sunshine’s pups sound beautiful!"
