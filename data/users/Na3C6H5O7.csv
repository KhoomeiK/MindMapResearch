Fun Fact: We don't know why cats ""make biscuits"" like the one in OP's video. There are a lot of hypotheses, and many people will tell you one of these hypotheses as if it were fact, but the truth is that none of them have actually been tested.

The leading hypothesis is that kittens do it to their mothers to stimulate milk production, but no data has been collected to show that kneading has any real effect. Additionally, not all kittens knead and such a beneficial behavior should have given the kneaders a large enough advantage to make it more universal. Maybe.

Adult cats that do it are often said to have been taken from their mothers too early, but that hypothesis is demonstrably false when one considers the large number of kneady cats that weren't.

Concurrent behaviors often (but not always) include some combination of purring, suckling, head drooping, eyes closing, or drooling, and is sometimes followed by sleeping. Surfaces chosen seem unique to the cat, some preferring soft, some hard surfaces, some preferring other animals (e.g. humans) and others preferring non-living surfaces.

Other hypotheses include stress relief, bonding, demonstrating affection or contentment, or even scent marking with glands on their feet."

As we have evolved as a society, strong gender stereotypes have lost popularity and people who don't fit those stereotypes have gained greater acceptance. To accommodate those who don't fit the stereotypes, the meanings of the two words have been split by most biologists, with sex referring to the biological aspects and gender to the sociological aspects. There is still controversy, however, since there is some grey area even with the biological bit, such as with cases of gender dysphoria where the patient attempts to alter their biology using medications and surgery. So if sex is biological, should it be based on genetics (which even that isn't exactly binary due to various chromosomal abnormalities) or on anatomy?

One example that hits close to home for me (literally) is the [Preble's Meadow Jumping Mouse](https://www.fws.gov/mountain-prairie/es/preblesMeadowJumpingMouse.php), currently protected under the ESA. A group working for such a consortium of developers and ranchers determined that it was not genetically diverse enough from other populations of Meadow Jumping Mouse to warrant protection and filed suit to have it de-listed. Another group working for USFWS in response found that it was. Interestingly, the USFWS scientists reviewed the first groups work and found some significant errors, but after doing their own genetic study found about as much diversity as the private group did. Although the statistical difference was about the same between the two studies, the conclusions were complete opposites, so genetics still hasn't ended the fight between the lumpers and splitters."
