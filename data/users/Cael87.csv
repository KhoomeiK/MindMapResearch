It's a line I feel is tread slightly easier with monetary incentives.  Once we do evolve beyond the point of any kind of need through a technology such as replicators in a star trek-esque future we cannot really rely on slight monetary incentives anymore, so going to a system of praising or cherishing people who work those more difficult jobs would be the only way.

Incentives come in many forms, but some jobs just aren't as desirable and some jobs will never be able to be fully automated.  While as a general ideal the entirety of a communistic society is amazing there are some things that will need to get done that not as many will want to do.

We'd have to offer them some incentive, and praising them like heros tends to go against the ideal of not having castes or hierarchies.  So does paying them a bit extra, but the incentive to do less desirable jobs needs to be there somehow, and either way kind of strays from the path - but overall I feel a small monetary incentive leads to less of a divide as people can understand being given just a bit more for doing work that nobody wants to.  Once we do get past the point of money being an option because of something like replicator technology, then we'd have to transition to something more like in the clip, admiration being the incentive... but that moves us more into that framework of caste systems, point being that society will always be a working project instead of a solid set in stone framework."

And a lot of those people who would slack off end up doing more with art or performance.  All because you don't want to be doing your job of literally being a meat automaton for your wage slave master doesn't mean some people don't enjoy work.

I've always thought that the system needed more incentive for jobs that are less rewarding in terms of personal return and enjoyment - so I'd argue that a socialistic society rather than a full communistic one is probably better off in the long-run for being able to fill roles that people normally wouldn't want to fill and that can't be automated.  In that regard I don't know if we could ever really move past a system with money.

The idea behind communism is to free the worker from wage slavery, but if we had no incentives then the less rewarding jobs that can't be automated would naturally fall to low employment status.  We can't really go about forcing more people to work there in a society where people aren't forced to work as well.

Essentially, the owl would have to be small enough to never attack the macaw at all.  They are nearly silent when attacking and their talons are brutal AF.  In general you are very correct here, though Owls aren't that 'tough' - in fact they are rather fragile compared to a lot of birds, much in the same way cheetahs are fragile compared to most large cats - but they can still fuck you up faster than you can comprehend it.  And with how stealthy owls are, the macaw would probably not even be able to react.

We’ve actually had multiple containment disasters across the country with temporary storage sites, so ramping up production when we are just stuffing more waste into places only meant to hold it til it could be transported elsewhere, is not a solution at all.

We can invest in new reactors that can produce waste that can then be used again until it’s much less harmful, or we can invest in permanent storage for the waste we have on hand, but the idea that Yang’s handwave about new tech will solve everything is a bit misguided.  Swallowing the pill on even building a permanent storage facility or two has been a continual problem for 50 years now, investing in new infrastructure across the country would be ridiculously expensive, especially when people will argue we already have nuclear power plants.  Sanders focuses on wind and solar because it is proven, the bar to get things rolling is much lower, and the load can be shifted much quicker off our reliance on fossil fuels because of it.

Bernie is not hard to be excited over, and he does exceptionally well with typical non-voters, as we saw in all the open primary states last time around - where he was closing polling gaps of 20 points like he did here in Michigan by pulling those voters into a PRIMARY where much less of the public votes.

You're vastly overestimating the amount of people who are politically active for Bernie that would go home and not vote for a democrat.  We essentially all would, the people who wouldn't aren't going to be invested enough to be politically active in the first place.
