gadgets,ffx6ap2,t1_ffwnfpg,1580318654.0,"I""m definitely a fan. If we are defining working class as $10/hour then yeah, I get that $30k is out of reach. After all $10/hour is minimum wage where I live. Bad credit is a separate topic though I think it probably correlates with ""working class"". Here's some examples of ""working class""  or maybe ""lower middle class"" that I know personally.

The secretary I work with has only a highschool education and makes $23/hour and our scheduler makes $25 hour with an associates degree. They each drive a newer Japanese sedan which new would be mid $20s. Secretary's husband is a ""contractor"", self employed. he drives what I'm guessing is a $35k pickup (didn't ask but I googled the package on his truck). His truck is spotless btw, so no it's not being used as a work truck lol. I guess you would argue they are ""middle class"" because two incomes but neither went to college, husband has no job security or benefits. They live in a modest home by Portland standards."
gadgets,ffvzpdg,t1_ffvz0re,1580278496.0,"Maybe I missed where the conversation was about the self driving bit - I agree that’s a luxury I was saying an EV for $30k is no longer outside a working class income (though maybe your definition of working class income is lower than mine) Nothing wrong with a 7 year loan as it only adds about $600-$700 of interest. and rebate is rebate - they can put more down short term , or just pay a little more in interest and pay bills with rebates.
