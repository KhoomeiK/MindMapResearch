OldSchoolCool,ff8fmv9,t1_ff8f89w,1579676384.0,I was definitely too young to care for one and no adult would help me make a proper cage big enough for mine. Poor fella was stuck in a cage too small for his own good most of the time so I resigned to iguana-proof my room as much as possible and let him have free reign while I was at school. Which led to mine getting his tail caught in the door once and pinched off a good third of it. I felt like damned monster. At that point I knew he didn't trust me anymore either.

It costs more than ranked at 1500 gems to enter, but the player quality is actually a lot easier than ranked most of the time and why it's actually possible to farm. I do it cause I enjoy Bo3 limited, even if it's not ranked, and to pay for my ranked drafts and even bought my mastery pass with gems I've farmed from traditional."
