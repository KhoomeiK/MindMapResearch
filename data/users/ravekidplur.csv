For players like him and odom (Jersey hanging in my closet 5ft from me) to go down such a rough path is very surreal. These were guys I painted as a cornerstone in the foundation of my game. Really hope he can get some kinds help and live a reasonable life moving forward"
TikTokCringe,ff612ow,t1_ff5c855,1579616412.0,"Some of my closest friends that live in other states or hours away from me I've met online. If you share enough interests and have the time/capability to be at the same place at the same time doing things you both would do anyways, then it doesnt seem that weird. That's what I realized in the rave culture, like ""shit I want to be at that party too, you also want to go, let's link up!"" And then boom you're now meeting up with some stranger from a state away because you both found it to be a good use of your time to go to something, and from there you got a new friend."
videos,ff37s8k,t1_ff2rjal,1579535714.0,"""So the average american takes 4 weeks off per year, so we're just gonna do away with that silly accrued PTO model and move to flex PTO!""

Oh, thanks, not like my last job of 2 years I left with 240 PTO hours and a huge extra check like I always am excited for. 

Flex PTO is a joke, week to week management wont notice any difference but the employees get no transfer of the credits for days they didnt use. I think more and more companies are heading towards flex/unlimited PTO models"
nba,fesbgjj,t1_fepi9cp,1579363505.0,"Interesting. When I played, a coach taught me that if your elbows are squared to your body, and your elbow makes contact with another players face, its a foul on them. 

Maybe hs rules are different or this is a different example, but I clearly remember using that trick and indeed having the foul called on the other player, for me nearly knocking them out with my elbow. Only when you swing the elbows, is it a foul."
tifu,fec527o,t1_fe9rj3k,1578966763.0,"When I burnt my finger badly, ice made the most sense in my head. After a week of serious pain.and almost no healing, I googled how to treat a burn.

First thing on the list was to not use ice. So I can imagine OP thinking warm it up and turns out you dont want to do that. Human brains are silly."
nba,fe8nh7j,t1_fe62ecb,1578928276.0,"I was playing hs ball around this era, and the whole Taj Gibson age thing always blew me away. He was a very very old senior and college player, didnt know it was this wide of a difference though, jeez."
nba,fe8lrwm,t1_fe7mu3p,1578927630.0,I am a fan of it also. Really hope to see more stadiums do this.
nba,fe6cbsd,t1_fe65k93,1578886823.0,Theater lighting. Lots of stadiums moving towards it. Lights only focus on the court during gameplay.

IdiotsFightingThings,fd52mvz,t1_fd3ggaj,1578173672.0,"A facebook group that devolved into madness (admin banned all other admins and deleted his fb account with 20k people) who discovered him (superhumman, Nick is his real name) added him to the group. 

His dad films all the videos, and he hasn't mentally progressed in like 3 years. He has been doing the same stuff with the same catch phrase on different levels of danger for so long. It is actually pretty sad to see that he is just a kid with some difficulties being egged on by his parents."
rarepuppers,fcxj3d2,t1_fcx82oq,1578064185.0,Can confirm. Pitbull tails are weapons off mass destruction as far as I'm concerned.

nba,fcr65is,t1_fcpwm0q,1577897349.0,"Only until this year did I start watching regular season games with any sort of regularity. 

Up until then, I was mainly a casual watcher when working on my own game or when out with friends, or when my favorite team was on broadcast tv. It is totally fine to be a casual fan of the sport, and watch the accumulation of the regular season."
nba,fcm55uf,t1_fclh7ht,1577764509.0,Fucking awesome video. Was at staples when he scored 81 and witnessed a lot of these shots live on TV. Kobe is a legend that will be tough to replicate. What a freak of nature.
Whatcouldgowrong,fcjsd15,t1_fcittwk,1577702246.0,"What? 

I am an adjuster and used to sell insurance for like 20 states. 

Arizona and maybe 2 other states have the glass law and you have to pay for it, it's a 0 deductible for glass plan in addition to your standard comprehensive coverage. If this guy has normal comprehensive coverage, a replacement will still run him his deductible (unless he goes to a shady place that quotes oem glass and a bunch of labor hours and then gets aftermarket glass and doesnt collect the deductible from the owner). 

So even if he gets it replaced ""free"", hes paying an extra premium for that.

Edit: glass claims dont affect your monthly premiums, that's for every state. Pretty much no comprehensive claim will increase your rates."
todayilearned,fc93ami,t1_fc8ugb9,1577546335.0,"No idea why you're being so defensive. I literally stopped my pursuit of a WRX because I found out the clutch was too heavy for me to use on a daily basis. I drove 3. Maybe they're not ALL like that, but from my anecdotal experience of driving a very large variety of manual cars, the wrxs I drove had the stiffest clutches I can remember.

Period. You dont know the cars I drove and I dont know what you've driven. This isn't coming from nowhere, but my experiences.

You really sound fun at parties and all, not letting people have an opinion and all."
todayilearned,fc7e1w9,t1_fc7cuto,1577504668.0,"My options were finance a car like a used WRX, or buy a corolla hatch new. 

After test driving subarus, I couldn't bring myself to acknowledge it was a good daily driving choice.

Did I ever say wrx were bad? 

No. I said I didnt get one because the clutches were stiff enough to make me think I was in a performance car when all I wanted was a sportier daily driver than what I had. Dont try and read into shit I didnt say.

Edit: worked at a dealership and drove everything from brand new clutches in a brand new model year 911 turbo to evos to wrx to bmw to the 4 different manual cars I had. I'm not just talking out of my ass. The clutches were hard, gearboxes were shit, and I'm glad I chose a corolla hatch overall the ""sportier"" cars that would have me paying monthly. I have no car payment, a faster car than what I had,and most features standard. Will be a cold day in bell before I say a 40k-90k mile subaru with a clutch as stiff as rocks with a car note was a better buy."
todayilearned,fc6kni3,t1_fc5u8hn,1577482831.0,"Juul. 

I know, I know. Should be using a DNA200 rare wood exotic box with a drip atomizer. I sold all those many a year ago though so I'm only a hot boy vaper in spirit now."
todayilearned,fc6kku0,t1_fc5w8tf,1577482782.0,Drove 3 of them. All 2013 or 2014. The lowest mileage one with an actual track record of proper care had the heaviest clutch of the 3. I just couldn't do it. I talked with a few friends who have had various manual subies and they all told me that's just how they are.
todayilearned,fc6kf02,t1_fc605hm,1577482678.0,Automatic is entirely different world than manual. No hot boy worth a damn is gonna get an automatic to do the kind of driving this thread is referring to. The automatics are probably the polar opposite on the accident/dui/ticket scale.
todayilearned,fc6kc5s,t1_fc62j0s,1577482627.0,"I was specifically after the 5spd ones, and while they had a little excitement, the cons outweighed the pros HEAVILY."
todayilearned,fc6k7kx,t1_fc64asd,1577482541.0,"I worked at a used car dealership when for 3 years, have owned 4 manual cars that I've put over 200k miles on, test drove 3 wrxs all 2015 and under (one with 40k miles, one with 78k and one with 90k) and a civic si, civic sport, and my corolla hatch I ended up buying, and the WRX's were by and far the worst clutches and gear boxes I've touched. My corolla hatchback is literally like 6x easier to press in. Civic was like 5x easier. My corolla and scion tc and 4runner were worlds apart from a wrx.

I honestly thought something was broken when I started my first test drive in the bone stock 2014 wrx with 40k miles. The issue persisted through the next 2. Slept on it and realized I could NOT live with a clutch like that."
todayilearned,fc6jygz,t1_fc69lz9,1577482369.0,Surprisingly enough..... my corolla hatchback is only $40 per 6 months cheaper.
todayilearned,fc6jxc0,t1_fc66l9u,1577482347.0,Haven't since I got the DUI. That was many years ago. I work in insurance now so doubled down the train of thought.
todayilearned,fc5szyn,t1_fc5oz7i,1577465199.0,"Yeah I started looking for a WRX. I have a DUI, speeding tickets, and have caused a minor (parking lot) accident (but other driver fled so lucky for me). 

And let me tell you what, you do NOT go out, test drive a manual WRX and have the thoughts of ""well this will be nice to daily drive around town"". 

Clutch is heavier than some racing clutches I have used, shifting felt like shoving a metal stick into a basket of rocks, and the suspension is already pretty stiff from the factory. They're not cars you buy with the intention of having a calm daily driver. At all."
