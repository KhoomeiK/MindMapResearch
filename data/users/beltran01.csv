bipolar,fampo5l,t3_e9wwh1,1576209586.0,Iâ€™m sorry for your fur baby loss. My husband and I have bp. (Pretty neat coincidence huh) and have decided to not have children so having fur babies are the only things we have. I understand the love and support these little guys give. Sending love tour way care bear style.
