https://noctua.at/en/nh-u12s/cpucomp#socket_4275

The u12s should be able to cool the 3600, i am using a 2600x myself with the same noctua cooler and temps dont hit that high typically around 60-65c after a long session (3 to 6 hours) of gaming.

Maybe you could check the airflow of your case, for eg check if the in/out take fans arent blocked."

singapore,fe6klc5,t3_enbwyk,1578893986.0,"Go ns, then study after ns in ITE accountancy then move onto accountancy in a poly. 

Now working as a it admin coz accountancy pay is low and long hours of work plus most of the stuff is automated like an brain dead job. 

Whereas it admin pays better, more challenging as you need to learn the rules and protocols before allowing access thru the agency firewalls, etc. 

Currently studying in suss ICT degree. 

Tldr: waste 5 years studying a pieceof paper which i never used and prob wont use again."

Showerthoughts,fc2kci0,t3_efpxb9,1577364609.0,"Totally agreed,  was once a intern chef at a restaurant. 

The stove burners there are so dem good that water boils in <5 mins at full blast, obviously searing meats are way better on those stoves. 

Now back to a normal house stove, those stuff seems to have a maximum temp which is pretty low and cant sear meats on it well enough. 

Obviously i still miss the stoves at the restaurant as i m no longer a chef.  =("
