MakeNewFriendsHere,ffcf5ak,t3_est9jo,1579798127.0,"Hello, I'm 19M, pursuing a psychology doctorate so that I can open my own therapy practice.  I love animals, and I have a cat who I adopted from a shelter I like to go to.  I work as a cook six days a week, and I cook pretty much everything I eat at home.  I love to listen to, write, and play music, specifically on voice, guitar, trombone, and ukulele, but i am working on picking up the cello and violin.  Feel free to DM!"
SuicideWatch,ffcdkcc,t3_esqop3,1579797146.0,"I learned the exact same thing from the experience.  After my hospitalization, I realized that if I ever try again, I want to be positive it works.  

My favorite part was after I tried to kill myself in the hospital.  They stopped me, and a nurse said ""You need to stop acting like this.  You're just looking for attention."" Her lack of understanding of suicidal ideation was so atrocious that I couldn't help but burst out laughing.  I don't know how they hire staff for these places, but they clearly have no qualifications whatsoever.  (But I will say there were a few really helpful staff members.  The terrible majority of them just ruins it.)

Oh, and when I went in, the guy wanted me to change into hospital robes.  He proceeded to say, ""Here, put your belongings in this,"" and he proceeded to hand me a DRAWSTRING PLASTIC BAG before leaving the room to give me privacy to change.  Did they WANT me to kill myself, or are they actually just this stupid?

We need to reform these programs.  It's as if they're designed to make us even more suicidal."
BreakUps,ffcc14e,t3_esthsp,1579796192.0,"That sounds really traumatic.  I know from my own experience how any sort of communication with an ex can reopen old wounds.  

I'm not sure if your question is rhetorical or not, but he did respond to any major questions you sent.  It sounds like he might not be ready to engage in a full conversation, though.  It looks like this is really painful for him as well.  

I'm not going to sit here and tell you what to do because I'm no breakup expert (thank God!!!).  But if you need someone to talk to, I'm here."
BreakUps,ff9hl4a,t1_ff79l9e,1579713178.0,"I would definitely make it so that you dont see his or her posts.  I had an issue with my ex liking all my posts, so I had to take her off my followers list... (it's  weird because she left me).  

I didn't delete the photos, but I dont look at them.  I figure it would be more painful to get rid of them than to just ignore them.  I never go through my camera roll anyway.

And should your ex ask about it, just be honest.  It's  painful to see those reminders.  If your ex is mature, (s)he'll get it.  Mine never even asked why I didn't let her follow me: she seems to understand that her liking all of my photos was painful for me and... kind of weird."
cantsleep,ff96o93,t3_es3qmk,1579706108.0,You're not complaining: you're clearly feeling really distressed and frustrated by this.  I think anyone would be really upset about not being able to sleep a full night.

depression,fel6dz5,t3_epmgz5,1579215034.0,"So right now, you're negatively impacting the environment.  If you die, you no longer have any impact.  How about having a positive impact?  If you were to plant tons of trees (or donate to places that do), use rechargeable batteries instead of disposables, properly dispose of your chemical waste, drive a car with really good air filters and such, etc, you could actually improve the environment with your existence.  Plus, every breath you take, you're supplying trees and other vegetation with life-giving CO2.  They need us just as much as we need them.   Your reason not to live could become your purpose in life."

needadvice,fek3cix,t3_epdtks,1579191735.0,"The only way to cope with a fear that I've studied is exposure therapy.  I know that sounds ridiculous for death, but I can actually think of some things you can do.  

Here are the general steps:

1. Identify the fear you'd like to confront.  

2. Create a list of things you can do (pertaining to the fear) in order from easiest to most uncomfortable.

3. Start going through the list.  Do each item until you feel no discomfort doing it.  Then move on to the next.

So for your fear of death, some things I can think of for the list would be attending funerals, reading obituaries of people who died peacefully in old age, looking into some theories of what happens after death, visiting a store selling headstones and coffins, watching fake deaths in movies (maybe even war movies when you work up to it or The Hunger Games), and writing a will.  These are in no particular order, and you should organize them in order of how far each one is out of your comfort zone. And of course, add your own!

I hope this helps a bit :)"

Rapekink,feh4ueb,t3_enokpl,1579109173.0,"There is no difference.  Someone who is significantly intoxicated does not have the capacity to offer informed consent, so having sex with that person or performing any sexual acts, even if that person verbally offers consent in his or her drunken state, is rape.  The only exception is if both parties are intoxicated to the same level because then nobody has the mental capacity to take advantage of the other party.

The exception to this is if they have discussed this prior and the intoxicated party has stated that it is okay to perform sexual acts with him or her while he or she is intoxicated.  This would be a form of CNC."

Nothing wrong with buying physical books, as long as you still have access to the work and such (sometimes access to the sites where homework and quizzes are taken is included with the ebook.)

If you do choose the physical book route, I recommend renting through Amazon.  When you rent a book there, if you choose to buy it later on, the money you paid to rent it is directly taken off the purchase price.  Otherwise, they have postage you can print off when the rental is up, so you can just put it in a mailer and take it to the nearest post office at the end of the term.  I've done it once, and it saved me a lot of money."

DebatePolitics,fe9r4hv,t3_e5lunz,1578940764.0,"I'm not the biggest fan of him.  I dont think he's another Hitler like many of my friends, but he just generally doesn't show much foresight, and he acts really immature.  

The biggest eye-opener for me was his reform of the Affordable Care Act, which took out the clause that made it mandatory.  I wasn't a huge fan of the act to begin with because it covered so much, but when he took out that clause, he made the bill completely worthless.  The whole idea was that young, healthy people would be forced to be able to pay for the medical bills  of older people.  But if they aren't legally required to, what young person is going to pay enormous monthly premiums for insurance they hardly ever use since they are generally healthy? 

Then there is his insulting of people.  Calling people names accomplishes nothing and is an immature outlet of anger.  Like when he called Kim ""Rocket Boy"" before the summit.  He's just needlessly antagonizing people who could help him and his cause, and, more importantly, this country."
lonely,fe9nmey,t3_eo73e3,1578939803.0,"I am a firm believer that there is someone in this world for anyone who wants a partner: many people just haven't found that person yet.

The notion that one is too ugly for anyone to want him or her doesn't  make sense because nobody, and I mean NOBODY is ugly.  As a pansexual person, I have found that, even with people I don't find attractive initially, they become increasingly physically attractive as my romantic attraction for them grows.  I have a friend with the same thing going on.  So for a large population, physical attractiveness isn't even a factor that we consider in choosing whether to give someone a chance."

It took me months to realize that, while I did mess up a lot, nothing I did gave her no choice but to leave.  I did not end the relationship: she did.  I think I just liked to blame it on myself because a) I held her in some higher, infallible place and b) it made me feel like I could somehow prevent people from leaving in the future, if I just learned from whatever mistake I made to cause her to leave.  But it wasn't my fault, and maybe it wasn't her fault either.  I don't know, and I don't care at this point because what difference does it make?"
BreakUps,fe62xux,t3_edlfw0,1578880592.0,"Hey, thank you for posting.  People say that seeing other's exes come back gives them false hope, but there's nothing false about it.  If we firmly believe our exes will come back soon, we're  lying to ourselves, as we can't predict that.  But if we tell ourselves that we know for sure they're gone for good, that's  also a form of lying to ourselves because we can't know that, either.

While you have never directly harmed a child, you have watched some content on the dark web, which you sincerely regret and have since stopped.  You think you will only get worse, while your track record shows you only getting better.  You realized it was wrong and quit.  You are stronger than your desires, and I know you can get through the rest of your life never harming a child, nor watching content involving this.  

You messed up in the past, but you truly feel remorse for it, and you have stopped.  We all mess up.  It's what we do after that really matters.  

It is also really important for you to know that having such desires hurts nobody.  As long as you have the will-power to never act on them, you can live a productive, fulfilling life, just like anyone else.  Never harming anyone."

People take a long time to change, so if you saw a sudden change in his words and actions, it likely means that he felt he had to leave for whatever reason but that it was really hard for him to go through with.  He didn't want to show weakness in his decision because he was worried you would stick around and try to get him back, and he feared he wouldn't be able to resist that.

That sounds like a good solution.  It can only help.  I know they can't help you with the anger, embarrassment, ect that likely resulted from the write-up, but they can certainly help figure this all out with you."

That being said, I don't mean to minimize your feeling of injustice and maybe of being patronized, but at my location at least, nothing actually results from being written up.  It's effectively an empty threat.  I was written up for clocking in a minute past the grace period, and my manager (seriously a really nice guy) said he was required to write me up even though I was barely late. He talked to the second in command, and she just said it was fine.  Didn't even talk to me. 

In the worst case, someone higher up at your location might talk to you, but no real disciplinary action should follow.  The most likely case is that whoever reads the write-up laughs and goes on with his or her day, not speaking to you or caring at all.  

I also just want to say that you're really mature and sound like a really good employee and a good person in general.

Whether you made the right decision or not is entirely subjective, so I can see why this troubles you a lot.  In any case, being honest about how you felt was the best thing you could have done for her.

It makes me wonder if our friends simply don't love people the way we do, so they can't empathize. But who am I to speculate on that?"
BreakUps,fdbnhy6,t3_ekefxt,1578259127.0,"Me, too!!! I now only confide in a few people and only when I'm feeling flat-out suicidal because I don't want to listen to the horrible advice or the dismissal of my emotions.  Like I'm being overdramatic or that I can just catch another fish.  I KNOW THERE ARE TONS OF FISH IN THE SEA: IM PISSED OFF BECAUSE I CANT SEEM TO GET MY HEART BACK FROM THAT ONE FISH I CAUGHT FUCKING YEARS AGO!!!!!!!!"

ChickFilAWorkers,fckgeqz,t3_eho6i3,1577724749.0,"I don't know if this only applies to my location, but it was easy and natural to make friends at my store.  And this is coming from a very shy introvert who generally doesn't like people.  Just hang out and do your job, and stuff will happen.  They respect people who work hard at my place, so people very quickly started to like me.  Also, they might say or do certain stuff around there, certain inside jokes.  At my store, for example, they call everyone ""Sir."". Find out the inside jokes and start joining in on them.  It's all about mimicry, as I learned in psychology.  People like it when people do and say things that they might do or say.  It's comforting and validating."
Rapekink,fcjgg08,t3_ehh7o8,1577686680.0,"So you met a guy, fell for him, and I bet you two have been through a lot together.  But he finally came clean about his past and told you that he sexually assaulted a child.

I don't think there is anything wrong with you thinking carefully about your next steps; however, I really can't offer advice as to what decision you should make.  

What I can say is that there is no wrong decision.  It is all about what makes you feel the most comfortable.  I know this situation must be really difficult, and I wish you all the best."

ChickFilAWorkers,fcchuzo,t1_fccd3y7,1577598566.0,"The assistant manager and some team leads overheard him insulting me one time, and they lightly got on to him, and it's pretty much universal knowledge that he's rude, so I bet any manager would believe me.  I'm just concerned that they can't do anything that wouldn't make the situation worse, making this guy even more out to get me.  If they fired him, that would likely fix the issue, but it's unlikely because he's such a good worker, and they're so desperate for employees. So they would likely just talk to him or something, just further antagonizing him."

TooAfraidToAsk,fc6d1jp,t3_eg1l06,1577477701.0,"It depends.  Sometimes I do, and sometimes I don't.  Generally if I'm not staying long, I won't.  I have only been over one person's house who requires guests to take them off, and they are my Greek cousins.  Everyone else will generally offer that you may take your shoes off just to make you more comfortable, but few people care if you keep them on."

TooAfraidToAsk,fbzu4s4,t3_ef3p05,1577261659.0,"I want to do it.  I really do.  But the idea of being dissected after death is horrifying to me.  I hope that one day I can work up the courage to sign up, but as of right now, knowing I would be torn apart following death would make me too afraid to do anything that could pose any risk to me whatsoever.  I would likely spend my life indoors, wrapped from head to toe in bubble wrap."
ChickFilAWorkers,fbrcbcd,t1_fbqqxdn,1577041517.0,That's a good point.  I'd feel insulted if people constantly babied me and didn't expect anything out of me.
