AskReddit,ff41tsf,t3_ergjyj,1579553702.0,"Customer came in swearing we order this liquor for her every year. We have never carried this liquor, can't even order it if we wanted to. I explain this to her. 

She keeps repeating up and down that we always do this for her and says ""the girl always does it for me."" I'm the only female and I tell her so. ""Oh, must've been the guy."" He doesn't order, only I do.  

Finally so she will stop screaming about us always ordering for the 12th time, I showed her the computer and it shut her up and she left. 

3 days later, she comes back and corners one of my vendors to ask if he will order this item since I don't want to do it for her. I LOST it. Told her I'd shown her last time we have never carried it and can't order it on the computer so what the FUCK does she want me to do about it?  Luckily she never reported me. Hasn't come back since!"
