You have to take off the entire bumper/grille piece to install, the brackets attach to the crash bar. You also need to trim off the little plastic fins/guards in that gap on the bumper where the light bar goes.

The rubber boot is on the firewall on the drivers side, if you look under the hood you should be able to see the loom of wires going through it into the cab. Inside the cab it's right behind the gas pedal a few inches up. Pushing a wire through the existing hole is damn near impossible, so you can easily slice your own hole off to the side.

worldnews,fdmewh9,t1_fdm1fnv,1578547628.0,"Does it matter? Aside from that being incredibly normal, It's still flying out of an airport.... Why would you think something taking off from an airport is an enemy missile? Are you guys really missing the fact that it was still taking off when this happened?"
worldnews,fdlr1ww,t1_fdlbs2n,1578530456.0,"No. It is not likely. How do you monitor hundreds of planes taking off from the your own airport every day and then just randomly decide one of them is a missile... 

The crash/incident/whatever happened 2 minutes after takeoff, if it was shot down that means they would have been watching it take off from the airport while making the decision to fire on it."
worldnews,fdkpq0x,t1_fdkmtc3,1578508580.0,"It definitely does, but shooting down your own plane as it's taking off from your own airport is just such a difficult thing to fuck up. I guess it's possible that the US shot it down, most people here seem to be implying Iran shot it down, but then that would mean we are shooting down planes in Iran's borders."

I mean, I'm leaning towards Iran didn't shoot it down. Because how could you fuck up and shoot down a plane that just took off from your own airport that you sit and watch planes taking off from all day."
