neuropathy,ffdw312,t1_ffdpyvf,1579830365.0,"I don't recall having any side effects when I first started taking it. It's been a godsend for me. I had restless leg syndrome before I started it and that stopped after I had been on it for about a week. It's really helped the neuropathy but I still have a little problem when we have days where the wind gusts can get up to 25, 30, or more miles per hour. For some reason it makes me hurt.

Did you eat anything before you took it? I know we aren't supposed to eat or drink grapefruit. And antacids have to be taken 2 hours before or 2 hours after you take Gabapentin as it effects how it works."
HumansBeingBros,ffdp0ix,t3_esvr1q,1579825570.0,My grannie would make my school clothes (dresses) out of chicken feed sacks. The vendor would let her choose the patterns she wanted as she had a big chicken yard behind her store. It was a little country store on the highway and she sold the eggs there. That material was pretty rugged. It took a lot for 2nd or 3rd grade me to rip my dress playing at recess.
neuropathy,ffdfhcz,t3_eszqhv,1579819779.0,"I take venlafaxine, but it's for depression. As I have chronic long term depression, I'm on a pretty high dosage. I'm also taking some other anxiety meds with it.

I take Gabapentin for my neuropathy in my feet and legs. It helps but the wind blowing hard makes me hurt. I have essential tremors, too, and I think it helps those.

I have pain from 3 or 4 different causes. fibro, arthritis, neuropathy, etc. If I had a day without some pain, I would think I had died and gone to heaven. lol"

NarcissisticAbuse,ffbgqwg,t1_ffbdep6,1579764565.0,"A protection order would do no good against this man. He thinks laws don't pertain to him. And, it's not the shaming that he would get at the church thst would keep him away but he know that our security team would be quick to call the police.

I believe he was in town in May for the funeral of his ex mother in law. He's too cheap to spend very much money looking for me. When i took off, I think he was just about to either try to have me committed or kick me out as I am sure he had the next supply in the wings and I was getting boring.

I am seeing mental health people, a physcristist and a consular. I am healing. It's just I've had a lifetime of emotional and verbal abuse. So it's just taking longer than I thought it would.

My health is due to having 3 autoimmune diseases and osteoarthritis. I live with a low level of pain which is constant with periods of severe pain that can last days, month, etc. Along with the pain, I have extreme fatigue quite often. 

I have had depression and anxiety all of my life and the pain doesn't help the depression. 
But, I am doing a lot better since the doctor put me on medication to help that. I also have PTSD. 

I've am not as afraid of him as I was. He is a bad man, which is one of the only true things he ever told me but he is afraid of me in one area - he knows that I can out shoot him and he can't be sure that I don't have a gun. I've thought about the door bell but I don't have a computer and I think I need one for it to work. But I will look further into it.

I have no family except my daughter. I am an only child and both of my parents are deceased. 

It's hard for me to get out to socialize as I don't drive and I ask the friend that takes me to doctors appointments and stores enough as it is. I go to church when I can, when I am not in a lot of pain and or fatigue. I get overwhelmed in crowds especially if the noise level is high so I tend to not go to the women's functions or the potlucks. 

I'm getting better but I'm not there yet."
TalesFromTheFrontDesk,ffazjpu,t3_eslmlo,1579748131.0,"I've found that it also helps to not act like you are better than anyone else. I'm not saying your front desk co workers do that. Being pleasant and treating others how you want to be treated helps. I've had a wide variety of jobs so I can usually find common ground with others. I've lived where I was the minority and because of my skin color, it was assumed that I thought I was better than them. Once they talked with me, that disappeared. 

My advice is put yourself in the other's shoes. Be nice, be kind, and be friendly if possible."

I had an ex boyfriend who would ask me how I was feeling. If I told him I was fine, he would tell me that I was lying. If I said I was hurting, he would say his pain was worse. So, yeah I understand and it hurts.

I knew I wasn't feeling all that strong yesterday but I had to go to see my therapist. I usually see her every two weeks, but with holidays and sicknesses, it had been six weeks since my last appointment. 

Then I had to stop and get water as our tap water tastes bad. My job is to put the money in the machine to start filling the jugs. My friend who drives me everywhere handles them when they are filled.

After that I had to go to Safeway Pharmacy to pick up some medicine then went next door to Dollar Tree. I know where everything is so I don't just wander around. It's get what I want and get out. This time I started feeling weak just before check out. I hadn't gotten everything on my list but it wasn't urgent to get those things.

When I got up to be checked out I started feeling like I was going to pass out. I told my friend that I didn't think I could walk to the truck, could he see if he could park it closer. I think I scared him when I said I felt like I was going to pass out. The checker got me a chair to sit in and shut her lane down. My friend came in, helped me get up and we walked to the truck. He had found a parking spot right in front of the store. 

Once I got in the truck I started feeling better. When I got home, I just rested. And, that's what I'm doing today. I've been so sleepy so I just give in and sleep. I have days like that.

I had wanted to do a couple of other errands but decided those could wait until Thursday."

This election I am leaning toward Yang but who knows who the final candidates will be. As  Christian, I'm told that I have to vote for Trump but I think God wants me to think for myself. I am researching their platforms and will continue to do so until election day. I am not going to let anyone, family or any organization, tell me who I have to vote for.

Fibromyalgia,ff1hm3j,t3_eqxjnq,1579479362.0,"I have trouble with psoriasis  on my scalp and nothing I have gotten from a doctor helps. The only thing that helps is for me to shave my head so that I can get to the problem areas. If I don't, the psoriasis gets down in my eyebrows and on my face. I'm afraid it with get in my eyes. I've had enough trouble with my eyes as it is.

I needed to redo the shaving this past week and got the razor charged up and ready. About half way thru, my arms were really aching but I managed to keep at it, resting once in a while and got it done. Unfortunately, then I had to take a shower.

By the time I got thru and got dressed again, I was exhausted. I sometimes have to decide do I want to make something to eat or do I want to shower as I just don't have enough energy to do both. The fatigue is kicking my hinney. I did order me a shower stool as a chair is too big (where the legs go out). The legs go straight down and will fit the narrow tub.

Fibromyalgia,few5s54,t1_fevvi7j,1579405798.0,"Thank you for the recommendation. I read the description of the book and it mentioned two other things: one that used to happen to me and one that still does happen.

I used to ""know"", when I would get word that someone close to me was hurt or severely ill, whether or not they would live or die. This was in my teens and early twenties. I would smell chewing tobacco. An elderly man that I had known as a child and who I adored (I called him Papa) used chewing tobacco and for some reason I liked the scent. When I would smell it, I would know someone close to me was hurt or sick and would know if they were going to die. I haven't had that knowing in a very long time.

As for what I have happen now is I see things out of the corners of my eyes. Sometimes the size of rodents or kittens. Other times it's the size of bugs. I have always thought those were floaters in my eyes as my eyesight is not good since I had cataract surgery in 2008 and developed a toxic reaction in my right eye. I lost the sight in it for several days. I also have a cloud that moves back and forth across my eye.

I can chalk up the eye hallucinations to the surgery aftermath, but have no clue why I was smelling the tobacco back all those years ago."

The house we live is has 2 apartments. My apartment is a studio where I live alone, except for my cat. The other apartment is a 2 bedroom where the other 3 people live. One lady has her daughter with her and she works night so its usually the daughter. The heat and air con controls are in that part of the house.

Back to the fan - it usually works so I don't hear the music but not always. Playing actual music might not be a bad idea. I may have to try that."

Now at 66, I am doing better.

I don't know if I will have the surgery or not since I have fibro. I have lost 20 lbs so far and it's helped my knees. I can walk now without as much pain as I was having. I had gotten to where it was very difficult to walk as I am bone on bone and my knee caps are slipping.

One doctor told me to do the carnivore diet. Yeah, right, like I can afford to just eat meat.  So, I decided to cut back on calories. I really am unable to exercise much. I eat pretty much what I want to as long as my total calories don't go over 900 calories a day. Now, the first thing I do is check the calories.

At first it was a little hard, but I kept telling myself that the feeling of hunger was good. Now I don't get hungry that much. I have to make myself eat. I cut back on bread and cut out all sweets which have always been a downfall before. I am a chocohilic. But I just made up my mind that I was going to lose weight - mind over matter which is what I do for my pain at times.

I hit a little plateau once in a while but I continue with what I've been doing and I start losing again. My primary care doctor is pleased with what I've lost so far. I am going to keep at it as I am going to eat like this for the rest of my life. I don't feel deprived and that is a great thing. Every other time I've tried to lose weight I just give up and most of the time it is something I wouldn't want to do forever."

That didn't happen. Mom missed me and the back door was open. She looked in the back yard and there we were. I was sitting in the shade of the house with the pitty sitting on my lap with his back to me. He was sitting on my book that I had taken outside to ""read"". He wouldn't get up until I bit his ear.

That dog became my protector. If I was going to get a spanking, my dad made sure that the dog was outside and the door was shut. Dad had walked by Mom one day and swatted her on her rear end. When He swatted Mom, the dog ""swatted"" him.

Eventually the city said he had to go as he kept biting the postman. If I was in the front yard, the dog would climb the gate to be near me. And if the postman spoke to me, he got bit.

When I was 12 or 13 I was given a dog, chihuahua and terrier mix. She hated children and would try to bite them. When I got pregnant with DD, I was afraid I was going to have to give her up.

How do I do it, continue to live with fibro? I have to. I did consider suicide a couple of years ago but it was in response to the other things I mentioned before. So that isn't an option any more. I do have depression and anxiety but I am taking medication that helps. I try to have an good attitude about life now.

Life hasn't been a picnic but I'm hanging in. I am an introvert that has no problems being alone. My only problem is my inability to clean my apartment. I try but don't get very far. However I am looking into a service connected to my insurance that may help.

Keeping in contact with this group has been an immense help. I'm so glad we are here to help each other."

I married the week after I graduated from high school to the first guy who asked and gave up a full scholarship. See I was smart. 

But all of those things he told me took hold in my mind and I have always believed them. Every relationship I've ever had was abusive. And, I developed mental health issues that still plague me. But, I'm in treatment and I'm ok. 

I spent 8 or 9 years in an alcoholic haze. I was trying to crawl in that bottle. I moved back to the home place to be close to my mother, who never knew the things he said to me, and my grannie. I began to heal as I quit drinking but It wasn't much of a healing. Just being home soothed my soul and I miss both of those women.

I'm in a good place now as I am healing mentally but not so much physically. I have several autoimmune diseases and deal with chronic pain every day. And, I believe it's the result of all those years of abuse - 60 some odd years. 

But I'm a survivor. All who go thru such trauma in our childhood and live to adulthood are survivors. All I salute you all."

What was scarey is he gave the pixie sticks to a couple of the neighbors kids who's parents didn't let them have all their candy that night. This really put a damper on Halloween for years.

I did have a student who couldn't pronounce my last name and he called me Ms. Kubota. The other students teased me about working when I owned a tractor company.

One reason I say I don't act like a boomer is very little upsets me when I go out to eat or whatever.

But I got help as I went to a doctor's visit alone, which rarely happened. The doctor and 2 of the nurses helped me get into the safe house. I went back to the apartment just long enough to grab my bible, a change of clothes and my phone charger. The police wouldn't help as I didn't have an order of protection. I left everything I owned behind.

But with the medication and the therapy, I am doing somewhat better. I am healing mentally from a lifetime of abuse. A recent trauma is the reason I'm in therapy.

If you can afford therapy, it is helpful. If you can't afford it and live in the US, check to see if your county has a mental health clinic. That's where I'm going.

My ride was 15 minutes early which is normal for him. I don't drive anymore. With R being early, I forgot to grab my shopping bags and my shopping list was in the bag holding all of the other bags. I tried to remember what was on it and did a fair job but there were a couple of items that I forgot. Oh well.

I have been aching all over for the last week. The ache is just enough to make me really uncomfortable and it's hard to find a comfortable way to lay to sleep or sit in my recliner.

It didn't really hit me until he said the words, ""If you would just do as I say, everything will be alright.""

I was basically a prisoner but by the grace of God I was able to escape and disappear from his life. He has tried to find me but I've made sure to hide my tracks. He had threatened to kill me several times.

Please, moms, don't allow yourself to be abused in any way. My mother and my grannie would be appalled at what has happened to me. The one good thing is that I have finally gotten the mental health help I have needed since I was a child. But it is taking me so long to heal that I fear I will never be mentally well again."

Please don't feel ashamed of not dealing with your problems yourself. Sometimes it takes a trained observation from another angle to help you. I was always self sufficient and I didn't ask for help. I gave help. Depression and anxiety can do a number on how you view yourself.

You are worth something, a lot of something. A therapist might help you learn to love yourself (I'm still on that journey)."

Yes, believe in the Bible but remember that some of it was written for those times and their customs. The old Testament is history and prophecy. (I think some of the history is to show what not to do)

If you disagree with me, that's ok as you are entitled to your opinions and beliefs. I'm not going to beat anyone over the head with a Bible as that isn't helpful. I must live my life as best I can. If I mess up and sin, and I have and will, I am forgiven because of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

If I am unable to reach something or if it's awkward to get it into the basket, I will accept their help, or if no one has offered, I will nicely ask someone for help. It's all in the way you ask.

I have to depend on a friend to take me to the store and doctors appointments. Early on, I told that I did not want to monopolize his time. I always ask if he is able to take me to a doctor's appointment or to the store. I don't demand.
