AskReddit,fdlnnsb,t3_elq6wb,1578528144.0,Had a crush on this guy and thought I would impress him by singing to him in the middle of the hallway while in the 9th grade. Needless to say it did not end well.
SuicideWatch,fcpchpt,t3_eiejla,1577858234.0,"While it is not something people like to hear, it isn't your job to help everyone. That includes your gf. It is understandable that you hurt due to the break up. There may have been a way you can help her through these times but that isn't a guarantee. Instead of that focus on the things you do have some or total control over.  Like the fact that you stood up to someone who is  clearly very toxic all the while protecting your loved ones. You did such a good job. Who cares that you had to make up a thing lie about a bible verse. Apparently they weren't smart enough to catch that. Thus proving your point. Focus on you and allow her to focus on themselves. In the end things may be better for it."
TeamFourStar,fcpbz6o,t1_fcmwm5b,1577857683.0,Well that is something I am going to spend a lot of time and money trying to erase from my memory bank.
SuicideWatch,fcpbtzi,t1_fcp5j05,1577857534.0,"Yea, it is really sad to because people truly do need the help yet hospitals aren't cutting it. Especially since most american insurance companies will only pay for a 3-5 day stay. Making it so people have to leave with truly getting the help they need. It is one huge lie."
SuicideWatch,fcpbop6,t3_ei3ysm,1577857383.0,"I have had some good conversations as well as some terrible ones. I think the problem is that they must stick to their script which often times leads them into sounding overly condescending even though they do not want to. Really, I only use them when it is really late at night and I have no one else to talk to."

SuicideWatch,f8qtga5,t3_e1je3b,1574723804.0,"My daughter and the fact that I may fail. As a parent people have this assumption that children should be enough but it doesn't work like that. For me, my little one is enough,  but not in the way others may be thinking."
