The truth of it is, not everybody is cut out to be a carer. Even if they have a wonderful relationship, halting their lives, careers and ambitions to be a home nurse to elderly parents shouldn't be a question of, ""Do it or you're a horrible person.""

You're NOT a horrible person if you choose not to do that. It's a hard job, and it can have disastrous effects on people's mental health, especially if their parents end up with something soul-crushingly depressing like dementia. Also, nobody *asks* to be born, so no parent is OWED that help. Yes, they raised you, gave you a (hopefully) good life--but that's what they're SUPPOSED to do. That's what being a parent is, that's the responsibility and sacrifice *they chose to make*. It's not a debt to be hung over their kids heads later like the sword of Damocles.

But many kids do want to provide that help, and what I'm saying is that it should be entirely their choice to do so. Not out of guilt, not out of obligation, but out of a genuine desire to take on that responsibility. And they aren't worse people if they choose instead to let the professionals take over."

Then the kids turn around and say ""I never signed up for this, sort out your own retirement"" and shit absolutely hits the fan. Suddenly they've lost what they thought was a *guaranteed* safety net. That's when the guilt trips and love bombing starts, all because of their poor (and incredibly selfish) planning."
Explainlikeimscared,ff6ipgj,t3_erxfmt,1579628047.0,"Attacks aren't a prequisite to being diagnosed as having an anxiety problem. The key point here is that it is having a severe negative impact on your quality of life, and you should absolutely bring that up with your doctor the next time you see them. Make it clear to them that although you don't think you're having attacks, it is severe enough that it is preventing you from functioning normally in day-to-day life.

Even if you think there might not be anything they can do, they could still have ideas you haven't considered. For example, they might offer to put you on another medication (on top of your ADHD med) to handle the anxiety side-effect. Which, I know, doesn't sound very appealing, but often it's about finding a balance. When one med causes or exacerbates another issue, another med can help tackle that issue. Side-effects are very common and nobody is expected to just tough it out. The important thing is that you tell them, so that they can try to help you with it."

So many people fall into the trap of only thinking about the good times, and then you jump right in and end up tired, poor, depressed, resentful. You lose your identity, your freedom, your dreams. All because other parents pinky-swear that every moment with their kid is all sunshine and rainbows. Until you have them.

And **all of that** assumes you have a healthy, physically- and mentally-able child. Which is never, ever a guarantee.

childfree,fdd9zew,t1_fdd6ixw,1578301810.0,"You say that like it's a lot of money, but then you see all these mobile gatcha games and MMOs with loot boxes where people spend literally *tens of thousands* of dollars for digital 5\* heroes and epic skins, and it really puts that horrendous industry into perspective.

Like, you're right: £65 should be considered a lot of money. It's reasonable and non-exploitative, given that you're actually getting physical goods for it. So how on this mother-loving Earth do all these fake, non-existent digital items manage to command such exorbitant prices?

Sorry for the rant! This topic makes me mad as Hell, lol."

They want it to be as easy as having a load squirted up their tunnel, because apparently being a good parent requires that and nothing else. Not maturity, not financial stability, nothing. Just the ability to get cummed in. And if you dare suggest otherwise, you're automatically advocating eugenics.

Oy vey."

tldr: I've never said that you don't need protection in dangerous areas."

It's like the difference between living in the newbie-protected city vs. the PvP zone. Here in Carebear Village it's just not something I'm ever faced with."
ChoosingBeggars,fd0ogfr,t1_fd0cc5f,1578121618.0,"I get it, but imagine not needing it and not having it because you'll never need it and by not even having it there's absolutely no potential for it to be accidentally or purposefully misused. Like, you don't carry handcuffs or a nuke or poison for the same reasons. That's how crazy it looks from my perspective."
ChoosingBeggars,fd0bip3,t1_fd09tl7,1578116480.0,"Carrying blankets and water I get. Seatbelts, insurance, sure, those make sense. But a gun, for me, is the equivilent of prepping for a meteor to fall: so incredibly unnecessary as to be an absurd concept.

But I get why, and I'm not trying to say it's strange *for you*. But I don't live in a country where meeting up with a stranger to sell something is the equivilent of risking your life. If something like that happens here it would be headline news for how unexpected it would be."
ChoosingBeggars,fd04ov5,t1_fczhq1p,1578113583.0,"It's just mind boggling that you have to bring a gun to sell someone a PC. He said it like it's so normal for him, and I'm just sitting here like ""Is that really what living there is like?"" Sometimes (often) I think my country is pants-on-head stupid, but then I read a post like that and realize that my normal meter is apparently *way off*."
