 Yeah ! The thing is! I have been in really so called radical circles of feminism and guess what ? Any woman who was downright hateful and advocated for direct violence or even mocked Male rape victims had INSTANT ban! Literally the only seriously problematic stuff comes from TradCon women who shame men for anything and everything under the sun unlike feminists who only think that the people responsible for rape and abuse is the rapists and abusers themselves. In fact feminist theory helped in not hating men. 

And I get that all the Men are Tr*** memes can be over the top and downright hateful and what not. But show me a post where women are advocating shooting down men on streets ? Show me some popular applauded post where women advocated mass rape of men or instant slavery of men as a reasonable solution ( in a non joking way ) . Show me subreddits of women where they teach women to not only hate men but teach them tricks to sexually violate men and catch them young as much as they can? 

I am a misandrist and guess what?

1) I don‚Äôt consciously force men to marry or date me or have sex with me. I have practically just Gone my one way like literally! 
2) I actually went to therapy to resolve the issues I had with men 
3) I get equally disgusted with people who rape and abuse men and totally feel that Male DV and rape should be taken seriously 
4) I never have defended female rapists/ murderers/domestic abusers ! 

Show me an Incel  who follows even 1% of the above and then maybe I might consider the above points.

We tried and it pained naturally. He pushed harder and it pained like hell. I shouted out and repeatedly said no and stop but he continued and held me down. Then a minute later pain subsided and I felt a bit numb down there and myself. He kissed my back to comfort me a bit and this is worse part. His penis slipped of my ass and he was penetrating my vagina which is actually really unhygienic but I didn‚Äôt say anything because I just didn‚Äôt want him to touch my ass anymore ( we were in prone bone position). 

Good thing it finished soon and I was relieved but then I realised I bled quite a bit despite not feeling much pain.   I think he saw this and that‚Äôs why he said sorry. I did have anal tears before but it didn‚Äôt bleed this much.  the bleeding did stop in few minutes and I had  to clean up a bit but it was fine. Then an hour later it started paining a lot that I took pain tablets. And unfortunately I had to poop that evening so it friggin burned like hell. Had difficulty sitting too. Now I am ok and all I don‚Äôt think this was serious since the pain is almost subsided today and I able to sit comfortably.
