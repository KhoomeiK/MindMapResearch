Meltdowns are because your kid can’t do the given task (ie asking a concrete thinker to do a flexible thinking task). But the polite term now is to term ALL tantrums as meltdowns because ChiLdREn!

But there were rules:

Children eating ANYTHING, need to be seated at a table with a plate. This includes teenagers. Wait where are you going with that sucker? You don’t get to wander around with it. Sit your ass down!

There were designated toys. You don’t get to play with other toys. No exceptions.

Children who need to be changed get changed in the bathroom. No exceptions. 

When you’re done with a toy it gets put up before you get something else out. No exceptions. 

Quiet games of hide and seek in designated spots were encouraged. Yes... go hide somewhere for extended periods of time. Secret to not being found? Stfu!

Also we were expected to spend the bulk of the time ... OUTSIDE. Where children belong in large groups.  If you don’t have a yard for the kids... it’s time to say no. No they can’t come over. It sounds like you live in a small apartment or house where the only place to hang out is your living room /dining area. That’s not a good place to host a party of 15.

I’d also put a dollar on the idea has been thrown around that ‘it’s easier for you to host, because you don’t have kids.’ That’s not true. It’s just as much work. Even more because you’re not used to having kids around so you have to plan/prep/and clean for that."
