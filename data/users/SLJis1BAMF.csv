Yes and no. There are numerous factors involved (weather, soil type, climate, etc.), but this is the most basic gist to compare:

House grown vegetables typically require less overall water, but more frequent watering. 

Outdoor vegetables require infrequent watering, but when you do water it needs to be deep, and thus more water used overall.

In the conclusions on Page 16 it states:

""AT A 3% PER ANNUM GROWTH RATE OF CO2, A 2.5C RISE BRINGS WORLD ECONOMIC GROWTH TO A HALT IN 2025.""

I understand what it says, but our current pace seems to match up better with the Exxon graph linked earlier. So my question is are we supposed to see a massive spike in the temperature increase over the next 5 years (1.5C), or is there a discrepancy between the two models/enough annual growth rate variations since 1980 to give us wiggle room? 

Unless I am mistaken, the current annual growth rate of CO2 is at about 2.4%, so it seems that we may have a little more time than the American Petroleum Institute initially stated in their conclusions, but they do state on page 7 that ""if fossil fuel rates are reduced to 2% p.a. or under, it looks as if the immediate problem is considerably eased (but needs checking)."""

I accepted some of the lies told to us for why we were in Iraq in the first place as a way of masking the guilt I felt about being responsible for supporting the death of civilians in the revolving door of endless wars and conflicts our country seems to love getting involved in. 

When I got out I would tell my war stories while people would laugh and thank me for ""my service,"" but I never wanted to be thanked for it because I secretly always felt more shame than pride about what we did over there. 

Once people know that I am ex-military, they think that I am on the same side as they are about everything. I have to explain to people that ""no, I am not offended when someone uses their first amendment rights to kneel during the anthem because I would have gladly died to protect that right. No, I am not offended by homosexuals or trans people in the military because I would have gladly taken a bullet for all of the ones that had to hide who they were when I was in and they would have done the same for me. No, I am not offended or mad at people from the middle east because I found many of them to be more honest and up-front about things than the people here in the states.""

Now with what has happened recently with Iran I find myself trying to convince people who never tried to join the military that war isn't glorious and no one should fall for the lies that are spread in the name of political motivation just so their kids can kill someone else's kids thousands of miles away.

""Kenneth Starr had been defrauding his clients for decades, including Al  Pacino, Natalie Portman, Sylvester Stallone, Uma Thurman and Joan  Stanton. Ten years later, the government would call and vouch for Ken  Starr at a jury trial, calling him a “competent tax professional” who  was truly “trustworthy” while the government accused Wesley Snipes of  criminal tax fraud. Two years after the trial, the truth came out —  Kenneth Starr had been defrauding his clients for decades, including **Al Pacino**, **Natalie Portman**, **Sylvester Stallone**, **Uma Thurman and** **Joan Stanton**,  according to an investigation that netted corruption indictments  against a leading New York City political figure, Andrew Stein. *The government that previously vouched for Starr in Snipes’ trial refused to take any corrective action concerning Snipes after discovering Wesley Snipes had always been telling the truth about Starr.* 

1999-2006. **Wesley Snipes, an actor not an accountant**, sought out independent counsel concerning his finances, someone not embedded within the corrupt world Starr inhabited and exemplified. The independent counsel raised questions about Snipes’ tax status — questions Snipes goes directly to the IRS to get resolved. Snipes requests and invites an audit by the IRS. Snipes seeks meaningful answers to straightforward questions.

The IRS’ answer?

An indictment charging him with “tax evasion” – specifically tax fraud, tax felonies, tax evasion through conspiracy to defraud charges, false claims, fraudulent claims, and multiple misdemeanors alleging a failure to file a tax return, even though Snipes had repeatedly asked which form he should file and how. Unbeknownst to Snipes, the IRS began secretly shredding his documents, correspondence to the IRS and questions in something the IRS witnesses at trial admitted was part of “classified trash” program concerning Snipes’ sincere inquiries to the government he had paid millions and millions of dollars to in taxes over many years."""
