It doesn't matter in this scenario whether or not the child is actually gay, nor whether they became that way because of being in dance/theater/etc, because what they fear is the *perception* and they attribute that perception to being in dance/theater/etc.

This way we can actually determine whether we're about to be spoiled or if it's something we're in on.
