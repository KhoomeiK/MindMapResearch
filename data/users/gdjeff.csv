Once the Soviet’s began advancing the civilian population was hard hit.  300 thousand Romanian soldiers were lost while 833 million civilians died.  There was no land war in the US or Britain resulting in less civilian deaths. Great Britain lost 451 thousand while Us lost 419 thousand.  The Soviet’s, France, Japan, Poland and Yugoslavia sustained loses in the millions.

HomeImprovement,fdkjx3x,t1_fdkb236,1578505204.0,"Good, do try to reduce reliance on revolving debt and remember each time you apply for credit it lowers your credit score for some months.  Changing jobs is not a problem for a Bank,  as long as you are not changing professions.  They look at tune in a profession as opposed to being with the same company- an inexperienced lender might need that pointed out but most branch people simply send all your info to a central underwriting department for evaluation.  If you have equity in your home that will be the cheapest way to borrow.  Look at your tax value and value on Zillow and split the difference.  You will want to look for lenders who are advertising a set closing cost. By law they must order the appraisal so do not get one yourself - it would be a waste.  Also, use an attorney on their approved list for the closing - they typically have negotiated a flat fee. 

I hope you are able to get your dream roof.  Keeping the envelope of the house in good repair is essential."
HomeImprovement,fdk9v3n,t3_elt5cn,1578499343.0,"Not knowing your financial situation means I will need to be general.  Check your credit. Credit Karma is free. If there are any issues, straighten those out.  The keys to a good credit report are NEVER be late with a payment and do not use mire than 50% of any your revolving credit, including Hime Equity line if credit (HELOC).  Get to a point where you pay off your credit card balance each month. The amount of money that will save you is substantial.  If you have accounts to pay off, pay off the smallest one first, even if it has a lower rate than others.  Medical liens - don’t worry about those for now, creditors disregard those.  You want your credit score in the excellent range.  There is a world of information available on the internet. 

While you are working to straighten up any credit issues look for ways to reduce your monthly expenses. I recently switch my phone to Mint Mobile and saved a bunch. It uses the T-Mobile network.  Cut cable, get a Roku or other streaming device and only pay for what you need. Sling and others stream thru Roku.  Make a monthly budget and stick with it. 

When your credit score is very good to excellent, shop around for a credit card with a good payback program.  Bank of America has one that lets you pick your 3% payback category.  I chose online purchases since I do not enjoy shopping. Everything goes on my credit card and I pay it off at the end of the month. Last year because of a new HVAC and car (down payment). I got back $756 and paid zero in interest and fees.  I look at my card balance thru out the month and send a payment every week - that keeps me from overspending.  

You may need to keep repairing your roof for awhile but it will be worth it. 

Get at least three estimates, get estimates for what you want to do and for a standard tear off and new shingle roof.  Consider the cost difference and how long you plan to remain in your current home. Also think about whether or not you may need add in in the future.  Then look at your budget and how much you could afford in terms of a monthly payment.  Include what would happen if you needed a newer vehicle.  

Get an appointment with your bank’s local lender, take last three years of tax returns and the quote you want to accept.  Talk about ways to finance - this might include a home equity line of credit or a straight second mortgage with set monthly payments.  Consider carefully, do not look so much at monthly payment amount but first at interest rate being charged and any closing costs.  You may need to shop banks.  This is not easy but will make a huge difference in your financial stability.  Unfortunately our schools continue to teach algebra 2 and not personal finances. 

Also, if you have an IRA or 491k you might be able to borrow some of the money from your account. You would then pay yourself back with interest.  Mist of these programs limit loans to about 5 thousand but every bit helps."

(never hear of one going two years without payment).  work out a plan for them to receive payment and correct any adverse reports on your credit. Do a credit check, she may have used your SSN to obtain other credit. Lock your credit at all three major credit reporting agencies.  Let your siblings know you love them and hope they understand your Mother is a liar and a cheat.  Her threat not to help you is a joke - she just wants to use you and most likely uses your siblings as well.  Enlist the aid of your finance in dealing with the emotional fallout.  I would never seek out my Mother again. Not contact that isn’t necessary for your relationship with your siblings. If your Dad anywhere in the picture, I would let him know what has happened.  Good luck. Just remember toxic people never take responsibility for their actions. They always try to turn the tables by claiming to be the victim. No one needs a toxic person in their lives. I have cut off my brother for the last 10 years. I waited for my parents to pass but since then I have seen him once and that was because the four siblings share ownership of some property. I don’t have his address or phone number. Have not missed him for one second. Have a great relationship with his ex and two grown sons. I have never once criticized him to his children.

My dryer is 26 years old my washer 2. Instead of drying everything, you can install some hooks and dry many items in a hanger. or set up clothesline in garage.  Convection ovens are notoriously for uneven heating.  Try using a spacious toaster oven they only use 110 the one I have can accommodate a two qt casserole dish. Crockpot and hot pots use a lot less energy as well. your local utility most likely offers a free home energy audit, get one and follow their recommendations.  It is likely that if you button up the exterior of your dwelling that will save you the most. As you need new appliances do the research and get reliable energy efficient units.
