My husband is a D.O. and he’s the first person to say “you have XYZ, what do you think pills/modern medicine are going to do to fix it?” Like I had this terrible cold last year and all of my friends were like “have your husband prescribe you THIS!” which he would never do because it’s a fucking bad cold, rest and take NyQuil at night so you can sleep and get over it the way nature intended. 

Of course, it’s not like he doesn’t believe in modern medicine because he’s not a moron or a quack (he’s a hospitalist, most of his patients are seriously ill) but some people just think there’s some magic pill that you can always take to fix everything, or that diet, exercise, and generally healthy living aren’t as important as medical intervention at every turn. A lot of his patients wouldn’t even be in his care but for their own unhealthy living habits compounded over the years."
