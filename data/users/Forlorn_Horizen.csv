foodhacks,ffg3gwg,t3_et7w9r,1579897641.0,"With the size of the trashbag below and the items you are chopping into it (decomposable waste), it's going to smell like literal shit because unless you chop enough to feed 20 families at one sitting, you're not going to be filling up and throwing out the garbage before it actually starts to rot and stink.

Great idea... on paper."

Minecraft,feyli7o,t3_eqwfrx,1579447195.0,"I know the pain of trying to make the walls nice and crisp while using a T4 beacon and an E5 pickaxe... I'm currently digging out a 12 chunk x 12 chunk area down to bedrock and my OCD acts up every time I dig one block too far and go into the walls (I'm digging from the center out)... I literally have to grab my mouse hand to prevent myself from filling it back up since I'll still have to dig that wall out later xD

It kills me because this server doesn't allow world edit."

Edit: To everyone that keeps commenting with command blocks, the original comment poster said REDSTONE and that’s what I was referring to. Of course you can move things with command blocks."

Minecraft,fe65he2,t3_enrigc,1578882230.0,"Hm, looks good, but the dirt blocks on the corners obviously don't match up with the perspective of the sand blocks beneath. The angle of the dirt gives it away."

Minecraft,fe63g69,t3_enrg0y,1578880922.0,"Too much blinking going on, I think. It would contrast better if one or two lights blinked at irregular intervals instead of every single light blinking on and off at the same time. If they were all doing that every now and then, maybe it'd look ok, but if they're all blinking that frequently permanently, it's not quite as creepy."

Minecraft,fc1t56e,t1_fc1rsyz,1577328895.0,"Yee, I was going for a sort of ""wild"" hidden sanctuary look. The walls actually have 3x3 piston doors that will lead to a (not yet built) 200x200x200 chamber that I'll decorate similar to this, just on a much larger scale and it will have an enclosed river running through the center in a circle.

I'm still trying to figure things out, like what blocks work well with other blocks, where to put said blocks, and how to capture what's on my mind down in Minecraft, so tips would be pretty awesome. It's sort of difficult since things in Minecraft have hard edges."
