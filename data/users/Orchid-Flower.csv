And you should try a different brand, i am personally addicted to Yorkshire english breakfast tea for mornings. Personally I consider Twinings too weak in flavor."

Endo,fer09qq,t3_eqf600,1579348085.0,"Im always unsatisfied on how i explain endo to people. The people Who understand the most are my husband, that sees me everyday and knows me very well, my mother and other women with endo. Sometimes other people with other painful chronic disease show understanding. But i think you have to live it to understand how it is to live with pain everyday."

Dogtraining,fej57vu,t1_fehxy08,1579157381.0,He’s probably in the adolescent phase then! He will listen better in a year. You can try on r/dogtraining too.
Dogtraining,fehstgy,t3_ep43sr,1579123171.0,"I understand, i have a golden. If you get angry it’s worse, he will do that more. I usually bring treats with me and call him cheerfully showing him a treat so he follows me much easier. The trick is to redirect, with a toy or with treats. But sometimes I just let him decide the path and sniff every bush when I have time."
dogs,fehsb8l,t1_fehqztl,1579122887.0,"Sometimes my pup does that too, but if we check most of the time hes complaining because he’s sleepy, he wants cuddles but we’re not giving him love right away. So he looks at us with pain in his eyes and sighs loudly lol."

dogs,fehanxf,t3_ep5ems,1579112643.0,"My golden retriever is 2.8 y old, and he sighs. Often. He sighs when we’re cuddling on the sofa and I move a leg. He sighs when he doesn’t get a treat from my meal. He sighs when he thinks it’s time for bed for me and husband and he wants all the sofa for himself. I call him old man!"

Both Reggio and Parma have a lot of pride, everyone says Parmigiano Reggiano was born in their city, and no one knows the truth :) so we jokingly make fun of each other. But secretly I love Parma, it’s a beautiful city and the food is amazing, I will never admit that!"

Fibromyalgia,fee6lkz,t3_eolge0,1579027464.0,"I don’t, I tell them that I have endometriosis and my ovary is glued both on my uterus and my rectum. Women understand that quickly. Fibro is a horrible consequence, but just a few people know what it is, and usually it’s people that have it."

Dogs needs particular types of food in certain percentages to get a healthy diet. And don’t interrupt his kibble abruptly, or you may have loads of diarrhea!"
Endo,fea5ppv,t3_eo8jz4,1578944665.0,"I’ve got some endo on my rectum (external) and doctors immediately offered me a surgery. If you’re in pain, there’s no excuse to wait, as endo pain usually gets worse with time. Better a good laparoscopy sooner than later, and this time find a specialist that cleans everything in your pelvis and bowel."

I wish someone told me immediately, when I took home my first pup, that the first rule was having fun together. Your pup needs to see you as the funniest, coolest person ever. Not boring, not repetitively playing in the same way. Just funny and unpredictable. He/she will seriously love you then, and will look at you in adoration."

He doesn’t run away with the long leash, it can happen casually and he disappears also for one hour.
