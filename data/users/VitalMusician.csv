fatlogic,ff64aq8,t3_err750,1579618775.0,"There is a good amount of hyperbole surrounding sugar consumption.    


I believe that any well-researched weight loss diet is effective if adhered to. Different people will adhere (or not) to different ones, and when individuals find one to which they can adhere and suddenly see results, they often feel driven to prosthelytize others with sayings like ""sugar is poison-- NOBODY should be eating it"", when in reality what happened was they found a diet which enabled them to sustainably reduce their calorie intake while increasing the percentage of nutrients that they obtain from unprocessed sources, each indirectly allowing them to feel better.    


That said, [sugar has been shown to be addictive to humans.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6234835/)  


> \[T\]here is strong evidence of the existence of sugar addiction, both at  preclinical and clinical level. Our model has demonstrated that five out  of eleven criteria for SUD are met, specifically: use of larger amounts  and for longer than intended, craving, hazardous use, tolerance, and  withdrawal."

fatlogic,fen1jec,t3_eq1ksj,1579274897.0,"Something I'm struggling with lately is the reality that nobody actually wants advice.   


Even (especially?) people who ask for advice.    


It's an energy drain when upon feeling the excitement at the chance to help someone I instead realize that (s)he was simply looking for an excuse for why my reality is somehow inapplicable to him/her.    


At this point my response to diet/training questions is always: ""why do you ask?"" or ""well, what are you hoping to achieve?"", followed invariably by: ""find something you can do indefinitely that is consistent with your goals"".  Giving actual detailed advice always falls flat.    


Most people really don't want to get better. They might want to be better, but it's not the same thing.  TBH I'm quite judgmental of people who claim to want something but aren't prepared to do what's necessary to achieve it.  A goal without willingness to change is just a future regret."
fatlogic,femkp2v,t3_epwfvv,1579260392.0,"The fact that ""plant-based lifestyle"" is on here leads me to conclude that they'd rather just avoid thinking of even the broadest forms of self-control in order to maintain optimal health just so that they can indulge their taste addictions as often as possible."

[Overeating stresses the membranous network inside of cells called endoplasmic reticulum (ER).  When the ER has more nutrients to process than it can handle, it sends out an alarm signal telling the cell to dampen down the insulin receptors on the cell surface.  This translates to insulin resistance and to persistently high concentrations of the sugar glucose in the blood.](https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=39840)  


So yeah.  It's not yo-yo dieting.  It's overeating.  Which is also what causes obesity.  As far as CV goes:   


[Risk of cardiovascular events was determined over 24 years of  surveillance in relation to general adiposity reflected by relative  weight and by regional obesity estimated by skinfolds and waist girth  per inch of height. Upper quintile values of relative weight,  subscapular skinfolds and waist girth were each associated with  increased risks of cardiovascular disease in both sexes.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/089543569190265B)"
