AskReddit,ff8pgct,t3_es1gaf,1579690369.0,"No starting cults at my catholic high school. We were 15 and my boyfriend and I thought we were being really funny starting this bogus cult with stupid rules about ice cream and made up gods. Yep got in trouble for that.

Two earring on girls only. The rule was against ‘multiple piercings’ so I as an 11 year old girl only got one ear pierced. This drove the teachers nuts for some stupid reason. I was just a bit odd and thought one earring looked cool.

No nose piercings. Again, catholic high school. There were no rules about face piercings (back in the 1990s) so I got my nose pierced. The teacher threatened to call my mum so I said ‘fine, go ahead’. He had my mum and I in his office before he realised- my mum has a pierced nose as well. He eventually said something about how my grades were doing really well and he thought he’d let my mum know as I was on a scholarship at the time. My mum walked out and said wtf was that all  about and I explained the nose piercing thing. 

I’m sure there were more - I was great grades wise but a complete pain in the arse otherwise"

niceguys,fejf0ai,t1_fejbn9y,1579170959.0,As someone whose been tiny and also been large I hate to say it but if an attractive guy opens the door for me sometimes I’m too nervous he’s going to think I’m hitting on him and I freeze and go through the door and forget to say thank you- my brain is going ‘he’s just being nice’ and then my brain goes ‘well why would he be nice to you fatty’ and then my brain goes ‘he’s probably nice to everyone’ and then it goes ‘no he feels sorry for you big fatty boomba and that’s why he’s opening the door’- and by this time I’m way past the door and can’t say thank you without seeming weird. So maybe that’s why us fat girls don’t say thanks- it’s crippling self esteem issues

Due to some nasty medication I have to be on I actually put on a lot of weight a few years post gastric sleeve so listen when they tell you about what not to eat!

I’m also 36 and tried to kill myself in 2015. Life has gotten better since then but that was my lowest point. If you need someone to talk too about all the crap, or if I can help with any advice gastric sleeve wise please message me. And good luck!"

AskReddit,fecwp9o,t1_fece4wa,1578987642.0,Remind me of a friend who got ‘accidentally pregnant’ at 21 because ‘she couldn’t afford the pill’. A few years later her boyfriend (a different one) is losing interest and omg! She’s pregnant. She had a termination. Then after a few other guys she’s seeing a guy we all think is dodgy- something off about him. I stopped being friends with her due to the constant drama but get a text- she’s pregnant again. Found out her baby daddy is on meth. She has the baby. Through mutual friends I find out everything has gone to shit. She’s lost her house and filed for bankruptcy. I feel so so sorry for her but it was just one bad decision after another.
AskReddit,fecwfg2,t1_fecoctj,1578987321.0,Yeah I never had an accidental pregnancy- thought other girls were just really dumb. Now at 36 found out I’m infertile. Fun times

AskReddit,fecuvv9,t1_fecjh7g,1578985559.0,There was a really good documentary on that where they interviewed the girls and one of the guys. The guy was a total scumbag and the father of one of the girls agreed to the marriage because his ‘son in law’ bought him a case of beer. Really fucked up
AskReddit,fecuhp8,t1_fecodea,1578985113.0,I bought a treadmill desk when I was doing part of my PhD. Great idea when it was just mindless data coding. Unfortunately I have a dodgy ankle and had to stop but it was seriously a great idea and I got heaps of exercise

Showerthoughts,feckiep,t1_febm290,1578976141.0,Yep I do the same- overpay all my bills and if I’m having a hard fortnight then I can safely skip a Bill here and there without being in debt. For people who aren’t great with money it’s a good way of not falling into debt and budgeting as you know exactly how much each pay to go towards bills rather than get a huge bill out of the blue

At one point I saw a black tunnel and felt incredibly peaceful until I could hear yelling about turning the nitrogen down and giving ‘her’ some oxygen. I don’t remember another mask on so I assume they didn’t have oxygen and just took the mask off. But it was totally pain free and really chill. So I’d chose to go by nitrogen overdose any day"

And still there are medical professionals who don’t get the flu shot because it’s doesn’t cover all strains’ or even worse ‘I had a temperature afterwards’ . Like, yes we know it doesn’t cover all strains but it’s better than nothing. And having a sore arm and a temperature afterwards is not much to go through when the flu can kill people!

AskReddit,fduar6f,t3_en3igv,1578730522.0,"This is my own fault. Due to a lot of factors I was really promiscuous back in the day. I met a lot of great guys and several I probably would have gone out with- if I didn’t make such a thing about it only being about sex. Honestly I probably came across as so cold and uncaring. There are several I wonder about now including a guy I was really good friends with but had sex with without thinking it might have not been the best thing for our friendship at the time. 
I’ve grown up a lot since then and am with a wonderful guy who doesn’t mind my past. But I still feel ashamed- not at having sex but of not being considerate about other people’s feelings"
