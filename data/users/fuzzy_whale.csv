Democrats have failed by giving in to republican demands even in states where republicans aren't relevant.

Therefore the solution is to vote further left because one party rule definitely doesn't enable corruption fraud and abuse.

I always wonder how voters manage to become more politically polarized instead of less as they age. It's almost like there's a thing called cognitive dissonance or selection bias."

They also define working class as anyone who has a job, which would ironically include the CEOs and wall street types that this person probably bummed around NYC in protest against when it was the outrage flavor of the day.

Running further to the left in a solid blue state and deep blue city is exactly why voter's will never fix baltimore by blaming an insignificant minority political party (in this case republicans)"

baltimore,fdvhn1s,t1_fdsxmsr,1578747535.0,"|As neighbors who could afford to do so moved away from this
squalor, Pigtown ripened into a ghetto.' Whites were not the only resi-
dents to take flight. In this time of relative permissiveness in race rela-
tions, blacks also were free to buy houses elsewhere in the city.
Baltimore's black bourgeoisie, then perhaps 250 in number, sought to
remove themselves from the ""disreputable and vicious neighborhoods
of their own race.""|

|The “redlined” areas were the ones local lenders discounted as credit risks, in large part because of the residents’ racial and ethnic demographics. They also took into account local amenities and home prices.|

From your first source and your last source, with most of your middle sources being redundant and adding nothing new.

Your second link goes into detail about how the HOLC used determinants such as income and age as well. But the narrative being sold is that it's ONLY race that matters. Hence the 3rd quote from your last source. Journalism designed to sell a narrative. Anyone who does can be dismissed as racist and privileged. Which is exactly what is done on reddit.

Lets not forget the overarching implied argument that not owning a home means you and your family are likely to be junkies and criminals instead of the opposite...or that people are somehow forced at gunpoint to legally sign for predatory mortgages when they don't have to.
