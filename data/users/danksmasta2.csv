AskMen,febahak,t3_eo7ta7,1578956916.0,One thing that has helped me tremendously is making friends with a woman with absolutely no intention of ever being anything more ever. Not only will you make a friend it helps you realize exactly what guys here are saying. They are just people just talk to em like there one of your homies. Except less jokes about dicks and stuff.

I dated a muslim girl in high school. She had to keep it completely hidden from her parents for fear of retaliation. We didn't get to spend as much time as we wanted together and it broke my heart. Im sure it broke hers to but Im not her...haha. Anyway, we got found out. Her mom called me and said some horrible shit to me and made me cry for three days. I was devastated. She had to quit her job(i tried to look for her there multiple times and never saw her again). And I didnt know what happened to her for years. Its weird that i saw this post cause i think of her from time to time and recently found her on the internet(creepy i know dont judge i still care about her 8 years later). And i tried to reach out. No answer yet, i doubt she will due to this same fear. Or maybe she hates me who knows. But she seems to be doing well in a career and she went to the school she wanted. I hope she is happy.
Anyway, my point is, if you want out, you can leave. Leave op. Get away from your family and live your life. There is people who can help. You are in the US an adult and have a career. You can live your best life. I hope you choose too. You can do anything you want. Do it. Break away from this horrible religion while you can. Live. Your. LIFE."

depression,fcsqpm7,t1_fcsqjln,1577922698.0,Ive used alot of psychadelics. Not specifically for depression or quitting drinking but idk i def cant use them any time soon lol
depression,fcsgtoa,t1_fcrhea4,1577916325.0,Yes im trying to do things i used to get alot of joy out of. One of the problems w addiction though is something called anhedonia. Which is when you can no longer experience pleasure from normal things because your threshold for pleasure has skyrocketed from drug use. Its not forever but it takes a long time to repair itself. As of now enjoying normal things is very difficult. I will keep trying though!
depression,fcsgkpp,t1_fcsa3rg,1577916215.0,Thank you. I dont think im stronger than anyone else. I just have a problem that not everyone has to deal with exactly this way. But we all have our vices. But i think there is some truth in what u say. Its something i really want but yeah. Sometimes i just want to cuddle w someone and have them tell me everything will be ok :\
depression,fcrdztw,t1_fcrda2v,1577900551.0,Yes. I dont really know what to think. Ive become incredibly nihilistic about life and its hard for me to get out of it. I plan on doing some service work for the homeless when im out(i was homeless i want to give back) and hope that maybe helps a little. But its so hard for me to care
