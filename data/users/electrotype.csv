The only thing I can say is that Nano would be a better pick to achieve that than Bitcoin or Ethereum.

No one knows the future!:-)"
nanocurrency,ffahyat,t1_ffagim7,1579736159.0,"Because crypto is *still* only a speculation market, and Bitcoin dominates this market (whatever the reasons are)!

But what about in 5 or 10 years? Do you think people will still be interested in Bitcoin only because of its name (and deserved legend, let's admit it!), or do you think people will then be more informed about cryptocurrencies and will choose to use the *best* option?"
nanocurrency,ffagh1q,t1_ffafyi1,1579735185.0,Sadly I don't understand your question. :-( Maybe someone else does and can answer you?
nanocurrency,ffaf1v3,t3_esh3xy,1579734200.0,"People are *brainwashed* with the names ""Bitcoin"" and ""Ethereum"", and it doesn't matter if those are actually the best options or not... All they care is the price.

But the ones looking for real use cases and actual quality of the tech behind coins will have to notice Nano at one point or another!

Welcome to the community."
CryptoCurrency,ff3fy9v,t3_er7wm4,1579540249.0,"The big issue with ""Defi"", as it is suggested here, is that there are way too many parts, it's way too complex. Even Ethereum alone had its issues and attacks! How would it be if this Defi ecosystem is composed of 14 coins, 5 different protocoles, 3 smart contract languages, 3 inter-chains intermediates, oracles, etc?

This makes no sense. The surface of attack is too big. The risk of bugs in all the code repos is too high.

If you are trying to replace *money* (or to provide an alternative to it) you need something *extremely simple*. And without smart contracts or at the very least without turing complete smart contracts. This is the main reason why I am a Nano fan."
CryptoCurrency,feowk2q,t3_eq8x8b,1579306945.0,"Let's say everybody have their memory erased and they know *nothing* about cryto anymore! The words ""Bitcoin"", ""Ethereum"", etc don't have any meaning anymore.

And then *you have a task*: to rate 100 unknown cryptocurrencies from the better to the worst. 

The cryptos to rate don't have any name! So let's call them Crypto-001 to Crypto-100... You have to rate them based on what you think makes a crypto *better* than the other one.

What would be your criteria?"
CryptoCurrency,feddx33,t1_feday6e,1579008809.0,"The Nano community is awesome. Of course there are some persons posting  ""*Nano FTW!*"" messages, without any content, and I agree this doesn't help. But you can't judge the community only by those people.

I would suggest you get access to the Discord group to see what the Nano community really looks like outside Reddit. It's *vibrant*, with a lot of development going on. 

Many members of the core team don't even post on Reddit... You know why? Because they have better things to do than replying to trolls and being part of the /cc shitshow.

I guess I have more time than them, haha! ;-)"

nanocurrency,fd2e1fa,t3_ejrtvp,1578145868.0,"I like people who are open and able to change their mind! Cheers!

I would like to say that the beauty of Nano is also its *simplicity*. It aims to do ONE thing, and do it well. No smart contracts, no inputs/outputs, no mining, no ""defi complexity"", no privacity (""no privacity"" has a bad side, but it *does* also have a good side in regard to simplicity!). Sending and receiving value, fast and free, in a decentralized way. Period. Unix style.

Ask any experienced developer: something simple, in the computer/Internet world, in general means *less surface of attack and less bugs*. In my opinion, this is crucial for something that aims at being used as money!"
CryptoCurrency,fcyd63k,t3_ejeonz,1578078362.0,"If the attacker would send a small amount to the hacked address before transfering everything to his own address, would the protection still work? Would the protecting transaction still be valid?"

nanocurrency,fctbv3c,t3_eis14o,1577938434.0,"I predict a very, very, hard 2020 year for cryptos.

Bitcoin will finally be seen as outdated/impractical and this won't be fun.

I predict ""Defi"" (whatever the fuck this actually means) to have one of the the biggest Pump and Dump ever... And the dump will add a lot to the 2020 bearish mood (second half of the year or so).

In my opinion, we still have to wait 2-3 years for crypto to get real traction. You know, traction based on *real* use cases, not on dreamy shills.

I still have one major concern about crypto, though, and this is related to *security*: you loose your keys/seed? You have been hacked? Sorry, you loose EVERYTHING. There is no action you can take. Nobody who can help you... I'm sincerely curious to see what solutions will emerge to help mitigate this huge problem.

That said, my main bet is still on Nano in the long run.
