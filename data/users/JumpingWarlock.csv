dankmemes,fdme67p,t1_fdmcsts,1578546981.0,"That's a good question though. I can see both positives and negatives of banning homework. Personally speaking, I know I never did my homework (I'm also a temporary college drop out) and I got a pretty stable job...funny enough I'm working with a few people that have finished college. And my personal opinion of government assistance is: ""if it's there, I'll use it, especially since bits of my paycheck pays for the services anyways.""
All on all, it'll be interesting to see how this turns out."

PS4,fdmdc4r,t3_em4t6f,1578546253.0,"Welp. I can say that no matter what you do, you'll get minced. I honestly say try both Fortnite and Apex. They're free and you can delete either or with no consequence. Fortnite kinda gone dummy mode since they added bots into the mix. Apex and Fortnite both have a learning curve, but Apex (in my opinion) is more satisfying to play. In Apex it'll match you to ""similarly"" skilled players if it means anything. And I absolutely love the gun play of Apex. Fortnite has a Bloom effect when you shoot (bullets are random after initial shot). Building your way around the map can be fun in Fortnite, until you fight another player that builds insanely faster than you :/

TL;DR: Try both."
