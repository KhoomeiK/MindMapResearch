But in all seriousness, sometimes NFL teams are named after a region rather than a city. 

For example, the New England Patriots, Carolina Panthers, NY Giants, NY Jets, Arizona Cardinals, Tennessee Titans refer to the region/state instead of a city."

news,fffh7sd,t3_et8m7i,1579883895.0,"One of the big problems we’ve been having here is bait and switch.

You go to the dispensary, find a strain you like, and the next time you go back, the jar is filled with a completely different strain yet it has the same name on the jar. 

So unsuspecting consumer assumes that the product is the same, however when they get home and try it they realize that they’ve been had.

Here in L.A. the dispensaries are all run by gangs. As you may know, gangs are not benevolent to society. In fact they commit numerous crimes.

One of the crimes the gangs do is to bait and switch with dispensaries. What they’ve done is to replace a good strain with a strain that has the terpenes, trichomes and keef removed by vaping or through distillation. In other words they replace the good weed with waste product from weed that’s already been vaped or extracted. 

The other problem is stale/old weed. You never know what you’re getting when you buy pre packaged weed and it’s a prime opportunity to fuck people over because the weed industry is full of scumbags. 

Now most stores have some sort of customer service but the practice has been so prevalent that dispensaries are not letting anyone try it prior to purchase simply because they know what’s going on. 

Having the ability to test the product before you leave is important because it will keep shop owners honest."

I know there are hired guns for the NYC papers who get paid to stir the pot by posting unasked opinions on Social Media. It’s really easy to spot them when they come up with absurd conditions in order to placate them even though they don’t have anything to do with anything. 

They’re not fans, they’re trolls."

Could we use it in conjunction with alt fuel delivery/pick up system so as to offset any additional carbon from transportation/maintenance?
