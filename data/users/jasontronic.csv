movies,ffgecq5,t1_fffd1tm,1579904348.0,"I met him at a film festival very early on in Short Term's run.  He was just hanging outside after the movie and no one really knew who he was. I was like, hey, you were really good in that. He was just another actor at a film fest like me, but he's like in this career-launching spaceship of a movie.  So we just walked to the after-party and were talking and he's like, probably have to get ""an agent and stuff"" when he went back to LA.  That killed me. I was like, yeah, you might want to do that.  Its very cool to see how far he's come."

15minutefood,ffg8djx,t1_ffg6rbz,1579900668.0,"No, they could put up something everyday that was actually 15 minutes just cook time and I wouldn't say a thing.  I actually think the recipe is great, its just not the right sub for what they are doing."
15minutefood,ffg6ekg,t1_ffg3d6i,1579899445.0,"Yes.  That's what I do all day.  I time videos with a stopwatch and keep my results in a tattered notebook with a wizard, of my design, on the front.  You caught me!  Its not that hard to post in a sub that is germane to your recipe.  Maybe, r/IndianFood? That seems like a good place to start. What's the point of this sub if it isn't going to stay on target?"

15minutefood,fffwi92,t3_etdefk,1579893334.0,u/justtrykitchen you post a lot of recipes in this sub that take longer than 15 minutes to make.  I just think there must be another sub for you that would be better suited for what you are doing.

Meanwhile, the 2nd Amendment warriors are starting GoFundMes for their medical bills and wondering why they can't find a decent job when the economy is going so well.

OutOfTheLoop,ff3n32k,t1_ff3ias5,1579544578.0,"I don't think a lot of critics are biased that it's from China, I think they are biased that the Chinese government has a long and well-documented history of exerting control over tech companies there. Tt would be surprising if the government wasn't trying to use something like tiktok to further their own agenda. As long as there are totalitarian regimes out there trying to censor information to create a false narrative (looking at you Russia) there will be critics trying to bring it everyone's attention."
