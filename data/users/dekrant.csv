> 
> The league was quick to make such an offer, these people said, in part because it did not believe it would win subsequent grievances with any players it attempted to discipline. That’s partly because of a bureaucratic shortcoming: The Astros’ front office never discussed with players the league’s admonitions against using electronic devices to steal signs, according to Manfred’s statement.
> 
>The deal is a sign of MLB’s desire for a speedy and conflict-free investigation, the continuing power of the baseball players’ union and the fragile state of the sport’s labor relations. The promise of amnesty allowed the league to interview 23 current and former Astros players during the two-month investigation.

...

> A person familiar with the matter said that MLB determined quickly that it didn’t intend to pursue suspensions for active players. One reason for that, this person said, was MLB’s belief that it would be inappropriate to punish teams who have since acquired players who played on the 2017 Astros. For example, the Minnesota Twins had nothing to do with what the Astros did, so why should their championship aspirations potentially be derailed because they signed Marwin González last winter? (Limiting discipline only to players still on the Astros would’ve been a nonstarter in a grievance.)
> 
> With suspensions off the table, it became clear that it would benefit the investigation, the league and the union to simply focus on arriving at the truth. There were no intense negotiations; the league offered immunity essentially from the outset. The same rules will apply to the ongoing investigation into the Red Sox, who have been accused of illegally stealing signs during their run to a World Series title in 2018, with Cora as their manager.

In grammar, we have two forms of pronouns: subject and object. Subject + verb is the basic formula for a sentence (e.g. ""I run""). When we introduce another noun that isn't the subject, it is an object (e.g. ""I run home"").

* Who is used when it is replacing the subject. That's why you see it more often.

* Whom is used when it is replacing the object. It's not used as often, and our ears are being trained to accept ""who"" in this situation, so it's gradually becoming obsolete.

WTF,ffbhjwm,t1_ffbh68b,1579765597.0,"Huh, weird. The California equivalent was supposed to take effect January 1st. Here's the article - it mostly relates it back to fishing and gives ways to notice that the lake is turning.

>I had a very timely question sent to me the end of last week. I remember a similar question a few years ago, but it is a good topic to revisit. In northern climates, like ours, where temperatures get below freezing during the winter, turnover is a natural process that occurs in many lakes. If you are an angler, turnover can totally mess up your fishing plans for a day or two.
> 
> In the fall, the phenomenon of turnover starts when colder air temperatures begin to cool the water at the surface of a lake. Water will cool and the molecules condense. Water has a very unique property in that it will condense and get heavier down to 39 degrees (F). Below this temperature, water begins to expand and get lighter again as it freezes. This is why ice floats and forms on the surface of water.
> 
> As the surface water cools and gets heavier it wants to sink. Eventually this cooler water layer does sink and displaces warmer water in the lower portions of the lake and the entire lake “mixes” itself. Top goes to the bottom, bottom comes to the top, henceforth the name “turnover.”
> 
> As this mixing occurs, the deeper waters of a lake are forced upwards. This water is generally the “dead” water in a lake...the zone of water with less oxygen and decaying matter on the bottom of a lake creates sulphurous gases. When this layer of water first reaches the surface it can have a rotten-egg smell. If your favorite lake has normally clear or lightly stained water, and you show up one nice fall day and the lake is cloudy, maybe has an odd color, and have an odd smell, turnover is probably the reason.
> 
> The reason I believe turnover can have a big impact on your fishing is that when it occurs it is a total change in the habitat for the fish. Think about it…the water temperature changes, the water clarity changes, and suddenly the oxygen in the water changes as the “dead zone” water rises and spreads out.
> 
> Most of the time there is not a severe enough reduction of oxygen in the water to cause a fish kill (although sometimes it does happen) but the oxygen levels change and usually in a negative direction.
> 
> Think about what you would be like if some event lowered the oxygen level in the air a percent or so. You probably wouldn’t die, but you wouldn’t feel like exerting yourself either. This is what I think happens to fish. They get lethargic and don’t want to move very much or feed due to a lesser amount of oxygen available to them.
> 
> This condition in a lake, depending upon its size, can last up to a few days. Wind and wave action needs some time to re-oxygenate the surface of the lake and things will level out for the winter.
> 
> I experienced the negative effects of a lake turnover about five years ago with some of my regular fishing partners. We had planned a weekend fishing camp. The goal of the weekend was to fish a private lake that we had fished many times before and was a known producer of quality fishing.
> 
> Almost immediately the owner commented that the lake’s clarity wasn’t normal. The water had a green tint to it and visibility was only a couple feet. You can normally see eight to ten feet into the depths of this lake.
> 
> We rigged up and began fishing anyway. There were six anglers, all accomplished fishermen. Everyone was fishing different lures, in different patterns and all depths. In two days of steady fishing, not one person got so much as a strike!
> 
> We could see the fish on sonar, but we could not entice them to bite lures or bait. Toward the end of the trip there were some pretty wild ideas rigged up and tossed into the water in an attempt to get anything to bite on it. I don’t think you’ll see any of these rigs in Scheels or Bass Pro Shops any time soon!
> 
> There is a good side to this story. Once the turnover has occurred, the classic fall feeding patterns start and a lot of great fishing opportunities can be had. I think fall is probably the best time to catch that trophy fish you have been waiting to hook up with.
> 
> If you find yourself in a “turnover situation” don’t get discouraged. Just find something else to do or a day or so. The good fishing will return. Good luck on all your fall fishing adventures."
