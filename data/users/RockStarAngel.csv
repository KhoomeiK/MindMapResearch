Which got me that nose up eye roll hair flip walk away. This isn't even high school, girl. But, it worked. Now I think everyone is looking at my socks, lol. 

My boyfriend teases me about it all the time, but I'm okay with it because he loves me and is doing it to be funny annoying, and make me laugh. Not be all mean and judgy. 

OMG, you made me realize something. I do look at socks! My boyfriend will lazily throw all his socks in the draw without pairing them (drives me nuts), and he will just grab two socks and throw them on. Seriously, they can be two entirely different colors and sizes, lol. Unless it's for work. But I have caught him trying to do that and make him pick a sock and go find its mate. 

Oh no, I am that bitchy girl! Lol."
WouldYouRather,ffakhrk,t1_ffaidgp,1579737998.0,"I'll tell him that, lol. I think his point is that you have to go through public school with a name like Star. Which probably is pretty bad. Maybe it wouldn't be if your last name is Kardashian-West, but I see his point.

Truth be told this is an argument that has been going on since the day these two met. Who has the most fucked up mothers, lol. Or parents in general, I guess. I mean, it's all in jest, but they both have weird stories about messed up things that have happened. At least they can laugh about it."
AskReddit,ffajwtl,t1_ffaf4pd,1579737573.0,"That actually may work in your favor. She would appreciate that effort. And that shy, nervousness. I think a girl like that would find that endearing. The shy, introverted girl can see those overconfident guys for what they are. They don't typically go for the strong personalities, they don't trust them. Being weird and awkward is comforting, because they tend to be weird and awkward themselves. 

Use your nervousness and discomfort as your cute quirk. You're not at a disadvantage here, it's a plus for that type of girl. Will it always work? No. Of course not. There's no absolutely correct way. Take rejection to work on the approach. Tweek it. Use it as a positive feedback and keep trying.

I know it's hard. Unfortunately, you're not going to meet that girl unless you introduce yourself. But, you're allowing the nervousness in your mind dictate reality. She's just as nervously shy as you are, for starters. You both come from the same place. That should make this easier. Also, a lot of the roadblocks you have in your head will not happen. Some may, but not the severity you think it will."
niceguys,ffaifd0,t1_ffaexxz,1579736481.0,"True. She did say it took balls to wear *those* out. In that passive agressive mean girl way. Maybe I should have taken it as a compliment? 

I hate girls like that. I try to never be that girl. Granted, I can be petty right back, but those types. I never know how they can make friends."
AskReddit,ffahx4f,t3_esjr92,1579736136.0,"Depends on how much money, how desparatly I need it. If it was enough, if I needed it enough, I guess I would use my body in some way to get it. The severity of that would depend on the circumstances."
AskReddit,ffahqre,t1_ffagfnx,1579736019.0,"That's really brave. I hope your proud of yourself. As a fellow abuse surviver, I know how difficult, scary, and confusing leaving can be. And leaving doesn't mean it's over. We forget to be proud of ourselves to get our power back. To recognize the strength that comes with such a thing. I'm proud of you, but more importantly, I hope you are proud of yourself."
AskReddit,ffah9a4,t3_esjrey,1579735698.0,"I never bother with those. We do the Irish tradition of burning the things we are leaving, or have left, behind, officially ending that chapter and starting a new one."
AskReddit,ffagyiw,t3_esjrf3,1579735502.0,"My friend got an abscess on her nipple. No idea how that happened, she doesn't have children. The doctor thought it could have been a mosquito bite, on her nipple, lol.

It's funny now that she's alive and well, but it was a very dangerous situation at the time. Her doctor had misdiagnosed it at the time, and she waited to do a test that he ordered, and had she done that test, she would have died within an hour. Meanwhile she waited two weeks with an infected abscess, thinking it's a tumor, before she got a fever, and the pain became completely unbearable. She was pre-septic, and the abscess was going to burst at any moment, because she trusted this shitty OBGYN and waited so long. 

When her mother called us, we had to come down right away, because the surgeon told her the reality is she may not make it. And we couldn't tell our friend that. Her mother was hysterical, and it was more about calming her down, then my poor friend, who, really was doped up and happy as hell. 

That was weird. To be told your friend may die in surgery, but don't give her any type of hint into how much danger she's truly in. The psychology behind it is sound, it's a placebo effect. She's laughing, from drugs obviously, and you're laughing and being positive back, but you don't know if you will ever hear her laugh again. It's surreal. 

The abscess burst in the surgeon's hand just as he was putting it, I guess wherever you put it to do a biopsy. She never became septic, but she was on hospital watch with IV medicine for a few days.

We can laugh about it now. Her nipple almost killed her, lol. What mosquito bites a nipple? Lol."
AskReddit,ffafdxg,t3_esjrhw,1579734447.0,Coming home to take a nap midday and then going back to work. We need nap time again. I understand in Mexico they still do this when it's the hottest during the day. We need that all around. Lunch then nap.

AskReddit,ffaezjd,t3_esjrji,1579734148.0,"Humor is important. Life is so dramatic, I want a good laugh. A deep thinker as well. To have conversations until morning about who we are, what this all means. Appreciate the beauty and gift of life and how to make being a speck of dust into something worthwhile. Appreciate the beauty around us, in nature, buildings, people."
AskReddit,ffaeq7l,t3_esjrnt,1579733945.0,"I take it with me. Unless I want to come back to now being laptop/iPad less. If it's not busy I may ask the Barista if s/he can keep an eye on it, but even then, it's still risky. An iPad especially, can be easily swiped. I would bring it no matter what. I may ask the Barista to keep an eye on the laptop."
