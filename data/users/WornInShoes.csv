nba,ffx1zys,t1_ffvv39d,1580316040.0,"Many years ago, I went out one night with a friend to our local spot and had some drinks. I called it a night early, yet he stayed out. I got woken up in the morning to my dad calling me to say there was a shooting at the bar I was at; the first person I called was my friend. It rang and rang, then I heard his voice. He had one of those gag voicemails, where he pretended he really answered (""Hello....Hello?....nah man you just missed me; leave a message). He, with one other friend, had been shot and killed in an altercation outside the bar.

So I can tell you I've never forgotten a single second of that morning.
