It sounds like you've tried to discuss this several times and the problem is still persisting.  That tells me that they are either incapable of addressing the issue or they just don't care to because it's working for them.

For me, being able to deal with disagreements in a mature way is one of the most important traits in a long term partner.  Sometimes we get overwhelmed or overworked in the moment, so a certain degree of understanding and empathy are necessary.  But if they're really just hanging up at the merest hint of disagreement, that sounds less like upset and more like a tactic to control the conversation.  At the very least, you're left to tiptoe around on eggshells any time you don't see eye to eye.

That sounds like an awful lot of work to accommodate someone who's unwilling or unable to have disagreements like an adult.

Of course your mileage may vary and all that.  Maybe the rest of the relationship is great and if this is the price of admission you decide you can deal with that."

I'm proud of you for standing up to this creep, but you've done that multiple times already and it's clearly done nothing to stop him.  You see it as being blunt and standing your ground, he sees a nice, juicy piece of attention being thrown his way.  As long as he's getting what he wants, he has 0 reason to change his behavior.

A few years back a woman was murdered by her ex on the local university campus.  There was a news story about it that described how he would badger and badger and badger her by phone.  Most of the time she ignored him, but once in a while she would pick up to tell him to stop.  It only encouraged him.

An expert in that piece had a line that stuck with me: When they call 29 times and you ignore them, and then on the 30th call you tell them to stop bothering you, the lesson they learn is **not** that they need to stop bothering you.  The lesson they learn is that when they want a response, they should call you 30 times to get it.

I suppose if they get really overwhelmed and can't give that kind of heads-up in the moment, I could accept that.  However, they would need to take the initiative to reach out afterwards, offer an explanation of what happened, apologize and then discuss about how to best handle similar situations in the future.

Dude, he's some random Redditor you've chatted with over a couple of weeks.  This is an awful lot of drama over someone who has not earned that level of importance in your life.

Sometimes conversation follow a natural arc. They start off intense and then attenuate and fade.  Even with real life friends, most conversations have a natural ebb and flow.  It's going to be even harder with someone you only know virtually because you lack the shared experiences that strengthen real life friendships.

The fact that he couldn't be what you were hoping for doesn't mean he's trying to ""cut you out,"" maybe it just means you are looking for more than he can realistically offer.  It's okay to be disappointed but try to maintain some perspective here.

He's not a bad person just because he couldn't maintain that same level of intensity.  Likewise you're not a bad person for realizing this has become frustrating and unfulfilling.

I could be wrong, but this sounds like his mental health took a nosedive.

That's why he dumped you seemingly out of the blue.  His line about not wanting to burden you makes me think he either was trying to protect you and/or he was self isolating.  By the time he dated the next girl a year later he was an emotional mess.

None of what you describe indicates that he didn't care about you, or that he was madly in love with her.  It all just sounds like he has some serious issues to contend with.  Those issues manifested in different ways between the two relationships, but it's a him thing not a you (or a her) thing.

The thing is, you don't need to wait around for him.  As you say, you never even had a DTR.

This is someone who likes you but who is too caught up in his responsibilities to prioritize your relationship.  The solution to that is to part on good terms, knowing that if both of you are available and interested in the future that you have the option of rekindling things again.

Of course if he tells you about his past and there were circumstances at play with his previous relationships that you don't believe apply in your case, that's something to keep in mind too.

As well you should!  

It sounds like you have no trouble attracting women.  The problem is, your admirers include women who haven't figured out what they're looking for.  They want a relationship with you but only on their terms: one foot in and one foot out.  Once their ambivalence becomes clear, you decide to move on.  Then they realize they don't have you ""on hold"" anymore and circle back to have the last word.

The one exception in your list seems to be Woman 2, who balked once you indicated you were willing to take a step forward by taking down your profile.  That sucks, but it's not uncommon.  Some people only get a good sense of where they're at when things start to get real.

As for the others, I don't think you're doing anything wrong except letting them continue to engage after you make the decision to walk away.  Maybe in the future you decide to respond to radio silence by sending an unambiguous goodbye text.  Or you just block them so that they can't waltz back in later pretending everything is fine.

The drawback of being appealing is that there is no shortage of people out there who will string you along to fill time.  The only thing you can do is cut things off with flakes and wafflers sooner rather than later."

(Honestly, it sounds like you did dump Woman 1.  She may have come back with ""You can't fire me! I QUIT!!!"" but that doesn't make it so.)

If someone isn't on the same page (like Woman ~~2~~ 4), you're allowed to move on.  Break ups are not decided by committee, and if someone tells you they refuse to let you stop seeing them, you tell them your mind is made up and don't entertain further attempts to wheedle their way back in.

One of the issues with online dating is that if you're vague people tend to assume the worst.  If I'm in the early stages of talking to someone and they tell me this, I'm going to have a couple questions.

* If your condition is severe enough that it prevents you from holding a job, is it severe enough to interfere with dating?
* Do you and your doctors have a good idea of possible treatments, or is everything up in the air right now?
* If things were to get serious between us, what are the ways you would need me to help you manage your health?  Is there a chance I'd need to act as a caretaker?  Is there a chance I would be the sole breadwinner if we ever moved in together?

I can't ask any of those questions without coming across like a prying asshole, so I won't.  But the alternative is probably going to be that the conversation dies.

In addition to staying positive, a little bit more context could help:

""I'm in \[industry\] although I'm currently looking for a new job.  In the coming \[timeframe\], I also plan to go back to school and finish my degree in \[X\] so I can pursue a career in \[Y\].""

If your health comes up let them know it's a work in progress:

""Yeah, I have an autoimmune condition.  Things are okay at the moment, but it can be a real pain in the butt.  Right now I'm working with my doctor to find a better treatment plan so I can avoid or at least minimize future flare ups.""

Even if you don't have everything figured out right this very moment, just knowing that you have a game plan may help put people's minds at ease."

Have you heard the phrase ""the dose makes the poison""?  Sometimes it's not a matter of wanting to talk, it's a matter of:

* Wanting to talk even when you know they're busy.
* Wanting to talk even when they've indicated they need to you dial it back.
* Wanting to talk to the point of getting pushy or sullen when they aren't available.
* Wanting to talk about subjects they're not ready to get into yet.
* Wanting to talk but not giving them anything to work with.  For instance, constantly poking them with stuff like ""Hey, what's up?"" and then not responding to their answers in a meaningful way.  Letting them ask questions but giving them one-word responses that don't leave any room to further the conversation.

Were any of these things in play, or was she just unreasonable?  Only you can answer that.

By the way, if yous suspect you were acting desperate, that doesn't mean you're a bad person.  You're new to dating and just need some practice to figure out how to strike the right balance between showing interest and still letting them come to you.

You could have just tabled the discussion until you could have it in person.  Or at least done it over the phone rather than over text, where it's so easy to misconstrue tone.

You could have asked him when he'd have the chance to talk to his lawyer because yeah, you want to spend Valentines Day together if possible but you need to know by  \[date\] so you can request time off.

You could have told him you want to be sympathetic to his concerns but this is really frustrating.

Instead you got upset and shut the whole conversation down.

>I told him I had enough, regarding this particular subject.

Did you though?  Because in your post you write:

>I was upset so I said I’d heard enough and good night.

Those are very, very different scenarios.  The first is redirecting the conversation, the second is ending it.

Now I'm not saying he's beyond reproach here.  It sounds like he was being prickly and sullen and irrational about the whole thing.  That is not fair to you, and frankly he should acknowledge that and apologize for being a butthead.  He also needs to offer you something more than ""poor me"" fretting about the divorce.  If he needs to check with his lawyer, he should let you know when he expects to hear back.

You guys have some stuff to sort out here.  His ongoing situation might be the bigger issue, but the way the last conversation ended is the one you need to handle first.  You're disappointed he hasn't reached out to you today, but that's hardly shocking.  The last time you spoke, you got so upset with him that you ended the conversation.  Right now he has no way of knowing that you're hoping he'll reach out.  You mention in a comment that you've stayed quiet today because you wonder if he wants his space, but there's a good chance he's thinking the exact same thing.

Reach out and apologize for the way you handled things.  You don't need to grovel, and you don't need to absolve him from his responsibility to offer an apology of his own.  But get the ball rolling and ask if he'd be available to talk it out over the phone."

This guy has been dealing with a contentious divorce with a woman who cheated on him and then abandoned the him and their children.  God knows you have a right to resent this spilling over into your relationship, but I'm sure he's not thrilled with it either.

And rather than realize that the Valentine's Day thing was stressing him out because the divorce is stressing him out, you got pissed and told him you didn't understand why he couldn't get together with you, even though he'd **just** explained his concerns.

Then you shut him down and by telling him you didn't want to talk anymore.

This is not a case of your boyfriend ""going silent.""  This is a case of you telling him you didn't want to talk to him anymore and then blaming him when you got what you wanted.

That part is fine.  Stand by that.  Don't make a liar out of yourself by giving in when she tries to strike up idle chit-chat with you.

Here's the part where your approach needs adjusting: You're doing this in the hope of changing her behavior.  That's not going to happen, and frankly you don't want it to happen.

* According to your last post, she lied to her current guy about having met you during the last 2 months.
* She's continued to pester you with texts every day after you made it clear you didn't want to stay in touch unless she wanted to be exclusive.
* In this conversation, after telling you to leave the door closed, she made a point to bring up the other guy and let you know she was happy with the way that was going.  It really sounds like she's trying to make you insecure by rubbing that in your face.
* She's continued to send little messages hoping to get a response from you.

So is the green flag a divorce?

Relationship stats like this are only useful as part of the larger story.  In my city, it's entirely normal to be single at 30.  Here are some reasons an otherwise relationship-minded person might not have married in their 20s:

* They didn't meet the right person
* Shyness / anxiety made dating difficult
* They focused on a demanding job / degree
* Moving around a lot made dating difficult
* They were in relationships that ended
* Their location / schedule made dating difficult
* They wanted to achieve a certain level of personal stability (health/career/finances) before they put themselves on the dating market.

Obviously there are people out there who never settled down because they have no interest in committed relationships or they lack the interpersonal skills to maintain them.  However, you don't have enough information to tell if that's the case here.

Instead of speculating if there's a problem, get to know people as individuals and then make your own decision if you two are compatible."

For the record, I'm not saying you should.

This sub is full of posts from people who like someone but are so afraid of looking thirsty that they won't ask for the date, won't send the first text, won't break the touch barrier, won't ask where things stand, etc.  They sit around waiting on the other person to take the risks because they believe they're not supposed to or that they'll lose cool points or something.

Maybe it's more accurate to say ""If they like you AND they communicate clearly AND they take initiative AND you're not viewing them through the prism of your own insecurities, you'll know.""

Now, is the solution to go chasing after everyone no matter how distant or half-assed they act?  No.  Step up, communicate your interest, demonstrate warmth, be willing to show some initiative.  If things progress smoothly and with effort on both sides then great!  If it feels like pulling teeth, then you know this probably isn't a situation where you should be investing your time and energy.

What you can't always know is their level of interest.  An anxious person and a disinterested person can look very similar.  Thankfully, it's not our job to figure out their motivations, just to recognize their actions.

But on that note, a lot of folks here could stand to remember that principle applies to them as much as it applies to others.  It doesn't matter how you secretly like a person if your actions don't line up.  So if you're interested in someone *let them know*."
