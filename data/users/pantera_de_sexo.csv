farmingsimulator,ff5grgs,t3_erh32d,1579592168.0,Get that monster krone rake and by the end of the field you will have just one massive windrow
farmingsimulator,ff39fsj,t1_ff36jt1,1579536805.0,Yeah I agree. Do you know whether or not it affects yield to leave weeds until they fill the whole field as long as they are killed before my crops are ready to harvest?
farmingsimulator,ff2f6f2,t3_eqq0u8,1579503579.0,Has anyone had the issue where you can't hire a worker to spray weeds with seasons? On xbox one btw
educationalgifs,fehf3wu,t1_fehedwy,1579115241.0,There's also a subreddit r/kenm. If you browse by top of all time it's gold
educationalgifs,fehexi2,t1_feh9wm6,1579115137.0,Its only in that path at 24hz. Someone posted the full video in the comments here where they change the camera speed to 25hz and you can see the water taking a different path. Normal shutter speed I think it would just look like a spray
educationalgifs,feheg0k,t1_fehdyln,1579114853.0,"No worries mate. A sound wave is vibrations in a physical medium, usually air. Since the air is physically vibrating, it can have an effect on objects. Electromagnetic waves are ""vibrations"" in the EM field, which exists everywhere but isn't exactly physical. Since there is no physical medium they do not produce movement"

toptalent,fe4q389,t3_enozq9,1578861774.0,Isn't there a whole trick where you bet some one they can't break an egg in the palm of their hand? Also it looks like he's using his wrist/forearm more than his hand.

educationalgifs,fd766sw,t1_fd6j4k4,1578199947.0,Pretty sure the golden eagle's listed speed was at a dive as well. There's no way they can fly 200 mph under their own power.
nfl,fclsw6b,t1_fclflux,1577755661.0,"That guy sounds like a dick but even as a kid I thought the parents who complained about the best players not being subbed were ridiculous. Like your kid sucks lady, he's not going to play as much as the kids who spent time practicing and are actually good. And this is coming from a kid who sucked at basketball. I'd hear them say ""it's just a 6th grade football game who cares about winning?"" And I was like uhhhhh..... we do? We might be kids but we're here to compete not just run around for an hour purely for your entertainment"
