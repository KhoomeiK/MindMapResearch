My sister was manipulated into staying into a romantic relationship with a guy for a while on threat of suicide. I had a friend who I’d known since high school who did a 180 and did nothing but ask for favors and money because of how hard is life was (not real help like finding jobs or escaping abusive situations... like bar hangout cash and trips across country to meet online girls.) Both of those people are alive and posting positive stuff on Facebook all the time

Every situation is different, but please understand and acknowledge he isn’t your problem. I feel for you because you have so much empathy, but sometimes you gotta wall off your heart bro... protect yourself a little"

offmychest,ff352px,t3_ere2fm,1579533869.0,"Your writing style, the way you put together multiple thoughts, the things you worry about, and the way your brain works reminds me a lot of myself. Because of that, I’m gonna tell you this in a harsh way because that’s what I would’ve needed when I was that age (I’m not an asshole I promise, but this is important!)

YOU. DONT. OWE. HIM. SHIT. His life... his problems... none of that is your responsibility. The only thing that matters is that you take care of yourself and your inner circle of loved ones. 

The only thing that could make you an asshole is acting directly rude (like literally name-calling or getting physical.) Expressing your feelings maturely (even negative feelings) or just cutting him off is fine.

I’m not religious but this is my goto piece of advice: Don’t try to save everyone. The only one who came close to saving everyone was Jesus and it killed him, so us normal people don’t have a chance."

LifeProTips,fc5l76i,t3_egbswb,1577460559.0,"This is kind of inaccurate. Unless the website is asking you for your debit card PIN (which is super bad,) then your transaction IS being run as credit.

Also, you can certainly dispute transactions ran as debit.

The only thing we should expect is the functionality available right now. We were never promised replay control and as such shouldn’t expect it. Simple as that. You have no idea how much it would cost them to both create a system that can control replays, and also store said replays for every single player. I’m not a SC analytics employee or project manager, so neither do I.

Don’t expect respect for having *semi*-related professional experience after claiming supercell has “200 years” of server time paid off for functionality that was never promised, with no access to supporting data."
