fatlogic,fffe1as,t1_fffa0q4,1579881906.0,"Same...not 1400 but 1,000. Couldn't sleep. Have a big night planned tonight, too. Today's calories are painful. Ah well. It happens!"
fatlogic,ff5w5xb,t1_ff5q66g,1579612281.0,"The specialist (rheumatologist for my joint pain) and the physical therapist both did that, I am on the ""extreme end"" of hypermobility but there is a genetic test that can be done for certain tims of EDS where as other types are symptoms and eliminating other potential causes. As I mentioned, though, the specialist blew me off after about 10 minutes and telling me they could try changing my anti inflammatory medication. Felt awesome after an 8 hour round trip to see him. I have a lot of animosity towards the medical community due to my 17 year fight for proper treatment for this as well as during my cancer ordeal and almost losing a foot due to a doctor ignoring my insane leg pain."
fatlogic,ff55a8u,t1_ff531jr,1579580627.0,"No idea, doctors have a pretty strong history of blowing me off. I have been doing PT to help stabilize my joints more but the therapist says I have really strong surrounding muscles as is and there isn't a whole lot more they can do. The PT suspect I may have Ehlers Danlos but the doctors won't test for it."
fatlogic,ff4vmgt,t1_ff4s2zz,1579573518.0,"It is hard to not over extend my joints when I am doing things like lifting weights - I have to be incredibly aware of how I move while doing it, I can't lift heavy because it causes popping and grinding in my joints, I love hiking but hurt my knee back in September because the uneven ground caused my knee to move in ways it normally shouldn't, if I sit or lay in certain position I can feel my hips trying to slide out of place and have to move quickly to stop it (it's excruciating). Basically my joints are just too loose so there is more wear and tear on them because they move too much. Being strong definitely helps provide more stability but it will always be something I struggle with. I now have chronic pain in most of my joints due to this."
fatlogic,ff4nne3,t3_erdeb4,1579568013.0,"I had a horrible accident when I was 14 that seriously fucked my lower back, neck, and pelvis. Then I got fibromyalgia. I gained a ton of weight from depression, pain making it too hard to exercise, and falsely believing the reason why I couldn't lose weight was because I couldn't exercise. Stumbled on this sub and started realizing how full of shit and excuses I was. Started counting calories. I didn't notice an improvement until I lost a significant amount of weight then I suddenly realized my fibro pain was suddenly much better. I still have horrible back and pelvis pain but it is mostly tolerable. Sadly, I learned I have extreme hypermobility and it is causing serious issues and pain now that I am a lot more active. Not sure how to navigate an active lifestyle from this point but I refuse to stop doing the things I love."
Parenting,ff4mlf0,t3_erjp7v,1579567268.0,"I always get asked if she is mine, if I am her mom, or people assume my sister is her mom is she is with us. My daughter is blonde and has long perfect curls. She loves dresses and being ""pretty"" and I am..well, goth. Shaved hair. Pierced. She is also a huge extrovert and I am absolutely not."
fatlogic,ff23bof,t3_er3kr1,1579492659.0,This has got to be a troll. I refuse to believe otherwise.

AskWomen,femm255,t3_epylgc,1579262089.0,"Generally I love red heads, even if they aren't full ginger. I think it is because they are (mostly) lacking a soul which meshes well with my soul lacking."
adhdmeme,fed4vz3,t3_eoelny,1578998993.0,"I'm the reverse, my medication makes me wind down enough to where I can actually sleep. Otherwise..it is like now - almost 3 am and I just got done cleaning my kitchen cupboards and fridge out. My 2 year old wakes up in 4 hours. Ugh."

My600lbLife,fdouexf,t1_fdocdyp,1578613112.0,"I always have to admit my shitty eating after a while because the heartburn gets so bad I can't deny it, haha. My body is just much happier on a non-carb heavy diet."
My600lbLife,fdoao1t,t1_fdo5vjq,1578601777.0,"Just a pound? Jeez. I ""gained"" 6lbs this week (ate enough for 0.5lb gain) just because I had pasta. The water weight is real."
fatlogic,fdkign9,t1_fdkg9ii,1578504485.0,Sitting at 26.5 and my dad is upset that I will want to lose 10lbs more (high end BMI..then reevaluate) saying I am too thin already and is worried I will become anorexic. Jeez.
fatlogic,fdfgt5r,t1_fdean75,1578361356.0,"Also wanting to know this brand. 10"" difference and it is misery finding pants that fit. Tight on my hips but gapes on my waist."
fatlogic,fddu34c,t1_fdcj0wd,1578323999.0,"I'm so thankful that I learned how to eat without feeling deprived while also losing weight. 100% what has made it successful for me. Years of trying different diets always failing due to the feelings of deprivation. Who knew I could eat whatever I wanted within my calorie goals. Easy peasy, delicious lemon squeezy."
fatlogic,fddtwtb,t1_fdceipq,1578323873.0,"I'm coming close to my goal weight and the idea of maintainence is terrifying. I plan to continue exactly what I do now - weekly weigh in, weekly menu, MFP logging. Routine and tracking is what led me to successful weight loss and I plan to keep doing it to keep the weight off."
