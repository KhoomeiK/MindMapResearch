Guess who is holding shares of Epic and Reddit? A Chinese company called Tencent. The ones that own the Chinese government sanctioned WhatsApp wechat. 
So they know how to silence critic voices..."
pcgaming,fgvm2v9,t1_fgvkhc0,1581150509.0,If wearing a tinfoil hat means that I’m for open discussions and against censorship then I’m wearing it in a very proud way. :-)
pcgaming,fgvlqkq,t1_fgvibiw,1581150343.0,Yea but bandwagoning is part of a discussion. It’s part of reddit. It’s not good and not bad. It’s people expressing their emotions about a topic.
pcgaming,fgvlja8,t1_fgve499,1581150244.0,"Some call it cycle jerk, some call it discussion. Just because people reiterate the same again and again it isn’t bad. It’s part of discussions itself. Democratic systems are based on circle jerking the same topics again and again. Discussion is good. Knowing what others think is good. 
Reddit worked for years like this. And now that a big company is throwing money around and the Chinese part of this company owns also a part of reddit let’s introduce contest mode... what a coincidence."
pcgaming,fgvknme,t1_fgvel4w,1581150031.0,"So people protesting against this stuff are being banned for a week. This isn’t censorship in any way. 
No. 
EGS Posts being downvoted is because people are being frustrated about everything they do. Downvoting freebees is just a way of prostest because there is no other way to protest. They is no other way for the community to show them that they believe that Epic is doing wrong. 
Pcgaming was a place where discussion was allowed no matter what. Now this is over obviously."

pcgaming,fgvd7bs,t1_fgvcqnw,1581145316.0,"Yea but how? If our only ways to protest are shut down from every side, what is left to do? 

The problem is that we are too few. How old are people who really think about this stuff? 25 and above maybe? We aren't the main audience of the gaming industry anymore. The kids are. And they don't care if Epic has their private data, they don't care about this stuff. But they are the masses. The industry doesn't care about people like us who would rather buy indy games than the next iteration of Call of Duty. Look, Metro Exodus is doing well. Tons of copies sold. Despite the shady shit they pulled off."

pcgaming,fgvcf9o,t1_fgvbnln,1581144425.0,"It is... 
The whole gaming industry is ridiculous. What is our only way to protest? Right, voting with our money? How to make sure that bad publisher or developer practices are noticed? By a bad review. So let’s just forbid that practice and call it review bombing. 

Ok, maybe that’s bad. So let’s meet on a forum and let’s discuss bad publisher practices. Nooooo that’s forbidden because that’s brigading. 

It’s so obvious that the gaming press is sucking blizzards and EAs and Ubis thing but now we are even censored on Reddit. Nice..."

KidsAreFuckingStupid,fgp1kc9,t3_ezrh4n,1580994236.0,"I’m elementary school teacher... this happens a lot and most of the time it isn’t racist. Children of this age usually aren’t aware that words can hurt, too, except swear words and they use it in a very blunt way. 
Most of the time they don’t care about others a lot. They are still very egocentric and are in the middle of a long ongoing socializing process...

There are racist comments, too, but those are made by completely brainwashed kids that wouldn’t use it by making a comment like this. 
So I would say it’s sweet. 
Nonetheless, no matter how it was meant it’s important to talk to them about it."

One day I realized he was chasing the cat just when the cat tried to leave the property. 

As you wrote in a another comment she is part German Shepherd so your dog has probably the same instinct: to keep the herd together. 

Knowing this can help you. I tried to produce occasions where the cat was leaving the property and ran in the woods and I was beside my dog. 

This was a process that went about 2 months but then he wasn’t chasing anymore. He accepted at some point that the cat was free to go. :-)"
