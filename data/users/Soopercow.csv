Both of the assassins you mention have great setup for a big ult so it's important your team has some you should probably have a magical ADC though so it should be easy. 

They also have a very annoying hard CC, although Ne Zha's is hugely easier to use. Getting sashed as you charge in on a definite kill is very frustrating. Making sure you have your runes charged as Fenrir to leap stun is really difficult. 

I can't think of any others decent Support Assassins but there are a few warriors you can play in the same way.

BTW I played a game recently as NeZha support with a Hel ADC. 15 minutes in the opposite ADC whispers me ""I hate you so much"" which is of course the ultimate compliment."
