It will end up in the supreme court, which has already been carefully stacked, and trump will be declared the winner due to mysteriously produced and questionable evidence that they already have ready and waiting."

Also, be careful with the p modifier (in :nnnp), as it works by setting a ""also capture this"" flag in peer connflows. Those flags are not cleared when tcpdump exits, so they'll show up in subsequent tcpdumps if the flow is still alive at that time.

-p (in -nnpi 0.0) is the tcpdump switch to not set the interface to promiscuous mode, and given that the interface here is 0.0, that's probably not going to do anything. Perhaps you confused that with the :p interface modifier ?"
f5networks,fc547wz,t1_fc3vknw,1577442308.0,"That's not quite correct - 0.0 gives you ""anything that passes through tmm"", and won't capture, for example lldp packets, which you can only see if you capture on the physical interface.

Specifying a physical interface instructs the broadcom chip to replicate packets from the port you specify to the ethernet connection to tmm (Not quite correct, but... close enough), which then processes the packet and sends it out the tmm vnic to linux where tcpdump sees it. The 200 pps limitation comes from not wanting to swamp tmm with packets or congest the ethernet link to it."
