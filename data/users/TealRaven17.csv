facingtheirparenting,ffmtuad,t1_ffmiuq3,1580058817.0,">If the girl in the OP never went from shorts to short shorts why would this video ever occur? 

Because other people start to sexualize them. 

 >If short shorts were worn by toddlers, 8 year olds, 10 year olds, 16 year olds as you claim, why is this even a debate or point of conversation?

See my previous answer. 

>Correct! I have proven that point over and over.

You cannot begin to know what is in a girls mind when she chooses the clothes she wears. Are you of the believe that women are “asking for it” when wearing certain clothes?

>Purpose built athletic/swimwear is wholly different from every day shorts.

These are purpose built, for comfort and staying cool, and style. 


>Where a 7 year old never has a passing thought of how long her legs look, a 13-16 year old typically does, and will gravitate toward this style. 

Again, you are proposing to know what young girls are thinking? Have you ever been a 7 year old girl? Obviously not if you think they don’t think about their appearance. Also, I have never chosen shorts to make my legs look long lol. Not saying that some women don’t, but you put a lot of stock in thinking that all women think and do the same things."

facingtheirparenting,ffm8jaw,t1_ffm4qtu,1580050356.0,"I need to look up puberty? Your claim was sexual maturation, and that is a vastly different statement than puberty. Also, I didn’t start puberty until I was 15 (I know this is a little late), but I know what it means and looks like. I also am around 11 year old girls quite a bit because of my daughter, also because she has not always been 11 I have been around girls of all ages from birth to 11 years old because of her. I have an 18 year old sister as well so I saw her and all of her friends growing up. And from that experience, yes girls of ALL ages wear short shorts. Hell, I have bought shorts for my daughter since she was a baby and I can tell you that where they land on her thigh has not changed much since then. ALSO, I am a woman so I saw myself and all of my friends growing up and how the style has changed, but even then we wore the short shorts that were available to us. 

Like I said, you are sexualizing it, not the teenage girls. And when you say “sexually mature” we can all tell that what you mean is that they are trying to be sexual about it. What’s next, volleyball players are just wearing their very short shorts because they are “sexually mature”? Girls only wear bathing suits because they are “sexually mature”? A bathing suit, even a one piece, show way more than short shorts. Should girls wear fully covering clothes from now on?

I can also tell you that your (and the dad in this video) ideas on this are NOT shared at all by families of different cultures. I have met Dutch families that had a daughter that was 12 and wearing a bathing suit that would only have been worn by an adult woman in the US, and the shorts she put on over it were just as short, and their other daughter that was 7 wasn’t even wearing a top. Other Cultures are similar in this regard."
facingtheirparenting,ffm32q4,t1_fflf20n,1580047635.0,"My initial sentence in my response directly answered your question, explaining exactly what wearing short shorts has to do with. If you want me to be more clear because you don’t understand nuance, then No, it has NOTHING to do with sexual maturation. Also, who the hell thinks that 13 is sexual maturation? You obviously don’t know many 11 year olds either because my 11 year old and most of her little friends wear those kind of shorts."

facingtheirparenting,ffikjui,t1_fficgsc,1579976080.0,"Women’s choice to wear short shorts has everything to do with current style, comfort, weather, the fact that they like them, and how they feel in them. You are sexualizing it, not them. Maybe you are projecting because your post history suggests that you like “teen” porn. So you can go ahead and keep thinking that way, nothing I say here will change your mind. Just know that what women are in your mind has very little to do with what women are actually like."

Some guy rear ended a woman in a Jeep, then backed up and hit her again, and again, and again. Then got out and started screaming and yelling and ended up getting tackled and arrested by cops. Aaaaallll while my daughter and her school mates were literally right there walking across the road.

science,fepj9wx,t1_fep8ib9,1579321936.0,"I only recently found out (within the last couple months) that my mother smoked weed while she was pregnant with me. 

Now, I know my mom smokes and I don’t care. I want weed to be legal because it logically makes sense. I don’t smoke but it never bothered me, but finding this out just pissed me off. 

I mean, how hard is it to just NOT do something for that 9 months for the sake of your child. I only allowed myself one coke a week because of caffeine and sugar. Some might say I was being too cautious, and I understand that. My point is that if I can, at 19, make the decision to not drink sodas or eat lunch meet for 9 months how fucking hard is it to just NOT smoke weed.
