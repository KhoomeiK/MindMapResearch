This is what I'm trying to explain! The tendency is that this concept of ""race"" begins fade as your skintone no more will be enough to determine if you're asian or african (since there's light skin africans and darker skin asians) for instance"
AskReddit,ff7xtve,t1_ff7xka6,1579660923.0,"So theres 2 races
Dark skin
White
Did you know that not every dark skin person is from africa? Did you know that races merge with each other?
Did you know that humans arent prone to artificial selection to itenficy race traits like dogs are?"

AskReddit,ff7x31s,t1_ff7whnb,1579660415.0,">No race has a single homogeneous culture

This is exactly my point, i don't thing race labes should exist because there isnt a homogeneous race

>Middle- and upper-class black people exist too (assuming that all black people are poor is kinda sorta racial profiling). Look at the Obamas. Are they not black?

Yes, but i was talking about the exemple in exclusive of this person i knew, i didn't mean to make it seem like just because he was black he should identify with people that are poor and black, i said that he couldn't identify with the black people that he knew because he didnt know black people at all growing up. The fact that his family was healthier than me and my friends is just to illustrate that we had a different upbringing than his"

AskReddit,ff7r18e,t1_ff7qmd2,1579656266.0,"And before someone comes and tells me: well you're saying I can just tell people i'm asian even tho I'm not?
You can identify more with some aspects of the asian culture than with aspects of your own culture and that's ok but where i'm trying to get to is that do you really need to be labeled as a race, knowing that there isn't anyone in the world that is a ""pure breed"" of whatever race you can think of?
Still on that matter, do you really need to be labeled as men or woman? Wouldn't it be easier to people just respect love and live with people just by their personalities? 
Maybe i'm too idealistic but yeah I think you can pretty much be whatever you truly feel like if that's not literally putting lives in danger so yeah"
AskReddit,ff7qmd2,t3_es4eqv,1579655979.0,"I met a boy who was black and raised by white parents (adopted) and he wouldn't identify as black, even tho he knew he was, because he wasn't raised in a home with black people... He just wouldn't fit in the black community and couldn't relate to their struggles since his home was white and healthy and from a different perspective in life as the other black people he knew.
I guess you can identify as a different race because appart from minor physical differences, what really defines a race is the way the community of that race acts... If you're black or asian or white you are expected to act a certain way, just like if you're born male or female you're expected to act in a certain way...
Not to mention that race is a very old way to tell apart humans if you take into consideration that everyone is pretty much a mix and match of different races, so you can have brown skinned people that can be asian, african, or latin that's what i'm saying."
