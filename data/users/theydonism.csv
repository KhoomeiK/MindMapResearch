AskReddit,fdrsnka,t1_fdrs2gk,1578689086.0,"Toxic masculinity is a staunchly progressive term meaning the societal pressures that force men into acting in certain ways. Men are not perpetrators of it, they're victims to it. It's not at all the idea that men = bad."

AskReddit,fdrqzi1,t1_fdrnh3d,1578688320.0,Women aren't as socially pressured to be as prideful as men are. They're much quicker to do things like ask for help.

Whataboutism is a problem when someone is incapable of defending their party, person, self, etc. and instead just deflects the issue by saying other people do it. And even if you're right and democrats are hypocritical, it doesnt matter unless the discussion is directly comparative ie. ""This party is better bc x y z"""

Tinder,fd5iscf,t1_fd5clo6,1578178038.0,"1) People must give informed consent.

2) If you lie about a condition that they require for them to give consent, then they aren't giving informed consent.

3) Uninformed consent is not consent. Sex under above pretenses is therefore nonconsensual and therefore technically rape.

So just go through that list with your example. Would she have given consent if you didn't lie about being single? If not, then logic dictates that it's considered rape."

AskReddit,fcvuz9r,t1_fcv4bvp,1578010701.0,"Not true. At least when I think of a ""gifted child"", I'm thinking of that freak kid who never showed up to class but aced all of his tests and bigger projects (which in college usually amounts to about 90% of the class anyway), or this guy in high school who played video games all day but somehow scored 5s on all 7 of his AP tests that he took in 1 year"
fightporn,fcvrflu,t1_fcvq80o,1578008411.0,Yeah I got you bc you're just wrong on a basic level that isn't able to be argued because it's like trying to argue against logic. Respect = people like you = fans = money = pay the bills. There is nothing to be argued there.

Physical books take up physical space, can degrade, can be lost, etc.

People can easily upload or download the pics if they wish

Digital items don't need to be transported from household to household

You can always make a physical book out of digital photos if you really want

Most importantly, you're assuming your child WON'T cherish a giant archive of pics for the rest of their life. The memories is what really matters, not the actual presentation."
