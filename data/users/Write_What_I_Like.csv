Either your boss will forever look at you differently, or begin to blame anything they don't like about your work on bipolar, or tell your coworkers, or find a way to fire you because the bipolar scares them, or all of the above. The reason to never use it as an excuse (even if it is the true cause) is that with very, very rare exceptions, the outcome is always worse than the original flaw.

To be sure, I never realize I'm hypo or mixed until I'm well into it, and then I look back with perspective and realize, well shit, I am/was. But that's not to say I have no capacity to know what's going on. 

I have my own cheat sheet of things that I'm always watching for - signs that I'm going in one direction or the other. And I know for sure what those red flags mean because I've come across them so many times - which in turn puts me on notice to really watch what I'm saying, doing and thinking. Rather than relying on, can I trust reality? Instead I rely on more objective data - how much did I sleep, how much am I eating, how often am I fucking, how much money am I spending, and much more. When you track those things, you have real-world stuff that can only be read one way. Either you sleep 8 hrs or you don't; either you ate all day or didn't eat for several. 

There's some great threads on this sub to the effect of, ""how do you know when you're manic?"" And there's really excellent things people have come up with to use as their warning signs. Mood tracking also gives you more data. That I think begins to break the loop. It's not that you ""cannot"" know things, you just need to use different data."
bipolar,ffg3nzo,t3_etfqrb,1579897760.0,"> nice experiencing full blown 

I get that, totally. 

One thing you might consider is that ""bipolar"" is just a word that loosely describes how a human brain might operate. There's lots of ways a brain can work - ours has a name. Meh, OK. So my brain is bipolar, it can't independently regulate my moods. Meh, I'm still me. I'm not defined by the term but instead the term describes how my brain works. That's an important difference. 

There's another thing as well and that is the risk of uniting your identity with how your brain works. Subtle but important. I am ""bipolar"" in as much as that describes my brain, but I am not the walking embodiment of bipolar, even as that in part describes who I am. But it's the same as noting your hair color, your height, your allergies, your shoe size. These are all component parts of you. So no matter what, your identity is necessarily a multifaceted thing. 

I'd say, as you're wrestling with these philosophical thoughts, and we all face that, strive to always keep it in perspective. As many of us like to say, you are greater than your ups and downs. You are not defined by your ups and downs. You just have ups and downs, and that's called bipolar."
bipolar,ffg2rno,t3_etfspi,1579897210.0,"Very interesting topic. I came up at a time when psychiatric orthodoxy was that anyone under 18 could NOT be bipolar - as in, you don't even need to screen for it or consider it because until the person is an adult, there is no chance bipolar could be there. This is of course wrong, and the medical field has changed a lot over the last 20 years. However, it swung so far in the other direction that a bipolar diagnosis was being handed out like antipsychotics in a ward. Oh, you're 12, don't feel good and it comes in waves? Bipolar! And on with the meds. 

This I disagree with, big time, in part because the meds we take are designed to treat full blown bipolar in adult brains. We do not have good science to know, for example, what a regular dose of antipyschs does to an adolescent brain that is changing with hormones and all that youth brings. There probably are medicines that either exist or could exist that specifically prohibit bipolar from becoming Bipolar capital B. 

The first experience of true mania generally does come around 18, and it's because that's typically when there is enormous change in someone's life - a kid moves away from home, has to earn their own income, maybe goes to school, starts drinking or sleeping less just because they can, and ta-da, mania. 

My view is that we should always screen for bipolar, knowing that there's a chance it could ""break out"" at some point, but that doesn't mean we should use the same drugs on kids that we do on adults whose disorder is full blown. Not sure that's anyone's fault, because again, this is all still pretty new and there are not a lot of drugs that effectively treat bipolar. 

Looking to my past, I wish 1. my childhood psych had not had his head so far up his ass he didn't see the evidently bipolar child sitting in front of him, 2. and because it was up his ass he kept prescribing ssris which my parents forced me to take and thus it was mental torture, and 3. someone had just told me, look, you're probably bipolar, but we don't know for sure but probably, and that means we're going to focus on all this preventative stuff so that you don't end up in the hospital when mania blindsides you."
bipolar,ffg11d6,t3_etf6yd,1579896137.0,"It takes very little for me to lose my shit, but it's not just a general propensity for getting pissed or irritated. More like, if I'm trying to do X and Y happens, I get upset. Let me offer a recent example.

Someone dumped their dead xmas tree in the street in front of my house. OK, whatever, call the city to pick up someone's bullshit. I don't care, it's in the gutter. But I've got this asshole neighbor who antagonizes the shit out of me, and I woke up one morning to find this highly combustible piece of trash dragged from the gutter and dumped in my side yard, as if it were mine. I'm positive he did that, and I've been seriously pissed for a couple days. Saw him early today and said nothing because my hands started shaking from rage-induced adrenaline. 

What that is, I think, is I'm trying to do my thing and this fucker is just messing with me. It's that human conflict, particularly when I'm in the right and cannot believe someone is so wrong, that I have no patience and go from ""hey neighbor"" to ""I will make you eat this fucking tree!"" in about 3 seconds. And this has nothing to do with where I am in my cycle. It's more about control - I want everything to be easy sailing and zero conflict and when even a whisper of conflict is introduced, I go on the defensive, hard.

But if people don't fuck with me, I'm very chill. I think perhaps it's the inability to have people just *know* what's right and wrong and when that doesn't happen, it flips a switch. I've been told I'm hard to live with for that reason, and I think that's probably true."

bipolar,ffd3vv3,t3_esyqmk,1579812914.0,"They should put 25 mg of seroquel in the water for the good of society. 50 mg is a low dose; it'll make you very sleepy, maybe hungry, but it's mild. If 50 doesn't do anything, 100 is the logical step, which is still not a huge dose. The minimal effective dosage rate (I think) is 300 mg - that's what the pharmaceutical companies test it at. If you take 300 mg, you get xyz. Anything less, no comment. So 100 is low. You really can't go wrong on this. Try it. Seroquel has been extremely helpful for me, and all the serious side effects evaporated after a few months (e.g., excessive tiredness, god-level munchies). I say go for it, if it's what the doctor thinks is a good move. I think it's a good move, because again, they should put this shit in the water."

bipolar,ffd132n,t3_esxv47,1579811331.0,"Looking back, I've always been as I am, but the bipolar has changed. As a kid, the depression was brutal, but the mania wasn't really mania. It was just a lot of uncontrolled energy that came from nowhere, manifested in breaking rules, screaming a lot, fuck everyone I'm going to smash things. 

But then the day came. It's kind of an interesting story. I'll share. I was 18 in a foreign city, and I hadn't slept for more than 3 hours a night for at least a couple months. I woke up one morning, same as any morning, nothing was different. Walked to a cafe for coffee, starting to feel kind of ""weird,"" something I'd never felt. And it became more and more and more until an hour later I was a Saturn 5 rocket sitting at a cafe. My whole world shattered. True mania. Nearly died sprinting across 6 lanes of traffic to shout at the angel statue on the corner, a terrifying experience, screaming like a madman at carved stone while people headed to work. I rapid cycled for a week and ended up in the hospital. 

I guess it was a slow burn. In retrospect, I can see it escalating over the years and it finally blew. But the change over from ""never seen mania"" to ""absolute mania,"" about an hour. That was the first time."

Then there's stuff I only ever say to people who are like me, because they know what I'm talking about without a 10-day lecture on bipolar. This is the group where I share the true darkness. 

The next tier is people who I know and love who were with me through the worst - my brothers and my dad. I'll tell them where I am and how I'm feeling, but I don't really go into the hardcore details that they just won't understand. Example, I would not say, ""I can't shut off this fucking record in my head that tells me to hate myself and die."" They don't know wtf that means, though I'm betting you do. 

After that, there's the small tier who know I'm bipolar. I never give them details other than, ""kind of rough day"" or ""let me catch up with you next week, I need to be alone."" And they get it. 

The bottom tier is the rest of the world, and they get zero thoughts. They get the mirage I construct for them to see me as I want them to.

I guess the cutoff is anyone who has stood by your side through the worst, you can share with them because they've already seen it. Below that, nah, and they'll never understand anyway. But everyone here is just like you so lay it on us. I'm sure I'll get it, and my record isn't currently playing so I've got room for yours, if you want to share."

After exactly six months, all the still-living prisoners who had been deported to Auschwitz in September 1943 were told that they would be transferred to the „Heydebreck labour camp.“ Instead of going to this fictitious camp, however, the lorries of prisoners headed to the Auschwitz gas chambers, where on the night of 8 March they were murdered without selection.

I'd bet you dollars to donuts 75% of the people on this sub are the same in one case or perhaps both. The lack of ability to control your moods has nothing to do with a lack of ability in other places. If you lost sight in one eye suddenly, would that impact your intelligence? Of course not, totally unrelated. Such is bipolar. And more than that, most of the bipolar people I've met are exceptional. They are artists, thinkers and doers of the first class. That's not a ""there-there bipolar, you're doing super good"" - that's a real, I know professional artists, professional writers, professional managers and CEOS. We own shit, to a surprising degree. So kick that aside - your inherent abilities are real and have nothing to do with your moods. 

No one believes you and you write that you feel totally alone. Those things are related, for sure. The biggest fuck you of the people around us is in them saying, ""nah, you're not bipolar, look how great you are"" next to ""what are you so worked up about/feeling bad about? Go have a beer and chill."" What a contradiction! When you're great, you're great. When you're not, ""why aren't you great right now? I don't get it. Bipolar wha?"" You're not alone, but people who are not like us really can never get it. They will never understand, and that's not their fault. In fact, I'd rather most people did not understand because it is so horrible sometimes. The deep pain is unlike what I think most people can fathom. I feel alone a lot too, and a big part of that is no one can understand my reality. So when they tell me, ""hey, you don't seem like you're 100% and you should quit not being 100%,"" my reply is, ""yeah I'll work on that, thanks for the input."" Translation: fuck em. They have no idea. You do as you will. 

Looking ahead - what to expect and hopes for the future. You have every hope of a brilliant future. Bipolars do great things; there's more of us than people know because we're so demonized that we stay quiet. So we go unseen, except for those of us who are fighting through their worst moments and it's obvious. Plenty of chances to see someone in a courtroom saying guilty because neurotypicals film that shit; very rare to see someone in a boardroom saying, I'm bipolar and you all work for me. That doesn't mean there isn't a bipolar person at the head of the table. I can think of three people just sitting here who are successful business leaders who earn a good income, contribute to the world in big ways and enjoy comfortable lives. Actually four people, because me too. All that's to say, bipolar doesn't set limits. It sets obstacles. Hurdle the obstacles, the future is yours my family.

If she herself is really bothered by the nodding off, you have good options and that's worth taking to the doctor, at her instruction. Tweaking meds to improve the benefits and minimize the drawbacks is normal. If she's really troubled by this, encourage her to get with the dr and start the tweaking process. Importantly, if she is not troubled by this but just kind of confused about the whole thing, leave it alone. As soon as one of us starts taking meds, everyone else is in the passenger seat.

If you can't sleep, if sleep isn't a factor or if you get sleep and everything is the same, I really encourage you to see the doctor. There are tools available. I use these tools every day because if I don't, I end up not sleeping and also *knowing* things in my *core* that are simply not real.

My brother, you just did. Let me throw out a recent story that will seem silly at first but stick with me and indulge the analogy. 

I hadn't been to the dentist is more than a decade. My teeth were fuuuucked. Nicotine stains like I had scurvy, cavities, I thought, ""they're going to have to pull out all of my teeth."" And so I kept avoiding and avoiding, and the longer I avoided, the more I wanted to avoid. 

Finally one day I took a deep breath and said, fuck it, I'm going to the dentist, assuming I was about to step into unbearable pain, infinite costs, and the deep shame of having my teeth ripped out.

But you know, I didn't need any extractions. My cavities were fixable. And those nicotine stains they blasted off with a simple water jet. It cost some money, sure, but not what I thought it would. And on the back side of it, WOW! Health is an amazing thing when you've lacked it and then have it. 

The difference with bipolar of course is that it is not something you address in three sessions with a few grand. It's a life-long fight. But as a guy with decent teeth and on the right side of bipolar treatment and living, the feeling of health is really good and for everyone around you.

So it is a sleep tool for me. That said, if I took 25 mg right now, it wouldn't touch me. I'd be basically the same because my body has acclimated. And even at my dose, it doesn't always work. For example, if I'm ever on an overnight flight, I'll of course take my meds but I don't sleep. I feel tired but it never transitions. 

Before rejecting the idea of taking sq during the day, I'd suggest giving your body time (measured in months) to adjust to the meds and then see how you do. I see in the thread lots of people get sleepy from it, and I totally do as well. But if it's helpful to take a small dose during the day and a bigger one at night, you can probably adapt to that.

Caveat: We are all really different in how the drugs affect us. If you gave me any mg of zyprexa at any time given any acclimation, I'm still going to sleep for 24 hrs. Zyprexa puts me out every time. Risperdol did very little for sleep and just fucked up motor function. So what sq does to me may not be what it does for you. Even with that, give it some time and see if you settle in. You might and then a daytime dose makes sense if you and your dr think it helps."
bipolar,ff4102o,t3_ergl3c,1579553190.0,"The current science is that bipolar is a mix of genetic predisposition and environmental factors, which are not really known.

If you mean, can your environment make you cycle, well 100% yes, that's how it works. But can you encounter and be forever bipolar because of day to day stuff, no I think not. Either the genes are there or they are not, and if they are there, bipolar did not start because of dirty streets and rude people. It started way, way before that.
