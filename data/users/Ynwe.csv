Haven't found the commander in those colours that is mine) so I played mostly Selesnya in MTGA pre Thrones of Eldraine. It was ok, but running into the same decks over and over (no matter if you play Bo1 or Bo3) gets boring after some time. Almost never met another Selesnya player..."
MagicArena,fftj99u,t1_fftgzh3,1580222002.0,"Thanks, good to konw. My EDH irl group is pretty regular, but sometimes (like right now) we have 2 week droughts, which sucks when you want to see if your new commander (Tuvasa) is doing fine or if your first commander (Massacre Girl) is still doing fine now that you changed the deck a bit.

Trying out some brawl commanders that I wouldn't build in EDH sounds like fun time! Any commanders you can recommend?"

I still remain subbed here because I still am interested in its development even if I stopped playing over half a year ago. This was just a thread where I could offer an alternative that imo is a better product than MTGA in the form of LoR. 

Also to do a bit of propaganda and spread the love of EDH, never had so much fun with magic (even though I hated this format at first, was tough getting into it at first). I love magic, but I just 1) never felt that MTGA captured any of the magic (har har) that the card game irl offerd to me 2) I genuinely believe MTGA to be a bad product compared to multiple alternatives."

MagicArena,fftfb7k,t3_ev59nx,1580218899.0,"I quit MTGA because the game is just so freaking greedy. Also standard is just not that fun when everyone is netdecking even in lower ranked levels.

Now I play EDH with friends IRL and legends of runeterra on pc. EDH is imo the best format in magic anyway since it brings magic back to the kitchen table and adds the nice extra dimension of the political side. and LoR has an awesome system where the devs are trying to finance the game via cosmetics. You can't even buy card packs.

I understand your frustration, brawl sounds like it could have been a hell of a lot of fun on MTGA... Precon decks were pretty awesome... But 10k gold..."

She was my first commander ( doesn't mean much since I have only two but still!) and I think she is quite strong. Board wipe in the command zone is awesome. Often times I don't cast her that much, use her either politically or when I can get a ton of damage of via things like [[blood artist]].

You can run some pretty obscure token generators, and can just sit there and wipe the board when you wish. Nothing besides blinking or phasing works against her and it is really easy to even wipe extremely strong creatures. A [[thrilling encore]] after is usually GG. 

So a political commander that allows for quite a few fun win conditions."

CompetitiveEDH,ffciupa,t3_esw1yd,1579800398.0,"I am a relatively new player to edh, returned to magic around a year ago. Since then I have become a commander only player since this format represents everything that I want from magic. The flash saga has for the first time shown me the competitive side of edh and it is rather interesting! Especially the decks and meta. However I would never play it as it is just what standard is for me, netdecking.

Anyway I can see why you guys want flash banned and even think it wouldn't be that bad. Edh wouldn't notice it and cedh would be happy.

However outside of the more articulate people, the response from the cedh community has left a sour taste. For some reason the suggestion that cedh and edh should be separated (something I disagree with) and a separate ban list would cause a bunch of weaker cedh deck move away from cedh and into edh. Basically people where threatening to pub stomp.

Why? It basically confirms that these two formats are different since many play commander to get magic bacon the kitchen table style and away from the stereotypical magic player who is socially inept and just wants fuck over others. After I saw a few of those comments I lost any interest in your case really. Really was disappointed in the behavior. I do hope for you that the card gets banned, but it killed any possible interest on cedh for me."
