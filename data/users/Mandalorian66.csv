AskReddit,fdz3ku3,t1_fdz0ams,1578786327.0,Also I just want to say I meant no offense by this comment just throwing my thoughts out there
AskReddit,fdz0ams,t1_fdyegtd,1578785419.0,Ok I get where yer coming from when people like live in small apartments and keep animals that are highly energetic and I agree that that’s unethical but not all dogs/cats are that crazy like I have a Great Dane and basically he just wants to sit in front of a fire all day when we have a huge yard to run in I mean it’s not like he doesn’t ever run but he prefers his bed. And I assure you we take VERY good care of him. And not all dogs are pack dogs!  We have a dog jazz and before we got more dogs she was SO friendly and we thought she needed a playmate. Turns out they hate each other and Jazz just likes her people. And keep in mind some of these animals were specifically bred and trained and evolved to be living like this. I think that the thing is not everybody does their research before getting a pet be it rabbit bird cat or dog.
