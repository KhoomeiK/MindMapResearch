Observe how unnecessary it is to judge everything, especially yourself. Observe how better it feels to just be aware. Stay in observer mode for as long as you can."
socialanxiety,fdnb7qy,t3_ekzf2v,1578582010.0,"There's a whole range of acceptable behavior. The perfect response is a myth. And if people don't like when you respond honestly, openly and without malice, they will either learn that's your personality so get over it, or they're the wrong people to have in your life. Bonus 3rd option: they are grossly immature and it would behoove you to realize that."
socialanxiety,fdn9y81,t1_fd7i2ev,1578581159.0,"This is it right here. Your subconscious observed how you were treated during childhood. Those beliefs it wrote down: that you're a screw up, that someone's judgmental gaze is always on you, that you'll say something that will make someone mad. Those beliefs are still with you. And they were ruining my life. I read a book recently that explains this really well: Addicted to the Monkey Mind. I really can't recommend it enough."
socialanxiety,fdn94v5,t1_fdda3px,1578580581.0,"I highly, highly recommend Addicted to the Monkey Mind. It sounds like your brain is using guilt and shame to motivate you.  Maybe that was needed in childhood, but no longer. Mistakes are normal and unavoidable. That book shows you the path to convincing yourself of that. I just finished it. I'm not fully out of the woods yet, but I'm making progress."

It's an uphill battle."
