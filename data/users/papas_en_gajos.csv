AskReddit,fdimyv6,t3_eld4mi,1578446513.0,"I really didnt wanted to have classes that day because i forgot to do my homework.

So I started asking the teacher  a lot of dumb questions, just like: ""how can birds get pregnan?t"" ""how does people working at night shifts get to sleep?"" and all Sort of stuff. Not so long after that my friends started to join into the plot and after that It was all the class who started to ask  (even the teacher was having a good time) this ended up with me asking ""if lawyers dont have soul, what does they have inside their body?"" No one say a thing and It looked like the joke was ruined, so I added ""besides their boyfriends obioulsy"" All the class started to break their asses into laugher (14 years old class, It was the pinacle of comedy)
The principal was passing around the classes and Sort of listened to us... When he entered the classroom he started to rant and told us he was going to put a class report and give each of us a call to our parents.

I told him It was my fault and resposability and he took me to His office.
His secretary  laughed when she hear my pun as she wrote the report.
The principal called my dad, he laughed when I told him the joke.

I didnt had to deliver my homework
Would do it again 10/10"
