WitchesVsPatriarchy,ffhaxn3,t1_ffep1ck,1579928327.0,"It's hard to notice things like that in your native language. 

In (one of) my native language (kreol morisien), the only notable gendered negativity is mostly in swear words. All of them? Involves someone's mum lol

Most of these changes are rather insidious and take a long time. Linguistic study is required! xD"
mauritius,ffh1fzh,t1_fffzic9,1579920549.0,"You have to realise that Mru does have a relatively competent privatised media, so news censorship isn't exactly... easy.

As for ""roads collapsing"", jesus, it's not a zombie movie. In 2014, there were landslides which led to Ring Road collapsing. The risk was noted by the authorities and security measures were put in place accordingly, no one has been injured due to that.

I don't want to say anything about your aunt, mate but honestly, people like to bitch about everything, especially to relatives abroad. It's just something that's very Mauritian. 'The country is going down the drain, terrible, awful, etc' That's a random afternoon's conversation.

At the end of that conversation, life goes on fine. I mean, it is a country with 92+% house ownership, free edu, an awesome scholarship system, free health care, a livable pension scheme, a functional social welfare program- it's easy to complain about the little things but it takes not having them accessible when you move somewhere else for a few years to *know* how much they actually matter.

You should do yourself the favor of checking out the news, not just Defimedia but private publications (they can be anti-govt, so you can form your own narrative through commonsense and a varied reading list) and radio stations. Do this for everything that's relevant to you in life, it's not very dignified to accept others' opinions at face value and repeat them.

Even I, as a high schooler, had cringed at everything 'Mauritian' because I 'needed to get away', the grass seemed greener on the other side. Tell you what, 5 years after school, it's not xD 

The only legitimate complaint I have about Mauritius is that it hasn't reached high income status, but it's getting there, slowly."
mauritius,fffkvyt,t1_ffep84m,1579886166.0,">Mauritius has a reputation for not doing shit properly.

Sure, mate. I hope you aren't Mauritian because that's kind of a shit generalisation to make.

>they are destroying people's homes

That was subject to controversy, but mostly people have been adequately compensated if they owned the land/property outright.

The louder cases were people whose houses were on govt land, they were still financially compensated for something that had never, in the legal sense of the word, been theirs.

Generally, it's okay. They have been playing it safe with the speed. So far, the only negative thing was that person who decided to cross the road despite the red light because 'li ti assez loin' (she thought it was far enough), well, it wasn't and had a bit of a rough stop.

Still, no tragedies, Mauritius seems to have done an okay job huh"
WitchesVsPatriarchy,fff4j8o,t1_fff42sc,1579875507.0,"On one of the other threads, someone explained how even then, becoming a spinster was really the only way to make a living for these women, hardly empowering given that they still tended to be poor and marginalized.

Thing is, in today's world, we can be raking in the cash, unmarried at 45 and instead of a spinster, we'll be the crazy cat lady.

I also remember that the one (among few) exception to this phenomenon is the word 'pretty', apparently it had connotations of prostitution before and now, it means beautiful.

It's a bit like policy making, you have an issue, say traffic congestion, that needs to be addressed. The way you look at it, what numbers you decide are relevant change the policy implemented because is it people buying too many cars? Public transport sucks? Roads are subpar? A whole region/country changes because perspective, convenience etc
