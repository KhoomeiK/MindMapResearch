There was plenty enough peer pressure already. As far as photos go, I have thousands of them and I only want look at a few every now and then. Most are not worth saving. And I don't want to stand there while my friends scroll endlessly on their phones looking for a photo that I don't really care if I see or not. I have memories, and some photos saved to my laptop to jar my memory, and that's plenty. I agree that the people who have their heads in their phones all the time are the ones that are missing out on experiences!

You'll probably keep drinking which will only make things worse. You get more stupid and obnoxious and out of control. Then you might need to throw up, and you might throw up on yourself. You might not know what else you did or how you made it home, you might pass out, and you'll have a headache and feel sick the next morning.
