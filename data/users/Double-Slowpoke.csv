NFL_Draft,feth1of,t3_eqkbtf,1579375374.0,"I believe the Panthers will sit at 7 and draft Tua if he falls, but the plan will be to take BPA between Okuda, Andrew Thomas, Derrick Brown, or Simmons (now that LB is an issue).

I’d love to get Burrow but the more I think about it, we don’t have the ammo to move up from 7 to 1 unless Cincy covets Cam Newton.  With Newton having surgery in December, there is no guarantee he will be healthy enough to evaluate by draft time.

Also I only think Burrow and Young at 1-2 are set in stone.  Okuda at 3 seems like a good fit, but I think either Detroit or NYG trade back as someone will try to jump ahead of Miami to take Tua.  Miami might even trade up to secure him."

I don’t think it is likely.  Cam’s trade value is iffy because he waited until December to have surgery, so no one knows how healthy his foot or shoulder really are.  Moving from 7th to 1st would take a lot of extra picks, and there is no indication that the Bengals want to move back.  If they thought Tua or Herbert were better prospects, 7th is too far to get them.

It could still happen depending on what value Cincy would assign to Cam, but I bet it would take another first rounder in 2021 and perhaps multiple mid-round picks."

panthers,feikxyc,t3_ep9wvi,1579140941.0,"You guys are insane.  A rebuild means a rookie QB.

We still think DJ Moore, Curtis Samuel, and CMC are an elite, young group of playmakers, and we are cautiously optimistic about Ian Thomas.  We don’t need to blow this up, we just need a great QB to get them the ball.  

If you’re worried about cap, I don’t think CMC is the type of back you worry about paying.  Even if he gets worn down he would still provide value as a third down back and slot receiver.  The only worry is injury, but you roll that dice on a lot of positions."

panthers,feds7l5,t3_eomrga,1579018766.0,"Every year is different.  This year the 7th pick will likely be a choice of Andrew Thomas, Derrick Brown, or Justin Herbert.  Maybe Tua if teams are scared of his medical report.

Gonna depend on how our team feels about those guys, and whether other teams really covet them enough to move up.

Not everyone can easily trade back.  Right now, Detroit and New York are in the prime trade-back spots for teams that want a QB.  We are in a fringe spot for trading back (Miami and LA Chargers pick ahead of us so most teams want to get ahead of them if they’re targeting QB).  We might be in a good position if WRs go early and a better prospect falls to us.  Say Jeudy or CeeDee Lamb go in the top 6, causing someone like Okudah or Tua to fall to us...

But just to say that smart teams trade back is only one component of it.  You need teams willing to trade up to OUR PICK too, and right now (at least before the combine and workouts), I think we do not have a coveted pick."

Every time I watch him, it seems like he is constantly moving around in the pocket to buy time or escape from pressure, but unlike some QBs who only step up or roll out away from pressure, Watson seems to try to juke pass rushers while staying in the pocket.

To be short, the elementary particles that make up matter have intrinsic properties that cause them to interact with each other.  They interact through the fundamental forces, the weak and strong nuclear interactions that govern tiny tiny quantum physics, and the electromagnetic and gravity interactions that govern larger objects.  These interactions yield increasingly more complex particles, from the quarks to come together to form protons and neutrons, to the those that come together with electrons to form atoms, and from atoms that come together to form molecules, which come together to form increasingly more complex molecules.  Each of those larger particles have intrinsic properties due to the way their component particles are arranged.

Of course if he doesn’t like that he isn’t going to believe the rest of it either, because if you go further back we descended from rodent-like early mammals and before that, fish-like creatures."

Also you shouldn’t try to have different rules for different religions because you like some better than others.  That’s a hell of a slippery slope."
atheism,fc7fjlt,t3_eglmaj,1577505906.0,"The real worry is that in three years Trump has appointed 1/3 of all sitting federal judges and 2 SCOTUS justices, and they all have lifetime appointments.  

Due to Mitch stonewalling Obama appointees and leaving Trump with an excess of openings to fill, the Republicans have pushed the Judicial Branch to the far right for at least an entire generation.

Those judges are overwhelmingly conservative and many of them have records of anti-LGBTQ rulings.  The fear is that these people, who are mostly unaccountable to the law (judges are almost never impeached), will let their religion guide their rulings or use it to justify their oppression."
atheism,fc608zd,t3_ege969,1577469440.0,"The concept of War on Christmas is a ploy to appeal to conservative viewers by creating a false narrative that liberals want to remove religion from all institutions.  War on Christmas is an extension of that.  It’s all part of the tribalism around American politics.  Liberals do want a secular state because not all Americans are Christian, but it rarely extends so far as Liberals hating Christmas.

edit: winning the war would probably look a lot like what it currently does.  Christmas isn’t exactly celebrated like a religious holiday.  It has more pagan aspects nowadays than Christian."
