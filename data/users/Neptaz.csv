But the downside from her, which is why i never been able to play her right, is she's too paper, too fragile and her range didn't that high compared to other marksman. I always salute someone who can play her and stomping people with her."

heroesevolved,fdcacc2,t3_eklanm,1578270256.0,"HE right now have the lowest player base ever. And since it's already going on for 1 year even almost 2 year (13 season of rank) it's hard to find a legit low elo player, so that's why you get to match with bots until you hit the rank where there are a legit people. I don't know what the dev should do about this, and i think most of HE player base ranks between diamond and electrum with diamond being the most. Sure you get match up with people when you hit silver 3 since it's closer to gold, and there's definitely a decent amount of people ranked gold. But i think most of it probably a smurf account and only a few that a real gold player. My advice for you are, play normal game as much as possible, learn every heroes available there, learn their kit, learn how to counter every hero, learn how to set up vision and ganks, learn how to prioritize objective, etc. It's alright you don't have to rank right away, because imo learning the game itself it's more important before you play rank. I myself when first play this game (since season 2) have played so much normal games, even my normal games number higher than my ranked games number. It sits almost 2 k games on normal, and only 500 ish ranked game. But it's makes me hit palladium II rank as my highest rank ever in season 3 until season 5. Right now i barely even hit palladium, only get electrum 3. So that's my advice. Play normal games as much as possible, learn the gameplay itself, master it, then you can play rank."
