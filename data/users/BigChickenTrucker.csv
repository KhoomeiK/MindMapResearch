The electoral college was created because the founders didn't trust the lay person to make decisions on who should be president. Some of them wanted the congress to elect the president. Others wanted only qualified citizens to be allowed to vote.

The compromise was to allow citizens a proxy vote. They would elect the electors who then could talk about it and decide if they wanted the vote to stand or elect someone else.

In short: The founding fathers think you are stupid, and that's why the electoral college exists. Since then, states have passed laws that bind electors to vote for the state's winner. But that is state by state. Not all states use winner take all.

Further, we are getting closer every day to triggering the interstate compact wherein enough states to swing an election will always award their electoral votes to the winning national vote getting candidate. Which is as it should be. We do not live in anywhere near the same society as the founding fathers, and we should not give a fuck what they thought."

We must see now that the evils of racism, economic exploitation and militarism are all tied together‚Ä¶ you can‚Äôt really get rid of one without getting rid of the others‚Ä¶ the whole structure of American life must be changed. America is a hypocritical nation and [we] must put [our] own house in order.‚Äù

>‚ÄúI am now convinced that the simplest approach will prove to be the most effective ‚Äì the solution to poverty is to abolish it directly by a now widely discussed matter: the guaranteed income‚Ä¶ The curse of poverty has no justification in our age. It is socially as cruel and blind as the practice of cannibalism at the dawn of civilization, when men ate each other because they had not yet learned to take food from the soil or to consume the abundant animal life around them. The time has come for us to civilize ourselves by the total, direct and immediate abolition of poverty.‚Äù"

interestingasfuck,fep0se5,t1_feolb0o,1579309589.0,">it lands either on land or the barge

Meaning it's all a function of burn time (and thus the height they are lifting the payload to and also he weight of the payload).

Lower orbits or lighter payloads would mean they can return to land. The barge is riskier and so therefore would be reserved only for when they can't return to land in a cost effective manner. The risk of losing the rocket on the barge has to be less than the cost of the extra fuel to turn the falcon 9 around."

Allow me to correct the record: The two side rockets, which are functionally identical to the falcon 9, turn around and come back.

The central core of the falcon heavy, which is a falcon 9 on steroids and has no name I can find, is the one that lands on the barge, for the reasons I mentioned above."
interestingasfuck,fent4ue,t1_fensq82,1579290400.0,"No, the heavy core always lands on a barge. It burns for longer and has way too much energy.

The small falcon 9s on the side actually flip 180 and head back to where they came from. For the heavy's central core it would take too much energy to send them back like that, so it just does a reentry burn and lands on a barge because it's more energy efficient and cost effective
