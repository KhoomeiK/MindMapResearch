CasualConversation,ff3phq6,t3_ercpdg,1579546054.0,Can I have a compliment?
bipolar,ff3p8iv,t3_erg25r,1579545897.0,I can tell when things are going south for me when I start making lists about the most trivial tasks. My brain is going so fast that I have to write stuff down just to give myself the illusion of control.
bipolar,ff3n1i5,t3_erfdg2,1579544551.0,This really got me. Made me cry.
AskReddit,ff3lxe7,t3_erdojr,1579543855.0,"As a barista with 15 years of experience I say this would not work. People tend to go for the shortest line possible regardless of what the line is for and tend to ask for whatever they please. They do not read signs, especially the morning crowd. They just want to get to work on time."
BorderlinePDisorder,fe2ltkl,t3_ennqmn,1578840177.0,"I recently lost my best friend in the same sort of way. 
I was recently in the hospital after a suicide attempt and we were talking on the phone. She said something really cruel and insensitive and I got REALLY angry. I had to behave myself in the hospital because upset causes upset so instead of flipping out I hung up on her.
She also has BPD. Once I got home a few days later and turned on my phone there were a slew of awful messages from her. The worst thing she said is that I was a ""cancer"". 
This breaks my heart. I also blocked her on every platform due to her malicious behaviour. 
Does she miss me as much as I miss her? I wonder that every day."
BorderlinePDisorder,fd5bmzf,t1_fd56000,1578175995.0,I'll talk!
BorderlinePDisorder,fd3a2ml,t3_ejtrvl,1578156231.0,"Emotionally, psychologically and physically abusive father. Mother who turned a blind eye. When I wouldn't cry when he beat me he would then beat my brother for whatever I did and make me watch his beating. This created a huge rift between my brother and I. 
Raped when I was 12 and have had abusive and narcissistic boyfriends ever since. 
I am convinced it was my childhood."
BorderlinePDisorder,fd37vah,t3_ejoi57,1578155583.0,I got fired on December 3rd. Tried contacting friends to talk. No one was available. So I took over 300 pills to overdose. I am 38. When is this going to stop?
bipolar,fbys8nv,t1_fby0q82,1577224943.0,This is really great advice. I am going to try it out
bipolar,fbr014c,t3_ee2z13,1577037521.0,"I had a full 300 day stretch until I bought an android phone (switched from apple). 
I usually do mine the next morning so I have had time to reflect on the whole day."
