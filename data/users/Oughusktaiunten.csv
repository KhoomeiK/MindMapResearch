Unless other countries also recognize Taiwan as sovereign as well, that can have ramifications for the international support the US would receive if China decided to go to war over it. And since China is a nuclear power, nobody wants to go to war with them, which is why they get away with having concentration camps.

I still don't understand why you're blaming them for it. It's literally a thing Apple did to their phones. They made them lock to the first US carrier of a SIM you put into it. Like, say you had T-Mobile, literally the exact same thing would have happened. The phone rep would probably also be just as confused because I doubt anyone told them that Apple's phones lock to carriers on their own, even if it's something they *should* know. Really this is something people should be freaking out to Apple about.

> but it's convenient enough of a bug for me to suspect that they haven't worked very hard on fixing it.

Again, Apple would have to fix it. Maybe they marked the wrong phone as part of the Flex program. Or maybe someone returned a Flex phone to an Apple store and they sold it to you or something. Your phone locked itself to the carrier. It's a feature Apple made. Your carrier can't lock your phone. It doesn't work like that.

The only part of your rant I really understand is that it should be easier to unlock your phone to begin with (I don't think it should be legal to lock phones at all) but beyond that I just think Apple screwed their customers and you're giving them a pass."

Probably should avoid iPhones then I guess. Your previous statement of ""I learned that AT&T had locked my phone to their network. They literally installed ransomware on it, forcing me to pay for international service from them instead of using the device with the carrier of my choosing."" is certainly not correct. AT&T didn't install anything on your phone. They didn't force you to do anything. It would have happened with any US carrier. Blame Apple for not making this fact obvious.

That may be the case until your utility company starts going to the state asking for a bailout because they literally do not have enough money to maintain their infrastructure. You can say ""That will never happen"" but it's very possible when you start considering what happens as solar usage trends toward 100% of people in your area having a grid-tied implementation. What do they do then? Provide all of their customers with free electricity? That's not possible, they have fixed costs to actually produce the electricity people are using when their solar panels are not active, and employees.

todayilearned,ff7bl5j,t1_ff5le9a,1579645638.0,"And how much did your solar system cost?

The thing about solar is that most implementations are still reliant on the grid, so even if you get an individual's monthly payment down, the utility company still has those infrastructure costs to bring you electricity when your panels are not active. They're just currently okay with purchasing it from you to take load off their grid during peak hours. This means that if enough people have solar panels the utility company is going to stop purchasing that electricity from you, and you'll stop getting a rebate on your bill. So enjoy it while it lasts. The only way to avoid that is for each solar system to include a battery bank to take it off the grid, which is quite expensive and can double the cost of your system."
