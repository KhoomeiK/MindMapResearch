If she's ready to ask for forgiveness, she's ready to accept that you may haven't healed yet, that you may not be ready to forgive.
Also, if she truly, sincerely, was apologizing, she wouldn't have insulted you after your answer."

vegan,fen20dc,t3_epz9uy,1579275202.0,Even when i was omnivore i thought it tasted like shit xD and i'm happy i never liked that thing.

iamverysmart,feewgw8,t3_eojsy8,1579042716.0,School grades are basically just learning and restituing without thinking. I don't think that's how we judge someone's intelligence...

But when i'll live on my own, i know i'd be mortified in the store and i wish my parents (at least my mom, i don't like my dad, he likes to be embarrassing and finds it funny...) took to buy it when i was younger"
AmItheAsshole,fed13ct,t3_eoc4b4,1578993383.0,"Well, if she says having a right on your food since she thinks you weren't going to eat it, logically you have a right on her new bag since she definitely isn't going to need it"

Undertale,fdz86zz,t1_fdz5m0l,1578787596.0,"I think, yeah... At least, some of the deutsch (not sure if the writing), a lot actually, are becoming closed-minded about immigration, their economy, the french speaking part of Belgium, etc. While the french speaking half of Belgium isn't exactly thinking the same way... Again, i'm not really into politics, so i might say some bullshit.
And how does stuff get done ? We vote for a group of people, and depending of the pourcentage of being elected or not, they're represented kind of the same pourcentage, but some groups make alliances to be bigger or something, but don't want to be with some other groups, bla bla bla... It's a complete mess, i think we should ask someone else to explain it haha"
Undertale,fdy2b58,t1_fdy0qpf,1578775298.0,"The world record is (if i remember correctly) something like 540 days. And we went to vote last year, and they're still arguing xD because the two halves of Belgium are not agreeing on anything (the north part falls slightly into extreme right, while the south part is more on the left (if i'm right, i'm not into politics))"

Ça fait un bon moment que le terme est répandu sur internet (personnellement, je l'ai découvert avec la vidéo ""nom nom nom"" de Parry Gripp sur youtube, c'est adorable, et très vieux en âge d'Internet...

aww,fdxh8ed,t1_fdx61fp,1578768692.0,"""nom nom nom"" est une onomatopée équivalente à ""miam miam miam"" (mais, là où ""miam"" exprime le plaisir de la nourriture, ""nom nom"" se réfère plus au fait de manger en lui-même, le bruit lorsqu'on mâche (et est surtout adressé aux animaux mignons))"

AmItheAsshole,fdox8ja,t3_eme3uw,1578614955.0,"NTA. If i were in the same situation as you, i would have done ""worse""... I simply would have sit where i wanted, and let her complain as much as she was willing to. I'm pretty stubborn with those kind of things xD (wich is funny because most of the time i'm really shy and calm with strangers, nearly invisible). What could she do ? Hit you ? Complain more ? She would not have any solution other than simply shut up because she would be annoying other passengers.

(Sorry for my bad english, not my first language)"
iamverysmart,fdmqxic,t3_elx6hq,1578561390.0,"People with a REAL high IQ don't even know, or will deny it when we say it to them. There's a thing in Belgium called being someone ""HP"", wich means ""Haut potentiel"" (High potential). It's when people have an IQ above the norm. I read the description of HP people, and one of the character traits that they often have is hypersensibility, really big imagination, a lot of curiosity, emotionnal hyper-intensity, and also, they have hard to believe it when they find out they're HP.
This guy, is just stupid xD"

Starset,fdjpmp9,t3_elddkf,1578482438.0,"I discovered them through an AMV (about a fan alternate universe of my favourite video game) that had the song ""Let It Die"". I fell in love with it, and was listening it on loop for hours, then i searched what was the band, decided to listen to a few song, i found Point Of No Return, decided i could stay on Let It Die and that i was never going to listen to their other songs ever again (it wasn't my style of music at this time), a few months passed and i listened again, i think it was My Demons, and then i started listening to every other song of them. They helped me find my musical taste, and my favourite band, them :)

PS : sorry for my bad english, i speak french"

HistoryMemes,fbypu9e,t1_fbymig9,1577223170.0,"Yep ! And the worse ? When the other lands were having colonies, the king was like ""hey ! Good idea ! I want one, what do you think ?"" And EVERYONE voted no. So, instead of having a Belgian's colony, it was more or a Léopold's colony, because he bought it for himself"
