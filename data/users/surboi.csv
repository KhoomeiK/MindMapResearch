Dreams,ffbhc5x,t3_esl0gi,1579765321.0,"Also had it. For some reason the most prominent ones are from the worst time in my life, which is a few years ago and now. Especially places that don't even exist. Though I noticed that some of those places resemble real ones. But it's probably just a coincidence"
aww,ff8b4i1,t3_es47mc,1579671517.0,Remember my cat doing something similar. It was a dead mouse she killed tho but still
ForeverAlone,fepm8zc,t3_eq8j83,1579324226.0,"Something similar happened to me at the start of this semester. A bunch of people from my group were standing in a circle and I was standing a few meters away and so one of them, a girl, mind you, asked me to join. Well, being the complete idiot I am I just couldn't comprehend that they actually wanted me to get there and my fight or flight response kicked in and I said ""no, I'm fine by myself, thanks"" instinctively. I still regret it, it was such a great opportunity and I blew it"
ForeverAlone,fehki7v,t3_ep73yn,1579118395.0,"Well you can go all out and start following r/love to ruin your mood completely lol. But I'd better stick with pics of cute animals and memes about being depressed all the time, thank you"
socialanxiety,fe7tizp,t3_envvbd,1578919107.0,Been doing this for about 5 years at this point
socialanxiety,fe3njvt,t3_enk0w2,1578851035.0,And these are the same people who complain about you being too shy. What is wrong with this world
ForeverAlone,fe3n4sw,t3_enp5ou,1578850841.0,"Very true, for me at least. Don't know if anyone else in here has it but my tastes in porn are just... man, I really sometimes can't believe what I'm jacking off to. Nothing too bad or god forbid illegal but pretty damn messed up nonetheless. Makes me wish I was unable to get erect. And the very fact that this kind of stuff is getting more and more popular leaves me questioning a lot of things. Just look up the most popular videos on pornhub and you'll understand what I'm talking about. And people think it's normal, they talk about it like it's nothing when it's actually an incredibly big and complex issue. But what do I know"
ForeverAlone,fdmgnfn,t1_fdl77y3,1578549253.0,"Thank you, glad you enjoyed reading it!"
ForeverAlone,fdmgjnq,t1_fdljryo,1578549152.0,"Thanks, unfortunately the next time will only probably be somewhere around the middle of the summer but I think I can wait lol"
ForeverAlone,fdmgf78,t1_fdlfmsq,1578549034.0,Thank you! Taking them baby steps haha
dishonored,fdgewv2,t3_el3ibz,1578393587.0,"Just played the royal conservatory mission in the sequel and one of the witches got alerted, got up and somehow knocked a flammable bottle over and cought on fire. Good thing I was playing high chaos cause otherwise I'd be unbelievably mad"
ForeverAlone,fdg26pl,t3_el3mdp,1578377270.0,"I've also seen their videos and tbh their vids are the only kind of vlogs I can watch. Wholesome and actually funny. On top of that, the proof that it's not all about how you look. Basically life-fuel lol"
ForeverAlone,fcwp2m3,t3_eja1bb,1578032219.0,But most importantly: be yourself and love yourself bro. Even though I say you need to change almost everything that makes you who you are just love yourself and be yourself because that tooooootally makes sense. *Walks away with a proud grin*
ForeverAlone,fctdpy0,t3_eis5c3,1577940014.0,Russia
ForeverAlone,fcpejrc,t1_fcpdpjr,1577860582.0,"Well, it does feel like I'm having a conversation and it's good enough for me tbh. Wonderful year to you as well. Hell, I'd even say have a wonderful decade!"
ForeverAlone,fcpbyj4,t3_eieaiz,1577857666.0,"I also talk to myself out loud a lot, though usually it's more of a whisper. It's to the point where I feel really weird being alone in a room and not doing it. And I'm pretty sure it's not necessarily the best thing to do."
ForeverAlone,fckbt0o,t1_fck40r4,1577721779.0,I was referring to the guy who invited OP to the party
ForeverAlone,fcja6rb,t3_ehfd41,1577681134.0,Seems like that's a great friend you have. With that kind of people by your side hopefully things will be easier for you. Good luck
ShingekiNoKyojin,fcgpxrv,t3_eh3e6p,1577642871.0,"I looked at Armin and initially thought ""wow who's that cutie standing with them?"". But then I figured it's Armin.   Fuck. Also Eren's hand looks kinda too long lol"
ForeverAlone,fc8uadv,t1_fc8tsm3,1577542080.0,Unfortunately
ForeverAlone,fc8d8pt,t1_fc8c7j4,1577532294.0,"Yeah, at first I couldn't believe it was real, I really was lying there for like 15 minutes thinking ""did it happen? it felt so real, surely it did"" and then I regained senses and just dropped my head into the pillow. Even my brain hates me lol"
socialanxiety,fc55xwk,t3_eg6fn6,1577444886.0,Every time my phone does something unexpected I immediately go to all of the group chats that I'm in to check if I accidentally send anything. Nothing bad happened so far thankfully but that doesn't really help it. I'm still a nervous wreck about it and it's so fucking annoying
AskReddit,fc3j4wi,t1_fc3i9f0,1577390941.0,"Same. Too bad that occured to me only after having seen some fucked up shit, but you're right, police should make it one of their top priorities to bust down as much rapists, torturers and pedos as they can."
AskReddit,fc3dzvn,t1_fc3aqrp,1577387704.0,"Well, what'd you expect from people who enjoy that kind of things. May be a little off topic but general porn sites aren't really much better tbh. Just recently saw a comment on pornhub where someone said that they were ""gangbanged"" by their male family members at the age of 8. And they said they loved it and kept doing it ever since! It may be true or it may be some guy making this shit up for whatever reason. Honestly don't know which is worse. I want to believe it's just some guy but god damn, knowing what kind of people are out there, wouldn't be that much of a surprise to find out it's true."
AskReddit,fc2kf11,t1_fc2i8i4,1577364701.0,Say nothing? I explained that I meant that we can't say anything about the existence of redrooms because there's not enough evidence to support either their existence or non-existence. I may have worded it badly in my initial response but later I explained what I meant more than one time
AskReddit,fc2d4c2,t1_fc2czuh,1577353177.0,"Again, if it did sound like it, then I messed up but I don't think it did. I've already explained what I was trying to say, you can go ahead and read it once again."
AskReddit,fc2bggl,t1_fc2bbtz,1577350301.0,"I never said they didn't exist, if I somehow did it's a mistake on my part but what I was trying to convey is that there's no evidence redrooms exist therefore we can't say they do. We also can't say they don't exist. We can't make any concrete statements about them until there is proof of either. Hope that clears things up"
AskReddit,fc2bb33,t1_fc2b1i2,1577350045.0,"I'm not making things up, I'm saying there's no evidence redrooms exist. If you have it, then I take it all back but until then I'm just pointing out that there's no reason for us to claim they exist. We may speculate but that's about it. As for gore and snuff on clearweb, just google gore or something similar, last time I checked there are heaps of that stuff."
AskReddit,fc2a47h,t1_fc298wo,1577348023.0,"Yeah, we can make up all sorts of things that make a lot of sense. Doesn't mean they're true tho. What's real are snuff and gore videos. Don't even have to go into the darkweb to see them. That's what's really scary imo"
AskReddit,fc28uf4,t1_fc28qft,1577345991.0,"I get what you're saying but there's no concrete evidence. Do I think someone's already done it one way or another? Yup. But that's just what I think, evidence suggests otherwise. Unless you can find an example but I'm pretty sure you won't be. At the core of it it's all just speculation until we find an actual redroom."
AskReddit,fc27vne,t1_fc1sbbo,1577344551.0,"I'm pretty sure no one has seen an actual redroom, at leats not that I've heard of. Some people mentioned Daisy's Destruction, but I don't believe it was a redroom, as sick as it is, it's a recorded video of a little girl being, well, you know. Redrooms are live streams afaik. I think it's hard to stream anything on dark web due to insane data encryption so that's a huge reason I believe redrooms are near impossible to implement.

But the discovery of Dark Web in general and all the sickening stuff on there messed me up as well. Makes you realize how many fucked up pieces of shit are out there"
ForeverAlone,fbykapo,t3_eeq89j,1577219061.0,"I failed in literally every way I could this year. Can you imagine I actually had hopes for this year? I remember in august of 2018 I was thinking how I was going to pass my exams, get into one of the top unis in my country and everything is going to be picture perfect. I even dared to think I'll become better socially lol. Well,  guess what happened. Because I ended up not getting the scholarship I thought I was going to get (almost everyone gets it where I live, if you don't get it you're pretty much a loser) my parents have to pay shitloads for tuition. 

But even then, I thought maybe I could make new friends here, I mean it's a different city and all that. Nope. I'm too scared to approach people, but even when I do it's horrible. Immediately when I tried to talk to people I saw that ""eww"" look in their eyes. I don't blame them tho, it's only fair they'd be thinking this way seeing how socially retarded I am. 

But what's getting to the most, especially in the last few days is that this year has confirmed my uselessness. I realized that I'm terrible at all the things I thought I was good at. I thought I was great at guitar, can't even play the simplest tunes properly now because of the lack of time to practice, even the tuning gets hard sometimes lol. I also thought that I was really good at programming. But my professor reassured me that I'm not. I'm not mad at him, no, he pointed the obvious flaw - I'm just not good enough. I'm just not smart and fast enough, that's the problem. If anything, I'm glad he did because now I know my true worth, which is nothing. You know, it really hurts when you genuinely like to do something but you also realize that you're just not meant to be great at it. Same shit with math. I like it, but I'm too slow and stupid to learn it at a pace my university wants me to. 

Don't even get me started on realtionships. Seeing that almost everyone I know from high school now has a gf/bf and leads a rather stable social life while I'm here rolling in self pity like a pig just further proves that I'm a failure in every way you could imagine.

Fuck all of this. I feel like there is more and more anger and hate in me every day. Not at others but at myself rather. Deep down I know it's all my fault. I could fix it all but I didn't because I'm too much of a lazy piece of shit and I hate myself for it.

Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year, I guess. Though I don't think it's going to be all that merry and happy if you're on this sub lol."
