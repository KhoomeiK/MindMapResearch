raisedbynarcissists,ffb8rbh,t3_ese2us,1579755316.0,Most common response I’ve gotten is “you need to have a heart and heart talk with them” or something along these lines little do they know anything other than a one sided lecture isn’t possible. Unless you want to get lectured longer or get hit.
raisedbynarcissists,fdzi5y8,t1_fdzgy3f,1578790450.0,"Yup I was literally afraid to speak to him cause I thought I’d say something to make him mad or make him lecture me. When he got me from school I’d just be silent in the car unless he asked me something. I would even wait until he wasn’t around to ask my mom stuff cause I didn’t wanna say anything in front of him haha. Even as an adult it’s still really hard for me to talk to him, we have literally never had a normal conversation in the 20 some years I’ve been alive. The only time we talk is when he wants to lecture or warn me about something."
TooAfraidToAsk,fdzhczs,t3_en93v8,1578790240.0,I think it’s something every socially awkward person does. Maybe socially capable people do it too. I’m honestly not sure if it’s a good thing to do or not because the actual conversation rarely goes how you plan it in your head. Perhaps it’s better to try and learn how to have a conversation normally.
raisedbynarcissists,fdzfduq,t1_fdzehpp,1578789662.0,"It’s sad? Well I guess I shouldn’t be surprised that this happens by now but it always catches me off guard when I say something about my relationship with dad and people go “dude what the fuck?” And I’m thinking to myself “what? Is it that bad?”

Evidently it is that bad"
raisedbynarcissists,fdzeghx,t3_en758d,1578789432.0,"Are you asian? Sounds like asian parent expectations lol. 

Anyway this is something I wish I knew earlier in life: your parents belief of what success is does not have to be your own. For a long time I was convinced going to college, getting a good job, getting married, raising family in 2 story house, and retiring (in that order!) was the only definition of a good life because that’s what I was led to believe. I wanted this so badly and until recently I was very depressed over the fact my life didn’t end up this way. I’m starting to learn that I can find happiness in other ways, I can decide for myself what makes me happy. This is something you can do as well. Don’t let your parents decide who you are going to be as an adult, they did enough deciding for you when you were a child!

I understand how you feel a lot, I sometimes feel that if I’m not doing something productive at all times then I’m being lazy or I’m a loser. But that’s just my dads beliefs that I’ve internalized, it’s not normal to feel that way. It’s important to keep that in mind. It’s ok to just stop sometimes and take time for yourself. I think asian culture is way too work oriented to the point that people literally work themselves to death, this is no way to live that’s not what a “successful” life looks like, at least not to me."
raisedbynarcissists,fdzdb3c,t3_enc3o4,1578789123.0,I’ve just created a fake story I tell people unless I’m really really comfortable with them. Avoids the headache altogether.
raisedbynarcissists,fdzcpmu,t3_enawz1,1578788999.0,"It’s funny how that happens, I’ve been through that too. A male superior at work will compliment my work in anyway or teach me to do something new and my brain automatically goes “father figure” for some reason."
raisedbynarcissists,fdzcgic,t1_fdzc5jg,1578788882.0,I can’t even say I ever spoke to my dad without being spoken to first lol
raisedbynarcissists,fdzce41,t1_fdz1scz,1578788846.0,That’s how I feel. I don’t think it’s just my face I think deep down I am upset I’ve just gotten good at convincing myself nothing is wrong.
raisedbynarcissists,fdy0int,t1_fdx8u9c,1578774766.0,I don’t think I forgave him I just accepted that it happened and that I can’t change that.
raisedbynarcissists,fdwtz0j,t1_fduen6k,1578762319.0,"Yea I feel like I have the same facial expression no matter how I’m feeling, but my logic was “I shouldn’t have to explain to anyone how I feel, if they actually want to know they’ll ask” but I dunno maybe I should just make it clear how I feel."
raisedbynarcissists,fdwt74s,t1_fduqfkn,1578762094.0,Yeah I definitely have SOME habits of his. Like the way he naturally talks sounds really angry and defensive even when he’s just talking about some normal thing. When I’m talking to people I’ve often gotten a response of “why are you so angry?” or “calm down” when I wasn’t even mad it’s just how I talk!
raisedbynarcissists,fdwqybr,t1_fdv2rf7,1578761458.0,"Hmm...yeah I didn’t think about that. If I know anything about that man it’s that he would never think he did anything wrong I think if he were me in this situation he would have found some reason to yell at my son.

Ha I remember one time when I was talking to my mom my dad came into the room and I just froze and stopped talking reflexively cause I was always too afraid to talk normally in front of him. His response is to go “why did you stop talking?! Am I a criminal or something?! I’m not a criminal, keep talking!” Like he’s self aware enough to realize he’s the reason I stopped talking but he found a way to make *me* feel guilty about it???"
raisedbynarcissists,fdwpt3k,t1_fdv4bi8,1578761216.0,"I honestly don’t know I think I just look sad/upset most of the time which Tbf I am sad most of the time so. People who don’t know me very well tend to be put off by how I look it seems I don’t look very approachable, which again tbf I don’t want people approaching me so I guess I really am unapproachable.

So sometimes I think it’s not just my face it’s just how I really feel.

Now that I think about it though, my friends in high school always said I had a huge vein popping out of my forehead, I’ve never seen it though."
raisedbynarcissists,fdwocmg,t1_fdvphw8,1578760810.0,I didn’t want kids either for the same reason but life had other plans for me I guess lol.
AsianParentStories,fdwo53n,t3_cv056q,1578760744.0,Yes you are being abused
AsianParentStories,fdwnpkp,t3_edmvfw,1578760587.0,Yes my dad is so mentally ill but will never get help for it he had terrible OCD. I don’t even know if he knows he has it or knows what it is. I’ve realized most older asian people either don’t believe in psychology/mental illness or they’ve never even heard of it in the first place.
Parenting,fdpjlfv,t1_fdp68mp,1578630393.0,Same here
AskReddit,fdpjjlr,t1_fdp8dlh,1578630352.0,Probably the latter
AskReddit,fdp82ea,t3_emhkiu,1578622185.0,"1) I only voted Hillary cause she seemed like less terrible option

2) I actually like the way trump has handled this whole Iran situation so far

3) I’m very ignorant and misinformed on anything political and my vote is always like 80% emotional."
raisedbynarcissists,fdnmi1d,t3_em4ipf,1578588883.0,"It’s a strange feeling when you see kids having fun with their parents and stuff. On one hand I feel happy that they aren’t going through what I did, and on the other hand it reminds me of what I never had and what things can never be undone. It just makes you wish you could go back in time or something, because the experiences you have can never go away they’re a part of you whether you like it or not.

It’s also funny how you always remember those small insignificant things other people say or do because it’s not something you ever got to experience very often. I remember one time at some family thing when I was a kid we were talking about what we wanted to be when we grew up or something and I said “well I want to be a pilot but I’m not smart enough haha” and then my uncle said “no you are smart enough you’re very smart ok? You’re a smart girl you can be a pilot if you want to be.” And then he patted my head. I didn’t believe him, and I still don’t, but it felt good to know that literally anyone had faith in me even if I thought their faith was misplaced. Before then I was convinced no one believed in me."
depression,fdnl3pv,t3_emaxm4,1578588061.0,"Hahaha I was the exact same age and I had the exact same thought. I told myself “when I’m 18 I’ll kill myself because I’m too useless to be an adult.” Then at 18 I told myself “once I’m done with college I’ll kill myself cause I won’t know what to do after that.” It was weird my dad made me feel so dependent on him that I thought I wouldn’t be able to make it on my own as an adult, that I was better off just dying.

Well I’m 27 now I never actually finished school I dropped out but that’s besides the point. I’ve always been suicidal but I’ve never wanted to die. I’m afraid of dying to this day. I think it’s one of the main reasons I keep going...

Your childhood sounds so similar to mine as well. My dad was the exact same way and my mother, while she had good intentions and did what she thought was best for me and her, was also depressed and a victim of my dad. She wanted to take us and leave him, but wasn’t sure we could survive without him since she had no family in the US and her English was never as good as his.

I think my life is still complete shit, but seeing someone with an eerily similar background succeeding gives me an inkling of hope."
TooAfraidToAsk,fd6gqyb,t3_ek3dvw,1578190759.0,"When I play pretend with my son it basically boils down to pretending all his toys are real. He will take the “story” where he wants it to go and I just follow and go along with whatever he says lol.

Like sometimes we play with my old Pokémon toys that I gave to him and he’ll say “oh my Pokémon beat yours in this way” and I’ll go “oh no!” And then I’ll make my Pokémon play dead whatever lol. Kids are very imaginative, there’s not much imagining you’ll have to do on your own just follow their lead lol. If you really feel stuck just ask them “so what happens next?” or something like that and they’ll decide for themselves."

stopdrinking,fcp45pk,t1_fcp3h5x,1577849909.0,"I don’t really go this particular store often, but idk it’s a liquor store only and the owner is an old guy maybe he can just tell at this point when someone has a problem or something lol."
morbidquestions,fcp26i5,t3_ei9lke,1577848186.0,I think with any significant amount of exposure to the outside world would eventually change their thinking. Makes me think of growing up in a sheltered household. Once you’re an adult in the real world you will get exposed to things that you never knew about whether you like it or not.
stopdrinking,fcipq3k,t1_fcduvt9,1577666896.0,"That’s me. Drinking to me is pointless unless I intend to get drunk. There’s days where I’ve said “I’ll just have a couple” but after a couple I feel like barely even a buzz and I think “well that was pointless” so at that point my brain gives me two options: 

1) just don’t drink at all if you’re not gonna get drunk

2) get completed wasted if you’re gonna drink or it’s pointless

I dunno I feel like I’m a very all or nothing kinda person."
AskReddit,fcipfnt,t1_fcgm3q0,1577666707.0,Can confirm. Was a heavy smoker from ages 14 to 20ish. Didn’t realize how much it was messing with my head till I stopped. I was in a permanent state of melancholy for years.
stopdrinking,fcbdwqo,t1_fcbalft,1577585671.0,I think that to myself a lot to. I think “ok I didn’t drink the past x days so that means I can drink today” but I always go overboard and it turns into a month long binge.
AskReddit,fc74eyr,t3_ege7rp,1577497243.0,"Not me, but a friend of mine is a prostitute. She says she has taken the virginity of a lot of guys and if they’re virgins she will give them extra times. I guess she has her clients pay per hour in “donations” but with guys who are virgins or “incel” types she will give them as much time as she feels like. 

I asked if that was good for business but she says most of the one-time clients are the virgins so it’s not like she will see them ever again. Most of her regulars are apparently older men. I also asked how she knows if they’re virgins or “incels” and she says she can just tell by now. She also said most virgins tell her that they’re virgins."
depression,fc4mms4,t1_fc21dwb,1577421200.0,I think that’s what keeps me going. I think to myself “if I kill myself now maybe I’ll miss out on that one day or one event that turns my life around” or something like that.
SuicideWatch,fc4mfz0,t1_fc4lton,1577421028.0,"Being depressed becomes normal and we feel comfortable being in that state of mind. We look for reasons to feel depressed, it’s similar to people who self harm. Being depressed and thinking negatively becomes almost therapeutic."
depression,fc4mbps,t1_fc1vhad,1577420923.0,"We played split screen just like the old days. Playing Donkey Kong 64 split screen one time is probably the only good memory I have with my dad. This reminded me of that time a lot. 

I remember we bought the game used from  GameStop (we didn’t have much money back then always bought games used) and found out we needed one of those graphic pack things to make the game work so he drove us all the way back to GameStop again to buy it so I could play the game. As mean as my dad was he tried to love us in the only way he knew how which was through providing financially."
sex,fc4lupr,t1_fc4hj77,1577420503.0,"That’s exactly how I’d describe it. I know it won’t even last I just want some instant gratification or something. Just like drinking. The high from drinking lasts like one or two hours for me any drinks after that are because I can’t stop once I start. I might masturbate or have sex 3-4 times in a day but after the first time it just gets less and less pleasurable but I do it anyways. That makes me think “oh perhaps it’s also an addiction.”

Tbh these days unless I’m drunk I have like no sex drive at all. Perhaps my brain has made some sort of association between the two."
TooAfraidToAsk,fc4fvfr,t3_eg1l06,1577415459.0,"In my experience, only white people do that. Everyone else takes their shoes off. And even amongst white people it’s a minority who do that. I come from an asian family and to me the concept of having shoes on in the house is foreign."
SuicideWatch,fc4fu5n,t3_eg359h,1577415430.0,Yep. I think it’s because we’re so used to feeling depressed that it’s like a comfort zone for us. Our brains like subconsciously look for  reasons to feel depressed:
sex,fc4em73,t1_fc4ceao,1577414433.0,So it’s not just me. I definitely cry pretty frequently afterward lol.
sex,fc4952m,t3_eg0uux,1577409993.0,"For me an age gap depends on what stage of life or development you’re in. When it comes to something like yours, I think it’s a little strange. You are still basically a child (don’t take this the wrong way) and he is an adult. It’s different from someone who is maybe in their twenties dating someone in their 40s. This isn’t it so say it can’t work, but if your goal is to have something serious beyond just having sex I believe you will run into problems down the road. There’s only so much someone your age can do to mentally stimulate someone that much older than you."
depression,fc39nu6,t1_fc358jk,1577384829.0,That’s right. I’m a good mom AND a good dad cause his dad is absent. I win by default!
depression,fc39f4f,t3_efvj40,1577384661.0,"I know you said don’t empathize but I can’t help but to say I know how this is. Asian parents just don’t understand mental illness it’s very sad.

If you don’t like jobs where you have to talk to people a lot. Perhaps a warehouse or factory would be good for you. It’s not as hard as it sounds and you really can go all day without having to talk to anyone in those sorts of jobs. Just an idea."
raisedbynarcissists,fc1qxr9,t1_fbzzjpx,1577326904.0,"Perhaps that is a good way to live. Maybe I can’t change the things that happened to me, but I can at least try to help those who aren’t too far gone. I can only imagine how it would have made me feel as a child to have a stranger smile and wave at me. Seems so small and insignificant but to a child whose world is still very small i think it would have meant a lot to me."
raisedbynarcissists,fc1qsww,t1_fc11zb9,1577326782.0,Reminds me of what my therapist said. She said people who had childhood abuse get stuck in their childhood mentality even though they’re adults. Like they stop mentally aging or something.
morbidquestions,fbzax3r,t3_ef0mba,1577240638.0,"They aren’t “lesser known” per se, but people really underestimate the effects of “upper class” drugs like cocaine and prescription drugs. I’ve noticed these days people in their 20s and younger treat cocaine as not a big deal like weed or something, but it’s seriously bad for you."
