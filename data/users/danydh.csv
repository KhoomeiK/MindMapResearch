I'm always a healer in mmos. So I had my class already picked out. I knew elves  specifically high elves are one of the best for magicka. I knew that I'd want my character to have white hair(looks cool to me).

Tbh I knew what I wanted. Only deciding my faction was the only thing that took longer than a few seconds.

I stuck with my character( close to cp 300) for a while. Been playing off and  off for a year. Bought elsweyr last time I had the passion to play eso. Made 2 new characters, necro healer and dps. Ended up dropping them because I want to focus on one character."
