Gunners,ff5o4ka,t1_ff4tzta,1579602744.0,Exactly. I wouldn't say this would be a fair comparison as both still come from the same refs. Without more data it is impossible to say whether refs are easier on Leicester (around 23 / 225 = 10.2% carded fouls) and harder on Tottenham (around 57 / 227 = 25.1%) and us (around 60 / 250 = 24%) or Leicester simply makes less malicious fouls.

AskComputerScience,fdy9kjh,t3_encuqf,1578777469.0,"What you're looking for is something called an SPA or Single Page Application. That's a starting point. It is what most modern websites including Reddit, youtube, etc. use. Data is loaded in the same frame.

It works with a front end and a back end. The front end is a simple page that is made with html, css, javascript. It is nice you know JS. JS allows us to change elements on a webpage as you probably know. The trick is to update elements based on the data the back end provides us after we query it for the contents of one of our pages.

There are a couple of frameworks that give tools to do this relatively easily. AngularJS is a popular choice and is used by Netflix among others. However, I would recommend using Vue.js as it is an easy framework to learn and use. Gitlab, Nintendo, and 9gag show that this framework is also frequently used.

Then you should make a back end service that allows requests for page contents and will serve them to the front end. It is good you know python, because you can use the flask module to this. The [list of companies using this](https://github.com/rochacbruno/flask-powered) is even more impressive including the website your currently reading this on.

If you get this running, you should learn to split your front end and back end. This means that the single page (html, css, js) that you serve, the front end, should be served by a server that is completely independent from the back end serving the elements of the pages. This is such that you can *scale* these individually and get a really big website going."

TellMeAFact,fda53o1,t1_fda165s,1578241801.0,"I looked it up and this is what Wikipedia says on it: ""Due to its size it could ford relatively deep streams, but for deeper ones it was to submerge and drive across the river bottom.

I have never used a Plex server, nor transcoded video files. I have however transcoded audio files, which is a task that with Python and its many modules only took about an hour to figure out how to do.

TellMeAFact,fd2v6qz,t3_ejxnrp,1578151915.0,"In current Machine Learning techniques, people train classifiers, predominantly Convolutional Neural Networks, that are receiving a lot of attention due to their power in image and sound classification. To do this, they need a lot of examples. For some reason, the data sets they use have a disproportionate amount of white, male examples. One possible explanation is that they use the personnel that is working on the project as easily available subjects to take pictures of. According to \[this Time article on AI bias\]([https://time.com/5520558/artificial-intelligence-racial-gender-bias/](https://time.com/5520558/artificial-intelligence-racial-gender-bias/)) only 2% of employees at Google and Facebook are black, and only a fifth of the employees of the top 8 tech companies are female. It might be obvious that having more training examples will result in better performance, which is why some algorithms are awesome for white males while they are awful for black females.  
All in all, the techniques live and die by the data sets they are provided. The algorithms themselves are rarely discriminatory, but the data allows discrimination to seep in.  
Assuming this is the kind of AI bias you were alluding to, I hope this is a clear enough fact :)"
