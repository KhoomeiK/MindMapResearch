insaneparents,feh3fpq,t1_fegzqfg,1579108343.0,"Not a stupid idea to be there. I became obsessed with them when I was 7, and I got my own PC when I was 12. It became my emotional crutch because I went to them as a distraction when I was emotional. Having limits and time away as well as an involved parent would have changed that"

They can do patterns ""better"" than traditional software but not better than people, like maybe reading chat and trying to guess what it meant or image and facial recognition. 

Once thing they are really good at is AI at games and interpreting data into human readable data.

Most of the beneficial things it CAN do still require people on both ends. Replacing jobs that require human interaction? There is no way any AI in development right now will be able to do it better and more cost effective than a human."
