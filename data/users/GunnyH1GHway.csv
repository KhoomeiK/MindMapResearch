aww,ff5p4sm,t1_ff59lv2,1579604237.0,"My 80 lb American Bulldog, Scott type, [Which is low end for males80-100lb dog] is SO strong. He had a best friend name Bruce who was about 20lbs lighter. And he would play tug of war with him by laying down.  My dog would hold the rope and lay there while Bruce jerked and t ugged and pulled the rope till finally dragging Jack across the floor. Then my Jack would stand up, walk backwards to the other end of the room and lay back down.  

Last weekend he was playing with a puppy. It's fun watching him alter his playstyle and intensity to match his opponent/playmate. 

He has come a long way tho. He used to be rough with all dogs, he would run up along side and throw his shoulder into them, tackling them and then he would lay on them. Or he would hit them with his chest. He was always good about using his weight.  And he was wild from the shelter when we got him. Clearly no one had ever worked with him and he had no clue how to walk on a leash. 

He is the smartest dog I've ever seen and I had a very smart dog I raised when I was a kid. If you treat them like a dumb fucking animal they stay dumb animals.  But if you take the time to teach them, some have a great capacity for learning English."

And you cannot win late game without casters. Vipers are essential for abducts and blinding clouds.  Storm is broken. You have to dance in an out to bait storms you cannot just attack.  

Also creep is required.  You need spines/spores and queens.  Never fight off creep unless you just won a battle and killed a lot of their shit. Try and set up lurkers between the third and nat or nat and 4th and attack one or the other while daring your opponent to come get you. Make him move into/through your lurkers. 

As far as bases go.  You should always have a third started by 2:45-3min mark.  Your 4th, [I like 4th and 5th at once] but around 6-6:15 when your main will start running low.  I like dropping 4th and 5th together because if they attack and kill one or force a cancel most people will be happy and go home. Some nev2r find th2 other one"

Draft history doesn't matter, with davie boy picking, no one lasts 7 years. The Jaguars had a chance to fire Dave, who has proven he can't draft. They didnt do that.  So I assume the extra draft capital will be squandered away and in a couple years when Khan finally let's go of his ego and admits he made a mistake hiring dave, they will be in the same spot or worse and will have wasted those 4 first round picks instead of using them as ammunition for the new guy."
