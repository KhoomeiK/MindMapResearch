PrettyLittleLiars,fe863de,t1_fe753be,1578922930.0,I recommend Buffy. And Angel.
Drugs,fe6ugr9,t3_entnjp,1578905522.0,I also don't like this. But if you eat it will help you come down. I used to live in a place where it was being sold (I wasn't an adult. Had no choice.) And they'd be doing this shit for a week or two and then finally eat and pass out for days. They wouldn't eat for the whole week too.
AskReddit,fe6p2u1,t1_fchwo8p,1578898883.0,I keep getting caught mid roll with my face stuck in pillow. It's awful.
AskReddit,fe6n8wb,t1_fbwm7nr,1578896784.0,I fucking beat the life out of wasps if I'd get stung. I hate them so much.
AskReddit,fe6mrq2,t1_fbwf258,1578896266.0,This creeped me out so bad. Those things are so weird.
AskReddit,fe6mfmj,t1_fbwex4q,1578895892.0,I thought Lolita was just a word for hot goth girls once. I was 18. I fell for that thing on 4chan where they tell you to go somewhere and type it in. I was so excited for naked hot goth women. Was met with a message saying ip was taken or some shit. Spent the next few hours terrified i was going to have a cop come to arrest me. Even adults can be dangerously clueless.
AskReddit,fe6m37k,t1_fbwnm1u,1578895527.0,I did this for something. Only I was in 1st grade and it was obvious. My stupid ass was stunned when the teacher asked about it and I told her my mom signed it on the carpet. (My excuse for my shitty handwriting.) She accepted it. Idk if I even spelled it right.
AskReddit,fe6luo5,t1_fbwf0ex,1578895274.0,"My mom told me when she was a kid her and my aunt would take my other ants weird color poop, mix it with peantubutter and spread it on sandwiches for neighborhood friends. She said they ate it and didnt notice."
AskReddit,fe6li60,t1_fbwrsn9,1578894912.0,"There was an outside stove of some kind and a rag covered in ants. I shook them off the rag onto the hot stove and watched them walk weirdly then stop moving. Sorry, I completely blocked that out but reading this comment reminded me. I was pretty young but damn that was awful of me."
AskReddit,fe6l3yi,t3_eetf7i,1578894504.0,"My brother and I were 5-ish and we had BB guns. (Yeah, my mom has issues with knowing what s age appropriate.) We had two satellite dishes in our yard that were kinda big. We were standing behind them and shooting at each others dish. 

I actually had a bb ricochet off my dish and go into my neck. Which is still there today. Best my spine. When it happened my neck kinda stopped working for like 10-15 minutes. Just flopped over and I couldn't move it on my own. 

There was also the time we were lighting black cats  in our hands and throwing them. Mine didn't seem to light so I decided to let someone else take a turn first. Only...the next thing I knew I was in horrible pain and I couldn't move my hand for several minutes after.


Kids are smart. Lol"
AskReddit,fe6kj5e,t1_fbwn6pj,1578893925.0,I dropped a frog on its back and paralyzed it. I then had to kill the frog and it still eats me up inside. I cried for days. Cant imagine the guilt of that many. Edit: I was like 11.
AskReddit,fe6kfm0,t1_fbwnuu8,1578893827.0,My brother called my cousin a son of a bitch at school once and my mom made him do the bar soap thing. I thought it was funny so I said a cuss words so I could do it too. Tasted like shit.
AskReddit,fe6jwd8,t1_fbwiqdk,1578893301.0,I thought I was horrible for spraying someone with can of fart..lol
AskReddit,fe6j9ba,t1_fbx571f,1578892682.0,"When I was a kid my friends and I would dig in random spots in her yard. The person that owned the house before them was actually family and was close to my grandparents who I lived with. Anyways, we are digging and I come across jaw bones with teeth. I thought it was cool so I took them home and put them in a plastic bag in my underwear drawer. When they were found my grandpa asked where I got it. When I told him where his face turned super white and he looked sad. It was that family members dog that my grandpa loved and played with. I didn't understand exactly how awful it was and why for a few more years. My poor papaw."
AskReddit,fe6douk,t3_eic8yl,1578887874.0,No. I'd be replacing my husband with my ex essentially. No thanks.
aww,fdzwfs8,t1_fdzwd4w,1578797439.0,"Actually, it's from a song called Castle Down by Emilie Autumn. Teen me liked it and I suck at user names."
aww,fdzw8jc,t1_fdzvre9,1578797294.0,"My husband doesn't like animals in the house. I don't have my own yard for anything, plus I don't think pets should be left outside."
aww,fdzvwqf,t1_fdy6nx4,1578797060.0,I actually didn't see the state. I woke up to this post and read it wrong through the haze. But thank you for proving the typical jerk Reddit user stereotype still stands.
aww,fdzvs57,t1_fdyuxpm,1578796971.0,"He murdered his wife, unborn son, and two very little daughters. He had to kill the two girls twice. He doesn't deserve shit."
aww,fdzvpcm,t1_fdz2h08,1578796918.0,I've been obsessing over every little detail. I just don't understand how someone can do something like this. Especially to the poor girls. Twice.
aww,fdzvluo,t1_fdz8vtd,1578796853.0,Aren't those things like a placebo? Like they don't do anything but it's advertised for energy and wellness. I'm not sure. Legitimately asking.
aww,fdzvgpb,t1_fdzu5c1,1578796753.0,Thats actually really awesome. I'm kinda jealous. Not allowed to have pets where I live.
AskReddit,fdydekz,t1_fdxfrgt,1578778571.0,Sounds like my kindergarten teacher. Can't tell you how much I cried and got yelled at because I was left handed and it wasn't proper or whatever. Now they give scholarships for lefties. Fuck you Mrs. Dosure.
AskReddit,fdy8m69,t1_fdvsxxk,1578777218.0,Thank God for the perverts.
Showerthoughts,fdy236x,t1_fdwwi15,1578775225.0,"Man, this is a remake I could get behind. My mom was obsessed with this movie but it was always super old looking and I couldn't get into it much. Would be nice to see a new version. (Unless I'm stupid and there is an actual new one. I remember the nasty guy with the pustules in the 1984 version. This movie did not age well. I thought it was older.)"
Showerthoughts,fdy160g,t1_fdwnqib,1578774991.0,Muhaidib!!!
aww,fdy0naa,t1_fdx9hog,1578774813.0,Don't tell me what to do.
aww,fdy0hcr,t1_fdx4sen,1578774753.0,Life looks much different when you have something to care for. No joke. I fully support this and hopefully stuff like this does exist in the US. Except for someone like Chris Watts. He deserves the actual worst.
StoriesAboutKevin,fduuiuu,t1_fdul1y0,1578739051.0,Putting string around it hurts worse than the freezing method imo.
Anxiety,fdsp471,t1_fdqd3ra,1578706124.0,I've tried so hard. It even happens if I'm super happy or mad even. Super embarrassing.
gifs,fdslo5p,t1_fds9k35,1578704801.0,Damn. That's Savage. Sorry random person.
Ghosts,fdqcqgb,t3_emmzz1,1578663152.0,That ghost woman looks like Bellatrix.
Anxiety,fdqcljn,t3_emm7fd,1578663037.0,I'm just impressed you have the skills necessary to potpone crying.
news,fdq9r0d,t1_fdpzwpq,1578660466.0,Well they wouldn't if they didn't have something to hide. Like how a plane didn't hit the Pentagon.
tifu,fdq4t81,t3_emlnqo,1578654865.0,"Okay, so...you should probably get a CBD pen to have in case you accidentally have too much again. I swear it brings you down to a calmer level if you freak out a bit."
news,fdpuar6,t1_fdp8n36,1578640764.0,Unless we all get so tired of this shit we get together to actually do something about it. They have literally fucked everything up for everyone but them. But we are way more people than they are. We just gotta grow a pair and fuck them up.
news,fdptyif,t1_fdojxtp,1578640373.0,"One is our ""president."""
news,fdptraw,t1_fdp9hrh,1578640144.0,Pretty sure they went to every place around there with a camera and took all the footage.
iamatotalpieceofshit,fdee558,t1_fdceuse,1578337048.0,She is going to have this mentality throughout their whole life. Poor guy.
aww,fddco3e,t3_eknfif,1578305877.0,"Man, that looks so fun."
gifs,fddc8px,t1_fdd6rs8,1578305230.0,But does it feel like weird sticky skin when you touch it? Because I've always imagined them to be sticky and unpleasant.
relationship_advice,fcnf9g7,t1_fcmzi7j,1577810511.0,I can actually vouch for this. Try to stop caring what people think. (I still haven't figured out how to.)
Ghosts,fcjrbem,t1_fcgyrwk,1577700713.0,I bet Crocks aren't looking so silly to this former person anymore.
BoneAppleTea,fcjqv0i,t3_ehh40v,1577700043.0,No way.
Ghosts,fcgvxvh,t3_eh6j5r,1577644476.0,This is what my mom called witch shoes. Lol
AskReddit,fbykqbi,t1_fbxqvwc,1577219380.0,Sarcastic assholes are sometimes legitimately nice people.
AskReddit,fbhubh2,t1_f9xzq4k,1576882527.0,They are literally shaking your head from side to side to break it out (mine popped it out from underneath and holy shit it is awful) then get mad when you scream out a little because kids around.  That shit is traumatic as fuck.
