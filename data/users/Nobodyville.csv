Ask_Lawyers,ffgi1so,t1_ffeqa6q,1579906708.0,"It's been a hot minute since I took criminal law and I don't practice criminal law,  so this is just general knowledge.  Since you appear to be taking about statutory rape and crimes involving minors,  I'm assuming what you're looking for is probably strict liability crimes.

1. Every state/ jurisdiction has their own criminal code,  plus the model penal code (which is not binding but has been used heavily in creating criminal statutes in many states). The federal government also has a criminal code ... it does cover sexual offenses but I'm not sure if it covers statutory rape. Statutory rape is a strict liability crime where the ""crime"" is sexual contact between a minor and someone who isn't a minor.  The age of consent differs from state to state so I'm not sure what standard the federal government does/would use. To figure out what it covers you'd have to Google federal sexual offenses and go from there. 

2. You'd need to talk to a prosecutor, criminal lawyer,  or even a criminal law professor to get a feel for this. 

3. Generally crimes are prosecuted on a state level. You can end up in Federal court if you violate a federal statute, commit a crime in a place under federal jurisdiction, or do something to implicate a statute with a jurisdictional hook which will pull it into federal court (e.g. committing a crime that crosses state lines, violating RICO, etc). I'm sure there are other ways as well, but I'm not familiar with all the details.  Also, you can face charges for the same crime in state and federal court. 

4. See #2

5. This I don't know.  Not my area of expertise. There is a lot of discussion constantly about the unfairness of sentencing for minors, and I'm sure you can find discussions of statutory rape/ strict liability crimes and their unfair impact.  Another thing that is contentious are the child porn regulations which occasionally will sweep up a teenager who texted pics of themselves or others.  There are plenty of people with strong opinions... I'd head to my campus library and talk to a research librarian (not the students who man the front desk) tell them what you're trying to find and let them help you find sources/ books/ scholarly articles for your thesis. 

Good luck!

Edit: I read your references to the cases below, without case cites it's difficult to know, but those sound like state cases to me. So they likely don't implicate federal law."

I hope that you're on your way to remission very soon and that the treatments aren't too taxing on you in your last semester!  I'm sure there have been people who have taken and passed the bar exam while undergoing cancer treatments. There was a woman a few years back who took the exam while she was literally in labor. Law students are intense.

Bar studying sucks, there's no way around it . . . I honestly found that the last few  weeks (from July 4 onward) were really the most stressful for me. I was able to chill and watch the lecture videos and study a bit up until that point, then I really buckled down. If you spread out your studying better than I did I don't feel like it would have been as stressful.

Only two suggestions . . .

1. I don't know if you have a post grad job or how long your treatment is supposed to last, but you could, theoretically put off the bar exam until February. That would give you plenty of time.
2. If you've decided on your jurisdiction, go online to eBay or contact any law student friends of yours who may be about to take the Feb exam, and buy their books off of them (after the exam, of course). Barbri gives you like 200 bucks for returning books (at least they used to) so you can usually buy books off a student for around that amount. . . then you could just use their books and start studying early and reduce the number of hours per day you have to put in over the summer. Barbri updates their info by jurisdiction but I doubt enough will changed between Feb and July to really be worried about. If you're using Barbri you'll get your set of books mailed to you (or pick them up) shortly before the class starts."

There's no competition in secondary education, you go where your district lines tell you to go.

Colleges, on the other hand, are very obviously competing for the ""best"" in many different arenas -- best scientists, best writers, best athletes, richest alumni, etc. They have all kinds of incentive to keep their standards high. There are plenty of colleges that are not impressive, and plenty of programs within otherwise impressive colleges that aren't very impressive.

O'Connor was only a state appeals court justice when she was nominated but Reagan had promised to nominate a woman, and there were precious few women on the bench in the early 80s (Ginsburg was a judge at that point), and fewer could be considered conservative republicans. Kagan was never a judge -- I'm not terribly familiar with her nomination process/reasoning.

She's married again for the 4th or 5th time to a trainer of racehorses (big $$$), still trades on my Grandpa's reputation as his ""widow,"" runs a foundation in his name, employs her son from another man while my grandpa's children were never consulted/ invited to participate, etc.

She's a nobody, an American, a divorcee, 4 years older than him. Granted maybe they have a rock solid love. Maybe Harry has wanted out of the Royal family forever and just didn't have the guts to say so, but she sure looks like the Royal family's Yoko Ono. Suddenly he's not getting along with people,   not showing up to family events, breaking protocol, etc. It certainly doesn't help that she's half black, which gives racists everywhere an extra dose of self righteousness. But her race,  at least in my eyes isn't the issue... it's the behavior that we see that wreaks of an abusive relationship. If this wasn't the royal family... if this was someone you know who marries someone,  then cuts all ties to their family, moves them to a separate continent, and then cuts them off from their family's finances... you would look at that person and say ""you married an abuser.""

Granted we don't know about any of the internal workings,  the private thoughts, the 34 years of Harry's life he's had to think about this, but externally it just looks shady AF. Harry's job and his life are not separate,  whether he likes it or not. He has duties as the future kings brother.  He knows his place in the hierarchy, and in marrying into that Meghan knew it too. You don't get to pick and choose when you marry royalty, right or wrong, you married a job not a person.  As time goes on you may step away from the limelight, but you should do it properly and the announcement should come from the Palace to imply that they're granting you your freedom,  so to speak.  An Instagram post is bs.

Tl;dr: who knows the reasons,  but the way it was done was unprofessional, looks shady, and, since Harry doesn't seem like the brightest bulb, it intensifies the Yoko Ono aura around Meghan."

IsItBullshit,fd74hil,t1_fd5my6o,1578199317.0,"Except that slaves, at least in the US, were mostly employed in agriculture. If you get rid of slavery you have to pay for field hands, and the slaves who were field hands and are now no longer slaves don't become consumers of your product. Southern Agriculture would have been cotton, tobacco, etc. Items that aren't directly able to be sold into the market, they need an intermediate step before becoming a consumer good. 

Slaves may have been expensive but they create their own value by reproducing. If buy a male slave and a female slave and they have an untold number of children (no birth control) and some of them survive to teen/adulthood (high mortality) the children become instant sources of income (if you sell them) or become essentially ""free"" labor. I doubt that feeding and clothing them was enough of a cost, at least on a large plantation, to really put a dent in the the income, at least until the war. The US still produced a metric ass-ton of cotton after the war so I'm assuming despite the official ""end"" of slavery, the use of underpaid labor from Black people and assorted sharecroppers still was lucrative enough to justify the system."
Ask_Lawyers,fd6yh88,t3_ek74fq,1578197281.0,"I suppose it depends on what college and law school you are now bound to. Colleges are a dime a dozen, a BA is a BA with few exceptions. Law schools are a different ballgame -- if you go to a decent college but they have a mediocre law school that may not be worth it. Also, what financial aid will you be offered? Maybe you get a lot of need based aid in undergrad, but graduate school only awards merit based aid. So if you do mediocre in undergrad it could damage your chances to get financial aid from the law school.

It also depends on your passion for school. Getting though in 3 years is usually do-able anywhere so long as you come in with enough credits, or overload for 3 years. If you wanted to, you could take the LSATS and apply anywhere -- a make your own 3+3. Make sure you are okay with only getting three years of college experience, and make sure after three years you really want to do law school/practice law. A lot can and will change in your mind and your heart over the next three to four years.

My school didn't offer a 3+3, in fact, I'd never heard of it until today. I don't really see what benefit it gets you, minus that last year of undergrad tuition (which, as mentioned above, you can avoid anyway by completing in three years, or even doing a 2+2 with community college), unless for some reason there is a guaranteed spot in the law school or a tuition break for signing up early."
