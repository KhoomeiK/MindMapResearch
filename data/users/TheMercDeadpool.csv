It was the episode where Ash fell off a cliff, so he threw his Pokéball with Bulbasaur to the top, and Bulbasaur caught him and pulled him up with his vines. I thought that was the coolest shit ever."

nextfuckinglevel,ffdm09a,t1_ffdcmn4,1579823727.0,I always like the comment that’s along the lines of “Shitty move because you could only use it in certain situations”. Yes. Just about every move is situational. That’s why there’s so many.

ThatsInsane,ffb3x3g,t1_ffazqk4,1579751146.0,"Except with wolves it’s far less than 1%. There are only 2 recorded wolf fatalities. Injuries are rare, but a large portion for reasons people are injured, is because they were defending their dogs. They’re only walking away with injuries even when defending their dogs, zero deaths from this.

ThatsInsane,ffb1vt8,t1_ffb0twt,1579749712.0,"One of the top injuries from wolves are from people defending their dogs. Injuries are rare, but they all have walked away with injuries and so far no deaths as a result. Apparently there are only 2 human fatalities from wolves total. I would 100% be more scared of the pit bulls because they’re completely comfortable with humans. What gives us the advantage with wolves, is that they’re not comfortable with us. We’re like the boogeyman to them.

I always ran at them screaming with a gun in my hand if they got too close. I never had to use the gun. They always ran. Wolves are terrified of humans and they actively avoid them. If my dog is getting attacked, I’m running at the wolves screaming, even if I don’t have my gun. Because odds are, they’re going to run. The funny part is that they learn the boundaries. You learn who the frequent visitors are and you see that they respect your space. Except coyotes. They’re dumb."

Bought the part for $20, popped the clips off the interior door panel, unscrewed 2 screws, popped the new handle on, and put it all back. Cost me $20 and 10 minutes of my time.

However, one time I was staring out into our field (lived in the country) and it was like I was experiencing the beauty for the first time. I completely zoned out and time slowed down. Once I realized what was going on, I felt like I was higher, like I suddenly became taller. I looked down, and I was about a foot off the ground. I stared down for a few seconds trying to process it, but then I freaked out and I fell to the ground. I vividly remember floating, falling, and my feet hitting the ground. I still don’t know what happened."

She knows I know nothing about it, but she likes to talk to me about it because she knows I’m interested in what she has to say about it.
