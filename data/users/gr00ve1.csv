In reading through the major part of RESPA    
(a little knowledge is a dangerous thing?)  I’ve found   
RESPA was mainly focused on self dealing by either 
   1)  consumers and their brokers defrauding lenders    
(exaggerating the ability to repay the loan)  or by         
   2)  people in the industry defrauding consumers     
(by offering a more costly loan, so as to get a bigger      
commission).
 
Opaque ploys to cheat the lenders or consumers were illegal. 
 
Currently real estate brokers are allowed under law to rebate.      
to consumers part of their commission for doing whatever      
was needed and legal to find a buyer and facilitate a sale.

In the case of brokers of Reverse mortgages but not regular          
mortgages, I have been unable to find wording in RESPA that           
would categorically prohibit rebate to consumers a part of      
a Reverse mortgage broker’s commission.

It appears to me that since no extra effort or skill is involved      
in helping a consumer choose a larger payout (at a higher      
percentage interest rate), that any extra commission fee      
that results in  the higher amount of commission from      
the lender is unearned and should be returned to consumers      
either as a rebate or used by the lender to make the deal       
better and more attractive to the consumer."
