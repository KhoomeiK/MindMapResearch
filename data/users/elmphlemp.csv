Documentaries,ff7ttpq,t1_ff6t8c3,1579658206.0,"So if Chomsky went and got a degree in political science you'd be more open to listen to him? Seems disingenuous to suggest that a formal education and a piece of paper are the only ways for people to be engaged and respected in the political discourse. Chomsky came out against the Vietnam war at a time when it was in no way advantageous for his career. He's written about why your argument against his public stance is important and [the responsibility of intellectuals](https://chomsky.info/19670223/), public or otherwise to speak out against a tyrannical government. On your point on conspiracy theories, I have no idea what you're referring to. Got any examples?"
