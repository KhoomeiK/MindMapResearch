Even forr the very least skilled workers at the FC they pay better than market rate. In markets where they're not getting enough candidates they may pay a little more than that. Anyone can walk into an Amazon FC and get a job basically without even interviewing and make +$16 an hour with benefits every day of the week with zero experience or previous work history as long as you meet some minimum requirements.
