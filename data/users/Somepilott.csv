Long term, invest in real-estate, trade some options, put it in a 401k and IRA"
TrueOffMyChest,fds9yea,t3_emyumu,1578697754.0,"Well, it’s a normal stage of grief, which really is what this comes down to. I’ve been there trust me. My advice is to hang out with friends, block said person so you don’t see their stuff come up, and keep pressing on with your life. I know it’s hard, but you got this, I’m here if you need anything."

aviation,fbyhx1x,t3_ef62vn,1577217321.0,American Airlines does liveries of many of the airlines that have merged or been bought by American. They are all in the original liveries and it’s awesome.
YouShouldKnow,fbydrjq,t1_fby9rif,1577214351.0,"Because of incidents where people have died because they decided not having a seat belt on was smart. I’ve seen people literally break limbs, and die due to extreme turbulence, had they just had their seatbelt on they would have been fine. Sometimes people just need reminded what happens when you don’t follow the rules that are important. I care about people’s general well being"
