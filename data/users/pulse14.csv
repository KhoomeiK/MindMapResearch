science,fep5ome,t1_feo7b2a,1579312698.0,"Both of those studies confirm that none of their participants had severe peanut allergies. They also confirm that it is impossible to remove all peanut protein from peanut oil. There are people that can't be in the same room as peanuts. It is unethical to claim that peanut oil is safe for them when there has not been one study that accurately reflects the reaction they would have. Furthermore, both sources advise people with severe allergies to avoid refined peanut oil or consult a doctor."
WTF,fep50qn,t1_fenywnp,1579312272.0,Have you tried it? Some friends and I did a shot of 95% grain alcohol at 14. It was the only thing we could get our hands on. It honestly wasn't that bad if you did it quickly. You could feel it burn the entire way down.
science,feo636s,t1_fenljw9,1579295598.0,"I don't think this is true. Studies can't use people with severe allergies, so whether or not refined peanut oil is an allergen is unknown. Several fast food restaurants consistently made me sick, and I didn't know why. Turned out they all use refined peanut oil. I can tell when it's in food, without being told, because it causes hives within minutes."
funny,felhngr,t1_fel3am3,1579222397.0,"I was allergic to chicken as a child. A doctor said I ""grew out of it"". Now I know the truth. Doctors work for the bourgeoisie. Don't eat the white meat. It will turn your brain to mush."

science,feidg6f,t1_fehid9c,1579135931.0,What about asexual reproduction? If a life form self-reproduces is it not a species? Defining a species by breeding compatibility has never made any sense.
interestingasfuck,fee1q5q,t1_fedzp0k,1579024574.0,"Think of the earth's magnetic field as a bar magnet and the Sun as a pot of boiling water. When a bubble pops in a pot of boiling water, steam is released. The Sun has bubbles too, called Sunspots. Instead of steam, Sunspots release solar flares, a wave of magnetically charged plasma. If a solar flare is released in the direction of the earth, it will be attracted to one of the magnetic poles. An aurora is created as the solar flare collides with particles in the upper atmosphere."
todayilearned,fecmcm7,t1_fec0nbw,1578977475.0,"Canada is not miles ahead of everyone else. The current Canadian forestry regulations were put in place in the 1970s and were based on US laws enacted in the 1930s. The majority of first world countries have very similar regulations. Deforestation is a major issue in developing nations, but it's more than offset by the increase in forest cover in the first world. Currently, China is the world leader in tree planting, though they are mostly replacing trees that were cut down in the last century. There is a mountain of forestry and satellite data confirming all of this."
pcmasterrace,fe9sza9,t1_fe9b9xe,1578941218.0,The new line of 10nm Intel Graphics have impressive performance. The top tier ones are on par with a 1050.
todayilearned,fdfgn6a,t1_fdf7pik,1578361246.0,I'm an AI developer. The chips with dedicated cores perform thousands of times faster. Each core is a set of pipelines designed for tasks like matrix calculations. They can solve a linear system or perform matrix multiplication in one instruction. A card with dedicated cores can out perform another card that has ten times the FLOPS rating.
todayilearned,fdfcvdw,t1_fde630o,1578358709.0,"The legal definition of a monopoly, as specified by the Sherman act, ""Monopoly is a control or advantage obtained by one entity over the commercial market in a specific area."" Disney's acquisitions definitely constitute a Monopoly. The government's ability do something about it is an entirely different matter. Monopolies have never been restricted in the US, malicious monopolistic actions are."
todayilearned,fdf4fa0,t1_fdf0mug,1578353064.0,Modern computers don't use FLOPs to accomplish those tasks. Processors now have more advanced instruction sets with many dedicated pipelines. Measuring AI tasks with FLOPS is meaningless for both computers and humans.

gaming,fc2wq2f,t1_fc2kojj,1577376065.0,The RGB stuff is typically cheaper in my experience.   It's ARGB that breaks the bank.
