Dentistry,fc8yvg7,t3_egn93s,1577544317.0,"Cringy. 
My worst dental experience was post-wisdom teeth surgery, and my oral surgeon was on vacation so I had to see the on-call surgeon. Without speaking to me about anything (I apparently had an infection, but he didn’t communicate that to me) he jammed the metal tool into all four surgical sites and scraped away. With no numbing, no stopping when I was screaming - he actually caused enough damage to my mouth that when I drove in tears to my regular dentist she called him asking what the fuck he was thinking.
He talked down to me like I was an idiot and was super aggressive. I was in so much pain and fear that I didn’t eat for the rest of my recovery time, and lost 10 lbs.

I didn’t used to have dental anxiety but I do now. I’m sorry this guy was a total prick to you."
