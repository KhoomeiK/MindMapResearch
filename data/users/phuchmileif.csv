1) I think I was wearing the headset too low. It needs to be higher on my forehead, and I may just have to accept a notable gap between the bottom of the headset and my face.

2) I found out how to go back to the 'tutorial' screen with the green lines, and my interpupillary distance is definitely way smaller than I thought it was. And then I noticed a complicating factor- there's just not enough drag in the adjustment mechanism. Setting it fairly narrow means the lenses get awfully close to touching my face...and occasionally do. And the slightest bump is enough to move the lenses farther apart, causing things to slowly become less focused.

I think I need to come up with a way of non-permanently locking the slider in place. There are BIG differences in very tiny movements of the slider when you get into the inner ~25% of the adjustment range."

But I drank A LOT, developed a very high tolerance, and most definitely experienced withdrawal symptoms if I didn't drink on a daily basis.

...weed is so much harder to quit. If it came down to 'if you had to choose, would you pick weed or alcohol'...I mean, weed. 100%. Definitely.

Not to make light of extreme alcoholism or opiod addiction or anything...but, for me, when it comes down to it...my physical addictions have been much easier to break.

climbing,ff89hja,t1_ff7miac,1579669962.0,"I'm not familiar with anything at Obed (it's all sport, I think? Surely some trad but I think it's sparse).

For Chatt area, T-Wall is the place. Which means, on nice days, it can be a bit crowded, and waits for the good 5.6-5.7 routes can be LONG. Not only are they popular, but because they're the bread and butter of newer trad leaders (like myself), groups may move a little slow.

The upside is that if you can lead 5.8-5.9, those routes will be much more available. The downside? Things are generally a little difficult for their rating (I know everyone says that, but it's at least somewhat true at T-Wall, by anyone's standards), and the apparent difficulty and/or perceived risk of routes rises steeply once you hit 5.8. And, I mean, it's definitely not just psychological...at 5.8, you start hitting roofs. Yeah, you generally navigate around them rather than pulling them, but it's still awfully intimidating.

A brand new leader can climb some of the 5.7's, though. Jaywalker and Nutrasweet are the first two that come to mind; good, straightforward cracks that offer lots of jams that can calm a panic ('for better or worse, this hand isn't going ANYWHERE') and you get plenty of time to think and fiddle with gear (this is why they're busy). 'Nappy' is another good one.

Once you hit 5.8, you get into the absolute classics. Razor Worm, Passages, Art, Prerequisite for Excellence, and some others.

Watches are a good example. You generally wouldn't consider a Rolex made in the 1980's or 1990's to be an antique...but still, something a little grungy but original and undamaged is going to have more value than a watch where all the sharp edges have been blunted by overly-exuberant polishing."

OSHA,feipnfj,t1_feim32k,1579144098.0,"I don't picture 'customers' in the typical 'NSFW' scenario. It's office workers, afraid of what their coworkers, or possibly even superiors, might see. Everyone waves off social media...eBay and craigslist...whatever...things they're familiar with. But don't get caught being a *shameless pervert*!

It's fucking silly. Everything is 'NSFW'...have some discretion.

Personally, I'm about as liberal/left-leaning/progressive as they come. Though I generally just identify more with Marxism and socialism, TBQH...and the entire idea of 'NSFW' makes me say 'what the fuck?'

I think everyone should be capable of living a comfortable life. No one should EVER go hungry or be forced to endure the cold of winter and/or heat of summer. I support social programs, I support single payer healthcare, I support a universal basic income, I support extremely high taxes on the wealthy (as well as a way to collect and/or eject them from the country if they attempt to dodge those taxes).

...why are some of you making it worse for everyone else? A lot of us put in ten or twelve hours of solid labor a day. For some, especially those with multiple jobs...possibly more.

And you've got the gall to spend your fucking pathetic eight hour day doing largely nothing, possibly in order to 'fight the man' a.k.a. your fucking colleagues, dumbass?

OSHA,fehx4nz,t1_fehsxnr,1579125611.0,"Define heavy load? For climbing ropes (most often 9-10mm for single ropes), even after a catching a fall, it's not that bad. Usually just gotta  grab both ends of the rope and kinda jiggle and jam them in the direction of the knot until it starts to loose.

Obviously, though, that size rope is capable of sustaining more force than that, which, yeah, would probably weld it up pretty good.

P.S. what do you guys mean by 'double 8'? You're just referring to a figure 8 on a bight and/or a retraced figure 8, right? Just curious because I've never heard of an 8 with a single strand of rope and am not sure what it would be used for.

P.P.S. I think people grossly underestimate something as simple as a overhand knot. While I would not trust my life to this bucket of cement, I would to an overhand knot, given an adequate tail. Ideally, the knot isn't even capable of capsizing enough times to hit the end of the tails- the rope will break at the knot first. There are some great testing videos on Youtube that illustrate this as well as the general concept of why knots weaken ropes."

Either way...all I would be saying is 'this guy's desk with warp more slowly.' It's gonna warp, either way. Given the resources of the OP, it seems crazy that he didn't at least put a single span of channel or tubing at the top of the legs. Ideally, I would do a rectangular frame for the whole top.

Finnish is black metal; don't fuck with Finns.

Norway (and maybe Iceland) are just the weirdos. Your Bjork-metal. (note: I include Leprous in this and I fucking LOVE Leprous)

And Germans love David Hasselhof. LOL. From what I've heard, they tend to output more traditional American metal (which isn't truly 'American,' I guess). Or nihilistic industrial music. Or mash them together to get Rammstein...

avengedsevenfold,fefxb1r,t1_feesxdi,1579068275.0,"Ghost is good; it just doesn't have a ton of genre overlap with A7X or Slipknot. The latter two are generally described as 'metal' or some other phrase that includes the word 'metal' (e.g. metalcore).

Ghost is like an 80's hard rock tribute band with elements of other genres sometimes thrown in. E.g. prog rock and/or metal, symphonic metal...and sometimes even a little pop.

While it's a strange juxtaposition to their desire for that 'hail satan' image, they're still a good example of German hard rock. It's just that they've got more in common with Mystery or Scorpions than they do A7X."
