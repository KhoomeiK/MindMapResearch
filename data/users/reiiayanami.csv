fatlogic,ff8ac9p,t1_ff7004d,1579670769.0,"In all fairness to them, they mean “unintentional” weight loss in the sense of “I started a new job where I’m on my feet all day”/“These new meds are appetite killers”. It’s not really relevant because these people don’t work like that and they’ll eat regardless of how hungry they are, but that’s the gist of their logic.

But yes, all intentional weight management is fatphoic. Either subconsciously maintain the same habits your whole life or accept every change to your body with glee."
cats,ff89l80,t1_ff88wyv,1579670055.0,"Children don’t routinely hunt and kill important parts of the food chain and are less likely to be killed for sport or by accident. They’re also supervised at ages when they lack the ability to make sound decisions. Outdoor cats devastate the local wildlife and have a much lower lifespan than their indoor counterparts. If your cat really wants to explore, there are safer ways to help them do that—catios and harnesses included."

starbucksbaristas,fejyd74,t1_feiqw6o,1579188651.0,"My old manager once said that it was our third place too, and that’s the energy that I’m keeping with me. There’s a difference between assuming good intent and tolerating verbal harassment. Not to mention that somebody pitching a fit ruins the experience for the other customers."
fatlogic,fej3d4v,t3_ep4l2t,1579155366.0,"I mean, yeah. They do. If you’re not consistently using food as an emotional crutch, not eating food that’s designed to be as addictive as possible, not completely oblivious to how much food you SHOULD need on a day to day basis, and living an active lifestyle. There are plenty of people who get by just fine without ever counting calories. Hey, when I’m not in the middle of a depressive episode, I’m one of them!

Pity that’s definitely not the point that the author was trying to make."

fatlogic,fedfdjm,t1_fdpth7o,1579010011.0,"What do you want her to do, publicly talk about how unhappy she is with her body? Plenty of celebs have been publicly fat and fine with it, and Lizzo’s body positive attitude exists more as a result of a trend that’s been ongoing for a good few years now. If it’s a publicity stunt, it’s astonishingly subtle."
fatlogic,fedeg4t,t3_emudqk,1579009257.0,The atypical anorexia label exists because actual for real anorexia nervosa sufferers need to gain weight immediately and in a very specific way before their body finishes shutting down. They need to gain weight because they’ve lost bone and organ mass. There’s no sense in giving that kind of intensive inpatient treatment to somebody who hasn’t. It doesn’t necessarily have to do with being fat per se—you can be average weight and suffering from AAN.
fatlogic,feddwjm,t1_fdt51lf,1579008796.0,Period hunger is real. Back when I first got mine I had a few days with an all-consuming need for fried chicken wings. It was so intense that I can still remember it.
fatlogic,feddf46,t1_fdrkvgc,1579008385.0,"That’s horrible. I can’t believe you would say that. Roasting something with sugar? That sounds like a recipe for disaster, it would be all crusty and gross. I prefer to sprinkle my kids with a mix of garlic salt and red pepper flakes."

fatlogic,fedc1m4,t1_fecpz9b,1579007161.0,"LOL that’s my exact depression spiral. Managing my weight in the late autumn/winter/early spring is a struggle, compounded by the fact that I have other, more important responsibilities and zero energy. And depression.

The only thing I’ve managed to do to stop myself from overeating constantly is to find other distractions from depressive thoughts. Not that spending the day smoking weed and playing the Sims is that much better, but hey, baby steps. It keeps me busy until I can get around to going on a walk."
starbucksbaristas,fe9p22s,t1_fe9ofgp,1578940195.0,Yes.
starbucksbaristas,fe9lamy,t1_fe9iv36,1578939015.0,Sweet cream foam is really good! Have you tried it salted?
starbucksbaristas,fe9heiq,t1_fe9foms,1578937606.0,"Iced lattes aren’t actually lattes. They’re espresso, cold milk, and ice. They taste different from regular lattes because when milk is steamed, it tastes different. The only reason that they get called “iced lattes” is (1) because of the ratio of milk to espresso and (2) to differentiate them from iced coffees, which is hot brewed coffee that has ice added to it.

You can ask for cold foam on top of a latte if you really want that experience. It’s cold milk that’s blended in a blender and poured on top of the iced latte and it’s 50 cents extra. We used to use that cold foam for cold foam cappuccinos, which were discontinued a while ago. (They were different from iced cappuccinos, which gets made as an iced latte with foam from steamed hot milk scooped on top.)"
intermittentfasting,fe8opwf,t3_eo4a5i,1578928720.0,"Sheet pan meals are a godsend. They’re super easy to prepare (meat, potato, vegetable) and customize (especially when you mix up the herbs and spices) and are also delicious. Plus, the amount of food that you get means leftovers for days and less time spent cooking.

Stir fries are also good, just be careful with the amount of oil that you use. If you’re interested in experimenting with different protein sources, try marinating tofu in soy sauce and using it instead of meat.

Rice and beans can take a little longer to prep if you don’t have an instant pot, as you should be soaking your beans, but you get a lot of filling, nutrient dense food for very little money.

And then keeping some eggs, assorted cold cuts, and your bread of choice around means that you can have easy, quick sandwiches and omlettes.

ETA: If you’re having difficulties with plateaus, and you don’t already weigh and measure your food, I’d suggest investing in a small food scale and a set of cup and spoon measurements."
loseit,fe8mrta,t1_fe663ff,1578928047.0,If you have the option of buying from those farms I would suggest doing that. It might also be possible for you to buy ethically sourced meat—where the animals are allowed to live comfortably and are killed in a way that minimizes suffering.
Sims4,fe88ikm,t3_eo40mu,1578923715.0,"Oooh, that looks like it would work great as a library! Once you get all the requirements in, you could add in arts-leveling rooms (like the gallery in San Myshuno), rooms for clubs, and maybe even a spot for occult sims."

AmItheAsshole,fdzgqog,t3_ekwcw1,1578790046.0,"NTA. Your mom is abusive and that was funny as hell. Sorry that you had to grow up with her, that must have sucked.

I’m not gonna lie though, you might have tanked your relationship with the rest of your family, but if you can live with that then you’re golden."
