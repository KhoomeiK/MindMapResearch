LateStageCapitalism,ffjfc4s,t3_etxtmn,1579997057.0,"Boomer here, I knew in high school I wanted a pension after seeing my dad get laid off every winter for a couple of months.  Not answering the phone because it might be a bill collector.  I  busted my butt in a low paying civil serv job, lived from paycheck to paycheck, couldn't afford college.  Worked my way up from the absolute bottom.  Got raises promotions, started to gradually live below my means over the years.  Retired after 40 years with a pension that hopefully can't be stolen.   I smile when my granddaughter says ok boomer, I think it is cute."
