> To make matters worse in this case, Bryant never really had to face any kind of consequences for his actions. He never paid his debt to society. You have guys like, for instance, Michael Vick - he did some really horrific shit, and then he paid the fucking price for it by having to spend a significant amount of time in prison. 

Saying that Bryant didn’t pay his debt to society because he didn’t do time in prison is based on the assumption that he was guilty in the criminal case. However, we don’t know if he would’ve been found guilty because the accuser withdrew her testimony. Kobe was willing to go through the criminal trial so it’s not his fault that the trial didn’t go forward. That was the accuser’s fault. Also, it would’ve been difficult to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was guilty of rape (sexual intercourse without consent) because the mens rea wouldn’t have been met. According to his apology, Kobe was under the impression that she had consented and that is a mistake of fact, which is a valid defense. Mistake of fact means that, while a person has committed the physical element of an offence, because they were labouring under a mistake of fact, they never formed the required mens rea, and so will escape liability for offences that require mens rea. Rape is a specific intent crime. People v. Mayberry: If a defendant entertains a reasonable and bona fide belief that a [person] voluntarily consented to accompany him and engage in sexual intercourse it is apparent he does not possess the wrongful intent that is a perquisite for a conviction rape under by means of force or threat. The mens rea isn’t met. Coupled with the fact that the accuser changed her story several times, it’s likely that he would’ve been found not guilty. 

But let’s say he did face consequences. They would’ve been minimal since that was his first offense & a plea deal would’ve minimized them. And let’s compare those consequences to his philanthropic work. Society benefited more from him not going to jail. His time in jail would’ve been paid by the taxpayers which would’ve come out to $120K (1 inmate costs $60K x 2 years which is the min sentence for rape in CO). Him being in jail takes away money from the taxpayers. Compare that to all the money he’s donated, the time he spent with kids for the Make A Wish foundation, the money he had raised for Darfur after the war, I think it’s fair to say that he went beyond paying his debt to society."

No, he didn’t admit to guilt. In his apology, he says that she understands how she feels. That’s not the same as saying “I raped her”. That’s not confessing to rape. He’s acknowledging her version of the facts. That’s it. 

>  rape is not defined by whether the man thinks the woman consented, it is defined by whether or not the woman did, in fact, consent.

Actually, the fact that he thought she consented is very important to the case. Rape is a specific intent crime. People v. Mayberry: If a defendant entertains a reasonable and bona fide belief that a [person] voluntarily consented to accompany him and engage in sexual intercourse it is apparent he does not possess the wrongful intent that is a perquisite for a conviction rape under by means of force or threat.

No he didn’t. This is part of his apology: 

>Although I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual, I recognize now that she did not and does not view this incident the same way I did. 

Here he’s just saying that he understands how she sees thing differently. But saying you understand something doesn’t mean you’re saying that it did happen. He doesn’t admit it.

>After months of reviewing discovery, listening to her attorney, and even her testimony in person, I now understand how she feels that she did not consent to this encounter*.

Here, he said that he understands how she feels. But understanding how someone feels isn’t the same thing as saying “I raped her”. It’s not admitting to it. 

>Ignorance does not absolve you of responsibility of your actions in the eyes of the law.

That only applies when people claim that they didn’t know their action was illegal. This is called mistake of law. However, mistake of law doesn’t apply to this rape case. Mistake of fact does. Mistake of fact meanS that, while a person has committed the physical element of an offence, because they were labouring under a mistake of fact, they never formed the required mens rea, and so will escape liability for offences that require mens rea. For example, a guy has sex with a girl who told him that she’s 20 and looks 20, but is actually underage. The guy didn’t know she was underage so mistake of fact is a valid defense. 

> that he didn’t know that at the time doesn’t matter. 

Actually it does. Rape is a specific intent crime. People v. Mayberry: 
If a defendant entertains a reasonable and bona fide belief that a [person] voluntarily consented to accompany him and engage in sexual intercourse it is apparent he does not possess the wrongful intent that is a perquisite for a conviction rape under by means of force or threat.

I just want to point out that I’m not saying that it’s not rape. 

> he's saying that he understands that she feels she didnt consent then he's admitting to rape. 

No, he’s not admitting to rape. 

Saying that he understands how she feels doesn’t express the same thing as saying, “it’s true. I did rape her.” He only talks about his feelings, he never talks about his actions."
xxfitness,ffpnm65,t1_ffpgs5t,1580099637.0,"> didn’t say that I claimed it was rape.

That’s correct, I never said, you said it was rape. Another redditor called him a rapist after reading that he failed to take a drunk woman home. 4 other ppl, including you, said he was an attempted rapist after reading that he failed to take a very drunk woman home.

> gave reasons why it’s important to not consider this rape 

I’m giving reasons why it shouldn’t be considered rape because you asked: **Why is this distinction so important to you**?

My reasons why it’s important to not consider this rape is the answer to your question: “why is the distinction important to you?” You’re the one that asked that question. I gave you my reasons and now you’re complaining?! 

He failed to take a very drunk woman home. Based off those details, I do not agree that he should be called a rapist because he didn’t rape that girl. I don’t agree that he should be called an attempted rapist because that’s not what happened. What he did he do? He tried to take a very drunk woman home, but he was stopped. IMO, saying he’s an attempted rapist is just speculating."

He says that he understands that she feels that she did not consent. He’s only saying that he understands how she feels. In other words, he understands her perspective. He never admits to rape."
