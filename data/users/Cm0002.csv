1) you qualify for Chap 7 unless you make high upper middle class income or higher you can probably pass the means test (Which btw was introduced in *2005*) AND it only counts disposable income. So that means you don't count what you pay towards bills, you can even count groceries to a point (A family of 3 can deduct $742 for groceries, so that's nearly 1k that can't be counted as income right there) 

There are all sorts of exceptions for other things too like protecting assets and equity, keeping your home (varies state to state)

2) ""Your credit will be shot for 7 years"" There was a time when this was true, but these days creditors are having a hard time finding people who don't have a bankruptcy within 7 years, so they are being far far more lenient these days. Most people are able to take out secured loans as early as 6 months from their bankruptcy, so please let this MYTH DIE ALREADY.

And then will deny interests because of bullying, even though it was their fault the deck was stacked against them in the first place.

Other kids are not nice, if you truly want to prevent them from suffering at the hands of a bully then don't give the future bullies fuel on things they can't change (Cosmetic correctable birth defects, picking a good name, taking the time to train him/her on contacts etc), but if they want to pursue an interest despite the risk of bullying then you should support them because chances are they already factored in the bully situation and still want to pursue it"

For those who don't know, water in of itself *can't* carry electricity nor can it leave deposits. Most of the water we drink carry microscopic minerals and ions between them of some sort and it's these that allow electricity to use water as a conduit. By using the ions to connect with minerals and such it disperses through the water. On top of all that, as the water drys it leaves these mineral deposits on the boards and one deposit that connects 2 pins shorts the board.

2) ""Your credit will be shot for 7 years"" There was a time when this was true, but these days creditors are having a hard time finding people who don't have a bankruptcy within 7 years, so they are being far far more lenient these days. Most people are able to take out secured loans as early as 6 months from their bankruptcy, so please let this MYTH DIE ALREADY.

And then will deny interests because of bullying, even though it was their fault the deck was stacked against them in the first place.

Other kids are not nice, if you truly want to prevent them from suffering at the hands of a bully then don't give the future bullies fuel on things they can't change (Cosmetic correctable birth defects, picking a good name, taking the time to train him/her on contacts etc), but if they want to pursue an interest despite the risk of bullying then you should support them because chances are they already factored in the bully situation and still want to pursue it"

For those who don't know, water in of itself *can't* carry electricity nor can it leave deposits. Most of the water we drink carry microscopic minerals and ions between them of some sort and it's these that allow electricity to use water as a conduit. By using the ions to connect with minerals and such it disperses through the water. On top of all that, as the water drys it leaves these mineral deposits on the boards and one deposit that connects 2 pins shorts the board.

Deionized water is purified to a degree to remove most if not all of the minerals and then put through a process to remove the ions."
