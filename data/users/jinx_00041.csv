relationship_advice,ffe1i6t,t3_es0f9i,1579834264.0,I read your story yesterday and agree that getting back with this girl is a bad idea. Have you talked to after your car conversation? Maybe expressed a yay or nay as to continuing?
relationship_advice,ffd5d8m,t3_esz5gw,1579813739.0,Say you’ll get a tatt and be done with this argument
relationship_advice,ffcw1o5,t1_ffccpx8,1579808452.0,"Dude, I’m so sorry but I think you’re front row to the end of your marriage."
relationship_advice,ffc8wm6,t3_esu1qv,1579794223.0,"Dude, tell this chick to fuck off. No need to worry, she’ll warm someone else’s bed quickly after. Kick her to the curb and reestablish your gaming relationships. They’re more fruitful right now anyways."
relationship_advice,ffc18sc,t1_ffbsam3,1579788963.0,"I think the problem is that while you’re wife is being satisfied, it’s not by you. So she’s getting her fix from someone else. I hate to say it, but it’s sounding like you’re about to be pushed out permanently. You gotta do something fast if you don’t want that. Communication is key!"
relationship_advice,ffbx622,t1_ffbg04s,1579785662.0,"Dude, I’m glad everything is moving forward in a way that is ok with you. So sorry this happened to you. I suspect her deleting the messages was more about saving herself than anything. But you seem ambivalent to the message thing right now, which is great! And nice on her paying the early termination costs. 

Now is the time to work on you. I’ve been where you are. I’ve walked in your shoes. If you need anything, feel free to message me. I’ll be more than happy to assist. Best of luck!"
relationship_advice,ffbrs61,t1_ffbcinc,1579780234.0,"Holy smokes! Yeah man, pull the rip cord and bail on this whole thing. Best of luck dude"
relationship_advice,ffb9fdy,t3_eslxah,1579756071.0,"Dude, listen to your gut. This sounds all bad. And she’s not messed up over the husband of multiple years? How messed up is she not going to be over you if she leaves? Time to bail."
relationship_advice,ffapw3o,t1_ffahd6v,1579741709.0,So how did that conversation go? After your post I’d have assumed she would have been indifferent about the whole thing. But you did good. I hope you find everything that you deserve in life.
relationship_advice,ffamxze,t1_ffafxog,1579739724.0,"Trust your gut. You’re the man on the ground. From what you’ve said, there’s warning bells going off for good reason. And there’s something to be said with multiple people telling your fiancé to not be alone with this guy. Have you talked to his sister? Asked if she’s ok?"
relationship_advice,ffae45z,t1_ffabn93,1579733457.0,"So is this guy bigger than you? Do you fear for yourself too? I know you’ve tried talking to him and he is dismissive. Maybe he doesn’t see you as anyone of real consequence. But for sure, watch out for your fiancé. This guy sounds like he has the potential to be dangerous."
relationship_advice,ff9xizc,t3_esdef7,1579723661.0,"Dude, just discreetly tell your future brother in law."
relationship_advice,ff9w5xh,t3_esg96s,1579722826.0,You’re wife sounds like a misandrist. Sorry this happened to you. And to be put down in front of her friends. I’d be pretty upset. Next thing she does would surely not get a thank you.
Marriage,ff9temu,t3_esfrx4,1579720862.0,Nope. But does sound super fishy. Might want to do some digging
relationship_advice,ff96zqi,t1_ff8zmqr,1579706316.0,"Dude, I’m sorry if I was harsh. I’m just angry for you. I myself had a first wife who decided we were done and moved out into some dudes place. A month later she came talking about reconciliation claiming they never slept together. I was like, “you’ve got to be out of your fucking mind if you think I’m going to believe anything you say”. I cut that out immediately and there was no confirmed cheating. Yours is confirmed. 

But you do need to get ahead of this thing quickly with your friends. Have a text drawn up explaining what happened to you two. This is so your soon to be ex gf doesn’t poison the well. 

Just food for thought. You have a whole bunch of peeps standing behind you man! Rooting for you to do the right thing. And remember, you deserve to be someone’s first choice. Not there backup plan."
relationship_advice,ff912j4,t3_esandn,1579702167.0,"Dude, tell your gf what’s up. If not, then you’re about to watch your girl get fucked by a dude while you sit sidelined. And that’s in the cuckold territory. Sorry dude."
relationship_advice,ff8ymui,t1_ff8nk6d,1579700235.0,"Dude, she barely knew the guy and fucked him. Continued the affair. You caught wind and she said she’s not breaking contact. What’s there to think about. She just disregarded you and your feelings. Sure, she may have loved you at some point, but that time has gone. SELF RESPECT is a thing. You understand that right? I’m not trying to dog you, but more open your eyes to the fact that the girl you loved is gone! And she put your health at risk by fucking that dude raw. WTF!!!! If it were me, after she said I’m not cutting contact, I’d have told her to pack her shit and GTFO! She doesn’t sound remorseful. You’re relationship is over. I’m sorry dude, but it is. The sooner you digest that, the better. Hope you make the right call. Bust of luck dude!!"
relationship_advice,ff8sboe,t1_ff8n6id,1579694168.0,That’s not good at all man. Enjoy the sex and leave on your own terms.

relationship_advice,ff7pjjh,t1_ff6w68r,1579655220.0,"You fight for him! Don’t let him go that easily. I mean, what brought you together in the first place. How long have you two been together? I get that he blocked you, but go to his house. Say WTF?"
relationship_advice,ff7ohfq,t1_ff7hrr4,1579654478.0,You deserve better! That’s all there is too it. You deserve someone who will bend over backwards for you too!!
relationship_advice,ff7o97u,t1_ff7hrzi,1579654316.0,Hey Jane doe. I haven’t spoken to you in a long time but I was watching a classic movie with an actress that bears a similar resemblance to you. It got me thinking about you and just wanted to reach out and see how you were doing.
relationship_advice,ff7ftby,t3_es1gzp,1579648562.0,"Just relax. If he hasn’t responded in hours, then ok. But just talk to him. Let him know what’s going on in your head. It’s ok to be nervous about things. But if you really think there’s a problem, then vocalize it and try not to internalize. You got this! Best of luck."
relationship_advice,ff7edo1,t1_ff6oo5f,1579647614.0,You seem intent on doing this. I’d advise against it as it seems petty. Be the bigger person and just move on.
survivinginfidelity,ff6ybzi,t1_ff4xfuj,1579637402.0,"Because she’s heavy into women! No matter what she says, you can’t trust her. She’s proven to be shady before. And you as a product of the same deceit, should be careful while playing with fire. The 3-some sounds awesome. But investing the feels... no way"

relationship_advice,ff5wg3u,t1_ff5tk99,1579612541.0,"Did you reciprocate the gesture? If so, cool beans. You owned up, he’s cool. Just talk to him about your insecurities. Communication is key. It’ll help you to work out your feelings"
TrueOffMyChest,ff5w8t0,t1_ff5l03g,1579612356.0,For sure!
relationship_advice,ff5vprj,t1_ff5ps2x,1579611867.0,"Can you get phone records? Show the number of texts between the two? I’m sure you two shared accounts back then. Also, your ex is a piece of shit"
relationship_advice,ff5ryh9,t3_erolvn,1579607947.0,"Dude, your fears have been validated. Now you can find better ways to let her know this is making you feel bad, but your gurl has been feeding into your insecurities whilst telling you that you have nothing to worry about. Sounds like you need to get rid of her and work on your own insecurities before getting into another relationship."
survivinginfidelity,ff598ul,t3_dpxyuy,1579584059.0,Any updates?
relationship_advice,ff4gl0b,t1_ff4fapa,1579563103.0,Good call. Sorry it didn’t work out. But you’ll be a catch for some lady who’s worth your time
relationship_advice,ff4b5p5,t1_ff49b45,1579559520.0,"Splitting the cost is fair. So it’s safe to assume that you’re fearful of getting pregnant now, but maybe not down the road?"
relationship_advice,ff42wva,t1_ff3wpyp,1579554372.0,Maybe husband could get a vasectomy? Take the pressure off of you.
TrueOffMyChest,ff427lm,t3_eriosu,1579553938.0,"I’m so sorry for your loss. That is so horrible to hear. And from your beautiful description of him, it sounds like the world has truly lost of a beautiful soul."
offmychest,ff3vsw9,t1_ff3tl3s,1579549941.0,"Have you told him how you feel and allowed him to view your insecurities? If not, that’s ok. But just know that you’re closing the chapter of your life before your partner has succeeded or failed. And that’s ok if that’s what you want. But to really put yourself out there is to give someone the opportunity to hurt you like no one ever has before. And that can be scary. But if you do, and they prove to be every bit that you hoped they could be is an amazing feeling. But you have to want to. And if you don’t, that’s ok too. 

If your gut is telling you it’s time to pack up, then listen to it. It’s personal intuition that’s speaking to you. Don’t be scared to listen to yourself. You know yourself better than anyone. I wish you the best of luck my friend!!"
relationship_advice,ff3t80a,t3_eree5h,1579548339.0,Did you ask her if there’s anyone else or if something happened while on vacay?
offmychest,ff3szgj,t1_ff3rtul,1579548192.0,So you have been feeling this way for quite some time then. So what makes you feel this way now (wanting time break up) and not earlier? Has something changed?
offmychest,ff3r4np,t3_erhdlf,1579547054.0,How long have you two been together?
relationship_advice,ff3ogzm,t1_ff3ir18,1579545432.0,You tell her exactly that. All in or all out. You’re not anyone’s back up plan. You deserve to be the first choice. Tell her you deserve better!
relationship_advice,ff3ljvp,t3_erbrbl,1579543624.0,"Consent is a thing. But if you have trouble talking to your gf about what is ok and not ok concerning you, then you have bigger problems then her wanting to do stuff. Communication is key, especially with bdsm. 

Here’s a scenario, you agree to be tied down. All of a sudden your not comfortable with what’s going on, you say stop and she doesn’t. Then you’ve just been raped. Would you say something? Or a threesome and she focuses more on the third and not you. Again, would you say something?"
relationship_advice,ff1u1s0,t3_er3ei6,1579486183.0,"Dude, it’s almost as if your gf is cheating on you with the girl that wants to fuck your girl. This is a giant red flag, especially since your girl knows all about this. I’d confront her about knowing they’re still talking. But there’s not really an assurances she can offer you since she said she’d stop taking before and didn’t. BTW, that’s called lying. If it were me, I’d seriously think about splitting up because you gurl has indicated that she can’t be trusted. Best of luck dude."
TrueOffMyChest,ff1slov,t3_er5d2z,1579485260.0,"Congrats to you. If your family and friends can’t be happy for you and stop skinny shaming you for your life style change, then fuck em! Get new peeps that are healthy for you. Do what makes you feel good. Treat yo self 2020!!"
relationship_advice,ff1pvpa,t3_er48cc,1579483538.0,Great conclusion. Thank you for your story.
relationship_advice,ff1p8yd,t3_er39q5,1579483127.0,"LDR’s are very difficult. Arguments that are “resolved” are never really resolved because there’s no physical connection there. Makes things hard. My wife and I started long distance (Navy guy), plus a deployment or two made things incredibly difficult and we broke up three separate times, but always got back together. So if you care for him enough and really want this, then fight for it. I know he broke it off, but LDR is tough on both parties. I hope this helped."

Marriage,fezljx4,t1_fezk5u3,1579458634.0,"Well your story is a bit ambiguous. So I’m not for sure. Are you guys having any problems? Do you think there’s someone else? When did he come home? And did he bring snacks?

Edit: did he come back at all?"
relationship_advice,fezl6vo,t1_fezb1i2,1579458516.0,"It just seems like you’re already cheating on your bf. Just do him a kindness (your bf) and let him go. I don’t think you’re doing your relationship any service by monkey branching like you are. And I’m not trying to be mean, but what you’re doing isn’t right and I think you know that. Just let your bf go and figure out what YOU want that’s not at the detriment of anyone else."

relationship_advice,fewbd1i,t1_feuy63x,1579407913.0,"But he didn’t know she had a bad day. OP’s post said she texted him saying the guy was a creep. Nothing else. Additionally while he did yell, OP stated he’s a really good dude who treats her well. Sounds like you may be projecting you’re vegan sensitivity. 

As for OP, you should def tell him. If he’s as good as you say, tell him immediately and let him respond. I’m so sorry this happened to you. It should never happen to anyone!"

But for sure she don’t give a shit about you other than your monies. She for sure fucking someone else. You did the right thing separating finances. Do you have anyone else who can watch over your home? Because she can still screw that up. Any kids or anything? Have you confronted her about the affair?"
offmychest,feot1ci,t3_eq6lmk,1579304988.0,"Wait, she lied to you. You caught her and she refused to tell you who it was? Did she seem remorseful? You said you haven’t discussed it since it happened. So was it just business as usual? Did you become physical immediately after? If you never discussed it, sounds like she got off free and clear."

TrueOffMyChest,fel2d7r,t3_epe2f5,1579212560.0,"I had a lesbian work colleague, and during a hypothetical conversation about falling in love Bill Murray because of his personality (I’m straight male btw), I admitted that while I’m not gay i could quite possibly fall in love with Bill Murray via his personality. I then shot the thought over to my colleague who said it wasn’t possible. I of course said “really? Why not?” and was met with “BECAUSE I’M A LESBIAN!”. This was said very angrily. I just dropped it there. I just didn’t know till that point that her sexual orientation defined not only her sexual preferences but also her personality. So sad."
relationship_advice,feh1hbf,t1_feh0b3z,1579107169.0,"Just going off you’re answer, I would think that means you and your partner are not compatible meaning that you’re not right for him and vice versa. I’m sorry if this is not something that you don’t want to hear,  but if you can’t talk about that with your SO, then who can you? And if you do in fact talk to someone else about that, then you will have successfully circumvented your whole relationship. Sounds like it’s time to push the stop button and get off."

relationship_advice,fecouqu,t1_fec5yl2,1578979439.0," Now tell her to get the fuck out. I’m sorry this is happening to you, but you’re looking like a fucking chump right now.
