For you, honestly Im glad your husband has your back. Your sister seems extremely selfish for not only her problem but including you as well. I wish the best for you and when you feel like everything is getting to be too much, grab your husband and hug him as tight as you can. Cause when its all said and done, its you two together as a family. You got this!"
relationship_advice,ffjcqu4,t1_ffj0b9v,1579995545.0,"Navy dude here. Ive been in for 15 years. Its a great opportunity for him, but youre right to be fearful. He will be sent places halfway around the world for years at a time. And it is going to be hard for him as well as yourself if you stay together. But its not impossible. And both of you are going to be tempted to stray. It happens to a lot of people and destroys relationships. Im just telling it straight. I myself am fortunate to have a great wife that goes with me. But even then its still incredibly difficult. We just spent three years in Europe. Great experience but cut off from everything we know. You two need to sit down and discuss where you want to see your relationship going. Youre both young and things change. Even if he didnt go and you guys stayed together, who knows what life has in store for you. Just talk it out. If you have any questions, please feel free to hit me up. Good luck to you."
relationship_advice,ffiyfj5,t1_ffivrnu,1579985794.0,"Dude, you should watch some informational videos on the vagina. Not a diss. The more you know the better it will be. For example, there is a cluster of nerves about an inch below the cervix (towards her back) that when stimulated will enhance sex. Also, pay attention to your girl. Not every vagina is the same. So some positions (leaning left or right) will enhance the experience because she could be more sensitive to one side. Just a heads up."

You said youd have dropped everything if the situation was reversed. EVERYBODY else would have done the same thing.

relationship_advice,fff1pvx,t1_ffez08d,1579873291.0,"The overpowering portion is what were all talking about. That youre wife is developing a relationship that doesnt require you. From your comments you seem to be okish with it at the moment. Have you discussed with your wife how far she wants to take this? Because your marriage should take priority but I get the sense from your writing that it doesnt. And your third partner seems more interested in your wife than you. For a thruple to work, all parties need to feel validated."

relationship_advice,ffc18sc,t1_ffbsam3,1579788963.0,"I think the problem is that while youre wife is being satisfied, its not by you. So shes getting her fix from someone else. I hate to say it, but its sounding like youre about to be pushed out permanently. You gotta do something fast if you dont want that. Communication is key!"
relationship_advice,ffbx622,t1_ffbg04s,1579785662.0,"Dude, Im glad everything is moving forward in a way that is ok with you. So sorry this happened to you. I suspect her deleting the messages was more about saving herself than anything. But you seem ambivalent to the message thing right now, which is great!

relationship_advice,ffamxze,t1_ffafxog,1579739724.0,"Trust your gut. Youre the man on the ground. From what youve said, theres warning bells going off for good reason. And theres something to be said with multiple people telling your fianc to not be alone with this guy. Have you talked to his sister? Asked if shes ok?"
relationship_advice,ffae45z,t1_ffabn93,1579733457.0,"So is this guy bigger than you? Do you fear for yourself too? I know youve tried talking to him and he is dismissive.

relationship_advice,ff96zqi,t1_ff8zmqr,1579706316.0,"Dude, Im sorry if I was harsh. Im just angry for you. I myself had a first wife who decided we were done and moved out into some dudes place. A month later she came talking about reconciliation claiming they never slept together. I was like, youve got to be out of your fucking mind if you think Im going to believe anything you say. I cut that out immediately and there was no confirmed cheating. Yours is confirmed. 

But you do need to get ahead of this thing quickly with your friends. Have a text drawn up explaining what happened to you two. This is so your soon to be ex gf doesnt poison the well. 

Just food for thought. You have a whole bunch of peeps standing behind you man! Rooting for you to do the right thing. And remember, you deserve to be someones first choice. Not there backup plan."

relationship_advice,ff8ymui,t1_ff8nk6d,1579700235.0,"Dude, she barely knew the guy and fucked him. Continued the affair. You caught wind and she said shes not breaking contact. Whats there to think about. She just disregarded you and your feelings. Sure, she may have loved you at some point, but that time has gone. SELF RESPECT is a thing. You understand that right? Im not trying to dog you, but more open your eyes to the fact that the girl you loved is gone! And she put your health at risk by fucking that dude raw. WTF!!!! If it were me, after she said Im not cutting contact, Id have told her to pack her shit and GTFO! She doesnt sound remorseful. Youre relationship is over. Im sorry dude, but it is. The sooner you digest that, the better. Hope you make the right call. Bust of luck dude!!"

But just know that youre closing the chapter of your life before your partner has succeeded or failed. And thats ok if thats what you want. But to really put yourself out there is to give someone the opportunity to hurt you like no one ever has before. And that can be scary. But if you do, and they prove to be every bit that you hoped they could be is an amazing feeling. But you have to want to. And if you dont, thats ok too.

Heres a scenario, you agree to be tied down. All of a sudden your not comfortable with whats going on, you say stop and she doesnt. Then youve just been raped. Would you say something? Or a threesome and she focuses more on the third and not you. Again, would you say something?"
relationship_advice,ff1u1s0,t3_er3ei6,1579486183.0,"Dude, its almost as if your gf is cheating on you with the girl that wants to fuck your girl. This is a giant red flag, especially since your girl knows all about this. Id confront her about knowing theyre still talking.

relationship_advice,ff1p8yd,t3_er39q5,1579483127.0,"LDRs are very difficult. Arguments that are resolved are never really resolved because theres no physical connection there. Makes things hard. My wife and I started long distance (Navy guy), plus a deployment or two made things incredibly difficult and we broke up three separate times, but always got back together. So if you care for him enough and really want this, then fight for it. I know he broke it off, but LDR is tough on both parties. I hope this helped."

A month later she came talking about reconciliation claiming they never slept together. I was like, “you’ve got to be out of your fucking mind if you think I’m going to believe anything you say”. I cut that out immediately and there was no confirmed cheating. Yours is confirmed. 

But you do need to get ahead of this thing quickly with your friends. Have a text drawn up explaining what happened to you two. This is so your soon to be ex gf doesn’t poison the well. 

Just food for thought. You have a whole bunch of peeps standing behind you man! Rooting for you to do the right thing. And remember, you deserve to be someone’s first choice. Not there backup plan."

I’m not trying to dog you, but more open your eyes to the fact that the girl you loved is gone! And she put your health at risk by fucking that dude raw. WTF!!!! If it were me, after she said I’m not cutting contact, I’d have told her to pack her shit and GTFO! She doesn’t sound remorseful. You’re relationship is over. I’m sorry dude, but it is.

But if you do, and they prove to be every bit that you hoped they could be is an amazing feeling. But you have to want to. And if you don’t, that’s ok too.

relationship_advice,fczrdbo,t3_ejnqci,1578107317.0,Just wanted to say good luck with round two. You know what you do and don’t want. That’s more than most people. Congrats and good luck! I hope you get everything that you want and deserve.
relationship_advice,fczkasn,t3_ejmp54,1578103097.0,"Dude, know your self worth. She doesn’t deserve you and you deserve to be loved unconditionally. What she did is not ok."

AsOneAfterInfidelity,fcxjppy,t1_fcuxo04,1578064615.0,"Hey man, from your post and comments, it doesn’t sound like your wife is invested in fixing your marriage at all. And that really sucks. I hope you find the strength to do what’s best for you and yours. I’ve seen it wrote before about children doing better with divorced parents vice parents who resent each other. Food for thought."
AsOneAfterInfidelity,fcxj6j5,t1_fcvyilo,1578064245.0,Did you ask her for clarification or if she misspoke? Because I agree with you. Four months vs fifteen changes things a lot. Best of luck man!
relationship_advice,fcwobxf,t3_ejaxn1,1578031487.0,"Dude, you are being manipulated so badly. This lady is no good at all!!"
relationship_advice,fcw9z7g,t1_fcvc2z2,1578020555.0,"Oh man, that sucks. She saw the true power of the dark side and never looked back. A thousand generation of monogamists live in you now. But this fight is yours! 

But seriously, do what you think is right. You got this!"
relationship_advice,fcvmxbq,t3_ej49uc,1578005551.0,"Dude, she is breaking up with you. You just have to finalize it"
