IdiotsInCars,ff9z5oi,t1_ff9z0h6,1579724625.0,I’m sorry I thought this was like an agreed upon thing that trailers don’t go through drive throughs. Almost every restaurant in this town with a drive through has a sign that says no trailers. I didn’t think people though this was ok

NoStupidQuestions,ff265da,t1_ff25z3q,1579494896.0,No one dies in my scenario? Like even if he did steal it people would go to the Krusty Krab because Spongebob makes them better. I’m literally asking what is driving that single celled man to steal something that would in no way benefit him?? And there is way more to spongebob than plankton stealing the formula.

So this isn’t the first time I’ve shit myself at work. The second time actually. Completely different jobs, completely different towns. The first time it happened I was a CNA working the night shift. It was winter, flu season. All of my roommates at the time were sick, but I thought I had avoided it. Nope. Around 4 am after breathing checks something didn’t feel quite right. I was like ok this is it I have gotten sick I am ready to die. I only had two hours of shift left and I thought I could make it. Since I was one of three in the whole building working, I farted at the nurses station. Mistake. My brand new underwear were ruined. I peeled them off cleaned myself and my scrub pants the best I could. I packed my underwear in a bag to discretely remove from the building. Luckily no one caught onto me. 

A few days later my boyfriend at the time throws away the underwear I was going to clean. So he goes and buys me the same exact pair. This is where it gets interesting. 

Fast forward about a year to today. When I woke up this morning I felt fine. I got dressed and ready for work like normal and went in. About an hour into my shift, I’m the only one in the store. I felt like I had to fart and did because hey no one is here. Mistake #2 (no pun intended).  I shit my pants sitting at one of the tables on a fabric chair. Oh no. I get up and there’s a stain. Double oh no. I go to the bathroom and frantically called my boyfriend telling him I need pants and underwear do not ask questions. As I’m cleaning myself up and putting my clothes in a bag I noticed something. The pair of underwear I wore today are the replacement pair for the ones I originally shit in.

Moral of the story: [this](https://images.app.goo.gl/eSB49UwRSBqJgUbu9)  underwear is cursed"
