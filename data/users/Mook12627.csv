Warmup

Main set 1 


Cool down

Of course there’s a million variations there, but usually something similar to that.

Usually warmup would be mostly freestyle (crawl) swimming fairly long, low intensity swims. The main set is often slightly shorter swims at a higher intensity, although depending on what you’re training for they may be significantly longer. Cool down is usually one medium-long very low intensity swim to rest your muscles and help you recover. 

If your goal is to do 1000 yards in a day, I might recommend something like

200 yards free (crawl)

4x100 yard swims, any stroke (probably free or backstroke so it’s easier on your back), higher intensity 

4x50 yard swims, switch stroke, high intensity 

200 yard swim slow, low intensity 

Try to rest about  30 seconds between 100s, and 20 seconds between 50s. You could then take longer breaks of about 1-2 minutes between the warmup and 100s and between the 100s and 50s"

Swimming is not a sport where an additional few ounces of fat are going to be an issue (within reason, don’t put on 30 pounds of course) since water and fat weight almost the same, so it minimally drags you down. What would be muuuch worse I would say is being unable to properly recover and reenergize because of too little food.

Try doing like 4 50s with 3 fly kicks off each wall (for consistency) and count your strokes. Try to hold a medium-fast pace, like for a 500, and then take as few strokes as possible each 50. It varies some based on height, but for example if I’m doing 4 50s on 1:00, max dust per stroke, I might try to hold like 22-24 strokes per 50, going maybe 28-29 seconds per 50

I mean nothing big, when you started to get tired, your breaths brought your head a bit higher out of the water and made your body position slightly worse.

Swimming,ff94vxn,t3_esc791,1579704903.0,"For breathing, no I wouldn’t say it’s a huge deal at all, but if you decide to try to become a high level sprinter it can be useful. If you’re distance you can breathe every other stroke so long as you can just hold a fast pace, and just swimming for exercise of course you’re all good. If you feel any stiffness or anything though, start breathing bilaterally. However there shouldn’t be any strain to breath, when you breath you should be turning your head with your shoulders, so it’s almost imperceptible.

For cramps, if you’re kicking hard, especially if it’s a newer movement for you, cramps would make sense. Pretty much all the usual recommendations, water and stretch, although I’ve heard bananas can help (maybe the potassium? Maybe I’m full of shit but either way bananas are good I guess lol)

Swimming,ff84zq8,t1_ff825vq,1579666146.0,"Okay, so first things first are you able to boost your yardage a little bit? If not that’s fine, but to build that kind of speed and strength people are generally swimming at least 4-5 times a week maybe 3000 yards minimum. Of course that varies person to person, but generally that’s the lower end of training intensity for people to do a 22.  

From there, it’s all speed work. Absolutely any time you can, practice the hell outa your turns/walls. In a 50 you’re going to want to get as many fly kicks as possible off both walls before you lose speed. Not by making the kicks tiny though, watch Caleb Dressels 50 free, and see if you can emulate how big he kicks while kicking fast at the same time (obviously can’t go as fast as he does, but hey no one else in the world can either hahaha)

In terms of sets, I might do something like:

10x50s on 1:10

8x50s on 1:05
 
6x 50s on 1:00

4x 50s on :55

2x 50s on :50

All fast, all free. If needed take a 100 easy between each round, but try not to rest between the last two rounds. This will work your sprinting, but also puts continuous strain on your muscles for quite a while, so it’ll hurt like hell but ideally help build your strength"

Swimming,ff823k9,t1_ff7zoxj,1579663971.0,"I suppose that’s true, although I’ve had some big meets with no wedges. Certainly not olympic level, but high level. It sounds like it’s getting much more common to have wedges almost everywhere now though, is that right?"
Swimming,ff81y57,t1_ff81s6e,1579663861.0,"Okay so I’m that case it’s all about outright speed. Just so I have a little more info before giving you recommendations, what’s your current yardage per practice and practices per week?"
Swimming,ff7xjk0,t3_es2cgd,1579660724.0,"It’s going to be tough to really train for 500 and 50 at the same time, to be honest, is one a higher priority? Also, just saying, a 22 50 free is a whooooole different level than a 6:00 500, the 500 is a drastically easier goal. 

Do you have an idea of which to go for first? Both at once is possible but a bit tricky"
Swimming,ff7x7qh,t1_ff7vtv9,1579660504.0,"Yeah I think it says a lot, also, that not a single Olympian in any event I’ve seen does a 2 foot forward start. I’m no huge expert, but I feel like that’s a good indication"
Swimming,ff7x0cr,t3_es2bbh,1579660362.0,"Looks good! I might try to keep your head slightly closer to water level when you breathe, and try to place your hands shoulder width apart, right now they’re coming together just a little bit. Your turnover is great though, what’s your 100 fly right now?"
Swimming,ff7wrx0,t1_ff6zisc,1579660204.0,"Yeah I mean it depends hugely on what you’re training for, but it seems like running training is very different from swim training yeah. If I was training for say, 1650, I might warmup and then have a main set of 10x200s, trying to hold a pace about at my mile pace the whole time"
Swimming,ff6uxht,t1_ff6gut0,1579635399.0,"Yeah, I always liked a bannana and granola bars, also my personal policy has always been caffeine for 50/100, none for 200 and up. I was mostly 1000/1650, and I felt like caffeine threw off my pacing so I’d die at around the 700 mark"
Swimming,ff6ubt2,t3_ery95e,1579635044.0,"If you play it back in slow motion you can see that your hips drop as you start your push. If you begin your dive with your hips already there, you can expend more energy on pushing up and out and should be able to get more distance"
