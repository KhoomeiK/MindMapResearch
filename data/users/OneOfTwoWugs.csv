The windows tilt away from the floor, and there's a wooden rail some distance in from the window on which the grandfather was supposedly supporting the toddler's weight (according to the image). The framing of the windows has some depth, too. This article says [there's about 18 inches of space](https://wsbt.com/news/local/royal-caribbean-video-shows-local-man-knew-window-was-open-before-granddaughter-fell) between the railing and the window.

Are we sure he was actually ""dangling"" her out of the window? Without anything under her feet? It's awfully hard to tell in the video, and that comment about the wooden railing makes me suspicious. It looks more like he's trying to lean her forward, towards where the plane of glass would be if the window was actually closed. 

He didn't do a good job defending himself against the tinted window argument by claiming colorblindness, either, but I notice the windows are opened in a repeating pattern. One could (stupidly, but honestly) assume that only some of the windows are tinted as an intentional design, and that all of them are closed.

Does anyone know if the argument that the window design was not up to code holds water?"

TheRightCantMeme,feciw6z,t1_feccn3r,1578975005.0,"In other words, a newborn baby can reproduce: it just takes a (very long) time to achieve the process.

A fetus cannot respirate or consume ""food"" on its own, even if you'll allow that blood flow forced thorough the fetus carrying oxygen and nutrients digested by the mother counts for respiration and the consumption of food, which I don't. It also cannot excrete waste (again, mom's bloodstream, mom's liver and kidneys do all the work) until very late in development. Likewise, it cannot maintain homeostasis on its own. It requires the support of it's mother's body to perform all of those functions, and is effectively no more ""alive"" as an independent biological entity than any organ (or tumor) in the mother's body. 

The key difference is the support of another organism. If the mother dies, the fetus cannot survive on its own. It's the product of a living body, not itself alive until the point it can sustain those criteria for itself, without attachment to another lifeform."

The biggest threat is hyponatremia, or over-diluting the sodium in your body to where cellular communication breaks down. This causes nausea, vomiting, headache, muscle spasms and/or cramps, but not diarrhea. To reach the point of danger, however, you must drink approximately 3 to 4 liters (depending on body size) of water within an hour. This is a very uncommon rate of water intake, and your body has several safeguards to dissuade you from surpassing it, including pain in the stomach and kidneys and a vomit reflex.

Please try to drink at least two liters of water every day, spread across your waking hours, for optimum health. Up to 4 liters is safe and healthy. Just don't chug it all at once."
LifeProTips,fdloa8b,t3_em191s,1578528572.0,"Unless OP literally means several gallons of water per hour, this tip is just wrong. Drinking water throughout the day does NOT cause diarrhea.

Furthermore, not drinking enough water throughout the day taxes your body. By the time your body causes you to feel thirsty, you are already dehydrated: your organs aren't working as well as they should, and your blood has built up a higher load of waste. This can lead to psychological impacts as well, including anxiety, poor coordination, and irritability.

Drink water often to keep your body and mind in top condition. Keep a reusable water bottle with you at all times, and have a sip whenever you happen to glance at it. Drink more if you are in dry conditions or performing strenuous activity, and as much as you can while sick with a cold, flu, or gastrointestinal illness. Water is your body's tool to keep everything in balance, and its ammunition to flush out disease."

EDIT: Wow, this blew up. I really appreciate the awards, and I will pay them forward. 

I think I should explain myself. It wasn't my intention to offend anyone. I'm just mourning the truth: there are millions of us out there who would not be moved to think about immigrants as people just like them without the potential being demonstrated in front of their eyes through actors of their own racial archetype. 

If you are one of the people who *DO* think of others as your equals, regardless of their racial or economic disparity with you, then you are awesome. You also need to know that your instincts are not shared by everyone. Many people, some of which you know well and care deeply about, may not see a person, a family, a child of another skin color or language or religion as worthy of their empathy. This is not usually a logical decision -- ""other person is darker than me, ergo we do not share life experiences"" -- it's more of an omission of recognizing the humanity we share.

When dead Syrian refugees wash up on shore and we see it in the news, our reaction tends to be ""Oh that's terrible, those poor people, glad I'm not in that situation."" That's considered a socially acceptable response.

Our reaction really *should* be ""Oh my god, that weeping man could be me. That could be my son lying there."" We should have a visceral response to do something, to stop the tragedy from happening again, regardless of the national origin, ethnicity, religion, etc. of the victims. That's  the *humane* response, the purely empathetic one. In the structure of the modern world, it is not common. For many people, it takes a demonstration of of their own ""type"" of people to trigger that leap: from ""glad it's not me"" to realizing ""they're just like me""."

Secondly, both your story and this sub always remind me of some wisdom that's gotten me through a lot of shit: ""Hurt people hurt people.""

When somebody feels worthless or discarded, frustrated, confused, struggling, feels like they're getting shit on, taking blame for something they didn't do, their family or the future they've envisioned for themselves is threatened, they are hurt. It doesn't matter if their perception is logical or not; the hurt is real. 

That hurt is a pressure, and if it can't find an outlet, the whole person will fail catastrophically. The hurt on the inside bursts out to become hate on the outside.

Sometimes the hate takes aim at the perceived source of the pain, like mass shooters who murder women because they've been suffering from loneliness and rejection. Sometimes when there is no obvious target to attack, the hate just finds the easiest outlet at hand (a popular politician; a conspiracy; a racial identity; their own children) and constructs an excuse to blame it for everything. 

Hurt becomes hate, hate spreads the hurt.

It took me a long time and a lot of help to learn this. It sounds like you learned it relatively fast, and all on your own.

For what it's worth, you're not a prick. You're a champion. You've beaten the monster, you refused to spread the hurt any farther, and as long as you remember how you did it -- what it felt like, and how you changed -- you have the cure for as many others as you care to save.
