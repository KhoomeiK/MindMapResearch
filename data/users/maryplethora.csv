dogs,fdbhbsn,t3_ekdga5,1578257420.0,"Artie had his first proper play date with our friends' greyhound Murphy today and it went so well! They've been on a couple of walks together before and we took them on one today before letting them loose in the garden. They played so hard and loved it together and were running around like maniacs! Then they completely zonked out on their beds together for the remaining part of our visit, and I love them both so much."
AskAcademia,fd4cn3o,t3_eiqh8b,1578166400.0,"I use OneNote for all my research. I will create a new page for each paper I am reading, title the page with the reference in the correct format in case I end up referencing the paper, and then insert a PDF print-out of the paper. Next to the PDF print-out I will do little notes 'in the margin' and if I have any over-all notes on the paper (""Contains useful description of X concept"" for example) I'll pop them in a text box next to the title.

I probably should also have some sort of spreadsheet (accounting is my field of choice, after all) cataloguing all the papers I've got in OneNote as well, because at this point it is becoming a tad overwhelming for bigger projects, but I have been too lazy to set one up."

• remuneration of key personell

femalefashionadvice,fd1f9k3,t1_fcxjxds,1578130737.0,"Yeah, honestly I am relatively confident as a sewist at this point, but altering clothes terrifies me!

femalefashionadvice,fd1ehgm,t1_fcy37lr,1578130438.0,"I was supposed to go back to work on Thursday and start the worst month of the year. However, I've been down with tonsillitis since the 28th, and my manager was like ""please for the love of God if you don't feel well don't come in"" which is absolutely the right answer. As guilty as I feel for missing a couple of days of the month from hell, we're an open landscape office, and it would be much worse if I went and proceeded to infect multiple people who then ended up missing more days than that. Fingers crossed I'm back on Monday though so I can start tackling all of the shit waiting for me in the office."
dogs,fcyx7fr,t3_ejl1e5,1578089060.0,"I completely relate to this! We've only had Artie for four weeks, but we are working on building a friendship between him and our friends' greyhound. Every time we see them our friends keep gushing about how good he is and if makes my heart so happy.

Tbf, I am sure they are partly doing it for our reassurance (they are about 30 years older than us, and this is their fourth greyhound, while Artie is our first, and they have been so supportive through the entire process), but it doesn't even matter because I need all the reassurance I can get though this new dog anxiety whirlwind."

Funnily enough, less than a week after he came crawling back, and I had the immense pleasure of tell him to promptly fuck off."

- run on average twice per week

- work on establishing an evening routine

- look into masters degrees
- stay on track with exam prep"
AskReddit,fcvq756,t1_fcusgu6,1578007621.0,"My SO is in law enforcements, and while he does love parts of his job (not being stuck behind a desk, feeling like he is making a difference, working with people etc), the thing that has him considering switching careers despite loving it is how jaded it has made him.

He used to be sure he wanted at least a couple of kids, but now because of the stuff he's seen at work (both horrible stuff happening to people, but also kids with actually decent lives and good parents still turning out to be absolute shits) he's not so sure anymore.

We were looking to potentially moving to the city he used to be covering, and I was looking at houses. He'd scroll through the listings I'd send him and for every one there would be a comment like ""Oh a stabbing happened on that block"" or ""I broke up a fight round there"" or ""I was on scene guard by that river when they found a body"". Same thing every time we drive through said city.

To top it off, where he works it is a job with little potential for career advancement (you've got to be promoted to Sargent, but that only happens if a spot opens), and if you don't get promoted the pay is more or less stuck at about £25k per year where we live. Which quite frankly, for the shit they have to deal with, yikes. My SO was bitten by a guy high on coke once when responding to a domestic, he's rescued a girl from a river after she jumped to take her own life, and he's seen plenty of stuff he wouldn't even discuss with me if he could, because it's just too much. I get paid more than that to sit behind a computer all day and do relatively basic stuff in excel. It ain't right.

Not to mention the fact that the public will never be happy with how you do your job, most of them have no idea what is actually going on, and the politicians both blame you for crime stats not improving and cut your budgets in half at the same time."

He's had trouble with his ankle and not been able to walk, so the walks have fallen to me, even though my tonsillitis and I would rather be in bed. I'm just incredibly glad Artie is happy with two twenty minute walks per day and is such a low energy dog!"

Granted, I'm a Norwegian ex-pat, and I've not actually lived there full time for five years now, but when I did literally every girl was dressed in what we referred to as the Norwegian uniform (even though it's exactly what we wore too): black skinny jeans and ankle boots, white t-shirt and long grey chunky knit cardigan.
