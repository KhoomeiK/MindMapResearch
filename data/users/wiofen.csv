AskReddit,fcuuh3p,t3_eivcdu,1577988756.0,In Scotland/the uk we haven’t heard much about it for a while now. The last time I can remember seeing news about the fire was a couple months ago !
Awwducational,fcut3ww,t1_fcu3zv3,1577987969.0,"I have just been informed by my dad that on Isle of Skye that there was winds at approximately 150 mph through a mountain pass in 1989, Although it wasn’t recorded sadly."
Awwducational,fcupesh,t1_fcup1q4,1577985850.0,Yes ! There are quite a lot of wind turbines installed around the highlands. Where I live (in the moors ) there are many wind farms. Although it’s quite a controversy here .

Awwducational,fcu3lr8,t1_fcu0e6w,1577971594.0,"I live in the capital of the highlands and I would say that most of the time it’s not that windy in the lower areas , but if you go out into the higher areas or the mountain ranges then it can get quite windy(as expected). An estimated guess for wind speed  would be around 25mph on a windy day. Hope this helped!"
