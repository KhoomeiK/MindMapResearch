HistoryMemes,ffcfszc,t1_ffcdzf5,1579798529.0,"On the Eastern Front there was certainly an increase of civilian casualties, but that was largely retaliatory.  The Germans spent the better part of 41-43 burning their way through countless villages and cities without taking prisoners, and virtually erasing said places off the map.  By the time the soviets bounced back in their mind they were well within their rights to give them a taste of their own medicine.

That combined with 0 internal comfort aside from the chechen wars would've been a big boone for them."
todayilearned,ff80hh5,t1_ff7zo1l,1579662797.0,"Honestly it very well could've allowed the Soviets and Chinese even greater influence in the World as we know it.

Had we not intervened in South Korea then the North Koreans would've won the conflict, and the entire country would be plunged into darkness under the most oppressive regime in Modern History.  This kept the Chinese in check and pretty much knocked them out of the Cold War when their relations w/ the Soviets soured.

If Vietnam never happens then the North Vietnamese definitely would've taken over the country sooner, but that also means that Ho Chi Minh would've been deposed by his Communist party handlers who would've not only recuperated the country earlier, but would've had a full military to do with as they pleased in South East Asia.  The NVA as a fighting force was one of the largest in the world numbering in the millions.  By the time the US involvement ended they numbered in the tens of thousands which meant they were stuck rebuilding their own country instead of being directed elsewhere.  Plus the heads of state made the mistake of enacting the same policies that Mao did when he took over China and resulted in the country declining over time in its' support of communism.

If America never intervenes in South America then the Russians install their own friendly governments on virtually our doorstep w/o any type of recourse of our own.  Granted these armies anywhere near as armed as us, but a neighbor w/ tens of thousands of armed soldiers can cause a lot of trouble.  Not to mention they would've had a hold on some of the most valuable resources on the planet when it comes to food and minerals.

Of course these are just hypotheticals, but bear in mind much of the action in the Cold War was reactionary/pre-emptive."
todayilearned,ff7z36d,t1_ff7yhki,1579661800.0,"Unfortunately yes.  Publicly the US stated that they encouraged their Allies to cease their colonial efforts, but privately they preferred the powers they knew over a fear of communism.

AskReddit,ff4uje3,t3_ergjyj,1579572773.0,"I worked for about 5 years at a previously will known grocery store chain that has since gone out of business.  If you've never experienced a closing of a big chain Union store here's the general gist.

Since you're Union you'll get about 60 days notice that the store is closing so that you can get your affairs in order.  The first thirty days you'll still be regularly working for the company, and then for the final 30 says you'll technically work for the liquidation company that the individual store got sold to in order to get rid of the remainder of the product let.

Suffice it to say it was both the most liberating and bittersweet moment in my retail career.  Company policy becomes becomes no returns whatsoever, and since you don't work for corporate customers don't actually have anyone to complain to anymore.

During the final month we had one customer come in who brought a flyer for one of our other stores in a whole different part of the state, and insisted we HAD to honor the sales.  I advised this person that we were no longer part of the company, and so the only sales were for clearance.  At which point his wife chimed in repeating her husband's request in a more scared/aggravated tone, and then i repeated the same explanation to her.

Via a combination of my already being bummed that my work friends and i were being forced to go out separate ways and these elderly customers acting as if this specific sale not being available would harm their lives i snapped for the first and only time and just told them it was too bad and they should just go to the other store.

Imagine living such a sheltered life that a sale on canned vegetables is enough to get you to have a prolonged argument you won't win even though the store you're at is on the brink of not even existing anymore."
