raleigh,ff78pkg,t3_ernme4,1579643330.0,This person has so many great photos of Raleigh. If it's not too much trouble when you get a collection it would be nice to have access to a slideshow somehow.

SubredditAdoption,fdsj6yr,t3_emv6ro,1578703780.0,My idea is you have an idea or want to talk to an expert on a topic so you dm them to talk it out. Pretty sure this is a bad idea irl but theoretically sound.

corgi,fd6oyuz,t3_ek6j9g,1578193974.0,"A little off topic but my sister got a poodle pup recently. They were having trouble, like you, understanding it. At Petco/PetSmart/some store they had a book giving the history, how to train, and advice for the breed. Seems to be working pretty good. However, the potty training is taking some time. One thing I learned from dogsitting is you have to have patience with puppies."

Also, I don't want to push religion on you but it's a big factor in my life that keeps me stable. However, if you feel like it check out Joel Osteen too as he's very positive (Christian) and feel free to look into other religions. There has to be something greater out there and I feel from experiences that spiritually I am taken care of and loved for being devout and a good person.

Also just to save you time. It would be a good idea to invest in some essentials.

 I did 
1) A Kiwi cable management system
2) KlearKare largest lenses (trace and cut to fit)
3) HDMI 2.0 extension 
(AmazonBasics High-Speed Male to... https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D5H90L4?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share)
4) USB 3.0 extension
