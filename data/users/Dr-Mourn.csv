AskReddit,few1xxa,t3_eqies2,1579404342.0,"I know I'm late but I have some fun little stories from my old house.

In second grade I had spilled some milk on my clothes and had to go get changed but as I was walking past the couch it felt like I was being pushed into a chair, not hard but like I was slowly floating. I looked back and my mom was at the other side of the room doing work.
I would see shadows in place of things, the one I vividly remember was when I was walking past our green room I saw a black cat, I just thought it was our gray tabby that found some shade and kept walking, but a few steps pass and my cat comes running past me, the opposite way of the green room. So I went back and sure enough what I thought was my cat was two brown boxes stacked ontop of each other. 
The last one I can remember rn and cause this is long enough was when I woke up before my alarm went off and immediately opened my eyes and all I saw was a spider gliding across my view, not touching me or moving just sliding like it was an image being moved."
