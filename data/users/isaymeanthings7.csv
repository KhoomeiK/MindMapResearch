AmItheAsshole,ff7pa91,t3_ervv4n,1579655037.0,NTA but I dont think it's your call if he comes home or not. It's just as much his home as it is yours. You're gonna have to suck it up
AmItheAsshole,ff2haca,t3_er5mf1,1579506091.0,Please. Your husband has an ideal schedule for working. Sounds like hes barley full time. I work full time and take 16 credit hours. NTA

AmItheAsshole,ff2bdtn,t3_er6vpy,1579499562.0,YTA. Honestly if you were a girl itd be fine. Twisted huh? But that's creepy and the girl probably felt you were putting her in an unsafe situation. By first glance it actually looks like your singling her out as a target.
AmItheAsshole,ff27l01,t3_er8apq,1579496100.0,Obviously reported because Shitpost. You're an idiot
AmItheAsshole,fewvz38,t1_fewu71h,1579420346.0,"Pretty much. Most courts will side with the mother no matter what. Trust me, I work in CPS. You have it easy. Quit whining."
AmItheAsshole,fewtu93,t1_fewskin,1579419404.0,"No I mean you literally have no rights. youre a minor. Google it. If your mom decides you have to live with her, you live with her. If she decides you don't get to keep a job you dont keep a job. Yeah isn't it nice that we live in a world where animals have less rights than children? You can't decide shit till you're 18. Quit pretending"
AmItheAsshole,fewsd5h,t1_fews8s1,1579418767.0,You still have no rights. Be lucky you have a place to live you entitled snob.
AmItheAsshole,fewmnqp,t3_eqghxt,1579414862.0,"Sorry hun, you're 16. You have no rights, especially if you aren't paying for your phone."
AmItheAsshole,fewlrlh,t3_eqqx7q,1579413910.0,NTA but that sounds like such a scam that I can almost see why shed be skeptical
AmItheAsshole,fevc33i,t3_eqe970,1579395639.0,You have no say in what your wife wears. YTA. And you sound like a controlling ass
AmItheAsshole,feva8zm,t3_eqlz5q,1579395013.0,NTA but um jeggings?
AmItheAsshole,fev8fvp,t3_eqhc3o,1579394399.0,"ESH its not what she did but the lying. And you not backing her up was a serious parenting fail. However, she did lose her shit a bit too much. Making your daughter's friends leave was acceptable. The way she did it: not okay"
WomensHealth,fec9qte,t1_fe9jfep,1578969179.0,This person wears a double d.they need to wear one
AmItheAsshole,feaxs3n,t3_eo33vy,1578953313.0,YTA um hello? You boil water in it! That means its sterilizeing it! The idea might be a little gross but its perfectly safe and clean.
funnystories,fe69zrt,t3_entvej,1578885116.0,You're an asshole. That poor kid and her father were just minding their own business. You're an immature bitch. Your friend too.
AmItheAsshole,fdtmv44,t3_emrycx,1578719067.0,YTA. I dont know one lactose intolerant person who hasn't dealt with the shits to eat ice cream or cheese or something like that. You definitely could have sucked it up but instead you chose to embarrass her
aww,fdtkzut,t1_fdthq9c,1578718278.0,???
AmItheAsshole,fdtgqdv,t3_emv42p,1578716519.0,NTA but unfortunately  it's not up to you as you're 16 with no rights whatsoever.

AskReddit,fdsdang,t1_fds0m3m,1578700021.0,Hold up now... what?
relationship_advice,fds986i,t3_emrmle,1578697268.0,You should definitely tell her. That's not fair and you should both go to your boss and demand an explanation
relationship_advice,fds90it,t3_emrmle,1578697124.0,You should definitely tell her
relationship_advice,fdmc2ln,t1_fdmbm11,1578545189.0,Usually am but I was serious about this. When you have a spouse die and you have a child you dont get to think of yourself. You put the child first. It seems OP is unable to do this so he needs to get himself in the right mindset
relationship_advice,fdmapgr,t1_fdmaoby,1578544093.0,Nonhe is not. He has a child to care for
relationship_advice,fdm1x5l,t3_em08o5,1578537858.0,"You feel like walking away?! Dude suck it up! Pretty soon you will be a single dad and your child will need you. You dont get to mourn or ""check out"" as you said. You either be there for that child or you do the right thing and give that baby up for adoption"
relationship_advice,fdinhmi,t3_el8mr9,1578446845.0,I seriously doubt this is real...
fivenightsatfreddys,fdhye2z,t3_elb2ba,1578432419.0,Wow that's pretty bad. It doesn't even look like a hook! Jeez man show some respect for the franchise and burn that thing!

AmItheAsshole,fdcnyzy,t3_eknp70,1578279647.0,YTA dogs needs far suppress a mere childs needs
AmItheAsshole,fd437wy,t1_fd42t8x,1578163975.0,Then the parents should have stuff for them. How hard is it to stop at McDonald's? They are literally everywhere
AmItheAsshole,fd3otkc,t1_fd3k8ud,1578160398.0,Or he was doing it on principle. Kids today are too spoiled and catered to. I wouldn't have made him anything else either
AmItheAsshole,fd3hw9g,t1_fd2h4sh,1578158432.0,Why is it on OP to cater to a picky kid. That should be the parents job
AmItheAsshole,fd3cr04,t3_ejwzzu,1578156947.0,"NTA. When I was a kid it was either ""eat what you're served or starve"" it shouldn't be on you to cater to their picky child. If they're that concerned with it they can bring something for they're kid. I would honestly have uninvited them."
relationship_advice,fczyxrd,t3_ejnn5h,1578111035.0,I think you're being hasty and shallow. Why not just give her a chance? You're judging her based on her past and that's not cool.
funnystories,fczdu72,t3_ejo8vf,1578098966.0,Not that funny and formatting is awful
AmItheAsshole,fcyyhtn,t3_ejfavh,1578089887.0,I think you could suck it up for a few hours honestly. Be there for your sister. Maybe compromise that you wear a dress for the ceremony and the pictures but change afterwards. But she is being reasonable and it is her wedding and you already agreed to be a bridesmaid.
relationship_advice,fcsq8tf,t3_eifskv,1577922361.0,"I do think you are responsible, at least for the medical costs due to the pregnancy. But you are under no obligation to be near her for the cysts"

Go watch that"
relationship_advice,fcsp47j,t3_eilhff,1577921557.0,Yes. Remember if you yet married you dont just marry them you marry their family and that family will be in your life through everything. I'd make a clean break now.
relationship_advice,fcsouxy,t3_eila8e,1577921374.0,"Actually humans are not meant to be monogamous. So in a way, yes, cheating is natural. Doesn't make it ok though"
AmItheAsshole,fcmclhj,t1_fcmcimc,1577770557.0,Not sure how that makes a difference because he was planning on leaving. Circumstances just got in the way.
funnystories,fcmag4e,t3_ehx2c7,1577768677.0,Wow. Racially insensitive bitch
AmItheAsshole,fcm8f42,t3_ehqgdm,1577766994.0,NTA and also you should definitely not give this man anything but cans of soup from now on.
AmItheAsshole,fcm7o8a,t3_ehrttw,1577766395.0,Huh that's a tricky one. I'm going with NAH. I understand why your captain wanted only one of you to go and I get why you thought it was more important for your colleague to spend time with her dying relative. I also understand why your wife is mad.

DatingHell,fc9jfyo,t1_fc9eyss,1577553561.0,"You've got hateful comments going back months and hardly any of them have even one upvote. No one agrees with your hatefulness, sweetheart and you aren't bothering anyone with it. You're just wasting your sad, pathetic, little life"
keto,fc6h530,t1_fc6gnxx,1577480458.0,"Yeah dude, you're being overly critical. You dont know this person's tastes or preferences. She had a good burger. That's exciting for her. Let it go."
DatingHell,fc69hwn,t3_egf3sn,1577475367.0,Or she could have laughed it off and not been such a hard ass. Jeez
relationship_advice,fc3upjf,t3_efu7is,1577399112.0,This may get downvoted to hell but have you considered talking to him about opening up your marriage? You obviously still love each other but hes just no fulfilling this one area of your life. Maybe you need someone else for that
keto,fbvjhlv,t3_eebpyr,1577131692.0,Water weight hun. Itll slow down
