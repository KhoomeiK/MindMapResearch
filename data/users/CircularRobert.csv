I would encourage you to find out if you have the opportunity to donate. Knowing that a small action you do every 10 weeks or so has the possibility of saving multiple lives is good for the soul. I'm on 25 donations now, so my best measurable impact is 75 people who are alive because of me. Probably less, but still.

If it's blood transmissible, which I would assume it is (not a doctor), unfortunately not. I am unsure of the mechanics of platelet donation, but that may be an option for you.

Best bet would be for you to Google for a blood donation centre close to you, and give them a call and explain your situation/autoimmune disease. They should be able to give more accurate information, and you don't need to share who you are(depending on the stigma against your condition in your country, this will make your life easier).

For some information(in my country at least), the first donation is always kept by the centre, and a full spectrum of tests are done. This is ironically how many people find out that they have HIV or other similar blood/body fluid transmitted diseases, and the centres let you know if anything is not normal.

After the second donation, they take your blood and split it into three parts, platelets, plasma, and the other one :P, which each go to different parts of the medical system where they are most necessary."
todayilearned,feh5m4v,t1_feh46nc,1579109628.0,"Unfortunately they use call centres here, but I know if I get a call from a certain city code, about 2 months since I've donated, I can pick up the phone and say ""Yes, I know, thank you, I'll go as soon as I get the time, thanks, okay bye"", and hang up immediately"

To clarify, I'm from South Africa, so I can only speak from my perspective. I think in America there are blood banks that pay for blood, but the health system there is fucked, so that's another story.

I will assume you mean refused to donate/stopped donating, given the context.

Here, they will call you and ask you to come, as well as the sms messages, but if you ask them to stop, they will. There are often times campaigns on radio and billboards urging people to go donate, so there's a reasonable flow of new people, but obviously never enough. They have some incentives as well, where with each milestone you get a small gift, with major milestones with bigger gifts. They also create a sense of a citizens obligation as well as a moral obligation to donate when you can.

Unfortunately in our country, poverty is still a pressing issue, so creating a financial incentive for poor people to place their health at risk will not be allowed. These for profit donor centres would have to be monitored carefully, and frankly, our country has a shit record when it comes to ethics policing, so the whole problem is avoided. The for profit model could work in other countries, effectively, but for me it's on par with selling kidneys or other organs on a legal marketplace.
