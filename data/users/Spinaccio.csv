As a former NRA member, and member of an (historic) militia, I can’t get behind civilians owning such dangerous weapons- dangerous because the likelihood of misuse far outweighs the likelihood of helping save our democracy.  The work of keeping our country strong is at the ballot booth, PTA meetings, and engaging with our communities.  If you feel the need to make your point with a weapon, you’ve already lost the debate.  Deer rifle in a rural town?  Of course.  Auto loader shotgun in a city?  Not near my people, the cops are paid and trained to protect us, you’re just making my world a lot less safe.

TLDR:  all anyone who wants limits or regulation to ownership of firearms is asking for is the ability to feel safe."

The federal law against seditious conspiracy can be found in Title 18 of the U.S. Code (which includes treason, rebellion, and similar offenses), specifically 18 U.S.C. § 2384. According to the statutory definition of sedition, it is a crime for two or more people within the jurisdiction of the United States:

To conspire to overthrow or destroy by force the government of the United States or to level war against them;
To oppose by force the authority of the United States government; to prevent, hinder, or delay by force the execution of any law of the United States; or
To take, seize, or possess by force any property of the United States contrary to the authority thereof. 

People like Alex Jones need to start going to jail."

US industry was still geared up from wartime production and largely untouched by the war, while most other countries’ industries were still reeling, so the world market for US products was huge.  The result was, arguably, a quality difference where American products were superior in some fields.  This difference faded, but industry and labor both had an interest in keeping up the image of products “made in America” being superior."
