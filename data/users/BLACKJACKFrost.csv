AskReddit,fckbsky,t1_fcjydz2,1577721771.0,"That's very weird, because a quick Google of ""melatonin side effects"" comes up with headaches as the number one side effect on both WebMD and MayoClinic.

This is [WebMD’s entry on melatonin side effects](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-940/melatonin):

>	Melatonin has been used safely for up to 2 years in some people. However, it can cause some side effects including headache, short-term feelings of depression, daytime sleepiness, dizziness, stomach cramps, and irritability. Do not drive or use machinery for four to five hours after taking melatonin.

Here's [MayoClinic’s entry on melatonin side effects](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/expert-answers/melatonin-side-effects/faq-20057874):

>	The most common melatonin side effects include:

>-Headache

>-Dizziness

>-Nausea

>-Drowsiness

>Other, less common melatonin side effects might include short-lasting feelings of depression, mild tremor, mild anxiety, abdominal cramps, irritability, reduced alertness, confusion or disorientation, and abnormally low blood pressure (hypotension). Because melatonin can cause daytime drowsiness, don’t drive or use machinery within five hours of taking the supplement.

What did you find? Because headaches are listed as the number one side effect of melatonin on every single one of the most reputable medical information sites. I couldn't even stand up for over 24 hours the one time I took it, I was confined to a dark room, whimpering and crying like a baby for hours. It was ugly.

Edit: it's very well possible that long term use of melatonin may give relief for migraines in some, though in my non-medical-professional-experience I endured the worst migraine I'd ever felt in my entire life that literally made me want to shoot myself in the head just to make the pain stop for over 24 hours. Apparently I'm not the only one who experienced the headaches coupled with short-term depression, so I was just sharing a word of caution on the subject."
