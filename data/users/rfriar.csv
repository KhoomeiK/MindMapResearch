facepalm,fgp5fdl,t1_fgp4yvo,1580997309.0,"Sure, if you only use the surface level of the scene. Lisa is a good character who tries to do the best she can and be the best she can be, so she wouldn’t do something like this without a reason. You’re disregarding it without thought, but whatever. ~~The right~~  Most older people can’t really meme."

JurassicPark,ffyfrh4,t1_ffyc15e,1580345363.0,Because the people often unofficially responsible for disseminating information don’t research. They don’t read. The people that follow the influencers then take what they’re told and run with it. I hate the internet sometimes for that reason.

TopMindsOfReddit,ff4zy86,t1_ff4gcyq,1579576548.0,"The Republican Party of today:

I never understood the desire to buy multiple cars or a mansion or a yacht (though I’m terrified of the ocean, so biased), or other ludicrously expensive things. Just seems stupid to me. Whether it be taxes, charity, or both, wealth should be put to good use. Your brother and people like him make no sense whatsoever regarding money."
