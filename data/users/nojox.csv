I can't even talk and think with articulation when the television is on high volume. 

My coping mechanisms: Ear buds, noise cancelling headphones, hiding in my own room, going out for walks when there are no crowds and no traffic. If people yell at me, if I can I just say that they have to speak softly or I will ignore them and walk away. I make it a point to come back later and ask repeating that they should not yell.

As a layman, this is the most important fact to me in this case.

I've worked with dogs (volunteering) and rabies is ""100% fatal"" apparently, but the virus is so weak that it doesn't survive for much time on the skin and only causes an infection if you have deep blood wounds from an infected bite, which you have not washed immediately.

SeriousConversation,ff9gd11,t3_es8kbg,1579712429.0,"In addition to the excellent advice that everyone else is giving, I would like to add my own opinion.

I'm a 43 yr old single ace man, so everything I say should be weighed keeping that in mind. Also, this is generic, not specific to you, so take what is relevant and ignore that which is not.

I think a lot of young people, whether in my youth or now, confuse infatuation with love.

Infatuation is hormone-driven attraction, based on preferences of looks, bodily aspects, and some aspects of personality (outer social traits that can be copied or changed easily). It is mainly desire and and is very forceful. Evolutionarily, its function is to make well matched humans ready to mate, by starting the pre-mating rituals which we commonly call courtship.

Love, OTOH, is a thoughtful decision made after knowing a person for quite some time, and focussing on their character (inner belief system, habits, upbringing, genetics) and  made despite knowing their flaws and their unpleasant attributes or qualities.

Desire is outward, restless, novelty-powered, while love is inward, restful, peaceful, and powered by security and familiarity.

Some people are good at social skills required to convert the object of infatuation / desire into the object of their love / commitment, while some are not. Some people are good at reading such signals while others are not.

Given all this, it is more logical to expect misunderstanding and miscommunication by default, rather than understanding. (This is not to hint that you should try again. Far from it.)

Glorification of infatuation and confusing it with love, something our culture promotes, leads people to start and pursue relationships with the wrong people at the wrong speed (often faster than should be) and in the wrong situation.

I would expect that some percentage of the youth or some section of the media would promote the idea that you should first get to know the person you are infatuated with or attracted to for some time as a friend and then when you are sure that the inside is as compatible as the outside appears attractive, then, proceed to the next step - a relationship.

But sadly, this old system of slow, studied dating is replaced by swipe culture. Someone recently discussed with me about how the incredible choice available today due to technology is breaking down the old tried system of familiarity, friendship and courtship, and replacing it with what amounts to rejection tests and outright lying to pass said rejection tests (Profiles on social media and dating apps). This influences everyone, including the person you are attracted to / infatuated with.

Making an emotional investment, in such times, is therefore an even more nuanced business and therefore demands more skill in studying a person's character. 

It is important to remember that the majority of people become fat and unattractive by 35 if they don't take care of their bodies and familiarity anyway robs the lure of attraction that was initially very strong. Therefore completely ignoring appearance and personality and rather focussing on values and character is a great idea in seeking a mate for a long term relationship.

Given that you personally, put your heart and soul into the object of your affection, it stands to reason that you will feel more pain when you make the wrong choice or when the right choice does not work out. 

Therefore, _you must go much slower than others_, because you cannot shake off a mistaken match as easily as others can.

Coming back to generics, one strategy worth considering is to give more importance to the one who fancies you, rather than the one you fancy. If you reciprocate to the one who fancies you (for the right reasons of course), it is likely that you will get a lot more emotional feedback and soul food from them rather from someone who you fancy but does not fancy you.

Even here there can be miscommunication and mistakes, so it is always a great strategy to go slow and invest small amounts, conditionally and slowly.

If you want 100% guaranteed emotional reciprocation and attention, with no chance of rejection, betrayal or disappointment, then you should skip the biological attraction entirely and invest in a dog as a pet. 10/10 assured ROI. Serious. Not joking.

In general, outside of dogs, I would suggest to make a lot of friends, from both genders and ask everyone to go slow with you and sort of make it known that you prefer to go slow, and then, when the restless desire driven types have banged their heads on the wrong walls sufficiently, the one like you who wants to go slow and sure will reveal himself by virtue of being the one guy who hasn't banged his head around or broken hearts everywhere. Subject to all other tests mentioned above, that should be your guy.

Again, I've not dated, so YMMV."

There are needs (food, clothing, shelter, security, happiness, etc), wants (Tesla Model S, weekly fine dining, art collection, etc), and desires (next bill gates, famous inventor, die on mars, etc). Desires will mostly never get fulfilled, wants might get fulfilled if you want reasonably, and if your needs are not fulfilled, you should be allowed to complain, internally and even to the government in your country.

Desires can be changing, random and flawed. Some can be dangerous and unrealistic. Wants are more to do with comparison, competition and social status, and are only superficially important. 

The problem arises when yours wants and desires are elevated to the status of needs. That is the perfect formula for unhappiness, by definition. See this:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB79PlkJJHg

Anxietyhelp,ff6ssra,t3_erxipj,1579634142.0,"As far as I can figure out, this is a panic attack. Normal panic attacks have common everyday fears, but I think you're a thinker or you've watched too many science fiction or ""existential doubt"" / plot twist shows which make existential doubt or complete uncertainty about everything as the basis of your fears.

The first thing to note is that this not unique, most panic attack survivors feel the same existential dread, whatever their trigger, and some of us who really think a lot early in life, and who get panic attacks face this.

In short, this is not new, rare, dangerous or real. What it is, is very, very, really, really scary. It feels as though your next thought will bring a dangerous revelation or massive shock and you are not sure of how you will think, how time will pass, how the world will play out and so on.

_But you have to recognise the primary component of this condition - fear._

----

Then read this and even though you might not be convinced today that it is true, you will find that it is exactly what is happening: https://np.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/egzwoq/feelings_of_impending_doom/fccjgsq/

For people with everyday triggers, the element of self-doubt and all-consuming doubt is absent, so they can see more clearly that it is pure, unadulterated fear. But you might not be able to recognise it as such easily because of the massive amount of doubt about everything.

So, some facts I can promise you, will bear out in the days to come:

You will not disintegrate, get destroyed, die, be shocked with some great revelation or any of that stuff. Tomorrow will be the same as today and yesterday, and you will see that apart from fear and doubt, neither has the world changed, nor have people changed, nor has anything else, like science, economics, politics, music, animals, nature or anything else changed.

There will be no revelation, no shocking truth and no surprises. Life will go on.

At the most, due to extreme panic, you will get severe nerve pain, and you may faint for a few minutes and experience dizziness or feel the world physically turning upside down - which is a case of vertigo.

Second,

As soon as you approach a qualified psychologist or other qualified medical practitioner who can prescribe medicines, they will give you something like Klonopin which will make you a bit drowsy, but will take away 50-75% of the severe symptoms.

Then what will remain is brain stem spasms, neck spasms, headaches, muscle pain, etc. if no other painkillers are also prescribed.

Within a week of starting and continuing this medication, and **provided you stop thinking**, you will get back to a sane, normal state.

But you have to make one small effort - whenever your mind puts a basic question to you - are you real? is the world real? will some entity attack you? will you be disintegrated into the universe? will the universe cease to exist? will the world vanish? can your mere thinking make the world vanish? etc etc, at such times,

however pressing and urgent it may seem to investigate such questions, _flatly refuse to entertain them._ 

_Ignore them. Purposefully and deliberately._

_At first you will need to go against your intuition to ignore them._

If ignoring is difficult, which is likely, simply start singing a simple melody - even a children's nursery rhyme will work, or counting to 100 or 1000 as you feel best. And repeat the counting. While doing this breathe slowly and focus on the breath entering and leaving your nostrils. Maybe even touch the tip of your nose with one finger to keep your focus there. It's boring, it makes no sense, your mind may scream that you are in grave danger if you do not tackle and solve the existential doubt that you just had. _But this shouting and screaming mind is precisely what you have to not engage, to side-step._

What has happened is that your animal mind (limbic system / sympathetic nervous system) has declared a state of life-and-death emergency and is pumping fear juices as well as adrenaline into your blood constantly preapring you for a continuous fight. These signals are picked up by your human thinking brain and multiplied with imagination and existential doubt - i.e. questioning the validity of everything your mind perceives. You are fundamentally not sure of any perception.

When this goes to an even higher extreme, you might activate your reptilian mind which basically freezes in panic, like a common house lizard freezes when it sees motion around it.

All these responses are common in panic disorder and they can be easily tuned down, controlled and then eliminated after some time (weeks to months)

As first aid, see this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Un_Ykh9y9Q
It says that what you experience is the paranoid fight or flight response and that the symptoms are exactly that - symptoms - and as such they are not danger. Symptoms are not dangerous. The thing that you think is dangerous is actually only imaginary. It's only in your head. It's not in the heads of people immediately around you - whether family, friends or coworkers.

Nobody else is scared like you not because they do not see what you see, but because they don't have those massive fear juices and adrenaline rushing through your system non-stop. They don't have the disorder and you have it. There is no knowledge you have or thinking you do that makes you know anything more than all the psychologists and scientists of the world, and the world is not really changing that fast. In fact it isn't changing at all. You're experiencing a hyper-magnified sensationalised version of ordinary reality.

So, 

sing a song or listen to music

or count to 100 or 1000  and breathe slowly while doing so, focussing on your nose (touch it with one finger)

and ignore the doubt by forcibly looking away and looking up and around

and remember, science has all the answers, and you don't need to answer all the questions right now. You can wait a week or a month and get all the answers you need.

I've been there, as have almost half the guys on this sub and on r/anxiety and I can tell you nothing dangerous happened to me or them due to the panic attack itself. _The symptoms are just symptoms, they are not dangerous._

See this video to understand the disorder: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYJdekjiAog

Also, first get medication to tackle the hypervigilant state - see a psychologist or even a GP / doctor who can prescribe Klonopin or similar panic disorder medication. You should start feeling normal in about 1-2 days. Do not stop the medication for at least 2-3 months, most likely the medication in lower and lower doses will be needed for a year or more. But that's a thing that will definitely return your sanity and normalcy.

All this will return to normal. I promise you. As long as you see the doctor and take the medicines and practise the recovery techniques you will be back to normal daily functioning within a few weeks.

This goes away easily. Many of us have experienced this and the first episode is always the big shocker. Later ones get handled much more easily.

The part of aging is probably the death of the enthusiasm of youth where you believe that you can do literally anything and change the world. By 40 you realise you cannot change the world, but depending on how you did in those years from 20-40 you think you can change some things for some people. At the very least you can have fun for yourself or achieve some goals (which is what most people do - get richer, educate their kids, become important, give back to community, etc)"

CasualConversation,feot0ji,t1_fene7qv,1579304976.0,"The thing is also that there are a lot of people willing to do that work part time (or full time) hence the large number of dedicated nurses and doctors. But the skill is the really hard part. Not everyone knows what to say and has the calm, the nerve and the compassion.

It's a very unique combination. If you're gentle and compassionate, you cannot take the risk of failure leading to a person potentially committing suicide. If you're strong enough to brush aside the consequences of failure, you cannot be that gentle. Every word and every thought makes a difference because the person can hang up at any time, leaving you wondering and scanning the next day's papers. All that apart, you have to have genuine sincerity and also an ability to lie convincingly to someone who is dealt a great amount of misfortune and is very cynical about everything, and still give them a positive thing to hang on to. You need good diplomacy and lightning fast emotional intellignce to understand what emotions are at what levels just from the tone, voice and words, because you cannot see them. And you have to respect normal boundaries while discussing potential positive outcomes in sensitive topics.

Being compassionate is not the half of it. The rest of it is the difficult part. Not every caller will actually attempt suicide and not every attempt will succeed, but you can't tell which is which easily.

It's a gift, in some sense."

For most of civilised human history, you knew a girl / guy for some time, became friends, got to know them, their family, etc and then you became a couple and then got engaged and married. Of course there were flings, but flings weren't the starting point. They were exercises in pure desire and exploration outside a normal relationship. It's just the last 100 years or less that casual sex is the first step and then everything else follows. 

The sudden escalation from stranger to ""passionate about him"" and the corresponding sudden drop from ""perfect, we clicked, had great sex"" to ""doesn't even pick up my phone calls"", both are not what human beings have been training the brain on for millenia.

Hence, the problem."
