offmychest,ff2vsus,t3_eqzsyf,1579526068.0,"Ugh tell me about it. I've had a large overbite for all my life. Before i got braces, it was so big, my thumb fit between each set of teeth, and I had major jaw pain. Pair that with big top front teeth, and i got all kinds of made fun of. I got called a beaver sometimes, a couple people would put pen caps on their front teeth and say it was me. I'm sure people said even more behind my back, but it was rough, and generally, people thought I was ugly. I lost so much self confidence, and I still struggle with self esteem problems, even though I am doing better.

Even now, I always cover my mouth when I smile or laugh, but that doesn't prevent anyone from seeing it. In resting position, my mouth is open, and it seriously takes effort to close it fully in any comfortable way. It really sucks, and honestly, fuck anyone who's done shit like that. I hope they know that they cut someone's sense of self-worth so deeply that it affects them into adulthood.

Edit: another thing I was mocked for was that I have small tits, I was pretty much flat while all my friends weren't. I had one girl in particular who would always mention it, how I looked like a plank of wood, or when I'd say anything about my boobs, they'd say ""what boobs?"" Every fucking time. It got so old so fast, but I just started to crack my own jokes and they stopped. I also got left out of things or embarrassed because my I didn't even have my period until after freshman year.

Luckily, I now have friends who couldn't give a shit about my reproductive organs. I'm much happier with the people I've surrounded myself with recently."

offmychest,fe5qwrh,t3_enrwa2,1578873252.0,"Totally get it. A few months ago, I went through a whole horrible situation. 

Long story short, my best friend of 5 years ignored me for 2 weeks then cut me off as much as she could. She never said sorry, and i thought she didn't care about what happened at all. Her exact words were ""I just don't enjoy hanging out with you anymore."" I found out very recently that she had actually sobbed when she told somebody else all this, she just never showed me that any of it mattered to her.

 After the fact, i have trouble trusting people, but I've surrounded myself with a much better group of friends, and I don't feel like I'm walking on eggshells around them"

But at home, Im scared to come out as a lesbian, and sometimes i have to catch myself saying certain things, and im afraid one day I'll actually out myself"

She's had a long journey, and she's still very skinny, since shes still battling it. I think if people in my family were to tell her that she was too skinny, that would hurt even more, and to be told that again and again and again just breaks you down. It's just as bad either way"
