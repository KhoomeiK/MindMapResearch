So I ended up with ""gods"" based on Egyptian ones, a pharaohesque leader, stories taken direct from mythology, then twisted to fit a world with technology beyond ours. I also created a language for it that had some influence from what little I could pull up and understand about Ancient Egyptian, among others. and the main building in the centre of the colony is basically a tall, thin pyramid. I call it The Spire [koríkenn in the language]."
