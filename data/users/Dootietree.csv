videos,ff36i76,t1_ff2uxxr,1579534852.0,That's crazy. I remember loving cadbury eggs as a kid. I had one as an adult and thought I had just aged out of liking it. It was noticeably different.
AskReddit,feywdop,t1_feytmze,1579451312.0,"Fair point. I'd offer that sustainability, recyclability (is that a word?), consumer mentality...these are all choices - as a rebuttal. I should have elaborated more initially. There aren't too many people on earth, we just make bad choices. If we collectively decided to pool human potential, the earth has plenty of resources and space to sustain way more people than are currently living."
AskReddit,fey8feq,t1_fexulpp,1579442036.0,"There's not really too many people. There's plenty of resources and space for the current population. As a species we just don't work well together....so I guess to your point, the more people there are, the less likely they are to get along : /"

todayilearned,fdx5x5h,t1_fdwnrws,1578765608.0,"Is there a good range for fiber? I eat a bowl of steel cut oats with almond, cashew, or peanut butter with pumpkin seeds. I need to be better about vegetables. Typically I'll make a smoothie with spinach or kale (I try to rotate), carrots, banana, blueberries, flax seeds and sometimes lentil powder. I need to eat more veggies though for sure and more variety."

todayilearned,fdvwscc,t1_fdvwi8c,1578752565.0,Well dang. Do you mean cereal as in processed? The oats I eat are just steel cut oats. I usually mix in a nut butter of some kind and pumpkin seeds.
todayilearned,fdvviqi,t1_fdvrjf9,1578751997.0,I eat a big bowl of steel cut oats 6 out of 7 mornings. I'm also trying to eat a lot of beans/lentils now. Without TMI...I notice the difference. I just get paranoid eating the same thing over and over. I guess I need to mix the grains up for variety.
todayilearned,fdvn1e8,t1_fdvelks,1578749263.0,"Are there other known foods that encourage good bacteria? I've read conflicting stuff about straight up probiptic, mainly that we don't know what specific strains would benefit a person and the dose needs to be extremely high. The only one I remember having evidence of efficacy was a prescription one for IBS. Although I guess efficacy is hard to show if it keeps you healthy."

QualityAssurance,fcgj6n5,t1_fcg27nf,1577640679.0,"I really appreciate your detailed response. I bought the book you recommended to try and get a feel for where we are at. Honestly our QA team is inexperienced but...we get it done if that makes sense. It just feels like we are immature to me. I read this subreddit and so many terms are tossed around that we don't use and from context I can tell are sorta foundational ideas. I'm in a position to improve things but honestly this is all new to me...I'm from a different industry altogether, not software development. I'd like to learn though!"
QualityAssurance,fcfalj8,t1_fcdzch5,1577628083.0,"About your statement on less bugs and quicker testing - could you elaborate? What is the benefit then? I'm trying to become familiar with best practises and work for a company that has a sort of unusual QA role in that it's more like a BA, PM (We have dedicated PM but QA shares some of the burden, client communication...etc), and QA combined.  We have an eye towards automation but currently it's one person that is attempting regression and any requests from manual QA"
tennis,fcbmnyv,t1_fc7ui5s,1577588620.0,Not a big tennis fan but I re-watched this a few times. What really impressed me about it was after the final return Nadal was basically in position to handle anything that was sent back.
