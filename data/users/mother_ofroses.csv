DoesAnybodyElse,ffjob0h,t3_etuwmh,1580002888.0,"I used to open the door any time someone knocked. But around six months ago I was home alone, husband at work, and I got a knock on the door. I opened it and it was an older man, maybe late 40s, saying he was my neighbor from down the road asking if he could use my phone to call his friend because he had a flat tire. I got a weird/creepy feeling from him so I told him my phone was charging because it had just died, thinking he’d just say okay and leave. Instead he asks if anyone was home that could help him, like a husband or boyfriend. I told him no, thinking that was a really really weird question and tried to shut the door. He stuck his foot in between it so I couldn’t shut it and he tried to pry to door open. Without thinking, I shoved the door open as hard as I could, throwing him off balance just long enough for me to shut and lock and deadbolt my door. I hid in my room and called my uncle because he only lives about two minutes away, then called the police. Uncle gets there and then the police, I tell them what happened and give a description of the guy, and that was the last of it. I don’t even want to think about what would have happened if he had gotten in. So no. Never again will I open my door if I’m not expecting someone."

cats,ff0yb3n,t3_er0kyu,1579473444.0,My cat loves water and running water so much that one time she heard my husband using the bathroom and ran in there and jumped on the toilet only to fall in and get peed on.
internetparents,fetab2e,t3_eqejg3,1579373271.0,"I was in a situation very similar to this.. My brother has always been the favorite too, because he’s so god damn charming. I just don’t ever talk to him. He joined the Navy and moved away so I don’t really ever see him anymore. He didn’t even come home for the holidays. It’s relieving not to have to deal with him anymore."
