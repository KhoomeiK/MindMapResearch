hetalia,fe1vape,t3_enjbn6,1578831241.0,"I think Jerry Jewell ( Va for Russia) might have signed this, I saw on their website that he was a guest as well as Michael Sinterniklaas ( Va for Netherlands) and Aron Dismuke ( Va for Cyprus). This is just a guess tho,  maybe someone else can recognize the signatures or you can try some research 😅"
hetalia,fe1retn,t1_fdzroo9,1578830036.0,Yep! It's 100% finished.
hetalia,fdzmers,t3_endg74,1578791682.0,"Ohh I really enjoyed Escape from Siberia but sadly it's not finished. It's a bit more challenging and longer than most HetaGames but I liked it! House of winter is also very nice, it's also made by the creator of Dreamtalia. It's short and more story focused, it's the first game I played where micro nations are main characters 😊."

It was more of a jab at their government who isn't doing anything to help (basically saying it's fine). Although I do agree with your post, sometimes I forget Hetalia is light-hearted 😄"

fatlogic,fcxktbt,t3_ejgni9,1578065362.0,"Soo I have this weird thing going on. Two weeks ago I weighted myself at 57,4kg (started at about 58-60kg) and then I  weighted myself yesterday and the scale says 52,7kg? I only cut out breakfast and stopped eating sweets when I was feeling bored + light excercise every day. My goal weight is 55kg but I have no idea how I could accidentally lose more than I wanted? Anyone else has this problem?"
