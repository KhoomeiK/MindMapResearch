Of course you wouldn’t see the majority that can’t afford it, because they wouldn’t be travelling to you.

And like all rich minorities, they’re probably not as nice as the regular people below them, Chinese people that aren’t super rich tourists tend to be much nicer people."

I am however interested in how the hell this managed to happen."
modernwarfare,ffddyzr,t1_ffcvyl0,1579818871.0,"I mean in all honesty, how do you predict that 1 in a million people are gonna have this one specific gun split in half, it’s not like their play test pool has a million people in it.
