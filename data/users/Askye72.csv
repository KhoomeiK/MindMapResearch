theLword,fe0jmfv,t3_emm75j,1578814489.0,"I could standing listening to it the first couple of episodes but ended up muting or fast forwarding for the rest! It's just too whiny and off key, and really doesn't represent the women in the show whatsoever, I don't see any of the characters liking that song lol"
cats,fdyozbq,t1_fdyn38g,1578782128.0,"This was years ago, I'm not as upset now as I was, I'm more worried for Loki, because even though he looked healthy, I can't determine if he has a home and I haven't been able to trap him :("
cats,fdyl59c,t1_fdyj2kv,1578780969.0,"When I first discovered that it was him, I tried, they weren't nasty about wanting to keep them, they just tried convincing me it was a female and they've had it for years (you can see his balls lol) but one of their kids told me later that yes they found him and brought him home around the same time mine went missing, but she was so upset and worried that she'd lose her new kitty, so I'm leaving it be. I'm sure her parents lied because they didn't want their kids upset after falling in love with him. They take good care of him, and by this point there'd be a cat brawl with the 2 I still have lol"

cats,fdtrh8x,t3_en1vnn,1578721053.0,"My kitty boys ran off 4yrs ago, I saw Loki last winter meowing like crazy in the snow and tried to get him inside, he loved the pets, but wouldn't come near my cat (their mom). And my orange Ralphie, I'm pretty sure neighbors a few streets over, took him in...I know it's him, with a pink collar, but there is no reasoning with the new found owners but at least he's alive and being taken care of. So glad your kitty made it home!"

CatAdvice,fdtouls,t3_emzgmm,1578719921.0,"I also had a long lived childhood cat, she lived to be 20 and drooled her whole life, so that was definitely gtosser near the end, old stinky breath and all!  The cats my parents have now are currently 16 and 18ish? and still are very active! The older one is grumpy about her pets, and doesn't clean her self a whole lot, BUT they both still have very healthy shiny coats, as did my 20yr old cleo. And they all have been indoor/outdoor cats. The only similarity in them all having very little health issues and healthy fur is seriously Science Diet, not trying to sell a product here, I can't afford that for my own cats! Mine do not shine with whatever mid-grade cat food I can afford lol, but I do believe that that food has some spectacular qualities to it as far as a healthy diet goes. I'm sure it is very different for every cat or animal though, but for most, grooming is an important part of their daily routines, so if your cat is still taking part in this, I'm sure there is a few more enjoyable/ish years (I just mean, at that age, they are probably not the happiest and healthiest they have ever felt, but they're hanging in there, and they won't be going anytime soon unless they develop an illness of some sort)"

PennyDreadful,fdg90f9,t1_f2v7dmb,1578385182.0,"I could have sworn that he got hit by a carriage in the earlier episodes, but I just may be Mandela effecting myself?? I honestly don't remember him being brought back to life, but I could have sworn he got ran over, head split open, and Frankenstein was like yeasss prime subject here! Anyone else remember ANYTHING like that? Easy enough to go back and watch the first few episodes,  which I must do, but I'm in the thrall of finishing season 3 right now, I can't turn away!"
