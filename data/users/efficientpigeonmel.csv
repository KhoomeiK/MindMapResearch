humor,ffe916k,t3_est7sx,1579840027.0,I work for an event that hosted Gus this past summer. He has a small enough audience that he was able to walk around the venue without being bothered. He spent quite a while drawing offensive caricatures of other attendees. Hands down one of the funniest things I've seen.
dogs,ffb85rg,t3_esd28e,1579754634.0,"Our Aussie us probably 8 or so and I just heard him howl for the first time. We have a wolf dog who is super vocal. I came home for lunch and our Wolfie boy got very excited and howled. Out of nowhere, our Aussie boy started too. It was quite precious."
MadeMeSmile,ff8a0nx,t3_es00cm,1579670464.0,"We got new locks with codes and I (a mildly but not super handy girl in her 20s) was able to install, program, and rekey them in about 15 minutes thanks to this absolute angel on YouTube. I almost didn't buy them because of how many reviews said they were hard to install."
AskReddit,ff66nfg,t3_ero8mj,1579620403.0,"Honestly she'd be proud as fuck. The last couple years have been really solid. I graduated college, got a job, got engaged, bought a house, and started basically my dream career. I think 13 year old me would be relieved to know that I did end up finding my way eventually."
WitchesVsPatriarchy,ff2g0gv,t1_ff2eku8,1579504544.0,Oh godddd this is just the best.
WitchesVsPatriarchy,ff21gx2,t3_er2xpl,1579491250.0,"I can't help but wonder how much better the world would be if boys were all raised by someone like my dad. When I was 15, I quit dance after literally 10 years because my period was so bad and they wouldn't let us wear underwear under our costumes when we performed/competed. I went to his house to hide because I was so upset. He came and helped me when I woke up screaming because I had an ulcer from taking too much ibproufen for cramp pain. And then promptly discussed putting me on birth control with my mother so that I could have a normal life with normal hobbies.

It baffles me how some men literally never learn that kind of empathy. You don't have to know what it feels like, you just have to be empathetic."
ADHD,fewggt3,t3_eqle4o,1579410176.0,"Hi my dear, 26 year old with ADD here. I'm so sorry to hear you're going through this. I struggled for years and didn't seem help or medication until I was 23 because even though it very much runs in my family, my mother was pretty dismissive when it came to any type of mental illness. Here's what I can tell you:

You have a responsibility to yourself to take care of yourself, even if your parents don't understand that. Please talk to another adult in your life who you trust like a school counselor, teacher, or your doctor. Possibly consider having someone like a school nurse hold onto your meds and administer your daily dose.

That being said, please don't rely too heavily on medication. It can help but ultimately it's a good tool to help in developing other healthy habits that can make a big difference. If for some reason you are unable to take your meds, communicate with others to help them understand why you may be struggling, and learn to fall back on other things that you've found to help you concentrate. 

Last thing, please don't buy other people's meds. Dosages are very different depending on what type of medication it is, and you can have seriously bad reactions. Having been prescribed three different types, I can tell you that two have seriously affected my health. 

But please please go get help. You should never feel guilty for your ADHD and even though your parents may not understand your condition, this is still abusive behavior that shouldn't be tolerated."
AskReddit,fewcm4t,t3_eqouu3,1579408419.0,"My name is Mel. Once my fiance called me ""efficient"" as I was drunkenly rolling across the floor to grab something instead of getting up. I thought he called me a pigeon. I have since been nickednamed the Efficient Pigeon."
AskReddit,few3vj9,t3_eqfgfg,1579404977.0,Annihilation. The choreography at the end was so ridiculously beautiful. The whole film was horrifying and beautiful all at the same time. I didn't even know how to proceed it.
dogs,few0h1f,t3_eqpoak,1579403715.0,We had a bowl of nuts (in shells) with a nutcracker on the table at my old house. The walnuts started vanishing. I finally found out my roommate's tiny pomchi was stealing them and stuffing them in the couch. Finally catching him was one of the funniest things I've ever seen.
dogs,fevy46x,t1_fevnr84,1579403009.0,My dog has also consumed an entire stick of butter. Didn't bother his stomach one bit but... Why. Just why.
dogs,fevxomj,t3_eqohkm,1579402823.0,"Once a long time ago when I lived with irresponsible roommates, my dog ate a pot brownie that was wrapped in tin foil. We had no idea why he was acting so weird and I called the only vet that was open and they basically laughed at me when I described how he was behaving and just told me to keep an eye on him. He never got sick from the chocolate, acted super weird all night, and then was totally fine. I didn't find out what had happened until weeks later. 

My other dog once chewed through two pools and ate a squishy toilet seat."

AskMen,fepmt4g,t3_eq2bom,1579324687.0,"I'm not a dude (and sorry if this has already been said) but here's a key difference. Most girls will describe non-attractive men as ""creepy"" when they make any move at all, but suddenly it's not so creepy if the guy's attractive."
dogs,fem10eg,t3_epo7q5,1579236276.0,"We have a malamute wolf that literally doesn't know how to dog. He is completely disinterested in toys, particularly tennis balls, unless he is occasionally stealing them from our other dog after which he just drips them."
dogs,fefv1mz,t3_eomrod,1579066111.0,"MAN I'm happy our pup was not too difficult. We have a wolf malamute that was never bitey, didn't chew, was super easy to potty train. That being said, he didn't love kennel training and screamed for two full weeks whenever we put him in there at night (one of them during my senior year college finals). Just because of that, I can admit that I don't think I want to get a puppy again. There are so many sweet reached sitting in shelters, there's no reason to get a puppy if you don't want to train it or put in the effort it takes."
Jokes,fe5zd4e,t1_fe2rw0f,1578878317.0,We had a kid named Jack Knoff in my school.
news,fe04755,t1_fe03nin,1578802649.0,That's kind of the impression I got too but wanted to get other thoughts on it.
news,fdyy9u7,t3_enc0tc,1578784756.0,"Sorry for the stupid question but in this part

""During the investigation, one of the driver's friends told the agency that at some point everyone believed the driver ""had hit and killed someone but that he did not remember it.""

Do they mean that he didn't remember the entire accident or didn't remember killing someone?"
humor,fdmf0l6,t3_em3wym,1578547733.0,This was too uncomfortable to watch for it to also be funny. Yikes.
homeowners,fdmdh7v,t3_eltrd5,1578546374.0,"You're totally in the right here. Ask them to leave their dogs at home. We also just bought our first house and we have two dogs. That being said, I absolutely don't let other people bring dogs to our house, because ours I know will behave well but I can't say the same for theirs. I also NEVER bring our dogs to other people's homes. They shed and they're both very large, and I know we have the time and space to deal with it but I would never force it on anyone else. My mom and I are literally in a weird standoff right now because she tries to being her dog when she visits and I have firmly but politely said no. Stand your ground, it's your house."
Messiah,fdcaraz,t1_fd0t66p,1578270521.0,"So I could be way off but I think the poppy field was very symbolic, not necessarily because of the poppies but what they symbolize. Much of the visions or Revelations in the show seem to happen in a dream state. This immediately brings to mind the poppy field in the Wizard of Oz, which put Dorothy into a dreamlike state. The Wizard of Oz was a story of a great man who performed ""miracles"" in the form of granting wishes, but he was really just a mortal behind a curtain. The ""gifts"" that he gave Dorothy and crew were actually lessons they learned along the way."
Messiah,fdc51fn,t1_fdc4h7n,1578267243.0,Opiates are not hallucinogenic but poppies do have a history of drug induced visions/ symbolism in pop culture/film. Most relevant example would be the Wizard of Oz.
Messiah,fd38sh7,t1_fd3785v,1578155774.0,"See I disagree. But I also don't think he's necessarily evil. I think he's more of a symbol or a force of sorts. He causes an awakening in people he's interacted with. I also wouldn't say Jibril loves him, I think he just recognizes that he has learned from the experience that Payam exposed them to. I read someone say that they thought Payam was mostly a mirror and that people were just projecting their desires onto him, and I feel like that was pretty sport on."
atheism,fd0g8di,t3_ejk0ow,1578118343.0,Yooo you should watch Messiah. I found it to be very spot on as far as American evangelism and how guilt and shame is used to manipulate followers.
Messiah,fczq4fs,t1_fcxctli,1578106640.0,"I honestly feel like anyone who complained about it did so before actually watching it. I expected it to be much more offensive from the reviews, but I actually felt they handled things in a fairly sensitive, really lovely way. Religion is a hard topic to approach without feelings being hurt."
Messiah,fcznm43,t1_fcyvr1w,1578105161.0,So I did notice that a lot in this show seems to binge on the theme of visions or hallucinations. I almost wonder if that's where the poppies in the end are tied in.
Messiah,fcwngoh,t1_fcw4tp0,1578030677.0,YASSSS finally someone else pointed this out. I feel like it may be significant.
nancydrew,fcd1ycl,t1_f9pe7kn,1577605355.0,Omg I just saw this and I am super interested! I've always thought about applying but didn't know if they paid decently well.
nancydrew,fbxyebd,t1_fbxhtur,1577203686.0,"Honestly I would definitely call the game boring. Which is a real bummer because I think there was a lot of potential for it not to be since the story was fairly interesting. The level of interaction in the game is very minimal. I felt like they used copious amounts of dialogue to push the game forward since there were very few puzzles, little to no snooping, etc. I'm a die hard fan and I would never replay it, even though I've played the other games hundreds of times.

My favorite PS4 games are RDR2 and LA Noire. If you like Nancy Drew and you haven't checked out LA Noire I would HIGHLY recommend it. It's literally Nancy Drew for adults. 

I also have the Sims 4, Assassin's Creed Odyssey, Assassin's Creed Syndicate, Far Cry 4, and I just started the Witcher 3."
