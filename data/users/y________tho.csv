changemyview,ff9j2i0,t1_ff9i3vg,1579714075.0,"> This is just an assertion and doesn't really get into why as far as I can tell.

We have penalties for things like running red lights because they're *dangerous actions* and people need to be discouraged from performing *dangerous actions*.

They're dangerous because you could *kill someone*. And if you do kill someone, you'd be charged with manslaughter - this carries a higher penalty because now you've actually done what the warning was placed there to prevent you doing in the first place. i.e *You've killed someone*.

Your response to the ND thing is frankly bizarre. Are you familiar with the legal concepts of *mens rea* and *actus reus* - respectively, ""the guilty mind"" and ""the guilty act""? In essence, you're proposing that the guilty mind is the only thing that matters here - that the guilty act is somehow irrelevant. Since you're chopping away at the very bedrock of law, I'd ask you to provide more of a reason as to why you think this should be the case. 

Also - as a kind of thought experiment why don't I make the counter-argument and we can see how you argue the point? CMV: Running a red light should carry the same penalty as manslaughter."
changemyview,ff9hpbb,t3_eseuze,1579713251.0,">  so why in one case should I get away with a ticket at worst, and in the other case spend years in jail?

Because in one case your misjudgements resulted in no loss of life, but a warning must be given regardless. In the second case, your misjudgement *did* result in loss of life and so you should pay the full penalty for the recklessness of your actions. 

You may as well make the same argument for gun safety. If you ND into the floor at the range, you'll be yelled at and probably kicked out. So if you ND into someone's *face*, the penalty should be you being yelled at as well - does that sound right to you?"

changemyview,ff97ld5,t1_ff96iec,1579706704.0,"But it has to be relative, right? There can't be a set timeframe for the algorithm's ""considered"" posts, otherwise every post on a low-activity sub would be making it to the front page. So within this sub-dependent timeframe (e.g 2 hours), the bot looks at all the posts made within that period. Let's say there are 3. One has 0 votes because it's an egg on top of scrambled eggs, which is a mockery of the sub. another has 5 upvotes and another has 6. The bot will obviously choose the third, even though there's only one vote in it. 

So then people come back to their posts and the person with 0 upvotes learns a valuable lesson, while the person with 5 upvotes feels aggrieved (although it's now organically reached 20 upvotes, let's say). Meanwhile, the person who had 6 upvotes had their post shunted to the front page and is now sitting pretty on 500 upvotes for their picture of a fried egg on top of a portabello mushroom.

OutOfTheLoop,ff8pd47,t3_es9g7z,1579690236.0,"Answer: The ""Wuhan virus""(2019-nCoV) indeed started in the Chinese city of Wuhan - specifically, in the Huanan Seafood Market. It's a coronavirus, same as SARS, which comes from certain wild animals and makes the jump to humans. SARS started with wild bats, for example, while the exact origin of this virus is (to my knowledge) currently unknown. the market (which has since been shut down) was known for selling a variety of live animals for meat, including dogs, peacocks, otters, camels, and koalas, according to [The South China Morning Post](https://multimedia.scmp.com/infographics/news/china/article/3047038/wuhan-virus/index.html). [Photos posted to social media](https://t.co/HiQlzX4XBX) also suggest the market was selling live wolf pups and civet cats, both of which are eaten in China. 

The virus is particularly worrying as it's said to have an incubation period of around two weeks. It first came to the WHO's attention around new year's eve - suggesting it's been around for a little longer than that. Since then, estimations are that around 500 people have been infected, with 9 deaths reported so far.

As to why people are so worried, you ask ""should I be vaccinated?"" but there *is* no vaccine as of yet. Rumours out of Wuhan say that the city is under quarantine, but the opacity of the CCP is legendary - there are still flights going in and out of the city (although people are being screened), and there are concerns that that the measures already taken may be too little, too late. Other reports have suggested that China is [not actually testing many patients](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/21/coronavirus-chinese-hospitals-not-testing-patients-say-relatives), raising fears that the reported number of cases is fewer than there actually are. Cases have been reported in Thailand, Vietnam, Japan, Australia and America. Compounding this is the fact that this week sees the beginning of Chinese New Year - in which hundreds of millions of Chinese people will travel across the country (and millions will travel overseas) in the largest annual human migration on earth. 

On the bright side, the lethality of the virus is not as high as something like Ebola. Of the dead, most were elderly people/already somewhat sickly beforehand. To bring you back down again, China has said [the new virus is adapting and mutating](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-virus-mutuation/china-says-new-virus-adapting-and-mutating-idUSKBN1ZL0A1?feedType=RSS&feedName=worldNews&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Reuters%2FworldNews+%28Reuters+World+News%29). 

So ultimately we don't know how bad this is going to be. SARS ended up with a total of 8,098 cases, resulting in 774 deaths reported in 37 countries - a fatality rate of 9.6%. The current virus' fatality rate is obviously much lower, but... we'll have to wait and see.

We surely are. When we think of unfair trials and kangaroo courts, we view them as bad since they usually fail to provide a fair hearing to the accused. But in this case, the accused clearly *does not want* a fair hearing - at least in how we understand the concept. Similarly, you mention jury nullification if the jury finds the trial was unfair - but this jury is going into the trial considering it to be unfair, hence they want it to be unfair, but *in their favor*.

Again - devil's advocate here. My point is that if a judge and senate rule a bizarro-world trial as ""legitimate"" *under their own rules*, then it's legitimate.

The first is that blatant trolling - riling people up for comedy purposes - is not particularly constructive. Similarly, genuinely hateful and inciteful rhetoric isn't helping anyone at all. This is a given. But both of things also come from the opposite end of the political spectrum from conservatives. r/chapotraphouse, for example, have a kind of fondness for guillotines and gulags which I find pretty disturbing - as I find /pol/ disturbing for it's exhortations towards race wars. There's a lot of anger among a lot of people for a lot of different reasons right now, and I don't know if this right vs left/ ""my side right or wrong"" approach is helping anything at all.

The second is that censoring discussion of certain topics because extremists base their angles on them is a terribly reductive thing. For example - the UK currently has issues with grooming gangs. If you read [the Rotherham report](https://www.rotherham.gov.uk/downloads/file/279/independent-inquiry-into-child-sexual-exploitation-in-rotherham), you'll see that the police failed to take action in many circumstances due to the optics of the situation. They didn't want to be perceived as ""anti-muslim"" or ""anti-Pakistani"". But what *happened* was that the abuses weren't dealt with until they exploded into the public consciousness, and now the right-wing extremists have the ammunition to make some pretty compelling arguments against immigration and suchlike. *This* is the issue with censorship (and calls for people to be censored/de-platformed) - that labelling people who are concerned about such things as ""bigots"" and ""hateful"" - putting them into the same boat as those who genuinely *are* hateful and bigoted... what does this achieve?

changemyview,ff6owjh,t1_ff6ntvw,1579631813.0,"I'll be honest - more than anything that we discuss in this thread (conservatives vs progressives, left vs right, reps vs dems) I despise the polarization and dichotomy that the two-party system has engendered. The 1964 civil rights act, for example - look at how the final voting went:

* Democratic Party: 153–91   (63–37%)
* Republican Party: 136–35   (80–20%)

There are conservatives in the democrats and progressives in the Republicans. Conservatives don't simply look at the world and say "" we want everything to remain the same"" - it's a case-by-case thing, and it's contingent on many factors: What is the reason for this change? What is the reason for keeping things the way they are? What will this change cost us? What benefits will it bring? 

Hence why I think painting conservatism in such broad strokes is not *right* - it's ignoring the complexity of the position, and ignoring the complexity of people and society."

First is the great wall of China. If you've never been, you should go - it's magnificent. But there are parts of it (e.g Badaling, just outside of Beijing) that have been restored, and parts that have been left as they are. And it's a strange feeling to visit the restored parts - it *feels* new, that what you're standing on isn't exactly *real* or a part of history. But when you visit the decrepit, crumbling sections elsewhere in the country, you can touch the stone and know that it's stood for a thousand years. You sense the history in the place. I fear that sense of history could be lost at somewhere like the colosseum.

Second point is, what happens to the original materials? For example, you mention the parthenon - well what should we do with the Elgin marbles? Should we coat them with new material? Put them up as they are now and have these faded sculptures sit alongside gleaming-new material?"

changemyview,ff6ivmw,t1_ff6id4h,1579628153.0,"Well yes - ""Among the major contributors to an anti-term limits campaign *in Michigan*"". The point of the argument is that imposing term limits mitigates against an incumbent congressperson forming (and maintaining) ""special relationships"" with big business.

Also something I didn't mention in my first comment was that there's a difference between what a politician can offer a company while in government and what they can offer when *out* of government. Any former congressperson will be, to some degree, attractive to lobby groups as they have experience in the system and various contacts to utilize - hence they don't really *have* to ""start cozying up"" to various interests, as those interests will inevitably cozy up to *them*."
changemyview,ff6fpwx,t3_erx6sj,1579626207.0,"I'd take issue with this line of argument:

> First, I don't want them looking at the exit door. It seems like about a third of former congresspeople become lobbyists. If a congressperson knows they'll be out in a few years, I worry that they will start cozying up more with their future employers even more. Maybe sufficient restrictions or a generous pension plan could prevent this, I don't know.

From what I've read, it seems one could make the opposite argument - From [here](https://www.heritage.org/political-process/report/term-limits-the-only-way-clean-congress) for example:

> It is clear that special interests do not believe term limits will help them. Among the major contributors to an anti-term limits campaign in Michigan, for instance, were Chrysler Corporation, Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Michigan, Michigan Bell Telephone Company, Detroit Edison Company, Southern California Edison Company, The Coastal Corporation, Kellogg Company, USX Corporation, and Pacific Telesis Group (Norman Leahy, ""Corporate Interests: Why Big Business Hates Term Limits,"" U.S. Term Limits Foundation, Term Limits Outlook Series, Vol II, No. 1 (March 1993).) -- all large, heavily regulated businesses. Their unlikely allies were a coalition of unions, such as the Teamsters, the United Auto Workers, the Michigan Education Association, and the AFL-CIO, who rely on specific forms of government intervention in labor markets. All these groups' efforts were coordinated by Debbie Dingell, wife of Michigan Democrat and House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman John Dingell. A similar assortment of regulated industries and unions that fought term limits in Washington State was spearheaded by Heather Foley, the spouse and unpaid chief of staff of Speaker of the House Tom Foley.

> Special interests oppose term limits because they do not want to lose their valuable investments in incumbent legislators. Many are organized to extract programs, subsidies, and regulations from the federal government -- to use the law, in other words, as a lever to benefit their own constituencies or harm their rivals. The zero-sum transfer economy from which skilled lobbyists profit -- as well as their own high-paying jobs -- will be decimated by term limits that force lobbyists to relearn the priorities of new Members and make arguments on the merits, not on the strength of personal connections. The number of groups listed in the Encyclopedia of Associations has quadrupled in the last four decades from fewer than 5,000 in 1956 to over 20,000 today as special interests have taken advantage of legislators' vulnerability to proposals that concentrate benefits but disperse costs. Such growth in lobbies and organizations is anything but a sign of democratic vigor."

Now consider what happened to *other* mummies that weren't placed in museums:

> In the Middle Ages, based on a mistranslation from the Arabic term for bitumen, it was thought that mummies possessed healing properties. As a result, it became common practice to grind Egyptian mummies into a powder to be sold and used as medicine. 

This (and similar practices) continued up until the late 19th century. Now considering that whoever was mummified wanted their body to remain intact - where do you think they might prefer to be? Left in a tomb at the mercy of grave robbers, or kept in a climate-controlled museum, their body attended by groups of workers whose sole interest is in seeing it preserved?"
