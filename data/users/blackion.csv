shrooms,ff9so7q,t1_ff9sals,1579720387.0,"Yes and yes. I've even smoked through the whole come up (some super relaxing Indica) and still puked. But that was with just eating the shros. No Tek.

I think I just need to piece it all together and that may work."
shrooms,ff9silr,t1_ff9r1h8,1579720280.0,Definitely need to try this. What are you dosing them at?
shrooms,ff9sf4o,t1_ff9qstk,1579720213.0,"I don't puke on acid. Like the shroom trip more though, so I prefer to still shroom"
shrooms,ff9scpg,t1_ff9pylh,1579720165.0,4 hrs. Will try more next time. I may push it to 8 just to be sure because I'm weak stomached as is.
shrooms,ff9sa42,t1_ff9pq0s,1579720114.0," Weed doesn't cut that too much, but maybe because I smoke too often for it to be as medicinal. I usually puke after a fight, too, so you may be on to something there."
shrooms,ff9s2tk,t1_ff9p1ec,1579719965.0,"Still puked with a tea though. Just after it had hit peak, which was great. Feel like I got a full trip with that, regardless of the puking"
shrooms,ff9rwo8,t1_ff9rhiy,1579719836.0,Nope. Just smoke weed. No other regularly consumed drugs.
shrooms,ff9nsbf,t1_ff9mxpp,1579716863.0,"Same haha. Some people are super salty I'm asking for advice to not puke, I guess. 

I think I'll be fasting for more than 4 hrs the next time"
shrooms,ff9mp39,t1_ff9mghl,1579716216.0,"Which one? Lemon was good. Still puked though. I have had ulcers and acid reflux for a few years. It's usually just pulling once or twice. Nothing crazy, but it sucks to puke up a trip"
AskMen,ff9mh5e,t1_ff8pvom,1579716085.0,"I'm the same. I won't ever just lash out and be violent, but that still doesn't stop me from feeling like a feral animal when I'm around my peers (I'm in academia and grew up VERY different from most of my peers)."
shrooms,ff9lxa4,t3_esdzue,1579715760.0,"How do you NOT puke. I always do no even if I fast for a few hours, use Pepto, and make shroom tea. Still puke once with that method. At least when I make a tea I peak a decent bit before I puke unlike otherwise

Edit: actually asking for any advice to avoid puking on a trip with a weak stomach. Haha"
holdmycosmo,fdg2ao2,t3_ekye09,1578377383.0,I bet they feels pretty sick when you're tripping. If do it if I could.
policebrutality,fcra89u,t3_eiifwj,1577899028.0,"You have to be such a piece of shit to think that would be funny to do.

They had to put effort into making that. Just to be cruel"

He is just eating shrooms with peanut butter to cover the taste and make it go down easy."
shrooms,fcm5ehn,t1_fclleer,1577764687.0,Goes too quick for me. I prefer tea. Cuts the nausea for me.
college,fck9b0n,t3_ehmapz,1577720052.0,Efficient use of space without overcrowding the area in a way that would increase social issues within the environment.
college,fc35oce,t3_efuoa3,1577382060.0,"Honestly, just use Khan academy to fill the gaps, sit near the front of the lecture, and actually work through the homework on paper. You'll clear the gap before you realize it. It already sounds like you want to put in the effort; that's half the battle."
college,fbx2ee2,t3_eemam0,1577166660.0,"Yes, just don't go home on weekends. That's when ""college"" happens"
Mordhau,fblcrpf,t1_fbk48df,1576961141.0,"Yes, actually."
