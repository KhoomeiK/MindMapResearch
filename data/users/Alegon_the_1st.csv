I would recommend taking things slowly, learning to be more and more comfortable as yourself over time. Take it easy, relax, and don't worry to much about how others will react; this isn't about them, it's about you. If you don't feel comfortable telling people about your change of heart then find someone who you really trust (e.g. mom, dad, aunt, grandparent, best friend) and explain your situation. Tell them how you feel and if you feel ready then ask them if they could help you tell other people about what's going on. That's all I can really say before I start to ramble. Good luck, and anytime you start feeling down or self-conscious about this whole thing just know that some random dude from Boston is rooting for you."

This would create infighting that I'd simultaneously be stoking by having demons disguised as humans plant ideas and give the impression of support in the minds of any dissentors to the norm.

It wasn't until second grade that I learned the truth. I was on the playground and a big group of us boys got together to play America vs Iraq. Everyone chose a side (I was an American of course) and started saying what weapons they had. Skip ahead a few minutes and I'm in a heated debate over whether or not automatic weapons exist.
