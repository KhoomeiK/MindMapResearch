longevity,fdoe8mr,t1_fdmd0hh,1578603500.0,"The paper seeks to understand the mechanisms underlying this long lived (500%) mutant worm strain.  Its does this by looking at what genes are being expressed in the mutant as compared to wild type worms. The paper is exceptional in that it not only looks if the gene product (mRNA) is changed but if if the mRNA is actually being recruited to active ribosomes to be translated or not. This is important as many mRNAs are simply 'hanging out' in the cell and not being expressed. 

One key gene that was being down-regulated on the translational level (as opposed to the transcriptional level) in the mutant  was a gene important for mitochondrial function (cyc-2.1) . When this gene is down, it causes the mitochondria to think that it is being stressed and so it sends a signal to the intestine to activate the pro-longevity pathway AMPK there."
