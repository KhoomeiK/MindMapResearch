AskMen,ffgojr0,t1_ffgdfxv,1579911098.0,"Yeah, that's a low standards problem. Most of the content is kinda janky, has a Great Value TV Show kinda feel. I wish they'd leave anime alone, all their originals have samey 3D art and uninteresting story hooks. It probably all seems more interesting if you just started watching anime yesterday, thought. 

Apparently they've been caught saying that they just drop shows after 2 seasons as they've gotten the bulk of the money out of them by then. It discourages any Breaking Bad type acts of multiseason high quality story effort. Most of their shows have an interesting premise with a half-assed low quality execution. 

The Netflix Way is to have one interesting show that gets a lot of buzz with a bunch of filler, probably because they're losing access to other content and have to rely on banging out their own stuff.

buildapcsales,ffg0vjk,t1_fffdvs5,1579896039.0,"It's only been very recently that 4GB has become a real issue, even with casual browsing and light to no gaming as the primary use case. Windows grows ever fatter with each day and all the little apps like Spotify and Discord are pretty memory hungry. Chrome, of course, hoovers up memory like crazy when it's in use, especially if you're streaming anything. I haven't seen Firefox to be much lighter on the RAM, and I checked.

But even with everything shut down, idling on the desktop, I use nearly 4GB of RAM to run all the Windows crap. Sure, some of that can be trimmed away, but that's advanced user stuff. Sure, Linux would probably run lighter, but same problem. We're talking about laptops you would hand to someone who doesn't care about tech and just needs a lappy with Win10 on it.

It's really easy to use up 70% of my 8 GB RAM just doing the most basic-ass things. Watching a Twitch stream while having a couple Chrome tabs open for other browsing will do it. I upgraded from 4 GB a couple months ago to 8 GB just to do filthy casual stuff, nevermind any real gaming or serious productivity.

If I was buying a laptop today I'd want 8 GB at a minimum, with 16 GB looking like a decent idea for futureproofing purposes, or at least I'd make sure I had 8 and the platform could upgrade to 16, because we'll get there. Again, not even talking about gaming, just dicking around online and running Office.

Anything I build is probably getting 16, I can tell you that. I'm eyeballing 32 GB just to have done with it for a while. The 4GB RAM days are done."

Unfortunately, there are smart reasons to reject cellphones. I just watched a video on US drone strikes that said the Air Force has been using people's cellphones for targeting for a while now. It's likely that's how they killed that Iranian general. Extremely tech and security savvy people under 30 are pretty leery of the damn things, and I don't care for the way EVERYTHING is tending to go through them. Pretty soon you won't be allowed to NOT have your phone on you at least in certain situations because it allows your movement to be precisely tracked. People with work phones already know the pain.

People are kind of awful because if you give them an ounce of convenience they'll let you take a mile of freedom and privacy. Your credit card and banking info is fucking everywhere now, stored on a dozen or more major servers that act as honeypots for thieves. But hey, the Uber shows up like magic, it's great. Venmo means I don't even have to walk to the ATM. Amazon means I can get precisely what I want without ever leaving the house. It just means having your whole ass on the hook, everyone but you has your credit card number on file, everyone can tell where you are at any instant, they can drop a bomb straight on you, send the police right to your location, which probably sounds great if you're a rich white woman, but not if you're a teenaged black boy.

It's no wonder your FIL rejected cellphones for so long and then loved them. People reject heroin until they try it, then it becomes all they want.

I expect that the generation even younger than Z is gonna reject these damn things. All it takes is your parents installing a tracker thing on your phone and forcing you to have it on you to make smartphones extremely uncool and those who are untethered become objects of envy with high status. Only the wealthy and powerful will feel comfortable being phoneless (because they have underlings who are obligated to be online, and they don't answer to others, others answer to THEM) which means no phone becomes the new status symbol."

It depends entirely on the person, and frankly women tend to have a wildly different view of what's to be done with intimate personal information than men often do. Like Sushi said, their mom received a lack of posts as a lack of caring, and not as respect. People want love and well wishes in trying times, and quite possibly financial support, but also don't feel right about directly asking the public for it. Instead their loved ones should take responsibility for telling the world, something they feel they can't do because of unspoken rules.

Addressing the OP, I could see an attitude where a lack of public posting about such a tragedy could mean that it didn't happen at all, as there was no public record. I wouldn't be shocked if the man with the dying wife was doing this because he's certain that's what she'd want. 

Once again, the OP opinion in question is not particularly unpopular, but OP fails to grasp that there are now billions online and that all those people will be different and have different cultural mores. Millions likely agree with OP, and millions likely do not. I know that there are cultures where it is so important that people be wailing with grief at a person's funeral that there are people who are paid to show up and do the wailing.

AskReddit,fe5wo1j,t1_fe5brms,1578876614.0,"Also, understand that ""a budget"" is not an Excel spreadsheet. It's more like a grocery list. For example:

**My Budget From Each Paycheck**

Food - 40

Fun - 70

Rent - 350       

Clothing - 50

Phone - 15

Etc - 100

&#x200B;

I didn't try to make this budget realistic, just wanted to show how it looks. You can write it on a napkin, and all that *other* stuff about Excel and spreadsheets and so on is just more powerful ways to manage and plan your money. Nice tools to have, not at all necessary.

This works best if you have a jobby-job, with predictable paychecks. Sorry, I don't know too much about budgeting on gig work or tipped work where the money is tougher to predict. But the super simple budget at least tells you how much needs to be piled in the bank before the bills show up, tells you what's left to spend, and you'll still need that base budget (how much bills money you need to set aside weekly or biweekly) before you can use the slightly more sophisticated methods that uncertain income needs.

&#x200B;

So if you have a jobby job, you know you'll get, say, 2 paychecks per month (or 4), and that bills are due monthly (usually), so you can divide, say, your Rent of $1000 a month by number of paychecks per month and there's your number to set aside each check for rent. Do the same with the other bills. Those numbers turn into your basic budget. 

&#x200B;

If you like to spend money at bars, budget money in. Likewise for your morning coffee, or whatever else. That's the key, you actually budget for the things you like to spend money on so it's not an exercise in denial. Of course the real problem happens when you subtract all the bills from the paycheck and there's zero left for you. In which case you REALLY need at least the most basic napkin budget.

But if you can cover all your bills and then some, getting a very simple budget underway will reduce the hell out of your stress level as a working adult. No more guessing and hoping and stressing you've got enough for bills. 

It also unlocks things like travel, because now you decide you want to take a $3000 trip somewhere, figure out how many paychecks you'd need to stretch that across, and even if you faithfully save just $10 from every check, you'll eventually get your trip. Same for anything else nice you want. Before the budget that $10 would have flown away somewhere and you'd be wondering why you never go places. 

Keep it simple though.

Like I said, a budget fits on a napkin. A lot of people give budgeting advice and start talking about spreadsheets and YNAB and all this other stuff but if you're the kind of person who's out there putting the debit card in the reader at the gas station and hoping it doesn't DECLINE with the clerk watching? You are not going to suddenly decide to fire up Google Sheets and start making long term plans with the interest accounted for. That stuff makes people think they could never start a budget.

No.

It fits on a napkin. Don't let it be intimidating, because it ain't."

me_irl,fczdizp,t1_fcyii25,1578098774.0,"""Ok boomer"" as far as I can tell was actually a sane reaction to a lot of the millennial rhetoric about Boomers that was getting pretty fashy and ugly at the time. Millennials really love hovering around clickbait articles on Twitter about some Boomers having a bad time and enjoying what one standup comic once called ""the laugh with blood in its mouth"".  The usual target was some sort of wealthy boomer couple in some dubious news article. People used such excuses to call for the end of Boomer's lives in general and to indulge in their own hatred.

About the time all that was reaching a fever pitch, ""ok boomer"" started happening, which apparently came up from the even younger generation, Gen Z or whatever. I kind of received it as that generation expressing that yes, Boomers sure can be tiresome but the appropriate reaction is dismissiveness at worst. Too many Zoomers have fresh memories of truly kind grandparents for them to really buy into all that hate. 

The truth is that the Boomer that everyone loves to hate is a very particular breed of awful older white man with the bad personality of a 15 year old boy, and this man will tend to be in a comfortable financial position. He loves to troll on the internet, especially on Facebook. Meanwhile everyone else his age is taking mass heat for his crimes, and by ""heat"" I mean pure hate speech and its implicit threat. 

My favorite internet quote on the whole subject was somebody on Tumblr of all places pointing out that, ""There are a lot of people who have been fighting the good fight for decades, and there were no old people holding torches at Charlottesville."" 

I think that gets to the truth. Millennials know damned well that a LOT of people their own age are responsible for Trump, for the rise of the alt-right, and for being regressive shitheels in general. It's not hard to find a person in their late 20s who is anti-gay marriage or anti-abortion or who denies climate change. It's not hard at all. It's not hard to find them in cities, either. I can't go on Facebook for more than five literal minutes without seeing somebody in their 20s spewing right-wing talking points. 

But that's uncomfortable and Millennials don't like it. Better to just act like rural Boomers are to blame for all their troubles. 

Then ""ok boomer"" happened, and unlike the wasp swarm of hate speech that predated it, that phrase was short and pithy and made good Fox News headlines.

So there they are, ranting about how dumb someone else is but they misspell a word like ""next"" which comes out as some garble that the predictive text can't be blamed for. Multiply that by thousands of users.

Like the comic implies, I don't understand how we can find a very effective way to render a male human non-breeding with a tiny incision, but with a dog I guess the only option is to just whip out the buck knife and whack off an important part of his anatomy I guess.

funny,fcoxcgv,t1_fcovhx8,1577844168.0,"I mean that's odd, but at least recognizes that animals have male and female genders. Your mom just has preferences along that line that may or may not be accurate. But Shui's family is stuck on that weird ""men are dogs and women are cats"" thing, only flipped over and applied to the actual animals. 

I wonder if it's a language confusion? Lots of languages assign gender to every noun, so for example the word ""table"" will have a gender of some sort that affects how the rest of the language interacts with that noun even though it's, you know, a table, it has no gender to speak of. Maybe the language Shui's family speaks gives ""dog"" a male gender no matter the dog's actual plumbing, and likewise ""cat"" would have a feminine gender, so now they can't help but think of the animals in those terms."
webdev,fciwtdb,t1_fchx225,1577671706.0,"The explanations that I've received are that the people looking to do the hire (IT department, etc) is not at all the people writing the job posting. That's HR, and HR doesn't know dick about shit, so HR just throws a whole word salad out there resulting in the classic job posting we're talking about. It's a shitshow, but welcome to the corporate environment. 

So you do just as bacondev said, see if you can get an interview anyway, go in there, do a good interview and see how it goes. Chances are the people who are really trying to do the hire will take this chance to ask you actually relevant questions and you'll find out that the skillset needed is much more focused, or at least you take your chance to dazzle HR with charm."
SelfAwarewolves,fciv3zx,t1_fci5xha,1577670539.0,"Down in Ohio we just don't get snow anymore. Got a flurry or two in late November, but that's it. It's been 50ish degrees F the whole holiday season. It hasn't gone below 32 the whole winter so far. I'm sweaty. We have single pane ancient windows in this house and I'm sweaty.

Dumbasses here be like: Lololol if you don't like the weather wait 5 minutes lololol. They think winter's just gonna show up late or something.

It's not coming, fella. It didn't come last year, not like it should, and it won't come this year. It's going to snow for one week in January (it didn't even do THAT last year), you're going to make stupid jokes like you were right after all, the snow will melt in a couple days, and it will be 50F, muddy, gray and cold until summer.

We don't get snow anymore. We get rain. Tropical winter. I'm in Ohio, not even 100 miles from the Canadian border.
