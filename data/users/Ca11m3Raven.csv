Here's an example of how a character's face might seem too flat and therefore disconnected from their body, and how that might be changed."
lostpause,ff3zrh3,t3_erhl0d,1579552418.0,"I think [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/lostpause/comments/erj5yg/response_to_uharemprotagonists_post/) might be the fix you were looking for,"
lostpause,ff3uxl0,t3_erhl0d,1579549399.0,"Really it's a matter of their faces being more or less flat colored and the rest of their body being shaded to show off their features and give them a more 3d shape. It's hard not to see, especially once you realize how often it happens. It can get especially bad in hentai.

If I feel like it, I might shade Uraraka's face in this image to show what I mean."
