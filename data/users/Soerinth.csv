My friend dated a black woman, and she wanted to be treated like a plantation slave. The slurs, full on roleplay, and a riding crop.

I didn't decide it was a slur, the trans community did. In the same way, as a white man I didn't decide what slurs are considered racial slurs for other races, but still respect them.

If the community decides it's a slur, and you use it. You're being disrespectful, regardless of your intentions.

I don't dictate if it's okay. See above. 

If a man is crossdressing that is something different and saying that they want to be treated that way and assuming it's okay by everyone else is toxic. You may have anecdotal evidence that they want to be called ""traps"" based upon your own experiences. My friend dated a black woman that wanted to be treated like a slave in the bedroom. Not BDSM slave, 1800s slavery slave. He used slurs, insulted her, whipped her. I would never assume to do that to a black woman in the bedroom, without express permission.

 If someone wants to be called a slur, that is their own fetish, a humiliation fetish, and the fetish alone defines the word as a slur because it's being used to shame and humiliate that person in a consenting relationship. Outside of that instance, it's not okay."
