Grimdank,ffvuyzp,t1_ffvu52u,1580274029.0,"I'm just using default settings and rotating the model to protect features from support, which also makes them have less layers. After painting them like any other model I can see one layer line on the back of a space marine."
Grimdank,ffvuscn,t1_ffv3fog,1580273869.0,"I also have a photon and the guy below me is greatly exaggerating the negatives. While resin printing is not yet capable of replacing injection molding it is a great tool for hobbyist and people that are willing to put in some effort to save the money. 

For example I can print high quality space marine models in an hour. I can also fit 6-8 on the built plate and because the whole layer cures at once the time doesn't increase. After it is done printing you just need to scrape it off and let it soak in an alcohol bath for a while with some stirring every now and then. Removing the supports is easy with a sharp knife and you are ready to prime. While you can choose to do an extra cure step it is definitely not necessary and just leaving the parts in the sun will help with curing if you are worried about that.

As far as dangers you really just need to not huff the resin and make sure the area is ventilated or you have a ~$80 carbon filter on the printer vent. Also wear rubber gloves and rinse yourself with water if you get resin on you.

A $60 bottle of resin goes stupidly far if you continually print rather than taking breaks and letting the resin sit. If it sits too long you need to clean the vat. The film is probably the only thing that needs maintenance every 12-20 prints or so. As long as you stick to reasonable print settings and inspect your resin you shouldn't be damaging your screen."
Grimdank,ffvtws7,t1_ffv6ze3,1580273139.0,How big are you printing that it is taking 20 hours? I can really high quality space Marines in an hour on my photon. Take into account the amount I can print at once in that hour and it's pretty quick.
