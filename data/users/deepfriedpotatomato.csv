Idk about your situation but the reason why I ghost is because the conversation has already fizzled out and either hindi na ako interested kausapin yung tao or feeling ko hindi na sya interested na kausapin ako so to save the both of us from the already awkward interaction, poof, I vanish.

Sure, when you get ghosted, may mga questions ka and perhaps would even have a bit of self-doubt. Isipin mo na lang not every separation gets closure.

Just accept it, let it go, and move on."

> she said she's just tired so she stops it in the middle.

Little to no effort, what you have is a selfish partner. Either that or sexually incompatible kayo. Iâ€™m leaning towards the former. If important sa kanya yung needs mo, kung takot syang mabuntis and shit, sheâ€™d at least try and pleasure you in different ways other than penetration.

Weigh your priorities. Ano ba important sayo? In most, if not all romantic relationships, intercourse is an important part.

Do you see yourself being with her in the long run? Kaya mo bang ganyan na lang? If not, talk to her about it. Lay it all on the table. If you donâ€™t reach a compromise, then leave."

Ang sama ng panaginip ko. Tinatanong daw ako ng relatives ko kung kamusta na boyfriend ko kasi wala daw silang balita from him. Kahit parents at mga kapatid nya, ako na yung pinagtatanungan tungkol sa kanya. Hindi daw kasi nagrereply at sumasagot sa tawag. So ako naman, nag-alala na din. Tinetext ko na sya, walang sagot. Tinawagan ko na, hindi din sumasagot. Pag gising ko, panic mode na ako. Itetext ko na sana nung marealize ko.. wala nga pala akong jowa. Haha. Nganga."
