Some tips: There are usually bathrooms just before TSA/Customs. Make sure you empty.

Also, your bag may balloon a bit while in flight. Just go to the bathroom. Again, by far most flight personnel is familiar with ostomy bags and they do not blink an eye. 

You may also opt for an aisle seat, as it allows you to stretch your legs a bit
