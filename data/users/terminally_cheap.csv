VictoriaBC,fgnaigt,t3_ezeq3x,1580940818.0,"As soon as I saw this, I figured it was one of the green taxis. I think they only hire crazy drivers."

pics,fg4z620,t1_fg3r7v5,1580514415.0,a million times this.  I WISH my Doctor would google something once in a while instead of just spouting what he learned in medical school 35 years ago.
aww,fg4mjho,t3_ews2gp,1580506401.0,I'm a sucker for senior dogs. This one looks like a love! I hope they have many years together.
VictoriaBC,fg1kvy7,t1_fg1jrl4,1580428929.0,The person they stole it from would probably be displeased.

AdviceAnimals,ff8e7pc,t3_es5r6j,1579674752.0,"Your country's medical system is broken. In Canada people are losing their minds over pay parking at hospitals. It's the most expensive part of a trip to the ER (or surgery, or whatever)"
VictoriaBC,feog5yo,t3_eq6jvv,1579299639.0,"Also, the bike lanes are not \*plowed\*, they're basically swept. This can make for an icy surface, so be careful out there."
ibs,fej1q41,t1_feir7be,1579153723.0,"Oh no. That doesn’t sound good. I hope you’re on the mend, and get to go home soon."
ibs,fehegub,t1_feh1xcx,1579114867.0,"Wow, 8 Celsius is what we normally have here. (46F for our American friends).  It's below freezing here all week, so I'm not loving it. Do you mind if I ask where you are?"
ibs,fehebbo,t1_feh0yee,1579114778.0,"You almost don't have to specify celsius, since they're so close at that temperature! I experienced that once, in Winnipeg. It was terrible. I hope you have a heated toilet seat!"
YouShouldKnow,fegna8k,t1_fegbx42,1579097858.0,"The Seterra app is awesome. GeoChallenge and geoExpert are also great. I used to be so embarrassed at how little I knew, but now I know all the countries. All these apps also have flag games. I’m not as good at flags, but I’m getting better."
VictoriaBC,fefx8ib,t3_eoxopa,1579068204.0,"I know someone who was able to waive the waiting period because their brain tumours would likely render them incapable after the “chill” period passed. I told this to a friend in the medical field, and she said it is not uncommon.
This was in Victoria, so I don’t understand why your mother had to wait. I’m sorry she - and you - had to go through that"
VictoriaBC,feex6cz,t1_feewg1v,1579043156.0,"Maybe - it's the second time I've seen it used this way in the last few days, so I thought maybe the meaning had changed and I just didn't get the memo."
crafts,feex04v,t3_eopya2,1579043044.0,I would love to see this in a youtube channel. They're amazing.
VictoriaBC,feepmb7,t3_eor9bm,1579038561.0,"Doesn't ""shoutout"" usually mean they did something good? So ""Shoutout to the drivers who know how to zipper merge"""
aww,fcj9gzr,t3_ehfk8h,1577680599.0,"Pretty girl, even when she’s pouting.  I hope she got to take the sweater off after the pic. (Or that she learned to love it)"
