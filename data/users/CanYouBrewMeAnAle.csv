Because food is in no way going to have enough hormones to make significant changes to your body.

Anything that vegans eat is vegan food. It's a way of identifying what they can and cannot eat. It's pretty straight forward. And vegetarian food is also not vegan but has no meat so I don't know where that last jump in logic comes from.
