It’s good but I don’t like the ball aspect, not as easy to maneuver as you’d think.  I also hate how the hose is stored in the handle, it’s always a PITA to get in and out, and it’s at an awkward angle for hand vacuuming.

 I have a [Shark Rotator Professional True Pet](https://www.amazon.com/Shark-Lift-Away-NV752-Mini-Motorized-Bordeaux/dp/B00X7R1FZ2/ref=mp_s_a_1_2?keywords=shark+rotator+professional+true+pet&qid=1580412961&sr=8-2)  vacuum and it is amazing.  It’s the best vacuum I’ve ever used.  It has great suction, the attachments all make sense and are easy to use.  It’s wonderful.  I highly, highly recommend."
