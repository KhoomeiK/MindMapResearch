cordcutters,ffctspv,t1_ffc1em3,1579807112.0,"> There's no reason from a manufacturing level

**tl;dr:** Good sound comes from good speakers. Good speakers are hard to design, and not cheap to build. Oh, and they often are a bit large and hard to blend into your decor (this is known in the industry as being Not Wife Friendly).

You can't just manufacture just any old thing and call it a speaker (I'm ignoring complete crap here). You have to make something that works across a wide range of frequencies, can fit into peoples' living room / bedroom decor, and that they can afford. The ubiquitous sound bars address points #2 and #3. And #1 ... eh, they're OK.

Here's a YouTube video that has [audio that goes from 20Hz to 20KHz](https://youtu.be/qNf9nzvnd1k). Try it with your speakers and see how they do.

The problem is rooted in physics. Speakers produce sound by vibrating/moving air at very precise speeds. There are certain shapes, sizes, and materials that allow speakers to work well for certain frequency bands. Designing, building, and integrating speakers (using electronics called ""[crossovers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_crossover)"") that can go from ~50Hz to ~16KHz *and sound good doing it* is not easy, or cheap. Moving to speakers that can actually handle ~20Hz to 20Khz will easily triple the price (or more). Actually, walk into a high-end audio store and just hand the nice salesperson your wallet. You *might* get it back.

Tweeters, for anything from about 6KHz and up, have to be almost-massless. To accurately reproduce an 12Khz tone the driver has to move back-and-forth *exactly* 12,000 times *per second*. Think about that for a moment. Mid-range is easier, and that's where most voice audio occurs.

Lower frequencies, down to about 100Hz can be handled by inexpensive ""woofers"". Going below that gets more and more expensive. A 60Hz woofer is not too hard, 50Hz is *much* harder, and 30Hz? 20Hz? These are frequencies that you don't so much hear as *feel*. That means they are pulling a lot of power because they are having to move large volumes of air.

My cheap-ass, 20+-year-old Altec Lansing ACS45 desktop speakers are quite good, considering they cost me $45 back when. But they totally bottom out at about 60hz (they have a separate ""sub""), and they are useless above about 11KHz. This is good enough for watching cat videos or playing background music while I work. OTOH, my KEF 104/2's, ca. 1986 and with a refurb of the tweeter's ferromagnetic fluid and new woofer suspension foam, can handle from ~35Hz to above my hearing range, which is ~18Khz. On the low end, I can almost move the furniture around, but I don't like to push them too hard so I don't blow them out. But then again they cost ~$3,500 *in 1986* (about $8,200 in today's $). And they are each about 3.5' high, 12"" across, and 18"" deep. Not too bad size-wise.

My dear-departed Magneplanar IIIA's were astonishingly good, but they were beasts that ate power and floor space. They were just starting to clear their throats with about 100W per channel, and they stood 6' high, 2'8' wide, and 1.3"" deep. They also had to be 3' away from both the back and side walls so they could ""breathe"". That's a big chunk of real estate in most peoples' living room, and the wife will almost certainly *not* be happy."
cordcutters,ffaxxof,t1_ff9rvnw,1579747063.0,"> TV that has great ... sound quality

Uhm, that's not going to happen, unless you have a really low bar on what constitutes ""great sound quality"".

Sound is based on:

1. Quality of the original source material.

1. Quality of the conversion into some (handwave) digital format.

1. Quality of the electronics that convert the source into something the speakers understand.

1. Sound profile of the room you are in.

1. Quality of the speakers.

Skimp on any of those and you are going to lose overall. Skimp *on the speakers* and you're dead in the water no matter how good the other 4 are.

TV's have crap speakers. Period.

Although our electronics are a bit long-in-the-tooth (Marantz SR-8000 ca 1998) they are still solid. Our speakers are even longer in the tooth (ca 1986), but they are near-pristine [KEF Reference Series 104/2s](https://us.kef.com/explore-kef/kef-museum/1980s/reference-series-model-1042-1984-96). My wife, who was not any sort of audiophile when I met her, admits we have better sound in our living room than pretty much any theater we've been in. (And we don't have someone unwrapping candy or kicking our seats.)

IMNSHO, OK video quality + great sound will beat *excellent* video and crap sound every time."
