LoveIslandTV,fg16ktc,t1_fg0rvph,1580421738.0,"Ha. Love your name. Used to have a similar name back in the day. 

Spoilers for this show are the only ones I want. Idc if I know who’s leaving or coupled up. But I have to admit my opinions of people change once I see how they end up being. Already mad at Sophie and she’s smooching Connor In The last ep i saw."
LoveIslandTV,fg16dtz,t1_fg0rcx3,1580421634.0,That’s it. Don’t wanna watch on my phone or laptop when I have a big screen. But I guess HDMI cords are a thing. I could use one of the 10 I have.
LoveIslandTV,fg16apl,t1_fg0qaze,1580421587.0,Nice!! Sounds like I may have to invest in a VPN - the commentary on this sub is next level.
LoveIslandTV,fg166yt,t1_fg0pg4u,1580421534.0,I’ve always been avoidant of spoilers. But can’t help but checking this sub on the regular - for the memes and jokes.
LoveIslandTV,fg1622m,t1_fg0s6bk,1580421460.0,Wow. MVP. If I knew how to give you an award I would ha.
LoveIslandTV,fg15svk,t1_fg0p8wv,1580421313.0,"I did last season and miss it. But the hassle was annoying. Was happy to see the episodes come up on Hulu, but hoping we get closer to real time soon."
LoveIslandTV,fg15oh9,t1_fg0q2ce,1580421245.0,I found the AUS versión hyper masculine in a very off putting way. The girls also seemed way into the toxic vibes. Couldn’t deal - but watched it all.
LoveIslandTV,fg15km1,t1_fg0til4,1580421186.0,Ha. I got into TOWIE too but had to give it up. Joey Essex and Chloe were the best thing about that show.
LoveIslandTV,fg15hph,t1_fg0q8l8,1580421140.0,You aren’t missing much. But try the Circle. It’s got the dramz.
LoveIslandTV,fg15foy,t1_fg0y0de,1580421107.0,So weird. Maybe it’ll come back before the new season comes out..?
LoveIslandTV,fg15d9h,t1_fg0p2xo,1580421071.0,"The US version was trash. I mean the people were attractive and all, but their personalities had nothing on the UK folks. I’m loving watching the UK version. Seen every ep, except what’s airing there now.

I find the UK version the best out of the US and AUS. The ‘islanders’ seem to all have such unique personalities. They seem to be much less catty and rude, all while keeping the drama. 

The fact that they (new guy) usually talk to the other person in the couple (the guy the girls coupled up with) before or after they take their partner on a date is unreal. US folks are a bit more cutthroat. They like someone they make a move, periodt. None of those U.K. niceties. 

Also I’m living for all the phrases. I almost want to be insecure so I can say I’m an insecure Ian. Works a total Tony Blair today - hence the lengthy reply."
