photography,ffazq3p,t3_esiaql,1579748251.0,"I usually shoot friends and family as well. I pretty much observed the same thing you have when I was starting out. I'd take a picture of someone candid, I'd like it but they won't. They don't like how they look in it, usually. It's a different side of them, not the usual ones they'd see on a selfie or when they pose. So there's a couple of things I learned I guess. 

First: If I want to get a straight up portrait, then it's best to just call them out, ask them to pose. And also most people are more willing to do so when they're happy. So for example, at the beginning of a party people would usually shy away, give a generic smile, etc. A little later on, after some good conversations, games, laughter, food, alcohol. People are more loose, give funny poses, make faces, etc.

Second: if I'm taking candid shots, people like it better when you get a picture of them in an act. Taking a headshot of someone just whose not doing anything, just either looking on, even with a smile usually doesn't get much of a reaction. But if I catch them laughing at the middle of a conversation, playing a game, cheering, taking a shot, being sweet to their kid. Capturing a moment or a memory trumps something aesthetic but if you can get both in the same shot then that's awesome."

* you work way more than 8 hours a day with homeworks, projects, studying for tests.

* you juggled 5-8 different, unrelated subjects. You're lucky if you have interest in at least half of those. For the rest, you just have to push yourself.

* In addition to the the first point, sometimes you also have a part-time job. Sometimes it's optional, sometimes it's necessary. For my college years, it was the latter. 

* And the thing for my case is, I only earned enough to keep my head above water. So I know I got debt through student loans, my bank account hovering between $50 and -$100, and I'm doing all of this (school)work that feels like a cost sink. There were so many times I thought my time is better spent doing other odd jobs. 

* It didn't guarantee a job and I was well aware of that. I knew so many people who graduated and continued to work in retail or service cause they can't find a job in the field they studied.

I'm good now, I got a job but I honestly can't recommend college to someone who isn't sure of what they want to do for a career, or at least know what industry they want to get into.
