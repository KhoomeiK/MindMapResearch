You are about to have a lot of fun and make amazing things. But along with that, it generally doesn’t come cheap. 

Well between Micheals or the like and Amazon you should be able to find all you can. If you shop Micheals get a member card and use the app to save some money even though Cricut stuff doesn’t always apply. But they have sales often so just watch for that. 

Some stuff you can get at a Dollar store, like contact/transfer tape. The Cricut sells transfer tape but they are generally more expensive. If your dollar store doesn’t have then I recommend online. 

Online, Amazon is general catch all. Make sure you look at reviews or ask on here to make sure you are buying decent stuff. A lot of stuff online can be crap. 

You will need tools and might want to start with sample materials to see what you like and such. I’m listing some stuff, like I said you will see cheaper things but I can only recommend the items I have personally used.

I don’t think you have a Micheal’s or JoAnn’s but Siser is carried in most of our larger craft stores over on this side of the pond. 
If not available at your craft store try Amazon; my fee of my favs down below.

navy,fd6so0o,t1_fd3hmlt,1578195224.0,"When I worked, I interviewed and helped hiring a Master Chief and a Gunny for two entry level jobs. The Gunny ended up moving and the Master Chief couldn’t understand why no one was listening to him.  He didn’t last long and ended up going to work at the base. 
I don’t mean any disrespect to those hard working sailors and marines regardless of rank especially when they leave the rank in the service where it belongs. 
Rank in the military isn’t anything once your out. Work hard, study and work your way up without expecting respect or entitlement because of what you did in the military. 
Another chief I knew that retired shortly after me was constantly asking for handouts. He wanted me to hire him at the company I worked at but I couldn’t trust him. 

He was constantly asking to borrow cars from co workers, missed shifts, pay advances from his previous job and more. He never once paid anyone back even after promising to pay. He didn’t take me for much much because I was wise to him in the beginning but he took a younger sailor (2nd class) he knew for over $600 and I didn’t even find out till the sailor was trying to track him down because the retired chief skipped town."

Reality."
WTF,fcx1kbq,t1_fcwtvta,1578047120.0,"Wow, ok. 
So have you spent any time in the real world? Nowhere in there did I say I would laugh but as a person who as seen quite a bit of the world and a realist I can say I don’t put it passed people to do things like that. 
I just looked through most of the comments and saw less than a hand full of comments where someone voiced actual concern for the LEO. What I did see were a lot of jokes, some LOL’s and a whole lot of comments on the R8, how stupid the LEO was or comments on how he should get a ticket. 
As a person who has several family or friends and lots of respect for those in the law enforcement field I would never laugh at someone seriously injured while in the line of duty. But someone who does something stupid and puts civilians at risk doesn’t get a lot of sympathy from me. 
Considering this guy survived with no issues and no civilians were hurt I guess the officers themselves now laugh at the stupidity because that’s how some humans deal with things but also in a brotherhood like that they all give each other shit and move on. 
But if you have any more personal attacks on me I’ll be here waiting patiently.

I totally agreed. 
At a party many years ago, a guy from my command fell backwards from a folding chair he was siting on and hit his head. Didn’t think anything was wrong for about 30 minutes then he passed out. He was revived at hospital for a few minutes, he had a hard time communicating and ended up passing after a very short induced coma. 
Then you have one of my sailors that fell from the 3rd floor of a barracks room. He got up, went about his business and nothing ever came of it."
