Stellar,fecnnd3,t1_fec9ucs,1578978469.0,"I believe that arbitrage and remittance will be a big drivers to the price value of XLM and Stellar Network. I believe Stellar can do even more. As far as rankings go... I don’t look at that much since it only shows fragmented data from Exchanges.

SDF is also hiring people all around the world and growing which is a great sign.
