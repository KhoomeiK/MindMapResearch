If two people got in a fight no one would have even considered using a weapon. I actually one watched two groups show up to what was going to be a group fight (ended up just a standoff) wielding a rake, wiffleball bat, and a tricycle. All while most of them had a knife in their pocket. For us it's a tool not a weapon."
facepalm,ffb3jcf,t1_ffavww5,1579750868.0,Yea 100%. Things are different when everyone know literally everyone within 15 miles and are probably related.
facepalm,ffasddq,t1_ffal2ha,1579743375.0,"My school had a total of like 350 kindergarten-12th, and the principal was going to punish a kid for having a gun in his truck but the kid argued that every truck had a gun in it. The principal walked into the nearest class and asked how many people had their shotgun in their truck right now and like the whole class raised their hand. The principal let the kid go and made an announcement that their was to be no weapons on school property, and exactly 0 people listened. They also tried the same thing with pocket knives but it went about the same."
tifu,ff5xm61,t3_erlvs9,1579613595.0,"I used to work at a body shop and the owners nerdy son(mike) worked in the office. There was also a guy from Honduras(john) who worked there. One day mike and john where in the office and and mike goes ""what's up Maricón?"". John stopped and goes ""why did you call me that?"", and mike replied ""it means friend. The guys in college use to call me that."". Once john stopped laughing he explained to him that it means faggot."

Damnthatsinteresting,ff4fn2z,t1_ff4ei0s,1579562464.0,"I never gave timeline, but if you're referring to how long it has taken us. Yes it has been quite quick but not as quick as an asteroid blacking out the sky almost instantly and it remaining that way for at least a year. My point isn't to negate climate change, it's to point out that the world and life in general will be fine, so long as we don't blow this rock up. It's just we might not be here to enjoy it or we will lose all the creatures we love. Cute and cuddly creatures will probably die, but insects and rats will probably live on forever changing with the climate. Coral will die but those sulfur eating things will probably be fine. We are killing the world we love and know."
Damnthatsinteresting,ff4a50e,t1_ff3lqrk,1579558875.0,"Let's take about %10-%20 off there. He's not wrong. At one point the American Midwest was a tropical environment and at another point it was a mile under ice. He's not claiming climate change isn't real or even that we didn't cause it, just that it's happened before. Honestly the world will probably live on after humans as long as we leave it in one piece. We are killing the world we know and possibly ourselves."
Fallout,feyqv8m,t1_feundyy,1579449420.0,">Granted, some of those are also legendary effects, so... *Shrug*.

That bothered me also. I remember a few times when I'd see a cool weapon in a shop but not have the money for it and then like 5 mins later see the exact same weapon with a generic name."

Edit: also if anyone does this make sure to place the opposite team spawn point in a box or something so the AI don't bother you."
educationalgifs,fdsugfq,t1_fdr3bej,1578708088.0,"My grandpa used to tend his bees without a suit and most times with out smoke. He treated them like his daughters and only would get stung maybe once a day while working with them, and that was mostly the more aggressive hives. 

I've heard bee stings prevent arthritis, and I think there might be something to it. because my grandpa would always sit indian style on his concrete floor in front of his wood burner instead of a couch and if he needed to get up, he'd spring up like a teenager despite being almost 80."

ShitAmericansSay,fcfre44,t1_fcem7pe,1577633009.0,One of my friends is from Honduras and I constantly call him Mexican and tell him that to Americans every thing south of USA just Mexico and South Mexico.
GamePhysics,fbzz0fq,t3_efax4e,1577269504.0,The exact same thing happened to me in that exact same place. Once I recognized the area I had ptsd from losing way too much time in game. It's at least nice to know I'm not alone.
