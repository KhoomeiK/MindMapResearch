Advice,ffhbqj2,t3_etmgzm,1579929101.0,swimming dries out your hair very much and the chemicals are really bad for it. my hair stylist told me i should put on a deep conditioner and clip my hair up before i go swimming to protect it. or you could wear a swimming cap but you said you have long thick hair so i don’t know if that would work
Advice,ffhbm3v,t3_etmi6l,1579928980.0,kind of vague. what are your interests? that could help you figure it out. or you can just save it

Anxietyhelp,fc4qwqu,t3_eg6cs9,1577425163.0,this is really calming and actually worked for me. i was feeling stressed but i just turned this on and my head cleared. iâ€™ve tried to find music like this but i never really like the ones i find; this one is great. thanks for sharing
depression,fc4qlee,t1_fc4powq,1577424847.0,i get study stress from school but iâ€™m on a break right now. i get sad pretty easily. i get really sad after someone leaves and we were hanging out. i get sad thinking about my future. i get sad randomly when i start filling my head with bad thoughts connected to my friends and family
helpme,fbzqcsb,t3_ef8nni,1577256278.0,wanna switch; before i kept holding it in and barely cried and now i cry like everyday and it sucks.
