In this case, however, he claims to be ignorant of what happened under his watch. Then it will boil down to 'should he have known...' and proving criminal negligence if he indeed should have known. Otherwise all the higher ups will never be charged and the underlings will always be at fault."

Fuck trump. Hes destroyed any goodwill with longstanding allies and any remaining moral high ground the us had. 

Yes, im aware of all the shit the us gets up to, but this was as egregious as all hell. In one swoop, hes now justified all the hate directed at the us, and given a whole new bunch of fighters a reason to exist. Safer my ass."

But by having your ic on different services, they are also able to link your activity on one service to another for their own purposes, e.g. advertising, data mining, security profiling, delivering a smart bomb, etc. Fun fact: google can identify you with 95% certainty simply from your daily browsing 'fingerprint' that they have access to. Adding more services, e.g. spending habits from your credit card, gps trends or cell tower handoffs, facebook like patterns just makes it easier to decide that it is indeed you, and what sort of person you are. Then let the AIs draw likely conclusions about your character from similar persons and you can see why people are spooked."
