It really irritates me when these people try to force it upon others.  It is a form of ""control and dictation""; so you are absolutely right to be annoyed by it.  Isn't it strange how these people won't give you the time of day to listen to what you have to say, how you feel or what you really believe in?  It is nothing but narcissism on their part!  I have always been one to 'go my own way'...."
depression,fdisftn,t1_fdgg8jm,1578450014.0,"You know, I always thought it was just me!  People are fuckin mean, they are very hateful and for no reason at all.  It is more than just one or two people, it seems like the majority are.  Yes, there are a few good people out there, but I swear it is very few!  Anyway....  You are not alone!"
depression,fdis1o8,t3_el7p7n,1578449762.0,"Whether this may or may not be true, I would never give them the satisfaction of knowing that!  Let them hate!"
depression,fdirmqy,t1_fcmkiqr,1578449497.0,Agreed!!
depression,fclru4s,t3_ehve2q,1577754931.0,".....like a dumbass???   No..... this only means that you have a survival instinct.  Don't ignore it!  Yes, life sucks but let me tell you something.  If your family is really worried about you, that means you loved.  My brother killed himself, let me tell you the pain and agony that I went through!!!!  The guilt, the torment!!  Don't do this to the people that love you.  HANG IN THERE, if not for yourself then for them!!!!"
depression,fclr6gz,t3_ehvck4,1577754480.0,Good things just doesn't happen.  I am not optimistic.  I have lost far too many family and friends and I don't see it ending until it is my turn to go.
depression,fcjz08j,t3_eh6aac,1577711136.0,"You got it!!!  
It goes much deeper though.  They say you are depressed, you need help.  Here, take these meds, which in reality messes you up, makes a zombie out of you.  But what the hay, the big pharmaceutical companies are making money off your labeled affliction, because you have what they call 'depression'.  And the ones that dont have it?  Well my god, the whole world should be a bowl of cherries.  No worries. Laugh!  Smile!  Let's ignore all the facts of life and have a grande ole time!  Life is great!!!!   
So yes. You are absolutely correct!  We are realist, and see life objectively for what it really is.  This isn't a bad thing, but it is being aware of your surroundings and of life itself.  Life itself is truly 'depressing', not because you have an illness but because in all reality, things are not what many people think it is."
depression,fc2cds8,t3_effx75,1577351884.0,"Christmas was spent alone.  This year we didnt celebrate.  I worked night shift, and the wife worked days.  Hadn't heard from anyone, it had been a quiet and lonely day.  Over the years everything has changed.  The holiday has become meaningless, pretty much like life in general has.  Don't know how to adjust to all the changes, and I don't think I really want to.  This Christmas was probably the worst I can remember."
