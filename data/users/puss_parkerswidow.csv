I knew within a couple of hours of the first shift. She took micromanaging to a level I did not know was possible. At one point I was told to go into the kitchen and prepare a cheese tray. Not 3 seconds had passed when she stuck her head in to see if I was done, and try to micromanage my cheese slicing. There was an entire room filled with people for whom she should have been pouring wine at that moment. I'm shocked she didn't fire me for this, but I told her, ""I did not reach the age I am and not know how to fucking slice this fucking cheese. Those people want their wine and you should go pour it now.""
About a month later, same job, we suddenly had two new managers on board above her, and I gently told her she was training her replacements and needed to look out for herself and find a job elsewhere. She dismissed that as nonsense and was completely upset and surprised when they canned her. The other two bailed soon after and the job landed in my lap for the next two years. She hates me, of course."

 Now, comments sections on Reddit tend to do that and ask but it's not because they actually want a feminist to answer their question. it's just an opportunity to proclaim feminists to be shit for not saying specifically, ""as a feminist, I think Casey Anthony is crap."" There's always that false outrage that they don't see the feminists participating and condemning Casey Anthony, therefore, they decide feminists support murdering your toddlers, but these dumb fucks are just playing. They want smear opportunities, not real responses from feminists. They already know feminists don't support toddler murder as a feminist platform.

He was paralyzed in an accident and seemed helpless and harmless to me when I was a kid. He'd been a handsome Navy vet and a strong man who had a thriving farm and businesses before the accident. 
When I was small he was mostly bedridden. He'd make funny faces to scare my cousins and I, pretending to be a rat and making rat sounds, while pretending that his hands were claws. He loved listening to us little kids squeal and run. He knew we'd slowly come back to his room and peek around the corner because we wanted him to do it again.
He was my mother's stepfather. 
Last year, my dad told me that my grandpa had molested my mother at least once when she was a young girl. 
I can imagine that he was probably drunk, and that he told himself it was ok because she wasn't his daughter. That only makes me glad he died before touching my cousins or me. 
My mom kept this a secret. Her half siblings and all of my cousins worship his memory and that's probably been difficult for her. She doesn't know that I know."

changemyview,fedd73h,t3_eoerpz,1579008191.0," I've been fat, skinny, everything in between. The one argument I see people make that you did not include is the one about the overall cost to the rest of us for their health care. I think that too is a weak argument, since smoking, drinking, vaping, doing drugs, having unplanned children, and running in traffic or any number of other activities also end up costing the rest of us, yet the vitriolic hate is not there to the same extent. There also seems to be a gendered hate toward fat women in particular. Fat men get more leeway, but be fat and female, and you're going to receive a lot more  open hate. 

For the purpose of the CMV , I will say that if someone is truly concerned about the cost of healthcare for everyone being impacted by overweight people, that if they are also concerned about all of the other things that drive up health care costs, this could in fact not be rooted in a specific hate of fat people.  However, one of the arguments I have heard against universal health care is in fact remarkably similar and boils down to ""I don't want to pay for other people.""

Personal responsibility is great, and should include caring for your health, but it isn't as simple as that. We are a species with much to learn, and generations of untreated trauma. Our mental health is overall not awesome. So, pointing and screaming blame at  fat people is a distraction for some of us. 

I once heard a girl who had been cheated on by her boyfriend rage about the passage of a law that included HIV treatment in state funded health care. Her entire motivation was that she believed the ""other woman"" was a whore deserving of a slow, painful death from AIDS, babies born with HIV be damned. Hating fat people is similar in that people are disgusted by fat and don't want to associate with it. Therefore, some people will express something like  ""let the fat people die, we don't want to pay for them!"" while also pretending to care about health.  It is as misguided as that girl was."

AskWomenOver30,fdmdk6v,t1_fdm4uxj,1578546445.0,"I have not been homeless. I have a few clients that are. A couple of them live in their cars. One has a van and that's better than a small car for living in. If you have furniture and stuff, sell it, because a storage unit will just eat money. If you get behind on payments, your stuff will get auctioned and you'll get sent to collections.

The one that is doing better than the rest does not like our local shelter. She's got a bit more drive to want to work and improve her situation than the others. She was assaulted and had her wallet stolen by another woman at the shelter, so she prefers her car. She's been homeless for two or more years. 

It gets really cold here, so I worry about all of these women. There's churches that let homeless people car camp in their parking lot. Try any and all local community organizations and charities. Some cities are doing things to keep people from going homeless by helping with the rent a bit. 

If you're being kicked out of anywhere, make sure you know your rights. Legal eviction is a process requiring a certain number of days. It may not be the same everywhere, but it does require notice to evict someone from a home or apartment. 

If you need to go because it's not safe for your physical or mental health, please ask all the community organizations you can find for help. If there is violence or sexual violencein your home, try a shelter, seek referrals from any police, medical personnel you might be able to contact. 

If you don't work, try to. It is hard to get or stay employed while homeless, but a car to sleep in, a phone, and a gym membership so you can shower and use a bathroom are good ways to improve the odds. Get a post office box for mail, have your social security card, and any important papers before you leave where you are now.

Be aware of surroundings and careful who you hang out with. Get some pepper spray for your keychain. 

I don't have any first-hand knowledge of surviving homeless, so I hope you get more informed responses. I also hope you will be able to find a warm place to live soon."

women,fdm6bpd,t3_elxf2a,1578540863.0,"I remember ""girl"" being an insult when I was a small child. You Throw like, run like, do whatever like a girl. Then when the boys really wanted to insult each other, they called each other girls. 

In 5th grade, we did the social experiment where the whole class is assigned characters, and has to pick which 12 people get to go into the fall out shelter. 11 boys had chosen each other when I asked which one was going to have the babies to repopulate the Earth. They picked me because they were horny  dudes who immediately missed the point I was making and decided I was talking about sex, and one sex partner for all 11 of the male survivors of nuclear war was gonna be awesome and I could just be their brood mare or whatever.

As a teen, it was pretty clear that some of my male peers did not know there was anything else you could do on a date besides try to get in a girls pants. I had a date literally not talk to me at all, because he was blasting the first Beastie Boys album at full volume from his stupid truck. I kept trying to talk, but he just wanted to  go somewhere and fuck. I'm convinced he's the reason for my hearing loss today. Not coincidentally, the Beastie Boys song ""Girls"" sucks and should be a source of shame for a band I do like, but not that song.

And you can work a difficult job, serve in the military for decades, and still be nothing but a girl to some guys, and they say it with disdain. It's an epitaph that gets spat out. 

But then, what does this turd say now to his wife or daughter, should he happen to have any of those? Do they even care? I'd have been so ashamed of my dad if he'd done this. Thankfully, that is not one of his big faults. He doesn't think girls, or women, are inferior as far as I can tell. His religion does tell him that, of course."

I'm married 20 years to a musician who has some similarities. I've always known not to try to change him, because that's not how things work. You don't look at people as fixer uppers, because that is in reality looking down on them. If he's not the man for you now, then maybe he's just not the man for you. I'd either accept him as he is with some honest conversation and working out how you can help him achieve his goals (not your goals for him) or I'd amicably split and work out co-parenting. 

True partnership does require some give and take, some growth- but it's not a total overhaul to make someone into the person of your dreams. my husband did mature a bit over the years, and so did I. A lot of his stuff was about his upbringing, which was not ideal. He grew up in a home where every type of abuse was ever present and no one taught him to be independent or self-sufficient. His parents' goal was to keep him close and dependent -which didn't work, but left him at a deficit for some of life's skills.

I think though, that you and I, and a lot of other people should definitely examine what it is that attracts us to musicians and other creative people. I am creative and need that in a partner. I also hate it when he has a show far away and late at night that I don't want to go to, mainly because I worry he will be in a car accident, which is crazy, because we could both go and still have a car accident. 

I ultimately figured out that  doing anything or acting in any way that effectively took the joy out of music for him would be the cruelest thing a person could do to him. 

Lucky for me, he works a day job too and is a pretty responsible guy in most areas. He will never be good at managing money or planning ahead, and I am good at those things, so there's a way I contribute to the success of the relationship. He doesn't take as good a care of himself as I'd like- and I am not talking about his appearance. I can encourage him to make healthier choices, but I can't choose for him. I'd be pissed if he tried to make my choices for me.

In the end, I know that this man is who I love and want to be with, and that I am certain there are things about me he would change if he could wave a magic wand too. I try to be self aware and work on me, and just be encouraging without having unrealistic expectations. For me, this is OK, but you have to decide what is OK for you. A baby might have changed everything for me as well, but I did not have any."

It's neither- it's more of a useful tool if it fits your budget, a necessary evil if you have to move suddenly, but a 10k lb anchor if you can't afford it and are viewing it as a lifeline to holding on to things. It's also a multi-billion dollar industry that is growing all the time. It's not a charity, and I'm not a caseworker.

Many of the people I evict do have mental health issues, addiction, and almost all of them have managed to reach the limits of their own family's and friend's patience and tolerance. A lot of the time, I am evicting them because they can't/won't follow a very simple set of rules involving : do not try to sleep here, and do be out by the time the gate closes; don't bother other people; and don't smoke anything in the buildings. They do all of that, get caught quickly, and then cry big huge tears and call me names because I'm so goddamned mean to them for expecting them to follow the same rules as everyone else.

If I feel sorry for one of them and let some shitty behavior slide, they will absolutely take advantage of me and do something shittier. It happens every single time I feel sorry for someone.

I wish I could offer them real help, but they don't want it. I hand out a referral sheet with resources, and almost no one will take it. There's always an excuse for why this or that doesn't work, but me giving them free stuff and letting them shit all over everyone is what they want. They don't want a job like the one I have. They don't want the responsibilities I have. They just want to take what's given to them and ask for even more. 

It makes me sad, and I have one right now that's dragging it out and making it so horrible. She will likely die in less than a year if she does not seek actual help and get her own shit together. I could literally give her a house, a car, and money-or bring her into my home and she would destroy it all within a few months.

There was a tickler where I worked once. He thought it was ok to tickle women. I saw and told him I would not let him tickle or otherwise touch me under any circumstances and not to try it. He respected that boundary for me, but not others. He kept doing this to all the other women and one in particular seemed to really be uncomfortable. She would cringe and her face would grimace. It was awful to see her upset like that a few times a day. 

He did this to her in an open floor office in front of everyone and he laughed like a hyena. I snapped one day and asked him loudly if he ever tickled the men in the office. 

He was humiliated. He deserved it. He learned the etiquette lesson he needed. I'm not his mommy and I didn't owe him a gentle, quiet lesson. This job didn't have an HR department and the supervisor didn't think to stop the tickler. The woman he had been harassing so often was someone who had been timid about verbally asserting a boundary that should be plain as day : hands off your coworkers. How someone reaches their 30s and doesn't know that isn't my concern because there is a lot that people try to cover with plausible deniability, or just selfish disregard.

Hook up culture existed long before the generation you're mentioning. I was doing all of that in the 80s & 90s and we just didn't call it ""hooking up."" It was one night stands, getting laid, partying- all very crass terms for a complex part of becoming a grown up. Some of it was emotionally perilous, some of it was just fun and some of it was disappointing. None of it was new then or now. It's how we learn, I think. Then, we grow and most of us meet someone we do want to introduce to family.

I say all that as someone raised in a ridiculously puritanical and religious home where uttering the word fart got me a very good acquaintance with the taste of ivory soap.
