relationship_advice,fels0zr,t1_felrt9m,1579229509.0,EXACTLY!!! Omggg 100%%%% ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ it seems like hes trying soooo hard but when he stops hes such a cool person I just wish he would realize he doesn't have to be like that to impress me?? Thank you really! Ill stop talking your ear off now lol
relationship_advice,felraly,t1_felqmet,1579229015.0,"Yeah I agree.. one week is not enough for him to he that invested. I completely agree. Thank you so much for your comment. I don't know if I will cut things off with him immedietly because there are times when he's really sweet and doesn't act this way so maybe things will get better?

Will take things at my own speed though and if he is still the same I will probably have to move on.."
relationship_advice,felr3o2,t1_felqwoz,1579228885.0,Thank you so much for your comment.. there are times when he will talk for hours and he seems like a genuinely nice person and he's so sweet. Those are the moments that make me confused and make me like him but then he reverts back to his usual self and it makes me doubt everything.. it makes it extremely difficult to know whats going on
relationship_advice,felq53z,t1_felpph9,1579228226.0,"Yes and I appreciate your input a lot actually, thank you. I kept thinking that yesterday too, right now it may seem like a good idea but I will probably end up hurt so it's not worth it I know. Thanks again!"
relationship_advice,felq0ou,t1_felpx7b,1579228140.0,"I dont really live in a big city so I'm not too sure.. but I know I have to put myself out there more. Definetly something I have to work on more, thank you!"
relationship_advice,felplqt,t1_felpg5y,1579227850.0,"Thank you, I think I really should trust my instinct!"
relationship_advice,felovkz,t1_feloqf5,1579227348.0,I literally never leave my house lol I'm very introverted so I hate clubs and parties. I'm also very shy so it's a bit harder to meet guys in real life..
relationship_advice,felosva,t1_felokly,1579227298.0,Yeah sometimes I feel like he doesnt even pay attention to my responses when he asks me questions lol he's always going on about himself and it gets annoying having to awkwardly change the subject sometimes..
relationship_advice,felitbz,t3_epsuyz,1579223199.0,"But you're not being possessive? You literally have every right to feel that way. What he's doing is totally wrong and anyone can understand why you would be upset at his actions. You don't need to blame yourself girl, he's acting really shady.

Just the whole fact that he shared a bed with her is sketchy as hell. I'm sorry but that just doesn't sound right. You are not crazy and you are not exaggerating your feelings. If I were in your shoes I would feel the exact same way too.."
relationship_advice,feja1o4,t1_fej9wpb,1579163539.0,I think she needs to see a therapist then. You said yourself how youre trying to make her happy but then her mom ruins it when she goes home. Unfortunately I don't think there's anything you can do unless you live with them. I think it would be a great idea if you suggest therapy to her and maybe help her find a good one. I hope everything works out and I hope your girlfriend gets the help she needs.
relationship_advice,fej9qkk,t3_epgj9g,1579163110.0,I think she needs to leave her moms house asap! Is there anywhere else she can stay?
relationship_advice,feewoki,t1_feevyl0,1579042839.0,I'm so happy it worked out for you!! Thanks for the update!
relationship_advice,feeul83,t1_feeubpy,1579041545.0,Yeah I agree.. if he is still interested in her then why not date her i dont get why he would talk to me then.
relationship_advice,feesw8w,t1_feestvz,1579040504.0,We are both in our mid 20's.
relationship_advice,feb8n9u,t1_feb712i,1578956424.0,Hope everything works out!!
relationship_advice,feb4tg6,t3_eobmza,1578955409.0,"You should do what makes you happy. There is no way for you to break up with your gf and for her to not be sad about it, unfortunately it's going to happen. That being said, you should do it and stop dragging it on. It's better to be honest about it to your gf and let her know whats going on instead of continuing to hide those feelings from her. She will probably be upset about it but if she really loves you she will understand and let you go.

Life is short and I think you should do what you want before it's too late! Good luck to you."

relationship_advice,fdkuivr,t1_fdkufva,1578511432.0,You're so right actually. We've only been talking for 3 days anyways lol
relationship_advice,fdku71l,t1_fdku1sc,1578511239.0,Yeah I'll probably try letting him explain.. thank you for your comment!
relationship_advice,fdktwt9,t1_fdktqye,1578511074.0,"Thank you. To be honest I've mostly only talked to older guys my whole life. Most of the time theyre like 10 years older and this is the first time I talk to someone who is the same age as me so it's weird for me? I'm not used to it I guess, I thought he was a bit immature lol"
relationship_advice,fdktqlh,t1_fdktn7h,1578510970.0,Good point ðŸ¥´
relationship_advice,fdktpg8,t1_fdktg8p,1578510950.0,I don't think he's an asshole.. I just think he's a bit immature lol I've mostly only talked to guys who are wayyy older than me. This is the first time I talk to a guy who is my age. Definetly weird for me
relationship_advice,fdktl67,t1_fdktgis,1578510878.0,He did tell me he wanted to bideo call before his friend got home.. so it was my fault for calling anyways. But I just wanted to prove I wasnt a catfish I guess lol
relationship_advice,fdkthfz,t1_fdkt9q6,1578510815.0,Thank you for the comment! And yes I guess youre right. I want to respond but at the moment I'm still embarrassed lol Need more time before I show my face again ðŸ˜‚
relationship_advice,fdktaew,t1_fdkt8wf,1578510698.0,Yes it was the very first time we video called lol
offmychest,fczlol0,t1_fczkqqg,1578103950.0,"Thank you for your kind words, I really appreciate  you taking the time to read the post.. I've honestly been thinking about just cutting my whole family off and leaving and starting over somewhere else but it's scary to think about..."
offmychest,fcx9ogo,t1_fcwrf8j,1578056591.0,Thats what I say... I didnt ask to be born it was her mistake. But she always says she could have abandoned me like other single moms do but she chose to keep me and raise me and I should be grateful for that. There's no winning with her.
offmychest,fcwce6x,t3_ej900e,1578022153.0,"This!!!!! 

I've tried explaining it so much to my family but they don't get it. They've made me feel like it's wrong for me to feel this way that sometimes I feel myself getting anxious about it and start thinking that I need to ""fix"" this about myself.

I'm still working on it, I need to realize that there's nothing wrong with feeling like this and there's nothing to fix but it is so engrained in my brain.. I hope I feel comfortable with this in the future. Sometimes my younger cousins or siblings will make fun of me and say stuff like ""you only have like 2 friends lol"" It doesn't bother me at all because I like my friend group small. I don't become friends with just anyone, I have to really like the person and feel good vibes from them if that makes sense.

I've had people my whole life try to get close to me but I feel so suffocated by it sometimes.. I'd just rather be alone, it's where I'm the most comfortable. Glad to know there's people out there who feel the same.

Also, I had to add, I FUCKING LOVEEEEE DAYDREAMING!! I do it all the time lol"
offmychest,fcwbmgd,t3_ej982l,1578021648.0,"I'm going through a similar thing.. Ive dealt with depression and anxiety since I was a kid. I've also always had really low self esteem and self hatred issues so I have a huge problem with my appearance lol 

Aside from that, I have been sorrounded by shitty men my whole life like my father. Also seeing all the women in my family go through shitty relationships, it has really lowered my view on men, so that doesn't help my case at all. 

Even just imagining myself in a relationship makes me laugh and I find it so weird. Just the idea of someone finding me attractive and liking me is so.. weird? Yeah, I don't think I will ever be in a relationship as well, unless I drastically change literally everything about me inside and out.. this comment wasn't helpful lol but just wanted to share that you're not alone my friend."
Anxiety,fcokf2t,t1_fcokc5x,1577834458.0,Happy new years to you too! ðŸ˜Š
Anxiety,fcojvt8,t3_eia42q,1577834069.0,Don't feel guilty! You didn't do it on purpose so don't blame yourself. You're bf is amazing for staying with you and I'm positive he's happy he gets to spend it with you.
Anxiety,fcojqur,t3_eia5uv,1577833968.0,"I feel the exact same way.. I don't have any energy to celebrate anything. My anxiety and depression have gotten so bad this past month, the last thing I want to do is pretend to be happy around my family. 

The smoking isnt going to help, trust me. I smoked weed for the first time ever a couple of weeks ago after I had suicidal thoughts and it felt good in the moment. But after my high went away I felt so lonely. It doesn't last. It's not worth it. All youre gonna do is make yourself get addicted to it. Ive seen my family members who are addicted and they spend so much money on it and can't do drug tests for jobs. 

I really don't think it's worth it all.. I hope things get better for you. Personally I'm going to stay home tonight and probably play video games until this whole holiday bullshit is done and we get back to normal."
