Yes, it is the plant reaching towards the light to create maximum photosynthesis and transpiration of water into the air.

I am familiar with BMW which have a  CAS/EWS (Module responsible for reading key transponder, allowing touch/keyless entry and allowing engine to start). I assume that the BCM is the same thing, different name.

I would highly recommend checking your battery is not failing and also check every fuse and relay that you can find relating to the BCM before you replace the computer itself.

Are the connectors the same on the BCM you bought?


The new BCM will act like a brick if it is not coded to the rest of the car. If you can find someone who works on Ecu's I would contact them and ask if they are able to clone your old BCM onto the new one. 

Keep in mind that there are few people who do this and it may be pretty expensive. You may have better luck finding someone from overseas and doing a remote setup through Skype and teamviewer etc.

Again, double check all the fuses and relays first."

Look at the Global Emissions by Sector. 
Google it and you'll find other sources and graphs saying the same thing.

Agriculture is 11%. Of that 11% 7 or 8 of it are from non meat sources. So that's like 4% or so from actually farming meat. Can't find where I found that stat out but again it's easy enough to find.

Fuel and energy absolutely bumfuck emissions compared to meat.

I get reducing emissions everywhere is important but reducing meat consumption isn't gonna do sweet fuck all if we don't change the way we are powered.

If air is getting in, unmonitored (behind the sensor), say through a crack in the PCV then the Air mass sensor won't sense the extra air, so it will not add extra fuel, and that's when your RPMs drop.

If its bad enough, it'll trip a MAF code because it notices something's not right.

When the engines cool, it's possible your vaccuum leak is being sealed enough, then whatever expands as it heats, could be letting more air in.

Please note that I could be completely wrong, but it sounds very likely with your symptoms. If it's not the PCV there is a vaccuum leak somewhere."

What you said was true, until like the 80s

But then you have 90s cars that easily make over 100k and still do.

I've noticed, a 90s car that lasts 100k easily and repeatedly, would have had 20 oil changes and at least lookovers to catch anything early.

A modern car that barely lasts 100k before needing quite large repairs has only had its oil changed not even 7 times. And anything else that is failing is not getting caught early (or purposefully left alone by a tech because it passes the manufacturers tests and isn't considered broken enough, even though its on its way out.) 

Then later on it ends up possibly catastrophically failing and causing more repairs to be needed.

Doesnt make sense to me that a engine with tighter tolerances requires less maintenance.
