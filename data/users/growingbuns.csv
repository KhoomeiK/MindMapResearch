AmItheAsshole,ffto4xx,t1_fftlstw,1580225413.0,"Ex-Londoner here...always said tube or underground. Used train or overground for well, the overground train and non London trains lol. 
Never heard metro being used.

However, I grew up in America and know of the use of metro and subway...so knowing someone is American and asking me for directions to subway I would have asked them to clarify if they were after a train or sandwich.

I wouldn't expect anyone that has never lived outside their own country to recognise that though."

I know loose skin is something that worries a lot of you. For some people it can have a negative impact on their health even after having lost a large amount of weight. For other they may be self conscious about it.

I'm here to tell you all to not worry about loose skin...having it doesn't make your weightloss, however big or small, any less impressive; having loose skin doesn't make you a less attractive or worse human than one with the most taught of skin..., nor does it make you any variation of less than perfect because you really are perfect just the way you are. 

You have achieved something amazing, you have done something sometimes extremely hard to do, you have done it...you have lost the weight, you have improved your health and life expectancy. You did the work. Let whatever loose skin and stretch marks you have be a reminder of the warrior you are! Give yourselves a pat and carry on with your new life. No one is going to look at you and judge you because of some loose skin...and if they do, they have a problem NOT YOU."

My kids are little and very expensive, also still a SAHM...so can't justify niche fragrances."
PCOS,ff2hti6,t1_ff1nn76,1579506754.0,"I'm talking about a deeper meaning of perception than the one you have attributed to my comment. I'm not telling you your perception is wrong...I'm telling you that what people say and how they say it you're choosing to perceive it as people pushing it on you. 

If someone buys a bloody good pair of shoes and said shoes never make their feet hurt or give them blisters and they have lasted well...then said people will recommend everyone buys thr same pair of shoes because it worked so well for them that they can't help but tell everyone about the damn shoes. Doesn't mean those are the right shoe for everyone who hears they should buy a pair...now, people can choose to perceive that and give it meaning as the other person /people being pushy and pushing the bloody pair of shoes on you or NOT."
PCOS,ff1n95m,t1_ff01o9m,1579482000.0,Perception. Truth is you decide what their post means to you and how you feel about it. How about maybe you try to change your perception to that of this person is NOT trying to push this on me rather than your chosen perception of they are. This will seriously make your life better.
