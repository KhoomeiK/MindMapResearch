Like, arcana as a lore check, totally. Arcana to recognize and understand the visible aspects of a magic item (ergo of runes are present) sure, why not.

But I think you misunderstand. I am team identify. I think letting a player know all the features of an item for cuddling it over an hour is stupid.

Furthermore, you have to compare spell slot identify to attunement awareness, other wise you are saying “you can have this apple for a dollar, or you can have that apple for six dollars”; the point here being that the only mechanical difference between the two is the time it takes, meaning there really isn’t a choice. From THERE you can start to realize the comprising only gets worse if you consider that you wasted a spell choice (bigger deal for bards than wizards) on it, and can cast it 600x faster if you spend a spell slot."
dndmemes,ff44fct,t1_ff3v611,1579555306.0,"I think that there should be a greater level of difference between the two though, because if you allow the SR option at the table, why would the wizard or bard ever take identify and waste resources on something they can already do for free otherwise and get the exact same outcome.

But no matter what “home rule” is offered to fill in the gap you will get the “THATS NOT RAW” commenters that seem to our number constructive criticism.

I personally find the ability to identify on a SR super flavorless and boring, with no real rational reasoning. Like why would I know that 1/20 times I hit someone with this sword they just decapitate? Just from singing to the sword for an hour? Like identify telling me that makes total sense.

I prefer as a player to be able to attune during a short rest, and finding out the properties as they show up. But that’s a lot of work on the DMs end to reveal and manage.

As a DM I gifted my players a magic item that lets them identify three times, or see invisibility once per day (charges). This let me pull the punch of “you can’t learn stuff over a short rest”, plus it was a fun reward for a low tier party."

(Look for the edit, I am on mobile)

Edit: The land of Barovia resides in its own demiplane, isolated from all other planes, including the Material Plane. No spell — not even wish — allows one to escape from Strahd’s domain. Astral projection, teleport, plane shift, and similar spells cast ***for the purpose of leaving Barovia*** simply fail, as do effects that banish a creature to another plane of existence. These restrictions apply to magic items and artifacts that have properties that transport or banish creatures to other planes. Magic that allows transit to the Border Ethereal, such as the etherealness spell and the Etherealness feature of incorporeal undead, is the exception to this rule. A creature that enters the Border Ethereal from Strahd’s domain is pulled back into Barovia upon leaving that plane.

&#x200B;

The intended effect of this was to keep a tone of hopelessness in the campaign setting, with that in mind I think it is a fair interpretation to have these effects default to the Ethereal, as long as the intention isn't escaping Barovia. Furthermore, the Ethereal being a shadow plane of Barovia accentuates this point well I think. Mechanically this serves to keep ghosts and Hags etherealness mechanic active, but mechanically it doesnt make sense to nullify the banishment spell completely - otherwise the spell shouldnt be in game in general. The mechanics of Barovia arent meant to differ **mechanically** only **tonally**. 

Lastly, canonically the reason for this is that the Dark Powers or Strahd that are preventing them from leaving (5e doesnt nail this down explicitly, but I imagine it is the Dark Powers for sure, since Strahd is also forbidden to leave - the only screw in this logic is the Vistani being allowed to leave by Strahd).  The Dark Powers and Strahd understand that the Border Ethereal are not escaping, and are not unreachable by any means for these antagonists, so I truly don't believe that they would care about the usage of the plane one way or another.  


Finally, the argument against preventing this mecahnically is that it is very unfun for players, especially because this rule of Barovia is typically (and likely intended) learned by surprise. Therefore the only way to not screw your players out of a class feature choice (eg Banishing Arrow) or spell choice is to spoil this surprise from the beginning. Otherwise, you can let them change their spell or feature choice after finding out.. but then at that point why not just tell them to begin with - it just becomes an antagonistic Gotcha moment. Otherwise, you have to explain to them why Etherealness works, but planeshift to the Ethereal Plane does not, or why the Hag can willingly jump into the etheral plane, but cannot be banished to it by Banish spell or Banishing Arrow. Speaking from experience, there is really no way to make this fun for anyone besides player that want grimdark high risk gameplay."

One was written with the idea of being able to run a campaign setting for a rpg, the other was given just enough flavor and lore to augment a game where the story is far from the central focus.

Ravnica was never built with world building in mind as a central focus, because it was more important that it words as an expansion set for the card game.
