Breadit,fc4ex69,t1_fc4ea0d,1577414681.0,I am converted. Will be trying this with my next batch.
Breadit,fc4eu4y,t1_fc4e0z7,1577414612.0,"I just watched the video -- I had heard of tangzhong but didn't quite believe it was true. But, I always trust America's Test Kitchen to try things and give us the best method, so I will definitely be giving this a try."
Breadit,fc4e5tf,t1_fc4e0z7,1577414060.0,"No, I mix in the stand mixer and then use my oven to bake. I just want my buns to be softer -- like smushy-looking clouds."
Breadit,fc4dr2b,t1_fc4do31,1577413719.0,I made this one today: https://cookingwithdog.com/recipe/cream-pan/
mealprep,fbxwf8h,t3_ef18f9,1577202267.0,Itâ€™s a decent recipe but this isnâ€™t quite meal prep.
AnimalsBeingJerks,fbxwbiz,t3_ef06a2,1577202192.0,Thatâ€™s a lot of sunlight for being 3 am.
1200isplenty,fbwtmy5,t1_fbwm5fg,1577159112.0,"The same thing happens at my in-lawsâ€™ place with turkey. My MIL actually knows how to use an instant read thermometer; she looks at the temperature, sees that the bird is done roasting...and then chooses to ignore it for two more hours."
fatlogic,fbwkwqp,t1_fbwix44,1577152634.0,"Yes, and in practicality it matters in how much more effort an obese person must exert to move their body than a thin person, and the force that their joints have to endure, but that's it, right?"
1200isplenty,fbwbkp8,t3_eepcs9,1577145626.0,"My MIL overcooks everything so the ham is expected to be absolutely dreadfully dry as usual.  So no point in eating the bread either as nothing to put in the bread. I just have to watch how much dessert I eat and I will be fine. 

So, to answer your question: have the food stink? ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜‚"
fatlogic,fbw7amx,t1_fbw5hy6,1577142568.0,"You are correct. Yes, I was thinking of gravitational acceleration.

However we are not comparing two objects here, are we? Surely, the difference gravitational pull between the earth and any person is so tiny it can be considered zero. My physics is rusty, but that is what I remember."
fatlogic,fbvv3iq,t3_eepein,1577136502.0,"Well, they are partially correct. Gravity does not pull fat people more than it pulls thin people. But gravity does pose a bigger challenge to lifting higher weight off the ground than it does lower weight."
