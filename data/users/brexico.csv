AskHistorians,ff686r3,t1_ff2xqao,1579621421.0,"Oh, sorry. The way you structured it, it seemed you were saying the Orwell article came both after Baruch's and Lippmann's naming, in 1948, when, in fact, your link correctly says it came from 19 October 1945, which would mean he coined it, even if he didn't use it in connection with the actual Cold War. After that, it would seem *The Observer* was the first to apply it to the actual Allied/Soviet relationship, and then Baruch's use popularized it.

> I don't know that it's fair to say an article saying 'this is not a world war' is justification that the term was being used immediately upon the outbreak of what was still considered to be very much a European war. 

I just picked that one out because the writer claims, within two weeks of the Polish invasion, that ""newspapers **continually** mention the war in Europe as the second World War or World War II"". Perusing newspapers in that time frame, he's right. The *Baltimore Sun*, the *Philadelphia Inquirer*, the *Pittsburgh Times-Gazette*, the *New York Herald Tribune*, the *Washington Post*, the *New York Times*, and *Time* magazine, as just a sampling, had all used the term ""World War II"" and/or ""Second World War"" by the time the writer had penned his letter on September 13th. That same day, in fact, the *New York Times* [ran an article](https://www.nytimes.com/1939/09/13/archives/w-j-starts-courses-on-second-world-war.html) that said that Washington & Jefferson College was already going to offer a course that semester on the ""Second World War"".

The letter writer's complaint appears to be a fairly typical isolationist standpoint in the U.S. of the time: a complaint that the press's insistence on characterizing it as a ""world war"" was going to cause the U.S. to become involved. That's a very different statement than that the term wasn't being regularly used ""in the mainstream"". The *Herald Tribune* correspondent wasn't alone in this complaint. The *Colorado Transcript* newspaper made pretty much [the exact same complaint](https://www.coloradohistoricnewspapers.org/cgi-bin/colorado?a=d&d=CTR19390928-01.2.19&e=-------en-20--1--img-txIN%7ctxCO%7ctxTA-%22world+war+ii%22-------0--#documentdisplayleftpanesectionleveltabcontent) two weeks later on September 28, 1939:

> ""The European war, (there are many who have already given it the monicker ""World War II""; but we prefer it be kept European if they must have a war) is now nearly two weeks old...""

The *Detroit Free Press* printed yet another letter to the editor making the same complaint a few months later. That is, the media's continued use of ""Second World War"" was going to get the U.S. involved, so they should stop using the commonly-used term. 

While I'm not sure exactly when the phrase first appeared in the U.K. press, the *Times* of London had printed it no later than 10 October 1939. There was a by-election in Scotland which was contested by the isolationist, minor Independent Labour Party, ""in spite of the political truce tacitly agreed upon"" by the major parties. The I.L.P. candidate issued a statement for the reason to contest the election, which the *Times* paraphrased:

> ""Declaring that it 'refuses to support any capitalist Government in any war whatever,' the I.L.P. has issued a statement in support of Mr. Andrew Stewart. The satement in support of the candidature 'against the war coalition candidate' says that 'the conflicting interests of British imperialism and aggressive German Nazi-ism have provoked a second world war'; and that 'the quarrel between two capitalist States is not a workers' quarrel...'""

It seems there was agreement among isolationists that the war *was* being characterized as a ""world war"" or even *was* a world war. In the U.S., they viewed the term as a dangerous encouragement for the country to get involved. In the U.K., they thought it was no excuse to continue their involvement.

> It's a point made explicitly by Victor Davis Hanson in his recent *The Second World Wars* that states that it was not the accepted assertion (that the conflict was global) until much later in the mainstream though.

Can you point to where he makes that claim? He specifically says in the preface:

> ""World War II, however, began traditionally enough in 1939â€“1940 in Europe as a series of border conflicts exclusively between European powers, including Britain.""

And toward the beginning of chapter two, he's even more direct:

> ""WORLD WAR II is generally regarded to have begun on September 1, 1939.""

What he does write in the preface is that, even though the war may have actually had global implications in September 1939, it didn't truly become a holistic world war until 1941, which is a much different claim. For this he cites *A World at Total War: Global Conflict and the Politics of Destruction, 1937-1945* ed. by Roger Checkering, et. al, which is exactly the claim the book makes. It says that until the 1960s and 70s, study of World War II was often split up in two parts, with it not becoming a truly global war until 1941, when Germany invaded the Soviet Union and Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. But it calls this view Eurocentric, even if ""it remained true that the wars against Germany and against Japan [had] continued, by and large, in separate compartments.""

The second source Hanson cites in the brief claim in the preface is David Reynolds' *From World War to Cold War: Churchill, Roosevelt, and the International History of the 1940s*, specifically citing Reynolds' assertions that the ""**nations** in the war did not employ the term"".

This is also true, but again, this is a much different claim from the term not being ""in the mainstream"". If you read the Reynolds essay, all it basically says is that, as with many wars, the governments involved can be reticent to label them, and this was even more of an issue when the wars were being popularly labeled as ""world wars"". Reynolds says that the *Times* of London and *New York Times* both treated the terms more conservatively than the rest of the popular press, but he also says of the First World War:

> ""...[T]he *New York Times* adopted ['World War'] once the United States entered the conflict in April 1917, and it became the standard terminology for popular and official accounts of the conflict in the United States.""

But then Reynolds points out that the U.K. government was much more reticent to label the war anything more than ""the war"", more for political and ideological considerations than realistic ones. 

Reynolds goes on to explain the same thing happened with WWII. He cites that British politician Duff Cooper resgined from Chamberlain's Cabinet after the Munich Agreement in 1938, and began speaking out over the next year, and this series of speeches was then collected under the title *The Second World War: First Phase*, published [before the end of 1939](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Second_World_War.html?id=lsgfAAAAMAAJ). The Amalgamated Press in London started publishing a fortnightly magazine beginning in October 1939 under the title *The Second Great War* about the then-current conflict. But the government itself was reticent to follow the popular mainstream terms, again, for political reasons more than for realistic reasons. It wasn't until 1944 that the U.K. government acknowledged ""Second World War"" as an accepted, official term for the war.

The U.S. was a bit more quick, but still the same kind of thing happened. Reynolds acknowledges that Second World War ""was the preferred term in the United States, and most of the Western world followed suit"" but that Franklin Roosevelt didn't actually use it until May 1941, and the U.S. government didn't regularly use it until after Pearl Harbor.

Hanson, following Reynolds, isn't saying that WWII wasn't accepted as a world war, or that the terms ""World War II"" or ""Second World War"" were not accepted ""in the mainstream"" from September 1939. He's saying something entirely different, that they *were* mainstream terminology, but the governments themselves were reticent to use such terms. Hanson also claims, following Roger Checkering, et. al, that the governments may have been right to do so, since an argument can be made that WWII didn't become truly global until 1941.

**TL;DR**: Hanson, nor Reynolds, nor Checkering, makes any assertion that ""Second World War"" or ""World War II"" was not being used popularly ""in the mainstream"" in the aftermath of the German invasion of Poland in 1939. There's much evidence that those terms were in popular use. The most any of those sources say about it is that the *governments* were slow to adopt the term, until it was the politically safe thing to do. Newspapers like the *Times* of London and the *New York Times* might also have been slow to term it that way in an official capacity, even though they quoted others' usage of the terms, while many other mainstream newspapers, publications, and media outlets certainly did use the terms regularly from September 1939 on."
AskHistorians,ff2t91m,t1_ff2ohr0,1579523203.0,"A bit off topic, but on what basis are you making this assertion about WWII?:

> That means the term the Cold War (in stark contrast to the term the Second World War for example) was being used almost the moment the conflict (or rather long series of conflicts) broke out.

The traditional dating of the beginning of World War II is September 1, 1939, when Germany invaded Poland, and then, two days later, the U.K. and  France declared war on Germany. 

The Oxford English Dictionary cites the first usage of ""World War II"" in reference to the conflict just ten days later, in an article in the September 11, 1939, edition of *Time* magazine:

> ""Some of the diplomatic juggling which last week ended in World War II was old-fashioned international jockeying for power.""

On September 24, 1939, the *New York Herald Tribune* printed a letter to the editor, dated from September 13, under the title ""Not a 'World' War"":

> ""I notice that the newspapers continually mention the war in Europe as the second World War or World War II. It is not a world war. It is a European war.
>
> ""The same old fatalistic bunk that was used to draw us into the World War lies in the idea that it is inevitable that America will be drawn into this European war...""

It seems, within the first two weeks of World War II breaking out, it was regularly being referred to by that name. 

There were certainly many related conflicts that happened much earlier, such as the Italian invasion of Ethiopia in 1935, the Second Sino-Japanese War that started with the Japanese invasion in 1937, and the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1938, but most historians still cite the German invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939, as the start date of the Second World War, broadening these separate conflicts into a global conflict where countries the world over began allying with one side or the other.

Also, on the Cold War itself, the OED gives two instances of the term predating Baruch's use. The earliest is by George Orwell, published in the U.K.'s *Tribune* magazine on October 19, 1945, which is the same quote you cited from *1984*, but it had appeared earlier in the *Tribune* before it became part of Orwell's book three years later.

The second is from an unsigned article in *The Observer* from March 10, 1946, which is very much related to the actual ""Cold War"", as fallout from the Moscow Conference of 1945:

> ""After the Moscow Conference last December,..Russia began to make a â€˜cold warâ€™ on Britain and the British Empire."""
history,few6apb,t1_fer5urn,1579405890.0,"Yes, ""Great War"" was common during the conflict in the Anglosphere, though ""World War"" was just as common if not more so by the end of it in the U.S. and Canada. But everywhere typically referred to it more generally as ""the war"" or maybe ""the war in Europe"" as it was going on.

On the first anniversary of the armistice, the U.S. State Department issued a press release saying that they would be referring to it as the ""World War"" in all official communications from then on. The press followed suit, but had been unofficially even before the war ended. The Canadian press, too, had been using ""Great War"" and ""World War"" interchangeable by at least late 1915. By the mid-1920s, ""World War"" was the more popular term in both countries, and by the early 1930s, ""Great War"" was barely used at all except when talking about how it was referred to during the war. Though, sometimes, too, there would still be mentions of the even longer ""Great World War"".

In the U.K., the ""Great War"" terminology had more lasting power, but even there, ""World War"" had been used occasionally before the war's end. ""World War"" became the more popular term by the early 1930s, and then with Hitler's rise, ""World War"" was basically the accepted term. 

By the mid-1930s, there were predictions and questions about ""another world war"" happening. In 1939, the conflict that came to be known as ""World War II"" was first referred to as the ""Second World War"". It was known by that name or as ""World War II"" in the Anglosphere throughout the conflict and virtually nothing else (though there were some attempts) unless talking about a specific front. Then, it could be talked about as ""the war in Europe"", ""the war in Italy"", ""the war in Germany"", ""the war in the Pacific"" or ""the war in Japan"". And of course, more generally, it was very often referred to as simply ""the war"".

""First World War"" and ""Second World War"" had actually been used as predictions basically since the end of WWI, though it wasn't until WWII actually broke out that they got those specific names. The first one was the ""World War"" until the second one broke out."

todayilearned,fdol27j,t1_fdm7n9w,1578607303.0,"Yes, it certainly was a design problem. But how do you fix that design problem? How do you get those ten streetcar lines all to go downtown to where people need to get to? You have to rip out the track, rebuild it, and replan the system. That take a lot of money, and a lot of time.

Or, you just rip out the track and buy a bus. The bus was the much simpler, more cost effective fix at the time. And as you can see in the photo, the streetcars really weren't any bigger than buses, so the capacity was about the same. In fact, bus capacity was better, because you can only run so many streetcars per hour on a single track before they're in danger of hitting each other. With a bus, you can pretty much run as many as you need.

I'm not saying the problems couldn't be fixed. But at the time, the much better and easier fix was to convert to buses. It was only decades later when actually light rail, rather than very slow heavy rail, was viable enough to replace these kinds of systems. But these streetcars were money pits. They'd all bee private companies initially, but had gone bankrupt and now the cities owned them to keep them operating, but at a loss. Instead of losing millions of dollars each year and spending even more on their upkeep while waiting for a possible rail solution that was still decades away, these cities started converting to buses. And this happened early on. Detroit's streetcar company went bankrupt in 1922. In Seattle, it happened in 1919. In smaller cities, it happened even earlier."
todayilearned,fdlselw,t1_fdlmx1j,1578531381.0,"This is not true. The Detroit streetcars were going bankrupt before the Big Three even all existed yet. Streetcar lines were in the middle of the road, did not have capacities bigger than buses, had top speeds of about 20 mph, did not have the right of way, and could not provide as frequent service as the streetcars. Detroit was also booming, and neighborhoods not served by streetcars were blowing up. Buses could be routed to them with ease. Building new streetcar lines would take a lot more time and money, so the mass transit companies opted for buses.

[This is the mess](https://images.app.goo.gl/DYFXmtY7YX42UwEq6) that streetcar traffic was like in downtown Detroit in the 1930s. People everywhere, including, Detroit were *happy* to see them go and be replaced by buses. There is no shortage of opinion pieces and whatnot from the era of people wanting to get them dismantled. In New York, there were citizens groups dedicated to their removal. The Brooklyn Dodgers were named after one of the dangers of streetcars. ""Trolley dodging"" was a part of daily life in Brooklyn and they were notorious for hitting pedestrians. They were slow enough and so prevalent that pedestrians crossed their path regularly to get where they were going, but their lack of hydraulic breaks meant that pedestrians often got hit by a trolley that couldn't stop fast enough, because they didn't see it behind the ten other trolleys, or coming around the corner of some building.

People nowadays assume these heavy rail, slow, single car, low capacity trolleys were like today's light rail, fast, multi-car, high capacity trams, when they were anything but. Buses were a vast improvement at the time. Even Amsterdam ripped out almost all their heavy rail in the 30s and 40s for superior buses and didn't rebuild with a modern tram system when the tech improved in the 60s, 70s, and 80s."

Wikipedia always prefers reliable academic sources, even if they are paywalled, or even if they're not online at all and must be consulted at a library. All too often, Wikipedia articles rely on poorly-researched online sources that often spread falsehoods. And unfortunately, since Wikipedia itself is so easily accessible, these falsehoods sometimes get reported in reputable publications such as online news articles of newspapers, magazines or cable news networks, who don't bother to fact check because they assume the Wiki article was true. This then results in [circular reporting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_reporting), where a Wiki editor will come in and try to correct it, and then there will be an edit war, with some other editor pointing to the news reports that reported it as ""fact"" without evidence--because those news reports had relied on the falsehood in the Wikipedia article in the first place.

baseball,fcdbnm8,t1_fcaskcg,1577608548.0,"This probably isn't the reasoning, because if Chicago offered him about $1.75 million more than Philadelphia (which it's rumored they did), then he would have come out ahead on income taxes by playing for Chicago. Some of the states bordering both Illinois and Pennsylvania have reciprocal tax agreements. But all the states within commuting distance of Philadelphia that do, would/will have resulted in an even higher income tax burden for Wheeler--particularly because Philadelphia itself has a city income tax over 3% that is taxed on anybody who works in the city, regardless of where they live. People who work in Philadelphia and commute from outside the city and state typically have one of the highest income tax burdens in the country, second only to New York City.

Commuting to Chicago, Wisconsin has about the same rate as Illinois in the highest bracket so it wouldn't have saved him much money, and Indiana doesn't have an agreement so he would have had to pay Illinois income taxes. The best income tax option in either state would have been to play in Chicago and live in Michigan, but that's about an 80 minute commute each way--and probably close to two hours in Chicago traffic.

Property taxes probably didn't factor into it, either, because Illinois and Pennsylvania are about the same on average, New Jersey has the highest rate in the country, while Indiana has one of the lowest if that was his concern, so it would have made more sense to play for Chicago while living in Indiana.

Of course, the contracts could have been structured so that it wasn't all compensation in taxable income, but if Chicago was willing to part with more than $120 million (likely), they almost certainly could have structured it in a way that his take-home pay was higher than what Philadelphia offered.

**TL;DR**: Personal reasons, rather than financial, are almost certainly why Wheeler chose Philadelphia over Chicago."
todayilearned,fc1gkgl,t1_fc1bcx7,1577318123.0,"Not really. The only Christmas traditions that are pagan are eating and drinking, but those are connected with many holidays. Arguably, holly and mistletoe are pagan, too, but that's about it.

However, it would be accurate to say that most everything associated with Christmas is secular, but most Christmas traditions were invented in the 1800s and later, not in pagan times. Christmas trees arguably had a connection to the church in the 1500s in Alsace, but were popularized in the 1700s throughout Germany and then the 1800s throughout Europe and North America, because people could put gifts in them (mostly candy and sweets). It was a secular tradition not really promoted by the church. Hanging a stocking had a very loose connection to St. Nicholas in the 1500s, but again, it was to fill with gifts. The gifts were non-Biblical indulgences, and were secular. And this was originally done on St. Nicholas Day (in parts of Europe, it still is). The stockings didn't become associated with Christmas until the 1700s or early 1800s.

Gift-giving as the centerpiece, the modern Santa Claus and his reindeer, most Christmas books and stories, most Christmas TV specials, most of the popular Christmas carols and songs, shopping, Christmas light shows, parades, gingerbread houses, and on and on, were all 1800s inventions or later, not pagan inventions. But they were secular and not religious. The church was not only not responsible for them, but they often actively fought (and sometimes continue to fight) many of these traditions."
