PS4,ffmhlcw,t1_ffk3jte,1580054721.0,There are car combat battle royals just not Twisted Metal. And David Jaffe hates when people tell him to just make a Twisted Metal BR.

Beyond that, theres a series of great vids call ""twisted metal retrospective"" that has a lot of interviews with David Jaffe (creator of Twisted Metal). One of the point Jaffe makes is that all car combat games nowadays make the car handling physics too realistic which kills the pacing of the game. You were able to turn in place in Twisted Metal to make the game more of an Arena shooter game.  Also no acceleration, just from stopped to full speed. They never considered the cars actually cars. But more like people with the body of a car. Thats why the racing never worked well in TW ps3. 

Whole series is a great watch:
