dogs,fekda4b,t3_epi99u,1579197635.0,"I have a border collie that does not like other dogs but is not aggressive towards them unless they ignore the warning snap . She loves humans and children. I adopted a puppy to get her friend to see if she would warm up to the puppy , she did not and I ended up rehoming the puppy. Simple case of negligence by your parents"

dogs,fczfaay,t3_ejmgju,1578099969.0,Different scenario but when my ex fiancé and I decided to part ways I wanted to keep the dog because I was the one actually spending quality time with my dog. I had offered her $5k to let me keep the our border collie. She said no because I broke up with her and wanted to get me to stay ......I let her live with me for 2 years as she was dating other people just so I could keep the dog ......eventually she meet someone and realized that our dog was more attached to me and happier with me
