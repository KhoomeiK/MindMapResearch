I had thought it was a bit dated and hokey for years, but on rewatching it (over and over and over), I *really* like it. Sure, it has a few ham-handed parts, but it really stays true to a lot of Tolkien's underlying themes.

AmItheAsshole,ffc2x39,t1_ffbnc5m,1579790210.0,"There is a difference between the two: Intolerances generally just give a bit of digestive distress, whereas allergies cause histamine reactions that can include anaphalactic shock.

For all the attention it gets, gluten isn't really special--its just one of dozens of proteins in wheat, barley, and rye. Those proteins are what cause allergic reactions and for the sake of allergies it doesn't matter which protein causes the reaction--you generally just test to the level of ""allergic to wheat, grains, etc"". Outside of medical studies it's not worth identifying the specific protein.

What does matter, though, is communicating properly to keep myself safe. No one knows what has barley in it--it's in *everything*, often as a sweetener or dough additive. Same with most of the other grains. But people do know what has gluten. Since anything gluten free is also barley-free, I'm much safer at restaurants keeping it simple and asking for gluten free and letting them know it's an allergy rather than an intolerance.

They don't need a full rundown on my medical history--but they do need to know that if I eat a piece of bread I'll be stabbing myself with an EpiPen and taking an ambulance ride to the hospital."
AmItheAsshole,ff954cv,t1_ff8p5zs,1579705064.0,"This is absolutely false about the allergy part. You're right about intolerance outside of celiac, but gluten is a protein with the potential for allergic reactions in some people.

I get what you're saying--there are loads of people on the health trend anti-gluten wagon. But as someone with a diagnosed grain-based food allergy (why the hell do they put barley in everything), this sort of misconception leads to dangerous mistakes.  

For the record, I'm cool with the gluten free trend--it means people like me get a wider selection of safe foods when eating out."

The time spent on a ruined painting is lost potentially billable time that can't be recovered.
