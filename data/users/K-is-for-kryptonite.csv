TrueOffMyChest,ff4pzpe,t1_ff4pfek,1579569653.0,"Are you thick? There's a huge difference between an embryo and a fetus, yet you think there's no difference between a fetus and a fully formed baby? 

Your argument is that she's killing a baby. It's not a baby. You keep going in circles like a dog chasing it's tail and no matter how I try and dumb it down for you, you just keep going."
TrueOffMyChest,ff4l7nd,t1_ff4jew5,1579566310.0,"Once again, you clearly have no concept of what abortion/termination involves. 

You can't terminate a fetus over 24 weeks unless medically forced too. You clearly don't get that. Once again. It. Is. A. Fetus. It is not murder and you are not ""killing a bbbaaaaabbbbyyyy"". It's simply removing cells, it's not that deep. 

The fact you are trying to argue abortion is murder in 2020, makes me think you have the mental disability. Big time."
TrueOffMyChest,ff4a8aq,t1_ff49vqi,1579558932.0,"Is a baby breathing when it's born? Yes. 
Is a baby breathing on its own while still in the womb? No it's relying on the mother.

If you want to open that can of worms then sure.  Someone who wants that embryo or cluster of cells may refer to it as a baby but its still an embryp or a fetus.

How did you get that so twisted?"
