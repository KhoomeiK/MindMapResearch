CrossStitch,ff25jz6,t3_er5dvv,1579494414.0,I’ve been working on this for over two years now so you’re not alone! Happy stitching!
bulletjournal,fdhaytt,t3_el2zw8,1578419130.0,When I don't have stuff going on I usually use my weekly's just to write out whats been happening. If I made dinner with my boyfriend and watched a movie I'll write a little blurb about that for example. It keeps a nice balance in my Bujo of being both a functional tool but also a place for memories!
bulletjournal,fdd5dcm,t3_ek2og0,1578295517.0,Beautiful spread! What white gel pen do you use? Mine is terribly streaky and I’m looking for a better option

CrossStitch,fczjqca,t3_ejhx82,1578102743.0,"I started when I was around 8-9 or so, I think I found a cross stitch my Oma had done. When she saw me show interest she bought me my first kit and taught me how :’) 

Now I’m 25 and have WAY too many projects on the go, I’m a nurse and I have found that cross stitching is one of my favourite de-stressors. I love that I can go between projects that are on entirely different ends of the spectrum like a HAED one day and then the next day a subversive piece that is full of sass. Also if I don’t have time to actually sit down and cross stitch I love scrolling through this subreddit! Happy stitching friends :)"
bulletjournal,fckh1tb,t1_fcjc7rh,1577725158.0,Ah it’s beautiful!!!

nursing,f94dqn3,t3_e3ek7g,1575085047.0,"First thing my 90 year old A+Ox3 lady said to me this morning was “Does no one understand how to make a bed properly? This is such a mess!” after she had requested 100 warm blankets through the night. 

Told her it wasn’t my priority at the moment and moved on. Pretty sure the students tidied it up for her because I certainly wasn’t about to tuck in her blankets while my 4 other patients still needed meds and assessments."
