newjersey,ffju5jw,t1_ffjjwsl,1580007023.0,New Jerseyans are very quick to claim something as a Jersey thing! Our pride is weird but it’s the only way we get along.
newjersey,ffjbcoy,t3_ety9zg,1579994728.0,"This is actually pretty funny! Im not sure if this is true. I do cut people off a lot, but I never noticed it being a common practice in Jersey. It might just be, though. I can honestly say that I have cut off people way more than I’ve been cut off. It’s an issue I struggle with. 

New Jerseyans generally are fast-paced, impatient people simply because it is how our state runs. So it is not surprising if someone has noticed (but not I) that we cut people off. Because of our lack of patience, we are perceived to be (and tend to be) ruder than people from most states. 

If she’s talking at you and it really bothers you, then you would have to address it again. This might just be her personality, so be careful not to always dismiss it as a Jersey thing. Others love to stereotype us a lot but in some circumstances our population is too diverse to do that. 

In regards to swearing, yes. We curse a lot. My professors even curse. It’s casual but of course not appropriate in some settings. Thats something that’ll take some getting used to."

If you have any evidence of him sending you weird emails or texts, then print them out and show them. If not, then it’s okay. Just explain in detail what you explained on Reddit."

LSAT,fefr4ml,t3_eompw5,1579062791.0,I think TestMaster’s and Powerscore are your best bet. Princeton Review falls under the category of the weaker LSAT prep companies.
offmychest,fee6gvq,t3_eojf0n,1579027388.0,This just gave me goosebumps. I am so so sorry.
