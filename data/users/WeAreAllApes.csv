I the point is that if an avalanche is so close to going off that yelling with a regular human voice will set it off, the chances of you being the ""lucky"" enough to do so are absurdly thin.

It is absolutely possible, but if it is that close to going, it is _vastly_ more likely that a small gust of wind or a slight temperature change would cause it instead."

worldnews,fepiq1r,t1_feowsur,1579321531.0,"It is odd.

Surely a technologically advanced country with external threats this significant would consider developing nuclear weapons. They said they weren't, but they sort-of were. More importantly, it was a deterrent and useful  leverage to get back into normalized relations with the rest of the world to ensure they wouldn't _need_ such weapons. Which they almost did.

Now that's broken, so if they were bluffing by developing energy production capabilities that have the side effect of helping develop nuclear weapons, Trump called their bluff.

Now, they have to go all in and actually develop nukes or we enter into an full scale war. Either way, fun times."
BasicIncome,fenv7en,t1_fenhdw3,1579291363.0,"Neither. A proper 1k UBI would be offset by taxes, so it might be a net of roughly 0 for you. The difference is that you would pay more in taxes and get an additional source of income that remains stable regardless of anything else that happens to you.

As you make more or less, change jobs, lose a job, or wherever else, you can count on that $1k. It is intended to be a cushion sort of like unemployment insurance but without requiring additional paperwork to apply for the benefit.

A proper UBI is not $1k of free money. It's a guarantee that nobody goes _below_ $1k with a lightweight bureaucratic overhead instead of complicated means testing, tons of paperwork, traps where earning more can net you less, and the government telling you what you can and can't do with your money."

MSNBC brands themselves as having a ""liberal"" perspective, Fox's brand is ""conservative"" and CNN's _brand_ is ""unbiased centrist"".

After the modem, routers and other devices within your local network are definitely none of their fucking business.

It goes back to the argument for treating ISPs as utilities. The modem itself is an interface between the physical implementation and the standard utility they provide, so it's negotiable. What comes out of the modem should be regulated like a utility."

todayilearned,fcl2a1y,t1_fckvgee,1577738248.0,"Maybe in shooting, but that is not the correct definition.

In science, math, or statistics, we would say that the _shooter_ has a bias or mis-calibration, not that _they_ are precise.

If you shoot 20 times and keep hitting around 4.5 inches to the right in a distribution that varies by 1/10th of an inch from that spot on average, then we might reasonably say that your bias is ""4.5 inches."" That is a precise _measurement_ of your bias.

Whereas if you shoot 20 times and hit to the right by an average of 4.5 inches, but the overall distribution varies by 24 inches on average, then we can't really give a precise measurement of your bias, but we can give a reasonably precise measurement of your accuracy (e.g. 24 inches).

Edit: In other words, in math and science, accuracy represents how ""true"" something is, and precision represents how much detail or accuracy we assume to be in a _numeric value_. For example:

Person A says that the statue if liberty is 300 feet tall and person B says it is 12.3801 feet tall. Person A is more accurate, and person B gave a more precise estimate. I would _not_ say that person B is more precise unless they actually have equipment that precise that is mis-calibrated. I guess that is where the shooting definition comes from. They call it precision when the bias or mis-calibration can be measured precisely (and therefore, presumably, accuracy is achievable)."

Basically, any of the ""credible"" proposals (if you were to try to consider any of them credible) would imply that someone paying an extra 1500 to get back 1000 is in the 100k - 250k per year income range, so it's in the ballpark any way you look at it."

How do you stop people from getting basic services for free that they _could_ pay for and therefore should not get?

Ironically, one of the best answers I have heard is actually ""free money for all."" When they want, revenue systems can be ruthlessly efficient, so tax everyone who can afford it a little more and pay everyone enough for _all the basics_. Just the basic level that everyone needs -- then we don't have to waste time and money on bureaucrats to decide whether someone is poor enough for this or that little bit of help that the upper middle class pays for and has no interest in accessing. Give it to them, too, with no fuss and make them pay for it, too. It sounds silly, but it also makes the bureaucracy so much easier."

That fact that wind and nuclear are close to the top are not in question in any serious research, though.

I would argue that the primary result is that electricity is the best common denominator we have and **storage of energy is the most critical way to solve it.**

After all, **fossil fuels,** as the name implies are just powerful but extremely slow-to-produce storage mechanisms [edit: technically nuclear fission is even moreso, but with more of it and less of some of the other consequences]. They are not true sources of energy either -- just prehistoric storage left to us by nature over millions of years.... and tapping all that power so quickly has caused other problems."
