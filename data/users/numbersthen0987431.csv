Your post doesnt mention you standing up for yourself at any point (when you got there, when you saw your roommate, when your roommate brought people over, etc).
Conferences are filled with people networking, partying, letting loose, and having a good time. What he did was perfectly acceptable. If you told your roommate ""hey, I'm trying to sleep and I feel unsafe with these strangers here"", and he brushed you off i would understand.

I don't know about homeless, but I'll take an approach I learned from 10+ days backpacking trips.Clothes: Socks and underwear are important, keep as many as you can and they take up very little space. 1 pair of good jeans will last you a while, but a second/backup is a good idea. A few shirts for rotation. Pancho/rain jacket to keep you dry in the rain, thick jacket for when it's cold, thin jacket to travel easier.Essentials: medications. sleeping bag. tent if you have/can afford one. portable bottletop camp stove ( [https://www.amazon.com/s?k=portable+bottletop+camp+stove&i=sporting&ref=nb\_sb\_noss\_2](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=portable+bottletop+camp+stove&i=sporting&ref=nb_sb_noss_2)).  Get a mini first aid with disinfectants. Always hide $20 cash where no one can find it, and only use it in a dire emergency.Tips: Wash your clothes as often as you can or can afford to; being clean will help your self esteem. The fancy/big truck stops can be a good place to hide out for a few hours; there's so much traffic and the place is so big that no one will notice you. Libraries are good and have resources like computers. Canned food will be your friend, or dehydrated food (that you have to only add water to). Learn to pack your clothes in as small a space as possible.

Also, find somewhere to house yourself. Shelters may not be the best, but they at least can keep you out of the elements. Find a job as soon as you can, because 100 cash plus 100 amazon bucks won't last you long."

Will I get into trouble for doing so? Is there an option I'm not thinking of to handle his trailer/truck? Would it be better to find an RV storage instead of a storage unit?"

legaladvice,fcvg3rb,t1_fcv9k2a,1578001367.0,"I have no idea who is written as what in his will to be honest. We've only talked about it in broad stroke terms up until now. We have talked about me being the main person, but what the will states officially is still unknown to me. 

My parents are divorced, I am the only child of his (that I know of), and the only other blood relatives are his siblings and my cousins. 

The only reason I would put anything into storage is because he lives in a trailer as a camp host, and I am trying to keep his possessions from being discarded"

AmItheAsshole,fcv6eow,t3_ej2orz,1577995599.0,"NTA, and your friend isn't an AH. Your ex friend, however...HUGE AH.

You have 2 conflicting options here: You can either ignore the Ex friend, or you can confront with him whenever he uses racist comments. Personally I would prefer the 2nd choice, because you're trying to make the world a better place. By ignoring him and letting him get away with the comments (running away/avoiding him is letting him get away with that stuff) you're allowing his hatred, anger, and racism to be heard and spread. If you confront him, you're at least trying to change the way he thinks.

I'm not saying fight him or argue with him, but you can confront his belief of racism and try to at least persuade him to not be hateful."
AmItheAsshole,fcv3d3x,t3_ej2qqf,1577993803.0,"Depends on the job honestly. If it comes down to anything where specialized knowledge is needed, people's lives depend on their actions, or the company is required by law that she has the degree, then you would be NTA.

If it's anything where you can do the work within the bounds of legal/ethical boundaries, but don't necessarily need a degree then YTA"
AmItheAsshole,fcv2txf,t3_ej2rhp,1577993486.0,"YTA. She doesn't have bad luck dating because she's choosing white guys, she's having bad luck dating because she's choosing douche bags to date. You're deciding to exclude her from your group based on the fact that she doesn't have a good dating history? This whole post sounds like something from r/niceguys, and someone in your group wants to date her but she won't. Honestly, she needs to find better friends than you because you're not supportive like friends should be.

Also, you're racist. The title alone is borderline racist, but you also pulled the white guy version of ""but I have a black friend"" with your statement:

>  I have a couple of white guy friends who never do that."

Eh, the term ""red flag"" is supposed to mean it's a really bad thing and to not ever see that person again. Red flag is supposed to mean danger, do not approach. Yellow flag is a warning, which sounds like what you mean in this case.

People don't have social media? Person doesn't answer his phone quickly? Person says questionable things? Yellow flag.

Person says something that praises Hitler, abuses a puppy, and carries date-rape pills? Red-flag"
