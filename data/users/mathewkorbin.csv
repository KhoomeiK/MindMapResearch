...that concluded with the simplicity of stating ""Trump did not collude with Russia.""
If that's your evidence to impeach now, after starting with the premise that he committed a quid pro quo with Ukraine, then no one knows what to do with your thought. And because of the Mueller Report, he released the transcripts of the call.  

Reciting a report that concluded no wrong doing, that Dems gave up on, and now trying to state that those were the crimes he committed is just odd. Especially when the Dems are still stating he is hiding information, and you still want more evidence.  If the Mueller Report gave you the obstruction, then what other evidence do you need?"

$7.25/hr x 7.5 hours per week would be $271.88.  however... $271.88 x 52 weeks in a year is $14,137.50. and if you are looking for a monthly amount, then it would be $1178.13.

So regardless of the argument you wish to make, they are both starting off incorrectly. 
Assuming 20% taxes (which you will get back at end of year in taxes), is down to $942.50.

And you shouldn't be fighting for wage increases, but job training.  You can get a job at McDonald's from $9-$12 an hour in most places.  Change that to chic fil a, and that is now $10-$15. Walmart hires for $9-$13.  
I know minimum wage jobs exist, but there are several others in your area that pay a decent wage.  Assuming $10/hr with all same, that's $1,625. That's almost a $450 increase in monthly income from $7.25 for the same experience level and hours."

I'm not arguing that they didn't write it into the constitution.   I'm ok with a contract not being renewed (this doesn't apply here), and it was supposed to be in situations of dire straights.... Not because you dont like the guy. It was supposed to be an across all parties decision.  And there's no mention of jail; you're just full of anger on that fact.
