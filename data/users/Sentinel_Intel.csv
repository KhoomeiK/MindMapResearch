Keto_Food,ffeuzdj,t1_ffefvuz,1579866693.0,Tigard Oregon sucks balls. I got stuck there for 2 weeks once while my car was being repaired. My options were: Sit in my musty crappy hotel room that was non smoking but someone def smoked in. Go to the bar at the Mandarin Restraunt in the day and go across the street and watch karaoke at night. FOR 2 WEEKS. Fuck Tigard Oregon.

sadcringe,ffdo8rm,t1_ffcxcxd,1579825091.0,"I was that guy too. I only went to the hospital maybe 4 times in 15 years but I was TERRIFIED and I couldn't stop. I was so sick and shaking and my heart rate was 140bps, I was waiting in a bar at 1030AM to get a 6 pack and I couldn't take it anymore. I broke. I went home and called 911 cuz I was about to pass out or die or something. The ambulance Bros in the back were both recovering alcoholics and got me thru it. I got home that night and the beast was finally calm for the first time in over a decade. That was 257 days ago and I'm never goin back. This life is great if you stop running, turn around and fight back hard... But you have to run full speed back at it. Sobriety isn't for the weak. The beast is cold, dark, loneliness and fear, he's ruthless and he's wayyyyy bigger than you ever could have imagined. And he hurts you... bad."

ChoosingBeggars,ff2w3jt,t1_ff1rai0,1579526377.0,"Op my fiance used to manage a pizza shop. She says people would do this when they wanted a thin crust if you didn't offer one. The idea being that the medium spread to a large would thin out the dough... If you don't offer a thin crust, this is probably what they were going for..."
Keto_Food,ff2vn6z,t3_er7gms,1579525905.0,"Mission makes low carb tortillas that I use to make really good thin pizzas. They are 4 carbs, if you absolutely hate cauliflower like me. FYI."
