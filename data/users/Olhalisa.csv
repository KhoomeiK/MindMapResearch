No it's not, you're a size 16 you can't do a single pullup and probably not even a pushup unlike a fit size 8 woman. It's just not possible for an average karen to pull your whole bodyweight when you are that heavy."
fatlogic,fejudkd,t3_eotwps,1579186062.0,These people must find IFBB pro competitors mind boggling.
fatlogic,fejrm7v,t3_eotyif,1579184117.0,"First of all women in the fitness industry are not skinny, they are lean and muscular. And second, fun joke."
fatlogic,fedj27f,t3_eoa8fy,1579012792.0,"Yeah because the best way to recover from anorexia is to become obese, everyone knows it. You swap one thing that gives you image issues with another. Anything but becoming mentally healthy and maintaining a healthy body/weight too."
fatlogic,fedidfa,t1_febyxd3,1579012296.0,"Honestly I am caucasian and never found any princess similar to me as a kid. There's Belle who has brown hair/eyes but everyone else? They are either blond more nordic looking than general caucasian. Then there's snow white with black hair and pale skin, one red haired fish and the ethnic princesses...Being brunette with brow eyes the most common combo in caucasians I always found it weird that only one princess looks like that."
fatlogic,fedfdkz,t1_feb7i35,1579010012.0,Sir try transforming your body to a low fat high lean mass figure and then tell me if its not dramatic...
fatlogic,fedf2je,t1_feb7b8k,1579009764.0,Lol says someone who hasn't transformed his body from fluffy to shredded for sure. If you had you wouldn't say such nonsense.
fatlogic,fedethz,t1_feb56zn,1579009558.0,It is drastic enough to change a body two whole sizes. At the same weight I am now before strength training I wore jeans two sizes bigger.
fatlogic,fead9ws,t3_envvez,1578947210.0,"I never draw fat people, thicc curvy girls is as far as I would go. My art, my preferences. If you want pictures of fat people draw them yourself, I do art for my own enjoyment not others."
fatlogic,fdvrqak,t1_fdu8iur,1578750784.0,"Wrong. Also you are forgetting chunks of people who lose fat as a profession/hobby: bodybuilding competitiors. A girl in that group could say omg I'm so fat at 20% bodyfat because she's used to cut up to 10% and in comparison it's much more weight to put on in a short period of time than your average fat person who's been on a steady fat weight for the last five years. Calling yourself fat when you eat too much is stupid, wrong choice of words to describe your feelings. Calling yourself fat when your body fat % is high totally understandable, even if it's still in the healthy rage a change upwards is a change upwards."
fatlogic,fdvqh5r,t1_fdsywzt,1578750321.0,"Well...fat folks are bigger than healthy weight ones who see them much bigger in comparison all the time, saying it out loud makes no difference in the eyes of the beholder."
fatlogic,fdvoyi7,t3_en29tf,1578749874.0,"At 16 you can bear kids. In fact I was physically able to bear kids since I was 12, starded menstruating early due to high fat storage. I was skinnier at 16 than I was at 12 and I'm way, way thinner now ten years later. Weight is not something that just happens, you can control it by thinking before eating and doing exercise."
fatlogic,fdvodh8,t1_fdu0bxw,1578749640.0,"Because this way of measuring fat is accurate. You can't be at 50% body fat and healthy, thus it's easier for haes folks to do a 180° on real methods to measure health and keep bashing bmi since doctor still use it all the time. Once doctors start using body composition scales though..."
fatlogic,fdk91u8,t3_eltodu,1578498835.0,"Well I do judge people whose hair grows past their chest, it's usually very ugly and not taken care of, they just let it grow and never cut their split ends."
fatlogic,fdk8r3h,t3_elu4ki,1578498644.0,"People focus too much on weight when its not the best approach. Train to pass the military fitness test, once you reach that point train as if you had to pass the post military academy fitness tests, suddenly you've lost all your extra weight and have an ottermode physique, magic! Nobody passes those tests being overweight. Train and eat for fitness not for weightloss, much more useful and accurate to track too."
aspergers,fdchhi9,t3_eken0v,1578275013.0,"I'm allergic to cold, dust and mould and it's a humid winter over here, imagine my everyday, that which you explain is my normal state since November, medication is your only choice. Also I've got friends with cats and cat allergy who just have a pill a day to keep the cat too."
aspergers,fdccnmn,t3_ekbgxv,1578271685.0,"I have only one close friend right now, usually works for me to have just one person I talk to everyday. Met him through online gaming and we basically play everyday too. Met previous friends skating and doing other things out of home. Just find a hobby that forces you into being social in person or online. I sincerely recommend outdoor sports to meet likeminded people, just find one you like,  everyone who does a sport enjoys talking about it for hours which makes then perfect for an autistic person, no personal stuff needed."
fatlogic,fdc4c2f,t1_fdaodmj,1578266854.0,"Definitely on the loose skin bandwagon, at least her breast are visible completely saggy in that picture, she's probably similar in the belly and legs. I wouldn't be surprised of she gets breast surgery and more sometime soon, extra skin is unavoidable with huge weightloss."
fatlogic,fdc3hc1,t1_fdagi1d,1578266365.0,"In my country/language we have a word similar to ""lean"" we call people when they are thin but healty looking or muscular and it's always used in a positive way. I got to normal weight and low bodyfat and that's all the compliments I'm getting, not a single ""thin/skinny"" one. Dunno but calling people lean in English culture doesn't seem to be common at all and I find that a shame because there is a slight but very defining difference in the meaning of those words, skinny is somewhat bad but lean isn't imo."
fatlogic,fdc2j4j,t3_ekgr6e,1578265827.0,"I'm sure this person would love to be saved from a fire by firefighters who don't work out lol. Fun fact, they wouldn't be able to get the job done and she'd perish. Amazing fatphobia free world to live in it would be."
fatlogic,fdc1uuq,t3_ekhtoe,1578265452.0,"True poor people don't earn enough to afford enough food to become obese...Just the other day my grandma bought some food for a family in her neighbourhood who is truly poor, none of them is even slightly overweight when they have to rely on strangers kindness to buy potatoes. I hate people who call themselves poor when they're not, poor means struggling to make ends meet not unable to afford holidays and restaurants."
fatlogic,fd517ef,t3_ejyf93,1578173189.0,"I sincerely hope this person approves of any drug abuse as a coping mechanism too, if not his logic is flawed. Also the 'resilient' argument is one I've heard from drug addicts so go figure."
fatlogic,fcyvi0a,t3_ejj6oh,1578087978.0,"Honestly I'm only seeing pro fat acceptance people comments on how wrong it is to comment her weightloss, not the actual pro weightloss ones. It's like they hit the ball before it was thrown."
fatlogic,fcogodz,t1_fcl3mny,1577831787.0,"This winter is cold af and I'm constantly dreading going to the gym because I have to bike to get there and it's just so cold outside...And I'm fit for biking, gym and anything really. When I started last winter I wasn't but I pushed through it and thus achieved my current physique. I'm so proud of how disciplined I was from the beginning, you can't even imagine."
fatlogic,fci9o9h,t3_eg684i,1577659456.0,"I hate this posts so much. Sometimes that January lifestyle change is exactly what someone needs to get out of depression, lack of drive, etc. It was what helped me get my shit together after my partner died the previous year. I don't imagine my life better if I stayed stuck depressed in bed feeling sorry for myself. My life goes on even if he's doesn't. It's insulting to bash on people's resolutions, you never know what inspired them to change."
fatlogic,fci8pba,t1_fc6jmnq,1577659104.0,"To be fair I have seen it happen in people who cut whole food groups (vegan/vegeratrian) and work out a lot, but it's not that common and certainly not healthy. And they don't weight as much as this guy either."
fatlogic,fci852t,t1_fc6qqhy,1577658888.0,"Not obese but most powerlifters are certainly overweight. The thighs of those men jiggle more than mine and I store all my fat there as a woman, they carry so much fat..."
fatlogic,fci7szb,t1_fc65wy5,1577658767.0,"In fact ONLY strongmen/powerlifters and highest class bodybuilders have obese bmi, and the firsts are indeed obese from fat rather than only muscle."
fatlogic,fci772n,t1_fcba300,1577658549.0,Totally right. I have all my fat at my lower body yet my abs are popping at 20% body fat. Perks of being a woman.
fatlogic,fci5qmz,t1_fc7tn60,1577658083.0,My mom is like this but I am lazy af. Her cooking kept her at maintenance while it made me fat as a teen. Had to learn to cook intuitively for myself to stay at a normal weight.
fatlogic,fci3sb6,t3_eghy6i,1577657428.0,"To be fair there is a guy working at my gym who isn't fit by any means and has a belly. I would never ask him for anything before I see him working out with perfect form whereas I would ask to the fit guys any day without doubting their knowledge. Looks matter. Just like a fat chef fits in a kitchen, an athletic instructor inspires confidence."
fatlogic,fci38pp,t1_fc6sjrv,1577657230.0,It's not an issue she's willing to accept she has but certainly does. And diet and weightloss are culturally associated with women as society pushes women to focus on their looks way more than men so it really is a women issue.
fatlogic,fci27tz,t1_fc7dxgj,1577656866.0,"Well knowing the bmi of an athlete with low bodyfat is around 20, being under 18 seems more reasonable than being over 25. Honestly a 25bmi person without high lean mass% (muscle) has a real high bodyfat% and that's truly unhealthy whereas the underweight by one point hasn't yet lost enough to lose a significant amount of lean mass, therefore low bodyfat too and pretty easy to reverse. Body composition % make much more sense than bmi."
fatlogic,fci0yn8,t3_egx9ut,1577656452.0,"You know what's triggering? Going to the gym as you always do and finding it full of people right after Christmas, like doing cardio for two days is going to help your binging episodes. People should learn some moderation and healthy habits instead of trying to find quick fixes for everything and cramming the gym going all at the same time."
fatlogic,fchzunf,t1_fchv4wj,1577656082.0,"Same here cup B to C. But the biggest change was developing chest muscles, even if my tits are smaller the shadow of the muscle makes them amazingly beautiful. I never liked my tits this much before."
fatlogic,fchz5vq,t1_fch0wiq,1577655847.0,"I relate, I also lost an overweight friend to this issue. Jealously is a bitch really, they say that because it's the only thing they value in their own bodies and when someone gets fit and is overall better looking than them they go all like ""well at least I've got tits"" well no, you ONLY got tits Karen. I congratulate you on cutting that toxic friendship."
fatlogic,fchwqwl,t1_fcdrfv3,1577655045.0,"You'd be surprised of how much people are scared of the smallest changes. I know a girl who has had the same haircut for 10+ years and is always talking about dying her hair but never actually does it, just like excercice. She still thinks about it all the time. What would happen if you dye your hair? Nothing, you are the same person but with a slightly different shell and you can change it back too."
fatlogic,fchvwcu,t1_fcdorjq,1577654756.0,"Funny example, picasso started painting classical and mastered that before breaking it to create his own personal art, which is more a statement than the search of perfection or realism. Dunno how to fit it in the example since most people in art just jump to picasso's style and ditch actually learning the fundamentals/use the ""but it's my style"" to justify their lack of real artistic ability and knowledge. Should have used someone with a different style to reference in your example, any romantic era painter or else."
fatlogic,fchuhpj,t1_fcaoybn,1577654284.0,"Also fasting doesn't mean you don't eat your daily calorie intake, you just do it in one sitting or two like the religious people from your example. No anorexia in there, anorexia = chronic deficit. It's not that hard to grasp really."
fatlogic,fchtt3y,t1_fcggtnr,1577654051.0,"Indeed. These people seem to think it's only a problem of their country when actually developing countries have far worse rates of obesity and related health issues because they associate food with status. Everyone eats processed foods from first world countries if they can afford it and their regional traditional healthy food are deemed as undesirable because those are cheaper/make you seem poor to society. It's so sad imo, great food cultures are getting lost, young people don't learn to cook..."
fatlogic,fc9d7an,t1_fc932rc,1577550835.0,"Had the same problem going keto to fight early onset of fatty liver, idiots just assumed I wanted to be thin when actually I just didn't want cirrhosis. Lost a friend too because me losing weight made her insecure about herself and took it on me. Dieting brings out the worst of insecure people, it's a true test of friendship."
fatlogic,fc9cv19,t3_egr5i2,1577550680.0,"Low fat foods are crammed with artificial sugars to make up for the taste loss. It's actually pretty unhealthy, fatty acids are essentials etc. Just eat healthy and unprocessed it's not that hard c'mon..."
fatlogic,fc9c5fm,t1_fc8xes2,1577550387.0,Lifting weights burns shit calories *edit: even if it's heavy lifting* it's only useful to build muscle. For fatloss you need cardio or cut diet or both.
fatlogic,fc9ay9v,t1_fc91adn,1577549861.0,"I don't even think a size M is suitable for a petite woman. I wear S myself and I'm average height, hips of hourglass figure and fit. A medium on someone shorter has to come from being overweight no doubt, petites are xs-s."
fatlogic,fc9a4x9,t1_fc8bso1,1577549507.0,"Well he does sell the thor program but I did a thorough research of all the free information I could find about his workouts and made a weekly split of my own with those excercices. Lots of strength training and some cardio. I'm also aspie and get very obsessed with things I research deeply, that's why normal people need to pay for programs."
fatlogic,fc88x93,t1_fc7ob7q,1577529521.0,"Bet it is. My ex had a problem with cocaine and I didn't get it all. Chocolate icecream gives my brain way more pleasure signals than drugs, I could binge on it nonstop. When I cut sugars last year I was cranky like a smoker trying to quit."
