Markiplier,fdji10o,t3_elinh8,1578471721.0,Which video is this from?
TrueOffMyChest,fdjeo6o,t3_elki1x,1578467641.0,"Sadly, there are a lot of shallow scumbags out there. But nobody actually cares about those losers.

I know a woman who's over 40 with kids that's more beautiful that I could ever hope to be, and I'm almost 25. Just take care of yourself, and your looks will most likely stay with you for *at least* a few decades. 

[Yazemeenah Rossi](https://m.imgur.com/a/RCpZC) (Not actually NSFW, in the most revealing pics, she's just in a bikini ðŸ™„) This woman is 64 years old. And she's still got it. Fuck those guys."

Not just oddly satisfying,

It's cool as frick!"

AmItheAsshole,fd27hwz,t1_fd258j0,1578142898.0,"You're making a gigantic leap. So he says ""girl"" instead of ""woman"" and suddenly he has issues respecting his employees?

Grown women call men ""boys"", but you never see any hoot over that. It's just another pitiful thing to make yourself feel negative over.

Men say ""girls"" sometimes and women say ""boys"" sometimes. It means nothing."
AmItheAsshole,fd25mrf,t3_ejw7n4,1578142059.0,"NTA. He talked smack behind your back, then lied to your face, and *then* tried to shift the blame on your friend when *he* was the one running his mouth."
AmItheAsshole,fd254mf,t1_fd24tg1,1578141824.0,"Well, now they can read these comments for context."
AmItheAsshole,fd24xzs,t3_ejw276,1578141749.0,"YTA. Her condition has been hard on you? Wow. Imagine how hard it must be for her, the person who *actually has to go through it every single day*."
AmItheAsshole,fd23yjl,t1_fd23knw,1578141309.0,Obviously he has the right to his money back. My comment wasn't about that as much as it was about him not wanting his friend in the wedding party anymore because of his unreliability.
AmItheAsshole,fd23ef2,t3_ejw3gb,1578141068.0,"If your gf is fine with it, then NTA. It's really none of your mother's business."
AmItheAsshole,fd230ox,t3_ejw0os,1578140898.0,"NTA. He needs to wake up and smell the coffee. Money is for saving, not spending. You say he always has money for smokes and booze, but if he has to keep asking for money, he really doesn't. He doesn't have the money to keep up his habits, but he continues to do so anyways, and that's on him."
AmItheAsshole,fd21ty9,t1_fd20afm,1578140345.0,"My first serious, long term (3 years) relationship started when I was 15. He was my first love. 

Not saying OP is in love, but as a teenager, it can happen. There is absolutely no need to belittle someone's emotions because of their age."
AmItheAsshole,fd1yl3y,t3_ejvk57,1578138844.0,"You're not obligated to keep in contact with blood-related people that you never got to know very well. Especially if they don't consider you family enough to let you sit in the family section of their wedding (A dick move towards a *12 year old* that they're literally related to). ESPECIALLY if they care so little that they'll swoop in and take everything left of your father without considering you or your sibling. 

Not to mention they didn't care that much to see your brother for his graduation (I mean, they could have made time after?), and don't even notice your absence at a wedding, even when they invited you. I understand that some weddings are really big, but if he really cared about you *as his sibling*, he would have taken the time.

NTA."
AmItheAsshole,fd1v2d4,t3_ejvigt,1578137268.0,"NTA. Anybody who needs everybody's attention 24/7 has issues. Yes, it's generous that your college is being paid for, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't be allowed some independence."

bipolar,fcztd13,t3_ejpflf,1578108273.0,I've been diagnosed as bipolar but I mainly have lows. I don't really get manic. I'm confused tbh.

I was having suicidal thoughts on Zoloft and Risperidone and stopped once I quit taking them. I wasnt off of meds for that long."
