Fitness,fcx8e3a,t1_fcwsk0u,1578055301.0,"There are 2 GOOD reasons to drop a deadlift and it‚Äôs not to ‚Äúlook cool‚Äù
1, you are trying for a 1RM and you fail the rep. It‚Äôs pretty common to fail a rep with any other lift, that‚Äôs why there are safety bars for squat racks and safety on bench press.

2. CrossFit makes dropping weight popular for a reason. It‚Äôs competitive and you are incorporating deadlifts and Olympic lifting with cardio. Dropping weight at the top of a deadlift can save you time and energy so you can complete the workout faster. Not the best logic for overall fitness, but for pure competitiveness it makes sense."
