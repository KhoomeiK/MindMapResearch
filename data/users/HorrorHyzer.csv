roadtrip,ff8itvh,t3_es8j00,1579680460.0,"My friends and I used to take a Honda Element to Northern Ontario for fishing trips.

4 grown men all 6' tall or more, 8 days worth of luggage and fishing gear, and coolers full of food and beer. We were all able to sprawl out and drive comfortable for the entire 14 hour drive. The Element had so much leg room for everyone, it was ridiculous. The front and back seats both reclined to flat creating a bed in the vehicle. The rear seats, when reclined to flat, folded up into the side of the vehicle and created enough space to fit whatever you wanted. I've seen pictures of guys transporting motorcycles in the back of an Element. Awesome.

2.0L AWD. Great gas mileage. Smooth on the highways. Enough power and traction to handle rough inclines. We had to drive the Element across harsh gravel logging trails to get to the lakes we fished at, and even had to use it's AWD capabilities to get through some small creek beds and over fallen trees. It handled everything we threw at it with ease.

It's not a Land Rover or a Mercedes and doesn't resemble anything that looks like it could handle rough terrain and wilderness, but the Element could do it all. It's sad that Honda stopped making the Element. Their AWD technology has improved drastically since the Element was in production, but in it's heyday the Element held it's own.

If I was to buy a vehicle now to use specifically for road trips I'd find the lowest mileage and best condition Honda Element I could, and save all the extra money to travel even more."

discgolf,ff5gd3e,t3_erquu8,1579591672.0,"Some runs of discs, (First Run, Second Run, PFN, Patent Number, etc) are more sought after than some of the newer runs. This all boils down to preference. Some molds have changed slightly. Some people prefer the feel of older plastic (gummy Star, Stiff and Pearly Champion, etc) as well. As these discs become older, they are harder to obtain and therefore the value increases on them over time.

In the case of the Sexton Firebirds, I believe the older runs (2015 & 2016) were not produced in as high of a quantity as the 2018 or 2019. It seemed like Innova was releasing batches of 2019 for months after the initial release. With how many of the 2019 Sexton Firebirds were produced, I do not see them holding as high of a value 4 or 5 years from now like the 2015 or 2016 did."

discexchange,ff4sxw2,t1_ff4rfdr,1579571687.0,1 is field tested and the other is 7/10. Both have ink. Probably $10 for the 7/10 and $15 for the newer one. With shipping probably $30 for both.

discgolf,ff3aroz,t3_ere3w5,1579537556.0,"To elaborate on those who have mentioned the Gator.....

You will get fairly different flights depending on what Gator you are throwing.

Example, I have 2 Scott Withers color glow Gators. One is flat, but has a very slight rise in the shoulder of the flight plate before becoming flat. It is overstable, but does not ""hook up"" or fade out right away. It does have some forward penetrating glide before it fades left hard thrown RHBH.

I have another one of the exact same disc that is board flat/semi puddle topped. It will not go straight. It wants to fade left the second is comes out of my hand. It is so overstable that it almost can't even be used on a flex shot. I also have flat/puddle topped Gators from the Factory Store glow run that are the same way.

What I'm saying is that the Gator is probably what you are looking for, but if you want that true Zone overstability you will need to find one that is very flat, or puddle topped.

I would provide pictures as an example BUT the first Gator I mentioned is actually in the bottom of the pond at Trinity Links Disc Golf Course in Lockport, IL :("

discgolf,fe0874s,t3_eninns,1578805691.0,"It really depends on the disc. Example: Discmania PD2 in glow is less stable than other plastic types. The Discmania CD2 is more stable in the glow plastic verses other plastic types. It really depends on the manufacturer and the disc itself to be honest.

I prefer glow plastic because of the feel of it and I enjoy the way it breaks in. Not as fast as S Line but slightly faster than C Line.

It varies from company to company and disc to disc though."
