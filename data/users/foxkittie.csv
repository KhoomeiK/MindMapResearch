Losing your cat is like a piece of you disappearing. When my 17.5 year old cat died, I felt so alone. He was my companion. We were in love. You have my congratulations and deepest sympathy. It does get better."

IOPsychology,fdqkmkc,t1_fdq3k26,1578668948.0,"I wholeheartedly agree. It also depends on the individual hiring. Because even within an industry, the hiring person can have their own preferences and full autonomy in instituting them. I know that my husband would not hire someone who has stretched out their ear holes really big and has a bull type of nose ring along with a bunch of tattoos. It isn't professional to most of us gen-xers or probably a huge majority of boomers. I can't imagine any of the silent generation looking on it favorably or being able to ignore it. I also would not go to anyone who looks like that for any type of counseling or life coaching services."

CatsAreAssholes,fdqk1hn,t1_fdqgq9a,1578668553.0,I ruined my cat with an automatic cleaning litter box. she started out where every poop was covered to the point that she covered the other cat's poop because he didn't. The dumb automatic litter box broke and is hundreds of dollars. needless to say I decided to not take up a gigantic portion of my room with a huge litter box that is really loud. She now is one of the wall scrapers. She will scraping the wall for a good five freaking minutes and do nothing. but she hates dirty litter boxes so each time she goes I have to wait until she's done scraping the wall and then scoop it.
CatsAreAssholes,fdqju7t,t3_emlgi9,1578668418.0,Wow. That wow is for the person who took the picture number one and then number two the cat who s*** on the rice.who watches a cat get ready to take a s*** and some rice and decides to take a picture of it instead of instantly and automatically trying to stop it? That cat will never learn. you got to stop that right away instantly with lots and lots of yelling and loud hand clapping and scooping the cat and putting them in the litter box.
CatGifs,fdqjmoo,t3_emqdt5,1578668277.0,I have an indoor white cat with long hair. She begs to go outside and when we do allow it she instantly flops down in the first dirty place that she can find and she rolls and rolls and rolls to get super dirty. She then comes inside extremely happy we're magically within a couple of hours she is back perfectly White. I'm not sure if she likes the rolling so much she doesn't mind getting dirty or she likes to eat dirt. Maybe it's both.

Anthropology,fdfzhha,t3_el0cn6,1578374673.0,It is a war crime. I think he said it to draw attention away from the impeachment and away from that terrible military officer he pardoned. He says something controversial every time he wants to distract the public. We have become so accustomed to his racist remarks that he had to go bigger.

NoStupidQuestions,fd9njbq,t3_ek78p8,1578235649.0,"What frustrates me is that hairstyles do not 'belong' to one culture if you consider Time. Many races over the ages have done what is now called cornrows, dreads, etc. 

Two 22,000 year old Venus statues have cornrows, ancient Egyptians, Vikings and more commonly had cornrows, too

Cultural appropriation isn't real, IMO. (Disrespect is, though. Such as making them Halloween costumes, or altering sacred outfits to be sexy, etc. ) No culture is static. No culture is unaffected by others around it, either. Consider the spread and changes that happened to Buddhism as it moved out of India, into China, then Japan. Cultural integration of customs, clothes, food, ideas and hairstyles has been happening since humanity traveled in small hunting and gathering tribes.

I agree: It is maddening that a hairstyle is seen as acceptable when used by a people that do not currently commonly use it, but looked down upon when used by a people that have been using it commonly today... But this is how general society starts to accept anything, those in power do it and then the public change their minds... and it is a good sign that we, as one society, are heading in to the right direction.

The way white people in positions of power have given grief over a hairstyle used predominantly by black people in modern times really has nothing to do with the actual hairstyle. It's racism. And those people would have found something else to be racist about even if it wasn't the hairstyle. And racist people, when cornrows become accepted, will accept the hairstyle and still be racist. I agree that that is also another reason to be frustrated. But to call it cultural appropriation I still don't think is appropriate. Looking at this from a purely cultural anthropological standpoint, to me, there is no such thing as cultural appropriation. There are deeper underlying society issues at play. We should not be stopping on the surface in order to correct the problem. The use of the term 'cultural appropriation' takes the focus away from where it should be.

Me: white, female, 40s, with a cultural anthropology minor and decades of active learning about today's cultures and religions around the world and their histories. I know I wasn't asked for my opinion, but hope there is room for me to express myself on this thread. I do not intend disrespect for anyone else's opinion or experiences. Being who I am, I know my ideas come from an academic place where I have not endured the hardship of being black in America."
