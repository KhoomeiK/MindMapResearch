I think she burned bright, but Kykar will be more popular long term. Plus we are going to get a lot of commander products this year, and any sort of Spell slinging commander in Blue, white or red combination can give people pause before building her.  With commander being pushed this year, I don't see a lot of upside, and rather than investing in her, I would wait till we get info on the next sets and next commander products and see if you can do anything for them."

Face commanders are rarely the expensive part of a deck. Generally speaking with the commander products, if you want to make money you buy the upgrades for the individual commander, or try to predict the card in each deck that will spike and want to be in every deck ever.

The thing about rings are, they won't stop someone from cheating. There are enough people out there who don't care if you are married, that I probably wouldn't have a problem cheating even with a ring on, and even if they did care, there is nothing stopping me from taking it off to meet with a woman, and put it on before I get home.  

At the end of the day it is about trust.  Trust that I won't cheat on my spouse, and trust in my spouse that if for some reason I have my ring off, I have a good reason for it.  If you can't trust your spouse about their ring, there are probably issues and reasons for that that need to be worked through.

I realized that a few people in our group have been going a bit overboard on crazy mana and card draw, and have throw Narset, dampening sphere, and underworld dreams into a few decks recently to help keep people honest.  They don't keep you from playing the game like some stax stuff so they don't get hate from the whole table, they just keep you honest.
The other day, after adding this to a few decks, my buddy dropped cabal coffers for his land that turn.  Made me the hero of the table.

Alongside that, I see a lot of people worried about nyxbloom ancient, but honestly, at that mana cost it isn't really any more scary than other late game drops.  Sure it can give you crazy amounts of mana, but you still need things to do with that mana, or ways to draw cards.  I am not saying that it isn't a good card or anything, but honestly I just wouldn't look at it as anything other than a good value late game threat."

You could find deals on black Friday and get a copy of the program so it dropped the federal cost down, but state was still included. I think they also just got in trouble recently either flat out lying, or burying the free options under a bunch of stuff so that people that did qualify for it didn't know they did.  On top of that as your are doing your taxes, it seems like every other screen there is an offer for their premium protection, or other BS services. It takes almost twice as long because you have to cancel out of a screen every time you go to a new section. 

When I did free tax USA last year, I got through all of it, and then the final page they gave you your filing options. I think it was like $20 to efile for both the Fed, and State. Then there was one screen after that that asked about some offer.  I can't remember what exactly it was, but I think it was maybe an offer to allow you to refile through them if there is a change in the tax codes after you file. No hassle or any of that.

I mean what are you waiting for.  Star buylisting now at 1.50-2. That is a healthy bit of profit on it. You will never be able to unload all 100 at the same time, so start banking some profit.

I wish I could get my wife to do this. I feel like her doing this will help her to realize exactly how much she is spending. Sure it doesn't seem like much when you spend 15-30 dollars at a store, but when you bounce between 3-5 stores in a single trip out it really adds up. I also think her having to put it in will eventually get her thinking more about what she is actually purchasing as things go in her cart."
