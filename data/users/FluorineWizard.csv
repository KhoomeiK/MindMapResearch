The author of the blog post that triggered this incident found a *provably unsound* piece of unsafe code that was in fact exploitable, and offered his own, simple patch which was rejected for no good reason.

The actix maintainer has a history of not caring about safety guarantees or the practical aspects of using his software in general. This is the third incident.

There is no point in publishing a project if the author doesn't warn others that he cares more about maintaining creative control over his toy than actually providing something fit for outside use. Even what is given away for free engages the social responsibility of the creator.

If the users aren't entitled to the author's work, then the author is not entitled to the attention from being featured prominently in benchmarks. The techempower benchmarks are intended to provide valuable comparisons between working solutions, is it okay to pollute the results knowing you don't intend your work to actually be useable ? I haven't seen any ""don't rely on this please"" disclaimers from them.

""Just audit and fix everything yourself"" quickly becomes intractable and defeats the point of foss. It also doesn't fix the fact that someone is publishing and advertising unreliable software.

I understand that this kind of analysis is valuable, I just don't think it's the correct solution to handling of optional or result types.

Those can be handled syntactically. Any case where you want to use a fallible unwrap without it being trivially provable on your end is likely to defeat a static analyser, so IMO there's not much added value here. If in doubt, pattern match.

Java's implementation of Optional is terrible and defeats the point.

Hell even languages like Java and Javascript will have seemingly-equivalent expressions that JIT differently.

It's a fundamental limitation of relying on optimising compilers."

Normals are a lot worse than ranked. If you get used to playing ranked every day, even Flex, going back to normal draft is awful."

I swear low Elo junglers refuse to account for that and expect their teammates to throw their lanes to help them secure a couple camps.

It's just as bad as laners who expect the jungler to win their lane for them."

Don't get me wrong, Marx was wrong about a number of things, but from experience 90% of the criticism you hear is either anticipated and refuted in Marx's own writings (meaning one would have to account for Marx's answer too), or straight up bad criticism.

An interesting question would also be to ask why the Americans who make up most of reddit are so entrenched in a superficial understanding of neoliberal dogma and straight up ignorant about most political topics. Not that my fellow Frenchmen and Brits fare *that* much better, but still."
