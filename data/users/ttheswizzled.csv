Trying2conceive,ffb9zpd,t1_ff5zor2,1579756785.0,"Ya, it’s been a long heart breaking process, we stopped hoping for awhile and let it go. But we’re back on track to being hopeful and praying for a miracle. I know it’ll happen one day just like it will for you!"
Trying2conceive,ff5kle2,t3_eg90kg,1579597372.0,My boyfriend and I have been trying for 4 years. I absolutely feel this. Every month I get excited even though I know it’s going to be negative or I’ll get my period. But you just gotta shake it off and keep trying. At least the trying is fun!
offmychest,ff5jlbi,t1_ff5j8c5,1579595930.0,"I have, I want to start small though. I wanna do a big sister type thing so I can help others but not have to associate it with assault until I have something actually helpful to offer."
offmychest,ff5iyne,t1_ff5ior9,1579595047.0,"I started therapy soon after, I’m in the middle of switching my insurance over states so I can go back."
offmychest,ff5ilfs,t3_erorsn,1579594548.0,You’re amazing and I’m glad mf. Casual hookup showed you that there’s still some good ones out there!
pregnant,ff5h6td,t3_erqe93,1579592703.0,Congratulations on your healthy little one!
Trying2conceive,ff5943l,t3_en2zd0,1579583937.0,Girl same. I have an entire box of wine in my fridge now after this negative.
Trying2conceive,ff590ta,t3_epu7x0,1579583852.0,You’re not crazy in the slightest. I’ve always been the same way. I had this fantasy of being a mom since I was young. I began trying at literally 16 and am 22 now with no babies. Thank god for the sake of 16 y/o me but I completely understand your feelings. When there’s not even a scare you start to feel pretty hopeless. Especially when it’s something you want so badly. But when the time comes and you both agree you want kids there’s so many options even if it’s harder or takes awhile. I hope the best for you and your motherhood journey!
JUSTNOMIL,fe7buzu,t3_enwdnz,1578912519.0,Wow your whole situation sounds almost exactly like mine. But my FMIL is just a little bit better than yours it seems... my FSIL on the other hand is probably 10x worse than yours. Glad y’all are getting a lawyer and standing your ground!
Advice,fdpyzeo,t1_fdpyfxv,1578646678.0,I have in some ways and haven’t in others. My issues stem from the self blame. I have a hard time not blaming myself for it and I feel like I should hate the act I was forced to do but I don’t. I actually enjoy it with the right person and it causes me to try to act like it must not have been that bad if I can still do said act. But in most ways I have.
Advice,fdpydwm,t1_fdpxxlw,1578645871.0,I have been verbally about it but the issue is becoming how badly I freak out sometimes. I’m having a hard time figuring out how to keep calm and I guess that’s made my past partners feel bad. I’d just really like to learn how to calm myself down more easily.
JUSTNOMIL,fdpxk31,t1_fdl0l2o,1578644764.0,We’ve agreed on that one that’s for sure. I just want to make her tantrum as little as possible and couldn’t figure out which one would do that. In the end we’ve decided she’s going to throw one no matter what and it’s best if he’s not there for her to do it.
JUSTNOMIL,fdpxhjp,t1_fdk1110,1578644671.0,I know but damn sometimes I wish I could!
JUSTNOMIL,fdpoinz,t3_emfes3,1578634688.0,Go you girl! It’s an amazing feeling when a JNMIL finally shows their true colors. Sucks that they have to be that way but it’s so much worse when no one else sees it. I lucked out cause my future MIL showed her true colors quick and my FH and I are on the same page. Glad you and your DH can be too!
JUSTNOMIL,fdox05o,t1_fdkpc8z,1578614801.0,"I love that for you! I’m glad your parents came around and I really hope his will also. In a crazy turn of events she actually spoke with me while me and my BF were on the phone together. It’s starting to look up a little bit at least. Ive talked to him a lot more about it and she’s probably going to find out but we’ve decided to negotiate and remind her well still be up for the holidays every year. If she can’t handle that we’re going to take another posters advice and rescind contact if she goes too crazy about it. I’m a lot more at ease about it after talking to my dad. He reminded me if him and I can fix our broken relationship then me and my FMIL should at the very least be able to put our differences aside for the sake of my BF and any future kids. 
But ya we know it probably won’t happen quickly as we had previously tried for a year to no success. Then I went through a pretty traumatic event and we decided to stop for awhile so we could work on my mental health instead. We’ve just now decided to start again but know it will probably take awhile."
JUSTNOMIL,fdk7x6r,t1_fdjzh4y,1578498116.0,He can without a doubt. He’s mostly accepted the fact that she has narcissistic tendencies. I’m just worried our decision to have kids and watching them with my family is gonna upset him and make him wish things were different. I’m worried he’s going to cling to her and quit seeing things the way they are. As of right now we’re under agreement that our kids won’t be left alone with his mom ever because of her lack of boundaries. But watching their relationship with my mom who we’re both very close to might make him second guess that. I don’t want him turning on me simply because it looks like I’m favoring my family when in reality his mom and sister are downright awful with kids and I don’t trust them as far as I could throw them. My stance won’t change but if his does it would definitely cause rifts in our relationship. Sorry I know I’m rambling it’s just a lot and he thinks I’m overthinking everything simply cause even deciding to try is a huge step for us.
JUSTNOMIL,fdk6zkg,t1_fdjuuw5,1578497507.0,"I’d much quicker get a restraining order than deal with her for much longer. 4 years is just about enough for me. I just know it hurts him a lot that she can’t put herself aside for him. I don’t want his mom getting in our heads. I know she’s gonna pull the “she’s keeping me from my grandkids” bit. She has a really good way of making everything my fault. His sister isn’t much help but she’s definitely not going anywhere near any child of mine either. My biggest thing is I truly want her being a part of his and our kids lives but not with the way she is now. I don’t want them feeling abandoned by half their family. I’m worried him not telling her he’s leaving or properly saying goodbye is going to make it worse. Make her resentful. She’s the type that with enough resentment would without a doubt trash talk me to my kids. I.e “if your mom loved me or liked me more maybe you could see me more often.” Rather than admitting she just doesn’t make enough effort and wants you to pick up the slack. If it got that far she would literally never see my kids again and I stand by that. I mean hell she slept with the guy I slept with the first time me and her son broke up. They were friends, like really good friends. (I hadn’t known that at the time but it was a year after me and she knew the entire situation)"
JUSTNOMIL,fdjy9fz,t1_fdjq93k,1578491242.0,I just worry because I know my mom and family will be very active in ours and our kids lives and he doesn’t really have anyone but her. I’d hate to see her ruin their relationship and never have one with his kids..
