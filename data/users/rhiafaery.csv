bulletjournal,fclb5ru,t3_ehpfdc,1577743779.0,"I'm afraid the bullet journal I'm just starting for the first time is going to end up full of incomplete things, so I empathize with you so hard. I like the extra color for missed days idea. I may incorporate something like that for myself. I don't have much advice other than try to let it go and remember that nothing is perfect, including you, and it's not a reflection of your worth, but a reminder that you are a reflection of the imperfect universe. 💕"

AdviceAnimals,f48j6ea,t3_djlhvw,1571440281.0,"Same. I've never had a really close friend in my entire life. I've always just been on the periphery of friend groups, and eventually get tired of trying to fit myself in where I don't feel wanted, so I fall away. Right now I have literally no one.  I'm beginning to wonder if I either have no idea how to make/maintain friendships, or if I'm actually a crap person that no one wants to be around. 

It sucks. I feel for anyone/everyone in a similar space. <3"
