I will give you one last chance to actually respond to my points, and if you just ignore them again, I won't bother replying.

>Coming from you, I suppose I should interpret this as a compliment

Assuming you're intelligent enough to not say something stupid? Well, sure, how can you interpret it any other way?

Well, duh, you got offended at me knowing you wouldn't say something stupid when I pointed out that you might.

>Easy! Just two sentences ago, you suggested that I don't have a brain!

No, actually, I apologised for talking to you like you had one.

>Do you not understand how quotes work?

Don't you understand how paraphrasing works? Or hyperbole? Don't get this mired down in the exact words, because that's just a derailment technique to get us  talking about minutiae instead of the actual subject, which is: you responded to me by asking  if I thought ""there was no valid criticism of TLJ"" when all I had said at that point was that you were doing exactly what OP complained about. Nobody up until that point had said TLJ was perfect and not deserving of any criticism - just that the criticism levelled at it was overblown. If you seriously thought that anyone at that point said there were no legit ciriticism it deserved, you need to learn to read. As it stands, I'm certain you were (and are) just trolling.

>Well, at least you have the self-awareness to admit you're a troll

Mmmmnope... Never said I was a troll. I called *you* a troll. Come on, you can do better than this.

>Weird, I didn't notice any respect from you at all.

Considering I've actually gone to the effort of arguing with you seriously, point-by-point, and taking your comments at face value, yeah, it's more respect than you should expect.

>This coming from the guy that returns to a pointless argument 4 hours later to get the last word?

Mate, I was hanging out with a friend. Sorry I didn't ignore him and instead talk to your sorry ass the whole time.

>Hope your day gets better, man. I can tell its been a rough one for you.

Thanks for the very transparent attempt at condescencion; it really makes it obvious you're not worth the time. I'll just drive this home one more time: your next comment better actually have some substance to it and attempt in some way to address my points, or else you'll just justify my suspicion that you're a troll."

>Yes, you are allowed to attack me and insult me for my opinions. 

Show me one instance of where I actually insulted you, instead of your points.

>Once again, you misquote me to make a point. 

Nope, you literally responded to me asking if I believed there are ""no valid criticisms of TLJ"". Sure, I was hyperbolic in my quote, but the tone is there.

>If you're done having a complete meltdown now

Omg you're hilarious. As if this actually affected me emotionally at all. I just like poking trolls.

After going through your comment history, it's clear that you do this kinda shit all the goddamn time. You're even here in this thread calling TLJ fans narcissists and ""the worst kind of fan"". You also called it a deliberate plot to destroy Star Wars.

So yeah, I take back every ounce, every *gram* of measured respect I gave to you in taking your comments seriously. You're clearly just a troll looking to start arguments."

And there you go again. Strawman after strawman. You're allowed to ask questions. But I'm also allowed to state how pants-on-head dumb they are.

MovieDetails,fez9i0x,t1_fez5wyo,1579455058.0,"> So you're saying that reddit user gets to decide which complaints are legitimate and which ones are ""petty""? 

No... Just that it's obvious from the kinds of complaints we see, that the only issues people have with the film are issues that make them look like idiots if they admit it outright. I've literally seen people complain that Holdo has pink hair, FFS.

>I never said ""it is objectively bad"".

No, they're just saying that their actual complaints would seem petty, so they'd rather clutch at straws.

>Why are you trying to put words in my mouth? 

I'm not. I literally quoted you. You think it deserved every bit of criticism it got, and the criticism it got makes it sound like an objectively bad film.

>Seriously man, what is your problem. You're acting like you're some kind of Opinion Police. Are you going to arrest me for having my own opinion?

Actually, no, they didn't say that at all. They said the internet didn't receive the film they were hoping for, and were looking for any and all minor criticisms to blow out of proportion in order to tear it down, and that many of these criticisms were just plain untrue.

And this was in response to *you* claiming it ""deserved all the criticism it got"" - i.e, claiming it is objectively bad. The only one trying to be the arbiter of its objective quality here is *you*.
