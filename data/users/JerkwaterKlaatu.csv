As they easily had the most entertaining dynamic between one another, they’d be utterly batshit to cut him out of future stories. If Buttercup’s not in s2, ima riot."
witcher,fecwzzp,t1_fecwm7z,1578987999.0,"Because the show is only loosely following the books. Mousesack didn’t play that big of a role in the books like the game did. There’s quite a few other lil tidbits that are missing or just straight up changed. Couldn’t specifically say as to why they did what they did with him, just know that I really liked him and hope there’s someway he’ll be back. Possibly flashbacks when Ciri was chillin in Skellige."

witcher,fcnn1gb,t3_ei5x0c,1577814599.0,"He does attempt to “fight” stregebor in the end, but stregs rallies the town against him. You gotta keep in mind, wasn’t long ago the Witcher’s were nearly all slaughtered due to fear and bigotry. So Geralt couldn’t retaliate against stregs without furthering the stigma against mutant monster-killers. 

As for him killing Renfri, they were going to kill every last person in Blaviken until Stregs surrendered. Both his conversations with Renfri and Stregebor were changing his current view on evil. Also gotta keep in mind Geralt is still relatively young and was trained to neutralize the immediate threat. So having been influenced in his decsion, he chose what he felt was the lesser evil, as he’d be vilified for any action or inaction either way with perhaps a slight hope the people would see his actions a bit more differently than the girl he saved when killing his first “monster”. Sadly, he realized he didn’t choose the lesser evil. 

And as for prophetic abilities, can’t explain much as that was just in the show. Admittedly that was somewhat odd."
