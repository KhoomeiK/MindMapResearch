HistoryMemes,ffrl9w2,t3_euqajk,1580160363.0,I point this out every time I see this just to make sure people are aware the Bible says that the love of money is the root of all evil not money itself.

dankmemes,ffe7f8c,t1_ffe6rw4,1579838718.0,"Oh yeah you can’t just make glass out of any old sand it has to be of a certain quality or it’ll just clump and crumble. Any glass you might manage to make will be dark, brittle, basically unusable. The sand in Saudi Arabia and much of the Middle East isn’t useable for it. The sand is so bad there’s  actually a condition called desert lung that happens if you breath too much of it in. Have a coworker who’s a vet that told me about it. Nasty black stuff in his lungs as if he was a chain smoker."

bioniclememes,ff7xh5k,t1_ff7whjb,1579660679.0,Gosh man I gotta tell ya I was worried it would be like “oh wait....was this not a good game?” But I can state with confidence that the people making this game really were trying to make a good game.
