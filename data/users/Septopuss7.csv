Just to assuage your fears a bit, truck drivers (in the US, at least) have devices now that make it so they *have* to rest properly. The device ensures they are safely parked and the drive is disengaged, then it locks the doors and fills the cabin with *just enough* sleeping gas to incapacitate the trucker (and any unauthorized passengers) for 8 hours."

One actually was a bitch about it, so I offered to write her a personal check for the tips she would have made that night. She shut the fuck up real quick.
