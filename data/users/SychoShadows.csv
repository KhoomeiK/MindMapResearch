aww,ffaucue,t1_ff9vfvr,1579744691.0,You are currently at 666 upvotes so here‚Äôs one more to fight the beast
gtaonline,ff9ndvb,t1_ff9iryf,1579716627.0,"Ghilliemaster. Tests new weapons, walkthrough vids, anti grefer pvp vids, weekly sale breakdowns. Also goes by Broughy1322s vehicle testing who is the best when it comes to detailed about the cars imo"
DarkUniverse,ff26z15,t1_f941jsd,1579495585.0,"Ty! I knew that book looked familiar! Interesting that they would connect them. Now I‚Äôll have to go back and watch them to see if it can make sense, though I doubt it. 
If I remember correctly the mummies aren‚Äôt hidden from existing by the end if the first trilogy. However the 2017 movie doesn‚Äôt exactly show anyone being genuinely surprised by undead (other then the lead) or mentioning undead being impossible and a new thing in this world."
TIHI,fesakon,t3_eqf7e3,1579363269.0,Technically true
TIHI,fesaegz,t3_eqf1qf,1579363208.0,This was horrible on my eyes
news,fen4oa0,t3_epzy9y,1579276891.0,Who needed hidden cameras to figure this out?!
gaming,feiwh4h,t1_fdz02a4,1579149103.0,"Ty lol I typed out a response but never sent it. Curious what they thought I was talking about if it wasn‚Äôt lag, or some other internet speed related problem.  Who knows."
videos,fei2dhd,t3_ep4suv,1579128765.0,Wait... this is really a huge deal.
wholesomememes,fe5gw4a,t3_enoi40,1578869281.0,I‚Äôd have appreciated this as a kid
dbz,fe2ub7o,t1_fdx9rev,1578842950.0,"Also brings up the idea that they have individuality within the fusion, somehow. Doesn‚Äôt one of the gods say they fuse into a new being tho? Oh well, hero‚Äôs logic I suppose."
dbz,fe2u329,t1_fe27i2u,1578842847.0,Yeah I found the struggle with the meteor strange too. These characters are far past the point where they can accidentally destroy a planet lol I then assumed it‚Äôs made out of/held together by something more powerful like solid ki or something. The ToP arena was made from that strongest material in dragonball right? And they smash it like normal rock. Presumably a random meteor would be normal rock... but it appears from nothing so who tf knows.
gaming,fdyt7ke,t1_fdxus7q,1578783368.0,"Honestly this is the answer. I‚Äôll be getting one shot in games where I know I‚Äôm not getting one shot, passed by slower cars in races, teleported or watching people teleport. I just go, ‚Äúwell my internet sucks‚Äù  and try my best."
rareinsults,fdtlo0q,t1_fdtetbd,1578718560.0,"Yeah, no hard ‚Äúr‚Äù and using in context of a conversation of its use seems not rage worthy. I could care less about her but I was expecting way worse."
ImaginaryBehemoths,fdtgxw9,t3_ejjo0j,1578716601.0,I see at least two peens and a vageen so it makes the giger cut for me

ThatsInsane,fdodbrq,t1_fdnmdcg,1578603062.0,Lol I feel like I saw this exact post last time this was posted
gtaonline,fdn1cco,t1_fdksxjn,1578574266.0,Lol one of those ‚ÄúI‚Äôd not even be mad I died‚Äù moments that would be too funny.  This and the swarm of guys in alien morph suites comes in a close second.
pics,fdlkhxx,t1_fdkx7qy,1578526069.0,Wonder why they deleted it?! :( Many notifications I‚Äôm guessing.
interestingasfuck,fdkz7jg,t1_fdkteic,1578514200.0,"There‚Äôs an entire podcast about the landing called 13 Minutes to the Moon. It‚Äôs super informative! Tells about all the issues they had, as well as the missions leading up to it."
gtaonline,fdj2z0u,t1_fdh6as5,1578457080.0,"They should have updated the cargo (and MC stUff) to work like hanger/business battles.  You can collect them for your supply, destroying delivery vehicle  gives you packages still, and it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to be able to air drop cargo/product where it needs to go like with the hanger."
Bossfight,fdcijn5,t3_ekmfew,1578275772.0,Fine I‚Äôll take it.
gtaonline,fd63amj,t1_fd59l05,1578184956.0,"Yeah I agree, they just took a little too long for the payout and I think that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve forgot about them. Might do more next time I need some easy cash! Those missions don‚Äôt show up on the map to be griefed so it‚Äôs good for that."
gtaonline,fd51rfw,t3_ejx91b,1578173384.0,Wow I forgot about the casino work missions already.

wholesomememes,fciwxsh,t1_fciwm8g,1577671791.0,"Yeah I‚Äôve got Godzilla in hell its pretty cool, kinda disjointed but still cool. That other one is interesting too tho!"
wholesomememes,fciqfc1,t1_fcin0lk,1577667357.0,What a bizarre twist on Godzilla.
