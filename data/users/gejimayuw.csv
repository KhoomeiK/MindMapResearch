I know spring and fall semesters sometimes have more sections/multiple professors compared to one another based on the demand."
college,fezkbe9,t3_eqx8h9,1579458249.0,"As long as you take some courses that can show your abilities in math/english you usually don’t need an SAT score to transfer to a 4 year from CC. Some colleges do require you have at least a GED though, but you can easily get that during your time at CC. Advisors at your CC (if you go!) can help you figure out all the details, and disability services is a great resource as well given the medical situation. College is not at all out of your realm, it just takes a bit to get things going!"

EngineeringStudents,fdrt915,t3_emvodd,1578689431.0,"I think a lot of the students who stress for those jobs is because they don’t want to sit at a desk and do nothing. Engineering is their passion, they want to do what they love. Sure if you’re going broke and refusing a desk job because you want something more that’s a bit foolish, you need to survive, but it makes complete sense to me to work towards getting into a “challenging” position. Engineering is what they love."
college,fdq03ak,t3_emj31j,1578648215.0,"I’ve only taken classes on campus, but the idea of an online class for a gen ed is definitely intriguing since it eliminates a lot of anxiety. However I’ve heard a lot about issues with online courses, especially about it being really hard to get in contact with the professor. Clearly that’s not always the case, however I think I’d only take online if I had to. I also feel like I’d be less motivated to “go” to class. Having the pressure and responsibility of needing to get to campus on time is huge motivator for me."
college,fdm3yb1,t3_em2hfh,1578539225.0,"My professor was apparently employed a while back at a university that a shooting took place at (I’ll leave the name out). He told us he showed up that day to do work in his lab and noticed nobody was around. Turns out there was an active shooter, so he locked the door and hid INSIDE the lab fridge. We asked him if the shooter ever came. My professor said he did, broke the glass and everything, but never even knew my professor was there. Whole class was like “holy shit”, professor was like “anyways the exam is tuesday”."
college,fcw5jic,t1_fcw5dbx,1578017649.0,"Yeah, you definitely want to keep a good standing/image with him then. That sounds like a pretty solid idea for emailing if you do though."
college,fcw1w75,t3_ej7r2z,1578015231.0,"More often than not asking for a grade bump is not a good idea. However where your grade is right on the cusp and would round up it might be worth it. It really depends on the professor, just keep in mind sometimes “there’s no harm in asking” may not apply, and asking could look bad. You’re probably best to make the call cause you know the professors personality!"

college,fb6jzyc,t3_ebp14z,1576552173.0,"As hard as it is, a breakup is in no way an excuse or reason you should be allowed to submit work late. You are an adult, and I’m not discrediting how hard it is, but if you can not function you have to face the consequences. Take this and learn from it, don’t make the same mistake twice.

Unless of course you have a legitimate diagnosis from a professional, that’s a different situation! Regardless, you have to face the reality and take it and work with it, and I hope you feel better. Good luck."
