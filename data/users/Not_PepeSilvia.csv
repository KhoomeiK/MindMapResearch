He exaggerates the severity because if he doesn't, refs will ignore it (as they do).

Take a look at a recent ""exaggeration"" by a Chelsea player after a Tottenham player kicked him in the chest and balls. If he had just stood there, nobody would have seen it. But because he fell down, the refs stopped and (correctly) sent off the player.
