I've had trips last almost 20 hours just from pacing. These were not heroic doses either, so it all depends."

YouShouldKnow,ffbzv4j,t1_ffbwgcp,1579787891.0,"Eh depends how much water you put in. Honey is also naturally antibacterial because of its acidity, contains stuff like hydrogen peroxide, etc. It's not like if you add a teaspoon of water any of that is going to change, you'll just get a weaker osmotic effect

You're not ""making a home"" for bacteria (unless you fuckin douse the shit outta it), although adding water is unnecessary

E: if you fuckin drench it then of course it'll ferment. Thats how you make mead, I'm not saying adding water won't change anything, I'm saying the notion that adding water will instantly stop it from being antibacterial is disingenuous, and the notion that the only antimicrobial factor in honey is its low moisture content is an outright lie"
