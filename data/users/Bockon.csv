BlackPeopleTwitter,ffhqbk9,t1_ffdrl0m,1579948243.0,"I like how you think everyone has a choice about these things. 

No corporation is on your side, ever. Corporations are much stronger than unions these days. So, unless I am getting hired into a union job...I am never going to be part of a union. The second a manager finds out discussions of unions they start ""downsizing"" due to some made up reason or simply none at all! What a balanced system we have.

If I already don't trust people to run a business fairly then I sure don't trust the same people to run a union fairly. The same people, obviously, work for the business AND the union but not for me. So, there exists two entities that already mean more to the managers and/or stewards than a single worker."

I'm not shaming people for making good use of weed. I am shaming people for smoking cigarettes. Like, you're free to smoke cigs if you want but don't ignore the elephant in the room. We all know smoking tobacco is pretty horrid for our health. 

So, the steak analogy is flawed, sure. It is more akin to grinding up the steak and then blending it with Mt Dew and chugging it. Smoking any plant matter is probably pretty bad for you. However, tobacco is generally awful and very cruel to harvest and produce to boot."

I don't go looking to get banned from places. Like I said, one ban that I remember clearly was simply for having posted or subscribed to some other subreddit. How is that a fair rule? How do you justify me being at fault for simply using functions of the website? As for other bans, there was no reason given or the rule is based on feelings and context doesn't matter. It is also not worth arguing with the mods about. But you sure seem to need to pick bones. 

If you want to crawl through my post history and find out what happened exactly, then be my guest, friendo. I will let that speak for itself. Golden opportunity to call me out!

As I stated before, I have filtered those places out and moved on. So, who doesn't have a handle on their emotions here? Simply mentioning my experience doesn't mean I'm malingering. And a post from years ago does not stand as my current opinion."

The real answer is some mods have bad days and make rash decisions like everyone else. It just costs them a customer sometimes. Oops. Their bad. Filtered."
TrollYChromosome,ff4y9qs,t1_ff466me,1579575347.0,"If I have hurt anyone in the throes of my depression and anxiety, they have not expressed that to me. The only hurtful things that I say are usually directed at myself. I am keenly aware of when people are being an asshole so I take great strides to avoid that kind of behavior. 

With that in mind, I usually just don't ask for help anymore. Every time I ask for something the request is simply denied. Often with a completely illogical reason or none at all. Mostly, my requests for help are denied due to lack of money. Money is the only way I will solve any of my problems but no one wants to admit to that kind of answer. For instance, when I was in college, I struggled in a very important class. So, I put in a lot of extra effort seeking help only to find none. Tutors and staff available through the school admitted that they couldn't help me because ""it's been so long since I did this."" For real? I am in debt up to my eyeballs for that quality of education? So, I failed that class three times. Now I cannot continue. I cannot seek forgiveness. I cannot find a job that will pay enough to cover basic needs, let alone a loan payment larger than my rent. What was the point of going to college? To make more money. Well, that turned out to be a fucking lie. I would have been better off not going to college at all. 

With that said, maybe you understand why I feel so useless. No one relies on me. I cannot rely on others. I'm in debt that I will never be able to afford for something that is worthless. I've never had a relationship and it's not looking good in the forecast but I am still lonely. But no one wants to date broke, depressed, no family, guy. It's not a cognitive distortion to watch people lie to my face. I've been in therapy every opportunity I could afford for the last 10 years which included all through college. 

The bottom line lies with me. My expectations are far too high to be happy in this world and they are lower than some people are comfortable with. There is no help for someone like me. I don't want to feel so empty but that is how it works."

It's the blind eating the blind in these little echo chambers on the internet. I'm definitely not aligned with the weird Man-o-sphere propaganda but it has been made abundantly clear that women, IRL or on the interwebs, just don't like me specifically. 

So, I am left to wonder where I should go and what I should do with myself. No community seems to really want me around and after a while, the feeling becomes mutual."
