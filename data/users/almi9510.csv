Hamilton,fc47ry9,t3_eg2xnk,1577408916.0,"According to the fishermen in my family, it looks like that area doesn't list any specific regulations so the standard regulations for fishing in Ontario would apply - ie no salmon or trout after September. They also said that any local fishing shops would be a good bet for getting these kind of questions answered if you happen to have one near you!"
