AskReddit,feb9qdf,t1_fe8cdjw,1578956673.0,"I went caving at Devil’s Den State Park with friends, during college.  No tour guide and lots of tight spaces.  So, tight that you couldn’t move your head back and forth.  There were 3 fun parts:

1) a part with 2 walls close together to where you couldn’t turn around.  It would dead end to a part where there was a small hole near the floor.  To get through it, you had to crawl while sideways.

2) another part with walls close together.  The floor had a hole you had to go into.  The only way was to press your body against the wall, dangle your feet and slowly descend.  The bottom was only 4 feet.

3) To get out you had to crawl upwards through a hole.  It took a bit, but I always felt I was being birthed from the earth.  The sky was a dark blue at 10pm.  The reason it was because I have been in pick black darkness, with a flashlight, for at least 4 hours.

Btw, I’m claustrophobic and was fine as long as I was at the head or tail of the group.  I heard that cave is closed since it contained bats, which I did see.  They were very cute and small.  One yawned."
