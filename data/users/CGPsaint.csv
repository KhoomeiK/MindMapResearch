As for BFV, it’s a shadow of a Battlefield title. Guns, balance, and TTK aside, the vehicle gameplay just feels so dumbed down, that I’d rather just put it back on the shelf and enjoy a far superior BF game. 

That being said, I’m currently playing COD WWII to clean up the achievements, and I have to say that the online portion of this game is just downright awful. I miss the days of COD4 and Bad Company. It feels like companies are tripping all over themselves trying to reinvent the wheel."
