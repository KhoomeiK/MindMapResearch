I would think that a sufficiently catastrophic release of that much freshwater could have an impact in a relatively small period of time. Months/years versus decades.  I‚Äôm picturing 1,000 x Niagara Falls busting open and draining that body of water into the ocean over a couple of years. But again, I haven‚Äôt done the math and have no expertise or data to back up my speculation."

AskReddit,fefmf7g,t3_eondj6,1579059474.0,I drank more than that every day for five years. My strategy would be to tone down my natural inclination and try to limit myself to 12 beers a day for only a month.
news,fefm7oh,t1_fef8aci,1579059338.0,"What do you attribute that to? Serious question. Life was more bleak during the Depression and at various times throughout history. Do you all have unreasonable expectations of what life is or will be? I‚Äôm not asking that to be a dick, I‚Äôm genuinely curious about what would produce such a sense of despair in this society. It seems unreasonable to me, given the general absence of tragic circumstance."
todayilearned,feeecj5,t1_feda6xv,1579032010.0,"That isn‚Äôt true. Adding a massive amount of freshwater to certain places in the ocean over a sustained period of time would affect the ocean currents due to differences in density between saltwater and freshwater. It would change weather and climate for a wide range of places, accordingly changing their flora and fauna. This is one of the risks we face from melting sea ice and glaciers."
stopdrinking,fcah33s,t3_egskzs,1577569127.0,No reason to feel embarrassed. We all know what it‚Äôs like. We all struggle. Keep at it.
stopdrinking,fc9qh2u,t3_egm1h2,1577556658.0,That‚Äôs a big milestone that I will be crossing in a couple months. Airport layovers were a guaranteed boozing.
stopdrinking,fc9hkct,t3_egq4c6,1577552777.0,"Also a middle aged drunk who outwardly has the signs of normality and success. Been sober for a couple months now. Carrying that self-loathing is emotionally exhausting. I‚Äôm not saying sobriety is easy, but I don‚Äôt hate myself every morning anymore, I can remember what I‚Äôve said and done, and my emotional life is calm and healthy.

Put it down and leave it down, my friend. Good luck to you."

But I spent Thanksgiving and Christmas sober for the first time in over 20 years, and I‚Äôll take the trade. Will know next year that I need to make that feeling instead of drinking it."
