The premise of your argument seems to be that Trump would allow an impartial physician to make an accurate clinical diagnosis, and that impartial diagnosis would become public knowledge *and* the public would trust its impartiality. Given that Trump has had doctors [lie about his bone spurs to the government](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2018/12/27/trump-vietnam-war-bone-spur-diagnosis/2420475002/), lie about [his health being ""extraordinary""](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/385765-trumps-ex-doctor-says-trump-dictated-letter-claiming-he-would-be), and [likely misrepresent his vital statistics and weight](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2018/01/16/doctor-says-trump-is-6-3-239-pounds-and-the-internet-has-so-many-athlete-comparisons/) (worth noting that Trump tried to [reward that last doctor despite credible allegations of his misconduct](https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2019/02/03/trump-takes-second-swing-at-getting-navy-doctor-his-second-star/) which, surprise, [included mishandling prescription drugs](https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/03/politics/ronny-jackson-retires-from-navy/index.html)), how likely do you think that is? 

To me, it seems incredibly unlikely. 

This is written about a slightly different topic, but I appreciate this doctor's take on the responsibility of being clear about Trump's symptoms even without a direct diagnosis.

But this isn't a one-time occurrence just during this season. He's *always* sniffing, and it's been a thing for the entirety of his campaign and presidency.
