I'm ADHD - inattentive with chronic insomnia going back to my childhood, and a half bowl of indica and a good hot strong cup of coffee can knock me right tf out. Edit/ phrasing."
AmItheAsshole,fecd8ip,t3_eoeyij,1578971180.0,"NTA, but your wife's DD is definitely a tool. I've been taking late night cabs\uber\the bus for years, and guess what? I've been just fine. She should have been planning her alternate ride home as soon as she saw her des driver drinking. To expect you to drive and get her at 2am endangers the both of you for that trip, and presumably you the next day when you had to drive to work. Sleep deprived driving is Not Okay. ""Sleep-deprived drivers cause more than 6,400 deaths and 50,000 debilitating injuries on American roadways each year, warns the National Sleep Foundation (NSF).""

AskReddit,feccb0l,t3_eoezi9,1578970605.0,"Not to be height-ist or anything, but I generally worry less about tall dudes than I do about shorter dudes. Height aside, any dude my size (5') or taller is going to have more muscle mass and bone density than me and could potentially fuck me up. But ime, taller dudes don't as often come with the ""I've got something to prove"" baggage and are generally more chill/more cognizant of their increased spectrum of physical damage."

We are the hollow men
We are the stuffed men
Leaning together
Headpiece filled with straw. Alas!
Our dried voices, when 
We whisper together
Are quiet and meaningless
As wind in dry grass
or rats' feet over broken glass
In our dry cellar

Shape without form, shade without colour, 
Paralysed force, gesture without motion;

Those who have crossed
With direct eyes, to death's other kingdom 
Remember us - if at all - not as lost
Violent souls, but only
As the hollow men 
The stuffed men. 


Eyes I dare not meet in dreams
In death's dream kingdom
These do not appear: 
There, the eyes are
Sunlight on a broken column 
There, is a tree swinging
And voices are 
In the wind's singing 
More distant and more solemn 
Than a fading star.

Let me be no nearer
In death's dream kingdom 
Let me also wear
Such deliberate disguises
Rat's coat, crowskin, crossed staves
In a field
Behaving as the wind behaves
No nearer - 

Not that final meeting 
In the twilight kingdom


This is the dead land
This is cactus land
Here the stone images
Are raised, here they receive
The supplication of a dead man's hand
Under the twinkle of a fading star.

Is it like this
In death's other kingdom 
Waking alone
At the hour when we are
Trembling with tenderness
Lips that would kiss
Form prayers to broken stone. 


The eyes are not here
There are no eyes here
In this valley of dying stars
In this hollow valley
This broken jaw of our lost kingdoms

In this last of meeting places 
We grope together
And avoid speech
Gathered on this beach of this tumid river

Sightless, unless
The eyes reappear
As the perpetual star
Multifoliate rose
Of death's twilight kingdom
The hope only
Of empty men. 



Here we go round the prickly pear
Prickly pear prickly pear
Here we go round the prickly pear
At five o'clock in the morning. 

Between the idea
And the reality
Between the motion 
And the act
Falls the Shadow

For Thine is the Kingdom 

Between the conception
And the creation 
Between the emotion 
And the response
Falls the Shadow

Life is very long

Between the desire
And the spasm 
Between the potency
And the existence
Between the essence
And the descent
Falls the Shadow

For Thine is the Kingdom 

For Thine is
Life is
For Thine is the

This is the way the world ends
This is the way the world ends
This is the way the world ends
Not with a bang but with a whimper. --

For the fatalism and existentialism, unfulfilled dreams wrestling with apathy.
