$120 a month or something and now I pay about $40/mo for my 06 Miata. And that Miata quote was after I was in an at-fault accident in my CR-Z.

Also, why'd you sell your Si?"
Honda,ffjh2fd,t1_ffjgw5l,1579998083.0,"Definitely test drive one. They're amazing values, got mine for $5k with 90k miles on it. Spring for the EX model, nice upgrades.

My only gripe was that insurance on it sucked. Same cost to insure a Focus ST through USAA."

Would love to find someone selling a CRZ with a KA swap. I'd pay good money for that."
Honda,ffim3xf,t1_ffil7l3,1579977154.0,Man that would be a blast in these little cars. 170hp + removing the 300 lbs battery pack would have made this car perfect. Only car I've ever that I've missed.

A.) OP told her sister she could use it

B.) Her wedding was merely months away

Sounds pretty asshole-ish to me. Would have been a _HUGE_ favor for her sister to not have to worry about the $$$ of finding a dress she'll only use once. If she floated the idea and you agreed, you're kind of an ass!"
AmItheAsshole,ff4t4jl,t1_ff4s5fm,1579571812.0,"No, I'm looking at more than what OP is giving us. Obviously at some point she made her sister feel like she was going to get the dress. OP said ""yes"" to this, so much so that her sister got her hopes up.

AmItheAsshole,ff4r231,t1_ff4qbth,1579570389.0,"That's not what happened though -- OP said that her sister could use the dress.

We only ever hear OPs side of the story. And we will always try and make ourselves the victim of the story (I do this, you do this, everyone does). I'm willing to bet that the sister's question about using the dress was more than a joke. 

I had a very similar thing happen to me a long time ago. When I was 15 my dad told me he'd give me his car. Not really formal about it, just mentioned it in passing. Before I got my license he ended up selling that car. He wasn't *really* a big asshole over it, but it still stung the young me who thought I was getting it.

You can't just say things like that to people and not be at some level a dick. You have to be careful. At some point OP made her sister feel like she'd be getting a beautiful dress for her wedding and she didn't."

The big issue at Disney right now is that the new trilogy failed to capture the staying power of the original. This can be attributed to the flop of SW movies in overseas market (China).

Disney execs aren't looking at this going ""Sweet! We made a few billion this year"", they're going ""We need the Star Wars IP to continue to be popular for decades, the decline in revenue from merch and ticket sales indicate we're not capturing enough new fans to the franchise"".

Disney is HUGELY successful. They've gotten to where they are today because they don't think in 3-5 year timelines like most companies, they plan their moves in decades. The recent Star Wars missteps have them sweating a bit.

You're assuming that every booklet, every piece of plastic is recycled. Even then, that doesn't account for having to ship those finished material from China to all over the world.

There is _no fucking way_ running a server farm in New Mexico that runs off renewables is worse than shipping out millions of pieces of plastic.

You're like those boomers who share the posts on Facebook saying turbine blades from windmills can't be recycled. Checkmate greenies!!!!11

Yes, they can't. But most windmills PROVIDE more energy then they expand over the course of their 20 year life span -- in fact most of them only need to operate for a few months to break even. Focusing on one aspect of their lifecycle that isn't green doesn't paint the full picture.

Here's my quick version.

1.) The whole ""Starship Robots track you"" argument makes absolutely zero sense when you have a supercomputer that tracks your every location at all times. I can't think of any reason a three letter agency would want this info from Starship. You're recorded by 6 different angles every time you walk past a Tesla, is that infringing on your privacy?

2.) People wheeling around going 25 mph on electric skateboards are x1,000,000 more dangerous than a little robot that goes 5 mph with flashing lights. Again, makes no sense.

I will not stand for this slander against our future overlords. Praise be Enarc, Temoc, and our robot buddies."
