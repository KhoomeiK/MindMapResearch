lotrmemes,ff3emeh,t1_ff35455,1579539506.0,"You talking about the Mountain and the Viper? That's right out of Book 3 in Season 4. Things start to go off the rails in Season 5. George got a new editor between Books 3 and 4, and so Books 4 and 5 start unraveling dramatically into world building, following obscure characters for several chapters, introducing new characters/conspiracies, and what have you. They're still great to read, but they became much harder to make into a cohesive TV show of 10 episodes per season. So in Season 5, the show runners starting doing much more writing and much less adaptation, and it really shows. By partway through Season 6, they were completely off book, and by Season 7 they had clearly gotten bored and just wanted to finish it with cool action at the expense of good writing. Such a shame."

slaythespire,fenfwp3,t3_eq3dhl,1579283823.0,"You won't find meaningful tier lists of cards, which is one of the great things about this game. The relative strength of certain cards, potions, and other choices you make depends significantly on what you already have, what you're going to fight soon, and what you're going to fight further in the future. Generally, all decks need ways to deal damage quickly, ways to block well, and ways to scale up damage over several turns. As a brand new player, it can be hard to know how to value cards, but try to think of what your deck can do now (with the starter deck, that's basically nothing), what you need it to do a better job of, and whether or not the card you're considering will help with that gap in your deck's strength. Act 1 tests your ability to pivot between blocking and attacking as needed. Act 2 tests your ability to do both at the same time while scaling up (most of my deaths are in Act 2), and Act 3 tests your ability to do those things in multiple ways, as many Act 3 enemies punish you for using particular strategies. Jorbs is one of the best players, and he has some YouTube videos about how to consider card values, how to identify what your deck needs, that sort of stuff. 

Some general advice that most new players need is to grab a few attacks early that deal a solid amount of damage (anything is better than the Strikes you start with) and fight as many elites as you can in Act 1. They're tough and they hurt, so many new players avoid them, but they drop relics, more gold, and better cards, all of which are super important to getting a good run off the ground. The other piece of advice that many new players need is to not be afraid of skipping a card. In the early game, most of what you find is better than your starting deck, so you'll take cards pretty often, but if a card doesn't help your deck fix a hole it has or function more consistently, you're probably better off without it. Some people generally run thinner decks and some thicker, but I think typically a finishing deck will be in the 25 - 35 card range."
bestof,fend6ab,t1_fenbi1k,1579282156.0,"> in a feminist word it is unthinkable that there are genuinely decent men who just can't attract a female partner

Who specifically says this is the case? No one is owed romantic or sexual attention by anyone else or nebulously by some gender as a whole. If someone is putting in good faith efforts to find a partner and not succeeding, that's unfortunate, but they certainly don't deserve those things just by merit of their efforts. I don't think anyone besides incels (and certainly not feminists) is suggesting that being a ""good"" person requires or leads women to make the ""right"" choices. Women are people and have the agency to partner or not partner with whomever they want for whatever reasons they want, and those reasons will vary dramatically between women. Doesn't seem like that hard of a concept, really."
NoStupidQuestions,feji14u,t1_feitbog,1579175159.0,"Just fyi, I'd recommend meeting with a dietitian instead of a nutritionist. Anyone can call themselves a nutritionist, no matter what their training is, but dietitians have to pass licensure exams and maintain a certain set of professional and ethical standards. It's possible that the nutritionist you meet with has all the training of a dietitian but just didn't go through the actual licensure process, but you never know."
