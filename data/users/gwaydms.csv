rareinsults,fffcduk,t1_fffa85q,1579880864.0,"In 1980 home mortgage rates were *17%*. We started out in a < 800 sqft house. Found a larger house several years later with a 10% mortgage. The economy was pretty stagnant where we live so prices were still fairly low. We refinanced later with a 15-year loan at 5%, to partly pay off five figures of credit card debt. (I know, very stupid.) 

Low interest rates save you a lot over the term of a mortgage."

whatsthisbug,ffe6y8n,t1_ffe3356,1579838343.0,"They're not worthless; they reinforce *standards*. Having graduated from high school before standardized testing, I can tell you many people got a diploma who were functionally illiterate. That's what happens when you have no standards, and no way to find out if standards were met either. 

**Having said that**, spending so much time cramming for the test, to the exclusion of almost everything else, is horrible. So many children don't do anything else in their classes except study for whatever they're calling the test in Texas (STAAR, I think). It's sort of a lazy way to boost test scores instead of, y'know, meeting standards by using innovative curricula where teachers have to put actual work into keeping kids engaged. 

It's not only the teachers, either. Parents share the blame by *not*: checking for homework, making sure homework is done before screen/play time, staying in touch with teachers concerning their children's progress and conduct. Parents who are more involved in their children's education are likely to see better outcomes for their kids, not only by ""making"" them do homework and hand in notes etc, but also by letting children know their parents care."

My great-grandmother must have spoken nonstandard Polish (she, like the rest of my Mom's grandparents, was a peasant). Mom told me some of the words she had learned in her family, and a few were different from the translations in the dictionaries. 

The only one I actually know is *chrzan*. In standard Polish this means horseradish. But Busha made the relish with beets and horseradish from scratch, sitting on the porch, grating the root with tears streaming from her eyes from the pungent odor. The relish is called *ćwikła* according to Google, but she called it *chrzan*. I asked Mom several years ago if she'd heard of *ćwikła* and she said no."
