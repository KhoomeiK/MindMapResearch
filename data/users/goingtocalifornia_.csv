PoliticalHumor,fffos4j,t1_fffenxq,1579888536.0,"People growing up in the US don't really learn how our representative system of government works. We're just told voting is important and we are a grand democracy that every other nation wishes they could be. I didn't have a good understanding of the house, Senate, courts etc until people on Reddit explained it in a way I could understand.

My point is if we were taught exactly how we govern ourselves within the bounds of our constitution voting might be more attractive to the masses."
antiMLM,fff58rj,t1_ffefq40,1579876027.0,Holy cow I've got a roommate who fits that exact description. Means well but idc if you're in the middle of an exam; he'll go on and on about his youth or his favorite conspiracy theories with child like eagerness. Thanks for the idea to handle it.
HistoryMemes,ffcc4a0,t1_ffbw0rt,1579796245.0,Baltimore would like a word.

toptalent,ff6l1eu,t1_ff4h7bh,1579629468.0,You wouldn't consider her above average? She's sounds enchanting man. Imagine if she applied some professional training to her natural talent.
pics,ff6ik6o,t1_ff6h1ip,1579627958.0,Ok good advice. Yeah I've noticed people say good things about Snap On for sure

SandersForPresident,ff4tmv2,t3_erjikv,1579572161.0,Serious question: why do they keep doing this? Why not just put his name on there
confession,ff4nh66,t3_erc2dd,1579567892.0,Get professional help. False accusations like that are a serious crime.

PoliticalHumor,ff00hyx,t1_fexxu0f,1579463857.0,There's a romantic view on the Confederacy. Since power is more centralized in the federal gov now it's hard to imagine states susceeding or anything like that happening again.
OldSchoolCool,feissl6,t1_feih2uv,1579146281.0,Probably to help expose the comment to others

science,feezdzj,t1_feek02t,1579044582.0,"I wonder if marijuana usage will ever be looked at categorically like alcohol (binge smoking, social smoking etc.). Since it's inherently used differently maybe we'd use different metrics to study it?"

AskHistory,fe3ke5f,t1_fdulf9d,1578850094.0,Seriously? There's nothing wrong with his question and it has nothing to do with race.

AskHistorians,fdkcks8,t1_fdk3q2h,1578501017.0,Why are the British known for that? For some reason I had them labelled as meticulous record keepers.
SandersForPresident,fdk9tbl,t1_fdk73qc,1578499311.0,"Ok you're right, my bad"
SandersForPresident,fdk5x8t,t1_fdk3vmr,1578496805.0,I know it feels wrong in spirit but objectively he's got a point.

todayilearned,fd4eztl,t1_fd45ri0,1578166945.0,That's damn awesome. It's a great feeling to realize something's been done for you without you asking or anything. Family is great.
worldnews,fd4c76d,t1_fd3vmz0,1578166309.0,"Could someone, all jokes aside, explain why PETA has such a bad rap?"
AskHistory,fd4026q,t1_fcztnuw,1578163145.0,"Thanks for clarifying that, we needed an expert on the subject like you."

news,fd3bgs2,t1_fd36avf,1578156623.0,Damn that's an unfortunate outcome. Did you consider moving to YouTube to see if you could profit there?

BlackPeopleTwitter,fcp0zss,t1_fcov0go,1577847161.0,"Right, like can someone legitimately answer that? Maybe we don't realize how great of a producer he is or something."
funny,fcp0rgp,t1_fcowzg6,1577846964.0,I see but what I don't understand is why wouldn't they want them bred to pass on those good genetics and grow their business?

todayilearned,fcio81j,t1_fcignr1,1577665969.0,I thought ED was when the state wants your land. A private company can get land through that?
lastimages,fci3f0l,t1_fcecao9,1577657297.0,"I agree with you, however the murdering rapists in OP's example seem to have gotten in way less trouble than their crime calls for. Yes I'm American, but still sometimes people should be spending a while in prison."
oddlysatisfying,fcc4eoq,t1_fcc1q59,1577594286.0,The techniques to cook are scientific but the way you apply them to create styles of food or cater to individual taste is art. Knowing what skill to use in what context comes from experience. Just my opinion and experience.
lastimages,fcbx4fe,t1_fcbfwik,1577591945.0,"Curious: does their lenient sentence upset you, as a Dutchman?"
