You’re absolutely right that the uncapped policy is a strategy to remove payroll liabilities from balance sheets, which is one reason why I’m encouraging people to use the time off.

This trend has also led some companies to implement a “you must take two weeks off a year” policy. I find that to be an improvement over the status quo of 10 days PTO for everything until you’ve worked there 5 years.

Don’t let your company abuse you. If there is an “uncapped” PTO policy plan to take 4 weeks off and if you get sick or need a day to take care of your family, take that off as well.

Make them be draconian. If they decide to be draconian negotiate and weigh your options.

Excellent now we’re on to the whataboutism. The clear and present danger in the United States is Donald Trump. That is correct. The New York Times agrees that the PRC is murdering Uyghurs in concentration camps. Do you think the NYT supports Trump?

The crimes of the current US administration don’t have anything to do with the PRC’s.

Then you are naive. The United States is a Republic subject to popular vote, with extreme amounts of local control. While the federal government is in crisis as it wrestles with how the two party apparatus has usurped the constitution, and the “migrant crisis” shows just how quickly the US could fall, this is not the same thing as a one party regime whose leader just declared himself President for life while actively exterminating ethnic minorities.

What are you talking about? The propaganda during WW2 was astronomically more focused on the Japanese. If you’re talking about today, what does Japan have anything to do with the PRC’s war crimes? I brought up the defunct Japanese Empire to dismiss your idea that mass genocide in Asia is “unrealistic” in modern times.

Oh so now “mass genocide” is the required qualifier? Do you know what it looks like when even 5% of the population is killed? It’s genocide.

There is nothing far fetched about the Chinese government having concentration camps (fact, they do) in order to commit genocide (fact, they admitted to it) and as an add on effect harvest the organs from individuals who die in said camps (supported by evidence).
