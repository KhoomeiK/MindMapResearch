relationship_advice,fcxu7mm,t3_ejgink,1578070564.0,"I am the very opposite situation at 6'2. Height does not mean anything. It's just a number and you can't change it, so you'll have to accept it. If other people don't its their problem! If guys don't like you because of it or people make fun of you, it's their problem they are so superficial. That has nothing to do with you. I think with time you will come to accept yourself and you will find that there are actually boys who like you for you. I learned this being a very tall girl!"

introvert,fcv8ciw,t3_eiz69m,1577996756.0,"I get where you all are coming from, but i actually kinda like this article. The idea of trying new abd different things can be good every once in a while. Not to change being an introvert, or stop doing introvert things, but just to try new things that you're not used to but might actually be nice. Like a person who is always surrounded by people could try to be alone sometimes."
