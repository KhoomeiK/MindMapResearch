Is it possible that your product is coordinating the zinc as well?"
Chempros,ff25dsd,t1_ff1vtyk,1579494275.0,Protip fro removing Ph3PO - it complexes strongly with zinc salts to make a pretty insoluble precipitate.

I feel like it would ruin the sheer absurdity of the night shot (the one they shot in the day and then just color corrected the crap out of to make it blue), which just works *so well.*"
todayilearned,fdlch7w,t1_fdktvh6,1578521075.0,"And the *color*. Everyone about that time was making fun of every action movie ever for being in brownscale, and then super early on in this movie you have those gorgeous aerial shots of the colored smoke flares, and then later on you have that shot of Furiosa's arm falling off in the hypersaturated desert... it looked straight out of a graphic novel (because in certain regards it was)  


And the world-building. And the dadaist dialogue that still somehow manages to move the plot forward. And the cinematography. And the effects...  


I went to watch it with a friend who wasn't interested initially. He wound up seeing it five times in theaters (I only got three). It is flat-out my favorite movie."

OrganicChemistry,fdf5bzy,t3_el2ac4,1578353662.0,"Believe it or not, this is actually the same mistake repeated four times. You're treating organic chemistry as a series of facts you're supposed to know, rather than as a network of concepts you're supposed to understand. When you re-take organic II, try focusing on the core underlying concpts. Think of the reactions as examples of those concepts rather than the concepts themselves. Draw connections between the different concepts in this class and organic I. You still need to memorize some things, but for instance with mechanisms see if you can just draw the mechanism on your own without having to look it up - not from having memorized it, but from being able to figure it out.  


Also, there's a good number of chemistry subreddits here devoted to helping students. The people who post that are very helpful and very nice (to people asking questions - we can be less nice to people giving wrong answers)."
chemistry,fdf3nou,t3_ekzgpi,1578352566.0,There's a number of options - but honestly something we should ask is what it is you intend to do. Some suites are better suited/better optimized for certain applications than others.
chemistry,fdf3iam,t3_el1onx,1578352471.0,"It's probably reasonable enough. It would make more sense if the cigarette was extinguished, otherwise the dude smelling it is probably going to have a bad time, too. In fact, I'd be more worried about health effects on the dude than if they could smell it.  


So, if your question is ""could you dose the cigarette high enough to kill someone when ignited and that person breathing through it but dilute enough so that you can smell it without dying when not lit"", the answer is probably yes. Also, being able to smell cyanide is genetic, so you have a possible plot thread there (did the killer know that she couldn't smell cyanide for some reason?). In addition, cyanide poisoning doesn't have too many chronic effects, so your detective - if they stayed safe from the acute toxicity - would be just fine.  


Feel free to reply and ask any other questions you have. This is fun!

chemistryhelp,fdc6ils,t1_fdc6fsg,1578268067.0,"Okay, so did you follow my explanation?"
chemistryhelp,fdc66he,t3_ekkve0,1578267882.0,"If you take the concentration of something in molarity, and multiply it by the volume, you get the moles of the thing, right?

So:

C \* V = n, where C is concentration (in molarity), V is volume of solution (in liters), and n is the number of moles of solute.

All of the moles of hydrochloric acid that we have in our final, dilute solution will come from our initial, concentrated solution, right? Since we're just diluting concentrated acid with water (from a safety point of view, we add the acid to the water and not the other way around, but the math is the same either way), and since the water we're using to dilute the acid doesn't have any HCl in it, it stands to reason that we need to add enough concentrated HCl solution to have the right number of moles in our dilute solution.

Let's let n be the moles of HCl.

For our **d**iluted solution,  
Cd \* Vd = nd  


For our **c**oncentrated solution,  
Cc \* Vc = nc

Since we know that all the moles of HCl in the dilute solution come from the concentrated solution,  
nc = nd

Substituting with our equations, we get  
Cd \* Vd = Cc \* Vc.

Which of these numbers do you know, and which do you need to solve for?"

chemistry,fcwbhmg,t1_fcw5736,1578021561.0,"It's a growing field, especially when it comes to machine learning and chemistry. It's also flexible - there's a lot of fields that benefit from it, and the stuff you learn in it can be generalized to other fields (even non-chemistry) as well. The number of jobs in it right now isn't necessarily the most important metric to consider. As for the actual number of jobs, I don't know where OP lives / would like to live and I'm not doing a job search for them. I'm pointing out a field they might want to consider if they want to stay in chemistry.

It also doesn't involve being in a wet lab (for most computational chemists)."
chemistry,fcvx3fc,t3_ej0n1o,1578012072.0,"Someone's mentioned orgsyn, and that should be your first choice, especially if you need very specific, very precise directions.

[https://www.organic-chemistry.org/namedreactions/grignard-reaction.shtm](https://www.organic-chemistry.org/namedreactions/grignard-reaction.shtm) for what you're looking for, I guess?  


Beyond that, though, your best bet is probably to do a structure search in SciFinder to try and find a similar reaction someone else has done, and then go from there.

sciences,fcspn3a,t3_einbik,1577921929.0,"Since nobody's answered the question -

The orbital period of a planet is given by t = 2 \* Pi \* SQRT((dist)\^3/(6.67408 \* 10\^-11 \* (mass))), where for a system like Earth and the Sun we can just assume ""mass"" is the mass of the Sun (it's more complex if we have more complex systems or if the masses are closer to equal). Also, sorry if this has weird formatting, I just copied and pasted it from an Excel spreadsheet I already have programmed (units are seconds, kilograms, and meters). Rearranging this and solving where t = 366.25 days, and the mass is the mass of the sun (1.989 × 10\^30 kg ), and then subtracting one AU (astronomical unit), we get about 302,000 km.
