RimWorld,ffhpikz,t1_ffgtjar,1579947003.0,"While the sharpness might be up in the air, the [stegosauridae](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stegosauridae?wprov=sfla1) family had some impressive spikes on it, with its tail spikes being theorized as a weapon. The [gigantspinosaurus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigantspinosaurus?wprov=sfla1) of the same family also had some ridiculous spikes on it's sides.

So just because they're herbivorous doesn't necessarily mean they wouldn't have ridiculous spikes, but the spikes/tusks/horns of these creatures usually serve a purpose (otherwise they wouldn't need to be there) and the three basic uses for such an appendage would be attack, defense, and utility.

Rhinos and elephants both use their horns and tusks to attack those that could get in their way, it should also be noted that rhinos actually grind down their horns on rocks, inadvertently making them sharper by scraping off the outer soft layer. Horns and tusks also make for good posturing, because they're as scary as Randy; the threat of them, especially attached to such a large beast, is enough to cause fear in those that would harm the beast; in elephants they also make a good barrier for it's less sturdy appendage, the trunk. As for utility, both elephants and rhinos use their tusk/horn as a digging tool, so they might lift or gather food; and elephant will also use it to dig a water hole into a dry riverbed and debark trees, a rhino will dig underground to get the roots of plants.

With this in mind we can posit some things about the thrumbo: it's horn is probably sharp from digging for the plants it really wants; considering their size, lifespan, and rarity there is a good possibility they don't get along when the player isn't there to see it, as we've no indication of a larger megafauna that would prey on it the thrumbo is most likely an apex predator on the Rim, so if it's going to use it's horn for fighting it's probably fighting another of its own species; if there were other megafauna present on the Rimworld before the humans set up their ancient terraforming project the reason the thrumbo stayed around (much like the elephant) is because it was a generalist and smart, it didn't need to overly spec into a specific playstyle, whether trees or roots or shrubs, the thrumbo can get by because it has the height to reach tall exp and the tool to reach hidden underground exp, and enough intelligence to have it make smart decisions, like not being aggressive with humans, because if you kill one more will come.

This has been my 4:00AM essay on the ecological nuance of the Thrumbo horn."
