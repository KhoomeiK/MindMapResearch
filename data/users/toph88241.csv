If you're wondering what you missed you can dig through old posts, sort by top all time, sort by top for a given time period, etc. There is no filter for those seeking fresh content to hide the repeated reposts. 

We can downvote and call out reposts so as not to reward the karma whores. Downvoting people who are attempting to encourage fresh content is backwards and counter productive to the health of the sub IMO."

AskReddit,ff30f2c,t3_erc1ft,1579530312.0,"This is a great question. 

The good news is that you can spin this no-win, socially awkward situation into something very positive. 

You don't want to hurt your friend(or SO), but you haven't had your needs met, you feel that you've given more than you've received, and you don't see progress or even hope of future progress. Guilt about hurting someone is trumping an otherwise simple decision making process. So much so that you wonder if the hurt that you would cause is a necessary evil. It might just make things worse, but at least there is a chance that things will get better in time where the current path has no foreseeable resolution.

*This is how they feel about everything* You can use this to relate to them. They feel like everything is as hopeless as you feel the situation is. Theres a good chance that the only reason they are still around is because guilt has trumped their decision making process as well, they don't want to hurt you with their suicide. They too have to wonder if just going ahead with the hurtful thing is a necessary evil to prevent further pain to their loved ones. 

TL:DR Now you can relate to your depressed friend"
