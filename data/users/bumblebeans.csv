facepalm,fef90to,t1_fef7bnr,1579051033.0,Exactly. Even too much water can be bad for you.
facepalm,fef8pok,t1_fef7wmk,1579050829.0,"Actually, there's some wisdom in it. None of the items I listed, when used in moderation and according to guidelines, will hurt the average person. If consumed in unhealthy amounts, they're terrible for you. The ingredients in these vaccines could be bad for people--but not at the prescribed dose."
facepalm,fef11a8,t1_feey7f9,1579045657.0,"Can you list the ingredients on a can of coke? How about a box of Mac and cheese? Or a piece of Hershey's chocolate?

Not knowing the ingredients of something doesn't mean it's dangerous. 

You can literally Google the ingredients to anything. Yes, I just checked. Even the swine flu vaccine."
facepalm,fef0ibu,t1_feev1mx,1579045313.0,"I think that misdirection is the best response. For example, it's highly unlikely that it was aliens at Roswell. But, in a hypothetical situation, a Russian spy plane could totally have crashed there and to keep people from freaking out unnecessarily, they misdirected by spreading a rumor about aliens. Now, anyone who questions what happened is lumped in with the crazies who believe it was aliens."

AskReddit,fdkxy81,t1_fdkweub,1578513452.0,"Yeah, the only time I've thought about Delaware in the last ??? Years was when discussing where we should register our businesses in a business class."
AskReddit,fdkwbol,t1_fdkf19q,1578512498.0,"Shit. If this was true, I'd die young. My resting heart rate is normally been 80-110.  That's at least 20 beats per minute higher than most people's. Yes, I've had my heart checked out. It's perfectly healthy. Just... Too fast. 

It actually makes exercising harder. I feel like I'm never getting enough oxygen, even when I'm breathing fine. And the pounding in my head gets a bit extreme. It's a catch 22 though. I know if I exercised more, I'd lower my heart rate, but my heart rate makes it hard to exercise."
Anxiety,fbe0hqg,t3_eco8ug,1576775464.0,"Mine happens only when I start thinking about getting ready for bed. I think a piece of it is I'm anxious about tomorrow. Like, I did today, today is known and whether it was good or bad, I dealt with it. But tomorrow, I'm not sure I can deal with what's going to happen tomorrow because I don't know what it is. Reviewing my schedule helps a little, but it can't predict interactions with people."
