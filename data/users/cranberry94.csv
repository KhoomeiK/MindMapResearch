1- their cheaper vehicles are super gay

Offensive and subjective

2- they’re slogan “best or nothing” is stupid

It’s a slogan- the advertising people know what they’re doing. That has nothing to do with the car quality. How many “Best Coffee in NYC” places are there? You’re supposed to call yourself the best. 

3- people that like them are uninformed and don’t know what they’re talking about

That’s pretty condescending and really has nothing to do with whether the cars are actually good or not. Let’s just invalidate the opinions of everyone else on the presumption that they’re airhead fanboys

4- they’re advanced technology isn’t special cause the tech is available to any car company 

Every car company touts their superior technology. It’s like beer companies saying that their beer is cold and refreshing. He didn’t even say that their technology was worse than anyone else, even made it sound like theirs was really good- just that other cars have it too

5- their engines aren’t that superior, there are others that are better

Finally he actually brings up some actual examples and facts about performance. Thank you.

Then he actually starts making some real points about reliability and depreciation

Then back to calling falling sales in more expensive models, increase in sales in more affordable models, which once again - doesn’t tell me anything about the car quality

Ugh why did I watch all of that. He mostly was just hating on Mercedes for thinking they’re the bees knees. And the only real point of substance could be summed up as “Mercedes aren’t very reliable and are able to coast on a good name to sell to people overpriced cars compared to their quality”
