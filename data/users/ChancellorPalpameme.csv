In the system we have set up, yes currently it is your right to earn as much money as possible, and I'm not in favor of taking it away, I think that would limit innovation from prolific minds, usually a small group of hyper-productive members of society create the largest and most influential innovations.

Money is a means to an end, it is a tool used to assign wealth to constructs and objects so that people can exchange goods and services. If you have enough of it, you can decide what you would like to do, which is what you mean by the statement ""things being necessary to me"".

WhitePeopleTwitter,fecjao5,t1_feae86t,1578975280.0,"Cuz the suicide rate in adults who transition is near 40 percent and that's really fucking high. I think that one of the biggest reasons that people have issues is because they try to conform to normal or traditional gender roles and that causes a lot of cognitive dissonance. I think that instead of trying to be something they arent, be it their gender biologically or what they identify as, leaves them in a weird middle ground where they can never be happy with who they are. 


Basically I've always been taught to make the best of the situation you're given, and part of that, to me, is to embrace the body you're in and to embrace the personality you have. The idea that you can ignore your biology seems incredibly dentrimental to society as a whole. I don't really have the ""right"" answer, but I dont think it's changing the hormonal chemistry of your body so drastically."

I agree with you, completely discounting the biology from the situation will only lead to more cognitive dissonance. But also, it doesnt hurt you to call ""him"" ""her"", as a respect thing. It seems pretty clear you dont have respect for him or her as a person, which is more indicative of your prejudice."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fe9uecs,t1_fe9l72o,1578941530.0,"I'm not the person that you replied to, but I think there is a case to be made that just because someone presents or prefers to present in a non-traditional way for their gender doesnt make them that gender. 


In fewer words, just because you wear a dress, grow your hair out long, wear makeup, and get called ""she"" doesnt make you female.  Biology has a huge role to play in personal identity, and to completely discount the biology in the conversation can only have bad consequences, imo.

television,fe9kwdr,t1_fe6kmg9,1578938808.0,"I'm not particularly sure how children getting sick has anything to do with free will, unless you're talking about a parent neglecting a child to the point of death, which in my opinion makes a strong case for free will (why would a god who controls everything let parents do that?)


Kids inheriting their parents sin? I'm not sure what you mean by this either, but debt is a human construct and has nothing to do with god. 

The fact that every civilization ever has a religion lends to the idea that there is a higher power. Most religions have a creation story, a large flood story, and many others. Most religions basically boil down to ""dont be a dick and other ways to be a good person"", which is what a God would want, and what every person should want, regardless of beliefs. 

But my point is that the question ""does God exist"" or the question ""did God create the universe?"" is not an empirically asked or answered question, like Goop claiming to have health benefits, which is clearly measurable. That's my point. It is not the same vein as 2+2 and it is not that simple. Otherwise we would have an answer and societies wouldnt fight about it. 

I never referenced a Christian God in any of my comments, I dont even subscribe to any formal religions. I keep my mind open to the idea that I dont know everything, nor will I.
