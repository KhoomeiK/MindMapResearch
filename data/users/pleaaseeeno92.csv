The lawyers of the factory owners claimed that ""THE ONLY TIME THE INDUSTRIALIST MAKES A PROFIT IS IN THE TWELTH HOUR"". So if the labour dont work for at least 12 hours there is no way industry will be sustainable.""

Apparently 11 hours of work goes to production costs, and if the worker doesnt spend the 12 th hour the factory owner makes no money.

Jokes,ff3l50b,t1_ff2ehvt,1579543369.0,"nope, virtues are based on society. Virtues are based on what the society goals are; and what stage of development it is in.

In a medieval world, a person who isnt a rapist might be considered virtuous, in the modern world the standards are higher because society is at a higher level of development.

Or another example; killing a cow in poor, agrarian country like India can be considered a sin because it could mean starving a family. But killing a cow in New Zealand in a farm is not really one.

Also most Hindu stories are not about right or wrong. Right or wrong is a western philosophy and isnt what should decide one's daily lives. Even in the Mahabharat Krishna has done many wrong deeds to help Arjuna; if he was a ""righteous"" god he wouldnt do that.

The point in those stories is to do the ""appropriate"" thing based on the future impact of your actions (aka karma); not the morally right or wrong thing."
