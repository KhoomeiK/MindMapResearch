I am not a musician , but have been moved , inspired , and challenged by Neil’s work as a drummer , lyricist , writer motorcyclist and human being. His attention to detail and perfection in everything he jumped into has always been a source of hope and inspiration for me.

Like many , Rush is the soundtrack to my life. At 57 , they have literally been with me since I first owned a record player  , 42 years ago. 

It took me to today (almost a week ) to actually listen to an entire song without breaking down and turning it off. 

I’ve cried in the shower more times than I care to admit. 

Rush was more than a band to those of us luck enough to “get it”. This is not simply a celebrity death, we have collectively lost  a part of ourselves. Neil and the boys spoke to us , were there for us , in good times and bad. 

You can’t lose that without grieving.
