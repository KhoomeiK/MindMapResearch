I have all the parts and naturally producing hormones to check that box, but how I chose to present myself and behave has little to nothing to do with my gender. Personally I separate behaviors and even preferences from gender because I believe you can like and do whatever you want regardless of gender.

I present myself as pretty hyper feminine. I do this because I like it and certainly not because anyone said or pressured me to do so. After all I have a saying that if I don't look like a drag queen, I'm not satisfied. My gaudy style is definitely not encouraged for women in society lol but I do it because I'm comfortable and happy with that. I believe having qualities that are both feminine and masculine is paramount for anyone and not doing so is a handicap. It's incredibly valuable to know how to cook(traditionally feminine) as it is to know how to change a tire(traditionally masculine). 

I can't imagine what people who struggle with gender identity go through. My heart goes out to them because I see how painful it can be even if I don't fully understand why they have these feelings.

I just don't want to be responsible for someone getting hurt. 

I do have to say however if your doctor gives you this maybe let the champagne go flat before drinking. The bubbles were so intense(as champagne should be) that it created this thick yucky foam mixture at the top that was incredibly difficult to drink. The foam was so disgusting both in texture and taste. The almond butter also settled quickly so stirr often between sips otherwise you're literally just drinking almond butter in the end which is also awful. Overall the taste isn't that bad if you pair it with a prosecco. I also didn't have any issues with diarrhea since castor oil is a laxative. Maybe because of the almond butter"

AskReddit,feppj07,t3_eqcgwf,1579327020.0,"Meat eater. I actually enjoy vegetarian and vegan options. I think if they're made well they're quite delicious. My favorite is a veggie burger preferably a chick pea one with swiss, lettuce, onion and bacon. As long as it tastes great and is moderately healthy, then food is food in my book."
BabyBumps,fepp86p,t3_eqc1ob,1579326751.0,Mine stopped after 30 weeks. Always pack a pair of backup underwear and some easy to fold up leggings when you're out and about. This saved me for the times that a panty liner wasn't enough protection.

BabyBumps,fefh0na,t3_eouu5c,1579056142.0,"39 wks here. Yeah no sign of progression what so ever. I'm also starting to not be able to sleep at night and also get so tired and pass out even just a few hours after waking. I'm grateful to be able to have this experience but I'm also ready to meet my baby. 

I also had alot of lifestyle things I miss that I can't do right now. I miss biking and hiking for miles. I also on occasion do drag but I don't have any energy to dance on a stage in tall heels while lip synching to some great music. Also since I'm having more intense Braxton hicks, I try to stay in close proximity of my house/hospital just in case. I would love to be able to dress up nice and head into the city for a nice dinner with friends or family, but I worry that I won't have energy for the ride or I'll start going into labor unexpectedly."
