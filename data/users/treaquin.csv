AskHR,fezbeh6,t1_fez9zcz,1579455667.0,Thanks! I thought it would be cool to get both perspectives.
AskHR,feyx4x7,t1_feytp0t,1579451552.0,I should clarify! I would tell a director (the person above the manager in question) as part of a follow up. Itâ€™s really on their level how they want to handle it. However our role is more consultative so in the absence of a legal claim itâ€™s usually best to keep eyes and ears open for other concerns. I wouldnâ€™t call these actions an investigation per se.
AskHR,feywhx5,t1_fey7sta,1579451369.0,"My only challenge is that I work for a company with over 130,000 employees and I am nowhere near the top of the food chain. But, I have seen this at prior organizations."
AskHR,feyw5py,t1_feym703,1579451195.0,"My logic is culture is not just one event. Itâ€™s made up of every single interaction and process that comprise the way we do business. So, it is the onus of every single person within a company to say, is this the culture I want to be a part of? Because the reality is, you can control how you act, even if you canâ€™t control others.

AskHR,fey1fzu,t1_fey0r15,1579439545.0,"Yes I agree it is helpful! But this doesnâ€™t take away having to explain the same to employees day after day. Our challenge is that while the terms are used incorrectly, we still have to make people feel we value their coming forward. I wouldnâ€™t want to hurt a relationship of people feeling comfortable to speak up when they see something off/wrong because the time they did wasnâ€™t exactly what we were concerned with. It felt wrong to the employee, so you canâ€™t take away their feelings. 

Sorry this is a long way of saying it addresses the problem we face but not how to actually handle it with an appropriate amount of tact."

Part of the initial steps was a recommendation from my PCP that I was suited for the surgery. That includes demonstrating previous attempts at weight loss. Indicate what your attempts have looked like and why you think this is something that is best for you.  The beginning weight loss is easy; the surgery is a tool not a solution though. 

Donâ€™t say you want a quick fix so you can eat whatever you want! Or that this is the easy way out. Because it is not!

Edit: Do you already have a surgeon for bariatric?"
