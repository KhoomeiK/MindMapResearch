That said, in my opinion the more critical part of the equasion is that mods are the face of your channel in chat.  If one of your RL friends is a mod and constantly shittalks you (""Bro, what even was that shot?""  ""Are you even aiming?"" etc) then anyone coming in will think that is acceptable and expected in your channel because, after all, the MODS are doing it.    Your mods will end up having a massive effect on what sort of community you build, so choose them carefully."
heroesofthestorm,ff403fv,t3_eriwdd,1579552622.0,I mean... you left though.  You apparently left multiple times during the match.  How is Blizzard supposed to know whether or not it was intentional?
heroesofthestorm,fezdl1l,t3_eqv51h,1579456226.0,"Oh, your hit points stayed about 1, that's what happened.  :P"
ChoosingBeggars,fejsr17,t1_fejqo13,1579184939.0,"Hiring people and not paying them a sustainable wage is exploitation.  Workers are resources and, just like any other resource in your business, they have a cost to maintain.  Bezos was not meeting that cost and was relying on hiring replacements every time one of his employees broke."
ChoosingBeggars,feex7du,t3_eoj6fh,1579043175.0,"I wouldn't necessarily move out, but if that continues just ring the police.  She's an adult at this point, if her mother won't let her leave the house, that is considered kidnapping."
heroesofthestorm,fdtl8w3,t3_emyr84,1578718381.0,Working as intended.  Don't try and fly while deep underground.  Dumb dragon.  :P
Twitch,fdtkxc8,t1_fdt5p78,1578718249.0,"That is a SUPER different statement than ""All streamers do, tell me someone that doesn't, see?  You can't.""  Which is definately how your first post came out :P"
Twitch,fdqdm1d,t1_fdq3m3v,1578663872.0,"The vast majority of streamers don't use viewbots.  Why would you?  Twitch bans your account if they catch you, and they catch a lot."
creepyPMs,fdpahkk,t3_emgtrj,1578623800.0,Is that drawing to the side a thumbs up or is his avatar actually a drawing of a hand holding a cock?
Twitch,fdd36r1,t3_ekn06e,1578292912.0,"I have a text-to-speech program that my roommate, who is mute, had designed for this exact issue, DM me if you want me to send it to you :)"
creepyPMs,fdd33jk,t1_fdca0de,1578292813.0,Wow!  Thank you for the gold!  I've never gotten gold before!  \^\_\^
creepyPMs,fdca0de,t3_ekd531,1578270054.0,"I always like to fuck with these guys by telling them.  ""Oh, an Alpha?  Isn't that the team that basically got wiped out by Zombies before Bravo Team showed up?  Well whatever, you did your best."""
heroesofthestorm,fd9ehvk,t1_fd7y9m2,1578232233.0,"Skins and Sprays are art assets, not programming changes.  They are handled by different people."
Twitch,fd5u6vo,t1_fd5c9lc,1578181555.0,Incorrect.  Partners are able to negotiate their own contracts and there is no maximum.  They are also not permitted to disclose the specifics of their specific contract.
