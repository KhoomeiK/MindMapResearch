The drive was about 14 hours, I can't imagine walking that distance, much less somewhere even further than here. Yeah, I'm sure many homeless people die in New England winters, but people in Florida that aren't homeless still manage to die from the summer heat sometimes. Homeless people have it really bad in the summer in Florida. They need to take my old commute to work in the Ford Contour I had that lacked air conditioning. 45 minutes in that and they'd realize how dim that though process is.

I was raised with lots of traditional southern values, but I was also raised to never expect someone else to pay your way for anything. I think who pays on a date should be discussed before the two people ever show up at the location of the date, it will definitely save everyone time, money, and awkwardness if they aren't on the same page about that. I also think that's a pretty big predictor of the future, if you can't agree with someone on who pays for dates, maybe you should try a different person because disagreements are only gonna get bigger from there."
AmItheAsshole,ffefqjl,t3_et653y,1579846279.0,"ESH. I'm nearing 30, and if i were 3 weeks into a relationship I wouldn't accept having my stuff covered by someone else until we were in a more solid relationship. Egalitarianism in relationships is very important to me, and you have to start off on the right foot. Expecting him to pay for you on your dates after a certain point is kinda shitty. If you aren't sharing finances, you should be paying your own way unless you've both discussed a different arrangement. There's a strong possibility he's dated women that have not offered to split checks, or allowed that at first and then expected to be spoiled. I do think it was wrong of him to buy you something as a surprise and then expect you to pay that back. Talking about hanging out like friends do is also a teeny red flag to me. I was strung along by an asshole that paid for me on our dates after we'd discussed it, I knew his friends and they liked me, and he did refer to us as hanging out, not going on dates. I was much younger, like 18-20 and I was SHOCKED when I found out he was seeing multiple women and pulling the same story on them. When I asked him about it he denied it and then ghosted me. I'd recommend you initiate a discussion if you still want to see this guy. Ask him outright what his thoughts on finances and paying for dates is. Ask him if he sees this as a blossoming relationship, or a friends with benefits deal. There has been a miscommunication somewhere between the two of you and it needs to be ironed out before moving forward. This is gonna sound harsh, but if you aren't ready to have an Awkward Conversation about money, sex, future plans, and children, then you are not ready to enter a romantic relationship.

It stressed the relationships between the 4 of us and almost ruined our friendships completely because 4 adults living on top of each other will cause tensions to run high even in the most chill of people. My boyfriend and I make just over minimum wage each and we got lucky in our current place. We pay what I consider to be practically nothing, and our landlord includes water and electricity so we pay one flat fee a month which is very nice. The issue is we're still stretched thin on groceries, gas, cell phone bills, and minor entertainment which is more necessary than people think. Our entertainment budget consists of a used video game and/or one (1) ball of yarn every once in a while. Nobody can work harder when they don't have anything to help them decompress. We also both lack health insurance because we'd rather eat than have a 5,000$ deductible that we could not meet in a year and still have food or lodging. We don't have internet either, or cable. 


Even if you're lucky enough to find a place that isn't out of your budget, hopefully the jobs in that area aren't shitty or you'll have to commute and that takes gas money, time(money), and causes wear and tear on your vehicle more than a short commute(more money). I grew up in a tourist town, but away from the bulk of the tourism sector. Everyone I knew that had a job that paid decent had an hour or more commute to a shitty service industry job because that's all that was available. No factories around, just retail and restaurants that paid as low as they possibly could and would refuse to offer full time hours but demand open availability causing people to not be able to have a second job because they're schedule varied day by day and week by week.

I'm in the US and we use ours for identification as well as driving. Your frustration is warranted, but I feel your mum just wants to hear news that you're able to take care of yourself.

If we actually worked with our children properly in the public education sector I think we'd have a lot less issues.

Responsibility, respect, and many other things can easily be taught to the vast majority of children starting in pre-k and kindergarten.

aww,ff36p41,t1_ff34bsg,1579534983.0,"There is a good test to know what kind of dog you're getting. How does the breeder run their business? Do they keep puppies underfoot so they get used to interacting with many different people and animals, while also getting used to all the sounds/smells/quirks of living in a house. Or do they keep the puppies in a big kennel out back and the puppies only see people or other animals when they need to be fed or taken to the vet? In the specific case of pitbulls, watch out for people breeding and selling only blue pits. Blue is a recessive trait and if you have a litter full of blue pit puppies then you either got ridiculously lucky, or you inbred your dogs so much that they only display recessive traits and haven't been bred to diminish traits like bad health conditions or even aggression. Pit bulls are absolutely bred to be aggressive toward other animals, as are many dog breeds. But a lot of breeders that are not shitty people are actually working to breed dogs with less aggressive traits, and they're socializing puppies so they aren't nervous around new things. A nervous or scared dog will be unpredictable, so you gotta find a breeder that's instilling confidence in their puppies. 

My dad got us a pitbull around the time I turned 13 because the breeder was a family friend. He had a farm and actually was skilled in animal husbandry. The pits he bred for specifically bred for hog hunting, but we never went hunting. His puppies were raised around lots of people and many different animals. With the factors of getting a well bred dog and us taking up actual responsibility for the dog, he hasn't ever been aggressive to people and he always listens. We don't set him up for failure, because we aren't stupid. He isn't happy with other animals anymore, so we keep him leashed constantly when they take him somewhere and they don't let him run up to other animals. 


Getting a good dog like that is a little bit of luck and a lot of hard work. I've known many people that had to get rid of ""good family dogs"" like labrador retrievers or golden retrievers because they got the puppy from a shitty breeder and then did not take the time to work with the dog and ended up with an aggressive, neurotic idiot. Any dog can be killer if not raised right, and if you aren't willing to put in the time then don't get a dog. (General you, not specific you. It's always some Karen just trying to get her kid to stop asking about a puppy, then they raise a terror nightmare dog because wont teach the damn thing any manners, same as with her kids.)"

I don't mind taking a 100$, but if your order only cost 4.50$, I practically have to empty my drawer to make change for you."

todayilearned,ff0ob8f,t1_ff0meq0,1579470739.0,"I agree! You really don't know anything about other peoples experiences until you experience something like it. Building empathy can be hard when you have no way to relate to the struggles of other people. We had a really great teacher, my only complaint was that she wouldn't teach us any of the signs for swear words. She was really kind, funny, and creative, our tests were 'translating' a paragraph or writing something and translating that and then we would sign it in front of a camera in the back of the room and she'd review and grade them later. They took about 4 minutes, so it would have taken forever for her to sit individually with all 30 of us."

todayilearned,ff0k0fn,t1_fezalke,1579469564.0,"I took American Sign Language in high school and we did a pretty big unit on Hellen Keller. We did learn how to sign some things, mostly just finger spelling into each other's hands like she did. Then we did a big obstacle course where we were blindfolded and wore earplugs while we had a friend sign into our hands what we had to do at each station, and it was wild. We had to like, pour a glass of water out of a pitcher and some other things that hearing and seeing people take for granted. It helped us learn effective communication as well, if our buddy didn't give us clear instructions on what the task was, we wouldn't complete it properly. But it was also on us to sign back if we wanted clarification on instruction. 

I'm not the OP, but this thread has brought back memories of that class."
todayilearned,ff0i8kw,t1_ff0eds2,1579469144.0,"Yes, at that time they'd have used the term 'dumb' to mean mute. My grandma doesn't use the term, but I have heard her talk about how that's what they said when she was young.  I'm sure they'd use mute as well, but I assume that dumb was used kinda as a slang term for mute. I have no actual idea about that though."

You should have seen my first attempt at cooking a meal I ate probably 3 times a month growing up, I burnt everything. Keep practicing and don't be afraid to screw up, try to remember to learn from it when something doesn't work out quite right. Also, if you can find some episodes of Good Eats, they're entertaining and informative, they helped get me more excited about cooking when I was younger."
