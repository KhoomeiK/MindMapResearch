todayilearned,feng3hz,t1_femodgn,1579283934.0,">29\. Here is an illustration of the way in which the over-socialized leftist shows his real attachment to the conventional attitudes of our society while pretending to be in rebellion aginst it. Many leftists push for affirmative action, for moving black people into high-prestige jobs, for improved education in black schools and more money for such schools; the way of life of the black “underclass” they regard as a social disgrace. They want to integrate the black man into the system, make him a business executive, a lawyer, a scientist just like upper-middle-class white people. The leftists will reply that the last thing they want is to make the black man into a copy of the white man; instead, they want to preserve African American culture. But in what does this preservation of African American culture consist? It can hardly consist in anything more than eating black-style food, listening to black-style music, wearing black-style clothing and going to a black-style church or mosque. In other words, it can express itself only in superficial matters. In all ESSENTIAL respects most leftists of the oversocialized type want to make the black man conform to white, middle-class ideals. They want to make
him study technical subjects, become an executive or a scientist, spend his life climbing the status ladder to prove that black people are as good as white. They want to make black fathers “responsible,” they want black gangs to become nonviolent, etc. But these are exactly the values of the industrial- technological system. The system couldn’t
care less what kind of music a man listens to, what kind of clothes he wears or what religion he believes in as long as he studies in school, holds a respectable job, climbs the status ladder, is a “responsible” parent, is nonviolent and so forth. In effect, however much he may deny it, the over-socialized leftist wants to integrate the black man into the system and make him adopt its values. 

This is some of the dumbest shit I've ever read. ""We shouldn't support equality among races because being economically oppressed is inherent to the black identity."" What the fuck?"

FargoTV,fe6l8bl,t1_fe6gsno,1578894629.0,"> The UFO, whilst very outlandish, isn't really integral to the plot, except to say it was sighted

That's just not true. The entire climax of the season revolves around the sudden appearance of a UFO. And the show does nothing to suggest that it could be anything other than an alien space ship. Up until this point, the only references you see to UFOs are a child's drawing and the hallucinations of people who either just had chemotherapy or were just hit by a car, and even then you don't get a good look at it. But in the climax of the season finale, you and every character get a perfectly clear look at what could only be a flying saucer. This allows the Blumquists to escape and distracts Bear long enough for Lou to kill him instead of vice versa. In no world can you claim that it ""isn't integral to the plot,"" and you also cannot claim that it falls under the category of ""extraordinarily unlikely events,"" as the framing of the scene doesn't in any way suggest that this could have been the result of some sort of mass hallucination.

The walls are about as thin as it gets. The location is actually kinda garbage unless all your classes are in the NQ/MLB area, since you won't be close to any of the blue bus routes. All the desks have a weird textured surface that makes them impossible to write on without an additional surface on top of it.

Honestly, if the Varsity is as good as these high rises get, my advice is don't bother. They're all at least twice as expensive as most other housing options around town, and are built solely for the purpose of siphoning as much money from as many students as possible. The floor plans aren't designed to be livable, they're designed to cram as many tenants onto a floor as possible.

My advice is to tour a lot of places that weren't build after the millennium, and keep in mind that new != nice. The fact of the matter is that you just straight up aren't going to find a nice looking apartment in Ann Arbor near campus. Land lords know that they don't need to put any actual effort into maintaining a high quality apartment near campus because most students don't have the option to live any further than a few blocks away from the Diag, but at least the structures themselves were originally designed with the intention of being lived in. I can assure you if you spend some time touring older apartment buildings or segmented houses, you *will* find somewhere that will check most if not all of your boxes, and you won't slowly develop a sense of claustrophobia or financial dread as you balloon your student loans over an apartment charging over $4/sqft."

I'm not trying to claim that ""male-is-default"" isn't a real thing or that sexism is dead or anything. I'm not some conservative troll stirring up shit. I'm only trying to communicate that calling people out for little to no reason only serves to make you and the ideology you represent look toxic."
AmItheAsshole,fby3kcc,t1_fbxfz77,1577207239.0,"The aggressive part is the assumption that it comes from a ""male-is-default"" perspective. And cut your bullshit here:

> I think it's silly for men to tell women that they shouldn't be upset about a male-is-default culture because it's unimportant. While you're not a man going by your username, the majority of the people making the argument and getting hostile about it are-- the ones bringing up feminism, gender politics, wokeness, etc. all for trying to address an actual problem that some people put more importance on than others.

You cannot pretend that you [well not necessarily you but the side you're defending] aren't the one firing the first shot on gender politics. The statement itself insinuates that the mistake comes from a place of ""male-is-default"" sexism. It's an accusation of owning a harmful unconscious bias. Own your stance or don't have one.

And in the future, have the respect to make your counter argument directly to the person you're accusing of hostility and unfounded butthurt instead of someone you know already agrees with you."

My point isn't that there are or aren't context clues that OP is a woman though. My point is that yes, it is pointlessly aggressive to call other people out for missing those context clues."

""[a severe reproof or rebuke, especially a formal one by a person in authority.](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/reprimand)""

Maybe people don't like being *reprimanded* for something as inconsequential as reading someone's gender-ambiguous story as one or the other? Shit like this is obnoxious, and comes with an underlying insinuation that you are in some way being p^(r)OBleMa^(T)iC by arriving at an incorrect assumption when, and I cannot stress enough, *nothing in the post actually clarifies OP's gender.* You're not a champion of feminism for being a dick head and calling people out for not assuming the correct gender, you're just injecting the tensions of gender politics into the conversation for no reason other than to make yourself look ""woke."" If anything, *you're the one* acting sexist for claiming that ""context clues make it somewhat obvious that OP is a woman."" What context clues are those I wonder? Please quote me the specific sentences of OP's post that made it oh-so-clear to you that it was written by a woman, and be sure to explain in complete sentences why it made you so certain that a man could not have written those words."

But I was actually wrong – having now looked it up, safe harbor is 10pm-6am, which means that SNL is actually safe harbor in the central timezone as well, and *becomes* safe harbor after the first half hour in mountain time. All the other time zones though are exclusively outside of safe harbor."
