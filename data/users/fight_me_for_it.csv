Mediums,ffh9i52,t3_et9vkf,1579927017.0,"I had the same question but don't consider myself psychic. Just an observer of the humans around me so I get good at ""guessing"" right."
Mediums,ffh9baw,t1_ffgjyd0,1579926849.0,"My childhood friend, her family thought she was troubled, turned out she was hearing voices of people in her family who had died before she could ever know them. She wrote a book. I thought she called me to sell me her book.

Nope she called because after my mom passed away, and she only knew my mom passed when she called my dad to find out how I was doing and he told her. My friend knew that her encounter in Missouri with a woman in a store from the same town my mom was from was confirmation that the recent voice she was hearing was my mom's and had a message for me.

Not kidding you, there was no way after 20 yrs my friend just cold called me without having some ability. Her conversation about my mom were also things she wouldn't have known my mom had struggled with because after I moved away things happened to my mom my friend wouldn't have known about as we didn't speak.

But the kicker was when my friend asked me, because my mom wanted to know or say 1. Stop flipping the channel when a commercial comes on. Basically. I thought this could have been a fluke of some sort because lots of people skip commercials. But according to my friends I was bad about it. And purposefully changed channels when commercials about anything that could relat to my mom came on. 

And 2. Why did I sit alone in the balcony at church.... Like seriously my friend lived in Missouri I lived in Texas and did sit in the balcony alone after my mom passed and I refused to sit in the same place at church I once sat with my mom and my fiance at the time refused to sit in the balcony with me. So in a believer.

The other thing is my friend had also been close to my brother and could have called him but she said it was me my mom wanted to reach out to. I had been struggling and pretending.

So I definitely am in awe of mediums.


I stumble across this subreddit because I was trying to find information on psychics as it has been recently brought to my attention that not one, not twice, but 3 psychics at different points in my life have indicated that I possibly have a gift of vision or? Psychic ability as well. And I didn't believe it, and just think when I follow my instinct on something and turn out to be correct it's because I have the same trick psychics have, experience with people and being observant of human behavior. In my line of work my instinct can be beneficial but I don't think it's because I'm psychic it's just because I pay attention to the behaviors of those I serve while others are just not as observant.

I want to reach out to my friend to understand how she better developed her abilities and share with her some experiences I've had with ""guessing"" and being weirdly correct to the point others even seem a bit baffled that I can get things ""right"" at times when they can't figure it out or how I figured something out."

I had a dog once, roommate had a dog. Her dog was more chill than my dog. Barked only once, just chill dog. Both our dogs got along with each other from day 1. Any friends who had a dog and brought them over same deal.. All Play no issues. (unless the other dog was timid/shy then our dogs just left the visitor and dog alone).

But a Neighbor had a dog that whenever he saw the chill dog would try to ""attack"", but not try to attack my less chill dog.  But my dog would bark at the neighbor dog, and seemed to avoid it. Neighbor accused my roommates dog of being the problem and I was like, no your dog is an ass and neighbor was a snobby nosed ass too.

Point is some dogs can be chill but an asshole dog even if it's not an ass to other dogs can set a chill dog off for some reason and that is why dogs should be on leashes and not walking their owner."

But one day he kind of taps my arm as if he may want to grab my hand... or give me something? I hold out my hand and in it he put a pack of cigarettes and a lighter.

My first thought was, where did he pick them up from on campus? Because he surely doesn't smoke, and I had slight brain fog. He got them out of his jacket pocket. He would wear his grandfather's coat to school. So I texted mom a picture and ask if the kid has a new habit she didn't tell me about. Followed by a playful emoji. She texted back she was embarrassed. I call her and talk to her telling her not to worry, habits are hard to break no matter whose cigs they were.
