You're correcting your mean and bad thoughts, that is what matters and and that is who you really are. If you really try your best to be a good person, you are a good person. 

I struggled with this a lot when I was your age. The main reason for me struggling with it is because I was dealing with a messed up mind and a lot of confusion from being abused. So working through it took a lot of therapy for me because of the source. But there could be any number of reasons that could cause this, like the entertainment you are taking in or the people you spend time with shaping the way you think.

It's important to take in entertainment that matches your goals and morals and view of who you want to be because our entertainment can so easily shape us without us realizing. It can be difficult to do the same with the people you spend time with because of school and family, but as you age it'll be easier to surround yourself with kind and caring people who have good morals and will help encourage you to be who you want to be."

vaginismus,feqhfdz,t3_eqehaw,1579341958.0,"On the surface Vaginismus can seem like simply a medical issue. But for a lot of people who experience it, there are a lot of mental and emotional factors going on.  Do you know what her history is with emotional and sexual health? 

There could be a lot that went on in her past to have gotten her in the mindset of being uncomfortable with her vagina or doing stuff like that herself or even having something sexual going at all on that makes her afraid and want to have someone she feels safe with there. Or there could be millions of other reasons or things going on in her head that might be causing this issue that I couldn't begin to really get into the possibilities without knowing her and her history. 

Is she seeing a therapist as part of her medical treatment? 

Or maybe it's not as mental/emotional and she might be scared that because she can't see as well and isn't familiar with that part of her, that she will hurt herself with the dialator. Having experienced the pain, I think it would be normal to be afraid of accidentally causing more pain. 

I can't speak for other women, but personally yes, I am not very familiar with my own vagina and I am uncomfortable using a dialator. Those are both things I need to work on. I wouldn't ask my husband to use it on me because of what you brought out, he can't feel if I'm in pain, but I could imagine many many things that contributed to my vaginismus that would make me feel scared and anxious to do it myself or alone compared to someone I trusted. If I was feeling particularly scared and anxious before my first time with a dialator I could also imagine avoiding it or asking my husband to do it out of fear and frustration, but not because I didn't want to get better or because I actually thought that was a better option.

DecidingToBeBetter,felhk3o,t3_epsf7u,1579222332.0,"1. A. My husband and I have also been working on getting healthy and eating like we care about our bodies. His was partially motivated by weight loss as well. Without any diets he lost 80 pounds in 9 months and we both feel healthier and happier. Experiment, try different foods, find foods that make you happy. Try eating at home more and meal prepping. Healthy food is delicious if you make it yourself and find what you like. Everything in moderation and try to have protein, carbs, and fruits and veggies with every meal. Don't restrict yourself from foods we love. I love a good soda and he loves cheese its. We still eat them, but not every day and always in moderation. Putting your snacks like chips or crackers or popcorn in a bowl can really help you only eat what you want and don't mindlessly eat the whole bag. 

One tip I saw recently was something like: If you keep treating your vegetables as a side, you won't put effort into them. Most Americans do this, toss some lettuce or carrots and ranch on the side of whatever main meal they are actually excited about. But when you treat the vegetables as a main part of the meal, and you put a little effort into them you'll find so many more ways to enjoy them. We have really found this to be true. We love stir fries and curries and roasting vegetables with different seasonings or glazes.  

1.B. Home workouts from YouTube can be really fun if you find what you like. My preference is pilates. Hiking and swimming are great fun and great excersize. Swimming is nice because it isn't hard on your body, since the water is holding your weight you dont have to work as hard. To make hiking even more fun we love to take pictures on our phone. It turns the hike into a scavenger hunt for great pictures. 

2. Do you have health insurance? Many in-network clinic have behavioral health specialists you can see that are cheaper or sometimes free as many are interning. If you do have insurance, please talk to your primary care provider about those options. They usually use congatnive behavioral therapy and it is a bit more of a short term therapy relationship to work on building some mental health and stress management skills. But it is a start."

Here's what I would say from my experience:

1. If he has friends he spends time with, what are they like? A lot of guys at that age can be really mean, even to their friends. They might be a negative influence, maybe making fun or his weight or other things or shutting him down when he tries to express himself to them. Keep treating him well and hopefully show him through your words and actions how he deserves to be treated. If you feel like they are a negative influence, speak from your heart as to why. It can be hard hearing that the things they may say about him aren't true if he believes them or hard hearing the people he spends time with aren't good for him if he thinks he can't make new friends. But over time that reminder will stay with him and help guide him towards kinder people. 

2. What are his hobbies? Having a hobby that allows you to express yourself can be really helpful when you have depression. If he has an interest in music, writing, etc try to encourage it. 

3. Sometimes when someone has a hard time expressing themselves, they may want to, but worry about burdening or hurting others by it. If they have negative feelings about themselves they may feel they aren't worth being listened to. Or they may feel their thoughts and feelings are too sad or dark to share. Keep trying to draw him out. It's a difficult skill to attain. 

For me, the thing that helps me open up the most, is not having to talk face to face, but to talk side by side. Working together in something always helps.

 It may be groccery shopping or getting the mail or washing the car or folding laundry. Any activity that you two can do together. Start by conversing about the activity. Asking easy, light questions about his day or what you are doing, talking about your day too so he doesn't feel like he is being interrogated. If he responds to something more than the other subjects or questions, delve slightly deeper. If you feel like he might say a little more about something but he has stopped, stay silent he may have the thoughts or feelings on his mind to say, but be scared to. In staying silent you give him the opportunity to express something he might not have said because he was taking too long to gather courage or decide on it.  Pay attention to subjects and activities that he is more talkative with and try again later talking about those. 

When working on opening up the communication, be careful with your reactions. They can be one of the biggest factors to determine how much he feels he can express. Even if you have never reacted very harshly or judgementally towards him, a smaller reaction could feel that way to him if other people have or if it is something he is insecure about."

Any extra in that account is saved and later used for a vacation once we save enough. 

Then we have a joint account at a credit union where his direct deposit from work goes. We use that to pay for all our other living expenses, since he makes more than me. We also move the extra money from our budget from there into a savings account. 

Even if I didn't have to use a bank that has Zelle, we would probably keep this setup because it has been working well for us and we feel like it balances our finances really well."

DecidingToBeBetter,feg3b37,t3_eoxqwp,1579075047.0,"It is something you can talk to them about? I feel like taking time to have a good long conversation with a friend about your lives, goals, and relationship can shed a lot of light on the relationship's ability to become healthy. 

Take time beforehand to figure what you feel is toxic, why, how it is affecting you, and postive ideas for how you can both work on it. Practice using I language (For example: ""When you do... I feel... so I... and it affect me by...""). Never use absolutes (""You always..."". ""You never...""). Reflect on those redeeming qualities beforehand and make sure, in talking about it, your friend doesn't feel attack and feel cared about. It is hard to hear you've had a negative affect on someone, and hard to realize you need it change. 

Toxic relationships can change. For instance, no matter how much I wanted to cut my mom off, I couldn't. And we worked on our relationship on both ends and it is much more postive now. 

But the person needs to be willing to accept that they need to change and willing to work at it. The person being affected by a toxic person might need to also work on how they respond to the other and how they communicate with them. It will be a lot of hard work and time to create change.  

If the person responds negatively to the conversation, it might be good to take a step back from the relationship for a time, and then remind them how much you still care about them. They may need time to accept that they need to change. If the person continues to react negatively to the situation, that may show that the relationship cannot be transformed at this time. 

This is all worded for a situation in which one person's attitude, mentality, or habits is more toxic than the other. But the suggestions can apply to situations in which it is more equal as well. There is still a lot of communication and work to be done on both sides."

simpleliving,fe6sk7a,t3_egihbi,1578903394.0,"When I lived in the city I found the best way to make myself do laundry every week, so that I didn't need as many clothes, was to plan for the laundromat. 

When I prepared my schedule for the week I would choose things I needed to get done, that could be done at the laundry mat, and schedule them at the same time. 

I hated doing laundry, so this helped distract me from it and didn't make the hour or two at the laundromat feel so time-wasting. 

Sorting through coupons, meal planning, preparing grocery lists, reading my therapy homework, journaling, researching, etc. These all made the time at the laundromat feel very productive, which encouraged me. 

It is also really nice doing laundry every week when you have fewer clothes. When my wardrobe was out of control I would wait a month to do laundry and there was so much and it was so heavy and stressful and time consuming. When you take 1 light bag to the laundromat every week it is a lot less stressful. 

These ideas could apply to laundry at your in-laws too! If you bring less laundry and are super productive (which might make you feel happier and more confident) while you are there it might feel less embarrassing."

Studies have shown little about their effectiveness and I've learned from experience people can have trouble actually absorbing the nutrients instead of just passing most of the vitamins. This is how people taking vitamin B can still have a deficiency. It can be easier to absorb the nutrients by getting most of them in food. 

Generally multivitamins are used to help boost your levels a bit in addition to food, or help if you are lacking a few in your diet. Most are not made to completely make up your nutrient intake."
