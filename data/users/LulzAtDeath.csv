Advice,fcyojra,t3_ejkvjg,1578083930.0,"My dude, that post is long, I read it all, twice. 

I'm going to be real with you, I know exactly what you feel like because I felt like that for a long time, the constant reminders that there are people who can spend time with others are rough when it feels like you cant function when around someone you're attracted to.

Heres the thing though, you're young, you dont have to give a flying fuck what your brain says, you can do whatever the fuck you commit to and I really think you are only seeing the negative sides to your internship a few hours away, why does it matter that your original friend/support circle wont be there, that feeling of failure is self inflicted and speaking as an outsider you're making improvements of yourself anyway which you should be goddamn proud of.

Now back to that internship, use this moment in time to change the way you view this opportunity, you're going to meet countless new people and get to know dozens of new faces, do not focus on getting into a relationship with any of them, focus on being honest to yourself and acknowledge the fact that you are only human and so is everyone around you.

I'm going to be personal now, I felt like you felt because I simply focused on finding someone to date rather than thinking why is noone trying to date me, it sounds like you may of had this thought but heres the kicker, I had this thought at around your age, I'm 23 now, the different the past 2 years have made to my own mental health is so crazy to fathom that I honestly cannot explain to you how different it can and will be for you. 

Oh and if you want some hope mate, I had not been intimate with a single person for around 6 years before Monday just gone, I have spent a little bit of each day with this person and today they were at my home merely to watch a film and cuddle, no ulterior motives, just a film and cuddle.

 It will surprise you how the people you think are owning this whole relationship and socialising game are actually just either lucky or winging it the whole time, and as fucking easy as it may be for me to type you honestly just got to be honest and be yourself, people do not focus on your flaws and if you think I'm just saying this for the sake of it, try and think of a time someone did something so embarrassing you still remember it vividly to this day? 

I guess what I'm trying to say in a TLDR sense is that you're 21. You're life is going to change so much. Just adopt the motto of saying fuck it, counting to 3 and then doing whatever it is that scares you.

I probably cant help further and this comment may of been abit much but if you need more advice speak to someone who is family or close friend they will know you more than you think."
