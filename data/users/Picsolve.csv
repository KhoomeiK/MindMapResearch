Repsneakers,fek0q4x,t3_epkcp2,1579190122.0,"Hm, I’ll start of by saying that V1 reps aren’t getting better than this, and it’s still far off from retails,

Sole is very white, an offwhite colour is what you’re meant to have, but again you’re not going to find anything more accurate. 

Pattern is off, haven’t got any retails but it’s most definitely off when comparing it to legit pictures

Shape is fine as expected with V1’s by now

 If you don’t mind being called out GL it, you won’t find anything better. Maybe PK BASF but idk, I tend to stay away from V1’s as a whole so I can’t really suggest much, hope this helped"

This is what occurs often tbh, because as you can see from coco’s recent GP or whatever batch release their sales have rocketed up. Definitely paid promotion, as we can see constant GL’s on this single batch but RL’s on others from many QC’ers.

Don’t forget that you used to charge every single person for a “Faster QC”, on the discord I mentioned it and a lot of people agreed, if you’re a QC’er don’t complain and ask everyone to pay you for a faster QC, if you can’t handle it simply don’t do so many a day."
