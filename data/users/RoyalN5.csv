starterpacks,ffsue6m,t1_ffs7xc3,1580192856.0,"Lol mine was either. I guess that makes me old. My high school was huge though, we had 4 floors"
AdviceAnimals,ffsu93y,t1_ffs293i,1580192702.0,What did you bring for your license renewal? Mine is coming up. I don't know what I would need
interestingasfuck,ffsu54e,t1_ffsomgt,1580192580.0,Why? You don't see water mines.
aww,ffsmoso,t1_ffsh5mn,1580185616.0,Its Ireland so nothing really besides just bending over for Britain
todayilearned,ffs3wit,t3_euqgk1,1580172502.0,I can relate. Never smoked a cigarette in my life and was diagnosed with interstitial lung disease last year. I'm only 21
UCSantaBarbara,ffs2oes,t1_ffpauxc,1580171650.0,Great way to end up with a STI
UCSantaBarbara,ffs2mfw,t1_ffr4l9u,1580171611.0,I wish it was that easy for me
AdviceAnimals,ffs1av3,t1_ffrj5jl,1580170712.0,It's actually really sad that there is such a strong resentment of religion here.
dankmemes,ffp7yfd,t1_ffoqq09,1580088486.0,Yeah lol. There are times when I try playing a game and I notice its laggy as shit its always because my charger is unplugged.
natureismetal,ffmonyw,t1_ffmctdl,1580057325.0,Nice. I actually still have never seen one
Anthropology,ffjk4mq,t1_ffihx50,1580000050.0,It's from eureka.org lol
explainlikeimfive,ffj5156,t1_ffj1g5j,1579990571.0,No because it's a different type of muscle
science,ffj4spq,t1_ffihs97,1579990397.0,You are healthy and not one a narcissistic douchebag
funny,ffio84n,t1_ffilchk,1579978608.0,Its also cheap and looks like shit
funny,ffio2mr,t1_ffimmkd,1579978505.0,"Lmao how? She is not a baby. She falls down on her side the knife literally comes nowhere near the face or body. It isn't natural to slap your face as you fall down.

 The natural reflex is to spread out your arms and legs which is exactly what she did"
science,fficfbb,t1_ffic442,1579970547.0,">So, uh, basically the entire planet?

Dude not everyone on that selfie bullshit. I don't post pictures of myself to the internet. The only time I do is when I make a tinder account and that's only so that I can date."
science,ffic8gm,t3_etoayc,1579970417.0,Wow literally every comment is deleted. Is there a way I can see them?
reactiongifs,ffibyj8,t3_etq67z,1579970234.0,To be honest nobody cares. There are too busy checking out the hot girls or doing their workout.
BattlefieldV,ffi8uu4,t1_ffi4ras,1579968075.0,To be fair they ignore it because they don't have anything to say about it which really is just as bad
SciontC,ffi8n1p,t1_ffht507,1579967923.0,Weird. I have a 2014 as well I had noticed that they felt squishy but as soon as I replaced the rotors and pads they were fine
natureismetal,ffgqxdj,t1_ffgotce,1579912790.0,"Majority? Lol most animals could take us out, they don't even need to be an apex. Lol a wild pig would kill you."
natureismetal,ffgo59w,t1_ffg57pk,1579910814.0,We really aren't apex predators. We aren't even in the food chain.
natureismetal,ffgo3fx,t1_fffyq6r,1579910778.0,Just like how when people say to lay down and submit when you see a bear lol.
aww,ffgny4b,t1_ffgbvah,1579910674.0,"They are and aren't. There isn't a 3 distinct group of mammals, reptiles and amphibians like how their used to be. They were considered before but now there are Avians"
UCSantaBarbara,ffg2cef,t3_et6iz8,1579896946.0,"Dude, I liked CSGO but they keep changing it and feels like a completely different game than what it was back in 2016. Like they have avatars now wtf?? I don't even know wtf is going on anymore. 

I just stick to Source."
aww,ffg0qry,t1_fffvogr,1579895958.0,Its not limited to just mammals. Birds (reptiles) do the same thing. Golden Hawks have taken in bald eagles
PSNFriends,ffffjg9,t3_et8ibp,1579882857.0,"Lol you must be new to the internet. Openly stating that you are 19 and a female is like opening a floodgate. 

Why do you even bother re-posting here? You wont have a problem if you just the games and make friends that way, you won't have to deal with horny dudes or perverts. There are legitimate predators that stalk this sub.

You'll make better friends by just playing the games you play trust me. It sucks playing by yourself but once you meet someone that's pretty cool just send them a friend request lol."
BattlefieldV,fff9d20,t1_ffesmdo,1579878930.0,"I didn't even bother with BFV. The only thing that kept me interested was the upcoming co-op mode and when it finally released, just like everything else with this game it was a total disappointment."
starterpacks,ffed661,t1_ffe2ngl,1579843715.0,Probably because he is a pussy
PS4,ffed31g,t3_eszmfr,1579843632.0,Well Microsoft really botched themselves this generation so that would make sense. Xbox 360 fans were pretty loyal up until Xbox one
worldnews,ffecrxr,t1_ffe9hmj,1579843340.0,">Anyone who claims that the US is just as bad doesn't know what they're talking about.

Are you high? Lol dude you are so far detached from reality if you think the US is on the level of China. We don't beat our doctors and scientists."
interestingasfuck,ffe55ou,t1_ffe4i8e,1579836970.0,Wrong anatomy. Its easier to jump like a loaded spring when you are all on 4 legs
DevilMayCry,ffe38n8,t3_et35vw,1579835542.0,Lol its already been on Netflix
BattlefieldV,ffe2wgp,t3_et492y,1579835291.0,"Just like everything good from the previous BF games, they were removed in BFV"
SciontC,ffe2b5n,t1_ffdxu0o,1579834851.0,I'm around the same mileage but 2014
