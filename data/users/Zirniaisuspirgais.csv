fatlogic,fedt17s,t1_fedoasj,1579019272.0,Whatever works as long as it works
fatlogic,fedsw87,t1_fedpf4b,1579019187.0,It's so hard to climb out of this hole with so much misinformation around. Awesome work dude
fatlogic,fedslmy,t1_feds9tk,1579019007.0,Bizarrely what used to be some of the liberal values have been reassigned to the right as the sjw culture gets more and more extreme.
fatlogic,fedsck0,t3_eokv7d,1579018851.0,"So where were all the fat people after siege of leningrad? People starved and died as predicted by their calorie poor diet. You cannot hold on to fat when you don't eat by definition because your body needs to generate kj to heat you and perform work out of somewhere.

By this logic those poor souls should've been candidates for my 600lb life."
fatlogic,fdoagnw,t1_fdo4nxf,1578601678.0,Indeed ;)
fatlogic,fdoa866,t1_fdnb7mi,1578601560.0,"Well my point was that carbs are not to blame for fatness, I agree that protein is good."
fatlogic,fdn4mf6,t1_fdmqsqr,1578577138.0,I'm from lithuania and had cheapest sliced bread types while I was in the us and didnt really notice the difference everyone keeps talking about haha. The only thing that was too sweet for what it needs to be were pickles.
fatlogic,fdn4hri,t3_em9kad,1578577031.0,"I've never heard doctors say shit like that, where do they keep finding doctors that are surprised at bodies functioning normally?"
fatlogic,fdn4dry,t3_em9fvl,1578576942.0,What kind of rejection? By lean tan 6'2 hunks? That's the cause of diabetes?
fatlogic,fdn3mhd,t3_em5j5q,1578576308.0,"The change is scary fast. When I was in middle school 10 years ago not a single child was overweight. (I'm from eastern europe) Today, children in their mid to early teens are almost all overweight or obese, with normal weight being a minority. 
Meanwhile food actually got way more expensive here, it's only the habits and culture around it that had changed at the speed of light."
fatlogic,fdn2tcg,t1_fdn2b19,1578575605.0,Men face obesity related fertility issues as well.
fatlogic,fdn2r5m,t1_fdn2b19,1578575552.0,Fat tissue interfered with testosterone production due to excess estrogen it secretes. Men being fatter today than 40 yrs ago means lower test.
fatlogic,fdn1b4m,t1_fdmxjga,1578574234.0,Everyone is being told that because carbs are a popular macro to blame right now.
fatlogic,fdn12ar,t1_fdmyndm,1578574001.0,Sugar is the devil hysteria is no more justified than fat is the devil hysteria of the 90s. This sub is just overrun with ketards preaching nonfacts.
fatlogic,fdmquyg,t1_fdmjz8s,1578561290.0,"Sugar consumption is down right now, similar to levels of the 80s."
fatlogic,fdmqqq0,t1_fdmnldw,1578561125.0,The thinnest nations on earth subsist on simple carbs for the most part. I'm talking white rice. Carbs is not the devil neither is sugar. Insulin mumbo jumbo is irrelevant to obesity.

Tolstoy means fat in russian btw"
fatlogic,fdi7iok,t1_fdi28n6,1578437121.0,">Tolstoy

wait wait why would by the post's logic white people be barred from reading Tolstoy?"
fatlogic,fdhmaxa,t1_fdgk3sf,1578425670.0,"Yup, healthy weight pcos person here. It's pretty asymptomatic for the most part other than irregular cycles."
fatlogic,fdgjfc0,t1_fddtlbj,1578399243.0,"Most parents are fat. Parents in evidence based groups are already predisposed to feeling haughty for being sciency instead of ignorant. So now it becomes: ""Me doing something wrong? Me of all people? Can't be, it's only other people who make mistakes."""
fatlogic,fdgiz8y,t1_fdfqgjc,1578398754.0,"My sister was on the verge of having a big section of her guts removed due to out of control Crohn's. Raw and high fibre foods can be terrible and damaging for Crohn's, I wonder if it's a good idea. The doctor had her on a nothing but simple carbs diet before she could eat again without risk of gut rupture."
fatlogic,fdgiqqs,t1_fdev55p,1578398484.0,Beans are an excellent prebiotic and full of vitamins and minerals. Whoever labeled them as not whole is a dumbass. Same goes for many grains.
fatlogic,fdgijo6,t1_fdgdqf2,1578398260.0,I'm a dumbass but I guess it has to do with excess estrogen secreted by fat tissue
fatlogic,fdeu1z7,t1_fdei7yw,1578346605.0,Or b-b-b-ut 120 hr workweeks and two to three jobs! After that all you can do is buy fast food  cause no time! (Meanwhile less than 5% of americans work 80hr workweeks with 35hrs being the average)

fatlogic,fdee58e,t3_ekhtoe,1578337050.0,"If you can spend 20+ bucks every day to feed your entire family with mcds and or snacky junk food you are not truly poor, end of story. Mismanaging your finances is more like it."
fatlogic,fd1nkl1,t1_fd1i4xv,1578133861.0,There's still a baseline one could eat and not get any fatter. It won't change fat moving to unflattering places but it will be less so.
fatlogic,fd12j0n,t1_fd0ogud,1578126895.0,"Cortisol changes fat distribution but it can't magic calories onto you, people with cushings still need energy to stay alive."
fatlogic,fczi0ld,t1_fcyyqvi,1578101689.0,"I'm no expert by any means but maybe going full body weight with extra flexibility? Or maybe doing a lot more reps with much smaller weights. Less injury, benefits of lifting, + more endurance. Sure it's less glamorous but still best of both worlds. My mom is in her late 40's and she's ripped from working with a 20kg kettlebell and around 8-10kg each free weights max. It actually healed her injured knee so weights can be good for joints if you're keeping them moderate."
fatlogic,fcx4ejb,t1_fcwxcdd,1578050738.0,"I could never stomach eating in the firsf couple hours after I wake up, protein even less so. Breakfast is highly optional for most people. In fact tudor farmers didn't have their first meal until noon so it's not a new fad or anything."
fatlogic,fcavm6q,t1_fc8rm7i,1577577491.0,"Thanks for the advice, but I'm not really struggling with appetite currently. I've a fussy stomach so I don't think I could handle an egg fried on bacon fat haha, I can hardly imagine how it's considered breakfast food too in many places"

fatlogic,fc2j7h5,t3_efuqxw,1577363054.0,"Tbh sugar does kill my appetite. It's a good advice for some. I could stave off eating dinner for a couple hours if I had some chocolate or a tsp of sugar.

Fat is another story though..."
