britishproblems,fdex5t2,t3_ekzd40,1578348469.0,"I guarantee there is a company out there that does nothing but study and show companies how to pull this shit. They have some dead, bloodless name like Nexxus Logistics or Consumer Trends Inc. and all they do is figure out how to get one less of anything in a package and make us pay the same price."

privacy,fbwf4op,t3_eeszwp,1577148273.0,"I’d go with canvasblocker. privacy.resistfingerprinting isn’t granular enough. Plus it restricts your window size a la tor browser/tails etc.

Canvasblocker + uBlock Origin is good enough unless you’re up to some serious business in which case I’d use Tails.

I think randomising your fingerprint would make you more unique though.
Better to have the same fingerprint as most other people ergo less unique?"
