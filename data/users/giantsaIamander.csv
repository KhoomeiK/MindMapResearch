socialanxiety,fewmuxs,t3_eqnhmf,1579415081.0,"This is the one thing a lot of people it’s social anxiety describe that I have never had an issue with. I am horrible interfacing with people in the real world but who cares online, you can delete stuff and make new accounts so there’s nothing to worry about"
socialanxiety,fewmpja,t3_eqoo23,1579414916.0,"I am 18, turning 19 in days. I have more problems than most people though.

Anyways, I am in complete belief that social anxiety does not just go away. You either work through it on your own or get help doing it. It takes work and isn’t something you should just forget about like I did"
socialanxiety,fdmng06,t3_em1qd6,1578556754.0,"Hard disagree. It’s tough but a valuable and necessary skill. Maybe this is t the way it should be encouraged, but it’s important."
socialanxiety,fdmnc57,t3_em53kg,1578556620.0,Nobody picks on me because I interact with nobody
socialanxiety,fdmn8lb,t3_em6js7,1578556498.0,"Always hated some of these adult norms.

Why do parties just have to be food and drink and talking? Maybe I’ve been to too few, only when my family drags me, but god damn it’s just hours of complete fucking boredom

Like whatever you like. We aren’t kids long enough"
depression,fdmmudj,t3_em30j6,1578556023.0,At least you had some kind of friends to begin with
depression,fdmm8rw,t3_em1ggo,1578555318.0,"I’ve only ever used reddit and YouTube, and only reddit as of recently."
depression,fdga2gy,t1_fdg9v0k,1578386609.0,"She told us to make our own groups and form our own study sessions with each other outside of class. I would just about rather fucking kill myself, and this is just normal college. I’d be more ok with it if the teacher wasn’t brain dead, although I think she’s accepted the fact there’s no way she’ll live past 50 judging by the size of her.

Sorry I’m just mad"
socialanxiety,fdcyoin,t3_ekl14d,1578288261.0,I laugh then I realize why I laughed and I no longer laugh
depression,fdcyhqm,t3_ekl4wl,1578288090.0,"It’s actually kind of scary how much I’ve come to not care. Earlier today some stranger came up to our car in the middle of the night, I didn’t see him but my dad seemed to very much think he was a threat and yelled at him to stay back. He doesn’t do that often to people. Anyways, I didn’t care at all while everyone else seemed totally freaked the fuck out by this guy. Really made me realize how bad my situation is."
socialanxiety,fb709l0,t1_fb6zoto,1576567473.0,"I used to, but I think over the years I became a lot more depressed and my interest plummeted. Really I only had surface level intelligence about most of that stuff anyways. Now I spend my days watching YouTube Netflix and on reddit now. And now that I’m out of high school and have way fewer classes than before, it’s gotten a lot worse.

I’m getting better day by day though. I think.

As for you though, join a group or something with your same interests. I love keeping snakes/dart frogs. There are forums all over the internet to get into these things. You could even start a YouTube channel. I did this back in 2016 and I found that it strongly motivated me to keep doing what I was doing. Get out there, doesn’t even have to involve any actual social interaction.

Like I said I’ve never had friends so I can not relate. I have an identical twin with all my same interests and that really keeps me from even trying, don’t know if that’s good or bad really.

I’ve learned most people that don’t suck are just not judge mental ( of unimportant things ). Even if you don’t notice it in most people when you meet someone like that you can tell the difference.

Neither of us are very old though. There’s time to improve and change. Know that people ( including me ) are suffering just like you are."
