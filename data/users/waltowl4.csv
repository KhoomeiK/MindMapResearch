Most of us who have full-blown manic episodes (BP1) crash pretty fucking hard after a few weeks of mania into suicidal depression. And only one or two manic episodes a year, depending on how well we adhere to our antimanic meds (lithium etc).

If you've just had some hypomanic episodes, that could account for your diagnosis. 

Also, many of us don't really remember our manias, and/or feel like we weren't manic, so just think we have depression.

Or maybe you're just depressed and were misdiagnosed, but I think you'll figure that out based on how the meds work for you."

Psych Ward Dr: Tell me about your last vacation, your recent spending, and your mood.

Me: I decided to go to Shanghai and Seoul for 6 weeks. I lost my job because of it, so I went to the casino to pay off my trip, and I lost $5k. Then I bought $40k of artwork and was gonna sell it to make my money back, but all of a sudden lost all motivation and decided I'd just commit suicide instead, and then I ended up here. I made some bad decisions, but I'm fine.

Dr: let's up your lithium, lower the lamictal, and get you back on the Seroquel that you keep refusing to take. I'll see you tomorrow morning. 

Me: so, tomorrow you'll let me go home?

Dr: tomorrow we'll see how the lithium is working."
