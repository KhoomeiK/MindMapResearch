artc,ff385ro,t3_erecre,1579535964.0,"Do not, at all, diminish what you did. Completing a marathon is fantastic in that you trained and stayed healthy enough to toe the line, and finish sub-4. This is a fine time to build on, should you choose to. The glucose-starved brain is a tough one to deal with in-race and after. Be critical later on, in objective fashion, as to help tailor what went well and what you could do better in future training phases and races. But for now, enjoy the accomplishment, rest and recover well."

Fairly complete meals in a very short period of time. They also make great boiled eggs. I have yet to have one that the peel does not just slide right off. Red beans and rice is one of my favorite meals to make in it. Drop a pork roast in it for pulled pork sandwiches. There's a tremendous number of recipes out there to look at."

houston,fdhk1ct,t3_ekw2dq,1578424293.0,"Podcasts and the occasional free Sirius trial when they're trying to lure me back. Oh, and KEXP from Seattle. It's listener supported (formerly KUOW University of Washington station), and also partnered with Paul Allen's Experience Music Project, and is a wonderful resource for new music of multiple genres, genre-specific shows throughout the week, and local artists from the Pac NW. They also have a lot of live in-studio performances. Commercial radio is soul-sucking."

Yes, it sucks."
AdvancedRunning,fdern1l,t1_fdep162,1578345171.0,"I kinda get what you're saying, though not sure ""more intense"" is what you should be looking for. Nothing much should really change with your workouts re: pacing (intensity) and volume. Both should be at a level corresponding to current fitness/conditioning. The hope would be that the creatine will help you get through them a bit easier and, yes, enhance recovery to some degree. Good luck!"
AdvancedRunning,fdeml80,t1_fdee2np,1578342203.0,"Also, if you decide to supplement, be aware of the typical protocols used: loading and maintenance. Probably for general endurance, a loading phase is not necessary, and you can just go right into a steady maintenance dose and keep it there throughout. Also, if you're not a meat eater, this will affect how much you should be using as well (per generally accepted recommendations)."
AdvancedRunning,fdelqfm,t1_fdee2np,1578341695.0,"I'm assuming you're talking about non track events. I suppose there could be with regards to enhancement of certain types of training sessions. Especially so if you're doing any sort of strength training concurrently. 
Nothing suggests harm in trying, and potentially may see benefit in performance such as interval work and, maybe, recovery. I'm skeptical, but it's not expensive to try really. Again, be aware of hydration status while using it."
AdvancedRunning,fddmpxq,t3_ektc25,1578317991.0,"Review energy systems with regards to running to see what it's role would be. In short, it facilitates a more rapid replacement of ATP in the muscles. Also, creatine doesn't ""boost"" water production. Water is retained in the muscle tissue as a result of creatine uptake, especially if utilizing a loading protocol. It's not something that works on an ""as used"" basis. It requires accumulation over the course of several days. In general, the longer the performance interval, the less relevant creatine supplementation will be. It can improve the quality of workouts and short burst activity. For runners especially, the weight gain due to water retention would be less desirable as well as also requiring the need for enhanced hydration. There's some literature around its use in ultra runners, but I am not familiar with overwhelming evidence that supports consistent use in runners beyond the sprints."

AdvancedRunning,fcvfejb,t1_fcvd7fv,1578000949.0,"I agree. I like a Tifosi, or even the Foster Grant Ironman, wrap-style glasses. They provide much more coverage from peripheral glare than a Goodr style version. In Houston summers, that's a big plus for me. Different shades fit differently too, so best to try on if possible. That said, I do like Goodr for general wear and driving, and they are decently priced."
