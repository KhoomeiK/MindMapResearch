As I said, you lot are delusional and spoiled, thinking your experience is everyone's experience. Do you realize and understand that many do not even have the ability to 'work smart', as you define it?"
worldnews,ff3w170,t1_ff3vjdh,1579550086.0,"You are delusional. 
If you're a bricklayer, you will end up with nothing and a fucked up back. If you're a nurse, you will end up working so many hours it'll lead to a burnout. If you work as a stock broker however - adding nothing at all to society - you might just end up earning thousands if not millions. Hard work does not pay off, neither does 'working smart'.

It is clear you are overlooking all those people who did work hard, did work 'smart', had 'marketable skills' (whatever all that means), and did not make it.
As I said, look up survivorship bias, because that's all you are espousing. A clear bias."

Een domme aanname gezien dat vaak niet het geval is. Het gaat constant over patronen herkennen en dat soort nutteloos gelul, wat rechtstreeks uit de CBT (cognitive behaviour therapy) komt.

De onbekwaamheid van zowel huisartsen als het hele systeem van doorverwijzingen en wachtlijsten verergerd de boel alleen maar. Er zijn huisartsen zo incompetent dat ze je alsnog het riedeltje vertellen, dat je maar moet lopen, of een sport moet doen, om uit een depressie te komen! Werkelijk te treurig voor woorden."

This is the article used as a source in every article about this NGO. If I understood it correctly, they have solar fields which energy is stored in Tesla batteries. This saved power is used to break the osmotic pressure without all kinds of chemical pollutants and such.

And yes; that is in essence why I made the original comment. I dislike admiration without looking at the person you are admiring critically, which was very apparent when Diana (the Princess) died for example. Talking about an individual being a ""template for society"" is however very strange and detached from reality to me."

The guy is trying to draw parallels between a society where you are monitored by the state, cannot hold opinions that are contrary to the state (or you'll get arrested and/or killed) and much more.
The idiotic president of China has successfully altered the law so that he can reign for more than two terms, and anyone equating China to particular localised mishaps in the US has no idea what it is like to live in a dictatorship."
