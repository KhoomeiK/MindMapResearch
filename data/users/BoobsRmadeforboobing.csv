philosophy,feii5qm,t1_fei8i9r,1579139083.0,"It does not require the ethical framework to be made explicit to do good, but having the concepts of 'good' and 'bad' would imply an ethical framework, I think.
I think (young) babies don't do things with the intention of being good or bad, they just so what feels good. For example, offering to share your snack with your fellow baby makes you feel good, because there's a finely tuned system that releases feel-good chemicals when it detects an input of perhaps laughter and a smile of the receiving baby. Babies seem almost pre-ethical."
philosophy,feh52k8,t1_feh1gfs,1579109306.0,"Very interesting, thank you.

I concede I might have a narrow view of ethics, I did one year of philosophy and am by no means an expert. 

But I do always wonder how specifically philosophical arguing can be out of fashion, or how there can be a 'cutting edge' of current philosophical questioning. It seems to me that philosophy is the first science, in the sense that it's looking for the essence of being, existence and the human condition. Metaphysics specifically. This would imply that it is looking for a sort of independent truth, so to speak. Something that cannot be en vogue or not, something immutable. 
I might be misguided in that ofc, but it feels if the reasoning can be coloured by culture, it's a matter of not focusing on the right things right?"
philosophy,feh3y8f,t1_fegznff,1579108645.0,"Your first example is a good example of utilitarianism. Two counter arguments to that the idea:

I would argue that
1) the value of life is not necessarily a numbers game. Would you sacrifice ten good, empathic people to save 100 serial killers? 
Or say you could save a million people by sacrificing yourself. You cannot foresee the waves of causality that causes. Maybe one day you are at a Starbucks, making some generic smalltalk with the person next to you and that smalltalk combined with the particular way that persons thinking works, gives that person the seed of the idea that would later become the cure to malaria. You might have inadvertently and indirectly caused less people to be saved, by sacrificing yourself to save a million.



2) if you do measure the value of life in numbers, and you would sacrifice yourself to save x million others, it would still be a self-centered act, only the 'self' in this case would be the self on a later scale: your group. In this case, humanity.
You cannot know what life will sprout on earth after we are gone. In a sense, we are keeping earth 'occupied'. Is our continued existence something to preserve, if that would mean other post-human races will never develop? Do we have more right to exist simply because we exist at this time? 
If not, the utilitarian argument cannot be made, because though we do know how many humans there are, we have no way of knowing how many post-human lives we are preventing from existing. With only one of those numbers known, we cannot determine what would be a good course of action according to utilitarianism.

Hell, if time stretches out to infinity ahead of us, it would be all but certain that what comes after us is way bigger than us, simply because the future is infinite. By that logic, it would be immoral not to immediately destroy all life on earth."

philosophy,fegwe1b,t1_fegszm7,1579104022.0,"I totally agree with your point that we come from this world rather than come in to it.

But why is it bad to destroy the world? Sounds like a dumb question ofc, but I mean if you boil it down to brass tacks, don't you always end up with a selfish motivation? 'because I want humans to survive'. Ok but why? Obviously it's desirable; we are humans and we have a drive to survive. But if we step out of that self centered perspective: why should the earth or the universe care if everything on earth lives or dies? Earth will go on. It happened before with the dinosaurs and though that is different in that they were not responsible for it, it does show that earth will be here long after we and every animals and plant is dead.

Again, let me reiterate: let's not destroy the ecosystem, I too want to live. But that is apart from any ethics, it's just my feelsies"
philosophy,feguxp8,t1_fegs6xn,1579103100.0,"I would disagree this is normal philosophical discourse. At least not through the lens of ethics. 

I see the argument that people who preserve ecosystems should look to a more individual level to help. Great sentiment, but beside that this argument seems ultimately boil down to 'it is better', we have not established in this writing why we should help ecosystems in the first place. That is taken as a given. 
Again, *of course we should*, but I would like to hear his reasoning why. The implication here, if I read it right, is that otherwise the ecosystem might collapse. Yes ok, but that is a practical argument, based on either the implicit assertion that life has inherent value, or on some implicit axioms 'It is good to live', 'i want to live', and so on. 

So we should save animals because we want to live? Sure, but again, that seems an assertion with no attached ethical reasoning behind it.

Edit: Take the final conclusion of this article for example:

>we have two reasons to help many >animals: they are suffering and dying, >and we are either partly or wholly >responsible.

This is not a conclusion. These are two observations. For practical intents and purposes that is fine, but shouldn't this be the point where the philosophy begins?"
philosophy,fegtjc1,t1_fegrqq4,1579102199.0,"Well all those things have different answers according to different schools of philosophical thought.

For example; does intent matter? 
No says the hobbesian, not in the state of nature, only strength counts.
No says the nihilist. Yes says the deontologist. Depends on the circumstances, says the utilitarian. And so on. 

So according to this writer, what is responsibility, what is the ethical framework that should compel people to do good? What if someone is a callous sociopath who doesn't feel that responsibility? What would be the thinking of this writer to convince someone like that to help animals? Other than reassert 'it is our responsibility'. 

I agree with the point, but I am interested in how he gets to that point."

'If our actions are harming other animals, then we have a responsibility to try to reduce or repair these harms.'

Agreed, but it is just a claim with no philosophy attached. The preceding paragraphs are a list of the myriad of ways we hurt animals, a preamble. The paragraphs following the claim are about how to. But the claim itself is simply stated and taken for granted. Where is the philosophy? Am I missing something?

Edit: so. This is embarrassing, but it turns out I did miss something; the majority of the article in fact. Did not realise there was a lot more below the 'sign up to our newsletter'-box.
