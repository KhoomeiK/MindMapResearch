No one can be sure where it came from or what will help because they just don’t know much about it.  The best thing I’ve found is do physical therapy, preferably with someone who has worked with neuro disorders, and then just try other things until something helps.  It’s trial and error but the physical therapy seems like a must if your daughter is affected in that way."

offmychest,fcn1v2q,t3_ehzeiy,1577800883.0,I’m sorry. I know it’s hard especially with New Years here and the way our media smashes us over the head with unrealistic expectations of socializing.

In fact I have a severe physical handicap and am about to be homeless, and she told me last year I belong in a nursing home if I can’t take care of myself fully on my own.  I’m 32.

I can relate to your situation and I’m sorry you have to go through that.  If you ever want to talk about it you can message me."

Living out of a van sounds fun but wait until you’re hungry and cold and getting hassled by police or worse. I’m not saying you won’t learn a lot, because one does in situations like that, just that if you don’t get your degree you may find you’re 35 and living out of a van because you HAVE to.

offmychest,fc1da3q,t1_fc1cqxy,1577315313.0,Well I hope when you are living with your fiancÃ© if youâ€™re not already that you wonâ€™t have to be subjected to your moms nonsense as much. We all deserve to be free from such blatantly aggressive and hurtful words.
offmychest,fc1d4dl,t3_efmly0,1577315180.0,"You donâ€™t have to be sorry, youâ€™re trying to get better, youâ€™re trying to comfort yourself.  Thatâ€™s a great thing.  

In Dialectical Behavioral Therapy there is a concept called radical acceptance. The premise is you accept yourself fully and completely, no matter the circumstances.  But at the same time, you try to improve and grow.  You do both at once, which sounds kind of weird to a Western mind as we are taught to see in black and white only and only one at a time, but it is a powerful and useful idea.  

What would you like to do if you found more energy to do it?"

At the very least youâ€™ve learned what YOU like.  Try not to bash them for how they want to live, but look on them with pity and understanding.  You will see much more if you go through life that way.  They are consenting adults."
offmychest,fc1c81w,t3_efmtj0,1577314421.0,"Iâ€™m glad you decided to share. Thatâ€™s a great step.  I donâ€™t think you sound like this or that, youâ€™re a human being.  Yes you need help right now but we all do.  I hope you will keep trying to get it.  I was hospitalized a bunch as a teenager as well and I can say that while it doesnâ€™t always get better, you do learn more and more coping skills over the years.  Keep going, stay safe, go into the hospital if you need to.  Itâ€™s better to go through that then doing something that canâ€™t be undone."

offmychest,fc1boid,t3_efmuqj,1577313958.0,Thatâ€™s a horrible thing to hear from oneâ€™s mom.  Goodness thatâ€™s just so messed up.  Do you think it would help at all to just ignore her when she says those things instead of trying to respond to illogical statements with logical answers?
offmychest,fc1bj2l,t3_efmvme,1577313831.0,"Iâ€™m sorry youâ€™re feeling so badly today. I can relate.  For what itâ€™s worth, I once had a therapist who told me thinking these thoughts is a positive sign because it means you want things to change."

offmychest,fc0sh0a,t3_efjgoc,1577298610.0,"Thatâ€™s rough. I know what you mean though, my reactions to people being less than nice often get me in trouble too.  I always end up swallowing it and doing what I need to to make sure I have a roof over my head and food on the table.  Itâ€™s crushing to oneâ€™s sense of self. But thatâ€™s not completely a bad thing in my opinion"

offmychest,fc0kc5b,t3_effcta,1577292835.0,"I know what you mean.  I try to challenge myself by saying, â€œwhen I get hungry enough I eat, when I get too cold I put on a hatâ€ etc.  the fact is no one is indifferent.  Even now you seem to wish you cared more.  Thatâ€™s not indifference.  Remind yourself you care, have needs and wants and you deserve to try to meet those."
offmychest,fc0k0gl,t3_efhjb0,1577292572.0,Iâ€™m so sorry.  Iâ€™m glad you have friends and a good partner to help ease these burdens.
offmychest,fc0jx5e,t3_efhnjc,1577292502.0,I have felt the same way for a long time.  Then I met an amazing woman.  I ruined that relationship romantically but it just shows that sometimes the blessings we least expect are right around the corner.  But we need to keep walking...
offmychest,fc0jqkj,t3_efg42w,1577292381.0,"Keep going friend, the goodness in this world needs people to carry it."
offmychest,fc0gnky,t3_efdg30,1577290426.0,"Iâ€™m so sorry, I am also in this position. I ruined things with my ex, and I often have a hard time respecting her boundaries after going from 60 to 0 in days time. My fault, but still difficult. That vacancy can be torturous and terrible to feel.  I believe if we focus on improving ourselves, perhaps we can have things like this again in the future.  If you need or want someone to talk to, please feel free to message me.  Like I said Iâ€™m in a very similar boat although it sounds like I was much more at fault than you were."
offmychest,fc0fdu9,t3_effrh8,1577289430.0,Congratulations. Make the most of it by treating him and yourself kindly and appreciatively.
offmychest,fc0ag0s,t1_fc00slo,1577284934.0,"Quite true.  You donâ€™t owe them anything, they had YOU, and being their thing to kick around isnâ€™t part of that deal.  Itâ€™s great to take care of ones parents but not at the expense of your own sanity."
offmychest,fc0abdz,t1_fbzvp0c,1577284808.0,"Iâ€™m sure it is really hard, as if getting through college wasnâ€™t hard enough.  Unfortunately it seems parents or people that do this just keep asking for more the more you do.  I hope you can assert yourself and Iâ€™m so sorry to hear about your dad leaving you.  Thatâ€™s terrible."
offmychest,fbzo36i,t3_ef9jza,1577253538.0,"Seconded. Many of us are out there going through more or less the same thing.  Maybe we can imagine a comfortable party where all of us are together, being understanding and kind."

offmychest,fbzni93,t3_efalqk,1577252886.0,"For me, it comes down to â€œwhat is being hurt and what is being gainedâ€?  Gender issues donâ€™t seem to be eroding society, in fact they seem to be making society look itself in the mirror and decide if we want to suppress the right to pursue individual liberty and happiness or if we want to live and let live, when a thing isnâ€™t dangerous of course.  

Iâ€™m a Christian (eternal hell is a lie, all are saved).  I really doubt God cares more about how a person looks talks or thinks of their gender than he cares about their hearts.   What I mean is, for me, I say who cares?  Why do we need to confront a small group of people who just want to feel comfortable in their bodies and in their societies?"
offmychest,fbzmnrf,t1_fbzmhm1,1577251960.0,"Of course, I donâ€™t mean to sound invalidating. Just that being surrounded by people and yet feeling super alone is in my experience almost as traditional as chocolate chip cookies haha.  A merry Christmas to you too. :)"
offmychest,fbzm2ak,t3_ef7u50,1577251332.0,"I think our society is going to soon challenge and fundamentally altar the traditional Christmas dynamic.  Too many of us are depressed at the very thought of it.  I predict Christmas will within 25 years be a shell of what it is now because people are fed up.  We are waking up to the hypocrisy, the lies and the materialistic worship."
offmychest,fbzlhtw,t3_efc9ov,1577250748.0,"Family that wonâ€™t apologize ever is intolerable. Iâ€™m so sorry you get invalidated in these ways.  I know how that feels for me, and it can drive you nuts if youâ€™re a reflective person.  Itâ€™s so cruel to do that to someone, like telling a child theyâ€™re from outer space."

offmychest,fbzl58v,t3_efbtcn,1577250397.0,"Congrats you have just experienced a traditional Gentile celebration of their lord and savior. (Iâ€™m a Christian Quaker by the way).  But seriously, this sounds like one of the best case scenarios.  Iâ€™m sorry it wasnâ€™t what you hoped though.  Celebrating with a new family can be hard even when theyâ€™re outgoing and inclusive and warm."
offmychest,fbzkwl8,t3_efb79t,1577250163.0,"Itâ€™s awesome you stopped to talk to him despite being afraid initially as is understandable. This is what makes humanity worth fighting for, stories like these.  Could we always do more?  Sure, of course.  And if you feel inspired to go back out and try to help him further thatâ€™s beautiful.  But you also already Something.  And if we all did more Somethings, a few of us wouldnâ€™t need to do Much More Something.  In my opinion being open and helpful to the poorest among us is the height of Gods work and will."

lifewithCD,fbzkd7n,t1_f6ndekp,1577249636.0,"Sadly it seems most doctors, especially the higher up the food chain they go, have no interest in their oaths to do no harms.  They look at patients the way we would look at an insect we are dissecting in biology class.  Interest insofar as the interest furthers our ends, but absolutely zero care for the insect itself as anything more than a pile of meat and bone, so far inferior that inferior doesnâ€™t even fit."
lifewithCD,fbzk3i1,t3_e1pbe1,1577249371.0,"Personally i think conversion disorder as a term is a great disservice to us.  Anxiety can cause symptomatic increase in other conditions such as Parkinsonâ€™s and MS.  They want us to think weâ€™re not valid like those conditions.  The brain and body share information, itâ€™s what they do.  Youâ€™re not converting anything. Youâ€™re just a living conscious human being with a body, feelings and a nervous system."
