doggrooming,ff6pxnr,t3_erxsfp,1579632427.0,"Sorry to hear you’re having such a rough time. :( I had similar experiences my first year of grooming. When I was in academy especially I had a horrible time and was sure I didn’t actually want to groom, and the first year following had a ton of ups and downs. I would have some days where I would literally cry my way through the work. After about the one year mark, I finally started to gain enough confidence in my skills to get through the days without a meltdown, and it’s been a slow uphill progression since then. Educating myself on different techniques, picking up quick fixes for common problems, and finding ways to streamline my process all helped me feel less overwhelmed every day. 

I think the hardest part is that it self perpetuates. When you work stressed and upset, the dogs pick up on that emotion and become stressed and upset as well, making the job harder. Learning to emotionally self soothe and detach myself from the emotional aspect from grooming helped a ton. Consider checking out DBT self soothing skills, and don’t feel bad taking a five minute break away from your dog to decompress sometimes. Taking five minutes to calm yourself can easily save you fifteen minutes of stressed wrestling with an equally stressed dog. 

I would speak to the friend you work with about these feelings. Maybe you can try working less hours per week, or taking less dogs per day, and seeing if that helps you settle things emotionally while you consider your options. Good luck, I hope things improve for you whether that means continuing to groom or not :)"

doggrooming,ferpl45,t3_eqfh8m,1579356908.0,"Her breed and coat type aren’t meant to be shaved, so keep in the back of your mind to try and accept that her coat may never be totally full and fluffy. Obviously the shave wasn’t your choice, but shaving double coated dogs always comes with the warning that the hair will grow back differently if it grows back at all. I’m not saying it will definitely be patchy and goofy looking forever, but it may never look like it did before shaving. 

To stimulate healthy hair growth, you definitely want to brush frequently, but brushing a shaved double coated dog goes a little differently. Their hair holds onto the undercoat a lot harder, so I find the best thing here is using small strokes to remove small amounts of undercoat at a time. I definitely agree regular professional grooming is your best bet, and maintain her in between with regular brushing.

Consider skin and coat supplements too, to further encourage healthy growth. The short version of why shaving a double coated dog does so much damage is that the undercoat grows much more quickly than the top coat, and the top coat is only meant to grow once in the dogs life. The top guard hairs have a long lifespan, this is why it can take puppies literal years to grow into a full adult coat."

doggrooming,fepcse1,t3_eqangi,1579317347.0,"YouTube has a treasure trove of educational videos, GroomerTV is a good go to resource. Each groomer does heads a little differently so watch a bunch and you’ll pick up new tips from each one and can decide what ones work best for your grooming style :)

If you struggle with one side of the face more than the other, try doing that side first! A lot of times it’s hard to work on your non-dominant side since it feels backwards. If you make a mistake scissoring, you can match it easier on the side you have better control. Consider standing at a different angle around the dog also. I usually scissor most of the face looking straight at the dog, but for the left side (non dominant side for me) to tidy it up I’ll stand on the left side of the dog slightly behind, giving me a good angle to come in with my right hand again. 

Also I don’t think using snap ons on the head is cheating ;) I use them on the head on almost every dog I do. If you’re using them against the grain on the head you will usually have to do a little scissor tidying to clean up, but they’re a quick way to get length off and start shaping up. For shih tzus especially I will mainly only clip with the grain of the hair, and use a light touch. A Shih Tzu shaved (#5 or #7) I would probably use the peach comb, skimming once from back to front of the head against the grain, and then following the grain of the hair all over the top of head and sides of the head. I don’t usually do snapons on the mustache area, I scissor that. On a shih tzu with a super short muzzle I also find it easier and cleaner looking to just clip all around the eyes with a #10

IMO the head and face are the hardest part so don’t worry if they are taking the longest to learn. They’re the first thing the owner sees, and what they’re going to look at most, so taking a little extra time to tidy them isn’t a bad idea. Keep practicing, I’m sure your work is coming along great :)"

petsmart,fe6meu2,t3_enzolr,1578895867.0,"IMO grooming is a skill you learn more every day so for only working six shifts so far it sounds like you’re doing really fantastic! No one should be pushing you to do more work than you’re comfortable with yet so don’t aim for speed. Learning to do a GOOD and thorough job should come before worrying about speed. 

Efficiency is a good word though and a good idea to consider! I find that the easiest way to become more efficient is to make a routine and follow it as strictly as you can. I always start nail clipping on the same foot and work around the dog in the same order, I always start bathing with the water running on the same foot and wash the body parts in the same order, etc. It helps me ensure each task is done before moving on so I’m not jumping from task to task, and I know exactly what to work on next if I have to pause my grooming for the phone or a walk in. 

Depending on the size of the St Bernard I don’t think an hour to dry is unreasonable, maybe a bit long, and you will indeed get quicker with experience. I have been grooming 3 yrs now and STILL find that drying takes me longer than it “should” bc I refuse to compromise on a dog being completely dry but also refuse to stress dogs out by drying forcefully. A totally dry dog is IMO just cleaner, the coat feels nicer when finished and you can brush out sooooo much more shedding fur AND if the dogs getting a haircut it is the key to a smooth finish. My main drying tip is again to work in a routine and work methodically, I usually dry in sections and don’t move on until that body part is dry or at least mostly dry. Another thing I like to do is give dogs ear protection, I put a fresh cotton ball into each ear, I don’t press it in deeply but sort of fluff it into the ear canal opening. It seems to make them less stressed about the dryer, which usually lets me use a higher dryer setting. 

Sorry if I wrote too much, I probably could have kept going for a lot longer here rambling lol. If you have any questions I’d be happy to try and answer. It sounds like you’re off to a great start, just remember to keep learning every day and that each dog will teach you something new :)"

The Andis Ultra Edge blades are my go to brand, but I recommend against the ceramic edge, I find they don’t clip as smoothly and dull faster, and don’t stay cool for longer which is their main selling point lol. You’ll definitely want at least two 10 blades and two 30 blades, and then 7f 5f 4f blades. I also recommend getting a 3f blade, it’s one of my favorite lengths but Andis doesn’t make one.

Wahl stainless steel snap on combs are a godsend as well. Don’t get the magnetic snap ons though they do NOT stay on the clipper lol

And for a bonus if you have a large budget, consider looking at the Wahl Bravura cordless clipper. It has a 5 in 1 blade that goes from a 9 to a 40 and is perfect for little things like doing around faces feet sani etc. It doesn’t replace a full corded clipper but personally I think it makes my life so much easier lol.

doggrooming,fdfx4wj,t1_fdfvie9,1578372619.0,"Good question! The answer depends on a few factors. For owners I will always agree with this because it is almost always true in an at home setting. When water enters the mats it does begin to tighten them up, especially if they aren’t being dried properly, so it’s best to do any major detangling on your dog 

But in a salon setting /SOMETIMES/ you have the tools to save /SOME/ coats. Unless the matting is really severe, I rarely shave dogs down before the bath anymore and most go directly into the tub. My rule of thumb on if I think a coat can be saved/partially saved is if water can penetrate to the skin or not, generally speaking. If water can penetrate into and through the matting to the skin, I will wash these dogs and use a high quality conditioner, then ensure they are totally completely rinsed and then immediately dried using a high velocity dryer. Often times you can loosen the matting and push it away from the skin using the power of the forced air. Light matting is often loosened enough to be easily brushed, a lot of the more matted dogs still do need to be shaved but it might be the difference between getting a #7f all over vs a #4f or #3f.

Double coated dogs especially sometimes are less matted than they are full of excessive and impacted undercoat, so with them if you can get water into the coat and essentially lubricate the undercoat you can push it away from the skin or out of the coat completely in a lot of cases."
doggrooming,fdfnsub,t3_el4qby,1578365980.0,"My strategy for this dog would probably be HV first and see if I can dislodge some coat and assess the matting situation better, if I think the coat seems salvageable then directly into the bath for two shampoos and a conditioner, using the HV in between to again dislodge coat but also to ensure further product penetration into the coat and to remove excess product to help rinse the dog a bit quicker. I also will sometimes use a pin brush with smooth widely spaced pins when in the tub to ensure the shampoo/conditioner is spread all down to the skin, but I’m definitely not trying to brush out coat when I use it. Spray with brushing spray or leave in conditioner, then HV to dry. Any matting left will, at minimum, be moved away from the skin for an easier brush out. 

At that point if any large mats remain I would get the PP call on spot shaving, or large mats that aren’t close to the skin I will sometimes use thinning shears and chop it a few times without trying to cut it apart, just to give myself some openings to begin trying to detangle and brush apart the mat.

I do agree that weekly baths is probably excessive though, and often doing that will dry out the skin. Every other week may be better if you’re concerned for the person with allergies, but most dogs don’t need bathing even that often! Especially if you’re brushing often, the dander and loose hair from your dog is probably well under control already.
