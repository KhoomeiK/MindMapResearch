nier,ffhxo1g,t3_etpuf0,1579958397.0,Definitely way cheaper looking but how much was this vs the original price? I want a 2B figure but I'm also poor lmao
guineapigs,ffhxhgl,t3_etql20,1579958187.0,"As long as it's a good temperature outside (~65-75F) that's fine! I even saw someone (online, sadly not in person lol) use a pet stroller for them haha"

I only had like $4 to spend for my first gift but I hope to have more in the future :D Any survey apps you'd recommend to earn gift cards? All the ones I try give like 20 cents after a 15 minute survey and it's like... I could have earned so much more just working that amount of time, lol"

Anyone have any fun iOS games they want to recommend? I'm in the mood for something new but not sure what, so any genre is fine besides gambling/slots/etc (never found those kind fun).

Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,ffgyjfr,t3_etk44l,1579918360.0,"I've only been able to gift once so far because money's tight but I got a gift card, I searched the daily thread for people to talk to and chose someone I had a nice chat with that had something on their list within my gift card amount. Next time I can gift I think I want to do a contest though :)"
Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,ffgya9l,t1_ffgt2o6,1579918171.0,"I think my favorite part about having been a barista was learning about all the kinds of milks/milk substitutes. I got so many free drinks over the 2 years or so that I tried all kinds of combos... definitely learned the taste and texture differences, which to use when, etc. Aanndd now I'm craving an iced almond milk macchiato lol"
Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,ffgsg3q,t1_ffgsd1h,1579913884.0,I've tried iced teas and I do like it a bit better! Still not as good as iced coffee though. I'm not a fan of hot drinks in general tbh
Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,ffgsawz,t3_eth8qs,1579913782.0,That's so cute! I love the sentiment on the card too :)

QOTD My favorite movie is Mamma Mia! It's so silly and lighthearted, plus who doesn't love ABBA? Also bonus points for being set in Greece where I want to move to eventually :) 

Any anime fans in here? I just started watching Jojo's Bizarre Adventure the other day and... I actually kind of like it? It's such an odd show but I knew that before going in lol"
NieRAutomataGame,ffgs0pq,t3_etjn4g,1579913578.0,It's been a little while but... maybe 2 hours? A little more? Make sure you're not rushing it especially for ending E though
Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,ffgrsjq,t3_etdx9h,1579913413.0,"I've been getting more into tea lately but I'm veerrryy picky with what kinda I have and how it's made. I like matcha a lot lately but it's so expensive compared to other teas! 

On the other hand, I've worked at two different coffee places before so I definitely have a taste for that. I love iced lattes and iced macchiatos in particular, but tbh almost any (preferably cold) coffee drink I'll love lol"
nier,ffgrjnd,t3_eteg6v,1579913236.0,Cute!! I couldn't go to any of the concerts unfortunately but I'll also be cosplaying Kaine in March for a local con :D
