hockey,fesln4j,t3_eqh8t3,1579366522.0,"It's just a cycle of revenge. That's all it ever becomes. One guy doesn't like something another guy did and takes matters into his own hands. Players are biased, they're never gonna like a big hit being given to them or a teammate. Whether it was dirty or clean.

 And on the other side of it, the players who make those types of hits aren't going to be deterred because a fight might come their way because for the vast majority of them the willingness to make hits like that are a big part of the reason why they have a spot in the NHL. Most of them aren't as skilled otherwise as Tkachuk is so that's their meal ticket. If they back down it's back to bussing around the AHL or overseas. 

So it's not gonna get better with the way the league has allowed things to play out. Players aren't objective and don't ""protect"" each other, they take revenge. The players that make those hits won't stop because their NHL job is on the line. The league is the only party that can fix this, not the players. Instead they slap on half assed band aids like the instigator rule or ""aggressor rule""."

I want to see more advanced stats being brought into the game, most especially the broadcasts. It doesn't have to be anything crazy detailed, at least not at first, but some basic ones  should start being presented at some point. 

The problem is the stereotype of the whole advanced stats community in pretty much  any sport. Where the meatballs and mouth breathers argue that it's nothing but boling things down to a number and not watching the games, blah, blah blah on and on. So when a relatively well known brand (at least within the hockey community) like Evolving-Hockey  come out with fucking batshit takes like that all it does is play into those meatball sports fans' hands perfectly. There aren't 200 forwards you're taking before Ovechkin. There aren't 200 forwards you're taking before Patrick Kane. There aren't. That's fucking nuts. But that's how  they present stuff.

Yes Nolan's Batman movies were ""gritty"" and realistic and out of all the Batman live action films probably the best made ones when it comes to the technical aspect of film making. But as a Batman movie?  It starts falling short there for me. When it comes to how he handles characters, his takes and decisions on characters, that's where it really kinda loses me in some areas.  Like I think they completely wasted Harvey Dent, just as an example. I think there are a lot of things they did to try to ""ground"" the movies so it would feel plausible in real life which conflicts with a lot of other things that happen in those movies that would or could never happen in real life. Things like that.  

The whole time I felt like he was working those movies with sort of a hatred of the idea of the label ""comicbook movie"". But it's okay to be that, it's okay to embrace that.

hawks,febclnz,t1_fe99gdj,1578957500.0,They didn't. It was the exact opposite of that. They built such a good team in front of the goalie they won their first Cup with just some guy from Finland in net that used to clean the  ice before playing in the game overseas.
hawks,febawx3,t1_fe93r4t,1578957049.0,"Well they didn't get one in that trade. What they got was one of the slower d-men in the game  that also has injury problems with a 4m cap hit. He was pretty much the last type of player, especially for their blue line, they should have wanted.

That's  not saying Kahun is an incredible player, but I can say he's easily better than Nylander. So they don't make that trade, they don't make the incredibly bad trade for Nylander and they're easily a better team and , more importantly, better set up moving forward. Combine that with the equally bad reacquisition of Shaw and that's 8 million of the cap wasted. On a team that is capped out and not a playoff team. That's bad."

Give me a fucking break dude. Part of the reason of what makes him effective is him doing that. He's not going to stop. Kassian fighting him is not going to make him, or any other pro for that matter that plays similarly, change. That's not how it works, not when you're a professional athlete and when doing so for some of them it could mean the difference between busing around in the AHL or somewhere overseas or having your dream job with a spot on a NHL team. 

Relying even a little bit on the idea that the players can police themselves in lieu of  on ice and/or supplemental discipline is incredibly naive and foolish. The only way to curb behavior like this has to come from an objective third party that has the power to REALLY make a difference in that player's future and earning potential. That's the league. That's the only way it's gonna change."

 And on the other side of it, the players who make those types of hits aren't going to be deterred because a fight might come their way because for the vast majority of them the willingness to make hits like that are a big part of the reason why they have a spot in the NHL. Most of them aren't as skilled otherwise as Tkachuk is so that's their meal ticket. If they back down it's back to bussing around the AHL or overseas. 

So it's not gonna get better with the way the league has allowed things to play out. Players aren't objective and don't ""protect"" each other, they take revenge.

hockey,febhg8c,t1_febgbe4,1578958807.0,"When enforcers were at their peak, when this so called deterrent was at an all time high, there was more shit like that than ever before in the league. It doesn't make a difference. It doesn't, we should know this by now. We've seen it, it's history. Learn from it."
hockey,febgrx7,t1_febaouz,1578958650.0,This doesn't read well at all.
hockey,febfr69,t1_feb8ji1,1578958339.0,So because of something that is still allowed to happen exists.....this still happened lol. I don't get people trying to argue fighting changes stuff like this. Just say you like to see fights. That's at least being honest.
hawks,febclnz,t1_fe99gdj,1578957500.0,They didn't. It was the exact opposite of that. They built such a good team in front of the goalie they won their first Cup with just some guy from Finland in net that used to clean the  ice before playing in the game overseas.
hawks,febawx3,t1_fe93r4t,1578957049.0,"Well they didn't get one in that trade. What they got was one of the slower d-men in the game  that also has injury problems with a 4m cap hit. He was pretty much the last type of player, especially for their blue line, they should have wanted.

That's  not saying Kahun is an incredible player, but I can say he's easily better than Nylander. So they don't make that trade, they don't make the incredibly bad trade for Nylander and they're easily a better team and , more importantly, better set up moving forward. Combine that with the equally bad reacquisition of Shaw and that's 8 million of the cap wasted. On a team that is capped out and not a playoff team. That's bad."
hockey,fe8cj3q,t1_fe4cy3e,1578924801.0,"So going on that logic Tkachuk won't be doing that anymore right? The same thing that he's been doing since he entered the league? Give me a fucking break dude. Part of the reason of what makes him effective is him doing that. He's not going to stop. Kassian fighting him is not going to make him, or any other pro for that matter that plays similarly, change. That's not how it works, not when you're a professional athlete and when doing so for some of them it could mean the difference between busing around in the AHL or somewhere overseas or having your dream job with a spot on a NHL team. 

Relying even a little bit on the idea that the players can police themselves in lieu of  on ice and/or supplemental discipline is incredibly naive and foolish. The only way to curb behavior like this has to come from an objective third party that has the power to REALLY make a difference in that player's future and earning potential. That's the league. That's the only way it's gonna change."
EscapefromTarkov,fe7nr65,t3_enw17s,1578917142.0,Seriously they need to make that room start the extract countdown as soon as you step foot in it.
hawks,fe6lkj7,t1_fe6imyc,1578894979.0,"I don't know what's going on with him, haven't really looked into it other than his points are way down. My point was that for what the Devil's gave up for him it wasn't a bad trade at all."
hawks,fe6htib,t1_fe6cejb,1578891342.0,"No it wasn't. For what they gave up and the cap space they had you make that trade every time. Because he's had a bad year doesn't make it a bad trade. 

Here's a bad trade. Jokiharju for Nylander. Kahun for Maatta."
hockey,fe66o97,t1_fe5v1mg,1578882993.0,When it's charging. Which on at least one of those hits it was. It just hardly ever gets called anymore.
hockey,fe5nup7,t1_fe5m9vy,1578871976.0,"There are beer leaguers better than him dude. I mean,  good beer leaguers but beer leaguers nonetheless. Amateurs."
hockey,fe5m0gz,t3_enrr35,1578871179.0,Does the charging penalty even fucking exist anymore?
hockey,fe5lwr0,t1_fe46max,1578871119.0,"NHL: What is charging for $200 Alex.

Answer, a video Daily Double, take a look.

NHL: What is neither of them?

I wonder if they'll ever call that penalty again."
