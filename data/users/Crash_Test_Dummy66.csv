AskReddit,ffu9yyk,t1_fftne1y,1580237579.0,The only situation where I've seen it makes sense to not take the job was with my parents. Once my sister and I were older my dad was looking to transition back to work. He got some job making like 40k per year but it bumped my parents into the next bracket because they were right on the edge already so he ended up going back to staying at home. Not because they were losing money but that extra 40k was taxed so high that what he actually made was not worth it given the job and he probably added more value to the family staying at home.

news,ffrik77,t1_ffr90rh,1580158712.0,I think with Trump though it was more he would rubber stamp anything the Republican Congress passed. Trump's policy goals that weren't Republican talking points (example: The Wall) didn't really go anywhere except by executive order. But the Republican Congress was all for getting a tax cut bill done because they already wanted that.
bestof,ffr0yk3,t1_ffr08mq,1580148054.0,[Only 55% of voters turned out in 2016](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout_in_the_United_States_presidential_elections#Turnout_statistics). Do you think the passionate people on the extremes really make up the bulk of those that don't turnout?
Overwatch,ffqerfs,t1_ffpw5u9,1580132416.0,Pretty sure this is an old clip during the 3 tank 3 support meta.
bestof,ffqab8c,t1_ffq3iqd,1580128025.0,"There actually are some swayable voters. Just look at the suburban districts that tend to vote more establishment Republican. They voted red in 2016 but that group largely does not like Trump and those same districts are where Democrats gained seats in the 2018 midterms. Those are important demographics to pick up in the general election and I really doubt they'd be more on board for Bernie than Trump.  

Additionally elections aren't always so much about convincing people to vote for your person. Instead it's about convincing the people who tend to agree with you to show up at all. It's why negative campaign ads are so effective. They suppress turnout for the candidate they are aimed at. Turnout was a big key to Obama's first win as he was very good at mobilizing the youth vote which tends to not turnout usually.

All of this is to say that I think Bernie's issue is that he might have a problem where many of the center left voters might just not turnout at all because they find both options unpalatable. I do not think the more moderate candidates have the same problem because at the end of the day the far left hates Trump so much that I think they'll largely vote for any Dem."
bestof,ffq9ly2,t1_ffq7x00,1580127221.0,I've never been a Sanders supporter but I think they issue they had was that the media reported pledged superdelegates as if they were guaranteed to go to the person they were pledged to (Hillary) during the elections. This led to Hillary having a seemingly bigger lead which could have affected voter turnout in states that vote later. I still think Bernie loses 10 times out of 10 in that primary but I will say there is still some merit to that argument.
todayilearned,ffg026g,t1_fffx19k,1579895542.0,You do bring up an interesting point. Like we so often thing of our technological advancements as separate from nature. Really they are kind of the same thing.

nfl,fddkstb,t1_fddf1p9,1578316103.0,Ya no clue what he's talking about. I'm pretty sure Pete will coach in Seattle until he retires and the fans I know would be fine with that.
