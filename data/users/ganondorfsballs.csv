PMDD,fgtsowz,t3_f0cimi,1581108838.0,"Are there black cohosh supplements available? From my foraging research I remember black cohosh being a medicinal herb that has historically been used to ease cramps and even induce abortions. However there are issues with its toxicity or negative side effects. Either way, I don't remember anything regarding it having positive effects on female hormone regulation."
PMDD,fgtr2gz,t3_f0dnsw,1581108218.0,"Track your cycle, your moods and your physical symptoms. Do this daily and for at least 2 cycles. The more data you have the better. This will help you determine the likelihood of having PMDD. At that point take your information to your doctor, gyno or a psych/therapist. 

Without the actual data showing a correlation between your mood and your cycle it's impossible to say whether or not you're dealing with PMDD, PMS or something different. Take time to educate yourself on the difference between PMS and PMDD."
dogs,fgtnzj7,t3_f0egxc,1581107106.0,"Over the last 9 years I've taken my dog to numerous vets and clinics in different provinces in Canada. I have gotten completely different levels of quality care at every place, and I can say for sure that some vets are only interested in your money, but some vets are far more interested in keeping your pet healthy and happy than their bottom line.

I'm really fortunate to have found a vet that fits into the latter category. First off, my vet loves my dog. All his staff does as well. My dog gets primo care and attention. My vet also routinely discounts me for necessary and emergency services (my dog has issues with recurrent cancer). My vet provides very honest opinions and options, and he will specifically warn me against pursuing certain diagnostics or procedures because they would waste my money for little to no pay off. This guy calls me the day after surgery to check on my dog. I've heard my vet remark to other technicians that my pup is a ""special client"" - I'm sure he says that about a lot of pets, but it's reassuring to hear your vet insist on quality care. Additionally, my vet can see I'm a very dedicated dog owner who takes very good care of my dog, I think he deeply appreciates that as he sees all kinds of pet owners (and let's be real, not all pet owners are good...).

Conversely, I've seen a number of vets in the past that were so awful that it gave me a very pessimistic view of vets in general. 

As with any field that requires a great deal of education and training, not all professionals in a given industry are good or bad. And there are some vets out there genuinely trying to be good to their clients, staff and clinic. As responsible pet owners, it's up to us to find the best level of care for pets."

PMDD,fgtkhvc,t3_f0emp2,1581105740.0,"Approximately 10 days before my period is supposed to start. I track my cycles and moods religiously. Once I'm done ovulating I get symptoms typically, so when I start feeling crummy I know I have about a week and a half until my period. I have noticed some cycles I won't get symptomatic until about 7 days before my period. I haven't been able to establish a correlation. But I do find that the nature of my period shifts every 3-6 months. Example changes can be cramps getting worse or better, heaviness of flow changing, color of flow changing, etc. Similarly I find my PMDD can shift over time as well. My last couple cycles my anxiety and depression have gotten bad, whereas my anger/irritability has been slightly better."
childfree,fgtamiu,t3_f0bqjc,1581101759.0,"There are levels to being CF. Some people think pet owners who refer to their pets as fur babies essentially don't qualify as CF. This is just gatekeeping and it's stupid to think there are qualifications to being CF. As long as you don't want kids and you don't have kids, you're CF. And even then you're able to change your mind *if you want to*.

My partner has kids. They live over 3500km away. He has no custody and he is not going to fight for it. The only interaction I have with kids is sending memes to each other on social media. Beyond that they are not my responsibility or concern and are not in my life. I'm still CF, but some people here would argue otherwise, which is silly as I'm not responsible for these kids in any way and my partner really isn't either.

I've also been sterilized, so I know for a fact that it's not for everyone and wouldnt force anyone to get sterilized. It's painful and invasive and carries it's own risks. Typical BC methods didnt work for me so I felt it necessary to opt for permanent sterilization. And it's something I personally wanted for myself.

Don't listen to haters or trolls or gatekeepers. They all suck."
TwoXChromosomes,fgsi5lb,t3_f08n17,1581084942.0,"The book ""Vagina: A New Biography"" by Noami Wolf might help you out. The author goes into great detail about female anatomy, orgasms, etc. It's actually a great read for anyone who has a vagina or has an interest in vaginas."

relationships,fgplj2f,t3_ezs03o,1581007216.0,"Mental health isn't your fault, but it is your responsibility.

Your boyfriend sounds very ill. What you have described is not typical symptoms of depression or anxiety. Your partner is either dealing with something more significant than just plain anxiety (you've described him as manic, so maybe he has bipolar), or he has a personality disorder, or he's taking drugs.

Regardless, your partner is not taking care of his mental health and you can't do that for him or force him to. On top of that you have your own mental health issues.

Quite frankly you guys are doomed to a dysfunctional relationship that makes you both unhappy, or you both need to get out and make some progress on getting your mental illnesses under control. That doesn't mean you can't date until you're ""normal"", but it means you both need to figure out to handle your illnesses without burdening a partner with them and turning them into a caregiver instead of a romantic partner. I say this as someone who deals with mental illness as well."
relationships,fgpk2gz,t3_eztvbm,1581006377.0,"When someone is defensive and deflective in situations like this, it's often because they are hiding something and know they are in the wrong about it.

I personally would not want to be with someone who treated me like this and made comments about fucking other girls in front of me. He's not willing to stop and you can't force him to change. Either accept that this is who he is, or accept you are not compatible and leave the relationship."
