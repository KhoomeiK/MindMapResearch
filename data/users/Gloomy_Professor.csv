depression,ff5jg1q,t3_erp2pz,1579595721.0,"trusty frank ocean. 

nights. makes me feel like shit but also a bit hopeful. seigfried. chanel. when it gets really bad, listen before i go by billie eilish is a good one. babylon by SZA. that song really gets me. 505 arctic . monkeys. and so on and so forth. 

i try to stay away from really depressing songs. death cab for cutie and ""breathe me"" are big no-nos for me, but sometimes, i can't stop myself and just listen to them over and over and over"

depression,fekyehm,t3_epm031,1579210177.0,"hey!! i (probably) participated in the same competition as you, and everything you said really resonates with me.

so happy that you're creating art for *you*. it's so, so, so liberating... the people who do these competitions solely for awards, i guarantee you, do not NEARLY enjoy nor experiment as much with their art as people who truly love what they do

congrats on finding something you love, and sticking with it ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è"
