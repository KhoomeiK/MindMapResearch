AskReddit,ffyrjnh,t3_evufsp,1580353383.0,"Bloody roar. Back in the day when we used to buy combo demos because gaming wasn’t a big thing and all of us were used to playing outside. I used to fight my brothers friend who was 5 years older, and as a 8 year old kid I would annihilate him every time and he’d get so angry he’d refuse to play me. I think the only full games we had were crash bandicoot and Spyro. But none of us cared, we had so much fun with what we had."

TrueCrime,ffymshk,t1_ffymb7h,1580350147.0,"They probably had more to go off of then you think. If they DNA tested everyone who simply had one somewhat similar feature, we’d be paying our entire salary on taxes for police. Just because he’s a trucker and maybe has a similar jaw to the supposed suspect doesn’t mean he’s worth spending time investigating instead of following other potentially more promising leads. I, and surely forensics, need much more than just a jawline from a random sex offender in comparison to a blurry picture of a suspect"
AMA,ffymhof,t1_ffykf5r,1580349943.0,Wait what did they use before? I brainstormed a few things before I posted this and strangely I didn’t even consider this
AMA,ffymeo9,t1_ffyjw1m,1580349886.0,"Yeah, but specific every day things most people don’t think about. Like where they’re going to eat, a simple 20 minute drive to a restaurant that would’ve taken hours otherwise and the restaurant itself wouldn’t have existed or even as safe as today. Things like that"
TrueCrime,ffyg65y,t1_ffye7qk,1580345640.0," I mean I could give you reasons, but that’s unnecessary. Because your only reasoning is that they have similar jaws, and that’s as circumstantial as it gets"

I do agree with you that the prison system needs to be reworked, we essentially punish people for wrongdoing and set them back further instead of teaching them and showing them how to succeed so that they can have a chance at leaving their old life behind. Countries in Northern Europe seem to be very successful with that, albeit smaller populations but I think it would work fine here too if it was integrated"

AskReddit,ffp6x93,t3_eua69p,1580087762.0,"I was a teenager circa 3 years ago and the hardest part for me was that no adults really gave a fuck about what you say or think. Your opinion is dulled because you’re young. Nowadays that’s not totally invalid, I think I’ve matured and grown a lot intellectually the past few years. But it’s still bullshit. Also, accepting and not questioning people in positions. I got moved from varsity to jv in basketball my senior year for calling out our first year coach for being a dick to all of my teammates but now I’m a bit more tolerant. I still find it hard to follow people’s orders instead of thinking independently, that I may never get over."
