YOU ARE AT A RISK OF DEATH. If you had a daughter, and she was getting strangled by her bf, but told you “nooo I looove him I’m not leaving” you would smack her and forcefully take her away. That’s probably what your mom would feel if she knew this ABUSER tried strangling you.

I’m telling you you have to go. I don’t give a fuck what he tells you. This is your LIFE.

He is not a good person. Everyone thought Jeffrey Dahmer was a charming man, and Ted Bundy was a charismatic guy. Guess what. They killed people, and the former cannibalized them. Doesn’t mean shit how “nice” they act.

This is an EMERGENCY and a violent situation. You need to act now. Leave. Call a women’s shelter, get that order of protection, call the cops.

DOCUMENT THE BRUISES. Take pics etc, call the police and report"

lonely,ff8awu5,t1_ff888qb,1579671312.0,"Well that’s great because now you really have the time to think about that. Who do you want to be? What are your goals? Write them down, break it down, step by step. Then do what you gotta do. Say you want to be more attractive. Well, workout, look up how to dress better, groom yourself, become more interesting by reading etc. there’s a world out there. It’s not gonna wait for you. You need to work for your future self. You don’t want to put in the work? Well feeling sorry for yourself won’t get you to where you want to be. Just facts bro"

offmychest,fesqv2w,t3_epxeri,1579368042.0,You’re so lucky :) treasure that time because not everyone has dads as nice as yours who wants to spend time with you
TrueOffMyChest,fem6soj,t3_epu7lm,1579241788.0,"You seem like a good person :) you feeling it’s unfair shows you’re considerate, but at the same time I doubt it was luck that got you there....you worked hard and/or are academically gifted and it’s nothing to be ashamed of. If I was you i would feel so lucky because financially you don’t have to spend your life worrying about loans...you can give back someday when you’re working...donate to scholarships for children who are underprivileged. Use this golden ticket to achieve your dreams now"
SuicideWatch,fem5i19,t1_fem4xlt,1579240465.0,"I see...if I were you I would at least continue with the therapist and learn non medication therapies and tricks to help with life. Once you have a good process, you’ll be ok...as for the job, your present self feels bad but one day your future self will thank you. Take care of yourself and your health right now.

As for mom and family. Sadly they misunderstand ADHD the most especially for women, you know? Women are expected to be organized at all times and when they are not...they get treated worse than a man with adhd. Even now for me, my whole family is pissed at me for not cleaning my room etc after two weeks. Shit just kept popping up and I’m busy at school but I’ll get to it...they don’t understand that life tasks take a LOT more energy for us than for them....So I no longer put stock in what they say (lazy, crazy, slob I heard it all)

So take some time to rest and relax. Then slowly make your next game plan and move. I recommend the adult adhd toolkit, it’s a book. 

For passion think about what makes you the happiest and what makes you feel like you’re truly enjoying the work, so it doesn’t feel like work"
JUSTNOFAMILY,fefvviu,t1_feestfy,1579066889.0,"Absolutely consider moving. Remember, financially free and far away will give you peace"
SuicideWatch,fefa2w9,t3_eouqos,1579051737.0,"Better to quit than be fired and I’m saying this as someone who got fired from 3 jobs bc of ADHD. That shit follows you to job after job.

Get help, no shame in that man. find a therapist who specializes in ADHD and get treatment from a psychiatrist. My life was a thousand times better and I felt like a normal person who could actually work.

Part of it is finding passion too. If this job is so miserable, well why not try something you’re passionate about? Makes a huge difference I promise."
offmychest,fef93o1,t3_eouddd,1579051084.0,"Just make it to 18, work really hard in school and get a scholarship to go far far away, and when they try to guilt you into caretaking. Just say their decision to have another child is on them, not you. Life will be better if you are financially and emotionally free. Thinking long term, you don’t want to be the person taking care of him when they can’t do it anymore, so make that clear early."
JUSTNOFAMILY,feejivv,t3_eolmzf,1579035026.0,"As someone in law school right now, you made the right choice. If this field is not where your heart is, it will chew you up and spit you out, not to mention cost you thousands.  Do not feel bad for realizing your true dream, because as you know, law school can be a toxic environment that generates perpetual anxiety.

This is your time, your life, and if they can’t support it, that’s not your problem. You have to do what’s best for you. Simply leave it at that, and they can’t dictate your life. Id suggest moving away, if you can, for EMT school. Overbearing family will try to run your life unless you put your foot down, being free (financially and distance wise) will help."
SuicideWatch,fcbfavl,t3_egq96h,1577586151.0,"Listen, I’m so sorry. I’m also South Asian and know how toxic things can get. Please please remember that you alone determine your future and your choices. If you believe in Allah(SWT), you know He sees your trials, and sees everything. How they treat you. How you stayed respectful in the face of that, and these trials are a test...you stayed respectful and that’s something I, in a first world country, couldn’t do. You have a strength I don’t have. 


Please stay, hold on, the world needs you. You will have the life of your dreams as long as you make it though life one day at a time. We are here for you. PM me."

Do everything you need to get past this, get therapy and take care of yourself...I would report them even tho family is involved. Because that was wrong and they need to be held accountable. What if they hurt others"

SuicideWatch,fbif0ak,t3_ediei9,1576899105.0,"Joe Biden was mocked by Sarah Sanders over Twitter for his stutter. Dude even was the Vice President and still got shit for it. It’s like he said though, he spent his life working to overcome the stutter and is mentoring kids who do the same. And it’s the haters  who are the problem, their lack of empathy. Not you. You should see that tweet and the speeches he’s given to AIS.


I’m not saying it’s easy.  I’m saying it’s really fucking hard but let it make you that much stronger, that much more determined to be what you set out to be. Did you know stutterers on average have a higher IQ? Some of the most talented singers, politicians, artists etc. stutter. 

Don’t let it define you, there’s so much More to who you are . Pm me if you want to talk. Someone who meant the world to me stuttered. I never once thought of him as less; no ones perfect man, people out there dealing with cancer, bipolar disorder etc. they just fake it so don’t fall for their BS"
