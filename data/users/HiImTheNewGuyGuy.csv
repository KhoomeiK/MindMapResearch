I agree with this.   But you are such a bigoted idiot that you cant understand that there is any nuance of opinion on the Left at all.  Hillary's unpopularity, foreign influence, and many other things all factored in.

But the polls showed that Hiullary was definitely going to win until JAMES COMEY, after Chaffetz leaked the info (and then quickly resigned), made Trump president with his october surprise.   Giuliani, deep in the NY FBI office that engineered the political investigation, even hinted it was about to happen the day before on Fox.

Didn't say they weren't.  Just that Trump has used both to attempt to illegally influence an election.
