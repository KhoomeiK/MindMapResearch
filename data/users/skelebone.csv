Or, you could have one that has screw-in lines, and that might only be a swap-out. I replaced the water heater in my old house because we could just swap it out with the screw-in lines. Whole change in about 30 minutes.  I helped a buddy on his, and we had to cut some pipes, but we connected the new one up with Shark Bites (not the best permanent solution, but they were functional and got the job done).
