bipolar,ffdwovc,t3_eswtfe,1579830795.0,I've done that..  I rolled and my head almost got smashed by the wheel. It was inches away.
bipolar,ffdw0nq,t3_eszzzf,1579830319.0,What are you going to school for?
bipolar,ffbjnd7,t3_esja65,1579768441.0,"A lot of my family, especially my 2 uncle's are fighting the same battle. Mental illness(one is a paranoid schizophrenic, it's absolutely terrible) and heroine/you name it, they have dealt with it all. I'm not in regular contact with them, one has stolen my belongings and pain medication and the other is currently locked up in a serious mental institution. 

I don't have a clue what it's like to even get drunk or smoke weed. But I don't judge. I know it only takes one decision to get addicted and I don't know what it's like after that. Your story here sounds rough and I hope you find a way to get in control, or first off, at least just be aware of how it takes a toll on other people. Just wanna say drugs have really ruined my family in everyway you can imagine. From the outside of addiction looking in, it's sad and it's devastating. Yet the only thing that would hurt more is if one of them took their own life. Because for some reason, I can forgive them and would love to see the day where we all get together and laugh and share stories and just enjoy each other's company. I've recently felt like giving up on everything, but I know it'll all be worth it in those moments where I'm with my friends; new or old. Stay safe man. Someone out there is thinking about you and hoping you are alright."
bipolar,ffbh4oc,t3_esoiyu,1579765049.0,Better than yours. Damn. It'll all pass! Just do the best you can and stay on dat medicine
bipolar,ff7eeoh,t3_erzjle,1579647633.0,I walked out of a job I loved for like no reason.
bipolar,ff1wl4n,t1_ff1ocu5,1579487826.0,I'm 22. I am not on medication at the moment.. just sending embarrassing text message rants ..
bipolar,fez1d0p,t3_eqs5la,1579453008.0,Straight to the point.
bipolar,feywisf,t3_eqye7t,1579451385.0,I told them I was bipolar when I asked them to block me
bipolar,fecjbf6,t3_eocdjh,1578975294.0,"I know you fucking hate yourself right now, but I appreciate you. Everything you are saying let's me know that at least I'm not alone in the way I feel. For a long time I thought everyone hated me and I wish I could just make them either love me or forget me. Sitting in the shower? How about yelling at the top of your lungs for someone to save you while curled up in the shower late at night... 

I've been where you have been. Not a physical place, but a real place nonetheless. At the end of the day we end up here because we care. We are so hard on ourselves because we care so much about how our life's intertwine with others. We don't want anything but perfection from ourselves. There are so many people fucking things up a lot worse, but they can sleep at night because they are selfish. They look out for themselves first. I would never pick that kind of life over this...

I want you to know that this world isn't built for people like you and me, but when the others look back at their life they will remember us. We have a chance to stand out in a very good way. Use your passion not to fail in looking for perfection in yourself, but to find the flaws in this world and do your best to fix them. We know what it's like to be broken. We can spot the others like us and make a difference. It only takes one moment/one sign that someone cares to save a life. That will give you a feeling that can't be beat. Don't be afraid to love. One day all the love you've given out will come right back to you. SO GET OUT THERE and start your journey in love. Thank you."
bipolar,fe6e3ta,t1_fe5yrcv,1578888206.0,"Get diagnosed! Just tell the doctor/psychiatrist what's up and they'll figure out what exactly is wrong. Maybe it's another disorder, maybe bipolar. It does NOT get better on its own."
bipolar,fe5yc9l,t3_enrm1a,1578877670.0,How are you getting into the Army? Bipolar isn't allowed. At least in the U.S.
bipolar,fe5y2e0,t3_ensx6u,1578877498.0,What the fuck? This is good...
bipolar,fe4pqtk,t3_ensq51,1578861665.0,I'm the exact same way. My leg constantly shakes while playing games or anything.

BPD,fdtj98b,t3_en2c83,1578717550.0,"You sound a lot like me at that age. I don't know what situation you're in, but I feel obligated to tell you that as soon as you meet someone who you get along with and maybe attracted to, start doing things to let them know you appreciate them BEFORE you do anything crazy. It's easier on their part to forgive once you build a good bond.

Or just don't do anything crazy. Idk I haven't figured life out yet."
BPD,fdtgxlf,t1_fc0c64z,1578716598.0,"To me ""home"" is a person or group of people."

bipolar,fdp1nng,t1_fdgmzfs,1578617870.0,That is like exactly what I told myself when I walked out of my job. Big mistake
bipolar,fdhlkaz,t1_fdfwk8f,1578425223.0,I wish I knew it was a book before watching. Guess I'll still read it. Pretty crazy how a book that was only 4 years old at the time became a screenplay that quick. Must be good!
bipolar,fdgts7j,t3_el5mzg,1578408130.0,I did this. Fucked my life up. Don't do it.
bipolar,fcwzynp,t3_ejcwh3,1578045015.0,That after is impressive... even if the before is way better than some people's lol

bipolar,fcwnx5h,t3_ej8yr7,1578031102.0,I don't get people who are like this. How hard is it to acknowledge others.
bipolar,fcjhz8y,t3_ehgday,1577688311.0,Exactly what I did... Everyone at work loved me. I walked out for a reason I can't even remember. What the fuck is wrong with us.
bipolar,fcjendb,t3_ehfk2p,1577684887.0,This is great!
bipolar,fcc10gm,t1_fcbmtin,1577593196.0,"Yeah, I'd hate to sound whiny. Wish it was so socially common for people to be open about serious shit. When I have something like this on my mind I am incapable of small talk... I feel you. In between waking up from nightmares and getting up 6 hours later, there is a coziness that breezes through me."
bipolar,fc6doa4,t3_egg3jt,1577478118.0,"People don't hate you. Trust me, I lived so long thinking  everyone hates me when I mess up. If you've never wanted to hurt anyone then you shouldn't be so hard on yourself!"

bipolar,fc67v8g,t3_egcj55,1577474290.0,"My brother bought me a nice stool to play guitar on. I spent all day and night recording a 3 part classical piece and posted it on Instagram. I didn't get many likes, but I don't use hashtags. I have 9 followers and only really care to impress people I know. The end."
bipolar,fc67flg,t1_fc624p6,1577474004.0,This is definitely going to atleast help me. Thanks.
