Simmons and Joan Cusack both have very distinctive voices, and neither resembles their character in the film at all.  At least Simmons voice matches the character well, so people who aren't familiar with the actor can enjoy it, but Joan Cusack does not sound like a mean old lady and didn't try to.

Hearing Rashida Jones voice took me out of it too, but at least her character resembled her somewhat."

Especially their babies have potential to really fool me, like wrap it in a cloth and put it in a pram and I'd probably have to look twice.
