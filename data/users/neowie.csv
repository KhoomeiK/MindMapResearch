askTO,ffbusve,t1_ffbsg68,1579783486.0,">But let's be honest - it will never happen. Politicians don't have the will power to challenge the wealthy.


Politicians don't have the willpower because it's the wealthy that contribute to their campaigns that allow politicians to spread their message and get them elected.


The wealthy also own the businesses that keep the electorate employed. Piss them off, and the wealthy say 'fuck this!' and move their business overseas or to other communities putting hundreds, if not thousands of people out of work. In addition, politicians lose major contributors to their campaigns, which means they can't afford lawn signs, promotional material, commercials, etc... And subsequently lose the next election and their jobs. 


It's not hard to see why they don't want to challenge the wealthy, and instead keep them close and offer them plush appointments."

I was charged ~$130cdn last year on a ~$150 cdn purchase from the US last year, it was delivered by DHL. When I requested a breakdown, they charged something ridiculous like $90 in shipping and handling charges and the rest was customs/hst. CBSA had valued the items based on their original price, not their discounted sale price, which is also ridiculous, since we don't pay hst based on original price in store, we pay hst based on the sale price. I made this argument to them, and they refused to re-evaluate the price and did not adjust it. When I had originally calculed the customs and hst on the sale price using CBSA's own calculator on their website, it was supposed to be around $20.


I also complained to DHL since I had already paid for shipping with the original purchase, so I shouldn't have to pay a second time, or the company should reimburse the $20 I paid in shipping since I had to pay DHL directly for the shipping as well - they were double dipping. They also wanted me to go to a pick up location in Concord to pay and pick up the package. I don't have a car, and Google maps said there were no transit options to go to the warehouse depot, so I would have to take a cab or an Uber, which would probably have cost me another $50 each way. Fuck that. I live in Toronto, they couldn't ship the package to a depot in Toronto? There's one less than 1km away from me.  I ordered online for the convenience - this was not convenient. Didn't get anywhere with them, either. I made a complaint to the store and advised them that their shipper was double charging shipping rates and that the shipper had lost them a customer. So I refused to accept the package and it got sent back to the store, and I got a full refund. 

Now I check who the shipper is with any online store before making a purchase - if they ship with DHL or UPS (I've had shipping & handling overcharges issues with them, too), I do not order from them. There are plenty of retailers out there, I do not have to give the ones that intend to screw me over any business. 


Short list of US retailers that use DHL or UPS: Modcloth, Anthropologie, Tarte, Bite Beauty, Think Geek, Fresh Collective (cdn store but DHL still charges high handling fees)... Feel free to add to this list."

MakeupRehab,ff8v6ay,t1_ff8u6c3,1579697183.0,"Ok, but how are you going to use an eyeshadow that has dried out and is unusable?


If you absolutely must buy something and every part of your soul wants you to have that one shade that is similar (maybe not exact) to ones you already have, then look for makeup that is at least still in production rather than one that has already expired? (production date for that collection was Jan 2017 + 3 years expiry for CP SS shadows = eyeshadow expires in Jan 2020) Lots of brands carry singles, and again, that is a very common shade. 


I don't know about you, but I care about my eyes and don't want to risk putting expired makeup with unstable (due to expiry) chemicals near my eyes, putting myself at risk for eye infections like pink eye. Even CP doesn't recommend using their products after the expiry date has passed. 


But if you don't mind buying dried out, expired products and potentially suffering from eye infections, if you can even get any pigment out of the shadow, then no one is going to stop you. But you did post on a sub that actively encourages people to *not* buy makeup. If you're looking for validation to buy more makeup, you won't find it here."
MakeupRehab,ff8t1jo,t3_esaeqj,1579695000.0,"I've bought CP SS eyeshadows before, and I find they, esp. the matte shades, start to dry out within a few months after purchase due to the amount of oils/whatever chemical that makes them super soft (maybe that's why they discontinue and launch new products so often?). I wouldn't purchase that discontinued SS eyeshadow just because it has probably already dried out and will be unusable once you receive it. It was originally released in Jan 2017, and went out of production shortly afterwards, afterall!  In comparison, all of the CP SS eyeshadows I bought in Jan 2018 were completely dried out by Dec 2018, the mattes by August 2018, and the shimmers by Dec 2018. I couldn't revive them with anything. Literally, I would unscrew the lid and the eyeshadow would fall out of the pan. Most crumbled away into dust, they have no pigment when they dry up, either. I've had to toss all of them. I bought 2 CP SS from the yellow collection in Early July 2019, and I just had to toss one that has already dried out. There's no way a CP SS from 2017 is still good. I don't know how the legacy actress got a hold of that shade, she may have asked them to produce it as a one-off (they have their own labs and production facilities, and can do that - for a price) edit: the photo is captioned #tb, aka throwback. She posted an old photo of her makeup, I can pretty much guarantee that even she no longer has that CP SS shade. 


I had a look at it, and it seems to be a pretty common peachy with a hint of pink shade. You probably already have it in your collection, just saying. In fact, your divine skies palette has at least one shade that looks extremely similar (sunset), and on the eyelids will probably be almost an exact dupe for B(u)y My Side. As you're going to be moving away to school soon, the last thing you need to do is juggle a bunch of extra makeup with you and figure out how to store it in your tiny dorm room - esp makeup that is all essentially the same shade of peach. 


I know the temptation to buy something new is strong and exciting. But in this case, buying something that is virtually the exact same shade that you already have in your collection doesn't make sense."

The above examples are my own, though. (During the recent fall maintenance, as an example,  security knocked on the door, I answered, welcomed the tradesperson in, put the doorstop in the door so that they can come and go without damaging the door or frame (they had supplies like a large vacuum and air filters), and told the accompanying security guard that I'm there, no need for them to stay, they can grab a coffee or have a break. And was told, no, they need to step inside for a moment to check on a few things for fire code and condo bylaws. Of course they can check, and I poured them both a coffee (I had made some for myself a little earlier), and they got their work done very quickly. When the security guard walked in, they looked around quickly (like just stepped inside, turned their head around, and put a check mark on their sheet, it was hardly an invasive check, and they didn't even enter the bedrooms) and then drank the coffee, and we chatted about the weather, or something similarly innocuous).

I looked at the amount of products that I actually intend to keep from a years worth of beauty boxes (ipsy, boxycharm, glossybox, look fantastic, top box), and it totals about 6 items - an eyeshadow pencil that I had bought previously, so it was something that I have wanted and was older, so I just replaced it with the newer one, a highly rated high end sunscreen that isn't sold in Canada, a rose gold fruit-based lip gloss, a hair treatment that I liked so much I have since bought in full size, a lip crayon that is super flattering, and a Konjac sponge that I use when washing my face (which will be discarded at the end of this month anyways).

Until the province and federal government invest in curtailing illegal guns imported into Canada at the border and from reservations, criminals will always be able to get their hands on guns.

In these cases (this one, and the previous post), the city may be responding to a complaint about the building as a whole (rather than individual units) and pushing the building management, and building management is pushing the residents. Trust me, the property manager has better things to do than count number of heads and beds in units. But if the building has been found non compliant, they get not only a hefty fine, but they could also find residents (owners and tenants) removed from the building and displaced, if Toronto bylaw deems the building is overcrowded. So in these cases, it's best to tell a little white lie: Respond and say you've complied, then when they come in to do regular maintenance, just move the bed into the bedroom. They always give you 24 hours notice, so the residents have time to move the bed.

If you move your bed to the bedroom when you know they're going to stop in to do regular maintenance, you would be compliant. Put felt pads or wheels on your bed to make it easy to move. The City of Toronto property standards bylaws outlines that there is a minimum for size required for each person living in the home: 4 sq metres for each of two people, or ~~7~~ 6 sq meters (thanks to the other poster for posting the correct meterage) for a single person for sleeping space. The condo building is covering their ass by advising you that you aren't compliant. The worst that they can do is levy fines on the owner, but if you have a landlord, the landlord might use that as an excuse to evict you. The building staff can only enter your unit with notice, such as when they are doing regular maintenance, or in the case of an emergency - no notice - but then they aren't looking at location of beds, they're trying to put out a fire, save a life, or stop a flood, etc...). They also can pursue legal action *but only if* you or your brother are also being abusive towards staff, or engaged in illegal activities (drug dealing, etc) they can go to a judge to have one or both of you banned from coming within x meters of the building (effectively a restraining order), essentially evicting you from the building. But this is extremely rare. 


Just write back to property management, tell them the bed has been moved to the bedroom, and anytime they say they are going to do maintenance, move the bed to the bedroom. You do not need to move the rest of your things, just the bed.

Regarding grief. It's okay to cry. It's also okay not to cry. It's also okay to randomly start ugly-sobbing into your plate of perogies at a restaurant while the waitress looks on helplessly, when your husband is just trying to do a nice thing by taking you out for dinner (this might be a personal anecdote). Talk to your friends, talk to strangers willing to listen. Talk to your family. Talk to yourself. Start a journal and share your thoughts. Don't bottle up your feelings inside, where they can fester and become destructive thoughts, sharing your feelings and your memories of your nana is good. Reddit, I find, can be a little like Tom Riddle's diary (Harry Potter reference), when you write your personal thoughts down, it can be therapeutic, and you can get some advice. 


My friend, who works in the psychiatric industry, shared this article with me after my mum died, https://psychcentral.com/blog/coping-with-grief-the-ball-the-box/ . While my mum's death was not the first one I have experienced, it was certainly the one that hit me hardest. Knowing that the pain never truly goes away, it just gets triggered less and less often as time goes on was a good thing to know, and understand why the grief and pain never seems to go away. But in the months after my mum died, I cried and felt sick to my stomach a lot. Enough that I developed dermatitis on my eye lids and had to get medicated cream because they were cracked and bleeding from all the crying.


It's good to distract yourself, tho. Find something that makes you happy, even for just a half hour or hour. My father took up karate after my mum died, and he's reconnected with old, once forgotten friends, and is in better shape, physically, then he has been in years.

All that being said, if you want to meet for coffee one day this week, I will listen. I can even bring my [dog](https://www.instagram.com/p/B3lSsUygdUd/?igshid=1sr2lp27agc0w) if its not too cold. He loves people and gives the awesomest hugs (aka bodychecks).


I'm very sorry for your loss. <virtual hug>"

And hold onto your points until something on your wish list pops up or something you currently have runs out. Just because you hit a tier or you are offered a gift with purchase, didn't mean you need to purchase something. Of course the store would like you to buy something, but you don't need to do what the store wants, you are your own person, and you are not a puppet controlled by the store."
