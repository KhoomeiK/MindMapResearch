Which is fine and makes sense. But we had this one chief that took it to mean that we had to read each line of each step and then the people responsible for doing the actions would one by one go over what they were going to do for each step. Which is tedious and probably a bit overkill, but on par with the navy way... until this other chief showed up and he was unhappy about how long the briefings were taking because it wasn't uncommon for someone to lose their place and reread or skip a step (which someone always caught) making us spend a few moments figuring out were we left off. His solution, we were to hold a pre-briefing in which we would go over who reads which step and then who says what they'll do for that step. At one point we had what was (in the procedure book) a 1 hour task, we got there at 7:30am to start the briefings. After we returned from lunch and had a short post lunch safety briefing we could finally start. We finished the task right before supper ended."
