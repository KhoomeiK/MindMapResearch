I'll tell you a secret. The goal of the great game is not power. The goal is the same as it was when rome was a super power, when spain discovered untold riches, when the british ruled the world and when america eventually bailed her out. Currency, the only imaginary thing that controls all we do in business and so in life. We get the word dollar from the history of the great Spanish empire. Not to mention our name america. 

The goal of the great game at this point in history is to dethrone the united states dollar as the defacto world currency. That is the reason for all of this shit. And in the meantime corporate houses around the world have realized they can stop playing the imaginary shell game and invent their own digital currency.
