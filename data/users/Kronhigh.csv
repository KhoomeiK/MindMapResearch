So say for instance audiophiles know that having lower volume cuts bits of data out of the the audio file, hence they would never change the mode to quiet then.

pics,fd5bmdr,t1_fd4xma7,1578175993.0,"Think about the amount of impact the Joker had in his society during the movie.  It was a revolution, to the point where he had the masses rioting and rooting for him.  Those are the real life henchmen that come to be during realistic scenarios as such.  To have ""innocent"" civilians turn to faithful followers, prepared to engage in crime, is in my opinion the true horror that batman could face, and a realistic possibility.  This is what gives the movie a surreal idea of what really could happen, and it's scary.  

I think this is the most realistic and dangerous pivot point that turns a monster, into a truly dangerous and powerful villain.

Do not forget, The Joker has always been a villainous political figure in comics and movies, and this rendition of ""The Joker"" shows how possible it can be.

If they made a sequel (which apparently will never happen) and it was as good as the first, it would be the best series I think.  

P.S  Why put so much foreshadowing in that movie with young Bruce Wayne? You cannot do that then tell everyone their will be no sequel, that is just wrong :(:("

If you don't care about a Dac..or amp.. or better sound.. then you should not care enough to spend so much money on headphones :S

Even when you upgrade your dac and amp in the future you won't even be selling an Atom amp or Grace Dac, you will love them so much you will keep them forever.  Less than $200 investment and every headphone, speaker, IEM you buy from then on will sound amazing.

Try listening straight from the computer audio jack at 70%.  Treble and mids will be harsh and pierce your ears.  Play the same volume with the dac and amp, you will melt in your seat.

I believe that from the computer it gives it a slight bit more soundstage, and overall softer mids and treble.  I wouldn't necessarily say smoother.. but could be a possibility as well.

headphones,fcjzmt0,t3_calxdg,1577711822.0,"A/B testing with with multiple headphones, using Dragonfly Cobalt and Tidal Hifi and MQA, here is my opinion.

Using the Tidal app with MQA music from my phone is pretty decent.  You get 24-bit 92Khz from Master tracks.  Using USB Audio Player with MQA music is truly better when it comes to soundstage, clarity, and depth.

However! I swear to you..  the sound floor gets lower with proper MQA decoding from USB Audio Player, and depending on the headphones can produce a flatter less impactful bass sound.  I really do think the bass overall is better without MQA.. as much as I would not choose to believe it.  Is MQA worth it? I really think so.  You are paying all of this money on Dacs, amps, headphones, streaming services and CD's... all of this time doing research and forums and blog posts.. it's only $10 more for MQA on Tidal. So do it.  Please try listening to MQA files properly before knocking it as I find most people pretty ignorant when it comes to it.

Keep in mind, if you are NOT playing MQA tracks, do not use USB Audio Player on your phone or directly from your Computer.. it makes them run in 44Khz files.. but for some reason playing Spotify Premium or Tidal from your Phone will play non MQA tracks in 48Khz..  confusing and weird I know but that's just how it is for now till they fix that."
