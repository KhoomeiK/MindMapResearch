battlefront,fgmrrx4,t3_ezdccu,1580930730.0,"Yes. I always get out into matches almost immediately. I picked it up when it was on sale around Christmas and I’m very happy with the purchase (especially with the price drop). I was looking for a shooter to play online and I got exactly what I wanted. I originally stayed away because I heard not great things about the game. But with all the changes and updates that have been coming out the game has really fixed a lot if it’s issues, imo."

IASIP,fendu4i,t1_femhqd7,1579282556.0,I worked a job that I had to get up at 5 every day for a few months. Now I work a job I don’t have to wake up until 7:30 if I prep everything the night before. I still wake up at 5:30 every morning and just lie in bed tossing and turning.

KOTORmemes,fekymzg,t3_epkc19,1579210320.0,My favorite is after you gain access to the lower city and start running between upper and lower for quests. I always forget to put my Sith armor back on for the elevator so I wind up just changing in front of the guard because I’m not shy.
HolyGrailMemes,fekxvji,t3_epnygt,1579209864.0,"Or, in the case of my girlfriend. You only get as far as the “air speed velocity of an unladen swallow” and then have to turn it off because “this movie is too dumb”."
SelfAwarewolves,fekt6a2,t1_feklzoy,1579207081.0,That’s only because they’re smart enough to reject the liberal brainwashing machine! /s
SelfAwarewolves,feksqtc,t1_fekscpx,1579206827.0,"Excellent way to phrase it! Looking back at my comment I can’t help but regretting saying that I would accept an argument against. Because if it’s their job to put a bottom level in place for everyone, it’s their job to maintain it and ensure everyone gets the most benefits they possibly can. So yeah, don’t accept those bullshit arguments.

SelfAwarewolves,fekm74e,t1_fekjqik,1579202950.0,"And yet, the main point of his arguments are always it’s not the government’s job to take care of us. Which I don’t entirely disagree with, if there was some bottom level in place to make sure that everyone starts in the same place and had a real chance to have their best life, at that point I would accept an argument that maybe it’s your responsibility to improve yourself. But with costs of college and health insurance rising it’s really difficult to change your situation just through “pulling yourself up by your bootstraps” (which I told him was actually a phrase for something that is impossible to do). The right always wants to say what other people need to do to help themselves but I would never want to be the one telling the poorest members of society that they’re not trying hard enough. God, I hate libertarians..."
SelfAwarewolves,fekiz4y,t1_fek4xen,1579201030.0,"I had a Facebook friend that I went to high school with post something about how marijuana legalization is only happening because dem run states are out of money and are desperate to stay in power. It’s amazing the mental gymnastics people do to tell them their way is the right way. I couldn’t let it go, hit him with “you’re right. It has nothing to do with a growing majority of people wanting it to be legalized, or the fact that more and more people are aware the marijuana prohibition is based on racism towards Mexicans. It’s also incredibly ignorant of the history of the war on drugs to make such a claim.”"

His eyesight isn’t very good and I don’t think he can see well in the dark as a result. He also isn’t very good at regulating his body temperature and so, we have to get him shaved every summer. Also, like you said he can’t clean himself very well. So his sister does it for him. But other than that he’s the sweetest little boy who doesn’t want to do anything besides sleep and cuddle. He impresses us with some long/high jumps sometimes so we know he’s just fine.
