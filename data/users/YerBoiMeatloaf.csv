trippinthroughtime,fffqwvh,t3_eta0fh,1579889857.0,"The reasons why the US continues to fight war in the Middle East is because of the repeated humanitarian crises there and because their entangled alliances in Asia, Europe and Israel. It's important to clarify that North and South America do not need energy from the Middle East. They still have some of the largest energy reserves in the world. The main beneficiaries of Middle Eastern energy are Europe and South East Asia. Europe benefits from lower oil prices and not being dependent on energy from Russia. South East Asia is the largest metropolitan area in the world and literally could not exist without outside energy supply. Yes of course military contractors make obscene amounts of money from these conflicts but they aren't the cause, only the symptom. I'm not saying the US is totally innocent either, but as the largest military/economic power in the world they have a responsibility to maintain international stability. The US could pack up and go home tomorrow and they wouldn't hurt one bit but I guarantee the international community would suffer Making the retarded argument of ""dur the uS just wants oil dur"" is a gross misunderstanding of the greater geopolitical situation."
wholesomememes,ffctgdq,t3_esu12h,1579806911.0,I had never heard the word chalant used in English before so I googled it and was disappointed to discover that the word does not technically exist in English. Nonchalant is adapted from the French non+chaloir which basically means 'to be unconcerned'. Many other English words also have the appearance of being paired due to having a prefix such as re(buke) or dis(dain).

Before the 100 year mark I encountered the Worm, which I had never seen before, so i was really curious to finish it. Kept with it even though it kept eating my scientists and eventually my species got modified to be militaristic, and at the very end my home system turned into a black hole and all rocky planets became tomb worlds, leading to the above image with 12 colonized planets. All species in home system also gained tomb world habitability which was very cool flavour wise. Reformed my government to have parliamentary system and citizen service and now my federation is fighting a galactic scale war against the next biggest federation. 10/10 most interesting event chain I've encountered so far."
