I hope she's wrong but I feel she's correct. She knows him from being a Senator. She was well respected in the Senate for her ability to put together coalitions and get it done. She knows Bernie doesn't have that skill."

This information is from the *drug prohibition* link at the end of the article.

I know someone whose daughter was a 32 year old social worker when she got badly hurt in a car crash. When she was discharged from the hospital her prescribed pain medication left her in so much pain that she resorted to illegal drugs -- and became a total drug addict and lost custody of her 7 year old son. It's likely that her doctor was afraid to prescribe stronger pain meds because that gets MDs in trouble with the feds fighting the drug war. There is a sad irony there."
