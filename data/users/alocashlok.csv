offmychest,ffe0dda,t3_et3j4x,1579833441.0,"I'm so so sorry you went through this, and it's disgusting that he's getting away with it. I hope you have people that aren't your family that you can talk about this with, who will support you entirely through your healing process and when you're able to say something.   
I think r/legaladvice might be able to help if you want to take it to court, if you explain the evidence you have and your situation  
The hurt you're feeling is completely valid, and you need to know that you wouldn't be ""destroying his life"" by saying something, you'd be standing up for your own. Any repercussions he faces are for his own actions. The only thing you should be responsible for is looking out for your own mental health.   
Seriously, stay strong. You're going to get better"
