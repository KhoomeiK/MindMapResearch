KitchenConfidential,fgjrrwt,t1_fgjpyl3,1580850119.0,"So, you are telling me I must get higher to understand this logic?

At this point, I don't think this person has ever worked in a kitchen or has any understanding of the customer is always right. 

Grab you chairs folks, it's time for Stoned History.   

The saying that the ""customer is always right "" only applies to the product of their choice. 

Using OP and his kabob issue, we can assume he is living in an area that appreciates a great kabob.  Every restaurant with a 12 minute walk only serves kabobs.   This can mean several things OP lives in an ethic neighborhood,  OP lives in a residential area with limited choices, or the entire universe is out to fuck with him. 

OP 's restaurant needs are not getting met and he is going to eat somewhere else.  He chose to spend his money in a non kabob restaurant.  

If more local residents in his 12 mile walking area decide they no longer like kabobs, then they will stop spending money at a kabob restaurant.   Once sales start dropping,  the kabob restaurant owners will need to apply the ""customer is always right "" rule.  The customer chose the product.  Maybe it's time to change the menu.  The restaurant owner will do market research and start to modify his offerings.   Perhaps he becomes a sushi place or maybe BBQ.  

The customer's wallet is always right, seldom the customer."

Look up imposter syndrome.   

What helped me was focusing on my mental health.   Learning good behaviors with positive self talk and meditation have dramatically improved my depressive outlook.   

Here what I do when I feel like a giant POS, I write down what I'm good at, what I suck at, and what I need to let go.  I check in with myself every day and get aligned with these lists.  I spend 90% of my mental load focusing on what I suck at instead of letting it go.  

For example,  I lost it on a Karen exactly 5 days and 6 hours ago.  I should have taken my pain meds instead of pushing.  I wasn't my best self and I didn't handle her attitude.   I actually said if she wanted snarky,  then I can be incredibly snarky.  I blasted her with my chef aka big sister tone.  I put her in her place to the point she actually apologize to my staff.  I have lost sleep  and cried almost every day for this short coming.  I hate when I act like my father.  But, I know these thoughts are wrong and I redirect to the 999 positive folks I met last week.  

I hope you take the time to work on your mental health now.  Don't wait until you're my age.  I wish someone who have forced me to therapy and mental health care when I was your age.

This happened last year:

I'm a restaurant owwner.  My cafe is just sandwiches and stuff like this.  My sales guy set up a meeting for me to cater a wedding.  It was going to be sandwiches and stuff for a very low key wedding.  He tells me the bride had been having issues getting help because it was too small for most caters.   That sounded odd but whatever.

I wake up sick, like can barely talk sick.  I call up the bride to reschedule or to do the meeting by phone.  Seriously,  we were just meeting to give me enough data to get a quote together.   It wasn't a tasting or anything because I do not offer tasting.   Most of my orders are taken over the phone because SANDWICHES.   

Immediately,  the bride tells me that we have to meet today because EVERYONE is meeting at the cafe at 10.  

Me:  Everyone?   
Bride:  Yeah, I have my fiance,  his mom, my mom, and everyone in the bridal party.
Me: How many people are coming to our meeting? 
B:  Ten
M: Ten?
B:  Yeah, we figured we would all order different things and then we could make better decisions for the food.
M:  So, you are bring ten people for breakfast?   
B:  Yes.
M:  Okay, I'll let me staff know and we can reschedule our meeting.
B:  Why do we need to reschedule? 
M:  We scheduled a meeting to go over what you wanted to order.  You told me you knew exactly what you wanted.  You told me that you just needed help verifying your order.  You told me it would be three people and it would take about 15 minutes. 
B:  Yeah, but we decided that we needed a tasting instead. 
M:  Did you call to change to a tasting?
B:  No, we figured it would be okay.
M:  Let me get this straight.   You want to bring ten people and their orders are the tasting? 
B:  That's how tastings work.
M:  It sounds like we got our signals crossed, I thought it was just a meeting to firm up a quote for your sandwiches. 
B:  It was but, I thought since it's for a wedding,  you would let us do a tasting. 
M:  Unfortunately,  I do not do tastings.  I think you need a better cater.  I do not think I will be able to meet your expectations. 
B:  But, you said we were meeting today and ....
M:  Did you change our meeting objective?   
B:  Yes, but
M:  As a cater, I've learned that I can not meet expectations that are never communicated.   I know that I will not be able to meet your expectations.   
B:  But, we all love your food and we were excited for our free tasting. 
M:  Exactly.
B:  Since you're sick, we can reschedule.   We'll just tell the staff that we are here for the tasting and we can talk next week.
M:  Actually,  we can't.   I'm not taking your event because I can't meet your expectations.   Would you like me to reserve a table for your party of ten.
B:  Insert a ton of language and mad rants.
M:  Again,  I'm confident I will not be able to work with you.  

The conversation was just me repeating no for the next several minutes.  I finally just hung up.  I let my restaurant friends know to be on the look out.

The law requires her to ask the enable bodies customer to move from the disabled tabled.
