AskReddit,fephdfi,t1_fepek4z,1579320533.0,"You are still beneficiary in a society that overwhelmingly favors white people.  They simply want you to recognize and acknowledge that. 

Example 1: If a cop pulls you over while driving, you know that a) you probably did something illegal, and b) you might be in danger of getting a ticket.  

If a person of color is pulled over by by a cop, a) they are legitimately fearful for their lives, and b) they might not have done something wrong.  When have you EVER feared for your life from the people who are sworn to protect you?  Why aren‚Äôt they protecting the people of color equally?

Example 2: Compare the percentage of whites vs. people of color (POC) who have higher degrees of education.  Sure, you say, you worked hard to earn that degree... but you also had incomparable advantages when it came to parenting, economics, and the experience of previous generations of your family having that education.  

Back to Example 1:  Compare the percentage of whites vs. POC when it comes to incarceration rates.  Do you really believe that all the darker-skinner people are so much worse-behaves  than white-skinned, or is there racial bias at play when it comes to policing and judicial issues?

Example 3: What is the average wage gap between equal whites and POC?  Hint:  it‚Äôs a number much higher than zero.  Why are you as a white person earning more money in the same job, with the same experience, than a POC?  Why are you more likely to ‚Äúearn‚Äù that job than an equally qualified POC?

If you are interested at all in the topic, a great place to start is with the book ‚ÄúSo you want to talk about race‚Äù by Ijeoma Oluo. I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúwant to talk about race‚Äù but I did want to study the issue, and it definitely helped give me a much wider perspective and appreciation for all the things that POC go through and how many advantages I have that I‚Äôve  never been aware of."

AskReddit,fdk4353,t3_elscke,1578495565.0,"Welcommen to LockLandia, version 2.2

We dominate world marketplaces with our intelligent-design silverware which is always measuring food temps.  Too hot or too cold is an archaic adventure of the past.  Our ovens are world-renowned for their accuracy.  

Our citizens have no back pain and no stiffness in the morning as all our beds are the perfect firmness, government guaranteed.  Of course everyone is different so that means we produce an enormous variety of mattresses, and our manufacturers and engineers are always pioneering new technologies to enhance human sleep.  

Approximately one-half of Locklandia citizenship is involved in the production, recycling, and/or export of our amazing mattresses.  Government pays for and replaces every mattress as needed.  We have the world‚Äôs largest mattress recycling facilities, and without a doubt our industry of mattress recycling has completely revolutionized childrens playgrounds as well as the military-industrial complex.

Our military has some of the finest beanbag tossers and pillow-fighters the world has ever known.  While not every conflict can be solved by our convoluted and arcane version of Cornhole, most intellectual disputes are easily resolved using this centuries-old game.  Physical altercations must be resolved in the Mattress Graveyard (TM) battlefield using our superior FluffyTech (TM) pillows.  Although many foreign military forces have attempted to invade LockLandia, when we provide them a comfortable bed for the night with proper-temperature food, they inevitably choose to immigrate  or seek asylum here.

Another large percentage of our population is involved in engineering and technology for chairs.  While it is true we have the ‚ÄúPerfect Chair for Every Body‚Äù, the majority of our chairs are shipped overseas to help support developing countries.  LockLandians, for the most part, do not need to spend a lot of time sitting, as we prefer to stay active with our national pastimes of Cornhole, hiking, mattress-climbing, and photography.

(In case you are wondering about LockLandia version 1.1, let‚Äôs just say that our experience is that mattresses, food, and chairs are not ‚Äúone size fits all‚Äù and the attempt to create a country based on that falsehood resulted in unnecessary death, destruction, pestilence, war, and bruises.)

Peace, love and kisses from all of us at LockLandia!"

Every family does it differently, but typically they all gather on Christmas morning to open gifts, near the Christmas tree.

There‚Äôs all kinds of variations such as having a big family meal, when and how many presents you open, participating in a Christian Christmas church service, etc.  It‚Äôs all about spending time with your family, being thankful for what you have, and enjoying giving to others.
