He’ll have everything he needs to get started plus some extras he can trade with his buddies"
TooAfraidToAsk,ff5atjh,t3_erpxik,1579585546.0,"Dunno about selling it but you can donate it to companies that make wigs for cancer patients. 

Other fun and creative idea: 
Leave it in a tree for birds to make a nest with. It doesn’t even have to be in particularly good condition for this, can even just be the wad of old hair from a hair brush."

Not quite the same but one of my sims also teleported to be just outside the 2nd floor balcony. Floating in the air. I guess the game recognized there was nothing to walk on cause he couldn’t move either xD"

callcentres,fesucpz,t3_eq8ys0,1579369078.0,"My company has changed its policy a few times since I started there. 

When I first started, we had to give 3 warnings before we could disconnect, like we were dealing with toddlers. After the third warning we could hang up if the behavior continued.

Then they removed our ability to disconnect at all. The reasoning was “they’re only gonna call back anyway and inflate the volume and yell at someone else”. We were told “if they are swearing, just ignore them.” I took this literally and any time someone swore I would pretend I couldn’t hear them and ask them to say it again until they said it without the swear. They would either figure it out or hang up on themselves. Very entertaining. 

The current policy we have is one warning, if they continue, hang up, which is my favorite of the 3."
