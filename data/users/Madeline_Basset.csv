I disagree. I think if you look at steam, ironclad warships from about the 1860's to to about the 1910's, a 20-30 year service life seems pretty usual. Warship design was advancing rapidly during that period and ships became obsolete quickly, even if they didn't wear out.

If you have some lift, the duration of the re-entry phase is extended and deceleration is spread out over a longer time, so the peak G-forces are vastly reduced, as is the peak heat-loading on the heat shield. For example, the Mercury capsules had no lift and flew a purely ballistic re-entry, which peaked at about 9G. Whereas it was about 3G for the Space Shuttle. 

This is doubly important if you're coming back from the Moon as the vehicle is going far faster and a lot more deceleration has to happen. The Apollo capsules actually flew a lifting re-entry as they were a sort of lifting body, with a L/D of about 0.5 - this was done by having the C/G of the capsule offset from the geometrical centre."

Fred values freedom over everything else; he simply wants to do what he wants, when he wants. To him rules are an annoyance, not a cornerstone of society.
