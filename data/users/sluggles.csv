That's pretty sad to hear tbh."
politics,ff6x0ju,t1_ff6r9ze,1579636628.0,"It's just a legal opinion that says that a sitting President can't be indicted, an opinion that was written in 1973 by the office of legal counsel during the Watergate investigation of Nixon, ya know, the one that had a vested interest in that being the case. [Source.](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olc/opinions/2000/10/31/op-olc-v024-p0222_0.pdf) The Supreme Court has never ruled on whether this is the case. The Constitution sets up the impeachment process as a way for Congress to remove the President from power, but it doesn't explicitly state that this is the only way, nor does it say the President is immune from indictments."

math,fdnoewh,t1_fdmzmih,1578589921.0,"> Complete normally means ""every subset with an upper bound has a supremum"" when giving a definition of the real numbers. 

I've always heard completeness defined as ""every cauchy sequence converges."" The supremum property implies completeness if you assume an ordered field, and to define Cauchy sequences, you need a metric. Additionally, the reals aren't the only complete ordered field, but rather the only complete ordered field with the Archimedean property. The supremum property also implies this property which is unrelated to Cauchy completeness, so the sup property is strictly speaking, a stronger property. Sorry for being technical,  just don't want students taking real analysis to get confused since the supremum property only really comes up for the reals there, but R^n and C are both complete."

atheism,fcy79ns,t1_fcxwabg,1578075839.0,"> It is ""really relevant"". The only value Josephus has as a credible historian is if he is able to discern fact from fiction.

I fail to see how what he thought about alleged events over a millennium before hand affect his ability to record events that happened around 60 years prior. That's like saying a modern historian's writings on Vietnam or the Civil Rights movement couldn't be trusted because future historians conclude that Leif Erickson is mythical. One failed belief doesn't invalidate ALL of his work."

This isn't really relevant. Josephus probably thought Moses existed because most people in the area thought he existed. Him accepting some event from hundreds of years ago doesn't invalidate his writing of what was recent."

If someone has 100 magic protections, you'd apply percent reduction first to reduce them by 10 to a total of 90, then you'd apply your 50 percent pen (for one ability on an internal CD) to the 90. So that would be another 45 protections countered by your percent pen, bringing their effective protections to 55. So, the 60% pen you quoted is really effectively only 45%...

If you mean an unofficial audit where you simply attend the class, do the work, and never have it graded, then most professors will allow that as long as they have room. If you mean an official audit through the university, you typically turn in the work and still have to pay for the class (at a much lower rate/maybe free depending on the school). In that case, you still receive a grade for the class and often can choose at the end of the class to pay the difference to get full credit for the class.
