bipolar,fdzv43u,t3_en8455,1578796512.0,"Sadly I am looking at my pile of credit card debt. I made it to 30 before I realized and would admit that I have bipolar. My mother had a much more extreme version so I never thought my mood swings or impulse issues were bi polar. I'm on mood stabilizers for the first time in my life but it's a rather deep hole to dig out of, is it me or do the mood stabilizers just take away the highs and extreme lows?"
