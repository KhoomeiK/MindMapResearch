depression,fexaetz,t1_fethofk,1579427667.0,Sounds like you're suffering from PTSD. PTSD is a horrible mental illness to suffer from but it can be treated to minimise symptoms. I'm truly sorry for your situation and hope you feel better soon.

I agree, though. England has been getting very much warmer alarmingly quickly, not only in the winter, but the last few summers were very hot and sunny for our country. 

In any case, let's all just pray that we haven't gone past a point of no return and we still have time. David Attenborough said something that I saw on the BBC News app earlier that we are very close to a 'tipping point' in terms of irreversible climate change. 

Once the climate warms past a certain point, it opens the door to warming from other sources in extreme forms, like the methane being released as the permafrost melts. It's really worrying and pretty depressing."
