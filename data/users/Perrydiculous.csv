However, reagents aren't very useful to determine the quality of a substance. They should merely be used to indicate if the substance contains whatever you expect it to. To determine the quality, you'd need a lab to perform analysis through spectrometry. This analysis should always consist of 2 methods combined. The first one to separate the chemical contents of the substance (and determining the relative weights), the second part to determine what these individual molecules actually are.

First of all you should realize you're dealing with a research chemical. Regular use, which doesn't appear to cause any severe acute effects on your health, is already significantly more risky as these substances haven't been around long enough to accurately study their long term effects. This isn't the same as the common drugs that have been around for decades.

Secondly, if the effects are as closely related to MDMA as reported, using it two days in a row causes a shitload of neurotoxicity."

As for the quiting vs. reducing: That's entirely up to you & him of course ;) I personally don't have the discipline to regulate my use to that extent. I either use or I don't, but I'm incapable of using in moderation. Therefore I ""simply"" quit for half a year, last year, with which I had no trouble at all for some reason. But if you have sufficient control over it to just use less, I'd consider that to be the preferred route indeed :)

Quite interesting to hear that they obligate you to try to help someone where you live btw, my country-neighbor. Don't know how I feel about it yet, but I'll read up on it a bit.

researchchemicals,fdkyazq,t3_elx2km,1578513660.0,"I personally prefer to write things like this out, to prevent being interrupted or letting either your or your friend's emotions derail things from the intended message.

What I'd try to do is put emphasis on how much you care for him. Tell him that you recognize more and more similarities with the way you were when you were in a dark place and that you want to make sure that he's aware of this. Mention that you've personally been to hell and back and that you wouldn't want him to have to learn how destructive drug (ab)use can become the hard way, like you did.

Personally, I'd avoid mentioning wanting him to quit or expressing how worried you are too much, because that used to have me respond adversely.  

Let him know that if you're there for him if he ever needs to talk about anything or just needs someone for emotional support, completely on his own terms. (You'll be doing this for him, not to be able to tell yourself you tried to help.)

_sidenote:_

I personally believe that the only way to get someone to quit drugs is by having them acknowledge/realize that their life would be better without it. The decision to quit must come from the person themselves, it shouldn't be something others made them do. That way they'll be intrinsically motivated to work towards it.

At the moment I'm basically in charge of all dedicated servers and VPSes up until the point where I'm stuck. Then I just ask either my boss or the senior sysadmin and they'll guide me through it.

I've also asked if I could implement an idea I had to improve our CustomBuild DA before even knowing how the puppet system works. My advise is to just dive in and figure things out :)

Got the job, worked there for about a year and now one of the sysadmins left, and my boss asked me if I'd be interested in learning within the company to grow to replace the former sysadmin.



Anyway, to answer your questions:

1) Make a dummy environment

As people mentioned: Do not do anything unless you know exactly what it does.

Well... I agree for the most part, but you learn best from experience.
You think doing A+B > AB, but internet says C. You could blindly accept what you read, but when trying it out, you'll be involved in the process. As a result, you'll form a personal interpretation and develop a better understanding of the mechanics. You'll relate to it.

Expanding this frame of reference is essential for determining the likely cause of an issue, even if you've never come across that specific problem.

Create a training/testing environment with a similar configuration as you'll be working on.

2) Make notes

Any time you come across something you didn't know yet you should summarize the information for future reference. Even if it doesn't seem that complicated and especially when you think you'll never need it. (Because you will need it and you'll have forgotten.)

3) Don't ask out of impatience

Only ask after you've really attempted to figure it out yourself.
Don't allow yourself to become lazy and ask right away.
Sure, it'd be faster... but only right now, you won't develop a personal reasoning from just doing what you're told.
You're not supposed to be Sonic (yet). Now is the time to learn/train

4) Challenge yourself

Keep pushing your boundaries, take on projects that require a bit more knowledge than you currently possess. You'll never learn something if you keep avoiding it.

5) Backup

Always copy/move, then test and only if you're certain everything works, you should delete something.



That was all my personal pointers, I guess. As for not doing too much, overworking and stressing, you'll have to find your way. Just make sure you listen to your body & mind, and clearly communicate it when things get too hectic.

Good luck with this challenging journey and don't forget to enjoy it!"
