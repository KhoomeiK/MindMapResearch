But the corrolary is that *since you avoid products which advertise themselves in what you feel is obtrusive* that means when you're forced to buy a product you're influenced to pick products that you perceive to be less obtrusively advertised. That means the advertisement for that product *is* working."

It's literally taste and nothing else, I've done blind taste tests with friends because many think ""oh you can't actually tell the difference between X and Y""...well, I can. I know what I like and why I like it and if another brand could emulate it exactly but at a cheaper cost, I'd go with them.

You've sat and done a blind taste test of every product you have ever eaten against every possible equivalent product then. And of course tasted every product on the market beforehand to have a baseline with which to compare against. A ""yes"" is highly suspect.

(I'm skipping the intervening stuff for simplicity, it's mostly just your assertions and deconstructing them from a yes/no format is largely useless)

>In the extremely unlikely event they seem to be completely identical in every manner but packaging, the choice will be completely random.

Statistics say otherwise. You *think* it's random and from your perspective it certainly is. But the aggregate statistics of your choices would (and do) almost certainly show a proportional bias linked to some element of the product presentation.Maybe you prefer packaging that is more blue, or that uses a specific font, or maybe that avoids certain keywords. But barring making all your choices by flipping a coin there is definitely a bias in your choices when forced to be ""random"".

> My brain simply doesn't work the way you are sure it does. And this is all for the extreme remote hypothetical identical products which aren't actually a thing in my purchasing experience, there are always factors that make a difference on which I can base my choice and they are never anything to do with advertising.

Which just goes to my point. You're going to say, unequivocally ""no"" to literally any form of advertising having any effect on you that I propose. You've made up your mind that you are ""special"" and you could indeed be the 1/1000000 person that happens to be unmoved by anything that can be quantified. The likelihood is stupendously small, but you're going to assert no advertising has ever made any impact on your decisions regardless.

You're thinking to yourself ""no my actions are never affected by anything"". Statistically speaking that's more or less impossible. But you're certain of it because you're you and you assume you have complete control over your decisions unaffected by anything except rational.

Of course you're trying to strike *some* forms of advertisement from what you think is applicable to the discussion. Or assert that your decision is absolutely your own even if you make it based on a source ultimately derived from advertisement (fun fact: advertisement is supposed to set off word of mouth that's a goal). Or say that we're talking only about ""Buy my product"" commercials.

Statistically speaking *you've had decisions influenced based on how a product has been advertised to you*. You can choose to believe you haven't, but that would mean being absolutely sure no choice you have ever made in your life has had any input beyond absolute rational conscious deliberation. The problem with that theoretical truth is that it's impossible to quantify. And you're predisposed to assume that it's true, which of course makes self-reporting borderline useless.

You've probably made hundreds of thousands of purchases in your life. Can you in good faith assert that in no purchase you have ever made has ever been influenced in any way at all by how the product is presented to you?

I know for a fact that when I randomly choose between two things I pick ""purple"" things more. I did the math when I was curious so I know for a fact that bias exists when I make decisions (it was a fun project). Acting opposed to the bias of course just introduces another bias. And that's the thing, without a complete accounting of decisions you are making and breaking them down into components you can't accurately tell whether you have a bias in any way or not. But the smart money is on you having one.

Think of the things you've bought recently. Think about the reasons why. Go over them."
news,fgji4xc,t1_fgjf3dd,1580844530.0,"You ever read into some of the double blind taste tests that have been done? When given two blind sodas and told to pick which one tastes better testers *frequently* deviate from their declared ""preferred"" taste. A large part of why you like the soda you like is likely based on brand loyalty. That bleeds into literally everything that you have a ""preference"" when selecting brands.

Some of it is habituation. Some of it experience. Some of it is rooted in how your perceptions were afgected when they formed by advertisements *a very long time ago*. Or how advertisements affected the people who raised you, or the people you know.

I'd have to know *literally every decision you make* to show a concrete point where *yes an advertisement (any advertisememt not just commercials) influenced your decisions*. Statistically speaking its impossible for advertising of any kind to fail to influence you. Practically speaking it's impossible for me to take shots in the dark and miravulously find a random instance in which advertising clearly directly affected your purchases.

So let's do a simple open question. I assume you read books.

**How do you decide which books to buy?**

Do you read the jacket? That's a carefully chosen excerpt or synopsis to advertise the books content. Do you pick by cover art? That's a passive advertisement (hey look at me). Do you have a favorite author? That's brand loyalty. Do you pick based on critics or pull from the best sellers lists? Those are forms of advertisement designed to shape how you feel about the books (and to generate revenue for the critic/list). Do you pick books recommended by your friends? How did they pick? What about books recommended based on what else you've read (if you use an e-reader)? That's advertisent too.

Can you, with absolute certainty, say none of those influence any of your book purchases? That means you're picking at complete random.

If you absolutely don't read replace ""books"" with something else. And here's another.

**When you're looking at products what do you look at first aside from price?**

Packaging is advertising. There's big money in it because *humans are predictable*. Think about when you're in need of something you don't need often. What gets your attention? How do you decide between two different products if you can't find a review? What if two products appear identical?

We as a group drift toward color schemes and styles we are familiar with. Change the color of butter packaging and it affects sales, and not minimally. There's a reason medicines always seem to have an ""x"" or ""z"" in their trade names. Those letters are associated with ""science"" or ""medicine"" by the general public. As are certain word endings like ""en"" and ""ol"". Can you be absolutely certain you're making a random choice when two products are identical? You probably think your choice is random, but evidence shows that advertisement skews your choice one way or another. It's impossible to definitively say whether *your* specific choice was affected, but statistics shows that the population when choosing ""randomly"" favors ever so slightly the item that has been better advertised to them. Essentially you're rolling weighted dice when you make a random choice. Unless tou flip a coin."

The question is how things are sold and how they are incentivized. Hell I don't even have a problem with lootboxes as long as they're fair.

But there are games being launched literally unfinished. And I don't mean ""with DLC already planned"". I mean with features unfinished or game breaking bugs present. Or both.

Using MTX to ""justify"" supporting an unfinished release is not a laudable business practice. Games as a product have eroded to games as a service with the rise of digital distribution. And it's having an impact on quality of releases."

ESRB ratings are not required by any law, they are not directly regulated by any law, they are not enforced by any law. In the US  No company has to refuse to carry AO games, no company is prevented from selling an AO game to minors. They choose not to.

My \*entire argument\* here is that you're making assumptions about what would or would not be defined as content. I have not proffered any such definitions. You created a ridiculous hypothetical under the assumption that it met an undefined criteria for ""content"". I retorted that it does not automatically meet any definitions and could easily fail to meet what would be defined as ""content"" for the purpose of determining whether the hypothetical MTX would warrant a hypothetical soft ban.

No game can be perfect. But that's not an excuse to ship an obvious beta.

You're going to sit there and try to find fault with literally anything I say though. I've used your arguments to explain why games go live with problems. That doesn't mean it's a free excuse that absolves publishers of all culpability for the state of their product.

And FYI EA delayed a patch. For a game they've already made their money on. That's not a release delay."
