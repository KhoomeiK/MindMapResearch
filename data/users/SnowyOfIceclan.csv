PersonalFinanceCanada,ffbpavi,t1_faiybsd,1579776936.0,"I'm going to say: it can. Myself and my FMIL have vet insurance on our cats. If they develop a chronic condition or get in a major medical crisis, it can save you A LOT. All 4 of our cats have a 150-250 deductible per condition, and past that it gets covered 90% for the life of the animal with my provider (Trupanion). 

My FMIL pays $70/month and has saved double digit thousands thanks to me insisting they get insured at 5 months old. First birthday, $900 vet bill to find out the boy has pancreatitis, fatty liver, and acute diabetes. He's 5 years old now, and his insulin and antibiotics cost like $10/month after insurance."

ADHD,felqmfi,t3_ept22n,1579228557.0,"As a kid, I was always over-stimulated by everything, fidgety and outgoing. I had difficulty staying on task going into high school. Grade 10 to 11 I took a STEEP dive in inability to stay on task. At that time, teachers suggested I might have ADHD or autism due to the social issues i experience as part of it. My room and locker were disasters, and I had less than 0 drive to actually clean it. If I started, I'd get distracted by what I found. I was described as a bubbly space case. Timesense was never a thing for me, and misplacing/forgetting things was my specialty. 

College was better. I was engaged, interested, focused because it was all interesting.
Until I couldn't keep up with due dates. Misplacing notes. (Impressive considering most of it was on a laptop) procrastinating until I'm pulling an all-nighter the night before it's due, then sleep-writing my test the next morning. 

I'm now going into my third change of major. My psychologist suggested I might have ADHD and autism. Again, I dove into research. Three mental health practitioners, teachers, counselors couldn't  *all*  be wrong, could they?

I finally got to see a psychiatrist who specialized in neurodevelopmental problems. The same doc who helped start up the adult autism diagnostic clinic in my area. Half hour in, there's 0 doubt I have comorbid ADHD on top of the Aspergers diagnosis I got 8 months prior. This was yesterday, after spending 2 hours bouncing between different modes of public transit, distracting myself with Pogo and reddit the whole way in -48¬∞ C weather.  

Gotta say, it's a major weight off my shoulders, having both major diagnoses to get my life in order and being medicated. Now to just get the depression and anxiety and mood swings worked on üòÖ"
