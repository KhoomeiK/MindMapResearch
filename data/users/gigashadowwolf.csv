I used to use them at school.

They are awfully difficult to erase with, but for me at least they were just about the right amount of eraser to get through the whole pencil without running out of eraser."

Megalodon teeth are fairly common. I purchased mine, but from what I hear there are parts of the U.S. where you can find them with only a bit of work and digging. I bought mine for $20 but you can find them online regularly for about $60-70 these days. The bigger ones go for way more. Just make sure to triple check most of the time the ones under $200 are made from a mold. They actually feel pretty real though. 

Trilobite and nautilus fossils are incredibly common. So much so they can be purchased from furniture stores as bookends and things like that. 

The meteorite peice was similarly not worth all that much as they are fairly common too. 

The port is almost certainly past drinkablity, but it was still at it's peak 20 years ago when I took the bottle from the leftovers at the end of New Year's. I think I remember my friend who bought them told me he drank his leftover bottle about 10 years ago for 2010 and said it was not very good anymore. In 2001, I saw the same bottle sell for $899, but I can't assume it has gone up in value after getting less drinkable.

The only two on the list really worth anything would be the crossbow. Which I have been told is worth about 10-20k and the ivory carvings possibly, which have not yet been verified and I don't know their value. But I do know they are at LEAST about 100 years old because my great grandfather brought them back in the early 20s. He gave them to my grandfather when he passed and my grandfather gave them to me when he passed last September."
AskReddit,ffv0eu8,t1_ffuwrzp,1580252844.0,"So I like wine, but I am by no means an expert, so I am sure someone can correct me here, but as I understand it the answer is both yes and no. 

They are not quite all that far off from other wines in terms of value, but just like with all wines it comes down to way more than simply their age. Each wine will only age so long before they peak, the after that they gradually get less and less tasty until they see considered undrinkable. 

This said age has a little less of an effect on the value of Port wines because they typically last longer than a table wine. Each wine can only age so long before it starts turning into vinegar. It takes a very exceptional wine to last longer than 50 years. Port wines are often aged 10-20 years before even being sold, where as table wines are typically aged less than a few years. So a 100 year old Port wine that is still within peak drinking age is very rare, but a table wine at 100 years still being drinkable is exceptionally rare and therefore more valuable. 

Also the market for Port is just not quite as big as that of high end French wines. 

The bottle I have is honestly probably not good anymore, so it's probably not worth all that much.

This all said it is not uncommon to see 100 year old bottles of Port selling for 3-8k. The very one we drank I saw at a wine shop for $899 a year later, but I am almost positive my friend didn't pay more than $200 a bottle for them, so even with the case discount, I assume the wine shop was just really marked up in price. Or perhaps enough people drank what was Left New Year's 2000 that the wine became much more rare therefore raising the price."

I would love to get into something like that at some point. 

Here is a kind of funny story, that is very loosely related. So I love to scuba dive out here on the west coast. I primarily dive off the coast of either California, Baja California, and once every so often I make it out to Hawaii. A couple of years ago I got to spend some time sailing in the Gulf of Mexico, mainly in the Yukatan and several Caribbean Islands. When diving at a ship wreck off the coast of Puerto Rico, I found what appeared to be a stash of dabloons. I took a few up with me. Apparently people have habit of buying these cheap replicas and leaving them at ship wrecks all over the area for people to discover. Still pretty fun though and I keep it displayed as if it were real."
