SuicideWatch,fcvurob,t3_ej4wzo,1578010564.0,"I used to think that the overused quote ""Time heals everything"" was just bullshit. Trust me it fucking isn't. When i was at my lowest point year back, i'd cut my wrists on a daily basis, cry all the time, fantasize about killing myself and i kept falling deep into the void of depression. I managed to pick myself up and i'm just happy that i made it through. I gained battle scars all over my arms, but i'm happy i didn't cut deep enough to kill myself ( that was my intention ). I'm probably just an internet stranger for you, but please dm me. I'm 17 years old and trust me, i know what are you going through. Love u"
