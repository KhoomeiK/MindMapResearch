More importantly, if we wanted films that seem like total propaganda pieces to use that hide details gone, the network would get calls to take it down.

You’re also conflating the government banning something with a government request that a private corporation not list the film. They as a company wouldn’t be fined, arrested, banned, or investigated for not complying, it’s a matter of staying on their good side for the purposes of business.

It still should have had a Renegade/Paragon system, the companions should have reacted to that (Ryder in convo: Liam go fuck yourself, Ryder in cutscene: Liam, you’re my best friend), and above all they should have made Ryder more capable.

I’d have much preferred they be a resource, with people like Kai Leng being part of a Cerberus fringe, that indoctrinates the Illusive Man. In fact, give Cerberus a redemptive arc into becoming an Alliance asset again, with Miranda Lawson as the head.

And finally, make *all* of the ME2 characters matter. Not just in side missions, but the final battle. I want to see Zaeed helping lead Aria’s mercs, Kasumi and Kolyat (probably not Thane...) killing some husks and hacking into something, Jack and her students kicking ass, Grunt and Wrex leading a battalion of Urdnot troops, Garrus rallying turian forces, Samara with some commandos following her charge, Miranda ordering a Cerberus charge, Tali and/or Legion calling in orbital strikes with Geth and Quarian ships, Jacob with a crew of his Alliance corsair buddies, and some salarian STG that were students of Mordin. I wanted to see cutscenes of all of that as I marched into the Crucible alone.

Then, for ME3’s ending, make it that unless you’re willing to either submit to the Reapers to prevent galactic entropy (as in Tali’s recruitment mission on Haestrom), you can only weaken them by hacking their communications and coordination. Want to save the galaxy? It all comes down to how many people you kept alive, what enemies you weakened, what allies you made. Three endings, one for not having enough and failing, one for having just enough to win, and one for having more than enough to win (which can be gained for really trigger-happy players by having just enough and doing the multiplayer). 

Then what you did in ME2 was suddenly critical to saving the galaxy."

Also health issues are relatively minor and are more from inbreeding than from actually having short legs. While they can’t jump as high as most cats, I’ve never seen a munckin cat that wasn’t aware of that and didn’t adjust. They know their jump height, and can groom themselves just fine."

Refused to recognize that he was bourgeois, not proletariat. I’m over here like *dude. You’re mom owns oil fields. You go to college for free*. He thinks working one retail job and getting fired for backtalking his boss too often makes him worthy to be a “Vanguard of the People’s Revolution.”

There’s some dumb copy-pasta I remember that always stuck with me. In America the proletariat is not upper middle class white college kids or even lower middle class minority college kids. The proletariat is Jamal the hoodlum from the inner city, and Cletus the redneck from the boonies.

*Ehhhhhhh*? Kinda? 

Roman sexuality is difficult to really understand for us. They seemed to think in terms of penetration; a man who was manly fucked anyone, but it was still weird not to fuck women. And men who dressed like women were weird... but also okay to fuck? And dudes who were penetrated by women were seen as real weird.

So honestly they had gender roles and traditions. Juvenal has a poem all about how Rome is going to shit because so many men are cross dressing and acting too effeminate. But ultimately it was about *power*. If you were *dominant* it was good. If you were *submissive* (as a man) you were strange. Dominant women were seen as dangerous, but not deviant."
