MadeMeSmile,ffgvsxj,t1_ffgtmmc,1579916335.0,"It’s not. It’s a military member’s perspective to the majority of redditors who are not military and post videos of homecomings that, while significant, are not quite as significant as the homecomings of men and women that are in combat zones, not simply “away” for 2-3 months. 

Here’s why: there are plenty of family heroes that go away for 2-3 months for training or travel in non-military jobs. They leave their families for the benefit of providing a better future for their families. No one seems to post videos of that, yet they are equally as amazing as basic training. The man or woman who leaves their family to get their orientation by their corporation, etc. 

So, those of us who are in or have been in- we see videos like this in the same capacity as non-military family heroes. 

The only homecoming videos most of us military folks feel should be important are the combat homecomings. 6-12 months, sometimes more. Coming home to family members that feared, every minute, that you could die or be taken prisoner and tortured. For all that time. 

And those family members are the real heroes. 

Just like the every day folks going to work for their families."
