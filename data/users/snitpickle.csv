mentalhealth,ffv2rlu,t3_evcw4j,1580254339.0,"You are not alone, there are people in very similar places, like me. I have things that haunt me and have haunted me for years, even decades. One of my biggest mistakes is I turned to the bottle. I drank pretty much every day, for 8 years and slowly got heavier and heaver into drinking. I realised very recently that my anxiety issues and my drinking were going to kill me and I would never be able to ask for forgiveness and fix the things I've done wrong. But 5 days ago I made the first step, I quit drinking. I asked for help and began my detox. The last 5 days have been the most painful and exhausting days of my life. Luckily the withdrawal symptoms didn't kill me like it has to so many, but it felt like it came close. But that is the only the first step. I'm seeking help emotionally, and making life changes. Getting rid of the things that promoted the toxic life style, no matter how precious they are to me. Seeking therapy to deal with what I've been trying to bury. Once I have healed myself, I will be ready to ask those I've hurt for forgiveness. 

I hope my little story can help you."
