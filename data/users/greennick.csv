NBN should have been testing for that, but I got sick of their shit and paid a dude to test it. He then repaired connections off my property and run a new direct line from outside the house to my modem. All up cost $250, but was cheap at twice the price."

worldnews,fdioy32,t1_fdil1k0,1578447774.0,"From your source...

Unfortunately for the right, however, they are just as wrong about this issue now as they were in 2003 — but for a peculiar, little-understood reason: Saddam Hussein was not trying to hide the chemical munitions found by the U.S. Just the opposite, in fact.

In an interview with The Intercept, Charles Duelfer, head of the CIA’s definitive post-war investigation of Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction programs, explained that “Saddam didn’t know he had it … This is stuff Iraqi leaders did not know was left lying around. It was not a militarily significant capability that they were, as a matter of national policy, hiding.”"
worldnews,fdid2ci,t1_fdi8oqm,1578440150.0,">Iraq - Has used WMD's before we went there and some were found in Iraq. They were not nukes, but they were still willing to use chemical weapons. This would be a direct threat to any nation in the middle east or where agents could travel. Even if Iraq had nukes we would have went there. Because we went there looking for WMD's.

WMDs were not found in Iraq on any scale. That was a total lie by Cheney and the Bush government, I'm surprised anyone is still parroting it.

>In Libya, it was a civil war and we supported one side as a NATO operation using the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973. Libya was not just the US, it was NATO. If Libya had nukes, then you would have probably expected that the US would have went there anyway as well. Due to nukes falling in the wrong hands.

I doubt the US would have been destabilising them in the first place if they had nukes, so it wouldn't have gotten to that.

>North Korea is just using it as an excuse to develop more. Trying to get public opinion and support on their side. It is nothing more than propaganda.

Regardless of whether you agree nukes makes them more or less secure, I'm not sure it's propaganda if it's their genuinely held belief."
