You have the perfect hair to pomp with. Hella thicc and long on top. Ask your barber for a side part with a mid fade.

Also you’ll need a pomade. [Crystal Lake](https://www.shearrevival.com/collections/pomade/products/crystal-lake-water-based-pomade) is a classic.

Consider buying a prestyler such as [Blackwater](https://flagshippomade.com/blogs/black-water/black-water-new-release) and blowdryer for extra volume and control."
