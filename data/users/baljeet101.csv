I guess personal opinions could disagree but I would say no one in my high school looks like majority of the characters in the show. I guess clay and tyler could exceptions?"

13ReasonsWhy,ffd9qku,t1_ffby4h8,1579816202.0,I’m not saying they have to be actually high school students but it would be nice to have someone that looks like an actual teenager. I forget her name but Tyler’s girlfriend in seasons 2 seemed really old and I have no idea why they casted her. But the actor who plays Tyler was 19 (I think) when he began acting in 13 reasons why and he seems to be one of the best actors in the entire show.

4WeddingsAndAFuneral,ff56qhm,t1_ff54hx0,1579581824.0,"Oh I see, I was fearing it would be a quantico type of deal where they left a major cliff hanger at the end of season 3 when it got cancelled.

ABCDesis,ff50rml,t1_ff4w1e6,1579577148.0,Growing up Kajol was my favorite Bollywood actress because she was the only few who had skin as dark as mine. But after watching her  dilwale and seeing her trade her dark skin and black hair for a lighter complexion and brown locks was very disheartening. Obviously she hasn’t admitted to skin lightening but the change seems pretty noticeable to deny that she at least tries to present herself as lighter

4WeddingsAndAFuneral,ff4he9t,t1_ff4gyyu,1579563663.0,Thanks! I’m halfway through the first episode and the dialogue isn’t as quippy as the Mindy project and seems to be on the more dramatic romantic side but it seems pretty interesting.

Ahhh I really want them to redo the whole entire show. I don’t want Danny and Mindy to have a Ross and Rachel ending. Oh why do writers always have to screw over their audience :("
NetflixSexEducation,ff20vtg,t1_ff1ycfq,1579490821.0,Very true. I hope they delve into his story line more. He seems super mysterious. I think he’s supposed to be around the same age as Maeve so I’m wondering if he dropped out of school or something. Anyways his backstory is half baked and I hope he has a substantial role though it season 3. Although he’s supposed to be a villain I think he has a potential to be a good one

13ReasonsWhy,fey2vlb,t1_fexk89n,1579440019.0,I think my word choice was poor. I’m not justifying the bullying but I was just wondering what intention they were trying to achieve with Ani
NetflixSexEducation,fex38w7,t1_fetk7ao,1579423573.0,"I don’t think people ship people that easily. A lot of people on this sub prefer some relationships to remain platonic like between Viv and Jackson and Ola and Adam.

Ruby sort of reminds me of Blair Waldorf from gossip girl and her dynamic with Maeve is similar to Blair’s and  Serena in earlier seasons. I’m not exactly sure if you seen the show but I just wanted to provide an example where the bully can grow up and develop into a great complex character. I think cornering her into remaining a bully forever won’t do justice to her role."
13ReasonsWhy,fex2hvj,t1_few7luc,1579423232.0,"Perhaps my wording was off. But judging by the past incidents of Justin and Timothy getting immense backlash for simply playing a poor received character similar to ani, I thought maybe the writers maybe knew it might be coming?"

NetflixSexEducation,fevue5o,t1_fevnamg,1579401628.0,"I noticed some of the slang is similar to Toronto slang in Canada except a few notable phrases/expressions. I guess it’s the Jamaican influences of both regions?

NetflixSexEducation,feu3s1g,t3_eqkszc,1579382843.0,"Why do you have trust issues against disabled people? He didn’t do what he did because he was disabled , he did it because he wanted Maeve for himself."

NetflixSexEducation,fesqdpa,t3_eqh1fc,1579367926.0,Ikkk I wish they did a whole 24 episode season with properly played out character arcs developed and release each episode every week throughout the year. I know this is probably not a super sustainable format for Netflix but after binging it for 2 days and having to wait a whole other year for more content it’s really frustrating
NetflixSexEducation,fespq1f,t3_eqbtud,1579367719.0,Definitely. Maeve and Otis would have been great but they’re dragging it out wayyyy too long. After 2 seasons they can’t even admit they like each other face to face. Ruby and Maeve would be a super interesting dynamic
