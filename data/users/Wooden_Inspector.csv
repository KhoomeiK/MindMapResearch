depression,ff8yggn,t3_es7hop,1579700091.0,Being isolated is the hardest part about nights tbh too much time too think about why life's shit
self,ff8y7cm,t3_es9z3p,1579699883.0,"I'm 23 now and 50 doesn't seem that far off tbh, old people in general don't really seem old anymore."
amiugly,ff8xuhf,t1_ff7frtu,1579699582.0,Exactly what a load of bollicks
tressless,ff7ibi3,t3_erxafi,1579650215.0,I'd assume so
bald,ff5n6hf,t3_ermnho,1579601306.0,Looks good and now you can blend in easier with your wall.
tressless,ff5mx6c,t3_erlb30,1579600917.0,Yes. Most people don't have sides. I did however have watery semen for a short period of time. But I wouldn't class that as anything major.
depression,fe8zwyy,t1_fe8pu46,1578932752.0,"Shits so scary, a shotgun blast to the head, is the most surefire way only has a 99 percent success rate. So there's a 1 in 100 chance you'll survive in some state. Imagine if the lottery odds were that high, you'd put it on every week"
bald,fe83qfz,t3_enzalb,1578922175.0,"Id just go for the shave if I was you, don't really have the coverage to pull of a 1 or 2 since you're badly receeded. Looks pretty shit as is, so either that or start with the hairloss drugs"
IncelsWithoutHate,fdzchlq,t3_emsl4m,1578788899.0,I just go 3 times a week and do full body. Might change to upper lower. Do better? With women? No. I can't really do much to improve the shape of my head/face. I feel I look and feel a little better though.
beards,fdyvb92,t3_enexiy,1578783987.0,Should say it's been almost a month?
depression,fdq0lxf,t3_emfeyp,1578648943.0,Definitley! Although I think the main thing that's holding me back is how physically painful it is not dissapointing anyone
amiugly,fdq0in4,t3_emhxwv,1578648811.0,I don't know if this is a troll or someone just fishing for likes? You're a 8 or 9 /10. The fuck
IncelTears,fdoh1ze,t3_elabza,1578604993.0,"As an 4/10 ugly guy, i'd agree it's a waste of time doing these things hoping to get a date. However books, changing your waldrobe, meeting new people can do wonders for your mind and soul. 

Just don't expect that making any personal improvements or going on tinder is going to get you a girlfriend. 

Need to be able to be happy by yourself, especially if you're an ugly guy."
IncelTears,fdofdp4,t3_em9gks,1578604049.0,Bollicks to all the people saying an Incel wouldn't do well with women if they looked like that.

IncelTears,fdlh950,t1_fdkqkm0,1578523978.0,It could be the problem you don't know what he looks like
IncelsWithoutHate,fdlgj32,t3_elj6mb,1578523536.0,I think when I'm done with uni and have a decent job I'll look into this
depression,fdkvcwa,t1_fdjq57t,1578511927.0,Poor friend
depression,fdk34ja,t3_elr1rq,1578494899.0,I was thinking about this earlier. Like if a terrorist attack happened I think I'd jump into help like a hero. But I'd really only be doing it hoping they'd kill me
tressless,fdgu4y7,t1_fdgogxe,1578408384.0,I had sexual side effects on SSRI's but none on Fin. The side effects are far more common with SSRI's due to the fact they increase seratonin.
depression,fdexoux,t3_ekwbox,1578348800.0,Yeah. For me I think it's because I realise how shit the world is and just accept it. I'm falsey going against that when I try to get better
workgonewild,fcsvq02,t3_ei5yw1,1577926323.0,Keep up the good work! Easily my favourite person on this sub
depression,fagsvhh,t3_e93cvh,1576070226.0,"Hopefully not, 23 year old student with parents and I can't stand it. Although I don't think it'd be something to be ashamed of, moving out seems impossible these days unless you have a SO"
