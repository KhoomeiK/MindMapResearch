If you got 50 cents in your account we aren’t letting you cash a check written somewhere else, we’d just deposit it on a 2 day hold. If we knew the check was fraud we’d put it on a 5 day hold. If we really know it’s fraud (like, it’s written from our bank and we can see it’s a bad check) we’d just say no. 

Cops are only called in extreme cases, like someone threatening violence."

I’d be open to the idea that men can abandon their child if they want, if the government did a better job supporting families. But this isn’t the same discussion as abortion.
