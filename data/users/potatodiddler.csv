I did another 12 the month before graduation despite knowing I was getting an offer from my current company I was interning with (still with them). I did not get an offer from every one of them, in fact it, was closer to like 1/6 of the interviews lead to an offer. But I had my choice of the companies when it came around and had leverage for more salary. Get out there and talk to more people. This job is mostly talking to people and relationships, you'll need to get good at it."
