religiousfruitcake,ffel2ib,t1_ff8tq82,1579852566.0,Exactly. Yet all of their doctrines they claim to be based on the Bible. I can’t find the scripture where it says no whole blood but fractions of blood are ok.
cults,ffdkika,t1_ff9wzc9,1579822812.0,Exactly. The Caleb and Sophia cartoons are frightening. The level of indoctrination is abusive.
exjw,ffaw4tu,t1_ffa48pc,1579745867.0,"You’re right he did. What is so impressive to me is that my father was truly enamored with the organization. He really respected it and loved it. He was a black and white thinker, “let my yes mean yes..., followed direction to the letter of the law. People either loved or hated him, I never heard of an in between. I was stunned when this woman told me what he did. He followed his gut. He followed his morals. I love that."
religiousfruitcake,ff7rv3f,t1_ff6hdie,1579656844.0,"It’s control and fear tactics. They also need identifying marks that sets them apart to claim they are the true religion. When people attack them for their beliefs they say “see, we are being persecuted just like Jesus!” Only a small percentage will be faced with the life death decision of taking blood but if you condition over 8 million people to have the mindset that they WOULD DIE for this cause  then you start to get a loyalty and allegiance, a following that us loyal and will follow direction without question."
cults,ff7rh6t,t1_ff6nvhr,1579656578.0,Only fainting goats and the bisexuals get stoned on Mondays. The homosexuals are used to catch the sacrificial goats. Pretty sure.
religiousfruitcake,ff7rbax,t1_ff6wf18,1579656464.0,I think it’s ok behind the wheel.
exjw,ff7r9yq,t1_ff705qz,1579656438.0,WOOT DAD!
cults,ff7r6rt,t1_ff7dgqd,1579656374.0,Thank goodness. Love happy endings.
cults,ff7r4ga,t1_ff7etjm,1579656330.0,The longer I’m away from it the more clear my mind becomes. For real. It’s mind numbing.
exjw,ff7r0yj,t1_ff7gmtw,1579656260.0,He’d be so amazed by this. He was humble. Never lived up to his own expectations and standards. It was kind of sad. I don’t think he ever felt good enough.
exjw,ff7qwla,t1_ff7paf6,1579656175.0,I really don’t know what to think. I mean in some ways it’s always been a misogynistic abuse of power type thing. I think it’s just like anything else. There are always human hearts that prevail. That outshine the others. It’s like when you see certain kids with that sparkle in their eye. Or like a Schindler in Nazi Germany. One person’s heart motivates them to reach out to the masses. I don’t know if I’m that kind of person but I do know that I have more of a spark left in me than the ones that are still in do.
exjw,ff7qjw1,t1_ff7pzok,1579655931.0,I went two years ago. As I left there I knew it would be the last time. I couldn’t stop staring at the kids. I felt so sad for them. I know the next time I walk into that building it will be because someone I love has died.
exjw,ff7pacv,t1_ff7fixr,1579655039.0,It’s funny. I always felt like the black sheep too. I didn’t fit in. Even among my five siblings. I’m glad we are wired different. I’m even more glad we figured that out and got the heck outta Dodge.

cults,ff7mtzo,t1_ff7mjst,1579653318.0,How sad. On so many levels. I know all to well the guilt tactics used in spiritual abuse. The affects it has can be debilitating. .
exjw,ff7mkq4,t1_ff7gjoy,1579653143.0,You have a beautiful way of looking at things. A good reminder to me to find the positive or growth in it all. ty.

exjw,ff7hia8,t1_ff6u35m,1579649674.0,"“Mommy and daddy loves you very much *kiss*”. 

That happened every night of my life. Even the night he died. (Bawling) I’m so sorry you lost your dad too. It is so wonderful that he knew how much his little girl loved him before he died, what a gift, to be able to tell someone so important the impact their life had. Ggaaaaaaahhhhh!! Hugs"
