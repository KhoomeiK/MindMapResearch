space,felc16v,t1_fejxth8,1579218645.0,"Because historically Alpha Centauri was considered to be closest star to Sun, but they found Proxima Centuari in orbit around the binary center stars, that is tiny bit closer to us. Alpha Centuri system is still closest star system to us."
space,felbx1r,t1_fel6etc,1579218567.0,"Yes, third star, the Proxima centuri was discovered in early 20th century."

eu4,fe9ybpu,t1_fe8txrf,1578942562.0,"More trade companies, but most likely also modified/nerfed trade companies. So people would be upset about nerfs."

factorio,fe943w1,t1_fe71fkv,1578934007.0,"Can confirm, moved from third world, all my old games still work. I changed steam country, so have to pay higher local price now (permanent move, so had to change country)."
todayilearned,fdqtmc9,t1_fdqn3ur,1578674614.0,"Its kind of legalese, but the act allows ""continued use of English in parliament and courts, in addition to hindi"" without actually making it official language. As I said, it is unofficially official language of union.

Act gives english a seat on council but denies it rank of master."
todayilearned,fdqhhe0,t1_fdqguj5,1578666784.0,"No, India has 16 ""scheduled languages"" and no national language. English is unofficially official language if that makes sense. But like US it is used everywhere, at least in law making, but is not official language of nation, or even among 16 scheduled languages or among recognised regional languages (These things are defined in constitution)."

factorio,fcir3aq,t1_fcil3gl,1577667807.0,You just gotta reroll until you find a map with green around you with some trees dotted all around to eat the pollution for a while. Also some defensive positions of water/cliffs would be useful.
factorio,fcgha66,t3_eh5z6q,1577640004.0,"Find a map seed with more trees and less desert around you, so pollution doesnt hit the biters on west right away. Otherwise survival is difficult."
