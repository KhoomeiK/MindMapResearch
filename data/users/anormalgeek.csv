TooAfraidToAsk,ff6mm6j,t3_ertrnm,1579630429.0,"I am not arguing that it is the best approach for this, but the IDEA is that you're giving the servers direct financial incentive to provide great service. In theory, this makes for better service, happier customers, better reputation for the business, etc. Since the servers are there to make money, the best ones will work the hardest to please customers and thus make the most money. In reality, most servers do a good job and their tips are based on the whims of the customers moreso than the actual level of service they provide.

But a competent manager can also ensure great service. Costco doesn't accept tips, but I have never had anything but fast, friendly, and competent service at their food court. And I'm only spending $1.50 on a hot dog and drink there. In my opinion, it has stuck around due to lazy restaurant managers more than any other source. They are offloading their work of assessing employee performance and coaching them onto customers."

Every bill and coin you ever wasted comes flying back towards you at high speed from wherever in the world it is currently located. Shreds of paper are ripped from trash piles.

Tens of thousands of sonic booms from all directions. Millions are killed either directly by flying metal and unstoppable paper or indirectly due to stuff like traffic accidents and entire skyscrapers having their fondations sliced to ribbons and collapsing. The closer to you, the more concentrated the destruction. 

When the money finally reaches you, it stops and falls harmlessly at your feet. You survive just fine. But its like a hundred thousand small arrows have been drawn across the land, all pointing to you. Everyone knows they came for you. They blame you. And all for, what? Like $10,000, tops?"

So they came up with a big list of rules.
