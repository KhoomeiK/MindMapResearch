dogs,ffga9yq,t1_ffg5ar5,1579901838.0,"Her dog died and she *immediately* went on a very public crusade against Petsmart. She made a facebook page, a Gofundme, organized protests, went to the media, proposed legislation. She got so many people fooled into thinking Petsmart killed her dog. She got the necropsy results back early on and refused to breathe a word of the results to anyone, she didn't post them publicly, she refused to give them to Petsmart, she just held onto them and continued her crusade because she was in too deep to backtrack.

I knew it was a load of shit from day one so as far as I'm concerned this is a very satisfying conclusion. Maybe she should have waited until she had some concrete evidence before she went after a huge corporation."
dogs,ff8gmp5,t3_es88i4,1579677599.0,"The symptoms of bladder cancer are almost identical to the symptoms of a UTI. Sometimes cancer does move real quick.

Enrofloxacin is a broad spectrum antibiotic and both appropriate and commonly prescribed for UTIs. I'm not sure hope you think there was ""improper antibiotic use"" involved here, if the dose is correct and you've been administering the medication as prescribed you should see a response it is indeed a UTI."

dogs,ff58656,t3_erpl6q,1579583075.0,"Well, I can tell you for sure she's never going to recover without surgery if you aren't keeping her from running around. The non-surgical, conservative approach to partial ACL tears involves a lot of crate rest and *controlled* physical rehab. 

Allowing her to continue to run around with this injury is not only going to prevent it from improving at all, it's going to make it worse such that surgery will definitely be inevitable if you want her to be sound and pain free.

I'm not sure why you're saying it doesn't seem to pain her. Limping and carrying the leg up are both major signs of pain."
dogs,fezjcmr,t3_eqziis,1579457956.0,"Glaucoma can be a primary condition in which case you'd generally expect to see it in both eyes, or it can be secondary to another condition like a detached retina or a cataract in one eye, in which case you wouldn't really expect to see it in the second eye. 

Even if it does come up in the second eye, you can potentially manage it with medication if you catch it early. There are several different eyedrops that can be used to treat glaucoma. Glaucoma doesn't *have* to result in blindness or removal of the eye. 

That said, if it were to get to that point, it's your call to make. Many dogs do adjust to being blind just fine. They do require some special care, of course, but they can still lead pretty full lives."
dogs,fewyby0,t1_fewseax,1579421363.0,"Irregular is *completely* fine and normal as long as they're happening less frequently and/or aren't clusters. Your dog isn't going to suddenly start having an increased amount of seizures because you put her on medication for them. There are a handful of different medications that can be used at different dosages alone or in combination if necessary to find a good means to manage the seizures. 

You've never heard of anyone being able to stop medicating their dog because nobody tries. Epilepsy is a lifelong condition that tends to be progressive, why would anyone take their dog completely *off* medication and risk finding out at the dog's expense that it really *was* helping more than they thought? Nobody does that! 

Potassium bromide is indeed not FDA approved, although it is approved for use in humans elsewhere. Phenobarbital is also not FDA approved for use in animals. And yet, these are two of the most common anticonvulsants prescribed in veterinary medicine. KBr on its own is pretty safe, when combined with phenobarbital it does seem to increase the risk of pancreatitis. 

Personally I'd rather treat pancreatitis than status epilepticus, the odds of survival are better. 

There really isn't such a lack of information on epilepsy like you're making it out to be. Brain damage is a known possible result especially with status epilepticus or cluster seizures. Your dog has been having uncontrolled cluster seizures at frequent, regular intervals. The personality change you're seeing is almost certainly brain damage and irreversible. 

It's really pretty black and white. Your dog may have had a sensitivity to a particular medication that resulted in these seizures. This is now a lifelong issue for her and it needs to be treated as the serious and potentially life-threatening health concern that it is. She is having frequent cluster seizures and requires medication, full stop. The risks of medication are **not** greater than the risk of one of these clusters completely frying her brain."
dogs,feswe2v,t1_fesnayx,1579369680.0,The dog's behavior in the video is less than stellar and his manners while walking on a leash at the end of the clip are absolutely atrocious. If the dog was behaving even remotely that way at the airport then I have no doubt the airport for the right thing.
dogs,feq1zb6,t1_fepufk4,1579336337.0,"9 years isn't old for a chihuahua.

If you are worried about the side effects like lethargy, ataxia, increased thirst, or change in appetite you should really know that these are transient side effects and generally resolve within a few weeks of starting medication. If they don't resolve completely and the seizures are well controlled, the dosage can be altered slightly to try to mitigate those.

If it's mostly the long-term side effects, well... use a different drug? Phenobarbital is notorious for having the potential for liver damage especially at high doses for extended periods of time, but there are so many other medication options that aren't as hard on the dog; potassium bromide, keppra, zonisamide, and gabapentin are a few.

My dog was epileptic. He always had a single grand mal seizure at a time, lasting 2 minutes or less. Never a cluster. I put him on medication when his seizures got to be about 6wks apart. I was concerned for the long-term health of his liver so my vet and I agreed to try potassium bromide. On the bromide he averaged about one seizure per year and had no lasting side-effects of the medication.

You've said a couple times that you consider her seizures to be infrequent. They aren't. 3 weeks is too frequent for isolated grand mal seizures and would need medication. 3 weeks is *way* too frequent for clusters and *definitely* needs medication. 

You're already seeing changes in her that you suspect (probably correctly) are caused by brain damage from the seizures, but still you resist medication? Why chance fate and risk her life? There are no significant upsides to keeping her unmedicated."

dogs,fepuxh7,t1_fepcp5w,1579332195.0,"If your dog acts like an obnoxious, disruptive asshole the airline has every right to ask you to GTFO with it regardless of if it's a service dog or ESA. Bad behavior does not need to be tolerated."
dogs,fepttv6,t3_eqbpab,1579331062.0,"I would be willing to bet money that your dog's personality is changing as a direct result of her seizures, yes. Every seizure does damage and while not every individual seizure leaves *visible* damage, over time these may add up to what you describe and perhaps eventually worse. Epilepsy is often progressive which is why you've seen her seizures go from seemingly random to more regular.

She needs to be on medication, like, yesterday. I'm not really sure what gave you the impression that cluster seizures every 3 weeks is '*infrequent*' because it's really, really not. You do understand that cluster seizures can and do kill sometimes, right?"
dogs,feoef6z,t3_eq4r27,1579299053.0,"Could be any number of things - infection, dry eye, allergies, foreign object, etc.

Most of the options can be fixed or managed with eye drops.

I'm a groomer and have seen a fair number of shih tzus with gunky eyes and in many cases it's chronic dry eye according to the owners, which the breed seems particularly predisposed to. My own husky had this. Lifelong eyedrops manage it effectively."

dogs,fei5ye7,t1_fei0amg,1579131013.0,"If chemo is something you're genuinely interested in considering it's worth a conversation with the vet, either with the neurologist or with an oncologist, but they may require the MRI before starting any kind of chemo protocol.

That said, not all cancers respond favorably to chemotherapy. If the neurologist hasn't mentioned more aggressive treatment options like surgery or chemo they may not be realistic options for your dog's case."
