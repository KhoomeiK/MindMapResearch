interestingasfuck,ff42v3q,t1_ff3w46w,1579554343.0,"tl;dr I think it has to do with tongue posture and proper swallowing technique.

In [this video essay](https://youtu.be/zbzT00Cyq-g), the author shows photo examples of teeth and jawlines of isolated groups of people living on traditional native diets vs people living in societies that have adopted a modern lifestyle. Based on the evidence in these provided examples, researchers found that those living in _non-westernized_ societies have wider faces, stronger facial muscles, and straight teeth, while those living in _westernized_ societies more often than not have narrower faces (particularly in the lower jaw area), weaker facial muscles, and crooked teeth.  
The theory presented (starting @ 6:39) is that people living in non-westernized societies develop a swallowing technique from a young age which involves pressing the tongue to the roof of the mouth with enough force that it pushes the food to the back of the throat and down the esophagus. This widens the dental arch and allows teeth the space they need to grow in correctly. Those living in westernized societies often eat softer foods, which require little chewing, and a swallowing technique where the tongue doesn’t push against the roof of the mouth—instead, it sucks the soft food to the back of the throat. According to one researcher, this results in “reduced robustness, increased malocclusion, and increased tooth-crowding” in craniofacial development."

memes,fenyusb,t1_fentus0,1579292812.0,"That’s actually a really big misconception.  
Though I’m not sure of about common phonetic alphabets in other Chinese languages, I know that the /r/ sound is a phonic sound commonly found in Mandarin Chinese. Northern Chinese people especially are able to pronounce their “r”s exactly like native English speakers.  
Source: I’ve been teaching English to Chinese people for over two and a half years. 

I think there might be some confusion between the way natives from China typically speak English and the way natives from Japan typically speak English. [Here’s a video](https://youtu.be/F4MsJHn-lRA) that does a good job explaining why Japanese people tend to have a difficult time telling the difference between the /l/ sound and the /r/ sound in the English language."
