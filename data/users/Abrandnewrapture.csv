facepalm,fgejnm6,t1_fgddb38,1580701110.0,"you can't challenge people like this. they say that they believe this inane thing, and then the burden of proof lies with you. and then, because they've been indoctrinated with this ""us v them"", ""fake news"", ""the media only tells you what they want you to hear"" crap, there is literally no source or fact you can present against their belief, that they won't immediately dismiss with some ""well, that's biased. i have a friend who has a cousin who knows a guy..."" bullshit statement. It is absolutely infuriating, but that is where these people are. Challenging them only strengthens their resolve, and keeps them brainwashed."
