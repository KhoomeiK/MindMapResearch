Sure, maybe some of them. But a lot of them abuse their positions of power on a regular basis. What they think is right is not always what the public may think is right. They also are humans with emotions that can get carried away.  Do you know how many videos I've seen of multiple cops beating someone who's not resisting? Ive seen tons of videos of cops breaking the law. Never once have I seen a video of a cop stopping another cop from breaking the law or ""legally"" assaulting someone who didn't actually deserve it. The biggest problem is that when one cop knows another is dirty they won't turn them in. This in turn makes even the ""good ones"" dirty and an accomplice for doing nothing. So that means something like 99% of all cops are dirty and that 1% is constantly being watched by the others to weed them out and remove them from the force. Ask any cop. You dont rat out another cop if you want to stay on the force."
