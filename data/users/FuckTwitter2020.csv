facepalm,ff5gz9k,t1_ff5gg0x,1579592434.0,"Except that the fbi never admitted to what they did to MLK. No apologies to his family. And im not insinuating assassination, just bringing up the blackmail, wiretapping, harassment, etc. Would be nice if, since MLK is a person of such high regard to them, they issued some form of public apology for the way their ""previous administration"" handled their treatment of King."

facepalm,ff4pn4q,t1_ff4p41g,1579569414.0,"The FBI actively fought against and blackmailed MLK. Including bugging him and sending evidence of affairs to his wife. They also sent him a threatening letter that seemed to be encouraging him to commit suicide.   

People have also speculated that they had a hand in his assassination.

Im quoting u/michaelvinters 's response in this thread because he put it well, but in addition to all of that, the fbi never publicly acknowledged this nor did they issue an apology to his family. Its just kind of shitty of them to pretend like nothing ever happened and praise him like they were always on his side."
facepalm,ff4m9v3,t1_ff4kkli,1579567041.0,"Yup. Without ever acknowledging what they did to him (not insinuating they assassinated him, just the harrassment of his family, the letter telling him to kill himself, the wiretapping, the threats, and the surveillance) or even issuing a public apology to his family."
facepalm,ff4f4et,t1_ff4dyd6,1579562113.0,"Not saying they did, but they certainly harrassed him and his family even going as far as sending him a letter urging him to kill himself. This isnt disputable."
facepalm,ff48u8i,t1_ff48cii,1579558061.0,They never even acknowledged that they did anything wrong in the past. Imagine if Germany only thaught a white washed version of history in their schools.

I definitely want to expand her horizons, just know that movies like pulp ficion or reservoir dogs are not for her at this moment. This has nothing to do with anything other than what she has told me about what kind of movies she wants to watch.

Shes extremely empathetic. But her instincts and tastes are good, she knows whats cringey and corny. Im just letting her take her time and guiding her without being too forceful.

Your metric of how the economy is doing is based on the stock market which doesnt reflect the state of being of the average American.

All we are talking about here is bringing the US up to the standard of the rest of the developed world in terms of healthcare. Sander's philosophy is more in line with Scandinavian countries than anything else and go ahead, ask anyone there about how their quality of life is. Second, you think that those tax cuts are doing anything other than lining the pockets of CEOs and special interest groups? Thats funny because average American wages have been stagnant since the late 70s. In fact the only thing thats on the rise is the cost of college and medical debt. If that money was actually going into creating jobs and 'trickling down' to the middle class, we wouldnt see income and wealth inequality being at its heighest. But it is, because corporations use loopholes, tax havens, and lobbying to manipulate the system. No one is arguing for communism, just for equality in terms of how the existing rules apply to everyone. How about Amazon pays more than 0 dollars in federal taxes? Is that too much to ask for, or is the most powerful country in the history of the world simply unable to give an inch of support to its working class despite having seemingly unlimited funds for military expansion?"
