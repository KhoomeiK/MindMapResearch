ToyCollectors,ffb3421,t3_ec4u27,1579750568.0,"For things like this with an establishe market, you really don't need (or even want) an appraiser.  You can search eBay for ""sold"" items only - just put in exactly what you have and see what they're actually selling for.  Or hell, put up a few pictures and I'll give you a hand.

Be aware, because they're most people's go-to idea of a ""collectible"" toy and EVERYBODY had them, the SW market is kinda flooded.  Not that you can't get very very good money especially for sealed or rare items, but they don't always bring the sky-high prices people assume they will.  If you got any more obscure toy lines with that collection, that could be real interesting too."

Addons4Kodi,fezvbyv,t3_eqyiqs,1579462131.0,"I agree with everybody else saying to hold off on any subscriptions until you are more familiar with this stuff.  Sounds like you have the basics under control, but here's my newbie advice:

1. Make sure you have the latest version of Kodi and your Firestick software installed.  Older Firesticks can run a bit slow with big files.  

2. Make sure you have the latest recommeded addons installed.  Right now that's The Crew and/or Venom, but these things come and go constantly so check in every couple months at least.  You don't need more than one or two at a time, uninstall any old ones.  

3. Also be sure that when you're installing things, you follow the direct links (usually github) in the sticky, and for Kodi its actual website.  Don't get suckered into installing packages by ""Firesticktricks"" or any of the other things that come up when you Google for help.

 &nbsp;

That should get you mostly sorted.  HOWEVER - in the last few months it's gotten a lot harder to find working, reliable free links.  You can do it, but it can take trial, error, and frustration.  So if you want:

4. You can look into a Real Debrid account.  This will work within Seren/Crew/whatever to give you access to torrent and premium links, so it's much easier to get a working high-quality version.  It runs about 18 bucks for 6 months, and imo is worth it.  There are guides on how to set that up if you go that route."
Addons4Kodi,fespet7,t3_eqggk8,1579367616.0,"The Crew has been solid with live feeds for a few months now.  Or if you prefer, ripple.is has been a gold standard too.  Depending on what device you're using, any browser addon should let you stream and fullscreen it to your tv."
movies,fesfoxw,t1_fes05dn,1579364678.0,"Almost not at all.  Most Americans would probably not be a lot further than ""...Sure, I think I've seen that Viking cartoon guy somewhere.  Oh, he's got a name?""  For whatever reason, they're just not characters that were ever promoted over here.  I'm not sure why; aside from not having familiarity with Gauls the style of humor isn't that different.

Same with Tintin, but even less known.  Spielberg is a big fan, but if his name wasn't attached to that movie nobody would have gone.  That movie didn't make very much in the US even with him.  The perception here seemed to be that Tintin is a very dated, old-fashioned cartoon character recognizable because they USED to be popular, rather than actually still being popular (like, say, Popeye or Archie in the US).  ""A boy and his dog travel the world meeting steamer captains and opera singers"" is just not a draw in 2020 without a historical connection to the character."

We live pretty successfully - nice house on a big property, two decent vehicles, a small boat, big tv, reasonable travel and recreation.

AskReddit,febtgmr,t1_fe82wue,1578962518.0,"Access is very, very restricted.  Partially because dumbasses would get bitten by golden lanceheads and die, partially because golden lanceheads are endemic (found only on this one little island) so the species is protected from said dumbasses."
ToyID,febt0cb,t1_fe9p64a,1578962325.0,"No shit!  That's definitely him.  Or maybe some bootleg as there are no stamps at all.  

But still, great find.  Thanks man, much appreciated."
ToyID,fdzv4g7,t3_e8nc03,1578796519.0,"All the major brands like Bandai, Bullmark, or Popy would have some kind of mark on the feet.  Something about it suggests it's a little more modern than when many of those vinyl kaiju were made.  

There's a ""Knockoff Collectors"" Facebook page you could try asking.  It may be such a random, obscure no-name toy there's no real provenance for it though.  Worst case, list in on eBay with the right keywords and if anybody in the world knows what it is, you can bet they'll come out of the woodwork and bid on it."
Addons4Kodi,fdss4l2,t3_emvlgh,1578707232.0,"So to be clear - the solution is just to sit tight and wait for addon developers (like those for Venom, The Crew, Seren, etc.) to make the necessary updates?

Not bitching, just clarifying.  We appreciate all the hard work you guys put in."

movies,fdp6njp,t1_fdp2qcp,1578621242.0,"And this is the rare case where the studio may be right about it.  There are some intrinsic differences from the classical studio system, in that these are really not stand-alone films, closer to chapters in an ongoing story, all overseen by Kevin Feige.  It makes sense that they want to maintain a consistent tone, scope, plot, etc.  And every director involved knows from day one that will be the case.

Much as I'm opposed to studio interference and would have liked to see, say, an Edgar Wright *Ant-Man*, that's just not the system at play here.  I think it's very fair for them to say ""look, we like your work a lot but it's just not going to be a good fit within the scope of this particular series.""  It's hard to argue with success, especially for the single most successful film franchise of all time."

MMA,fdmbtvc,t3_em04ys,1578544991.0,"Since literally UFC 1.  MMA (or really, no-holds-barred or full-contact fighting as it was mostly called) was more of a fringe spectacle than even a sport at the time.  It really didn't have a huge influence right away, most people didn't even know it existed.  McDojos nationwide were still full of karate purists insisting you could rip somebody's brain out through their eyesocket.  

&nbsp;

It was really hard to follow, too.  For a long time it was not available even on PPV, you had to wander store to store hoping to stumble onto used VHS copies.  Later there was tape trading - the internet was far enough along to chatrooms and webrings, but not host or share large video files.  So you'd mail pirated VHS copies back and forth.   Sometimes it worked, more often that not I got nothing in return.  

&nbsp;

The Zuffa era around the early 2000s is where things started to develop into an actual sport/scene.  This was the era of Pride vs. UFC.  Of the unbearable Sherdog forum and its more hilarious spinoffs.  Of online file sharing (albeit via dial-up).  Of TMA gyms starting to offer ground techniques, though as often as not it was techniques they'd picked up from an Inside Kung Fu article and you'd still get hoodoo about joint locks and pressure points.  I can't emphasize enough that this was still an era where it was NOT a respected sport or in most people's sphere of awareness at all.  At one point a local bar advertised they were showing I think UFC 48, and we had to ask them to turn it on a single screen instead of the football rerun they were playing. This was a time when the forums would freak the fuck out when Bas Rutten showed up in the background of King of Queens for 12 seconds.  Bigger than boxing!

&nbsp;

Then came the TUF and Chuck Liddell era, and over a couple years that shit exploded.  It was a bit of a bubble, but that's when it hit pop consciousness.  Major sponsorships, real commercials, fighters becoming stars, MMA on real television, the rise and fall of various organizations, terrible sports movies, every school becoming BJJ/MMA instead of karate.  Instead of asking bars to turn the fight on, it was cover charges and waiting for a seat.  Or waiting til the next day for somebody to upload a torrent, but it might take you 24 hours to download a whole event.  Hey, those things were over a gig each!

&nbsp;

Most of you were probably along for the ride at least from there to where we are now.  I don't know if it's better or worse, just different.  I don't think anything will ever be as exciting as Pride Final Conflict 2003, but then again we don't have to wait three months between events.  Cards aren't as stacked as they were and I don't have an encyclopedic knowledge of everybody active, but that'll happen with near-weekly cards and a roster of 600 fighters in UFC alone.  The Japanese MMA scene is in bad shape, but Russia and Europe are booming.  There are... er, *ways* to watch every PPV event in real time.  Maybe my only real regret is the loss of... community I guess, being part of such a small but passionate group obsessing over such a fringe underground sport.  Some of that is just the elitism of your favorite band getting too big, but early MMA really felt like an exclusive, cerebral corner of the sports world.  Now it's dominated by the same ass-slapping backward-hat gym-bro chuds that turned me off of every other major sport.  

&nbsp;

That's the price of growth I guess though, they wanted to be a recognized sport and are.  I'm very, very curious to see where it'll be in another 10-20 years, whether they keep growing and expanding or if public interest wanes and it drops back into the fringes.  If nothing else, I'll fire up Limewire and my DC++ hub and see you guys there."
