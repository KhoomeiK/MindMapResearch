If the first thing that comes to mind is the color of his skin, and you say that out loud, that's doubly offensive.

If you don't even recognize that something is doubly offensive, that's triply offensive.   

Come on /u/tulsigabbard, you're better than that.   Let's not color code candidates.  You're not going on stage in the debate against black, yellow, red, green, and tooti-fruity.  You're not running against the Republican orange man.

Get color out of your head.

Edit:  Cue the down-votes by everyone who just doesn't get it, and who think it's just fine to bring skin color into politics when you don't like the guy.  There are so many words to use for Trump, like ""Twitter"", ""Unpredictable"", ""Incompetent"", ""Powerful"", ""Hated"", ""Loved"", ""Irrational"",...   To jump to skin color - TOTALLY inappropriate, not even if you dislike the guy. ESPECIALLY if you dislike the guy.  No, it is not OK."
