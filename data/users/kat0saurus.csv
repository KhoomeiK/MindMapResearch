aww,ffwv1x3,t1_ffvr1pt,1580311666.0,Lol my other kitten chewed on another pair! Thankfully she hasn't had the urge... yet :)
halifax,ffwmnep,t1_ffrwenk,1580305653.0,"So, I was just in a taxi with a CRTC commissioner (I am in Ottawa for work and we split a cab). I told her about this and her eyes got big and she said to definitely report this!"

CanadaPublicServants,ffvddql,t3_eve7ro,1580261478.0,I think if you worked under 5 years (or something of the sort) you're not eligable for a pension so they cash it out... not 100% sure though. Just call the pension center.

PersonalFinanceCanada,ffuy32y,t1_ffunnxm,1580251540.0,"Hello fellow PS! 

The only downside to a DB pension plan is that if the company goes belly up, say bye to your pension. Obviously this is far less likely to happen with the Canadian Government, but possible with smaller companies."

CanadaPublicServants,ffumvbo,t3_evanl1,1580245309.0,Contact AAACT! My old director is visually impaired and they helped him get access to software and hardware to help him work! They are a great resource for anyone needing an accommodation for a disability :)
CanadaPublicServants,ffumoeg,t3_evaph7,1580245199.0,"I mean, I understand why you feel the way you do, but maybe the other person caught on faster, or needed less direction, showed more initiative... could have been anything. Don't beat yourself up over this! Something else will come along."
halifax,ffsegcr,t3_euz87v,1580179727.0,"My favourite local brewery is nine locks! Their IPA or DIPA are killer :) enVie is a vegan restaurant, although I never ate there I've heard good things.  If you're there until monday, the Lower Deck on the waterfront is a really fun place to be sunday nights! I'm a little out of the loop, as I live in Dartmouth, so others will probably have better suggestions than me! But nine locks is amazing."
