poker,ffgxp3h,t3_etidsy,1579917734.0,"Analyze your own play.  Part of the 'long game' of poker is knowing how to fix your own mistakes.

1. Are you still playing 'your game' after being up during a session?  Sometimes players start playing more hands, playing looser, attempting more bluffs, and that contributes to later losses.
2. Are players adjusting to you after you win?  Maybe your good play is forcing the game to become tighter over time, or more serious, with more players playing good focused game plans.
3. Are you tired?  Maybe you need to set a watch, and walk away after six hours, no matter what.  Then try to improve your focus over time, including improving your physical fitness.  

Quick fixes:  Set a stopping point for yourself, no matter what.  If you are playing 1/2 or 1/3, for example, you walk whenever you a) hit 6 hours of play, b) you win $1000 (and then play for two rounds more for etiquette's sake if you hit a big win) or c) if you lose $300 from your high."

legaladvice,ffgvimp,t3_etgqda,1579916123.0,"Just another recommendation to speak with an attorney, starting with a real estate attorney.  You need to fix this, as soon as possible.  The law regarding rentals is complex, especially in California.  Since 10 years have passed, you have already been lucky that you haven't been sued by a tenant.

1. You should not be paying taxes on this income, if you aren't receiving the income.  One possible outcome might be you re-filing your tax returns, and collecting refunds based on the updated amounts.  The IRS will then look at your Mom and say ""OK, pay up!""
2. If the houses are paid for, and in your name, then those taxes might help you establish ownership.  So you could sell the houses without Mom's consent, *and keep the cash*.  Alternatively, you might end up with your attorney writing a letter to all the tenants (or the property management company) informing them that the checks should go to you now.
3. As I mentioned before, since your name is on the homes, you are at risk, each and every day, for the countless problems involved with being a landlord.  You could get sued for violation ranging from failure to repair the unit, to the neighbor's complaints about the behavior of 'your' tenants.

No.  Prozac has known side effects.  If put in the water in high enough quantity to be effective, it is known that it would be harmful to others.  Fluoride does not have enough downside to meet this criteria.

And I would recommend Buspirone for anxiety.  Prozac is usually prescribed for depression.

> I am resistant to using studies put forth by the Dental Establishment, and prefer more independent and unbiased research,

Right.  This is a cognitive bias, and it leads to making bad conclusions based on limited information.  You are rejecting the most cited, most researched, and most rigorously researched body of knowledge, in favor of lines of exploration that are newer, less researched, more preliminary, or make contradictory claims without the same level of proof.

It's time for the Carl Sagan quote:  ""Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof.""

Again, your disregard for the standard, which became the standard because of the longest and most complete record of research, is the reason that I made the warning about unfalsifiable premise fallacy to begin with.

The statement that I quoted here appears to mean ""I reject the wide body of research that doesn't support my viewpoint, though I may consider the marginal research that does support my viewpoint"".

Fluorine has appeared in water supplies, naturally, since antiquity.  The reason it is added to water in certain places is because of the scientific observation of lower tooth decay where the water contained more fluoride.  And further scientific observation enabled us to determine levels that would minimize fluoridosis in teeth.

As I said in our other comment thread - you found potential issues in the two studies that I cited.  Neither were issues that would reject the premise of the study.  And you still have 9,999 other studies to discredit more fully before you deny this widely-researched conclusion.

Fluoride in water is helpful.  The vast majority of research is supportive of that claim.  The claims that normal amounts of fluoride are unsafe require the rejection of legitimate literature, without opposing literature of similar quality and scope."
