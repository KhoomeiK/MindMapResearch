However, the actual disposable income may be higher in Germany depending on your circumstances since a lot of costs such as healthcare, student loan debt, transportation (Using PT isntead), consumer protection, etc will have you holding onto more money. Through my world travels, I found this was the reason that the young adults of the EU and commonwealth countries (Read AUS, CAN) tend to be more well travelled than people from the US, simply being the middle class can gather more disposable income and can be more reliant on social safety nets allowing them to spend on travel rather than save in case of disaster.

If you aren't blinking, your tear film (the thin liquid over your eyes) quickly starts to evaporate, and you suddenly start to feel intense pain. This is exacerbated by ambient light and sunshine.

A major issue with Swiss style direct democracy is that it becomes exponentially more difficult for larger countries to carry out, both in demographic variance and geographical size (variance in industry, etc).

nextfuckinglevel,fdpvuyo,t1_fdpou2l,1578642632.0,"It's not just that. Akkido is good self defence for a certain environment. It's especially good if your opponent is armed, and key on relying that you may be surrounded by armed an armed ally to finish off the attack. This was good in a time of organised melee engagement. Without it, there's only so much use since it doesn't teach much technique beyond the disarmament and grounding of an opponent.

This is separated by a lot of grounding martial arts that were developed to ground and eliminate a grounded opponent, such as judo or jiu jitsu.

Chokes, holds, general submissions and hard strikes in martial arts were originally designed to incapacitate or kill an opponent, which is what lends their weight to submission in sports like mma.

Edit: I think one of the best examples of this is tae kwon do, where old school teachers of the art emphasise the advantage of incredibly powerful kicks to the head to completely incapacitate or kill. In modern competition this is too risky for defence and the opponents well being, so the new age of tae kwon do emphasises technique based on competition point scoring."
nextfuckinglevel,fdpvoqm,t1_fdpnhax,1578642423.0,"Akido is incredibly legitimate if your opponent happens to be wielding a sword or an untrained fighter charging at you. But not so much otherwise. It was developed for a certain time and discipline which made it a functional martial art.

However, the dynamic and it's need has been altered. And there are better martial arts to pursue for self defence.

At the end of the day, it's presumption is that somebody around you will be armed  (as in a melee) to finish off the opponent."

Cats can change their disposition pretty easily and move to reject the other cat from their area. It's usually because the cat doesn't see the kitten as a threat rather than accepting it as a part of the household. It might be not evident now, but as the kitten grows, your other cat may start to become increasingly hostile as it becomes bigger and more of a threat."

We'd probably need to legitimately (and very unpopullarly) look towards permanently moving high risk towns out of the area. And move towards massively expanding our professional firefighting capabilities. If we are relying on volunteers for half the year, at what point do we realise that people can't volunteer that long?

Fires also aren't constrained by state borders. So should efforts and funding be consolidated into a federal task force responsible for both preventative and reactive action across the nation? Allocating resources across state lines where appropriate? 

These aren't questions that have easy answers. But ones that I don't see politicians on either side asking. We're very much focused on the here and now (which is important as hell), but not enough asking on how we sustain this going forward. Quite frankly I don't think the current government is speaking about it because they don't want to admit that this isn't a once off and there needs to be major federal organisational and taxation changes to combat it."

There are also immigration issues I've noticed before. While the US passport is strong on what countries you can enter, it's actually surprisingly weak on immigration agreements.

Games,fdi58es,t1_fdi23w1,1578435952.0,">I’d like to understand how a union would help software developers make more money.

You only have to look at literally any other union that exists to answer this question. Plus it's also that a union works for rights beyond just pay. It just so happens the discussion we're having is surrounding over time.

Given a standard full-time work week of 40 hours, any hours above that would have to be paid at 1.5x. As many software developers, in video games and outside of video games, work well beyond 40 hours a week. There would be a definitive increase to pay across the board. Or alternatively, companies would adapt their working policies to ensure that they are not pressuring, forcing or even allowing workers to work beyond those 40 hours a week if it is affecting their bottom line due to OT pay.

The bottom line is that collective bargaining is far stronger than individual bargaining. Your individual bargaining has the ability to adjust certain aspects of your individual position. Collective bargaining has the ability to change the position of the entire industry. There are benefits to both, but a union can also strengthen your individual position, while your individual bargaining can not strengthen your industry's position.

Examples of this include:

- Payment for overtime
- Unfair dismissal protection (Boss's wife doesn't like you but you're a good worker? Can't fire you for no reason)
- Injury Compensation
- Redundancy Pay
- Working hour caps
- Mandated break times
- Discrimination protection
- Optional negotiation/disciplinary representation
- Working environment and condition protection (Temperature levels, OSHA furniture, etc)
- Publically accessible salary ranges (For your own negotiations)

And basically every workers right you can think of in the last 100 years."

However, if you're running a more advanced security function in your organization then you absolutely should adapt to the Iranian threat. This is a change in the threat landscape and so your operation should take that into account.

Firstly by deciding if you're an at-risk target. Are you critical infrastructure? Do you have contracts to defence and/or to defence contractors? Do you operate a physical location in the middle east? Has your CEO publically condemned Iran on social media?

Have your intelligence team mark a higher priority to intelligence surrounding Iranian ATP groups. If you haven't already, take known TTPs and IOCs of Iranian ATPs and implement detections for them, otherwise adjust scoring on Iranian TTPs to alert more prominently. Conduct threat hunting across your organisation for those TTPs & IOCs to detect for any already established footholds. Is there any business impact to also geoblocking Iran?

Make sure you have contacts and escalation procedures established for combatting a potential state actor threat (Do you have a line into intelligence agencies? Discuss with them whether to take actions against threats immediately or to conduct surveillance first).
