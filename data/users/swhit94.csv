AskReddit,fehkvde,t1_fehkndu,1579118605.0,"Facing that situation isn't the hard part. The hard part is when something does happen, and you blame yourself for every little thing that you could have done and didn't. a lot of women fail to report sexual assaults because they feel guilty for the lack of action that they took, because they brushed it off as being paranoid and unnecessary. It's a mind game, that's the hard part."
AskReddit,fehk4c8,t1_fehjvls,1579118175.0,"For women it's a little different, because we aren't as capable of defending ourselves, so there tends to be more fear around it. But feeling violated is pretty much universal, and it's grotesque."
Advice,fehjtcr,t3_ep6o50,1579118000.0,I think the act of teachers discussing faults of the school/school system/students could potentially land them in hot water. That may be part of the reason you're struggling to get any response.

Hawaii ain't cheap, there's not a very high probability you'll be able to cover all needed costs with that pay (if you include car, insurance, medical insurance, bills, and/or credit card payments). I was paying $250 for rent, $250 for car, and $75 for phone, $200 for food, and $200 in debt payments. Almost a grand right there, not a whole lot of wiggle room left. And I was living with my parents through that and still struggled."

Advice,fe6f9f7,t1_fe6errz,1578889146.0,"Aw, thank you! My stomach is permanently destroyed from the ordeal, but it's nice to have finally caught a break. Also, I take lamotrigine for bipolar, but it's given for epilepsy and migraines as well. It's a daily medication, it might be worth asking your doctor about. I'm sure it's contributed to my health as well. Epilepsy medicine in general *I think* can help depending on the circumstance. The piercing gave me a week long migraine and probably a month later my boyfriend goes, ""uhh, when was your last migraine?"" I was like ""OH! Holy shit! I'm saved!"" ü§£"

They would come and go but I was definitely experiencing more than 20 a month. I got a daith piercing and the mini-migraine that I could always feel at the back of my head finally went away. That combined with an immitrex prescription, my migraines are like a 4 now and I get probably 5-8 a month now."
AskReddit,fe3i9ue,t3_enplhd,1578849492.0,"I don't think it's about waiting the appropriate time, I think it's about taking the appropriate precautions. both names on lease, don't live anywhere you wouldn't be able to afford to pay for by yourself, don't overextend your personal budgets, keep your finances separate, etc. If your SO questions your motives for maintaining independence, screw them you're protecting the both of you. My ex screwed me over on a lease and now I have a bill I damn well can't pay. I refused to let my current boyfriend take my income into consideration for expenses when we moved in together. He had to be able to pay everything (that he needs) himself. I've had a really hard time finding a job since we moved, if we hadn't set it up that way we'd be fucked."

bipolar,fdyz52l,t1_fdyyp86,1578785038.0,It's magic. My kitty needed some eyedrops yesterday and my vet was running low on stock forcing them to sell it at $80. They were kind enough to refer us to a pharmacy (the human medication was the same as what my kitty needed) where the cost was $45. Got it for $10. Was a big relief after the $120 vet visit.
bipolar,fdyxqmy,t1_fdyww86,1578784644.0,"My situation is a little tricky, I can't explain it as well as I'd like because the app is new to me. I have insurance in California (some top-tier shit even though the quality of care is still crap), my meds were reasonable. I recently moved to an area where there are no physicians or pharmacies that accept my insurance, so I have to pay out-of-coverage costs. My prescriptions would normally cost me $110, comes out to $30 with the app out of network. My boyfriend mentioned the app before I almost shelled out the $110, and the pharmacist overheard. They aren't really allowed to recommend the app but when he heard it mentioned he practically pushed me out of line so I could pull it up and save away."
