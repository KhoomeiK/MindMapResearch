technicallythetruth,fgczo83,t1_fgclr9b,1580677656.0,"I'm not understanding the first sentence as I'm not equating them to anything.  

It's taken my husband and me years to learn that, if we need something, we need to tell each other.  If we're too upset to say it, we need to walk away until we can talk.  Then we say as concisely as possible why we're upset.  The other person paraphrases and acknowledges the hurt.  Then we solution how to avoid the situation in the future.

Notice I didn't say ""accept blame"" anywhere in there.  Because more than half of the time it was some dumb verbal accidents that got us to the uncomfortable place.  So maybe we're sorry for how it came out, or for the tone, or how it was taken in the context of the conversation.  But that doesn't mean the message we were trying to give is invalidated.  I only say this because it amazes me when other people insists SOMEONE has to be wrong.  (no, no they don't)

I used to be one of those whiney, petulant girls who needed flowers and groveling to get over things.  It's because I used to be with guys who just wanted everything to be easy, so they'd do or say whatever they needed to bandaid the situation instead of working on the relationship as a whole.  That's what I took from op's post.

BlackPeopleTwitter,fg6vlf6,t1_fg6uvp9,1580577900.0,Monogamy means the state of having only one partner or mate at a time.  How are you defining it?
BlackPeopleTwitter,fg6vdx2,t1_fg6u4rl,1580577760.0,"The difference is that, as far as I know, not one culture has the expectation that friends are monogamous and not have other friends.  Also, there aren't any friendship ceremonies celebrating monogamy.

It turns into abuse when one person feels they have to abide by the other person's rules or the relationship will end, even if they don't agree to it.  Both parties need the ability to set healthy boundaries.  I haven't seen that in my experience with open relationships.  I've seen one strong, dominent one who does what they want and the other just sort of goes along but it's obvious they're unhappy.  Is that everyone?  Of course not.  That's my limited (4-5 couples) worth of knowledge.

I'm not understanding the second part of your question.  I'm going to take my best stab at answering, but correct me if I've interpretted wrong.  People change and grow during relationships.  Sometimes not at the same pace or area.  If this happens, open communication is the key.  The person making the request needs to decide if their desires are deal breakers or not.  If someone suddenly discovers (or admits) that they're poly, they need to come to grips with the fact the other person isn't and simply can't be.  That will end the relationship.  Are they prepared for that?  Because for some, even the asking will feel like a betrayal.  Personally, I think if someone if going to jump into something that huge, a therapist should be involved to mediate.  Otherwise, one or both people could be really hurt for a long time.

Now that I'm typing this, I can clarify that the folks I know (including my son and his GF) do not have what I would call an open and trusting communication style.  One person bascially says something like they're daring the other do something about it.  The other person tries to fix everything and appears submissive in doing this.  I don't see honest communication and trust between the couple.  That's probably my basis for primarily seeing the potential for abuse."

BlackPeopleTwitter,fg6t2y5,t1_fg6riak,1580576238.0,"The difference is this:  If you're in a friendship where the person expects you to not have any other friends, that's controlling and strange and you really need to consider this before you enter.  Otherwise, it's abusive.

If you enter a romantic relationship where the other person expects you not to be in a romantic relationship with other people, that's a healthy expectation and if that's not your thing, you need to say that upfront or risk being the abusive one.

Every person I know in an ""open relationship"" has one person who is swinging while the other one sits and pines for the open one.  That's probably not everyone's experience, but that's what I've seen."

Ignoring her at that size was impossible.  So I instead put her on her lead and tied her to a door knob.  I would then walk up to her and, if she jumped, just ignore her and turn to walk the other way.  I kept doing it until she got the idea that *not* jumping got me closer.  Within an hour she wasn't jumping on me anymore.  I then instructed my son to do the same thing while I held the lead.  Finally, I took her to a park and had my son's friends do the same thing (where it was loud and noisy and she was excited).  She'd bounce everywhere, but when someone approached her, she sat down.

Also, because she was a lab, we taught her to ""get your squeak!"" whenever someone came over.  She'd have all of this energy and needed to do *something*.  Getting her favorite toy and chewing it allowed the grown ups to talk.  Got to the point that if someone came to the door, she'd get her toy and bark while it was in her mouth.

JobProfiles,ffmhsqq,t1_ffcavaf,1580054835.0,"> Questions: - how is ux in terms of life-work balance? Would it be possible to fit in side gigs or is it all consuming? - is it possible to freelance/be location independent in ux careers?

UX, as far as I know, can be what you want it to be.  There are so many temp and freelance gigs that you can do one, take some time, then do another.  Lots of companies are open to flex hours and work from home.  My current role lets me come in when I want and I can work from home 2 days scheduled a week if needed.  I will say that, if you can be face to face for meetings, do it.  Every time.  Since so much of UX is reading between the lines, you need that body language as a clue.  An example I like to give is when I met with a dealership lead with my boss-who did NOT think I could help the team and said this often.  He was complaining about a site not working, so we asked him to show us.  He started moving his mouse, clicked, swore, then went back and clicked something else.  I stopped him and asked my boss, ""did you see that?""  She didn't so I asked him, ""why did you click the wrong thing?""  Turns out, there used to be more space between the buttons, but they redid the site and doubled the buttons but made them smaller.  He said he always clicked the wrong one first.  Well, if he's doing it, statistically so are a lot of our other users.  I wouldn't have known that from a phone call.

> My relevant background is Anthropology/Social research/customer service. I'm also a fixer and a planner. Looking to transition into something IT related. I feel very drawn to learning UX (which I'll probably do anyway for fun) but I'm being held back by above questions and wondering what kind of life choices are compatible with it and where it leaves you mental-health wise.

I say go for it!  Your background gives you a leg up on most people just starting out.  I chose this field because I was a single mom and wanted the freedom to work from home when needed.  I've had that.  I also have the ability to go to my users' environments at during projects.  That really helps to break up the office monotony because I'm in a different place with different people learning new things.  One day, it's an engineering work station surrounded by torn-down cars; next it's a plant floor.  

I will never work for a ""butt in chair"" place again.  That's a micro-managing situation that actually harms the company, imo.  I do feel you need to interact with other UX folks in your group for validation and learning.  I also feel you need to be by your customer or user as much as possible.  

Mental health wise?  It's very dependent on your company.  When I was a contractor at GM, I loved it.  I was helping someone every day.  I was creating and learning and growing and it was great.  I was at a few different place before I came back to GM as an employee.  It was the worst decision I ever made.  They didn't understand nor wanted UX.  I stuck with it for six years because I kept trying to force a fit.  It got so bad that I got really sick and had to quit.  That's on me.  I should have left year one.  I've only been two weeks at my new job and the atmosphere is so very different that I want to cry.  

My best advice is always to try to integrate UX into your current role to not only learn, but to see how much you like it.  Then you'll have something on your resume if you decide to leave.  If your role doesn't allow that, then volunteer or freelance in your free time.  There are webinars and classes online as well as decent audio books.  All of these can be done most anywhere and at most any desk job.  Learn the lingo.  Look at resumes and portfolios and learn what they've learned.  Pattern you life after the best resumes and then make your own.  

Listen, I'm not super successful.  But I love what I do and am so happy when I can do it because when I do it right, everyone around me is happy.  But, like most everyone I know in my field, I suffer from imposter syndrome.  I mean, if all I want to do in life is make things better and they'll actually PAY me to do that?  OMG, they must think I'm something I'm not!  If I were good at it, it would hurt, right?

No.  You've got this.  Go do it and be happy.

JobProfiles,fdnhbgj,t1_fdncv97,1578585805.0,"> What 4 year degrees do you mostly see? Are there certifications or professional associations?

There are degree programs in UX, as well as certifications (if you already have a degree in a different field, those help you appear ""bonafide"").  Human Machine Interaction is a common UX degree, as well as Information Architecture (content curation, if you will).  Mostly, I see folks with coding or design degrees and then an advanced degree in HMI.  Your degree path would naturally fit into this career and I could see you really enjoying it.  I began as a military journalist, then got into coding and server administration (after doing some light marketing).  I sort of fell into the job as a contractor to automotive as a webmaster.  I noticed all of the sites I was maintaining had absolutely no consistency so I put them all into a single template.  I realized how much that helped the users as well as the company and I just started reading.

> Are you aware if there's much demand for UX professionals in the public/nonprofit sectors? That's what I'd be interested in, but I just don't know if those sectors hire UX folks very often (they should).

All areas hire UX these days.  But beware the start up or company that wants a team of one because ""they know how important it is"".  My experience with that, both profit and non-profit, is they've no clue what they want and are just checking a box.  Every time I've done that, I've been beaten down by the IT Manager eventually, to the point that I'm turned into a BA more than a UX person.  You'll need to be strong and confident to assert the UX career in this setting.  I'm over that bullsh*t.  Jared Spool once told me (google him; he's brilliant) that you should never work for a company that wants you to convince them they need UX.  They already know they need it and it will save them money.  They just want your to put your neck on the line instead of them.  

> How would you say you build rapport with your gazillion stakeholders?

I'm maybe the wrong person to ask this, as I suck at politics.  I go in with science and eagerness.  I listen and reflective listen and then demonstrate my output based on that.  I give them figures showing how much we can save or make by utilizing different techniques.  I quote laws and statistics so they see how much it would damage us if we don't utilize UX.  I prioritize fixes with severity levels so they have a choice of doing all, or just the ones that will profoundly negatively impact the project at launch (example:  A shopping cart that doesn't refresh or give a thank you after submitting payment--you absolutely can't launch with that).  I reach out to users or instructors on my own and get some idea of what issues currently exist so I'm prepared at meetings when stakeholders begin telling me what their pain points are.  (BTW, instructors of the current tool are *ridiculously* helpful as they will tell you the work arounds in place for the broken items.) I do all of these things, yet at my last job, none of it mattered.  They only wanted ""pretty"".  And the role before that turned dark as soon as they switched me to an IT manager.

And, yes, I sound bitter, but what I am is weary.  It's my job to communicate and somehow I kept failing.  And then some young guy saunters in with the vaguest notion of UX, and they began calling him an ""expert"".  The reality is/was, that guy was a corporate politician and I am not.  He gave them ""pretty"" and not much more.  I'm simply not wired to half ass UX like that.  Good on him for fulfilling his ambition.  I'm starting a new job Monday where they have a good corporate reputation for embracing usability.

> Any other thoughts on transitioning from a different career into UX?

Read all you can.  Start transitioning your current role first.  Not only will that tell you if you have a taste for it, but it's a resume fluffer.  Join all the meet ups you can find and attend the free seminars.  Networking is VERY important.  Being a team of one, I've relied on my outside UXers to provide feedback on my work.  It really helps when you feel like you've lost your mind by blocking a launch because of a font color (which was 25:1 where 100:1 is black text on white background and minimum viable readability is 40:1, but the developer thought it looked better so we're just going to leave it that way).

There are a frillion places to contract for individual projects (paid), as well as sites that will pair you with non-profits that need volunteers to help with their site (unpaid).  These are excellent ways to get your feet wet and learn.  When you're just starting out and MUST be paid, find something that combines your current skill set with UX and grow the role.  That's what I did.  Webmaster to UX designer.  Systems Analyst to UX Analyst.  UX Developer to UX Researcher to my last job as UX Lead.  Now I'm considered ""full stack UX"", which is a product designer.

JobProfiles,fdl9bws,t1_fdkon9a,1578519246.0,"> • Typically you would be part of a team working on a particular feature or product and continually improving the journey, identifying the pain point and improving them? Or is that prior to engaging your expertise?


For the past 15 years, I've been incorporated into IT groups, but not really ""part of the team"" as they've all been developers and have no clue what I do.  I try to educate, but it's been difficult because I don't get a lot of management buy in for that (my experience with most IT managers is that they don't give a damn about the users and they feel the know what's best, unfortunately).  

Normal thing is that there is a project somewhere within the corporation or larger group and I would get pulled into it with my manager's knowledge.  I'm part of that project team and work extremely closely with the Business Analyst.  Sometimes, I have one-off where they want me to evaluate an existing app to determine if it needs to be replaced or just redesigned on the front.  I like to have a bunch of those in my queue throughout the year for the downtimes.  Most times, it's a full-on application/site creation or a complete overhaul of an existing one.  The business typically comes up with their pain points upfront, and then I stomp all over them and show what the actual issues are.  I put it this way because I'm soooo sick of Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) who haven't touched the tool in ten years trying to tell me what the current user hates about it.  They'll give me some big list about back-end security yet when I talk to the user, they tell me the font is too small to read.

> • what software application do you use to create wireframes?, if any. What are the key software packages in the industry that make you competitive?

I've used so many different software packages.  It's really at the whim of my employer.  This last year, I finally got a Mac at work so I could use Sketch.  Before that, I used Axure (my personal favorite), Balsamiq, Photoshop, Illustrator and even Visio (hell, powerpoint, in a pinch--it's just boxes and lines).  I have XD, but it was never given an official nod from corporate so I never got around to learning it.  My new role will have me using Invision and Axure, but they said they'd buy me whatever I wanted to be productive.  IMO, you want a tool that's easy and fast, but can be exported for the the BA and developers so there's no replication of work.  If you can come up with a pixel perfect image that will export as a stylesheet and code, you will be thanked with baked goods by the coders (and I loves me some donuts).  It's also good to have something that your manager can slap into a powerpoint at a moment's notice.  My images are a hella lot more impressive than some code for that.

> • I assume, you have brand guidelines to follow. How can that impact your creativity?

Sometimes yes; sometimes no.  As stated, I don't care too terribly much about ""pretty"".  At GM, I helped create templates from the branding guidelines to help the developers create a consistent look and feel for the users.  Some folks felt constrained by this, but at the end of the day, the company makes money when the user knows exactly how things will act and where to find what they want.  When I worked for the cancer hospital, we had the MOST OFFENSIVE COLOR PALETTE ^TM you have ever seen.  It wasn't difficult to incorporate it as a way to guide the users to their destination, rather than focusing on trying to make it look pretty (I hate that word anymore, so say that last bit and spit please).

> • I suspect you need to measure success using testing?. A/B testing multi-variant (MVT) - different version testing with users to understand if you achieve desired results.

I love, love, love testing.  It challenges me to be unbiased.  I've learned so much from my users about myself.  Any time I think I really know something, I just need to test it to prove I'm an idiot.  

Also, testing is one of the few ways I can justify what I do.  When I report that we need to do X, Y and Z to be successful and some blow hard (and there's always one) says, ""well, we're not going to do Y because it's just your opinion and I don't like it"", it's soooo gratifying to come back with, ""that's fine, but 94% of our users said that's an issue so by eliminating it, we can save them 14% of time every use which is about $350,000 each year, but, hey, I'm happy to put in my report you don't like it.""

It's also dead helpful to do an A/B test before creating something totally new (or updating something very old) having A and B be competitor's tools.  The business always thinks they know exactly what they want (Narrator:  they don't).  It really instills trust to be able to show them that nearly all of their competitors have this one feature that we lack.  

> • what are industry design standard you need to be aware of?, if any to embark on PD.

I don't believe in industry standards because I focus on the user.  I mean, I'll go to them when we're at certain stages of the project, obviously.  Not going to put a glassy bevelled button on anything ever again, tyvm.  But in the beginning, I want a totally open mind on how the tool should operate to best serve the users.  Also, I've had too many in IT try to be ""cool"" with our output.  I've said over and over at my last job:  We make cars, not software.  If google doesn't do it, neither do we.

That said, PD and UX are careers that require constant learning.  I read literally every day and go to any conference, convention or meet up that I can.  People evolve.  I have to be able to evolve with them.  I'll add that anyone who does not stroke the egos of their developers is a fool.  The good ones read as much as I do.  I may know what the user needs, but it's the developers who tell me how to deliver it to them.  

> • although you are responsible for the design, you are not held directly accountable for commercial performance which falls into the remit of a Product Owner or another role?, looking for clarity.

To be clear, in some teams there is actually a designer who takes the PD/UX recommendations and then creates the final form.  I just happen to be able to do both.  And, since I primarily do internal apps, unfortunately no one cares about how well it does at launch.  I mean, they do for a hot second, and then they move on to the next on fire thing.  If I worked in a good company (fingers crossed for new job), I would be held responsible for any defects caused by the user not being able to find or do things.  But, in a good company, there would be iterations with multiple testing.  What I do is cyclical.  Talk to the business, create a prototype, talk with the business, talk with the user, create a prototype, rinse and repeat.  By the time we launch, we should have nailed down all of the big things and know about the little ones.  We don't create content (but we can review it so it's cohesive), so our roles shouldn't ever be the one threatened if a campaign isn't successful.  We *should* be held accountable if it's inscrutable, though.

> • what’s the ratio men to women?

In usability, I'd guess less than 40% are men in the groups I attend.  If I had to take a stab as to why, I'd say it's a combination of the art background (a lot of designers go into usability) and that meetups of the type I attend attract more females.  Also, coding seems to be a more ""masculine career"" in IT than design.  Although, if usability is done right, the UX person should work for the business.  My last role (automotive), I was one of a handful of women in a sea of men.  The role before that (healthcare) was all men and then me in IT, where marketing was all women.  The misogyny was rampant at both places but most were clueless they were doing it.  I grew up with five brothers and served in the Chair Force so I could hold my own, but I grew weary of it.  A man in my role would probably have been more successful because he wouldn't have been denigrated as much (can't really picture someone telling a grown ass man he makes things pretty).
