MultipleSclerosis,ff9y66b,t3_esgxgo,1579724045.0,"I definitely have huge bouts of yawning, but for me, it’s definitely linked to MS fatigue. My husband knows that once the yawns start, all bets are off. My upper body goes limp, like my arms stop working and my head slumps. And there’s no point asking me questions, because my answers won’t make sense."

BeforeNAfterAdoption,fexf0di,t1_few6z0l,1579429919.0,"You’ll be pleased to hear that it only took a week for her to transform from a timid, frightened little girl who would do anything not to be noticed, to a happy, funny puppy who gives us big wags when we come back into the room and snuggles up on the sofa with us. I think she’s starting to realise that we’re a pack of three and we’re never going to let anything bad happen to her again."

* Franklin D Puppervelt. 
* Frances Ford Puppola. 
* Franks and Beans. 
* Pupperlicious. 
* Franker Danker. 

But mostly, I called her Love Of My Life, My Puppy Wife ❤️"

I guess we can’t expect people to make allowances for things they don’t know about; but now she knows, I hope she realises you need support to manage your shift pattern and that you get that help. Take care x"
dogs,fdlfnm4,t1_fdkt8k0,1578522999.0,"Thank you so much for saying this. It’s been a raw, painful week but we’re getting through it. And as silly as it sounds, I’m already looking forward to ‘visiting’ Frank at the weekend. x"
dogs,fdjn348,t3_elmrg3,1578478902.0,"It’s a week since we said goodbye to our darling girl Frank. We’re still grieving but now we’re remembering the good times with a half smile. We’re lucky really to live in the time we do; there are only a handful of photos of my childhood dog, lots more of our first dog Tess, but endless photos and videos of Frank. My husband has put together a video of all Frank’s greatest moments and it’s so comforting to watch. 

At the weekend, we held a funeral service for Frank. We buried her ashes under our favourite tree in the woods she loved so much, and marked her grave with white roses and a ribbon. My husband played her favourite song (Young Folks by Peter Bjorn and John) and I read a piece I had written about the perfect day we had spent together on a Welsh beach in the summer. Then we walked home together along the canal and shared our favourite memories of our wonderful girl.

Look after yourself x"
dogs,fdg2yvw,t1_fdf5z9n,1578378078.0,"Thank you for this. I just breathed out a huge sigh of all the tension I must have been unconsciously holding on to. That makes so much sense. Frank was the most gentle, loving dog; of course she would want her space to go to another dog who needs it. Thank you again x"
AskUK,fdetb86,t1_fddspmb,1578346162.0,"I work for a charity. Damn right I book my train tickets 12 weeks in advance. We don’t raise money for me to waste it by not being organised. Booked that far in advance, I can get an off peak return for as little as £8. If I left it until a week before travelling, it could cost as much as £70."

rarepuppers,fd2u7bf,t3_ejv8sf,1578151713.0,"I’m so sorry, lovely. We said goodbye to our girl Frank on New Year’s Eve. It’s heartbreaking to lose such a pure soul from your life. Take care - you’ll be able to start remembering the good times again soon x"

dogpictures,fctmsew,t3_eikzmo,1577949313.0,"Thank you everyone. We’re heartbroken. Even though we knew she was living on borrowed time, we’d convinced ourselves that she’d carry on forever. We’re absolutely devastated to have had to make the decision to euthanise her, and I think we’ll spend the rest of our lives wondering whether it was the right time. I know to some people she was just a dog, but to us she was everything. The house is so empty this morning. I can’t bear it."
AskUK,fbgrk3t,t3_eda8s9,1576856942.0,"My parents had no involvement at all. They ‘just wanted us to be happy’ which basically translated as ‘we both left school at 15 and have no idea about further education so won’t encourage or support you.’ I remember my sister wanted to be a nurse, but the nearest college was in a town about 10 miles away, and there wasn’t a bus early enough to get her there. My Mum refused to drive 10 minutes out of her way in the mornings to drop her off at the next village, where she would have been able to get a bus. So she didn’t get to study to be a nurse."
