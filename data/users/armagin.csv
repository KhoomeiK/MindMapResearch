eu4,ffnyghg,t1_ffnlzmw,1580072251.0,"Thanks. I did this write up because a lot of the people who have done AARs on frozen assets basically describe how they blob heavy to win.

I enjoy the trade aspect of this game and I like to think I'm pretty good at it. I knew that this achievement could be done pretty quickly if you were savvy. That being said, I wish the trade system in this game would receive a bit of extra love.

Some of the modifiers are difficult / rare such as trade range. I think that modifier alone could make playing tall much more viable. Also, as in this game, I ended up with a bunch of lazy merchants. The main problem was that placing merchants in downstream nodes decreases your income /  power in some cases. I wish there was some method to use your merchants to push power up stream. Much the same way that colonists were given an alternative use (developing provinces) it would be great to have a use for lazy merchants. Trade cities could also use a rework. As it stands right now they are totally useless."
eu4,ffmkys9,t3_eu8io6,1580056082.0,"R5: This was an incredibly fun run. For some reason I quite enjoy playing in this part of the world, it seems like a bit more of a sandbox than most places. 

Anyways started out with an alliance with the commonwealth and the great horde. I played tall with a lot of diplo to start and picked up defensive ideas. Moved my trading city to the white sea node and developed my provinces. There's an event that gets you a level 2 center of trade in the node, along with some dev, so wait for that to trigger before moving your trade city. Throughout the game I used extra ducats to upgrade centers of trade. 

Accidentally used the wrong CB on Tver and that probably slowed this run down by a couple years. Struck Muscovy and took my cores before turning on the livonan order and riga. Having a lot of trade power in the baltic sea node is good, because it transfers power upstream. Just don't station a merchant there or you will lose that transfer. 

At this point I had taken trade ideas and was about to get plutocratic ideas as well. I had traders steering from Kiev, Crimea and Astrakhan towards the white sea node. Upon dealing the KO punch to Muscovy the white sea node was already one of the most powerful nodes in the world.

I finished the game by adopting a parliament for the increased trade range debates which allowed me to get trade power in Samarkand. I smacked around Transoxiana who was the dominant trade power in the area to force them to steer trade towards me. Also I spent a bunch of cash upgrading nodes in the white sea and novgorod to world ports. At that point white sea was top 3 nodes in the world. Now it was just a waiting game, the value of nodes changes quite a bit each month so eventually the white sea was on top. I was concerned that new world colonies were going to start pumping a lot of cash into the other European nodes and I would have a hard time keeping up, but it all turned out. 

All in all great game! Also, I wish there were more methods for increasing trade range, it seems like a modifier that hasn't kept up with the rest of the game. Definitely one of the more enjoyable achievement runs."
eu4,ffmfk1a,t1_ffmdgoi,1580053928.0,Ah cool. I just counted them all up and they have exactly 20 provinces. I didn't know the AI would do this. Seems odd that they would choose this reform with so many provinces. Nice to see some dynamic behavior though!

ontario,fetkx1s,t1_fesyq30,1579376405.0,"Totally agree here. Early in the 2018 election some polls had the NDP winning. The results on election day were dismal. If they aren't careful in a couple of elections they're gonna be fighting for 3rd place with the Green party. The dominant discourse right now is environmental issues and the NDP has failed to articulate a coherent policy stance on climate change and the environment. 

For those paying attention the provincial Liberals are actually pretty strong on this portfolio. They implemented a great Cap and Trade system, made significant strides towards our Aichi biodiversity targets and were improving transportation systems across the province.

Meanwhile, I'm the chair of a small environmental charity with several hundred members. We sent a questionnaire to all of the candidates in our nearby ridings. The NDP could barely muster a 1 line response while the Liberals gave a very thoughtful and well written answer. We even gave them a second chance to resubmit an answer! When we published the results in our newsletter I received several comments from members about how lackluster the response from the NDP was.

On the point of forcing subdivisions to build solar panels, it is probably not possible for council to legislate that. It would need to come from the province.

1. The General Public now considers environmental issues one of the top issues in Canada
2. Like it or not the Green party has the high ground on environmental issues among voters
3. Attacking the Green party is percieved as an attack on pro-environmental issues by some members of the public.
4. Left leaning voters don't like to see left leaning parties attack each other (The liberal party understands this)
5. Calling GPC members ""conservatives"" just pisses them off, because in many cases it couldn't be further from the truth, the NDP is just galvanizing support within the GPC when they do that.
6. The Green Party has the fewest accessible voters within the NDP.

All this adds up to the NDP spending a lot of wasted time and resources on attacking the GPC. I feel like in the last election, the NDP got so wrapped up with protecting a couple seats on Vancouver Island that they left the LPC free to ignore their left flank and spend all of their energy going after the CPC. I partially blame the poor performance of the NDP in the last election on all the time they spent invested in this poor strategy.

I'd love to have an actual conversation about this without people putting their fingers in their ears and screaming ""ELIZABETH MAY IS A PRO-LIFE CONSERVATIVE WHO SAYS WI-FI CAUSES CANCER."" If you mention the GPC on /r/onguardforthee it was a great way to get covered in downvotes. Is this a sub where we can actually have a grown up discussion about the relationship between the NDP and the GPC? The reality is, the NDP (Who I have voted for in the past 5 elections) really needs to reconsider their strategy and relationship with the GPC otherwise they're going to end up driving more people away."
canadaleft,fdswd0h,t3_emxsk5,1578708798.0,Unfortunately the NDP is in a bit of a catch 22 where a lot of their labour supporters are employed by these polluting industries.
Peterborough,fdpjkrs,t1_fdpgtjr,1578630379.0,Thank god city staff are recommending closing the arena.
eu4,fdo9itr,t1_fdn1vvm,1578601223.0,If you're running through the Spanish mission tree you get a PU CB on Austria. Iberian Wedding should net the player Aragon and Naples. The only out of the ordinary one here is France. OP probably can get Portugal pretty easy as well.

raspberry_pi,fdnn67z,t1_fdn9xot,1578589275.0,"I was working on this phone prior to starting my masters, so I've had to put it on hold, but here is the design I was working on: [https://patchworksmfg.com/?p=606](https://patchworksmfg.com/?p=606)

It struggles a bit with battery life, but it's fairly unoptimized at this point through software. It gets about 10 hrs right now. Additionally I believe that it could fit into a much smaller form factor if different components were used than the ones I had on hand.

My upgrade to do list is as follows:

\- upgrade to use compute module

\- custom double sided pcb- smaller power button

\- don't use a LCD breakout board

considering I didn't do any of those things in the original design, I'm pretty proud what a tiny package it fits into."
eu4,fdnko7j,t1_fdmn42w,1578587807.0,Totally agree. It would be nice if it was just possible.
eu4,fdnkmkf,t1_fdne9tu,1578587780.0,I totally agree with all of this! All I'm requesting is a unicorn and nothing else.
canadaleft,fdnkia3,t3_em73tk,1578587710.0,Haha. Cool to see old friends posted on this sub! Hey Sean!
eu4,fdm8q29,t1_fdm2mcb,1578542590.0,"Seriously, I thought it would be a fun little addition to the game. Had no idea this sub got so hostile. Looks like a couple of comments were actually removed."
eu4,fdkv9l6,t1_fdku5gl,1578511873.0,"It wasn't that long. Some records have it cropping up in the late 14th century in some places. Besides, who cares? All sorts of weird shit happens in this game, a Norse province popping up on a rare occasion would be fun."
geography,fdknq0z,t3_eltzvt,1578507378.0,I would love to find a ranked list that includes more than the top 10 or 30. I wager some interesting connections start to appear further down the list.
