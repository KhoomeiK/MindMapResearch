There may be an option here that you didn't know about and works out helping everyone long-term. It's relatively early so you have a little time to weigh your options. Taking the time to make sure whatever option you choose is the one you both really are comfortable with is never the wrong thing, regardless of which option you go with. 

I'm assuming you're in the US. It's legal for a couple who wants to adopt to help you out financially during the pregnancy. Then you have the baby and they adopt it. If you can deal with going through the 9 months, this could work out all around. 

I don't know what's legal in which states, but it would be easy enough to find out. Then the terms, other than what is drawn up by a lawyer, would be just between the four of you. You could even negotiate them paying the legal costs. My friend in college did this. She found a great couple and also found that some couples were more flexible than others. 

Well, I wish you all the best and just hope you will take a short time to weigh the options to make sure what you choose, no matter what it is, is what you're going to be most comfortable with long-term. Good luck."

You are in a legal crisis. Your choices here could drastically effect your future. 

A lawyer paid by someone other than you IS NOT YOUR LAWYER.

You don't realize how badly this can go for you.  You need a lawyer to protect your rights, to find out what is actually happening, to prepare you for testimony, to negotiate and protect you against potential criminal and civil liability. 

The consultation is usually free.  At least go talk to someone who actually knows what you're up against here. This is not the time to rely on reddit opinions."

These are not things anyone else can answer.  Family, friends, acquaintences, the guy on the corner....will all have answers for you. If you want the correct answers, you need to ask someone who's job it is to know them. 

You probably qualify for subsidized legal as well. Also, most lawyers offer a free first visit. I've found most of them answered all my questions on that visit.  If you have to panhandle for a few hundred bucks to get some legal advice, do it.

Ask yourselves if you agree with what's being shoved down your throats or not. Make your own decisions about other groups of people. 

The current level of micro-managing everything is more destructive than helpful."

Because they make  REALLY BAD parenting decisions. 

That poor kid will have that damn video haunting him the rest of his life. God help him if he ever has to go to court. It'll keep popping up as ""evidence of his psychopathy at a young age."" 
...but I wanna see it, too...."

His only qualification to be 'Boss' is that he owns the property."

I had to sit through a 20 minute rant about how I need to keep on top of these things, that if I had been paying attention, we probably could have been advertising online. 'Online Sales' is literally my job title."

...But then I experienced the downvote, and that bizarre level of misdirected anger some people unleash.  Now every time I get a notification, it's tentative glee mixed with fear and trepidation."

I wish more people would try to understand, try to not judge, try to practice empathy and kindness and realize that, in the overall scheme of things, someone being 'startled' really ...Ok.... I'm just gonna say it.... Dude, being startled falls under Rich People Problems.

Edit: I'm not saying that traffic safety isn't the most important thing. But, have there actually been a bunch of car accidents caused by people looking for money? Or is it that the people with resources and the power to influence laws see it as a nuisance?"
lonely,fcorasb,t1_fc93atx,1577839443.0,"Thanks for the update. I wish it was more of a thing on Reddit. I always wonder what happens to people, especially in subs like this. 

I hope you continue to heal from this. It's painful, I know. Get involved with new things, new people, maybe new girls you'd be interested in. It will help pass the time it takes to heal and you may even meet someone you like just as much. It will also show this girl you aren't just sitting around waiting for her. Paradoxically, that will probably make you more attractive to her."
