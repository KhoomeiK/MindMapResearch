Do not stop, keep going, don't give up. Of course, if you need a side job to live then do what you have to do. But still keep searching while you're working. There will be a light at the end of the tunnel.

PM if you want to chat or have any questions about my journey."

OPMRoadToHero,fcxldvc,t3_ejbrey,1578065746.0,Everyone should voice their thoughts about this in your game store and give it a low rating so they can see it. Instead of the random people that played for a few hours and decided to give them a 4 star because it is fun for a few months.

If you're serious about getting a job in UX, then have someone profread your writing. Your opening for your Spaces project isn't captivating. It's cliche, boring and it doesn't entice me to continue to read the rest.

However, your second project for Anthem is beautifully done and it shows more about your personality. 

You need to elaborate more about what you did for your previous work experience on your resume. Focus on the results and the outcomes of working at each company.

UXDesign,fcmzp1t,t3_ehzsjx,1577798899.0,This is why it is so hard to find a UX job because it takes 3 months to pump out these bootcamp students and somehow they are industry ready to work? So every 3 months you'll have a set of 15-30 students competing agasint you in a world where there are more people than jobs available.
