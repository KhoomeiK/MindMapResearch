Even Trump allies such as Volker and Sondland have testified to this. 

Why not just release the documents and let's get this all cleared up, right? That and some sworn testimony from Bolton, Mcghan and Giuliani will surely show that the president did not take these actions and that these seemingly very credible witnesses have perjured themselves, right?"

moderatepolitics,fdlpaah,t1_fdku8dv,1578529255.0,"Such a nihilistic fucking time we're in. Oh yeah, all politicians do unethical, self enriching shit all the time, why bother? Clinton was absolutely guilty of perjury, yet 10 republicans crossed the isle and voted against conviction. Did they do that because it was politically expedient for them or because they felt lying about a blow job didn't rise to the level of removal? So why won't any one repub senator even consider hearing evidence that would make them consider crossing the isle when it's possible the president used our national security apparatus for a domestic political favor?

I know why. It's because morons and true deplorables have organized and now form the functional base of the republican party and will vote out anyone who defies their orange god. I see a lot of your comments about ""orange man bad"" syndrome and I get it, it's a problem, but what about the mental gymnastics these fuckers do to not only justify, but claim it's a genius move, whenever trump shits the bed?

Regardless what Trump supporters say, they did have a chance to question witnesses and call their own. The judiciary hearings were a cluster but based on the intelligence hearings, there’s more than enough there to merit a senate trial. And what’s the point in having a trial if it’s not a fair one without a predetermined outcome.
