AskReddit,ff0ed5u,t3_eqies2,1579468084.0,"One night I was hanging out smoking with some friends in the college gardens, standing on a bridge looking up at the moon. All of a sudden, the moon almost..zooms in closer to my vision and then goes back to normal. I look at my friend and she goes, “did that happen to you too??” We both experienced this weird moon zoom thing. To this day no idea wtf happened."
