PTSD, Depression, Substance abuse, and even just plain work stress are things that are extremely hard to work out without someone to talk to. Because of the culture of the service, it makes things like group therapy extremely counterproductive. Furthermore, many jobs in the service basically prevent you from seeking help from a Psych or Chaplain as you can potentially lose your security clearance. There is a growing awareness and a lot of work being done to correct this, but there is a long way to go.
