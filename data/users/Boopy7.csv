HIs reason for leaving it doesn't make sense unless he's kidding or doing it for other reasons.   If he believed in God before,   he was believing that God might allow people to burn in hell if they sinned.   So,  perhaps people on the planet had sinned and would force everyone to suffer.   Does anyone see what I mean?   His reason is kind of silly if that's what convinced him."

They did that on me but it wasn't,  my symptoms were very different from yours (no itching,  no redness,  no rashes etc.)  Yours does sound like ringworm or allergic reaction to SOMETHING."
HaircareScience,ff8b8r5,t1_ff8a2rb,1579671632.0,"Derms don't always seem to know enough about hair loss ime.   I figured out what to do and why I lost it on my own,   since they were,  frankly,  useless.   It was frustrating and the nearest trichologist was in NYC.    I'm female so in my case I figured out mild malnutrition,   lack of healing sleep and exercise,   meds,  but especially changing birth control  (I looked up the androgen index for b.c. and switched to one that affected DHT the least.)    I had asked about all of these things,  yet they seemed oddly uninformed and simply said stress.   I too got similar treatments,  and I didn't even have the itching or similar problems -- they automatically seem to think those are the only possible solutions for all of us (they aren't.)   So if you manage to find a derm who knows enough,   list of ALL meds,  foods,  any life change,  and look up any and all side effects of the vaccines you had.   The itching in other parts sounds important to mention,  and don't settle for the same old treatments you've already tried."

I do taxes at an office and there are a lot of people who don't like the gubmt having their number.   But honestly,   what would be the solution?   Do you realize how easy it is to get guns right now?   Do you realize I know a LOT of people who have guns who are suicidal,  violent,  drunks, etc.?   And no,  I will not and cannot report them (or I'm dead.)   I wish to God we were a smarter country and could handle our shit like other countries,  where everyone in each household has a gun but handles their shit like a smart,  decent human.   America is just so fucked up with guns and our love of the Wild West ideal,  I suppose.
I am NOT anti gun.   In fact I intend to be a responsible gun owner soon,  after figuring out which one I can handle best  (I have a great teacher nearby.)  And I HAVE thought of what you are saying.   But when it comes to that point,   I don't think it matters if there's a registry or not.   But this does make me stop and think a bit,  so thank you -- you so far have one of the best arguments.

I know myself by now after forty years.   I was born with depression and most likely will die with it,  and that's fine.   Part of it is indeed learned helplessness,  but it would take a lobotamy to excise that from my brain.

If I hear one more random redditor with best of intentions (or people out in the real world)  suggesting,  oh you won't be depressed if you cut out sugar and take an aspirin and drink some coffee....just please don't do this anymore.

It is however lactose,  and I do recall -- if you read about it you'll see --  that early on,  they weren't sure how to classify it so considered it a sugar,  kind of by default.   Same way as xylitose is a sugar,  but NOT recognized by the body in the same way as glucose or fructose.   Lactose is also digested differently.   This is what I was trying to explain -- that if the reasons people avoid milk is to have less sugar,   that is a silly reason.   Unless they are binge drinking it as nothing in excess is good."

I had a violent attack in my past,  and I truly feel that we fix ourselves best,  not the meds.   I need to figure out how to calm myself and it's hard."

You are saying what I've said numerous times.   Also depression mutates,  it's like cancer -- it tricks you this way.   Let's get out of this.   We have to.

I thought they were shooting very closely with those rounds,  I recall seeing an ear blown off,  for example.   Or something like that.   Are you saying protestors incited this?

And yet,   I don't see much protesting at our gov't flagrantly lying about so many things.   About the embassies they claim were going to be attacked (no),   about Christmas being attacked,  hell,  any excuse and every excuse to be an asshole.   They protest and we don't.   I wonder why.   I think part of it is that we aren't as free as our constitution might have us think.   They just have other ways to suppress,  sneakier ways."

Now,  it was a long time ago,   so I don't remember which one it was but not the one that supposedly caused cancer (thank God.)   She flat ironed into my hair and I do recall thinking,  wow,   so weird someone can do it on that area of my hair (it was that top layer that always got the most damage,  as with many people.)   She knew what she was doing so who knows,   but it is just that one spot,   so I of course can hide it pretty easily.   During a period of malnutrition and stress I did lose hair temporarily but it didn't work like that,   it kind of thins everywhere when that happens,  not in one spot.   I'm so glad it grew back when I became somewhat healthier and switched birth control pills.   I had even bought an expensive wig!   Still haven't tried it on,  it's still in the box."

It wraps and seals keratin AROUND the hair but does not actually strengthen or improve the hair.   It made mine weaker,  and I have a bald spot - an actual bald spot -- to this very day.   My sister recently did one and said the same as you.   It DOES look good,   but the after effects aren't that great.   I'm kinda mad about that spot still."
