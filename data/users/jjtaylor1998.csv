AmItheAsshole,fffyb44,t1_fffxzhe,1579894458.0,"homophobia is completely different than people not liking non monogamy, no one thinks its a evil thing from god to be poly, no one thinks aids is punishment for being poly, no one has it written in their religious script that poly people must be killed, and poly people arent being thrown off buildings. also, a poly person can have one partner and still get sexual and romatic gratification- hiding being gay means a life of misery in an illegal country. we are not the same. just becaude your type of relationship faces persecution because dome people think its unnatural doesnt mean we should be allies. people in large age gap relationships are told its unnatural, or mixed religions or races. that doesnt mean we are allies and face the same persecution"
AmItheAsshole,fffxlb7,t1_fffxg2z,1579894010.0,because the whole point of that orginal comment was showing that they dont belong in the LGBT community learn how to read man. and it DEFINITELY doesnt come from the same place

AmItheAsshole,fffx6c8,t1_fffx3nt,1579893753.0,then if its not LGBT they shouldnt associate with them and realize its a different level of persecution

AmItheAsshole,fffvoba,t1_fffv6vx,1579892809.0,"no one said they dont face REAL persecution, but to imply straight people in a poly relationship are just as persecuted as say a trans or gay person is ignorant. and they were using some instances of their persecution to go against the main point of the first comment: poly people shouldnt be compared to or associated with the LGBT community"
