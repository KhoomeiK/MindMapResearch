Edit. I’ve been a SAHM for almost 15 years. People who give you a hard time for working inside the home are jealous of either your financial ability or amount of patience you have to be able to do it. Not just anyone can do this job.

Edit 2. And those people aren’t worth your time."
minnesota,ff1i8pc,t3_er0sdj,1579479633.0,My husband and I were driving down the highway when we saw a cloud of smoke that seem to be drifting further and further away from us. When we finally caught up to it it was the train plowing the snow in front of it. That force was enough to toss the fluffy snow into the air and cause a whiteout quickly!

AskReddit,fez5l2p,t1_fez245c,1579454005.0,"Yeah, I told him it’s not going to melt with a torch. Then It started smoking. I told him it’s an old pipe my friends and I share so it’s just going to keep smoking. He keeps going, it keeps smoking more and more. I am shaking my head and starting to laugh. Me laughing makes him even more determined to melt it so he keeps going. He tried to melt a glass bowl with a torch for about 30 minutes and only stopped bc the torch quit working. I think he was beginning to feel the effects of the resin smoke because he just sat there in a cloud of smoke totally defeated and didn’t even yell. Don’t know to this day if he sat there bc he was embarrassed or stoned. But whatever, it’s a hysterical family story now."

AskReddit,feyzr5g,t3_eqylap,1579452487.0,"When your wealth is known to others they constantly ask you for it. You already get taxed through the ass, donate plenty to those people who you respect and believe are doing good. You eventually become so immune and annoyed with the consistency of money hungry people coming at you with their sense of entitlement to YOUR MONEY when you eventually just tell everyone to piss off.

Most people with any large amount of wealth donate quite generously to many places. They don’t tell everyone about it though. I personally don’t have any “billionaires” in my circle but I can’t tell you that everyone with money donates more than people even give them credit for. Trust me, the wealth is spread."

offmychest,fc8zuo2,t1_fc6z0mq,1577544762.0,"I wasn’t going to bring this up but this story dragged this out of my past. Although I wrote I’ve always had such loving men in my life, there is one boy I dated in my 20’s that was abusing me. He followed me into a bar with my girlfriends, dragged me out and then drove around holding my hair and choking me. At a stoplight I opened the door and he sped off making it slam shut. Eventually I would up kicking the windshield and cracking it with my high heel. He stopped and I ran down the street. He caught up and threw me down, got on top and started punching me. I’ll never forget the two people who stopped. One was a man that was wearing a khimar on his head and another was an Intrepid filled with young women. THEY ALL HELPED ME. The Muslim man grabbed my x off me and the group of young women put me in their car and called 911. They may have saved my life that night and I thank those kind strangers still. So if anyone knows who was on Cedar Ave in south Minneapolis about 14 years ago and helped a bloodied woman in front of Cedar Ave Repair I would like to personally thank them."

I’ve found that it’s always helpful to let your partner do your job for a weekend. Go on a girls trip, leave him to care for the children and house. When you return he will be grateful for all you do, at least for awhile. Good luck and stay strong. Remember it’s all about the kids and if means you’re have to work extra hard then so be it."
