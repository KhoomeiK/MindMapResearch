You can just use the dudes trick to flip it around to be more accessible.

In general, you need to remember a few things if you want to climb:

First, not every game is winnable, but there is always something you can be doing to push the game towards winnable. 

Don't get tilted. If you're getting mad or on a losing streak, take a break.  

Drink water, stretch, and get at least a tiny bit of exercise before each queue to help stay relaxed and keep some good bloodflow going. Your brain needs blood to work its best.  

Any death you have is your fault. Use your death timer to find the cause of your death.  

Don't be afraid to use [OP.GG](https://OP.GG) or some other site or app to scout your team. A dodge only loses you 3lp and 6 minutes of your time; a lose can lose you between 16 and 24lp, and 20+ minutes of your time. Dodge strategically. Dodge unfavorable teams. Dodge unfavorable matchups.

Watch pro and high level streamer VODs and coachings. SoloRenektonOnly and LS are good and popular. Trick2G has some good coaching/review VODs too. Even their old videos from 6+ years ago can still be relevant, even though a lot has changed, a lot has stayed the same.

&#x200B;

Take notes when watching VODs. It's good to watch coachings of higher ranked players, but you should focus on VODs of similarly ranked players or players one tier up from you. The player skill and knowledge gap is different from tier to tier, and each tier favors and requires a different strategy. (You're not going to get as much mileage out of a tank or a support type character in lower ranks if people don't know how to play around it)."

Sometimes LS's explanations for why do to something is just ""you do this here, now, because I said so"" or ""because it's the right thing to do at this moment"" without going in to what the reasons are so you can recognize the situation and apply the knowledge for your self. You'll have to watch a dozen LS coachings to glean all of that info.
SRO is always chill and explains the hows, whens, and whys of his decision making. I think he's more informative and palatable because of that. He does not have the breadth of knowledge LS has, but if all you care about is a lesson in wave management and timing, SRO will give you a full and detailed course in the first 5-10 minutes of any of his VODs."

It's a drafting and strategy game. There is a fixed but randomized pool of units to choose from. You draft to build your team, but also draft to deny your opponents their key pieces.

Cool, dude. I had a brainfart. It has been literally one season since they dropped Division 5 and added Iron. No division aside from Gold and Platinum has been relevant to my gameplay at all in the last 5 years. Have a heart attack over one simple slip/typo. Go see a mechanic and see if they can fix how bent out of shape you are.

Aside from my one slip, the rest of the post remains correct: ranks are squished, you will be lower ranked at the beginning of the season, and the top level players have to fight their way back in to the top ranks from down here with all of us unwashed plebians."

You might be playing Garen and chase Katarina from your jungle into hers. In game time, it only took you 10 seconds to cross the river, and the skirmish you're having may be lasting 30 seconds, but that actually represents days, if not weeks of ""actual"" hit-and-run battles taking place between Garen, Kat, and their armies, across hundreds of miles.
