PublicFreakout,fg05bh1,t1_fg04d1h,1580400541.0,"It's not just that it's hard work and the kids can get better jobs in the city. Lots of young people want to farm and ranch, but it's nearly impossible to get started these days. If your parents can't hand over a complete and profitable farm or ranch, it's nearly impossible. The cost of land these days is so high that the land can't hardly produce enough to pay off the mortgage, and the big corporations have perverted a lot of the subsidy programs to where they feed big business and help squeeze out family farms.

 My grandad was the last family dairy in my county before switching to raising beef. It just wasn't economical to run a 125 head dairy herd.

There are signs of hope tho. Families in my local area have started working with an NGO to create a ""grassbank"". They buy land and put conservation leases on it, then they let young producers graze on it for cheap, in exchange for using conservation best practices on the land they do own. It helps new ranchers get started and helps the environment! Win-win!"

Not to mention the resourcefulness that others have mentioned.

I thought that was a pretty hot take, being an ecologist myself. I decided to find out just who this organization was, and whether I should take them seriously, so I looked them up. It appears they are no longer associated with the Danish government.

Climate change denial takes many forms today, including denying that it's anthropogenic, denying it can be slowed, and denying it's actually a problem at all. Your comment contains a number of climate change fallacies. Most glaringly, the assertion that CO2 is fertilizing production. The reality is that CO2 is available in the atmosphere far beyond any level that would be limiting to plant production. Plenty of science, including the massive, international FACE projects have shown that CO2 enrichment only exacerbates nitrogen limitation, while warmer temperatures lead to greater C loss from soil organic matter. As far as creating wealth, do they account for all of the externalities associated with climate change?

There is also plenty of economic data from *other* government organizations and think tanks that support the economics of tackling carbon emissions.  Not to mention the moral obligation.

>The only income for the CCC in its first year in the US came in the form of a $120,000 grant from the New York-based Randolph Foundation.

>The foundation, seeded by money from the Richardson family’s sale of the Vick Chemical Company in 1985, gave CCC another $50,000 in 2012.

>The main trustee at Randolph is Heather Higgins, the president and CEO of Independent Women’s Voice and the chairman of its sister organisation Independent Women’s Forum. Higgins is the daughter of R. Randolph Richardson, a member of the family that sold Vick Chemical Company to Procter & Gamble for $1.2 billion. 

>Staff writers of both organisations regularly express scepticism about the science of human-caused climate change and cite Lomborg’s views approvingly.

>Also on the board of trustees at Randolph is Polly Freiss, the daughter-in-law of conservative Christian businessman Foster Freiss.

>Foster Freiss put more than $2 million into Republican Senator Rick Santorum’s 2012 run for his party’s nomination for the presidency. Freiss also bankrolled conservative news outlet The Daily Caller, which regularly publishes articles supporting the views of climate science denialists.

>On his personal web page, Freiss promotes climate science denial sources including Climate Depot and The Heartland Institute. Friess’s website has also promoted Lomborg’s views.

>Foster Freiss and his daughter Polly attended the Koch brother’s secretive 2010 strategy meeting in Aspen, along with Heather Higgins and a host of other conservative activists.

>The tax records of the Kansas-based Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation indicate it has given the CCC two $150,000 grants — one in 2011 and another in 2012.

>The foundation is the legacy of pharmaceutical entrepreneur Ewing Kauffman and currently holds $1.89 billion in assets.

>DeSmog’s analysis of the tax records of not-for-profit groups and foundations donating to CCC accounts for only $520,000 of the total $4.3 million income of the CCC since it was launched in the US. The center’s new website makes no mention of its funding.
