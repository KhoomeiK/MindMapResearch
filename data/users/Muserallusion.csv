Again, respectable for a layperson,  but wouldn’t turn heads in a powerlifting gym.

(Also, watch the full  6+ minute sumo video. He has reasonable leg drive for someone with untrained technique.)"
Sumo,ff80bfk,t1_ff7osym,1579662678.0,"Pete doesn’t have spectacular squat strength by powerlifting standards, but a 500lbx3 squat does not a “skipped leg day” make.

Sumo,few0ab2,t1_feuzze9,1579403638.0,"Did he mean to stand up with Tochi? 

I thought so when I first watched it, but watching the replay, It looked like Enho went for his go to “circle low and to the left”, but Tochi got a grip early and put a stop to it."
emergencymedicine,fet34in,t1_fep8ige,1579371335.0, That's quite a leukomoid reaction. (I figured this was going to be CLL before I clicked through to your clarification.)

It ruins the element of surprise. :)

Health,fem2feq,t1_fel5fjj,1579237535.0,"> The pneumonia isn't what kills you though
Pneumonia without sepsis or acute respiratory failure is trivial. We treat it in the clinic with a few pills.



You’re being pedantic. Pneumonia is routinely a proximal cause of death. Absent brain death, all death is secondary to cardiopulmonary arrest.  By your standard, no one dies from sepsis or acute hypoxic respiratory failure, they die from cardiopulmonary arrest.  But pneumonia routinely leads to these complications.  

Frankly, it is not uncommon for pneumonia that is initially uncomplicated to progress to more severe disease. My inpatient service routinely admits patients that progressed after being prescribed “a few pills” in the outpatient setting. (This isn’t to disparage primary care, but to say that pneumonia (and medicine more generally) isn’t as simple as you’re making it. ) 

Most diseases vary in severity. You can manage a mild CHF or COPD exacerbation, an uncomplicated UTI, even CML “with a few pills” in the outpatient setting. That doesn’t make any of them “trivial”."
Sumo,fehmdj7,t1_fegra4v,1579119477.0,"Tochi has been upping his technical game generally,
but circular/lateral movement remains a challenge for him. Enho does both well. I’m surprised Enho didn’t go with that sort of strategy. 

edit: Enho tried to circle, but Tochi got a good grip early. Excellent bout for Tochi."
Sumo,fehm4ir,t1_fegk62w,1579119333.0,His knees are always good to lift. It’s rotation/change of direction that is dangerous for them.

Yeah. You could call them tech death. I was responding to “made a masterpiece, disappeared, then returned with a banger”.   (Cynic made Focus in 1993; Returned in 2008 with Traced in Air. Atheist made Elements in 1993; Returned in 2010 with Jupiter.)"
