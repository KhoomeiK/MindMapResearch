hisdarkmaterials,fb2eczu,t3_eb2cng,1576449515.0,"Probably my favourite episode so far! Visuals were amazing as well as the way in which they switched from this world to Lyra's world. A bit disappointed the bears didn't fight with their armours, since they're supposed to be their souls (and they also represent the different personalities of the two bears), but I can live with that."
