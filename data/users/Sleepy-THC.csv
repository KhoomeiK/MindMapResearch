AskReddit,ffpvuzc,t1_ffpvjiq,1580107707.0,No it's not. Was completely out of my control obviously but my ex seemed to make it her life's goal to make me think it was my fault. So far it's worked pretty well unfortunately.
AskReddit,ffpsa71,t1_ffp2m9s,1580103872.0,"So this. The two girlfriends that I have had both ended up cheating on me for different reasons (first never really got a reason why, she just was a terrible person, the second I got cancer went through Chemotherapy and while I was figuratively dying in bed alone she was cheating on me online with other guys ""because I couldn't give her what she wanted at the time""). 

I'm scared to get into another relationship and end up realizing it's me and not them that's the problem..."

Then you realize the fucking pile of laundry/dishes that needs to be done and you just give up again. Happens more often than I would like to admit and I'm not even freaking diagnosed.

Then it could get to a point where work is too much and you end up having anxiety/panic attacks which makes you sick to your stomach which causes you to get fired due to too many days off.

Then your ex lies and cheats on you during chemotherapy, causing you to spiral in to an even worse mental state than ever before.

I really should get some help..."

(someone with more medical knowledge back me up here)

It's why most CPR requires mouth to mouth or an oxygen resuscitation kit because if they're unconscious or not breathing, you'll need to refresh the oxygen in their blood by giving mouth to mouth or using an Oxy resus kit. CPR alone isn't enough, it'll keep them alive for a few mins at most. As the oxygen in their blood is spent, you'll obviously need to replenish it somehow."

After giving them a 10 out of 10 on the pain scale and 2 hours feeling like my eyeball was about to explode, they gave me a shot of morphine, which somehow not only reduced the pressure in my eye but obviously reduced the pain significantly.

Borderlands,feiz26p,t1_feiyumx,1579151271.0,Oh I loved them as well. I just really wanted to explore Athenas more. I was incredibly disappointed coming to the fact that it was a single area just to get the key.
Borderlands,feiwsqh,t1_feiluy9,1579149362.0,I think for some it felt like one huge side mission. I'd say Athenas was much worse in that regard though it was literally a single map just to get the vault key piece.

gaming,fefwc09,t1_fefuxv6,1579067324.0,Yeah that's really the main issue that BL has is the grinding of bosses for drops they really need to up  the legendary drop rates and create some form of endgame play/progression especially considering how the games are built around looting guns. If I wanted a farming simulator I'd just freaking play Farming Simulator 20. The current RPG style quests and looter style gameplay they have just is not working a third time around.

gaming,fefupl4,t1_fefu262,1579065802.0,I can't really agree because I am one of those that really enjoy Borderlands but I can understand where you're coming from. It's a pain hitting max level and realizing that the easy part was 1-49 when you were generally evenly matched with enemies or depending on the area over leveled which gave you a feeling of being strong and having the ability to mow down a ton of enemies.
