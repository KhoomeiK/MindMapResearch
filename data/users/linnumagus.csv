bulletjournal,fcs2ezn,t1_fcs0ob4,1577910436.0,I do the black first and use Posca markers. They eat up a bit of the paper but the coverage is really good and they don't bleed through

JusticeServed,f3ajp61,t1_f3884p6,1570776270.0,The Kuressaare castle is also very nice in my opinion and houses a Soviet themed museum to give you a look into people's life in that era :)
