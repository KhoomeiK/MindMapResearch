We would definitely not be able to do that if we had kids! We travel, read, watch movies and TV shows. We gossip about people we know constantly. We're always planning our next trip.

Making new friends is hard as adults. Our friends are all people we knew from before we got married or people from work."
CheerNetflix,ffmfide,t3_eu0vha,1580053897.0,Large CC's in small-ish towns have dorms. The Texas town I live in with my husband has a large and extremely popular community college. They took an old Holiday Inn near campus and turned into dorms a few years ago. They are now building nice new dorms that should be ready for fall semester. It's a thing.

PlusSize,ffa65jr,t1_ffa1z9t,1579728638.0,"I've ordered great stuff from them and terrible stuff from them. I think they are great for party clothes - cocktail dresses, flashy shirts, etc, not necessarily every day clothes. But YMMV. The dresses I have from them have held up great. One is covered in sequins, it's one of my go-to dressy party outfits, and I've had it laundered several times without losing sequins. It still looks like it did the day I got it in the mail."
PlusSize,ffa08be,t1_ff9zug3,1579725251.0,"I find Modcloth hit or miss. Their stuff tends to run small. I've never ordered a dress or pants because of this. I do, however, love their T shirts and own several. I always size up, though."
PlusSize,ff4d3s1,t3_erhb3t,1579560775.0,"The print is ok for the 80's, but the shape is very 2020. It would be cute though, and it wouldn't be inappropriate or anything. If you're just looking to nod to the theme, but not try and win a costume award or something, it's totally cute."
PlusSize,feonqd5,t1_feo0j1l,1579302631.0,"It is. Growing up in the 90's, I was definitely considered plus size at a 12/14, and lots of fashionable stores stopped at 10 or 12. Even then, they would have very few 12's or size XL's. 

I would love to be so ""fat"" now, but even now, all of the plus size departments/store I shop in start around 12. Torrid even starts at 10."

vampires,fdotyvd,t1_fckzzoi,1578612817.0,"Yes, thank you. I am so sick of the vampire as awesome immortal cool dude shtick. A vampire should be *frightening.* There should be that element where just as you start getting really sympathetic to them or being attracted to them, they do something terrifying to remind us that they are, in fact, a monster. Lestat is one of the most seductive characters written, but I don't want to run into him when he's mad."

Foodforthought,fdcdxyo,t1_fdbxdmg,1578272544.0,"Yeah, I get this all the time. I've had students crying because they didn't want to have to take the state test. It's cruel what we are doing to these children."
Foodforthought,fdbtyzo,t3_ekeiu9,1578262076.0,"This is all grade levels, it just gets worse. I teach special ed in a general education environment. (So, kids will come to me for maybe one class, or I will go into a regular class to help them, but other than that they're with all the other kids.) 

The testing alone is enough for me to consider taking a pay cut to go teach in private school. They are forcing kids with dyslexia, IQ's below 80, dysgraphia, severe ADHD, emotional disturbance, etc, to take the same four-hour, 50 question tests as regular kids. Then we special education teachers are shamed and punished when they don't score well. Kids are rebelling, refusing to even attempt the test, and just bubbling patterns on the scantron. I don't blame them, but I'm suppose to ""build relationships"" so that they will try on the tests. 

It's fucked. I hate it. I would much rather focus on getting them to listen to a story and retell it; write simple sentences that make coherent sense; discover skills that can transfer to jobs once school ends; but no, instead I have to drill and kill inference and theme and other high level skills that they can't comprehend. It's infuriating. I don't know how much longer it's going to take for teachers to band together to fight and end this insanity."

I am currently dealing with a parent who is going to other teachers about how she is trying to contact me and I won't return her calls. I have received no calls on my personal phone, no calls to the school, no emails, no texts, nothing. She's a psycho. She's one of many."

They put gas in a bottle, then add wax shavings, like from a candle. When the wax and gas mix, it becomes this sludge that when ignited, causes the fire to kind of spread out wherever it hits."
ArtefactPorn,fckkouz,t1_fckbca5,1577727429.0,"The Natural History Museum in Houston had a Faberge exhibit for quite some time. I got to see it, and it was truly wondrous. It was incredible, even to my modern self, that someone would be like, ""Oh hey, for my wife's Easter gift this year, let's make her a gold egg encrusted with rubies, diamonds, pearls, and the most exquisite enamel. Oh, also, I want it to be able to open up, and inside I want another exquisite jewel crusted egg. That sounds like a good Easter present."" And then to do it year after year after year. Astounding. 

No wonder the peasants started lining them all up in basements to be executed though."

PlusSize,fckihb4,t3_ehipx3,1577726060.0,"I'm a whole lot older than you are, but I totally feel you. I've been the fat sibling my entire life. My family is kind of split. I have a half sister from my mom and stepdad that I grew up with, and two half sisters from my dad and his second marriage that I did not grow up with. I'm fatter than all of them. By a lot. 

It's not an issue with the sister I grew up with. She's very body positive and will even speak up against the fat shaming now that we're adults. My other sisters though.... yikes. It's so uncomfortable being around them. They are always making comments like, ""But you'd just feel so much better if...."" and it always involves some hugely restrictive diet that I have no interest in attempting. They are obsessed with being skinny. One of them has a pretty overt eating disorder that has gotten worse as we have gotten older. It's tough. 

I just try to focus on the things I have that are positive. I don't tolerate overt fat shaming. I don't see them much."
