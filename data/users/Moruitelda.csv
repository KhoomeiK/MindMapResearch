...hold on to your butts.

Spare me the nerd-rage. I am a huge Star Wars fan - hell, I got a custom phone number based on a Star Wars easter egg, and I've watched the OT hundreds of times - and, while The Last Jedi is not my favorite movie, it's also not a *monumental train wreck*. The amount of nerd histrionics about the Star Wars ST is obscene. People are hating it because it's cooler to hate things than to enjoy them. 

The movies are flawed, like the prequels, but have elements that are good and enjoyable, also like the prequels. As a whole, I'd put the sequel trilogy in the same ballpark as the prequel trilogy. 

The Force Awakens was unoriginal and unimaginative, but well produced. The Last Jedi was artistic, imaginative, and original, but struggled with inconsistent tone, poor pacing, and occasionally overwhelming moralizing. The Rise of Skywalker was somewhere in the middle in originality, had a rushed narrative, and was predictable in many ways, but it also had some great moments, interactions, and the final showdown with Palpatine was satisfyingly grand. 

Did it totally undermine everything that George Lucas' movies stand for? *Absolutely not, don't be stupid.* The story's not done when the narrative wraps up, and it doesn't ruin Anakin or Luke's story for them not to resolve everything forever. 

The nerd-rage needs to shut the fuck down. The movies were not as good as they could have been, but they're miles better than the crybabies on the internet are making it seem."

Rafe is putting this thing on the only possible path to completion - plan for two books per season, power through it, hit the high points and tweak the connective tissue to save time. 

The impact and pace *could work* with that plan because the core of the story is good, if the actors succeed in bringing out the greatness of the characters. And if that's the case, we could see 7-8 seasons. Please do bear in mind that Jeff Bezos is a book nerd and that is one main reasons that Amazon went after The Lord of the Rings so aggressively in the first place.

For those of us who haven't had our morality defined by Catholicism or American conservative Protestantism, the idea that a fertilized egg immediately becomes a person who is subject to protection is a ridiculous one. 

I think most of us come down as follows: 

- Early term abortion should be allowed and it's not a big deal, because the blastocyst/embryo isn't yet human-like enough to merit protection; and
- Mid-late term abortion should be allowed because people aren't seeking it out as an elective (the data supports this if you look at when abortions are sought - the people ""using it as birth control"" go at 5-12 weeks; the people going at 20+ weeks are doing so within a week of milestone doctor visits) - it's generally because a catastrophic medical situation has emerged with the mother and/or the child, and while it's a tragedy, it's better than the alternative.

IdiotsInCars,feo8yls,t1_feo7ov7,1579296725.0,"My city drives me crazy, in that a lot of sections are timed so that you'll have to stop at every light. If you can get to the front, accelerate like a bat out of hell, and then stop at the right speed, you can *just* catch the next light. They're not all like that, just a few areas, which means that driving like a crazy person at the right lights can actually save you several minutes on your commute."
IdiotsInCars,feo7cjw,t1_fenb5id,1579296122.0,"Same here. I pay attention to the patterns. On my drive home, I know which streets to take to get out of the city core with minimal delay, and I know where the right lane of the arterial backs up next to the supermarket, and where the left lane backs up for traffic headed to the university... 

The flip side to that I that I also know which lights you really need to accelerate hard and go 5-7 mph over the limit in order to catch from the previous light, based upon the timing, and so I sympathize with the shitty drivers who get stuck behind someone whose attitude is, ""You're just racing to the red light."" Nah, man, I know that I can catch the light at Stadium Drive if I just go 41 mph in a 35 mph zone and nobody blocks me in."

space,fendedl,t1_fenchpd,1579282292.0,Grain of truth. But the suggestion that the gravitational field is turbulent is probably overstating things a little - and that's an effect of this moreso than a cause. The suggestion that the gravitational field is failing is... no.
space,fenbnj1,t1_fena04y,1579281226.0,"He's not arguing semantics in bad faith! The sun's surface looks like this, albeit much less dramatic. The sun's surface is not smooth - it's not this active, but phenomena like solar flares result in giant arcs of plasma being thrown out into space and lashing outward for millions of miles. The cause is different on Betelgeuse, and the phenomenon much more pronounced, but the response, ""The sun's surface *isn't* smooth"" is a very reasonable one!"
space,fenbf03,t1_fen8m4s,1579281080.0,">  turbulent or failing gravitational field

...no, no no no. It's not a ""turbulent"" or ""failing"" gravitational field. The gravitational field is mostly stable. What's turbulent is the thermonuclear reaction that's providing outward pressure to balance against the tendency of gravity to smash gasses together into small spaces at the bottom of the gravity well. 

It's the thermonuclear reaction that's becoming turbulent as it approaches the point of having fully expended its fuel."
nfl,fenat08,t1_fen9vep,1579280700.0,"I would be shocked if the NFL devotes any more thought than putting a public relations or social media coordinator on it. Very low level. I know that we, in /r/buffalobills, have gotten absolutely no outreach from the team, or any effort to affect the content that gets posted. With the way the league operates, I would expect that any such effort would be part of a concerted effort across all 32 teams."
