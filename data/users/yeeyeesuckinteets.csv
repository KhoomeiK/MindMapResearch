funny,fd7if1n,t1_fd79qhv,1578205032.0,Nothing on this xbox was cleared when I bought it. All the persons old games and apps were still on it. It was set on home xbox. Nothing fishy at all. It's just one of those things either you have to put the faith in that I'm telling the truth or you can think that everybody just lies on reddit. Your choice.
funny,fd7g484,t1_fd7b0dg,1578203952.0,These dudes in denial about porn being bad for you can have fun with their erectile dysfunction when they are older.
funny,fd77jns,t1_fd71ox0,1578200454.0,Me. I'm a real person who quit from a serious porn addiction. It was starting to affect my relationship with my girlfriend. I'm glad I quit.

funny,fd6exyx,t1_fd6dywj,1578189952.0,It's probably because it's lame/not cool to talk about quitting porn and recognizing you have a porn addiction.

funny,fd60e7h,t1_fd5zv58,1578183792.0,Lol. Last year I actually made a commitment to quit porn completely. It was just a dirty habit that didn't make me feel good about myself. I'm happy to say I'm porn free.
funny,fd5ydoz,t1_fd5y0c8,1578183061.0,I'm definitely deep cleaning the controller after seeing all those anal searches
trees,fd01hb0,t1_fd00yfs,1578112227.0,"The year after highschool I took about 4 grams of mushrooms and had the most intense trip I've ever had. Something on a very spiritual level. Now that you mention it, the psychedelic experience did change alot in my life (for the positive). It probably changed the way I smoke weed too."

trees,fczvkc1,t1_fczval6,1578109347.0,"Hell yeah one of my best friends and I used to roll up an eighth in a backwood and smoke it in one sitting like it was nothing. We didn't have rent to pay or any obligation besides school, so we smoked weed like it was a religion. Good times."
weed,fczv61o,t1_fczugba,1578109154.0,"Im aware that maybe my tolerance isn't what it used to be, but it was a very natural process that made me not smoke as much. I still smoke weed everyday but I've just had to cut back over the years because I kept finding myself getting more stoned than usual when I would smoke a joint. 

Maybe my weed tolerance just goes down with age."

CasualConversation,fcwn25f,t1_fcwmiao,1578030314.0,Man those 4 things you listed that you enjoy about your job are on point. Especially working with a good team and being appreciated.

Thank you for your well thought out reply.
CasualConversation,fcwm1sm,t3_ej83vi,1578029428.0,"I feel like I am reading myself talking. This is exactly what I'm going through. 23 years old and not going to college, working an average job, rent and bills are really expensive so I cannot save up any money. I'm just going through the motions every day and working a boring job just so I can pay rent and keep food on the table. I feel like I've already become a 40 year old man.

I'm definitely going through it. I've been questioning myself alot lately on all my decisions that has led me to feel directionless in life. I don't know exactly what I want."
selfimprovement,fcnhsv6,t1_fcn7pei,1577811993.0,I absolutely hate being hungover. I plan on maybe having 1 or 2 drinks but that's it! I'm not going into the new year feeling like shit.
selfimprovement,fcm8b8q,t3_ehu2xt,1577766908.0,The first step is becoming self aware of your destructive attitude. You've already completed one of the most important steps that alot of people are too stubborn to recognize. Just practice on focusing on any negative thoughts or negative behavior you have throughout this week consciously make an effort to be more positive. Start listening to audiobooks and youtube videos about how to be more positive. Take an initiative to change for the better. You got this:)
