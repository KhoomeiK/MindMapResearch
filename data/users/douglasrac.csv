TransportFever,fenhaxz,t1_fem3ew8,1579284677.0,Yes. But once you have containers the only thing it can't carry is oil.
TransportFever,fenh4li,t1_femm7ym,1579284569.0,">The point of an arrangement like the iron one is actually the opposite, it's predicated on the fact that one mine can't even supply a single mill, so trains between it and the mill will be likely to have space. If I oversupply a mill, the ore will have nowhere to go. But if I create a connection to another mill, the ore will then be able to go to the other mill to be consumed. An alternative approach would be to create a line like mine -> mine -> mill -> mill, this would have a similar effect but just isn't my usual style.

I do not have such a problem because I carefully plan the rate of the route to not overcome the necessary rate of supply. So I don't have surplus in the station or empty wagons that have extra unnecessary costs. My trains have the exact size they need to have. Specially because once the factory/mine reaches highest level, you know for sure the max rate it can pull and that will never change. So optimal number of wagons is fixed and easy to reach.

&#x200B;

> But if you have one giant goods train moving around picking up 250-300 units every few months ingame, it gives time for the goods to accumulate there. The downside is the game will interpret this as a poor transportation link due to infrequency. To get around this I'll usually have multiple trains on these routes. 

That is unfortunately a downside of this game which avoid me to have successful hubs and even multi modal transportation do not work very well because of this.

&#x200B;

> Here's a good example: in my southeast region I have a regional goods train. This connects every machine factory, tools factory, plastic plant, and food plant in the entire region. Every time it passes near a freight node I have it stop there. My freight network is intensely mainline based and often 4-6 tracked so trains are naturally funneled through nodes anyway. Some of these nodes, naturally, are interchanges with other regions. This means that the goods produced in the southeast have an opportunity to go to that node, get off the train, then get picked up by an inter-regional goods train that connects key nodes. This is significant because let's say a city on the opposite corner of the map needs more tools than it's getting. This system allows tools to get to that city in 3 trains: goods train to the regional interchange node, inter-regional train to the next region, and then the other region's corresponding goods train to the city node 

Ah now I think I get it! You have a network and just link the industries and towns. The system will work in a way that you don't have to worry who goes where. You just put stuff in and they go where they need to go. That probably works better having wagons that carry everything. Because one big problem would be oil that always need a tank wagons. And container wagons usually carry everything else.

I did that once in one game, but the costs were much higher than regular A to B approach. But I like your way. I will try to make it again. My approach was slightly different as was 100% based on circular route. The division per region is quite interesting!

Thank you very much for taking the time to write it down. It motivated me to try a different network again! And this will definitely make money not as easy as it is now."
TransportFever,fell5uk,t1_fekgzv6,1579224803.0,"I would love to have either a saved game or a simply ""paint brush"" scheme of this, so I can fully understand it.

About this:

>I also started to consolidate train lines and link parallel chains together. For example, rather than having lines like iron -> mill or iron -> iron -> mill, I set up ones like mill -> iron -> mill. This lets iron from one over-capacity mill be shipped to another where it can be used, filling up the train the rest of the way.

So its basically 1 iron mine supplying to two mills? I never have surplus of iron, since a steel mill can produce more than 1 mine can supply.

&#x200B;

> Another thing to realize is the way freight works, goods get earmarked for particular train lines so having lots of lines at one station spreads your goods really thin and hurts the economics of your trains.  

How do you tackle this?

&#x200B;

As I understood your hubs are the city train station? So the logs would be delivered to the city and from there delivered to a sawmill then back to the city?"
TransportFever,feljmcj,t3_eounaw,1579223756.0,"I don\`t think its feasible. Costs will be too high as you need to keep empty wagons in some trips. And for realism, you can't mimic realism in this case in this game. Because IRL trains change wagons all the time, and in game you can only do that manually. In games like Railway Empire that would be very easy, as you have to worry about routes and not wagons, so the trains will automatically change its wagons as needed. 

In TF2 the only way to do that is in modern wagons that work almost like trucks (fit everything) aka containers. But in early game the cost of carrying specialized empty wagons will be too high.

I did that once in TF1, not only carrying goods in a chaotic manner, as you say, but also one route to supply several cities. Worked fairly well, but the costs were too high. Imagine if the train pickup cargo to deliver to city A, B and C, means after city A at least 1/3 of wagons will run empty. After city B at least 2/3 will be empty and 100% empty from city C back to resupply. Its not very cost effective."
