todayilearned,ffpvicu,t1_ffpvc32,1580107303.0,"Yeah, but that’s my initial point. Anything can be a religion. I think cat ladies are running in their own cult for instance. Cats can do anything, but like Indians with cows I think they let them do anything they want.

My information on Wicca may be off then, but the principles I’ve learned from them seem spot on to how I feel about most things. Love nature and every religion has some truth to it. The same all powerful and loving god. With none of the weird oxymorons such as an all powerful and all loving god that requires you to be subservient to him and his rules or else he sends you to be tortured by the devil. Who, in a weird could just as easily be destroyed and erased thus erasing much of the evil in this world. Peace and love is what I agree with."

todayilearned,ffpuvxn,t1_ffpulyt,1580106611.0,Anything is a religion. The Morman religion wasn’t created all to long ago for instance. Christianity came after Judaism. Wicca is a way of life that was created way before the 50’s. It just became more popular by more modern writers such as Scott where I think you got that information.

todayilearned,ffpreh2,t1_ffpocax,1580103017.0,"It’s a pagan religion. I’m not sure if this is directly related to Sabrina, but it correlates to teaching with my Wiccan religion. Albeit, non of my teaching or learning has been this aggressive or evil, but I know of a few bad apples that attempt to practice in these types of ceremony’s."

PoliticalHumor,ffpq7dt,t1_ffpng52,1580101891.0,Exactly that. You have to think on the spot with maybe 2+ officers with guns drawn. It might sound easy to do if you’re a cop who has rehearsed this with your friends or lawyer. When they have their guns drawn on you it does not feel like a take your time moment.

weed,ffmo396,t1_ffmnye6,1580057172.0,While it may not solve all your problems it can help. Giving yourself goals outside of Reddit and this sub in particular may help.
weed,ffkppt1,t1_ffj30mz,1580026736.0,"It’s people like u/alldatjizzjazz that cause the shift. Not sure if it’s just because we’re getting old and the younger generation is looking for something to complain about. But we’re not wrong for enjoying our 420&69 jokes. It’s engrained. The takeaway that should be had is that if seeing a joke like 420 & 69 bother you so much that you talk down on those that enjoy them, then maybe get off Reddit? Find a new sub? Start a new work out routine, eat healthy and something productive and positive aside from injecting negativity into places where there was meant to be any. Does this make sense u/alldatjizzjazz ? Peace love and prosperity always."

All the vapored bud left over (already vaped bud(AVB)), can be used to make edibles or just eat later to her high again!

I don’t quite remember the physical response to being engulfed in super heat, but if it’s similar to jumping in iced water, the body wants to take a breath. I hope he survived"
