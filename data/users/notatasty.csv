fuckeatingdisorders,fe6ga7p,t3_eny1ob,1578890002.0,I would definitely talk to a doctor or therapist if you have one. You’re really underweight. Maybe if you tried to get muscle it would help? You sound like you’re healthy but it never hurts to talk to a professional. Fasting is good but as you’re really underweight you definitely want to talk to a professional
AnorexiaNervosa,fe61yur,t3_enx4tn,1578879975.0,Dude you’re so skinny and underweight. I hope I didn’t trigger u but losing more weight could make you really sick

offmychest,fcm1rm6,t3_ehwsg5,1577761978.0,He took advantage of you. It’s his fault and you’re the victim. Don’t hate yourself
offmychest,fcj7u2g,t3_ehdik4,1577679450.0,"As a musician who has experienced burnout so much this year, I feel you. I’ve been in your shoes before. Don’t want to sound rude, but have you told your parents that you wish they would come? My mom works a lot and is run down by social events (she’s introverted) and it took my aunt saying something for her to start coming. It’s not that she didn’t want to come, it’s just the social environment wore her out. I’ve always wanted flowers too and they’ve never given them to me. But again something else we should both bring up to our parents. People recognize your talent, but you have to continuously work your ass off for them to see it."

There are also abortion pills you can get online if it comes to that. Best of luck to you two and I hope everything gets sorted out for the best :)"
offmychest,fc3u6ur,t3_eg1ueu,1577398730.0,Just get a pregnancy test. Teenagers’ periods are late all the time because you’re still developing. I’ve had my period forever and it still sometimes is late or early
loseit,fc304jd,t3_efq85m,1577378419.0,2000 isn’t too many either because you’re still growing. And the girls at 110-115 are probably shorter than you. You’re at a healthy weight as a growing 14 year old.
