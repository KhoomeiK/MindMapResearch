askwomenadvice,fdh230t,t3_el7mjl,1578413706.0,"I did mine while going to school, working, and with a new baby and a teen at home. (Single parent) If I can do it, anyone can! First, I carried note cards everywhere in case I had an idea. At work, I focused on work. At school (art) I could work and take down ideas, facts, or resources, that I came across. (Morning school, afternoon work.) When I got home, I allowed myself 2 hours of family time (dinner, breastfeeding, tv) before writing time. Then I'd gather my shit (notes, books, beverage, snacks, pillow and infant) and I'd write one page. If I had more in me, if write until bedtime.  If I had even more, i'd stay up until 1 am. Weekends were all about the writing: ""If you 2 will let me write for just 2 hours, I'll spend the 2 after that focused solely on you."" ten weeks, 432 pages, and 2 volumes later, I was done and ready for rewrite.  The rewrites were overwhelming and finicky. I did 2-4/day and then did my 2nd submission.  More rewrites. I cried then got to work. I forced myself, reminding myself that I didn't want to teach junior high art for ever and I wanted to be done before my supervisor retired. Give yourself a schedule, goals, and at least 2 reasons to get it done. Take benadryl to sleep so you won't lie awake thinking about it, or a restful tea or warm milk. Make time for a hot bath and a good meal. You WILL conquer this! Best wishes!"
offmychest,fdcowp8,t1_fdbdoig,1578280335.0,"Kindness and love are a place to start. As is respect and a willingness to listen. Start a conversation. Help someone. Lots of places to start. Volunteer. Take care of repairs or lawns for the elderly. Teach a child to dance. Dance with them. Help with recycling. Go to city council meetings. Talk, yell, and be heard."
offmychest,fdb2o85,t3_ekf9qr,1578253085.0,"I (F60) ask that ALL of you do something about this! Vote this fucker out of office, so public speaking of campaigning. Make flyers about what you want and post them everywhere. Riot, protest, ignite that battle for something better. My gen (ok boomers) changed a nation and a society with these actions and it can be done. Get radical. Even if others don't agree with your ideas, keep demanding change, as it causes others at least pause to reflect on what changes they made that have caused our now. Believe me, if you dwell on shit, life just keeps getting shittier. Act, move, scream, challenge, and meet with other people. Even my gen wants what your gen wants because we're all human. Blessings on you."
relationship_advice,fda9mrs,t3_ek7tvr,1578243336.0,"Call your school in the morning and let them know what's happening. Arrange for your work for a week to be prepared for you and have someone pick that up, books and all. Then settle in for time with family and friends. Ask your best friend to stop by after school. Most of all, your brother will never be completely gone; he'll always live within your heart. Blessings on you and your family."

insaneparents,fcxrguk,t3_ej79he,1578069411.0,"I was forced into this when my sister was born. My sister was completely neglected and mom refused to care for her. I'd do my best to change diapers, soothe her, and feed her, but I was too young to lift her. We're 3 years apart. I hated being responsible for her. Mom even made me sleep, bathe, and check on her at school. I hated it. My sister has Downs, autism, childhood schizophrenia, and severe behavioral, intellectual issues. She was finally removed from home and placed in foster care. I was ecstatic. This is unfair. Take care of your own kids and let her be one?"

NarcissisticAbuse,fclblxi,t3_ehhabi,1577744066.0,"My n mom always thought she was an incredible artist. Now, for background, I (F60), have an undergrad, 2 masters, and a PhD, all in art. My mother has none of these and even quit high school at 15 when she married my dad. Some of her paintings aren't that bad, but for each good one there were at least 20 complete failures. I hated it when she wanted me to critique her work because, well, you just can't be honest with her. You have to give her gushing praise or she'd get furious and physically attack you. When I was still at home, she'd then destroy anything I made. 

I got so sick of her bullshit that I gave her the info on an arts group for her to participate in. Yes, the goal was to get her off my back and, yes, I'm firmly aware I was sending a sociopath into a social setting. It didn't go well. She got a very negative critique on one of her paintings (and it WAS shitty) and she lost it. Apparently, she destroyed some of the works and tried to run over one of the members with her car. Thankfully, she didn't succeed.

Fast forward a few years to her wanting to bring my son for a visit. Now she didn't care to see me or my daughter (who looks like my twin, only far younger) but I drove both of them the 300 miles anyway. I stepped inside the door and, to my shock, in a proud and prominent place was the most hideous fucking painting I've ever seen. I'm sure my jaw fell open, it was so hideous. She asked me if I liked it. I knew I was walking into a trap so I asked her if she wanted her daughter to answer or if she wanted the art prof in me to answer. She wanted the latter. She ASKED for the latter. So I let her have it. I spent the next hour asking her the same questions as I have my own art students and giving her feedback on every aspect of her painting. She became pink she was so pissed. Then red. And then...This deep shade of purple that she always was while beating the shit out of me. This time, though, she had been chair-bound for about 5 years and couldn't attack me. When I finished, I said, ""You look like your panties have been twisted in a giant knot and shoved up your ass. This is the art world. If recommend you read and study some more."" I then collected my daughter, and headed to a friend's house for the weekend. My son told me a few weeks ago that she never painted again. We should all be relieved."

offmychest,fc6z0mq,t3_egcwee,1577493165.0,"Once, late at night, I was driving home from your standard super center, when I saw a woman trying to get out of the truck she was in. She was struggling and screaming but eventually hit the pavement. I put my car in park and ran to get her. I told her there wasn't time because he'd be back and got her in to my car. My mother was fighting me on the issue so I told her to shut up. Dropped mom off at my home, called out domestic violence program for pickup. Violent offenders recognize cars so a handoff was necessary. We parked where they told us to and she switched cars. They took her to hospital and the police followed. I have no regrets for helping.  People need to be willing to help those in need. I still wish her well."

Btw, knock and then wait for them to invite you in."
NarcissisticAbuse,fc14s00,t3_efi6nw,1577308247.0,"I had a severely abusive nmom. The physical violence was never absent; it was always there with the rest of her abuse. Initially, she wouldn't hold me after I was born. Family interceded so she could be discharged from the hospital. She always handled me very roughly. I remember constantly crying and perpetually afraid of her as a child. It was during infancy that she refused to hold me, sexually assaulted me, physically beat me on an almost daily basis, and continually verbally assault me. I tried telling people, even called the police a few times, but no one ever listened. My sister was removed from our home when she was 10, but they left me behind and that's when she began attempting to kill me. This continued into her old age when she'd slacked off on the physical and began demanding my pay checks. Two children and 3 marriages later, I'd had it. I went no contact. I stayed ND until her death. A few hours before she died, I spoke with her. I owned that conversation and told her she was the worst fucking human being imaginable. She died alone. I've had my best years since. It can be done."
