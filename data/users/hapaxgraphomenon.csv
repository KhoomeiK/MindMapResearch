Firstly, the Greece of today is not the Greece of 10 years ago. 

Secondly, income taxes in Greece are deducted at source, meaning that anyone who is on a salary from the private or public sector (ie 80% of workers) pay taxes automatically. 

The problem with tax evasion in Greece is the self employed, who can essentially choose whether to issue a receipt or not. As the Greek economy has a higher proportion of self employed than many other European nations, the tax evasion rates were roughly double than the rest of Europe. That was certainly high, but on a par with Italy which has a similar proportion of self employment.

In the last several years, significant progress has been made in curbing this - eg by making it legal for customers not to pay at all if a receipt is not issued, and by forcing the self employed to accept debit / credit cards above certain amounts.

I am European and I have legitimately hurt Americans (without realising) by questioning how can they call themselves Irish/Greek/German etc when they know nothing about their supposed country, have never visited and don't speak the language.

The concept of identity is vastly different in the US than really anywhere else."

Also a bunch of pharmaceutical companies are actually European (Swiss, British etc) and not American to begin with.

Finally, just take a look at the expenditures of American pharmaceutical companies - they spend a ton more on marketing than on R&D, and what they spend on the latter gets significantly subsidised and supported by the government and by academia.

There really is no easy and quick fix for the perverse incentives that are inherent in the US healthcare system."

2) Put the rest on the stockmarket, and specifically buy a low fee index fund (eg tracking the SP500)
3) Go to university and get a fulfilling job and career; nothing will destroy a young person's life more than boredom and lack of purpose  
4) Let your investment grow without touching the capital, and reinvest most of the returns"

Retirement savings are structured to do what they say on the tin - help you save for retirement. The reason these penalties and tax implications exist to begin with is to prevent you from vandalising you retirement savings to buy a car.

Here's my two cents:

1) Keep contributing to your 401k and never touch it again until retirement 
2) Calculate how much you spend per month on average. Multiply that figure by 6. This is what you need to save, in a separate savings account.
3) That new ""emergency fund"" account is now what you use in case of job losses etc 
4) Whenever you dip into your emergency fund, make sure you replenish it back to your ~6 month expense figure"
