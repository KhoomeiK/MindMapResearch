The kids were taken into custody for a grand total of 20 minutes but it was heartbreaking because even the kids, who were all under the age of 10 knew exactly why this was happening."

AskReddit,ff618m5,t3_ern3xf,1579616537.0,"I’m can be an asshole for almost no apparent reason. I gaslight. I lie. I binge eat. I smoke pot despite my therapists advice. I’m needy. I’m lazy and unmotivated. I procrastinate. I just can’t seem to keep my shit together. I manipulate. If it weren’t for my wife I’d be living back at my moms working a shit job and playing WOW and smoking pot nonstop. I suck at being a housekeeper and a stay-at-home dad. My wife keeps a running tally of how many days she hasn’t liked me enough to have sex with me. We haven’t had sex since last June and it’s going to be awhile, there’s a backlog. I’m overweight and can’t stay motivated enough to keep at it. I seem to have a complete lack of empathy. Even though I preach “growth mindset” I don’t practice it. I’m painfully forgetful. I’m selfish. I grew up being a spoiled child that turned into a spoiled, entitled man-child. I cut corners. I don’t pay attention to detail. I hold grudges against the universe."

The truly messed up thing was the surgeon that administered the epidural said my herniations were the worst he’s seen in a few years and was surprised that I wasn’t hospitalized. He was also surprised I didn’t pass out from the pain of the needle in my spine."
