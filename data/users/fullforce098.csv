Yes, there are people that care in Washington, and yes, there are people that listen to evidence and wish to prosecute crimes. Guess what? They're in the minority and litterally can't get it done.

You're making it sound like somehow the Democrats would change their minds but they've ""already made them"" or something? This is not a matter of opinion, this is simple, indisputable fact, supported by mountains of evidence. Of course they aren't going to change their minds any more than they would change their minds about whether the fucking grass is green. There's no ""opinions"" here, it's simple evidence and those that refuse to accept it.

Yes, this is political theater, because the whole point of impeachment was to get the Republicans *on record*. They have to vote, and it will be their legacy. Voters will decide how they feel about reelecting them after this vote. This is all for the voters.

TVDetails,ff5pnr9,t1_ff5fnay,1579604994.0,"The Titans show comes off a bit as a victim of its budget. It gives us a lot of excellent stuff but when it comes time to go BIG it really shys away. Beast Boy in particular is a victim of this, as depicting his powers involves a new CGI animal model on screen which is a lot of work and money, so he only transforms like 2-3 times in all of the show thusfar. Most of the action scenes involve the melee Titans, and while they're actually *really* well done, the absence of Kory or Raven coming in and blowing fuckers away is notable.

Its story is very disjointed, giving us some really well set up stuff and stuff that comes completely out of nowhere. I don't want to spoil anything but season 2 has a great storyline for certain characters and for others...things just kind of happen.

Its overloading itself with characters and plotlines, as well. Yes, it's awesome we get to see Superboy, and he's really, really good in his solo episode, but ultimately he's taking screen time away from developing the characters the show already has (a problem Young Justice season 3 has as well incidentally).

PokemonROMhacks,fdsjef5,t1_fdseo57,1578703885.0,"Back in the Gen 1 days, the internet was not a huge thing yet. We only had word of mouth and strategy guides to discern  information about the game. Every kid wanted Mew because he was the original mythical Pokemon, #151, the rarest. But if you were an American kid, you had no legitimate means to obtain him because the only way was attending an official Nintendo event and having your game adjusted. Those events were only held in Japan.

But, Mew *was* in the code, and because we had no legit way to get him, all the kids started coming up with ideas about how he might be hidden somewhere in-game. Those ideas started being spread by word of mouth among grade schoolers until they were the talk of every school playground. Hilariously, the same line seemed to be spread around too that you ""herd it from your Uncle that works at Nintendo"". It's bizarre how that same bullshit got repeated so often across the whole country. The most popular rumor was that Mew was hidden beneath a truck on the dock of the SS Anne, and if you moved it, you found a pokeball with Mew inside to keep.

The fucked up thing was in order to get to the truck, you had to basically start a new game. The Truck was only accessable by surfing from one dock to another next to the SS Anne. However, you get to the SS Anne long before you have surf, and once you finish the SS Anne (and get HM01) the ship leaves the dock the moment you step off of it. Once the ship has left, the guard standing in front of the dock will not let you enter it again. Therefore you basically had to go through the ship, get HM01 from the captain, and instead of walking off the ship, you used Teleport to go back to the Pokemon Center. Then the ship will not have left yet, and you can return later in the game once you have Surf.

So after going through all of that, you get to the truck and try to move it and...nothing happens. Nothing you do will move it. It was all a lie. One of the most infuriating experiences of my and I assume many other's childhoods.

They didn't just say oh well, take their money and move on to the next cash grab, they didn't charge for the rest of the game's content in the form of microtransactions or paid DLC, they didn't turn their fixing of their own mistakes into a PR stunt. They just did the work, didn't ask for anything else from the players except time and feedback. That's commendable nowadays because Lord knows no other company will do that anymore.

Square Enix also deserves a nod for their handling of FFIXV. They fucked up, sat down and fixed their mistake and now I'm told FFIXV is considered one of if not the best MMO currently running.

It's a far cry from the President actually ordering a war crime."

>
>* Report them
>* Downvote them
>* Consider muting them

Ok I'm not sure how I feel about this. If you can engage with them in a civil way that might encourage them to think differently, shouldn't we have the option to try?

More importantly, even if you can't change their mind, there's people coming into the thread and reading the comments that you might be able to convince. It isn't just about convincing the person you're speaking too, in every comment thread there is an ""audience"" that you are also presenting information and arguments to.

I'm really not in favor of letting people spill false or misleading information without it being corrected, either. No matter how fast it gets removed, there is always a period of time when it sits and people read it without also seeing the counter arguments and facts.

There's also the issue that you'd like us not to reply to comments we *think* are breaking the rules, but you are the ultimate arbiter of what is and isn't violating those rules. That creates a situation where the replying commenter has to predict how the mods will respond to a posted comment, and if they think it'll be removed, they shouldn't reply. But if the comment doesn't actually violate the rules, the replying commenter has no way of knowing that if it's OK to respond because it could just be that the mods have not removed it yet.

So essentially you're creating a situation where responding commenters have to second guess if they should even respond based on presumption of rule violation. Meanwhile the person that posted the comment is getting to spread ideas and information unchallenged.

To clarify I'm not necessarily against a ""don't feed the trolls"" policy, but there's a lot of grey area here and I'm not sure telling people not to correct misinformation or challenge abrasive ideas at all is the best way to go about it."
FriendsofthePod,fdjxb3e,t1_fdiiuf4,1578490455.0,"""Don't feed the trolls"" has been an internet motto since the early days of AOL chatrooms, yet it feels like people just forgot about it.

I will say, though, I'm not particularly fond of the idea that we can't respond to someone spreading misleading or false information. Basically we just report and wait for the mods to address it but until they do, people coming into the thread will see the comment, see it being unchallenged, and might walk away with the wrong idea. Not to mention people often check sites like removeddit to see what a deleted comment was, and if they are it having been deleted without anyone having provided context for why it was removed (i.e. it's spreading misinformation) they might interpret it as censorship.

I just feel like misinformation should always be met with the correct information, on principle. No one should get to spread lies without the truth also being presented."
