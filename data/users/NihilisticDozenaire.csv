I saw the original four in 1996. Hella awesome show. Saw them again last year in Switzerland and if they come close, I‚Äôm going again.

I‚Äôd go with 1988 Kiss though. As a kid their hair metal era was my favorite and seeing Eric Carr and Bruce Kulick live would be awesome."

AskReddit,fevdpq2,t3_eqp596,1579396224.0,"Before I joined the military I occasionally set a plant on fire and inhaled the resulting smoke. Generally I just snacked more and watched movies and laughed my ass off. No hangover. Life was great. 

One night, I‚Äôm watching a movie. Forget what. I see a cockroach on my wall, and it goes behind my TV. I grab a magazine, roll it up, and walk to the other side of the tv where the roach was, waiting for him to come out. I couldn‚Äôt see him, so I got my head as close to the wall as I could. 

Next thing I know, I‚Äôm on the floor, on my ass, legs splayed out in front of me. My back is against the wall, which means my body went 90 degrees. My pocket knife which was in my back pocket, is about ten feet away from me and open. Weirdest thing, my TV was turned damn near sideways on the stand. 

I sat there for about thirty seconds trying to figure out how this happened. My mom knocked on my bedroom door and asked if I‚Äôm okay. I immediately sobered up and said ‚Äúyeah, I was leaning back in my chair and fell but I‚Äôm good‚Äù (to this day idk if she bought it but it‚Äôs never come up). 

I shook it off, packed another bowl, and tried to watch whatever was on. Never saw that roach. Hope it cured roach cancer or something."
