LegalAdviceUK,ffceyle,t3_esvdoa,1579798013.0,Lots of campers have satellite dishes which are removed or stowed when travelling. I would think they are legal as long as the dimensions of the vehicle are not changed by the installation. What sort of vehicle is it (and I hope you are managing to stay warm)
ukpolitics,ffcd959,t1_ffc8kkc,1579796954.0,I'm happy you have convinced yourself this will be beneficial after I am dead.
dogs,ff5qrbk,t3_errrfh,1579606474.0,"I paddle board with my dog but she is only 35 pounds so it isn't too bad. 80lb could be tricky on any small water craft. Paddle boards are good for dogs in that they are a flat platform and low in the water so recovery is easier. I can't see how a dog get comfy on a kayak but an open canoe would seem a good compromise. Life vests are so useful for dogs, the central handle makes grabbing them out of the water so much easier."

AskReddit,fegdmut,t3_eokwqe,1579088984.0,Nightsoil men used to clear excrement from domestic sceptic pits in the UK before sewers and public health became a thing in the UK. No one misses this job as far as I know (they will have passed away some time ago)

I still drink but rarely have more than 3 pints. I think the 5-2 diet helped in reducing my (rather pathetic) beer belly more than anything else and it also has generally reduced my appetite.

I think a bouyancy aid is a minimum when it is this cold. Wetsuits are not much use, some drysuits get recommended, but you have to be careful it has sufficient flexibility and they are expensive.
