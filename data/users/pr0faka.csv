America, you have disappointed me."
soccer,ff67og7,t1_ff5znyk,1579621087.0,"* There was no VAR during this game - UEFA introduced it in the knockouts last season

* It's very clear in your video that Virgil got the ball first - the yellow card was a bit harsh, a red would be extremely tough

* Virgil did miss the first game against Bayern - you still didn't score then

* Are you seriously butt-hut about it? You guys played very poorly in both games"

football,ff5nuy6,t3_ers5p7,1579602336.0,"This article really missed its own point

1. The gulf between the rich and the poor is getting larger and larger

2. This doesn't happen so much in American sports where the money is divided equally across the leagues

Conclusion: We should keep the rich and the poor in different competitions."
LiverpoolFC,fez801x,t1_fez4y84,1579454640.0,"That's all true, but if Virgil wasn't there then De Gea would have caught the ball"

facepalm,femccqr,t3_epv59d,1579248365.0,"Option 1: We explain in a calm manner that this is exactly what vaccines are and have always been.

Option 2: We proclaim this person a genius, publish the screenshot in medical journals, declare publicly across all possible media, especially social, that the anti-vaxxers have been correct all along and everyone is going to follow their ideas from now on - particularly this one. Give this person the Nobel for medicine for several consecutive years (until the vaccination rates reach the required levels again) and replace Louis Pasteur's name with theirs in all text books and scientific articles.

Which option do you think has a greater chance of increasing the number of vaccinated people?"

LiverpoolFC,fe6qti9,t1_fe6h6ld,1578901061.0,"Mathematically younger - yes, by a year or so

Less experienced in first team competitive matches - absolutely no way. 

Two of the starting defenders and the one who came on in the 9th minute have a total of 0 Premier League appearances. 

Wan-Bissaca might be 22 but he's got over 50 PL starts. Rashford is also 22, but he is currently playing in his 5th PL season. Experience matter more than age.

P.S. You guys did not beat Everton at home."
