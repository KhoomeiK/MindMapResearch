papillon,ffidpwx,t1_ffibosc,1579971424.0,"Oh it is such a weird dynamic. I'm sitting in my recliner right now. Panther (the black cat) is sitting next to me . Sunny the Pap is sitting on top of him as she hides from my wife (it's bath time!) Both our paps absolutely love both our cats. All they want to do is love on and lick the cats, especially their faces. The cats absolutely hate it and run from the dogs. They're not afraid of the dogs, just extremely annoyed by them. The cats have all four of their claws. But they never seriously turned on the dogs. A couple of times Panther got really fed up and took a swipe at the dogs. As he ran in retreat. These two cats are the most docile animals I ever saw. I'll have a cat and two dogs in my lap often."
Petloss,ffd4avg,t3_estx4k,1579813145.0,I wish I had words to say which will take away the pain. But all I can do is offer my prayers that you and your family get the comfort you need. Please feel free to reach out if you need to talk.
sysadmin,ffchjv2,t3_esr8j8,1579799604.0,"Also, what are you using for backups? You'll want to employ the 3-2-1 rule. Three backups, two on a different medium and one stored off-site. On top of that you'll want folder snapshots enabled. While not a backup, it will give quick access to restoring corrupt/accidentally deleted/etc files."
sysadmin,ffbzwvm,t3_esr8j8,1579787930.0,You have a lot of good advice here. But one thing you're missing is a second domain controller. If something happens to your existing DC you're screwed. For an org your size it won't require a lot of horsepower. An older workstation configured as a DC would work.
MINI,ffblp6a,t3_esas8u,1579771487.0,"There’s MINIs at The Glen. It’s a get-together at Watkins Glen International Speedway in Watkins Glen, NY. They didn’t announce the 2020 date yet. For those unfamiliar, WGI is a NASCAR road course in the Finger Lakes region of New York. And it hosts other real cool events like SCCA rallies, a Ferrari race and a vintage car race. Here’s more info:  http://www.minisattheglen.com/about.html. And they have a Facebook too."

aww,ffbk1d7,t3_eskopm,1579768993.0,I’m so sorry you lost your best buddy. I wish I had words that could relieve the pain but we all know that’s not possible. I pray you and your family can get the comfort you need. And don’t be afraid to reach out if you need someone to talk to.
MINI,ff7cfmm,t3_erw2qb,1579646309.0,"I found cleaning the exterior is super easy. What's hard is getting all the crap out of the carpet. I'd recommend a Weathertech floor liner. Yes, you don't have the nice mini floor mats with the logo and all. And you don't see the carpet anymore. But it's so easy to clean. Perhaps swap back in the actual mini floor mats on dry, clean days and/or special occassions."
papillon,ff6qqqq,t1_ff6j1j8,1579632908.0,Sorry but that's hilarious.
papillon,ff6e287,t3_erbj8k,1579625177.0,I'd miss that little snuggley puppy too! Maybe you can facetime with him!
papillon,ff6dyr3,t3_erwrx0,1579625115.0,Our breeder said six months as well. We picked our male up when he was around 16 weeks old. He was humping anything that moved from the minute we met him! He was neutered at six months. He just turned three years old last week. And he STILL humps his sister! We neutered ours because we're not at all interested or equipped to breed puppies. And it was part of the purchase contract with our breeder that we'd neuter as soon as possible after six months.

NASCAR,ff387m4,t3_ere6uj,1579535998.0,Do you have sick days on top of vacation? Or do you get X days off each year regardless of reason? I have vacation days plus sick days. When I take a sick day I just say “taking a sick day”.  They don’t need to know why I’m calling off sick. That’s none of their business. If I call off more than 3 or 5 days in a row (I honestly forget which) I must present a doctors excuse.
papillon,ff34v30,t3_er7cp0,1579533722.0,Why would you do that to a papillon? Ha ha ha ha he looks so confused. It’s the worst time of the month in our house. Even though treats are involved. They sure do hate water.
todayilearned,ff34pmq,t3_ercjcc,1579533617.0,If you’d like more stories like this check out the darknet diaries podcast. Jack Risider does a great job explaining technical stuff like software vulnerabilities and white-hat hacking in a very non-technical way. The articles are quite understandable to a non-technical person.
papillon,ff2p9f9,t3_eqdgmf,1579517578.0,I’m so sorry for your loss. It’s incredibly difficult when we lose any pet. But there’s something even more heartbreaking when it’s a papillon.

MINI,fenjly2,t1_fenj070,1579286095.0,True. Those spark plugs are super easy to get to also. I should have picked  up a spark plug socket when I stopped at Advanced Auto this morning. I was actually thinking of that this morning. But by the time I got to Advance I was in such a rush I forgot. O well.
MINI,fenib2d,t1_fen98jn,1579285296.0,"Not that I can see. But the car also leaks oik (another long story!) so it could be mixed in with that. I went out at lunch and topped off the tank again. the parking lot at work is wet so if anything did leak on the ground it's impossible to tell. I think when I go home tonight I'm gonna put a piece of cardboard under the car and see what colors I see in the morning. Thing is, if it was antifreeze wouldn't the smoke have a smell to it? This stuff has no smell at all. It's weird."
MINI,femqfol,t1_felw27w,1579266580.0,"Drove to work in diagnostic mode watching the temperature. During my 40 mile commute it leveled off between 102 and 105. It hit 106 for a few seconds on an on-ramp. When I parked I did see a puff of smoke from the left headlight area. But it didn't have that distinct antifreeze smell. Well, I'll go out at lunch after she's cooled down and top off the coolant."
MINI,femf6yx,t1_felw27w,1579252333.0,"Thanks! No, I did not bleed it. I thought that was only necessary if the system was opened like if the thermostat was replaced. But I can see how if it did run low air could have been introduced. I’m going to activate diagnostic mode and watch the temperature during my commute this morning. That would be great if it’s just a thermostat."
papillon,feloi43,t3_epthf2,1579227091.0,I’m sorry! It’s the hardest thing any pet owner has to go through. Maybe because I’m partial to paps but I think it’s harder with them. You’re a great puppy parent. And reach out if you need to talk about it.

The PA State Police got the extra gas tax for new buildings and police cars. And who  knows where the rest of the money went. I'm lucky in that I live 5 miles from the NY border and work in New York. I make damn sure my gas tank is filled before I exit New York."
OrthodoxChristianity,fekgtmv,t3_epjugh,1579199752.0,I was just thinking of them earlier this morning! I can't believe the islamists kept them alive for three years. I know we're supposed to pray for our enemies. But I just can't. I don't know if that's a sin. But it's something I'll mention during my next confession.
papillon,fe8slmb,t1_fe8rghu,1578930177.0,Oh nooooooo!!!!  I'm so sorry! It's tough but you did the right thing for all involved. It's the hardest thing any pet owner can do. I hope you all get the comfort you need. Please reach out if  you need to talk.
OrthodoxChristianity,fdzugm8,t3_enfv34,1578796070.0,"None of those sound bad at all! I know it's easy to be self-conscious. But really, don't worry about it. My wife (fiancee at the time) did something kinda in the same vein. She was enrolled as a catechumen at Pascha. The Bishop was there. He presented his hands to kiss. She wasn't aware of this. So she grabbed his hand and shook it. He thought it was hilarious."
papillon,fdwuefa,t1_fdwnjeb,1578762372.0,I'm so sorry! We're sending good thoughts and prayers your way. Who would have thought a small piece of cheeseburger would do that?

rush,fdsdkjc,t1_fds5vbs,1578700209.0,I never got to see them live. There was always some life event that prevented me from seeing them. I knew there wasn't gonna be a tour after R40. But i did think maybe they'd get together for a special one-time Vegas show. And now I don't even have that to hope for.
rush,fdscyp0,t1_fds69yh,1578699792.0,I'm in the same boat. Every time they were nearby there was some life event that prevented me from attending. I knew R40 was gonna be the last. But still couldn't make it. But you know what? We're fans. And that's what counts.
todayilearned,fdrnwyv,t1_fdqrpe0,1578687223.0,That's cool! Would the pilot call mayday or would this be pan pan pan?

papillon,fdovej4,t3_emhvsx,1578613750.0,Another ball lover! ALL our Daytona wants to do is chase a ball. For hours and hours. It’s an unnatural obsession with that ball. Better than chasing my cats though.
AskReddit,fdogite,t3_em9tbw,1578604688.0,This is a fear of mine. Even though I'm innocent. Back years ago I used to download a lot of stuff from Bittorrent. I'm always afraid there was something else in those downloads. Oh I  checked and didn't see anything except what I wanted. But it's always something I'm worried about.
LifeProTips,fd3z051,t1_fcze3au,1578162902.0,"I'm so sick of hearing plastic straws are bad, plastic shopping bags are bad, plastic bottles are bad, etc. Yet these same people don't think twice about flicking a cigarette butt out the car window or while walking down the street. Best one I saw was a lady throwing her cigarette butt out the window while leaving a plastic/aluminum/tin/paper recycling center."

AskReddit,fcx68xu,t1_fcwoe4n,1578052950.0,"I worked for an ISP for a few years. We got one FBI request to identify a customer (suspected child porn distribution). We received a letter sent via FedEx. The letter requested we call the FBI investigator assigned to the case. Yes, it's easy for someone to send a letter that looks legit. But you'd have to call the FBI main number. Which is easily verifiable. Spoofing a phone number is pretty easy. But taking over an existing number is pretty much impossible."
sysadmin,fcv9jfy,t1_fcv6wn9,1577997471.0,"Exactly. I often wonder what these people do when they have to replace a keyboard or move a computer at home. Do they call Best Buy? I'm sure most cases where I work are ""Oh computer broke can't work I'm going to the cafeteria."" And their supervisors are OK with it."
sysadmin,fcv3rai,t1_fcubpss,1577994035.0,"Yes. I'm sick of hearing ""I'm not good at this computer stuff"" coming from medical professionals (the whole gambit, doctors, nurses, nurse assistants). I'm SOOOO tempted to say something like ""Gee, and your whole job revolves around them. Kinda like a truck driver saying I don't like all this driving stuff."""
AskReddit,fcsiboq,t1_fcrv6sx,1577917050.0,You should do an AMA! Not many people have an FIA license. Not many are professional ballet dancers. I'd wager you're the only one who fits both those categories.
IAmA,fcrl1wj,t1_fcrj7i4,1577903203.0,It's called sporadic E skip. The atmosphere has many layers. Some of the layers consist of electromagnetic radiation. This radiation comes and goes and is highly unpredictable. Sometimes a patch becomes electromagnetically active and will reflect radio waves. So the FM radio station broadcasts a radio wave upwards 30 miles and bounces off the E layer. Since it's bouncing from 30 miles up it's like transmitting from a tower 30 miles high. The range ends up being hundreds of miles.

todayilearned,fcimb1u,t1_fcieb4o,1577664955.0,I love Jack's podcast! Jack narrates the stories in a way that you don't have to be a security analyst or a systems analyst to understand the story. He does an amazing job of narrating a technical article in a way someone with a non-technical background can understand.
papillon,fcgwn8y,t3_eh7pjf,1577644765.0,"Story time!  We got Daytona when Sunny was 3. Daytona was 12 weeks old when we brought him home. Sunny hated him. The two cats hated him. Sunny would growl whenever Daytona came near. Daytona just wanted to play and cuddle with his big sister.

We kept them in the kitchen which is fenced off from the rest of the house. Daytona had one section of the kitchen fenced off with a plastic fence between him and Sunny. After three weeks Daytona spent the day chewing a home through the plastic fence. When we came home from work they were sitting together on the pillow bed.

I wish I got to see how they bonded together that day. I bet it started with lots of growls, snapping and barking from Sunny. And ended in pure love. They're a bonded pair now. But there are times (almost daily) that Sunny had enough of Daytona wanting constant play."
