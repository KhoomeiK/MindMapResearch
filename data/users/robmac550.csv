interestingasfuck,ffg7a3q,t1_ffg6are,1579899987.0,If you could create it in lab conditions then I can believe it could occur in nature with the right conditions. Competing thresholds kinda thinking. But I wouldn't dare say it without inviting an avalanche of scoffing redditor experts so I'll just leave it alone. I have cast many Ball Lightnings while playing MTG so I have seen them in action.

If you are referring to the ozone smell from electricity, that's documented fact."

politics,ffg53o2,t3_etfvsl,1579898647.0,Evangelicals still supporting trump is the epitome of sheep behavior.

PoliticalHumor,fffwmdh,t1_fffw9uu,1579893407.0,"Stop with the ""reasoning by analogy"" I was explaining and giving a related example. My reasoning is based on many other factors. Sheesh, how long do i have to make every comment? Do I have to explain every tenet in every post? Take the example as i mean it and agree or disagree. 

Also, that flowery speech is fine for the senate floor but ""Right"" is, and always will be, in the eye of the beholder. Any replacement in the White House will still be flawed as all humans and their endeavors are. Absolute Right is a myth."
PoliticalHumor,fffv1io,t1_fffudgi,1579892409.0,"I used to wonder why the answer to cancer wasn't just cutting the malignant tumor out once or twice a year. Then I found out cutting the big tumor out made the little tumors grow and you still died within 6 months. So thats why you have to endure chemo/radiation if you want any real chance at survival.

Removing trump this way is the cutting out strategy. It'll lead to worse problems. Waiting till November and voting him out is the chemo/radiation approach. Still no guarantee but its the proper way to handle the situation we find ourselves in."
worldnews,ffft2hr,t3_ete500,1579891188.0,"There's no stopping it. Technology is too good and inexpensive. And it works.  Its already part of our lives. If you've been to an airport in the last 15 years you're already tagged. Hell, when I go to my local credit union they don't even ask for my I.D. They knew who I was when I walked in the door. Remember those scenes from the 2002 movie ""Minority Report"" when he's walking through the subway and all the ads changed for him as he walked by? Talk about anticipating the future."
PoliticalHumor,fffqz24,t3_ete7m2,1579889894.0,he did do it. And he has been impeached. Removal?  Its not the right way to make him leave. Its better for the Country if he's voted out in November.

PoliticalHumor,ffelw02,t3_et6euz,1579853645.0,"A thousand upvotes for this. They shoulda played all the pre-2016 election comments about trump from cruz, mcconnell, and graham."
PoliticalHumor,ffelr1t,t3_et7fqn,1579853460.0,"Can't say you're wrong. Personally, I would like to see trump voted out in November but i have no illusion that whoever might replace him is gonna fix everything."

politics,ffbiul3,t3_esjteo,1579767334.0,"Of course. This denialism is intended to come off as strength. Its an attempt to delegitimize the whole idea of impeachment. It's psychology meant to influence the masses. In the short term I think its working. The maga base needs their confidence propped up and the trump/GOP knows it. Can't afford to lose any of that core 35%. In the long term I think they will pay dearly for it with a loss of credibility. There are many many magas pretending trump will be president forever. So the precedents they set today will be called abuses of power tomorrow when someone else occupies the White House. Then, they will deny they did it to themselves lol. So sad..."
