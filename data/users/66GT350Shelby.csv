Theres a reason you dont find onions with the fruits in grocery stores.  Most fruits and vegetables are still alive when you buy them unless they're processed.  They can and will absorb orders from other stronger scented foods.  

Some are worse than others.  Yellow onions aren't that bad normally, but cut one open and let it sit near a lemon all day and see what happens.  Garlic is really bad.

Certain fruits and vegetables also give off a lot of ethylene gas as they mature and ripen.  This will affect other fruits and veggies, especially if they are more sensitive to it.  That's why putting an apple in a closed brown paper bag with unripe bananas, will accelerate the ripening process."

If you dont have a dial indicator to check it with, the easiest thing to do is put a new blade in there and try it.  While you're changing blades, clean and inspect the arbor flange, the nut, and any blade stabilizers it has.  

If it isnt the blade, then it may be the arbor or possibly the bearings.  (Bearings you can usually hear them when they're bad).  

The best way to check it is with a dial indicator.  [Improve-Table-Saw-Performance](https://www.instructables.com/id/Improve-Table-Saw-Performance/) 

There are methods to true up the arbor with a stone if it's the arbor.  If it's the bearing, replace the bearings.

WorldofTanks,ffivw28,t1_ffit9bs,1579983964.0,"It's annoying as hell when I'm trying to grind regular scouts.

It's bad enough that wheelies eat up all of the early spots, and spot me when I'm in a good position.

I got a great spot on the middle road in Lakeville in a game just a few minutes ago.  Killed off their scout there, with only 1 shot from my team assisting me, spotted 3 other TDs, all in the open, all not moving, a med that's an easy shot sitting still, an arty and a Type 4.

Their arty that must have had SS.  He was the Frenchie tier 9 and he took off like a bat out of hell when I spotted him.

What do the tard TDs and meds all shoot at?  The damned super heavy.  All they're doing is giving him an easy Steel Wall.

Meanwhile the closest TD, seeing my team is full of idiots, rushes me.  He takes me out despite me tracking him twice and me trying to scoot away.  He was in full view and an easy shot for at least two of the TDs and a med and every one of them ignored him.

It doesn't seem to matter if you mark them, ping the map, ask for help, or even tell them where you're going before the match starts.  The situational awareness of the average player is fucking horrible 75% of the time.

If you were wondering where the heavies were, 3 of the 4 went valley and got stomped.  One went city with two bottom tier meds and got wiped.  The rest of the team just played with themselves until they got rolled over, what a surprise!

Seven good spots, a kill, 900 damage and less than 400 assisted."

You must be really naive.  People eating their own food is taking up space for **PAYING** customers.  I'm not paying utilities and salaries to take care of you when I'm receiving nothing in return.    

What kind of message do you think that sends to everyone else in the place, when they see someone eating something you're not selling?"

We even encouraged mothers to breast feed if they wished to.  I've had other customers bitching about seeing that and I've told them to politely fuck off.

We had all kinds of soy and vegan options.  I'm running a business.  If you want to eat your own food, then stay home."

I'm currently grinding the Brit and Chinese scouts and hating life.  

I just got out of a game where I got pushed out of a bush by a teammate into the direct fire of three TDs.  I got smoked in short order.  

I had 6 solid spots and only 700 assisted since my idiot TDs and Meds all camped cap except for the fucktard who pushed me out of my bush.  At least our heavies won their flank and we got the win."

You dont get clogged arteries unless you're eating too much meat or animal products.  

Your teeth are proof all by themselves that we are omnivores.  We have a mixture of teeth, some designed to eat and tear flesh and others designed to eat and grind up plants. 

Our digestive tract is also designed to take advantage of an omnivore diet.  We, like other natural omnivores. have a blend of the types that herbivores and carnivores have.

Our biochemistry is also designed to take advantage of being omnivores.  We need vitamin B12 in our diet which isnt available in plants.  We also need vitamin C, which isnt available in animals.

I could go on, but you're probably exhausted from reading this much, since you dont get enough nutrition in your diet."

TalesFromRetail,ffhkv8n,t3_ethj9z,1579940004.0,"That's considered return fraud in many states.  

When I was a retail manager, I shut down several customers after catching them doing stuff like this.

At one place I worked at, we used to have a 200% guarantee on fresh products.  You could return it, get your money back and a free replacement if you were unhappy with it.  If the customer insisted they didnt want a replacement, we offered them double cash back.  I banned several people for abusing this.

The worst one I remember, was a lady who was buying entire unopened packs of deli meat from the deli counter.  These will cost 60-90 dollars each, depending on the type and weight.  She would then return it a several days later for a 200% cash refund.  

**She was doing this every week.**  Not only at our store but, at every location we had in a thirty mile radius.  I figured out she was hitting a different store almost every day, and making about 100-150 a day doing this,  

The look on her face when I confronted her was priceless.  She was permanently banned from all of our locations.  I hit her up with a no trespass order, and told her she would be arrested if she was so much as seen in the parking lot.  A few weeks later she was caught in a store trying the same thing about 50 miles away and was arrested."
