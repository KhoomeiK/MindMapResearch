badwomensanatomy,fg0gkxg,t1_fg09406,1580407362.0,bodies are different. im a woman and i’ve been trying to put on weight my whole life. my brother gains much more easily than i do. i’ve given up on it. it could be more genetics than your sex.

GenderCritical,ffsbmfi,t3_euv8yd,1580177852.0,dude has a personality disorder for sure. cut him off.
medizzy,ffsajdt,t1_ffrc535,1580177124.0,someone posted a link to article above. she can’t breathe through her nose or smell. she can’t see well either.
LGBDropTheT,ffrom85,t1_ffrmmpw,1580162394.0,it’s not that common at all. it’s mostly a porn thing. you can make yourself do it if you want. some women can’t help it. it depends. but it’s not always or even ever.
AskDocs,ffn67ku,t3_eu9thu,1580062463.0,"i’ve struggled with depression and not being able to eat. it’s very hard, so don’t beat yourself up about it. try to get a routine. eat food that is easily accessible to you or pre-prepared. don’t be afraid of eating junk food, it’s better than nothing. drink a lot of water. make sure your stomach doesn’t get used to eating too little because it’ll make it hard to get in full meals in the long run. protein packed food is your friend. make sure you’re still eating fruits and vegetables every now and then. definitely talk to your doctor in the meantime."
GenderCritical,ffkco6j,t3_eu05x7,1580020594.0,i’ve always wondered what you can do to help these women. would it be out of place to offer them some cash? a place to stay at night? are they even in a position to make these kinds of decisions for themselves?
GenderCritical,ffk8w5f,t1_ffjwswt,1580018883.0,"makeup has existed as a cultural practice since humans have been around. we have been painting our bodies and decorating ourselves for every reason possible. it’s one of the few things that set us apart from other species. we are self aware and we express with our bodies. of course altering your body to look more attractive is sad, and capitalism motivated, but when makeup is bright and strange looking and easily identifiable as out of the norm, true self expression, i have no problem with it. that’s absolutely a natural proclivity humans have."
GenderCritical,ffduj82,t1_ffdt87h,1579829267.0,it doesn’t give the option
GenderCritical,ffdh81f,t1_ffdcl58,1579820806.0,is there a way to report these? god.. people make me sick.
badwomensanatomy,ffagqte,t1_ffaaei2,1579735363.0,good luck. it’s tough but you’ll feel better

badwomensanatomy,ffa76ct,t1_ff8vpkj,1579729206.0,no...
thegooddoctor,ff72mc7,t3_ervp7u,1579639878.0,i think the writers are blissfully unaware of how a hospital actually works. don’t think about it too hard.
LGBDropTheT,ff7258i,t1_ff60pku,1579639609.0,i think it’s just low hanging fruit for people who want to make fast money. they claim a woke story line and get all these woke supporters behind them. they drag viewers in so people can feel good about supporting something woke. they make a ton of money. the show dies out and the actual people with real problems are worse off and now painted in a bad light. ‘representation’. as if. they’re doing anyone they claim to help a total disservice.
LGBDropTheT,ff71twn,t1_ff6ka7a,1579639440.0,"well superheroes have always been about politics, and i think it’s okay that the stories change to match today’s atmosphere. the difference is that back then they handled it with grace and kept to real societal problems, like the rich hoarding wealth and evil corporations. now it’s, oh, they hurt my feelings."

if you can’t put in the time to train him and build a bond, then i’d rather the shelter. you’re looking at a lifetime of discomfort."
cats,ff6n1y6,t1_ff6mybq,1579630693.0,"then try getting it more scratching posts and interactive toys, while working up to build that trust with it. declawing will only cause your cat pain.

edit: i noticed you said he’s destroying furniture. try putting scratch posts next to those places because it could just be he’s trying to mark his home and has nothing else to do it on"
cats,ff6lasn,t1_ff6kbqk,1579629624.0,just clip their nails
TrollXChromosomes,ff6f4lt,t1_ff6bhqj,1579625836.0,that’s her point
LGBTnews,ff4c21u,t1_ff4bx10,1579560088.0,not really funny. trans people are still outcast and the culture is very harmful for anyone out of the norm. gay people who refuse are criminalized.
LGBTnews,ff4bv1g,t1_ff45gig,1579559963.0,yea
cats,ff3ulp1,t3_er6bio,1579549193.0,the bowl might be too deep. they don’t like when their whiskers brush against things.
TrollXChromosomes,ff3jzf5,t1_ff3aepk,1579542667.0,"3 is... very very young for chores. let them be children.

edit: ‘helping’ is fine i just don’t like the impression that they’re assigned full difficult tasks like scrubbing dishes"
CatOwnerProblems,fewurkg,t3_e7esbv,1579419803.0,"this is really late, but for anyone else still looking, have you tried moistening the pellets with water?"
GenderCritical,few1rrn,t3_eqp1a7,1579404266.0,"same boat. i’m also 19 and on tumblr. the key is following people who get you so you don’t go crazy. stay low key, but always stand your ground."
badwomensanatomy,fesoptd,t1_fermjea,1579367488.0,"it certainly does. also hens and women are compared at times, when women are said to be gossipy and cliquey.  cows are just the most undesirable female of these animals. they’re large and swollen and constantly reproducing."
GenderCritical,fep4sa4,t3_eq696p,1579312125.0,the only reason i bought into it back then is because i felt like a normal person. when you’re a woman you’re not suppose to be a real person. i didn’t know this. i just never felt like a woman or anything. i just was. it’s fucked up.
Showerthoughts,fenmrz8,t1_femh25v,1579288010.0,"not safe, though. you could get bacteria trapped under the lens."

i like this one better, because it’s a scientific paper. harder to read, but less biased. the wording of the former is iffy."
GenderCritical,fej0rbu,t1_fehs7e5,1579152801.0,"i think you’d like to know women’s muscles are more efficient at oxygen uptake, which is why they’re harder to build because they take longer to tire out. you have to tire out a muscle so it can grow. this isn’t really a negative, just a different positive. you can definitely hold out your max weight longer than they can hold theirs, even if their weight is bigger. might make you feel better next time :-)"
GothStyle,feiw0qj,t3_ep8zuw,1579148740.0,i love your boots! they’re so cute. i wish i could pull those off as well :•)
pointlesslygendered,fefvrbo,t1_feeqd6t,1579066779.0,"yes, i’ve worn men’s and women’s clothes often. i prefer women’s because i like them to fit my body shape, but they’re very flimsy and i miss the deep pockets, thick fabric, and durability. it’s very hard for me to find pants i like that fit right on my body. they hardly make loose pants for young women anymore."

TrollXChromosomes,fedvf14,t1_fedp91q,1579020719.0,"yeah, i don’t know what they’re saying. laptops can comfortably get VERY hot and it’s just like a warm bath to them. if you’re really concerned, get a cooling pad."
TrollXChromosomes,fedvaz1,t1_fedrdsl,1579020652.0,"doubt it works on eggs, eggs are meant to be in a hot environment like the human body. they’re just cells, like every other cell."
pointlesslygendered,fedv62s,t1_feduo5f,1579020571.0,i’m guessing you’ve never worn women’s clothes.
genetics,fecs62d,t3_eocn59,1578982566.0,"it definitely has to do with a different way of thinking, a different way of processing information. i believe if something like autism is hereditary, then what else could there be, that alters typical brain pathways like that? musical talent could certainly be a side effect."
