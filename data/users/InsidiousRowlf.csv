The models and textures are based on real world imagery, mapped to 3D by friggin awesome technology. This does produce some weird looking objects if they contain too small details like vegetation or cars parked closely, these will look more like low-poly blobs with texture smeared over, but from above it's not too easy to notice. They will need to be replaced with more manually fabricated models if we want to rid them of weird shapes (in previous flight sim. versions this was the job of autogen)."
