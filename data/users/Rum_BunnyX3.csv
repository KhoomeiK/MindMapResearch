OldSchoolCool,ffeb0vw,t1_ffe4ov4,1579841736.0,I'm more than happy with the guy I've been with since I was 16. We just celebrated our 9th anniversary. Every body is different. I was never one who really wanted to play the field. My partner is my best friend. We met young but that doesn't diminish what we have. It hasn't always been easy and we both had/ have tons of growing up to do but I wouldn't trade it for the world. If you want to play the field then play the field but everyone has their own unique paths. Not everyone wants to go in and out of numerous relationships/ hookups. We aren't married yet but age doesn't dictate when you should get married. It's whenever you feel ready.
dogpictures,ffealpx,t3_et4uqk,1579841365.0,I hope she is okay. I hope that sneaking her out means you are keeping her. I too have a pup named Bella that I got out of an abusive situation but she is like 1/5th of your Bella's size lol. Fingers crossed that you and her are both safe.
OldSchoolCool,ffdk1fu,t3_et0an1,1579822524.0,Happy birthday! I just turned 25 today myself. I'm a quarter of the way there lol.
gaming,ff1ezk5,t1_ff0bfei,1579478344.0,I'm still playing New Leaf. new Leaf is what brought me back into gaming and has helped me cope with my anxiety so much. I never thought that I would get so much joy from my partner's old 3DS. I can't wait for New Horizons. It will be well worth the wait :)
AskReddit,fem6vct,t3_ept2fn,1579241868.0,3 ankle surgeries later and I still have a bent tibia. If I'm lucky I will be able to endure the pain long enough to wait until I'm in my mid 40s to have my final surgery and I become completely disabled. Let's just say I won't be running ant marathons any time soon.
Baking,fem04zv,t3_epuo0l,1579235537.0,This is seriously so sweet. I bet she really appreciated this. What type of cake was it?
news,feitfqh,t1_feiq049,1579146751.0,"They sell ""dried flower"" but you are only allowed to vaporize it apparently. You are not allowed to smoke it or even say you are going to smoke it."
news,feifiec,t1_fehpt5c,1579137320.0,"I don't understand why Ohio even bothered doing medical. I've been trying to get medical for like a year and the process is like pulling teeth. My dad is going through the same thing and he just said fuck it and we both just buy off ""the black market"". It is such a disgrace. We both have conditions that qualify us for medical hands down but the process is expensive and from what we've heard the medical stuff here isn't even that great. It's also insanely expensive. I wouldn't mind spending a little more on stuff if it was truly worth it. I might even feel better if i knew that I was somewhat contributing through the taxes on it but in Ohio they would rather us buy guns and booze."
Baking,fefo36f,t3_eoslmg,1579060592.0,I know I'm a little later here but the colors look phenomenal! Absolutely gorgeous. Thank you for sharing :)
AskReddit,fds1klr,t1_fdr1ivw,1578692958.0,"My dad used Hertz for years. Every time we took a vacation he rented a car from them. The last time he used their service he was picking up a rental in New York to drive us home. The car he had rented wasn't there, the only option available to him was a shitty dodge charger that smelled horrible inside. After over half an hour of arguing with a horribly rude employee he wasn't getting anywhere and was forced to just take the charger so we could just get home. We were exhausted after a 7 hour flight and we just didn't want to argue anymore. The charger barely held all 4 of us and our luggage from a 2 week trip. We were cramped and uncomfortable for our 9 hour drive back to Ohio. The icing on the cake was discovered 6 hours after we left the airport in New York when we stopped at a gas station and discovered that the employee never gave my dad his credit card or driver's licence back after he picked up the car. It was somewhat a mistake on my dad's part but the employee never even made an attempt to contact my dad to alert him of the mistake. He spent 2 hours on the phone with customer service to facilitate the return of his license and credit card. They made such an ordeal for us for what should have been something relatively simple. Their mistake made for a very miserable drive back to Ohio and they never even apologized. We never rented from them again."

memes,fdjbrhg,t3_elmpcp,1578464519.0,Idk why but this meme template is so underrated. That face gets me every time.
dogpictures,fdihtn0,t3_elgwh7,1578443239.0,I love it! Where did you get it?? My dad would lose it for one of his beloved pup.
politics,fd4h0m0,t1_fd3yfp4,1578167386.0,"I live in northern Ohio and there are even people like that here. I don't think I will ever understand. I know people on food stamps, using medicare and that get SSI that voted for him. They seriously just don't get it."
Baking,fcz95j9,t1_fcyzz0g,1578096182.0,I recommend going sooner than later. Lots of them are starting to close. I just worked a seasonal job at a pier 1 and I'm not sure how long the stores will be around. Plus they have tons of sales now since it's right after the holidays.
poodles,fcuzkoa,t3_ej0xdy,1577991648.0,I wish button well. It's so hard watching our pups fight health issues. Hugs to both of you. He has the sweetest little face. Happy new year!

dogpictures,fct410a,t3_eipf79,1577932312.0,My guess is a mix that has some chow or maybe even akita. The bear like face is super chow like.
trashy,fc8zhqi,t1_fc86fua,1577544587.0,God that last part would kill me. I would have someone literally having their last moments in one room then another resident would be calling the nurse' station because I'm not getting them their water fast enough. It was so hard not to say anything sometimes. Glad your wife got out of it too. That industry is a killer.
trashy,fc7lvtx,t1_fc7jzmw,1577511697.0,"I just couldn't do it anymore. Everything hurt. My body, my mind and my heart. I worked my ass off. I worked 10 - 14 hour shifts. I was overworked. The nursing homes I worked at were severely understaffed. I would be subject to physical, sexual and verbal abuse at the hands of our residents. I've been kicked, punched, slapped, bitten, pinched and so forth. I would watch my residents suffer and some of them pass away. I've cleaned my patients after they passed on and so much more. And I did all of this for $10 an hour. I still will occasionally have dreams where I hear call lights and I wake up in a panic thinking there is someone who needs something."
trashy,fc7lh4l,t1_fc7h1c6,1577511293.0,Yes please. Using underpaid and exhausted human beings isn't working very well. Something needs to change.
trashy,fc7lf0b,t1_fc7foyl,1577511237.0,"As much as I hate to admit it, this is a very real thing."
trashy,fc7ldzg,t1_fc7d54h,1577511209.0,That would definitely be something that I would consider when I have the time. I have so many stories and have seen some shit (literally and figuratively).
dogpictures,fc7fl5u,t3_egi2u0,1577505943.0,I'm not a morning person but that face would sure be incentive enough. He is so adorable!!
trashy,fc7caqo,t1_fc79b9i,1577503255.0,"I was a nurse aide for over 6 years. I really hate to admit this but it really started to give me a special dislike for elderly people. It was quite frequent that my patients were just awful and didn't care about anything or anyone except for themselves. A lot of them were truly sick but there was a decent percentage who were still with it mentally (and many times physically as well). A lot of them were just horribly cruel. They were openly racist, would regularly assault staff members and other patients (some of whom were horribly sick and completely unaware), lied to their families and so so much more. I have quite a few horror stories from my time as an aide. I let my license lapse after I decided I needed a new occupation. I was so burned out and my physical health was depleting quickly. I would never want to work in nursing homes again."
dogpictures,fc0ydy9,t3_efhc5l,1577303045.0,Omg he is so stinkin cute! Who is the linkin park fan??
OldSchoolCool,fbzlw9n,t1_fbzfkbe,1577251157.0,What are the early signs? I am starting to feel concerned that my mother is starting to act very bizarre. She is only 62 but Alzheimer's and dementia run in her family. Her heavy drinking doesn't seem to help either.
