AskReddit,ffsaj1g,t1_ffpbdqf,1580177117.0,"YES. It is a survival skill. I know a guy like this. Stereotypical struggling and irresponsible musician. Just cries after every break up to the next woman about how he's such a nice guy and just can't find love.


He legitimately had something pretty bad happen to him, but I think he’s just always been like this. He’s a total man child BUT it works in that it naturally filters for compassionate women (suckers) that will step in and play mommy to him."
AskReddit,ffsa9n9,t1_ffp7h5a,1580176944.0,"I know a guy like this. He's a struggling musician. Nice guy but total manchild. I'm convinced he does it to try and get women to take care of him, emotionally and otherwise. 


It works on a certain kind of compassionate woman, especially because most men just aren’t as emotionally in touch with themselves."

Let her go. Tell her lovingly and compassionately. Be prepared for anger. 


Please double up on birth control. You should look into a vasectomy. Both my H and I are snipped. :)"

And Cupid was helping in some way."

The police may be pressuring you into cremation to hide evidence of something. I am sorry to say that the police in Mexico are particularly corrupt. They do not have your best interests in mind and they may lie and intentionally obfuscate. 

I would follow the excellent advice of  u/aumericanbaby. 

I am so sorry for your loss. I can't imagine the stress of dealing with this."
nonmonogamy,fffsi66,t1_fffp3za,1579890838.0,"I am gobsmacked at how inconsiderate people are. But my therapist tells me I tend to be over-responsible for others' feelings. 

She needs to speak up but honestly it's kind of late at this point to reneg on the moving in part. 


I don't know how she thought she could be okay with this, but learning experience I guess."
nonmonogamy,fffryxi,t1_fffl0n0,1579890508.0,"Agreed, this sounds like a living hell. 

But then, I would never ask my H to move in my boyfriend. And I'd never be cool with my H moving in a girl. We are happily hierarchical."

nonmonogamy,ffcct3t,t1_ffac8ro,1579796677.0,"This, right here. 

Society conditions men to believe being a good provider is what makes them attractive to women. (Good job, educated, reliable, etc.) BUT if a guy already has a wife, those won’t help him when it comes to finding a secondary. 

What will? Being a great conversationalist, physically fit, attractive, having sex/fetish skills, flexible schedule. 

You have to be someone a woman is excited to spend time with DESPITE her not being able to reap the benefits of a man as a nesting partner."
Flamenco,feoqlel,t1_femqmoa,1579304049.0,"I want to second this, I found an excellent Flamenco guitar teacher BUT he had a hard time teaching me as a beginner. It required a lot of patience and communication on both our ends.

It would’ve gone much smoother had I first taken some classical guitar lessons."
Flamenco,feoq94a,t3_epz731,1579303844.0,"I did this. Decided I wanted to learn flamenco despite never having played. 

I'd recommend you start with classical guitar lessons. Then once you have a grasp of it, jump into flamenco. 

My flamenco progress was delayed because I needed to get some basic guitar techniques down."
childfree,feklp8x,t1_fechtko,1579202653.0,"My favorite musicians are ones who do it as a side gig to a more practical profession. I'm a lawyer and write fiction and play music on the side. It's just good foresight to have a ""practical"" day job that pays the bills - unless you hit gold! Or unless you worked out a financially feasible arrangement. 


My issue is with the musicians that date women and end up expecting them to be their sugar mommas."

Best of luck."
nonmonogamy,fejyhbr,t3_eph0c1,1579188723.0,"I’m also a bit love avoidant. I’m rarely attracted to people enough to have feelings for them. 

It’s okay for you to have preferences for one night stands. It's okay for you to love the way you do. It's OKAY not to want the drama and bullshit of a triad when you're not even poly. 

IT IS NOT okay for your boyfriend to shame you for your love style so he can have two women. It's NOT okay to ask you to be OK with him taking out other women while demanding that you not see any other men. That is some serious hypocrisy.

if I were you, I'd tell him that you’re only OK with him taking out all these other women if he’s fine with you dating other men. That will force him to deal with Uncomfortable insecurities he has and maybe will trigger some empathy on his part for your own discomforts. 

Posts like these make me glad I’m a straight woman that doesn’t have to deal with these double standards."

childfree,fea1coo,t1_fe9vy08,1578943311.0,"Pmed you the genre. 


And I started laughing because that is exactly the phrasing he used when I mentioned my H had a vasectomy. ""If you wanted, I'd give you a baby."" I was like, LOL no. 


He was baffled. Like he couldn't understand it. To be fair, his female friends are desperate for marriage and a baby, but they're honestly losers too. 


Dude, I'm a married, financially stable professional. If I wanted a baby,I'd have one by now. 


Honestly, I think a lot of them are irresponsible manchildren who skate through life by forcing women to do all the work for them.

childfree,fe5x38b,t1_fe55mku,1578876884.0,"Agree with this. I was born to a Mexican family and it is much more manageable when you have extended family always around. 


The nuclear family and the break up of even that, imo, is a large part of why kids are so mentally ill and fucked up in the US.  They have no adult support apart from exhausted and overworked mom and dad."
Dracula,fe5060j,t1_fe1ok1u,1578864455.0,That's a good point I didn't think of. How she only really died when she lost her looks.
Dracula,fe05lrb,t1_fe00qlf,1578803622.0,"I thought it would have made more sense if Lucy had been some beautiful Gothic girl who was obsessed with the idea of death. Into the occult and such. As opposed to some random Instagram girl who lived to club and party. 


It would’ve made more sense, considering the theory that Dracula was fascinated by this person because she had no fear of death."
offmychest,fdsq4ei,t1_fdsl1g7,1578706490.0,"Yes that's big, knowing when to ask for help. Unfortunately the adults around me were so fucked up as a child. I was basically a small adult from childhood which is NOT a good thing."
offmychest,fdrjet5,t1_fdpzl9s,1578685321.0,"Want to say I went through similar as a child. Abusive stepfather and a mother with a disability. 

Life was INSTANTLY better for me when I moved out and I have so many less problems as a responsible adult.


I hope your life got better too. I know I still carry scars and have had a lot of therapy."
offmychest,fdrirxf,t1_fdpyyde,1578685139.0,"Great post. Not much to add, but I am 33 and life is MUCH easier now than when I was a helpless child in an abusive household. Now, I make my own money, look out for myself, and can cut out toxic people. 


Children can't do that. Children are dependent on the adults around them. And when you're a kid living in a house with an abusive stepfather and a mother with an intellectual disability, life really can get a whole lot better as an adult."

I honestly loved it, it's fast and made me feel energetic and satiated. I still make it myself when I'm in a hurry or feel like I've been eating like crap. 


But I did it on my own not with some overpriced BS company."
antiMLM,fdqhszv,t1_fdpez9q,1578667015.0,"I made my own keto coffee when I was doing keto. It's honestly awesome - energizing and kept me satiated. But all I used was my normal morning coffee, and a spoonful of butter and coconut oil.

nonmonogamy,fdj6hwz,t3_eljfdi,1578459812.0,This happens to me. I think I mentally prepare for abandonment by distancing myself emotionally.  I choose to put more effort into being affectionate with my primary when this happens.
AmItheAsshole,fdg0x8a,t1_fdf97rr,1578376014.0,"These people are nuts. Not everyone who takes pride in being fit and trim has BDD. Lots of women are shocked and dismayed by post pregnancy bodies. 


You sound like you're seeing a therapist. If the therapist thinks you have a healthy attitude about it, you do you. Everyone and their brother has a damn opinion on women's bodies before, during, and after they get knocked up. Everyone swears women should sacrifice everything for motherhood. Fuck that. If you want that breast augmentation go for it."
AmItheAsshole,fdg0p1c,t1_fdf71j7,1578375793.0,"I totally get this. Honestly one of the many reasons I'm childfree. I also take pride in being fit and trim. Not everyone bounces back from pregnancy with all the changes. 


Get therapy sure but if you're certain this is your last child, I'd go ahead and get the surgery."

But at the time I was into actual humiliation. I found a sadist who had a Madonna whore complex and that was legitimately authentic. And turned out crazy unhealthy because he was a major asshole. 


Anyway. I'm more into genuine connections now but I still have some fetishes, like being tied up and edged. 


Honestky though bdsm helped me work out a lot of issues I had from childhood abuse. I'm much healthier mentally now and I don't think it's a coincidence that I no longer care for the intense humiliation."

I had a dream about a hot gay charming coworker I had doing this and I woke up so turned on. Makes sense. Gay men aren't attracted to women so the humiliation would be more authentic."
