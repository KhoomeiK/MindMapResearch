AustralianPolitics,ffh39vo,t1_ffh1i9o,1579921930.0,What are your suggestions to get these countries more in line? What would you do
AustralianPolitics,ffh1osh,t1_ffguuqx,1579920731.0,Australia is trying to reduce carbon emissions. Where are you getting that they are not?
AustralianPolitics,ffgzm8e,t1_ffgxfgw,1579919166.0,"Very selective on the wording. Atmosphere, eh? How about environmentally? Their rivers are disgusting and they just dump whatever wherever. They dump billions of cubic feet of trash into the OCEAN yearly. 

But they accept climate change and ""science"" so they are a-ok and basically climate superheroes"
basketballcards,ffgvfdg,t3_et3fyh,1579916057.0,Didnt know dollar tree had backs. That's not bad. Any chance of anything beyond base?
basketballcards,ffgvaq7,t3_eth3wc,1579915962.0,Grab the donruss. I got a orange laser Ja Morant and Steph today with a Steven Adams Jersey patch as well. Shit ton of rookies too. Great value.
AustralianPolitics,ffguo1m,t1_ffgu5pr,1579915509.0,"Deflecting? Because I mentioned china?

And I'm a conspiracy theorist? You are here supporting a doomsday clock. Look in the mirror ffs"
AustralianPolitics,ffgoim0,t3_et9dpc,1579911077.0,Globalist propaganda tool is telling us that we need more government intervention and they need more of our tax dollars. Seems very trustworthy.
AustralianPolitics,ffgocn7,t3_et9dpc,1579910959.0,"Its quite obvious that if Australia wouldve just accepted climate change as fact and spent millions then it couldve prevented these fires.

Also, does China accept climate change? They seem to be polluting an awful amount. Maybe the doomsday clock can go talk to them."
worldpolitics,ffftmef,t1_fffrpls,1579891530.0,"Who is ""they""? Trump supporters? That's your opinion. Most are not saying that shit."

apexlegends,ffdm7a4,t3_et1b07,1579823849.0,Just mute them. Who cares.
progun,ffdkq2m,t1_ffddd0k,1579822937.0,They think the Barrett is hiding under long gun classification. They probably assume long guns mean muskets from the civil war and anything not a musket and considered a long gun should be banned. Something along those lines I'm guessing
cats,ffdk1yf,t3_et0gzt,1579822533.0,Why do cats do this? My 2 do it all the time on mirrors and doors
Entrepreneur,ffdixkd,t3_esx5b1,1579821841.0,"What's crazy is that whenever I go to the store, I usually look for basketball and football. And baseball is always just sitting there untouched. I assume the older cards have the most value and biggest market. Doesnt seem like many people are interested in baseball as opposed to basketball currently. Do you sell any new basketball stuff??"
hearthstone,ffb304i,t3_eskqo1,1579750492.0,"I got this 10/10 golden legendary, can't remember the name but I dusted it and got a bunch of cool cards that a wanted. Feels good man.

But I have 2 quests for challenging and watching a friend, but no friends that play. Pls add: jodyhiroller. Thank you"
AskReddit,ffasij3,t3_esl4ne,1579743472.0,I used to get a cup of pickles at McDonald's and they would give you like a handful. Sometimes they put them in a burger box. McDonalds are always so good
fakecartridges,ff9ukuq,t1_ff6pewh,1579721709.0,Ya it's almost as if dispensaries are floating around misinformation to get people into their stores and off the streets by scaring them. They want to diminish the trust of the streets so they can wax you on prices PLUS TAX. It's crazy. That's my theory.
fakecartridges,ff9udku,t1_ff6t4dw,1579721550.0,You really did tho

fakecartridges,ff6phr3,t1_ff63tse,1579632163.0,Are you retarded? Michigan actually has some cheap prices. You can get great carts for 40 plus tax
fakecartridges,ff6pbrg,t3_eroh9j,1579632064.0,I wouldnt buy from anyone who talks like that
fakecartridges,ff6p9p0,t1_ff6jt22,1579632030.0,Lmao REKT
fakecartridges,ff6p6lh,t1_ff6e9wo,1579631979.0,"Ya this guy I know who grows, made a bunch of carts and they were $8 a piece. But half grams. His own distillate too."
fakecartridges,ff6p20c,t1_ff69hkp,1579631902.0,40 per cart is the cost to the consumer. Anyones plug is not getting them for 40. They get them for around 20. Do you think dispensaries dont upcharge on them just like the streets?
fakehistoryporn,ff6n5nh,t3_ernmz4,1579630754.0,Alright this is very terrifying and EXTREMELY problematic. I never would have thought Joe wouldve done something like this. That lady looks like she did nothing wrong! I hope Snopes can see if this is altered in some way. It has to be!!
PoliticalHumor,ff6mcn5,t3_ertxgu,1579630268.0,"Wow that was so humorous.

I wonder what this guy would call antifa rallies?"
