As a matter of course all the timber that comes in to the yard is X rayed for nails/ screws/ barb wire etc to make sure it doesn't hit and blunt the blades they use. One day they notice an odd shape wedge on the x-ray, in the crook of some branches. They do some investigating. Turns out it was an old flint lock pistol.
