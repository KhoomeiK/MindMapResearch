Music,ffniz8l,t1_ffm32xt,1580066537.0,Man I hate how popular that myth is. Ringo was a killer drummer and gets so much disrespect from non-drummers.
Guitar,ffl9068,t3_eu5ccx,1580036553.0,"Full time programmer here. Get an ergonomic keyboard and mouse, and you will never have an issue with wrist pain from your job again."
drums,ffk5h9q,t3_eu1rd1,1580016500.0,"First off, people in YouTube comments are a different breed. They’ll shit on anything, they’ll be overzealous about anything. Wouldn’t take any of it seriously, most of them just want to be contrarian.

That said, Roger Taylor is for sure a great drummer. Great drummers play drums in a way that makes great music. He’s versatile and has some unique style here and there. I know Taylor Hawkins was a huge fan of his growing up, which definitely says something."
guitarpedals,ffk27pu,t1_ffk1zjb,1580013543.0,"Yeah still a fun idea, congrats on the sales! Always great to be able to make some change off of a hobby."
guitarpedals,ffk1qpf,t3_eu0wrb,1580013143.0,Is this not kinda dangerous? Seems like it might put some awkward force on the input jack
blursedimages,ffjc4z9,t1_ffj98u1,1579995193.0,"I honestly don’t even see what we were arguing about, I was just trying to add some perspective that you might not have considered before. 

You’re absolutely gonna change your mind about hundreds of things in the next 10 years, which is a good thing that we all go through. No need to block out other perspectives man. When I was your age I was on the complete opposite end of the political spectrum than I am now for example.

Not everything’s an argument, some conversations are just conversations."
blursedimages,ffj94om,t1_ffj83ah,1579993364.0,"Right, so the same way that you feel compelled to keep her out of trouble is the same sense of obligation that Greta feels about being a climate activist. I’m sure she enjoys being on the receiving end of the vitriol of millions as much as you enjoy having to keep your mom safe and out of trouble from her addiction. That’s all I’m tryna say.

And I think both you and Greta show great strength and maturity in taking responsibility like that, so kudos to you."
blursedimages,ffj5e6o,t1_ffj4qy1,1579990834.0,"Nah you’re missing the point. The “I should be in school” is a way of saying that kids shouldn’t have to worry about policing older generations in order to prevent catastrophes. But the fact of the matter is that the majority of those in positions of power have proven to be content with inaction, and catastrophe *will* occur the longer we go without action, so younger generations have to take action to avoid getting hit by catastrophe in the future. 

Another analogy is that it’s like someone your age having to keep their alcoholic mother from getting into trouble. It simply shouldn’t be their responsibility."
gaming,ffgz4mf,t1_fffg6pc,1579918800.0,What’s the kind of wisdom where you have the exact opposite experience?
gaming,ffgz0hk,t1_ffffq3f,1579918713.0,"This is not even close to being universally true. You may have more day to day freedom/flexibility in college, but you get to actually enjoy your free time after (without constantly having homework/tests on your mind) and you get significantly more income to spend on the things you enjoy doing.

Also, just what an asshole thing to say... “Lol you don’t enjoy life now and yet you’re never going to enjoy it in the future!” Fuck off with that projection shit, misery loves company I guess."

Music,ffgfsvl,t1_fffl6uj,1579905259.0,I’m impressed at how you’ve managed to get weirdly defensive from a guy poking fun at Coachella culture.
Music,fffi586,t1_fffhisx,1579884474.0,"Cmon, Coachella demographic in 2020 is obviously a bit different than ‘99."
synthesizers,ffajagw,t3_eshwag,1579737118.0,I had this pretty severely on the first one I got. Returned it for a different one that didn’t have the issue.
Guitar,ff85vzk,t3_es078x,1579666861.0,"Jesus Christ, just take yourself less seriously. I sure as fuck know I could’t play that dragon force shit from GH3 when I was a kid, just laugh it off and move on. People are more likely to fuck with you if it actually gets to you."
synthesizers,fezqtkl,t1_few40uv,1579460487.0,"> Yeah, but who said it was his primary motive? 

The guy I replied to, who literally said “it’s more of a financial asset than anything else”"
drums,fetsq0h,t1_ferukte,1579379618.0,"It’s crazy how far they’ve come though. I thought I would never be able to get a drum set again until years from now when I have a place with more space / no roommates, but the mesh sets like the TD17KVX scratch 90% of the itch for me

And anyone saying it doesn’t transfer to acoustic is crazy imo. Consider the amount of time that professionals have spent on practice pads, which are way further from a natural acoustic head response than mesh heads..."
synthesizers,feq6tek,t1_feorbnv,1579338344.0,"There are a *lot* of better investment vehicles than a vintage guitar, you don’t buy that with being a “financial asset” as a primary motive."
dataisbeautiful,feperse,t1_fep0ck6,1579318697.0,"It’s also supposed to be boyfriend, not girlfriend"
NetflixBestOf,fencvns,t1_fel2j3f,1579281978.0,"Sounds like synthetic weed, I have never heard of anyone having an experience anything like that on actual weed (most people’s first time they think the weed didn’t work, or they just giggle a bit more than usual), but everyone I know who has tried synthetic weed has had similar experiences and it kept them from ever trying real weed which is a shame.

Only thing that comes close to that with real weed is taking a crazy strong edible, but even then it’s more paranoia or being worried and self-preservative about your own health"
