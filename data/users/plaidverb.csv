Ubuntu,ffc3urw,t3_estew2,1579790879.0,"The issue is that GRUB is failing, but the computer doesn't know that; it's simply booting exactly what it's been asked to boot.

If you can't get into the picker by holding option on boot, try the following:

\- Boot into recovery mode with your liveusb plugged in, and look through the menus for 'startup disk' or something of the kind and select your USB.  If there is no 'startup disk' option, or if your USB doesn't show up, you can try the nuclear option:

\- Find disk utility in the menus, and delete the linux partiton(s) (you probably only have to delete the boot partition, but it sounds like you're ok with starting from scratch).  No need to recreate the partitions here; it makes more sense to create them with the linux installer.  This is also what you'll need to do if you want to go back to MacOS; the MacOS installer thinks there isn't a disk to install to because the drive has no partitions that MacOS can read/install to.

\- Exit disk utility and reboot the machine with your liveUSB plugged in.  Since the machine will find no bootable volume, it should fail over to trying USB.  If not, holding option should now work.

Hope this helps."
