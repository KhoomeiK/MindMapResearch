astrology,ff8gzic,t3_es41md,1579678064.0,"Oh, fun! My best friend is a gemini and he loves to rap and make music, Imma send him this!"
fatlogic,ff8gwgk,t3_es20yb,1579677952.0,I hope she (I assume) got a good response and I hope she gets to feel more comfy and healthy. If those body-positive people tell her she can't lose weight imma swing - she's a very considerate person but just wants to feel a little better :(
LaCasaDePapel,ff8gqxv,t3_es69yq,1579677754.0,"Tokyo and Rio (and the professor, but not as much). It's because they're distracted I guess. The rest sticks to the plan well, more or less and I appreciate those (even Palermo, despite him being kind of a douche)."

Nicegirls,fegwv39,t3_eouic3,1579104325.0,"it took me a good few seconds to understand that ""There nothing like you"" means ""They're nothing like you"". I was confused. Anyways sounds to me like she's trying to guilt-trip and have you like her out of pity"
virgin,feg6v7d,t3_eoxe17,1579079774.0,"My best friend is male. He did have a crush on me in the very beginning. This died down, though, and I'm glad it did because I appreciate him so much as a friend and he does, too, and while he might have liked me in the beginning, he learned to let go of that and value the friendship instead. So girls and boys can be friends and there may or may not be feelings but if the friendship is strong enough, it will work eitherway. I've had this happen with female friends, too. So idk if it's just a boys/girls thing, because how can you not like someone dearly that you trust and have a great time with? Maybe people mix up platonic love with romantic love?"
fatlogic,feg6mea,t3_eotyif,1579079427.0,??? what jobs? I? what is this post? I makes no sense I am confusion lmao
Scorpio,feg6idk,t3_eou1s4,1579079273.0,This is the scorpio thing ever
Scorpio,fecywew,t3_eoiib6,1578990394.0,"That's really sweet, I wish you two the best of luck! I'm a female scorpio sun, leo moon and virgo venus, what a coincidence! 

A very very good friend of mine is a pisces, too and I get along with her perfectly, she and I have similar personalities and we have the same humor! So I like some pisces! (Pisces men, however, so far not as much, maybe it's just the people that I've met tho) and I think Pisces/Scorpio is a great combo."

Paranormal,fdk51rr,t1_fdk153q,1578496222.0,I've mentioned some in the post
Paranormal,fdjykh0,t3_elmcq5,1578491487.0,"I skimmed through your story most of which I believe happened but here are a few things from my point of view (as I've played ouija a lot myself). The first real incident that you mentioned with the flat iron and all, I don't really know what to think of. I can't really imagine what a pentagram would look like using said iron but anyways. Something that you mentioned besides that is the whole bed-spirit-situation; this could have very well been a sleep-paralysis. Sleep paralysis is when, during waking up or falling asleep, a person is aware but unable to move or speak. During an episode, one may hallucinate (hear, feel, or see things that are not there), which often results in fear. I'm not saying what you experienced was not a spirit, psychological and paranormal stuff have this very thin line that seperates them so it's hard to tell apart. But just saying, it could have been sleep paralysis. That aside though, I've had small things happen too, so I believe in spirits, however I also believe you attract what you feel. So if you went into this thinking Oujia is bad and demons and such exist, you attratced these energies. I've broken every single ""rule"" using the ouija board and not once attracted some evil spirit, because I simply thought there was no such thing (Ouija rules aren't real anyways). Look at it this way; we're souls but with a body, they're souls, too, just without said bodies. It's like meeting someone new, don't treat them any different, yk? Treat them like you would treat anyone else, be a decent human being, that's, if anything, the only ""rule"". I for one met quite a few really nice spirits and I befriended them too. Having nice spirits around you can do wonders sometimes."
wokekids,fdjuxed,t3_elhvt9,1578488328.0,they think they real smart huh
fatlogic,fdgzeo4,t3_elb410,1578412007.0,"I love how those people throw around this ""starvation mode"" like they know what is happening when they don't seem to understand that; eating less and/or burning more = weight loss. Which is basic knowledge. Starvation mode is literally a myth and to most an excuse."
Scorpio,fdg84wp,t3_el3k7x,1578384044.0,"I for one am very torn; I want to gush all over them, trail after them like some puppy and shower them with affection but I know that scorpios are ""intense"" and so these kind of things might just scare the person, which is why I do the exact opposite. I try to play it cool and like I didn't just get over the top excited that they messaged me. Like those teenage girls in movies that say things like ""oh okay omg he texted me but i shouldn't come off as desperate so I'll respond in an hour"". Does that mean I'm not this obsessed scorpio archetype? I am. I just don't show it."
virgin,fdg4h25,t3_el3f2e,1578379666.0,"Didn't know this whole T situation is a thing.. Interesting tho. I'm struggling to figure out what my problem is (F, 20), but so far I've settled on just being ace or demi. Don't know for sure, of course. Have you had those thoughts too? 

(Another possibility would be it comes with high-functioning depression)."
Scorpio,fddsipt,t3_eksy6t,1578322854.0,"hey, now, too far there, buddy. Sell her nudes to her father so he beats her up? Nu-uh, dude, low-blow. As bad as what she did is, thinking like that is even worse. Be the smarter person, yk? You can do better. But to answer your question my best best friend is a gemini and I love him with all of my heart. He's been an angel for like 3-4years. I trust him fully and he's never broken that trust. Then again he's a gemini sun and scorpio moon. But yeah, I love this gemini in particular. Other geminis? Don't know."
