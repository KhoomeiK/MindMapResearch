As part of the system that generates the codes we have a list of letter combinations that are forbidden. It's surprising how many we managed to find - an also how difficult it was to find a comprehensive list of derogatory words.

In addition to the regular ones (SHIT, COCK, DICK, FUCK, etc) we also have some interesting ones you might not consider, for example: GOOK, SPIC, DYKE, WOG, WOP, PTHC.

We also have some easter-egg/joke ones like YAOI, YURI, DVDA (for you South Park fans).

In total we have just over 100 filter words. Another little note of interest, the system will only regenerate the code up to 100 times. If it detects a filter word 100 times in a row, it will just give up and let the next one go through regardless. Whilst the probability of 100 consecutive matches seems implausible - if someone buggers up the filter list (say, adding just a single letter as a filter) at least it won't block payments."

The truly racist thing to do is destroy the truth of aboriginal cultures and replace it with fairy tales of people beyond reproach, with magical spiritual connection to the land. No, they observed patterns of action and consequence like every other human culture. They laughed and cried, loved and murdered, prospered and suffered, lived and died, like every culture. Erasing that truth, propping up the fairy-tale culture that never existed, is the true racism."

I was pointing out that the current challenges facing the country are far beyond the knowledge and capabilities of some random aboriginal elder, and assigning them mythical insight into how to resolve the situation is the very definition of the noble savage trope.

If anything, I'd argue assigning this myth is the destruction of the truth and the reframing of aboriginal culture into something that it is not and never was - assigning to the aboriginal culture the myth of the noble savage as if it were truth - ***that*** is the true racism of the term and the very thing I am arguing against.

australia,fd9q73o,t1_fd8yaeg,1578236632.0,"Here is a rundown for anyone who actually is looking for an answer:

The Green Party is being blamed by Liberal Party (Conservatives/Republicans equivalent) for the fires (despite holding approximately fuck all seats in Parliament). 

Because they didn't do enough Fuel Hazard Reduction (preemptive burning out of fire season) - colloquially called back burning, though this actually refers to emergency procedures to prevent an already burning fire from spreading. Though the process is essentially the same for our purposes so I will refer to it as back burning.

Note that the coordination of BB is the responsibility of National Parks & Wildlife Service NSW (NPWS), in coordination with RFSNSW (Rural fire service) and FRNSW (Fire and rescue). The interesting thing about all of these organisations is they are State owned and operated, not local districts. Who is the current state party? The Liberal Party. Maybe the greens own a local district and blocked them? Well they own ballina, a coastal district which has seen almost no fires. The other two districts are Sydney districts which have both also seen no fires...

Also because they voted down the CPRS - climate legislation proposed by Labour Party (Democrat equivalent) but was flawed and without teeth. Greens gave Liberal coalition government the votes needed to shoot it down.

Yes, the Liberals are criticising the Greens for voting with them. No, they don't understand irony.

The claims this time around all started with Barnby Joyce who claimed ""green policy"" got in the way of back burning (a party with almost no seats and has never been in government blocked the government in power from doing a thing with policy that isn't implemented in law?).

As usual, there is no, zero, zip, zilch, nada, nothing of fact to any of these claims. Liberal Party don't want to take responsibility and the ironically ""Liberal media"" (in this case literally media which supports the Liberal Party because it all inherits the Rupert Murdoch brand of Conservative FOX News propaganda) pushes this agenda for them."

Unless you have a highly appealing unique selling point, you will need to relentlessly pursue small victories. Like death by a thousand paper-cuts.

* Mailing lists (provide an option for ""just email me to remind me of the release"") 
* Social media (Facebook, twitter, YouTube, patreon, reddit)
* Wishlists on steam (huge one)
* Dev-blog
* Indie game developer forums
* Word of mouth is your biggest friend - other indie developers will be a big help, especially if they also have followings, but general public will spread the word the farthest

Late game stuff is more of the traditional:

* Games media outlets
* Conventions if you have time/money/publisher/friends on the inside.
* YouTubers
* Streamers (twitch, mixer, hit box) doing reviews, first impressions, LPs - don't target just the big ones spread the love far and wide - smaller channels are more likely to be receptive and try to find channels that focus on the types of games similar to yours.

This should be left until you have a close to complete project, timing for that varies on project to project, but no more than about 3 months from release or 10% of the work remaining - whichever is lower."
