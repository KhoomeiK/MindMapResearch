4PanelCringe,ffku9v2,t1_ffkhiox,1580029004.0,Oh man I miss scrubs
truechildfree,ffkor1x,t1_ffkax7a,1580026278.0,Yes it can be expensive but all that money that would have gone to a kid can just add to the travel budget
truechildfree,ffkojs1,t3_eu2tw7,1580026182.0,"Do activities that I would do as/with a kid but with my partner. We'll have exponentially more fun without spawn plus we're having fun together which is bonding anyway. We like to go skating or to arcades or check out a new restaurant since we recently moved here. Or take our fluffy son on walks or game together. We made an ice castle in terarria, he's better at ice skating and I'm better at roller skating, our dog is a dork and we traverse kids playgrounds with him. We can go on vacations without worrying about where our kids will be.

I personally can't see how life with kids would be more fun when we already have the freedom to do what we want. Plus all the money that would be put toward raising a kid can instead go to investments or vacations or a couch or a new pc monitor."

AskReddit,ffjzrg1,t1_ffjzam7,1580011459.0,"Sometimes I don't and have my bf take me to the er to get Ativan because they won't prescribe me with decent meds. Then feel like an idiot for going to the er for it. But rant aside. Last round of anxiety attacks spiked my BP to levels from 150-200/80-90 which can be a true medical emergency.

During attacks I often hurt myself by tics like scratching or clinging to my own arms or other measures that feel like they help calm me but don't. But I don't always puke like my mom did, I'll gag sometimes but rarely puke. Sometimes on bad days I see a lot of hallucinations just from sheer stress. It really depends."
casualknitting,ffjwdl3,t3_etzhha,1580008764.0,I have knitted quite a few things by now and I'm still scared of arm knitting. And yours looks perfect. I'm jelly

BeAmazed,ffjulgs,t1_ffjn5b4,1580007374.0,I grew up with dogs and now living without one is unimaginable. I lived without one for a few years and my depression skyrocketed. Also gives me an excuse to go home when I'm socially burnt out to let him go out.
AskReddit,ffjtx5o,t1_ffjm1ph,1580006838.0,"I came in on my mom having a severe anxiety attack which was making her puke and I tried helping her but she shooed me out. Now I understand she just didn't want me to see, but now I have anxiety like her and think she's even greater of a mum for it."

KingkillerChronicle,ffcjrd4,t3_esglbm,1579800945.0,I'm surprised there's not a card for poverty in Tarbean. That's a big character trait and a big part of kvothes story too
AskReddit,ffcgwjb,t3_esr647,1579799205.0,"Getting bullied. Idk what about me makes me a target. I'm nice, quiet, and do my work. I've been a target easily since pre school even. Even now the last 3 jobs I've had have been so toxic I left. I'm still at this one because it pays well though.

These are the reasons I have anxiety, which my anxiety also gets made fun of. I sincerely don't know what's so wrong with me that I'm ban easy target for everyone."

AskReddit,ffbgn7z,t1_ffak2fe,1579764438.0,In my area family video is still alive and well as far as I can tell. I've been to 3 different stores in different towns and they were all stocked and had other people in them when I went in. They have really cheap rentals too so I love finding old movies that you can't watch on Netflix or something without giving your pc a virus

fireemblem,ffbdeah,t1_ffb89f0,1579760604.0,Seteth ended up with Leonie for me too and Ingrid in blue lions. He's just so wholesome I love him. There is a woefully small amount of ashe and Seteth fan art (that doesn't have Flayn in it) and it makes me sad
fireemblem,ffaqx5d,t1_ffaqdcg,1579742399.0,"Haha yeah I'm about the age of all of them so I get my pick. Seteth is probably the oldest I go for though (well. He IS quite a bit older lmao). I chose a different guy each route. Ashe (almost Sylvain) for blue, ignatz for gold, lindhardt (almost Caspar surprisingly), and on white I'll marry Seteth!"

NintendoSwitch,ff9nty6,t1_ff95jsl,1579716890.0,I do it to predownload it so I can play it at release time. Other than that pre-order bonuses I guess but I usually don't care either way. I only pre-order games I definitely know I'll like like sequels or something
NintendoSwitch,ff9nmyp,t1_ff93a5s,1579716775.0,I only pre-order digital if it means I can predownload

fireemblem,ff97o44,t1_ff97gzh,1579706754.0,It was! And it was the original one I got and playing through other routes I decided to not recruit so it's the only one I've had. I didn't realize Felix's endings were so depressing until I started hearing about them.
