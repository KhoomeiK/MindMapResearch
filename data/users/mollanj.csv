SkincareAddiction,few29ei,t3_enhusw,1579404474.0,"I'm absolutely obsessed with it. I use it at least once a week but have used it up to 3/4 days a week. (like every other day?) it makes my skin very smooth and bright and also soothes it! allegedly the plum that they use is super nutrient rich, and the combo of kaolin and red clays make it incredible at detoxing. I'm almost through my first tube - I've had it for a couple months now - and I'm planning on reordering."
bulletjournal,feknuwp,t3_epj1q0,1579203941.0,adorable!!
LushCosmetics,fdx0psa,t3_en0p84,1578764161.0,they're super finicky and many employees hate them bc they're very difficult to demo and clean up after. I like them fine though! so glad you're enjoying big sleep :)
Calligraphy,fdpoidx,t3_emf1ny,1578634680.0,gorgeous! I can never spell lavender right on the first go (or calendar! those Es and As!)
oddlysatisfying,fdhtgch,t1_fdgy4at,1578429854.0,same here! that scrolly script on most birthday cakes was super easy for me to do with a piping bag and near impossible with a pen or marker.

LushCosmetics,fca6efk,t1_fc8qglv,1577563727.0,yes exactly!
LushCosmetics,fca6dsr,t1_fc9bowk,1577563720.0,"flying Fox is super concentrated jasmine. very floral and heady. yoga bomb is more spicy and woodsy, very grounding. best description I can come up with is a mug of hot black tea while incense burns! hope this helps!"
LushCosmetics,fca68k7,t1_fc96ks2,1577563659.0,"avocado smells of a mix of apple cider vinegar, avocado, and citrus. I find it to be very tangy. turmeric latte smells like a chai tea latte on steroids and it's probably my favorite bath bomb ever! super duper creamy and sweet. it's still spicy and grounding tho! I would call avocado more masculine than turm lat, but masculinity is a construct so just wear what smells good to you :)"
LushCosmetics,fca5n8y,t1_fc8obcx,1577563411.0,yoga bomb is a lot more earthy and woodsy than karma which is fairly bright due to the orange notes. I find yoga bomb more comparable to tramp. best comparison for me is a mug of black tea while incense burns
bulletjournal,fc4y70v,t3_eg3pyw,1577433567.0,stealing this idea!! gorgeous!
LushCosmetics,fbyj89r,t3_ef3hkv,1577218271.0,love that so many of these scents have come back into stores since!!
