RVLiving,fdzdfo7,t3_endclp,1578789170.0,"I'm a van dweller so need to conservative on water.

If it's yellow, let it mellow. If it's brown flush it down.  This will save on a number of flushes.  When I'm boon docking I only turn on the water pump when i really need it so water doesn't go with every flush. Urine works and is going there eventually anyway.  

Dont put TP in the septic.  Get some brown paper bags and put the TP in.   TP takes up a lot of room in your tank.   I generally burn my TP in a fire pit.  

Get three spray bottles.  One plain water.   This rinses your dishes, your toothbrush, sometimes your toilet when you have a couple of cling-ons. 

#2: white vinegar.   This cleans every damn thing, including the air as an air freshener.  I just spray dirty cutlery with vinegar and wipe off with a dish towel.  Same for most of my dishes.  You dont need a whole production for most dishes.

#3:  diluted multi-purpose cleaner. I like Dr. Bronner's or Mrs. Meyers. For everything your vinegar isn't quite enough for.  Including yourself for those in between shower days.  

I often use truck stop showers.   Many parks have shower facilities for a small fee, if you're not camping there.  

If I can answer any specific questions, hit me up.  I'm going halfway through my third year"
