socialanxiety,fdo2toq,t1_fdm083y,1578597861.0,Had the same thing at my school. Despite having social anxiety I was still able to talk because I knew I just needed to say *something* to get a grade. Typically nobody else really talked *except* for the smart kids so I didn't really feel alone.
depression,fdgoxbr,t3_el7p7n,1578404396.0,"You're missing the big picture of it all. You don't have to be of a certain quality to be loved. You just need to accept who you are and know that that's the best version of yourself. You must hate hearing this because it's all anyone without these mental problems say but it's true. I had the thoughts you are having and I was able to get out of that part at least. I used to wallow in self pity and think that i hate myself so much everyday. Now I only ever do that rarely when something's really bothering me. It only took me a few months of being a freshmen at college. I was able to see so much of what I was actually thinking and why. I started to really analyze my thoughts and desires as a means to better myself. I started meditating more and learning to accept certain aspects of my life in meditation and am now learning to accept them at any point of the day. I learned so much about myself just from changing the way I think. You can do it to, so can everyone who's stuck at the bottom of the thick dark ocean that is depression."

depression,fd32vdv,t1_fd2jela,1578154274.0,"I feel that man like sometimes I'm so hyper around my friends and then other times I'm just an empty husk curled up in a ball that's just there existing.

Honestly though I've been trying to be more positive lately. While I feel bothered by these mood swings, lately I've been able to bounce back from depresso mode more quickly and get back to being espresso mode. I keep telling myself that these negative feelings I get are normal and just chemicals in my brain fucking shit up. ADHD limits our dopamine intake so it makes sense that we'd go through these lows and be unmotivated  often on top of the fact we get anxiety. Emotional dysregulation is also a part of ADHD so unfortunately we will just get low sometimes no matter what. But I've been learning many ways to control my emotions. You're better than your emotions, they cannot control you forever. Only reason they do is because you let them."

mentalhealth,fca740v,t3_egqmeg,1577564039.0,"This sounds like me. I feel stuck like you. I try so hard and so many things to improve myself, and while I do see improvement it  gets to me at times. Today I've been feeling quite depressed despite any effort I make to cheer myself up. I really want to improve my self esteem. I feel like it's so low so often. With each passing day I notice some other quality or trait of myself that is indirectly/directly caused by my low self esteem. I really just want to be able to accept myself and love myself but it's so hard to when I fuck up so many things. I always feel the need to beat myself up after any mistake I make. I know I just need to forgive myself but it seems so trivial to when I keep fucking things up. 

I just feel so afraid of so many things. My emotions have so much control over me. I feel so mentally weak that I'm too ashamed to talk to the people I've known my whole life. When I'm with my friends I say nothing. I'm not even there. It's like I'm invisible. All because I'm too afraid to express myself. I'm stuck in my own head unable to see the world around me in clarity. I keep getting pushed back into wallowing in my own self pity. Even that I can't do anymore because I feel so guilty for doing so. I shouldn't just have to feel like the world is a terrible place and that I don't deserve anything. But I do. Everyday. I feel your pain.

I want so much to be better than this. I hope you can become better too. Even If I can't convince myself that I can become better than this, I know I can, and I know you can too."
depression,fc4cyqi,t3_efyemj,1577413075.0,"Depression doesn't cause you to stop caring for yourself, rather it's low self esteem that causes depression. If you hate yourself, well of course your body and brain wouldn't care to treat you well, because you're someone it hates.

If you have anxiety issues as well, low self esteem is also the root of this. It makes sense to be scared of things when you doubt your own ability to deal with them. If you think you yourself are not good enough then you will feel anxious, and then as a result, depressed.

Most mental health issues are rooted in low self esteem. While I am still going through anxiety and depression myself, I am glad to say that I have been making huge strides in improving my self esteem, which in turn is helping reduce my anxiety and depression. 

The best way to start imho, is meditation, legit. It will calm you down and allow you to look at your thoughts in a neutral light, really analyze them, why they are there, how they make you feel and why, then coming to terms with them, and acceptance of said thoughts. 

It's hard to get out of the dark thick ocean that is depression, but you *can* do it, while it's not as simple as ""get over it"" it is more simple than you think. It will take a lot of effort but is by no means impossible or very difficult. I honestly hope this post at least opens your eyes a little. If you're down to chat about this my dms are open. Hope this helps."
