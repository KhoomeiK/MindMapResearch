[This is the extent of the information on the court's docket](https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/121319zr_1a7d.pdf) - the request for a stay was submitted to Ginsburg, who referred it to the full court - who voted to stay the proceedings and grant cert on the case.   

What you know, is that the court voted to take up certiorari (Which traditionally takes only 4 votes), not which way the Roberts voted or will vote.   Roberts himself has little power to do something independent of the other justices outside of the power of persuasion. 

And I would submit that there was virtually *zero* chance the Supreme Court would not grant cert on a case involving presidential privilege, even if the matter was largely decided in US vs Nixon.  A matter of that importance was very unlikely to have cert denied."

Mitch McConnell's realization is that the average American voter neither knows the procedural minutiae of how the Senate works, nor do they have any interest in learning it.  Much like the average Reddit commenter only reads the headline before posting an angry comment, the average American voter only has the attention span to read a newspaper headline or listen to 15-30 seconds of a TV bit. 

For example: 

So when Senate Republicans under Obama ratcheted up the partisanship in the judicial nomination process, blocking many of Obama's nominees, basically because they could. 

Fox News flooded the airwaves with headlines about how Republicans were blocking radical judicial activists. So Republican hardliners got exactly the spin McConnell wanted. 

But, for many others is they only got As far as "" Senate blocks Obama Court nominee.""  And they formed the opinion that politicians were just squabbling again and not getting anything done. This suited McConnell fine as well.

When the average voter had no understanding of the filibuster process or weather McConnell was being hypocritical in using it the way he did, there was little to no political blowback for his actions. 

This is history. But I would be careful not to overgeneralize. Republicans seem to have an edge in controlling who's the median narrative and you can guarantee if they eliminate the filibuster all together they will be howls about abolishing years of tradition."

They have functional literacy. They can read signs and read a restaurant menu etc.  

But, for example, hand them a basic legal document, they freeze.   Either they decide to bluff it, glancing at it for 15 seconds before saying they've read it, or they do some variation of ""just tell me what it does"" and then they sign it. 

If they are *required* to read it, often they have to sit and struggle with it for quite a while.

Mitch McConnell is saying that democrats should be afraid of votes to call individual Witnesses. He is saying that the Senate GOP will force votes on witnesses that are embarrassing to Democrats. 

Factually he can only be talking about votes to call the bidens as Witnesses. 

His belief is that a vote on whether to send a subpoena to the Bidens will be an embarrassing vote for Democrats because the Democrats will be forced to choose between defending Biden or opening themselves up to GOP talking points about  this being obviously just political rhetoric because clearly Democrats don't care about the getting to the bottom of the Biden's corruption either.

My point is ""so what.""  

It's not about Democrats conceding that the Biden could be called as Witnesses in trade. That's not what I'm talking about. 

McConnell is trying to scare Democrats away from voting for Witnesses.

There's virtually zero chance that Democrats win the vote to call witnesses and win the votes to exclude GOP Witnesses.

My point is that McConnell's threat that democrats should be afraid of the GOP calling Biden as a witness is an empty threat.  The idea of Democrats being afraid to choose between a fully open trial and protecting Joe Biden is fallacious because the vote doesn't hurt Democrats in the first place.  How many Democrats would truly be upset if the Senate Democrats said ""okay sure, call Biden if you want."""
politics,fempg2j,t1_femnj1k,1579265667.0,"It's not a matter of concession. I don't think you have a good read on the situation. 

There's still a significant chance that the Senate GOP will vote to hold the trial where no Witnesses are called. 

But, there's a lot of public pressure on the Senate GOP to actually hold a real trial with witness testimony. Enough public pressure that there have been the first signs of the GOP Coalition starting to crack.  A few Republican Senators have made public statements that they are considering voting to call witnesses.  Only two or three defections are necessary before there could be a majority vote in favor of calling Witnesses at a trial.  What they're trying to do right now is circle the wagons and keep their Coalition whipped into shape.

The existence of this story shows that Mitch McConnell is nervous about this. Because Mitch McConnell has gone on the attack.  Mitch McConnell is going out to the media and telling reporters that if there's a vote to call witnesses, he will force votes on specific Witnesses, and that Trump will call the witnesses he wants or the Senate will have votes on whether to call those Witnesses.  McConnell is saying that democrats should be afraid of those votes. 

My opinion is that this is a given.  

If the Senate does in fact call Witnesses in an impeachment trial, there is no plausible scenario where the house impeachment managers get to call witnesses but the Senate defense attorneys do not.  Even if the Dems are able to successfully split off two or three members of the Republicans to vote to call witnesses, they will *certainly* say it's only fair that both sides get to call witnesses they want.

So, If there are witnesses, there are going to be defense Witnesses and the GOP will get to choose who they are.  If Trump's public statements are any guide, he would want to call the bidens and Adam Schiff as Witnesses. 

It may still be the case that no Witnesses are called. This will be a political loss for Democrats, but one that they can make a significant amount of public relations hay on. 

My point is that if the Senate GOP forces votes on whether to call the bidens or Adam Schiff or whoever as Witnesses in Trump's defense, I see those votes as effectively costless for Democrats."

I mean, sure, what they have to say isn't really relevant to impeachment,  (trump's argument is basically, ""i know you are but what am I"") but I literally could not care less if Democrats have to concede that Republicans get to call the bidens  as Witnesses in order to get to get the testimony from Administration Witnesses they want. I think this talking point only works on the Fox News crowd that's already deep in the tank.

politics,femmb26,t1_femkq52,1579262381.0,"what? 

Ordinary defamation requires a false statement of fact (not opinion) that hurt someone's reputation and proof of damages.  

But for a public figure, the law requires proof of ""actual malice"" which is knowledge they the statement made was false or reckless disregard of truth or falsity.    You have to prove that the speaker or writer actually knew that the statement was false and did it to hurt the public figure.

It's notoriously difficult to prove intent. As long as the author had some sort of reasonable basis to post what they were writing about, it's very unlikely that a plaintiff in a defamation suit could win.  Basically the only sure thing would be if you had a Smoking Gun document where someone emails the author proof that their writing is untrue and they said ""screw it I'll publish it anyway.""

And there's a significant question of what sort of compromises the Democrats would have to make to bring two or three Republican Senators on board to vote for a democratic majority leader. Those Republicans would be in the Catbird Seat but there's a pretty strict line on how far a lot of Democrats would be willing to go.  I hadn't gotten the sense there's any stomach for major concessions to try to peel off a senator or two.

Any actual argument, to the extent I offered one, is that the court is proceeding at a *normal* pace. Declining to drastically accelerate a case is is somewhat different from ""slow-walking."" 

US vs Nixon was accelerated to some degree, but in a different way. 

Jaworski obtained a subpoena to Richard Nixon on April 17, 1974 (mind you, this was in the context of criminal charges already filed against the Watergate 7).  Nixon asked the district court to quash the subpoena and Judge Sirica heard oral arguments on May 13th, issued a decision on May 20th and ordered Nixon to produce the tapes by May 31st.  

Nixon appealed to the Circuit Court for DC and the special prosecutor filed a petition for certioriari directly to the supreme court without waiting for the DC Circuit to make a decision, and Nixon Counter-petitioned to the Supreme Court.  the court granted certiorari, which was [Truly Extraordinary](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3109524?seq=1).  It may have been motivated by the case that both sides wanted it reviewed, but that sort of thing almost never happens. 


In contrast, in [Clinton v Jones](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/520/681/) which addressed similar issues of law (whether a president is subject to civil process, albeit not in impeachment), Paula Jones commenced her action in May 1994, a trial court decision on President Clinton's claims of immunity from process was reached in early 1995 and appealed to the 8th circuit which reached its decision in January 1995, and that decision was appealed to the Supreme Court which granted Cert and reached its own decision in May 1997. 


Notably,  [the supreme court case on subpoenas for financial records is moving quickly](https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/13/politics/supreme-court-trump-financial-documents/index.html)  - the house issued subpoenas on April 15, 2019, Trump sued on April 29th to block Deutche bank and decided by the district court in June, the 2nd Circuit in October and is scheduled to be argued before the Supreme Court in March. 

Likewise, in the McGhan case, the house issued a subpoena on May 20th and Mcgahn refused to comply. negotiations ensued and the House filed a lawsuit on August 7th, 2019, to force his compliance.  Arguments were held and the district judge Ruled McGahn was ordered to comply on November 25, 2019. The [case was heard before the court of appeals on January 3, 2019](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/01/03/house-appeals-court-hearing-compel-don-mcgahn-testimony-trump-impeachment/2740779001/) and a decision is forthcoming. I would reasonably expect it to be argued before the supreme court in the summer if the timeline holds. 


So the proceedings are generally moving faster than the civil case against CLinton where Clinton asked for dismissal based on immunity, but slower than the case against Nixon, where the subpoena was issued for evidence as part of a criminal trial against co-conspirators of Nixon."

The population of people who are annoyed that their toilet only uses 1.3 gallons per flush as opposed to 3.4 gallons per flush overlaps almost exactly with Trump's base. 

So, whether the causation is that he got a good response to the talking point and keeps using it, or he heard it on the news and it resonated with him so he uses it, the weird talking point made it into his stump speech. 

Except, with his weird speaking style and thought patterns (which may well be influenced by dementia),  the talking point doesn't really come through.    He's *wanting* to tell people ""the government made your toilet not work and I'll fix it""  But what comes out is ""people tell me they have to flush the toilet 10 or 15 times. It's ridiculous"" And everyone *except* the old guys for whom this is a daily annoyance scratches their head and goes ""huh?"""

I was recently the defense counsel on a facially absurd civil rights complaint. (and when I say facially absurd I mean the allegations in the complaint made no factual sense).  The plaintiff was pro-se.  It took three months for him to serve all the defendants, and then another four months for the court to reach a decision on a motion to dismiss, which it granted. I had three or four conversations with clients that amounted to ""nope, no decision yet. yes. I know it's ridiculous.""

**INTENT** is also a significant difference. 

Bombing a wedding because it is your *intent* to cause terror and kill civilians would arguably be a war crime. 

Launching a strike against a military target when he happens to be at a large gathering and others might be killed is measured on a risk/reward basis.   Completely removing the possibility civilians will be killed in wartime is impossible, and you can't completely eliminate high value targets because they happen to be around civilians or you just encourage the use of human shields. 

The key distinction is the intent of the action. Because everything else is messy shades of grey. 

Change the setting. You can illustrate the point clearer. 

if Enemy forces set up an observation post in the tower of an 11th century mosque.  You're not prohibited from attacking them because they're in a mosque, whether it's a cultural site or not.     If the Mosque gets damaged in the proces, that's on the soldiers that chose to use it as a military position. 

However, if you call in an airstrike and flatten the entire mosque when that wasn't a necessity, that might be questioned as whether you could have chosen an alternate action. 

On the other hand, if you attack the mosque because you believe destroying a cultural site will demoralize or punish the enemy, that's a war crime.

When broadcast radio, and later broadcast television was created, Congress passed laws to regulate the airwaves and ensure that there was an orderly practice. This created the Federal Communications Commission and as a part of its regulations it also determined what was appropriate to broadcast over-the-air and what was not.

This was all in the context of a world where you only had three or four TV channels available to you in your home. Those channels existed because the FCC had given them a license to broadcast on a certain frequency.  There were conditions attached to that license. They could not broadcast any obscene speech for example.  They were also required to devote a certain percentage of their daily programming to public interest programming or current events programming.  And this programming about current events had to be presented from a neutral perspective, giving both sides of an issue time to air their opinions. 

This time period Where the only TV available was two or three broadcast channels coincided with the height of the idea of Journalism as a profession with Professional Standards and ethics.  It was deeply shocking to the American public on Walter Cronkite aired his personal opinion on the Vietnam War, precisely because that was so rare. 


Getting back to your question, the same technological limitation does not apply to cable television. Early cable TV could have up to 64 channels and then up to 256 channels, and with IPTV there are literally unlimited potential media sources.

Let me be more specific.  Income is relevant, but the issues are  still relatively simple, or they should be. 

The Arkansas State Legislature and the Court system have developed [charts](https://www.arcourts.gov/sites/default/files/formatted-files/child_monthly20070614_1.pdf) that set the amount of support you owe based on your [weekly, biweekly or monthly income.](https://www.arcourts.gov/forms-and-publications/arkansas-child-support-guidelines)  

A judge can deviate up or down from the amount on the chart ""for good cause shown."" 

The standard procedure in a paternity case is to ask the non-custodial parent (usually the father) to fill out [an affidavit](https://www.arcourts.gov/sites/default/files/formatted-files/AffidavitOfFinancialMeansOctober2016_0.pdf), under oath, stating their current income. That information is then used to set support.   Custody cases get *slightly* more complicated because joint custody and one parent contributing in-kind support can be taken into account. 

The only way long term income history comes into play is if there's a claim that someone is hiding income or avoiding support.  Then it's still fairly simple in terms of well, what has your average income been over X years, then you set support based on that.  Tax returns provide a pretty simple answer there.  The law is in favor of kids getting supported and not in favor of parents who try to game the system, so a judge isn't going to be reversed on not wanting to listen to a bunch of arguments about why an average income wasn't good enough. 


And also more to the point, there's not any good reason why a case for support shouldn't settle with an appropriate support amount and go away, unless there's ulterior motives."

>I am not starry-eyed about bipartisanship and its supposed joys. On the contrary, the current Republican Party’s abject fealty to Trump and its shift far to the right of where it once was mean that promises of a glorious bipartisan future will, for some time, be false. I have little faith in Republican politicians, including many I once thought were serious about governing. 


Trump and the Republican party need to be defeated absolutely.  The points I *am* making?

1. My original post was analyzing EJ Dionne's thinking and more broadly political trends. 

2. There's a second point about how some Republicans are adopting democratic rhetoric and beginning to talk about core democratic issues, which is interesting for political reasons, and indicates the possibility of a sea change in politics. 

3. At a deeper level, I suppose there is a point about bipartisanship, but it's not to press for bipartisanship for the sake of bipartisanship. Rather, it's explaining my thoughts on why I believe it won't work.  

The idea of Bipartisanship itself is premised on the concept of governance as a serious duty, to be undertaken in a serious manner.  The idea that there are generally recognized problems that confront our society and that there is a serious duty for intelligent people to sit down and work out solutions on how to solve those problems.  If serious solutions are proposed, those solutions are due serious consideration, and there's a valid benefit in pursuing solutions that have the broadest agreement. 

**BUT** the point I made earlier which is that the rise of the tea party in 2010 and further, the rise of Trump represents a fundamental rejection of serious governance as a positive characteristic.  The tea party had no really serious policy goals other than opposing Obama and Repealing Obamacare, and had given no serious thought on what the American Health system should look like.    

Trump took that a step further, The Trump campaign had virtually no serious policy platforms that weren't immediately rejected as fanciful or impossible on serious consideration, and his entire campaign was demagoguery.  Likewise, a constant theme of news from his administration has been this idea of ""serious"" people within the government working either to limit the damage he causes or implement his inane wishes in a way that actually works. 

When the opposition party rejects governance as a serious duty, there can be no bipartisanship. It is only when they address problems seriously and present serious solutions, do their ideas have to be given serious consideration."
politics,fcr5fv0,t1_fcqsvag,1577897043.0,"Dionne's point is that ""When one side of politics begins talking the other side’s talk, it’s a sign that its old ideas have run out of steam."" 

If a political party is going to shift tone, exactly who do you think is going to be the first ones to do that?  The true believers? 

There have been two sea changes in American politics within the last 100 years.  Changes that utterly upended the political consensus that existed before. 

The first was Roosevelt's new deal.  In the 1930's, Conservatives called Roosevelt a communist and some went to far as to allegedly conspire to launch a coup against him.  

 By the 1950's, the Republican party had almost entirely accepted Roosevelt's reforms, Social Security, minimum wage, etc., as the status quo, and adopted much of that as their own.  The republican party of Eisenhower and Nixon worked fully within the paradigm that Roosevelt set. (notably, after a primary fight in the Republican convention) 

The paradigm shifted again in 1980 under Reagan, to be Cliche, the new Paradigm was embodied by Reagan's words ""the scariest words in the english language are ""I'm from the government and I'm here to help.""  

Reagan won two terms and George HW Bush won a third. Clinton ran for office explicitly adopting Reagan's rhetoric and many of his positions, talking of a ""third way"" between the FDR democrats and Reagan. 

Since then we've lived in Reagan's shadow, politically.  Both Obama and Hillary Clinton stayed with the same basic paradigm that the Reagan administration set, and George W bush pushed his legacy. 

Now, it appears (hopefully) that the wind is changing. Polling suggests that there's a decent chance that Trump will be a one term president, and two of the four leading contenders for the democratic candidate promise a radical break from the Reagan paradigm.  

Dionne notes that some republicans  like Marco Rubio and Ross Douthat and the National Affairs Magazine have started adopting much of the same language that Warren and Sanders use.

politics,fcqo1dr,t1_fcqggln,1577889364.0,"Something tells me you didn't really read the article. 

Dionne's point is more about serious debate then it is bipartisanship.

  He cites a fairly recent talk by Marco Rubio about his opinions on the flaws of the capitalist system and how it focuses on short-term gains at the benefit of Greater economic growth and protecting workers.  That's the kind of talk that neither the Tea Party nor Trump would ever give. They don't give a shit about policy, they only care about what Riles up their base.


From 2010 to 2020 has been the decade of the Tea Party. It gained National prominence in 2010 and came to control the Republican Party outright in the age of trump.  Trump's insistence on fighting back personified the character of the Republican Party, which is part of the reason the various Republican factions fell so deeply for him.

The Tea Party perfectly fits everything you just said in more ways than one.   they specifically came to office with the notion that compromise with liberals (and Obama in particular) only results in a slower descent into hell.   Is that if a compromised, liberals would just take whatever they could get and then push again next year. They Carried the same fundamentalist attitude into politics, that many of them had as to religion. A staunch insistence on basic principles and extreme deference to Authority. They would only ever work with Democrats if their hand was forced to, and they would turn their back and any deal the moment it was convenient. 

On the same note perhaps, the tea party has no serious interest in policy. Nothing exemplifies this better than their utter failure to come up with any coherent response to Obamacare.   They are conservative populists and demagogues, not interested in serious governance except on certain cultural issues. 

It took Democrats 10 years to catch up, if they have.   Most mainstream Democrats were still under the impression that most of the Tea Party rhetoric was just that, rhetoric, and their opposition was still personified by politicians like John McCain, who famously told off one of his own supporters that Obama was not a terrorist, that he was a good man who cared very deeply about the United States and just had very different ideas about how it should be run.

The progressive Wing is the Democratic party is now very much in the same place the tea party was in 2009-10 except from the opposite end of the political Spectrum. They they want no prisoners and if they can enact their goals into law by 51% then so be it.  But, just like the tea party, they will need to be wary of a blowback.  

I'm not sure EJ Dionne ever made that the paradigm shift into believing that the Republican Party had been absolutely taken over by fundamentalists. 

But at the same time, EJ Dionne is an Institutionalist.  Even if he favors liberal or Progressive policies, he very much wants to live in a country where Republicans are willing to give speeches about the flawsof capitalism, and where, even if in the minority, Republicans would serve a role as a loyal opposition.

Part of this is the coordinated media messaging of Fox News and Rush Limbaugh and other conservative talk radio and Sinclair media.  That part of the Republican base is utterly convinced and believes wholeheartedly that they face Democrats who, for some unknown but terrible reason I really want to destroy the United States.

When you have seen the odd Republican break from Trump, they have faced an immediate and harsh backlash from within their own Republican base and the party establishment. They are immediately cut off from Republican support and told they will be primaried."
politics,fcnatp7,t1_fcn3z4x,1577807619.0," I still have hope. 

Many of the most significant governmental reforms that exist in the laws of the United States were passed in the wake of the Watergate scandal.  The Freedom of Information Act. The openness in Government Act. Governmental ethics reforms, the list goes on and on. 

If there's one good that has come out of Trumps presidency, it is that he has exposed the extent to which our government system still relies on good faith from governmental actors and on Norms and traditions within the governmental process. I think Trump has also exposed, and finally reversed, Trends toward the imperial presidency.    The people have realized that the powers is that George W bush and Obama exercised and were controversial at a minimum, but broadly accepted, cannot be left to the discretion of someone like Trump.  

Assuming that the 2020 election goes the way I hope it will, I think we will see a large swap of legislation mandating many of the norms and traditions that prior presidents followed, but that Trump has blown off. 

Of course, it remains to be seen whether these positions change if a Democrat wins the presidency but Republicans maintain control of the Senate by a vote or two.  Then it would be in the Democrats interest to maintain those powers to roll back the acts that Trump has done, without the approval of the Senate."

It is entirely legal for a newspaper to file as a non-profit Corporation. And qualify their activities as charitable registration or in the public interest. And, in fact, several newspapers have done so recently. National Public Radio is also a nonprofit corporation.   

This exempts them from paying many taxes, and also allows contributions to them to be tax-exempt.

But it still runs hard up against the problem of finding the funding both to keep the doors open in the first place and to support quality journalism. 

This requires a healthy dose of either reader engagement and support, philanthropy, or public support. 

NPR does all three. Local stations have their membership pledge drives, which are matched by grants from the government supported Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and many local NPR stations are partially subsidized by public universities and charitable foundations.

One of the constants was that he always held a positive opinion of human nature and a positive opinion of social traditions and Community norms.

Methuselah's children, Coventry, and for the living are examples of early Heinlein.  

He wrote Starship Troopers when he was middle-aged. 

And his novel Friday, published in 1982, was one of his last. 

Starship Troopers was written partially in response to calls for Eisenhower to stop nuclear testing and back off from confronting the Soviet Union, and in the novel Friday you can see some of his thoughts on the political upheaval of the 1960s."
politics,fcn826z,t1_fcn7ejm,1577805688.0,"True, and I don't Envision it so much of it as a problem being for profit, so much as being akin to the situation where a hospital turns away a mortally wounded patient due to their inability to pay. 

It's been the law in America since the Reagan Era that hospitals are not permitted to do this, but it created one of the signature problems in American Healthcare which is that people who did not otherwise have access to health care would wait until they're conditioned qualified as an emergency and then seek treatment at an emergency room where the hospital was obligated to treat them. This resulted both in an undue burden on emergency room cost that hospitals had to address in other areas and crushing medical debt on the patient."
politics,fcn5ozj,t1_fcn3lus,1577803949.0,"This is actually my daytime job. I work as a child welfare lawyer employed by a state government. I handle criminal child abuse cases and parallel cases where kids are in foster care, having been removed from their parents due to abuse neglect or parental unfitness.

The Family First Act has created broad sweeping changes in State child welfare and foster care systems.  It creates a very strong preference toward relative and family foster homes as opposed to residential placements, and actually creates a rule that residential placements cannot be paid for by Medicaid unless a court finds it is necessary. 

However, unfortunately, and deeply ironically, the Family First Act only applies to state governments. It's legal Hook is that state government funding is conditioned upon States meeting the dictates of the act.  It does not apply to children in federal government custody. 

And this leads to my second point. The system that applies to these immigrant children in federal government custody is absolutely fucking mind-bogglingly horrifying. 

In my state, if a child is taken into foster care, there has to be an emergency hearing in front of a court within 5 days, and then there is the right to have a full trial within 60 days.  The parents have appointed lawyers if they are indigent, and the child has an appointed attorney ad litem always.  If the family doesn't speak English, a translator is provided for court hearings. This applies universally, whether or not the parents is are citizens or documented or undocumented.

Even once the state has proved its burden that it had a valid reason to take the children into foster care, the case has to go before a court a minimum of every 6 months, and the court has to hold a hearing to find a permanent option for the child within 12 months. 

A state social worker is obligated to visit the child in the home at least once a month, and a licensing worker will visit every licensed foster home at least once every 3 months.  Many children also have a court appointed special Advocate or casa, who also visit the child in the home at least once a month. 

The case involving the child has to have a hearing at least every six months, and many judges prefer it be no longer than 3 to 4 months. 

So in the State foster care system, you have at least four and maybe five individuals who are supposed to be ensuring that the Child Welfare is being adequately protected while they are in the system. Two social workers, a volunteer Advocate, an attorney and a judge. And with all these safeguards, bad stuff still happens to children in the system more often than it should.  

And God forbid something bad happen like a child dying in foster care or being seriously abused by a foster parent, it becomes a major issue that goes up to the state agency director Level for review and potential policy changes.

The legal system that allows the federal government to detain immigrant children, has virtually none of these safeguards.  It's both heartbreaking and utterly infuriating to read about children dying from pneumonia or being sexually abused in federal detention centers, because these are both things that can be prevented, But that the federal government has specifically impose regulations on state governments to prevent, but does not follow on its own behalf.

Areas that don't have the population density to support traditional fire departments often will have volunteer fire departments and some have chosen to finance those departments via a voluntary fee. 

However, this blew up a few years back in Tennessee when the fire department showed up at some residence where there was a fire and let it burn to the ground because the guy hadn't paid the fee. They were just there to ensure that no lives were endangered and the fire didn't spread.

11.88% of that is large contributions, 37.64% is small individual donors, and an unusually large 50% is [""other.""](https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/indus.php?Ind=W) 

The number one ""industry"" for Trumps' Donors is ""retired."" with the Number two ""industry"" being ""republican/conservative.""  He also gets heavy contributions from the real estate and finance industries. 

Compare that to the percentages for Sanders, who has raised 73 Million total with 57% of that coming from small individual donors, 24.9% from large contributions and 17.2% other. 

Top individual donors for Trump are GH Palmer, a real estaet developer in California, [WinRed](https://www.thedailybeast.com/winred-the-republican-partys-big-new-online-donor-portal-is-off-to-a-bumpy-start) a GOP created online donor portal, the America First PAC, Uline Inc, a privately held shipping company, and the irving Moskovitz foundation, a charitable foundation with a history of supporting GOP groups, which also supports jewish settlement of the West Bank and Gaza. 

63% of Trump's donors are Male.

Now, In fairness, Democratic fundraising totals will ramp up quickly once the candidate is named. There will be a whole new round of fundraising once they hit the general election stage.

If you work in state-level politics you will hear stories like this a dime a dozen.

By the time the news breaks, the deadline to file as a candidate has already passed. 

This is more common in local and non-partisan elections, because, of course, you still face the prospect of challenging a democrat or a republican in a district.  Albeit usually at some Advantage due to gerrymandering. And this creates a very public appearance of a corrupt bargain. 

Filing deadline nonsense gets even shadier.  In Arkansas, a Democrat was set to challenge Tom Cotton.   The deadline to file as a candidate was on a given day in November at noon.  

Literally hours after the deadline expired, the Democratic candidate withdrew from the election, without notifying the state democratic party in advance, citing his wife's health.
