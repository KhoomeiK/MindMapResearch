People put him on a pedestal because of the whole celebrity worship phenomenon and all that but really he has long been surpassed. What's important is that he paved the way for these guys. He invented a whole new style almost single handedly. 

It's like Jimi Hendrix. He reinvented how guitar was played. He came up with a whole new way of playing it, so naturally he was considered the best at this style. If he was born in this generation, he'd be considered a great guitar player, but not the greatest of all time by any means. People took what he made and improved on it."

""According to D. E. Smith, _History of Mathematics_, the sign 
originated in 15th-century manuscripts as

    per c  or  p c

for ""per cento"" or ""per hundred."" By the mid-17th century it was

         o
    per ---
         o

and later the ""per"" was dropped. Later it was tilted into what Smith 
calls the ""solidus form, %"", since ""/"" is called a solidus.

I seem to recall somewhere reading that it was originally ""numero per 
cento"" in Italian, which was written as
