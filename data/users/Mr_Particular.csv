Methadone,ffbkwae,t1_ffbdiru,1579770252.0,"Nah, you're not crazy. Idk if I saw it like that, but it definitely is/was nice. I feel like maybe my emotions have been dulled for so long you you know."
Methadone,ffavusf,t3_esjmka,1579745682.0,"Yeah, it sucks. One of my motivations for tapering off slowly. I make just enough to not qualify. So I'm stuck in same boat."
Methadone,ffavm4e,t1_ffandup,1579745524.0,I was on 120 mg's for years. After tapering over a few years I'm at 14 mg's. I definitely noticed my sense of humor coming back once I got lower. Like belly laughing at a funny show/movie.

Minoxbeards,ff1w0nq,t3_er5mxp,1579487447.0,"If you're holding the can upside down while you press, and you're still not getting foam, it's probably just a defective can. 

I buy rogaine foam off of Amazon and never had an issue. If you contact Amazon they will refund you and you can buy another one."
Methadone,ff1v9mq,t1_fexa66a,1579486953.0,You're the worst Towelie!
60daysin,ff0zxz8,t1_fezmaku,1579473900.0,"Fair enough, I suppose it goes with his persona, or whatever."
pics,fesu819,t1_fespdvz,1579369033.0,That's ludacris.
60daysin,fesnnf6,t1_felzzbx,1579367163.0,"Based on the preview for next week's episode, he won't shake Alex's (from the same program) hand. I understand you don't want to be suspicious, with them both being in the program and all, but still I think he could acknowledge him. Considering he was going around introducing himself to everyone this episode."
tressless,femee3u,t1_felp70i,1579251163.0,How long have you been using it?
tressless,felivat,t3_epqpmm,1579223237.0,"Try switching to once a day for the time being, or indefinitely.

Foam is nice, but the only benefits are that it dries faster and dries your skin less."
socialanxiety,fekhlub,t3_ep9qtl,1579200212.0,I just hop on reddit.
Methadone,feejvzd,t1_fedd4cp,1579035237.0,"Yeah, I think my clinic is supposed to be switching to just asking the nurse at the window to start/stop your taper.

 I'm hoping that's the case. As it stands now you have to meet your counsler and answer a ton of questions before you start/continue your taper. It isn't that big of a deal, but I'm getting lower, so I stop my taper for a month or so here and there."
JoeRogan,fedejxt,t1_fed4rfb,1579009344.0,"Dude, just start a podcast, or maybe some woodworking."
Methadone,fecbpjh,t3_eo1yiy,1578970275.0,You can try cross-posting in /r/askdocs. Worth a try maybe.
AskReddit,fe9dorm,t1_fe8rp1o,1578936648.0,Kind of like George Costanza..
socialanxiety,fe837h4,t1_fe62k22,1578921983.0,"This is my method, my cousin called me out in a joking way. It really sucked.

Normally it's ok through, most people wouldn't do that. This was also with relatives I see every year or 2. So I was extra anxious."
socialanxiety,fe81pio,t3_eo25rs,1578921434.0,Thank you for taking the time to write this up.
yourmomshousepodcast,fe52s53,t1_fe51c3q,1578865139.0,We all gonna die anyways. 🤷🏻‍♂️
Methadone,fe47uol,t3_en8rh6,1578856566.0,"At your clinic can you decrease your dose just by telling the nurse at the window, on the day of?"
HumansBeingBros,fdqm437,t1_fdqj0mw,1578669930.0,I only take them off if I'm fighting. My shirts always off though.
Methadone,fdpznbi,t3_emetur,1578647585.0,"If you do try melatonin take 1 mg or less, at least to start. The person who invented taking it for sleep said one third of a mg was the proper dose. Most melatonin supplements are way too much. Take it a while before bed to, like maybe an hour or so."
Sneakers,fdmtde5,t1_fdms8i6,1578564849.0,"Thanks, yeah I guess my feet are wide in the middle, because when I stand my arch goes away mostly."
Sneakers,fdm01fl,t1_fdl4xk0,1578536585.0,"Thanks. Ill try to check them out in person, before I buy them."
Sneakers,fdlzxb0,t1_fdlginz,1578536508.0,"Thanks. I've been wearing pure boosts, which work well for me. Maybe I'll try the nite joggers."
Sneakers,fdkudgr,t1_fdkq8sm,1578511344.0,"Oh OK, no worries."
Sneakers,fdkpcc7,t1_fdkccvw,1578508353.0,"Between the nite joggers and eqt 9317, which do you think is better for flat feet (wide in the middle)?"
Methadone,fdiiejz,t1_fddavx9,1578443610.0,I second what /u/throwaway12-ffs said. I've made it from 120 mg's to 14 mg's in 3 and a half years or so. I never went any faster than dropping 2 mg's every 2 weeks. Slowed down to 1 mg every 2 weeks once I hit 40 mg's. If have the time it's the way to go.
Methadone,fdidrae,t3_elbgn7,1578440600.0,"If you're going to spend a lot on a multivitamin, buy thorne brand or pure encapsulations brand, you can buy one without iron. You can look up other top brands too. Take one of those and then buy cinnamon capsules and you have your own better version of vitadone."
HumansBeingBros,fdhwkue,t1_fdgztki,1578431460.0,"It's a sam's club, different vibe.

I guess it's not that bad..."
HumansBeingBros,fdhwi9q,t1_fdhj1w0,1578431425.0,"This is a sam's club. The people who do the demos are with a different company than sam's club. I don't believe they get benefits in my area, but it could be different in other locations."
Methadone,fdfjqjn,t3_ekxjyb,1578363322.0,"Nice, I went down 2 mg's every 2 weeks and then 1 mg every 2 weeks once I made it to 40 mg's.

Over the last few years I've made it from 120 mg's to 14 mg's.

Slow is definitely the way to taper."
aww,fcw60zk,t1_fcw1qco,1578017963.0,"Calm down, there's no reason to get upset."
Methadone,fcub58z,t1_fcu62si,1577976865.0,"That was my first plan, and still my goal, but I'm having bad anxiety. I guess if I have to take something for a while I will."
Methadone,fcslyey,t1_fcrhwao,1577919352.0,"Yeah, the last 2 things you mentioned are why I'm hesitant to try it, but I feel like if I try an anti depressant instead, I'll just be dependent on that too. Plus I don't want sexual side effects from a anti depressant."
Methadone,fcras44,t1_fcnyryu,1577899254.0,"Did you take it for a while, or just try it?"
NeckbeardNests,fcp491w,t1_fcnz504,1577849988.0,Polar brand orange vanilla is my favorite. I also like some of their other flavors too.
Sneakers,fcoadbr,t1_fcmzcn6,1577827409.0,Do you think they'd work for a flat foot/wide?
Methadone,fclxj5x,t3_ehs9ig,1577758899.0,Congrats on making it off. I made it to 14 mg's today. Very nice to read your story.
Methadone,fckvboq,t3_eholzd,1577733978.0,"As slow as you're willing to go, is the best way. I never went any faster than 2 mg's every 2 weeks, and switched to 1 mg every 2 weeks once I hit 40. Over the last few years I've made it from 120 mg's to 14 mg's.

I went slower then most, but even what u/lsduck666 said is a good starting point. Just start with a couple mg's a week."
Minoxbeards,fci0720,t3_eh91xx,1577656189.0,"The shorter the hair, the easier it is to apply. If the hair is longer you have to move it around and make sure to get it on your scalp and face. It should still work though."
Methadone,fc9f1k3,t1_fc8zxop,1577551711.0,"Yeah my doctor wanted me to wait for a while and try an increase on my other meds, before I tried gabapentin. I'm going to bring it up again with him though. I have an apt in a month. I might try to get in earlier though. My anxiety has been bad lately."
Methadone,fc8vm1w,t1_fc8bziv,1577542729.0,"I've heard that tolerance can build up fast. It's kind of a mixed bag. I read of a lot of people have no issues, and others build a tolerance and have a hard time tapering off, when they quit. At this point I'm sick of anxiety and don't want an ssri anti depressant. So I figured I'd ask to try gabapentin instead of my buspar."
yourmomshousepodcast,fc8izw0,t1_fc24sto,1577535943.0,Did you threaten my life?
yourmomshousepodcast,fc8ipsq,t1_fc2o7vp,1577535766.0,"Thanks mommy, I'm going to try it out. I couldn't find it on my podcast app, but it's on YouTube."
Methadone,fc8bs5u,t1_fc77r7p,1577531357.0,"Right on, did you have to increase your dose after a while?"
Methadone,fc736qd,t1_fc6x318,1577496309.0,"Do you take gabapentin regularly? Just curious, I was thinking about trying it for anxiety."

Baby Yoda: 👋"
TheMandalorianTV,fc54737,t1_fc4yp4i,1577442273.0,"Have you considered making furniture, or starting a podcast?"
Methadone,fc2eusu,t3_efts4g,1577356152.0,"Hang in there. Just keep tapering slowly and your lethargy and sweating should go away. Start taking some a quality multivitamin, like thorne or pure encapsulations brand. Or just vitamin d and b12, don't over do it though. 

Also drink a ton of water, and eat the healthiest you can. I know I still crave sweets, and I'm at 15 mg's. I think I trained my body to crave them. I'm trying to be mindful of it."
Methadone,fc0f0dt,t1_fbzs51j,1577289110.0,"That's not too bad. I'm on private work insurance. I pay $13.25 until I reach my $1200 deductible, after that it's $3.25 a day.

I don't qualify for free mmt. If you're going through state insurance you can get it free sometimes."
Methadone,fbysr3c,t1_fbyeh47,1577225336.0,Did you stay on it for a few years for anxiety?
