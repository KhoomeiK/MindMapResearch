It feels invalidating and like we aren't suffering from a ""real"" problem. But know that it *is* valid and you are not lazy. You're battling a difficult disease, same as someone recovering from a broken limb or a chronic illness."

amateur_boxing,ffnxn82,t3_eubrj6,1580072075.0,"Took about 8-9 months of regular sparring for me. I'm an analytical dude, so I sat down and thought about what I was reacting to when I felt fear over getting hit.

I realized that there actually wasn't much pain involved (certainly when compared to body shots; those things can hurt like a bitch!), that I wasn't always gassing in every round, and that i wasn't gonna die.

But honestly, the best thing you can do is to keep showing up for it. More time clocked equals more exposure and more opportunities for the body to feel comfortable in that environment. Maybe it can help to think of every sparring session, every hit to the face, as one step closer to not spazzing over it."

bjj,ffjr7k0,t3_etp3g8,1580004823.0,"Competed in Grappling Industries today and did not do as well as I planned. Did both gi and no-gi and went 1-3 in both brackets. I was making mistakes that feel above my level at this point, like rolling thr wrong way on a half-guard sweep, not bucking my hips as soon as someone took mount, and missing an obvious armbar even when my coach called for it.

I've competed before, but this was my first serious shot where I did a ton of prep and hoped to score gold because I've never won above a bronze.

Some distance from the comp will help, but I always get so hard on myself after results like these."

My logic at the time was that I hadn't accrued the experience necessary to be competitive in the higher experience brackets, so I probably wouldn't gain much from entering those. That could have been flawed logic though so I could have been out of line.

Best of luck with your tourney! I'm doing a Grappling Industries event too this weekend."

They act like they're being forced to eat out at these specific places. Just don't go. And if you don't believe in counting calories anyway, why does that affect you?
