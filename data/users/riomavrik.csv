manga,ff2z6l7,t3_ercdu9,1579529276.0,"This seems out of the blue. It feels like for the last two dozens of chapters or so - maybe as far back as Melon's intro, the story has gone a bit everywhere that I didn't think we were close to the final arc."
manga,feyrvg8,t3_eqx905,1579449795.0,"It works great if it was a one-shot but I'm not sure how they can stretch the premise to a series. Topping a meteorite strike would be hard.

Also dumb question but I guess this series isn't on Shonen Jump? Dialogue seems a bit risque for it."
Warframe,fdnm1i7,t3_emc96p,1578588613.0,">No more rush repair drone for plat

Ooh, this hurts. The resource cost is stupidly high. Admittedly, the drone wasn't exactly a good solution because of p2w but now we have no solution at all."
pokemon,fdh8ynu,t1_fdh7cly,1578417962.0,"It's better! Because fans love gen 1 so much, the game will go back to the series's root by having a whopping 151 pokemon."

I'll take your word for it cause after a cursory google search, I still can't tell if sufferring meat is not just something people use to generate outrage like the tactics PETA uses. Since veal sold as specialties do exist, as appalling as it is to me, I guess it's not too big of a leap to crazier meat cooking superstition."
aww,fc9z2nn,t1_fc9w26x,1577560352.0,"Not gonna lie, there is something a bit fucked up in a dark humor way about drawing the line at the treatment of dogs when China has done much worse with human life. No doubt that they need to answer for it though."
aww,fc9yhry,t1_fc9ngqj,1577560103.0,"Is the whole ""taste better with suffering"" actually a real thing people do? I'm genuinely curious, not doubting you. 

I did live around a dog butchery a long time ago. While I wasn't fond of the whole dogmeat thing, the butchery's practice was the same as butchery of other type of animals, as far as I can tell."

I guess they're technically more 00's sword/shield bit.
