Austrian.  But due to treaties, thebKaiser and his German army had to support seeking payback for the hit on Franz.   And that is how WWi began.  Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire were the Central Powers."

facepalm,ff7l8w5,t3_erxq4a,1579652221.0,Too bad they don‚Äôt have a register that can read the $ and spit out change. Also no change without purchase.   Then they would never ‚Äúopen‚Äù a drawer.  Desperate people will do anything for any amount of cash

Teachers,ff57dkx,t1_ff4l6ra,1579582374.0,Wait.... aren‚Äôt they all like really interesting Ted Talks with maybe some review game at the end?    I mean that‚Äôs what admin wants.  Parents would like you to put on puppet shows and maybe have plenty of SEL activities.   Kids would like a gamer type lesson and maybe escape room.
amazonprime,ff56v9r,t1_feulpm0,1579581935.0,Why do you keep saying that to everyone?  Each post?
amazonprime,ff56i0a,t1_fespsxu,1579581622.0,"At least they sent you another.  I got the delivered in secure location but nothing was here.  Two days later (now day 5 of a Prime delivery) they say they can resend one item but the other is no longer available.  Wondering if my item is on FB Marketplace, Craigslist or eBay?!   Maybe I should deliver for Amazon and just say everting was delivered keeping random items for myself!"
amazonprime,ff568rv,t3_ernpcd,1579581406.0,"This has happened to me.  They told me to wait until 9pm of the next business day and if the delivery didn‚Äôt come then to contact them for a refund.  Umm how about no?!   No offer of any compensation for time wasted. Oh h they told me to check with all my neighbors.   I told them that their delivery guy knows he didn‚Äôt deliver it.  I check my video door thing; no one was down my street delivering.  I saw they were close, 20 stops, 10 stops then boom; ‚Äúit was delivered‚Äù no pic showing it in the porch.  Went out and walked all around the mouse.  Checked behind shrubs.  Checked video and no one had been here.  I contacted immediately.  Then called today and then contacted at 9pm. But status still said ‚Äúdelivered‚Äù and they had no record of my other conversations with them."

IAmA,fevbi7m,t1_feugve3,1579395403.0,My daughter drove in snow today for the first time. Came home crying and asked I f there were tires for the snow.  I felt like an ancient and told her how we used to have a stack of snow tires and every November my dad would swap out the cars tires.  I said I didn‚Äôt recall anyone doing it since I was a kid and I didn‚Äôt know why.    We are in New Jersey.   This is so interesting to read!

ApplyingToCollege,fekxf0x,t3_eplah4,1579209589.0,Shows you the type is scam shit show they are running.  We have to stop letting good students apply to these places.  They can‚Äôt exist without students.  We should be holding the cards.  Why do we give them so much power and control?
ApplyingToCollege,feiwxzl,t3_ep938a,1579149480.0,Yay. Also got two financial aid packages.   Wish Providence would have just rejected cause their offer is so far from what we can afford I can‚Äôt go.

scholarships,fei72p1,t3_ep6sre,1579131734.0,I might be hard as the assumption was that after one Master‚Äôs you should be able to land a job and find the second one yourself. Many companies will reimburse you.  See if you can get a job at a University!  They often will let you attend classes free

Could you imagine how they‚Äôd lose their shit when they realize the best students will continue to rise and succeed even having NOT gone to their schools?  That‚Äôs why I hate even HS rankings.
