ramen,ffxze7e,t1_ffxnrdq,1580335445.0,"I worked at a badass ramen restaurant in Texas. All from scratch except the noodles, they were Sun. Honestly, noodles are so tricky that I feel like a lot of people miss the mark. Sun are consistently great noodles, but using anything else premade is kind of lame in my opinion."

ramen,fe2xkqg,t1_fe2t0qy,1578844019.0,I used to work in a ramen shop. Sometimes I would ask the noodle guy for some noodles. Then I would cook up some gyoza and toss them together with the noodles and some dumpling sauce. Maybe put some green onions and cilantro in there. It was my ghetto mazemen and it was so good!
