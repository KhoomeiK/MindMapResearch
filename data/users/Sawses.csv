She used a walker, and frequently brought her adult daughter and her daughter's 2 kids (one a toddler and one a young teen). All of them kind of look alike.

Now, the woman and her adult daughter are stupid. I don't mean that as an exaggeration. I genuinely believe this older woman *damaged* her family just by spending time with them. They're both slow as hell mentally, but not mentally handicapped. I wish they were, because then I could tolerate them better.

Instead, these women bicker and argue about the stupidest shit while shopping for *hours*. And they insist on being accompanied by a sales associate. And since I was working there as a temp, I didn't make commission or have sales goals. That meant I went and took one for the team because fuck corporate America. 

So she'd have me help her with shoes. Trying them on. No big deal, did that for nastier feet than hers. What *really* got me was that after escorting this woman all over my department, she vanished for a couple hours to harass the rest of the store...and then came back to the shoe counter because that's what she does. And despite sales goals, nobody wants to check her out. People will *flee from her*. 

Why? Because she has coupons. Tons and tons of expired coupons, and a few that actually do work. And she'll make you explain in detail why each coupon doesn't work, either expired or because all she picked was clearance crap that nobody else wants and coupons don't work on those. And the few nice things she does get she stops you inevitably and asks why it's the wrong price. She's clearly trying to get you to just give it to her more cheaply because of fatigue...but I never ever did that. Ever. I just explained the issue...even when she made me walk across the store *ten times* to check each individual nice item's location for her.

Also, full genetic sequencing of a human being is down to well under $1,000. Ridiculously cheap, compared to just ten years ago. Let's just say that in 2006, the cost was well over a quarter million...and the first human genome to be fully sequenced was nearly 3 billion USD back in 2003.

I remember I once assumed this 10-11 year old girl was a boy. She was kinda rotund, wore a boys' T-shirt and basketball shorts, had short hair, and...frankly, at that age they kinda look about alike anyway.

It didn't help that the poor kid was looking for a size 9 *men's* shoe. Like Jesus Christ, I wonder what size her feet are now. Goddamn."

One of my college friends was a physics major--he's a proper physicist now, but he has a serious problem with self-doubt. In the sense that he has none at all. For him, a difference of opinion means the other person is either stupid or uninformed. 

And he never did quite have the ability to back that up. If he ever had a really strong opinion, I began to assume it was wrong right off the bat specifically because he clung to it so hard. That turned out to be true probably 80% of the time."

television,fev5ar0,t1_feuhtkr,1579393270.0,"Seriously. Being a chemist requires a combination of competence and confidence in that competence. 

Pretty much every chemist in the department I studied under had a, ""And this is what almost maimed me,"" story.  I'm in biology, so I rubbed shoulders with a lot of the faculty and took a lot of their classes. 

There's a certain level of arrogance you've got to have in order to feel like you won't get yourself killed--that's particularly common among the undergrads, because they don't *have* that competence yet. The actual good chemists some of them become five years later are a little more...not humble, but aware of their own mortality.

Contrast that with physicists, who generally never lose that arrogance because most of what they do won't directly get them killed if they screw up."
