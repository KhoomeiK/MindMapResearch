In general trying to ask this vs that is a simplistic outlook that often (but not always!) points to a less full understanding of traditions and art forms represented. That said, I am willing and ready to be wrong, learn from all your advice (while double checking sources) so that we all grow from this act of discussion.

saltierthancrait,feprxg2,t3_eq0tkd,1579329218.0,Star Wars has a proud and consistent history of being inconsistent with its props. Tell me then your feelings on Grievous's lightsaber collection? How Palpatine can be fighting Mace windu to the death with Anakin's lightsaber before he even shows up? How Darth Vader's lightsaber changes design more often than Lady Gaga changes her damned costume.
todayilearned,fem886p,t3_epsvd0,1579243315.0,"Everyone, this story isn't as clear cut as you may (want to) believe. Japan does have a well know dishonest style of reporting deaths and, in certain situations, deliberate misclassification of murder. Culture realities also enforce positively the attributes of rule following and submissive attitudes toward authority. Combine all this with an fantastic infrastructure and you get decades of consistency.

Addition: I understand and take full responsibility for my words and want to apologise for the way I worded my inteded statement as it took away from the true purpose. 

No system, so tightly connected and complex may realistically be expected to function over this articles stated time frame without failure. That's an irrational and misleading statement that deserves scrutiny and honest appraisal, as cultural differences tell a more nuanced story.

Vending machines and their lack of wanton destruction, even in remote areas, is a good way of showing how Western culture differ on respect of property and how that effect maintenance schedules band general upkeep. Scale this to whole machines and that's a ton of repair you simply don't need to do compared to inner-city Trams and stations say in New York.

Attacking what may be perceived as racial injustice in my statement is beneath the purpose and worth that our discussion may bring."
