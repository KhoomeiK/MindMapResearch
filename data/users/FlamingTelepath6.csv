confessions,fek6rux,t1_fejw7pu,1579193786.0,"It’s not easy to break the comfort zone, even for the average person. I think the first step is just to be open to different types of people, hobbies or anything you never thought you would do. Things as simple as that can be a confidence booster and help open that door to different things a little wider. Just try to widen your variety. I think being open does a lot for people."
confessions,fejxr59,t1_fejnwxc,1579188262.0,"Well, It’s great to know I’m not alone. I think it’s good that your son has the ability to notice these awkward social mistakes that autistic people make. This could potentially mean there is room for him to take note, apply them them to himself and improve. For a lot of people with autism, those social ques seems to go over their head completely and have no chance to learn from those mistakes and mature."
confessions,feinb00,t1_feikkyx,1579142535.0,"I’m no parent, but I’ve known a lot of kids who have grown up with autism, most of which were high functioning. This is a complicated time in history trying to find the best way to raise autistic children. IMO the autistic kids I’ve known were given too much of a comfort zone. As a result, when they finally moved on the real world, they realized how not so patient, nurturing and forgiving it is. I was one of them. I’m not a doctor, a parent or an expert on the topic. However, in a life of living with high functioning autism, if I could do it all over again, I would try to get myself out of that comfort zone and mature as early as I could in life. Autistic kids do need that extra guidance and assistance, but IMO, also need that room to mature. There are many different spectrums of autism, so not everyone is the same, of course."

confessions,fe5r8d1,t3_ennnsi,1578873440.0,It’s normal to feel that way. Don’t be jealous. Focus on yourself and your own life goals. One step at a time. Comparing yourself to other people is no way to be happy imo.
introvert,fe3a81c,t3_enh1mb,1578847432.0,"How so? Cuz this is a community for people who are uncomfortable with socializing. I don’t think so. Online is different than in person interactions. It takes a lot more out of me. Online is nothing. I’m interested in what people have to say, it’s just exhausting for me which sucks. If you are saying that there is not enough enough discussion here, that’s a problem I have with a lot of groups. No matter the type of people, not everyone has something to say."

confessions,fdlxpdg,t3_elum6d,1578534991.0,"I do it all the damn time! I make a funny comment to myself in my head and will chuckle out loud. Sometimes there will be a back and fourth inner dialogue with perfect comedic timing. People around me will say “what’s so funny?” And I’ll say “oh nothing”. It always something that would take too much explaining, something only I will get. I know it makes me look like a fucking lunatic, but the day is so much more interesting this way. Sometimes I wonder if I have something of a low level voice in my head head, but I’m way too in control. I’m crazy."

socialanxiety,fdlu0cs,t3_elyp4w,1578532464.0,"That’s interesting. I never once felt anxious of other people while driving. In fact, I feel the exact opposite. I feel fairly peaceful alone to myself and my music. You describe how I feel when I drive with passengers. I always feel like they are looking over my shoulder testing me and not trusting me to drive smart. Driving is pretty much the only place where I feel protected in public. When I piss off other drivers, I laugh and shrug. What are they really going to do?"
socialanxiety,fdlti40,t1_fdlsie3,1578532123.0,"Yeah, it’s just a way for the teacher to know if their students are engaged. Just let them know you are engaged and hard working in other ways. I think that’s fair."
confessions,fdltaoj,t1_fdlminm,1578531983.0,I think the problem is small talk itself. It’s just a lazy form of conversation.
confessions,fdlt3zu,t3_ely6wj,1578531857.0,"It doesn’t bother me. The feeling is mutual. I don’t care how people feel and I know they don’t care how I feel. Besides, I’d rather it all just go away. Small talk is one of the worst things ever."
socialanxiety,fdlsc0v,t3_em1qd6,1578531330.0,"I agree.. ish. The thing is sometimes it is necessary to have class participation for a grade via speaking. I once had to take a public speech class (I dreaded it) and speaking to the class was a given, it was public speech after all. Classes are designed to treat everyone as equals and they are set up to favor the hardest working students. If that wasn’t the case, actual lazy students can get away with putting in less effort. Speaking is just another classroom criteria of which students are putting in the effort. I think the answer to the problem is to inform the teacher of a students anxiety, so they don’t think they are trying to get away without putting in work. Many times I’ve taken classes thinking, ‘this teacher must think I’m sooo lazy’ only because of how quiet I am. I always try to make up for it with quality work in other areas."
introvert,fdlqv3y,t3_elsu4v,1578530328.0,"Being around people 24-7 is one of the biggest reasons I didn’t go to college. I need a break from people constantly, even if they are some of my favorite people. Socializing requires a lot of mental endurance from me that I definitely would not be able to keep up. Share a room? Forget it! I can’t even sleep when anyone else is awake in the same house. I know, I’m weird. I’d rather live in a broom closet than sleep with a bunch of strangers. It just wouldn’t work! The idea of it is basically science fiction!"

introvert,fdlovt8,t3_elfv8l,1578528979.0,"I don’t really enjoy being an introvert, but my goal is to accept it. I can’t help but feel that I’m missing out on so much because of it. Why do I only think of it as an unhealthy comfort zone that I want to conquer? I know I can’t change who I am though."
introvert,fdlobpu,t3_elzhhx,1578528599.0,"I’ve been there too. Working in my retail job, I’ve had different managers whisper to me that I need to be more social to the customers. I can see their point, but it makes me very uncomfortable. They say the same thing on those occasional employee gatherings. “What are you doing sitting in the corner? Go socialize with your coworkers”. I know they mean well."
confessions,fdfd8wj,t3_ekivin,1578358965.0,"I’ve been super overweight for most of my life. I’m happy to say that I’ve lost most of it recently. I had a friend try to persuade me many times to exercise and lose weight, but nothing got to me. I shut him out like everyone else. It’s simply ignoring a problem you don’t want to confront. The problem is so big and overwhelming, it’s scary to confront it. In my case. It wasn’t a matter of anyone convincing me, I just decided to do it one day cuz I felt like it. Part of it was willpower to make myself a better me and another part was fear that I might later suffer serious medical consequences. Losing weight takes major discipline and commitment. For something that big, I don’t know how you convince someone. Convincing definitely didn’t work on me. They have to want to do it. That body positivity movement is pretty damn destructive."

Me and the guy on the phone got really frustrated. Later I realized I called the pizza place I ordered from the previous night. So yeah, I called in sick to a place I didn’t work for. Haha"
introvert,fdf4wro,t1_fdf3p3k,1578353384.0,"Well, at least the people who aren’t dumb will shine brighter. I think we can agree that those few awesome people who come along every once in a while are always the ones who we appreciate the most, maybe even make up for all the sucky people by a long shot. It’s definitely frustrating to put the work in to get to those people.  It sucks even more for ‘not so open’ people who have to work harder for it than an average person."

At best they will understand but at worst they will misunderstand and think I’m a weirdo and those are dice I’m afraid to roll. I also don’t trust people with info so person. The 2nd reason is that I’m pretty sure that no matter what, telling people my problems sounds super pathetic."

SatanicTemple_Reddit,fbly5ec,t3_eduwoh,1576973345.0,"I don’t understand either. My friend, who claims to be an agnostic, gets awfully triggered by anything that is slightly devilish. If he really is smart enough to know it’s all bullshit, Satan should not phase him the way it does. I think it’s because being raised Christian really does hardwire that fear in you solid. I’ve even tried to educate him on Satanism, he is still scared to death of the subject. I’ve given up."
