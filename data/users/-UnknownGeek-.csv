Not all cops are racist or murderous.
Yes the American judicial system is fucked up and there's space for horrible people to become members of the police.
But most of the police are people who want to help.
Lumping every cop in with the corrupt bastards is not going to help."

Protective styles! You pillowcase can cause friction and breakage if your hair is loose whilst sleeping. Try braiding it loosely with a soft hair tie on the end. A silk bonnet on top if you're feeling fancy.
Don't brush your hair whilst it's wet- you can lightly detangle it with a wide tooth comb.
