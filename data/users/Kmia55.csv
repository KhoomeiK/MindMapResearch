AmItheAsshole,ffdku0q,t3_esw014,1579823006.0,I totally get your reason for wanting to stay at your dad's and I think you should be able to choose at your age. Your mom just has that syndrome all of us moms have. It goes something like this:  Is my child getting enough attention with me working? Am I listening to my child enough? Am I doing everything correctly? We doubt ourselves and feel guilty. I don't think she is trying to take advantage of you with the baby. She is just in that ... OMG my child doesn't want to live with me anymore. Am I bad mother? Is my child upset I'm having another child. And it goes on and on and on. Go live with your dad but remember not to leave your mom behind or your new little sibling. And have fun on your rescue farm. That sounds awesome.
aww,ffdk14q,t3_et0aa6,1579822519.0,I had a tripod English Setter. At birth his mom chewed his leg off and he was taken in by breeder to be put down.

videos,ff6zmu9,t1_ff6yjdc,1579638167.0,I think your attitude is why people might tell you to pull yourself up by your bootstraps. I made $1.25 in 1975 which is close to $6 now.

videos,ff6vn8t,t1_ff6lvqo,1579635815.0,I couldn't afford college and went to tech school until I went back to college in my 40's. I am currently paying tuition for my son so I know exactly how much college costs. Daycare is and always be an issue. My check after daycare allowed me to pay the utility bill and contribute a small amount to the groceries. My niece would love to use her college degree (for which she still owes a huge amount) but instead babysits other children in her home in order to add to the dual income necessary to live and pay bills. She made a choice to have that debt at this time in her life just as I made a choice to have that debt in my 40's. I have done my research as well as lived a life the average person lived during a recession and the long road necessary to recover from it. And insurance went up 600% over a 30 year career.
videos,ff6ucdl,t1_ff6mrcs,1579635053.0,"I made $6.80 an hour and received $10 for every 5-page document I typed late at night when working two jobs. And, I was lucky to have the second job when some couldn't even get one because of the economy. I went to tech school in order not to be saddled with debt. And, yes, that was my choice as college is yours. I had $2000 worth of debt left over despite working full-time. My first job in an office after graduating paid $3.25 an hour in which I had to live and pay off the school debt. When going to school I worked as a waitress with wage of $1.25 an hour plus tips which might equal $25 a week on a good week. Our health insurance over the years went from $125 per month to $875 per month close to retirement. And you do have to consider financial difficulties when there is a recession and people across the country aren't able to find work and lose their homes and pensions.  And I'm not going to defend my argument any longer. Your argument too is subjective with rent ""in my area"" and my ""loans,"" which I am assuming relate to your education.  That too is relative. My point is more about not making assumptions about the generation before you and what they faced. Not me. Not my issues. In general. I was not an exception. I was one of many. My parents paid my little sister's hospital bill off when she was 16 years old. That was the norm at that time. They paid their cemetery plots off $5 at a time. Your generation has its own obstacles as did mine and my parents before me."
AmItheAsshole,ff6pnws,t3_ervqxo,1579632265.0,You could just be gracious and tell her that it is interfering with the needs of your family and that you won't be able to do it any longer. I think it is really nice that you are willing to give her two weeks to find someone else.

I like mid-century also, but I did soften mine with some sheers at the window. It looks very put together and calm. Since you asked, if it were my room, I would pull the coffee table a little off to one side closer to one of the sofas, add some curtain panels to the windows (maybe just one panel per window at the outside edges, replace the pictures behind that little table to something with a little more interest and color, and add fresh flowers to the coffee table.

I will cancel my plans if any. I will take the children weeks at a time. But, no, I don't want to spend five days a week watching grandchildren while parents work. I don't want children dropped off at my house without notice expecting me to babysit.  I worked full-time while raising my child and I want to enjoy lunch out with my friends and feel free to travel and have a little spontaneity in my life. And, more times than not, I am thrilled to babysit. In my opinion this is what this lady is saying."
videos,ff6j1h4,t1_ff646m2,1579628252.0,"This won't be popular but I am in my 60's. My husband and I have one child. I worked full-time to put myself through school before marriage. He joined the Army to gain his education before marriage. After marriage we both worked full-time while purchasing a home and paying for daycare full-time. Home was extremely modest as in 1100 sq. ft. which we are still in. Our child has/had a learning disability which required us to pay for adaptive equipment out of our own pocket. Because of his disability, I stayed in a lower paying job because of the blessed perk I had of an understanding employer to take care of problems with my child when they occurred. Because of a leg injury my husband went back to school while continuing to work full-time when our child was still a toddler. Because he would no longer be available to take any overtime, I got a second job working from home while he went to school for close to two years. I existed on approximately 5 hours of sleep a night for two years. Interest rates on homes were 6%. I only tell you this because it just isn't just your generation that struggles with the economy. My father worked 35 years for the same company and lost his pension when the company closed. Many of my friends lost their well-paying jobs in the 1980's and some their homes struggling to recover. I don't know what the answer is to any of this, and I have never thought anyone should ""pull up their bootstraps"" to figure it out. I think each generation and each individual just does the best they can."

If you are all that close then I think you should let them know.  I think you are right in assuming their wedding will get more attention and be attended by more people because of the close proximity of the wedding dates. It is a crappy thing to do. But, from now on in the decision is yours and once that decision is made you don't have the right to be resentful about it, especially if you don't let them know. And you need to admit to yourself that your wedding was important to you and something you were looking forward to before you make a decision about the ""piece of paper"" being the only thing that matters. I'm not sure if I am understanding this correctly since you have known 1.5 years ahead of time all the details but did not become engaged until Christmas."
