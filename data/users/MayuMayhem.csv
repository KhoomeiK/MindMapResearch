P.S. you should read more closely."
EntitledPeople,ffoccm2,t1_ffoaqc2,1580076199.0,"So, you think you won a debate although your resorting to name calling instead of staying on the topic at hand and speaking logically says otherwise. 

I know I've won a debate when someone has resorted to such a means and that any further communication with someone such as yourself is at this point futile and a waste of my time. You got yourself into such a frenzy that you stooped to such a low level. You should learn to maintain a cool demeanor instead of being so reactive."
EntitledPeople,ffo1t7n,t1_ffnyezq,1580073292.0,"I would understand your misplaced view that someone's social media post is an extension of their job description regardless of if their post has nothing to do with an issue relating to their job? Sorry, I think not. 

If she was posting about something she wanted to implement that would be different than posting about honoring someone who died. Anyone with functional cognitive abilities should be able to differentiate between the two."
EntitledPeople,ffnn17w,t1_ffnj880,1580068077.0,"Just because I am an attorney, does that mean anything I post should count as legal advice? 

Seems like you would think as much."
EntitledPeople,ffn7c3d,t1_ffk69q9,1580062752.0,"I know of her and no I don't understand why a post honoring a fallen person turned into someone's political joke in the form of a jab. It was insensitive and highly uncalled for. There is a point where you take your political opinions elsewhere and learn to appreciate the people who risked their lives saving other lives. 

People should come together in moments such as that."
dogs,ffgj01h,t1_ffg0etl,1579907338.0,"Unfortunately it is a city thing too...people in the city seem to think of their dog as their baby who can do not wrong and let it do as it pleases. My dog has been attacked by off leash dogs almost as many times after moving to the city (and I've only lived in the city for 1/4th of my dog's life), but the people in the city don't seem to apologize at all. Sometimes they even have the gall to blame your dog for their dog attacking yours by saying that ""my dog is friendly and your dog must have growled at mine or did something to set mine off."""
EntitledPeople,ffa3x8w,t1_ffa1uxv,1579727390.0,"I'm not getting paid for my legal advice and am not giving legal advice due to such. If you want actual legal advice, pay for an attorney. My saying ""that could get them into a discrimination lawsuit"" was me giving possible outcomes technically without listing all of them. I only listed more to help your understanding as you seemed confused by what I meant. Anyone who works in the field should be able to deduce what I meant, and due to such I like to leave my posts somewhat vague as the original post does not even give anyone enough information to give actual legal advice on what to do."
EntitledPeople,ffa0sjb,t1_ff9q2s3,1579725580.0,"I said may be used for discrimination due to not knowing the race, gender, etc of the people working there and the one being singled out. If they are only picking on one person's vehicle and that person happens to fit into some protected class, then there could be a discrimination claim. I didn't say for sure there was one though. Was only pointing out possible outcomes."
EntitledPeople,ff9zbg5,t1_ff9y6y3,1579724718.0,"I'm sorry, are you a well versed attorney? If not, then that is simply your opinion. If so, then please provide some of your legal sources. I at least had the decency to provide a secondary legal source to support my argument and also have years of experience in the legal field. 

Just so you know, some people own multiple vehicles because they like working on old vehicles. That is called a hobby and is not a fireable offense. As long as you have a way to get to work on time, it doesn't matter what you drive (unless, as I previously stated, you work in a business where you drive people around, such as uber or lyft)."
EntitledPeople,ff9je5m,t1_ff9h5nl,1579714269.0,"No they can't. That could get them into a discrimination lawsuit or fit under the unlawful act of  ""terminating an employee for exercising a legal right."" What vehicle someone drives is their legal right for their pursuit of happiness. Some people love their old cars. They can legally fire you for your driving record, but not based off of the vehicle you drive. 

I worked for one of the largest law firms in Georgia and drove an old 2002 Chevy which was tan with a navy blue bumper and black fender despite owning a newer 2017 vehicle. My husband owns a porce and an old 1998 ford truck with faded paint. He drives that old truck to work every day because he loves it and that is his choice of what he wants to drive. Your work doesn't know how many vehicles you own and they don't need to know. It isn't up to them to dictate which one you choose to drive and when (unless you work for Uber or something where your car is used for customers).

dogs,fellmcu,t1_felhcv4,1579225113.0,"I don't agree with needing a fenced in yard. Everyone told me that when I got my husky and that he needed to run free (I got him when he was 2 years old and I lived in a 1 bedroom apartment). I would take him to the dog park for that though 3-5 times a week. I also would ride my bike with him so he could run fast next to me and take plenty of walks/jogs with him multiple times a day (we went up to 10-15 miles some days even).

He is now about to be 10 years old and he is still more active and acts in better shape than most 5-7 year old dogs we come across at the dog parks even. The vets we transferred to were even surprised at how old he is and didn't believe it until they checked his prior records. 

As long as you are able to provide the animal with proper exercise, a fenced yard is not necessary. In fact I feel too many people rely on having a fenced yard and leave their dog out and ignore them (such as all of our neighbors here). My dog still gets more exercise than the people who live where we are at now and only leave their dogs in the yard. Those dogs just lay around outside all day until they hear a noise to bark at."
dogs,feljasf,t1_fejxa8e,1579223534.0,"100% agree with the not getting a second dog for your dog. 

I know that my dog and another will only play together in front of people (as is the case with pretty much any pet dog) and that the moment you place them outside by themselves, they do their business and wait by the door for their humans to notice them.  He also would have been ok with another dog when I first got him, and he still very much loves to go to the dog park to play with other dogs, but the moment I found a stray and took it home while trying to find its owner or a new one (if it didn't have one), he wanted nothing to do with it after awhile. The home was clearly just for him and his humans, and although he didn't attack the other dog, I could tell he clearly did not like sharing his toys, attention and what he considered to be his space for longer than a doggy play date session. Because of that, I will continue to take him to the dog park, but I will never get a second dog with him. To me, he deserves all of the attention we can reasonably give him anyways."
dogs,febtl5f,t1_fe9e1cu,1578962571.0,"Sadly enough, most who do things like that don't really have a reason to fear a lawsuit. 

People like to threaten lawsuits and such, but the reality (and also what we used to joke about at our lawfirm) is that ""you can't squeeze blood from a turnip.""  It is true you can waste your money with attorney and court fees trying to sue someone who is in the wrong, but really doesn't have money to give. Just because someone has a house and vehicle, it doesn't mean they have money. There are plenty of people who live off of debt and they don't make enough money for the judge to even consider them having to pay for damages since the judge knows that they already have issues living off of what they make. Another fun fact is that even if the judge rules in your favor and requires the other person to pay back damages, more than likely it will be enough of a fine that the person will be able to claim bankruptcy and not have to pay but a fraction of what was ruled on."
EntitledPeople,fdfx65b,t1_fdfa4y2,1578372648.0,"You don't have to enter the store at the same time actually. They were seen in the same vehicle together even and when one is turned down just to send another in, then the same applies. It literally is just the law. If they didn't like it then they should have the proper things to buy or not even try in the first place. You can argue with me, but I have worked for a law firm long enough that your argument doesn't mean much other than your personal opinion."

It literally is the law to not sell to someone or their friends an item, that requires you to be carded to make sure you are of legal age, when not everyone who stepped foot into the establishment is able to provide a valid ID showing they are of age.  

If it is such an inconvenience, then don't forget your freaking ID. You need it to be driving anyway and you only have yourself to blame if you left it knowing you were going to drive to buy tobacco or alcohol. People legit need to learn to own up to their own mistakes and to quit pushing blame on other people for their mistakes."

I live in one of the most liberal states (Washington) and if my husband wants to buy alcohol, then I get carded as well. If I cannot provide a card, they deny our ability to purchase alcohol.  Even if I left the store before he went to check out they will ask for him to have me come back in to check my ID as I had stepped in and was seen with him.

EntitledPeople,fap7yl1,t3_ea8i9p,1576282168.0,I wouldn't move in with a person like that. A good friend of mine had a similar situation and found out that the person eventually decided to poison their dog after they all moved in together. I know that I couldn't risk my pet's life over someone who obviously doesn't respect them as a part of your family and wants it gone. Like seriously she sounds crazy.
