todayilearned,ff1vm9u,t1_ff18sl0,1579487181.0,My buddy sold [Elgin beloy]( https://elginbeloy.com/) a cell phone when he was visiting his parents for the holidays.
todayilearned,ff1tehs,t1_ff1jsmm,1579485764.0,The university of Minnesota has free credits past 13 and a c- is passing. I'm pretty sure you need a form signed to break 20 credits but if you had been a good student up to then it would be trivial to get it signed off.
freefolk,ff0fnrj,t1_fez8w88,1579468440.0,"Its think those paint by numbers seasons really messed up their process. They talked about splitting up episodes randomly and and not really consulting each other during the writing process. Which would totally work when all your trying to do is trim down an already existing work for TV. But once you get into generating more original content for the stow it takes more effort and time to keep everything consistent. But when you've been so successful for years with the way your doing it, you aren't going to voluntarily change."
PracticalGuideToEvil,fet0lyo,t1_feqhg36,1579370741.0,Which chapter does she say she can't be the black queen in?
funny,fem2cq0,t1_felv7cw,1579237468.0,That's actually spring in Minnesota. Although we occasionally get a severe snow storm or two to keep everything muddy until summer.
australia,feis2p1,t1_feicny9,1579145770.0,Has anyone had any success defending with pre dug ditches or controlled burns or do the winds just carry the fire over any thing that is attempted?
worldnews,feiqssd,t1_feikpbn,1579144881.0,"But japanese isn't a tonal language.  Maybe it is possible to differentiate between excited high tone and sad low tone, or maybe their culture has a different way to express itself while still accurately speaking.  I just don't know how it would work.

As an american I don't know why some people don't catch sarcasm.  I definitely limit my sarcasm around new people because it seems like they don't pick up on it right away.  If I had to throw out a guess.  American Culture doesn't have a lot of things everyone has seen.  Those things tend to be very broad and general in their appeal.  Most clever comedies are successful if they can get 1-2% of the nation to watch.  Being sarcastic to a stranger is just rolling the dice about whether or not their sense of humor aligns with yours closely enough for it to work.  So most people only use it among their friends and family to avoid confusion."
worldnews,fehoigi,t1_fehdk31,1579120708.0,"O yeah, it totally makes sense that some languages use tone as a way to convey additional information. It's just one of those things that I even struggled with in German with the umlauted letters. 

I think it just seems like you lose the ability for the speaker to convey their own emotions behind the words. Like how is sarcasm expressed in a tonal language?"
worldnews,fehcdl6,t1_fegy2uz,1579113661.0,"Whatever the word for a rising tone being used to mark questions, is really the only time tone changes a sentence mechanically. The tone of the speaker is usually just for communicating how the speaker feels currently. 

The idea of how you say a word changing its meaning to a totally unrelated word is sounds like a made up fantasy language trait to me."
PracticalGuideToEvil,feecre6,t1_feebq2g,1579031078.0,I also think mentors deaths are normally used to force a new hero out into the world.  Since Cat has been driving her story from the start. There is a lot less need for the world to nudge her along.
PracticalGuideToEvil,feealqx,t1_fee6w6j,1579029818.0,"I don't think most people believe that the author is required to adhere to their wild guesses based on circumstantial evidence.

For a lot of people chapter threads are for your immediate reaction to the chapter. Which frequently takes the form of wild half assed guesses about what will happen next time.

""OMG she's gonna die"" is just people intentionally over reacting for fake internet points or maybe they think it's funny. It's not even a really theory just people yelling into the wind."
PracticalGuideToEvil,fee5x39,t1_fedyu4w,1579027061.0,But there is a certain amount of mutual intelligibility between. The tropes of the Guide and IRL tropes. Otherwise it wouldn't be any fun to read.
PracticalGuideToEvil,fedy92a,t1_fedicjd,1579022422.0,I thought that was a political/procedural fig leaf to allow the new independent goblin nations to negotiate with her.
PracticalGuideToEvil,fedwsyh,t1_feddf3t,1579021550.0, Cliches don't rule good writers but this world is explicitly ruled by cliches.
ADHD,feay0gr,t1_feav4d9,1578953388.0,"Yeah. Looking back at it. I rarely eat real food when I'm working on something on or off Adderall and I'm an ass when I haven't eaten. Adderall was probably just made me not notice how hungry I was those times.

Granted the constantly dry mouth, drink water, pee cycle is just annoying on a logistic level because I was in college and didn't trust whoever might be wandering into the library/computer so it was a bit involved to pack up and go to the bathroom 2 twice an hour"
ADHD,fea6w7d,t1_fe9z8ey,1578945047.0,"It is kind of over clocking your brain, I'm not surprised than weird stuff happens when you mess with your body."
ADHD,fe9v9w1,t1_fe937jz,1578941774.0,Is this why I've tried to read a book while listening to a podcast?
ADHD,fe9uww7,t1_fe9csnz,1578941690.0,I get all the side effects. So I'll come home and angrily make food while drinking 3 glasses of water and peeing twice. I'm sure overall that food was made faster than I normally would have and I need to be hydrated anyway. But its annoying that I need to spend a chunk of my productive time just drinking water and peeing lest my mouth become a desert.
nba,fe06imq,t1_fe04y8s,1578804310.0,"I think it mainly is about playing other league. Like Steph was playing ball in Korea. It's mostly to keep the nba from getting usurped by some other league with more money, like if the big started offering a million dollars per appearance for all stars or something."
tumblr,fdpq7tc,t1_fdpp5kl,1578636378.0,But listening to the marketing department is a choice. If those chose to release the game in North America with the petting intact. They still would have made more money than if they didn't release the game in North America.
tumblr,fdpo756,t1_fdplrrr,1578634387.0,"But they don't have to listen to anyone.  They don't have to cater to western sensibilities.  How would allowing non japanese people to play the game make it vulnerable to outside influences?  Japan has been ignoring peoples complaints about tons of stuff, why would this one game be different?  The only people who are interested in it, already like it.  They wouldn't want it to change."
tumblr,fdpkkte,t1_fdpi9rd,1578631194.0,But why even geo lock a game? Your just doing work to make less money.
tumblr,fdph58j,t1_fdpg8hq,1578628496.0,Is it like a legal thing? does the game have a bunch of lolis?
AskScienceFiction,fdpekzq,t1_fdp9p3u,1578626625.0,"Also much more comfortable when sitting down, which would seem important in a universe of armed pilots."
tumblr,fdpe998,t1_fdp88jy,1578626395.0,How are you supposed to innovate in the genre of Warship Waifu collector games?  Like is azur lane an actual game or just better designs?
nba,fdoi01t,t1_fdnvbr6,1578605537.0,"I think on a sporting level a lot of people are fine with it. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_Liu, is on the Chinese national skating team while her sister used to compete for Taiwan. It's super weird to me, but I guess winning heals all wounds."
Tinder,fdo8npt,t1_fdo6cc5,1578600799.0,"I think there is a generally acceptable level cyber stalking a person can do before a date, but that wouldn't tell you much about someone unless they had been in the news or it had been posted on a website.

Like yeah Google your date, but don't be surprised murders could build a convincing online persona."
Tinder,fdo7tds,t1_fdo1e0d,1578600391.0,"Internet dating is kinda the only way to day if you don't have a large local social circle or are going to try to date coworkers. Which just isn't possible for most people.

I know all the advice about doing things that interest you and finding people that way, but if your interests don't have a big local following or they just don't include a lot of people you find datable, you are SOL."
Tinder,fdo0geb,t1_fdnznda,1578596567.0,"It is really beating around the bush to put your clearly labeled baggage on the table and ask the other person ""Do you want to see what is in bag"" vs dumping it without asking."
Tinder,fdnzfpg,t1_fdny38u,1578595970.0,"If you're going to tell a date you cyber stalked her, it might be helpful to preface it with ""my ex tried to kill me and it made me paranoid about meeting new people. I looked up you before coming"" and then maybe try to turn it a ""look what you can find about someone on the internet trick""

You can be upfront while still making the truth more palatable."
AskScienceFiction,fdkysav,t1_fdjs6a8,1578513945.0,But Russia mass produced good tanks. Angled armor was a huge innovation.
AskScienceFiction,fdky7ot,t1_fdib60v,1578513606.0,"I think they were also underestimating the rebels ability to focus fire power in a single area. Relying on a cheap mass produced fighter screen, means you always need to out number the enemy. I don't know what the new Canon capacity of a star destroyer is, but I think the old one was 72.

Assuming things like maintenence exist, that means some portion of those are always down or at least not deployed constantly. So if the rebel alliance can gather 70 fighters together you should probably concede the battle.

70 fighters is nothing on a galactic scale. 1 us Air craft carrier already carries 60 aircraft. The imperial high command must of had a massive to blind spot to think they would face near equal numbers of fighters."
Android,fdfx5e2,t1_fdfuu68,1578372630.0,"I work with medical devices, so it's not even on the internet. Which is probably how they get away with being so lazy."
Fantasy,fdetzlv,t1_fdetdn5,1578346565.0,"I understand your joke, but I would think that kvothes music plays a greater role in the story than his sexual prowess. It's also a nice call back to him playing that lute until it broke in book 1, and was another event in his rivalry with the guy who broke it. It's connected to the story around it to a greater degree than ""what if someone said yes to the sex fairy""."
Fantasy,fdeqifh,t1_fdems87,1578344504.0,At least the broken instrument scenes makes sense in context. He was playing a show and a string snapped so he improvised.  His music snob audience appreciated the skill it takes to play around a failure and clapped.
Fantasy,fdeq537,t1_fdeiiq7,1578344284.0,The adem just read like slightly different aiel with more sex.
Android,fdeo367,t1_fdemwwt,1578343085.0,"Requirements based testing is only as good as the requirements. Someone on a deadline might still be forced to pass a shitty feature as long as it technically fulfills the vague requirements.

In unrelated news my offices big project was just told they have a week to finish all testing, I expect a lot of ""expected failure"" and ""adjusted requirements"" to be thrown around."
Android,fdemfdy,t1_fde4y0f,1578342108.0,At my current company it's all requirements based testing. Which is about testing only what the software is required to do. not a lot of resources are put into more free-form testing because we only need to pass the requirements based tests to get certified and publish.
ScottishPeopleTwitter,fdejlv3,t1_fdefhze,1578340413.0,If the dumped the seperatable verbs and the kind of but not really 1 verb per sentence rules it would a whole lot easier.
nba,fd75a8e,t1_fd6a1ze,1578199609.0,I mean they probably told him they were going to competitive. He might not have signed the same deal if they told him he was gonna be their tank commander and watch cedi ignore him all night.
redneckengineering,fd6pwlp,t1_fd6nh3e,1578194279.0,"So we make a ban on instructions?  on bundling materials together?  Even if people can't sell the kits, the internet makes distribution of knowledge basically unstoppable if people are interested."
redneckengineering,fd6n6mm,t1_fd671af,1578193349.0,"I mean I don't have a machine shop, but someone wrote instructions about building a submachine gun out of shelving brackets and plumbing supplies and he went to jail for that in england.  I think if we made if legal to own homemade machine guns, someone would write an instruction manual and sell kits."
redneckengineering,fd649vd,t1_fd60u7t,1578185323.0,I think machining is a much lower bar than chemistry. Most hobby chemist's aren't likely to be able to design and manufacture a new drug.
redneckengineering,fd5zpno,t1_fd4piug,1578183543.0,"There is already a market for semi-finished ar15 receivers that people can buy online and finish themselves.  If they opened that up beyond things that were already commercially available, it would explode."
movies,fczyd8j,t1_fczgsnj,1578110749.0,Bay does have an artistic vision. It just includes the sense of humor of 13 year old and valuing the pacing and spectacle of an action sequence over being easy to follow or any sense of realism. Those things are consistent across all of his films. Just because you don't like his artistic vision doesnt make it any less valid of a vision than my aunt hating uncut gems invalidates it.
movies,fczgnqz,t1_fczcci4,1578100835.0,"I think it's unfair to call transformers as mess of CGI thrown together. It's impossible to throw together that amount of CGI, considering the amount I'd man hours that go into it. Tons of people work really hard to make those scenes happen.

It's just that Micheal bays taste in action scenes, when not encumbered by the constraints physical people or cameras, is so visually dense that it takes too much energy to understand what is happening so people just don't. It's there to be a spectacle but goes too far for most people and it becomes just visual noise."
Digibro,fcyfcfl,t1_fcbs3v9,1578079220.0,"I think your coming at this from a different direction than digi. He is using autism mostly in the 4chan sense of people obsessing over seemingly trivial things for unknown reasons.

Is this a scientifically backed or medically valid definition of the condition? No, but it's basically how most of pop culture views it any way."
dresdenfiles,fcxokum,t1_fcxkwsg,1578067837.0,"Because he wanted to play at small forward play on the perimeter and being taller than 6'9"" makes it more likely that coach's would try to convert to power forward or even center and force him to play down low, where he would get beat up and out muscled by real PFs and Centers."
dresdenfiles,fcxl0nb,t1_fcxkpsf,1578065499.0,And in KD and allegedly Kevin Garnetts case. Being really tall makes people want to play you down low even if that isn't what your best at. So you lie to make yourself shorter.
dresdenfiles,fcxgt0w,t1_fcwl6t6,1578062551.0,"For the record, the nba just went through and forced players to stop lying about their heights. So KD is now 6'10"". Boozer might have been lying about his height as well, but he's retired and I'm not gonna stalk him for pics with current players."
Fantasy,fcwqtod,t1_fcwouhp,1578033993.0,"Dresden has been dealing with his issue by pretending he doesn't have any issues. Various people has tried to talk to him about it, but his lack of introspection and the fast paced nature of the books makes it hard to tell if he has actually made progress with anything or if he's just ignoring it more successfully again."
UnresolvedMysteries,fcwmbbe,t1_fcu1ojw,1578029660.0,"Ok, why hasn't the FAA stepped in to investigate large drones working in concert towards unknown purposes?  Presumably someone in the area could requisition a helicopter and a shotgun, netgun or even a high powered RF Jammer.  This just seems to close to possible intelligence gathering to be written off as a dedicated hobbyist playing around."
movies,fcvzs68,t1_fcvtrfr,1578013839.0,"It's kind of like the verbal equivalent of a Tranformers fight scene.  It definitely gives the movie a specific feel, I appreciate how well it portrays that world and the characters in it, but it can be an exhausting movie to watch."
savedyouaclick,fcvyk9x,t1_fcvy0e4,1578013038.0,No one's going to come back and check your comment in an hour let alone 8 days
nba,fcsle6q,t1_fcrp9hp,1577918987.0,"He did work with D'antoni at Phoenix. He probably has a pretty good understanding of how he coach's his teams. That combined with all the tape he has on them and the number of times they have played, probably makes him a really hard match up for them on a coaching level."
Shadowrun,fcopd24,t1_fcol7mn,1577838028.0,"I believe it was maverick, one of the comments on ep 1 is ""no josh?""  and I am reasonable sure that was mavericks player."
Iamactuallyverybadass,fcna6zc,t1_fcmz9ne,1577807185.0,"My church had a security team, because we needed someone to kick out kids who would walk in from the park across the street and start getting rowdy in the area between the doors and the sanctuary.  It's just some dads with t shirts telling kids to stop swearing and rough housing."
Fantasy,fciw0yn,t1_fciup5k,1577671163.0,I totally forgot that. You would think he would want to eat solid food.

todayilearned,fc64b7l,t1_fc5pi1k,1577471957.0,Hey don't forget Midwestern commuters just trying get places when it snows.
AmItheAsshole,fc5iowu,t1_fc5habb,1577458675.0,"Yeah, I appears that the bride is letting them attend, but not actually participate in the wedding. Which is pretty far outside of the normal ""it's their wedding, they can do what they want"" rules."
NintendoSwitch,fc3fmin,t1_fc2yy05,1577388735.0,"Developers notes would be great if they had them or if they were updated as changes were made. The mistakes might have been over things they took as fact from the documentation but we're changed and never updated, or even things that were changed in the game before release if they were given a beta copy to base their guide off of."
unpopularopinion,fbz7lxo,t1_fbz1c5v,1577237593.0,"No one is saying wanting to lose weight means you are insecure. Claiming that you love your body, when you're obese is."

AskReddit,fbv8b1c,t1_fbuqgw5,1577127100.0,My old roommates used to love pointing out that the Ladies and Fellas call and response is basically only there to get it played in clubs.  Like they went out of their way to make it a popular as possible.
