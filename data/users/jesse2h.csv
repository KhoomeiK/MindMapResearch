That source includes all workers past 16 to the best of its ability, excluding the self-employed. Anyone who has taken a fundamental statistics course also knows that when N=>30, your sample size is likely already a normal distribution and a strong reflection of the ‘true statistics.’ That source includes millions of people already.

Here’s another one showing that hourly earnings have been steadily on the rise. More than 85% of Americans currently own a smart phone. You think a cashier from 1970 would afford a similarly classed luxury back then? People today are better off than the past.

personalfinance,fdy6gsw,t1_fdxuwht,1578776553.0,"I’m a financial advisor at Edward Jones. We do no such thing. Whatever investment selection or account type we suggest to clients is always within their best interest. Clients can utilize our traditional brokerage accounts for A share mutual funds with these 5.75% (usually 5.5 now, actually) sales charges. What OP is unaware of is that those funds are usually for the more wealthy and older investor. The fee schedule is regressive dependent upon the amount of assets put into the fund family. Your sales charge is 0% on an investment of $1 million or greater.

However our guided solutions accounts offer a monthly fee-based service that allows infinite trading and rebalancing, and clients can hold the R6 share class for mutual funds, or ETFs, or stocks. It’s around ~1% annually depending upon the account size."
