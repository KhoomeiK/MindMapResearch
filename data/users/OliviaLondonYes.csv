WeightLossAdvice,ff9i0ug,t1_ff9gqml,1579713448.0,"Yeh it is battle. It’s a numbers game as you know. Any cheating will delay the final date you reach your goal weight. Something that might help is throwing in some maintenance days? Then you can indulge a bit more but you’re not losing progress? 

It is of course ok to have occasional cheat days :) it’s not that one pizza we had one time that makes people overweight. It’s our habits."
