Went back to the school second semester and then graduated high school that next year. I have a bachelors degree too. The most I’ve done with it is framed it for my room.

New Orleans is fun in itself. I did Wanee a few years. Ride Fest is surreal but everything in Colorado is, the BEST weather. I’ve been to a few different SCI festivals in Live Oak, FL same place as Wanee and Hulaween. Great set up for music and camping, went there a couple years in the beginning and they weren’t quite ready for the extremety of the chaos we brought, but they adapted. I highly recommend this site.
