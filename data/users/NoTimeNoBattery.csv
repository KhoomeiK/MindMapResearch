Instead of asking for the password, OP could make a better counter argument by directly asking the student to show their *really private* photos or intimate chats to the entire class. There's nothing to hide, isn't it?"
privacy,feq2xf6,t1_fepv3tp,1579336822.0,"No worries, I will only periodically cache all of the user's posts, photos and chats, then use the gathered information for my own purpose and share them to third parties when I see fit.

No new posts, photos or chats will be made and existing information will not be altered. The account will still be fully under the user's control and the user can feel free to further build up his/her profile and post more of their private information without the fear of getting impersonated."
privacy,feq0dan,t1_fepmzfx,1579335531.0,"Most (if not all) people hide their identity under their usernames in that sub.

""Nothing to hide"" means you disclose all your information in a way that people know what it is *and where it comes from*."

fatlogic,fct4p2s,t1_fcrh1rt,1577932807.0,"Ironically, most ""healthy food"" used to be food for the poor - unrefined sugar with ""unpleasant taste"" (i.e. not purely sweet), unpolished/semi-polished grains with hulls hard to cook and chew, vegetables so tough and taste so badly that people consider them animal feed instead, etc. Processed food was expensive af and sometimes an exclusive privilege for upper class.

Industrialization changed everything, processed food becomes dirt cheap and now associated with poor people, while unprocessed food becomes an expensive rarity because of the ""healthy food""/""raw food""/""super food"" fad."
fatlogic,fct16ou,t1_fcrfrz0,1577930212.0,"Orange juice (or any other fruit juices) contains surprisingly large amount of sugar (sucrose) and/or fructose even without added sugar, which people seldom aware of. It doesn't help that most fiber is removed when the pulp is discarded making it less nutritious.

Orange juice is a good starting point but it should be substituted by whole fruit (and eventually fibrous veggies) as soon as your cousin gets used to drinking it."
