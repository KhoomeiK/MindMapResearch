Tomorrow I'm going to a German festival, and in the past they didn't have any healthy food (mostly sausages and deep fried things), and my family side-eyes me when I don't eat or only get a single plate

Also I think I complain here too much"

fatlogic,fcppwxw,t3_ei3zsk,1577869587.0,"I've been stuck at the same weight (I think- I can't weigh myself and haven't been able to for a while) for around 6 months, and it's hard to not admit defeat. I can't eat any of the foods that stop me from craving things, and it's become a whole ordeal trying to force myself back onto the wagon. My lil idiot brain keeps swinging between ""I look great"" and [that walrus with arms meme](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/022/146/azazazazazazaz.jpg). I thought maybe looking through my progress pics would help, but it didn't :(. Here's to hoping I get at least close to my goal weight in 2020

~~I'm also low key worried that I'm going to look bad at my goal weight and all this effort will have been for nothing~~"

Maybe like a private Asian Tinder that works only if you are, well... Asian. And it doesn´t need you logging or internet, your credentials are just you.
