history,fdnuwen,t1_fdnnby0,1578593332.0,"Generally I agree. 

But the V1/V2 rockets were, in my opinion, as bad as the army drones we have today. 
And then you have the whole german propaganda. 
You have a scientist, that is commanded to build a rocket, and if he says no, he’ll be thrown in jail, his family threatened etc. 
He gets told, that his countrymen get killed everyday and that he can do something against that. 

I think that Von Braun did not have a choice, and that he also was a hostage of his own curiosity/will to go forward.
I admire and deeply respect people like your friend’s grand uncle. 

Again, I mostly agree with you, and don’t want to argue."
