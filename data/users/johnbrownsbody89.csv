This world effectively existed without protected borders literally until the last century. It is a relatively new phenomenon and not one inherent to human society. Their existence is in many cases *literally completely arbitrary* and ever changing (matter of fact, ever wonder why there are so many straight line borders in the Middle East? Because the British literally drew arbitrary lines through ethnoreligious areas that had persisted for millennia). 

The northern border of the US was drawn because the 49th parallel was a convenient thing to survey. The southern border of the US is defined by a natural river, and again—arbitrary straight lines, because it was easy to survey. Borders are 100% arbitrary."
