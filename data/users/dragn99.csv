Just yeet those games to the GameStop boys, get my ten bucks, and then buy something else. Done in ten minutes, with no risk of being left standing outside some random coffee shop downtown for an hour and a half."

The Xbone is now the bedroom blu-ray/netflix player. It's worth more to me as a media hub than what I could get for it from anyone online."

Normally you have to come back with an upgrade from a later level to cross a large gap, but instead you can just charge up a spin dash, and then jump immediately after releasing to soar across the gap.
