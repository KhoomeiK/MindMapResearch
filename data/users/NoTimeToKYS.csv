ScientificNutrition,ff5as34,t1_ff44caq,1579585505.0,">In fact what surely increases risk are the USUAL sources of saturated fat, that is, DAIRY. It's not saturated fat. It's the dairy that is the problem.

Ironically it seems to be the complete opposite: milk is usually neutral or positive, but something like cheese is consistently associated with decreased all-cause mortality. [Here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2884320/) is an extreme example:

>Results: Adipose tissue 9c,11t-CLA was associated with a lower risk of MI in basic and multivariate models. Compared with the lowest quintile, odds ratios and 95% CIs were 0.80 (0.61, 1.04) for the second, 0.86 (0.64, 1.14) for the third, 0.62 (0.46, 0.84) for the fourth, and 0.51 (0.36, 0.71) for the fifth quintiles (P for trend <0.0001). Dairy intake was not associated with risk of MI, despite a strong risk associated with saturated fat intake.

>LDL has little significance but it's still greater than zero.

Well, according to mendelian randomization studies it's actually ApoB while LDL-C has zero significance, even if this only affects cardiovascular risk and not all-cause mortality. Important distinction would be to know whether it's the increased production or decreased clearance that is the problem. 

>HDL has zero significance because it has been proven it's not causal.

That's not even remotely true. Yeah, you have something like niacin which does not affect CVD risk, but then again niacin also decreases LDL-C.

Before saying ""high HDL-C"" is not protective"" you'd first have to answer why it's high in the first place. Is it because there's more ApoA? Improved cholesterol efflux? Decreased clearance of ApoA particles? Reduced CETP activity? Some of these are probably mechanistically protective of CVD while others could be the opposite."
