But I agree, I dealt with this all the time in high school. Since I was regularly going to the gym starting my freshman year, I was a fairly muscular and lean kid but my BMI suggested I was overweight. I thought it was so dumb."

StarWarsBattlefront,ffr0tpa,t1_ffqkixd,1580147968.0,"It's unfortunate because my favorite multiplayer mode is capital supremacy, because it's sort of like Conquest+, but that plus becomes so tiring. Back and forth between the ship phases makes the match go  too long."
StarWarsLeaks,ffqvr3b,t1_ffqv62m,1580144742.0,"Maybe. From the Charlie Rose interview, it seemed like Lucas was interested in guiding the story for the ST, but when they basically said, ""We want to sort of rehash *A New Hope* and the rebel versus empire conflict"" he walked."

StarWarsLeaks,ffqqwvg,t1_ffqqsyn,1580141564.0,He should have done 7-9. Put some people around him that weren't the yes-men of the prequels and let him finish the story he started.

StarWarsBattlefront,ffpbekm,t1_ffpb7le,1580090850.0,Not to mention the actor is really good too. Poor Hux.
movies,ffp82cn,t1_ffp5dsm,1580088557.0,"Now that it's all said and done, the way I look at it, 7-9 isn't *really* 7-9 unless it were done by Lucas. The Skywalker saga was his story, and he really should have been there to complete it. It doesn't feel right without him. I enjoyed some moments of the ST, but overall I don't really consider it to be part of the main saga.

I don't mind Disney doing stuff inside the Star Wars universe. I just feel that Lucas should have been there to send it off with 7-9 and then let Disney go forward."
StarWarsBattlefront,ffozjlr,t1_ffoz2uh,1580083625.0,"Maybe General Pryde, though he got very little screen time. Personally, I'm happy with the droids and I'm fine with the heroes we have for the ST now."
StarWarsBattlefront,ffoytwm,t1_ffowna9,1580083456.0,"At this point, Hux would be kinda dumb imo. He was a bit of a pleb in Ep 8 and just stupid in Ep 9."

PrequelMemes,ffotiuy,t1_ffnthe6,1580081594.0,"I agree but I do wonder what a somber delivery by Dee Bradley Baker would be like. Before *The Clone Wars*, the clones were basically canon fodder. He gave them real personality."

Instead, Mace didn't put his trust in him and that feeling ended up being reciprocated."
StarWars,ffo2cve,t1_ffo19rz,1580073466.0,"True, but I think there's a bit of a difference between being highly skeptical of the claim and appearing just bothered and annoyed by it."

ProgrammerHumor,ffjqmfi,t1_ffjpj1q,1580004433.0,I’m not saying it’s not worth $70. I’m saying that $140+/hr (and to assume someone else makes that much) is a lot.
ProgrammerHumor,ffjmol8,t1_ffjkims,1580001789.0,$70 is less than half your hourly rate?!
StarWarsCantina,ffi5786,t3_etm1jj,1579965392.0,"While this sort of goes against what was said in TLJ, the way I interpreted it was that Luke, after adopting the dogma of the prequel Jedi, thought sacrificing Ben (someone he loved) was okay because it was best for the whole. Sort of a utilitarian downfall. It was in this moment he realized the downfall of the Jedi order, but it was too late."
starwarsspeculation,ffh86l5,t1_ffh75tp,1579925869.0,"I understand where you’re coming from, but I don’t really agree. I really don’t agree though when it comes to Vader and Luke. There’s no one else who could have turned Vader back to the light than his son. That’s the whole point of the saga, really. A story of family.

As for Vader and Maul, I don’t know if either one would want to team up with the other. Maul probably didn’t like Vader, for whatever reason, and Vader almost definitely *hated* Maul. He basically lives in agony because of Maul killing Qui Gon, which ultimately lead to Anakin’s turn."
wow,ffh34fx,t3_etcmt8,1579921817.0,"I just want a new MMO with a sense of wonder and exploration. I don’t raid that much, so WoW might hat not be my game. But I’d rather the main content be exploration and adventure than raids."

Padme <---> Aurra Sing or Jango"
