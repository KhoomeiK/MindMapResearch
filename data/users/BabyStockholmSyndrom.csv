classicwow,ff9lmg3,t1_ff96ebu,1579715583.0,"That's true. I forgot about that. It's been a while since playing retail. But it's still empty and boring. At least it was the last time I played. And judging by most people, it is barren. I would take the leveling experience from classic and the updates of retail and be very happy."
MurderedByWords,ff96sa7,t1_ff95irk,1579706181.0,"Oh sureeeee. Men do not follow media trends on attractive qualities or anything related to women. I hate this bias bullshit that people fall into. Both genders are equally susceptible to manipulation. It's why incels are a thing. Manipulation into a pathetic group. Your chub example could easily be ""Here is why women won't sleep with you! It's all their fault!"" and boom!, insecurities validated!"
MurderedByWords,ff96dap,t3_esa4sn,1579705906.0,It's obvious bait for clicks and drama. Yall are just gullible lol. You all claim to hate click bait but repeatedly fall for it. And then get enraged over it like you were personally attacked. Nuts.
classicwow,ff95c2d,t1_ff90rp2,1579705207.0,"And the rest is basically leveling without the levels. Farming is just grinding under a different name. You just stay the same level and skills and maybe get a few Stat point upgrades. Your character will be basically the same. To me, that's boring. I'd rather level an alt."
classicwow,ff8z15n,t1_ff8iy8e,1579700556.0,How is endgame not homework? It's just a group project 100% of the time. Fuck that. To each their own.
classicwow,ff8yvza,t1_ff83ori,1579700440.0,You enjoy empty zones and being massively overleveled for the zone after 4 quests? Good for you. But you seem stockhomed yourself then.
classicwow,ff8yqz6,t1_ff857l9,1579700328.0,But that was the point of the post. Leveling. Endgame wasn't the topic. I prefer classic leveling too. Retail is boring as shit now. Run through empty zones completing 4 quests per zone before leaving rinse repeat.
trashy,ff85rd9,t1_ff7h3eu,1579666756.0,....what? You idiot.
PoliticalHumor,ff85nv6,t1_ff7r3g4,1579666676.0,Haha. Sure. Protesting police brutality and mistreatment isn't legitimate. Don't let too many worms in your nose with your head so far buried. Notice how you care more about gun rights than human? Some of yall are wacky.
PoliticalHumor,ff6xgoy,t1_ff6v03x,1579636892.0,Sure. And Virginia only did this to walk around in cosplay.
PoliticalHumor,ff6o80x,t1_ff6erbz,1579631401.0,"I don't support the idea that if it were a majority ""any other skin color than white"" protest in camp and artillery, it probably wouldn't be so supported by a large part of Americans anymore.

WhitePeopleTwitter,feyf9he,t1_fexuksr,1579444721.0,"I mean, it's not that different. The only major difference is it's refundable. But your kid damages, you lose it. If you have a child fee then there should be an adult fee. You telling me adults don't leave apartments disgusting?"
WhitePeopleTwitter,fewb150,t1_fev90xj,1579407779.0,"That sub is so fucking weird. Like, why would you need a place to feel safe to hate stranger kids? I will never understand seeking out a place that hates something as much as you do so you can confirm your hatred. It's pathetic. No matter the topic."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fewajf1,t1_fetdq2a,1579407583.0,Should have a human fee then. Lord knows kids are not worse than adults.
WhitePeopleTwitter,fewabw9,t1_fetaj36,1579407499.0,It is. It's called a security deposit for damages.
WhitePeopleTwitter,fewa6ma,t3_eqkfwt,1579407437.0,"Uhh? Children don't beat on walls typically. But pets smell like fucking ass and leave fucking hair everywhere. And kids also don't piss and shit in the floor.

And adults are FAR more of a mess than kids. That's what the security deposit is for. What a dumb argument."
facepalm,few9for,t1_feuerkc,1579407128.0,So don't park there? There is rarely an instance where there isn't another spot available. I hate this excuse.

instantkarma,fen8gmh,t1_femzwg1,1579279261.0,"I did that a couple days ago. Suddenly everyone else thought I was the appointed merge master. People kept getting out from behind me to start trying to merge in. 3 cars total. I said fuck yall and didn't let them.

There are limits to ""just let them merge"". Honk and flip me off all you want but now you're even further behind now. I can't wist for driverless cars."

Fuck all this nonsense."
Whatcouldgowrong,fee2rl4,t1_fee1w7m,1579025195.0,"It's not just the ""fucking"". It's the needless personal attacks lol. Like you got defensive because you were countered for your defending comment. Do you get a prize for justifying creeps?"
Whatcouldgowrong,fedsjm7,t1_fedobr2,1579018973.0,Lol you sound more angry than you should be. You were responding to the random person part like it matters either way. You were justifying it based on them not being strangers. And that was what my response was about. I don't care if they are strangers or best friends. Don't fucking do that. It's not hard.
Whatcouldgowrong,fedn4db,t1_fedf987,1579015558.0,"Oh for sure. On her end I would be a bit creeped out too. But from our end, it's not very violent looking. Just another stupid split second decision on top of the one he already made."
