dogs,ffidyuu,t1_ffh4fp5,1579971590.0,"Here are some statistics for various shelters near me. First up is Wilco, I foster occasionally for them. I have primarily fostered pups/momma's or medical cases for them. Though not funded/mandated for no-kill, through partnerdhips with rescues, they have managed to maintain no kill status since 2010. [http://pets.wilco.org/Home/ItemId/1700](http://pets.wilco.org/Home/ItemId/1700). Euthanasia rates have dropped from 227 in the 2010/11 timeframe to 40 in the 2017/18 timeframe. However, as they are the county's open intake shelter, they get frequently overwhelmed when a hoarding case comes in.  


PVAC does not have readily available multiple year reports but there is the following infographic: [https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5baec34d755be269abff3fb2/t/5e18d791de01827f1ec1ab60/1578686373318/PVAS+Impact+JAN2020+PDF.pdf](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5baec34d755be269abff3fb2/t/5e18d791de01827f1ec1ab60/1578686373318/PVAS+Impact+JAN2020+PDF.pdf)  


On thing to be careful of when looking at reporting data is that some shelters play tricks with numbers by transferring animals that are likely to be euthanized (aggression, age, etc...) to a different shelter so that the euthanasia shows up on the second agencies records rather than their own. I have second/third hand knowledge of this so I do not feel comfortable of saying how bad the problem actually is or is not.   


San Antonio claims to be no kill, but the number/names of euthanized animals posted by volunteers seems to contradict this. I have no clue which information is accurate.  


I am not a rescuer who says every animal is adoptable, and that euthanasia is not justified in certain cases. I have made that decision for one of my fosters. We have fund raised for others to go to a sanctuary."

dogs,ffhc442,t1_ffh4fp5,1579929474.0,"Learned about the conveyor belt situation while watching the live stream of a hearing on the topic of legislation banning low cost clinics at the Texas   State legislature this last spring. Already knew that particular shelter was a horror show but didn’t know about conveyor belt or dump truck or the fact that it had to be emptied twice a day till watching the hearing.

I just found their 2019 numbers and looks like they are up to a 72% save rate vs 13.1% in 2013. Still that is 5340 killed down from 12275 in 2018 (54% save rate) which is down from 2017 (33.4%), and 2016 was 23.1%, 17.9% in 2015, and 13.6% in 2014. The infographic is only including the actual eu numbers from 2018 and 2019 though.

Unfortunately I have reason to believe those numbers are overly optimistic as recent news articles suggest one or more out of state rescues are not observing a long enough isolation period after the animal is removed from the shelter and some have arrived sick and died shortly thereafter. I do not have figures on quantities yet and I don’t think I will be able to get them. 

As for the ones that don’t have food unless they get donations, my garage acts as the storage depot for donations to two rescues I foster for. I have a company that donates 300-1000 lbs of food on a roughly monthly basis. I am typically able to forward a couple hundred pounds of food a month to them through an animal transport that takes animals from south Texas to rescues in north Texas. On their way back south, they stop by and I give them food, flea/tick medicine, treats, and sometimes kitty litter to take back south. But since I act through the transport, I actually don’t know the names of the 2-3 shelters that get parts of my donation. I see all the thank you’s on Facebook since the transport posts the donation drop offs. I think the posts have mentioned the name a time or two, but to be honest I didn’t pay attention. I know of no fewer than 6 different animal shelters (both public and private) within about 20 miles of me. I barely keep up with them, I don’t bother keeping up with the ones that are 200-400 miles away unless there’s a specific reason to.

I leave communications with shelters to my intake coordinators. I just worry about when our next preggo dog or momma/pups are coming out of a shelter, and pray that they will not be carrying contagious diseases. Our rescue lost half of its maternity/whelping foster homes last year due to distemper and parvovirus outbreaks coming out of several shelters. We lost roughly 2 dozen pups in no fewer than 3 litters (may have been a 4th involved as well, but not a coordinator, don’t try to keep track). We were fortunately spared, though our litter was kept Texas only rather than being allowed out of state as a just in case (distemper can have a long enough incubation period that the health check prior to issuance of a CVI can fail to detect it allowing the animal to travel while sick and potentially spreading the disease). The distemper homes can be cleaned/available after several months, but the parvovirus homes get knocked out for over a year before we can allow unvaccinated/undervaccinated dogs back into them."

Vets generally have a couple of things to do in checking for pregnancies'; one is to palpitate (feel) the appropriate area around the uterus. If the pups are big enough, they may be felt. Unfortunately the timeframe for this is going to vary a bit based on quantity of pups and size of dog.

A second thing they can do is an ultrasound. Pups will start showing up around the 28 day mark.

A third thing they can do is take radiographs (x-rays). Pups bones start calcifying and showing up on x-rays around the 45 day mark.

That is a sign that the medicine is doing its job since if the worm was healthy, it would not be so easily expelled.    


Doing the fecal exam is the best followup since the vet will be able to see what types of worms appear to be present and modify your dewormers/preventatives if needed. For example, some quick research shows that  Interceptor doesn't appear to cover tapeworms. However, it does cover roundworms (based on your description, that is likely to be the type of worm you observed, but that is only a guess and should not be treated as a true identification)."

dogs,ff8zehc,t1_ff8lurd,1579700854.0,"Heartworm is a bit of a problem for detection. Most states require a CVI or Certificate of Veterinary Inspection to cross state lines and be brought into the state. This requires a negative heartworm test. However, a heartworm test only catches heartworms once they have reached a certain life stage (approximately 5-6 months). And heartworm preventatives only kill at a different life stage. My adult fosters will get an intake hw test as well as an exit test for the CVI, if they were only in foster for 2-3 months, both could be false negative. They would have to have been in foster for at least 6 months to be close to 100% certain that they were heartworm free."
dogs,ff80l4q,t1_ff7tkko,1579662869.0,"As a rescuer for several good rescues in Texas that do ship animals to the Northeast, we are not making a fortune by any means. We are happy when we break even.

Some shelters do vaccinations for their animals, many do not. So let's look at the numbers if we want to do this correctly:

* Adoption Fee from shelter (varies from $25 to $100 at the shelters I have directly dealt with)
* HW test: $20 (if done at low cost clinic, we usually do at full service vet and get a 4DX so more typically $60-100 assuming the vet is waiving office visit fees)
* Microchip: $20
* 2 rounds of DHLPP: $60
* Rabies: $15
* Bordetella: $15
* Health Certificate: $50
* Transport fees: $150-200
* 2 months of Flea/Tick/HW prevention: $44
* Minimum 6 weeks out of shelter - food/housing - not priced

So if we use the low end costs, assuming the animal is perfectly healthy, the animal costs the rescue at least $399 dollars and as much as $604.   


Oh wait:

* If the dog comes back as heartworm positive, throw in another $500-700 or so.
* If the dog is not already spayed/neutered, throw in another $74 (69 for surgery and 5 for meds)
* I also forgot to add dewormers to the list above.
* Throw in some crates, x-pens, as well.   


Now admittedly, this assumes the rescue is a good one and is doing things correctly. I know of several in the news lately, that have been shipping straight out of shelters with no quarantine period and the animals are arriving sick and dying shortly thereafter. But if the rescue is not doing things correctly, shut them down.  


I specialize in maternity, so my momma's will have the cost structure above. The pups will avoid the need for the 4DX and shelter fee, but will have 2 rounds of DHPP, and 2 rounds of DHLPP.

Chiming in as a foster for several private rescues and a public rescue in the US. 

Every rescue is different, some only adopt locally, some adopt out of state, some adopt out to multiple states. Every one has their own requirements.

  
Public shelters will typically have pretty loose rules about adoption, and you can easily get a dog. On the other hand, they see much higher return and/or abandonment rates.

  
Private shelters or rescues will typically have tighter rules (**and in some cases, these rules may be way too tight**). However, they typically will see lower return and/or abandonment rates.

  
Regardless, both types will make mistakes that ends in the loss of life of the dog (frequently for stupid reasons). I know of several avoidable deaths in the last couple of weeks. Rescues are also going to be more cautious with puppies than adult dogs in allowing dogs to go to homes where no one is home all day.  


Another thing to remember is that many rescues are privately run organizations that are operated solely by volunteers. We have other lives to lead to pay the bills both for ourselves, and for our fosters (different organizations are able to support to different levels). Some organizations may be 2-3 people, some may be 40-50 people. I foster for multiple rescues that are different sizes. In the smaller ones, a single person may simultaneously be the person doing the background check for all adoptions, the person keeping track of all fosters, the person paying the bills, etc... And even for the larger ones, where we have several people devoted to processing applications and doing background checks, they may get no applications for three weeks and then get 10 in one day. So it can take time to get back to you even though we want to as soon as we can.

We are overworked, overwhelmed, and burn out at amazing rates because of the scope of the problem. If I wanted to drop the euthanasia rate at one particular south Texas Shelter to 0 for a **single** day, I would need to find more than **60** foster or adoptive homes. In a single day. That is on top of the animals that are already going home or to rescues that day.

Then add the fact that just like everything else, there are good and bad people out there. There is politics, there is unnecessary drama. There are good rescues, there are poorly run rescues, and there are rescues that are scams.

I do not dispute that it is frustrating for you. It is frustrating for us.

Please bear with us and don't give up. Switch to different rescues that are more flexible.  


As for living in the South. I am in Texas, one statistic I have seen is that we euthanize 125,000 dogs per year. There is one shelter that I know that has a conveyor belt from the euthanasia room to the loading dock into a dump truck that gets emptied twice a day because it is full."

The one I adopted our first dog from, was showing dogs off in front of a Petco. You could apply onsite, pay a fee and go home with the dog. This is the bare bones adoption process. Most typically this version is typical of government run rescue/shelter organizations or ""Friends of"" organizations that are partnered with the government run shelters.

The ones I currently foster for are larger organizations and have a more defined process in place.

1. You apply via a form on the web.
2. It goes to a person to do preliminary vetting on the application; this includes talking to you vet (if you currently have pets) to make sure you keep up to date on things like vaccinations and other preventatives. If renting, we will also call the landlord to make sure that pets are allowed, and what restrictions there are (if any). On a humorous side note, I once had to get the children's permission for their parents to have a puppy (adopters were an older couple renting a duplex from their middle age kids).
3. The application will go to the adoption coordinators. They contact you to arrange a home visit.
4. Home visit is performed. This is to help identify hazards in/around your house (e.g. sago palms, broken fence, etc...) and gives us a chance to talk with you and set expectations (my wife and I do this a lot for our puppies).
5. Adoption coordinators work with you to understand your desires and match an available dog to you.
6. You get to talk to the foster parents of any dogs you are interested in.
7. Visit to meet the dog is arranged. This may be at fosters home or your home. This step may not even take place. One of the rescues I foster for is a multi-state organization and we ship dogs from Texas to the Northeast upon adoption. We will share pictures, video, etc... in advance, but you are meeting the dog after already having adopted it.
8. Decision is made and adoption finalized. This may or may not overlap with #7

Some rescues are very loose with the adoption process, some are extremely strict (some too much so).

Ultimately, we want to put our animals in a loving home that will not abuse or neglect them. If you are upfront that you want to meet the dog and have a day to think about him/her, I personally, and the rescues I foster for, will not have a problem with that.

Assuming you are in the US, there are two vaccinations that are considered core (required). The way they are given to a dog may vary based on dogs age and whether it is considered initial vaccination vs revaccination. The American Animal Hospital Association guidelines are here: [https://www.aaha.org/globalassets/02-guidelines/canine-vaccination/vaccination\_recommendation\_for\_general\_practice\_table.pdf](https://www.aaha.org/globalassets/02-guidelines/canine-vaccination/vaccination_recommendation_for_general_practice_table.pdf) and you can see on page 4 and 5, columns 3 and 4, how the initial vaccination (which would be used with an unknown vaccination history) differ from the booster. Basically, they get an extra distemper/parvo combo shots 2-4 weeks after the first. Rabies is a single shot and doesn't require a booster (local law may supercede).  


The drawbacks to considering a dog unvaccinated if it is already vaccinated are cost (paying for an extra shot).

scuba,fen1be0,t3_epy55a,1579274754.0,"You may wish to consider a Full Face Mask. I have helped train several divers who were in a similar circumstance to use a FFM.  


There are advantages and disadvantages to using FFM's. The main pro for you is that (in most cases) there is no mouthpiece to bite down on. A FFM builds the regulator into the mask, and the entire assembly is held over your face not with the single strap of a regular mask, but a 6 strap combo called a spider strap. Other advantages include a lack of fogging.  


There are disadvantages as well. They complicate emergency situations. In a free flow situation, you need to close your eyes and it is not easy to just sip from the air stream as you are taught in open water. You will  need to take  it off. Likewise, with an out of air emergency, you need to pull your FFM off, switch to a regular regulator, then put on a spare mask. Although FFM's can be configured with quick connects (think BCD inflator hose) so you can alleviate the last issue by having you and your buddy configured with quick connects so you can link up in an out of air emergency (my wife and I are configured like this, as is my pony bottle when I deep or solo dive).   


If you want to try a FFM, find a dive shop near you that both carries them and offers a class in their proper use. If they do not train emergency procedures as part of the class, find someplace else (some FFM classes concentrate too heavily on communications use at the expense of emergency situations).

LabVIEW,fejaqiw,t3_epcghu,1579164527.0,"The answer is dependent on LabVIEW versions. 

Prior to LabVIEW 2017, there was generally forward compatibility but not backwards. The “generally” meant that there were sometimes intermediate versions of LabVIEW you need to open in. But if you open and re-save in certain versions, you can actually take LabVIEW 2 VIs all the way up to LabVIEW 2019 (IIRC - LabVIEW 2, LabVIEW 4, LabVIEW 5.1, LabVIEW 7, and from there you may be able to do 2019 though there may be another intermediate step I am forgetting).

Backwards is a bit harder. With LabVIEW 6 or 7, they introduced a Save For Previous option. So you can take a VI or set of VIs and save them one major revision back (they later started allowing more than one revision back). If a feature is being used that is not implemented in the older revision, the Saved for Previous VIs will be missing it.

With LabVIEW 2017 they introduced a new feature that allows limited backwards compatibility without using Save for Previous. You can now use compiled 2018 or 2019 code as far back as the 2017 run-time engine. So PPLs or DLLs that once would have required a separate run-time engine no longer do. And whereas DLLs could be called from a different run time engine version (IIRC), PPLs could not. However, you will still have to use the save for Previous in order to open the VIs. 

So when giving code to your TA or Professor, you will use Save For Previous and give them the output contents. Make sure to output to a different folder than your source is in.

dogs,fe8f2mf,t3_eo3sk2,1578925478.0,"It will vary widely. Are you adopting from a government run shelter or a private rescue (which may or may not have a shelter)?  


I am a maternity/whelping foster for multiple private rescues and a public shelter. Regardless of which you adopt from, one of the puppies I raised will have at a minimum; microchip, 2 rounds of DHPP, Bordetella, and been dewormed multiple times. If the puppy is with us beyond the 8 week mark (we go to 13 week minimum for the ones we adopt out of state), there would be two more DHLPP rounds, plus rabies plus 2 rounds of preventatives (heartworm plus flea plus tick).  


If you look at Emancipet prices ([https://emancipet.org/services](https://emancipet.org/services/)/), which is one of the local low cost clinics. That minimum would have cost: $20 + 2x $15 + $15 + deworming (they do not do). So we are already at $65 dollars plus dewormer (for the 2 - 6 week age range I buy Nemex 2 at $100 per bottle, but the bottle will last several litters). DHLPP is 2x $30 and rabies is $15, preventatives at 2 x $21. So you are looking at a 13 week old puppy, the rescue will have spent over $182 just on vaccinations and microchipping.  


Now, that is for the minimum. In reality, depending upon the organization, they either spay/neuter the animal themselves (public shelter), or do a foster to adopt contract and pay for the spay/neuter at the appropriate age, or require a deposit that is refunded on proof of spay/neuter.  


That ignores things like food, housing, the time of each individual who is caring for the animals, transportation costs, bedding, consumables such as puppy pads, crates, whelping boxes.  


And let's not forget that not all animals are health. My current litter was born in the shelter, and while we got them out as fast as we could, the pups all came down with an upper respiratory infection. So now you have the vet costs for diagnosis, medications, etc...

The TL:DR is keep the puppy warm, keep its blood sugar up; when it warmed up enough and has good blood sugar then you can worry about later feedings.

More details: cool puppies cannot digest formula properly, it will congeal in their stomach and not be digested. Puppies cannot self regulate their body temperature, they normally do it by forming puppy piles to get warm and spreading out to cool down. If momma keeps pushing him away, he cannot stay warm and will die. Once he is warmed up enough and past the crisis, you may need to keep him separate in an area with a heat source.

The fading puppy/kitten protocol is based on research by Dr Ellen Jefferson trying to keep pups and kittens alive in both private practice and shelter conditions. She found that with fading pups and kittens, this gave them the best chance to make it past the crisis point.

Edit: More on keeping warm past crisis point. With momma pushing him away, it is probably best to keep him separate for now. You will want a small box with a towel in it. The box can sit partially atop a heating pad. The heating pad should NOT have an auto turn off function, and should only be placed on the low setting. It should only be under a portion of the box, so the pup can move from warm area to cool area and back as it needs. You can overheat the pup, so you have to be careful about letting it get too hot or too cool. A heat lamp can be less likely to overheat/burn the pup.

Prior to and after feedings, you should try to stimulate him. He does not yet know to pee/poo, when momma licks his backside, that triggers him to do so. You can hold him in your hands over a sink as you use a finger or fine damp cloth to rub him. Doing it over the sink makes cleanup easier."

Many people here are assuming that this was what I would call a ""lazy litter"", a litter that was accidentally bred due to laziness or lack of care on the part of the owner. In reality, whereas lazy litters (again, this is my own term), are a big part of the problem, there is insuffecient information in the post title to say whether this was one or not."

Consider that there is a single shelter in South Texas that intakes approximately 30,000 animals per year. In early 2018, they partnered with a Central Texas private shelter to both improve their sanitation practices as many animals were coming out of the shelter ill, and to try to raise their live release rate to 30%. A live release is an animal that is returned to owner, adopted, or transferred to a different rescue organization. Think about that target goal. If they get to a 30% rate on 30,000 animals, that means they are killing 70% of them. That means they are killing roughly 21,000 per year, or roughly 58 per day. Every day of the year. This shelter literally has a conveyor belt between the euthansia room and loading dock that ends at a dump truck. The dump truck has to be emptied twice a day. And that is only a single shelter in Texas, albeit it has the worst numbers of any of the ones I know about. Later that year, they also partnered with another organization as well.

Note: I have seen some additional info suggesting they may be up to a 56% live release rate now. At 56%, that is still 13,200 animals per year, or 36 per day that are being euthanized at this one facility. However, I have some issues with the 56% number as some rescues are pulling the animals and moving them out of state with insufficient quarentine periods and they are arriving sick and dying soon after.

The rescue I foster for (I am elsewhere in Texas) now requires any animals coming from that shelter to be at in-home quarentines for at least 6 weeks before we consider them safe to move out of state, and they are only allowed in homes that have fully vaccinated animals, and  we have drastically reduced the numbers we pull from that shelter because too many were sick and required months of care assuming they pulled through."
puppy101,fdx5yvq,t3_en9scq,1578765621.0,"Per AAHA standards, the Distemper combo series should be given no less than 2 weeks apart and no more than 4 weeks apart starting as early as 6 weeks of age and finishing when the pup is no less than 16 weeks of age.   


The interval is variable based on risk factors; the rescues I foster for (I specialize in maternity/whelping so have lots of pups go through vaccinations each year) use a high risk schedule and start at 6 weeks, repeating every 2 weeks, because we are in high risk locations for both parvovirus and distemper).

Like yours, I knew my wife and I were safe with her, but other people and animals in my house were not.

Your efforts were amazing, but she was unable to heal enough to have a decent quality of life. There is nothing you could have done, that would not have simply resulted in more suffering for her.

I am a rescue foster, we get to see the results of home remedies that turned what could have been a fairly cheap treatment into a multi-thousand dollar treatment that the owner cannot afford and wants to surrender the pet in order to get it the help it needs. Sometimes we can help, but all too often we cannot. If a little education prevents a situation like that, we are both better off.

Price costs are highly variable based on where you live. Legally, rabies must be given by a vet regardless of dogs age. Rabies will be given at 12 weeks to 16 weeks. However, the other vaccinations do not. You will see many boarding/training facilities and vets offices that will not consider home done vaccinations to be valid. The problem with do-it-yourself is that you do not know the vials were properly stored (they are required to be refrigerated at all times), so if the store you bought it from let it get to room temperature, it is no good even if you did everything correctly. Likewise, Bordetella is frequently given as a nasal solution, but you use the syringe to mix the dilutant with the vaccine, and if you forget to remove the needle, and inject it, you can kill your dog or damage it's liver.   


As for what vaccines you should be looking for: You will repeat the Distemper combo vaccine several more times until age 16. It needs to be given at two to four week intervals. Your vet will decide the frequency based on risk factors. I foster for rescues where Distemper and Parvovirus are very common, we repeat every two weeks. Yes, it runs up the bills, even at low cost clinics, but a lot cheaper than treating parvovirus or distemper (assuming they survive).  


Heartworm testing on the puppy with it being 8 weeks is weird to me (I am not a vet). Are you sure it was not heartworm preventative? It is normal to start that between 8 and 16 weeks.   


You definitely want a fecal exam. Puppies have a 99.99999 percent chance of having worms. It is normal for them to have. A fecal exam tells the vet which types of worms are present so they can give you the most appropriate dewormer (dewormers cover different types of worms and some are harsher than others).

rescuedogs,fdnwu5d,t3_elz834,1578594460.0,"Chiming in as a foster for several private rescues and a public rescue in the US. I do home visits, I do some amount of background checks.

Every rescue is different, some only adopt locally, some adopt out state, some adopt out to multiple states. Every one has their own requirements.

Public shelters will typically have pretty loose rules about adoption, and you can easily get a dog. On the other hand, they see much higher return and/or abandonment rates.

Private shelters or rescues will typically have tighter rules (and in some cases, these rules may be way too tight). However, they typically will see lower return and/or abandonment rates.

Regardless, both types will make mistakes that ends in the loss of life of the dog (frequently for stupid reasons). I know of several avoidable deaths in the last 3 days.Rescues are going to be more cautious with puppies than adult dogs. A puppy cannot hold it the way an adult can, and if they just see work schedule without following up on how close your work is; they think that they are setting both you and the puppy up for failure.

Another thing to remember is that many rescues are privately run organizations that are operated solely by volunteers. We have other lives to lead to pay the bills both for ourselves, and for our fosters (different organizations are able to support to different levels). Some organizations  may be 2-3 people, some may be 40-50 people. I foster for multiple rescues that are different sizes. In the smaller ones, a single person may simultaneously be the person doing the background check for all adoptions, the person keeping track of all fosters, the person paying the bills, etc... And even for the larger ones, where we have a dedicated person or people devoted to processing applications and doing background checks, they may get no applications for three weeks and then get 10 in one day. So it can take time to get back to you.

We are overworked, overwhelmed, and burn out at amazing rates because of the scope of the problem. If I wanted to drop the euthanasia rate at one particular south Texas Shelter to 0 for a single day, I would need to find more than 60 foster or adoptive homes. In a single day. That is on top of the animals that are already going home that day.

Then add the fact that just like everything else, there are good and bad people out there. There is politics, there is unnecessary drama.

I do not dispute that it is frustrating for you. It is frustrating for us.
