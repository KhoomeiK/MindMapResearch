todayilearned,ffia44o,t1_ffi88in,1579968961.0,Here’s a novice question.  Should it be packed uniformly tightly?  I pack it tight and it seems to work but I don’t have experience to draw on.
todayilearned,ffi08a7,t1_ffhw9st,1579961065.0,"I’m somewhat new to actual herb and smoking in general.  Before I could figure out how to inhale properly, I ended up relighting and ultimately inhaling that thick smoke from what was already burnt.  Talk about a coughing fit, I thought I was going to puke.  I didn’t realize some people smoke like that.  Now that I can inhale cleanly, I always do a clean bowl."
Lodge49,ffgq78t,t1_ffgipbd,1579912263.0,"I'd agree.  Season 1 was a bit uneven for me, but Season 2 really pulled me in and I loved it.  I'm sad that currently there is no more."
Lodge49,ffgb8x1,t1_fff4fhi,1579902428.0,I watched both seasons live but sort of fell off after.  Is it officially “dead” at least on its original network?
gaming,ffgavaf,t1_fffy88d,1579902200.0,I offset my TiVo with a few old VHS tapes stacked under.  Talk about tech support gore!
dyinglight,ffe7uki,t3_eswauw,1579839062.0,"Well that was awesome - I just took a night hunter potion and punched my way through the power station (the one that's kind of near the tower).  Great fun, I just kept whistling the ""Rocky"" theme song :)"
dyinglight,ffd3gp6,t3_esv1ym,1579812676.0,I wonder if it’s faster running with that dagger or using night hunter potion.  Do they stack?
dyinglight,ff8702x,t1_ff7mi11,1579667786.0,Cooties - that's the one where the zombie virus hits the elementary school?
Defenders,ff6q5yd,t1_ff20xsb,1579632566.0,The one in Season 2 of Frank in the gym fighting everyone was really brutal.
AskReddit,ff4wd51,t1_ff3lzbl,1579574029.0,Your terrible but well told taco story made me remember a woman I saw in a Chinese takeout while waiting for my order.  Very loudly she asked the nice (but slow with English) order guy “Does the general tacos have garlic?”  I could see the poor guy trying to make sense of what was a very badly mangled “general Tso” by the woman.  She then borderline yelled at the guy “Does the German Tacos have garlic my sister is allergic to garlic!!”  It was a very WTF moment.
dyinglight,ff3mge1,t1_ff38oe9,1579544185.0,Agreed.  Same thing with Cyberpunk 2077.  These eagerly anticipated titles have been waited for a long time.  Let’s give them time to get the “spit and polish” correct!
InterdimensionalCable,fetyl5e,t1_fettf03,1579381353.0,I’ve seen that one.  Pretty twisted!

InterdimensionalCable,fetp2a0,t1_fetotsj,1579377851.0,How many seasons did it go for?  I’ll have to see if I can find it online.  I hope AS streams it.
InterdimensionalCable,fetooj7,t1_fer270q,1579377702.0,I lost touch with SuperJail during the second season.  I felt like there was much less talking and more weird stuff in S1.  Either way sorry to see it go.

videos,fee8vmw,t1_fee2x3q,1579028805.0,"Agreed.  Telling it “like it is” would be saying “this person has birth defect.”  Making fun of them is being a disgusting human being, not telling it “like it is.”

That’s a pathetic excuse used by so many to justify being racist, xenophobic, etc."
WTF,fedl4y4,t1_fedcfxl,1579014231.0,Exactly.  I find that the shrill ear drilling highs are cut and my experience is much nicer.
WTF,feckq4u,t1_fecjrm1,1578976297.0,"Yup, and if I may add to your advice for the kids - never bow into peer pressure about protecting your hearing.  I've had morons at concerts mutter things like ""not a real fan, can't even be here without earplugs.""  Ignore them.  You'll retain your hearing range well into older age.  Being able to put on a pair of good headphones and really \*enjoy\* the fidelity of your music into your older years is priceless."
WTF,feckk5m,t1_fecbb6j,1578976176.0,"I went to a concert at my college back in the 90's.  I really didn't have any real concert going experience, and this was in the gym so it's not like it was rocking acoustics.  It was LOUD.  I didn't even think to bring earplugs.  When I left, I was scared shitless, everything was muffled badly, like when you surface from a pool and the water hasn't yet drained out of your ears.  It took about 4 days to abate, going back to normal ever so slowly.  I've taken earplugs to every concert I've been to ever since and I carry spares packages to offer my friends.  Even so, approaching 50, I often wonder if that initial slam did any lasting damage."
AskReddit,febg97x,t1_feb2rj9,1578958520.0,"Agreed.  Let’s say a guy marries a woman who is transgender.  Obviously she can’t have kids.  She tells him she’s infertile.  Ok... you’re holding back some info.  Couple gets married, still not known.  Woman gets sick goes to doctor.   She needs to get tests that might reveal that she was not physically a woman.  Of course, your medical tests are private.  How does your spouse feel that they can’t hear about tests?  How deep does the hiding go?

I’d be crushed.  My partner didn’t feel they could trust me even after marriage?  I don’t think I could stay with someone who doesn’t trust me.

I realize no one said marriage, so this is hypothetical, but at some point the SO has to know, even if it’s kept between them."

AskReddit,fdloiw6,t1_fdk88p1,1578528734.0,"I had a very impacted wisdom tooth.  So bad that it apparently cracked the molar in front of it.  I had such problems after surgery that the dentist had to file down some of the points of the molar to prevent pressure on a normal bite.  I had such an infection (which was attributed to the extracted tooth NOT the molar) that my jawline was like a rock from under my ear all the way to the chin.  I could open my mouth wide enough to pour in liquid, I could not chew from the white hot pain.  I was put on 2 very heavy antibiotics and given Percocet for the pain.  I spent a week in a fog due the pain meds.  It got better but every year I got pain that lasted a day and stopped... until a decade later the pain did not go away.  It got worse and worse.  Finally saw another doctor who realized there was a crack and the root was dying.  When he did the root canal it was instant relief as the abscess pressure was relieved.  Tooth lasted for another decade pain free until it started causing more issues and it was finally pulled and replaced with an implant."
AskReddit,fdj5n2d,t1_fdikunz,1578459116.0,"If we can't get him, how about Hugh Laurie?  Perhaps the uber smart Dr. House persona tempored with a healthy dose of Hugh's comedic chops?  (Not suggesting he \*play\* House - that would be cheap - just that facet of the character since he played it so well.)"
dyinglight,fdcd74v,t1_fd9bxnj,1578272044.0,"I noticed while in the gargage area where you're sent to clear out all the Z's (with one big demolisher), then the alarm goes off and you have to clear the virals that are running at you... However, while still in the garage, 2 virals spawned one after the other.  It is a bit immersion breaking to have them ""pop"" in like that rather than running at you like the rest of them typically do.

I'm not sure if it's just me, but since the Camo perk is there, I use it... heavily.  I used it in the main game extensively.  It's not like the game was easy, but as long as you're conscientious about re-camo'ing yourself, you can clear giant swaths and pick up a lot of loot to sell or cash, without ever using a weapon."
dyinglight,fd9ptx2,t1_fd9d5b2,1578236529.0,"Yeah it’s a bit strange that you can’t even launch them from within the main game, but as you said it’s techland not you!

Just 2 quick things:
1.  Albert’s voice:  computer generated was very startling.  Not sure what a good answer is unless you know someone with a good voice.  I do like that you’re using the real Crane, though.
2.  The body swinging from the tree near your starting safe house:  the creaking seems unnaturally loud.  A little softer would be good,"
dyinglight,fd792kq,t1_fd5o2ag,1578201033.0,"What did you start at, level-wise?  I seemed to 25/24/24, and a Legend of 1.  I'm not sure how it decided on that...  (the only other character I play in regular game saves is full skill tree and legend 250)."
dyinglight,fd5jmoc,t3_ejx3ez,1578178320.0,"Argh, so I went to ""subscribe"" and I see it did download something, but when I launch DL and go to the ""custom maps"" I don't see it.  Any ideas?

Figured it out, went to the \\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Dying Light\\DevTools folder and ran ""DyingLightPlayer.exe"" and it came up with a list of the maps - was playing it for a bit before.

One thing I noticed is that in the beginning, if you don't follow the rules (who does?) and don't go to get some rest in your safe zone and let a night cycle complete (so that you're back in the daytime and some time has elapsed), if you go and then sleep, it cycles you back to the day time as if you went to sleep overnight, it's a little strange.  Normally if you sleep in day, you wake up at night."

AskReddit,fd4d1d4,t3_ejxtkl,1578166461.0,"I don’t hate kids but I don’t want any of my own.  Even being around kids (like when married friends with kids have parties) it wears very thin on me after a while.  As I’ve gotten older (late 40’s) my tolerance has gone down and quite frankly I enjoy my own time by myself.  Hell, I almost can’t even envision myself in a relationship anymore as I’m so set in my ways."
todayilearned,fd0assi,t1_fczw9iu,1578116176.0,"I store a bunch of pans nested together on the bottom rack of the stove, and often 2 nested sheetpans on the top rack.  I use the oven a few times a month, but like you a good deal of my cooking is on the stovetop and also pressure cooker (though often that ends up putting meat under the broiler for a bit of flame goodness).  It's an inconvenience to take them in and out, but when you're limited on space you do what you have to in the quest to cook good food :)"
coolguides,fczakvu,t1_fcyz4ug,1578097034.0,"I've had my front loader for about 5 years (at least).  I keep a dish towel near the washer.  When I take the clothes out, I wipe the seal and make sure there's no water left.  I wipe down the door as well.  The inside by that point is dry to the touch, so nothing to really wipe.  I leave the door open, which may not be realistic for everyone, but mine is in the basement in the workshop where our pets aren't allowed.  I've never had a mold issue, nor any kind of mildew smell.  When I first got it, I would run a cleaning cycle with bleach or the cleaning pellets you can buy at the store.  I haven't done that in years and the machine has no odor.  I really do think it's key to leave the door open so that condensation doesn't form and the machine has a chance to dry out."

AskReddit,fcwn0qd,t1_fcwmdkv,1578030277.0,"Sometimes folks approach things with the attitude ""Well, the worst thing you can say is no, right?""

Now that I think of it the problem exists that you feel put on the spot.  If it were me, I'd be thinking, ""Great, I can't afford to do this, but if I say no they think I'm a jackass, but I guess that's the way it has to be..."""

The greatest thing I found when I built my recent system (End of 2018) is that the ASUS motherboard I chose has this thing called ""Stealth"" mode.  It turns off every LED on the motherboard (except for the Ethernet jacks), which is pretty sweet since the PC is in the bedroom and I like it pitch black to sleep."

I have had very few experiences with them, none of them good I got a package from the next state over via DHL, and the box looked like a large animal took a bite out of it, and the ripped opening was covered in those plastic protectors they use on the packages to protect the airbill.
