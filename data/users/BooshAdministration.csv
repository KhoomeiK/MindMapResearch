Roasted veg (toss in olive oil salt and pepper, gas mark 7, 45 minutes for hard/root veg, 20-25 for soft shit like peppers and sprouts) is basically all nice.  Wrap it up with rice and/or beans or throw it into a tomato sauce and serve with pasta.

https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/simple-soda-bread This is the laziest bread I've ever baked (under an hour from deciding to make bread to eating bread).

Either of the above are great with either a basic [tomato](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/27956/easy-tomato-soup-recipe/) (saute some chilli flakes and garlic in the butter to add a little kick) or [celery](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/celery-soup) soup.

Knock up a basic curry by sauteing onions and garlic with spices (chili powder, cumin and coriander are enough to get started with but I also add ginger and cardamom as standard) then throw in whatever veg and add either a little water or coconut milk to make a sauce.  Then delve down the rabbit hole of curry addiction until you're making a different type 3/4 times a week.
