The original thread was almost a month ago, and the guy keeps “coincidentally” bumping into me in threads and berating me on subreddits he has never posted anything to before.

I want the last word? You’re literally doing exactly that, another example of hypocrisy. I never said I have some rich, remarkable life. I simply said that I do things outside of reddit to try and improve the world around me. I’d really like you to quote where I said that I have a rich and fulfilling life, because I didn’t say that by any means. 

So you’re allowed to sit around watching tv while replying to me yet me watching Bladerunner and responding to you is “no life?” More hypocrisy. I never said I have something remarkable to do at fucking 3 AM.

Face the music bud, every single thing you have criticized me for is something you have done in this very thread. If you can’t understand that, idk what else to tell ya.

The commanding officer (not the shooter) was giving extremely contradictory orders (ie “arms flat in front of you while you crawl”) to him and he was struggling because he was drunk and the orders were impossible to follow. The man was pumped full of lead because he tried to pull his pants up since crawling on your knees without your hands tends to pul your pants down. The whole situation reeked of, “this guy is getting shot regardless” right from the start. 

The murderer even had “get fucked” carved into his police issued rifle. He was also acquitted of all charges. If you can handle it, I recommend watching the video because there is absolutely no way to spin this as acceptable if you watch the video. It’s a sobering look at the reality of police brutality and their lack of accountability in the USA.

This is going beyond stalking into genuine harassment. Keep it up guy."
2007scape,fc9m8vx,t1_fc93jps,1577554784.0,"It depends very heavily on the game, target audience, and skill. For example, Hi Im Gosu, a League streamer, was extremely well know and had a huge following without even having a microphone on stream. People watched him because because of his raw skill. 

You kinda have to be a good personality to stream RS though, considering a lot of the content isn’t particularly intense nor eye catching. If you wanna make a popular RS YouTube video you’re gonna have to be pretty damn entertaining or informational."

They’re not really friends but she always comes and hangs out at those parties."

Regardless, arguing about politics on the internet will only make your anxiety and self esteem worse. You and I are on opposite sides of the political spectrum, but I’m sure you know that arguing on the internet is entirely fruitless and often leads to frustration. That kind of frustration can be unbelievably detrimental to your mental health. You may question yourself along the lines of, “I’m not even good enough to convince someone of something online,” or something similar, which is clearly an unhealthy thinking pattern even if it’s your natural response. Hell, a lot of people will simply start an argument just to argue and take their anger out on something or someone. Drop the political discourse shit and pick up a new hobby or something because I can promise you that your self image will not improve if you don’t change something. I only recommend dropping political-face-smashing-into-a-wall discussion/arguing because it’s unbelievably toxic and wholly pointless.

I’m genuinely not trying to embarrass you or be preachy, because I know some of what you’re going/have gone through and I’ve struggled similarly for roughly 13 years now. I empathize with you and if you ever need somebody to properly vent to, I’m willing. After all, we’re all human."

notliketheothergirls,fc7lgbb,t1_fc7k33s,1577511271.0,"You’re triggered over a literal non issue. The term cis is 99% of the time used only in context. Nobody wants you to call yourself cis every day to every person. Nobody gives a shit whether you say it at all. It’s literally just a descriptor used in contextual situations. It doesn’t impede on your life, it’s doesn’t change your life for the worse, so why do you care so much about a word you don’t use?"
