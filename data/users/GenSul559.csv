Never have i been so hyped before release and never have I been this disappointed. I forced myself to finish the game, 50 hours in I'm like wtf is happening?! Wheres the explanations?! Until I literally stopped doing side quests and switched to main quests only, the final couple hours where they explain everything to you I just sat there in awe. Most bull shit story I kid you not."
