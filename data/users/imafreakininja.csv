Metal,ffc3zut,t1_ffc19wp,1579790977.0,"> I feel like bands like Blind Guardian are a bit easier on the ears than say Dragonforce

[Dragonforce is from the UK...](https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/DragonForce/2289)

But really you can find melodic stuff in the US as much as you can find harsh stuff in Europe. In power metal just look at Twisted Tower Dire, *very* melodic power metal from the US that wouldn't look too out of place in a European scene."
Metal,ffbw3bs,t1_ffbpyvu,1579784703.0,I think there's a single bar over here like that but they cater more towards rock than metal. I also don't drink that much so I don't really go to that bar in the first place haha. Really most of my metal discussion is with folks on here and I've gotten plenty of mileage out of that.

Metal,ff633zr,t1_ff5zxqv,1579617928.0,"Lots of good stuff on that list (and I see some notable ones that I put you on üòâ). Really glad you've been enjoying Cauldron Black Ram and Ripper. They're fucking fantastic bands and more people should know of their glory. I've been going through my backlog as well but man it feels like there's no end in sight to my list haha. Following your lead, here are some notable ones that I hit recently

* Vlad Tepes/Belk√©tre - March to the Black Holocaust (raw French black metal from the LLN scene, fucking looooooved this release apart from the Belketre side which I thought was pretty mediocre)

* Destroyer 666 - Phoenix Rising (black/thrash, it was the AOTW of the Discord last week so I decided to try it and it fucking *floored* me, i was not expecting to enjoy it as much as I did)

* Akitsa - Sang Nordique, Credo (raw punkish black metal, verrrrrry bouncy and cool)

* Celtic Frost - To Mega Therion, Monotheist (?????idk what genre, but yeah yeah yeah I took way too long to hit these but holy shit it is so good. I only listened to Morbid Tales prior to this and thought it was pretty good but these 2 immediately left a huge impression on me)

* Melvins - Gluey Porch Treatments (sludge, despite being a huge fan of sludge I never got around to listening to much Melvins outside of Houdini but man oh man this hits that sweet spot of angry as fuck sludge that I adore)

* Soilent Green - Sewn Mouth Secrets (sludge/grind. weird as fuck but it does something that I love very well, tempo switch ups. on the drop of a dime it can be fast grinding blasts or slow smooth sludge riffing)

* The Sisters of Mercy - First and Last and Always (goth rock. decided it was around time to dive a bit deeper into goth stuff other than The Cure and this one has been on my list for a good while, very enjoyable ethereal listen)

* Uncle Acid & the Deadbeats - Bloodlust (psychedelic doom? whatever it is it's groovy and fun, many thanks to all the folks who added them to their top doom metal charts and making me interested in finally checking them out)

* Void Prayer - Stillbirth From the Psychotic Void (raw black metal, I really don't know why I'm starting to enjoy raw black metal but this one hit a real sweet spot for me)"
Metal,feycoik,t1_fey5qkt,1579443818.0,"Quit putting words into my mouth, I never said people needed to get into metal my way. Read what I actually wrote

> people can like whatever the fuck they want and enjoy whatever metal in whatever production style they want

People are allowed to have their beginnings with any band that they choose. Hell my own beginnings in heavier sounding music was fucking clean ass Scene metalcore. You're just making a strawman out of me because you *want* this subreddit to seem like ""a bunch of elitist gatekeepers"" when it's nothing of the sort. All I did was say some hyperbole about a style of production that I loath and I'm damn well allowed to have opinions and I'm allowed to share them among people that I consider my friends. Or is hyperbole just not part of your vocabulary?

You also seem to be under the impression that ""brickwalled production"" means ""anything that isn't raw as fuck and sounds like it was recorded in a tin can"" when there's HUGE variations of production and you can sound plenty clean and accessible without needing to compress shit to all hell. And for years there have been bands that are plenty accessible all across the metal spectrum without being raw, having modern sounding production, sounding clean *without* sounding compressed as fuck. And this isn't me saying that those bands aren't allowed to exist or that nobody is allowed to like them, I don't give a shit if you listen to Nuclear Blast bands and think they're amazing.

And if you think that everyone needs to have one opinion on this matter, that any other opinion is not valid, that anyone that has the opinion that I have needs to shut up and not share those opinions then *you* need to take a look in the mirror because *you're* the one gatekeeping. Because apparently anyone that shares my opinion on thinking Nuclear Blast's production is shit needs to shut up."
Metal,fevgryy,t1_fev4vw4,1579397216.0,"At what point did I gatekeep? Not liking something and wanting it to go away isn't gatekeeping, people can like whatever the fuck they want and enjoy whatever metal in whatever production style they want. I'm allowed to have my *own* opinions on what I think is bad or awful and just because other people may like it or get into metal through it doesn't mean that I have to tolerate and praise it."

Metal,fessds0,t1_fesp4l1,1579368530.0,"Dagon can go throw himself off a cliff for all I care, fuck him and fuck anyone trying to defend his actions. However, it doesn't stop me from listening to them. I've talked about it before but I follow the ""author is dead"" approach to art. The moment that a piece of art is made it no longer belongs to the person that made it, any and all interpretations and enjoyment is up to the person *consuming* that art. And with Inquisition, there's really no other band that sounds like them. The one people point to the most is Immortal but they don't even come close to that style of riffing that made Inquisition so good in the first place. They are incredibly unique sounding and nothing quite scratches that itch for me.

I definitely don't fault anyone for choosing to not listen to them. For me though, I can separate it pretty well. Others, not so much and that's okay."
Metal,fes5y50,t1_fes48wz,1579361780.0,"Hmm it's a bit complicated to explain through words, but basically the idea of compression is to reduce the dynamic range of a sound. It makes quiet sounds louder and louder sounds quieter, trying to make everything sound even. If used sparingly, it can be used to great effect and can improve the mix. If overly used, it makes the mix sound muddy and bland."
Metal,fes4122,t1_ferxjf5,1579361167.0,"For me it's when an album is produced in a way to get rid of any all dynamics in a mix. It's compressed to all hell and gives no room for the instruments to breathe. It sounds lifeless and boring, the over compression makes it physically exhausting to listen to at points."

Metal,fedj3w1,t1_fedhrzl,1579012825.0,"The thing is a lot of the bands that are shit on for being ""silly"" prioritize their image and gimmick more than the actual music. There are still bands that are still praised despite not taking themselves seriously at all, just look at fucking King Diamond and how over the top his music, image and lyrics are yet he still gets praise. Not because he doesn't take himself seriously, but because he put *effort* into the music instead of just relying on his image alone."
Metal,fedhi8u,t1_fedesc7,1579011656.0,"While I don't do much reviews anymore, I actually take *longer* than 3 hours and I spanned my reviews out over multiple days and multiple listens. I need lots of time to take in the albums, look at every little detail that there is, pay attention to the different parts and aspects of the album to really get a feel for it. A couple hours isn't nearly enough to let me fully digest an album. And a benefit of spanning it over multiple days is that you can get yourself in different mindsets because sometimes an album needs to be listened to in a particular mood to really work for you. Another thing is  taking in account reviewing your own writing, making sure you don't repeat too many of the same phrases as well as checking for any spelling and/or grammar mistakes which does add a bit more time to it."

Metal,fe874op,t1_fe83ekp,1578923320.0,"I got recommended that album as ""Arghoslent but with lyrics that are the complete opposite"", not *exactly* true but still scratches a real nice melodic death metal itch while not being overly saccharine like other more Gothenburg influenced stuff. It's definitely grown to be one of my favorite melodic death metal albums, only losing to Intestine Baalism. Glad you're enjoying it though!"
Metal,fe85kgt,t1_fe82epn,1578922835.0,"Right?? It just completely took me by surprise haha. Like in my mind I always thought that LLN was ""black metal taken to it's most raw extremes"" but with Vlad Tepes at least it very much *was* raw but it wasn't to the point of being unlistenable and everything was still audible, like actually being able to pick out the instruments instead of an incomprehensible wall of sound (which I do not typically enjoy)."
Metal,fe82rmp,t1_fe81ev8,1578921819.0,"Yeah the drop in quality is readily apparent haha. For whatever reason Vlad Tepes just has this kind of awesome rhythm to it while still bringing in a raw kind of brutality, the guitar work is also phenomenal. While Belketres feels kinda meandering and pretty cliche second wave stuff which I'm not usually a fan of.

The LLN scene is definitely something I'm interested in exploring as well so best of luck to the both of us in exploring it!"
Metal,fe7xy7i,t1_fe7jms3,1578920406.0,"Yesterday I got a bunch of recommendations for angry as fuck sludge metal so I'm planning on slowly going through them at my leisure, currently I'm listening to Coffinworm and it is very much fitting the style I wanted.

Earlier I also tried the Vlad Tepes/Belketres split for the first time and despite usually not enjoying rawer black metal I fucking loved the Vlad Tepes side (Belketres was kinda boring). They're definitely a band I'm planning on exploring in the future."

""Sea lion"" was quickly verbed the term gained popularity as a way to describe online trolling, and it was used to describe some of the behavior of those participating in the Gamergate Controversy

Edit: An important thing to note is that it's not just the asking questions in bad faith that's malicious, it's that the ""sea lion"" frames themselves as an innocent person just asking questions when really they're anything but the sort.

The [primer and lists](https://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/wiki/community) section is a wealth of resources and there's a ton of information on lesser known scenes and styles on there.

Then I found different labels that I enjoyed the output of and followed them on bandcamp, so that anytime they release something I'd be notified that they put something out. From bandcamp I started checking out little random new releases in their new releases section that catch my eye. 

And recently I discovered a method from a thread on here about metal archives' [upcoming albums](https://www.metal-archives.com/release/upcoming) and very occasionally I go onto Rate Your Music and browse through various lists that users have made.

But of course I also get tons of recommendations from our weekly Recommendation thread that's pinned on the subreddit when I'm interested in a specific style that I'm not able to find by myself and need the help of experts."

* Midnight Priest (quite simply King Diamond worship)

It's also helpful to ask yourself what exactly it is about black metal that you dislike, is it the production? Is it the riffing? Is it the guitar tone? Is it the vocals? It's important to know what it is, so that you can find bands that don't have that particular aspect you dislike.

Man I did this one in spades. I even got a little ahead of myself and did genre deep dives this year hahaha. I got *heavily* into death metal and trad, more so than I ever thought possible. I got a little more appreciation out of grindcore and even found thrash metal that I did not hate.  Even in black metal I dived so much deeper and am now familiar with a whole other world and side to the genre that I didn't have the mindset to appreciate beforehand.

> * Listen to more non metal stuff (particular focus on synthpop, synthwave and rap).

I did get a little more into it but not as much as I'd like. Rap I pretty much ignored entirely and just got more into synthpop and synthwave as well as some other stuff (death rock, goth rock and post punk)

> * Be more active on Shreddit.

Also did this in spades. I now really do feel like I'm a regular around these parts and have gotten to know all of y'all a lot better.

> * Learn more instrumental terminology so I'm not calling every single fucking guitar passage in my reviews a riff.

Well uh, this one was completed just not in the way that I invisioned it. As mentioned earlier the regular reviews stopped but I did learn so much about music terminology. This was done in part to talking with folks on the server and asking questions whenever they brought up something technical that I wasn't familiar with. Along with that I've been working on a release for a personal project of mine (synthwave though) so from that I learned a lot about production techniques, song structure stuff and a shit ton of more things.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**For 2020**

I would like to:

* Continue diving deeper into music, both metal and non metal, explore different scenes and figure out what the fuck my taste in music is.

* Actually finish that synthwave release and put it up on Bandcamp by the end of the year. I've made good progress but I keep procrastinating so work has been slow. No more!

* I'm hoping this is the year I finally leave Brazil, so if I do leave I would like to meet up with some Shreddit regulars who are nearby the area I'm migrating to. And 2021 me if you're reading this in next year's resolution thread and you're still in Brazil, don't worry you'll get out eventually!"
Metal,fcqkcvp,t1_fcqfxxx,1577887528.0,"It mostly depends on where you listen. On desktop I use MusicBee with local files and it has scrobbling built in, so all I'd need to do was type in my account info and I was set. On Spotify as well it's built in, just need to sign in through a page in your account settings. For the rest that don't have anything built in you just use an app or extension (depending on if you're using a browser or your phone). All this does is detect the site you're on and what you're listening to. No need for a different app or extension for each thing you listen on, they're pretty much universal and can detect all the sites you listen on. Though for things like YouTube it can be a bit iffy because of song titles and the like. For Bandcamp it works like a dream."

Metal,fcngcwn,t3_ei4qrj,1577811144.0,"**Most Deserving Hyped Album or Band of 2019**

I'm the worst at judging how things are hyped, but I'd put Witch Vomit. I saw some folks talk it about prior to the release and it just blew me away.

**Least Deserving Hyped Album or Band of 2019**

~~Can I put Tool or Slipknot?~~

But really I can't think of any. All the really hyped stuff that I didn't enjoy I was just ambivalent to more than actively hating it.

**Album you listened to the most (for whatever reason) but will never appear on your list**

Answered this one in a daily discussion thread yesterday, but Idle Hands. It *was* on my list but it dropped very hard for me so I'm leaving it off my list.

**Album/EP/Demo/Release you didn't expect to like anywhere near as much as you did**

Fvneral Fvkk. I thought it was gonna be very stupid like many, because of the name, but I fucking *loved* this record and it quickly sky rocketed high up in my charts.

Honestly, [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/comments/cb77mr/irans_confess_sentenced_to_14_12_years_in_prison/) where all the racists, islamophobes and the typical bad political takes of reddit came out of the wood work. That or [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/comments/b8l6u0/a_new_sabaton_album_has_been_announced_july_19th/) Sabaton thread.

**Best Thread**

I adored the main [International Women's Day thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/comments/aypbut/welcome_to_international_womens_day_on_shreddit/) So much wholesomeness and love from the community and it really made me feel like I actually belonged. That and I got some wicked cool recommendations from the thread.

**Best Joke or User Exchange**

If Shredditcord jokes count then without a doubt the saga that was MOB massacring the English language.

Otherwise it would be (can't find a link) when Dee plotted to rob a Tim Hortons but still made it wholesome.

I'm very happy they're getting a lot of recognition in more mainstream publications though. I'd much prefer them get jerked than whatever non metal but metal adjacent thing they decide is revitalizing and saving the scene."

Though with my Cloud Rat scrobbles I've listened to them the equivalent of 1 scrobble per day for more than 3 years (granted though it's grindcore so it's easy to rack up scrobbles for it hahaha)."
Metal,fck434h,t1_fck3cz8,1577715995.0,"It's more that it's just not a genre that appeals to me in any way whatsoever. Prog oriented stuff outside of a few exceptions just does not work for me the way that it used to. Good on anyone that finds enjoyment in it but it just isn't for me and it's not a genre I have much desire to wade through to find a handful of gems. I'd prefer to spend my time with other genres that I know appeal to me, or genres that I'm not familiar with that sound intriguing to me which djent very much does not.

Edit: I also don't like a good chunk of instrument metal/rock (not counting interludes, just bands that only play instrumental), mostly for the same reasons that it feels like it's a vehicle for someone to show off. It's not that I outright dislike any music that does not have vocals, I love electronic stuff and synthwave without vocals, it's that the music often feels like it doesn't serve the purpose of making a good and catchy song/album (have the same issue with lots of EDM that feels like songs are only written to serve as a vehicle for a drop rather than a continuous flowing song). Give me an album with a nice groove and riffs over someone wanking their guitar for an extended period of time."
Metal,fck36c7,t1_fck1mp8,1577715208.0,"Idle Hands for me as well, but it's less that and more that with each listen I just got kinda bored with it by the end of the year haha. It's a serviceable album but there are some songs that just very much feel like it drags down the flow of the album, if it was an album with more songs like Give Me To the Night or Nightfall then it probably would have skyrocketed high for me. But instead it's stuff like Dragon Why Do You Cry and it kills it for me.

Lunar Shadow is another one I really enjoyed and listened to a lot but kinda fell off for me and probably isn't making it on my list either."
Metal,fcjzzv9,t1_fcjy3wf,1577712209.0,"Yeah that's where they very much get it wrong. It's like they looked at 70s prog rock and thought the complexity was the only thing they should copy, not the catchy bass lines and the actual compelling songwriting. It's turned into a bunch of people showing off (at least progressive metal, not familiar with how progressive rock is nowadays) and it's really a shame."
Metal,fcjxblm,t1_fcjui54,1577709133.0,"My issues with djent:

1) Squeaky clean production, I loath most metal that's mixed in a way that sucks all the life out of the instrumentation

2) In the case of bands like Periphery, their vocals are the whiny high pitched garbage that you get with metalcore/metalcore adjacent stuff and I am not a fan whatsoever with that style of vocals.

3) I do not like overly techy stuff that feels like it's technical just for the sake of it. Stuff like Nocturnus or Atheist that uses technicality to their advantage and has proper song flow and catchy tunes? Fuck yeah. Djent and the vast majority of tech death that uses technicality as a crutch and doesn't do anything interesting with it other than show off ""LOOK HOW MANY COMPLEX CHORDS WE CAN HIT""? Nah.

4) Fundamentally djent is based off of a single sound from Meshuggah and they use that one guitar sound over and over and over again and it doesn't make for anything remotely interesting to listen to. It's like a breakdown, which *MANY* -core adjacent bands get wrong, it fucking hits hard when it's used sparingly. But when a band fucking spams them with barely any respite it gets fatiguing to say the least. Same with djent, if your entire genre is based off of repetition of a single thing then it's just flat out uninteresting.

Anyways, that's what I have issues with the genre. Plenty alright that you enjoy it and you should enjoy whatever you want, it's just not the genre for me and I will continue to loath it and avoid it."

It isn't even just the usual family being annoying, it's straight up that my family is filled with bigots and they make their opinions very much known so as someone that's closeted it very much is not a good time for me to be around that sort of crowd. Thankfully it didn't last for too long and I got to go home early and hide out in my room avoiding any and all contact with them. For presents I got one from my brother earlier in the month and I love it, it's a rainbow colored cup with a bunch of stuff written on it. For a good while now I was just using an old bottle so having a cup like this helps quite a bit, mainly because I can now fill it with colder water without worrying about condensation and the cap that comes with it lets the water stay cool which is very much a blessing the blistering heat we're experiencing now in Brazil.
