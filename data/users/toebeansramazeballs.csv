bulletjournal,feugf0f,t1_feuevac,1579386295.0,Stationary Island off amazon. The marker does bleed through so suggest a thicker gsm (this is our first journal so still learning). For now I just use something underneath to protect the next page
bulletjournal,feuffbc,t1_feuddlo,1579385989.0,Cheers! ProMarkers
bulletjournal,fet71a4,t1_fesr2p1,1579372371.0,"Thank you! The journal is Stationary Island bought on amazon. Pro markers for most of the colouring, glitter gel pens for the sparkles on the forest spirit and stars and pilot fine liners for the line work. The pro markers are excellent for blending but they bleed through easily so next time I’ll get a thicker gsm notebook."
bulletjournal,fes74r4,t1_fes2cmd,1579362093.0,Yes indeed! We’ve decided that’ll be our theme
bulletjournal,fes6j7j,t1_ferfez1,1579361915.0,"Thank you! It’s nice that you started from the beginning, I wish I had done that. We decided to wait to start until after the 1st trimester was done. Best of luck and I hope all is smooth sailing for you!"
bulletjournal,feqrwmd,t1_fepdykl,1579345324.0,"No insta I’m afraid, I’m pretty crap at most social media. I’ll probably post more pages here though. Happy to share ideas if you decide to start one!"
bulletjournal,feqraap,t1_feq6efm,1579345103.0,"I’ve got the usual weekly and monthly spreads but the weeks follow my pregnancy week rather than a typical Monday-Sunday. I track things like exercise, water and vitamin intake. Now that I can feel the baby moving I’ve started tracking fetal movements. I’ve also got things like my ‘ultimate to do list before the baby comes, shopping list, hospital bag lists, appointments and birth plan. In between all that I journal as things happen. 

Once baby is here I’m planning to switch to regular weeks then track their growth, feeds, sleeps and keep journaling. I’m sure I’ll find other things to add in as I go."

How’s your journal going? Would love to hear more about what others include in theirs!"
