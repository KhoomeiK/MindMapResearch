So, instead of taking out the tunnel, plug, etc, at the first sign of SUPER OBVIOUS concern, they thought “well maybe the rotting flesh/ear jerky will just regenerate...much like an octopus tentacle.”"
BadMUAs,ffegufu,t1_ffegmx3,1579847478.0,Yeah I’ve seen that too. Not sure if correcting the face to the neck would be appropriate? I really don’t know how you’d properly work with that situation.
funny,ffeeut6,t3_et3two,1579845362.0,This is so simple but makes so much sense. Am I the only one who craves sweets when they’re drunk?

HumansBeingBros,feotywz,t3_eq6fcn,1579305466.0,I was almost going to say “why the fuck did these people not applaud??” But then I finished the video.
BadMUAs,feombba,t1_femi0y4,1579302065.0,"Yes! Exactly. All of these steps are such overkill. It’s not necessary at all. Also, because of these trendy videos, it ultimately leads to the marketing of new EXCITING products that all these people feel they have to purchase to get these same looks, in reality, it isn’t flattering. I want to stress that everyone should do their makeup however they damn please. I just feel like this is all BS. I’m an esthetician, and a guest came in one day for a waxing service. I’m positive she mimics these Instagram videos because she looked just like a version of this girl. But in person, it looked like she was almost wearing a mask because of the overwhelming amount of makeup. Especially the thick layer of foundation.

theofficememes,fecrlb0,t1_fecdm6o,1578981965.0,"I know it’s just a funny show to most people, but to me, it means a lot more. The Office has created very deep bonds and amazing memories with people in my life that are either still very close to me, or not at all anymore. It also has been a source of happiness in some really dark times. I’ve been a massive fan for 12 years and throughout that time it’s spawned so many great things. Comedy is one of the most important things to me. A lot of people might not get it, but I’m cool with that."
