ContraPoints,ffcly69,t1_fdh9tcl,1579802265.0,"Really? Joking about reenacting the Spanish conquest of Mexico with animals in a pride parade is racist now? Twitter ""activism"" is so ridiculous and vapid."
ContraPoints,ffch0by,t1_ffaqyb7,1579799270.0,"Human rights are and will always be a political position, and the left wing will always be more supportive of it than the right. It goes back to the inception of those two terms. The right wing is individualist and egotistical and doesn't care about social justice or oppression, except when it's rich white people being oppressed."

I don't like doing people's research for them... Good night."
mycology,fdsg08a,t1_fdrx45l,1578701938.0,"In this case it works, I would link you some studies but I'm too drunk right now. There are studies in vitro, on mice and in humans showing neurogenesis after ingesting Hericium, either as extracts or the mushroom itself. Most people are very skeptical about this subject while doing no research about it. Maybe I should make a post on this sub when I'm sober haha"
TheDepthsBelow,fdpck7e,t1_fdp6cz3,1578625216.0,"Nope, and your comment is useless. Besides, stopping this practice now that the tourism is already established can have many unintented negative consequences. For example, more boats going out at sea to find the whale sharks causing more impact, or people who used to work in the tourism industry moving into other economic activities which may be more harmful for the environment."
mycology,fdpbayb,t1_fdpa165,1578624352.0,It's one of my favorite species! It has medicinal properties besides being edible and can be used as a treatment for dementia and other neurodegenerative diseases.

Maybe the museum people suspected that Trachte himself had altered the painting, but didn't think he was capable of making one from scratch."

A century older than the capitalist version."
todayilearned,fcct6u6,t1_fcchhfg,1577602339.0,The libertarian movement is way older than the anarcho-capitalists in the 50's. The word libertarian originally referred to anarchists. I'm a socialist with a strong libertarian leaning and I'm proud of it.
