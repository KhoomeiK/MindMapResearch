wholesomememes,fgse6m5,t1_fgs6kny,1581081845.0,"Ok I really want to address what you're saying as best as I can. I totally get where you are coming from.  

>I dont see how reading a book delineating exactly what's missing from my life will help me with depression. 

I really grossly oversimplified the book or my comment would have been even longer. It's not a laundry list of what's wrong with your life. It's full of interviews with scientists and people who've suffered from depression, stories from the author's life, other things. I mean I don't wanna get too much into defending every aspect of this book to the death, but I found it pretty good.

> Some people try and work very hard but have no support and a difficult life. They cant just produce the results of a healthy persons functional life while battling chemical imbalances and they need medical help. 

I guess one of the points I was trying to make is that the argument that depression is primarily caused by chemical imbalances in the brain doesn't actually stand on firm scientific footing. It never made much sense to me, although I also fell on that as my default explanation because I didn't have any great reason to be upset as far as I can see.

> If you can read a book and fix it

I didn't just read a book and fix it. Things got better slowly over time. I was able to start caring about myself a little bit more, and build on that. I read the book over the course of a couple of months, and the main benefit to me as feeling that I understood my depression. Other things helped. I was lucky to have a degree of support, I recognise not everyone does.

> then you were probably not actually clinically depressed but just depressed reasonably by life circumstances 

I don't want to detail my whole fucked up life and try to convince you I was clinically depressed. I'll just say that my clinical psychologist thought I was. If you don't believe me, fair enough.

But I think you're not so much commenting on the severity of my depression, but the cause. As in 'actually clinically depressed' people have a chemical imbalance in their brain and people who are 'just depressed reasonably by life circumstances' have something else going on. But what else do they have going on? 

I would argue that these aren't two different things. The brain chemistry and the life circumstances are just different aspects of the same depression and they're intertwined with each other. The brain of a depressed person **is** all kinds of fucked up. Depression **does** have an effect on what's going on in your brain chemistry. And of course, how could that not be the case? How you feel at any given moment is largely the result of your brain chemistry. When you're unable to get out of bed for weeks at a time, clearly there is a serious and sustained problem with your brain chemistry. But the point is that the brain chemistry is a symptom, not the cause. Or at least, not always the cause or not usually the cause for most depressed people.

To wrap back around to the first thing you said (paraphrasing) ""how will reading about what's wrong with my life help my depression"". Well it won't necessarily, not right away, but the first step to tackling any problem is recognising it and understanding it. Just understanding it helped me enormously and in my more lucid moments I felt like I was actually empowered to try to make changes for the better."

wholesomememes,fgs60sn,t1_fgru7jw,1581073310.0,"Hey this is my serious answer. [Read this book](https://www.amazon.com/Lost-Connections-Uncovering-Depression-Unexpected-ebook/dp/B07583XJRW).

It's not a miracle cure. It's just a well reasoned and thoughtful look at what the (many) root causes of depression actually are.

I saw a clinical psychologist here in Australia, where they are much less inclined to prescribe drugs right away. She recommended this book to me in the first session, said she doesn't go in for self-help much but she likes this one a lot. I only went to a couple more sessions with her before I bailed on an appointment and the practice wanted to charge me a no-show fee and I never went back. I was depressed and I didn't give a shit. But I managed to read the book. And it really has had a lasting impact for me, because I finally felt like I had a story about why I was depressed that made sense to me.

The opening chapter is about the history of the idea that depression is based on a serotonin imbalance best corrected by drugs like SSRIs, and how that idea was borne of misleading interpretations of clinical results, which pharmaceutical companies took and ran with, and have somehow succeeded in making the mainstream explanation for depression. The rest of the book is about people and what kinds of needs we have and the various ways in which those needs going unmet can cause depression. Needs for community, for meaningful work that doesn't make us feel humiliated, for several other things that very often go unmet in modern society and that can't be fixed with pills.

A year ago I was spending every single day thinking about killing myself, fantasising about ways I could make it look like an accident so it might not break my mother's heart. That book was a big part of what helped me slowly start getting better. A year later and I'm in a much better place now and I wrote out this comment in the hopes that you can get better too. I want to be clear that the book wasn't the only thing, I was lucky enough to have a family member who I could lean on through the worst of it. But it did help. Anyway I hope things get better for you. Sending love through the internet."

The problem is not the consumers. The problem is the multi-billion dollar industry dedicated to deceiving consumers. It's not clear to everybody that it's unhealthy, because their advertising portrays it as healthy and, yes, many people don't read labels or haven't had enough education to contextualise the information on them.

FantasyPL,fein80s,t1_feh5gol,1579142479.0,"I was about to say it's not an automatic success, then I realised everyone would use it in combination with TC and it actually reduces the variance on TC which is no fun. Thumbs down for this idea"
FantasyPL,feidnn8,t1_feiatsz,1579136070.0,"That's definitely worth considering, but United barely got a sniff against Liverpool at old trafford, Rashie's goal was one of their only chances. This is at anfield with Liverpool on good defensive form. Maybe Rashford's record in general is more important than that, I'm not sure I'm convinced though."
FantasyPL,fei8igk,t1_fei4ed5,1579132651.0,"I was honestly considering benching him against Liverpool anyway. Torn between Soyuncu and Dendoncker but either seem like better players to have on the pitch than Rashford given the fixture. 

I might be an idiot though."
intermittentfasting,fe7i0r3,t1_fe5wwn5,1578914770.0,"Not sure what your routine is and apologies if advice isn't wanted, but I think the biggest difference to your back aesthetically will come from developing muscle. If you're doing mainly cardio you might find you progress faster with some weight training, or bodyweight stuff like pull-ups. Keep it up though, theres significant progress in these pics!"
FantasyPL,fe6so3c,t1_fe6pw5r,1578903541.0,"You could make a case that he's been unlucky offensively. He gets onto the end of headers quite often. His header against Spurs should have gone in, and it's not the only time. You might be understating the value difference between him and Gomez. Kind of agree that at the asking price you may as well go Robbo though."

soccer,fdq9igh,t1_fdq7767,1578660236.0,I'm gutted for Norwich tbh. They looked great when the Pukki party got rolling and they beat City. They were starting to look like a top 10 finish but now it seems very unlikely they even stay up.
soccer,fdq99u2,t1_fdq83tq,1578659999.0,"Can't work it out right now, but it would have to pretty close between this and City's 100 point season where they started 19/1/0. Also depends on the points total in 18th place of course, can vary season to season."
soccer,fdq948h,t1_fdpyhb3,1578659844.0,I'm just gonna fucking say it. Top 4 is in the bag at this point
intermittentfasting,fdq8ukg,t3_emozyd,1578659575.0,"I do this too, but often for me the effect is not very significant. It helps to take the edge off for an hour or so."
