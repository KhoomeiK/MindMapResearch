CarAV,ff01vn3,t3_eqyfk2,1579464328.0,"Id recommend looking at Crutchfield for your car av purchases. They include master install sheets for everything including how to safely dismantle areas for installing after market parts. They will also advise on whether something fits for your car's  make and model, as well as including wire harnesses(typically at no charge)meant to match your factory wire harnesses. Plus they have phone support if you get stumped while working."

IWantToLearn,fe8sxry,t3_enx9t7,1578930394.0,"I recommend qigong to help with slowing down and meeting some fitness goals. Specifically hard qigong or something that employs dynamic tension helps with strengthening the body and the qiging slows the breath, the brain and the spirit. It brings you back to a state of mindfulness while positively impacting physical health."
