todayilearned,fdnz3mw,t1_fdnsgrx,1578595776.0,"Serious answer: polity and baptism beliefs. 

The first is polity (church government). Presbyterians have a more structured hierarchy. At the level of individual church, there can be a lot of similarity between Baptists and Presbyterians, since both types often have elders and deacons (although there is more freedom for Baptists to organize themselves differently if they wanted). Typically, elders handle the spiritual leadership of the church (pastors may or may not be counted as elders, or else as a third office) while deacons handle the physical leadership of the church (building maintenance, caring for the physical needs of the congregation, treasury, etc.). However, most Baptists only handle things at the level of the individual church; if your pastor is acting irresponsibly, there's no one to whom you can appeal. There *are* conventions (the largest being the Southern Baptist Convention) but they're very loosely affiliated and don't have any binding authority. Above the individual church for Presbyterians there's the ""presbytery"", which generally encompasses a specific geographic region and has real, tangible authority over the churches to whom it belongs. (Think, like a Catholic bishop to some extent) Above the Presbytery there's the General Assembly, where elders and pastors from across the country to vote on various theological issues (and occasionally issues of discipline, etc.)

The second issue is baptism. Presbyterians are *paedobaptists*, meaning that they baptize their children, while Baptists are *credobaptists* (they only baptize people upon a public profession of faith). The reasons for why both think they're right are pretty complex, but it also impacts the mode through which baptism is presented. Presbyterians have no problem with sprinkling a person with water or pouring it on them, while Baptists traditionally believe a person *must* be fully submerged to be properly baptized. This is why Baptists have loosely-affiliated conventions; they may have no other similar beliefs but they feel unified because of the issue of baptism.

A third bonus issue is Calvinism. Pretty much all Presbyterians are Calvinists/Reformed (which refers to a specific type of belief about...well, a lot of things but most people are familiar with it via the Puritans and discussions about predestination). Within the Baptist churches, there is a lot of ongoing debate/fighting about Calvinism, with some Baptists being Reformed Baptist while others vehemently deny it."
