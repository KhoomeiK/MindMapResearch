witchcraft,ffemtcf,t3_et79h3,1579854928.0,"Here is the community advice for new witches: https://www.reddit.com/r/witchcraft/wiki/index/advicefornewwitches

You might try letting people know where you've been researching/what books you've been reading and ask what people think. Or what tradition or area of magic you are interested in. 
But this is still the internet--there's bad advice everywhere."
witchcraft,ffem44x,t3_esd0rb,1579853952.0,"First, source your herbs from somewhere where they are intended to be consumed, whether from an herbalist or grown yourself. 

Also, it's the dose that makes the poison--even things as common and generally benign as cinnamon or water can be harmful in excess amounts. 

I usually research drug interactions online but there's definitely a need for more studies, and some health conditions require extra caution, like pregnancy or liver problems."

witchcraft,ff46jor,t3_erex6p,1579556636.0,"I can't answer for you whether it's wrong or not, as you have to decide that for yourself, but in my opinion Catholicism has a lot of magical practices already imbedded within it- take novena prayers or lighting candles for an example. There are plenty of Christian traditions both Catholic and Protestant that take this further and refine it, such as Pennsylvania Dutch Pow-Wow,  Curanderismo, Conjure/Hoodoo and Appalachian Granny Magic, to just look at New World traditions.

There's also a long tradition of people praying the Psalms for specific results- if you decide this is something you want to pursue that seems like a great starting point."

witchcraft,fevqw6u,t1_fev089j,1579400414.0,"For this particular problem, another way to handle it is doing work asking for her to have a peaceful happy place to live, far away from you- like draw in energy that makes her life good so she's not running back to her brother for help.  
 
Put up boundaries and shield your house. I would do a peaceful home spell and specifically call out the names of who you want to live there- you, your husband, any kids or pets. You can use black salt and your urine to wash down the doorstops- you can substitute ammonia but it's not as good for ""marking your territory"". A blue (or white) candle, with basil and rosemary. Lavendar if you like it. 

You might also work for self-mastery and communication so that you can feel comfortable setting healthy boundaries and keeping your temper, and you can work a honey jar to sweeten people towards you."
witchcraft,fevjpoy,t1_feuxd1d,1579398164.0,"You did the right thing throwing the plant with spider mites out before it infected all the other plants. 

Some people believe that if your plants suddenly die it's because of bad energy, but honestly this really sounds like plants that aren't happy indoors limping through the winter. I have several that are pretty grumpy right now. They will be fine come spring. With the Rue try more light and make sure it is draining well. 

Doing protective work and shielding is always a good idea though, just as a matter of course! Instead of keeping dying plants around to absorb evil energy, shield, so that bad energy can't hit you or yours!"
witchcraft,fevfnwz,t3_eqp0u1,1579396871.0,"General protection and shielding. You can make a sigil, or an amulet for protection and personal power. 
 
If you are interested in Christian folk magic or conjure I have heard great things about St. Martha the Dominator helping control unruly men. 

If you work with a pantheon, you might call upon the appropriate goddess. Artemis would be a good choice . Sekhmet is a very strong defender!"

AmItheAsshole,fetqrto,t3_eqkqj3,1579378513.0,"NTA but this was handled very poorly. I would not be ok with an overnight with parents I didn't know well. However, I'm guessing that isn't a rule you have because your daughter would already know you don't do overnights in that case. I would be additionally concerned about supervision-- and a pool party would add to that because I'd be concerned about water safety.  

You should have gotten the parents' number and talked to them about logistics- who is coming, who is staying, what kind of supervision, where is the hotel, etc.

Your comments about someone being ""trans-ish"" and that they might watch porn are bizarre. 

Why didn't you talk to the parents about your concerns?"

I think keep up the uncrossing and protection work. What is your tradition background? It might help me tailor some advice for you.

witchcraft,fdd9ter,t3_ek5p5z,1578301563.0,"It sounds like you are suffering from crossed conditions. I would try a series of uncrossing baths (since your crossed conditions seem pretty intense, a 13 day run seems called for). After the uncrossing baths, you can do divination for your next steps. 

This link has detailed instructions and a list of uncrossing herbs: https://unseenseraph.com/how-to-create-uncrossing-bath/
There is one additional step that can add extra oomph- save some of the bath water in a jar (you only need a cup or two). Go to a crossroads and throw it behind you. Leave without looking back.
 
I'd add drinking mint and chamomile tea with honey, but you could choose other edible herbs with the proper attributes if you don't like those. Sweeten the tea, at least a bit, to help bring sweetness to your life."

witchcraft,fctst5s,t3_einl60,1577957662.0,"It can be pretty overwhelming. I like lavender in general but some brands and varieties smell terrible to me. Even when I like it, I don't find it relaxing. It smells like ""clean"" to me, like how most people feel about lemon. 

You are not alone though- I know lots of people who don't like lavender. Some of them don't like it because it gets so aggressively pushed for stress-- instead of the lavender relaxing them, it makes them think of the times they were stressed."
witchcraft,fctrr46,t1_fcsnogj,1577956094.0,"By put up wards I mean using defensive magic to protect yourself--like a sheild. There are lots of different approaches. A simple way many people use is to visualize light surrounding them with the intention that nothing bad can get in. You can picture a big silvery bubble, like a two-way mirror, and state that good things can come in but negativity is bounced back to the sender. Sigils, witch bottles, and guardian spirits are other popular methods. You can wash your windows and doors while visualizing that you are protected. If you can make a chant and recite it while washing, all the better! You could make an infused Four Thieves style vinegar (recipes vary, I like ones with rosemary, thyme and mint for this purpose) and use that in the wash water. 

There are many many different ways to establish wards--it's important that whatever you choose is meaningful to you. If visualization is more challenging for you, sigils and amulets might help- a really simple but effective sigil I have used is a white square with an x in it. You draw it without picking up the pen, and stick it with the written on side facing the wall (so it just looks like a little white square once it's up). You draw one for each wall, and put them up going counterclockwise in the room. These squares can be made very small if needed so they can still be discreet.  

Dion Fortune's ""Psychic Self-Defense"" is a classic text. It's readily available. It's been a long time since I have read it, so I can't remember how much background one needs for it to be useful for someone. She practiced Ceremonial magic so some of it won't fit well with other traditions."
witchcraft,fcr8u41,t3_eiis62,1577898453.0,"I would be very skeptical of someone who told me that I had a spiritual problem, and that they could fix it--for a fee. That is a common scam. 

If you aren't feeling good energetically, you could try a run of spiritual cleansing baths. Hyssop is a traditional herb used for this, but there are others. Cleanse your space and put up wards. Also it is important to physically clean your space, and get regular exercise. This advice assumes you have been assessed to make sure you aren't suffering from depression--if you are clinically depressed that will need to be treated as well as any spiritual issues.  

It's not flashy but walking in a natural setting for 20 minutes a day can do wonders for your energy fields!"

Half of kids under 5 are chronically malnourished (this is one of the highest malnutrition rates in the world). The police are corrupt and ineffectual, and bribery and extortion is common.
