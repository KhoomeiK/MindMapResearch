infj,fgmxdp7,t3_ezdb0p,1580933823.0,"Initiating a relationship could be a challenge without the crutch of the internet/cell phones.

One interesting thing I noticed is all of my long term relationships were established because the internet exists. Even in high school, myspace and AIM allowed me to talk to my potential partners and express myself, since I had time to process what the other person was saying, and articulate what I wanted to say.

In person, I'm stand offish. Sometimes I quietly pay attention to what's going on around me, sometimes I'm in some abyss contemplating existentialism. Guys often told me they thought I was judging them, or just completely disinterested. The loud, energetic girls got the attention, and I could not compete with it. So the ability to text/chat online really carried me.

If I grew up before the 90s/2000s, that would definitely be a challenge for me.

To note: I met my husband by accident online, and we had two years of a long distance relationship to really get to understand each other's brains. By the time we moved in together, it was like we'd been together a lifetime. It's an INFJ's dream."

Sometimes you just grow with your partner.

For example, my husband is a bagpiper. Sure, I have some Scottish ancestry, but before him, I never thought about bagpipes. Now I'm out there with the bagpipe band during fun gigs, and listening to the music on my own time. I'm a pianist and make a point to learn songs that can be played with bagpipes. It's not like I'm stealing it from him, it's just that I didn't know how fun it was before him and I want to be part of something that's important to him.

I've always been an environmental and public health advocate. I volunteer with a lot of organizations. A year or so into our relationship, he started coming to the events with me, and we end up having so much fun.

We started on opposite sides of the (American) political spectrum and have harmoniously met in the middle and pretty much agree on everything now.

Think about how much stress you're willing to deal with, and for how long. You might feel pressure to get perfect grades in the ASN program if you're worried about getting into a BSN program (although I don't know what the acceptance rates are), and that may alter your experience and make it more stressful.

My first degree was in public health, and I will say, I was always in the minority with my ""solutions"" for societal health issues. I received a lot of criticism, because I always felt like just placing the nexplanon  (birth control implant ) in all medically qualified girls once they hit menarche would solve a lot of unintended pregnancies. I also thought that requiring mandatory blood tests for infectious diseases was a good idea. I had a plan for how we could make it happen and everything - but intellectually I knew, and still know, that it violates free will and human rights. 

It doesn't mean I don't still think it's a good idea - population reduction and people will be able to be treated for infections they don't know they have and are spreading - but it takes some serious contemplation to understand why it's not right.

My Irish and Italian sides raised me to cherish those heritages, so I just tell people I’m half Irish and half Italian (nothing against the Croatians, just was never really mentioned growing up). 

I love celebrating and identifying with both even though my percentages aren’t super high. 

Yes I’ve been made fun of by Irish (like living in Ireland) people before but it’s not a malicious thing. 

There are no rules when it comes to this stuff!"
