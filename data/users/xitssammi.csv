But the nurses go over it with an incorrect value in normal range anyway because the news score goes up and they don’t want that. So whatever :’-)"
Frugal,fgjuieg,t1_fgimfeu,1580851644.0,"You probably won’t get thorough health care from an optician in this case, you may need to go to an ophthalmologist (actual MD). America’s Best usually has an optician (not MD). An optician may help with your eyeglass prescription for these cases, but an ophthalmologist will not do work pertaining to your visual correction. They are more focused on the health of your eyes. They are both important for those with eye disorders.

Personally I don’t like big chains even for optometry, but my prescription was severely messed up by a local/privately owned optician which led to years of frequent migraines, so I can’t tell you that local is better."

I think right now at my school, because my state passed medical marijuana, you can get exemptions for the drug testing part, however if you arrive at clinical visibly impaired/high they send your ass home and fail the clinical day. However I only got tested on entry into the clinical program

StudentNurse,fgj5nuc,t3_eyjyxh,1580837447.0,"Is he medicated?

Make sure he sets reminders, calendar dates, and gets everything for class/clinical ready the night before. I also meal prep everything which helps with my time management. Basically gotta understand you have a bad memory plus disorganization and really overcompensate for it.

If it was a problem, I would inform my clinical instructors and ensure that I don’t have a distracting environment when preparing meds for patients. He could also get more time on exams through a disability center in school, if he struggles with time limits.

I have ADHD but am among the top in my class! It’s totally possible to succeed. I am medicated though."

dogs,fggofrv,t1_fgfup36,1580766094.0,"My dog was separated from his litter at 5 weeks and mom at 8 weeks, it was a big challenge to socialize him. I wouldn’t have chose that if I had a say. He struggled to learn bite inhibition and plays rough with his dog friends. He still plays really rough with us but luckily doesnt play-bite or have any genuinely aggressive behavior, maybe the occasional leash aggression from afar but he is fine once he is introduced to the dog. 

That being said, he fixed him at 6 months and spent the first year of his life socializing him with other dogs and people. We only socialized him with kids a little so I am very apprehensive and careful when around kids. My main point is that early separation doesn’t excuse bad behavior, they can still learn socialized and good behaviors if you are patient while they are puppies. It’s hard to socialize a dog that wasn’t socialized as a puppy."

Every time I vented with “I couldn’t find my keys...” they would that I shouldn’t have waited until last minute or kept my keys in a designated spot. It was really, really frustrating because I just wanted to be heard, but honestly they were right.

ADHD,fgebtbg,t1_fgckfwj,1580695989.0,"I think my best advice which I’m sure you’ve heard, is really get everything ready for the morning. Do not save ANYTHING for the morning except like hygiene, getting dressed, and driving to work. When I do this I won’t have a meltdown over being late or losing something. 

I think it may be beneficial to be dressed and ready to go, and then meditate with an alarm before leaving. Try to prioritize things - if you give yourself 45 minutes to meditate, then if something goes wrong while getting ready, you’re either late to work or have to rush to get ready. Realistically it would be better to sacrifice meditation time in case problems came up while getting ready, because at least you wouldn’t be late.

Call ahead if you are running late, tell your boss why you won’t be late in the future. Make that change. I use lots of phone alarms and reminders to keep myself exactly on time, if not early to work. Literally everything is ready by the door, lunch made. 

It looks bad for yourself and others with ADHD if you use it as an explanation for an error - because not everyone with ADHD will have those problems, it isn’t 100% the adhd. It would be better to say “I am still figuring out how to stay on top of my ADHD, next time I’ll (make x change)”. It’s harder but reasonable of him to expect his employees to be prepared for work, you are paid the same as everyone else and should have the same expectations"

I will use one if a patient who *wants* to be in bed doesn’t fully stay in bed, like their leg starts hanging out etc. Or would be too weak to climb over, I guess. Our hospitals LTC / SNF does a lot of research with falls (like motion monitoring) and lots of patients were just climbing over the rails and eating shit."
