depression,fegywj2,t3_eoxun3,1579105603.0,"It’s scary.  I don’t know whats under the depression.  I don’t know what life would even be like without it. I’m 52 years old and been depressed, to some degree or more, since puberty.  I totally get it.  Being depressed is the known feeling, the thing that you are used to.  For me, its also the excuse.  If I’m depressed, it makes it all ok.  I’m not just lazy or a fuck up.  It’s because I’m depressed but what if i get better and I’m still lazy and a fuck up?"
depression,fegy9qf,t1_feg48f7,1579105208.0,Hugs.  You are not worthless.  You are worthy of self love and self care.  Hugs hugs
depression,fegy1y2,t3_cml6ni,1579105074.0,"Today, is my first post here.  Ive gone through a very rough couple of weeks but i am almost hopeful that i am on an upward path.  Our lives are a mess right now.  We are filing for bankruptcy and paid back in October but i have had trouble getting all the paperwork together.   Now, his wages are being garnished.  We are rehabbing a rental house that we own to move into because we can’t afford this one and it’s taking forever.  On top of all of that and it being winter so my sad is acting up, we suddenly lost our best friend at the end of December.  I haven’t been taking my cymbalta since then and i was drinking heavily a few times to deal with it all.  So, then my stomach went nuts.  I think i have an ulcer but i need to go to the doctor but who has the energy for that?  I feel like stress and my depression is killing me.  So, today, i was breaking down and my husband called from work.  He made me get up and take my cymbalta and refused to hang up until i did and until i ran a bath.  I broke down in the tub and then realized that my beautiful friend would only want the best for me and for me to be healthy and happy.  With that in mind, I’ve managed to go back to our family room and dig out my therapy light.  It can only get better, or at least it can’t get much worse"
