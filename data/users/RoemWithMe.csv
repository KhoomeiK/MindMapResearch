ftm,ffkdn35,t3_eu38qs,1580021042.0,Look up Vital Statistics for Alberta and they should have a list of requirements for name change. If you can't find it then there should be a number to call.

FTMOver30,ffk163p,t3_esln6c,1580012648.0,"The T enanthate works much better for my body than the T cypionate. I noticed a quick change in new hair growth, fat redistribution, lower voice, and general mood stability when I switched over. There is less of a 'peak and valley' affect for me on the enanthate.

Edit: I do weekly shots, SubQ, was on cypionate for about a year and switched to delatestryl a few months ago but have had to switch back due to pharmacy supply issues. I would recommend monthly bloodtests until you know how your body reacts to it (my T levels skyrocketed)."

awfuleverything,ffeqq9z,t1_ffdrxni,1579860805.0,Looks like Keloid scars after a bad reaction to the ink. Red ink is notorious for allergic reactions and some people are genetically more likely to keloid like this.
