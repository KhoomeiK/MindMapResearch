HomeImprovement,ffmv615,t1_ffmtkgp,1580059303.0,"Is it electric? Or gas? If it’s a gas water heater you may not want to mess with it. If you run the hot water from a faucet, so that it helps drain it so you don’t burn yourself, you should just be able to remove it fairly easily because there’s no pressure built up in the tank. There’s probably some good YouTube videos. I swapped out a heating element in the side of my electric tank without draining it. Just ran the tap on hot for a bit and tried to do it as quick as possible. It did get the floor wet but it worked."

Pretty much everything else (shy of strange foreign delicacies , that I’d certainly be willing to try under most circumstances) is fair game. Over time, I would retry things I didn’t like previously and many times they weren’t as bad as I remembered. I’m not sure the biological terms, but it’s like as I got older my taste buds changed how I perceived foods.
