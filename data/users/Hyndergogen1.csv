Cringetopia,ffqbjky,t1_ffqa23n,1580129337.0,Oh fuck out of here with your pseudo science nonsense.
BrandNewSentence,ffqacgf,t1_ffq3yyl,1580128064.0,Yeah unfortunately I now have lead poisoning and am actually dead.
traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,ffqab9f,t1_ffq4f4p,1580128026.0,"It very specifically is supposed to be though. That's kind of the entire point. Yes science IS bastardised to prop up bullshit, but that's not the science's fault it's ours. IQ for instance is an incomplete and racially biased measure of intelligence, but that's because it's not a measure of ""intelligence "" it's a measure of ability ot perform certain tasks, tasks that are easier for people who grow up in wealthier backgrounds, wealthier backgrounds that are disproportionately white in the developed world. 

That does not make the raw data from IQ tests racist. It makes the application of it racist. Yes science is performed and informed by human biases, but so is literally everything a d no one would ever be able to have a practical discussion about anything if we spent the entire time disucssing the 7 billion possible different perspectives. 

Science tells us that trans people exist. Society tells us we should care about them. Science does not. It is, theoretically, neutral. And taking into account the biases of the experimental method is merely a  extension of the scientific method.

 Even if the experiment is designed and performed by a transphobe for the express purpose of transphobia, that does not make.the numbers transphobic, it makes the scientist transphobic. Your point about science being performed and informed by humans is true, but unhelpful. Yes there are many bigtoed scientists but thay doesn't make the underlying numbers incorrect or bigoted. For example the famous right wing talking point a out black people making up 13% of the U.S.A's population but a disproportionate amount of crime. Now those conviction numbers are not racist, they are merely an expression of trends. What is racist is saying that those numbers are caused by black peoples inferiority, rather than a myriad of social and economic factors.

I still fundamentally do not get whyI'm being downvoted. I am factually right. The numbers cannot have an opinion or a morality, they're fucking numbers, it's our use and interpretation that imbues them with prejudice, bigotry, opinion."
BrandNewSentence,ffq39g9,t3_eulq1r,1580118011.0,"Made some ribs for my dad and I which involved brushing them with BBQ sauce before grilling, and the only brush available was one of my mums scabby old paint brushes which we scrubbed with hand sanitizer and steel wool. Today I'm going to get a new one."
collapse,ffq0xxo,t1_ffpt758,1580114396.0,Fuck the trial whos going to stop you through all that fire?
traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,ffq0fst,t1_ffpxfqu,1580113652.0,"Well now hold up there. I'm all about trans rights but that's me applying my morality to the science. The science absolutely doesn't say anyone should care about anything, it just observes what happens and sometimes explains it. The science tells us only that trans people exist it says nothing about whether or not someone should care about them.

Edit: Don't know how this can be downvoted science has no morality. It is inherently amoral. It can be used for good and bad. Not sure what's controversial about that fact. Clearly it's people who are salty I didn't say cold hard science tells us trans people should be valued, well I hate to break it to you but morality is subjective. I may believe in trans rights  but that doesn't make me inherently, spiritually or transcendentally correct. I have a better justification for my morality than a transphobe but that does not make me definitively right. Merely probably righf.h"
LeopardsAteMyFace,ffpwjiq,t1_ffpwfwd,1580108514.0,There's a difference between a rant and having to take a long time to calmly explain how monumentally stupid you are. It's clear nuance is lost on you but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist.
LeopardsAteMyFace,ffpvlpe,t1_ffpvclk,1580107409.0,"That'd still make me 6 times smarter than you. Also you don't know what the word grammar means. It is not just a synonym for paragraph break. I will repeat this for the umpteenth time, don't patronise people whilst simultaneously getting shit wrong and looking immensely ignorant. It undermines your whole argument. Well assuming you had one that is."
LeopardsAteMyFace,ffpu8fb,t1_ffptonu,1580105908.0,"Those are very definitely bold claims backed up by exactly zero evidence or coherent argument. And if anyone is triggered here it's you, who is so committed to the mental image you have of yourself you're bending reality to fit it. Also I'm aware you didn't invent the word what a stupid comment to make, literally no one thought you made the word up. On top of that, it'd be useful if you could tell when someone made that switch, but you can't. No one can, you especially as you don't seem to have a way of forming ideas other than feeling your emotions and then building a justification around them after the fact. Nothing you say is right, at all, ever. You could say the sun rises in the east and the poles would somehow flip because you being wrong seems more of a universal law than any of Newtons."
LeopardsAteMyFace,ffpsyzs,t1_ffpsijz,1580104570.0,"That very much does not surprise me, it's incredibly common for simpletons to laugh when they're confused and don't know how to react appropriately. 

Shall we list just some of your bold, and incorrect, claims:
1: You think it's okay to advocate for the unnecessary human death and suffering that would be caused by the erosion of Social Security.

2: You're not an actual Lefty.

3: Lol, triggered(this has to be the worst because it's the lowest effort, this is some T_D shit)

4: I think your position is morally-impoverished.

5:you're not even pragmatic

6:You're in over your head.

7: you don’t even know what you’re here having an argument about 

8: You’re just really mediocre so you can’t see that you’re just yapping at my ankles

There's 8. Are you going to continue to deny, lie and deflect or having been presented with facts contradictory to your position will you do the mature thing and admit you were incorrect. Or I suppose you could ignore it because it is impossible for you to deny this and admitting failures is just a no-go for you and your gargantuan ego."
LeopardsAteMyFace,ffpsgj8,t1_ffps8an,1580104048.0,"Ok so is it opposite day or something where you live? You very clearly don't understand socialism and yet wanted to make bold claims about it and how it would leave people who rely on social security to die. Yet I engaged with your bullshit. You didn't teach me anything, because you don't even understand the basic underlying concepts behind the conversation."
LeopardsAteMyFace,ffpsafv,t1_ffps0nk,1580103879.0,"Are you... are you not human or something? You use several words in ways that are not appropriate for their definitions. I'm quite clearly, verbally, on the offensive and you are trying to defend your non-existent intellect. I'm not here for your validation, I'm here enjoying watching you spin ineffectually like a Catherine wheel that's fallen off it's peg. It's like watching a dog run into a glass door repeatedly."
LeopardsAteMyFace,ffprx0c,t1_ffpruz9,1580103517.0,"There is, you just don't want to engage with it as it would force you to confront your own failings which you're clearly incapable of."
LeopardsAteMyFace,ffprudn,t1_ffprrq1,1580103448.0,"Except you didn't prove shit, you were wrong about all of it."
LeopardsAteMyFace,ffprsg8,t1_ffprdzh,1580103396.0,"Don't blame my perfectly legible and intelligible writing for your lack of reading comprehension, everyone else can read my writing just fine. That's on your primary school teachers, it has nothing to do with me. I also appreciate how you have gone further and further from the original point, you're misunderstanding of socialism and moral grandstanding, to try to maintain your ego and find some way you can feel good about this, instead of just admitting your ignorance. 

You're combination of ignorance and arrogance is astounding and I honestly don't know how you can actually have these thoughts and type these comments without your brain actually overheating from cognitive dissonance."
LeopardsAteMyFace,ffpr8e3,t1_ffpqspj,1580102857.0,"Well you could actually admit you were talking shit from comment one and own up to your asinine nonsense, but then your ego would implode wouldn't it and that wouldn't be safe."
LeopardsAteMyFace,ffpr6kz,t1_ffpqv4u,1580102810.0,"You didn't imply it. You explicitly stated it. Again if you're going to be patronising it usually helps to know what you're talking about. Actually if you're going to say anything about any topic it's pretty important to know what you're talking about, however I appreciate that were you to not comment on things you didn't understand you'd literally never speak so I get that you need to speak sometimes, maybe just limit it to ""I feel"" statements so no one can just repeatedly dunk on your dumb ass as has happened here. 

It's clearly not ineffectual either someone who's secure in their intelligence doesn't have to repeat it so often to strangers, it makes it obvious you're not trying to convince them but yourself. Genuinely intelligent people just exist and let others draw their own conclusions rather than repeatedly bringing it up and talking about how smart they are, what they're IQ is or how dumb everyone but them is. Though of course I wouldn't actually expect you to know how intelligent people act having never actually spent any time with any of them."
politics,ffpqu9m,t1_ffpim65,1580102484.0,Is she going to get anymore interviews from Pompeo anyway? And at some point the News organisations have to say fuck it we're pressuring them and stop just rolling over.
LeopardsAteMyFace,ffpqsho,t1_ffpbrbj,1580102438.0,"Yes, I can attack your minuscule intellect, I literally just did. Watch I'll do it again; you're a self important cretin. How can someone be so confident without doing or saying anything to earn that confidence?"
LeopardsAteMyFace,ffpqne6,t1_ffpbhof,1580102306.0,"You don't get to pretend you're somehow in the right here when you fundamentally don't understand leftism. I clarified that there would be something there to replace it, not because I was changing my views, but because you don't know what socialism is. I still support abolishing Social security. And you're the one who asked for a quote showing that you had missed me explicitly, after me implicitly, saying there would be support that did the same job as social security. You have been somehow incredibly arrogant and completely wrong at every single turn in this thread, and have spent far more time verbally wanking than actually making a coherent and correct retort. You also seem to have some sort of superiority complex because you talk like a less intelligent Dennis Reynolds from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. Next you're start calling us your minions and talking about how you're a golden god on the mountain top."
LeopardsAteMyFace,ffpann7,t1_ffp498u,1580090324.0,Like is this account some kind of performance art piece examing how wilfully ignorant a person can be before no one will react to them or is your ego just that fragile and your intellect so microscopic?
iamatotalpieceofshit,ffpajzv,t1_ffp52c1,1580090254.0,Ok but you said they're literally the worst people. Do you stand by that?
LeopardsAteMyFace,ffpahp9,t1_ffp498u,1580090211.0,"What argument do you think we're having? Because in reality you're saying I'm immoral for wanting to cause damage by removing social security. Then someone pointed out I had accounted for that, you asked for a quote so here it is."
iamatotalpieceofshit,ffp46uy,t1_ffosaeg,1580085807.0,Is that really the worst thing you can think of a person doing? Boy I envy your lack of imagination.
LeopardsAteMyFace,ffp42ua,t1_ffp25no,1580085728.0,"I love that you pretend like you would accept being proven wrong when you've repeatedly shown you have no interest in admitting your bullshit. But still I'll play the game, here's the quote you managed to miss despite it being the vast majority of my comment:

 ""It's part of the capitalist systems way of making sure people are juuuuuust comfortable enough to not fight back, removing that removes the need for social security because people would already be provided with their needs"""
LeopardsAteMyFace,ffp3eo5,t1_ffp2dx7,1580085498.0,Oh right so if I wouldn't want to tear down the infrastructure of a country overnight with nothing to replace it I'm a conservative? By your definition there are nothing but conservatives and never have been. Don't get pissed at others when you require an entire Nursery to University education to begin to understand what the fuck you're talking about.

HistoryMemes,ffp2dnh,t1_ffokro1,1580084783.0,"It would be 0. Jesus blood wasn't wine, the wine just turns into Jesus Blood. Duh! This shit is obvious. The saviour of earth, who was magically jizzed into a virgin without her ever actually coming into contact with said jizm by an omnipotent being, but is also part of the omnipotent whilst also also being seperate from the omnipotent being, comes back to life every sunday so hundreds of millions around the world can eat his body and drink his blood, what's so hard to understand about that."
HistoryMemes,ffp1zbq,t1_ffojeqd,1580084559.0,"And he's still a Catholic, so you know not that great. He demoted the guy in charge of overseeing the sex a use scandals for basically not doing his job, then quitely promoted him to a different position later on."
politics,ffp0ifi,t1_ffodpfl,1580084029.0,"Well you don't have to ask the same question. If they don't answer, ask why they're scared to answer. That's also likely to provoke a response and you can go from there. If they refuse to answer ask why their scared to answer why they're scared to answer. If they refuse to answer again, then you know you're getting nothing out of them so if it's in private leave and write and article about how they have no plan, they have no idea what they're doing and how they're cowards and if it's in public just start talking about the awful things they've done until they answer simply to shut you up."
politics,ffozzd9,t1_ffohtzk,1580083807.0,"Well yeah that's their whole shtick. Always has been. You can go back to the earliest democracies in recorded history and there were rich people who stymied change at every possible stage because it might dilute some of their power, influence and wealth. They always have and they always will. It's integral to their identity. What I don't get is why it's still considered a valid opinion at all. Like we can disagree of things in politics, but when your ideology hinges on ""Change is scary and I want to keep my power at any cost"" you shouldn't be taken seriously and you should be removed from power immediately."

And you claim others have weird priorities. Could it be that you have weird priorities? 

And rush doesn't have to mean it's as extreme as Coke or meth or whatever, just that you get a sudden hit of pleasant feeling. Is it the reaction that gives you that pleasant feeling or the sense superiority?

Also, you're not making anyone feel like morons, you're making them feel angry and feel that you are a moron. To make someone feel like a moron you would have to actually make them feel like they were somehow intellectually inferior, which just pissing people off doesn't do."

You can say you enjoy it, but do not pretend you have any kind of moral stance or high ground here, that's simply you justifying it to yourself ex post facto, you didn't do this because people have weird priorities, they do, but you did this because you enjoyed it.
