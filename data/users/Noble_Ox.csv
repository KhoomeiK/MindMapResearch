Another major impact tripping has made in my life is I consume as little as possible and recycle whenever I can. I'll buy second Jean's and tops, maybe the odd jacket. 

I went to college aged 36 and got degrees in psychology and sociology (thank God for free education- sorry to bring socialism into the conversation /s) and volunteered as an teen addiction therapist at my cities needle exchange (besides acid, MDMA, I abused every drug I could get my hands on which led to a 25 year battle with heroin.  Luckily we get methadone free in Ireland so my illegal drug use dropped to just one day a
 week for the past 15 or more years.  It's only in the past year I'm managing to get off the methadone (not quite there yet, it's a two year plan. Reduce, go into a medical detox centre for 3 months- the detox pary is only 2 weeks but the rest is relapse prevention.  Then into a clean living house for a year with a daily aftercare program and then finally back into the community on my own, but I'll keep up my 6 NA meetings a week.

You'd be surprised the number of people still using that work or volunteer in harm reduction.  After two years of me volunteering as much as I could they offered me 50 grand (almost) a year to work full time.

I turned it down on the condition that the money be used instead to get more people through the program.  It costs almost 4 grand from start to finish for a teen to do the whole 6 month program we run so t&at 50 got a good few people through that otherwise might never have made it.

I can easily live off the unemployment benefits I get (as long as I volunteer it doesn't matter that I'm not actively looking for work). I get 205 euro a week, plus 40 euro a week towards my rent (which is only 80 a week no bills- something was watching over me that day as the landlady could easily get 200 per week) plus I get 20 euro travel allowance,  I spend 27.50 euro for a weekly card. Ireland actually has the highest rate if benefits in the  EU. 

Now I know I'm basically just surviving,  I couldn't go on a holiday without saving for a bit (another got thing about being in Ireland,  Ryanair.  Flights from Dublin to nearly anywhere in Europe for about 50 euro return,  sometimes even cheaper).

I can't go out for a meal on the spur of the moment or even the cinema would impact me for a week but as I said, tripping changed my priorities. 

I remembered when I was living in Amsterdam but the strongest mushrooms they had (shrooms were still legal then instead of truffles,  which are just as strong). I remember getting 3 quarters of an ounce for myself because well I've always been go hard or go home.

I hadn't much experience with shrooms at this point but a Dutch mate mte use eat these seeds. He said that they'll make the trip last longer and at least double the intensity.  Now I don't know if MAOIs affect shrooms but he did say no coffee, no chocolate and some other things that could kill you after the seeds so that's why I think they were MAOIs.

The trip itself was unlike any other I had before or since. I lay back on the couch, sitting up but my head was right back and my mouth open. I recall breathing so deeply and it felt like breath alone could sustain me.

I started to lose connection with the room, with my body, with time and space itself.  I became aware of a painting noise,  birdsong, animals screeching and an unbelievable musty smell. 

It seemed I was moving forward at a very fast pace and the painting noise was coming from me. I was running through a jungle on an animal track and it seemed I was a jaguar or some other large feline. 

Now this was not like an hallucination where what you see gets wavey and distorted. It was a real as the room I'm in now and the bed under my back. I wasn't thinking human thoughts, I don't think I was thinking at all. We (I honestly believe I was a passenger on this journey) ran of again and I could feel each breath the animal took, like raw energy that enabled him to keep going. I could fell the power of his muscles and the scents all around. 

I snapped out of it as the people I was with were worried because they said it looked like I had stroked out.

Now I've no answer to what that experience was. Was it just a vivid hallucination or did I ride in the body with creature. The shaman told me of course I connected with the cat and it was all real but my rational mind, my western education told me that there must be some other explanation.  I took a huge dose of the world's strongest mushrooms,  what did I expect. 

Well ever since that trip is when I changed how I live my life. I harm as little as possible.  I research companies before buying their product. I try to convince others that consumerism isn't a healthy way of life for a human being. 

I try my best to help others who may not be able to help themselves and if sometimes people take advantage of that that's on them no me, for who am I to judge? Who are any of us to say they shouldn't get the food they need to literally survive while the mega rich person will have to order take out instead. 

All of this from one intense acid trip. Imagine what would get done if would get done if everyone could experience what I went through. The powers that be are second of what would become of society if people started actually really looking out for one another.

I have no idea if what I experienced will come to pass or not but I sure a lot of trippers have felp something similar on their journeys. I can only pray as my days on battle are at an end.

It's up to the youth to carry the tought and the seed forward so enough people can understand we are in a symbiotic relationship with our planet and stripping it for profit is wrong. 

My hope is the mycelium that started all this has found hold in other plant and are doing their piece there too man.

Talk normally to people about this stuff and suddenly its Joe Rogan gone crazy."
funny,fgmcyke,t1_fgllqmx,1580922176.0,Only noticed after I commented.
drugsarebeautiful,fgma1jr,t1_fgm1rz3,1580920704.0,"No worries,  I thought the same 30 years ago when I first started tripping. You learn from experience or vetting sources.  I learned just through handling it enough (I got seriously into tripping, after I dropped my first strip - ten tabs - I kept pushing to see how much I could handle).

Even these days when its easy to find info some people still think you can absorb it through your skin. Even dropping liquid acid on say your arm won't make you trip.

Back in the 60s the Merry Pranksters tried to dose the DNC national convention by mixing acid with a chemical that makes drug absorption through the skin possible but for some reason it doesn't work with lsd (even I.V-ing lsd doesn't make that much of a difference.  I thought I'd go from zero to peak in seconds but honestly I came up a little bit quicker,  it started hitting me in about 15 minutes and I peaked after about an hour and a half. Now I.V dmt is a different beast altogether,  you barely have time to remove the needle).

Tripped every weekend for 12 years straight, developed a huge tolerance, I was taking milligrams at a time (4 mg at once being the most - that's 4000ug - and 10.5 mg over 24 hours just to keep the peak going. Every few hours I'd double up and drop more). I'm sure I'll get called out on this for bullshit, always happens when I mentioned how much I've tripped. I've no one to impress though,  not looking for useless points just sharing my story (I'll be honest though I do enjoy the thought that I've never read or heard of anyone tripping as much as I have - well without seriously firing themselves - last time I worked it out I believe I've dropped between 800 and 1000 times).

Honestly though I think anything after 2mg is a waste, I never noticed any difference in intensity (although I would literally be comatose until after the peak).

That's how I started buying pages at a time (900 tabs) just to save money. And this was back in the 90s when it was easier to get but a bit more expensive (its never been as cheap as it is thesdays if you're buying say a sheet (100 tabs). 

Its also how I got to help in the production side. Because of who my family is I was able to get connected to help out in a lab in Amsterdam (was also the lab that made the first shaped, coloured E pills I saw.

When I first saw them I thought they were sweets as before then E were just basic round presses with whatever imprint. 

Ah fuck to be young again. These days I just micro dose unless there's a good DJ I want to see. Even though I only drop a few times a year I still need a strip to really enjoy it (usually always with MDMA pills if I'm going clubbing). 

I honestly wouldn't bother unless I had at least  5 to drop. It's like I only feel truly alive when I'm tripping.  It's as if  my brain when I'm straight is only at say 80% but when I'm tripping its running at 100% (or even more should I say. Almost a God like feeling, connected to everything in existence).

Other times nowadays I'll just I.V dmt if I need to 'cleanse' myself (I really hate getting into the woo side of psychedelics). Theres a trip report in my history of my first time injecting dmt. It should be easy enough to find as I don't really post much, I just comment more. If you're interested that is.

 Oh and if theres any advice I can give to people starting out is if things start going sideways change you're setting.  Go into a different room, go from indoors to outdoors or vice versa.  Put on a movie (Who Framed Roger Rabbit has had every one I've shown while tripping in absolute hysterics laughing) or put on some music. Ambient dance music (I refuse to call it edm) is the best for tripping - The Orb, Underworld,  Orbital  etc. - 

And always have some benzos on hand. I'd say triple recommend dose, so say 4 to 6 mg of xanax,  30mg of valium.  Hypnotics like zoloft or zopiclone work too. They don't stop the trip but they clear you're headspace where you think clearly like you're straight but will still hallucinate (also activated charcoal if you can find some, not sure of dosage.) I know that if you were brought to a hospital they'll give you a combo of benzos and charcoal (I've  luckily never needed to undergo a situation like that, although I have had to talk to police a few times over the years, especially during mushroom season - I live in an area where liberty caps grow - so during the season there would often be say 10 or 15 of me and my mates walking around tripping balls. I'd always be the one that would have to talk to the police when they'd inevitably pass by in a car and stop us. I'd always just tell them we had picked shrooms and were tripping but had nothing left on us and if they brought us to the station it would cause some of the people to freak out. They'd just tell us to move on and not disturb people (we'd always trip at night, in my opinion it's the best time to trip as the darkness seems to increase the hallucinations).

I got that good with dealing with people that I'd drop (on my own) in every day situations.  At home around parents and siblings,  school,  work, going shopping,  swimming,  whatever.  The only time where I didn't really handle it well was going to mass (I'm in Ireland so it was a Catholic service). I'm not religious at all but wanted to experience it all the same. Just changed my setting by leaving (for whatever reason theres always a tiny part of my brain that can remain detached and take over if things ever went sideways).

Anyhoo I've just typed all that as I'm on public transport going home and I'm just about home so I'll leave it at that.

Happy journeys man."
