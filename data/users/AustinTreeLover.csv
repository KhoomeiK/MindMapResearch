My thinking: In the time it took to make a sign and drag the trash can out to the road, they could’ve taken them to the shelter.

Anyway, their loss. All the puppies were adopted and we got [Fräulein Irma](https://imgur.com/gallery/4pHp5fo)  (aka Squirmy Irmie)! She’s a sweetheart, and believe me, she’s living the dream life now.

Edit: [More Irmie pics! ](https://imgur.com/a/DK8ImC8)

Irma was (briefly) adopted and returned to the shelter before we got her. She was born with a growth on her ""hoo-ha"" the size of a small orange and couldn't walk without painfully dragging it. The vet told the first owners that she was a hermaphrodite and offered to do the corrective surgery for free. Instead, the people brought her back. The growth turned out to be a tumor, she had the surgery and she's totally fine now. Again, their loss, our gain because she is an awesome dog and we love her.

She is a little kleptomaniac and obsessed with beds (like cozy little dog beds). She collects things around the house and stashes them in her many beds like a hoarder. She's a big fan of tummy rubs and sleeping across my neck where she snores all night and drools on me. 

Irmie has a big sister, Stella, who adopted her as her puppy and [they travel together in a stroller](https://imgur.com/a/OcH1J2C) when Irma's little legs wear out on our walks. She's a happy, spoiled rotten puppy now. :)"

True story: Really, it’s not that big a deal; the only reason Americans are so fearful of herpes (duhn! duhn! duhn!) is a US pharmaceutical company in the 80s launched a big campaign demonizing it so people would buy their drugs. 

Truth is, people with herpes aren’t gross or necessarily promiscuous, they’re just people who are unlucky and shouldn’t be treated like subhumans. You probably have it. I probably have it. We all probably have it. 
  
It’s very common for even children to contract it just from normal skin-to-skin contact (auntie kisses you on the cheek). So, while everyone in this thread is attacking OP (I have no idea who she is), just know, there’s people out there who got it through no fault of their own, including kids.
