Been there, I know how much it hurts to leave someone you love, but she won't change and will just be more careful about her secrets. Move on even if it hurts like hell, otherwise you'll find yourself in this same position later down the road with a lot more invested in and it will hurt even more. There is no easy way out and you will never fully trust her anyway. It's dead."

Not to mention the shady 300 million contract given to a 2 person contractor that was linked to someone close to Trump for rebuilding the electrical grid. Sure the local government is corrupt but that doesn't mean the federal government did a good job or wasn't as corrupt.

I don't remember the movie showing much of the world and instead focusing on the cops and their case. I really wanted more world development from it. Then again I wanted it to be more like Shadowrun.
nottheonion,ff34ojw,t1_ff2wako,1579533595.0,"That's how it works. You go in to do the job. Get shit done efficiently and well done. Coworkers get pissed because you're not taking it easy. Bosses now want you to do more. You do what the bosses want, coworkers get even more agitated. The bosses don't ask more of them but if you fail to do the extra things you're fucked. And now you have more work, same pay, and a bunch of pissed off coworkers who just want to work on cruise control with minimal effort. A giant soup of shit. Your health takes a dive, you take time off, bosses aren't happy, you get fired. Can't do shit because you're a temp worker anyway, and the employer can fire you for any reason, so you can't fight it. Oddly specific I know, it's my life."
worldnews,ff1dhg4,t1_ff0a7dp,1579477793.0,"They announced today that the National Guard is taking inventory of all that is available and will be moving out to distribute it in the affected areas. So there is hope. As far as aid needed, there is way more than enough for the current situation so that shouldn't be a priority now. Mayors in the affected areas were telling people to stop donating food and water. Clothes and other things that have been lost are more than welcome though. Even better if it is volunteer work. It helps that this time the affected areas are around 6 towns instead of the whole island. The governor sacked the chief of Piblic Housing and the chief of Family Department because of the whole warehouse thing. Also sacked the guy in charge of the emergency management. She even acknowledged she knew about the warehouse but didn't know about the conditions or inventory of all the warehouses in the island, which are under a joint effort between fema and the local emergency management."
worldnews,fezp4hp,t1_fezmwpc,1579459902.0,"Not an expert. The national guard and military did help distribute the federal aid as best they could. A bunch of mayors hid things, including in their own houses. A lot of the roads were unusable. The logistics aspect does have a big impact in where and when the aid was distributed. Lack of communication meant the people in remote areas or whose only road to their communities was destroyed had no idea about any of this. There was a lot of it though, and as anything dealing with volunteers, some go and some come and inventory gets fucked when dealing with an entire island to cover. It is a little bit of both, corruption and bad management. Either way the government was improvising and had no real plan to tackle the problem. Some say the extra supplies were stored in case of another major disaster. No one knows unless an investigation happens and no one is doing anything to look into it.

Edit: by the way, the aid was not suspended. The only thing that was held back was the funds for reconstruction. These were liberated like two days ago. FEMA made it insanely difficult to get aid. If your roof was fucked and you had flooding and lost everything inside, you still had a roof so no aids for you. Others lost everything, including documents requested by FEMA which is just procedure, but in an emergency where houses got completely destroyed and flooded it is hard to come by the documents. Add the long list of requirements and red tape and a lot of people had to rely on other organizations for help."
worldnews,fezn57y,t1_feypu1s,1579459229.0,"It really is up to FEMA to release the funds allocated for the emergency. They only just released the funds from Maria. Two years later. The local government has a huge responsibility but FEMA and the federal government have been talking about how much help has been sent but at the same time hold all that help back. It's pretty shitty because people read the federal government allocates billions and make it seem our government stole them all, but in reality the funds never left federal hands, and even fema employees ended up being accused of corruption schemes."
worldnews,fezmg9k,t1_feyyyq4,1579458992.0,"No, they died because the entire infrastructure collapsed. No energy, vast destruction, no communications, roads and bridges pretty much destroyed and unusable. A government that improvised and held onto aid instead of distributing it around affected areas. A lot of issues there. But the federal funds were still held back, until like 2 days ago. Funds that could have gone to fixing roads, fixing hospitals, giving them generators so dialysis people could survive, helping out areas where no one could get to. Funds that just sat there for years. Everyone shares part of that blame. I lived this."
worldnews,fezlr4d,t1_fez34sn,1579458740.0,"I am from PR so yeah I can speak spanish. This one does fall into local government territory, my comment was more about the funds themselves, not the physical aid. This post is all over the place between the current problems, Maria, Australia, New Orleans, and corruption everywhere. FEMA is still responsible for holding back funds, and the federal government did hold back most of the approved funds until a couple days ago. It is a shitshow on all fronts."

It used to be girls were a rare thing, now you have tons of women playing all kinds of games. It's no longer the ""nerd"" hobby.

I don't mind battlepasses and don't use them, but I definitely would shell out a few bucks for a couple of skins I do like in certain games."
worldnews,feymy2u,t1_feylrfe,1579447749.0,"Yeah about 40% of the thousands of refugees do have a need. At least those were the numbers given in one of the press conferences. The government was trying to separate those with actual needs and those who feel unsafe but still have their houses fine. Both groups need help but the ones that feel unsafe mostly need therapy. Last I heard there were around 8k people in camps. Unknown number in makeshift camps. Hard to put a definitive number because people come and go, some go to their houses or work during the day and return by night to sleep. Others just want to camp out near their houses for fear of looting. It is dangerous. Yesterday they had doctors and nurses in one of the refugee camps, along with controlled substances, and no security. They were pleading for security by nightfall. It is bad. Most counties are asking to stop sending food and water since they have way more than they can handle or need, and instead ask for other kind of help like donations and volunteers. Logistics is almost nonexistent by the government and there doesn't seem to be a plan on how to deal with the refugees from here on out. FEMA needs to step up and facilitate the funds for relocating them temporarily and rebuild their homes. And the government should keep providing mental health services to ease them back into feeling secure. Hard to do when the ground shakes every hour."
worldnews,feyfbm5,t1_feycko2,1579444746.0,"For what it's worth, I believe he was dirty and I voted for him. Something about his people getting arrested makes me believe he at least would have known if not directly involved as well but keeping his hands clean. But nothing has been found to prove he did anything illegal and he was just being a shit human being in that chat. I'm almost sure Wanda Vazquez is dirty as well, mostly by not prosecuting anyone when she was chief of justice, and most likely ignored anything that would make her investigate. This government is corrupt on all sides."
worldnews,feyed2k,t1_fey1xqb,1579444331.0,"The earthquakes are also very superficial. Making those 4 and 5 earthquake feel a lot stronger. Some of the 5s have been felt in the entire island. Plus even though the island is full of faults and is considered to be in an earthquake region, we haven't really had issues with them for years. Maybe generations. So when this hit, and shit collapsed, and people freaked out, and it doesn't stop, you have a very scared population. Even if their homes are 100% safe at the moment they refuse to sleep in them. They need mental health professionals and therapy to get over their ptsd. It's not as bad as Maria but the southern area is in a huge mental crisis more than anything else."

worldnews,feya5fj,t1_fexy9ao,1579442839.0,Of course we wouldn't. The first few billions were still held up by the federal government until a couple days ago. And the funds available are stuck in FEMA and for some reason they won't help people out. You can claim Trump helped but only a fraction trickled down to the PR government. Don't act like he did much.
worldnews,fey9t1p,t1_fey0bpg,1579442681.0,"But the federal government does rule in PR. Everything has to be done in accordance to federal law. And now the federal government has appointed a fiscal group to manage and decide how much and where the money goes in PR. Plus, it is FEMA who holds the federal relief funds and refuses to help people for myriad reasons. They get very stingy about who to help and why, which is why not much of the money sent to PR has been used. Then there was that scandal where fema officials were arrested for corruption and whatever. The federal government really has some part of the fault here."

sadcringe,fet5iev,t1_fet41k5,1579372009.0,The ring is just a normal diamond ring. Very different from wearing a wedding gown anywhere that isn't your wedding. She doesn't wear it in the left hand either. The fact that diamond ring = marriage is exactly what the woman in the pic went against. She doesn't say she bought herself a wedding ring or anything like that. She says she wanted a diamond ring and bought one.
sadcringe,fet371k,t1_fet1mj1,1579371358.0,"Yeah we are reading it different ways. I read it as she realizing she doesn't NEED anyone else to buy her things when she can do it herself of she really wants it. So she was empowered to go out and buy herself a nice diamond ring. It doesn't symbolize an engagement or marriage. It is a diamond ring which she wanted and bought herself. That's why I see it as more power to her for not conforming to society's view of ""diamond rings are only for engagements and marriage"". A woman can go and buy all the diamond rings she wants. The ""not going to get married"" bit was a bit cringey but the ring buying seems fine"

sadcringe,fet0099,t1_fesz23p,1579370540.0,It really isn't. She is not even wearing it on her left hand. It is literally a ring on a finger. People can get multiple of those.

LifeProTips,fesojlp,t1_fesnfx6,1579367440.0,Just rough childhood in rough places. Bad situations that change the way you look at things. One minute you're grabbing candies at a gas station and the next someone is getting shot and the place is getting robbed. Not knowing what to do is traumatic to say the least. Should you run? Hide? Stay frozen? Where is the exit? Where can I hide? If he comes for me what can I do? Also several situations at clubs and coffee shops. Fires are a good teacher. When that door heats up and opening it up would mean getting blown to hell you have to know what else you can do and where to exit from. Life is a hard teacher. Friends getting assaulted in parking lots. One raped. The other carjacked and mugged.
LifeProTips,fesnixf,t1_feski7t,1579367121.0,"That bit of extra awareness can make a huge difference. Even if you react emotionally and in panic, knowing about another exit or a safe place or in the worst case what you could use as a weapon to defend yourself could still be fresh in your mind and help you avoid a fatal mistake."
LifeProTips,fesn3zo,t1_fesi69o,1579366992.0,"Not paranoia. Just aware of how unpredictable life is. Wrong place, wrong time, can make a huge difference if you know what to do as opposed to react by fear and emotion. And helps to know if someone shady comes in and avoid any misidentification. I've heard cases where someone was stabbed or shot on the back, only to later come to light that they had the wrong man. I'd call it paranoia if it inundated my life and makes it impossible to function properly in daily life. So far it has just been awareness and security."
AskReddit,fesm808,t1_fesjgyy,1579366711.0,"Totally agree with you. I just make the difference between them to follow along the topic of the post. We are all animals, but us humans have classified other animals and placed them into little categories. I love ants and watching the huge military ants and their entire society and structures.  It is fascinating how chimps function and the wars they make and how like us they can be. Fishes are another fascinating area to learn about. But in the end humans love being at the top and everything else is different and less because they aren't like us. Not surprisingly, every other animal would do pretty damn well without humans around. We are the ones that fuck shit up. For as smart as we are, we are fucking dumb. 

If we are going to treat all of them alike, then animals do commit crimes, although not by our laws and standards. We aren't as different as we like to think. I doubt any animal has been prosecuted by law though so it would be correct by that point that all crime is committed by humans."

I'm not looking over my shoulder all the time, nor am I plotting things every moment of the day, but if I sit down to eat or whatever then I automatically check things out just in case.

Edit: by the way, the aid was not suspended. The only thing that was held back was the funds for reconstruction. These were liberated like two days ago. FEMA made it insanely difficult to get aid. If your roof was fucked and you had flooding and lost everything inside, you still had a roof so no aids for you.

It doesn't symbolize an engagement or marriage. It is a diamond ring which she wanted and bought herself. That's why I see it as more power to her for not conforming to society's view of ""diamond rings are only for engagements and marriage"". A woman can go and buy all the diamond rings she wants.

One minute you're grabbing candies at a gas station and the next someone is getting shot and the place is getting robbed. Not knowing what to do is traumatic to say the least. Should you run? Hide? Stay frozen? Where is the exit? Where can I hide? If he comes for me what can I do? Also several situations at clubs and coffee shops. Fires are a good teacher. When that door heats up and opening it up would mean getting blown to hell you have to know what else you can do and where to exit from. Life is a hard teacher.

It is fascinating how chimps function and the wars they make and how like us they can be. Fishes are another fascinating area to learn about. But in the end humans love being at the top and everything else is different and less because they aren't like us. Not surprisingly, every other animal would do pretty damn well without humans around. We are the ones that fuck shit up. For as smart as we are, we are fucking dumb. 

If we are going to treat all of them alike, then animals do commit crimes, although not by our laws and standards. We aren't as different as we like to think. I doubt any animal has been prosecuted by law though so it would be correct by that point that all crime is committed by humans."
