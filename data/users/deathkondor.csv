cats,fdydlra,t1_fdybtwc,1578778634.0,Looks like over grooming. Male cat on his side? Could be nervous or allergies.

StLouis,fdyajss,t1_fdvbvi0,1578777714.0,So far my only concrete plan is making a Spinfusor from Eva foam for my SO. Have to tackle that first.

explainlikeimfive,fdol2ln,t3_emgpgz,1578607310.0,THC-A is decarbonated into THC when exposed to heat in any application. THCs bind to fat/oil because of this loss of carbon.
oddlysatisfying,fdljmmh,t1_fdktpmc,1578525481.0,"Not the foam, but the broken up glow sticks or other light reactive dyes. Not good for skin or airways."
DIY,fdljhrl,t1_fdkw4oe,1578525393.0,Sounds to me like creosote. Basically charcoal power the after math of a fire or other combustible burning. If it is the wall it would check the attic if your are able to access and look down into the wall to check for old damage.

StudentLoans,fdkmoje,t3_elvuh2,1578506742.0,"Contact doctors offices that serve low income populations. Some, if they are in the know, will co-sponsor your schooling if you agree to meet certain criteria (agreeing to work for them after graduation, keeping high grades, etc). I had two friends go through nursing school that way."
DIY,fdkm38m,t3_elw5jx,1578506379.0,Does it stain your skin? What happens when you wet it?
bettafish,fdklydw,t1_fdkcpmd,1578506297.0,"Most of my guys lived about 6 months. They didn't seem in pain they just keep trucking, until one day. Sometimes they swim wierd or sit at the bottom. Just keep up on water changes to prevent a seconary infection."
bettafish,fdk8sgs,t3_eltvtd,1578498669.0,"The last 3 ""fancy"" Bettas, I've had have ended up with spinal tumors. Irresponsible breeding from the looks of it. My cheapo red Betta in my classroom hasn't had any similar problems."
cats,fdhfbyd,t3_elfa4i,1578421449.0,Before / after
BudgetAudiophile,fdhf8gq,t3_elfchk,1578421391.0,"I buy large canvases from the hobby store and then wrap/ fill with old towels. I have them opposite my sound system on the inside wall of my apartment. Can't hear anything in the hallway anymore (with the door closed). Watched a video of someone comparing this method to egg crate foams, and 4 towel layers beat any foam thickness."
cats,fdckpx4,t3_ekn4e9,1578277316.0,"Sounds like a respiratory virus, if you got her from a shelter it can spread from other cats easily. Some antibiotics or steroids should help."

Nails,fcltp9y,t1_fcls2hz,1577756222.0,My pointer finger on my right hand it the same way. I have to remind my nIl tech to use the base of my nail as a guide not the tip or it comes out leaning the the left. I'm pretty sure it's from getting my finger shut in a cabinet when I was 5.
Nails,fclmi6h,t3_ehted9,1577751269.0,I think you nail is crooked. Nail tip is straight based on tip but not nail bed.
LifeProTips,fc75v1o,t1_fc75gmz,1577498359.0,No just the cleaning chemicals themselves. We were using hospital grade unscented
LifeProTips,fc6lpx1,t3_eggx7a,1577483545.0,"Also, don't send your child to school. I can't provide tissues and cough drops for all of them especially now that we can't use Lysol wipes (someone could be allergic)."
cats,fbw90zb,t3_eesepo,1577143748.0,"My cat does that too, to bad my husband never wears clothes."
