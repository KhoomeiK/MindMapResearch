They'll complain about not losing weight/gaining weight despite being a runner. Drives me up the wall.

fatlogic,fevbbk9,t1_fev6e77,1579395330.0,"About two years ago I reached a healthy BMI (about 155 lbs when I got around to checking my bf) but I was still overfat, so I started following thinner leaner stronger lifting program (side note - this is just one of many programs that would do the trick, any balanced strength training program will work I just prefer TLS). I got down to 130 a little over a year ago, I was about 25% body fat back then which is great, but my body is the type to store almost all extra fat in my abdomen so I still wasn't over the moon about my new body. After that I just kept following the lifting program, I did c25k and now run 1-2 times a week and just tracked my food. I ended up gaining about 5 lbs but it looks completely different on me and I'm really happy. Plus I can hip thrust 200 lbs now which is fun haha. My goal is to eat 100-130 grams of protein a day, I hit that usually 6 days of the week (once a week we usually go out, it's hard to hit macros while eating out imo). Honestly I could have probably put on muscle faster but eating that much protein for me was a hell of an adjustment, Idk if I could do more.

As for being a flexetarian, I'm not sure what your restrictions are but I recently realized that a serving of greek yogurt (I use nonfat) plus a scoop of chocolate protein powder mixed together makes an actual delicious mousse like dessert/snack, if that helps. I usually top it with a serving of nuts or granola for a high protein breakfast. Also I usually cook a batch of rice and lentils for the weeks lunch, subbing out lentils for half of it ups the protein and fiber. I normally pair that with chicken or other lean meat though. I know around here there are farmers who raise their chickens ethically so it's not hard or too expensive to get meat that doesn't hurt my soul but I realize that's not the case for the majority of people. I also like to mix one egg to two egg white equivalents for scrambled eggs, not sure what your stance on eggs are but I have seen a lot of vegan egg replacements that might help too. Remember though you definitely do not need to be perfect to see results, it's okay if you can't hit your protein goals some days or if you have to lower it for your lifestyle!"
fatlogic,feusznj,t3_eqnl77,1579389644.0,"I usually eat a junk meal once a week or so, it's really not hard to fit it into a maintenance diet especially if you are active. Hell even when I was actively losing weight I could still fit a Big Mac into my diet if I wanted it enough (there was an ongoing deal for a Big Mac for only a $1 while I was losing weight, and I definitely took advantage haha). It's just about balance. I usually eat a little under maintenance during the week so I can eat a restaurant or delivery meal on the weekends.

Also I always pair it with water or diet soda, I don't see the point of adding additional calories to an already high calorie meal, so yeah if you see me eat half a large pizza or a mcdonalds meal I will pair it with one or the other lol"

If that happens I'll be pretty excited because I want a butt. All I am saying is don't beat yourself up over a size. Its one thing to have an aesthetic goal in mind, but beating yourself up for not being a size 0 isn't healthy.

I know I am more curvy now hip wise than when I was 16, even though I'm right about at the same weight.

aww thats my diet :(

I do agree with what you are saying, I just legit like rice and lentils topped with chicken, eggs, etc lol. At the end of the day though if you don't like what you are eating (and trust me, there are a lot of healthy foods I don't like eating - beans are disgusting and you cannot convince me otherwise) you will be miserable and more likely to fail. Add to the fact that eating tasty food is often a social activity, and the fact that cheap unhealthy food is often the only ""indulgence"" a poor person can afford to partake in on a regular basis, I totally get it."
