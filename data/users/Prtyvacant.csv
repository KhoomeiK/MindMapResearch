Just bringing up the positives that came from their sacrifices, which honestly most of us do, does a disservice to the parts we generally don't focus on. 

All that being said, she's alive. She was interviewed about this aspect of the struggle. It's not even an argument, it's just me paraphrasing her words about this aspect.

It was nearing fall and a little chilly that evening. The Star Fleet costumes were out in force because one of the TNG movies had just being released. 

Apparently, they didn't allow cast members to wear under garments, to avoid lines is assume, under the Star Fleet jump suits. I was probably stopped fifteen times that day and ""scanned"" for Borg Tech.

[This ](http://revisionisthistory.com/episodes/13-miss-buchanans-period-of-adjustment) is a link to the Malcolm Gladwell podcast with her saying just what I express below. She loved her all black school and got thrust into the racist horseshit by adults. No matter the necessity of it, it was a huge sacrifice for everyone involved.*





Integration had to happen and segregation should never have been a thing. However, I think it's easy looking back to think it was all good and no bad. We can't forget that she's a victim here. 

She loved her old school. She didn't get picked on by racist folks. She didn't need an escort into school because of racist folks. She saw herself represented in the school's staff. 

That's not even going into the thousands of black teachers and admins that were out of work because they closed the all black schools rather than sending white kids to them.
