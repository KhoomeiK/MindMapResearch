Gunners,ff7hpx7,t1_ff7dcre,1579649814.0,"With the small amount of time Arteta has had, and the improvement we've seen, I think we'll be scary with a preseason and 2 additions."
Gunners,ff7hmhc,t1_ff7ai66,1579649751.0,Kepa's too. looked absolutely like he was about to burst into tears.
Gunners,ff7hbcv,t1_ff7ajtz,1579649547.0,"r/gunners, forgive me for what I'm saying, but I almost hope we keep Xhaka. He's a pretty handy guy to keep around. Has deputized well at DM, LB, and CB, and has looked much less error prone since Arteta took over. He's definitely useful, and one of the few players we have coming into his prime. 

I was ready for him to be gone a month/5 weeks ago, but he's done quite well since then."

Gunners,ff73yms,t1_ff73nif,1579640645.0,"Can't believe he's still getting as many minutes with Ceballos back. Was really hoping to see him today, but feel the red card makes that unlikely."
Gunners,ff73uor,t1_ff73oj9,1579640583.0,"Agreed. 4-2-3, hope to hit it long and catch Chelsea out with Martinelli's speed and Pepe's skill. Lacazette can drop deeper and help out in midfield."
Gunners,ff73n80,t1_ff73bz7,1579640465.0,"Ozil has to be the one pulled for Holding. I really hope so.

Gunners,ff73kh2,t1_ff73c8j,1579640421.0,"To be fair, their kids came through huge. Mount and Abraham have been really good so far this season, Emerson and James solid to good as well. While maybe not better than all our youth, they do seem to be more polished."
Gunners,ff73ezc,t1_ff73c97,1579640336.0,"Yep, Pepe and Martinelli are our most likely to score I think. Ozil should definitely be the one withdrawn."

Gunners,fey3xhs,t1_fex6b45,1579440506.0,"While he wasn't on the bench against Leeds, he was on the bench for the previous 2 PL games. Which means he's been fit enough to be in the match day 18 for about 3 weeks. Pretty unusual to be fit for that long and not see the pitch yet. 

I'd totally understand if the Sheffield game was the first time he was on the bench, but it's not. You could be right though, it's possible we're so thin in midfield right now that he's pretty much just a warm body, and he's not quite ready."
Gunners,feuki6a,t1_fet1kxm,1579387374.0,What's he have to do to buy a game? I thought he'd come on today for sure. He's been fit for 3 weeks. Almost exactly what we need in midfield right now.
Gunners,feukbqd,t1_fesz707,1579387309.0,"The overreacting to Ceballos is ridiculous. If any Gooners watched him pre-Arsenal, they'd be desperate to buy him."

The pro-ozil supporters in this thread are disgusting. Get behind your club. Ozil is not only not worth half his wages, he's relatively poor.

By pro-ozil, I mean Ozil>Arsenal. I like Ozil fine, but there's no way here's worth 150k pw, let alone 350k."

Gunners,feuiter,t1_fesz0h3,1579386890.0,"I was really hoping to see Ceballos for Ozil at 65'. What's he got to do to get a game under Arteta? 3 times in the 18, 3 times unused sub."
Gunners,feuhc7a,t1_fesllre,1579386575.0,"Eh I'd normally agree, but a lot of the other top 6 contenders are almost as shaky as we are. Of we could link 3 wins in a row, our season would look totally different. Chelsea, United and Spurs are really trying to help us out."
Gunners,feugviw,t3_eqis39,1579386457.0,"Really really wanted to see Ceballos today. What's he gotta do to buy a game? Everyone was solid to good, except for Ozil and Lacazette I feel. Saka and Martinelli were great. Good to see. Future is bright. 

Also, side note. Emile Smith Rowe started in the 10, and played 81 minutes for Huddersfield today. Hope he comes back next season ready to crush it."

Didn't really affect me much though, just found it kinda sad. I had a better job than the couple girls looking down on me for not finishing my degree.

Gunners,fe9asfe,t1_fe8joe4,1578935954.0,"Not really like Mavropanos is reliable at all, even if Sokratis and Luiz went down injured. We'd be better off playing someone out of position.

Gunners,fdy5dcq,t1_fdw17sw,1578776263.0,"I agree with this. The overall on-pitch performance has improved dramatically from Emery days. From the Leeds game to this one was the longest break he's had between matches, and he's managed to get a lot of things sorted. Always going to be things we can improve, but we seem to be trending the right directions in most areas. 

Let's also not forget we have an entire backline of injuries, and not a lot of impact coming off the bench, short of Martinelli. I do wonder why Ceballos wasn't even in the match day 18 though, he's been on the bench in the last 2 matches.

Also, a sidenote, we stopped dominating possession and the game after half when Torreira came off. He's definitely our most important piece in midfield, as the times he's been off the pitch (second half today, and Leeds) were when we struggled the most since Arteta took over. Hopefully it's nothing too serious. We definitely need a Soumare/Partey type player in January that can mitigate the time Torreira isn't on the pitch."
Gunners,fdy4k93,t1_fdy0mir,1578776076.0,"Yeah I thought it was Chelsea but wasn't sure. That's probably the worst game I've seen him do. Not saying he's great, but he also seemed pretty unbiased and no major errors/atrocious games before that... But he cocked up the Chelsea game, for sure."
