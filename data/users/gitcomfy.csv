suggestmeabook,fffluww,t1_ffflm9f,1579886759.0,I take it then that the whole book is like its first 2 pages?
suggestmeabook,fffldmm,t1_ff9s9po,1579886467.0,I'll look them up. Thanks!
suggestmeabook,fffl96h,t1_ff8icho,1579886390.0,I had no idea it was a novel first. Thanks for the recs!
suggestmeabook,fffkzng,t1_ff8e0j1,1579886229.0,I've heard of these books and the titles draw me in. Thanks for the suggestions!
suggestmeabook,fffkwuf,t1_ff88k5e,1579886182.0,I had to look that up and I'm curious because I can't tell if it's supposed to be nonfiction or fiction. Thanks for the recommendation!
suggestmeabook,fffksin,t1_ff917md,1579886108.0,"I'm not big on memoirs but if it's funny and touching, I'm intrigued. Thank you!"
suggestmeabook,fffkmvt,t1_ff88k0b,1579886010.0,I haven't read it but I'll check it out. Thank you!

suggestmeabook,ff86gu4,t3_erxvqh,1579667335.0,"It's a nonfiction book that is actually about treating depression called Feeling Good by David Burns. You can learn what you'd normally learn in a therapy session by reading it and trying the exercises. I've had depression for years and went to multiple therapists, and I really started getting better when I read this book.

Hope you feel better soon!"
suggestmeabook,ff869vk,t1_ff5yabt,1579667175.0,"I second this! It's practical and easy to read, with exercises that help you with self-esteem and low moods. Push through the awkwardness of learning the exercises, and you'll be rewarded with a much better view of yourself. There's even a chapter on self-esteem."
SuicideWatch,fecs04l,t3_eog9ns,1578982389.0,"My heart breaks for what you've gone through. Your words show how much pain you're in. I felt angry on your behalf that your brother has the nerve to lecture you.

I've had friends who were abused sexually by uncles, parents' friends, acquaintances, or cousins. They went through very similar desires to kill themselves after. 

I just want to say that what happened to you was wrong. I'm sad that you were not protected from such messed up things.

I really hope that you can find peace because this situation seems completely unfair. I'm upset that this happened to you and that no one protected you.

As a daughter of East Asian immigrants, I found that there's cultural favoritism of sons. I felt sad growing up because I heard from my mom that my dad was disappointed that I was born a girl.

However, I am glad now that I was born a woman, and even if you say that your parents didn't mean to have you, I'm glad that you were born. You are worth so much more than how people have treated you.

It seems like you're doubting whether your memories are even real. If you are feeling such strong despair with your brother being home, it doesn't seem like you are remembering incorrectly.

Do you mind if I ask what you think might happen if you tell your parents about what your brother did?"

SuicideWatch,fecpsn4,t3_eogeu2,1578980262.0,"It sounds like you're in a painful place.

For me, it's little things like mac and cheese, hot chocolate, my cat, and seeing plants flower.

Do you mind if I ask what's going on in your life that you want to end it?"

legaladvice,fecoh9z,t1_fecmdan,1578979130.0,"Thank you! I'm sorry if it seemed like a dumb question. I've never seen him in person, so would I only report him if I see him? I doubt that I can convince my dad to report it himself."
SuicideWatch,feco1d0,t3_eo40s6,1578978773.0,"I feel you. Sounds like people in your life aren't taking your condition seriously.

I have a mental illness and can relate a bit about people taking cancer more seriously than mental illness.

Do you mind if I ask what you're going through at the moment?"
SuicideWatch,fecnsls,t3_eo0hdj,1578978579.0,"Hey man. I would consider this a traumatic series of events and a painful way for a child to grow up. 

Personally, I think it's wrong for a parent to threaten to disown a child for acting against her wishes. 

I'm really sad that you're going through this. I feel for you because my parents used to be more demanding.

Do you mind if I ask whether you've talked to anyone like a friend or trusted adult about what you're going through?"
SuicideWatch,fecmwav,t1_fechx1b,1578977881.0,"It sounds like you're feeling frustrated because your family had unrealistically high standards for you. From what you said about them going through your stuff and about your mom seeming embarrassed, they seem to place a higher value on your material success than your health and happiness.

In your situation, it sounds like you're doing what you can just to survive, but even that is getting harder with them restricting even how much you eat.

I'm relating to what you're describing because my family used to be kind of like yours. To my parents, it seemed like my interests didn't matter as much as getting a job that makes a lot of money. 

I edited this comment because I realized I asked the same question I asked before.

Just going to say that I've been in a somewhat similar situation, and I'll be keeping an eye on this thread if you want to share more."
SuicideWatch,fecc1ox,t3_eo2x50,1578970460.0,"It sounds like you care a lot about the people close to you, like your son.

If you don't mind answering, how have things gotten worse?"
SuicideWatch,fecbgiz,t1_fe3wa1b,1578970138.0,"I see. In that case, I think that even though people tell me that I have potential and I'm doing fine, I'm not. I worry that I'm fundamentally broken. Right now my main concern is graduating college and getting a job, but I think that even when I do, I will feel depressed still. Even though there are things I enjoy about living, I also find parts of it unbearable."
SuicideWatch,fecb1k3,t1_fe0va1x,1578969905.0,"I see. I'm a little worried that I broke community guidelines by discussing specific methods of suicide, so I'm going to go ahead and delete the parent comment so that no one gets ideas. Anyway, I'm glad that things are looking up for you."
SuicideWatch,fecatzo,t1_fe0ut9j,1578969784.0,"It sounds like you are in a lot of pain, feeling like you aren't fitting in your family and hurt by your sister's actions.

Your situation seems very difficult.

It seems like your family doesn't understand what you really care about. What do you care about that you wish you could do?

Also, I deleted the original comment because I worried that I didn't follow community guidelines by giving advice. I hope I didn't upset you."
SuicideWatch,fec9flp,t1_fec6j49,1578969010.0,"I am SO glad you talked to your dad! You're at one of the hardest phases of life, and young adulthood is similar. However, you have a family, you have a passion (dolls and art), and you are open to changing your mind. That's great!"
SuicideWatch,fe0kjqc,t3_enc7tm,1578815025.0,"Yes. I'm dealing with it right now so I'm on this subreddit. If it's your birthday, I'm sorry you feel like this today."
asianamerican,fe0fyiq,t3_emr44y,1578812779.0,"Thanks for the share. The problem with Asian Americans in mental health is that no two people are the same but clinicians want to have a general understanding of people groups to treat them.

Apparently, Asian American clients view their therapists as more effective when they're also Asian American. It's an incentive for those who are Asian American and interested in psychotherapy to become licensed counselors."
Advice,fdr4ofj,t1_fdpt06q,1578679448.0,Thank you! This helped. I think that I'll figure out an amount that won't hurt my schooling. I'll try not to take her criticism to heart.
Advice,fdprglb,t3_eme1uv,1578637672.0,"Are you part of Narcotics Anonymous or AA? I think that it could be helpful.

I had a problem with a prescription drug that went away when I was hospitalized for psychiatric issues. If you're desperate, you can join a rehabilitation center or clinic that specializes in substance abuse.

If you're in the U.S., [https://findtreatment.samhsa.gov/](https://findtreatment.samhsa.gov/) has a treatment center locator. It says it's for behavioral health but once you put in your location, there will be a checkbox for ""Substance Use."" Check that and different centers should pop up.

If you're not in the U.S., try searching on Google for a substance use center near you. My guess is that your government has resources and links to something like the locator I linked."
Advice,fdpr3hh,t3_ema1d0,1578637295.0,"I am very much like that. Anger usually comes when we feel wronged. I recommend the book Feeling Good by David Burns. There's a chapter on anger that I found very helpful. 

Try writing what you're thinking of when you feel angry. For example, I got mad when my mom yelled at me and my thought was ""I don't deserve to be treated like this!"" Then, try to come up with a rational response. My response to my original thought was ""I may not deserve it, but I can't control what other people do and I will only get more upset if I keep thinking this way. I can instead control what I do and leave the situation."" 

Therapy can also help if you find a good therapist but it can be pricey. 

I highly recommend the book I mentioned because it is scientific but not hard to read."
Advice,fdpqvkv,t3_em6cqq,1578637069.0,"I'm a bit like you. I also have therapy every two weeks. My therapist doesn't hug me, but I get that it's the only time you feel warmth and affection.

I don't think it's a bad thing, as long as you're okay with the hug and it doesn't escalate into something romantic, which seems like a bad idea and is probably illegal.

Otherwise, I'm sorry you're not feeling too great. I hope you find more things to make you feel good. Others have suggested volunteering, which has helped me too. I think you might enjoy a more cheerful environment than a hospital or hospice. I volunteer with children, but there are lots of ways to volunteer. Whatever your interests are, you can find somewhere that aligns with your them. For example, if you like nature, you could volunteer at a local garden or arboretum. 

Besides volunteering, having a day to care for yourself can help too. It can help to do something you really enjoy or to make yourself a nice meal and watch a movie you like.

It sort of didn't sound like you were asking for advice, but I hope I helped in some way."
CallMeKevin,fc80kvs,t3_eeabuf,1577523652.0,"Kevin, I would personally love to see you play Hatoful Boyfriend. You would date pigeons on the surface and get into an epic story if you dig deeper. I love your content and thank you for an awesome 2019 rewind video!"
csuf,fb5n4ik,t1_fawisbc,1576530677.0,"I personally wouldn't mind ads as long as the site stays up. I'm not aware of the legal issues of monetizing public information but it seems fine to me.

I just noticed that it can be confusing to read the charts when I was trying to figure out how many people got A's per class. When I'm trying to decide if taking a class with a hard prof will be worth it, even the difference of 1 extra A can mean a lot.

Thank you so much for having the idea and acting on it. Unlike ratemyprofessors, your site is unbiased and based on data. It's much more reliable."
