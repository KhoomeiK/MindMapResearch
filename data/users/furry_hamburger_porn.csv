Let us turn our backs on this world of ease

Let us turn our backs and walk away

Let us close our eyes to the glory of the machine

Let us close our eyes and walk away



The houses are all gone under the sea

The dancers are all gone under the hill

The houses are all gone under the sea

the dancers are all gone under the hill



""And let us dream now the impossible dream of a math professor""



Even when the last tree falls, there will be fire

Even when the last bird is caught, wooden boxes

Lovingly made by hands and filled up with fire

To blow off the hands of the strong with wooden boxes



""And let us never forget that the human race with technology is like an alcoholic with a barrel of wine""



Rise up! Bring down the Freedom Club! Rise up!

Dream your impossible dream…

When you so embed SoundCloud playlists you have the option to share ""private"" tracks that you can rescind access to later on. 

Set a track to ""private"" and then go to share it. At the end of the share code you will see a random string of characters that serve as the *security token"" that can be made null when you decide to revoke it. That's a good way to share rough mixes. Of course that won't stop someone from forcing a download but it will slow down less tech-savvy users.
