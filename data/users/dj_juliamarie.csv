iamatotalpieceofshit,ffgw35w,t3_eteo24,1579916540.0,"This happened to my friends mother, she was getting out of her car to go into work. She struggled and held onto the purse and the robber shot and killed her. I used to think I’d fight back until this happened. Now I’ll just give the bag. Unfortunately, some fights are worth fighting"

TrueOffMyChest,ffb7p9n,t3_eso3sl,1579754177.0,"Go to a salon to get your hair cut, not a barber, they can help you style it based on your face structure. Then, get on Instagram or other places where you can look at me as styles. Find pics of outfits your like and model your purchase after them. Do you exercise? How about bulking up healthy? Mediterranean “diet” and weights! Now, these are all things you can do to help you feel more confident about the way you look, but looks aren’t anything you can offer others. What you can offer is a safe space, a friendly face, trust, and real friendship to others. You can be dependable, open to others ideas and genuinely empathetic. You can volunteer and give to your community to help foster and positive attitude which in turn, can change your outlook and then your outcome. There’s NOTHING wrong with you putting in some effort to dress better but at the same time, maybe focus a bit on the inside?, I bet you’ll see a quick attitude turnaround once you allow yourself to focus on what matters, you’ll be proud to walk with your head high in no time"
justforsocialmedia,ffb6f08,t1_fbr49zg,1579753032.0,It happened to me when my 19 yo best friend died in a car accident. Another “friend” pretended to be close to her and hijacked the memorial. It will always be the biggest back stab of my life.

NoStupidQuestions,fez68ny,t1_fez5s14,1579454209.0,"“who's sitting beside you on a plain” This made me giggle. I think in that instance, it’s not offensive, if you’re trying to get to know someone. It does get weird for me though Bc I’m a mix if so many heritages. I never know what to say. I’m “Caucasian” by definition"
NoStupidQuestions,fez4w8o,t3_eqywhm,1579453889.0,"I come from a middle eastern background on my mother side. I tan very easily and growing up in Florida, i was pretty tan. One day I was walking through a parking lot in the Florida keys and a car with a group of “older” people pulled slowly up to me, rolled down the window and asked me what ethnicity I was and where I was from.  It was the oddest, most uncomfortable situation to be put in. I awkwardly told them my mother is Greek and kept walking.  

Around the same time in my life my best friend and I were at a drug store and some guy walked up to her and said “what are you???”  She’s Thai and black, I’m assuming he meant to say “what ethnicity are you” She responded “umm, I’m a woman?” And walked away. 

I guess my point is, it’s a weird day thing to ask a stranger. Maybe after you get to know someone, the conversation wouldn’t be uncomfortable but just asking can come across strange."
