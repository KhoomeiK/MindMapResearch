heroes3,ffa9cwp,t3_esiggg,1579730423.0,"Depends on your game to be honest, but necro is very strong in that you can raise a massive army, CHEAP massive army within a very short time. Every battle gives you extra troops so that you don't really need to replenish until you have a large enough stack of thr big guns. This opens up the map a lot better than stronghold or fortress early on and this can roll-over to mid-game. Combine this with the free spell book you're given bonuses literally left right and centre.

The big units of necropolis from tier 4 onwards are very op, vampire lords can just vampire lord to eternity, liches are arguably much better than titans, dread knights are scary, GHOST dragons are very, very op when aging hits despite its low chance (and very fast).

The downside is its economy, but I guess when you're busy raising the dead, money really isn't on top of their priority. Speaking of which, they have two, I repeat, TWO heroes with gold bonus (cries in Tazar and craggy)."

AskReddit,fds9oy0,t1_fds115x,1578697576.0,"Quite frankly, this guy is more like a manager than a leader, worse still he doesn't even want to act like one. Any leader in his position would have stayed with the situation instead of going for a holiday, I mean yes you have a right to holiday with your family, but when you're in a position of power you have an equal measure of responsibility. 

His policies don't reflect the time and the reality of now. Yes our economy is in he bad, we need more jobs, but there are better and more readily solutions than appeasing the fossil fuel giants. 

Mind you, the alternatives to ScoMo is not that appealing either so...our country needs an actual leader, capable of preventing backstabbing, with good political wisdom, cunning and strength. All of these are unfortunately absent from Australia for the last decade and a half."
Cooking,fdpvgvh,t1_fdptznt,1578642157.0,"Americanised Chinese has its place in history and the culinary world for sure, it is still Chinese but because we are so spoilt now by choices and knowledge that it is losing its appeal. However, this type of food will always have a special place in my heart, it is still genuine Chinese food, just readjusted to cater for our non-chinese friends. It is also good to explore new stuff, we need to be braver, because food is the gateway to different cultures, religions and history, to accept the food of another is to show willingness to understand them."
Cooking,fdpntju,t1_fdp0re6,1578634036.0,"American Chinese is actually very Cantonese, because the first gen Chinese is mostly Cantonese. Sweet sour pork, black bean beef, spring rolls etc. One of the things Cantonese are very strong at is being able to adapt cantonese cuisine based on whatever the hell is available at the time. Think about geoduck, these suckers used to be a pest, until someone clever said lets get a Cantonese chef to deal with the problem, so after a bit of trying they found sashimi style fits the bill and now it is in high demand, very expensive."
Cooking,fdomfsw,t1_fdoj5eo,1578608124.0,"Sure thing. Cantonese for example, because that's my background and even this is generalisation. Cantonese food is characterised by focus on the freshness of the ingredients (some regard it as bland) as well as the understanding of the seasons, what to eat and how to eat to maintain our well-being. We are mostly pork and chicken diet with lots and lots of all seafood. We are also very heavy on vegetables, leafy greens to be more exact whereas some other regions are more carrots/potatoes/onions etc.

Even Cantonese is split in four main cuisine types. My place of origin is from Shunde, a place rather famous for chefs, weird ingredients (snakes, worms, turtles) because of our location and lack of large farming lands, and incredible range of cooking techniques (a single ingredient can have more than a hundred different styles of cooking). Rice is our staple, so we have many different forms of cooking rice and even more styles of rice noodles, even one where the noodle is a combination of rice and ground fish meat, the broth from the bones of the same fish.

So you see what I'm saying? Not trying to glorify Chinese food because I'm one, but to try out everything in China takes more than a lifetime, which is unfortunate. Saying that, a lot of Chinese don't like trying food outside of their comfort zones and that is something I quite dislike, yes the local food is delicious, but by shutting out the world they are shutting out new and exciting things. But that's another topic"
Cooking,fdokwo8,t1_fdoiqqm,1578607213.0,"Well, like I said there are some fundamental differences between regions, thus my understanding of the question, the commonalities become so thin to give educated guesses."
Cooking,fdoiet3,t1_fdogz6m,1578605776.0,"The commonality where we use chopsticks to eat, we love using a wok (not all dishes require the wok), we use a massive meat cleaver for cutting etc? OP is right in a way because a person's pallet for Chinese food may be different, some like it spicy (sichuan, hunan), some wants salty (anhui), some likes it light (Cantonese, fujian). You see where I'm coming from? It is not to say it is impossible to discuss, but just keep in mind that these regions are way, way, waaaaaaay different to each other to recommend without knowing the preference of a person."

Cooking,fcozj4r,t1_fcmzm7k,1577845942.0,"As a Chinese I'd have to differ. Equipment and ingredients to most extend are not all that important to be honest, the result would be shabby yes, but we make do with what is available to us at the time, at the place. The difficulty lies in the techniques involved in fine Chinese cooking as well as flavouring. Everyone can wing it by adding in everything, eventually you'll either get edible stuff or dark matter out of it, but when you try to clash strong flavour with another strong flavour, balancing texture and taste, the intricate knifework involved in the dishes. These to me are the hardest concepts and techniques to grasp."
