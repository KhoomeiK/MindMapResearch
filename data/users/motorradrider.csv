Tuned it back a bit and now it can accelerate from 2500 with no juddering. And if gentle enough, it can pull away with no clutch from around 2000 rpm, although you can feel it is not a fan of that."
motorcycles,ffdj957,t3_eskc9j,1579822040.0,"With no highway, it is around 600-700 kms you can do max. Trust me, I did this kind of touring. And for such distance you will be sitting on the bike all day long, only stopping for fuel and for a lunch break. So if you want to see stuff without being in a rush all the time, then I suggest you max out at 500 kms a day."

motorcycles,fdddrfw,t3_ekrsjh,1578307497.0,"I use Drivvo. Good little app, you can choose from a list what maintenence you did or add your own if it is not on the list. You can also track your fill ups, set reminders, add routes and see graphs of your expenses and odometer progress. Numerous vehicles can be added and there are lots of other stuff and features. I don't know if it is available for iPhones."

fatlogic,fd5qr5g,t1_fd5q5fd,1578180426.0,Even then it still sounds to me like they envy people who want to take care of their body.
fatlogic,fd5msxt,t3_ek3xg6,1578179169.0,You can really sense the bitter enviness behind that comment.
motorcycles,fd4htqh,t1_fd4ggwu,1578167597.0,Off-road (only limited front brake) and mid-turn. And when I feel like it is okay to brake for half a minute just to come to a stop.
motorcycles,fd4cs1m,t1_fd48cou,1578166411.0,"I definitely do. 95% of the time I use the front and back brakes together. Harder on the front, lighter on the rear. Obviously, there are scenarios, where only the rear brake is used, but for normal road riding you should use the front brake more."

Motorrad,fceblek,t1_fc9ee19,1577618966.0,Pretty much. This summer I did a 1900km run on it in 22 hours. Never missed a beat.
Motorrad,fc8xc27,t3_egr22c,1577543579.0,"I don't know if there used to be a recall for the issue, but these early 650 GS's had a problem with the forks. Sometimes the part of the fork that holds the axle cracked or even broke off.
And if this model (like the standard 650) has a sprag clutch, then check that. If it is making a lot of noise at start up and it's difficult to start the bike, then it is most likely on its way out.
Apart from that, I don't think they have typical issues."
Motorrad,fc8w22y,t3_egg89e,1577542953.0,"God I love that 650 single. Great machine, takes you everywhere and anywhere even if a bit slower than the others."
fatlogic,fc3tgw1,t3_eg1j2t,1577398203.0,"I seriously do not understand what more these people need to realize that they really need to change their lifestyle and ""relationship with food""... Kudos to this woman for at least being out there and doing something healthy, but she needs to change her perspective on this body positivity BS, otherwise she will soon lose the ability to do any climbing."
fatlogic,fbsgqsd,t3_edr9no,1577054994.0,"Grasping on the mechanic part of the post... ""In comes the fuel and out goes the gasoline"". I guess I am taking my vehicles to the mechanic to check why there is no gasoline being produced and coming out of their exhausts."
