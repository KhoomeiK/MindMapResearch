running,fd3xkam,t3_ejsbp0,1578162492.0,"-If nothing else, focus on your breathing. I shoot for a long-ish breath in and a quick one out.

-Hydrate before you run. I usually do 3×16oz bottles of water before the run. It also doesn't hurt to eat a couple hours or so before you run.

-Take about ten minutes to stretch before you run.

-When starting out, don't try to do long distances all in one go. Do it in intervals, switch between walking and running, but do try to run more than you walk.

-Finally, most importantly, give yourself time to recover. Running every single day won't help build any muscle or endurance.

Hope this helps!"
