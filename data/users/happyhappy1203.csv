EngagementRings,feiveyr,t3_epd10k,1579148267.0,Here is what we did. He proposed without a ring. He was so scared that I might not like the ring he will get so he made me choose. He didn't bring me to the store but he made me send him a few designs I would love. I got both. I got the surprise and I also (partly) got to choose my ring. He made me choose after the proposal.
