Imagine two power plants, both serving devices that demand 10MW. The first load is largely inductive (motors) and the second is largely resistive (lamps).

I understand the first system has to deal with reactive power by installing capacitor banks, perhaps more transmission capacity, etc. and for this reason, all things being equal, this system  will definitely have higher costs.

But the power plants themselves: are they burning equal amounts of fuel?"

Banking,ffdxkf8,t1_ffdx4e5,1579831422.0,"Thanks for the reply. In principle would you say that the total amount I can lend is dependent on both reserves AND deposits that I manage to attract?

Eg. as long as the money stays on deposit with me, I can lend up to the limit dictated by reserves. But if the guy I lent it to takes.it elsewhere, and no other bank will take my call, I am screwed."
ElectricalEngineering,ffcfl75,t1_ffajv41,1579798398.0,"Thanks again, I swear this will be my last question ;)

From the point of view of the utility, why is Reactive Power a bad thing?

I \*think\* the answer is that it forces them to install more devices (mainly capacitors, maybe also more expensive transmission lines) to avoid what would otherwise either damage their system or render their product unreliable.

I \*do not\* think that it forces them to actually burn more fuel in their generator plants. But I'm not 100% sure about this.

I can't think of another reason why the utility would care."
ElectricalEngineering,ff9agz5,t1_ff82ems,1579708534.0,"I think you are saying that capacitors have two fairly distinct functions: 

1) to smooth out sudden changes in any type of load. This would be important even if the whole world were light bulbs. Absent capacitors, everything would dim until generating capacity increased.

2) to compensate for reactive power. This is only important to the extent that the world runs motors. Absent capacitors, the system would possibly be damaged (overloaded?, breakers tripping etc?) as large motors switch on and off."
ElectricalEngineering,ff7hfle,t1_ff7fkt5,1579649625.0,"That's a super-interesting answer, thank you.

Can you describe the impact of taking all of those capacitor banks offline? I assume it would be zero if all we ran were lamps and heaters (though I'm very unclear how the system reacts to, say an airport turning a massive array of runway lights on all at once), but assuming people keep running motors, what would happen?"
vancouver,ff1j18k,t3_er2c85,1579479987.0,I had a similar issue about a year ago. A quick Google will reveal dozens and dozens of companies chomping at the bit to provide this kind of service. We interviewed three and they all seemed very professional (and $$$). We ended up using a trio of filipinos working on their own (not through a company) that had worked for a friend. It worked out quite well but was still quite costly. Good luck.

Contrary to very popular belief, 99.9% of your taxes go to pay for things you actually need, not to line politician's pockets. To me, they seems like a fair price to pay for not living in somewhere like Somalia."
