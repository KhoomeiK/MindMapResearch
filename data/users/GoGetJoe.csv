The fact that they both ended up attacking each other creates a higher likelihood that there would be a mutual combat scenario. Really, it just depends on how the screening prosecutor would choose to exercise their discretion.

Whether his actions were justified would purely be a defense to a charge against him alone. So he may or may not be found guilty irrespective of whether she was in the wrong. I think this chick gets charged no matter what unless the prosecutor takes sympathy because she probably ended up in the hospital."

So yes I do think that the most likely scenario is this would be considered mutual combat and some jurisdictions have a criminal offense to encapsulate that. In my jurisdiction, disorderly conduct covers mutual combat. However, to answer your question about stand your ground, that’s a bit of a different scenario. Those laws are typically designed for you to be able to protect your property like your house. Or, sometimes they are for when you are presented with deadly force. The level of force that is presented by your aggressor is very important. Typically, the amount of force you use in response must be of either equal or lesser force. So bringing a gun to a knife fight would have a higher chance of negating your claim. However, since they are both deadly weapons your claim might succeed. But bringing a gun to a fistfight would almost certainly be excessive force so that, even if your response was justified, the level of the response was not.

Also try to keep in mind that self-defense is just that, a defense. It’s something that you have to bring up after you have been charged with a criminal offense. You have to admit that you did the underlying act but you have to assert that the law excuses your conduct because of the necessity of defending yourself. 


Stand your ground will vary from state to state. In my state, you have an absolute right to protect your property with deadly force. So you can shoot somebody who breaks into your house. But even with in there, it Has to be in self-defense. If you catch somebody in your house and they start running away you can’t just shoot them in the back. That has a substantially higher chance of just being called murder or some level of manslaughter. Because the person typically needs to present some kind of threat to you. In the circumstances of stand your ground, they don’t need to have a deadly weapon. Their presence on your property is enough to allow you  respond with deadly force. But there still needs to be a threat, typically. You know what, let me amend that a little bit. The law in my jurisdiction with regard to stand your ground and any self-defense claim says that if the person actively surrenders or shows them self not wanting to engage you, that is what can negate a self-defense claim. That’s why somebody running out of your house and you shoot after them would not be considered self-defense. Similarly, if you catch somebody in your house and before you shoot they hold up their hands and they say I’m not armed I surrender. Please don’t shoot me. That shows somebody’s active choice to disengage from the threatening conduct and could also potentially negate a self-defense claim.All the little nuances that I’m going through here are going to vary from state to state. And they are also going to vary from case to case because every fact scenario is just a little bit different.

But stand your ground was not designed for you to smack a bitch who won’t deserves it. In this case the degree of force that each of the people used on one another is arguably comparable. This guy was clearly stronger and most likely did substantially more damage to her. But, he used his hands and she did the same. If you pick a fight with a big guy, you should expect big reactions. When I’m analyzing this for the sake of argument, what I have pause about is the fact that she was stepping away and of no immediate threat when he lunged for her. That’s the fine point that will potentially negate a self-defense claim. But, self defense is a defense for battery. Battery is just knowingly or intentionally touching somebody without their consent. The most likely crime is one that involves mutual combat and there is no defense to that because both people have made their choice to engage in the behavior."

WinStupidPrizes,ffedu5g,t1_ffed9lj,1579844353.0,"While logic dictates this, it isn’t how self defense works. When you are on trial for battery and allege self defense, you have to show you were not the initial aggressor. That one is easy. But then you have to show that you needed to defend yourself, as the law won’t require you to get your ass beat.  And then it would require that at any break in the combat, you have a legal duty to retreat if it is safe to do so. 

Dude here was under no threat at all. Walked up to her and threw her three feet. Doesn’t matter if she spit. He wasn’t defending himself. He was the initial aggressor to a whole new fight, as there was nothing left to do after she spit and took steps back with her hands in her pockets. 

She’s clearly guilty of a crime too. But her guilt has no impact on his guilt. Two different crimes. 

However, I think if I played my cards right in front of a jury, they would acquit. But not because the law required it. They would do it because I’m good at my job and that chick asked for it."
WinStupidPrizes,ffec73o,t1_ffec0xn,1579842799.0,"Oh I’m just speaking from a legal standpoint. If I were defending the dude, I would have to dance around the fact that he willingly engaged in combat.

One of the initial tests for being charming, in my opinion, is can you listen? A lot of charm is getting people to like you by encouraging them to talk about themselves. People love to talk about themselves and they will feel more at ease when you engage them in a meaningful way to do that. Next step is to have a quick wit. Having a lot of quick innocent jokes disarms people and puts them more at ease even if they have never met you. It also makes them more likely to want to do things to help you. Those are the two main tools that I use to great success. There’s more to it but you got to start somewhere.

One of the ways that I’m training my eight-year-old daughter to have a quick wit is we get into insult contests with each other. I’ll tell her that her teeth are as crooked as the president and then she’ll shoot back that my hair looks like an elephant sat on it. It’s a lot of fun, keeps us laughing, and we implement certain rules that you have to keep an insult coming superfast and if you either delay too long or if you get caught in the middle of your joke not being able to finish your thought or not being able to figure out how you want it to end, you lose that round."

LawFirm,fek75u2,t3_epge0t,1579194015.0,"Well, first and foremost, staff. Either that, or having systems in place to help account for your busy schedule. For myself, I’ve been solo/small for years and only recently discovered that I actually have ADHD which explains why my time management has been shit. So that’s been a great relief as I can utilize medication to overcome my shortcomings. 

But in reality, first you need a phone system set up so that either someone is answer and doing intake for your, or you’re obviously just answering or following up on messages. If it’s the latter, create time blocks every other day dedicated to just telephone. 

For cases, as you’re busy make sure you’re using a calendaring system. I use Clio to manage my firm. It’s great. Handles billing, calendar, document sharing, notes, etc. 

Ultimately, like any attorney who is succeeding, you’ll need to evaluate what your tolerance threshold is before you expand. For most, if you’re wondering “is it time for me to hire someone?” The answer is “if you’re asking, you should have done it a while back.”  Staff is inexpensive. Initially, you can likely hire someone in the 10-12/h range. Then you need to balance the ROI. Is $400+ a week worth the time you get back?  If you’re billing 200-400, then if you get an extra 1-2h a week back it pays for itself. If you get more time back, you’re even better. 

Keep in mind, you only make money off staff you can bill. Paralegals are awesome for that. A good one is expensive, but even billing at a reduced rate will net you a profit off their work. 

So really, you need to evaluate which part of your business you dislike the most, or needs to most attention, and figure out if you’re ready to make an investment in that particular area. Good luck."

mildlyinteresting,fdgxjf3,t3_el8l2p,1578410775.0,"When I was 19 I was stopped by a state trooper for speeding. He walks up to the car, peaks in the backseat and sees a 3ft wooden stick in the back that I used for propping up my hood. In a really rough NY accent he asks “Whaddya yoos dat foah? Bustin’ skulls?”  I panicked and explained what it was for and offered to show him. He declined, wrote me a ticket, and I went to court a few months later. The cop wasn’t there and it was explained that he went into the city to help deal with the cleanup for 9/11. I ended up being able to get a non-moving violation since he wasn’t there. 

I know, this isn’t a really relevant comment. But I was reminded of this by the post. Also, he was a dick to me. Glad he at least had a heart helping others."
ADHD,fdgvbf9,t3_el6ws7,1578409222.0,"Just pick the top 3 bands in a category. The ones that are most popular from a circulation standpoint, so it’ll be easier to stay at the top of your mind. Plus they are more likely to know the bands and accept your answer, or have a positive response because they share in your opinion and maybe the conversation continues about what song they like, etc. I typically like to have a top3 or top5 list for a lot of things to help handle situations exactly like yours. I have one for my movies and music at any given time. It also helps me remember the style of music or movies I like by searching for those and then using the “suggested” choices that online providers like Netflix and pandora give you to find variety."
technews,fdelxwu,t3_ekw672,1578341818.0,"I actually just started studying COPPA (among other privacy statutes), so I wanted to explain this a little. COPPA requires consent by a parent when a website or channel creator in this instance is a) making content designed for those under 13 and b) collecting that kid’s information. The way it CAN apply to a content creator depends on how their channel is set up. Most are monetizing their channel, perhaps using ad-centric tracking information, by collecting data that can then be used by Google or other providers. It’s this last portion that violates the law, rightfully so. If you’re gonna target a kid to make money off of them through advertising, you better get permission because you’re actually collecting *data* on the children. It’s not like it’s just displaying a commercial like on a generic television channel. YouTube can require user accounts, which can have data associated with them, and that data may be collected by the content creators. Hope this is helpful."

Lived in Puerto Rico it’s whole life until it was shipped to Indiana (by Florida) 4y ago. It has sat since then. I start it and drive around the block a few times once a month to make sure it stays happy. Approx 75k on the dial all original. Was repainted a number of years ago. Interior shows age in carpets and some plastics. Fabric in great shape. Needs new radio and the speakers are not great. Mechanically very sound. Had carb rebuilt last year. Does have rust in the normal spot. Edges of doors and trunk. Some around windows. Tried to depict in photos but they’re not the best.

indianapolis,fcyp5hw,t1_fcyo9wn,1578084258.0,"Because the law in Indiana does not consider animals at the same level as people. If they did, it would cause all sorts of issues for our agricultural industry and the millions of animals that are slaughtered for profit in Indiana every year. It’s a slippery slope no one is willing to fight for. A few years ago they even created a new trespass for animal rights activists to prevent them from sending drones over properties to expose the horrific conditions for livestock."
Justrolledintotheshop,fcxsslj,t3_ejejcs,1578069991.0,I love the concept but then you consider most car bumper heights now-a-days would be right into your shoulder area and you realize that is quite possibly the least safe way to drive. Definitely great for beach-combing though. Looks like tons of fun.
ADHD,fcxrq48,t3_ejdbdb,1578069554.0,"I’m 37 and just started getting this validation because I had never been diagnosed. But in recent years problems have snowballed and my career has started to suffer. My therapist heard some of the things I was saying and told me to get evaluated. I dragged my feet because of course I did. One day I came upon the HowToADHD YouTube channel. BOOM. My eyes were opened. I started watching videos talking about symptoms, problems, and......solutions. Tears came to my eyes because I realized that I wasn’t a lazy ass. I didn’t have a bad work ethic. I’m not forgetful. And these years of being told those things - that I didn’t apply myself, were built on a faulty presumption. I also saw hope because of the solutions. 

So about a month ago I finally got my assessment and started meds about 3w ago. It both pisses me off because I wish I’d known this shit 25 years ago, but also relieves me because I’ve accomplished a lot with ADHD and so I’m looking forward to what the world holds with medication. 

I hear you man. Validation is really nice. Hopefully my story helps you relate, too. And hang onto this girl. She has empathy. And THAT’s a huge trait for a life mate to have. She won’t understand what you’re going through, but she will know you’re going through some shit. And that goes a long way."
JordanPeterson,fcxq70u,t1_fcxlla4,1578068853.0,"I’m not saying he wasn’t vetted. I’m saying the licensing board took things very seriously and looked at his materials in an appropriate manner. I should add that he’s an incredibly well respected lawyer now and someone I consider a friend. Sometimes good people do bad things, or in the case of this post they DON’T do bad things and get a bum wrap. People in both sets of circumstances deserve the chance to better themselves and those around them."
JordanPeterson,fcwhnj1,t1_fcvdet6,1578025871.0,That was entirely a NJ problem. I know someone of similar circumstances in my jurisdiction who got licensed with everyone else in his graduating class (also 2007!) despite a manslaughter conviction and serving 8y in prison.
todayilearned,fcwgs3w,t1_fcw18xa,1578025226.0,"I had a lot of daddy issues growing up and this was just raw, earth shaking, hurt, for me. It just rocked me because I felt so seen. So exposed. 

Now as a loving father who would never do that to my kids, it rocks me from the opposite side. Pity for the kid. And feeling so sad that the kid doesn’t choose To have a deadbeat parent. And what’s kind of despicable parent just bails on their kids?

But, alas, I’m also a criminal attorney. So I see people through some of their worst. And the shining light that the kids never see is that most of the time they’re better off. The parent leaving is actually a gift. If my father had stuck around, I would have been in a WAY worse position in life. I got to meet and spend time with him as an adult.  And I got to understand the *why*. It’s because those parents are fucking dumpster fires that can’t manage their own lives, let alone a child’s. 

It’s crazy to have those emotions come full circle and watch that seen. Because I was Will, and I’m sad for him but know he will be fine despite his shitty father. I know the father, and I pity a person who has simply can’t get his life together. And I know he’s better running solo so he does less damage. And I am uncle Phil, the loving father who takes in the hurt and lost because, if not him, then who? Because will deserves better."
LawFirm,fcwf4pc,t3_ej7ld6,1578024028.0,"Tough spot, for sure. If you were licensed in your state I’d say sign up for these legal insurance companies like ARAG and the like. Not great pay but it’s a start. You also need to network like crazy at bar functions. Find attorneys in the spot you want to be. Ask them out. Ask them how they got there. Who you should talk to. Ask them to throw you scraps. You need junk referrals that people don’t want. It’s how I started. 

But you’re not there. You’re in a state where you aren’t licensed and that may have been a mistake. You either need to take out a bar loan and study as a full time job like you should, or you move back to where you’re a lawyer. Both suck as a proposition for their own reasons. But your earning potential is higher as a lawyer. 

Look into getting on your CJA panels in the federal district if you move back home. If you move, I’m happy to talk more about starting a practice from nothing, as I Did it. And it sucks. But whatever. 

Look, you can go get an electrical apprenticeship, free training, good wages, and start a career. But you already have earned that crushing law school debt. And  being a lawyer has a much higher earning potential. But there are ways to do it. Because there are lots of broke lawyers that aren’t contributing a dollar to their retirement. That’s where I am right now. But I am also strategically planning on getting out of this. It’s all about formulating a plan. Having plan a, b, and c. And because I’m sure you feel helpless and depressed, start small. Get in at a snazzy restaurant so at least you can make decent tips serving and try to stabilize yourself. You need a living wage ASAP and big life changes won’t help that. Once you are stabilized, start to formulate your plan.
