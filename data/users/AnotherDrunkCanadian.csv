Tahiti is warm all the time. 30+ almost every day. 

The pace is much, much slower. What ordinarily takes a couple of days in Canada (requesting quotes for improvements at a store in my case) can literally take months or sometimes not at all. 

People arent focused on work or retirement over here. It's a very hakuna matata attitude. 

Overall, it has some charm that I feel Canada was lacking. The people are friendlier. Less talk about politics. People here definitely seem to just want to have a good time much more often."

incremental_games,ffd41yc,t3_esuvnx,1579813009.0,"I think a lot of people love deep prestige / paradigm shifts like in Antimatter Dimensions.

Phase 1 is all about getting X resource, as you progress and prestige you get better and better and producing this resource that it eventually becomes more or less free. At this point, you would do a paradigm shift.

Now, your focus is all about getting Y resource. And you use all the benefits and speed of X to help get Y. As you get better, Y becomes easier to get to the point of being more or less free. 

However, you dont want it to be using the same mechanic over and over. Like in AD, theres infinity, eternity, replicants, time dimensions, etc.. etc. All of these things contribute towards your next goal. 

God, I love that game!"

Generally speaking, everything is fairly expensive over here: food, clothing, gas, entertainment. 

You can travel from the main island to Moorea by ferry cheaply (about $10 usd for a 45 min ride) but other than that, it's by air or by boat.

There are quite a few boat charter companies for the people who want to see the islands. Again, mostly just for rich tourists.

We are mitigating some risk by offering more than just the vr. We have an interactive topographic sandbox and interactive wall for kids, retro arcade games, drinks, snacks, coffee. 

Weve got some connections to get into schools and offer vr as an extra curricular and weve got some large companies looking for something new and fresh for team building.

pics,feiw6en,t1_feiukse,1579148863.0,"Generally speaking, 5 months is a good number because: 1) I am presuming you are spending more than 50% of your year in your home country (this is necessary as far as canadian immigration goes)
2) having a return ticket shows that you arent staying there permanently, which makes things a lot easier as far as immigration goes. (Even though I had all my affairs in order, the idiots at immigration insisted I enter tahiti with a return ticket... I got things sorted out and cancelled the ticket the next day, but still a pain). 

I would assume that 5 months is just as easy as 1 or 2 as far as immigration goes, but I am by no means an expert. You may have more luck checking immigration laws, or maybe someone at r/tahiti may have more knowledge than I do.
