As a medieval reenactor that actually deals with these materials on a regular basis I'm going to weigh in.

1: There is no artificial leather that comes anywhere close to performing as well as actual leather. And even the ""better"" ecological footprint recycled stuff doesn't make up for it.

2: All of the fibers you listed have *very* different properties. You can't just swap one out for the other. Polyester is stifling and all-around garbage, cotton tends to hold water, and linen doesn't do a good job keeping things warm. Wool breaths, will shed water, when it does get wet it wicks it away to keep you dry, and is warm. The only downside is that its itchy, which can be solved with layers.
