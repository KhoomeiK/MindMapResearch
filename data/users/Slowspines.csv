For those who may not know, Johnathan Davis from Korn produced all the original music for this movie.  
The way they got the main actors voice to sound “vampiric” when he sang was to mix peoples voices together.  
People like Marilyn Manson, Chester Bennington (Linkin Park), Wayne Static (Static X), David Draiman (Disturbed) and Jay Gordon (Orgy).  
I know people dog on NuMetal but it’s a part of my teenage years and I still like it. At least the old stuff anyway.

The cable is plugged into port 1 in my Netgear X6 in the house.  
I was hardly getting a signal from it with the extender.  
So now that the apartment is wired in I still want to have WiFi there. But because it’s an extender and doesn’t have an internet port I’m trying to find out if there’s a way to go into the settings and basically turn one of the ports into one so I don’t have to go out and buy a whole new router.  
It’s the AC1900 WiFi range extender and ex7000 is the model.

Even though i saw what I did, I was driving in my car going 55mph. It happened so fast. And now it was so many years ago I can’t tell if my memory is even remembering exactly what I saw because the brain works weird in its own right.  
  
I had a conversation with my uncle about the universe and he’s convinced that the reason we have a universe in the first place is because of “GOD” and that because it is so complex that has to be absolute proof and that it’s so unexplainable that the only explanation can be that there IS a god.  
And I can’t help but to think the exact opposite.  
It’s crazy tho. The universe is so big that our minds can’t even fathom it. But because it’s so big I think there HAS to be some kind of intelligent life out there.
