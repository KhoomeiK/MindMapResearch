trashy,ffg7i34,t1_ffg5r42,1579900125.0,"Yea actually.  Just look at the sanders movement.  Not sanders and his policies himself, specifically the movement.

2016 his base was full of college aged supporters and probably the single biggest theme was making college tuition free.  There were passionate speakers about how we must invest in the future minds of America. 

4 years later, most of them graduated and now it’s not even an issue.  It doesn’t get mentioned in debates, isn’t a priority for activists, and isn’t being talked about.

So what happened?  Did they suddenly decide that investing in Americas future was no longer worthwhile?  Did they suddenly decide College is fairly priced?  Or did their primary cost shift away from tuition, and towards the healthcare they now need to pay as they get off their parents plan?

To be clear: I support both policies to some extent.  And sanders himself has been consistent in fighting for others.  But as an outsider, it’s painfully clear that a large subset of his base is just looking to offset their greatest personal cost, and blaming anyone they can to get away with it."

You know the “I support environmental movements until it affects my ability to pollute” people.

First of all, the supply demand graph is “kinked”, meaning there are times where higher pay = fewer hours worked.  This makes modeling minimum wage change impacts tough because increasing it may lead to an increase in unemployment in one area and a decrease in another.

Also, your idea that minimum wage = reduction in profits is true, but not because the profit margin shrinks.  In almost all states, average profit margins have remained relatively constant regardless of if the change was rapid (Portland), slow (Hawaii), or nonexistent (Montana).  The reduction in profits comes from a general reduced consumption by the general public, not because of competitive forces.

I can go into far more detail about effects if you want, but just know that something isn’t correct just because it makes sense.  Your entire argument is based on a faulty theory so even though it is logically sound, it is simply wrong."

A) Add benevolent competition that puts lives over profits

B) Remove all competition

Biden’s plan cares for people who don’t have insurance and forces insurance companies to compete with a non-profit entity.  If they can be more effecient, they can take some of those savings and everyone wins.  If the government option fails, we can fall back on private insurance.

Sanders plan is the “sink or swim” plan.  If his administration is less effective than the insurance companies, all 300 million of us are screwed with no option.
