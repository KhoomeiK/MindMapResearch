I figured it was a ruse for attention then one day I started to get hives and couldn't eat any gluten at all without my body getting itchy. This was after a bad interaction to a black mold infestation that gave me candida. 

I'm very careful of what food I eat these days. However to my point, I went to Mexico for about a week and ate local bread freshly made and I didn't have any sensitivity breakouts. man did I ever devour it all. As much as I could. 

I'm not sure what the difference was maybe it was because they freshly grounded the wheat berries. I assume it was pesticides but I think Monsanto is still in Mexico as well. Maybe my body is anti nutrients. It's weird. I'm still searching for the reasoning all I know is bread made in stores is a no-no for me.

So my next test is to grind flour myself maybe ferment it first and see how it goes as a scientific experiment on my body tolerance"

You said you don't need to just let the top laner farm while the JG zones him off. I'm done with you. You're just the typical 'better JG wins' monkey on a keyboard. If they dive you and you die. You deserve it because you stayed under turret giving away 'free 300 gold for your 14g cs. When that happens your JG can get way more value with objectives in game. It's not over if YOU die. Even though you shouldn't be dying that's a champ select problem. But if you do die from a dive that's on YOU. It's also literally not 15seconds.

leagueoflegends,fecoues,t1_feaq2zz,1578979431.0,If the lane is frozen then you didn't manipulate the wave good enough that's on the laner themselves. Yes the JG can help you break it. But that should not be their priorities. This is why you always need to practice lane manipulation and stop spamming your skills to do damage on your enemy top laner. If all you do is last hit and wait there should be no issues most times they will push the wave to you. If you're getting ganked too much you should learn new warding methods. Stop warding the first bush you see it's useless to ward there. If you have issues with champion matchups and I mean you lose 100% and die. You are not playing the right champion top lane. If you're against a range as a melee and get counter picked hard then you should dodge. Dodging doesn't make you a pussy losing 3lp is better then losing 16+.

Let him clear his two wave crash(in which I would be stealing exp) while gaining no benefits (that's a lie I get exp good deal for me tbh) lose out on priority on my bottom JG camps( this is where it doesn't benefit me) my bot lane priority and drag priority all because my top laner 'needs help'.

 I'm sorry to break this for you but top lane is supposed to be boring and deathless on both party sides. You're supposed to be sustainable and last hitting all creeps while not dying. Just because solo queue all these fancy streamers are going all in to death doesn't mean you're supposed too as well."

leagueoflegends,fea3ey1,t1_fea2giv,1578943926.0,Most often the laner doesn't know how to use their advantages and relying on someone to get back into with a gank putting you behind is risky especially since enemy JG can now rotate to your JG and kill you. If you can't secure a kill this season it's not worth it. If you can't make enemy laner back to base then it's not worth it. Going in to give you laner an extra 4-5 Cs is not worth the shared exp. They will lose needed to catch up.

leagueoflegends,fe9t0br,t1_fe97e1y,1578941226.0,Well for mid for example if you fail a gank and are still ahead (health wise) you should both rotate towards the opposite side of the lane to ward. 1) it's common courtesy to escort your jungler 2) he's doing you a favor by warding your lane for you to protect from counter ganks 3) it gives you vision and priority on a scuttle that's about to spawn (considered this is lvl3 gank)
leagueoflegends,fe9p9zq,t3_eo69uc,1578940273.0,This isn't the only problem. When your lane dies once or twice especially top lane you can no longer have a viable and successful gank. By the time you are 4 maaayyybbe even 5 Lamers are at lvl6 now they can easily 1v2 you.
