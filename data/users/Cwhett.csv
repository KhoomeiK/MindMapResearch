I think regarding your q: I’d suggest cutting down before doing a slow bulk. It is much easier to see progress, partitioning is better, your cardio will improve, and you’ll look even bigger. Just my 2 cents."
fatlogic,fegnkms,t1_fegh7st,1579098072.0,"This is true. It is more fun to think about how the logic will twist this cover than the cover itself. It is just a person watering a plant with no mention of health at all - this isn't a subreddit to just mock fat people, but rather the logic which is missing. Hence, it is more fun to think about how the logic will twist it"
fatlogic,fegnfle,t1_fegmrth,1579097970.0,I actually agree with this. I find it more entertaining to think of the way the fringe HAES community will twist this than the actual posting itself.
fatlogic,fegn5tg,t1_fegmzjz,1579097763.0,"Honestly... a bit therapeutic, it fed my inner troll to troll myself? Triggering myself is somehow better than letting other people trigger me. 

I also just love the idea of fat advocates somehow finding a way to make this fat phobic despite being what they otherwise claim to be exactly what they need. Because nothing will ever be enough until we all bow down to the altar of fat rolls and claim inferiority."
