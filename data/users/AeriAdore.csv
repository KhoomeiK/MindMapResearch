AmItheAsshole,fffiei6,t3_et1nak,1579884630.0,NAH but are you positive he's not being bullied and just ashamed or scared to talk about it? Because the fact that he shuts down when his peers are there makes me think that the behavior is directly related to them.
AmItheAsshole,ffekjtj,t3_eszpfp,1579851897.0,"My husband and I are going to my ex husband's wedding. His fiance is such a sweetheart. She helped me with our kids (my ex and I have 2 together) when I was recovering from surgery over a year ago. I gave them free gym memberships that I get for working there. We through birthday parties for the kids together. We don't hang out on purpose without the kids... but if we bumped into eachother in public we would definitely hang out for a bit, it would really be weird not to. Our kids love that we are all friends. My ex is a good man, we just couldn't live together. We had nothing in common, and disagreed on so many things financially. We were miserable and fought over stupid shit constantly. Now we both have partners that are excellent matches. But that doesn't dissolve 30 years of friendship (we were neighbors as toddlers). So yeah YTA grow up and get some perspective."

AmItheAsshole,ffdai77,t3_esupuo,1579816664.0,"Huh. What a B! One conversation and one apology is supposed to make up for years of torment!? My old bully reached out to me too. She said ""I want to apologize but I don't feel like it's enough, and I don't expect forgiveness."" This is how I knew she had changed and that I could forgive her eventually. We're actually pretty close online friends now and talk a lot, since we both ended up getting into yoga and meditation as adults. You do not owe anyone forgiveness and they should never expect it. My friend spent a year earning back my trust and answering all my questions about why she did the things she did and she told me every day that I was wonderful and didn't deserve that hurt. She seriously changed and I love her now. If she did what yours did I would have reacted same as you. You're NTA"
