offmychest,fg0vghe,t3_ew4xc6,1580415810.0,"Glad to hear you have had a good two days! I know what a suprisr and relief it can be. Just remember that just as good days come and go so do bad ones. Have you ever tried making a self care or bored box? For example in a self care box you could have a box of tea, a comic book or some other sort of light reading, essential oils or a candle, lotion. In a bord box you could have: a fidget spinner or the like, slime, a book of jokes, a shelf stable snack, something nice to look at such as a book of pretty landscapes or nicely decorated homes or a pretty rock or stamp collection. Whatever suits you. Once you make it it takes little to no effort to actually make use of when your feeling low.  It is a good comfort and helps shift your focus!"

Please do something for yourself each day. Even something very simple such as have a warm cup of tea, pet an animal, or listen to nature sounds."

Also gives you a chance to talk.  I would keep the conversation light. As for hugging her before leaving I would first ask her if that would be ok. I’m am very excited for both of you! Have a great time! Take your time and relax there is no rush for anything."
