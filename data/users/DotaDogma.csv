AskReddit,fdms11k,t1_fdmrg9e,1578562921.0,"I never stole, but I did stop reacting emotionally. I was arguably emotionally abusive to my highschool girlfriend, and completely unempathetic to all of her issues. As soon as I experienced any negativity at all, I manipulated her into breaking up with me.

After that my friendships slowly broke off one by one as people started to see me for what I was (I was typically the class clown, but was slowly falling apart). I had seriously considered suicide at many points, and also used that against people when they rightfully criticised me.

Going far away for university helped to soft reset me, as I was starting from scratch, and didn't have any of the baggage or expectations from high school. No one knew me as the smart kid or the clown or the asshole. Reconnecting with an old friend online allowed me to open up about how I was really feeling, and how unstable I had become.

Therapy did help, but I even had trouble being honest with my therapist. I lied to her about my struggles with sexuality, and I told her one sided stories because I didn't want her judgement.

I'm sorry if that's hard to hear, in truth I only know how I got here, I don't have a solution. My parents continued to be supportive through university, even if they were disappointed at times. A job in my second year really helped my confidence, as it was a good local creative job, which gave me a fun outlet that wasn't just video games and coding. It's been a slow move and it's still going, but it did work out in the end.

If you have any other specific questions let me know, though I'll probably get to them tomorrow. I do hope everything gets better, I could tell my parents were also very upset about my mental health, and that was hard to see even then."
AskReddit,fdmrdjo,t1_fdmmrkr,1578562007.0,"Hey this sounds just like me when I was in high school. I could get the grades if I tried, but I had no desire to do any work, and would tell my parents I didn't have anything. Failing hardly phased me, and even in first year uni a few fails didn't phase me.

For me it turned out to be depression. My parents had tried punishment, and it didn't take at all. To their credit they put me in therapy in grade 12, but it still took a little while to get through my problems.

Even now in my job and living alone I still struggle with tasks unless I have an immediate reason for them, but I have gotten better. It was never that I couldn't foresee consequences, it's that they didn't matter to me because I could imagine myself having a future to begin with. And every failure made a future to be less likely in my eyes, so it became a toxic feedback loop.

Not that you should worry your kid has any thoughts like that at all, I wouldn't wish that on you. But if you're able, it may help for them to talk to a mental health professional. This didn't just ruin my education, it ruined many relationships for me as well, and it took me hitting rock bottom to figure things out."

circlebroke2,fcmbxs9,t1_fcmbdid,1577769971.0,"Okay, to put it plainly:

Skin tones can be pretty, just like eyes or hair or freckles or lips. There is literally nothing wrong with this. I don't get turned on by these features on their own, I just find certain things pretty. It's not a requirement for any partners, it's not even necessarily a want. It's just things I like, just as I'm sure you have many things you like.

If people actively seek it out - if it fills a certain desire, that is fetishistic and racist, no doubt. I've known guys like this, specifically attracted to women because they're asian, and I've known people that specifically go on about how they want to be dominated by a black man (a whole nother level of racism). There are specific checkboxes in their mind that they want to hit by finding people of a certain race to sleep with - this is racism.

I will admit that it's a thin line, and I'm sure that line is in different places for different people. But someone saying ""I really like the colour of that girl's skin"" is not racist to me, saying ""I find black people so hot"" is racist. Idk, maybe I'm in the wrong but it makes sense to me.

AskReddit,fclgp6q,t1_fcl6mru,1577747375.0,"Also it's bothering me that everyone is saying allergies when they're obviously talking about celiac disease. That's a disease, not an allergy.

GF foods are good for people with celiac, wheat allergies, IBS, Hashimoto's disease, Crohn's, and many others.

Reddit likes to act so fucking pretentious about this when they don't understand it. A guy I worked with got giddy about telling someone they didn't need GF food they're just following a fad because they don't have celiac disease. The dude had Crohn's, which honestly is easy worse than celiac disease (they both suck tho).

Also we don't understand a lot of things about diseases and digestion. If people feel better not eating gluten, just feel happy for them. You don't need to police their diets."

Don't take this comment as saying that's the case now, I'm just saying that if hypothetically the government became fascist, it's unlikely that the gun lobby crowd would organize against them. The majority of those who own guns and have affiliations tends to lean towards nationalism."

I should also note that I have always had dogs and wouldn't eat them, but it's hypocritical of me to judge Asia for doing so if I still eat other animals."

Yes, and factory farmed animals are the overwhelming majority."

We torture in different ways because it's faster and cheaper. I have no doubt that the pain they experience is overall worse in China, but if you're horrified by China you should be horrified by us too."

Dude you can literally look up videos of breeder cows in pens where all they can do is stand or sit. Everything else you said has nothing to do with my argument. Calves are quickly fed them go to the slaughter, yes. And they are separated from their mother so we can harvest the milk. Breeder cows are continually inseminated, also not false."
