When investigating Trump for strongarming a foreign government to *announce* (not begin, just announce) an investigation of a political rival, in a private phone call, with the ""transcript"" buried in a secure server that is not meant for that purpose, it does not matter whether the other party is corrupt or not. A separate investogstion needs to be opened up to look into the other party's corruption.

Not during his time in Bursima, not for any other reason. The raid that Shokin claims tool place has been denied and debunked. Literally the only word we have on anything corruption related comes from him and his own legal team have put that rumour to rest.

politics,ff9uaoy,t1_ff9q5nj,1579721488.0,">In 2019, President Donald Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, claimed that Vice President Biden had actually sought the dismissal of Shokin in order to protect his son and Burisma Holdings,[50][42] however, there is no evidence that this was what happened.[44][51] There has also been no evidence produced of wrongdoing done by Hunter Biden in Ukraine.[52] The Ukrainian anti-corruption investigation agency stated in September 2019 that the current investigation of Burisma was restricted solely to investigating the period of 2010 to 2012, before Hunter Biden joined Burisma in 2014


From your own source. There's a very important part there at the end. It perfectly illustrates your misinformation attempt. Also:


>Shokin in May 2019 claimed that he was fired because he had been actively investigating Burisma,[54] but U.S. and Ukrainian officials have stated that the investigation into Burisma was dormant at the time of Shokin's dismissal.[35][54][55] Ukrainian and United States State Department sources have maintained that Shokin was fired for failing to address corruption, including within his office.


Here's another one from your source:


>Trump falsely told Zelensky that ""[Joe] Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution"" of his son; Joe Biden did not stop any prosecution, did not brag about doing so, and there is no evidence his son was ever under investigation.


One more:


>Ukrainian prosecutor general Yuriy Lutsenko said in May 2019 that Hunter Biden had not violated Ukrainian law. After Lutsenko was replaced by Ruslan Riaboshapka as prosecutor general, Lutsenko and Ryaboshapka said in September and October 2019 respectively that they had seen no evidence of wrongdoing by Hunter Biden.

politics,ff9o3e0,t1_ff9k48j,1579717045.0,You're right about the there being misinformation. You supply an awful lot of it yourself. Hunter Biden didn't join Bursima until almost two years after the Shokin investigation died on the vine.
politics,ff9jfqs,t1_ff8yda4,1579714295.0,"That's not what happened. Shokin was dragging his feet in his investigation of Bursima and others. The UN, US and IMF asked Biden to step in and have him replaced with someone who wouldn't he so soft on corruption. Also, at the time of Shokin's sham of an investigstion, Hunter Biden wasn't on the board. Hunter Biden was never suspected of any corruption, Joe Biden acted within the law and with the public backing of 20 and odd nations."
politics,ff9a7bp,t1_ff90z8h,1579708365.0,"The prosecutor was never looking into Hunter Biden. In fact, Hunter Biden only joined the company after the investigation was over. On tip of that, Joe Biden went after Shokin *because* he was *not* investigating the corruption in Bursima, among others. Additionally, Biden was working on behalf of the UN, the US and the IMF and everything was done out on the open and legally.

The conspiracy theory is that any of this was corrupt, coupled with the fudging of facts like you just did."

Trump has taken every one of his supporters for a fool and run roughshod over them since the beginning of his Presidency. The pathetic thing is your delusional opinion of this charleton. If you want to keep your head up your arse, be my guest. Just stay quiet."
