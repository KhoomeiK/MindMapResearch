TVDetails,fevu5jx,t1_fet11mt,1579401541.0,Haha. Yea. I thought it was from this episode. But it totally isn’t! Great episode though!
relationship_advice,fetr5zh,t3_eqfcej,1579378705.0,Lots of people have a lot of wishes about what to do with them when they are dead. And that’s great and we try to honor that the best we can. But ultimately death and dying is for the living. So you can tell him you’ll do these things but you and your family are going to make the decisions when he dies based on how you want to honor him because it’s not about him it’s about you.

todayilearned,fdm8xso,t1_fdm8i78,1578542749.0,Yeah. It’s super cool. I’ve seen it on Reddit a few times the past 6 months.
todayilearned,fdm6hfc,t1_fdm168y,1578540977.0,"Well I certainly feel foolish! Thanks for pointing that out. I always thought it was not a Disney movie. 

It is a great one though! I’d love to see a movie today combine live action and animation as well as they did it."
todayilearned,fdluzyx,t1_fdl8gs8,1578533129.0,Who Framed Roger Rabbit? isn’t a Disney movie. But it’s super cool all those studios licensed their characters. Mickey and Bugs has to have equal screen time.
unpopularopinion,fcnpajv,t3_ehxx0a,1577815859.0,Definitely agree. You need to have tactile memory where you can just do it without looking. A touchscreen menu is all confusing and I have to look at it to operate it.
NoStupidQuestions,fcmdf0i,t3_ehnzn2,1577771313.0,Dude. My whole damn life. Asthma for the win.
pointlesslygendered,fcm0v7f,t3_ehmd8d,1577761312.0,"I totally get why someone posted this here and don’t know the motivation behind the company who made this toy. However, a foundation called Goldieblox wanted to increase girls in STEM fields and purposefully makes “girly” STEM toys with the idea that girls are socially taught to like pink and dolls etc and this could help get lore girls interested. Also, they realize when Grandma is buying a present for her granddaughter she is now lore likely to pick a science gift she wouldn’t have otherwise.

MovieDetails,fc77e2w,t3_egcq0z,1577499514.0,And it’s simply stunning.
SweatyPalms,fc4kljo,t3_efudmb,1577419413.0,"Why should I worry? 
Why should I care? 
I may not have a dime. 
But I got street and savoire faire."
NoStupidQuestions,fbz4fds,t3_ef58vu,1577234758.0,Listen to the podcast In the Dark season 1. It will blow your mind.
TheSimpsons,fbx2uck,t3_eepfof,1577167133.0,You should make a cinemagraph of this.
Portal,fbwqy8h,t1_fbij64j,1577157090.0,Lol. I was also thinking this!!!
Portal,fbwqvn8,t3_edku04,1577157035.0,Thank you so much for posting this. I couldn’t stop thinking this and thinking of the emperor singing “I’m still alive!”
Switch,fbi4o5i,t1_fbhxf9z,1576890682.0,It’s fun to play goldeneye on your PC with a mouse. Someone made a mouse injector program that makes it run like a modern FPS. Also there are lots of mods you can play. It makes it way easier but it’s still super fun!
