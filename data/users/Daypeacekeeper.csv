facepalm,ff2hw9b,t1_ff2eqsr,1579506850.0,"I hate outdoor cats. Not enough to do anything but shoo them away but as someone that doesn't have a cat, it really sucks to walk in your own yard and step on cat crap. Or the fact that I can smell cat urine on my front step. Or that there are fleas in our boat bc the cats are looking for shelter. Then a cat had kittens in said boat and the kittens crawled into the wall. And we hope we got them all out but the whole boat smells like nasty cat so who knows.

Do you take responsibility for your cat's crap in your neighbor's yard? What if they pee on their door? Do you clean it up? I have no problem with a cat staying in their own yard, but I didnt get a cat. I shouldn't have to walk out the door and smell cat piss on my door. 

Please be mindful of your neighbors. If they are cool with it, then I see no reason why your cat shouldn't run free. Except.. you know. The possible death of the animal you love. And medical bills for the painful almost death experiences... It must freak you out anytime your cat doesn't come home when you expect.

Edit: I don't care about getting downvoted. It's therapeutic to get out my frustrations."

AskReddit,fempq64,t1_fembc5o,1579265932.0,"Liking the book helps. Reading for class? One chapter might take an hour. Reading a novel I enjoy? Finish the book in 24 hours. 

Sometimes I pretend something interesting is going to happen in my textbooks. Build suspense.  Its difficult but I have fooled my brain into being interested for a few subjects."

AnimalsBeingDerps,fecvjta,t1_fe9k4j7,1578986317.0,My dog will drink out of anything but prefers the salt water pool. In winter. And he can't drink it without getting half into the water. Then he whines about being cold.

youseeingthisshit,fe4fjwv,t1_fdxyy19,1578858724.0,I took the piano comments as a joke. I don't think all their upvotes are people taking it seriously.... at least I hope that is the case...

nextfuckinglevel,fdsg9zy,t1_fds2wpg,1578702129.0,"I've stepped on a needle and it didnt go that far in. It took my grandpa two hands to pull it out. I can imagine an apple isn't going to be that different unless its rotten.

Edit: eh... after watching it again you're right. The needle isn't that far in the apple. It went way further into my foot."
nextfuckinglevel,fdrrbma,t1_fdqrom8,1578688527.0,I agree. Why would the thread be strong enough to pick up a needle? Why wouldn't it just slide back out? And what is keeping the apple from going up with the needle?

insaneparents,fc80o0p,t1_fc69d8y,1577523726.0,"I'm concerned with the kids that don't want to try and aren't interested. Kids that are interested are going to do their best regardless. But not every student will be interested in everything.

Not saying this is for all US schools, but my HS was full of students that didnt give a crap about PE. Those that liked a sport took that instead of PE. Football, tennis, track, dance, cheerleading, etc all had their own class that replaced the PE requirement. 

That left our PE classes with alot of unmotivated students. Imagine being a PE teacher trying to motivate 30 kids were most of them say they hate PE. 

But (being the nerds we were) we cared about our GPA. So we tried. Even then we had at least 5 kids that didnt do anything. Not even their grade motivated them to do better. And that was with the good PE teacher.

I'm saying this as a person that always hated sports and PE. I was also forced to take a sport for a year, so I saw the difference between the sport class and PE. And I can be honest and tell you.. I did it for the grade."
insaneparents,fc687hz,t1_fc5nsq4,1577474518.0,"I see what your saying but I would have to disagree. Kids that are capable won't push themselves to be better. They would do the minimum to pass. 

It should be based on effort. Have you improved? Did you try or were you busy talking with your friends? If you aren't good at something, that's fine because you tried. 

And they should have something in place for those that are less capable. If you can't run, walk. If you can't walk, then they should have something else lined up. They can cheer on people that need an extra push or keep track of people's laps. An exam isn't going to give them an appreciation for exercise. And that should be the goal, right?"

Gifts,fbh5owu,t3_ed45h3,1576865895.0,I would say give them a backpack and the rest of the money with instructions to fill the bag with items they will treasure together. And that when they get back you want to see what they found. It sounds lazy but there are really cool things at disney and it adds up fast. But do a detailed card describing it like a game and how you know the perfect gift is something to remind them of their time together
