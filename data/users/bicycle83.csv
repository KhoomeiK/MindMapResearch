Can it be that it just seem random because we don’t know the underlying variables behind it that may exist in e.g another dimension we’re not aware of? Randomness really feels like a religion... Or just a shorthand to say we don’t know what causes it.

As a software engineer I know random in computing doesn’t exists, it’s just a calculation based on microtime. You can’t replicate randomness in computing... If you would know the microtime and the calculation behind it you would be able to predict the number."

Some prophet it is said he saw a stairway to heaven where angels were walking up and down

In the Bible it is said only those who believe in Jesus and that he died for our sins go to heaven and everybody else goes to hell. So Hitler if he became Christian would go to heaven and someone who never heard of Jesus or just happens to be of another faith goes to hell.

Jesus is said to have risen from the dead and appeared out of nowhere on numerous occasions

One story when the Israelites came to Israel they needed to walk a couple of times around a city and then God destroyed that city

God was so angry to Sodom sand Gomorrah he totally annihilated it and turned Lot to stone as a punishment for looking back 

All the prophets are male, so God hates women?

What you’re saying is true, things can always go worse. Maybe in ten years from now you’ll be even more alone and living under a bridge. At least take comfort from that.
