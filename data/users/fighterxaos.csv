GBO2,ffulrmx,t1_ffuj7vo,1580244645.0,"That is true. I’ve gotten in the habit of saying fall back when I call air strikes now. Which, they don’t read half the time. But if they don’t see the big orange cone, they probably won’t read quick chats."
GBO2,ffuhur2,t3_ev90nj,1580242271.0,This is almost too accurate. I’ve both been a victim of most of these things and been guilty of some of these things. Like calling an air strike that just hit my teammates instead of the enemy. :|
mash,fffrev8,t1_ffein3l,1579890162.0,I can’t believe I forgot that one. He gives him a nice copy of Moby Dick and stood up for him. I remember my dad loving that episode.
mash,ffecqrm,t1_ffeca23,1579843309.0,Also the episode where Winchester helps that one fellow who was a pianist that only had one good hand. His passion for music sticks out to me as someone who also likes a lot of different kinds of music.
Christianity,ff85cdy,t3_es56dw,1579666422.0,"I think that’s normal. Romans 3:10 “As it is written. There is none righteous, no, not one” none of us are technically worthy. But He came down in the flesh to die for us as one of us so we can have a relationship with Him. He wants you to talk with Him, don’t let yourself get bogged down over how worthy you are. I know it’s hard, I struggled with not feeling worthy too. But remember He loved you so much He died for you. Why wouldn’t He let you talk to Him after that?"
Protestantism,fewo633,t3_eqsrza,1579416761.0,"Geez how Christ-like of him. /s One thing I hear about Sola Scriptura from those that don’t understand it, even from other Protestants, is that it’s the belief that tradition is thrown out or looked down on in favor of only getting any practices or beliefs directly from the Bible alone. What it does mean is that the Bible is the ultimate authority is from the Bible. The traditions we have should not be in conflict with what the Bible says. There was an excellent comment I remember reading about this where the person stated what we believe is called Sola Scriptura not Nuda Scriptura. Where Nuda Scriptura would mean tradition is thrown away completely. Sola Scriptura means that tradition should be informed by the Bible or at least not be in contradiction to it. 

Here’s the comments I was thinking of. https://www.reddit.com/r/Reformed/comments/e6fvep/why_do_you_believe_in_sola_scripture_or_any_of/f9q6qg8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

I’m not Reformed but it’s been a blessing hanging with them."

depression,fdiii29,t3_elhxst,1578443671.0,"It really does make a difference, when I finally cleaned up my room I felt so much better just from that."
depression,fcrklyn,t3_eieavt,1577903049.0,"Not New Years itself but the holiday season in general. Didn’t help that this new year’s like I mentioned in another thread here one of my family members apparently not knowing or not caring that I’m depressed just sent me a message to cuss at me. Which was like, wow, what a festive season to see that!"
depression,fcp83hj,t1_fcp5ty6,1577853634.0,I hope you meet those nicer people. I hope I do too. I understand where you’re coming from. Today and yesterday I had my own family attack me for being anxious about not being able to pay my bills. I was told to stop “e-begging” and got called quote a “bitch”. I’m on welfare living with my disabled mother btw and have been looking for work since the beginning of the year.
