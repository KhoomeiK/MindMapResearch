Here's a thought.  Why don't you try to live together forever?  Twins do it fairly often.  Thats what your bro relationship sounds like to me btw, a twin relationship.  Maybe you could find another uncomfortably close siblings get married and have a fourway relationship.

Thanks so much for taking the time ti answers my question.  So military wives are picked on by other military wives?  That's so strange, so what exactly do they say to shame you ?  My sister's husband is a Navy giuy.  They got pregnant during my sister's last semester at college.  Money was tight, they ended up going on WIC and other welfare programs.  It was tough for them but them bet they made it work.  It really pisses me off to think she might have been getting picked on too.  

I wasn't trying to to get anything specific out of you with those questions.  They are the product of a bored insomniacs brain :). 

I had just watched a commercial for something called Wounded Warrior, its a charity for returning military personnel.  One of the guy in the commercial had serious brain damage to the point where his speech was incoherent and his motor skills were all completely off kilter.  His wife and toddler were in the commercial too and she was this tall, thin, gorgeous woman in her early twenties.  I get that you signed up for sickness AND health but man, her husband went from being a partner to a dependent.  Its like shes got another kid."

Oh no worries, lol, I'n not mad.  Actually, I'm pretty happy that my little 4 a.m. all-nighter comment garnered such an interesting discourse.  I've read through everybody's thoughts several times and they all seem like reasonable answers for why MtF get more attention than FtM.  

Thinking back on my own life experience, I realized that I have never actually met an FtM person in person and I can't remember ever seeing one on YouTube or in a podcast or anything.  I've lived in NYC for a few years now I see MtF people daily on the street or the subway.  They stick out.  Now I'm thinking I probably pass by a similar amount of FtMs and just never notice them.  

Another person commented that it has to do with the way women are taught to be quiet and men to stand out, which is interesting because they have those gendered qualities but then they're swapping their genders so they're now outspoken women and reserved men.  I find evidence to support this theory in the trans representation in media.  The ones that come to mind are I Am Jazz and the YouTuber Contrapoints.  Both made careers out of commenting on the experiences of MtF life.  The only FtM that I could think of was the character Hillary Swank played in Boys Don't Cry and that doesn't count."
