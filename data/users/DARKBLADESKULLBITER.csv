>overturns everything we know about the game development of the Witcher 3.

It overturns absolutely nothing that you know about the game development of Witcher 3. Anything I disagreed with, is not something you knew at all, it's something you made up and decided was true because you didn't like the criticism of the downgrade. Here's a newsflash for you: neither did CDPR.

>An iota of skeptism isn't harassment

You don't have an iota of skepticism in your bones. You're picking and choosing what to believe and berating anything that doesn't support your view, because you know how baseless it is. Of the two sides of the argument to criticise for not 'providing enough evidence', you picked the one who tried the best to support their statements with all the evidence they could possibly provide+acknowledged that their position was based off a first hand account, but ignored the one where literally no evidence was provided, because why would they need evidence for something that you already want to believe?

There's one and only one reason. Because you've already made your mind up based on very little, and only one of those opinions conflicts with your own.

The single Exocrine provides coverage and draws fire, and just mathhammers out nicely if not dealt with. I didn't want to run a second one without another Dermic Symbiosis, plus it's a fast moving list, and you can only target one Exocrine a turn for the move and shoot stratagem. He does make a good target for Pathogenic Slime but if it wasn't for him I'd be putting that CP into something else, he just wrings more value of it often. The only real cost in CP is the move and shoot strat which you may or may not even need to use. He doesn't really keep up with the Malanthrope but that's okay, if he draws fire from the rest of the army that's acceptable and it's good to have a bit of a Sweeper sitting there and covering a bunch of space both sides of the board with his range, but not quite up in their grills like the rest of the army will be."

I weighed it up and personally moved away from it based on the fact that I think either infantry heavy Nids or Nidzilla would just be more consistent and less reliant on first turn dice roll, and more resilient and capable of standing up to enemy firepower, and the decision has been very rewarding in my play so far. But Biovores are really nice again. I assume you're going for Rupture Cannons, but are you magnetising the Tyrannofex? Acid Spray Fex has been one of those units where their actual strength on the battlefield has been so awesome for something that I understand doesn't jump out as amazing off the datasheet, but in practice they just seem to work so excellent and cover so many bases. I run heavy shooting in my Nidzilla too, but I'm planning to move across to infantry based Nids with a slight GSC splash for a bit of variety when I finish up some hobbying.



On that note, I also disagree that Tyranid results don't count if they are using any sort of GSC allies - like Knights don't count if they have Guard or Ad Mech allies? Nobody has ever made that claim. Why so for us? GSC powers are so easy to tap into and just so useful to support any style of play, that most good Tyranid lists are either going to be splashing them in. Even if Tyranids were the brokest army in the game, why would you NOT take at the very least Crouchling Patriarch/Magus detachment with two of the best powers in the game boosted + two more regular casts, a melee beatstick, also unlock Vect at the same time? There is a few reasons not to, but it's always going to be a consideration no matter how you play, but people seem to just chalk up any Tyranid placing with GSC in it as not a true Tyranid placing which just isn't fair I feel. This isn't a monocodex game, and if Tyranids are pulling their weight in a list, that should count for something.


>I try to be optimistic about it but so many of those other factions are also waiting in the wings for a PA book, where the rules can quickly swing us back into the struggle bus.

I think it will likely just even up the playing field in most cases, and in the worst cases, not create an insurmountable match up problem, there's not going to be a massive power imbalance between mid tiers and upper mid tiers, not like there is between SM and the rest of the game. Compared to other PA's so far, I think it's improved us in many of those matches comparing what we got to what they got. The named SM armies however obviously got a lot, but that wasn't unexpected. 

>I'm genuinely terrified about the Tau book. 

Tau are destined to always be a difficult match up for us it seems, yet that being said we've gotten great tools to deal with them recently. Pure Nids getting the Lictor strat is big here for people like yourself who don't want to run any GSC splash, and things like Maleceptor hiding out of LoS should not be looked over, Broadsides wounding on 6+ are not going to deal with that.

I agree, but tell me how many others have realised? It's still being pushed as THE way to play Nids, almost every Nid list I see posted on here is running it, and it honestly it's been a dated style even prior to that for a *long* time.

My eyes genuinely skipped over that part, my apologies.

Thoroughly agree. People considering Tyranids, I urge you not to listen to the circlejerk that they are some unplayable army, listen to the people with a deeper understanding of the faction. Not only are they midtier, I too would put them above most the other midtiers after BoB.

>Tyranids are quite a unique faction, they opperate best built on the back of synergy. Unlike most factions in 40k usually the strongest combination of units or rules is not quite so obvious, most of the time it takes a couple of games on the table to unsterand to the interaction between the units in a Tyranid force. This typically ends up being one of your greatest strengths. 

So true. It absolutely blew my mind in that big Tyranid thread from a day ago or so, when people were saying 'Tyranid has no synergies' but I guess that's a measure of how well people actually understand the army or how much time they've taken with it. As I said yesterday, there is a *deeply* ingrained problem with the Tyranid playerbase from a competitive standpoint.

One thing to keep in mind is that Erik has played hordes forever, it's his preferred style of play and what he's found his success in innovating. I feel Nidzilla is just as viable if you dig into it properly and thoroughly, but I also respect this guy's statements a lot.

Sigh. This is unbelievably obtuse. Very little about what you say has had made much thought put into it, but this is just the clincher. So unless I can post STATISTICS that support my point, I'm not allowed to even speak? Why even bother having a discussion at all right? May as well change this sub to r/warhammerstats, because there's nothing competitive about your mentality. How come you're allowed to have the opinion that Nid players don't 'suck', can you verify that at all? 

You know how often the stats *get shit wrong*? My entire point is *that there is a human element at play here*, and that here's my *reasoning and logic* for why I think the stats don't accurately reflect what the army is capable of. Your answer to that, ""well, we'll see what the STATS say about that! And I bet they don't agree!"". It's just so stereotypically and deliberately *blind* and it's exactly what I've come to expect from the Tyranid community over the years. We've [discussed in the past](https://www.reddit.com/r/WarhammerCompetitive/comments/e6mkg0/how_are_people_feeling_about_nids_post_capa/f9siizs/) why I think Tyranid players are holding back the army, and I've expanded on it a ton up above in my first post, it's incredibly dishonest to act like I'm saying this must be right 'because Geoff said it', **you're literally the one who brought his opinions up first as support for your own argument**, I mentioned him in reply only to point out how wrong you were on that. I've been playing Nids competitively since before the competitive scene pretty much existed, I've seen this community evolve, or, be as it may, struggle to. This scene is tiny, I'd say the lack of any real competent player choosing to play Nids and set the standard for what they do actually *contributes* to how poorly the average Nid player seems to build their list, rather than being a reflection of how weak the army is, we saw literally the same thing happen for even more popular Xenos races like Necron and Tau, why is it so totally inconceivable that it's happening with Tyranids? You're stuck on numbers and completely and utterly incapable of looking past that to see what might actually be any good. You're exactly the sort player my post is talking about - your entire post history is basically one extended Tyranid whine. If you disagree, then disagree, I'm entitled to my opinion you're entitled to yours, but FYI, stats don't 'verify' anything being bad or good that's not what they are a measure of, and neither of us need them to speak on something. They simply show what did well that day, literally nothing is completely verifiable by your measure."
WarhammerCompetitive,ff4n38n,t1_ff4jpyk,1579567617.0,">Where I think your argument falls down is that there just isn't enough evidence yet


My argument doesn't fall based on this, my entire argument *hinges* off this fact. If there was plenty of examples of Nids doing well, the argument that Nids aren't being played well competitively would have no legs.

Not every opinion needs verifiable information behind it to hold true. This emphasis on 'stats' is exactly the problem in the first place. Especially when the point of discussion is, in the first place, why I think these stats aren't coming in, it doesn't need stats behind it to prove it. 

>The LVO would be the perfect time to see this unfold; we'll see, but I think it's pretty telling that there's only 30 keyword: Nids players in the tourney. Maybe they'll kick ass and I'm rooting for it, but until then, you've gotta admit there's just not that much evidence for your claim

You're just not getting it. If Tyranid players perform awfully that wouldn't impact my point in the slightest, hell if anything it's the outcome I predict too, because I think the army is in awful hands right now with only a very few exceptions."
WarhammerCompetitive,ff4c5j1,t1_ff3yymf,1579560150.0,"Geoff jumped from army to army literally based on what models were coolest, and also saw ways to achieve stuff people thought was impossible like his work with Custodes. It was recently before he passed *that he said the exact same thing* I just did about the Nid community being its own biggest problem. On Chapter Tactics they were doing a broad look at every faction one week, and when they got to Tyranids, the question was asked ""what do Tyranids need to start winning more?"" Geoff's response? *""BETTER PLAYERS""*. He then broke down why he thinks Tyranid's have one of the lowest skill, scrubbiest playerbases in 40k. He is in full agreement with me here, and it was him saying it first that actually gave me the confidence to say the same thing that I've noticed over the years too. 

Sean Nayden is another good example and I'm glad you mentioned him. He didn't drop Tyranids in 8th because they are too weak, he's been playing Aeldari this edition even back when Tyranids were one of the biggest threats in the meta this edition. One of his most famous things was a big callout to the shittiness of the Tyranid community, #LictorShame. In 6th edition, where the Tyranid community was so unshakably convinced the army was unplayably bad (as per usual), and that there was one outdated way to play them, Sean Nayden posted a list with Mawlocs and Lictors, and the Tyranid community shredded it to pieces and told him he needed to change a bunch of stuff because ""it'll never work"". And then that list went on to do extremely well competitively, including winning 1st place at LVO, and then setting a new meta that was immediately copied by almost all the rest of Tyranid players who had thusfar been doing it wrong. You realise the name #LictorShame was partially a meme directed at Tyranid players for exactly that right? Tyranid players had been recommending things like the Swarmlord when he was basically the worst model in the dex. 

I think you're looking far too hard at the wrong stuff and using one or two entirely human influenced decisions to state that Tyranids *must* be bad, and that's just more of this self-perpetuating mentality honestly."

WarhammerCompetitive,ff2rwpw,t1_ff25boy,1579521445.0,">I personally think the Tyranid sacred cows need to be killed off. I’m talking about genestealers and sawrmlord etc. How many times have Tyranids places at an event using the standard builds since BoB dropped? 

Very much so. People are playing outdated strategies and wondering why it doesn't pay off. Swarmlord plus 2x Stealers is like 750 pts, that's almost 40% of your list, and target priority basically writes itself for your opponent. Anti-infantry at the Stealers, anti-tank at the biggest bug (which Swarmy himself provides a great target for if nothing else). No other unit in the army is going to be as immediately threatening, so not much really gets to capitilise on the fire being drawn off them. On top of that, it is just straight up hard countered by the majority of the meta. It's basically Aeldari flyers favorite match up, and Thunderfire Cannon is the most played unit in the game right now and basically neuters them if they roll first turn. But it's not even just the best armies in the game countering them, they fail hard vs Orks, they just can't punch into Knights, and even in matchups where they are good, you need to be able to wrap screens because at the end of the day anybody can shoot them, which [as Erik Lathouras said](https://www.theartofwar40k.com/home/faction-focus-genestealer-cult) last week on the topic of GSC - this just isn't reliable these days, people have learnt how not to let that happen. Matt Root identified this back in 2018, the whole 'eggs in one basket' problem with the Swarmlord bomb, and cut it down to just one single undersized unit of Stealers that wreaks havoc well past their value in games they are good like Stealers do best, but draws off a little fire in games where they are bad without costing anymore than a fraction of his list when they are not- and as a result, spent most of that year as ITC's #1 Nid player. I'm not putting words in his mouth, there's an interview out there with him somewhere where you can hear him say it for yourself if you look for it.

Hive Guard, the second most popular Tyranid unit, are also an extremely unreliable, coinflippy unit, that I actually listed as my #1 *underperformer* in the recent thread about that. Their one defense is hiding out of Line of Sight. Anything that ignores LoS, deepstrikes and shoots, or moves half the table to get an angle, just blows them off the board. Then, on the games this doesn’t happen, they still often have to move to be in range, and also extremely terrain dependant positioning - some tables they just can’t hide. And they chew CP all game. Some matches they are MVP, but honestly including them is just a straight up coin flip for match up, followed by a dice roll for terrain. It’s important to have multiple angles for Nids, but they are pretty sketchy if you aren't running enough bodies to properly block off the board. I think you need a serious investment into bodies for them to work, that most Nid players just are not interested in taking, and then wondering why their theoretically unshootable, top-mathhammer unit is not performing and leaving them with a massive hole for dealing with armour. “Nids are bad, the matchup is autolose!” sound familiar? 

On that note, the people that *are* finding success with Nids over the past few months, are taking a more focused, and cohesive approach - Erik himself is known for his very successful horde Nids and clever play with them, and if you haven't listened to his interview with Nick Nanavati than I recommend doing so [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0NcOFYfgaE), it may change your opinion on horde Nids. However, it's a challenging army to play, extremely expensive and time consuming to build into, and moving 200 models around a board just isn't how many people want to play the game, so this style of play while strong, is understandably slept on. But a lot of people apparently missed that Mono Nidzilla took out 4th place at Fresno Smackdown a couple of weekly reports ago, with only a single loss to the Iron Hands player who got 1st place iirc, and beating out a powerful Imp Fists list and Aeldari amongst other things that I can't recall off top, which I suspect is largely because the sub can't understand the list. That was PRE-Chapter Approved and BoB, with a list running Malanthrope, Hierodule, Maleceptor, and double Exocrine among other stuff, that is a pile of plastic (and resin) claws and teeth that just got a CRAPTON stronger now after the new rules. I'd like to also humbly mention the fact that I myself am undefeated two RTT's in a *row* with Nidzilla, almost completely separate metas too - also pre-CA/BoB, and right now, my list and options for list building feel *significantly* stronger than it did before, and I'm having a ball with the new rules, and can't wait to attend my next event with mono Nids now that the holidays are winding down.

Nids have a couple of defined strengths right now that they can go a couple of ways, that can really stretch your opponent's firepower thin if they build to do so - hordes don't give a shit about Laser Cannons, and big bugs are extremely inefficient targets for bolters / lasgun / punisher spam. We know what hordes do well, especially *if we listened to Erik's interview* (seriously people, listen to it, it's easy listening and he can explain it so much better than I can, if you have any sort of opinion here there is really no excuse not to listen to the guy who's probably the best horde Nid player out here talk about the strengths of the army). But people often misunderstand what Nidzilla does well. A ball of bugs beneath a Malanthrope umbrella is already at -1 to hit, before stacking things like the Horror, and Mass Hypnosis if you took GSC allies, and even a Kraken relic for an aggressive Flyrant or something (another hidden winner of PA3), while relying on some of the best objective grabbers in the game. Unless they have ridiculous amounts of anti-tank, you can really spread their damage thin between a large number of threatening units, often with no real best choice. Do you shoot the Hierodule, the Maleceptor, the Acid Spray Tyrannofexen, the Toxicrene, or the Exocrine first? The stuff you don't shoot is going to be able to capitilise on that turn of grace and often can be really punishing. When you swap half this stuff out for Genestealers and HG it becomes a lot clearer how to beat that list, just defang the sharpest edges and if he whiffs on killing like literally a 1/2 of your army with those very offensive but few units, then chances are you're massively in the lead. 


I modded this sub for the last 6 months or so and we manually approve most lists that get submitted, plus I check in on all Nid threads I see regardless - and I am yet to see a single list submitted since PA3 that didn't run 2x Exocrines and a big stealer pack+Swarmy, before I took a break a couple days ago. There is no real cohesion here in this list, and as going all in on this leaves you with like 200 pts of your army left after HQ's and troop costs, the list just isn't going to have anything left to capitilise off the obvious first priority target Exocrines eating all that AT firepower for the opening turn or two, and isn't going to have the numbers or teeth to push past losing 400 pts of Genestealers to the anti-infantry firepower. You aren't stretching them at all anywhere, it's feeding them ideal and obvious targets, and Nids cannot afford to do that - yet, its literally the only list I personally saw posted since BoB, because why wouldnt we take the two units that math hammer out the hardest, right? I know this is the exact thought process that goes into this list, [I've tested it](https://i.imgur.com/ebBTn8s.png), but you have to APPLY that damage for that maths to matter. No shade either, because I understand the train of thought and how it makes sense at a surface level, but it's up to Nid players to look deeper than the surface right now instead of just blaming their army.


Another common mistake I see people doing with Nidzilla as a less explored archetype is building/playing it wrong, and after a game or two then giving up and saying 'well Nidzilla sucks'. Theres more nuance to this then “taking T8 models and rolling the dice”. If you take multiple Haruspexes, Trygons, hell I even saw a guy running Dimaechaerons - yes, your Nidzilla will probably suck. If you take a Hierodule, and rush it up the field into the first combat you can get it into and leave it there to duke it out - your Nidzilla will suck. I see too many people doing stuff like taking their Dakkafexes and Acid Spray Tyrannofexes (perfectly fine units) and making them Leviathan or Jorm, and then complaining that it wasn't enough to survive multiple turns. Nidzilla needs to put the pressure on for starters, but secondly even from a defensive standpoint they *need* to be Kraken. It's not optional, it's mandatory. Pushing for heavy turn two offense or taking the whole
board is where you need to be. Even Tau wants to hold midfield in 8th, Nids are like the biggest close range bruiser archetype, so close that range. Literally all 3 of that Fresno Nidzilla guy's detachments were Kraken, so are all of mine. Look, I don't care what the math is on +1 sv or 6+ FNP - it's minor stuff in comparison to not having to weather one less turn of hostile firepower because you got there quicker, or the damage you get to take off the field from an extra round of shooting. Dakkafexes were given a 7"" movespeed, 3+ BS, 24 shot *assault* weapons, and optional Adrenal Glands for a reason - **use their bloody speed** instead of playing them like a damn assault cannon Dreadnought.

I know it's something you probably read about online, but as someone with a wife who enjoys games and a few of her friends, and someone who enjoys gaming in a social setting, I've literally never met a woman who preferred this, and was 'alienated' by women being attractive. In fact I've seen the opposite, with women complaining about having to be the ugly chick in a fantasy setting lol (literally last week while playing Betrayal at the House on the Hill). You know how we men often enjoy playing as hyper-masculine avatars, like how the super soldiers twice the height of regular men with ripped muscles are the most popular faction of this game by a runaway mile? Do you really think it's that *absurd* that many women may enjoy playing avatars that are somewhat femine and not older and grizzled to the point that you'd genuinely think it was a man if you didn't have the context of them being 'sisters of battle'? 

I'm not saying doing it either way is particularly alienating honestly, but the idea that good looking female characters alienates female players, is one of those things that contrasts so sharply against every single experience I've ever had in the real world (which is probably more than most people concerning this topic), that I just cannot take anyone seriously when they so passionately argue otherwise.
