AdviceAnimals,ff9waqd,t1_ff88b9o,1579722909.0,"I'm a 28 year old healthy male and the cheapest plan offered to me this year was $462 a month with a $7500 deductible and $10,000 max out of pocket. Didn't take it, as I can't  afford it because I'm putting myself through college. Yet, I'm ineligible for medicaid because I make more than $15,000 a year. Fuck the US Healthcare System. Fingers crossed I don't have any serious medical complications in the next two years and wind up in medical bankruptcy before I even start my new career."
