If they what u what ok if u want more then u guys r not on the same page! Better u ditch his ass and cut him cold turkey and start acting single !! He likes u they for sure but not enough to want to be exclusive .. u taking care of urself and putting You first will male him want u even more! Don’t act needy if it feels ur pushing for a relationship then it won’t happen ! Feeling should be mutual ! Again u deserve better and there is nothing wrong with ur personality ! Dump him to get the upper hand in this !

Am going through the same now! But worse he got another girl back to the room where I was and made it seam like he wanted a 3 sum !!!! Get out before he disrespects not just ur feelings but ur presence .. let us know what happens
