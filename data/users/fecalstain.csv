fatlogic,ff7m2ui,t1_ff6jubf,1579652799.0,"Indeed, this is sanity. The idea that sugar *makes* you fat is among the oldest of diet myths. I can still hear the words ""insulin stores fat"" ringing in my ears.

The idea that sugar causes diabetes goes along with the idea that thin people eat like crap too so there's no causation from being fat and developing metabolic diseases. Thin people get diabetes, I have perfect bloodwork, etc. Now the argument in FA circles has evolved to say there's no correlation with being fat, what you eat, or how much you eat and getting diabetes, heart disease, etc., which is peculiar to see.

Also, the idea that sugar is addictive is just such a feel-good thing to say, especially with all the naive pop science articles about how sugar ""lights up the brain"" more than cocaine or something like that."
fatlogic,ff79beg,t1_ff64aq8,1579643740.0,"It's still a minority of the criteria which already shares strong overlap with behavioral addictions, and even then, the most important criteria for *substance use disorder* specifically (tolerance and withdrawal) are flimsy in humans. The research that they cite for humans, [Allostasis in health and food addiction](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5120365/) used the Yale Food Addiction Scale (a questionnaire) to assess dependence and withdrawal-like symptoms, and they correlated those results to neuroimaging patterns. However, given the similarity of the supposed food addiction and BED, these neuroimaging patterns may simply represent the differing psychological response to food, as differing neuroimagery is found in those with various psychological disorders or behavioral addictions vs. control groups. 

There seems to be a consistent problem, that researchers fail to identify or even test a *substance* as a culprit in such food addiction studies (except when they're testing on rats). The paper (Allostasis yada yada) they cited does not even mention sugar in any form. They found people who either did or did not have a problem with food, and showed that their brains look different. I could have guessed as much. Food, not a particular substance like various sugars. The researchers from the other paper used this as evidence alongside rat studies to show that sugar consumption shows tolerance and withdrawal symptoms per SUD criteria. It's a bad leap.

Note that in behavioral addiction research, such as research on pathological gambling, screening criteria overlap with well-established criteria for SUDs even though there is clearly no substance involved, and [researchers identify differing neuroimaging patterns of pathological gamblers compared to those without a gambling problem.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2933850/) The YFAS does similarly as behavioral addiction criteria, and neuroimaging results in food addiction studies accomplish the same thing, to draw some parallels between the specific disorder being addressed and the established framework of substance use disorders. This is certainly helpful to some degree as there's a significant overlap between SUDs and non-substance addictions, both in diagnostic criteria and co-occurrence. Still, neuroimaging results are no more informative to food addiction *itself* being a substance disorder than gambling being a substance disorder. The latter is an obvious impossibility, but the former seems to be taken on faith because food has things you ingest.

When the YFAS is used to identify problem foods in people who demonstrate higher scores for food addiction, [foods high in sugar content alone fall well behind high-fat savory and high-fat sweet foods, with 5% exhibiting problems for sugary foods whereas 30% and 25% exhibited problems for high-fat savory and high-fat sweet foods, respectively.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28330706) This severely undermines the notion that sugar is itself an addictive substance (like those identified in SUDs). The hyper-palatability, caloric density, and flavor profile of foods seem to predict problematic food behaviors in those with food addiction, not necessarily any particular substance like in SUDs. 

As a bonus, added sugar consumption doesn't even work as a practical model of the obesity crisis. From the study I just cited, ""Overweight correlated only with addictive-like problems for high-fat savoury and high-fat sweet foods (P < 0.0001), while this was not found for foods mainly containing sugar."" In the U.S., [added sugar is nearly down to 70s levels since the peak in 1999, per loss-adjusted food availibity data, whereas grains and fats are up significantly.](https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/FT_16.12.09_food_grains_fat.png) Added fats in particular make up the bulk of excess calories compared to 1970s levels."

As for protein, it's the most satiating macronutrient so people naturally eat less when the food is *dense* with it. I'm surprised I haven't seen propaganda suggesting people should lower their protein intake or that they get too much.

Yet the researchers themselves want to subtly propose that some mysterious factor has altered our metabolism making it harder compared to the 1980's.

Thin means *thin* though, and overall thinness is predicted by a low bmi. That is absolutely more of a cultural ideal for women than men. A bmi <18.5 correlates with 21% bodyfat in women, 8% in men. Both are very thin. One is further from ideal than the other since it takes significant effort to add muscle mass.

The only thing thin about an idealized man is his waist, and even that is thicker in men than women, due to men's thicker obliques and abdominal muscles. Proportionate, athletic men are lean but not particularly low bmi. They certainly don't have *thin* biceps, forearms, quads, calves, and hell, even to your ""bitch tits"" comment, a muscular man is V-shaped, certainly with a larger chest measurement than a typical woman's bust. A thicker neck is also a sign of higher testosterone, as the trapezius seems to have a higher proportion of androgen receptors than lower limb muscles."
