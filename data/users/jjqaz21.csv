First the human brain required allot of energy if we ate like a primate than we would need over 9 hours a day eating to get all the energy we need. however because of cooking we are able to get more energy and calories from food than eating it raw. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_7\_XH1CBzGw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7_XH1CBzGw)

second exercise doesnt help weight lost as much as diet, changing your diet alone can make you lose weight and if you eat the proper amount of healthy food you would get in better shape than just going to the gym more without changing your diet, im not saying dont exercise it really important for your muscle, bones and other part of your body but doesnt do anything when it comes to weight lost.[https://www.npjournal.org/article/S1555-4155(15)00439-0/pdf](https://www.npjournal.org/article/S1555-4155(15)00439-0/pdf) ( i like this article because it has a counter argument so you can read on both sides) since wild animals eat very few calories they dont have a much body fat.

third animals dont spend every sec of every day running away from predators. unlike humans some animals dont eat every single day. using lions as an example they sleep allot up to 18 hours a day and feed every three or four days .[http://www.krugerpark.co.za/Kruger\_National\_Park\_Wildlife-travel/kruger-park-wildlife-lions.html](http://www.krugerpark.co.za/Kruger_National_Park_Wildlife-travel/kruger-park-wildlife-lions.html)

in short; because animals eat such little calories they burn it off from moving around and unlike most people think they dont move around as much as you think only enough to find food and not die. humans are actually the only animal that run for a long time, a cheetah is fast but can only run fast for 20 to 30 secs.
