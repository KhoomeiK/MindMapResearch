imveryedgy,ffdvkbu,t3_et0evn,1579829998.0,Again this subreddit was made for edgy jokes with the sole purpose of being edgy with no substance. This one has an actual punchline that the engineer fixes things by hitting them with a hammer. The subreddit is falling apart get out while you can

I haven’t read Alice in wonderland so I don’t know if the song uses the same words as the book."

imveryedgy,ferhr46,t1_feqvehx,1579354036.0,The point of this sub is too find people who make edgy memes that have no punchline and come off super cringey. But that meaning has been lost because people have been posting just normal edgy memes. Example: WHEN THE SCHOOL SHOOTER KILLS THE TEACHER AND THE AUTISTIC KIDS STARTS HAVING SDX WITH THEIR BODY that’s what this sub was made for
