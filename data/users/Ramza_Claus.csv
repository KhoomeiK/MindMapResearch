I guess where we disagree is if being a bad leader is a removable offense. I mean, being a bad president certainly isn't illegal. But presidents can be removed without breaking the law. 

Do I want Trump removed? Yes.

But when we cling to EVERY LITTLE THING, it makes us look bad to the people who vote for President. 

You and I won't vote for Trump in 2020. And Uncle Cletus in Mississippi won't vote for non-Trump. 

You know who matters? The voter who is on the fence. HE'S much more important than you, me or Uncle Cletus. 

The fence voter is seeing people like us griping about EVERY MOVE Trump makes. He has Hamburgers and we bitch about it. He goes to a Presbyterian Church and we bitch. He spells ""Melania"" wrong and it's a story on NBC Nightly News. 

So when Trump does something BIG (like selling our country to Putin), instead of taking it seriously, it's just seen as another overly critical bitching session, like the hamburger complaint.

How about we reserve our outrage for significant things? Not ""Trump heard his ambassador was a jerk so he fired her"".

Yes, it's a bad look. Yes, it contributes to all the reasons I want him gone.

But maybe we need to save our rage for serious stuff or we run the risk of alienating fence-voters. Trump can easily say ""oh the Ukraine story? It's just the same as every thing else. They nitpick and gripe about everything I do."""
politics,ffn3ei2,t1_ffn1gt8,1580061609.0,"Okay, but ultimately, all diplomats serve at the pleasure of the president. Yovanavitch herself has said as much. If the president loses confidence in an official, they should be removed. I agree that taking Parnas' word for it is a lousy reason to remove an ambassador, but still, it's the president's responsibility to appoint officials he thinks are best for the job. He thought Yovanavitch was not right, for whatever reason. So he told his team to get rid of her.

Why'd it take a year? Because it takes a while to make a proper transition.

Look, I'm anti-Trump. I have literally marched in the streets to call for his removal. Even made it on my local news to talk about why, which was risky for me cuz I am in the US Army.

But this feels like more evidence that Trump isn't a good president. Yeah, he's a terrible president. So was GW Bush. So was Hoover. That doesn't mean they should be removed.

Trump should be removed. I agree with that. But this tape isn't evidence that he should be removed."

He was suggesting that because he's famous they *let* him grab them by the pussy. Meaning they consent to it because he's famous. Like, if YOU did it, it's assault. If a wealthy TV Star does it, they are cool with it, or at least, they accept it.

For me, it's gotta be the debate about prison laborers.

My side always calls them ""slaves"" and considered it to be forced labor.

I guess it varies from state to state, but in my state (AZ), most of the contract jobs (call centers, farms, etc) are coveted on the prison yard. Inmates generally love those contract jobs cuz they pay at least min wage (the prison keeps a portion for rent/food/etc), and the inmate gets out with all their fines paid and usually a few thousand saved up. The alternative for the inmate is to get out with with nothing, owing $20k in fines that they'll never pay which means they'll just get arrested again.

Inmate call center jobs (like the one Bloomberg had contracted) are a GOOD thing. For everyone. Inmates, the state, the contractor, the customer... There are so many winning parties in these arrangements.

But my side seems to think these inmates are being forced to work there, or getting paid $0.05/hr to work.

That's not true at all. They can quit whenever they want. And some of them do. But most like the work. Many (in my state) even come back after they get released and work for the same company as civilians.

So yeah. Liberals: do some research before you condemn these programs. They're beneficial. Everybody wins.

Inmate gets a good job, good money, pays off fines, gets to restart their life with some money.
