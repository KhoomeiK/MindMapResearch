fatlogic,ffdps58,t1_ffdoswq,1579826053.0,"I found all of those foods on FoodData Central. I used dal instead of dahl - you may need to try a few alternate spellings of transliterated terms. I did find seaweed entries but you could also try searching nori or laver, for example. 

Which tracker are you using? Most allow food to be manually entered in if there isn’t already an entry available.

(I’m not sure why you wanted to point out your race?)"
fatlogic,ffdm5ws,t1_ffd5xsx,1579823826.0,"What ingredients are you looking to include? I use MyFitnessPal and will often type in “food USDA” and sometimes the ingredient is already there. Or if not, I go to FoodData Central at https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/ to search for the food there, and then make my own entry in MFP. 

I tried random foods that seemed a little less common than like, carrots, and all of the following were on FoodData Central:

- Eel
- Lotus root
- Açaí (didn’t work with accents but did as acai) 
- Bamboo shoots
- Cactus leaf 
- Sea cucumber 

I then checked MFP and each of these had entries there too (though I didn’t check for accuracy).

Sorry to hear you are having diet burnout, but I hope this helped at least a little."

fatlogic,ff9ir12,t1_ff98uwy,1579713884.0,"People with restrictive eating disorders sometimes avoid fruit because of the sugar.

I’ve also heard dietlogic/fatlogic that “fruit isn’t healthy because the sugar in it makes diabetics sick” - which can be true depending on how poorly the diabetes is managed, but not really a concern for those who aren’t diabetic or pre-diabetic. 

As the majority of people in the Anglosphere are overweight or obese, it would be much better if they added a simple “sugar isn’t bad for you in moderation, particularly when found in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.” 

Unfortunately, a lot of fatlogic relies on a lack of nutritional knowledge and critical thinking in the audience. These types of accounts use the veneer of medical/nutritional truth to make their overarching argument that “any moderation is restriction!” seem more palatable (pun intended)."

ADHD,ff30o32,t1_ff2xtaf,1579530518.0,"Ah, okay. I’d encourage her to get diagnosed if she’s interested, if for no other reason than that you don’t have to hear about it as much! 

With your brother I’d employ a strong boundary method. Try not to reward his irritating behaviors with a reaction. Tough to employ but I find not providing a reaction is the best way to deter his behavior. It will be harder to enforce at work, unfortunately. 

I forgot to mention the weird unrelated stuff from your boss, but it sounds like he’s trying to be supportive. It’s coming from a good place. I usually thank them for the advice (you don’t have to act on it, but they feel like they contributed). 

Good luck, I do relate to many of the issues you brought up."
ADHD,ff2xo03,t3_ercfq0,1579527912.0,"> My mum is constantly trying to associate her struggles at school and work to ADHD that she was never diagnosed for (cool, don’t care) and saying how she knows how I feel, yet doesn’t treat me like she knows how I feel. She always over reacts to things and then tries to get too involved and trying to get me to do things I couldn’t care less about.

ADHD often runs in families, it’s entirely possible she has undiagnosed ADHD. Saying “cool, don’t care” is pretty harsh. Why don’t you try encouraging her to get tested instead? If she does have it then she can get help for her struggles, or if she doesn’t I’m guessing she’d stop saying she has it.

As for your brother - I know it’s hard but you do have a choice to walk away from him when he’s being annoying."
fatlogic,fdxnow4,t1_fdx7w99,1578770974.0,"Not eating every four hours “slows down your metabolism and makes you store calories instead of burning them” is not true. Different eating schedules may make adhering to a net calorie loss easier or harder for any one individual but if you eat less than you burn, over time you will lose weight."
fatlogic,fdxc77r,t1_fdweghz,1578767330.0,"There are a lot of factors that influence when puberty starts: body fat, nutrition, and genetics/family history all play a part. Many girls who participate in lots of sports or have otherwise very low body fat will tend to have a later first period on average, too. My guess is there are some socioeconomic factors influencing cohorts because my grade had a similar trajectory as yours, but also some confirmation bias at work too (I doubt they remember the late bloomers, or they had really small grades). 

As for final height, I read that it’s normal to continue growing for about 1-2 years post menarche in girls, though anecdotally I know several women (including me) who continued growing for 3-4 years after menarche and no doctor said it was anything to worry about. But I also know some girls who never grew at all once their period started, too. 

Also, puberty starts in children before menarche in girls, and boys do tend to go through the later stages of puberty after girls have, though again with normal development there can be a relatively wide range of what’s considered normal for each stage of puberty (and menopause for women later in life). So the majority of the boys lagging behind the majority of girls is normal and expected. 

If you’d like further information about any of this, the American Academy of Pediatrics (and their parent resource site healthychildren.org) is a good place to read more."
fatlogic,fduqsyh,t1_fdukuom,1578737541.0,"Like with most developmental milestones, most people will achieve them in the middle of the age range; it sounds like that’s what happened with your school. 

The reason I brought up the normal age range for menarche is because stating that all sixteen year old girls should be done with puberty is equally as incorrect as saying that no woman should be able to fit into their high school clothes as an adult.

While this sub is here to dispel fatlogic, I don’t want to see other myths propagating here, particularly ones that directly impact teenagers (since there’s no 18+ rule for this subreddit)."
fatlogic,fdukkpl,t1_fdu1g9x,1578734374.0,"The normal range for puberty in girls is ages 9 through 16, so for those who get their first period at 15-16 they could keep growing in height until about 18. 

Puberty also continues for approximately one to two years after menarche in girls. It’s also why it is considered normal to have some period irregularity in the first few years after menarche."

fatlogic,fcvaqzf,t3_ej2xmk,1577998184.0,"I’m annoyed by the writing in the archived piece; the melodramatic “undo all science” at the end is unnecessary editorializing in what could be a factual piece. Isn’t that some outlet that acts like universities are some hive mind and there’s no room for any disagreement?

Anyway, so one school may have a small department where people talk about their experiences. Their work will either withstand rigorous critique by other members of the related fields of sociology, psychology, medicine, etc., or it won’t. They will also have to obtain funding somehow. 

Furthermore, there’s nothing stopping anyone from setting up a fat studies journal or department that encompasses the experiences of currently-fat and formerly-fat people that is based in countering myths about the “impossibility” of losing weight."

ADHD,fcsxhbc,t3_eiqkt4,1577927582.0,"You might want to consider being re-evaluated by a different psychiatrist.

I was told at the time of being diagnosed that high intelligence can make it seem like people are coping fine but that we still have ADHD. 

Some people do seem to “grow out” of ADHD but it’s more likely that they still have it, it’s just more mild and they have developed good coping mechanisms. 

Out of curiosity what test(s) were you administered?"
