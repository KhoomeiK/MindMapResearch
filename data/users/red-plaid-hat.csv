When I worked for a support desk at a bank I really liked those as I wasn't allowed to have writing instruments or really anything that could be considered countable (we'd had some problems with people stealing accounts numbers and such). It was great until they outlawed the water bottles with trackers based on the same fear. The desk wasn't around much longer after I left.

intermittentfasting,ffambg6,t1_ffa6cey,1579739297.0,"Personally, I don't exercise before bed. I find that exercising (especially things like situps or crunches) causes my stomach to cramp sometimes and having food in there doesn't help that feeling at all. If I do it is before I eat and break my fast, but I rarely do that right now. My exercise is usually a walk around my neighbourhood (I try to do 5km) but it's been so bleeding cold here that it has made it difficult (not to mention the mountainside I live on is incredibly icy). Also working out can up my adrenaline and then I won't sleep.

IF is super flexible to fit when you need it to fit, so eat when you need to. A lot of people do 12 pm - 8 pm because it fits with their life, but you can change it to fit yours. :)

TDEE is Total Daily Energy Expenditure. It's how many calories you need every day to keep YOU running. Most people cut their TDEE by about 500 calories and lose a pound a week (500 calories of 7 days = 3500 calories == \~1 pound of fat). You can find calculators online to help determine yours, personally I use [TDEEcalculator.net](https://TDEEcalculator.net). 2000 is a lot of calories to consume in one day to lose weight, but as I don't know your stats I am unsure if that's where you should be. If we use me as an example:

I am 187-188 cm, 105kg, I work an office job and I am 28. I don't exercise much. I need 2300 calories a day to function.

So I cut that number by 500 (The LoseIt! app does it for me) and I eat 1800 calories a day. Or at least that is my budget. 

Usually, I eat about 1300-1500 calories a day, just because I'm not hungry most of the time. I also try to eat a high-lean protein (fish and chicken)/low-carb (I don't even eat rice anymore) diet with plenty of green veg. I lose about a pound/pound and a half per week without exercise because my body is using stored fat as energy instead of the food I just consumed. I also cut out as much sugar as I can and don't eat out a lot. I stay away from white foods too, even my cauliflower is purple or orange. When I break my fast, I break with a big meal too, not a snack. 

So, definitely figure out what your TDEE is and get comfortable with being hungry sometimes. The first couple days of 16:8 can be super hard on people because the hungry feeling isn't one they are used to ignoring. The longer you stay in a fasted state the more of the benefits you'll see from it (autophagy and whatnot). Before I started tracking my IF I wasn't a fan of tracking calories, but it definitely helps. I know where I am during my Nosh and helps keep me on track. Even if you aren't interested in tracking all the time, I'd do it for a week or two to just see where you're at. 

If you have any other questions just let me know, I'm here to help."

If your macros span out like that you're getting 360-400 calories a day from protein, 450-540 from fat, and 800 from carbs (which puts you at 1610-1740 calories consumed per day, not 1500). 

But if you're truly eating 1000 calories less per day then you should be losing 2 pounds a week regardless of exercises. Which is why I'm curious as to what foods you are consuming. Are you sure you're logging everything, every little nibble? Does the MFP app have a macros breakdown (I don't use it so I don't know)? 

Have you been taking measurements? Like not just weighing yourself but taking the tape to your waist and such? If you're doing heavy-weight training it could be that you don't see losses because you are currently building muscle. I don't always see a change in the scale but I see a change in the tape a lot."

This is what is standard, at least to my knowledge. You aren't eating right before bed, you're going to bed 2 hours after you ate which should be fine (not a doctor). My window closes at 8 pm and I try to be in bed at 10 pm and I know a lot of people who do the same thing. IF is supposed to be flexible and work around your schedule, so if you don't get to bed until 4 am make it fit that schedule.

Are you doing 18:6 or 16:8? If you think you're going to struggle a bit don't be afraid to push to 14 and then to 16 or something like that, just to be sure you've got stepping stones. 

> What should I do to get faster results? 

The only thing I can suggest here is to make sure you're eating below your TDEE but enough that your body is aware that food is available and the world hasn't been launched into an emergency famine. 1200 works for some people but not all. If I eat less than 1400 (which I struggle to hit a lot because I am just not hungry a lot of the time) then I don't lose as fast. 

I would also track what you're eating (if you don't already). Just to be sure you're eating enough/not going over your TDEE."

Part of me is almost hoping that she'll pop back into the person I thought she was when we met but she treats me like such a child anymore that I'm not sure I want her too (at dinner she asked ""do you wanna order by yourself or do you need me to help you with it?"" and this is far from the first time we've been to dinner together. The fact she is dating a local has gone to her head when it comes to her still shabby language ability and she thinks I'm utterly helpless without her now). Like I said though, it's killer motivation because I've got an example of 100% what I don't want to be."

fatlogic,fefep2z,t3_eomg76,1579054734.0,"Last night my 'friend' that I've been having issues with now claims to be losing quicker than me. Because she walked instead of drove for a few days which she was on vacation. I told her I was happy that she was losing weight, even just water weight. I'm bloated right now because the time of blood and suffering has fallen upon me and she noticed that, proceeding to tell me it was my body's response to being starved and she felt bad I wasn't losing as fast as her. I do not care if she loses weight faster than me and her comments after I told her congrats felt super baity. like ""yeah, I guess you'll have to take all my old clothes now since I'm thinner."" none of which will fit me anyway as I'm about 30cm taller and we have very different body types. She then suggested we go out to dinner to celebrate her weight loss. 

This is where it started to get on my nerves. Not only did she get on me about only ordering one thing (which was still some chicken karagge, it is NOT healthy in any way but it was what I'd been craving for quite a while), insist on reading the menu translation on her phone to me in a condescending tone even though I told her I was fine reading it, trying to order more food for me than I ordered for myself, she sat there and told me she was allowed to eat her own fried chicken, ramen, yakisoba, and bread on her diet because she'd worked so hard to lose weight and needed to replace those calories. This was the point I gave up, I just couldn't anymore. I recited the Dana Gould bit about ice cream sandwiches in my head and just took a deep breath. After I finished my beautiful chicken (couldn't eat in peace mind you as she watched me eat (a huge pet peeve of mine) and made comments about how small the bites I take are) and waited for her to finish, she decided we were going for ice cream because she deserved it and she proceeded to eat another 900 calories when we got there. 

I checked out of this friendship and it's probably only downhill from here. I'll stick around for a while longer though as stuff like this is weirdly good motivation."

Currently: 16:8, at hour 12+ right now. Getting through with coffee and green tea. My first full day back on task. I haven't missed a day of fasting but I did have some shorter fasts the last week or so. I was traveling across prefectures and there was no chance I was cooking for myself. 

I had a great break and I definitely needed it. Have a special person becoming more involved in my life which is quite nice and who supports me in what I want to do. I'm excited to see where that is going, especially after the last one went on for far too long because we were comfortable. My only concern right now is the scale, but I'm not going to worry much about that as I've been traveling and what have you. It'll get back on track here soon."
intermittentfasting,fd96dkb,t1_fd94o2y,1578229136.0,"Yes, I know. I'm literally basing losing my double chin around how much it has shrunk since August of last year and at the rate I'm losing at, so yes, I think that by the end of Feb it should hopefully be gone. Its also been a goal since Jan of 19, and one I can see progress in. 

Do I understand that it might not be? Absolutely. Is taking a 5km walk an easier goal? Absolutely. Does not achieving that make me a failure? Absolutely not. It is simply a goal. I've been working at this for a while, I'm not naive to how losing weight works. I understand that it might not happen when I'd like but it can still be a goal. What demoralises me the most is when people come in and talk down to me like I don't know what I'm doing or like I'm a child."

I mean, I'll adjust just fine, but it's hard to see it coming and know trying to fix it won't help. The water situation was she asked me what I got and I said the water and she followed it up with: ""Oh so you're going to be one of those people now?""
Usually, she has a soda or a juice and me drinking water was apparently offensive."
fatlogic,fcy7ve4,t3_ejgni9,1578076000.0,"I apologise for my mobile formatting.

One of my friends, who is obese, held an intervention for me. She's been super passive aggressive the last couple of weeks and I figured it was just the weather (winter can be hard on some people). It wasn't.

She thinks I'm hurting myself because I'm losing weight and because I'm not eating a plateful of carbs with every meal. She started in on me about this over dinner when I went with a side of veggies and was going to take the bread that came with the meal home with me (it was a dinner roll and I was going to have it the next day, I was topped up on my carb macro).

She started telling me how she didn't like how my diet made me so tired (it's winter, we're on break from work, of course I'm gonna sleep all I want because I can do that) and she was worried that I was going to end up in the hospital and she wasn't going to help me if I wasn't going to help myself.

I do IF and watch my macros. I do have cheat days, New Years with her was one of them. I eat what I want and I'm happy with the results I'm getting.

I talked with some others about this and they chalked it up it the fact that she isn't losing as fast as I am, if she is at all. When I first arrived I was 21kg (20kg to go) heavier than I am now and she's still about the same weight she was when we met. She constantly eats super calorie dense foods and leading up to her 'intervention' for me she commented all the time on how I wasn't appreciating her cooking if I didn't eat more than I wanted or I if I didn't eat 19 chocolate cookies when everyone else was having some. We had a movie night the other night and I was chastised for getting myself a litre of water instead of cookies and crisps. She had asked that I get her ice cream and I did, no comment made from me, but she got on me about getting a water. I got the water so I didn't have to keep getting up during the movie to refill my glass. She has good qualities, but everything keeps coming back to me losing weight anymore and it is straining our friendship.

Thankfully I've got a supportive person in all of this as well who thinks what I'm doing is great. Who is happy for me and wants to see me succeed. So there is that. I just feel betrayed by someone I considered a good friend"

I'm currently on mobile, because we have a week of holiday from work and I took a little extra time so posting normally isn't always an option right now.

Today was about 17 hours (water and sleep) , I got started late because of the new year where I ate. I ate so much and drank. It was nice to kick back with a friend even if she's been getting mad at me for not eating all the time. She tried to hold an intervention (as we were sitting at a restaurant and I was deciding if I wanted the veggies instead of the tempura and because I didn't eat a piece of bread with dinner) and went on this huge rant about how I'm not eating to make her feel bad about being heavier. She's taken my weight loss as a personal attack and went on to tell me how she thinks I'm killing myself because I'm counting calories and how ""that's so dangerous.""
This isn't the first time she's put me down because of my weight loss and she's always super passive aggressive about it. It's just gotten hard to hang out with her because she pinches my waist everytime she sees me without a baggy jumper on. She can be mad though, it's her problem. She keeps saying I'm not helping her lose weight by losing faster than her. She refuses to cut calories and eats above her TDEE everyday. As I say to a lot of people in this subreddit, I can support you but you have to do the work.

However, in this new year, I am starting above my end of year goal weight! My final weigh in for the year was at 105kg and my goal was 106. I was nervous that I hadn't actually hit it, because I'd been so bloated for a few days prior, but once I dropped the bloat I finally weighed in. I even waited a few days before recording it in my apps to make sure. I am only 20kg away from my goal of 85. I plan on continuing to work hard, I've got some home exercises planned out for the week and I'm working on eating cleaner and cleaner!

Have a good new year DIFT!"

I started out with 12 hr and now I am up to 16. I suggest starting with 14, do it for a week, and then take 30 minutes off either side of the eating window (example: you fast 2000-0600 move your fast start time to 1930 and end time to 0630) or add an hour onto the end (to 2000-0700). Then you're doing 11 hours.
Add every week as you get more comfortable with not eating for longer. And just keep track of you calories."

Update: Fast broke at 1205. I was invited to close out the year with my Principal and he gave me oranges and apple juice and is literally something I cannot refuse because culture.

The fast is still ongoing. Coffee and green tea. 16:8. I was able to pack my lunch today too, which means I'm full of healthy veg and chicken. I've been using shredded cabbage as a substitute for a lot of the rice in my diet. It isn't the best but as long as I don't cook it, it works. Today's weather is a complete whiteout. The wind is just ripping against my school building and it's wonderful. I love this kind of weather. I've learned that I have to be more careful with my deficit this week. I'm only down .5 kg. I know that after the 24 hours I plan on doing this weekend that I may drop a tiny bit more but I'm starting to worry I won't hit my goal. We will see though. I want to be down to 106 by the 5th. My looser skin is starting to bother me. It isn't that I have flaps or anything just that it's like I'm wearing a slightly too big t-shirt on a humid summer night. I'm hoping that, as I'm never been heavy enough to have a huge skin flap, that it will slowly repair itself over the years. Approaching 30 is hard..."
