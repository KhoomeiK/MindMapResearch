Application Analysts are always product specific, which I always strongly discourage because specializing in products does not prepare you for the real world, where technology changes and you need to adapt.

You need to learn technology as opposed to products. In Health Informatics, the technologies that you should be focusing on is *networking*, *security*, and *encryption*. Those are pretty fundamental to informatics. Getting your Network + cert would be a good start. 

There is also a lot of use of serial port communication (RS-232) in health informatics, particularly in the lab. 

The best informaticists out there are the jack-of-all-trades, particularly from a *computer science* background, not IT. 

Also, choosing a specialty is very helpful. Personally, I'm a Radiology specialist so I deal with PACS systems and HL7 interfaces, primarily, and I love it.

CPTSD,feijx1z,t3_ep8jn9,1579140249.0,"I think this is primarily the case mainly based on guilt and/or narcissism, or a combination of both.

Guilt usually manifests itself in one of two ways. Denial is what we usually see in a spouse of an abuser; a mother that allows her 11 year old daughter to be raped in her own home, for instance. And then there's cognitive dissonance, such as trivializing. ""It wasn't that bad... My parents gave me worse"" kind of thing. Very rarely do we see remorse, probably because the guilt and shame prevent it.

And then there's narcissism which is, well, narcissism. Potential gas-lighting or just flat out anger towards those they victimize. You'll never see remorse in the narcissist unless there is a true change of heart and true healing that comes from just being utterly broken and devoting your existence to something greater. Seen it happen, well, happening, anyways.

You have two options and I would threaten with both. Sue for monetary damages in civil court, and/or report your therapist to the licensing board (your state's Psychological Board).

My recommendation would be to send a pre-litigation letter explaining that you are seeking civil liabilities (taking her to court) as well as professional liabilities (reporting her to the state board). Also, remind her that Malpractice Insurance does NOT cover intentional acts of breach of confidentiality. 

The pre-litigation letter is an attempt to settle out of court, as yes, you CAN put a dollar amount on it. I would say that $10,000 should be reasonable, and definitely worth paying to keep her job AND her credibility (ie, ability to continue working as a therapist).

Case in point, before I got my card I used to take trips to Colorado a few times a year. One time I grabbed 4 different strains; 3 were all >20% THC, and one was Harlequin #5 which was 7% THC and 20ish% CBD.

Just take a wild guess as to which of those 4 strains got me *higher*. If you guessed the Harlequin, you'd be absolutely correct.

aspergers,fecox60,t3_eofb2b,1578979496.0,"Life has actually gotten harder over the past few years, but I believe there was a catalyst that initiated my current unravelling.

I first married once when I was 22, caught her cheating on me after 5 years. Took my kids and left. It was devastating,  but it was only marked by the usual emotions, such as jealousy, anger, betrayal, and so on. It didnt really have a lasting impression on me.

I ended starting a relationship with my neighbor (single mother, family housing on campus) and had a few more kids. We got married when I was 31. Life ensued; college, jobs, relocations, bosses that were trying to sleep with me. You know, the usual. (for the record, I never ever cheated on anyone, ever).

So now we're in the great position in our life, in an area that I never thought I would live (Phoenix) and life is generally good. None of the really bad stuff had reared it's ugly head since high school. It was all just a memory.

Then, just before our tenth anniversary, I caught her in an affair... With a 20 year old that she worked with (I'm 41 at this point). I lost it, just lost it.. But I kept quiet. I didnt let anybody know that I knew. I held that shit in for all I was worth. Then I snapped, I couldnt take it anymore. My step-daughter stopped me from killing that jerk; I was in my car with a shotgun.

And that, was when everything went to Hell. Depression the likes of which I have never known before. Suicidal ideation like crazy (made an attempt in high school, but never was an issue after I graduated). And then I found the notes. Notes that I had written to myself that I dont remember writing. Written conversations between me and myself that I dont remember writing. Crazy stuff.

A little time, a little therapy, and I'm good to go, right? Wrong! Not only did the therapy begin to uncover sexual abuse, neglect, and other things that come with growing up in an alcoholic family.

Ever since then I've been on a journey to try to heal these wounds, and come to terms with my past. But I feel like I'm unravelling more every day, like that moment of discovering that affair severed a string in me which held me together, and now I'm coming apart.

Dropping a shitload of acid and hopping in the car, good times. (although I'm not endorsing that kind of behavior). I was even at Further and got to see Daft Punk's first live performance (well, Bangalter's at any rate). I was also really big on Marilyn Manson at this time.

Functional Neuroanatomy was pretty far out, I actually got to hold a human brain. 

I loved learning about the brain and psych, especially neuropsych and the crazy neurological neglects and aphasias that can happen. Pretty wild stuff. 

I dont think it's weird at all."
aspergers,fecbnb6,t3_eoa26t,1578970242.0,"Propane and open flames is no comfort to overprotective parents.

Get an induction burner, they use no heat, but use a magnetic field to cause the pan to get hot almost instantaneous, I believe. 

But it has to be a good quality pan. A teflon coated aluminum job isn't going to cut it. 

Stainless steel and cast iron, I think, will work."
seizures,fec9b9h,t3_e9bvzq,1578968942.0,"One of my daughters started having focal seizures (convulsive) when she was 6. Usually afterwards she would be out of commission, sleeping, the entire day. One time she woke up screaming and holding her head before going back to sleep. She didnt remember that.


She started getting them again this year, twice while asleep and once while in class (college). She never remembers anything, but the headaches the day after is a serious complaint.

If you're surgical wound is looking gnarly, it's absolutely possible that you could have an infection. I would imagine an infection or illness could cause a seizure. 

I'd get that wound looked at if it's a concern. It's likely not a coincidence."

CPTSD,feav7t4,t3_eo3hq0,1578952497.0,"This is rough. I really don't know how to answer this because my problem has been neglect by alcoholic parents; I basically raised myself from 6 y/o on up.

I had no problem loving and taking care of others, but it was the rage, yelling, swearing, punching holes in walls, and heavy-handed discipline which have been the most problematic and shameful for me. While I was never abusive towards my children, I am haunted every single day by the ways in which I have been less than a good parent to them.

This is something that you will need to learn like everything else. Acquire knowledge, apply knowledge, and repeat until it becomes second nature."
