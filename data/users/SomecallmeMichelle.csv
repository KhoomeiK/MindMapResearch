I went there without sleep and too nervous to have a game plan besides ""being honest"", and all that I could do not to freak and bolt was read your comments. As great and as hard as the doctor felt to validate me and sort of put me at ease (it felt incredibly validating for him to be one of the some that call me Michelle) and as much as I tripped and tumbled over my words I truly do belief that without your warmth and votes of confidence it would have been ten times worse.

More appointments, some with other professionals follow. Questionaires and interviews and mental health and look backs at my life. That is fine. While I am incredibly nervous (and I have to admit, bratty) at the less than a year time frame given to me to obtain them I feel I can remember this community always treating me as I identified for warmth.

FanFiction,ff8cdzo,t3_es6vql,1579672786.0,"/r/fanfiction's daily discussion thread has fast become my go to place for emotional support.

That's not a bad thing. Whether it'd be sickness, anxiety or just frustration being here at 5.30 to vent and waking up to everyone's messages of support has been great. It's more than a group of talented writers it's a community. I don't normally end up being awake at 5.30 am (when the thread is posted) and whenever I wake up I feel it too late to speak here, so whenever I'm troubled enough to be awake something bad usually happened.

I'm simultaneously excited, nervous and freaking out rather badly. Today is the day of my first appointment towards hormones (or something like that). It has been almost a decade coming, and if I'm honest I'm 99.99 percent sure it's not something I'll get today but as my therapist says ""the biggest hurdle is taking the first step, that's the one that takes years.""

It's funny because if anything having the date loom closer should make me settle down into excitement. It should make me feel so great that everything falls into place but instead I'm too nervous to focus. I've tried a variety of things - some of my favorite video games, new videogames, voice chat and even writing fanfic but the truth is I always resort to those ""what ifs"". *what if I'm not trans enough, or am but they don't see it as serious or -*

Sorry, I know this is not exactly the best place for venting, even though I consider most of you my friends but though I've more or less gone to bed 4 different times since 8 pm of yesterday I always end twisting awake. There is very little that anyone in this community can do, and part of me feels silly even sharing this...

But you're my friends who have helped me feel better a dozen times before. You're as much part of the reason I held this long as myself. I wanted to celebrate this with you. If I'm totally honest I wanted your vows of good luck and assurances.

So there. Wish me luck! And maybe a few written words in the waiting room while we're at it?

I don't have love for Rowling. I'm a trans woman and she has shown time and time again to.be bigoted to my particular minority as acceptive.as she is otherwise but this sterns from a misunderstand.



There's a thing in theater where,unless you're portaying an opressed minority you pick the best actor for the job. You wouldn't have a white woman in blackface playing a woman of colour but you can have women play little boys (common in peter pan). The ""well Actually I never stated she was white"" comes from this.



Because as soon as the cast of the play were announced the actresses playing Hermione and Rose were harassed. Poked and insulted because ""Hermione wasn't black"". It didn't matter that in grand theater tradition an actor had been picked because they fit the role, Harry Potter was dear to many's people's hearts and this was outrageous.



So I not saying that Rowling doesn't play for brownie points, she does but in this very specific situation it wasn't a weighted choice to change it because fuck what she established but rather a pointless attempt to stop the flaming of not only a woman but also a child. There are plenty of examples to choose from but this isn't one of then."

It only ever happens when a teacher is either abusive, bad, or evil. Like let's run down the list of teachers and how Harry and Ron react to them:


**Mcgonagall**: They wouldn't even dream, rightfully so, they're almost scared to talk in her class.

**Flitwick and Sprout**: Some chatter in the classroom but as they're pratical lessons, not entirely set on listening theory it works out (**Hagrid** would probably also fall under this)

**Binns**: They sleep. Everyone but Hermione sleeps. Even so they study outside (or more likely steal Hermione's notes) and know the course enough that, if Harry hadn't had his vision in the middle of the test he could have passed.

**Quirrel**: There's not really much of a description.


**Lockhart**: They mock him and openly defy him in class. 

**Lupin**: Everyone loves this class, no one talks back here.

(fake) **Moody**: Whether due to fear of punishment or good teaching methods classes go well, from what we gather.

**Umbridge** - well, you know.

**Trelawney**: Openly mocked, seems as somewhat of a charlatan by all but two students. Also a drunk.


**Snape**: For the most part Harry never directly talks back to him as a potions teacher, and always tries his best, it's Snape that openly challenges and mocks him. Worse Harry does openly to Snape as a Potion's teacher is talk to Ron and lie to him. He does have that ""sir"" quip at Defense against the Dark Arts but that's because he's comfortable in that subject.



So yeah, the only teachers who are disrespected are either widly incompetent (Trelawney and Lockhart, Hagrid by the Slytherin, Umbridge) or Malicious (Snape, Umbridge...), no one in the series disrespects good teachers."

The fact that he was loving almost all the time was one of the reasons it took so long for my mum to leave him, we were another but another big one? The fact she genuinely believed no one would care or would help.

Let me tell you this, as someone who was the kid running from side to side of the street trying to get someone to help and who. along with her mother no one would care. It's better to act and be mistaken, than to not act at all.

Não o problema é que há pessoal que vai agora ter o suficiente para viver um bocadinho melhor (não muito, ainda vai custar) mas pode custar mais uns trocos em impostos.

Nick is the easiest to define, his death.canonically in 1492. Tales of Beedle the bard is harder to track but the book does mention he lived in the 15th Century (or so at least the wikia claims).

Around 2014/2015 however the game was completely revamped and built from the ground up using the FOX Engine (yes, the one used for Metal Gear Solid 5), the game was made to more closely mimic the game, almost to simulator like levels.

Here's how a typical play would go in fifa:

Long pass to the front, pass to a fast player and dodge the defense.

While on Pes players actually signal you when they're in a good position, and move according to how you position yourself. There's every chance that if you cross early (or late) the player will get the ball, but fumble it just enough it gets taken.

worldnews,fbf7oq8,t1_fbf60v4,1576803724.0,"There is so much wrong with this. But...fine, let's try to deconstructe it. I have time. It's not like I have someplace to be tomorrow.

Promotion v acceptance - do you see a difference today?

>Acceptance means normalization. We don’t accept rape or it becomes the norm. We don’t accept murder bc it would become typical. Transgenderism is tolerated and treated as the condition it is, just as schizophrenia is.

It is of enormous bigotry to compare being transgender - something that affects only  the person, like it doesn't even factor in society at all - to rape and murder. The reason rape and murder are seen as bad, well one of the reasons is how they affect other people. It's the impact often life-long that destroys not only the person you hurt but also everyone arodn them. Being trans affects only you. - it's not a decision, it's not a decision period, but it's not as if you being trans hurts others. 

Also while I could get into philosophy and statistical studies that disprove your idea that if we normalise murder and rape they become typical I'd rather focus on your bigotry for now. Humans are prone to a societal structure and to live in society - not only for their good but the good of others. Go read some Locke.



>The real bigot here is anyone who turns a blind eye to the REAL LIFE SUICIDES at 40%+ in the trans community while the murder rate of this community is lower than all other subsections of the population

First off, violence against trans people is - if compared statistically - higher than pretty much any other sect of the population. Assault, battery, and murder of trans people is at an alarming number. 

You could make the argument that ""more black people or gay people or white people or whatever people are murdered than trans people"", and...yeah, you'd be right. Purely on a number scales you'd be right. 

But what you fail to take into account (or maybe refuse to take) is that the percentage of the population who is Trans is...shockingly I know, lower than the percentage of cis-het normative people.

Think of it this way, if there's a million white-cis-men in a country at one time and you kill 100, but there's a thousand trans people and you kill 20 you could indeed say that ""more"" of the former died. But statistically the impact was bigger on the trans group.

Furthemore the suicide statistic has been misconstrued a lot. Those are rates prior to transiction. Which yeah, let me tell you, living your whole life feeling as if your body is wrong like your everything and you are wrong - kinda has an impact.

Treatment (REAL TREATMENT -> helping transiction not putting them with a psych who calls them crazy) - reduces that number to near the statistical average of the general populatinon.

Even more is your perceived statement, that just because the number is high it's not worth taking a crack at helping. It'd be like saying that a certain cancer mortality rate is high, might as well not make any attempt at chemo, or that ""Well statistically most people who date end up breaking up instead of marrying, might as well not date"".




>You would encourage people to become trans by telling them it’s normal and okay, knowing it will lead to suicide. Call all the names you want but you’re the one promoting self harm and confusion among the sick.

You don't ""choose"" to become trans. Seriously how fucking hard is it to understand that it's not a choice. What are you going to say next ""Have they tried...not being trans?""

Whether as a mental ilness (as it was previously classified), a disorder, a disturbance or whatever it has long since been held as not a choice. Theories on why vary of course - is it something neurological? Does it happen ni the womb by the brain developing independantly from the body? Does it have a genetic cause?

But what we do know it's that it's not environamental - as in, it's not based on the education one receives. Trans people educated to act and conform to the gender they don't identify with have never stopped being trans. In fact such attemtps have caused nothing but pain and hurt.
