If you have any art forms, painting or poetry, try to make a small piece of art today, and remind yourself that the voice in your head is not an authority on sobriety. The voice in your head often works against your best interests. Make something beautiful today. Then tomorrow, instead of making excuses, make a small piece of art to remind yourself that you are in the process of becoming the person you want to be. One day, one small step, and no more energy spent on yesterday. Like the Queen of England once said, The past cannot be cured. Focus forward, my dear internet stranger and I promise to not drink with you today!"

I fully believed and told others the story. Moved back to the Midwest in high school and found out that the “accident” was actually a shotgun blast to the back. My mom’s grandfather told responding officers that the gun accidentally went off while he was cleaning it. My mom’s little sister was in the house when it happened (she had been sent there to stay because no one thought he would hurt his wife in front of the grandkids). My aunt said she heard the gunshot and ran downstairs to find her grandmother laying on her back dying, trying to speak. My aunt ran to a neighbors house. Her first words to the police: “You can’t make me say he did it!” Oh, and the broken heart turned out to be my mom’s grandfather hanging himself in the garage on the day of the grand jury indictment. Domestic violence was revised to tell a touching love story."

I am just 13 days in, trying to string together enough days that I get myself back. You got this, and try to use affirmations. I have been saying in my head ten times in the morning: I love being sober, and I am happy when I do not drink. Say it in a loop, say it when your mind gets restless.

relationship_advice,fdntyxq,t3_emcsht,1578592785.0,"My advice would be to stop trying to control the situation as it is on his side, not yours. My husband and I do not ever weigh in on the other side’s family relationships. Remember that family often outlast marriages. Your husband and his sister hold each other’s memories and that all predates your involvement. Feel free to block your SIL on social media, and let your husband decide for himself what boundaries he needs to have with his flesh and blood. Siblings are not like friends, and I have seen controlling people bully their partners out of all family support. Try not to let her negativity or indifference get to you, and try to resist pressuring your partner to cut off communication with family. It could come back to haunt you if suddenly he decided one of your family needed to be cut out."

There is a saying that you are only as happy as your saddest child that rings true in my life. Plus there are tons of unloved kids in foster care if you change your mind. I am dead serious when I highly encourage people not to breed. At my master’s thesis defense, my mentor said that each kid equals one less book you will write. Make art, not people."

Once he was born, I realized that parenting is a horrible, haunting, godforsaken set of obligations and chores that no sane person would take on. Every single day, I marvel that my mom didn’t smother me in my cradle. Parenting is awful and all of us who try to do it are doomed to being hated by our offspring even if we do it beautifully and with loving intensity it doesn’t matter. Our kids still hate our guts. Pro tip: don’t breed, do not ever have children for all that is good and holy. Parenting is a trap!"

Try to spark your curiosity, and be nice to yourself. The voice in your head and the reoccurring negative thoughts might be controlled by antidepressants, and your primary doctor can prescribe those (without going back to your therapist).

The great news is that you can walk away, go to another room, say no thanks when she wants to go places with you. Our parents appear to be the most stupid people on the planet when we are 14-16, and it sounds like your mom is a cranky pants too. When she acts rude, walk away. We all play a part in angry people’s life, and vote with your feet to limit your time around her. Now that my parents are in their 80s, I love being around them.
