PresidentialRaceMemes,fffhooy,t1_ffffqp4,1579884189.0,"As crazy as it sounds, because his whole platform is based around UBI, but I think Yang's ideas are more grounded. Bernie hates capitalism while Yang understands capitalism has it's benefits, but we just need to control it better.

Yang is the only one to truly understand capitalism is going to drastically change soon regardless of what we do because automation is going to make a lot of people unemployable. And nothing is going to make a large majority of those unemployable people employable again. As Yang said himself, 40 year old truckers aren't suddenly going to learn a new skill enabling them to make anywhere near what they are now.

If we don't get out ahead of this huge societal change that will upend how civilization has operated since the dawn of time, then we're going to be in for a lot of hurt. Yang is the best thing to happen to US politics in decades because he is the Paul Revere warning us of this. People have been saying it before Yang, I knew about it back in 2016, but Yang has finally drawn national attention to it.

I agree Bernie is definitely the most honest political candidate around, besides Yang. The guy definitely has a cause he believes in, and has stood by his guns. I just don't agree with his whole anti-capitalist stick. We definitely need some socialism in the US when it comes to things like healthcare and better public schools. But at the end of the day, I think the government is shit at running things, and we should only give the government oversight over something as a last resort.

But Bernie would never be able to implement a full socialist revolution. A vote for Bernie is more of a Fuck You to the status quo of binary politics and corporate elites; and a vote for tax dollars to actually help the lower and middle classes with shit like healthcare and education to become affordable again. The healthcare industry and higher education system has robbed us and extorted us for decades, now we can finally do something about it.

Sorry for the rant."

Given their culture of drinking, and zero tolerance of drugs. I.e. pissing hot for weed is at least the equivalent of a DUI, if not worse.

facepalm,ff6cr7a,t1_ff6b0d3,1579624360.0,"What do you mean by unsupervised for 15-20 minutes for a 3 year old?

If you mean a 3 year old play outside by themselves for 15-20 minutes unsupervised that is child neglect, literally, it is.

In a playroom inside I can see it, but you should definitely be within earshot in case they fall and start crying because whatever reason. I wouldn't consider that unsupervised, just more hands off. You still have to be there supervising things. Can't go out for a 15 minute trip to the store, that's unsupervised.

Having nicknames for things is completely different from the kids parent not understanding them. Especially something as common as ""let me in."" If you can't understand your kid when he speaks, then he shouldn't be outside alone.

People will hate this hot take, but the kid probably can't speak that well because the parent doesn't sit and talk with the kid, which is how kids learn to speak in the first place. But lets the kid get all that important unsupervised play.

My kid just turned 3 and talks way better than his 5 year old cousin because my wife and I sit and play with him. The other kid's parents never play with her, it's all her playing alone and she is practically impossible to understand.

Playing alone is great for kids, but it's not nearly as important as interacting with parents on a regular basis."

Not to mention spiders, bees, and hopefully never, but snakes.

If you live in a development with a very small fenced in yard I could see it being okay, but this is far from the norm for most people. Especially completely child safe. Have a patio? Pretty easy to get fucked up on that, especially if there is furniture to climb on.

I will let my kid do stuff like ride his powerwheel around the yard while I sit on the deck, and not paying 100% attention. Just sitting inside is a no go. I know how fast he can get into dicey situations.

The risk of getting diabetes alone is a death sentence in a SHTF scenario. It's hard to be in great shape, but it's easy to be in decent shape or slighty out if shape. And there is a massive difference between slightly out of shape and morbidly obese."
preppers,ff637no,t1_ff5uokh,1579618002.0,"Just to clarify on weight loss and prepping. No one expects preppers to be in great shape and trained fighters. But there is a big difference between 20-30 lbs overweight and 100+ lbs overweight.

If you're 100+ lbs overweight that's your biggest liability, and danger if the SHTF. And should be your #1 priority. You could need medication you can no longer get, have drastically reduced mobility, increased chance of injury or medical condition, lack of ability to perform manual labor, and many other things.

If you're overweight by 20 lbs, but are capable of hiking, performing manual labor, etc... than it isn't really a liability. You're essentially in the same boat as an average fitness person; and any work you do for health would be improving strength, endurance, or fighting skills. Which are skills you'd learn just like practicing with firearms, survival skills, etc..

At least that's my 2 cents."
legaladvice,ff5z5md,t3_errfqt,1579614886.0,"IANAL, but have experienced something similar. You should talk to a medical malpractice attorney first.

If you don't want to deal with legal BS for years, and just want the doctor reprimanded and bills paid, then contact the hospital's risk adviser. This is what the lawyer I talked to advised me, and it was great advice.

Risk Advisers want to stop stuff like this from happening, as it is the ""risk"" of a lawsuit that they are worried about. And they absolutely have the power to wave a wand and have all your bills disappear. No legal BS, no paperwork,  just gone.

What's a LOJ?

If I do have a flag in JPAS and left my job requiring clearance, does that mean I still have a clearance, and my flag will be adjudicated if i get another job requiring clearance?

In other words, would a prospective employer view me as someone without clearance and need to pay all the money to get me one, and deal with the long wait to be hired?

How long does it take for a prospective employer to check someones clearance if they are both DoD agencies? I applied for a job that requires secret, and i gave them my info to check my secret Monday. I emailed them today and they are still trying to hire me. So maybe it's good? I don't want to put doubt in their minds by asking about it.

Long story follows.

It should have stayed active, but I had a very minor infraction, basically forgot to deadbolt a door that was automatically locked anyway. The CSO said it has been happening often, and now he wants to make an example of somebody, so he wrote me and the guy I was with up and sent it up the chain. We specifically asked what this means multiple times, and he just said it depends on what they do with it.

I forgot about it because my buddy went to a job that got him top secret, and he had the same write up as me and was fine. I changed jobs a year ago, roughly 5 months after said incident. My boss told me a month ago they looked at getting us secret but my clearance didn't show up.

I thought they must have made a mistake, and forgot about it. Now I'm on the job hunt, and got nervous about it. Turns out if you have a flag on your JPAS record and leave your job that requires clearance to one that doesn't you automatically lose the clearance.

This is worse than just not having clearance because there is a flag on your record that wont be adjudicated until someone else sponsors you for clearance. And having it makes you much less likely to get sponsored.

Like I said, the issue was minor, and the guy who got the same flag got top secret. But apparently since I left I'm fucked in no man's land. I didn't even know there was a flag or anything. The CSO just kept saying they don't know what happened because of it. Obviously I wouldn't have changed jobs if I knew my situation.

I am filing a FOIA request to see for sure what's up, but this has turned me off from government work entirely. Not trying to have my whole career and livelihood fucked up due to bureaucratic bullshit."

I just see most jobs that care about CISSP require clearance to even be considered which makes the cert a lot less useful. If that was the case I wouldn't have wasted my time because studying for it doesn't teach you much. I would have went for a red hat or networking cert instead.

I'm currently looking for a remote job, and applied for some, but I know the wait to get hired at these jobs is months.

I want out of government contracting work anyway. I just wanted a big pay bump while I study more technical stuff to make the leap to the private sector.

He said he wasn't impressed, and it wasn't any cheaper than a typical grocery store. I think he's insane. I hate when I go to the typical store to get a meat on short noticed. It's never near the quality of costco."
AskReddit,fdqlg6k,t1_fdqjzpe,1578669499.0,"I'm an independent. And I lean conservative, so I'm no fan of Bernie. I was just pointing out the corruption in the democratic party. It continues today with them pushing Biden so hard when he's practically senile, and completely out of touch with the majority of their base.

Most likely I'll vote independent to show my dislike of the corrupt two party system we have now. My state is solidly red, so Trump will win here in a landslide regardless.

As far as Trump goes. I really dislike his personality, and tactics for winning the 2016 primaries. I loathed him. And I will consider him uneducated until my dying day. He is definitely savvy and conniving. He knows how to play people. Which is great for political battles. But as far as understanding foreign relations, economics, policies, etc... he just doesn't know much at all.

BUT, his administration isn't near as bad as I thought it would be, and he has had some decent victories. The Iran thing was great for him, easily the best thing of his administration so far. I support his actions 100% and am so happy the US has established some deterance again.

And the Left's and media's freak out about it just helps him further. Reddit has been insane over it, acting like he's Hitler invading Poland. Same with the media. And they are portraying Iran, fucking Iran, as a victim. It's completely insane, and helped Trump immensly. I know his poll #s will be up next time they're released.

Anyway, that's my two cents on politics. Most people hate me because I think both parties are corrupt shit shows. And I pick politicians based on policies and not politics. By the way, I liked Rubio in 2016, and most conservatives called me a cuck, and liberals called me a the usual shit.

You can't win discussing politics if you aren't ardently right or left because people are so fervent in their support of the parties. Just the way they want it."

Again, there are no serious plotlines in the first 2-3 seasons, and probably only 1 in the first 5 seasons, the Terry being harrassed one. Holt being gay influences the plot, and the character's decisions, but is never a  dominate plot device.

Do you know about India and Sri Lanka and Pakistan. What about Malaysia or Burma (Myanmar). Even Japan and Korea, the most developed Asian countries hate each other, and barely allow any immigration.

Your entire comment is completely false, and yet reeks of smug pompous bullshit. The US has problems, but we are open about them and discuss them. Most other countries don't allow immigration so have zero diversity or are diverse and have literal race wars and ethnic killings.

This then leads the best teachers going to wealthier districts because that's the only way they get paid more. Plus those students are more well behaved because they come stable homes. This just hurts poor districts even more.

There are a myriad of problems with the US education system, and both left and right wingers ignore some of the fundamental issues because it goes against their core political beliefs.

The teacher's union keeping seniority based pay is a huge problem, same as underfunded public schools in poor areas that need a massive infusion of cash.
