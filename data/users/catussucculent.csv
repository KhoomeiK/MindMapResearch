It’s so freeing! :D well to be fair I just did that half head shaving so I can still do like half a pony, but still!! There’s something about shaving our heads that gives a sense of power and control over our lives. I think I kinda understand why Britney did it."

SandersForPresident,ff7bx1r,t1_ff5t4ca,1579645923.0,"While scholars use it in many ways, I’m going to butcher the scholarly definition a bit to sort of give you a picture, so modern neoliberalism is rooted in a “free market capitalism” philosophy. Look at the world around us, politicians with neoliberalism agendas have pushed for policies that have indirectly or directly created inequality, the privatization of natural resources, the overuse of natural resources with no regulations, discrimination, pollution, etc. to name a few. While yes, we could argue that some policies have been good to the economy, we must ask ourselves where do we draw the line? But don’t take my word for it, It’s a term worthy of study."

depression,ff5nmmn,t3_err086,1579601984.0,"Been here. And then one feels like shit, worse than before because of the depressant in alcohol. It’s a vicious cycle. I’m all too familiar and because of that here’s my unsolicited story of how I’ve been able to be sober, so music has really  helped me sort of step out of my reality and sort of picked  me up in a way from falling deeper. I picked up the guitar again and it’s been really therapeutic. Whenever Im feeling shit or feeling like reaching for my bottle I reach for my guitar and just jam for what ends up being hours. People say “hitting the gym” or getting “physical exercise” will make you feel better, while true, honestly sounds like a total joke to someone struggling with depression. They never mention exercising your mind. I get the same kick out of playing guitar than going to the gym. Pick up a skill, music, art, whatever and just loose yourself in it. Don’t let depression win. It’s an uphill battle but a worthy one.
Try to stay away from the bottle and drink water. Stay hydrated & healthy."

poshmark,fcm61dl,t1_fck4fyv,1577765147.0,"I’m not bitter, I’m just serious about selling. I have a pretty successful boutique, that being said, I’m very active on Poshmark so when people like an item I’m inclined to make an offer. My issue is when poshers spam me with likes that’s just annoying. It defeats the purpose of the “like” button, I think the like button is misunderstood"
poshmark,fcm5lbh,t1_fcjqctw,1577764825.0,"If your interest in the item is genuine and you have an interest in purchasing the item, by all means  go ahead and like it. That is what the feature is for. But if you’re going to spam my closet with likes and not interested in buying the items, I’d rather you not. I’m serious about selling and frequently make an offer to likers, so from my standpoint it’s a waste of time to like a ton of items you have no interest in, it defeats the purpose of the “like” feature on Poshmark"
poshmark,fclqnu3,t1_fcki7fh,1577754118.0,"I’m serious about selling, so if you’re going to spam my closet with no intention of buying anything... I’d rather you not.... it’s not being bitter, this is a business app and not really a social app although we could argue that it’s marketed this way"
poshmark,fclqjip,t1_fck9ghf,1577754035.0,I agree. I’m serious about selling so these unintentional likes and comments I see as a waste of time
poshmark,fclq8t5,t1_fclbkif,1577753830.0,Meh. If you don’t have genuine or serious interest in buying items in my closet i don’t see the point
poshmark,fclq17q,t1_fclj173,1577753684.0,Im so confused as well with all the downvotes!!! I’m surprised this is an unpopular opinion. I’ve just noticed that newbies tend to “like” many things in my closer that they have no intention of buying as a form of trying to direct attention to their closet in which a “share” or a follow could do just that. This is spam and it is annoying. As a result I started to bundle EVERYTHING they’ve liked so they can get what they’re doing lol
raisedbynarcissists,fc6aoad,t3_egaph7,1577476151.0,This might actually explain why I’m a really reserved person. At 24 I’m just realizing this. I swear I find out more about my self and my Nmom on this subreddit than I ever do in therapy. Thank you to everyone who share their stories you’re helping others open their eyes.
