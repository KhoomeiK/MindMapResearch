sex,ffbf5wr,t3_esejzf,1579762626.0,"If you are ready to seriously consider divorce, try to suggest an open relationship before that. Talk to her about your needs and ask her how she would feel about you meeting other women for sex. Maybe she is disinterested from sex and not jealous and she'll see it as a winwin: you'll be happier and she won't have to humor you and do sex like a chore.

If that doesn't work, well, sex frustration will drive you bitter and crazy. Especially since you're young. So maybe you should indeed end it.

Edit:also she can put some rules on your open relationship. For instance no kissing with other girls. Or always telling her about it and keeping her informed of your sex life. Or on the contrary, never telling her anything and make sure it never gets in her way. Or never twice with the same girl. Or only with turists/people that don't stay in the area. Or on the contrary, only with one other women, a local that she knows and trust. Also be clear about what the rules are for her. There is a lot of way to make an open relationship more comfortable for both."
sex,ffbe4y5,t3_esof59,1579761432.0,"Could be the materials of your sport trousers. Some people react a lot to particular textures and tightness. Could be you seeing yourself working out. Could be the friction of your genitals on some equipments (saddle of bike?) could be you being subconsciously attracted to other people working out. Could be just the increased blood flow irrigating some parts. Could be pheromones in the air. 
You can test most of these options. What happens if you work out alone at home? Wearing something different? Not looking at the mirrors?"
sex,ffbdpen,t3_esoxij,1579760948.0,"Either they got the super expensive laser removal. Or it's just the camera quality being too low to notice details.

trashy,ff8c10z,t3_es06zv,1579672417.0,"For a manager position, it is a legitimate concern when a person show signs of financial struggle. People with a 6 digits salary who struggle financially have most likely a gambling or other addiction problem. It's really not about the car, it's about knowing if you could pay for the car if you wanted to or if you're deep in some serious trouble.

If you make it clear that you're saving for something else (or for later) and that you don't like consumerism and you'll drive the car until it's beyond repair, they'll most likely leave you be."

One time, eating dinner with friends and him, he just suddenly puts his spoon in front of my mouth and I sucked it clean instantly, by reflex. 2 things here. First, the fact that I didn't even think about how sucking something someone else is holding in public might be way too sexual for the audience. I just did it, as a reflex, not even considering if I should or not. I'm his submissive, he puts something in front of my mouth, I suck it. Second, the look and smile he gave me of satisfaction when I did it. He knew exactly what he did and it basically him saying ""I own you"" in public. That was a damn good power move from him."

AmItheAsshole,fdly4c3,t3_eluqog,1578535271.0,"I'm guessing an untouched 3 month old bottle of pills wasn't in the front of the cabinet either. Opening the medicine cabinet is already looking for something. But he probably had to dig through it and bother looking at every labels to find the strong stuff. My guess is, he lied about being clean for a year.
Also, addiction is a terrible disease and a sentence to a lifetime of struggle. It makes people unreliable. Anybody who starts dating an addict needs to be aware of the risk and if in doubt, take necessary measure. For instance, tell the friends you are visiting about it.

You're NTA but you should still be careful with what you've got laying around in your house. Especially with your kid growing up, learn to consider strong medications a real threat and dispose of them/ lock them up."
