I'm no longer religious, but I've been to smaller churches with friends and even some of the very old cathedrals in Charleston for their services and found them much more tolerant and kind. Going to the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist on a Sunday morning was worth it to hear the choir alone. The acoustics of that cathedral with those Gregorian chants...chills, man."

DiscoElysium,fdbr3b4,t1_fd9r1nk,1578260592.0,"**Volition** [Impossible: Failure] - Disco Elysium tore down the whole RPG genre for you. You just can't experience and appreciate other games of similiar genres as you did before, not after you played DE.

**Conceptualization** [Heroic: Success] - The story, the writing, the art, the music -- it's an ideal amalgamation of what was always dear to your heart, a beautiful ferocious chimera eating away at your very soul. And you love it -- being eaten piece by piece and digested by this magnificent phasmid of a game

**Pain Threshold** [Challenging: Success] - it pains you deeply, yet you beg for it to continue, to never stop its feast.

**Drama** [Easy: Success] - You just can't look at other games like this anymore, my Leige. They look so shallow, primitive, uninspiring, flawed at their very cores, almost unpure and foul even. Imposters!

**LIMBIC SYSTEM** - It feels like you met your perfect soulmate, had an absolute happiness together, but now it's mere past, irretrievable, and nobody will ever come close to what you felt together with the person you shared an overpowering, all-consuming Disco happiness with. Now you are alone forever, chasing shadow of your loved one in others -- in vain, tainted, perpetually spoiled."

witcher,fd600t7,t1_fd5kjg3,1578183658.0,">Oddly enough I never found it that jarring in the Bourne films, I guess it went a little better with the frantic and tense feel of the films. I hate it for introducing it to the industry however...

I'm confused, isn't this exactly what the video is saying? The title is a little misleading, granted, but if you watch the whole thing, it's basically a defense of the Borne trilogy and a criticism of its derivative successors."
