But as you get older, you’ll have to make more and more choices that others disagree with- only you truly know what’s best for you (as long as you are a rational/ truth seeking person. Let’s be honest, emotions are liars, so emotional decisions can often be wrong). If you want to create a life for yourself that’s fulfilling, you’ll need to find a balance between creating strong and rewarding relationships AND not really caring what others think about your choices.

Although, I do find it valuable to have someone that I regularly consult with. A third party, not a family member- mine is a very close friend that thinks similarly to myself and has produced good fruit in her life."
