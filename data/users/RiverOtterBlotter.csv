1.  If you do not already have WIFI and wired configured on your xbox: Enable wifi connection, confirm it works on WIFI by going online, then plug ethernet cable back in, confirm it works too, keep the ethernet plugged in.

2.  First Restart the xbox.  A proper full restart  NOTE:  If you’re using “instant on” power mode then your xbox does not restart when you hit the button, so in this case you need to force a restart by pressing the guide button on the controller, go to settings, select Restart Console, and confirm.

3.  With Ethernet cable plugged in, start GTA.  After you see the big wall of words “Use of this software is subject to license….” just go to the dashboard and force quit GTA.  There is no timing, just do it any time after you see that big agreement.

4.  Unplug your ethernet cable.

5.  Wait for Xbox to stabilize and let it sign itself into to Xbox Live (via Wifi).

6.  Launch GTA:Online and load into a populated session.

7.  Plug ethernet cable back in and make your character walk around.

8.  Everyone will leave your session.  Done -  the lobby is locked.  If something else happens, go back to step 2.  when the lobby is locked you can invite players but random people can't join. 

(If this is too much for you, join one of those groups who does it for you like r/MCCEO or r/peacefulceo )"
