Not saying I am top tier player or anything but it seems like the rng can screw some groups over.

do a +4 and get a feel for it. second affix. if u breeze thru this then go direct to +7 or if u are a bit uncomfortable do a +6. it is important to feel comfortable with it. A small panic heal here or there is no big deal but if u are constant panic then either u are not geared enough or u are not comfortable enough. or it could be tank but over a few runs u can rule it out pretty fast. also it is about this time u can no longer brute force bosses. learn strats around this time as well.

once u hit +7 to +9 it is a medium boy league. 3rd affix means u are doing alot more then just healing. u may have to move, u may have to dps to make timers, u may have to even sacrifice a dps so the tank lives. this is all about reacting and deciding what is important and a key reason u need to be comfortable with doing +6 and under first, u cant be reading up what that stuff is mid run. read up on the affix before going in so u know whats up.

at +10 (as a healer anyhows) its more or less all of the above plus emissaries. not much to learn on top but more of a challenge.
