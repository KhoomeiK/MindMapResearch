You can try just talking to her about different training techniques and talk up more gentle techniques, or maybe try inviting her to go to obedience classes that you know are more positive reinforcement based?

I know a lot of horse people with yank their horses around when they're scared, and I know that's different but it couldn't hurt to ask her, right? And if she *is* scared when leading her dog, then leading a dog that is maybe less intimidating would help?"
