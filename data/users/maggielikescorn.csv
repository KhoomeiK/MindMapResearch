whatplantisthis,feitsrj,t1_feiqrgo,1579147023.0,This is my favorite houseplant :) I have four different varigations of the marginata alone! Very hardy and very little care demands! Just be careful of root rot especially since she’s leggy already. I learned from some light research that these plants use their stalk as a straw to suck up as much water as possible from the waterings so they are very much drought tolerant in that way!
whatplantisthis,feiqhrm,t3_epcf7s,1579144672.0,"Yes! Definitely dracaena marginata! I’d let her dry out, give her more light and potentially give her a good prune and stake her when she’s acclimated! :) good luck! 🍀"
houseplants,fehv4gh,t3_ep6ie6,1579124476.0,I was a lucky duck and found a couple of these at a local plant shop in upper Michigan! The owner said he wasn’t sure exactly what they were so I got two 6in rhaphs for only $30!!
cats,fehmrft,t3_ep2wrc,1579119699.0,I have a sinky boy at home too! :)

matureplants,feh8017,t1_feh7pk6,1579111043.0,I think the same! I like this plant in the same way I like curvy big dracaenas! :)
matureplants,fegrf8n,t1_fegr7dp,1579100785.0,Yes!! I saw that monster on my way out! She’s big and beautiful! :)
houseplants,fegq1p5,t3_eovbum,1579099835.0,There’s just something about a spider mama and her family that looks so complete :’)
matureplants,fegpmmw,t1_feg7lc6,1579099548.0," Believe you me, if I were on the plant crew the big boys like this would be moved!! :)"

CampingandHiking,fdk6lwy,t3_elthky,1578497257.0,"Not sure but running definitely wouldn’t be my move. I live in upper Michigan and I’ve come across moose from time to time in the spring and summer while driving and if I’ve learned anything about them, it’s that they can book it!!!"
whatsthisplant,fdi6x2t,t3_elip2r,1578436817.0,The second could be in the aralia family perhaps?
