politics,fe9jmwj,t1_fe8ro8m,1578938278.0,"Copying this from an earlier comment of mine. The math for a public option doesn't work out.

Copied comment:

TLDR: The public option is a talking point designed to sound reasonable, but is essentially a poison pill in terms of policy. It's basically a 5% savings over current insurance.

One of the biggest savings in healthcare costs from M4A would come from simplified administrative costs, providers no longer need an entire, quite extensive, billing department to manage filing claims, just send the bill to the govt. This allows care under M4A to be cheaper, as overhead is lower.

34% of healthcare costs are administrative: https://annals.org/aim/article-abstract/2758511/health-care-administrative-costs-united-states-canada-2017

A public option has the major downside of doing nothing to address this administrative bloat, as the providers still need to be able to handle claims for dozens of insurance providers. This primarily means 2 things:

 1. A public option cannot decrease the cost of healthcare more than a M4A-type system.

 2. The cost of a public option cannot be significantly lower than private insurance for similar coverage.

On point 1, look to the administrative costs mentioned above.

On point 2, since we lose the ability to lower administrative costs, the only savings in a public option comes from removing the profit incentive of insurance. So, as a coarse analysis, reduce the cost of your plan by the net margin of your insurance provider. 4.6% in the case of Blur Cross.

A public option would save you 4.6% at a first pass. More than that would require that the government be able to run an insurance company more efficiently than the current insurance companies.

>>We find that North American and European consumers are likely to experience ubiquitous and long‐term uptake doses of PFOS and PFOA in the range of 3 to 220 ng per kg body weight per day (ng/kgbw/day) and 1 to 130 ng/kgbw/day, respectively. The greatest portion of the chronic exposure to PFOS and PFOA is likely to result from the **intake of contaminated foods, including drinking water**. Consumer products cause a minor portion of the consumer exposure to PFOS and PFOA. Of these, it is mainly impregnation sprays, treated carpets in homes, and coated food contact materials that may lead to consumer exposure to PFOS and PFOA. Children tend to experience higher total uptake doses (on a body weight basis) than teenagers and adults because of higher relative uptake via food consumption and hand‐to‐mouth transfer of chemical from treated carpets and ingestion of dust. The uptake estimates based on scenarios are within the range of values derived from blood serum data by applying a one‐compartment pharmacokinetic model.

The main avenue of exposure through cookware is from the coating simply flaking off and being eaten. When you see a formerly non-stick pan with no coating left, you ate all that.

Microwaved containers can easily volatilize all kinds of organics just due to how they work, things like water-proofing sprays are already aerosolized.

Not to mention byproducts of manufacturing, which are in the water supply of millions of people.

I don't really see your point, you mention one of the least probable exposure routes, then claim since it is improbable, the material is safe.

A causal link has been established between PFAS (per and poly fluoroalkyl substances) and many diseases, but I do not think the mechanism has been determined.

Most hydrophobic coatings are long chain halocarbon polymers. That means there are lots of carbon atoms bound to each other (long chain) and bound to halogen atoms like fluorine and chlorine.

Teflon that coats non-stick pans is a fluorocarbon, for instance.

The problem with these molecules is that, with **very** few exceptions, nature does not make halocarbon bonds and has no tools to deal with these molecules in the environment or inside an organism. Many of them are known or suspected carcinogens, including teflon, and the only thing keeping the rest off the list is industry lobbying.

You need a beefy computer to stream games over your home network to the, I assume, much weaker client PCs of your kids/wife?

It's an interesting question, but I feel like we need more details. 

What is the desired output resolution/fps? 

What kind of games are typically played? Shooters like FO76 or turn-based stuff like Civ?

The CPU side won't be as important as the GPUs, as most games these days still don't use more than 4 threads for any heavy lifting, and hopefully with a VM there is less going on in the background to steal performance. However, game streaming tends to involve heavy compression of the video stream, and im not sure if that is performed on the CPU or GPU with unraid, you should find that out before going further.

For the sake of symmetry, I think a 3900x would be a good choice for the CPU, since at least every VM should be identical in theory.

The GPUs are harder to recommend without knowing the specifics of the application, but my gut tells me 1650s won't be ideal.

A more sophisticated method is having every projectile cast a ray towards its travel direction for the space it will cover at the next frame, so it knows if there is something between where it is now and where it will be at the next physics update (so it won't just phase through something).

I do not know DE's engine, but raycasting is basically free performance-wise on modern commercial engines (Unity, UE4, etc.), so I doubt they made the projectiles slow because they didn't want to deal with them phasing through fighters. 

This only becomes a problem when the bullet is moving fast enough that it can cross the shortest length of the collider in the time between physics ticks, which is usually something like 1/50th of a second, so there's a lot of headroom for speeding up Apoc shots before it even becomes an issue."

politics,fcgm66u,t1_fcghzhh,1577641647.0,"TLDR: The public option is a talking point designed to sound reasonable, but is essentially a poison pill in terms of policy. It's basically a 5% savings over current insurance.



One of the biggest savings in healthcare costs from M4A would come from simplified administrative costs, providers no longer need an entire, quite extensive, billing department to manage filing claims, just send the bill to the govt. This allows care under M4A to be cheaper, as overhead is lower.

A public option has the major downside of doing nothing to address this administrative bloat, as the providers still need to be able to handle claims for dozens of insurance providers. This primarily means 2 things:

1. A public option cannot decrease the cost of healthcare more than a M4A-type system.

2. The cost of a public option cannot be significantly lower than private insurance for similar coverage.

On point 1, look to the administrative costs mentioned above.

On point 2, since we lose the ability to lower administrative costs, the only savings in a public option comes from removing the profit incentive of insurance. So, as a coarse analysis, reduce the cost of your plan by the net margin of your insurance provider. 4.6% in the case of Blur Cross.

A public option would save you 4.6% at a first pass. More than that would require that the government be able to run an insurance company more efficiently than the current insurance companies.
