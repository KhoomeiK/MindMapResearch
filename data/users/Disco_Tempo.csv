A dictionary definition says:

>an economic system in which investment in and ownership of the means of production, distribution, and exchange of wealth is made and maintained chiefly by private individuals or corporations, especially as contrasted to cooperatively or state-owned means of wealth.

All Warren is saying is that she supports an economic system with private ownership of property and for the means of production to be largely managed by private individuals. That doesn't mean that things like healthcare, child care, public transportation, etc. can't be heavily subsidized by the government--if it did, then the US has never been a capitalist country. And if you say that, you're using a definition that really isn't useful in most contexts. 

This definition would even apply to Bernie Sanders in many regards, even though he wants to nationalize many of the most important, infrastructural industries. Saying ""regulated capitalism is not capitalism"" is a Republican/Libertarian talking point, even if you're using it to make a different argument.

Without those institutions, without a robust, well-working government, addressing everything from environmental policy to wealth inequality will be impossible, no matter what laws you pass. That's what 4 more years of Trump threatens. 

Biden at least has some respect for, and would leave in place, the institutions we need to pass the reforms you want. I think this gets lost in talking about Presidential elections, but the President is not a king, even if the Republicans want to treat theirs like one--more and more progressives are entering the legislature every election, and they will be the ones sending Biden laws. The correct strategy, if he wins the nomination, is to vote for him as well as every Democrat down the ticket. It will take a coalition of everyone on the liberal spectrum to pass these reforms.

Then while doing much better in those states, simultaneously lose the states he won by thin margins last time (PA, WI, MI). Given the polarized political environment, it's hard to see him improving in blue states and/or dramatically improving in red states, while simultaneously doing worse in the states *he won in '16. Maybe if his trade war ends up being more important to voters in the Midwest than we're currently aware, it could cause a split between GOP voters in the Midwest vs the South, but you'd still probably need to see improvements in blue states, which would be hard to explain in that environment. 

I think the easiest way to track his possible electoral outcomes is with [Morning Consult's state-by-state popularity map](https://morningconsult.com/tracking-trump-2/), which shows him doing well where you'd expect, and poor where you'd expect, with those same 3 states that won him the election (PA, WI, MI) showing his favorability underwater anywhere from 6-15%. If his vote share corresponds at all to his favorability, it looks like the important states this time around will be a lot like the important ones in 2016.

People would think they were on drugs, or an idiot. 

While the media is to blame, the consumers have a role, too. I've seen, way too often, people sharing these meritless opinion articles; when confronted about their poor quality, all-too-often people say, ""Well, it's just an opinion."" Part of the reason we are where we're at today is because people think all opinions are created equal, and that an opinion argued well has as much merit as an opinion argued poorly, or not at all.

I think what they're trying to get at is that prices tend to decrease in proportion to the greater quantity of units a given market is willing to buy; they just don't know why that's the case."

For example, there are reasons to include certain criteria for the definition of ""not showing up"" and reasons to exclude certain criteria--in the case of your video, McAleenan discusses a specific program in a very narrow time frame. [This article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/06/26/how-many-migrants-show-up-immigration-court-hearings/) explains the complexity of the issue. 

>A migrant either attends a court hearing or doesn’t attend. It’s a yes-or-no question that lends itself to simple math. Yet the numbers vary widely.

>Because immigration court records are secret, the government’s statistics are difficult to verify. **Some of them measure a subset of immigration cases and tell one story. Some numbers crunched by researchers tell another story. The picture can be blurry because an immigration case may involve several hearings over more than one year.**

>We reviewed statistics from the Justice Department (which runs the immigration courts), the Department of Homeland Security (which oversees the border) and independent researchers analyzing court records.

>**The Justice Department reports no-show statistics based on “initial case completions,” a metric that doesn’t count some migrants who show up for court but have their cases postponed or who don’t get a resolution. Completed cases sometimes are reopened and result in different outcomes.**

>Pence’s claim distorts what acting Homeland Security secretary Kevin McAleenan told the Senate Judiciary Committee in a June 11 hearing. The panel chairman, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), asked “what percentage of the people show up for the asylum hearing?”

>“So, it depends on the demographic, the court, but we do see too many cases where people are not showing up,” McAleenan said. “We did an expedited pilot with family units this year with ICE [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement] and the immigration courts. Out of those 7,000 cases, 90 [percent] received final orders of removal in absentia, 90 percent.”

>He added, “That is a recent sample from families crossing the border.”

>**Notice how McAleenan framed his answer. The 90 percent rate he gave was based on a sample of 7,000 cases being fast-tracked through the immigration courts, not all cases.**

>A representative for Pence told us he **“was referring to a pilot program launched under DHS,” the same one McAleenan brought up to the Senate Judiciary Committee.**

>But Pence did not hedge his comments as McAleenan did and instead indicated that 90 percent of all migrants never show up for court. When CNN anchor Jake Tapper challenged him, Pence dug in. “The overwhelming majority, plus-90 percent, don’t show up,” he said.

>**Graham’s question was about asylum hearings, not about all immigration cases. From fiscal 2013 through 2017, asylum applicants received deportation orders “in absentia” in 6 percent to 11 percent of cases per year,** according to the most recent statistics yearbook from the Justice Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review. The term “in absentia” is used when someone didn’t show up to court.

>Let’s take a look at the different statistics measuring court appearance rates for migrants.

The rest of the article goes into the many facets of the complex immigration system, but you should take any numbers with the understanding that they seem to typically give a picture of one small part of the entire process of immigration and asylum-seeking. One red flag is that it takes a study to posit a number in the first place, as opposed to simply referring to some cut-and-dried government record.

OP's Vox article references a study done by the TRAC program, which is giving the 99% number. This is what the article mentioned above, written in June 2019, says about TRAC:

>Researchers at the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) at Syracuse University in a June 18 report found that 81 percent of migrant families attended all their court hearings, measuring from September through May.

>“Thus, court records directly contradict the widely quoted claim that ’90 Percent of Recent Asylum Seekers Skipped Their Hearings,’” the report says, linking to an article about McAleenan’s testimony on June 11.

>**How is it possible that 81 percent of families attend all their hearings, when the Justice Department says the attendance rates are much lower?** (And not just the Justice Department — an older data set from TRAC covering 2014 to 2018 shows that 49 percent of families attended their hearings.)

>Susan B. Long, the co-director of TRAC and a managerial statistics professor at Syracuse University, said **the difference is in counting all ongoing cases instead of only completed cases.** “We didn’t remove anything,” she said. “It’s exactly how the data is recorded.”

>Of 46,743 families, 85.5 percent attended their initial hearing and 81 percent attended all their hearings, according to TRAC. “Most have had only one scheduled hearing,” Long said. For those families with legal representation, the attendance rate was 99.9 percent at the first hearing and 99 percent for all hearings, the TRAC report says.

>**Woltornist, the Justice Department spokesman, said, “I don’t know exactly where they got the numbers.” The TRAC report says researchers obtained records from the nation’s immigration courts by filing requests to EOIR under the Freedom of Information Act.**
