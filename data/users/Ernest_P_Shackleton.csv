He was an asshole to Erin, the next episode he’s awful to Spencer.  Then Spencer disappears for 3 weeks because Dan sucks at DND and takes over everything while simultaneously being too drunk to understand what he’s doing so he blames everyone else.  It’s also during the time that he shits on therapy a ton.   

It gives a lot of credit to current Dan and how his mental health has improved.  Makes me look inward and know that I can always be a better person to those around me."

There’s too many climbers who are too cool for any of that crap, but It could save you a broken ankle, head injury or even death.  The only injuries at my gym (that I managed) were ankle injuries from improper spotting.  Totally avoidable.  Don’t get me started on belay technique and knot dressing.  Also, you would not believe what goes on behind the scenes at rock gyms.  Ropes that never get logged or swapped out.  Old frayed harnesses for rental.  Structures that are never inspected from the inside, inept management, loose holds.  There’s also no oversight, no one comes and does inspections unless you pay several thousands to get them out there.  There’s no license or any official way of knowing that the gym you go climb in was ever inspected for safety or ever will.  It’s the Wild West with a bunch of over confident climbers who always think it’ll be fine."
