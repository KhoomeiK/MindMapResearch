I think you'll want to georeference/rubbersheet each image before trying to merge them.

Not sure at what license level, but it's also possible to put your frame-center dots into ArcMap and have that be clickable, bringing up unmerged images from a server.  [Here's an example.](http://maps.isgs.illinois.edu/ilhap/)"

Maps,ffc9b8w,t3_esuga3,1579794483.0,"So you've got three interconnected problems:

* Figuring out which photo goes where.  This is just a jigsaw puzzle problem, and is made easier by the water you noted.  Also look at the marginalia on the prints, which typically will show a clock (time of day the photo was taken) or a frame number.  Both those will allow you to reconstruct the flight sequence.

* Scanning and merging the images.  Obviously, scanning isn't much of a challenge, but you're likely to find noticeable differences in brightness and contrast from one photo to the next, meaning you'll want to have a way of feathering one image unnoticeably into the next.  Aerials often include at least 60 percent overlap (so they could be used for stereo viewing and mapping), so you can typically just use the juicy filet from the middle of each image.

* Georeferencing and orthocorrection.  You can't keep the airplane perfectly level and perfectly straight, so from frame to frame there will be differences in scale and orientation, and even a single frame will often have a slight tilt to it.  This requires orthocorrection, by georeferencing things visible in the photos to places whose position is known.  In much of the country, intersections of section-line roads are an easy thing to spot.  On the East Coast, you may be looking at chimneys of older houses, older bridges, lighthouses, etc., that don't move and are still visible on modern maps and aerials.  You'll be georeferencing to modern, known positions in GIS software, and this (not Photoshop) will typically be where you merge and store the resulting imagery—even if you then also make a big printout for the office wall.

There are a number of contractors who do this type of work regularly, including overseas companies that use Indian or Mexican labor for cost savings.

Finally, rereading your post, I see that you're not necessarily committed to merging the imagery, and may just want a way to index them so you can find the right frame.  For that, just use a paper map of the counties and, based on what you can see in the photo, put a big dot at the center of what it shows, along with the photo number.  Commonly, aerial photos were designated with a flightline number (one pass across the county or whatever) and frame number.  You might find numbers such as 17-4 somewhere on the photos.  Once you've done 5 or 6 photos, a pattern is likely to be apparent."

No buildings anywhere were ever used for airship mooring, though there was a one-time publicity stunt in the 1930s to deliver newspapers to the Empire State Building.

There's a photo displayed in the Hotel Inter-Continental showing the building with an airship nearby.  Someone in the history of the Medinah Athletic Club (the building's original owner) pasted a note on the photo saying ""Count Dr. Eckener and his Zeppelin visits our club by air."" Apparently based on nothing more than this, some hotel employee began telling the story that the hotel's chimney was designed for zeppelins. It isn't true, and would just be utterly impractical. Airship passengers disembark from a cabin hung under the belly, while a mooring mast would attach to the nose. Plus the tail of a 200-foot-long airship docked to the top of the hotel would swing around in the wind and hit the top of Tribune Tower!

The Hotel Inter-Continental has a decorative chimney cap designed to resemble a minaret, topped with a nonstructural flagpole.  There’s no steel structure or other provision of any kind for airship mooring; no catwalks or stairways for crew or passengers.  

It's really hard to prove a negative, but I went through the online *Tribune* archives back in 2011, looking to lay this urban legend to rest, and could find absolutely no mention of an airship dock.

AskHistorians,fdrsj2x,t3_emp5n0,1578689009.0,"I can help with a few notes:

*Lonesome Dove* is set in the late 1870s (the 1876 Battle of Little Big Horn is joked about in Chapter 93), when Fort Worth is the end of the Texas & Pacific/Missouri & Pacific railroad line linking North Texas to St. Louis and to Eastern meat markets.  Fort Worth had been on the Chisholm Trail* that linked South Texas ranching country with Abilene, Kansas—the end for a few years of an earlier railroad link.  So Fort Worth had a particular importance as the trading center for the longhorn cattle ranched in post-Civil War Texas, and therefore it would be logical for someone associated with cattle, such as Jake Spoon, to pass through and be known there.  Though Fort Worth might *look* like a suburb of Dallas, historically it predates Dallas (as evidenced by the name, established when the area was a frontier for European settlers) and had become a small city a decade before Dallas began to grow.  The two cities, 30 miles apart, grew quite independently, fierce rivals, until the end of the 20th century.

As for the route Roscoe Brown would take from Fort Smith to Texas, the novel mentions (end of Chapter 51) that there was an easy road to follow, laid out by Captain Marcy.  That’s true—but it was a road **westward,** toward Santa Fe by way of the Texas Panhandle (essentially today’s Interstate 40).  But Arkansas, settled for nearly 50 years by then, had other roads and traces through the forest, including those skirting the eastern edge of the Kiamichi Mountains southward from Fort Smith to the sandy-loam farmland and timberlands of Southwest Arkansas and Northeast Texas.  Roscoe discusses (in Chapter 43) the difficulties of finding his way based on asking the inhabitants, but he would have found his way south, probably avoiding the Indian Territory (today’s Oklahoma) for various reasons (including a graphic warning from the soldiers), to cross the Red River and enter Northeast Texas near Piney Point, Richmond, Index, or Fulton (all near modern Texarkana). The small group of soldiers he meets tells him all he has to do is to hold a southwest course and he’ll find San Antonio.  That's a practical way of navigating on open prairies, on a sunny day—but ""southwest"" is a hard concept to keep in mind when working your way through forests and underbrush. One of the reasons he decides to let Janey accompany him is that she mentions having walked from San Antonio, meaning she might know the way back there.

**Introducing the Equal Earth projection**

The Equal Earth map projection shows continents and countries at their true sizes relative to
each other. Continents keep their familiar shapes and the rounded sides of the map suggest
the spherical form of the Earth. Straight parallels make it easier to compare how far north or
south places are from the equator.

AskAnAmerican,fd6hn3o,t1_fd6d48b,1578191159.0,"American school buses are almost always bonnet-forward models, as those are cheaper.  California has specific standards for school buses that mean theirs look more like a public transport bus, with a flat front.  The flat-front models are occasionally seen elsewhere as well.  But they are almost always yellow, a dedicated fleet owned by the school authorities or contractors.

Public transport buses typically are only 10.5 feet tall, with front and rear doors; while intercity highway coaches typically have only a front door, have under-floor luggage storage compartments, and are 12 to 13 feet tall.
