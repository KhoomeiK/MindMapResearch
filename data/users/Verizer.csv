But it didn't stop sucking. The MCU is literally 2 movies being remade 12 times each."
KotakuInAction,fepiyt2,t1_fepfl77,1579321709.0,"I honestly don't care, but I recognize that other people do. Especially when it comes to areas their kids would frequent. That's how our culture is, its hardly just my ""prudish tastes"" when so many people share it. The question is how many people care vs those that don't? Honestly, removing profanity bothers less people than not removing it.

As for censoring vs complete removal of the reviews, I agree that's a valid point. Less censorship is better. That means Steam chose the better solution over Epic, but that's not news either, ha!"
KotakuInAction,fep6zrk,t1_felv6o2,1579313546.0,"> In most cases ""professionalism"" is just the style guide determined by corporate suits.

This is pretty much the point. If I'm making an online store with reviews on it, pro or user, I'm not going to want my customer-facing website covered in profanity. Exceptions can be made if the game is already clearly mature rated, since the page itself is likely already covered by an age-check like steam does."

But in all seriousness exclusivity is bad."
KotakuInAction,felmdy5,t1_felfkgs,1579225642.0,Honestly? Swearing in your review shows a lack of professionalism and brings the quality of your work into question. I don't blame them at all for throwing them out.

funny,fei8nqh,t1_fei7pb4,1579132744.0,So? that doesn't change my argument.
funny,fei71lu,t1_fei62kf,1579131714.0,"Sure, because a store is going to keep stocking that many grills when they keep getting stolen that often.

Corporate would send out a loss prevention team long before a store becomes not profitable."
KotakuInAction,fei6kz9,t1_fei14v6,1579131417.0,Well they could have multiple store fronts and serve you the correct one based on location? Websites have been doing that for decades now...
KotakuInAction,fehsvxs,t1_feho8p2,1579123209.0,Swear words being censored out is basically non-news. Practically everyone does that as a matter of course. There are plenty of legitimate complaints about the epic store but this isn't one.
KotakuInAction,febyhxq,t1_fe6sar9,1578964312.0,"That's not what i was talking about. I'm talking about frivolous claims that are clearly only made because most people cant/wont fight back.

 Copyright is abused to hell and back by these people, in most of these cases it seems like the real difference between right/wrong use of copyrighted material is just how good your lawyer is."
KotakuInAction,fe615ch,t1_fe5qque,1578879460.0,"My confusion is this: why target what is essentially the most popular person on Youtube at all? Unless pewdiepie is clearly in the wrong ripping off and/or plagiarizing your product, why would you copystrike him ever? Surely this is bad publicity. This can only be bad for you."
saltierthancrait,fdhizjy,t1_fdhda3x,1578423653.0,"> It was definitely a safe movie as it copied ANH nearly note for note.

But is a reboot-in-all-but-name actually a safe movie for star wars? Anyone who had seen the OT was expecting a continuation of the series. The name alone makes you think that... being that its episode 7 now.

Even then, the way they chose to copy ANH is questionable. Everything about Starkiller Base is just absurd. The way they were handling luke/leia/han's role in the story was bad even before Rian set it all on fire."
