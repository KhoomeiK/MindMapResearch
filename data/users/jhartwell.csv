I was prescribed it to counteract the side effects of antipsychotics and it worked and made me feel almost normal enough to get through the day. Then I stopped taking the antipsychotics but kept getting my adderall prescription filled because it made getting through the day easier and gave me motivation and energy. Then I started taking my adderall at night occasionally so that I could stay up most of the night and play video games. That was fine until I would run out of pills before my next refill and would have a horrible crash.

She was already somewhat anxious and the baby just made it unbearable for her. She bit my son on the face in April. We ended up taking her to a vet that specializes in behavioral issues and got a specialized trainer as well but it just wasn’t enough and she bit my son again. Both bites were warning bites and only left an abrasion but we went to e hospital the first time and that meant that the county animal control had to be notified. 
  
  After the second bite we realized we just were making everybody’s lives miserable with keeping the dog. I didn’t want her to get put down because of her anxiety and us having her in a situation where she felt the need to bite. Giving her up was one of the hardest things I have had to do in my life. We had a strong bond and while my wife and I got her together it was clear she was “my” dog. 
  
  My wife put up posts on various Facebook groups trying to find a new home. We had very strict requirements to be considered such as no other pets, must be living in a house (no apartments/condos as the noise from other units could trigger the dog’s anxiety) and no small children. In the end, we found a woman who ended up driving 4 hours to get to us while renting a car that is big enough to take the dog and all her stuff as well as getting a hotel room the day before the handoff so that we could meet the woman and she could meet our dog. We arranged the pickup so my wife’s cousin would be at our house to give the dog up while my wife and I were at a music class with our son. We had video from our Ring doorbell camera of our dog going with her new owner and the dog seemed happy but watching the video made me break down. I still have moment where I cry because I miss her. We had her since she was 8 weeks old and she is 4 now. In the end it was the right decision. We are able to put our son on the floor and not worry about him getting bit. Our other dog is back to her old self (she is 8 and used to be lively but our other dog got somewhat aggressive with her which changed her temperament).
