Entrepreneur,ffpj88f,t3_euavpc,1580096338.0,"Passion, like motivation, is a fickle mistress. You need the right habits and processes. You need to be on an ever improving auto pilot with established but slightly adjustable principles. Nobody is passionate, in love or motivated every day. They’re not going to be when times are tough so let’s add grit into that special sauce as well. You can argue with my diction but you can understand what I mean."

politicsdebate,ffjim2c,t1_ffjdr7s,1579999043.0,Cuba isn’t a democracy and it’s run by one man. It’s not a good comparative example at all. You have been told already but you keep using it. That makes no sense. If Bernie is president he can’t do whatever he wants. He will have to work with the other party and branches of government. Not to mention the government and political parties of all 50 states. .
