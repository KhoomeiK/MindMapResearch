AskReddit,feobiho,t1_feo0kss,1579297723.0,Actual pain is a hell of a lot less pleasurable.
AskReddit,feob5aa,t1_feo1nl1,1579297666.0,It's a pretty toxic notion to say you're aware of pleasure disparity (which can mean actual pain for women) and then call me toxic for bringing it up.  Oh men.
AskReddit,fenxegb,t1_fenwwto,1579292203.0,"You have no clue what it's like to have shit, often painful sex and no pleasure at all.  Bad sex for women usually means actual pain and sometimes psychological damage."

AskReddit,fenwox4,t1_fenuijy,1579292000.0,"So you did.  Edit - realised you're not who I was asking.  Point is, men orgasm pretty much every time they fuck.  Imagine bad sex and not even getting close to that point."

AskReddit,fenawxx,t1_fen35td,1579280769.0,"Hi, I'd say I feel happy at the moment, but I have no idea how long it will last.  Went through therapy and a month long trip abroad to get to this point, there were a lot of tears in the last six months or so and just general unhappiness before that.  I'd say I'm glad I went through the dark bits in therapy because my head feels a lot lighter now.  And I feel good about myself and my future."

dataisbeautiful,fcv89ay,t1_fcv498g,1577996702.0,If you're only 21 I'd recommend it now rather than doing it years down the line and realising you could have changed things so much earlier!

dataisbeautiful,fcv2bw0,t1_fcupm2d,1577993188.0,"A therapist can't prescribe, only psychiatrists and doctors can (in the UK anyway).  You can choose not to go down the antidepressant route, the only way you can be forced is if you're a danger to yourself or others (sectioned)."
dataisbeautiful,fcv266m,t1_fcuiau9,1577993093.0,"Thing is, you can't suppress things forever and they will surface in other ways, sometimes in much worse ways.  It's always worth going to therapy and have someone talk you through the process of dealing with it.  You're not alone that way and there's much less risk of it fucking your life up further down the line."
dataisbeautiful,fcuxio1,t1_fcurumw,1577990513.0,It can take seeing a few therapists to find the right one for you. Not every therapist is a match and some use different methods.

You're not ready and that's fine but please don't feel pressured into anything, try to keep a conversation going about it to get your side across and absolutely don't do anything you're not comfortable with.  But the most important thing is that your previous experience was traumatizing, possibly abuse, and you might want to look into talking that through with someone."
