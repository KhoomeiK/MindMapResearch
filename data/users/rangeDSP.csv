HistoryMemes,fggh7kv,t1_fggc54g,1580761805.0,"Good point, it is game theory on a global scale. And to extend on that, it doesn't just apply to defensive operations either. American government's perpetual involvement in Middle East is great for US citizens, who enjoys cheap gas and a wealthy economy through having military dominance, at a cost of only a few thousand soldiers over a decade.

My point is around the will of the individual soldier, and for me personally, whether I am willing to die for my country's military strategy. 

It's also not necessarily a good thing to fight for your country, or an ally just because your country has an alliance with them, for example: WWI was started from a [cluster fuck of alliances](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:WWIchartX.svg). Because Austria-Hungary empire invaded Serbia, it meant Serbia's ally, Russia, is at war with Austria-Hungary's ally, Germany, whose now at war with Russian's ally, England, whose now at war with Germany's ally, the Ottoman Empire, whose now at war with England's ally, India. This culminated to some Indian soldier getting sent to Egypt to die fighting the Ottomans."
HistoryMemes,fgg8u5r,t1_fgg8bkh,1580756734.0,"That's why I make the distinction between invasion (war on my homeland), vs a war on the other side of the world.

On some respects I am a hypocrite, as my Chinese grandparents fought against the Japanese in WWII, and if the US had not intervened we'd see the rape of Nanking on a national scale. Though my main argument is that it should be up to the will of the soldier to fight a war on the other side of the planet. I honestly don't blame American soldiers if they don't feel like dying for citizens in a foreign country."
HistoryMemes,fgfz3i5,t1_fgfqtpy,1580750738.0,"Interstellar has a quote about a person's will to survive being strong enough to extend to their children, immediate family, and sometimes their local community. This is similar.

Nationalism allows that love/will to survive extend out to a whole nation, but that's not necessarily the same for everyone. 

I would fight for my country if there's an invasion and my family is threatened, not out of a sense of duty but directly for the love of people I care for. 

If it was an attack on an ally of my country, I will not consider fighting for them even for a second. 

My opinion of duty is that it's a completely made up concept to coerce people into fighting pointless wars with clear political agendas behind them. For example, practically all wars that US got into after WWII are purely for power projection and control of oil."

It's way easier to use an impossible IP, anybody who knows it's impossible knows the reason why they do it. There's no advantage to using real IP addresses and several downsides.

Personal example: I developed demo websites for a large company, all fake information needed to be from a list that their legal team prepared, fake company names (they actually registered and trademarked those names and bought domain names), credit cards need to be 1234-5678-..., phone numbers are all fake (555) numbers, and fake names are picked from a list of employees who gave consent for their names to be used.

europe,fg500zx,t1_fg4d28k,1580514986.0,"No worries, USB-C seems amazing, but underneath the protocols involved has been pretty awfully complicated. Not to mention how thunderbolt v3 will make it even more confusing, consumers will start seeing cables that can work with certain devices and not others, seemingly randomly. 

The main issue they are addressing is e-waste and having to ship a 'charger', i.e. the one between the cable and the wall socket. Have you ever had a phone from early 2000s? It always ship with a charging cable that's attached to the charger, which would need to be replaced everytime the cable breaks, or when you get a different phone. Same problem here, but realistically most companies are already compliant (using USB-A / USB-C wall charger) when it comes to phones.

I am pretty sure the old Macbook chargers (magsafe) is definitely not compliant, same with most laptop chargers. To be honest I think that's the right thing to do, because when you compare proprietary cables vs proprietary charging bricks, the latter uses WAY more materials and require some regulation to kick them into shape. At this point, USB-C port seems to be gaining momentum and will be the next USB-A for the foreseeable future. (funnily enough, in part due to Apple forcing USB-C on all their laptop lines)
