UniversalOrlando,ffa7x6x,t3_es74iq,1579729621.0,"Thanks for all the advice.  I knew that Loews Sapphire wasn’t one of the parks with the express pass.  I did end up calling today and it was “only” $510.05 to upgrade the Loews Royal Pacific for the 3 nights we’re there.  Adding one day of the express pass to our existing reservation would have cost almost that much, and by moving hotels we have the unlimited express for all three park days.  Well worth it.  Though pretty crazy how expensive the express passes are.   The base price they have listed for the express pass is for slower times too.  So they say it adds a value of $129 per day, but the actual cost was going to be $159 per day.  Times three people, that gets expensive!  
Ok, now to do the rest of the planning!  Thanks for the advice on what the actual tickets would be.  We’ll get some good lanyards with secure clear pouches before our trip.
EDIT:  Actually adding one day of express pass would have cost MORE than the upgrade, as with tax it was over $540.  For ONE day, sheesh.  So our upgraded hotel is well worth it, yah."
loveland,ffa2v06,t3_esh1ta,1579726780.0,It is a good idea to get a set of snow chains (actually cables-chains is just what they are still called) to keep in your car.  They are nice to have and can help you out if an unexpected snow storm comes up or you find an area that the roads haven’t been maintained.  You’ll never regret having them in the trunk. They are specific to tire size though.

hermitcrabs,fep7czw,t3_eqa1zu,1579313780.0,Being buried for 3 or 4 months isn't unheard of.  As long as your heat/temp conditions are good and your sand depth is decent don't worry!

Needs seen and removed for biopsy regardless of insurance status. Maybe an office will take payments and/or greatly reduce your cost. Its going to be ok even if it is dysplastic, but you don't want to leave it."

 I was curious about the runaway railway, since its still scheduled to open the first week of March and isn't a 60-day out fp option."
WaltDisneyWorld,feo4dao,t1_feo0eq6,1579295003.0,"Aah, ok that’s good.  I didn’t know if cancelling them, if need be either day of or if we decide to in advance, would still impact our ability to do more.  Thank you!"

Lightbulb,feh1q9g,t3_eozfqg,1579107321.0,Mine has the options when I go though the settings menu. Like where you choose 12 or 24 hr format and so forth. Its been muted since the day I got it. I don't need nagged by my appliances.

loveland,fdw6m27,t3_en4va4,1578755587.0,"Congrats on your new position!!

I think you will find yourself happier with a car.  The Loveland UNC campus is actually right on the bus line with a stop right out front, but in general having a car to be able to explore the area would increase your quality of life. 

My job requires me to have learned the city bus system.  I spend time teaching young adults with special needs and we go on the city buses daily.  It is a really great community of drivers and regulars.  Route 3, the line that stops right at your work, is rather clunky and takes a very long aside to get there, and runs only hourly, stopping there at :21 after the hour. Actually theres a stop across the road at :06 after the hour as well.  It's a little down the road but can help you avoid much of the wait. 

Download the SPOT bussing app and and COLT (City of loveland transit) and you can see the system and see how it all works. A nice option even with a car, in case you have a partner and want to leave a car for them. 

Eshs Market will be your frugal grocery friend.  Its off highway 287 north of walmart and consists of grocery items bought by them by the truckload at discount. You never know what you'll find but their prices are great. They're closed on sundays though. 

I'm not helpful with housing but there is a lot of new apartments in the area near your work.  I've heard the prices are pretty high.  I'll message you a neighborhood link re. my area."

I really wish someone would have done a minor makeover on Austin. His dirty hair makes him seem like a basement dweller but he seems like a great guy.  His style needs updated to reflect his true potential."

Sounds like your doc was certain enough with what they saw that they could reassure you with confidence.  That’s good.  The biopsy results should reflect this."

aww,fcosns0,t1_fcokv3u,1577840470.0,"I think mine was only ""designed"" by a couple fellow mutt cats, one of whom had some sort of ragdoll in his/her past.  Her floppiness and general ragdoll attitude are all that have made me look to repeat the greatness of her in a potential future cat, but by no means would I ever spend breeder kind of $ like that!!   

I fully agree shelter cats are the best, especially older ones.  When I look for my next friends, I will search for a bonded pair of older cats who have found themselves in need of a home together."
