GenderCritical,ffc1qld,t3_esqbjn,1579789335.0,I wonder if he's become infamous enough to be known to the women he'd be incarcerated with? If so I think he's going to have a rude awakening about all things woman...
ThriftStoreHauls,ffan6h2,t3_esj7w7,1579739884.0,That's lovely and the back is so elegant!
GenderCritical,ff9lllk,t1_ff9k4hb,1579715569.0,"I guess I didn't take into account that she's really just voicing her personal feelings. I kind of just reacted to the version in my head of ""all men are evil"" trope that sets off my own personal feelings. So, fair enough, we are all entitled to our own feelings and I shouldn't judge her any more than I want to be judged."
JUSTNOMIL,ff94yq4,t3_es9a1e,1579704956.0,Well that just screams narcissist. I'm sorry you had to go through that. Good for you making the healthy decision to cut her out of your life.
GenderCritical,ff8zsed,t1_ff8iycw,1579701159.0,"That's a broad statement. Many men in my life have not lived up to my expectations or even been toxic, on the other hand my dad and husband are genuinely decent dudes and have never left me alone in need."

exmormon,fen2sxv,t3_epwp59,1579275712.0,"I'm a nevermo so I don't know your personal struggle with this. I do, however think upon what an all knowing creator of the universe would want from us. I imagine being kind, forgiving, and simply seeking to preserve and improve the world we've been gifted. I in no way have the answers to age old philosophical questions, but I'm pretty sure the designer of it all cares not a single speck about your garments. As a matter of fact the idea that underwear would trump importance over your function as his being is ludicrous to me and it makes me sad when I see these examples in many different religions. I'm sorry that you've been put in a position where your love of God is judged by your willingness to wear magic pantaloons."

kratom,fel8ugt,t3_epqp1b,1579216576.0,"I was in a devastating car accident about 7 years ago. I nearly severed my right foot, broken ribs, fractured spine. A year in a wheelchair and another with a walker before regaining my independence. I'm rebuilt with titanium. I'm quite welcome in pain management practices, I simply won't ever walk without pain. I was lucky I didn't fall into a deep addiction. I, however found my tolerance increasing with time, like for everyone. I really thought I was trapped on this road to lifetime dependence on opiates.

I just stumbled on kratom info. I was hugely skeptical, I've never been a fan of herbal or homeopathic treatments and kratom felt like it was the same family. I finally just threw caution to the wind and ordered a small amount. I was floored, this is an absolute game changer for me.
I took it with minimal expectations, I took it with coffee and simply went into the day. Seems like a 40 minute window before I found myself walking across my room and stopping in my tracks. I didn't hurt, I was amazed and I continue to be amazed every single day. My eyes have been opened to the world of non pharmaceutical treatment and I am so grateful."
TinyHouses,fegxn13,t3_ep3b77,1579104815.0,"This checks off so many boxes with me! I can't climb so have to just write off designs that require it. I also was committed to a dining table not a jammed in bar counter, could never figure out how to make that happen in minimal square footage. This home does it perfectly with the compact daily design with a super easy transition to a 4 seater for guests. Thanks for posting this I am super excited!"

MomForAMinute,fdyjy1y,t3_enbpsh,1578780618.0,"I'm going to acknowledge right up front that it's hard to cope with a house full of sick people, especially super little people. However, it sounds like you are doing exactly what you are supposed to do. They've been to the Dr, gotten meds, & are being comforted constantly. As sick as you are darlin you are doing an excellent job for them! It feels like forever right now, but I promise you it will get better. It's a great feeling when everyone is finally on the mend and you all get the best night's sleep in awhile. And by the way, if baby is only comforted by breast then that's what you do, upchucking be darned. Trust yourself."

kratom,fd9dk28,t1_fd9844g,1578231933.0,"I was in a car accident where I almost severed my foot, mass reconstruction required. I'm an easy candidate for narcotics all day long, but my tolerance built higher than I was willing to keep taking. I'm very impressed with the level of pain control with kratom. I'm taking 2 doses of 3g daily. I've found the best results with powder form, I use oblate discs instead of just toss and wash. I'm truly impressed with the results."
kratom,fd69t1a,t3_ek5ifu,1578187711.0,"Just started kratom about 3 weeks ago. I wanted to try it for chronic pain issues. I was amazed at how much it altered my appetite! I've been fat my whole adult life, I overindulge regularly, low activity, etc. I've known intermittent fasting was probably a good option for me, just didn't think I would commit. With kratom I immediately found myself eating fully 1/2 as much and skipping meals without noticing. I had no intention of this being a healthy lifestyle change on top of pain relief, but Wow am I grateful!"
