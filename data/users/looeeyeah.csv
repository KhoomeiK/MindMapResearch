chelseafc,fdqnwsk,t1_fdqn5zx,1578671082.0,I know that. I just think it's unprofessional. Seems like a pointlessly small thing to put on your profile when everyone knows it but could rub some people the wrong way.
chelseafc,fdqlw0d,t1_fdqgjgi,1578669783.0,"That's true, it's a good way to think of it. Seems more honest when you put it that way, which is better for both groups."

soccer,fdh2lw0,t1_fdh2e0u,1578414032.0,He never showed any disrespect against Chelsea whilst he was there. And at that time Fulham/Chelsea is barely a rivalry at all. It's so rare for us to even be in the same league it's hard to feel much about them.

He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”
I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.
The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first, he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.
When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."
