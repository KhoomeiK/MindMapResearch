heroesofthestorm,fgpqeyb,t1_fgoxkg8,1581009988.0,"her versatile talents are so helpful in dealing with melees in a rank where nobody gonna peel

last game for whatever reason I kept finding myself with illidan in the lane and the extra chill duration, the root, the armor ( tho only 1block seems meh maybe I should have taken something else) and the elemental ( I love that it kills people and is controllable even if I die) made it surprisingly easy to deal with him. Its just really important to land that first Q tho.

I wouldnt build her for big plays tbh cuz in that rank you cant rely on others comboing together."
heroesofthestorm,fgpq9kg,t3_ezr84d,1581009906.0,"rexxar

he is tanky ( block talents or even a passive 10 or 15 armor) and made even easier to play by being ranged

and he has a healable pet ( theres a lv20 talent that even heals rexxar too) to tank for the team or murder a squishy

he's got mobility talents, slow and a valuable stun, a sort of iceblockish talent. Hard CC like stuns make a real difference in low ranks, not displacement bullshit ( ie artanis swaps) cuz it can mess up the skillshots of ur own teammates. A flare option too for stealthies.

he can merc early too

you just need a little effort to control the pet cuz ie if you forget about him it may roam into towers and shit ( alt+D to call her back to u). You can use her to scout around for protection while u channel objective or to poke or to steal regen globes in the solo lane. You basically use 2 heroes kinda like chogall.

if you want a build then 1) the misha talent or sometimes flare vs stealthies especially on an arena kind of objective like volskaias so u force them to be unstealthed if they gonna come onto it 4) hunter especially vs enemy mages that might blow u up otherwise Block to make it even easier to bully melees or if ur team has only 1 frontliner 7) probably Misha again 10) Misha 13) Misha W or maybe wildfire against stealthies or 3+ melees 16) feign is the safe option especially if u notice u getting focusesd by then or to counter bullshit like pyroblast. Primal in the same logic as Block. The other one is if u seem to be steamrolling already but it can also help u escape situations and kite enemies 20) probably ultimate. The AA slow can work together with thrill at 16 or the armor if you getting focused hard. Overall its a Misha build and Misha gonna carry you. Some Q talents are good too but I dont take Rexxar talents unless I need to be more durable cuz Misha disappears if u die ( unlike Jaina's water elemental but that one is temporary anyway). Anyway the W is easier to land."
