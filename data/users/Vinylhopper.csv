You should still invest before paying off low-interest debt, though."
college,feg5mfg,t3_eomjwv,1579078029.0,"I study quite a lot, but I take classes online when possible so I have very little actual class time.  This semester I only have 2 M/W classes with a 6 hour break between them, so I use that to ram through the vast majority of my work.  On my weekdays at home I'll spend around 3 hours watching lecture videos for Calc 2 and doing H.W. for it, and then I call it done once I have nothing due the next class day and I've done the readings associated with my next set of IRL lectures unless there's a test or something I need to study for.  


I've had a semester where I was doing schoolwork 9-5 when class time was factored in, but I think I've gotten better at managing my time and, more importantly, actually making progress during study time instead of getting distracted."
college,fdrhmn1,t3_emvs0d,1578684592.0,"C++ shouldn't take too much time, especially if you've already done some programming.  However, Cal 2 and Physics 1 are both really difficult courses that you'll need to set aside a lot of time for.  


With that said, there's usually room to fit in what you love if you manage your time well."

college,fdb0yet,t1_fda8tlq,1578252482.0,"You can take out around $6k in federal loans without any parental consent just by filling out the FAFSA.  


With that said, the sticker price of your university has the potential to put you in a REALLY bad spot if you let it.I'd recommend talking to all of the state schools you could possibly go to and seeing what will transfer.  You're early in your academic career, so you probably will get to keep most of your credits if you find the right school.  


Don't let taking the ""easy route"" of doing nothing lead to you paying off student loans for the next 20 years of your life."

\-Introduce yourself and remind them of what class(es) they know you from.  Small talk for a second  
\-Ask nicely.  Let them take the lead as to if they want you to write up a draft or if they want to do it all  
\-Thank them from their time and follow up with anything they asked you to do during the meeting"
