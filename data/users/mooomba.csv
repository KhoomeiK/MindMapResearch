whatcarshouldIbuy,ffe9gjz,t3_et4ztr,1579840378.0,"With cars that hold their value really well it makes sense to just buy a new one. Common example, 2019 wrx with 19k miles for 28k. Brand new one for maybe 30k.  I'd buy the new one no question"
whatcarshouldIbuy,ffe8xh4,t3_et4mmb,1579839942.0,"The biggest red flag is the car itself. I wouldn't buy a jeep, or any Chrysler product other than rams. They are unreliable, cheap, and dont hold their value"
whatcarshouldIbuy,ffe8gfd,t1_ffd33pi,1579839554.0,"Bmw isnt any less reliable than the other german or even some american makes. I know reddit hates them but I drove a 2006 3 series for 6 years and it was a tank.  The car is over engineered to hell, it's all the modules and bullshit features that will getcha. Never worried about the actual drivetrain"
whatcarshouldIbuy,ffe81po,t1_ffe47o9,1579839222.0,People are being pretty dramatic. I work on Subarus and they are pretty reliable overall. A subaru will be more reliable than pretty much any american make. Go for it
personalfinance,ff8dgji,t1_ff7y88b,1579673919.0,Yes the bank tellers can see how much money you have while performing transactions if that's what you're getting at
personalfinance,feyysj9,t3_eqtk6v,1579452159.0,Cancel any kind of bull shit warranty or service plan they sold you. This is the dealership's biggest cash grab. Should be prorated and get most of that money back (off the loan amount).  Also unless you have bad credit 6% is too high it would be worth it to refinance
personalfinance,feyya5d,t3_eqy3v4,1579451946.0,When I was saving for a house in my early 20s I opened a Roth IRA and contributed about 500 a month to it until I had about 20k contributed. You can take what you put in back out tax and penalty free especially for a house purchase. Then all that was left was free money (the interest I made while saving). But if you touch that interest you have to pay taxes on it
personalfinance,feyxqre,t3_eqxe5r,1579451734.0,"You need to take it to a real shop for diagnosis, not a tire shop by a guy making a dollar above minimum wage. Sure older subaru's have their quirks like head gaskets but all in all they are pretty reliable cars. It's probably something cheap and simple like an ignition coil...."
Justrolledintotheshop,feysxcx,t1_feyiyib,1579450217.0,"I agree, you can just tell this is one of the worst drivers on the road. Like some merge on the free way at 45 mph type of shit"
personalfinance,fe56oun,t3_ens5ni,1578866091.0,I agree spend about 4 or 5k on a new car and still have your independence. Lots of clean used cars in that price range. Save the other 5k+
IdiotsInCars,fdysiof,t1_fdxk8jr,1578783132.0,"Doubtful its because of engine power in regards to a Camry. Insurance is all about statistics. Location, average claims for that model, driver age and record, etc. All account for him having higher premiums"
personalfinance,fdwrl76,t3_en8ys5,1578761673.0,What kind of car are you looking at?
Portland,fdo3xf6,t1_fdnrtc4,1578598444.0,Everyone wants to be given shit but no one wants to work for it
todayilearned,fdmg8qq,t1_fdmd67o,1578548866.0,"I dont believe this. I had this question about the Voyager space probes, which are expected to roam the universe for millions possibly billions of years, and the risk of collision with anything is apparently extremely slim. Space is real fuckin big"
YouShouldKnow,fdlwmun,t1_fdlpfhi,1578534267.0,Speed up and pull the trailer brake if applicable. üëç
AskReddit,fdik4i6,t1_fdih49h,1578444696.0,"For real. I find myself holding views on both sides of the spectrum. But this site is nothing but extreme liberals who will act like you killed a puppy if you aren't anything but as extreme on the left. Makes me want nothing to do with whatever ideas they have. I think that if anything it's way more damaging to their cause, it makes people like me who could be swayed either way think ""wow these people are nuts"" and want nothing to do with what they are preaching"
Whatcouldgowrong,fdapg49,t1_fdaofty,1578248688.0,There is nothing to be gained in this world without putting your own effort and hard work forward. Renters wont lose but wont gain anything either. You are just paying off someone else's mortgage so they can be sipping mai tais on a beach in retirement. The average renter will be in an 800 sq ft apartment living it up off of social security fixed income
Whatcouldgowrong,fdangor,t1_fdaj6qs,1578247995.0,If I stop paying my mortgage I lose my house and the 70k I put for the down payment. If I stop paying rent I just lose my house...
Whatcouldgowrong,fdahqlm,t1_fdagbiw,1578246203.0,"It doesn't make you better or more important, but it does mean you have a lot more to lose that's for damn sure"
Justrolledintotheshop,fcosji1,t1_fcos02w,1577840383.0,If he can actually afford it fuck it. Why do people buy sports cars? Or motorcycles? We dont need em but they are cool as fuck to have. I dont need a shinny new f250...but fuck I'd love to have one
highmileclub,fcn3qv5,t3_ehykag,1577802444.0,This is impressive for a german car or a chevy cobalt or something. This is not impressive but expected of a toyota
MorbidReality,fcgkz7f,t1_fcgiufw,1577641287.0,What a fucking waste. Call me inhumane or whatever but I'll say it. If the dude wanted to die that bad and still does why are we gonna force him to suffer for who knows how long. And also he's going to need constant care which is $ and drained emotions on the families part. Fucking a
todayilearned,fc7ocit,t1_fc5szcn,1577514225.0,Good luck with that
todayilearned,fc7o8ya,t1_fc5sspp,1577514150.0,Reddit is full of techy nerds who know fuck all about cars.
personalfinance,fc0uxiq,t1_fbyeisr,1577300285.0,"Dude makes killer money with no debt or monthly liabilities. He/she is crazy young WHY WOULDNT THEY BUY PROPERTY?! When you rent you are still paying for the taxes and maintenance, it comes out of your damn rent. Your arguments are dumb, this person is a picture perfect candidate to buy a house"
