childfree,fflnly8,t1_ffkne9c,1580041847.0,Nope! I haven't had a single issue. I'm so happy that I did it! It honestly saved my life and was the best decision I've ever made.
childfree,ffk7ruk,t3_eu2njv,1580018358.0,"Someone said that to me this summer while I was doing my internship and working my full time job. I worked 6 full shifts and one double shift a week between the two, so I was working every single day without a day off for four months. My internship was an hour and a half away from my home and involved me dealing with wild animals. There was almost blood."
childfree,ffk4hgj,t1_ffk3y74,1580015567.0,Yes! I had one when I was 20. I'm almost 30 now. I kept my ovaries and cervix. Maybe it was because I was young when I had it but it wasn't a huge thing. I was back at work in less than a week and fully recovered in about six weeks. They do everything laparoscopicly now so I had just 5 little scars that are barely even visible now.
childfree,ffk3u2y,t3_eu28p5,1580014974.0,Same. I don't think there's anything wrong with me but I'm 90% I was a cat in my old life. I love to nap. I have a young puppy and he's just a doll but I can't wait for him to start enjoying that nap life too. There's no way I could keep up with a baby. Only getting 3 hours of spotty sleep? I'd be a serial killer by Monday.

childfree,ffk3da1,t3_eu1ghi,1580014557.0,"I guess I never really had ""The Conversation"" with my parents. From a young age I've said I didn't like kids. I've never been super close with my dad so I never really talked to him about it. I had horrible medical problems from the time I started my period and basically when I learned what a hysterectomy was I decided I wanted that. My mom only asked about having one the day before my surgery. I remember we were in the car and I told her I needed to go to bed early to be at the hospital the next morning. After some silence she asked if I was sure. I just looked at her and said ""Mom I'm dying."" And that was the end of that."
childfree,ffk2x9m,t3_eu1v7p,1580014162.0,"I'll be honest I've never gotten the point of an ablation. My doctor and my mom's doctor both said the success rate wasn't absolutely amazing. If you are having medical problems and want your period to stop, have you thought about just getting a partial hysterectomy? They would just remove the uterus and leave your ovaries. No more periods, and since you keep your ovaries, you don't have any hormonal issues."

lincoln,ffh9kge,t1_ffgz8w0,1579927074.0,I second Dr. Maly. He did my hysterectomy when I was 20. He's a stand up guy. Not super impressed with the rest of his office though. Some of his nurse practitioners are straight up horrible people. So make sure you make your appointment with Dr. Maly himself.
dogs,ffh8xhe,t1_ffh10s1,1579926513.0,"I agree with this. Being upfront about the issues that you see are really, really important. But an animal in a shelter is probably different than in a home. Our cat was labeled as ""really timid"" when she was in the shelter. She is not. We got her home and in a few weeks she became the sassiest, thirstiest animal on this planet. It was ridiculous."
dogs,ffh7f4s,t1_ffgevns,1579925226.0,The only thing I would say about rough collies is that not all of them are very cuddly. Mine certainly isn't. They tend to be very polite about their love for you.
dogs,ffh5wor,t3_eti48j,1579923991.0,"There is still a lot of push back on muzzles, yes. I've been thinking of muzzle training my puppy because I'd like people to give us some space while I'm training. I mentioned the idea to a couple friends when they've asked how it's going and everyone's acted horrified. Like ""why is he aggressive?"" or ""That's so mean to do to a dog."" Honestly to me it's just another tool like a harness or a leash. They need to get used to it, but if you go slow, they learn to like it like everything else. We plan on adopting a retired greyhound sometime in the future and I know I'll need one for him/her too. I don't think it's cruel and it doesn't hurt the dog if fitted and used properly."
childfree,ffh4ok2,t3_ethqn6,1579923029.0,That's so cute! I like that! I thought about getting a tattoo along with my hysterectomy scars but honestly they are so faded now that I'm glad I didn't.

Have SOME consideration."
dogs,ffg6gjw,t1_ffg1rr4,1579899479.0,"Right? I have a deterrent spay for dogs that I bought because we just kept having dogs jump us while we were walking. It's not like I'm looking forward to pepper spraying someone's dog but I just have a feeling that I'm going to get yelled at the first time I have to spray someone's ""friendly"" dog because it won't leave us alone on a walk."
dogs,ffg5719,t1_fffpsdq,1579898704.0,I live in a town surrounded by a lot of rural areas and it's a huge problem where I live. Just a lot of really old school people who lived in what was a rural area before the town grew and think they can still just let their dogs run free at all times.
puppy101,fffak01,t3_esvpmv,1579879703.0,"Haha that was our puppy! He learns things really quickly but he is a loud mouth during class. For his size he has a really deep bark and he uses it constantly and tugs and lunges at everyone and everything. At home he's good as gold but he just hasn't learned to control his little self in public yet. I took him to a private trainer and she laughed and said he would fit perfectly in her adolescent class because they all barked and did that. Some puppies just hit that stage before others do I guess.

Try not to get frustrated. I know, easier said than done. But if you're frustrated, your puppy is going to sense that and make things more difficult."
puppy101,fff8k0g,t3_etalbo,1579878389.0,"I play ""go find it"" with my puppy a lot. I sit on one side of the room and throw his kibble across the room and tell him to go find it. When he goes, we work on things like leave it or recall as he comes back, and also his basics like sit and stay. It's a work out and training in one!"
puppy101,fff85av,t3_etahv2,1579878105.0,What a gorgeous dog! The trainer we are working with told me that taking your dog out on a long line in a wooded area was great for building confidence because it allows them to explore and that confidence could spill over into other areas too. I actually do think it helped! Since I started doing that he's been a lot better on his normal leash.

If your kid is pitching a fit and you're not doing anything to fix the problem, you're kind of an asshole. Being out in public means having SOME sort of respect and awareness for the people around you. 

And I scrolled down through her comments and she was saying that she takes her kids to breweries because it's fun for them. That's where I draw the line.

childfree,ff1rvhz,t3_er5bft,1579484800.0,I had extremely awful periods that started when I was 9 and at age 20 I had a partial supra-cervical hysterectomy.

I think I was fully recovered in about 6 weeks but I was back to work part time less than a week after. I haven't had any issues that this was like ten years ago? Compared to my periods it was a cake walk. Of course I had to threaten to do it myself in my bathtub to get someone to do it.

puppy101,fevqs2g,t3_eqq7fw,1579400392.0,"We have this problem too. My little boy loves people and will leap all over them if given the chance. We went to a professional trainer who specialized in reactivity and these were her tips -
1) Don't let him say hi to anyone on your walks. That's just giving him what he wants.
2) When you see people or other animals coming, only let him go up close enough to where he sees them but doesn't react, but the second he does, U-turn and go the other direction.
3) Try the U-turn thing in the back of a parking lot of a pet friendly store. Park in the back and start walking towards the store, but when he sees other people and starts to react, turn around. 

I've also seen on here where people take their dog to the park and sit on a bench and reward their dog when he looks at people calmly. We haven't had a lot of luck with that because of how our local parks are set up.

Good luck! I'm hoping my guy becomes more aloof when he gets older."

puppy101,feo51jl,t1_feo40gb,1579295214.0,Oh same. It also doesn't help that my dog is pretty tall for his age so I think people don't realize he's so young so they expect him to act more like an adult dog. Like no he's like 4 and a half months old he's seriously just a baby.

The guy got crazy insistent that I get him around other dogs right away or there would be problems. Like he was SO borderline aggressive about it. Come to find out it's probably because his dog gets out all the freaking time and rushes us on our walks. I think he was worried that my dog would attack his dog that he can't be bothered to try to keep contained.   


I also just stopped doing classes with a trainer. She was insistent that you don't sit on the floor with your dog and your dog shouldn't be allowed on your furniture because they won't respect you. I know that's sort of popular advice from some but it just seemed very old school."

He'll occasionally nip my hand on accident if we're playing and he goes for the toy too aggressively. I've been pretty lucky with that aspect. I can tell he's uncomfortable, but we've just been freezing some of his toys and he gets two cubes of frozen chicken stock a day.

But yeah that's been my struggle. He's hardly ever calm enough to capture it. He will sometimes get working on his bone and will lay there for a bit and I always praise and capture that. But on the plus side he's gotten to the point where he can pretty much entertain himself for a bit if I need to be doing something and he isn't usually destructive about it."
puppy101,fekszq1,t3_epp1tv,1579206976.0,"I think it's pretty normal. My puppy (almost 5 months) has no chill and will not nap on his own, even when we gets lots of physical and mental stimulation. We have done the capturing calmness thing from Kikopup, but he still just doesn't know how to calm himself down. I don't really worry about it. He will nap for a bit when we do enforced naps and I know he sleeps through the night. I just watch for when I can tell he's beyond overstimulated and figure it's time for a nap."

He has really shaped the way I left my dog interact with other dogs, even though I'm not really the type to just let my dog run up to another dog anyway. My puppy is reactive on his leash as well, but not in a fear aggressive way but in a I'M SO EXCITED LET ME TOUCH YOU kind of way. Normally when I see another dog, heck another person if the day is off, I turn and go another way. It doesn't matter how I control my dog, I don't want to take the chance that their dog could get over-excited because mine is over-excited. I know some people think it's cute, but I really don't."

puppy101,fekni2m,t3_epnfny,1579203728.0,Poor guy! I would definitely ask your vet about giving him some probiotics with his food. That could help protect his stomach and digestive system in the long run if Trazodone is hard on his stomach.

On the collar grabbing - I wasn't sure what her purpose was. She said you wanted to grab their collar so that they knew they needed to sit down. She had taught us a pressure technique to kind of pinch an area on the dog's hip area that was supposed to make them sit down immediately so if you grabbed their collar, they knew to sit before you made them sit.

dogs,feevuoc,t1_feeu1rt,1579042319.0,I think it's the same way when people start having kids. I mean I know it's not the same but people should ask if they can bring their kids over to other people's houses and everyone always has the right to say no. Our house is not toddler/baby proof AT ALL and none of our animals are used to kids so I always ask people not to bring their kids to our house. It's just common courtesy and it's just what you prefer in your own home. Hell you should be able to request an adult not being in your home because they do something to sketch you out.

dogs,feeqccy,t3_eonht3,1579038974.0,"Honestly I get where you're coming from. In my friend group a couple of people have dogs and for the most part I'm cool with people bringing their dogs over to my house because their dogs are reasonably well behaved and house trained. However, I have one friend with two dogs that I really don't want in my home. One of them is dog aggressive but she still insists on bringing it everywhere (even when there will be other dogs) and it's just kind of miserable. My BFF has to like sneak her dogs out the back to go to the bathroom when she brings this dog over. She also has a puppy that she doesn't train and she just lets him wander her house and be destructive and doesn't watch it closely enough for him to really get him potty trained. So... Yeah oddly enough I don't want either of them around my young puppy because I don't want him to have an aggressive dog encounter or pick up any cute tricks from this other dog. In my mind it's not really about judging how other people train their dog, it's more about not wanting dogs with undesirable behaviors in your home. I mean, I don't bring my dog to my friends' homes yet because he is young and can be a little butt when he wants to. I think it's a self-awareness thing."
dogs,fee990l,t1_fee3syq,1579029025.0,"I don't think your dog did anything wrong. By your admission, he's a little leash reactive, and that's something you can work on, but someone walking towards you yelling is really aggressive whether it's ""physical"" or not.

She said most dogs go through that phase and everyone in her adolescence class is a loud mouth too so don't even worry about it. When you're out walking on a leash, I just don't let my guy say Hi to anyone, so he's really slowly learning that he needs to ignore people. We're doing baby steps, but it's getting better! No worries!"
dogs,fedodj2,t1_fednb6d,1579016363.0,Yep absolutely this. I would tell them you just wanted the incident on file because this woman made you uncomfortable and you're afraid she will escalate.
dogs,fedjofq,t3_eolzu3,1579013224.0,"Honestly I would file a police report in case this escalates. Or you don't even have to file a report, just call the police and explain what happened, that your neighbor stalked your dog walker and you through your neighborhood, and was coming at and threatening you. They probably won't do anything, but at least it's on file."
dogs,fedjelz,t3_eolzur,1579013034.0,Could you maybe break his dinner up in two parts and give him one part when you get home and one part a little later in the evening? Maybe the Meloxicam is causing some stomach upset and then going a long period of time without food isn't helping.
relationships,feckii0,t3_eodwzv,1578976143.0,"Night terrors! I have these sometimes when I'm really stressed out from work. Or when I have a medication backfire. Don't tell her that she's re-enacting the Exorcist in her sleep, you'll freak her out even more. Just sit her down and tell her she's seemed really stressed about her exams and ask if she'll take a day off and you guys go do something fun together to relax."
childfree,fec4oco,t3_enzm8x,1578966600.0,"I had a hysterectomy when I was 20. It was mostly for medical reasons but I really, really pushed for it because I didn't want kids. My parents took me to the hospital to have the procedure. I remember the whole day my dad seemed kind of dazed. I don't think he really thought I was that serious about having it done. My mom was having a ball. She really thinks people high on medication are hilarious (they are!) and she was joking and laughing with me and the doctors when I woke up."
dogs,febzwub,t1_febzlte,1578964734.0,We could all get together and walk our dogs on a freaking leash! LoL. I think what irritates me the most is we have at least 4 off leash dog parks in different parts of the city with easy access. I know people have issues with dog parks too but it's like just go during off times dude. We have one that's so big that you could probably not see another dog if you really didn't want to.
puppy101,febypte,t3_eobgw1,1578964394.0,"I will tell my guy to sit and stay outside the bathroom door because I already have one animal that follows me to help me pee. He will stay until the door closes. They I hear him running off all over the house (I can hear you, sir, we have wood floors), but the second he hears the water running he will come flying back and will be sitting by the time I open the door back up. Like wow good job you pulled it over on me."
puppy101,febxx6v,t1_febxkmu,1578964072.0,It's basically turning something off and turning it back on again. But for living things.
dogs,febxrdq,t3_eo5ud3,1578964005.0,"God I feel this. I'm positive my young dog is going to end up reactive despite a lot of training and counter-conditioning because we have so many irresponsible owners where I live. Our city has a beautiful trail system that I don't use because every single time I do, my guy gets jumped by off leash dogs. I've had to alter my walking route through our neighborhood. It's annoying. 

And the thing is I don't mind the idea of off leash dogs - but you and your dog need to fit a certain criteria. Your dog needs to be trained off leash very, very well. You need to be able to call your dog back no matter what, and your dog should be able to walk by and ignore other dogs. I'm so sick of having a snarling dog run full force towards my dog while an owner yells that he's friendly from 50 feet back. Like my dude... And calling AC doesn't do a lot. Nothing wrong with them but they are just stretched too thin."
dogs,febnn5p,t3_eoavj1,1578960751.0,"My ex did this. He got a puppy, then had a kid. Then got another dog somewhere, then had another kid, then both the dogs went, and then got another dog. I wish there was a registry for people like this so they can't just keep getting and throwing away dogs. And the dog he picked up was a stray pit bull mix. Nothing wrong with pit bulls in my opinion, just seemed an odd choice for someone with two young kids not knowing it's background."
dogs,febmma3,t1_fe61yvd,1578960460.0,"That's sort of the issue we have where they are building a larger indoor one the next town over. They are building it out further in the suburbs in a nicer area where people are willing to pay for the luxury of going to one, but it's also an area where most people have a larger fenced yard so they might not take their dog to something they have to pay for. It's more needed in the mid-town/downtown areas where space is limited, but then you probably don't have as many people willing to pay."
dogs,febktup,t1_feavzr3,1578959875.0,I love the bar one that's closer to my friend's house. It's like a three hour drive so it's not something we can do a lot but they seriously have everything figured out. They have really strict rules for small kids and it's staffed and they always have awesome events going on.
puppy101,feal8cw,t1_feajw7j,1578950012.0,"Yep. If they are really being trying, enforced nap time for them. Glass of wine and enforced nap for yourself."
puppy101,feakohm,t3_eo87iw,1578949932.0,"I bought one, but it just became an overpriced chew toy. But I did start putting the beating heart on top of his crate and it helped a lot instead of having it in the crate with him. So I would actually recommend just getting the replacement heart and putting it on top of his crate or somewhere next to it instead. It would be a lot cheaper."
puppy101,fe8l67m,t3_eo1y1o,1578927416.0,"Ugh I have a ""friend"" like this to. She has two dogs, one a puppy and one is completely dog aggressive. She did some at home training with them but gave up when things didn't work and constantly tells me I'm too strict and that I shouldn't be crating my young puppy when I'm gone. She also constantly posts on social media that he puppy has destroyed or eaten something."
childfree,fe6aa9o,t3_enwgnc,1578885321.0,"I have a dog and a cat. I love them both equally. My dog is a puppy so he needs some extra attention, but he is an independent little guy. My cat is the thirstiest animal on this planet. She wants attention all the time and will legit follow you around the house and cry until you pick her up and hold her like a baby. Plus she has a laundry list of medical issues. But I still just love her. LoL"
puppy101,fe68v7r,t3_entnca,1578884338.0,This is what I do. My guy cannot self settle at all yet (we're working on it!) but he will get so worked up that he won't listen and is a little demon. So in the crate he goes for a little nap for an hour or two.
puppy101,fe68p04,t3_enqwcq,1578884227.0,"This is so extra but I bought my dog a ball pit. I toss some treats at the bottom and then put the balls on top of it and let him go to town. I also play ""go find it"" when I'm being lazy. I throw a treat across the room and tell him to go find it. When he comes back, I make him run through his training commands and then treat him again. He loves it for some reason. You could also work on things like ""place"" and ""touch"" which can be used for other more complicated tricks. There are also a couple trainers that do ""online"" training that maybe you could find."
puppy101,fe67oxe,t3_ennd5a,1578883631.0,"So we are a classic case of resistant giardia. My guy is on round three of treatment, but after round two he had no symptoms, so after this, we might just give his stomach a break and treat his symptoms and he just becomes one of those dogs that lives with it. But on the plus side, he doesn't feel bad, he is becoming a champ at taking baths, and because we've been mopping with healthcare bleach, I think we can perform surgery on our floor! It sucks but honestly it could be so much worse. He is becoming a little chunky because he won't stand still to get his butt washed without food in front of him, so we're adjusting his food a bit. Poor guy! He'll think he is starving!"
childfree,fe66zdn,t3_enrp35,1578883193.0,"Honestly I think that there are a lot of work places that could be better at being flexible and supportive for all their employees, whether they have a family or not. And it's not like I hate pregnant women or anything. But, I do hate picking up the slack for coworkers who made the choice to get pregnant. It kind of sucks. Especially because I feel like if I had to have someone pick up my slack, the same pregnant woman that I covered for would say they couldn't because they have a kid and need to get home. And I'm being paid the same to do the work of two people. I just don't think it's fair."
childfree,fe66idc,t1_fe5aj31,1578882889.0,And my puppy normally eats his own vomit before I can even get over there to clean it up.
childfree,fe663t9,t3_enugxr,1578882629.0,"I'm kind of a hermit with a tiny friend group. My best friend of 15 years is child free, and my couple other close friends are child free as well, so that's not really a problem. I've had a couple other friends have kids but since I only saw them once a year it wasn't a huge deal. I do have a friend right now who is pregnant and I can kind of see it being a problem. She has literally no boundaries and I can see her being one of those parents that brings her kid everywhere. She has a dog aggressive dog that she brings over to my friends house and my friend has to keep her dog inside when she's there. I'm slowly working on ghosting her. Not just for the kid thing but that was a big part of it."
dogs,fe63ch6,t1_fe60uwg,1578880855.0,"That's pretty normal. He's just a baby! He's going to be a little scared when he's alone. He'll get used it it! My guy's been home about three months now and he did that when we first brought him home but he settled down pretty quickly. Check out some youtube videos from Zak George and Kikopup to work on getting him settled. Also, remember it's for his safety. If you leave a puppy alone while you're gone, he is going to get into a lot of stuff that you really don't want him to."
dogs,fe60ln4,t3_enwr3i,1578879112.0,"I brought my puppy home at 8 weeks and I work a 8-5. I got him on a Friday so I could get him settled for the weekend and then I worked half days for four days and then went back to my normal schedule. I come home once a day for about half an hour and let him out, walk him, feed him lunch and all that. He still loves me. Plenty of people work that schedule and manage to have dogs. There's a small group of people who think you shouldn't have a dog unless someone is home 24/7, but that's not really how the world works."
dogs,fe60bku,t3_enwxj0,1578878933.0,"We have two that are opening up this year about an hour from me and there's one that's already open that I haven't been to yet. Two of them are bars, one has coffee, and one has an indoor/outdoor area. I think it's a really good idea, especially in areas where the weather is bad a significant part of the year. I don't know why there aren't more. I think they're a good idea. Maybe the zoning laws and regulations on something like that are difficult?"
dogs,fe4ju6x,t3_enpwf5,1578860096.0,"A rough or smooth coat collie might be good for you. But if you don't want a lot of upkeep and you live in the heat, I'd lean towards a smooth coat. The only two things they might not match on: They can be vocal, but some are more vocal than others. Mine doesn't bark that much and only when he's really excited. They also run between cuddly and not. I know some people who can't keep their dogs off them, but others prefer to be near you and not on top of you. Mine has his days where he needs to be on top of me, but for the most part he is polite about needing attention. But otherwise he can keep op outdoors (as much as he is able, he's young) and he is definitely more calm inside."

childfree,fe04val,t1_fe04i5n,1578803130.0,"Bonus, the dog park bars are staffed so even if people are being idiots, safety is still priority number one!

But yeah, you need to know your dog. As I've said, my dog is a little much right now but he's a puppy, I don't expect a lot from him. I've taken him to a brewery once just as part of getting him out and about, but we went off hours, we sat outside on a slightly chilly night, and we sat away from people and brought something to occupy him, and only stayed for one beer. He did okay but I wouldn't do it again until he's a little older and more relaxed. I like going to get a beer and relaxing! I absolutely adore dogs but I don't want to have a crazy one barking in the background."
