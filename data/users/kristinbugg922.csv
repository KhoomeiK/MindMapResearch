It is alleged that Buchanan, while “under the influence of alcohol,” had told her husband that she would only put her shirt back on if he showed her his penis.

Asked her husband to take his penis out and show it to her in front of his three children.

Did not consider that her actions might make those children feel uncomfortable, embarrassed or that the youngest child may not understand whatever “lesson” she may or may not have been attempting to teach them.

But the children’s feelings don’t factor into this, do they? It doesn’t matter if *they* felt uncomfortable, embarrassed or confused about this, because this woman’s right to walk around topless supersedes their right to feel comfortable in the home they share with father & stepmother. As long as this woman’s right to “free the nipple” is preserved, these children should just deal with their own feelings silently, right.

But, how would you feel if Tilli Buchanan isn’t even a proponent of the “Free The Nipple” cause? That she wasn’t concerned about this issue until she was charged with this and until it benefitted her for her criminal case to be used as an example for protesters. That she suddenly became a feminist *after* being charged for this incident. That the details suddenly changed from, “Intoxicated, topless woman tells father to show her his penis in front of his children,” to “This Utah woman was charged for being topless in her own home.

1. These are not European children and they have not been raised by European norms.

2. Let’s not pretend this woman had “a drink”. The deputy that arrested her stated she was drunk/intoxicated.

I think with Hernandez, the connection with CTE is vital because his father was known to be physically abusive and there’s no telling how many concussions and head injuries the Hernandez brothers suffered due to his abuse even before they began playing football. That brings to mind another point. DJ Hernandez was also a victim of Dennis Hernandez’s abuse and he played football at the junior high, high school and college levels. I would be curious to know what the state of his behavioral health, impulse control and overall mental health is.

This isn’t related to Hernandez and the documentary, except peripherally. Dennis Hernandez was known to be friends with law enforcement. That made me go down a rabbit hole, of sorts, about considering a connection between CTE and law enforcement. We know there is a higher correlation between DV and law enforcement. We also know, at least in America, that our officers have a higher incident of being violent. In America, a large majority of our officers seem to have something in common: They have served in the military, have played contact sports at some point in their lives or have been involved in physical activities that may have caused them to sustain head injuries involving repeated concussions. Then, after becoming officers, they may sustain concussions and head injuries. CTE can only be diagnosed *after* death, when the brain is dissected, so there is no way to tell if a person is afflicted with it. These are just my personal thoughts and in no way am I stating any of this is factual."

insanepeoplefacebook,fewkpq9,t1_fewem56,1579412866.0,"Trump is also the epitome of the stereotype that is applied to African American people, men in particular:

1) Children by several women.

2) Sexually promiscuous. 

3) Sexist, degrading view & treatment of women. Nobody: Grabbing women by the pussy.

4) Extremely materialistic. Entertained & distracted by flashy/gaudy/shiny things. Like gold plated penthouses. Or trying to buy Greenland.

5) Prioritizes immediate & self gratification. Has tantrums when they don’t get what they want. They may call NFL players and their mothers “sons of bitches” if they don’t stand for the anthem.

6) Extremely immature & indecisive. What they want conflicts with what they need. If their desires conflict with the greater good of everyone else, their desires will still win and they will not understand why the greater good is more important. What they want changes from hour to hour and day to day.

7) Cannot be trusted to make responsible decisions     based on logic and reason. If they want to buy a car for $25,000 and only have $2,500, it is perfectly reasonable to steal $30,000 from their dear Granny Sophie to buy the car. Just as it’s completely logical to form a Space Force when people in America are dying because of lack of proper medical care with treatable illnesses.

8) Must have someone available to supervise and manage daily tasks and general social, home and work environment. They need someone to tell them they can’t call into work for the third day in a row because they stayed up all night playing xBox when they need to be at work at 8 AM. Or someone to tell them it’s not a stellar idea to launch paper towel rolls at hurricane survivors who have just lost everything they have. Or that Dayton and Toledo are, in fact, two different cities."
TrueCrimeDiscussion,fewhcz6,t3_eqqc3o,1579410599.0,"I posted this on another post:


I noticed they discussed CTE in the documentary as a factor. I do agree it is a factor, but Hernandez had issues that began far before he began playing football. In prison phone calls, he upbraids his mother for not getting him proper treatment for his Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, for not attempting to understand him as a child and hints that he attempted to come out to her as a young teen, but that she discouraged that. During one disturbing phone call, he states he would “beat the shit,” out of her if she was in front of him.

He struggled with his sexuality and gender role as a child. He wanted to be on a football field....but not as a football player. He wanted to be a cheerleader, but his father wouldn’t “put up with that faggot shit.”  Hernandez was experimenting sexually with at least one other boy as early as middle school. With his father’s obvious attitude toward homosexuality, and the overall Hispanic/Latino attitude toward male homosexuality in particular, it is obvious Hernandez felt he needed to stay closeted. Combine that with the macho football culture and you have the perfect storm. It’s incredibly telling that he committed suicide two days after his possible outing was revealed by Michele McPhee on that radio show. I think CTE was a mitigating factor, but only served to exacerbate Hernandez’s undiagnosed behavioral and mental health diagnoses/issues.

I think the most tragic part of Aaron Hernandez’s story was that he was never able to speak his own truth about his sexuality. The world heard Dan SanSoucie detail their sexual relationship that began in middle school and lasted into high school. The world heard that he murdered Odin Lloyd because Lloyd was allegedly going to reveal that he was gay. The world heard Kyle Kennedy’s attorney confirm the third letter he left was for Kennedy and that Kennedy was his “prison boyfriend”. The world heard the prison phone call where he said he was “attracted to men and it makes me mad all the time.” But Aaron Hernandez was never able to stand up and speak, in his own time and his own words, his truth about his own sexuality. He was never able to say, without shame, anger or humiliation, that he was attracted to men and that he was a gay man. Maybe if he’d been able to go to his father and say, “Dad, I want to be a cheerleader,” and his father had been able to find it within himself to say, “Son, that’s great. Where can we sign you up,” maybe Aaron Hernandez’s life may have taken a different course. Maybe if Aaron Hernandez had been able to sit down with his mother and say, “Mom, I feel confused. I am attracted to other boys. What does this mean for me? Is there something wrong with me,” and his mother had said, “No, Aaron, there is nothing wrong with you. Some boys like other boys, the way some boys like girls. This can be confusing. We can figure this out together,” maybe Aaron Hernandez wouldn’t have annihilated three lives and then obliterated his own. We’ll never know though. Because Aaron Hernandez was failed and in return, he failed his own child.

EDIT: u/dzl1717 brought this to my attention:

“Note he may have also preferred to have identified as bisexual/pansexual (versus gay/homosexual). I think I read somewhere that men who identify as bisexual have even higher incidences of mental health issues than men who identify as just gay or straight.

Eminem,feo9sx4,t1_fempos1,1579297116.0,"Yes, they can. How? They exploit loopholes and the absolute non-oversight, lack of follow-through and utter carelessness in federal and state laws:

Devin Patrick Kelley purchased firearms he should have been prohibited from legally purchasing, due to a domestic violence conviction in a court-martial while he was in the Air Force. However, the Air Force failed to enter the conviction into the FBI’s NCIC database. Kelley used the firearms he purchased to commit the Sunderland Springs Church shootings, in which 27 people were murdered.

Seth Ator failed the federal background check when he attempted to purchase a firearm. The reason he failed the background check was due to a prior court determination that he was mentally unfit. After failing the federal background check, he subsequently purchased an AR-15 from a private seller. Ator used that gun to murder 7 people.

Dylann Roof had been arrested on drug charges weeks prior to purchasing firearms, which should have barred him from passing federal background checks to purchase firearms. The FBI examiner reviewing the sale never saw the arrest report because the wrong agency was listed in state criminal history records. After being told she had the wrong agency to review the arrest record and being directed to a different police department, she didn’t follow through. Roof used the pistol he purchased to slaughter 9 members of a bible study group in a church in Charleston just after they had fellowshipped and prayed with him. He almost changed his mind, because, in his own words, “They’d been so nice to me.”

Gary Martin failed a background check. An initial background check failed to detect Martin’s criminal record. Months later, a second background check found his 1995 aggravated assault conviction in Mississippi involving the stabbing of an ex-girlfriend. He was told to turn over his weapon. He never did and police didn’t confiscate it, nor did anyone ever follow up on its Martin later killed five co-workers and wounded six other people at a suburban Chicago manufacturing plant.

15-year-old Jaylen Fryberg killed four classmates and wounded one other in Marysville, Washington, before killing himself. Fryberg’s father was later convicted of illegally obtaining guns and for failing to acknowledge on federal firearm forms that he was the subject of a tribal domestic-violence protective order. That order was never sent into the state or federal criminal databases. Jaylen Fryberg was armed with a .40-caliber Beretta Px4 Storm handgun that he stole from his father when he committed the mass shooting that killed his classmates."
TrueCrime,fenssc8,t1_fenphba,1579290189.0,"In my opinion, for whatever it’s worth to you, I feel like it’s because the mother had an affair with the cousin’s husband. People are allowing that to color how they view the mother and she bears the brunt of their animosity because of that. She’s viewed as “the homewrecking whore that slept with Tanya’s husband and moved in with him four months after Dennis died,” so Dennis Hernandez is always going to seem like the better person, because of the double standards our society views men, women, marriage and sexuality with. Even though Dennis Hernandez abused his wife and sons, he is always going to be viewed as the better person than Terri Hernandez, simply because she committed what is viewed as a cardinal sin: she had an affair and not just an affair with any person, but with her cousin’s husband. She can’t atone for that. This is why Terri Hernandez shoulders most of the blame.

Additionally, Dennis Hernandez is dead. Dead men can’t give interviews and damn themselves. I suspect if Dennis Hernandez was alive, we’d be seeing a bit of the side of him that his family saw. Dennis Hernandez seemed to have the same lack of impulse control that Aaron Hernandez had."

Deputy Josh Byars yelled, “Fuck your breath,” at him as he lay dying on the ground. I can’t imagine dying and that being the last thing I heard."
iamatotalpieceofshit,felx9hu,t1_felioyh,1579233249.0,"I have, and do, work closely with law enforcement. The decent officers are very hard to come by and it’s getting increasingly difficult to find them. There are very, very few Tommy Normans or Bryan Woodwards. There are an overwhelming amount of Roy Olivers, Amber Guygers, Betty Shelbys, Jonathan Aleddas and Sean Larkins running the asylums...I mean police departments.

Most officers walk around with a chip, called “assumed authority”, on their shoulders. They rarely know the laws and the constitution they swear they’re trying to uphold. They patrol neighborhoods they wouldn’t live in and profile the people in those neighborhoods through the lens of their own personal biases, values and morales. They send Daniel Holtzclaw into primarily African American neighborhoods, ignore the reports that he raped African American women for years, then when he finally raped the wrong African American woman (read: an upper middle class, clean record, suburbanite African American woman), the same legal community that was supposed to be supporting these women victim blamed them. They gave Stick Larkin a spot on “Live PD”, even though we all knew Sticks has a history of beating African American men & boys in Tulsa; but that’s okay, because those men & boys are thugs and gangsters. Sticks told us that, so it must be true, right? But Tulsa county doesn’t allow “Live PD” to film anymore because Randy Wallace wasn’t a gang member just because Stick said he was. 

See, you say police lives matter. You’re right, they do. But so do ours. We never said police lives, or anyone else’s lives, don’t matter. You seem to think that when we said “Black lives matter,” we were saying “ONLY black lives matter.” No. We were saying “Black lives matter *in addition to and as equally as all other lives*.” Law enforcement and those who support them are showing us that our lives don’t matter, though, every single time officers execute us without mercy with no accountability, then tell us to get over it and demand us to ignore the discrepancy in the way we are treated.

Black lives have ALWAYS been expendable. 

We keep being told:

“He/she should have complied.”
“What’s the OTHER side of the story?”
“The officer was afraid for his life.”
“He/she has had contact with law enforcement in the past.”

Here’s the issue with this:

Jordan Edwards wasn’t given a chance to  “cooperate” before being executed by Officer Roy Oliver.

Tamir Rice wasn’t given a chance to “cooperate” when he was executed by Officer Loehmann. That officer shot him with TWO SECONDS of arriving at the park where Tamir was PLAYING.

Charles Kinsey was FULLY COOPERATING when he was shot in the leg by Officer Aledda. By the grace of God, he’s still alive.

Dylann Roof was slaughtered NINE church members and had a semi-automatic gun in his hands when police arrived. The arresting officer bought him fast food on the way back to the police station.

James Holmes shot up a movie theater, killing 12 and had his gun in his hands when police arrived. He was allowed to watch the deceased/injured being taken out of the theater, from the backseat of a police car.

Brenda Spencer shot up a school, killing the janitor and principal and had a gun in her hand when she was arrested. She barricaded herself in her home and was allowed to make phone calls to news reporters while barricaded.

Scott Michael Green killed two police officers and was taken alive, though he did brandish his gun at the arresting officers.

Derrick Daniel Thomas broke into a home, robbed the occupants, fled on foot, attempted to rob construction worker and pointed his gun at officers, saying, “No, YOU drop your gun.” He was taken alive and had NO injuries.

Adacia Chambers rammed her car into a crowd, celebrating a homecoming football game, killing four. She was taken into custody alive."

I can look at the mitigating circumstances, in their totality, and understand *why* he would be led to do the things he did, but I do not believe his actions are justifiable. He took three lives and deprived his own child of a father, while also leaving her with this reprehensible legacy to carry on with as she grows. That’s not something that was ever his right to do, no matter what he went through.

Perhaps it may be less difficult for me to have empathy for Hernandez, due to the nature of my own career. I am a CPS investigator and I work child death, near death and shocking & heinous abuse cases exclusively. I’ve been doing this for years and it’s important to have a sense of heightened empathy and to be able to look at a person’s history and current life, in totality, to establish an entire snapshot of their circumstances."
