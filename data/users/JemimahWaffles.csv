If a person outright refuses 3 genuine, active attempts to help them, they dont want help. Now it's just a question of how sad this union gets before you break or find a pair to stand up for yourself (not attacking her, but defending yourself, you dont seem to distinguish between the two).

ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,feie38l,t1_fei7adm,1579136360.0,"Because risk involves 2 factors: likelihood, and impact. Because we properly identify the radical right, it is very low LIKELIHOOD they get any power, but it is very high IMPACT (very bad) if they do. Conversely, it's not nearly as bad when the radical left takes over (lower IMPACT), but since they are allowed to (high LIKELIHOOD) it is equally as risky.

The answer is that the radical right is correctly identified by society and therefore (correctly) not given the levers of power. We keep them in check. Things like flags and uniforms make them easy to identify. And let's be clear these are baby nazis with polo shirts and tiki torches, not real nazis. Society does no such identification of the radical left so they're allowed to slowly take over. The radical left are the main ones trying to suppress free speech, engage in thought policing, and will use shame/exile/social network mobs to strongarm anyone that disagrees with them. It's EXTREMELY authoritarian. Not to mention the left are responsible for the anti-male sentiment and wild revisionist history around our culture we see today.

PS I've voted straight-ticket D all my life, in case the 'you're actually right wing' reactionary impulse comes up. I've just been willing to look in the mirror and admit the faults of the side I chose. 99.9999% of people won't do this because it will implicitly mean they were wrong about things, which humans hate."
