Iirc the explanation to this was that our skin doesn't sense temperatures in absolute numbers, but more in relation to the skin's own temperature. 

The hand in the cold water from my example doesn't stop feeling cold due to exhausted cold receptors as you described. They still send out the child signal."

One hand goes into the cold bowl, the other in the hot (not burning hot obviously) and then you put both hands in the lukewarm water. The hand from the hot bowl will sense it as cold and the other as warm."

gaming,fedw6v0,t1_fedt1wb,1579021178.0,"As I mentioned in my first post that your origin also has an impact.

I am from Germany and for the year 2000 there aren't even data available of how many people have internet access. The data collection began in 2001 and then 37% of the population from age 14 and upwards had internet access. I don't know how your source classified the data and if they included all ages stating from 0

And looking at your posted graph I couldn't see Germany, but Europe as a whole and surprise surprise the total number of people with internet access are less than 20%

And to your comment with dial up, well, that wasn't as accessible and as affordable so very few people had this. And there was also no need for most people to go through that hustle. The phone was more important than internet at that time.

You are right with your comments, but only from your standpoint. Germany, even though it is a developed industrial country, had broad widespread internet access later than the us population did."

Viele, wenn nicht alle haben dabei eigentlich nur anderen nachgesprochen ohne wirklich darüber nachgedacht zu haben. Das wurde dadurch deutlich als unsere Lehrerin folgende Frage stellte:"" Wer aus dieser Klasse sollte dann eurer Meinung nach alles aus Deutschland abgeschoben werden?"" Wir waren eine typische Klasse mit klicken und ""Feindschaften"" aber dennoch hat diese Frage den  Schwachsinn den die meisten vorher erzählt hatten allen deutlich gemacht."

On the other hand, some sacrifices have to be made. I don't know which sacrifice is the lesser evil, the sheep or big agriculture for cotton and hemp fibres or synthetic fibres.

Yes, tlj had new ideas, but being new doesn't mean it's good. And no, they weren't good.

Am I 100% happy with TRoS? No. Is it better than 8? Yes!

If tlj would have been a good movie, than we would have received a better episode 9.


The main problem I see in the planning of the new trilogy is, that there was no planning at all. It seems like there were no plot ideas and plans for the trilogy when they started to make the force awakens. I can't explain this otherwise. Even the prequels had a plan, they knew where they were going when directing episode 1. But for the recent movies, not so much. 

But I wished that JJ were a little bit brave and let Rey and Kylo die along with the emperor. No more Sith or Jedi, all gone. They could have done this and still continue making more movies. Without jedi and Sith but other force sensitive individuals. Or set in different era's, for example during the times if the old republic, before Darth Bane and his order of two when the Sith were in Korriban and in higher numbers."

Dang it, we are even taught at school to do this being it science classes where teachers might ask questions and demand their own ideas regardless of being right or wrong, poems and other literature pupils have to analyse, or when you watch a movie and start making assumptions what each scene might have been about and where the next scene might lead us.
