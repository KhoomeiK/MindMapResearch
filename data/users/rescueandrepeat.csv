TalesFromTheCustomer,ffjfmik,t1_ffjetdn,1579997229.0,GE has done that to me a few times with their Profile line. Super frustrating!
TalesFromTheCustomer,ffjfh5v,t1_ffj4w3s,1579997140.0,"No, they said they paid for the service call to the plumber. Blue box doesn't charge for delivery."
TalesFromTheCustomer,ffivlng,t1_ff9b2a6,1579983773.0,The blue store doesn't charge appliance delivery fees.
TalesFromTheCustomer,ffivhhm,t1_ff9c3ln,1579983698.0,"Just because it's still on the website doesn't mean the manufacturer hasn't discontinued it. If it was a brand starting with W or F, they are horrible about keeping things on their site, telling the salesperson it's dc'd then shopping it the next day, or saying they will ship in 14 days then not even making the stupid thing for 28+.  

The company mentioned doesn't pay commission either. As far the third party delivery teams, the customer isn't the only ones who get frustrated. Blame those companies on the corporate folks, not there local people."
SkincareAddiction,ffaxmdc,t1_ff7ot6g,1579746858.0,"A little. I would do one day on, one day off for a few weeks until it gets better. A good moisturizer would be a good thing to add as well. I use TO squalene oil 3-4x a week."
30PlusSkinCare,ff5kt7j,t3_ep6h3z,1579597684.0,I used to work with paint and paint remover all day and hands were so dry they looked like patchwork. I highly recommend Okeffees working hands.
cats,ff42zwk,t1_ff3fzph,1579554424.0,"I have several small dogs. I'm afraid they would run towards their kennel instead of the outside if the house caught fire. Actually I know one would for sure. We had a bad smoke detector go crazy a few years ago and it beeped probably for hours until we got home. Now any beeping causes him to shake uncontrollably and run for the kennel. 

One of my biggest anxieties is losing my babies in a house fire. Stuff and houses can be replaced. My babies can't be. I'm going to check my detectors when I get home. I'm so sorry for your loss."
Android,ff420no,t1_ff2ek52,1579553820.0,Thanks for your help!
Android,ff14q7r,t1_fexs71f,1579475151.0,"I may just use an old phone until the new Samsung drops and do like you say and grab a S10. Do you think I could get a new S10e for that price? If so, any recommendations for where to get one?"
Android,fev82dn,t3_ephyp3,1579394309.0,"The screen on my trusty S7 decided it no longer wanted to work. A new front piece is $85 plus $40 for labor. I also need a new battery which is $34 plus $10 for the kit to replace it but no labor because I think I can do it myself.  So I'm looking at $125 to get it running again plus $45 for a battery. US Att carrier

Should I repair it or replace?  If I replace, I'd like to start around $300 or less. I've only ever had Samsung so I'm lost when it comes to the less expensive brands."

insanepeoplefacebook,feivi6q,t1_feijns3,1579148340.0,"I don't think the jobs pay a lot, but some of the prison also allow work release, such as farm work, etc.  I think they can use the money for commissary or save it. It gives them work experience for when they get out, a purpose while they are there, and (at least at one of the prison nearby) provides fresh food for the prison."
insanepeoplefacebook,feiux61,t3_ep6095,1579147881.0,"I actually think it's a great idea to help inmates get an education. I only know a few people who have done real prison time and the ones who used their time to get skills and education have fared much better than the ones who just ride their time out. I do think it's sad that we have decided that lack of healthcare, little help available for finding jobs, and lack of access to affordable education (college or vocational) is considered unfair for inmates but okay for citizens. Maybe if we had those things for our people, we wouldn't have the issues we do now surrounding prison and incarceration."
Mattress,feidwcs,t3_epb51s,1579136234.0,I bought a BIB and it said to unbox within a week. Will it be longer than a week?

Genealogy,feecelj,t3_eol9aj,1579030870.0,"Yeah.... It's as bad as you think it is. They didn't really have field specialists. He was probably not very nice to them. You didn't keep overseer jobs if you were nice. 

That said, the 1863 timing is probably right. The south knew they were losing the war, the Emancipation Proclamation happened in Jan 1863 and the writing was on the wall. Your ancestors may have been worried they would be kicked out of the country or worse. Atlanta was burning, guerrilla war was going on, and troops were raiding the countryside in the south. My own Southern family had 15 head of cattle, pigs, and corn taken by the Confederate troops. 
I think he lied so he could have a fresh start or maybe he was worried Australia wouldn't take him if he said he was a slaver driver, literally."
trashy,fea7vwy,t1_fe94l7p,1578945397.0,I did. I think it could be taken as either the restaurant will be taking the whole processing fee from the tip pool or the percentage of the fee related to the tip. It never specifies.

It's the only thing that's cleared up the remaining 15% of my stubborn acne that 18 months of spironolactone and Aczone couldn't.

TalesFromRetail,fdyoejq,t1_fdyesgo,1578781933.0,There was never going to be 6 people checking. It was always going to be 2 (or however many) checkers. Now there's the capacity to check more people at once and keep the ones who have only a few items from having to stand in line waiting.
BeautyGuruChatter,fdm7b0r,t1_fdfncns,1578541560.0,Reach out to his hospice nurse if he has one. Or to the oncology nurses. Those were the biggest resources I had.
lowcarb,fdl7xxr,t3_elsoqe,1578518570.0,I understand that. I did 2 weeks of keto and my stomach got so much flatter even though I only lost 6 pounds. A few days of too much indulging and it's back to normal even though I only gained 2 pounds.

TalesFromRetail,fc9jj2o,t1_fc9h66i,1577553599.0, It's been a few years and I don't remember the name of the restaurant. I tried to search for it when I posted but the only thing I can find is another restaurant in town that the owner was doing something similar to one girl.

After a year, I was probably 75% clear using Aczone and spironolactone. We added minocycline and Differin in November and as of last week, I'm 99% clear (a few blackheads).

Edit to add: I'm sorry you're going through this. Please don't think I think you're dumb or anything.  I've done similar but I took the risk of not patch testing knowing it could happen. A kid doesn't know to do that. KWIM?"
