Our leaders were all deacons in the church where the meetings were held. We had an outbuilding, but would go into the church to work on merit badges.

One time we headed into the church, and the scout leader told me to take my hat off (he didn't like me much). This was the exchange:

Him: Take your hat off.

Me: Why?

Him: Because it's disrespectful.

Me: Who would wearing a hat disrespect?

Him: God

Me: Why would wearing a hat be disrespectful to God?

Him: Because it is!

Me: According to whom?

Him: It's in the Bible!

--Hands him a Bible--

Me: Could you show me the passage where it states that?

Him: Just take the damn hat off.

After working on the merit badge he took me outside to have a serious discussion about respect or some other BS. I think he didn't like me because he was exactly like me when bet got out of the military. Long hair, smoked weed, etc. 

He ended up blackmailing me to get me to stop appealing being sent to alternative school for 19 weeks because the drug dog hit on my car and they picked flakes of what they called weed out of my floor board (it was never tested)."
