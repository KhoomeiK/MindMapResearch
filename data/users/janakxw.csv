offmychest,fglxv5l,t1_fgl6y89,1580913597.0,">I do not think it would be a good idea to bring a child into this world if you cannot give them a decent life.

I agree with that, and to be honest that's a pro-choice belief. But of course, it doesn't matter what you label yourself as, we can agree on that statement."
offmychest,fgl2olj,t1_fgl2b2w,1580880139.0,Are you Asian? Cuz that's such an Asian dad thing to say. I did engineering and now I wish I had done comsci cuz there's comsci jobs in every fking city but it's not the same with engineering. but yea it's so good that you've done all that research so it's clearly something you really want. I wish you all the best!
offmychest,fgl2dlf,t3_ez3wo4,1580879878.0,"Sometimes if ""drive"" or motivation isn't working for you, self-discipline is the way to go. Try forcing yourself to complete multiple small tasks to start. Maybe that will help."
offmychest,fgl1wdr,t3_ez3zeo,1580879464.0,"Well, I hope you're learning from your mistakes because pettiness isn't an attractive personality traits to have when you're trying to date."
offmychest,fgl1kv5,t3_ez40ac,1580879189.0,"Bruh you're doing comsci and that's already amazing! In no way are you wasting your potential. Though it is realistic to research about the working environment in Japan before jumping in, taking your career outside of where you are is such a great way to grow as a person. I didn't see the appeal in traveling because I was comfortable where I am, but oh boi going to different countries is such an experience.

I don't know how your family is but maybe your dad might be afraid that you'd be away for a long time and he'd be lonely. You are his kid after all.

But hey, if you know what you want, someone else can't ""want"" it for you, iykwim."
offmychest,fgku000,t1_fgktea9,1580873569.0,Anytime! Please take care of yourself and go with someone you can trust if you can.
offmychest,fgkkz29,t3_ez157a,1580867989.0,"Doesn't matter what other people think. If your choice gives you a sense of relief, or nothing at all, then it's absolutely the right choice for you. In fact, a lot of women feel the same way as you do, it's just hard to speak up about feeling relieved when other people are telling you that you've ""committed murder""."

lingling40hrs,fghqhfq,t1_fghq3us,1580791046.0,I didn't report it but I too feel like it is a personal attack against me.
PublicFreakout,fghmk8p,t1_fghd1a8,1580788258.0,"True, it is a he said she said situation during a sensitive time."
PublicFreakout,fghcrx7,t1_fgh86ey,1580781947.0,"Yes, but being concerned with the virus doesn't give you the right to call someone a ""diseased bitch"". If people actually cared about their health and are not using it as an excuse to be racist, they would educate themselves on why people wear masks and it's effectiveness against the coronavirus. Wouldn't you agree?"
PublicFreakout,fgh7yrk,t1_fgh7dtg,1580778807.0,"Well, I don't know if you live in NY but I do. And I happen to be Asian as well. I wore a mask on the MTA and got stares. Luckily nothing like this happened to me. So personally, I think it's very plausible for this to have been about the fear around coronavirus and racism towards Asian people. And I am disappointed to say having to commute everyday to work, it's not rare to witness/experience racism on the subway.

But yes I do agree this video is very short and we cannot say for sure. It is just ... Hard to watch.

Edit: The location of this subway is also in Chinatown, if that adds anything to the context."

It seems like jump rope would focus on calve muscles a lot, while it seems running uses a larger range of muscles. Genuinely curious cus jump rope seems more fun too, tho I suck at it."
