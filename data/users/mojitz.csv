Meanwhile, it doesn't help that police departments and unions fight significant efforts at reform and oversight at every damn turn. You'd think law-abiding cops who are interested in pursuing criminal justice would welcome efforts to root out corruption and malfeasance wherever they can, but instead they throw all their efforts behind ensuring they can duck behind their mafia-style code of silence and wait for the conclusions of the internal ""review"" whenever shit hits the fan...

Political_Revolution,ff9nttd,t1_ff99hf4,1579716888.0,">The far left loves to call him ""alt-right adjacent"" or ""alt-light"" because he talks to people from all sides of the political spectrum. A radical idea in todays times, but something that any respected entertainer, academic, or political pundit SHOULD do (see Gore Vidal, Noam Chomsky). 

As someone who's politics are pretty damn far left myself, this is something I've always been uncomfortable with. I've always figured that - as we've often seen - right wing ideas whither under sunlight and that in fact the best way to defeat them is through exposure. 

*That said*, I'm not unsympathetic to the motivations behind this thinking either - particularly as ideas from the left are frequently not given the same ""fair shake"" within popular media as are those from the right. I mean, how often do you see the likes of Noam Chomsky or Zizek being interviewed on national TV? Hell even AOC rarely gets the opportunity to air her views during primetime these days. The guardrails, in other worlds, allow discourse to creep up to social democratic views, but never beyond. Not so for a vatiety of hardcore right wing and libertarian beliefs that are really just as radical. I would also argue that the right wing has shown a particular willingness to operate within echo chambers free from criticism since at least the rise of conservative talk radio in the 80s. I can't think of any leftists equivalents anywhere near as long standing or influential as the likes of Rush Limbaugh or Fox News. Reddit and other forms of social media are (for better or worse) finally producing such spaces for leftists, but this is a new phenomenon within the realm of mass media and I think there is some level of overzealousness here that is causing people to embrace some ideas that are ultimately illiberal and - in my estimation - misguided.

I also think we forget that Joe Rogan is an MMA announcer and the former host of fear factor, but not in any way notable as an intellectual. I honestly think he doesn't challenge right wingers even when they spout abhorrent ideas at least in part because he's not really capable of doing so. I don't think the dude is a moron or anything, but I just haven't seen any evidence that he's capable of effectively peeling back the rhetorical armor that often guards dubious ideas about the world - which is a backhanded way of saying I think he at very least operates in good faith even if the net effect is that he often ends up spreading odious theories from the right. At the end of the day, if he serves as an example of intellectual honesty and openness to new ideas and evolution of personal beliefs, I welcome his contributions to civil and political discourse."

This shit has essentially pervaded all commercial media, trickled through the culture at large, then been fed back into that same media.

Its the same today with the gun rights movement's fetishization of *the weapons themselves* (as opposed to the *principles* behind gun rights) or ""progressive"" yuppie environmentalism via conspicuous consumption of organic produce and the like. That's not to say that either of these objectives (gun rights or environmentalism) are flawed as ideas in-and-of themselves, but that they have been co-opted into avenues of profit for large businesses rather than subjects of ideological battles...

Hypernormalisation is a film by the same director that largely continues in the same vein, but focuses more specifically on propaganda. 

Suffice it to say, though, that that summery hardly does the films justice. There's a lot of stuff throughout that suggests some profoundly troubling things about the ability of the powerful to manipulate the masses through relatively simple psychological techniques - even as the films remain well-sourced and rooted firmly in everyday beliefs about the world.

How do we do this? There are a shit ton of answers and I think electoral reform has to be considered, but on the subject of education I would say that we can do a far *far* better job of educating people in how government functions on a day-to-day basis. We do a decent (ok half-way decent) job of explaining the *framework* of the system - the structure of congress, the form of the electoral college, the basics of how authority is split between the judicial, legislative and executive branches etc. - but we absolutely fail when it comes to laying out the various axes and sources of *real power* within the government. How does lobbying work? In what ways has authority been delegated to various regulatory bodies and why? What role do various norms (as opposed to strict rules) play in the functioning of government? Our k-12 educational system spends almost no time explicating these sorts of subjects and as a result you end up with a whole shitload of people who are educated just enough to know *how* to vote, but have very little understanding of how to best express achieve their particular interests via that process."

Are you trying to suggest that the right wing was *less* vitriolic heading into the 2016 election? I find that hard to square with anything I witnessed of that election. Also, I'm not trying to defend hyperbolic statements and various forms of vitriol from any particular side here, but it seems like you have quite a skewed view of where the energy lies on the left - particularly insofar as leftists interested in exercising formal political power are concerned. Yes, there is absolutely a subset of the left that includes the anarchists, the tankies, the very far ends of the social justice movements and the like who are as you describe - I've hung out in these circles myself - but these groups are extremely different in nature from those pushing for leftist ideology within the sphere of electoral politics. Look at the conversations being had within the volunteer networks for Warren and Sanders and they're absolutely nothing like what you describe. Yes, the fringe is very loud online and roll in very insular IRL circles, but the very same can be said of the extremists on the right. 

&#x200B;

>Why do you think, then, that so many people are not on your side?  What  is it that you think motivates people to be consumers of this media, if  it's so bad?  If I'm, say, a right wing guy in Akron, Ohio, and I work  at a warehouse, and I'm pro-Trump, why is it do you think I vote for  him, and watch Fox news, rather than say, ""Well all of this is a bunch  of shit"" and join the other side?  The left is promising me things like  consistent health care, safety and labor protections.  A reasonable  wage.  How does that lose?

The long-and-short of this is that the DNC and corporate media outlets work extremely hard to make sure neo-liberal ideals are at the forefront of policy ideas - and to consequently do everything they can to quash the chances of leftists by questioning their ideas at every turn, playing up the most radical fringes as much more representative than they are and where they can trying to structure things to the neo-liberals' favor. These are no small hurdles to overcome - especially when you consider the huge difference that can by made by swings of even a couple percentage points. 

You may say that this is me jumping at the opportunity to blame others for the shortcomings of the left, but I'm honestly not sure how else a dispassionate observer is to see this. In this cycle, look at the shenanigans played with the scheduling and criteria for the debates and look at the questions *in* those debates. Look at the coordination between the DNC and the Clinton camp from the beginning of the electoral cycle last time. Look at the near-total support for Joe Biden *and* Clinton from well-heeled neo-liberal interests in influential sectors of the economy and the resources they're able to put to bear as a result. I mean, is it really plausible that Biden would be where he is in the polls if McCain-Feingold were still in effect or if CNN weren't owned by AT&T?

What this extremely uneven playing field results in is the democrats repeatedly offering up corporate candidates who represent the interests of the status-quo (which is to say, stability) going up against right wing figures who are promising dramatic change. Of course a poor person with few prospects is going to be drawn to the right here. You choose the democrats, and you're voting to stay in your shitty, dead-end job just barely managing to support your family and being scared to death about your kids falling into meth or fentanyl addiction - but perhaps seeing some marginal improvements in some areas.  A vote for the republicans, meanwhile, is rolling the dice on some maybe crazy-sounding ideas from the right - but hey, at least you *get to roll the dice* and maybe have a shot at a significantly improved life even if its not clear exactly how that might come to fruition. Until leftists manage to gain some meaningful influence within the DNC and offer significant alternatives that actually promise to dramatically change the fortunes of working people, a vote for someone like trump *is* the rational one for a large chunk of his base.

Here's the thing. You \*haven't\* headed anything off here. None of these are arguments that are of interest to me, and frankly I think the fact that you assume they are is further evidence that your views of where the energy on the left lies is a bit skewed. Yes, the radicals are the most likely to engage in direct action and make the most noise at protests, but they certainly don't make up the majority of *even the left* (by any reasonable definition of the word) and have by-and-large rejected electoral politics in favor of some fantasy about ""the rev"" and misplaced disdain for anything that can be construed as ""reformist"" instead of purely revolutionary. I highly suggest you investigate the more moderate (though still decidedly leftist) circles before you make any more generalizations about the political left of this country and where its heart *really* lies - because for all their insistence to the contrary, it doesn't lie a the fringes."

I just don't see this. We're not really seeing any sort of cunning or even focus, really, in trump's actions, so much as a series of manifest pathologies stemming from a life of incredible privilege. Sure, he makes a big show of his actions, but such shows often fail rather spectacularly only to be sold rather insistently as successes even to the defiance of the most plainly available facts. 

This is because the victory isn't really so much about achieving a policy goal as it is being able to publicly announce success. Its exactly the same as his rather dubious claim of being a billionaire. The important thing isn't actually having the billions, its in people seeing you a certain way. Trump doesn't really seem to want much of anything out of his presidency, though, beyond adulation and maybe a sensation of power. He just wants to be able to get in front of those rally crows and seeing the masses cheering for him and worshipping his image. 

Meanwhile, what successes he has claimed aren't really his doing - think of the tax bill that he had no hand in, the extremely minor changes to NAFTA that were negotiated entirely by people other than him, the appointment of supreme court justices from a list of people he didn't put together and pushed through senate approval by hands other than his. If anything, it's not trump who is being underestimated, it's the people in charge of the GOP... who are only happy to keep feeding the voracious ego that long-ago replaced any humanity that once found some meager purchase in there - so long as he continues to deliver more and more power upwards through society. *These* are the forces with goals and focus about which we should be worried."

Rarely do you see a corporation lobby to *increase* safety or environmental regulations, for example, because these address downsides of working at a company that executives tend to be insulated from.

This means that in effect the political activities of a corporation are a way for a small number of typically like-minded people who are all currently benefiting from the status quo to exercise far out-sized power and influence over society.

If the CPC announced tomorrow that they were going to begin initial steps towards democracy or more liberal human rights - say by allowing non binding votes on certain municipal policies or something - they could easily do so without generating any kind of great turmoil. I don't know why you'd think otherwise unless you for some reason believe that the Chinese people have some kind of profound aversion to or inability to handle greater political freedoms - but that would be one hell of a claim to try to justify.

>It seems like a lot of people hate the government purely for ideological  reasons - fair - but seem to disregard that the population is content  with the CCP.

From my experience, that contentment has most to do with a lack of agency on one hand, and a growing economy on the other. It takes an *extremely* high critical mass of discontentment to risk life-and-limb in openly opposing what is essentially a hereditary oligarchy with a demonstrated willingness to crack down harshly on dissent. Even if people are unhappy with the government, they may not reach such a level that they're willing to undertake enormous risks until we see a significant economic contraction. Anecdotally, I've heard quite a bit of discontentment with the CPC expressed to me privately by everyone from cab drivers, to students to, laborers and middle-class workers - but of course they're unable to express this sort of thing in any substantially public forum without significant risk to themselves. Meanwhile, information on incidents such as the [Wukan Protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wukan_protests) is largely suppressed. In short, the assumption that people are content with the CCP is worth interrogating further. I would argue that a better description would be ""resigned,"" - at least for a large swath of the population.

&#x200B;

>that the CCP sucks ass, but it's the best government for the Chinese people right now.

What exactly do you mean when you say, ""best?"" What realistic alternatives are *worse* than the current regime? I mean, ultimately the reforms implemented by Deng Xiaoping were inevitable or else the government would have had to face total collapse, and the economic growth they've seen since then was essentially inevitable. I suppose you could argue that at least they're not some kind of brutal theocracy or something, but I don't see a realistic path for that taking hold over the past 70 years anyway. Meanwhile, the people remain not only saddled with the lack of basic political freedoms of which most people are aware, but also must endure plenty of vestiges of former times - such as the [Hukou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hukou) system - that could have long ago been easily removed. At the same time, corruption continues to run-rampant throughout all levels of government and inequality is at extraordinary highs. Basically what we have is a status where, yes, people aren't willing to risk revolt against the government en masse, but the government would have had to really royally fuck things up to not be in such a position. In other words, the government has perhaps been reasonably competent, but \*best\*? That seems like quite a stretch. Best, to my mind, would have sorted out a way to afford greater political freedoms and significantly reduce levels of corruption - and put the country on a path to continue to implement these reforms to an increasing extent. As of right now, we're in fact seeing significant backsliding on those fronts."
