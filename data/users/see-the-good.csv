Sometimes I find myself scrolling past questions that I think I know the answer to, forgetting that the answers provided could very well help me form a DEEPER understanding. 
Thanks for asking!"

NevilleGoddard,fde0pap,t1_fddma4d,1578328537.0,"YouAreCreators on youtube is where I gained a good deal of knowledge about manifesting in a way that I was able to understand. It helped me to prepare for some huge manifestations in my own life. 
Also, Pam Grout in the book E Squared (with the small number two like in the Theory of Relativity) also helps to break things into chucks that might be easier to digest while giving concrete examples that help to make the “why” more relatable as you continue to learn more."
