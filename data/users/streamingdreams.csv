You should start NC and don‚Äôt dwell on the hope of him coming back because that could bring you more pain. He may come back, but he may stand by his choice and end up moving on.

BreakUps,fcbjxq0,t3_eh04oa,1577587738.0,"I definitely understand this. I was in a relationship for the past four months and I put my entire happiness into the relationship. I would never do things I enjoyed because I was too dependent on him. 
To be honest, it‚Äôs very unhealthy to act this way in a relationship. First, you need to be able to find happiness within yourself and different parts of life such as your friends or family. It‚Äôs super hard to find happiness after a break up; however, I recommend going to the gym or finding some sort of hobby you like. Also, keep your mind busy. There is no set timeline on how long you have until you need to move on; however, it is important to realize that you must go on with life even though you experienced a breakup. Break ups are super tough. I have found that the inspiration posts on Reddit have really helped me to see how people have healed from their breakup. If you can not take your mind completely off of the breakup, you may need more time to grieve or just to reflect on everything. I‚Äôve read the grieving is a very important stage to get through in order to move on. Maybe even see a therapist or just rant to someone if needed. I wish you all the luck."

BreakUp,fc79crl,t3_egj5ca,1577500981.0,"I‚Äôm in the exact same boat. I just got broken up with yesterday. He said he still loves me but he needs to focus on his future. It can be quite confusing as to why he would want to break up if he still loves you; however, he may have a certain reasoning. I do not know your situation or the reason he gave you, but it may help to talk to him about why he decided to break things off. I think that it is perfectly okay to talk to him and get closure; however, you should give him space for a while after that. It will be extremely hard (I‚Äôm having to go through the exact same thing). I think you should focus on other things that make you happy such as family or your friends. It may help to call someone you love or even start seeing a therapist if needed. It will help to focus on work or school and to keep yourself busy. One thing I would not do if I were you is dwell on the hope of him wanting to get back together. He may want to in the future or he may not want to. However, having false hope can make you even more miserable. Good luck to you and I hope everything works out for the best. You can message me if you‚Äôd like to talk about it more. It is a really hard situation to go through, but everyone keeps saying it will get better with time. Still hoping that it‚Äôs true."
BreakUp,fc5269p,t1_fc50t2x,1577439245.0,Maybe he‚Äôs having a hard time with himself. I think you should let him know how you are feeling about the break up and possibly communicate with him about it.
BreakUp,fc50rgs,t3_eg8ss0,1577437198.0,"I think you should talk more about it to him. I just got broken up with today as well and it‚Äôs really hard. I think you should communicate with him about the relationship and find out the honest truth. Guys tend to be more straightforward than not; however, it just depends on the person you were with. Every person is different."
