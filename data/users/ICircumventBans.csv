Computers work on electricity. The electricity is either ON (1) or OFF (0), this is why everything is 1's and 0's in machine language. By combining these we can make wonderful things!

We can directly encode information: Imagine you have 8 lights in a group. I could say that each light is a number, so if light 1 is on, it's a 1. If light 2 is on, it's a 2 etc.. Then we can take it even further, and say if light 1 and light 2 are on at the same time, that's a 9!. 

We can also make ""decisions"", also known as logic gates. Say I have 2 lights, I can require 2 lights to be on to turn on a 3rd, so if light 1 and light 2 are on, turn on light 3, this would be an AND gate. I could also make a gate that only turns on light 3 if light 1 OR light 2 is on, this would be an ""OR"" gate. 

In this case the lights are just ""electricty on/ electricty off"". And by combining information with logic gates, we can start programming a chip to do something. Computers have evolved to make extremely good use of these simple patterns to create the powerful computers we have today. As others have noted, our programming languages are created to make words and text translate directly into 1's and 0's for the computer to understand."
