My partner broke down when I mentioned my concern of them not being able to care for me down the road and has made a proactive effort to show that they can. I really appreciate the improvement and it makes me feel valued in their life. My partner is a great person with a lot of baggage and I value them for all of the good parts they can get a control of. They’ve mentioned that they worry I’ll get sick of them and leave, I can’t imagine leaving without trying the best we can together first. Your comment really encourages me to have another conversation about it for the new year. I usually don’t get this much advice about my relationship in real life! Thank you."
GetMotivated,fcnkrbp,t1_fcn903g,1577813446.0,"My partner has improved so much over the years, receiving various forms of therapy and treatments. They were transparent about their depression and other issues when we first started dating and we actually struggled a lot in the beginning because I had never dated anyone with their set of particular challenges in life. But after a few years into the relationship, it’s easier (and actually the best it’s ever been) because I know them and why they do certain things. I try my best to not take things personally anymore because I know what they’re going through is within themselves."
GetMotivated,fcnj576,t1_fcmo4qo,1577812704.0,"No worries. I’ll try to answer your question the best I can. When we met, we really just clicked. Our chemistry was on fire right off the bat. After our first date, I did my own happy dance in my car before driving off. I’ve never met a person who was so compatible with me right off the bat. A few years down the road and I still feel the same. My partner also has such a great sense of humor that I really love so much. These are things I wonder if I’d be able to find with someone else so strongly. I hope that answers your question!"
GetMotivated,fcmk5x7,t1_fcmjqb1,1577778606.0,I try my best. Thank you for your kind words :)
CatTaps,fcmhm60,t3_ehsqgw,1577775596.0,I’m sorry but your sick laugh totally sounded like a fart and it made me laugh so hard!
GetMotivated,fcmfat0,t1_fcm74o2,1577773136.0,"I’ve been having similar thoughts as you too. I’ve been in a serious relationship with my partner for a a couple years now and they struggle with depression. When they’re in a great place, we are really in a great place in our relationship! They’re so fun to be around and we laugh a lot. But when the dark cloud rolls around, it really takes a toll on us both... I try my best to be supportive and we do get through a lot of dark clouds, but I do wonder sometimes if I can handle this as their partner further on down the road. Thoughts do cross my mind if my partner would be able to take care of me when they’re so deeply immersed in their own depression. We really just take it day by day."
