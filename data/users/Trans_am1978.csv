Both games are over the top representation of skateboarding and both have great gameplay, but I get bored with Skate after about a half an hour. It seems aimless at times and the game itself didn't really hold my attention. I would welcome a new entry into either series (provided Neversoft did THPS) but I feel that gameplay era has passed. I will say that Skate 3 on the XB1X looks amazing, but I still prefer the gameplay to THPS. If you still have a 360, American Wasteland got a port there, looks great and runs at 60 fps. Then again the entire series held up surprisingly well. I think Skate 1 is kind of a relic because of the lack of the ability to get off the board, but Skate 2/3 are great."

I guess set an alarm and keep it face down and see what happens. I've gotten into the habit of keeping it face up or in my pocket and it's never failed me. I did have a Moto rep write me on here and ask if I was using a phone case that covered the screen, which I do, but I didn't change it. Like I said, I haven't noticed a single problem since always keeping it face up."

PublicFreakout,fer5t1d,t3_eqfny7,1579350183.0,"That's Anthony Panza, he's friends with Billy Perry.  Billy Perry has a youtube channel where he rides around NYC with a go pro darting in and out of traffic and doing BMX tricks.  Billy Perry has a pretty successful youtube channel as well as a BMX clothing company called FTL (Follow the Leader).  Panza has his own  off shoot youtube channel.  I'm not for certain but I believe both are professional BMX riders.

Both specialize in this kind of riding videos.  Honestly, they're pretty entertaining to watch and this is a collection of the most obnoxious moments.  

Both aren't actually from NYC but the NY suburbs."

PS4Deals,feo1xvt,t1_fenvl2e,1579294081.0,"Yes, I own Steep. I don't like it. There are no rails/grinds in the base game and the controls drive me nuts. I can't remember exactly but I spent about a half an hour trying to get a line that involved jumping on a house and I kept slipping off. I gave up. Also I think it's a real missed opportunity to not be able to change disciplines in mid air. I just wanted to ski jump then open my parachute, unless they changed it or I missed something. 

I think we like this genre for different reasons, you like to take your time and relax and I want it to be more action oriented."
PS4Deals,fensxan,t1_fenqk56,1579290272.0,"Skate is a great series, but I have more nostalgia for THPS. Both games are over the top representation of skateboarding and both have great gameplay, but I get bored with Skate after about a half an hour. It seems aimless at times and the game itself didn't really hold my attention. I would welcome a new entry into either series (provided Neversoft did THPS) but I feel that gameplay era has passed. I will say that Skate 3 on the XB1X looks amazing, but I still prefer the gameplay to THPS. If you still have a 360, American Wasteland got a port there, looks great and runs at 60 fps. Then again the entire series held up surprisingly well. I think Skate 1 is kind of a relic because of the lack of the ability to get off the board, but Skate 2/3 are great."
PS4Deals,fenoc20,t1_fenifdx,1579288487.0,The Crew is a great single player game. It's better than the sequel. You do have to be connected to the internet to play but you don't need PS Plus
PS4Deals,fenmxfy,t1_fenlfjp,1579288054.0,"Don't. As some who has been skateboarding (irl) for 25 years owns almost every single skateboarding video game, this is garbage. It's not worth 15 let alone 5. Even after all the bug fixes it's still shallow, boring and generic. If you have access to any of your old consoles any of the mainline THPS are better. If you have access to an average to low end PC get THUG Pro."
