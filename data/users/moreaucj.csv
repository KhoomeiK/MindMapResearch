You always need a strategy to get things done, and you have that skill. Not a lot of people can do that successfully from my personal experience.
If you word it right, you can even put it on your resume."
findapath,fftmflh,t3_eup23s,1580224268.0,"Tbh, social media is your best bet these days. Try to use it to your advantage, and find people who like the style of your clothing. 
Photograph it well, use relevant hashtags, interact with people, etc. Do you have a website yet? Or are you selling on a site like etsy?"

findapath,fftlspj,t3_ev4jxx,1580223825.0,"With your art and tarot readings, be firm on prices. I know a few artists who are making it on their art, or making decent side money. People will pay for what they want. You could definitely study psychology and do this on the side of you're willing to handle the work load. 
A lot of selling art is knowing how to market it. Relevant hashtags, decent social media following or able to grow it, etc. Dont let people push you around for free stuff."
findapath,fftlig8,t3_ev6kwo,1580223623.0,"I forgot to mention that I am very good with numbers, know how to put colors together, style things pretty decently, etc.

rape,ffrkn8o,t1_ffrirjp,1580159982.0,"It's been 3 years since the last time and even longer since another time. I think with me or was done so much I went numb to it. I don't know. I mean, it still hurts but survival mode always kicks in first. 
How you feel is okay and valid. We all cope differently and react differently. Your feelings belong to you, and there's no right way. I wish you the best, and I'm sorry you have to go through this rn."

Paranormal,feyr1lr,t3_eqs5mk,1579449538.0,"I've had the same thing happen. My childhood cat died when I was 18 years old, so it's been about 4 years since she passed. She comes and goes to check on me, mostly when I'm having a hard time. Very recently she came by again and scared the hell out of me at work. I was washing my hands, looked down and there she was, rubbing up on my leg and the trashcan. She disappeared and I took a few minutes before I left the bathroom. It shook me up. 
Your cat was most definitely coming to visit you, I'm sure they miss you like you miss them. It's always comforting when they come back to say hello."
