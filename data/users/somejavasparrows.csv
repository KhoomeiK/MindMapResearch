this is also true, but the literal context of you talking about your cousin's appearance is ""she wasn't hot enough for me to have a crush on"".   
that's inherently non-platonic. my cousin is pretty, but rather than thinking ""hmm no, i couldn't date her because she isn't hot enough"", i think ""hmm, *she's my cousin* and i wouldn't date her because *she's my fucking cousin*"".

MadeOfStyrofoam,feiep09,t3_ep3w6v,1579136769.0,"i'll tell you, from my experience, that love - or the stage that follows love - lingers for far longer than you could ever want it to. 

it took me months to fully have moved on from my ex - i didn't think i was still in love with her. i thought i was long over it. in hindsight, though, my attachment to her was toxic; it took a mistake and a half for me to finally get myself out of my head and back into reality.

it was a really hard time in my life. i'm sure you feel similar, if not the same as i felt back then. i won't lie and say that it'll be easy, but i can promise you that, yes, time will heal you. i know, i know - it's sickening to hear, and it's *so* cliche, but it's been over a year for me now and those feelings are long dead and gone; we're completely different people now, and at the end of the day, i'm super proud of myself for managing to have gotten through those months following the breakup so i could continue to live the life i'm lucky to have, even with some trouble along the way.

the experiences you've lived, whether good or bad (or *hellish*) all shape you. without that relationship; without the days leading to the break up, and the *sea* of tears that followed; without the awkward ""i'm over it, but i'm totally not"" stage and the embarrassing things i did then, i wouldn't have experienced the rise. the getting back up to my feet. the acceptance into a new school. the feeling of fresh air on my face after a week indoors. the waking up, and being happy to wake up. the precious *hindsight* that has taught me so much.

don't get me wrong - i thought i would spend the rest of my life with her. i thought she was my world, and the person who would stick by my side no matter what.   
but she wasn't. sometimes, that's just how it was meant to be.  
i'm a better person now. admittedly, still fighting a depressive disorder, but my best friend and current partner can attest to the fact that going through what i did - what you're going through right now - ultimately changed me for the better. not into a perfect person, but into someone who can be proud to be themselves.

if it helps, i'm also almost a year clean now, while my previous clean streak was 3 days. it's a hard habit to kick, but i'm proud of you for trying.

good luck, op. from one tragic breakup victim to another.  
(and sorry for the long post. i hope it helps <3)"

if i put myself into the position of op, i think the problem is that other people might have gotten aroused from it - if she took her bra off because it wasn't comfortable for her it would be totally cool and normal, but it's the fact that other people were watching her and asking her to do it, it seems kinda like flirting but with a ""fun party vibe"" filter put over it.

then again, imo, i'm finding more issue with the people around her than her, though it did make me uncomfortable that she said ""sorry"" but did it anyway. it's hard. you don't wanna be overwhelming or stop your partner from doing what she wants to, but at the same time you need to voice when something she does upsets you, as your feelings are just as important as hers."
