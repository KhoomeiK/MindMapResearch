Realistically I'd give the game like a 3/5. It's okay. But as a person who fell off from Yu-Gi-Oh, they've adjusted some of the rules and brought some things in line that were saturating the game. But that also means that OG OP cards like Dark Hole and Monster Reborn are useable again because everything is getting more ridiculous. I actually like it quite a bit. Pot of Greed is still banned though I think.
