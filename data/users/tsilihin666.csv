I equate having kids to quitting smoking or losing weight or eating better or whatever other life changing thing you want to do - if you are doing this for you and because you want to do this then it will change your life forever for the better. That said theres nothing wrong with not having kids if the life you live gives you fulfillment and happiness.

I just enjoy seeing him out there playing against men half his age. It's insane.
