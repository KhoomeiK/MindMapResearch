firstworldproblems,ffbpd0c,t1_ffb79o6,1579777023.0,Ha! You act like I have access to my pipes. All I can get to is what's immediately under my sink. My landlords are more concerned with keeping the pipes in the walls warm so the apartments don't implode; they were built around 1958.
firstworldproblems,ffbp7m0,t1_ffbgad7,1579776804.0,"If you keep your place warm, I agree. If you keep it cooler so you can use thick blankets, it's pretty fucking cold to stick your leg out.

Also, if you keep it cool, it's a lot harder to get out of bed in the mornings because it's so cold!"
firstworldproblems,ffb25fj,t1_ffatel4,1579749897.0,"No no no. If you stick a leg out, it fucking freezing cuz you keep it cooler so you can use the blanket. You have a leg freezing while the rest of you is a bit too warm."

rant,ffawb84,t1_ffa2dlg,1579745984.0,"I mean, you're not wrong. I wanted to make people aware, not be ridiculed for it. If I would have said a homeless person did it, they would have eaten it up."

Eugene,ff9mx3o,t1_ff9kypg,1579716349.0,Thank you! I'll try my best. My friend/coworker said I should post it here too cuz local Redditors would take it more seriously.

confessions,ff7u1u5,t3_ervkag,1579658362.0,"Dude, I so feel you OP! It's such a struggle to get my ass in the shower once a week. I've had a lot of trouble lately trying to shower at least once more per week. I feel like I don't have motivation most of the time; I have to feel gross before I will shower (as in I got hot and sweaty, so felt gross), but if i have cooked down and the sweat has dried, I don't feel motivated to clean myself.

I can't and never will shower every day, but twice a week would be nice improvement."

HaircareScience,feu8uqz,t3_eqkrmt,1579384274.0,"Are you seriously stressed out in any aspect of your life right now? Has your diet suddenly changed or declined recently? Both of those can be huge contributors to hair loss. 

For me, it's stress. I was so stressed in 2018 about my finances that my hair went from thick to super thin. We're talking only one possible layer. My hair kept breaking and falling out. To help, I got a collagen based protein powder I mixed into drinks."
AskReddit,feu7uf7,t1_fetkhcc,1579383956.0,Must be alien abduction.
AskReddit,feu6uhx,t1_fet9fsi,1579383706.0,"This has happened to me too! 

First time, I was about 12. Family and I were in the woods cuz my uncle was camping. I brought a friend of the same age and my cousin was there too, just a few years older. We were playing baseball with an old can we found. I pitched it to my friend, head the clink and turned my head to see where it landed. Didn't see it, so I turned back to my friend just in time to see the can come right at my face. I have a small crescent scar on my chin now.

The other one was my first car wreck. I was driving around a mountain pass in Montana. Clear skies, beautiful July day. I was in the left lane going 78mph in a 75 zone with a slight downhill incline. Not sure what, why or how, but suddenly my arms ever so slightly twitched to the right and my car went flying. Did a full 360. Hit the guardrail head on at a 90 degree turn. Before hitting it, I remember thinking ""what the hell did I just do to myself?"" while the car was still spinning. Got really bad whiplash I'm still dealing with 7 years later.

Seems like for me, any trauma plays in slow motion for me to fully absorb all details to replay later.
