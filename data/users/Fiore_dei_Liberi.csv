latin,fbx96fp,t1_fbx0l1i,1577175123.0,"Isn't ""to feel pain"" the definition of suffering? How could someone discernere one from the other?

If the poin of the phrase is: 

>Pain is inevitable(as in: you can't escape it), but suffering is temporary(as in: the pain/suffering will stop)  

Then, why would you separate the two things?

Unless the meaning is different from this one above, the phrase shouldn't be that hard to vertere.

Sticking to OP's I would say something like:

>Dolor necesse est, sed pati fluit(pain is inevitable, but suffering  flows/vanishes(like water under a bridge)

But I'd prefer to use doleo instead of patior:

>Dolor necesse est, sed dolere fluit

There are a lot of way to say it, OP has to choose what he prefers but I don't think  ""*passus est tempus""* makes much sense..."
