Look online obviously at how to write a thorough essay over 10 pages, when you have a lot of content like that it can be easy to have heaps of mistakes or tons of filler.

Second, if you go to a school that has some type of Writing Education Center or Writing Learning Center, take advantage of it, you already said you aren't confident in writing this much. If your school offers these services go frequently.

Don't wait till the last minute to write a long ass paper, if it's more than 5 pages you should be starting them as soon as they're assigned. 

Have people you trust read your papers and review them for your for grammar errors, and to get a real review on the content. Someone with no knowledge on what you're writing should be able to understand your paper. 

If you think the people reading your papers are being too nice, try out other people, if your professor is good at their job they will also help you along the way (if this is an ENG class)."
