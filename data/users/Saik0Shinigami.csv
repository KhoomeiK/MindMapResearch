CompTIA,ff9xglh,t1_ff9vqdv,1579723620.0,"In my mind, I think it could have been worded more along the lines of:

""Expendable items or items that tend to have a lifetime that is a fraction of the rest of the parts in the device must be reasonably serviceable."" 

Along side some verbiage that stops a company from completely potting the entire board so BGA and other surface repairs are always possible. And of course the banning of the T2-style issues. [Edit:] Oh! and the mandatory software updates that eventually obsolete your device. Apple does this too, forces updates to your old phone until it slows to unusable.[/Edit]

This way items that don't typically die can be integrated and tied into the board directly as they are now... things like fuses (designed to be expendable) can't be hidden away or integrated into larger packages and batteries are covered. Also any part in a device that could have a reasonable life of 10 years but only lasts 2 years would have to be designed in such a way to allow replacement... 

I dunno. I don't make laws for a living so I'm not sure this is 100% more reasonable but I think this would more accurately reflect what the Right to Repair ""movement"" wants."
CompTIA,ff9ucq0,t1_ff9rm41,1579721532.0,"Ram has a purpose in being soldered directly on. The slot mechanism takes up a meaningful amount of space (required board space to blow out all the pins, required the ram chips on their own board... etc. at least in the historical sense via DIMMs and such) and shortening trace lengths has benefits. You know what doesn't take a lot of space? Not using that epoxy-like glue to glue in a battery is definitionally an expendable item. 

Technicians like Louis are capable of replacing ram... Ram is actually one of the easier things if you manage to not fry the chip with heat. BGAs are annoying but not impossible. And reasonably skilled technicians can do BGA repair already. So the on-board stuff isn't an issue in this instance. I've watched a lot of Louis' stuff, he can do a lot of repairs but I never hear him complaining about ""oh this chip is impossible to replace because it's soldered on the board""... it's always ""this chip is impossible to replace because I can't even find a Chinese factory worker to find and export it to me"". The issue isn't the logistics of current board design. It's the actually supply chain logistics because companies like apple specifically make it an issue.

Digging out glue to get the battery out... or worse, epoxying it in in such a way that makes it impossible to safely get the battery out (batteries aren't the most hardy thing and some of these phones use glue that's simply stronger than the battery which means you end up damaging the battery, causing the exact thing they claim they don't want people exposed to ""dangerous li-ion batteries"") is the point of that section as I read it.

However, I can agree if your argument is that it's vague. It definitely could have been made much more clearly worded... I think they even realized since they tacked on the battery example."

The dealership, a third party (certified) shop, or my neighbor Ed who does this stuff."" It's not necessarily an end result to get grandma to do microsoldiering. It's to enable fair options to get equipment repaired. So grandma can give it to her local repair technician rather than send it in to apple and they wipe her phone because grandma is too computer illiterate to save her stuff somewhere else first.

Louis Rossmann literally has to create e-waste to repair boards that customers come to him with. Simply because Apple says so. They could easily allow their sources to sell parts to him but they go out of their way not to, including specifically making minor changes to one chip in order to have a one supplier lock-down.

People, right now, don't give a shit about their own data. If apple did it, I bet there'd be virtually no repercussions. The typical user's iCloud probably looks virtually indistinguishable from their Facebook. You can claim it's not apples to apples but it's pretty damn close. In the end offsite hosting is less secure because it's a third party who has complete access to your data and you let them do it. ""Oh it's e2e encrypted!"" yeah... and you know exactly what algorithm it's using because the whole database of a million people are using the same mechanisms. Good luck trying to decrypt any of my on-prem stuff. 

What I find funny is that you think they have some magic code that is unavailable to a typical use to run on their own systems? You realize that a piece of software running on their systems will have 100% of the same vulnerabilities as it would if you ran it on your own system right? Just in the latter instance you can configure your own solutions/options.  Further, systems that are self-run are typically open-source. Meaning nerds like me will look into the code and find the vulnerabilities and test things regularly. Where-as closed source stuff... we're not allowed to test like we would elsewhere. You're right in one sense in that vulnerabilities are found more often in that code, not because there's not as many if not more in the closed-source stuff, but because we can only work where it's legal to work and where there's code to evaluate."

Well the idea being that you rate limit on switches as much as possible and then if there's a public wifi or something you can chuck that on a VLAN, and that should manage the rate limiting as much as you probably can get away with in this ecosystem... And yes your imagination is right.

HomeNetworking,feke38q,t1_fek013b,1579198123.0,"Rate control is considered QoS in this instance.

Regardless of if the traffic flow could be offloaded after initial processing UBNT seems to disable the HW offload on an interface the moment you apply any QOS setting in that menu (Shame). It is possible to keep all other running interfaces on the HW offload, e.g. Interface 1 is running shaping and interface 2 is not, therefore 2 is offloaded and 1 simply isn't. This also works on subinterfaces... so 1.100 can be offloaded when another vlan on the same interface 1.200 isn't.

What could work is shaping on the switch which doesn't suffer performance penalties that I'm aware of(https://dl.ubnt.com/guides/edgemax/EdgeSwitch_AdminGuide.pdf page 245-247) and you can pickup stragglers on a VLAN if you can't rely on downstream hardware to deal with it. When I did a WISP we did it as close to the customer as possible so that we can distribute the workload across a bunch of smaller devices (the CPE antennas in our case). Without knowing your physical configuration (each apartment has an ethernet jack? is there public wifi? Is all the hardware centrally located? etc...) it's hard to make a hard call on what ""best"" solution would be. And I don't have a lot of experience doing this in the switch as CPEs are a little differnt. Someone else might be able to chime in here.

It has been used on occasion for giant short-tailed pterosaurs like pteranodontids, but this is not common among pterosaur workers. If we used vernacular names for prehistoric animals (which, generally speaking, we don’t), then we might well term members of the genus Pterodactylus ‘pterodactyls’.

You just admitted that 1700 is about right."

I opened the fucking post with ""he's a piece of shit"". Which he is. Probably the worst ~~governor~~ mayor NYC has ever had (as a person, business was booming quite well). But literally every in this post is simply bullshit attribution or name calling. At least call him out for the real shit he's done.

Things like using the 9/11 attack to continue his time in office bypassing term lengths.

>Mr. Giuliani became so entwined in the disaster's aftermath that he briefly considered himself indispensable, and floated a plan that would allow him to continue as mayor after his term expired on Dec. 31.

politics,fcrgdsi,t1_fcrea9f,1577901473.0,"Which corner cutting are you referencing? The radios? Why pay 10$ more per radio when the other variant is sufficient? You have to remember that there's at least 55000 people to outfit with radios... and now those vehicles and buildings that also need those radios... This can easily jump to 100,000 radios.

I chose 10$ out of thin air. It could easily have been 50 or 100$ a radio. Is finding a radio that could save 10million dollars in comparison to some other radio a bad choice? Considering the lack of information here I would claim that there's no sufficient evidence to make such a claim that it would have been dangerous. Considering that I haven't heard of this radio issue until now... 18 years later... I'm going to say that it wasn't a serious topic of issue.

The only issue I could dig up in research was [a purchase of 2,700 radios totaling 4.5 million dollars... and only for FDNY.](https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/25/nyregion/fire-union-demands-inquiry-into-contract-for-new-radios.html) So not only did OP blow it severely out of proportion... but it would be a drop in the bucket.

Also, to make it clear... this meant that each radio cost about 1700$...  You think there isn't money to legitimately save here?"

>FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers offered to run the initial response to the 9/11 attacks. Rudy said no, and invented a new NYC office to coordinate efforts through instead.

NYC police force is generally accepted at around 40,000 strong (at the time). Outnumbering ACOE(37,000) and FEMA (11,000)... Likely outnumbering both organizations outright in responders. Definitely outnumbering both plus more if you're counting firefighters(~11,000) and EMTs(~4,000) and the like.

Why is making an office to handle the process of the worst disaster that has basically ever happened to NYC an issue? Kind of requires some structure to manage all those people... And with over 50k people to manage for a single incident you kind of need *something*. A new office sounds about right. Also holding off on accepting aid when you don't even know where your own pieces are... also sounds pretty fucking reasonable.

>NYC Police, Fire, and Ambulances all received new radios in 2001, however they didn't work and had to be returned prior to September. Rudy was responsible for the no-bid contract on the defective radios.

Which is a problem of timing. Also, when you're outfitting probably 100,000+ radios... It makes sense to try to cut a corner(Edit: Even if it wasn't a corner cutting thing... might be a selection of specific requirements in radios) here or there since that could easily save 10$ a radio... you know... million dollars or so of savings. However, I don't know much about this... so there could be more to it that I'm not understanding... You certainly didn't link information that would expound on what happened.

>When it was discovered that toxic waste had been spread over a larger area than initially speculated Rudy told FEMA, ACE, and OSHA to stand down and left it to individual landlords to handle the toxic clean-up.

What makes you think that FEMA, ACE, and OSHA were equipped to handle it to begin with? I don't think you understand the sheer size of Manhattan. Also the shittiness of Landlords. Without a decree from above that Landlords needed to act on their own accord... all the above organizations would likely still be cleaning to this day and the Landlords would be sitting around with an excuse (Gotta wait for FEMA!) to let their tenants live in fucking HAZMAT conditions. Putting the onus on the people might have cause some additional exposure in the short term... but ends up being the better call in the long run.

>When during recovery Rudy prioritized the recovery of precious metals over the recovery of bodies.

Not in my experience as I knew people in the towers. But of course with that much debris and damage you have to move the shit somewhere to get the to the bodies to begin with. So some level of emphasis on moving the shit out of one of the most dense cities in the world make sense considering.

If you ever walk into you server area and smell something strong (ups alarms likely going off too) unplug that shit and leave the area taking as few breaths as possible.

homelab,fcbv4y2,t1_fcbsfo9,1577591321.0,"UPSes tend to be comprised on a bunch of smaller cells of 12v batteries meaning that just one or two of those cells have to leak not necessarily the whole pack....

Most die ""nicely"" I'd say it's maybe 1 in a couple thousand failures for a bad failure where you'll get swelling and sweating with possible leakage. We had a post a couple days ago about a guy smelling a weird smell... Which was a ups battery off-gassing/leaking and since most of the cells are laying sideways or even upside down in some UPS configurations, you're going to get leaks with these situations.

And the weight thing is really best practice of keeping the denser things lower. Which is why I admitted that I tend to he ""that guy"" in the first place.
