The only thing you'll have to monitor is the baking time, as more of the batter will be exposed to the heat, and it will likely bake faster."
dogs,ffjg491,t3_etym9z,1579997529.0,"Be honest - really, REALLY honest - with yourself about how much time and energy you can devote to exercising and caring for your dog. If you're a couch potato, don't get a breed that needs a ton of running/hiking/walking/playing, no matter how much you love the way that breed might look, and no matter what anyone tells you about specific breed lines that are ""more mellow""."
aww,ffjf8ma,t3_etyroi,1579996999.0,This made me incredibly happy.
MomForAMinute,ffjexpj,t1_ffjbw61,1579996820.0,Bravo! Back to crossing my fingers now :)
MomForAMinute,ffjamlf,t1_ffj8fps,1579994311.0,"Here's the reason why so many platitudes about life involve the word ""risk"": you don't get anywhere if you play it safe. Right now, I can hear you talking yourself out of doing anything that might mean you'd get hurt.

Consider this: if she's a wonderful girl, wouldn't she be honest and supportive of you? If you tell her you really like her and it's making you wonder whether taking a job back home will mean that's the end of the road for the two of you, what are her possible reactions? She can say, ""Yeah, long distance doesn't work for me"". She can say, ""I think you should go ahead and take the job back home."" She can say, ""I really hate that this has to happen now."" She can also say, ""I wish you didn't have to go.""

Stop making up her mind for her - that's rude. Tell her what's happening and talk about it. And if you seriously believe she's just going through the motions so she doesn't have to be ""the bad guy"", I need you to know that no woman I've ever met would willingly go out with someone to avoid this scenario. She'd develop a million really plausible reasons why she can't see you, but actually go out and spend time on something she feels is a dead-end? Nope.

Be brave. It's better to be brave and (possibly) disappointed than it is to be safe and forever wondering what might have happened if you only had the courage to jump and see."
MomForAMinute,ffj7lr4,t3_etxvda,1579992393.0,"Son, you're talking to the wrong woman, and deep down I think you know it :)

Go talk to her. Part of moving relationships to another level is to share concerns and talk them out. You don't have to tell her you love her - telling her you really like her is more than enough.

Ask for her opinion; how she answers will tell you everything you want to know about where she sees your relationship going.

I'm crossing all of my fingers - both for a good job, and for a good girl!"
MomForAMinute,ffiqeqc,t1_ffipjir,1579980125.0,"I see.

Well, you've named the two possible courses of action, so it really comes down to whether you need the closure of a definite ending or whether you are okay with the fade.

I'm not you, so this is really a question only you can answer. There have been some times in my life when I really needed to say my piece before closing a door, and others when the fade was just a better choice for everyone concerned.

If you don't feel you need to clarify anything to them before leaving, then just bow out and let that be the way it goes."
MomForAMinute,ffioueq,t3_etubtt,1579979030.0,"Hi, honey. 

Okay, let's do this logically. Remove me from the entire equation, because what they think and say about me doesn't matter, all right? They can't hurt me.

Let's talk about you instead. The great news about getting older is that you can choose your own friends and even build your own family if you want to. What do they bring to your life? Do they make you happy? Do they understand and support you? Is your life better because they're in it?

If the answer is yes to any of the above, my opinion is you should keep the door open.

If, however, they are more of an obligation due to history than a source of comfort and joy, you are well within your right to let them slip away from you.  Liam is not your responsibility or burden to carry. Encourage him to find help if he needs to talk, because you're not a doctor or a therapist. What we do as friends is share the good and the bad, and the street must go both ways - if he is merely leaning on you for support without knowing or caring about you and how YOU'RE doing, that's not a healthy friendship in my opinion (and this is leaving aside what happened when you were younger, which is a whole other and extremely disturbing topic).

A good philosophy to follow is to try to surround yourself with people, places, and activities that bring you joy, health, and peace. If you examine your relationships through that lens, it becomes easier to sort the good from the not-so-good.

I'm so sorry I made this all so complicated for you with the divorce. I'm still trying to follow the advice I'm giving you now, and I know I haven't always been clear in my choices."
