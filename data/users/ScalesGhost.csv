It got invented in the industrial revolution, a time in which employers had more workers than ever before. All this general stuff, like middle school, high school, college graduation is all for those people, so they can just take a look at a piece of paper and say yes or no, without actually, well, giving an actual shit about the person behind it."

climate,fck666k,t1_fck365i,1577717701.0,"So basically the government consisting of the two ""middle"" parties  (middle= not conservative nor liberal) made a so called ""Klimapaket"" which consists of every action they want to do against climate change. This includes a price for emitted CO2, which currently lays at 25€ per ton. (Thats way to low, by the way, cause 1 ton of CO2 causes damage that costs 180€ to compensate. Also, they want to shut down the Cole industry by 2038, and ""want to treat climate neutrality as a goal for 2050"", meaning they have signed no binding contracts AT ALL."

Amd,fc8ioi5,t1_fc8ihg8,1577535741.0,Yeah but should it really be 100%/30%? Could the GPU be broken somehow?
Amd,fc8gser,t1_fc8fyoh,1577534572.0,But should it be this extreme? I just used a bottleneck calculator and it says Ryzen 5 1600 and Radeon 580 should work great together. I mean I have the GPU on 100% and CPU and RAM on like 30%. Is this really it? Is the GPU that bad? Could the GPU have some technical problems?

radeon,fc6w9f3,t1_fc6vsi5,1577491120.0,That sounds not like something I'd be confident to do. Won't it reduce the lifespan of the CPU? And why do these games not use everything the CPU has?

So I've noticed that my PC is performing way worse than it should. I've got like two games with better graphics, Rise of the Tomb Raider and Descenders, and according to gamessystemrequirents AND canyourunthisgame AND the Radeon Settings UI I should be able to play both of these with 55 (Rise of the Tomb raider) to 60+ (Descenders) fps on the highest settings, but I have like an average of 40 fps at tomb raider (medium settings) and many freeze frames at Descenders, while the average fps are 70. I checked with Radeon and discovered, that, while only 30% percent of CPU and RAM get actually used, the GPU is running on 100%, so IT has to have the problem."
pcgaming,fag96qb,t3_e8q5bn,1576044387.0,Are RX cards like the 580 supported?
