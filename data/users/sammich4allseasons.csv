If he truly loves you then he needs to work at being an active listener, it's okay to have an argument to figure things out, so as long as everybody is mature about it and they hash everything out.

Speak from the heart, let him know what he did really hurt you and if he pulls away, then suggest that you two might need to take a break from each other.

I wish you both the best of luck, and a Merry Christmas."
