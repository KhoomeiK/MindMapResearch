3Dprinting,fef569n,t1_fedisfs,1579048433.0,"I would say it's likely this too, can't imagine what else. We had a formlabs machine with bubbles occurring near the laser that difracted the light and produced similar issues but I don't think that's it."
3Dprinting,fef4zfu,t1_fedncbj,1579048306.0,"Came here to say this, please don't pour anything resin printing related down the sink. Your devaluing all the hard work I put into bottling it up as toxic waste and disposing of it properly."
3Dprinting,fef4p58,t1_feerkbl,1579048112.0,"There's no info, I've been research g somthing similar."
3Dprinting,fef4nbz,t3_eos0ws,1579048079.0,Should work as long as it exposes to the correct wavelength of light.
ontario,fe31cty,t3_ekwdg7,1578844979.0,"This is crazy, needs to be changed. Antivax for any reason besides medical is fucking stupid. Opt out of Vax should be an automatic opt in for euthanasia."
ontario,fe2xbzm,t1_fdljauv,1578843923.0,"Well lots of people need to eat, so then you need lots of animals, then let's say the planning isn't the best so you have lots of animals and humans in contact, and that's how china gets sick. I hope that's answered your question."
ontario,fe2u13d,t1_fdmqb0c,1578842820.0,Lassoo and a skilled cowboy.
ontario,fe2qzkp,t1_fdomq3u,1578841919.0,Unfortunately these careers doesn't pay nearly enough and social workers etc put in so much to help others to only get shafted with the paycheck.

SuicideWatch,fcvtknq,t3_eis7xd,1578009794.0,"Ah the dream. I die every night for a bit but then I'm forced to wake up, not against my will but idk why I wake myself up."
SuicideWatch,fcvtd40,t1_fcvi2o7,1578009656.0,"Damn this guys funny, that made me laugh."
SuicideWatch,fcvt2l8,t3_eiyusu,1578009472.0,I can't really see myself writing much.
SuicideWatch,fcvt0h6,t3_ej31bn,1578009434.0,Try to become successful. That's what I'm doing I guess.
SuicideBereavement,fcvs8uv,t1_fcvhwev,1578008940.0,Lucky you
3Dprinting,fcr05wj,t3_eiijey,1577894829.0,"Your x limit switch is too close to the extrusion frame, so when the position of your extruder that contacts the limit switch moves there, another part is hitting first not triggering the switch and causing the noise. Move the switch closer to the object that switches it.


Wiring too.
Since you fixed it this is another solution."
3Dprinting,fcqzoj8,t3_eibcsw,1577894612.0,"Keep all of your shafts, linear bearings, steppers and anything else that's not wood/zip ties. There are tons of machines you could build with those components, one that comes to mind is a syringe extruder for your new ender 3."
3Dprinting,fcqzd7j,t1_fcpbd8f,1577894485.0,This is the way
3Dprinting,fcqz5ou,t1_fcp0nx7,1577894398.0,And why it's thriving
3Dprinting,fcqz0ui,t3_eibvz6,1577894338.0,Just write polaroid with a sharpie on a box and put your printer in it.
buildapc,fc4x92j,t1_fc4scan,1577432304.0,"Damn they got me, I figured I'd be fine with something else but the guy at Canada computers said Samsung is faster?"
buildapc,fc4wzfu,t1_fc4gads,1577431955.0,"Don't worry I was thinking the same earlier, dirt time builder. Makes sense though, look into negative/positive pressure arrangements for your fans."
buildapc,fc4vkz8,t3_eg4xlr,1577430191.0,Just finished my first build. Can confirm from the beginning when I was freaking out because the motherboard holes wouldn't line up perfectly to the end where I just wanted to get er done and stuffed everything in.
runescape,fbbbttg,t3_ec7t05,1576697201.0,Yeah I got hacked and lost years of my life. I'm not playing this game unless something is done about that.
