MakeNewFriendsHere,fdiyw4k,t1_fdiyko4,1578454227.0,Awww! My little Ewok has an underbite. Someone was a jerk at the puppy mill he came from and kicked him in the jaw so my little guy has always looked a little rough but dang is he not the cutest little buddy. Jacks likes to play and likes to nap. She‚Äôs currently snoring on my lap lol
TooAfraidToAsk,fdiyns6,t3_ellsaz,1578454068.0,The world is hard and cold. A lot of people are dealing with situational depression (when something sucks and you feel that it sucks) and others are dealing with long term depression (a cloud of apathy that dims everything in your world to shades of grey) it‚Äôs a difficult thing to live with long term or short term.
MakeNewFriendsHere,fdiybnv,t3_ellw4a,1578453837.0,"I have a weiner dog (apple jack, or Jacks for short) and a silky terrier(Ewok, he looks like a little Ewok). Jacks is much younger and is very playful and Ewok is a grumpy little old man. They are just the sweetest babies to. Ewok was rescued and was a mean little guy and now he‚Äôs just a love and Jacks was gifted to me because she‚Äôs a mix of a miniature weiner dog and a big one, so she‚Äôs puppy sized forever. They are good dogs and I love when they love up on each other."

AskReddit,fcdw5tx,t3_eh49fq,1577614416.0,"Well, for me , it is really simple. I am extremely shy and such and so I have that bit of soft confidence (like having the ability to ask for something you want etc) that I can ask for and say what I mean without the crippling fear of abandonment of I disagree, that I normally deal with."
relationship_advice,fcdu0dt,t3_eh4a2d,1577613825.0,"Truth is it‚Äôs hard. Being in a relationship where things get to the point of abuse is hard. The problem is when you love someone, those feelings and thoughts stick with you for a while. I know it‚Äôs hard right now, but I promise if you give yourself enough time and space, you can and will recover.
