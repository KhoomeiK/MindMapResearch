I can't stand how people act like the smartphone is the very first invention we made to help shut out those around us. Sometimes we just need a break. I think it speaks more to human nature than society."
confessions,ffb7mnh,t3_eskb8v,1579754092.0,"Hi there. I'm sorry you feel conflicted about this, bud, because you did the right thing.

I'm no fan of religion. But the *one* thing I see legitimacy in is comfort. People use gods like comfort blankets. Life is scary! I can't fault them. I have my own versions.

You gave a dying man a chance to feel comfort. You are a hero!"
ChoosingBeggars,ffa93gm,t1_ffa6sqd,1579730277.0,"Ah, I see. In my home state, Florida, they have a similar law. A grocery store cant sell liquor but they can have a standalone liquor store. Most of them that I saw did. I'm thinking of a chain called Publix mostly.

Here in Washington they can sell liquor in grocery stores too. It means that liquor stores are actually pretty rare.

I was working in Arizona for a month or so and they sell liquor everywhere, even in gas stations!

Its wild how much certain things vary state to state."

https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/WMT/walmart/net-profit-margin

Costco is exactly the opposite of Walmart to me, and that's why they are thriving. Its great to shop there, great to work there. They know how to retain people and that is going to raise them to the top. They also have great prices on liquor :D"
ChoosingBeggars,ff96j0j,t1_ff8m1y5,1579706011.0,"Oh I hear you on that. I've been learning that lesson a lot the last couple years, and I understand, partially from experience, that being poor is expensive. Walmart is sort of like the Jerry Springer show; it holds a mirror up to our society."
ChoosingBeggars,ff7wri6,t1_ff5efjf,1579660196.0,"I understand how my comment came off like a defense of Walmart. The point I should have clarified is that a company like that can't exist if they compensate their workers well. So, they shouldn't exist. We have a society that propels a shitty company like Walmart near the top and that is the real problem."
ChoosingBeggars,ff7wkef,t1_ff5f8ue,1579660065.0,"Look man I hate Walmart too and I realize that what I said sounds like a defense of them. But, in this case, (just to be factual) Walmart makes 2.3% profit. 

The end goal here is that we need a society that doesn't allow a shitty company like Walmart to be so successful they have 25 fucking percent of the produce sales in this country. Did you know that?

I have managed to avoid shopping there at all and it feels decent."
ChoosingBeggars,ff7w9el,t1_ff5vuue,1579659857.0,"This was, frankly, a stupid beehive to stick my head in.

Because I hate the way Walmart runs too... their entire *structure* is flawed. I can understand how it came out like I support Walmart or some bullshit. No. I've actually not shopped there in some time and I'm very slightly proud of that."

ChoosingBeggars,ff4rl9u,t1_ff4pjm8,1579570753.0,Labor accounts for roughly a third of operating costs in the service business. If you have to increase the only somewhat malleable part of your operating costs then you have to increase prices. Walmart's whole thing is the lowest prices. So they either somehow reduce their labor force or they raise prices.
ChoosingBeggars,ff4oz1j,t1_ff4inbm,1579568948.0,"Well, honestly, if Walmart tried to unionize it would probably destroy their whole business structure. I doubt they could survive without cheap labor."
ChoosingBeggars,ff4ov5w,t1_ff4964d,1579568873.0,"Eh, as someone that worked for a union, they suck. They smacked of corruption (they had voting for our new contract but scheduled it in such a way that the vast majority of people couldn't vote on it) and never did jack shit for me except take 50 bucks a month out of my paycheck. I'm glad I'm not under them anymore."

Regardless, I can look a lot better than I do now."
amiugly,fdhpl1j,t1_fdfmbgs,1578427629.0,"Well, to be fair my last comment was over the top. She isnt actually shallow very much at all, she wouldn't *actually* leave me, it's just she clearly has a strong preference for beards. I knew this before we got together, lol.

I appreciate your concern. I wouldn't be with someone that obsessed with looks."
amiugly,fdhpf3x,t1_fdfrims,1578427529.0,"Yeah this is a great attitude, you have to be willing to fuck up to make mistakes. I think I should get back into baking and cooking more, I've gotten really lazy about it at home. Or maybe I need something not at all tied to my profession, because I'm a cook, lol.

I really appreciate your insight man and I hope you have a great day.

I feel 100% better than when I posted this and I have some great ideas now too :)"
amiugly,fdgrml8,t1_fdgpvp7,1578406534.0,Thanks my dude. The amount I've gotten from this post has been incredible. I'm definitely taking the advice :)
beards,fdgoyeq,t1_fdforgw,1578404421.0,Thanks for the tips :)
amiugly,fdflg2p,t1_fdfd15v,1578364440.0,I completely agree with your first paragraph (pretty insightful honestly) but I disagree with the second. But frankly in some way it doesn't bother me if she sleeps with someone else. It's her heart I want to be mine. Sex is different.
amiugly,fdfla8x,t1_fdfgm3l,1578364334.0,"Its cracking me up you mention hipster glasses. Guess which kind I had before these? I wanted something totally different... went too far. So back to the classic black rims again. I think I'll combine your advice with some others and get the kind that only have black rims on the top, I get the sense it would look good on me.

And yeah another takeaway from these comments is to get my barber involved with my beard. I found a really good stylist last time and she even offered to trim the beard. I'm gonna really go to town when I get a haircut in a week or two (work prevents me from doing it sooner, lol)

Your second paragraph cracked me up. You're exactly right. I've been exercising more and it helps, but more muscle definitely would be nice. Right now I'm mostly skinny with only a little hint of muscle definition, mostly in my arms.

Mostly this change I want to undertake is so I feel good in my own body again. Once I have some confidence back I have a feeling that a lot of how I think she feels about me is my own poor self esteem. And yeah, mental health is another of the things I'm working on.

So far, my main source of confidence is my job and not much outside that. I'm working on my social skills a lot more this year, I need to find that *thing* outside of my job, too."
amiugly,fdfcv9r,t1_fdfc9wy,1578358706.0,"Hmm ok, I wasn't sure if those would fit my face well but thanks for the suggestion!"

amiugly,fdfcoov,t1_fdf8y69,1578358582.0,"Yeah, that seems to be the two consistent comments I'm getting here. I'd already planned on new glasses but I'll change the beard too."
amiugly,fdfcmez,t1_fdf9wz0,1578358539.0,"It isnt what shes directly said, just a general feeling I get. I just want to feel sexy again.

amiugly,fdf598i,t1_fdet9fs,1578353611.0,"Fair enough man, I appreciate your input.

I recognize the key here is I mostly need a look that makes me feel more attractive. My lack of confidence is, I'm sure, hurting this situation."
amiugly,fdf54rl,t1_fdeu7ji,1578353529.0,"I am. One of them is for me to work on myself. 

I haven't always been the best at listening to her needs but I really want to change that."
amiugly,fdf50j0,t1_fdeylmb,1578353452.0,"Well I haven't made any big changes, but frankly that's part of the problem. I've sort of let myself go, or that is how I perceive it. We've been together for almost 8 years so what worked for me then won't automatically work now. Its time to be more creative."

I think my main takeaway is I need to figure out some interests first, and then I can start trying to make friends. I'm ""in between"" hobbies so to speak. But you've given me a lot of good ideas.

A little context: I'm 30, and have never managed to have much in the way of friends. It feels like theres something I'm not getting.

If it wasn't for having a job where I'm on my feet all day, walking to and from work (around 5-6 miles combined), smoking cannabis pretty frequently (3-4 times a day), and usually only eating one meal a day, I would never feel hungry either.

The only time I can manage to act happy is at work. Work is basically the only positive left in my life. I've slowly given up on all the passions and interests I had. I'm going to end up a drunk if I keep going how I have been.

The worst part is, earlier this year I thought I had made significant progress... until I stopped one antidepressant, mirtazapine, that helped me a lot. It stopped fitting into my lifestyle as much so I stopped on it. Recession. Then, a couple months ago, I tried again with Lexapro. After 4 days of that devil medicine I was the most suicidal and *crazy* feeling I have been since I was a teenager. All that progress was a lie.
