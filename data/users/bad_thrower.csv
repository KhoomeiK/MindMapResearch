AskVegans,fekocfk,t1_feh5nc6,1579204230.0,">Because of this, most meat-eating parents choose not  to tell their child where their food comes from until they are older. When they do, they use vague or innocent-sounding terms such as ""bacon comes from  pigs"", or ""pigs give us bacon"". I personally think that this is deceptive. If a child saw footage of what happens on a factory farm or in a slaughterhouse, they would be traumatised, and for good reason.

Interesting story... several years ago I worked with a woman who had started a backyard chicken coop populated with eight hens and a rooster. Their daughter was especially attached to one of the chickens and considered her a pet. While the family had no intention of actually slaughtering any of those chickens, they were meat-eaters and happily purchased chicken at the store on a regular basis.

Their daughter (4 years old) was eating a drumstick one day and asked where it came from. My co-worker just deflected the question and changed the subject, but was laboring over what to tell her daughter, as she had this pet chicken that she adored and even named. She didn't know how to explain to her daughter that she was eating a piece of the same kind of animal that she hugged and petted every day, because she knew it would send her into an emotional tailspin.
