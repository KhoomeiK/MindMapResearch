aww,ff4370b,t1_ff3jxks,1579554545.0,My dog used to angry growl at me if I donâ€™t share food with him haha. I had to start putting my foot down and stop giving in because it is obviously not healthy for him to have a lot of people foods (on top of all his regular food) and it also makes it stressful for me to eat.
