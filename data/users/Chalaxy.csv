todayilearned,ff4xlda,t1_ff4uo2x,1579574874.0,"Less teams doesn't equate to more skill. Just more opportunities for top tier players.  I wouldn't say talent itself was way down but sports nutrition, medicine and just general knowledge  allow talent to push themselves  much closer to a genetic limit in modern times."
todayilearned,ff4wk3m,t1_ff4ldq4,1579574162.0,Yeah the goon squad would obliterate you haha
todayilearned,ff4whc4,t1_ff4enun,1579574108.0,"Exactly. You can argue all day about the goalies effectiveness in that era but all players had equal opportunity to score. Plus, Gretzky would still be top tier in today's games lol."
todayilearned,ff4w1m2,t1_ff4gqke,1579573811.0,This is what I was looking for. The comparison from then and now makes you realize just how talented Gretzky was and how he could still dominate the modern era. What a beast.

hardbodies,fdo5h3l,t1_fdev63w,1578599235.0,"To a degree. You usually dont see abs regardless until a low body fat percentage. Women can generally have visible abs at a higher percentage compared to a Man. So you can have the muscle but the definition comes from having very little body fat more so than building abdominals muscles. ""Abs are made in the kitchen"" is pretty accurate."
