I'm sorry you're having a tough time with this. Maybe talking to a therapist could help you? They could help you find closure. At the same time, talking to your ex and the friend of yours may be important. 

I've had an almost similar experience, not suicide though. But the cries of my little sister, begging me not to leave her, is the last memory of hers i have when we were forcefully parted. And it hurts and has haunted me for long-time better part of 18 years now. Things are better though"
SuicideWatch,ffimcxn,t3_etsvym,1579977324.0,"Hey @SmushyKidK,

It's tough, what you're going through and the experiences you've had. You're tougher, that you've been feeling this way for so long and yet, you have held on, persevered and put on a brave face. 
Ita tough to be brave and show what people see. I got tired of it, of hiding it and let whoever see and say what they want to. 

Anyway, maybe calling the given numbers has not worked for you. Perhaps you've met people but things didn't connect for you. But, is there something you care about? Something you effortlessly would wish to work on and see flourish? Someone maybe? It may not be everything you want, but it could be worth a try. Just a try to see the difference."

I feel bad that teens are not given a proper voice to talk about issues that affect them, as if they are just vessels. But, I'm optimistic your situations will work out well."
