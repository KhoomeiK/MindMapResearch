AskReddit,ffgy5lx,t1_ffgalnw,1579918076.0,Women perpetuate toxic masculinity just as much or maybe even more than men do.

politics,ffavtb6,t1_ffatq5l,1579745656.0,"It's also a whole lot more calorie dense per ounce since it's dry. I buy expensive cat food in small bags and it'd still feed a person for a day on less than $4. It's cheap as fuck. 7000 calories for $13.

Ramen is like $1 a day though, so it's not comparable to that, but for the amount of protein it has it's pretty amazingly cheap. Maybe the cheapest thing with that much protein would be dollar menu burgers and that'd be $5/day."
politics,ffau1mj,t1_ffad8y4,1579744485.0,Following their line of thought just serves to help muddy the waters and move the goalposts. No point in analyzing their bullshit that much since they don't even mean it.
politics,ffatajf,t1_ffakina,1579743986.0,I think it's more like 80% are dumb as shit but only half of those are also malicious and watch Fox news.
politics,ffasyql,t1_ffajha7,1579743768.0,"I think it's more fundamental than that, they're all just corrupt pieces of shit who will do anything to gain/maintain power and enrich themselves. Russia doesn't even need to blackmail them. They are fundamentally on the same side as Russian oligarchs, the side of personal enrichment and fascism. No blackmail needed when they are already on the same side.

I have no doubt they are blackmailing Trump though, because he's too fucking stupid to stay in line unless they threaten him, and he's so easy to blackmail as a serial rapist."

nextfuckinglevel,ff4x6zt,t1_ff4n7hl,1579574598.0,That's still cheaper than insurance in the US. But the proposed legislation in the US is 4% of income which would only be like $5000/yr for a family.
SandersForPresident,ff4tggm,t1_ff4l77p,1579572038.0,The problem is the rich. The Democratic party has a few people who don't represent the rich though.
YouShouldKnow,ff40o1n,t1_ff1znpu,1579552979.0,"Ah, gotcha. Yeah, sending stuff into space would still have a cost of the labor embodied in all the materials of the vehicle we sent to space, and the labor it took to launch it.

I'm not sure how I got off on the tangent I did now."

YouShouldKnow,ff1rqb5,t1_ff1f2xr,1579484708.0,"Yes, that's not how our economy currently works on the large scale, but that's how a wartime economy works because the inputs, mainly food and housing and etc for the workers, would be taken by force, or coerced in some way. But you could consider it like a tax, just a tax where a certain % of production is taken rather than money.

The economy doesn't need a market to function though, we've just chosen that because it's relatively hands-off and it allowed an incredibly complex economy to sprout up on it's own."
YouShouldKnow,ff1qpk7,t1_ff1bsm0,1579484075.0,"Yeah, like I said, their labor has value. Something else of value only has to be exchanged directly for it in a market though. You don't pay them for their labor because you're acting cooperatively.

In a more formal relationship there would be accounting of that value and some way for it to balance out, but it doesn't have to be done via a market/money. 

Because we do have a market economy it'd probably need to be done by force for expediency. Food and housing and etc for the workers probably wouldn't be handed over willingly because it would cut into profits. Doing all that exchange in a way that left everyone happy would take more time to get right than we would have."
YouShouldKnow,ff16omm,t1_ff0ae2t,1579475762.0,"Cost comes from competition. Things still have value if produced cooperatively, but they can be exchanged without cost.

For example, dinner is free if your partner makes it, even though his/her labor is worth something."

BlackPeopleTwitter,fem52fo,t1_fem2hr6,1579240030.0,Tbh any brown tinted glasses have the same effect of making the outdoors look awesome. I think you can get transitions in brown. It's like the yellow filter they're always using in happy movies
BlackPeopleTwitter,fem4r3z,t1_fem4587,1579239720.0,"If you order the sunglasses online you can get them for about the same as you'd pay with insurance, like $50 or so. The transition coating costs like $200 at a regular retailer, or $70 online so it might actually be cheaper to have a second pair."

politics,fem3zg7,t1_fegu7as,1579238977.0,That's my point. The rich and powerful in the Democratic party are still right wing... So his correction that it was both parties and not just the right wing made no sense.

BlackPeopleTwitter,fem3j1r,t1_felp514,1579238556.0,"What? They can be put in any frame. Typical small eyeglass frames make super nerdy sunglasses though.

But nice sunglasses like aviators look pretty nerdy as eyeglasses, so you really can't win unless you look good in like a medium sized round frame."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fem37yu,t3_epro03,1579238268.0,"I used to have them and they suck. Just have two pairs of prescription glasses instead, it costs about the same and you aren't fucking blind whenever you walk into a building, and they actually work in the main place you need sunglasses, in the car. Unless you've got your windshield tinted to 10%, then you're all set.

They really are for anxious nerds who think managing two pairs of glasses is somehow too complicated to cope with. Which is why they appealed to me in the first place."

CasualUK,fejprn0,t1_fejmgbi,1579182704.0,"Every router I've ever owned had to be reset occasionally, but the cheap ones more often. They all have wank ass firmware with memory leaks or something and just stop working after so many hours powered on."
