Then you have to travel to the Rock Homeworlds (a hostile sector, marked in red) and there you have a chance to run into this special event that will take you to the secret sector. You don't have to bother with these Stasis pods."

ftlgame,fejgagi,t3_epheev,1579172846.0,"I certainly hope! I have been waiting for this feature for years! Whenever I mentioned it in Steam forums, people told me that the devs originally didn't integrate it from the beginning, so adding it postpone was much harder than normal and because the game is already old, they wouldn't bother to invest time for such a feature. Seeing this makes me positive at least SOMEONE is working on it!"
