I heard that the Liangzhou Rebellion was costlier than the Yellow Turban rebellion to put down so I'm curious to see the details here.

Would make other starts a lot better retroactively. Creating new factions out of thin air wouldn't be something I'm intersted in for such a start personally.

Napoleon matched up much more closely with Empire covering very close time periods and Napoleon expanding on the gameplay introduced in Empire with a lot of the same stuff being used and developed further. Then Shogun 2 and FOTS while technically not seperate games very much follow the same pattern of basing one set of content off of another and expanding and changing stuff around. And finally there is Attila and Rome 2, with Attila(at least, until Rome 2's updates) basicaly functioning as a refinement of what we got in Rome 2 with a new setting and coat of(very brown) paint.

totalwar,ff77d99,t3_erx083,1579642571.0,"There are 3 main non-chapter pack DLCs I want:  


One: The Yue tribes. This DLC would add the Yue to the southeast part of the map. I'd imagine they'd have a very sort of guerilla warfare approach to fighting. Very few cavalry, at most a sort of ""Shanyue Scout Cavalry"" unit, nothing else. Lots of archers, poison, vanguard deployment and an emphasis on non-conventional tactics. Shi Xie should be part of the DLC(there aren't that many Yue characters) and have a sort of mixed Han and Yue roster(he would likely have ruled over a majority Nanyue population). He'd have a Nanyue roster but he might have a few Han units like some heavier infantry and better cavalry or something. They could have some cool events where he decides to establish himself firmly as either a chinese or Yue leader, with benefits for either. For example If he goes with the Yue he gets some elite Yue units and campaign bonuses to public order and relations with other Yue factions while if he decides to go stay firmly Chinese he gets access to some elite Chinese inspired units including some heavy cavalry. Maybe a slight map expansion south into northern Vietnam.+

&#x200B;

Two: The Qiang rebellion. You could argue this should be it's own chapter pack but MoH kind of invalidates it. You get a roster with a heavy emphasis on cavalry but still some infantry(the Qiang were still agriculturalists, they weren't steppe nomads), could also feature some Yuezhi units who maybe have some specialization(the Yuezhi are the same group that formed the Kushan Kingdom covering parts of India and Persia, some stayed behind and eventually found themselves joining the Qiang rebellion). Probably lots of cavalry tactics but I don't imagine they'd be too heavily equipped, the Qiang were poor and this was a rebellion, it'd be cool to reflect that. Han Sui would definitely be included in the Qiang roster, and for unique characters they could have Beigong Boyu start off already playable in the Mandate of Heaven Start. There was also a character by the name of Song Jian who would be in both the 182 and 190 starts. IMO as an aside in the 182 start owning the Liang rebellion DLC should allow you to play Ma Teng in the 182 start but instead of his 190 roster he instead has the Qiang roster(but he shouldn't get the Qiang roster in the 190 start). This DLC would also hopefully expand the map a bit further west to add Gansu(where Song Jian would start) and the rest of the Qiang homeland.

&#x200B;

For more info since it's interesting "" **S**ong Jian was a man from either Longxi or Fuhan who participated in the Liang rebellion on the side of the insurgents. *Xiandi Chunqiu* states that he might have been of Yuezhi stock (like Beigong Boyu). His exact role in the revolt against the Han is unclear. After the Han general Huangfu Song inflicted a devastating defeat on the forces of Liang, the rebellion was greatly weakened. However, three main leaders emerged in the West led by Song Jian, Han Sui and Ma Teng. Song Jian declared himself King of the Sources of the River Who Will Pacify Han and continued to keep independence for several decades. He set up reign titles and followed Han customs. His territory encompassed Didao and Lintao, with his capital at Fuhan. Eventually, Cao Caos general Xiahou Yuan attacked Fuhan and defeated Song Jian. Song Jian and his ministers were put to death. ""

&#x200B;

Three: Nomad DLC. The Nomads would be basically all cavalry all the time. Cavalry Micro or death when it comes to playing as them. Your only infantry should be piss poor nomad footmen and archers and maybe some access to basic Han infantry once you conquer Han territory. There are three main factions of note to add. One would be the Southern Xiongyu under the leader Yufuluo. He had a bit of a wild story and while we don't know much about him he is pretty interesting as he basically had a wild ride as a mercenary leader across the north trying whatever he could to eek out a living for the Xiongnu. He was the grandfather of Liu Yuan who went on to be a leader in the barbarian uprisings against the Jin dynasty(IE what happens after 8 Princes). Then there are the Wuhuan, who allied with the Yuan clan and who fought against Cao Cao at the battle of White Wolf Mountain and the Xianbei, who would be one of the dominant nomad groups in the coming centuries in northern china.

totalwar,ff2zuoa,t1_ff2pv9g,1579529841.0,I just wish there was a Koei-esque system where you could go out and ask for a character or send someone to recruit a character who maybe isn't on the map yet.
logh,ff2zpd0,t1_ff2z0in,1579529717.0,"It's just a feeling man. I'm not the type of person to ever really ""ship"" people, but this one just feels right. It's just an observation based on a lot of stuff, I feel like there are a lot more scenes where Reinhard says stuff about Kircheis and not as many where Kircheis does the opposite. I'm not saying that Reinhard ever actually acted on anything, obviously not. But I do think there was a seed there is all."
logh,ff2v2cr,t1_ff1vgup,1579525294.0,"Okay, I should have said he's bi. But I don't see how it doesn't ""make sense"" for this character to have perhaps at one point have had some feelings for Kircheis beyond what Kircheis had for him."
worldnews,ff1s5ve,t1_fexl3us,1579484982.0,I was under the impression that the Aboriginees were hunter-gatherers? Is this a new development?
worldnews,ff1q2us,t1_ff1jymy,1579483667.0,A president cant interfere with local affairs. It's bad precedent.

dankmemes,ff0gqxv,t1_fez4xea,1579468718.0,"Then it isn't a meme and because hes a talentless hack he wanted to use a shitty ""format"" so he could share the image to get brownie points on reddit. Hes proud of it too, even fucking watermarked it."
cyberpunkgame,fewfs59,t1_fevnoxy,1579409861.0,Yeah. Plenty of expansions in the past were like that. Not directly adding to the main game but being a side thing.
totalwar,fevxsf8,t1_fevp5pc,1579402869.0,"I think the idea was that it was super common for her to become a faction leader so they decided to make her unique. Plus there is little chance of her ever getting officially done and so overriding MTU's work(I cant say the same for Gao Shun however, I think it's super likely he'll be made unique).

Also IMO the model doesnt fit for Lu Lingqi at all, and she isnt an actual 3 kingdoms character either to boot."
AskReddit,fev84kq,t1_fetbj4x,1579394331.0,All the fucking time. It's so bizarre.
totalwar,feshk1u,t3_eqa543,1579365223.0,They should change it to 16 in the main campaign IMO.

HistoryMemes,fes075j,t1_ferywn3,1579360136.0,"No. All Asians dont even look the same dude. Not anymore than all white people look the same. Asians though are their own group much more because of how they reached Asia, tens of thousands of years ago asians came to the steppe and down into China, Korea, Southeast asia etc. They also mixed with a human cousin species we call the Denisovans at the time."

logh,fepl8dl,t1_feoczga,1579323438.0,I know its unpopular but I always assumed Reinhard had some unexpressed feelings for Kircheis personally. But Kircheis definitely wasn't gay ofc. He was all about Annerose. Literally joined the future Kaiser of space because his sister gave him his first boner.
logh,fepl35y,t1_feo1rbn,1579323328.0,"I dont think there will be too much race swapping needed. The lead of one of the factions is an asian male, his superior above all other superiors and leader of the military is a black man, Julian's only sort of of-age friend is black(though IMO Mashengo's role could be expanded dramatically for the FPA, he was a bit underdeveloped), Murai is Asian too. At most I could see them making a lot of the background characters different races, and some less important sides."
totalwar,feol22n,t1_fenk9cu,1579301617.0,"Man it's really clear this DLC was rushed. If it came out with all the above I'd gladly accept waiting another 2 months(since frankly a lot of your points aren't necessarily bugs but just poor design) for the dlc to come out. The fanbase was just so goddman impatient, CA probably felt pressured. I just hope that they consider doing a massive update to the dlc to incorporate some of your suggestions."
