technology,fdbyqh4,t3_ekbmv0,1578263991.0,"I work at an NHS hospital as an IT Project Manager.

I can tell you that the main problems come from 2 areas:

\- Managerial  
\- Supplier

Hospital management have to decide how much of their budget goes to IT instead of critical services, for trusts that are in the RED, this is a difficult call as all services clam for money, however many don't manage to spend all of the allocated budget, so at the end of the year, there is a frantic spend to get anything because if you don't spend it - that amount is removed from the following budget next year (crazy I know), even if you need it.

On top of this, there is rarely an IT representative at board level, usually IT director will report to someone else (like finance) who is on the board, which is crazy because finance have no idea on the importance of IT.

There are more issues but they are minor in comparrison (human resourcing mainly)

&#x200B;

Then there's the suppliers - some of the healthcare applications I have seen are down right illegal. I've had a project manager from finance, on a mission to reduce spending on dictation, so he wanted to rush software in that offloaded to a server in the EU - fine, but this was recordings of patient information and it saved all recordings on the local PC before being uploaded onto the remote server, and then the passwords to access software and information was in plain text. Didn't even need the software as we could just remote access the server! I cancelled that one and finance asked for a different IT PM lol! the infrastructure team couldn't believe it.

But then we have even more critical systems like PAS (patient account systems) that hold ALL patient identifiable data or their results, and these systems are unbelievably bad.

These systems haven't been developed since the 00's and so there is no MVC, not even normal styling on them and use Iframes. The system would LITERALLY go down if 20 people logged into the system at the same time, and this was ORACLE! We were in the process to moving to MSSQL however... that's a downgrade! we didn't have the funds to support in house oracle devs. took 4 years to migrate."
technology,fdbwqty,t1_fd9s1ry,1578263070.0,"each hospital manages its own IT infrastructure so this isn't entirely true, each hospital dedicates its own budget to IT, so not a national problem, more of a local one, unfortunately IT is not considered important by management."
