We, as women, need to be equally as active in making something happen. If you didn't purposely try to touch him, he may have thought you were uncomfortable and so he held off as well.

TwoXSex,fe2bkhm,t3_enmr3z,1578836572.0,"Years ago I was drugged at a club. I had 2 drinks and ""blacked out"". (Still up, walking, talking but no memory and bad motor control.) Once I started vomiting profusely my best friend figured out what was up and took my to the hospital for a lovely round of stomach pumping and charcoal. I only have fragmented memories of that night - riding with my head up the car window, vomiting weakly, some weird unknown guy who kept telling best friend he'd seen this happen before and he could take care of me in the break room of the club so she could keep partying (pretty sure he was the culprit), how goddamn awful drinking activated charcoal is and how hard it is to fight your gag reflex.

You can go to the ER and let them know you were likely drugged. Many of those drugs will still show in a tox screen. Plus a bag of IV saline would honestly make you feel 100x better.

To this day, 20 something years later, I will only drink something I watched a bartender make. I will toss a drink if it's been out of my eyesight. My hand, and usually a napkin stays over the top of my glass so it's more difficult for someone to stealthily pour something in. I will NOT have that occur again."
AskWomen,fdlyo2j,t1_fdlxwuf,1578535644.0,"I'm hypothyroid. Those were my main symptoms. Especially the cold. I never was warm unless it was summer or I was in a hot bath.
My levels came back ""very low side of normal"" but my doctor began treatment with medication based on my symptoms. It helped so, so much.

Shop around for a doctor that not only takes cash pay patients but will put lab tests on his account. My doctor does this. He charges me about $20 per blood test for most routine tests (if they are super fancy tests he charges me more). If I were to cash pay at the lab, those tests would cost me around $120 to $180 each. Doctor accounts get a substantial discount from the lab.

Good luck to you!"
AskWomen,fdlwxfy,t1_fdl0uhd,1578534467.0,"Serious question: How was it diagnosed as not PCOS? PCOS doesn't have to have cysts to fall under that label, if that's what the Gyn used to disqualify it. It's a whole metabolic disorder with several other characteristics. 

Other than that, thyroid disorders are common period inhibitors. There are a few other hormone disorders that could cause it as well.

AmItheAsshole,fdfneue,t1_fdf78ka,1578365725.0,"I agree. I don't think there is anything wrong with wanting to get some work done. I'd love to get a boob job even now at 43!

But, have realistic expectations. Hips are still going to be wider. Stretch marks are still going to be present. Scars from surgery will be leftover. Even future fat distribution will likely be affected (I think, I very well may be wrong on this!)

datingoverforty,fdbzpr2,t3_ekhr74,1578264410.0,"Dealbreakers for me:

1. Got to love dogs. I have an extremely high intelligence and energy level dog. This means I have to spend a lot of time each day wearing him out. Fetch, walks, learning/practicing tricks, puzzle games, even just taking him with me to run errands whenever feasibly possible. If he doesn't get worn out he can get destructive or nippy. He does sleep in bed with me, unless I tell him not to. He is trained very well. But because I'm going to have to continue to include him in a large portion of my time for the rest of my life, it's best if guys are not just good with that, but great with that. Let's take the dogs camping, or kayaking with us!

2. No super screamer politic/religious pushers. I can get along with just about everyone, but if you can't have have a discussion about politics or religion without either screaming or getting butthurt then GTFO. And if your entire FB is bashing one political party or the other, I don't want you either. Being hateful isn't an attractive personality. 

3. Expecting me at your beck and call 24/7. I don't work like that. If I'm at work, I'm at work. I will not pick up my phone for an hour long pointless conversation. Likewise, I won't sit there and text ""I love you more"" back and forth 100x. It's ridiculous. 
If I have my child that week, and we are early in the relationship I will NOT sneak away for a quickie NOR allow you to come over at 2 am to get a piece of ass. We can work time together around her activities easily. She has many. If that's too difficult, then bye-bye."

Sometimes we (those of us with anxiety and depression) have to take small steps in self care. 
Don't have the energy for a shower? Lay in the bath. 

Don't have the energy for a bath? Change the clothes you're wearing and wipe down important bits with wet wipes.

Don't have the energy to brush your teeth? Swoosh some mouth wash.

Don't have the energy to make a sandwich? Just eat the lunch meat and bread separately. I often just grab a few slices of lunch meat and a slice of cheese and head back to the comfort of my bed.

legaladvice,fcwh2uu,t3_ej0b8q,1578025443.0,"Diatomaceous earth saved my freaking sanity years ago when we found bedbugs in our house thanks to a houseguest bringing them in.

We bagged all stuffed animals/bedding up in large trash bags and put them in the shed/attic in the hot South summer heat. Steam cleaned carpets and mattresses. Put mattress covers on all beds and then shoved diatomaceous earth in every tiny crack and crevice I could find. Including in the mattress covers, between couch cushions, along the corners of the walls, etc. 

I might have used my body weight in that stuff. It was worth it. Where the sprays and chemicals from the stores and exterminators failed that diatomaceous earth succeeded. 

Now I keep some on hand at all times to put tiny amounts under sinks to ward off any other bug invaders."

TwoXSex,fcicogv,t1_fcgovzl,1577660589.0,"As for what it feels like, think back to when you first started trying to use tampons. Especially if you ever got curious on a day when you weren't bleeding or were just barely, barely spotting, and tried using a super absorbent tampon. You know that feeling of how they kind of got stuck because you were way too dry, and then you didn't put the applicator in correctly so the tampon wasn't in all the way? It felt irritated and sore/painful?

It's going to feel a bit like that, only more so (because a penis has a larger girth than a tampon). Which is why foreplay, foreplay, foreplay is so important! And taking your time. And communication. 

You want to make sure your vagina is relaxed and lubricated and that the guy doesn't just try to shove his penis in in one big push. Easy does it, a little back and forth, lots of kissing and touching help."

My 15 year old daughter told me last year, I think, that she was an atheist. I was pleasantly surprised. I've been on the agnostic-atheist spectrum most of my life but I never brought it up to her as I wanted her to find her own path. And we live in a tiny rural, Southern U.S. town that is pretty religious, not being a believer can make life a bit harder here. I've grown accustomed to just keeping my beliefs to myself. 

She occasionally will attend church with friends or family, but her father and I never stressed religion as a primary importance. Instead we focused on core values."
