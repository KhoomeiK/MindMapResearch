If you're basing whether you can date someone based on if they're in any ""league"" your relationship will fail because the foundation upon which it is built is rotted. Instead, you should find someone you enjoy being around and makes you feel warm and happy. One that you get along with and have things in common with.

I currently do have meaning in my life i just don't know if it's enough to want to live for. I'm very passionate about writing and i won't allow myself death until i have finished all my works, which'll take several years. Maybe things will be different in a few years, maybe my writing will be fulfilling enough. However, I've always though that in addition to what i have now, i needed that missing piece to feel like it was worth living, i needed to fall in love.
