When they can say ""well fuck so and so because they're cruel"", then they're gonna war crime us right back. Using WP is awful and a war crime, but if the enemy is already doing war crimes, all bets are off.

AskMen,ff9k8q2,t1_ff97blg,1579714771.0,The irony of you talking about diversion is rich.
AskMen,ff9k6m0,t1_ff97blg,1579714737.0,"No, it's that thing I said."
AskMen,ff8pdup,t1_ff85j5o,1579690266.0,"You noticed I didn't take your bait. Worry less about the overly precise meaning of underdog you've concocted and more about your inclination to make a vast assumption about someone you know nothing about. And trolling people on the internet doesn't constitute ""fighting"" so take your own advice."
AskMen,ff8nqz0,t1_ff85fxu,1579687814.0,That's because you may as well ask people to a dog shit eating contest.

AskMen,ff756be,t1_ff723i6,1579641339.0,It is fictitious because you're assuming it happened. You're also ignoring the amount of missing info you don't have. And it's also not the only reason.
AskMen,ff751s8,t1_ff72fy0,1579641268.0,It was like 6 posts ago when I was checking to see if surely you're just a troll. Are you high now?
AskMen,ff74yml,t1_ff72o58,1579641217.0,Interesting that you want to reframe this to be about some sort of underdog story instead of your shitty opinions.
AskMen,ff6lge0,t1_ff6kksf,1579629719.0,The guy you're replying to wrote an actual love letter to Jordan Peterson and posted it on the internet. It's safe to assume he doesn't have healthy thoughts about men's issues.
AskMen,ff6ldco,t1_ff5zu3r,1579629667.0,"He's not entitled to a response. That's not unfair. This designation you're concerned about is completely fictitious. You don't know that anyone designated him as such, and if they did its likely people he'll never see again making it meaningless. You are also basing it on a retelling of events and not a reality."

Pathfinder2e,ff3i1xo,t1_ff3i0hr,1579541484.0,Away is tautological.
Pathfinder2e,ff3hsb4,t1_ff3hn3a,1579541331.0,Away meaning away isn't changing a definition. I've never had a problem with that at my table but thanks for your faux concern.
Pathfinder2e,ff3hium,t1_ff3haq3,1579541157.0,K thanks. This is the dumbest thing I've seen someone try to argue. Enjoy houseruling it in your games as is your prerogative.

Pathfinder2e,ff3g4v3,t1_ff3fr9g,1579540352.0,"You think ""away from"" means something different than ""away"" from. Like I said, I can't help you with that. But there is no citation or rule that will change the definition of ""away"". So there is nothing ignoring the rules involved with that. That you think you are the arbiter of what ""away"" means and your interpretation of it means you're full of yourself."
Pathfinder2e,ff3fiw9,t1_ff3ffhu,1579540015.0,They don't disagree with my claim. You disagree with how I'm interpreting. I disagree with how you're interpreting it. Get over yourself dude.

Pathfinder2e,ff3crvi,t1_ff32l0a,1579538560.0,"If you think that constitutes ""away from"" I can't help you but to tell you you'll be disappointed at my table and most I've been at. I'd rule the same way for 2e but the wording is just different enough that I wouldn't argue it with a different GM."
Pathfinder2e,ff2w2yu,t3_erc38g,1579526360.0,"In 1e this doesn't work. In 2e I don't think the rules are specific enough to say one way or the other for certain. So, ask your gm."
TWRP,ff1wm4v,t1_fe4zk6s,1579487845.0,Pretty sure he's just waving with a guitar pick in his hand.
Pathfinder2e,ff1mg2w,t3_er3dhm,1579481608.0,One thing people mean by rules clarity that I think warrants specific mention is the tag system. Every ability and enemy comes with a set of tags that tell you exactly how they operate and interact. It's genius. Super effective and super simple.

AskReddit,fereaep,t1_fer2n1l,1579352885.0,Tons of solos are harmonized and almost every lead vocal track since 1960 is double tracked. Not to mention when bands with only one guitar player double track rhythm guitars under their harmonized solos. There's no way to recreate that with a 4 piece band. But you hit on the difference being that Boston's selling point is their masterfully slick production. I remember the liner notes of the debut album point out that no effects were added to the vocals but it'd still be impossible to have one guy sing his own three part harmony backing vocals live. Not sure Tom ever even wanted to tour honestly.

“[Gibbons and I] thought about superhero types like Batman, so I thought, ‘What would he be like in the real world.’ And he’d be very much like Rorschach—if you’re a revenge-driven vigilante, you’re not quite right in the head. Yeah, alright, your parents got killed when you were a kid, whatever, that’s upsetting. But for most of us, if our parents were killed when we were little, would not become a bat-themed costumed vigilante—that’s a bit mental.

So, I thought, ‘Alright, if there was a Batman in the real world, he probably would be a bit mental.’ He wouldn’t have time for a girlfriend, friends, a social life, because he’d just be driven by getting revenge against criminals… dressed up as a bat for some reason. He probably wouldn’t be very careful about his personal hygiene. He’d probably smell. He’d probably eat baked beans out of a tin. He probably wouldn’t talk to many people. His voice probably would have become weird with misuse, his phraseology would be strange.

“I wanted to kind of make this like, ‘Yeah, this is what Batman would be in the real world.’ But I had forgotten that actually to a lot of comic fans that smelling, not having a girlfriend—these are actually kind of heroic. So actually, sort of, Rorschach became the most popular character in Watchmen. I meant him to be a bad example, but I have people come up to me in the street saying, ‘I am Rorschach! That is my story!’ And I’ll be thinking, ‘Yeah, great, can you just keep away from me and never come anywhere near me again for as long as I live?’”"
