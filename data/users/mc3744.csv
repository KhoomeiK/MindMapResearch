DobermanPinscher,ff6jwx6,t3_ervae1,1579628782.0,"Recent studies on negative\positive reinforcement analyzed the chemical balance of dogs in both cases (hormones, enzymes, ...).
The study has been conducted explicitly on non working dogs (no K9, hunters, SAR, ...), as more and more dogs live in a family environment.
The findings are, quite expectedly, that - while negative reinforcement is quicker - it has adverse effects on the dog wellbeing and balance in the medium/long term.
I have a dobie obviously, my behaviorist has always directed me and my family to only use positive feedback. We are absolutely happy with the results. But ours is just one dog. I cannot speak to the average dobie.
Best of luck"

DobermanPinscher,feph6al,t3_eqaco9,1579320390.0,"I have the sweetest girl (sleeping beside me right now). She is very friendly, but she has also been very lucky. From everything I read on this great breed, Dobermanns (in Europe we call them with their breed founder’s name) don’t particularly like people who are not family/pack. But they are aggressive only as a defense mechanism. He has gone through a lot, hence it will take him longer to trust, understandably so. However the breed intelligence will eventually allow him to understand and overcome, completely. You are doing a great thing and - while I’m not an expert - I’m sure that if you hold long enough you will be repaid more than you expect. Good luck! I so, so wish you to succeed!

P.S. please let us know"

dogs,fehzeio,t3_ep5jpm,1579126969.0,"I don’t feel I can express a meaningful opinion. Only you can, with your love.
I simply want to express my deepest sympathy. The more you suffer the more she meant to you. That is the meaning of affection.
Time will heal. So sorry for your pain."

Doberman,feeda32,t3_eookjv,1579031381.0,"I have a 5 months old dobie. As a first time owner I used a dog behavioral expert.
She really, really helped on all these kind of issues. I’m not experienced enough to suggest anything other than finding a GOOD professional. Good luck, to me dobies are just the best!"
milano,fee89a2,t3_eomf5c,1579028435.0,"If it's benzos based you definitely need a prescription.

I take my dog to Clinica Veterinaria S. Angelo (near Piazza Repubblica), they are open every day (only in the morning on Sunday) and have several specialists. I'm quite happy with their service. I only speak to them in Italian hence I'm not sure if they speak English. You could always phone them and check. I'm guessing some will."
