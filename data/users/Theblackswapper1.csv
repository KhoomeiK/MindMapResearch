A buddy of mine got laid up for a while. I gave him a copy. It DOES take a little bit to get into it (like I said, the two main characters are very similar in the beginning), but **man** once things pick.up? It's genuinely one of the best books I've ever read.  My buddy's experience with the book was similar.   Be patient, and enjoy!"
booksuggestions,ff1it55,t1_ff1ieyb,1579479890.0,"I posted this to someone else when discussing the book.

Hmmü§î

1.  I'm kind of a scifi fan.  I like crazy huge universes with histories and lots of characters with different goals. This book had all of the ""hallmarks"" of that kind of story.  I completely lost myself in the world.  Every detailed nook and corner of the world had something. You've got cowboys, white people, Native Americans, Mexicans, African-Americans, thieves, sheriffs, gunfighters, trackers, mountain men, teenagers, old-timers, prostitutes, medicine men, homesteaders, miners, doctors, gamblers, farmers, hunters, of all different races, genders, and cultures. Everyone is together in this land, and everyone is trying to survive. 

2. The pacing is very deliberate.  There will be chapters and maybe a hundred pages of ""slow"" storytelling. Then all of a sudden an act of unbelievable violence will occur. Like ""what the hell did I just read?!""-Violence. Then you sort of smile like ""I never saw that coming; what's going to happen next?""

3. Building off that, pretty much everyone has about a 50/50 chance of making it through the story.  You have noble and heroic characters, and you have deceitful and villainous characters. The action can basically impact all of them equally.  Nobody is really safe, and that keeps you reading. --- Sidenote, but there are three other books in this saga.  Two take place before the book, one takes place afterwards ( *Lonesome Dove* was the first one written). I got to the last page of the final book, and I **still** wasn't convinced that the character was going to make it to the end of that last page.

4. The book really covers a lot about friendship between guys. You have two real cowboys, paragons of a real old-school type of masculinity.  Talking about feelings, fears, or being open etc isn't something that they really do . . . but they still have to deal with these things in front of each other.  How do they do that? How will the other friend react? How does he support his friend? Does he understand, and if so how does the act on that?  That's just something that interests me. 

5. The story basically focuses on two main characters. A lot of times it seems like stories like that will show how mismatched or different these protagonists are. By having them be different from each other the author creates conflict (which can drive the story), and also gives the reader some pretty clear ideas about how these characters are different from each other.  Here the protagonists are--ostensibly--very similar. The more you read, though, the more you see how they're different, and this is just a really sophisticated way of characterizing these protagonists. Because let's say that they're dealing with some problems.  For the first fourteen problems in the book they're on the same page in terms of how they should handle the problem. Whether their approach works or fails, whether  the problem is big or small, they are basically in agreement that it's the right way to deal with the problem. Now when problem fifteen comes by they disagree with each other about what to do. As the reader you're kind of like ""oh!"" and it's not only interesting from a storytelling perspective, but it's interesting to be reminded that these are different characters with different perspectives and experiences, even if 90% of the time they are acting more or less the same.  --- When I first read the book I was very frustrated because I felt like the characters were very similar and many of the cowboys around them were kind of the same. By the end of the book I could tell you exactly how they're different. As I mentioned, I went on to read the other three books in the series  so that should tell you something.   I mean in a weird way it's like an optical illusion or the arrow in the FedEx logo. At first you're kind of like ""I honestly don't really know what I'm seeing here,"" but once you actually understand what the creator is doing, not only do you see it, not only can you kind of not unsee it, but you can articulate to others exactly what to look for.

Hope this helps. ‚ö°üòÄ"

Just my humble advice.

1. Never give up.  Never surrender. 


2. It's going to be stressful. Make time for a regular workout routine.  You owe it to yourself. 


3. There's a lot of research that says time away from the work can actually help. Take breaks, but be careful not to use this strategy as an avoidance activity. 


4. Most people won't understand how hard you work. 


5. You're probably pretty smart. That's great.  Be prepared to have that put to the test. What worked before won't necessarily work now.  


6. Don't be afraid to get some help regarding your mental health.  Most colleges and universities have free counseling services for students. Now everyone's path is unique, and everyone's story is different, but I know that I regret not reaching out for help earlier. 


7. Be prepared to hear ""no"" a lot. I already said that what worked for you before might not work now. You'll also have reqests ignored, emails unreturned, and if you do get responses, people won't want to help you. The IRB will reject your ideas, and you'll be forced to reconceptualize your study. You can do it though. Why? See my first piece of advice.

In June the year I started this program I was hanging out with a couple of friends. One of them had just started at the Police Academy. 

Me: So how's it going?
Him: This is the busiest I've ever been in my life  
Me: *laughs in that sort of ""I hear ya, man"" way*
Him: *laughs back* . . . I mean it though, this is the busiest I've ever been in my life.

Summer came and went. September came and I started my program.  We met back up in October. He was almost finished with the Academy. 

Him: So how's the PhD program going?
Me: Remember when you told me ""This is the busiest I've ever been in my life""?

Now it's not like there's NO free time, but I just have to be a lot better with prioritizing.  I was telling another friend whose wife just gave birth to his second child that I kind if empathized with him.  He said ""I come home from work, and it doesn't matter HOW BAD  my day was, I walk in that door, and I'm dad.""  I have a similar situation because no matter how bad my day was, I cone home and the reality is that I need to start working on this PhD stuff.

  I try to keep to a regular gym schedule.   I have a social life, but that said, my romantic life does tend to be better in between semesters.  I had a romantic relationship though. It was a good one. 

A lot of PhD students have this relationship with their program.  ""Hate"" is a strong word,  but it's definitely close to a love-hate relationship. I actually started counseling and medication about half a year ago. A lot of PhD students are in mental health programs because it's stressful.  Now that said,  I'm still here. I'm incredibly proud of my work and the progress I've made.  I like my areas of study, and I'm working with a population that I'm really passionate about.   I'm scared of what's to come, but I've come so far.  Ultimately, right now, I'm pretty happy with my decision. 

Hang on.  I made a list of advice for people considering entering a PhD program."
PhD,fdcfokr,t3_ekl964,1578273748.0,I work a full-time job and I go for my PhD at night.  I'm defending in March and I should be graduating in May.

scifi,fd42weu,t1_fd40frt,1578163872.0,"My friend texted me the night *The Mandalorian* premiered. I didn't buy Disney+, but he said ""it's good, and there's a good ending that the Internet will probably spoil if you don't watch it soon.""

Sounds cool. I signed up.

No subtitles. 

They did fix it later, but how do you let your streaming service go up with a show people want to see . . . and let something like that happen. I've worked all day. I wanted to unwind, and I paid good money to enjoy your show.  Very annoying that there's an option that will help me understand the show and it's not working."
hardofhearing,fd3jex5,t3_ejyawk,1578158908.0,"Go for a cleaning.  Tell your doctor.  My hearing loss is due to surgery, so there's a bunch of scar tissue and such in my ear. I need to have it cleaned out every so often. 

It's well worth it."
scifi,fd3eit4,t1_fd3dq97,1578157575.0,"Yeah, I wish companies would be more respectful about this instead of treating it like an afterthought. 

I'm interested in your show, your product, just let me enjoy it because I can't access the words without a little bit of support."
scifi,fd2ys99,t1_fd2kv7v,1578153077.0,"I'm Hard-of-Hearing and I need subtitles too.  Can you buy the shoes from a different party like Vudu, Prime, or Apple? They're sometimes more helpful."
scifi,fd2vrcu,t1_fd1oq4l,1578152125.0,"Killjoys scratches a certain itch for me. I'm glad it exists, but I don't necessarily miss it between seasons m"
scifi,fd2v1u9,t1_fd2kite,1578151866.0,SyFy did three seasons . Amazon Prime picked it up.  The fourth season is available right now on Prime.
Westerns,fd06oip,t1_fd05geu,1578114437.0,"I noticed!  Ridiculous. . . .

Somewhere, Tarantino said that he wrote scripts for five episodes of *Bounty Law* to help understand Rick.  Prine or some platform should make a deal and shoot those five episodes.  They probably couldn't get Leo to do it, but I'm sure they could put together a decent cast. I'd check it out!"
PhD,fczxik7,t3_ejpwjr,1578110320.0,"It emerged organically over time.  My first year I read a lot of papers.  I had a very general sense of what I wanted to do.  My teachers encouraged me towards the end of the second semester to read articles focusing on my interests. Over time I sort of saw a problem that I could work with.  I saw some treatments, strategies, and techniques that worked in other areas.  

I started to basically look into whether or not this solution had ever been attempted for this problem. Over time the general became specific. The framework became defined.  I heard a saying once, and it was something like ""you need to read 100 articles about your area and produce 100 pages of classwork or papers about your area before you can really figure out what you're doing.""

Good luck."
Westerns,fcz3prz,t1_fcz3g3y,1578093040.0,"Wow, I remember hearing something about that!  Jeez.  Scary stuff . . .  Imagine what could have happened."
Westerns,fcz0vzl,t1_fcykyq5,1578091430.0,"One season. 

There's something beautiful about it being a one and done, but I really do feel like if they could have stuck with it, they could have had a solid and reliable cult hit on their hands."

KIRK: You, help us or die.

MALTZ: I do not deserve to live.

startrek,fctcp2l,t1_fct5jja,1577939137.0,"Well in fairness  the OP does specify TNG.  The funniest thing Trek ever has done, in my opinion, is making the audience gradually realize that Morn has a really vibrant, exciting, boisterous, and talkative life  . . . . and it6*completely offscreen*.  

Kira gets mad at Quark for fearmongering.  Morn ran naked through the promenade screaming ""We're all going to die!"".  It's delivered so matter-of-fact that I love it."
startrek,fctc4p0,t1_fcsut3o,1577938661.0,"Something that I have always thought was interesting about that episode is that we're not looking at characters that were designed to be one-offs, imperfect, or half-baked.  We're looking at characters that were supposed to be strong enough to carry their own show.  Pike is a pretty solid lead. Number One and Spock generally come across well. I don't think I'd take Dr. Piper over Bones, but I can see the appeal of that character.   It's a little window into ""What If""; we get to see *Star Trek* in a different form."
startrek,fctbos7,t1_fctb7po,1577938284.0,"Yeah. Actually as much as I'd like to have that camaraderie of being on a ship out there exploring and stuff,  I think I'd probably aim to be on a starbase.üëç‚ö°üññ"

I've posted this elsewhere, but I don't know why the show didn't have a bigger crossover in America.  Even the title theme has that sort of heroic, ""let's rally around the big man"" punch to it."
