However in adulthood, I realise that it's pretty damn good quality so long as you don't opt for any of their lower end stuff). Super Premium Ts are the good shit.

I also started buying checked / plain casual fit long-sleeved button shirts and that's something I've never done before.

All in all, I'm saving money, not buying big brands and not wasting money on just the name and I think I look pretty good, smart/casual and I'm happier for it. And of course the quality of the clothes is still really good (weight, stitching, colouring, etc)."
