One bit of advice though, sometimes ""connecting"" with a work of art is something of a choice, and if you were to, say, make a really roleplay-heavy character in an attempt to more fully identify with the game and the game world, you might find it makes some of the flaws more tolerable. Just a thought, works for me with some things."

My pay is roughly $25 per hour after taxes. This means I am paid $68.75 *per week* to shit.

With 52 weeks in the year, that is $3,575 that I have been paid to shit each year. 

If I could find some buyers, and up my fiber intake, I figure I could easily clear 10k a year, shitting at work and running a modest shit-vid side hustle.
