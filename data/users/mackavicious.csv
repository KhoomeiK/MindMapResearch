In '14, the Royals lost the WS in heartbreaking fashion, with the tyng run on third base at home in game 7. Last year, the Chiefs lost a heartbreaker in the AFC Championship game, going into overtime at home, but never getting a chance to possess the ball. We all know what happened in '15. I hope we crush the Niners, giving back to San Fransisco what they gave a little more than five years ago.

Baseball is my first love, and I will always identify as a baseball fan more than a football fan, but football has never been far behind. I've never lived in KC, so I can't compare the buzz generated by the teams, however can tell you the excitement I felt for the Royals is twice that for the Chiefs. 

In both cases, it has been essentially my lifetime since I've seen my pro teams succeed (born in October '85, so I was barely conscious for the Royals' first championship). Famously, of course, the Chiefs haven't been to the Super Bowl for 50 years, but it might as well be 1000 years, I don't have 50 years perspective. But, again, I'm baseball first. I was more excited about the Royals than the Chiefs. 

I'll still get a Chiefs championship tshirt if they win in two weeks, lol.
