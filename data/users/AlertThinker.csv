ATT,ff480sb,t3_erim7u,1579557546.0,"We transferred our AT&T POTS (plain old telephone service) to Ooma about 2 years ago. After ordering the Ooma Telo from [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) (cheapest), we tested it for about a week using a # temporary number provided by Ooma. Once we were happy with the service and that it worked throughout the house, we asked Ooma to transfer the number. It took about 3 business days. DO NOT call AT&T to cancel the service. AT&T will automatically cancel it AFTER the number has been transferred. If you call and cancel AT&T before the number is transferred, you risk losing the number.

Also, before we did the transfer, we converted our home alarm system to cellular. Just an FYI in case you have a home alarm system."
