Your mileage will vary - laptops work 95% of the time, but you will run into that ONE situation for that ONE client where THEY have HDCP issues, and you don't, or THEY can't get video, but you can. An HDMI tester is a great way to troubleshoot signal flow (one that has an HDCP switch).

Backpacks:

I cannot speak highly enough of the merits of products from Hazard 4 and 5.11.

Honestly, when I started in the industry, I had a lot of friends who were over seas and swore by these two companies. The gear is durable (my sling bag has lasted me nearly 5 years thus far on many-MANY job sites, and I am tough on bags), and anything with molle will give you expandable storage as you need it. I have cell phone pouches, a ""magazine"" pouch that holds my laser tape measure, another that has pens, etc etc. You can find nearly anything.

I got a friend of mine to loan me an old bag he had just replaced, as it had the modular pouch attachments, and I fell in love with it. 

They are a little pricey ($80 - $200)

But they are worth it. Hazard 4 is made from 1000D Nylon, and 5.11 is 1050D nylon.

There are some very handy items called Zipclips as well that will make adding/removing the molle pouches much easier - for a little bit more investment...

Best, most of these can be purchased on Amazon or, if you are lucky enough, there are plenty 5.11 retail stores around the country. 

I currently have this [Bag](https://www.hazard4.com/sidewinder.html) in black, and it is the one that has lasted me over five years so far (with minimal wear)."

TrueReddit,fdfyiz1,t1_fdf4348,1578373816.0,"I mean, to be honest, in response to your first question, yes. 
Does this weaken the U.S., alienate us from our NATO allies, and allow Russia a underhanded way of attacking the U.S. and testing its new weapons in a proxy war against one of its main rivals, while being able to hide behind a guise of ""you struck first"" or ""it's not us, it's Iran"", and all the while being able to buddy up to other countries which may have sour relations with the U.S.?

I think the answer is YES.

Now, I do not believe the president is intentionally trying to harm the U.S., I believe he thinks what he is doing makes him look stronger, and like all weak authoritarians, he thinks it's ""great"", no matter if it is legal or not because anything that makes him feel less self conscious makes him feel better, and that makes the country better in his eyes. 

Personally, I think he is able to be so influenced by malevolent actors who fawn over him and stroke his ego that he is allowing the country to slide into a dangerous position near the brink of armed conflict, and neither he, nor anyone in his immediate orbit, are level headed enough to prevent emotions from getting in the way of achieving a lasting, or even temporary, peace.

Would you say a fully nuclear weaponized Iran is better than the ""oh, oops our centrifuges made just a bit higher grade isotope than previously. Sowwy!""- Iran that we had before? Because now the training wheels are off, and this terrifies me, and this is now 100% the current administrations fault.

We have someone who has stated they have wanted to use nuclear weapons previously now in charge of our potential war, and a novice nuclear state who is now very keen to show they have what it takes to play at the adults table, and what better time or excuse to test weapons than during an ongoing war.
