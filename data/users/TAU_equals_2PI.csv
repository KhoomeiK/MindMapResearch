They may be talking about a different Jesus.  (Hebrew name Yeshua.)

That name was very common in the ancient world.  Like John or Joe today.  The passages where the Jews ***briefly*** mention some guy with the same name place the person they are talking about as living around 100 BC, or in another case, around 100 AD.  So neither could be the same guy as the Christian Jesus.  (Unless somebody got their dates wrong.)"
