funny,feoph9f,t1_fen1nkm,1579303512.0,"Try this example for null hypothesis:

Our experiment is putting a pot of water on the stove. If we had absolutely no prior knowledge of what was going to happen, our null hypothesis would have to be that we turn on the stove and nothing (null) happens.

The alternative hypothesis is that ""something"" happens, and its going to be different from ""nothing"" (null) happening. We turn on the burner and Voila! the water heats up. Do we reject our null hypothesis? Should we repeat our experiment a few times?

Now to get to type I and type II errors, we can look back at the picture above or we can re-use the pot scenario. 

To create a type one error the pot didn't heat up and we say that it did.

To create a type two error, the pot heats up and we say it didnt.

These errors usually come from how different (called distribution) effects can be (well the pot was WARM but it wasnt really HOT, can we really say that something ""different happened""?) or from sample size (Well only 60% of the pots got hot, the other 40 were only warm)
