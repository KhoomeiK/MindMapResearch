AmItheAsshole,ff75t93,t3_erue0c,1579641700.0,"YTA for sure. Going by your final remarks of ""should I tell them so they don't waste their time on someone with an STD"" is absolutely disgusting. Just from that I would guess you dumped her after she confided in you because she saw a potential relationship. You're shallow. Hsv (1 or 2) isn't bad at all. It's made out to be worse than what it really is. Most people have it in some form or another and most don't even know it. How bad can it be if you don't even know you have it?!?! If someone cares about a person for who they are, that ""situation"" isn't an issue. Let the friends make the decision for themselves. It shows that she is a person of character because she at least said something. There are people out there that will infect people for the fun of it. Maybe you should consider her feelings..."

WhatsWrongWithYourDog,felp7do,t3_epp0ok,1579227573.0,"Omg...I had an issue with my dog destroying his kennel too. I had an idea how to keep him from removing the tray and destroying that while also gaining access to the wider squares at allowed his feet to go through where he would then tip the kennel over and cause it to collapse, then he would get out. (And then chew stuff up out of stress from being alone)  I drilled a few holes around the edges of the tray and ziptied it down to keep him from lifting the tray and eating it. Then ziptied the corners of the kennels to keep it from collapsing if jostled (because he would bite it too) then I use a clip (like from a leash on the door to keep that from getting popped open. 

I've tried hard to train him to chill. I got some of it to help, but it was still pretty intense for him. Try leaving chews. Tried running him to get him tired...just none of it was helping. Once I got the destruction and escaping issue under control I made a risky choice.... I got a second dog. A companion dog for him. It actually worked! Being next to another dog is what helped keep him calm while I'm away! He goes in the kennel and sleeps and eats (we feed them in there for morning and breakfast to keep it a positive safe place for them) he's not scared or stressed about the kennel anymore and I'm so happy about that. I just tell them ""kennel"" and they hope up and go right in and wait nicely. When they know we are leaving, a lot of times, we will go to call them and they are already in there."
