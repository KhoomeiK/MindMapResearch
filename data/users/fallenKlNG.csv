GetMotivated,ff3mx86,t1_ff3cyqy,1579544476.0,"My 4 year software engineering degree took me 6 years. This isn’t so bad compared to some of the other extreme stories here, but I got a lot of judgement for it and felt awful. 

I had no real good reason for taking so long. I took the minimum credit hours to be a full time student each semester because I felt like I couldn’t handle anymore than that, and I had to drop/retake a few classes. I also changed majors at one point early on.

I finished with a mediocre GPA, and no internships or Co-ops or even any school activities to put on my resume. I was so bummed out thinking nobody would hire me that I didn’t even attend my graduation ceremony. Didn’t feel like I did anything worth celebrating. 

3 years later I’m now working at a tech company. Things are way less stressful than they were in college, and I have more free time than I ever did. Just goes to show things can get better."

MadeMeSmile,fco1vjh,t1_fcnrrij,1577822563.0,"I played the Witcher game and with the way Yen is shown in the game, I never would’ve suspected she had such a nasty/painful origin story. 

I feel like I can relate somewhat to her character as well. For the longest time I struggled with my self image, and felt like I was always naturally disadvantaged compared to my peers, being the slowest learner. I feel like I had to push myself through great lengths and pain to get to where I am today, with the world giving me nothing but shit on the way. 

Watching Yennefer willingly going through all that pain to reinvent herself really resonated with me. That being said, I’m only on the 4th episode so I’m really looking forward to watching the rest of the show."
