Because the state cant figure out a way to tax modern business effectively since out entire government is based on owning real property. 

Local zonging and permitting for digital businesses is where this is most obvious. 

I'm a landscape designer - I mostly work out of a coffee shop. My business address is basically fictional, but it determines everything about the way I'm taxed and allowed to operate. What if I go to Canada and work there? 

The same is true for anyone who's offering digital services or a mobile business. Governments have based their whole power structure on the use of land, and modern business is moving away from having physical places.

YangForPresidentHQ,ff9e11j,t1_ff9ak3x,1579710979.0,"Tldr: Libertarian means anarchist light basically everywhere else on the world and has always meant that. American libertarians misuse the term, and are more accurately described as anarcho-capitalists. 

The origin of the term ( and this is a little debatable) in its modern term is in the writing of William Godwin in 1793. He basically lays the foundation for Proudhon to come along and coin the term anarchy.


The word libertarian, was used extensively in the writings of the founding fathers, specifically borrowing from John Locke's thinking. My opinion is that American libertarianism is born out of these writings. The difference of course, is that American libertarians, like the founding fathers, reject central authority but make a strange exception for what they call ""markets."" 

In the rest of the world, markets are seen as a logical consolidation of power in the vacuum left by the absence of a central state, and so libertarians (in the rest of the world) seldom allow for this exception."

YangForPresidentHQ,ff7ykjh,t1_ff6w7bc,1579661437.0,"Good compromises should feel like both sides winning, not both sides losing. 

Its possible to do this if you can zero in on what really matters. 

Where our government is now is waging policy wars that serve as proxies for the greater debate about the soul of the country. 

Abortion isn't about whether or not women should be ""allowed"" to have one - it's about the consequences of actions and the right to life and where that right ends. It's about justice vs liberty. 

Gun control is the same thing. 

In fact I think you can make the case that every political debate is about justice vs liberty. 

The reason that Democrats are toothless is because they aren't picking a side of the debate and running with it. 

Republicans are. They are unequivocally pursuing an agenda of deregulation. 

Therefore, its impossible for Democrats to effectively negotiate because they aren't taking the opposite position. 

However, both sides feel that it is the roll of a large government to carry out this work. The Dems want more bureaucracy and the Republicans want more military, but either way, its basically the same playbook.  

Yangs policies represent a good compromise because they maximize the trade off between liberty and justice by approaching the issue from a 3rd standpoint, what if we gave greater agency to people, and increased liberty and justice by diminishing the direct governance of the fed on a large number of issues. 

Centrism  is merely taking the average of 2 stances and landing in the middle on the assumption that the middle will always represent the best of both bits. 

The problem is that the average of 2 perspectives that are bad is still bad. This is the case in US politics. The center of Dems and Republicans is still oligarchy, imperialism, and authoritarianism. The middle of 2 different flavors of empire is still shitty empire. Many Americans know this which is why the vast majority of us don't identify under either political party. 

I would suggest that rather than take a centrist position, it's best to examine both sides of an argument, identify what the underlying ideas really are, appraise whether or not its even an argument worth having or taking sides in, and then propose a viable solution if it is. 

If you frame the solution as addressing the issues both sides have, you'll win everytime."

YangForPresidentHQ,ff60sff,t1_ff57xkc,1579616193.0,"He's not a centrist, he's a libertarian. (actual definition, not the US party) 

True centrism is fucking cancer, because compromise for the sake if compromise ensures that no one gets what they really want. This is why the Democratic party is so toothless and ineffectual. 

I posted a whole post about it just before this but we as a country really need to understand the political spectrum and start using it in ideological conversations correctly."
YangForPresidentHQ,ff60lbt,t3_erpl44,1579616042.0,"He's shifting the Overton window. Republicans weren't happy that Donald did it either. 

Yang is far more libertarian (in terms of the political spectrum, and the actual meaning of the word not the US political party) than a democratic candidate has been in ages. Because his message is truly not primarily concerned with the left or right axis, but with the up and down one, conventional talking points don't apply to him. 

This same thing happened with Trumo who was a naked authoritarian, which had not been a Republican stance really ever. 

Soapbox: this is why a 2 party system is idiotic, because there are vastly more than 2 political leanings and most people don't even know there are options beyond ""left"" and ""right"""

Vader was supposed to be the one to hunt down the Jedi.  


I've never finished it, but I have an outline for the prequels where the ""Clone Wars"" refers to the struggle to control clone tech, because it's seen as unspeakably taboo by the ""civilized"" galaxy. Anakin is lured into believing that the separatists already have it, and is sent to hunt down Jedi by Palpatine under the guise that he's eliminating these dangerous clones.  


By the time Obi-Wan returns from whatever B-plot he's doing - Anakin has been hacked nearly to pieces through these battles, and is basically Vader. He's so confused and blinded by anger he no longer can distinguish reality from deception, and it's Luke's plea to his goodness that finally snaps him out of it."

Palpatine has clones. Lots of them. One day plot happens and a young clone escapes the scary Sith cube. 

He makes his way to a star port where he meets a charming young Jodie Comer who is an acrobat or a knife thrower or something like that, ina space circus ya know, cause she's force sensitive.

The emperor gets word that a clone escaped and is like, "" kill him"" 

He sends Ochie (or whatever his name is) to track his clone down assuming his clone also has dope force powers. He doesn't though- he's a dud. 

Ochie shows up to wreck the party but Jodie and ""hot sheev"" escape. 

Halfway through the series is the battle of Endor, but ochie is a little over eager and cant let it go. 

The show is Hot Sheev and Jodi Comer on the run from Palplys goons, discovering that she's a jedi, that he isn't, having Rey and then getting killed. 

The final shot of the show is baby Rey on Jakku.

So in summary, Rey is a Jedi because of her mom, palpatine is technically her grandfather the same way that Jango is Boba Fetts ""dad."" We get a whole show with Jodi Comer and Ian Mcdermid and get to see a person who could have been a Jedi but never got trained is capable of with a ""good"" Sheev to boot."
