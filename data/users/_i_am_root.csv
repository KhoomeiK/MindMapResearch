FREE,ffvxay7,t1_ffvwvgc,1580276128.0,"Yeah, you don’t even have to download it immediately, just add it to your account."
FREE,ffvwsp6,t1_ffvwrnp,1580275663.0,"Yeah, that’s fair."
FREE,ffvwotf,t1_ffvwa30,1580275564.0,"If you have any type of computer(laptop, pc, mac),  download the Epic Games Launcher, and create an account. You’ll be able to “purchase” whatever games are available for free, and they switch new free games every two weeks."
todayilearned,ffvwhpy,t1_ffvj0jw,1580275384.0,Ugh I have a love hate relationship with that episode. It deserves its own series with all the questions I have about it.
StartledCats,ffvw8gj,t3_evdk1y,1580275149.0,"That dog video is too perfect, it must be reversed."
brandonsanderson,ffuuayo,t1_ffutxmg,1580249472.0,"I mean, I don’t know the complete schedule of what he has planned, all I can do is guess with the rest of y’all. I’m the type of person that plans/thinks the worst so I can be surprised when it’s not so bad in the end, that’s why my guess is so far out."
brandonsanderson,ffu32s6,t1_fftox9l,1580233437.0,"I wish the ending was within 15 years, but that’s hopeful. SA4 should be coming out this December, which gives us a minimum of 3 years until SA5 is released, so 2023. Sanderson has stated that he wants to take a longer break between the two halves, so SA6 might not be in the works for about 5 years.  If he maintains the same schedule for the back half of SA, then those will be released over the course of 15-20 years. So we’re looking at around 20-30 years before Stormlight is finished."
HazbinHotel,ffu2eti,t1_ffst7h7,1580233029.0,That would actually be a genius way to get Vivzie sponsors.
Stormlight_Archive,ffu0yhb,t1_ffu0rso,1580232129.0,"That’s for book 5 to 6, book 3 to 4 is one year."
todayilearned,ffu01nj,t1_fftzmcv,1580231514.0,"Reddit got borked sometime around 11:00, it’s had some interesting effects."
Stormlight_Archive,fftntnr,t1_fftjq1p,1580225210.0,"There's a large time skip between 5 and 6, but there is a minor one from 3 to 4. The preorder blurb says that its a one year gap.

brandonsanderson,fftiwho,t1_ffthb5q,1580221739.0,"I always get really caught up in my first read of a book, so I never notice anything."
Cosmere,fftgupl,t3_ev5lys,1580220165.0,"Never expected to find Kobe in this sub, but that’s an amazing quote. Mans had so much more to offer this world."
Stormlight_Archive,fftgl2j,t1_fftfzrj,1580219948.0,"I wanna say at least one year, two IIRC."
EnterTheGungeon,fftfhnd,t1_fft07of,1580219048.0,"Nah, remote bullets on that thing + nobosscap = dead everything."
brandonsanderson,ffs8kun,t3_eux9y4,1580175793.0,"To be fair, you don't notice the foreshadowing exists until you're on your 9th reread and find a WOB on it, so it's fine to lay it on a bit thick."
coolguides,ffs768i,t1_ffs3pqf,1580174808.0,"Yeah, something like that."
coolguides,ffs1py4,t3_euq94v,1580170994.0,"Cool guide, but a decent title would be cooler."
WoT,ffryoqx,t1_ffryi4h,1580168931.0,"Don’t forget, Sanderson was just starting his professional writing career at that point. It doesn’t protect him from criticism, but it is something to consider."
