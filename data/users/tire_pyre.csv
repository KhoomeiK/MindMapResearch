college,fdo3e5c,t3_eme254,1578598156.0,"Don't overthink it. You've obviously impressed this prof. Good for you! Sounds like your prof will be looking forward to working with you and will be happy to hear from you.

All you need to do is say something like ""Dear Prof X, I hope you're doing well this year..."" or some other innocuous gretting followed by a request to drop into your prof's office hours to discuss this at some point in the next few weeks. Let your prof know you're really interested in pursuing your research further and want to discuss how you can do that. 

The only real way to irritate a prof at this point is to demand a really particular meeting time ASAP (i.e. you can only meet at 3:00AM this Saturday, etc etc) or sending a whole bunch of emails before the prof can respond. Honestly though, the fact that you're even thinking about this stuff at all tells me that this probably isn't going to be an issue.

If you don't hear back within a week or so, send another email, it's probably just lost in his inbox.

**Tl;dr: Just remember basic courtesies you'd extend to anybody: flexibility, patience, please/thanks, etc**."
GVSU,fdo0vbg,t1_fdnpo2d,1578596814.0,you can also email profs for the syllabus to help you choose a sequence.
GVSU,fdo0lqf,t1_fdnpo2d,1578596656.0,"Also, choose a sequence that you have some natural interest in, if possible, because they're long courses (graduated six years ago so I don't know if that's changed)"
college,fdaco6k,t1_fdaa055,1578244658.0,"My point is that expected earnings within ""STEM"" majors are fairly field-specific, not that ""STEM"" students, on the whole, make less money than humanities students. 

I'm saying that presenting stats about ""STEM"" careers as a whole is of pretty limited use to an individual student when most of the well-recuperated fields are found in the ""TE"" of ""STEM."""
college,fda8n37,t3_ekfbwy,1578243047.0,"If your living situation is adversely effecting your ability to complete the class, that may be a good idea. Most profs will be pretty sympathetic. Have you talked to anyone in your college's administration about it? They also might be able to offer you further support."
college,fda7k0n,t1_fda6rh3,1578242684.0,"Tell that to all my friends in natural resource management. Important, practical application of natural science, but not well-compensated at all."
