instantkarma,ff53ike,t1_ff4x0lk,1579579228.0,"Low IQ people (or maybe just people who didn't get further education) tend to have trade jobs, and if you have a trade job you need a truck.

Way too much corruption and power to stamp out good ideas."

I don't know either way, but I know that Spain and other places have been using them for a long time - compared to where I am in America - my city started using them about 13 years ago, and to my knowledge there haven't been any extra deaths because of it (but again, I also have no source for that)"
