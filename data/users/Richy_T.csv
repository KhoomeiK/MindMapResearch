admincraft,fggmdjv,t1_fggjrlc,1580764876.0,I'll have to look into how to do that. I don't suppose just going to the treasure first would help as it would still do the search to see if there's anything closer.
admincraft,fgfyw35,t1_fgfprsg,1580750612.0,"No. Although generated structures are on.

I think I'm going to try the seed on SSP and see how it does on my main computer.

Well, I tried it and the chest didn't open for 20-30 seconds but it did open. The chest itself was at 532,-384 and the treasure was at -260,-1174 so a fair distance.

The processor for this one is getting a bit old now being an AMD FX-4100 but it's much more powerful than the system that's running the minecraft server which is an AMD Athlon(tm) II X2 260. Both are using SSDs though."
assholedesign,fgex9ra,t1_fgekomc,1580713649.0,"Possibly. So you need to try harder. ""fifteen hundred o'clock A.M."" should do it. If that still doesn't work, go for ""fifteen hundred o'clock A.M. in the evening."""

Some sources say that it's linked into the regular tree creation which would make it the same as natural generation which is 5% only in plains and sunflower plains.

I'm not sure if it modified the video or if the video contains accelerometer metadata though. There's no way to disable it and it's kind-of annoying. I haven't put it public because the audio isn't good.

Shitstatistssay,fge5b5o,t1_fgdkxvo,1580691695.0,The left was a damn sight more rational 200 years ago though. I'm pretty sure a left-libertarian from 1820 (Marx would have been 2) would look at Bernie Sanders and wonder why his children aren't keeping him somewhere safe and comforting indoors where he can't hurt himself.
todayilearned,fgdrhaj,t1_fgcexgf,1580685909.0,"This is only true under very heavy congestion and is typically only going to be a real issue if one flow of traffic is particularly heavier than the other (at which point they will often add traffic lights). Four way stops are particularly horrible for this as you often have to make as many stop

Don't try and think it through in your head, actually try the things. I think you're missing some aspects of the flow. I have lived and driven in both systems and roundabouts are completely superior, even for third-exits. Four way stops are horrible and introduce congestion where there need be none at all.

And if you're seeing people do u-turns in 4-way stops, let me know where you live cause I don't want to drive there."

todayilearned,fgb24cs,t1_fg82hk0,1580657717.0,"> If the majority exits at the 3rd, 4-ways are better.

Not true. You always have to (or are supposed to) come to a complete stop at a 4-way. A roundabout often requires some to no slowing, more than making up for a small amount of extra distance.

Now, you might have a point with pedestrians but that can be helped with traffic islands and it seems that drivers often have little idea how to handle pedestrians at a 4-way stop."

assholedesign,fg87fi8,t1_fg7v4rr,1580611520.0,I believe the game is still there and new users on that box will have it on their start menu. I've also heard of it coming back during updates but YMMV. Actually removing the game is supposedly a straightforward but non-obvious procedure.

An additional option would be a helper function which basically contains your above code but throws away the wificlient for the 32. I would probably go with keeping the deprecated call for now though as that requires no work :)"
gadgets,fg157jm,t1_fg0raoq,1580420981.0,Yep. I have no doubt that the writers based it on that. And I reckon there's a fair chance the 'ship of Theseus' framers were just gussying it up with a bit of Greek legend to sound a bit more fancy too.

Companies think they can have a low-quality line to mop over that extra cash but it affects their overall reputation eventually. That's why car manufacturers operate separate marques like Lexus/Toyota.

Though I do think the US needs an attitude change towards allowing more vacation. Two weeks is standard in my field and it's not enough (and I don't just mean from the employee POV but the employer also benefits to some degree). Other people start with a week or even less and that's just nonsense unless you're just putting employees through the mill and replacing them when they're done. I don't think government should be mandating anything though."

If you can then plug something into the keyboard, the keyboard needs to contain a hub. You can't just have a passthrough unless you run two USB connections from the computer because one USB connection only allows one device to be directly connected.

I know there's something I'm missing about what Apple were up to but it's hard to see what it is.

It's also surprising that they wouldn't allow active extensions because that's effectively a one port hub. Which is what I have for my Oculus sensor. Though possibly they are just talking about simple signal boosters (which they probably were)."
