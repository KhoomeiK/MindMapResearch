You hit the nail on the head. I happen to be and adult learner of several foreign languages as well as a couple of musical instruments and based on my experience, the failure rate in those is much higher than 95%. The beginner-level classes are full to bursting with students while people who go on to intermediate level are less than 10% of the initial class. For advanced classes, it's even lower.

PCOS,fekkok9,t1_feke7ic,1579202048.0,"The only reason why I can eat as many carbs as I do despite being insulin resistant is because I exercise. A lot. If I eat a plate of pasta or fried rice a little too frequently without doing my regular exercise routine, I get as sluggish and hungover as you do. This is exactly what happened to me over the holidays.

I still think there was some error in your calorie counting which is why you didn't have success with it. Carbs are incredibly calorific and a plate of pasta can wipe out your entire calorie budget for the day. I treat carbs like ""bombs""--with utmost care and precision. I have a food scale on my table just for that.

The reason I exercise as much as I do is because I realized that as a 5'2, mostly sedentary woman, I have VERY little leeway in my calorie budget if I wanted to lose weight. A single cheat *meal* (not day) could wipe out all my hard work for the week. So can little miscalculations here and there. I purposely go harder on the exercise so any possible miscalculations are cancelled out.

Keto works for a lot of people because it's much easier to create a calorie deficit when you cut out carbs. Bonus points for us with insulin resistance because carbs make us sluggish and hungrier faster anyway. 90% of my calorie overages come from sweets--if I cut that out, I would have reached goal weight months ago. But I don't because I do not find cutting out food groups sustainable long term.

I'm typing this all out because keto is often touted as the only way to lose weight when you have PCOS. This prevented me from trying to lose weight for years--that's how much I detest being on the keto diet. There are people out there like me who would rather count calories and run off the carbs than say goodbye to pizza and cookies forever."
PCOS,fek7ekt,t3_epa6c0,1579194161.0,"I agree with you on insulin resistance and how it interacts with PCOS but gaining weight despite a calorie deficit is a myth. I've literally eaten full-fat and full sugar cheesecake, nachos, and all sorts carby and sweet things and LOST weight the very next day. Because I was still under my energy expenditure (as tracked by my Fitbit). I've been doing CICO for 7 months now in addition to exercise and the numbers add up. Nobody can escape the law of thermodynamics.

I started out with pretty severe PCOS (was diagnosed with it a decade ago but had the symptoms since my teens) and had not had a period for over two years despite not being on BC or any medication. It could literally feel the inflammation cooking me from the inside. It took losing 17% of my bodyweight before I got my period back, and I'm still trying to lose more and recomp in the hopes of reversing insulin resistance for good.

I never took Metformin. Finished a bottle of Myo-Inositol and D-Chiro, then a bit of Berberine midway through my weight loss journey but stopped because I was losing weight anyway without needing to rely on expensive supplements.

My insulin sensitivity is much better now although a few days of prolonged indulgence (like during the holidays when I did not have full control on what ate) proved to me that even though I CAN eat carbs, it's still not a good idea to indulge in them too much and too often."

Ugh, I wish this applied to me. I grew up significantly overweight as a child and ate massive portions. For me, full=eating until my stomach physically hurt. I only started to get a handle on it during my mid-teens after I got sick and tired of being shit-talked about my weight and voluntarily and independently subjected myself to ""dieting."" Which in my case just meant dropping my insane portions to normal portions.

I still remember, after losing about a dozen lbs, the first time I decided to take a break from my diet and binge ""like the good old days."" I stacked my plate with the full intention of going for seconds and thirds. Try as I might, I couldn't finish the first plate. It was the first time I realized how truly obscene  the amount I used to eat was."
fatlogic,fego1qt,t1_feglm0d,1579098426.0,"I kinda understand--for example, I put off buying a proper-fitting bra for many years because a good bra is expensive and I considered my fat body a temporary thing (never mind that I've been fat for close to a decade). I also lost interest in fashion because it was harder to find clothes that flattered a larger and rounder figure (mind you, I wouldn't even have registered as smallfat in FAs eyes). Towards the tail end of my fat days, I got into fashion again, finding good, cheap clothes at outlet stores. But it only made it clear how much more work it took to find good fitting, FLATTERING clothes when you have a protruding belly.

I'm back in straight sizes again and the difference in how clothes fit is night and day. I can randomly throw together anything from my wardrobe and chances are, it would still look decent on me. Because my body is better-proportioned now."

I am a female with an hourglass-shaped figure so you would think that I'd have it easy when it comes to fashion but that isn't the case at all. Most curvy cuts are geared towards pear shapes so for the bust to fit me, I need to take in the waist. The current trend of oversized and straight-cut clothes look disastrous on me and make me look heavier by 20 lbs. And the majority of clothes I consider cute (frills around the bust or hips for example) just make me look boxy and pregnant.

But put me into form-fitting clothing, preferably with a lower neckline, and I look the bomb. Learning how to match tops and bottoms also allowed me to be more creative with my wardrobe (othewise I would be stuck with bodycon dresses).

Good luck!"

I am Asian myself, living in Asia, and it is exceedingly rare to see people fatter than Tess Holliday. As to why, my guess is that as Asian doctors and scientists have noted, we tend to develop obesity-related diseases at lower BMIs. I myself develop serious obesity-related issues above a BMI of 27 which makes me pretty sure that I **will die** even before I reach ""mid-fat"" levels of obese. 

In sum, I believe that if OP really weighed what she claimed, her genes and obesity would have killed her long ago. Or if not, she should be at death's door by now and the weight loss clinic wouldn't have released her after a mere week."

I thought that too but I have ""naturally"" thin friends that became underweight without meaning to. It happened because they have naturally very small appetites, and can actually ignore hunger when they judge going out to get something to eat to be a chore (something that I find unthinkable).  Like literally they'd rather go hungry rather than take the elevator down to the convenience store downstairs.

They're also people who have never dieted their whole lives. Nor do they work out consistently. They just eat very little, and are incapable of eating more."

When he sees other people eat their small plates of salad, he gets self-conscious so he curbs what he eats in public and apparently that causes him a lot of stress. When he was with me, he could eat what he wanted as much as he wanted and I went along with it.

The thing is, at the time he was a ripped a college athlete that swam competitively, and practiced and lifted weights almost everyday. I was also at a normal weight (one of the brief periods in my life where I wasn't fat) due to a combination of youth, needing to walk everywhere, and not having enough money buy all the food I wanted.

To no one's surprise, we both blew up after college. Me more than him, because I tried to eat as much as he did--a male, not that much taller than me but with a good reserve of muscle from his athlete days."

I guess the only thing that makes it harder than normal is that I have a big appetite, and naturally always have since my toddler days. So I need to continuously watch what I eat because I WILL overeat any chance possible.

Even then, I've only ever had ONE instance of PMS-induced hunger and it was a miserable experience I would not wish on my worst enemy. The hunger felt visceral, and no amount of food could sate it. I was so ravenous it was all I could think about. I still tracked everything I ate but even with full knowledge that I was going way over TDEE, I couldn't stop from stuffing my face.
