I’ve worked with dozens of recruiters and mostly they’re pretty interchangeable.  What sets Meghan apart is her tenacity and resolve.  I am used to not being impressed by other people, I think of myself as somebody who gets shit done at work and it’s not often I meet another person whose work ethic I respect.  Meghan made me feel lazy in comparison when I saw how hard she worked trying to get me into different roles.  I didn’t rely on her to be a technical expert because I can do that myself, but she is clearly an expert at finding a job in Minneapolis.  

I have some pretty in demand skills/experience.  Meghan found my resume on LinkedIn and then managed to find somebody I knew personally, by looking at where I had worked and leveraging her own network, to ask me if I would meet her.  She never wasted my time with bullshit sales pitches but she was constantly in contact with the important stuff.  She also doesn’t seem to ever stop working, we spoke often throughout the day and well until the night when she was working to place me.  I really felt like she was fighting as hard as she could for me, which is not a feeling I’ve ever had with another recruiter."

Don’t get me wrong, I think they’re idiots but I believe that I read that conspiracy theory belief happens in some highly intelligent people too.

learnjavascript,ff64nrp,t3_erv0du,1579619032.0,"A few things:

1) repomgr.square.com doesn’t resolve for me.  Is that a private NPM registry? On your companies internal network or something? If so does your company have a team you could reach out to that knows the architecture?

2) that error is from an OrientDB instance on a Java server.  It means that a thread tried to modify a record that was already locked.  If the server isn’t broken it might have just been a temporary error.  So try again. 

3) If you aren’t purposefully trying to reach a  private NPM registry and the error is still happening every time you try you can delete package-lock.json and the node_modules directory.  Run npm config get registry to see what it’s set to.  It’s probably set to repomgr.square.com.  If that’s not what you want it to be you can run npm set registry https://registry.npmjs.com/.  That will set it back to the public npm registry.  Try npm install again now. 

If you do work in a large company with a private NPM registry then registry.npm.js might be blocked at a network level.  You could get around that by pairing your laptop with your cell phone if you just need to get something done fast.  But if you’re supposed to be using a private registry and you start pulling in packages from public and bypassing your company firewall you may get in trouble so make sure you’ve checked option 1 before checking option 3."

iamatotalpieceofshit,ff5ydor,t1_ff5f4rp,1579614248.0,"Our banking is definitely behind but checks are very uncommon here.  Many places don’t offer paper checks for payment.  I haven’t ever worked anywhere that doesn’t offer direct deposit.  I’m a software engineer now but 15 years ago I was a waiter and I still got my checks by direct deposit then.  I remember working minimum wage jobs that didn’t offer paper checks and if you didn’t have a bank account you had to use a debit card they gave you to receive your pay (their debit card was loaded with fees).

We don’t get checkbooks with our bank accounts anymore (used to be part of opening an account) but you can still buy checks if you want.  I bought some that I’ve used to pay some payments at my son’s daycare because I misunderstood when he first started going there and I thought they didn’t have electronic payment.

Other than that it’s only older people who use them here too.  My parents send me and my son checks for our birthdays.  I think the only checks I’ve cashed in the last 5-10 years other than from my parents have been for unexpected things like class action lawsuit settlements or an investment account closing out."

You can reduce your risk of violent crime by avoiding strangers but you can’t prevent it.  A criminal has agency and can harm people who don’t do anything to invite harm.  In this case specifically we know that one of the adult men drugged the girl, we don’t know if she was aware she was taking drugs.  Also even if she was aware she is 14 years old, a child.

learnjavascript,fd0aes5,t1_fczzemx,1578116012.0,"You can await within a for loop or a while loop, or a for of loop.

While loops and pop() are good for processing through a large queue.

const values = [ ... ] //this is a large array of values
const batchsize = 10

while (values.length) {

const promises = []

//fill the array with promises, removing a value from the values array when it’s requests are made 
for (let int i = 0;  i < batchsize; i++) {
 promises.push(webRequestFunction(values.pop()))
}

//await the promises array
const results = await Promise.all(promises)

//pretty print data or do whatever you’re doing
console.log(JSON.stringify(results, null, 2))
}


That’s the general idea, you’ll want a try catch inside the loop because if a request fails the whole promise.all will return an error.  handling it within the loop will prevent a failed request from ruining more than its own batch.  

You could also have fancier logic to remove from the array once the request succeeds so that failed values get retried a certain number of times."
