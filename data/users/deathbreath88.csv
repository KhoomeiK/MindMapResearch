mildlyinteresting,fe25deh,t1_fe0lvdy,1578834682.0,I was thinking there is probably a plastic spacer in there. I've seen lots of crazy dispenser designs in the service industry
gaming,fdy3gwj,t1_fdxwo6b,1578775667.0,Never called it a clone. I was simply pointing out that there are tons of games that are clones of other. I haven't played it so I have no idea how different it is. But it looks pretty different with just the same concept. And i call em like i see em. And you seem like a royal prick who must always have the last word and wants to be right all the time. Prove me wrong.
gaming,fdxwe7j,t1_fdxqkfp,1578773581.0,Have you played it? Then you have no idea. And neither do I. Like to see you do something better. But I don't think you can so your pretty judgmental for some prick who can't even do this. You can shove it.
gaming,fdxo7n0,t1_fdxawyy,1578771171.0,Man if only there were tons of clones of other massively popular games like dark souls or mario or fps. People take inspiration from other games. Not everything is a new or original idea. This looks good this person has worked hard on it. I'd like to see you make a totally original game.
gaming,fdx3448,t1_fdx01s1,1578764787.0,Definitely should have used a different word than ripping off.
gaming,fdwz0or,t1_fdwr3g3,1578763707.0,Dude really there can only ever be one type of game ever or what? There are a million dark souls clones. And this game looks incredibly visually distinct from superflight. Does it have similar mechanics? Yes. He is most definitely not ripping it off though. It looks different the controls look like they handle differently the environments look great. You sound like an ass.

Marvel,fdv9mct,t1_fduxlb2,1578745001.0,"Now you are just being an ass. Dude I conceited that neither of us are right or wrong. But you have this compulsive need to have the last word? You also conveniently ignored points to fit you narrative. Like how it is extermely like they used wolverines specific x-gene/ healing factor because they are both from the same program. 
> Both Deadpool and Cable were also meant to be tied into Wolverine's history already from the start, as Liefeld describes: ""Wolverine was my guy. If I could tie anything into Wolverine, I was winning."" Like Wolverine, Deadpool is (or is thought to be) Canadian.¬†The original story had him joining the¬†Weapon X¬†program after being kicked out of the U.S. Army Special Forces and given an artificial healing factor based on Wolverine's thanks to Dr.¬†Emrys Killebrew, one of the head scientists.

Or Like the fact biggest fact that it hasn't been stated one way or the other what wade is. It has never been expressly written that he is a Mutant and it has not been expressly written that he isn't. My *head* cannon is just as correct as yours due to the nature of wades origin. Being part of weapon x, his inconsistency as a narrator and his general psychosis all lead to an air of mystery over what he really is and that the point he can be anything. I think he is a Mutant for the point I have already stated. You think he is not a Mutant for the points you have stated. But as far as I can tell it has never been stated one way or the other. Neither of us are right and neither of us are wrong. I am done with this conversation. Thank you for it and I hope you continue to enjoy comics and Deadpool as much as I do."
donthelpjustfilm,fdut7m2,t1_fdtttij,1578738442.0,The idea is based on the fact that the bacteria and what not in a dogs mouth are not compatible with humans. Thus they are harmless to us and technically cleaner.
Marvel,fdunw4d,t1_fdtzr19,1578736003.0,"First off. The movie didn't get it right. They ""brought out"" wades ""potential"" he then proceeded to self express an x-gene. After great trauma. I'm pretty sure he is called a Mutant by Colossus in that movie.

 X-23 is a genetically modified clone. She did not naturally have the x-gene and was specifically breed and grown/given the x-gene. Wade was genetically modified to have mutant powers from wolverine. They modified his dna to have wolverines x-gene. Wade is so fucked up because that modification expressed so powerfully that it completely runs rampant. It could also be argued very easily that he potentially had a latent x-gene  and that is actually why the healing powers work with his body at all. Or why he is aware of the fourth wall and can break it... Hm just like gwenpool recently being retconned to be a mutant and her power to use the white space and break the fourth wall being considered a mutant gene.... Also im not an idiot i know gwenpool has nothing to do with Deadpool. I was using her to make a point about the fact that she isn't a Mutant but is now considered one.
 
I would also say that the weapon plus program would probably have a million more ""wades"" running around considering they still have wolverines dna (x-23 was made after Deadpool. Yes i know its corrupted clearly still enough uncorrupted for them to have wolvies x-gene as that's Laura power).  if a simple normal person was modified so easily to have insane healing powers why wouldn't they do it a bunch more?

On top of all this as a cherry on top. Wade's origin is inconsistent and retold a millon different way due to him being an inconsistent narrator. But it has never been officially established if he is a mutant or not. The way i see it though is that at the very least he has wolverines x-gene and has just as much right to call himself a Mutant as x-23 does. They were both created by science and neither are technically natural. They were just done in different ways. But I also think wade has some sort of latent x-gene thus why his cancer is so aggressive or why he is aware of the fourth wall cause lets be honest super cancer and super healing making him aware of that makes as much sense as it being a mutant power.  But officially neither of us are right. As it has never been stated wether or not wade is a Mutant. Technically speaking we dont even know if deadpool is wade wilson. As there has been a  story that claims he is just some crazy mofo who's Mutant ability and aggressive cancer fuck up his brain so bad  that he stole the real wades identity.  

Deadpool is written is such a way that he is able to basically be whatever the writer wants. That's half the point of Deadpool.



Finally the ""your"" correction is the most childish shit ever. I'm on mobile and messed up. You know exactly what i meant. And the fucked up grammer isn't ruining anyone's lives. I'm sure I've made plenty more mistakes here too.

Marvel,fdtyo7a,t1_fdtna31,1578724424.0,"You're the only person I've ever seen nitpick Deadpool's mutanthood . That was the point of me making the gwen pool reference. He is definitely a Mutant and it would be like calling x-23 not a Mutant. She came from the same line of experiments and was created as a result of ""science meddling"" i think it's ridiculous to not consider him a mutant.

Marvel,fdtm3mk,t1_fdthgq0,1578718739.0,Deadpool is a Mutant? Wtf you mean adjacent. He has generally always been considered a Mutant and if gwenpool gets to be a Mutant he sure as shit is.

australia,fdsiv25,t1_fdsgnkz,1578703592.0,"Alright i remove my downvotes and changed them to upvotes lol. The edit was good too. So close to getting my user name right lol üòú. I do think the ""exaggerated number"" especially of op's post works well. Just because in reality most people don't know what their net wealth is and its an easy comparison to make. Even if not totally accurate it get the point across in a way thats at least very digestible to most people. Providing accurate information is always better but i kinda think when your dealing with people who make exorbitant amounts of money there isn't a really easy way to nail down their weekly earnings even. As the 1 billon this dude made was just what got payed out in dividends for him. He likely has several other streams of revenue. So the number her makes it easy to digest as well as demonstrates just how little these guys are giving. Even when they are part of something like ""the giving pledge"". The reality is that they are often not really giving away all that much and can often be really scummy still. While basically racking in ""good pr""

But it seems like we generally agree. So i concede you are correct. But I think in the great conversation it is less important."

The dude made more in one day than 99% of the population can ever hope to make in their entire lifetimes.  The concepts of mega wealthy are ridiculously to begin with. But if we are gonna have them they absolutely should feel obliged to give back. The basic concept that everyone on the right loves to talk about is trickle down economics. And the concept that if you cut the rich  a break they will use that savings to reinvest in the community, economy and their people. But they aren't. They are just hoarding more and more wealth. These guys could give back in so much more significant ways. Except they pay themselves, they avoid taxes and generally give the very bare minimum back so they can have so ""good pr"" Fuck that bullshit. Eat the rich!"
australia,fdpeler,t1_fdori9t,1578626632.0,"FFS it does not diminish the point. Hur dur yes he doesn't have all that money in ""liquid cash"". But he does fucking have a way to donate more honestly and properly. WTF are we supposed to compare it to? Im so poor I don't have a fucking net worth. If I donated 100$ any fucking percentage breakdown you do is gonna show that I donated a way higher percentage of my ""income"" or my ""net worth"" or my ""paycheck"" then any of the same metrics from most rich assholes. Jeff fucking bezos could give every single godamn one of his employees a million dollars and still be a billionaire with room to spare. Now obviously thats unrealistic cause his wealth isn't all ""liquid cash"" like that. But the point still stands that he is a hugely rich asshole who can more than afford to give away, donate, provide, and help with his vast wealth than any other single middle class citizen. And he will still have so much fucking money left to spare that his 20xgreat grandkids. Will never so much as struggle one day in their lives."
nextfuckinglevel,fdp2c9d,t1_fdp1dmu,1578618334.0,"Well I'd say it sounds like you two are in a wonderful relationship. ü§ó Both of you genuinely seem to be thoughtful and caring of each other. One of my personal favorite little shows of love in a relationship is a triple hand squeeze basically representing ""I love you"" it's a super fun and easy way to say it without verbalizing too. And it's easly evolved into many different types of ""squeezes or taps"". Three quick taps on a shoulder. Three quick kisses. You know really anything.

Maybe they aren't into it whatever. Move on next person. It has nothing to do with dating today. The last line also comes of as dangerously close to r/niceguys. Just relax go with the flow. Sometimes ""romantic gestures"" can feel forced. Maybe the person isn't into the ""sappy"" thing. But you just chill take your time. Be confident in yourself. The right person will come along. Someone who wants to stop and dance with you. Someone who loves to walk the park and sit with the ducks. Walk around downtown and see the lights. That person exists. Y'all just haven't run into each other."
nextfuckinglevel,fdos9ns,t1_fdoqjyj,1578611744.0,"r/notopbutok 

Also the people in these comments are saying two ways. I would say it depends on what he does as romantic gestures. Is it big grand standing stuff? Or is it little things like you do? Maybe if he does big things you should try and think of some big thing to surprise him. If it's just little things maybe you wanna do something big spice it up? Maybe he will return it with something big? We know very little about y'all's relationship to just make a snap judgment. I would say you are doing fine though. Although i would argue that there is typical more pressure on guys to  be ""over the top"" and it is always good to be on the receiving of that no matter the sex or type of relationship."
UpliftingNews,fdk6g68,t1_fdk27pl,1578497153.0,"And James hetfield is still worth 300 million. My point still stands. He himself could give away more still and never notice an impact on his quality of life, his kids quality of life, his grandkids quality of life. You know why? Cause when you have that kinda money it grows itself. These guys don't have to give away their whole fortune but I'm tired of people defending these millionaires and billionaires. When they all can do more. They have the money. What are we defending? Yes they made their money through hard work. Now give back to everyone else. Its not gonna make them broke and it's not gonna affect their bottom line. If bezos money was ""liquid"" he could give every single employee a millon dollars and still be a billionaire. What defense is their for defending his massive amount of wealth hording. The simple fact is that these people take from society and no where near give back in the same way. Im over it."

UpliftingNews,fdjq4fq,t1_fdjh3yn,1578483082.0,I mean metallic is worth roughly 850 millon. Now all that is not liquid I know but that still figures out about .91% of their wealth. That's basically the equivalent of me donating 10 dollars. If I donated 100 dollars thats worth roughly 10% of my weekly income. We should be thankful for the donations but we also shouldn't be praising them cause its really isn't a lot. And regular people percentage wise give away more than Metallica. Its basically a PR move.

But I don't think it will ever be in their best interest to sell Spider-Man. I love Spider-Man. And would love for him to be with the Marvel cinematic stuff. But it just ain't ever gonna happen as long as Spider-Man is so popular or sony is so successful.

EmpireDidNothingWrong,fcmc2xm,t1_fcm8f6u,1577770097.0,"You're points argue that Vader exists as part of the ""Hierarchy"" but at the end you switch it up and say he exists outside of it. What? Vader exists as part of the ""Hierarchy"". Just because the bureaucracy surrounding vader is something he ""doesn't care about"" doesn't mean it is inconsequential. He is still number 2 to palpatine. And as such all political, government, and military hierarchy falls in line with that. He is a piece in palpatines ""empire"" and government something lucas to a boring degree established in the prequels with how much it got into the politics and the rise of the empire. Further reading includes the Vader comics. To just see that Vader still has to fall in line to some degree. It's consistently a theme of Vader's personal stories about the need for him to work underneath and around the empire despite his high status. Because he is in that position and he can't have his own personal machinations within palps government. Vader is a crazy badass but that doesn't mean he can just do what he wants."
EmpireDidNothingWrong,fclue6e,t1_fcls341,1577756702.0,"Saying Vader is outside of the hierarchy is ridiculous. He bows to the emperor and the empire.

If he was outside hierarchy he would do whatever he wants. Lucas as much as its boring established the shit out of his star wars government. Vader may be second hand to the emperor but this doesn't make him superior then the rest of the emperor's government. The extra reading on Vader make sure to show this. With him having to circumnavigate poltical bs and go even under the emperor's and empires own noses for his personal machinations. He listens to Tarkin because he respects him and likely has to.

When ""episode iv"" came out there was no market of a ""sci-fi space drama"". the thing that separates so much of everything that has formed in the universe today is  just a classic good ole fashioned storytelling. You can like rogue one that's fine. But if you take episode 4 it can stand on it's own. It has no need of greater knowledge that NOW exists. rogue one can not do that.

But Disney won't do it cause familiarity means sales typically. although with the divisive nature of the sequels they are gonna branch out more hopefully.

There just no reason to mess around in this like ""100"" year time period in "" a galaxy far far away, a long time ago"" there is a great star wars lore and universe built with fairly ""established rules of the universe"" 

Something like mandalorian is so successful because it tells a comprehensive story with little bits of star wars lore and universe peppered around it.  Mandalorian could practically exist at anytime and it would still work.

Edit:
In conclusion a star wars story can exist whenever. We are just mucking about in roughly 100 year time period. Rn. Im excited for stories that truly tell something new in the ""star wars"" universe.

Could have even been a law suit for that ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø  who knows. We will really see how far removed james is from this channel come finale. No james and I'm gonna assume the work as far as his and aleks and cowchops greater relationship is i guess ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø"
CowChop,fc1g5v1,t1_fc18dnb,1577317774.0,"Honestly it seems like James fucked these guys over completely. I wouldn't be surprised if that's why cowchop had to close doors. Like they mention ""paying off a millionaire"" i wouldn't be surprised is there was at least a lawsuit that happened but who knows. All i know is James Clearly didn't leave cowchop in any kinda of good way. Which really sucks. I'm excited to see these guys go forward though. And like they said in this video they did at the end find a really comfortable place and i think they made some great content. For the last huzzah."

witcher,fbyo94n,t1_fbyfg7p,1577221987.0,Nah brah look into all CDPR even offered him after the initial letter he sent. It wasnt good enough He wanted to rework the whole deal. And wanted more money. CDPR was the stand-up developer in this situation and the dude generally thought the games would fail when he saw how much his franchise was worth he came for more money. They settled out of court and CDPR was super nice and gave him even more than he deserved.

But restaurants can combat thus buy using food kitchens for unserved food. And for uneaten, partially eaten, food waste they can join a composting situation where you deposit food in buckets out a lid on them and a company comes picks up the containers composts your food and gives you new buckets"
