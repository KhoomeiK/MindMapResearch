agt,ffsofp2,t1_fdimz28,1580187069.0,"Yes I agree. The judging on champions is very poor and I think they are not going to have as good a final they could have. They have lost so many talented people due to this weird Superman voting and this final judge pick. I find I disagree with Howie’s choices the most. Always putting though weird acts just because he likes to be gimmicky, instead of truly talented people. It is hugely disrespectful to the acts who work their asses off to get there."
agt,ffsnxin,t1_fdhiuqp,1580186644.0,It should have been the dancers from Myanmar who made it through. Letting Hans through was a travesty.
agt,ffsnvu0,t1_fdhbvfm,1580186604.0,"I agree with the poster to an extent. A lot of their choices are about image and being PC, it’s been apparent in much of their judging throughout the years. I don’t think this started happening due to Gabrielle union though."
agt,ffsnp3b,t3_el7r24,1580186443.0,"Good for him. That was a travesty they let Hans through and made a mockery of the show. They took a spot away from two very talented acts. No one wants to see Hans again on champions. This is about the best of the best.The irony is that Simon did the same thing this week when he was the deciding vote and put through the 7 year old comedian, instead of an amazing violinist or the very talented and entertaining duo of Christian and Percy. I couldn’t believe Simon did that because usually he makes good decisions."
agt,ffsmxx2,t1_ffs0mah,1580185822.0,It is a little odd for a Lyft driver to ask to use their bathroom though. I understand if maybe he had diarrhea and just couldn’t hold it but otherwise I kinda feel like drivers should wait to use the bathroom in normal circumstances. As a young female I probably wouldn’t have let him into my house if I was alone and all. These are random people that I don’t know and I wouldn’t feel comfortable letting a stranger inside. Nothing happened though so I think it’s very unnecessary to blast him on social media.
agt,ffsmfti,t1_ffry0v3,1580185415.0,Yeah I never found her likable or genuine. Terry on the other hand is incredibly likable and warm.
agt,ffslp65,t1_ffsigcs,1580184839.0,"I wanted her to go through too. The champions citing is atrocious. It’s made me so upset for so many worthy acts who didn’t make it through because of these random super fans and that final judge vote. They put through Hans, that weird Star Wars dance act and now a 7 year old comedian. It should have been the violinist or Christian and Percy who made it in the judge pick over the kids."
agt,ffslkvx,t1_ffsims0,1580184750.0,Lol umm no she’s not from NYC. She is from England and was raised there.
agt,ffslehy,t3_eux455,1580184612.0,"I’m really tired of the judge’s picks. They make a mockery of the show. First they let Hans through, Simon uses his buzzer on some Star Wars dance act and then they let through a 7 year old insult comedian, as opposed to a great violinist or a very talented and fun gymnast and dog act. The kid tonight was fine but not worthy of the finals of AGT champions. I feel awful for these acts that work their asses off and deserve to make it and then lose out because of whatever political reason of the day the judges have for putting through an act that shouldn’t be there. The finals of champions is not going to be anywhere near as good as it could have been."

China_Flu,ffoyg3b,t1_ffn8qms,1580083280.0,Lol yes just stop living your life because of the risk of catching a virus that is equivalent to a cold.
China_Flu,ffox1hs,t1_ffov1ql,1580082828.0,5 hours!? It took them 4 days to come back with results from the Texas case.
China_Flu,ffowz5p,t3_eu4gl1,1580082798.0,Texas A&M case tested negative !
aww,ffowv6c,t3_eufcbr,1580082748.0,Cutie!
China_Flu,ffm0j6b,t3_eu1pje,1580046659.0,I’m patiently waiting to hear if the two Texas cases are positive. They are relatively close to me so I hope not.
China_Flu,ffm0boy,t1_ffkzkiq,1580046520.0,I don’t think it’s going to be as bad as you think. It’s not a very deadly disease. Flu is much worse.
aww,fflpg27,t3_eu64b4,1580042445.0,He has such cute spotting
aww,fflpc8j,t3_eu64x4,1580042379.0,Pablo wobbles but he doesn’t fall down! He looks like he’s perpetually had a little too much catnip. So cute.

aww,ffloi89,t3_eu65i7,1580042146.0,Adorable!!
sabrina,ffk2pdn,t1_ffhhmht,1580013969.0,"Yeah, he did in the apocalypse timeline but remember they go back in time so that means father Blackwood was reset to his normal alive and menacing self."
sabrina,ffk2k3k,t1_ffjuni0,1580013841.0,"There were only two cheerleading ones and two band practices that lasted for maybe two minutes. Wasn’t a big part of it or anything. Didn’t bother me to see them. I think they were kinda nice, fun interludes from everything else."
sabrina,ffk2c3p,t1_ffjmtde,1580013647.0,"Huh, I thought it was the best one yet. I think it is setting it up well for an interesting fourth season revolving around the time paradox. The accent of the voodoo queen is actually pretty consistent of someone with New Orleans creole background."
sabrina,ffk254f,t1_ffhd023,1580013483.0,What part specifically? I think it was tied up pretty well for the next season. Basically father Blackwood released the eldritch terrors that they spoke about in the beginning of the season.
sabrina,ffk235z,t1_ffh9i7r,1580013436.0,Same!
sabrina,ffk22yo,t1_ffj4bxy,1580013431.0,I thought it was great. I think next season will be very interesting with the time paradox she created.
