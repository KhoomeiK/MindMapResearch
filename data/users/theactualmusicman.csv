 It isn't necesarry to give up mine to provide care to others, either. But Bernie, to keep up his brand as the radical (despite being rich as hell and accomplishing less progressive reform than even the moderate) has to make it as radical as possible and take out the nuance of the policy entirely. This is a trend for him and frankly I think it's bad for the world.

The fact that you think any of the shit on that list is even close to Biden's record of mass incarceration shows that you don't really care about the truth as long as bullshitting people helps your candidate.
