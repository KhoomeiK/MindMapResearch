Many people with depression and other mental health issues are what is more commonly called ""passively suicidal,"" in that they have little interest in being alive, would actually much rather be dead, but have no desire to do anything about it

That's in contrast to actively suicidal, where they are making plans to take their own life

Passive suicidal ideation is a really big problem that's not talked about much. Particularly with depression, there's a layer of apathy that contributes to it, and they pay a lot of attention to how that plays out during treatment. It's common that someone can be passively suicidal and so deep in their apathy that they simply do not have the energy to do anything about it. There was a stigma against medication for a while because some people thought it triggered suicidal ideation as a side effect. Truth was, a person can go on medication and start to feel more energetic. Once the apathy lifts, their suicidal desires are still there, only now they finally have the energy to do something about it

But this isn't the real world, so you don't get to apply those rules. Yes, it is immoral to murder someone. But he doesn't murder people.

Nobody is perfect, so yeah, finding a bunch of scattered instances of Batman being physical with Robin across like 80 years of history isn't making it. He's an emotionally distant jerk.

No one else here has voiced much if any disagreement about the child abuse issue, and for good reason. That's absolutely unacceptable and unbecoming of a superhero.


I don't even *like* Batman. And, again, do you want a superhero to be perfect or what? He's a bad father figure. Everyone knows that. It's part of his character. What would be the point of making him flawless? 

Playing all this out, I'm not sure how you think it works better your way. A Batman who is nicer to his wards but brazenly murders people is more heroic than one who never kills but is emotionally distant and occasionally physical with Robin?"

changemyview,ff4on59,t1_ff4nyc6,1579568715.0,">Fucking your son's girlfriend behind his back and beating your kids aren't conflicts or character flaws, though. Those are straight-up evil acts. They're literally the acts that make one a villain. In any other franchise, any character that did those things *would* be rightfully recognized as the villain, and the same applies to Batman regardless of whether his fans want to accept that fact or not.

If you're talking about the killing joke insert, well, they weren't together at the time, so not sure how that works. And even if they were, cheating on someone is a shit thing to do, but unless you want to label a pretty healthy percentage of the normal human population **evil villains**, that's a pretty big stretch to jump headfirst at that conclusion

There are literally hundreds of Batman knockoffs who kill people. Why not just read one of them instead of taking away the thing that makes one of the most popular comic book characters of all time unique?"
changemyview,ff4ncup,t1_ff4l39n,1579567807.0,">People have been clamoring for a more villainous Batman for years now, particularly one who kills,

This is basically the entire 90s era of comics via publishers like Image. It was so horrible. The only good thing that came out of it was Kingdom Come written as a response

A Batman who just kills people is, in fact, a really boring character. It's his flawed psyche and ""ethics"" that are the reason he's endured

It's perfectly valid to not like that. Plenty of people think Batman sucks. There are hundreds of others to read instead

>Then he basically is just a supervillain. He's primarily motivated by simple selfishness. 

I mean, maybe if you're only working from a very strict Golden Age definition of superhero in which they must be perfect in all situations and at all times. Most people like some conflict and flaws in their characters and stories these days

Like, I prefer Superman to Batman every day of the week, and many people have that perception of his character, too. But even the blue boy scout is most interesting because of his struggles, of which there are many"

changemyview,ff4j4m6,t3_erlhqr,1579564850.0,"Speaking strictly through comic book logic, which is necessary here, I'm going to have to toss out the majority of your first point. Yes, it's physically impossible for people to survive the punishment Batman puts mooks through in the Arkham games. But it's also physically impossible for Batman to even do those attacks in the first place. This is an all or nothing acceptance of the text--if you're willing to believe that Batman can jump off the 40 story building and then perfectly aim a grappling hook at a gargoyle while falling at terminal velocity, swing off it without ripping his arms out of their sockets, land on the street below without becoming pavement pizza, and then take a shotgun blast to the face before fighting 30 men at once, well, you're going to have to deal with the fact that he doesn't kill any of them

>we're told that he doesn't kill because he adheres to strict principles that are supposed to apply to everybody and that this is the reason why he's a superhero, but if he's not willing to apply that reasoning to something like torture, how can the claim that he is supposedly a superhero hold any water?

For point 2, this is just not the case. Batman holds himself specifically (and those he trains) to a *higher* standard than everyone else. He never expected everyone else to do the same. He has no problem with cops using guns, even Alfred owns and uses firearms. 

He does this primarily because he knows killing wouldn't just be bad, but that it *would* make him a villain. Not just in a moral sense, either. He's self aware enough to know that he is not a normal person. He's a fucked up man with a laundry list of mental health issues including PTSD, and it's only his ""discipline"" and rules that keep that in check. Is that in any way realistic? No. But that's his character. He doesn't just beat criminals up because he thinks it's the best thing to do. He gets off on it. He needs it

And, yeah, the way Batman treats his wards is pretty fucked up, too. But, again, he isn't a normal person. He's doing what he thinks he can, and he's allowed to make mistakes. Being a really shit, even abusive, authority figure isn't justified, and it's an definite character flaw. He gets called out on it all the time, most directly by Nightwing. It doesn't make him evil. There's no active malice intended. It would be great if he was better, yet that's not really his character

For point 4, refer to my answer for point 1. Do you know that it takes like 5 minutes at least of someone breathing in airborne chloroform to even approach knocking someone unconscious? Comics and movies and books do not work with real world logic and science. And it's not as if comics even try to pretend otherwise"
