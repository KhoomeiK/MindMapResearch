If he doesn't have a cage then you should get him a cage just for this surgery. He's not supposed to move much at all until he's fully healed.

science,fd8yvdt,t1_fd8vpow,1578225568.0,"IMO the video is probably fake, but the visual phenomenon of ball ""lightning"" probably is better attributed to combustion than electricity. Visually similar phenomenon was produced in a lab by generating electrical arcs that touch (and vaporize) silicon oxide, which is in dirt. What happened in that lab was that the Silicon oxide vaporized, airborne carbon separated the oxygen from the silicon, leaving a ball of pure silicon gas which combined again with oxygen (combusting) to make silicon oxide. The glowing balls seen in lab came from the combustion of the pure silicon.

It sounds like your situation is very different, where the rabbits have an actual cage. If they don't prefer to poop in their cage when roaming around the house, then there is somewhere else (probably a secluded corner where they feel safe) that they'd rather poop. Identify that spot and place a lasagna tray filled with bedding there. They might think their cage is too wet from urine (I'm assuming it's a solid floor and not a wire floor), but probably they just don't want to poop there because of the location.

4 More ""wait til the end of the day"" than ""right away"", but a little bit from both columns. Sooner is always better, you don't want the smell to stick, but no you shouldn't need to watch them like a hawk. Moving the poops while they're still wet to the ""correct"" place seems to help a lot."
