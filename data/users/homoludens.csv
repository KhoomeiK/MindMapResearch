The way you have written this story really sounds like he was gaslighting, or more precise he is bothered but not ready to accept and/or say that. Reasons for this can be many and most of them are benign.



Yes, we can overreact, but that doesn't mean there is more of a story behind always asking ""what are you doing"". 



Yes humans are complex beings and our interaction even more and apparent contradictions can be very frustrating. Learning to accept this frustration and ambivalence is very important to me.

Maybe you get really focused on the phone so he gets a bit jalouse, or it triggers his trauma he is not even aware of...



I can go on and on making possible explanations for your current situation that makes no one at fault, just two different traumas triggering each other."

No it does not.


It does sound like you are hurt and not being cared for. Your parents don't want to listen to you and not do something, we can only imagine how it looked like when you were  baby in need and not being cared for.
