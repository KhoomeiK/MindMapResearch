It's not just the temperature, but the acidification of the oceans and the changing of weather patterns that will painfully drive many species to extinction. Humans can obviously survive much worse conditions, so we will in a sense be fine... but greener technology isn't going to reverse the trend of the earth becoming less habitable. We will of course eventually go through the 6th mass extinction, and by 7 billion years from now the Sun will have exploded and enveloped the Earth."

What other animals are burning vast quantities of fossil fuel? None. The worst offenders are cows, due to the methane in their farts. Anyway, the earth is warming, and it's causing a change in the weather. The fires wouldn't be so bad if it were a few degrees colder... or so the Libs say.
