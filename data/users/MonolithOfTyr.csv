To keep my kids from doing similar things or using their devices when they should be asleep I have them on a separate network that turns itself off on a set schedule. They can't reboot it to change it and if they hard reset the device it'll stop communicating PERIOD due to the way I configured my network.

I have no contract preventing this as far as I know. I've had plenty of graceful exits from organizations so finding my way around that will be easy.

I only escalate tickets when it's completely out of my wheelhouse. Even then we have a process in place where our dept sup must approve every single escalation so no dumping things on other teams for BS reasons. It works well and keeps things nicely balanced.

No word if this is a plan to move IT in-house for this client. To my knowledge we have a very good relationship and they likely just want someone who can handle things quickly and more cost effectively. I've worked at places before where we had internal IT and an MSP for major things like wiring up entire new offices, server maintenance, etc. It worked quite well and no toes were ever stepped on."

I remember being scared of something happening to my wife during the delivery of our oldest. I blame 80's and 90's TV where the mother always died in childbirth. That said, I did NOTHING like this. I joked with my wife about it maybe once and she laughed with me at the notion. These guys... Hooo, they be crazy about it."

AmItheAsshole,feerjqs,t3_eoq0fz,1579039684.0,I have to say NTA. I have 3 kids and they can get loud when playing. It's normal. When I was a kid out playing with my friends we got loud. Nobody complained Except old busybodies with nothing better to do. There are a bunch of kids where I live and they like playing outside. unless they are right outside my home I don't hear them. These grumps are being just that.
AmItheAsshole,feeqdpj,t3_eoley4,1579038996.0,YTA. My wife's dress was $85 from a small dress shop where we live. She looked absolutely amazing in it.

AmItheAsshole,fds0tlu,t1_fdqcoeq,1578692493.0,"This wasn't addressed at me but my experience is relevant. I've been doing professional IT work for about 16 years now and I'm 37. I got started by fixing stuff at home, building PCs and networks for family/friends. I thought about getting certs but the cost didn't seem worth the payoff as IT pay is kinda crappy where I live. My oldest was born when I was 26 and my wife was 24.  I was working a job that was at a 24/7 operation and I never got holidays off unless they fell on my regular days off. I hated not seeing my  wife and daughter. I left that to work from home for less money but we made it. In my free time I'd study and learn and apply those skills. I managed to get $6/hr in pay raises in 8 months doing that. Used that new experience and knowledge to get another job with greater pay. Took what I learned there and finally got a job doing corporate IT making 55K/yr. That job eventually got to be too stressful so I left for a competitor where I managed to make one of my life goals of making 60K/yr. Still no certs or formal education in the field."
