Yes the argument could be made that they would benefit from this financially, but I do respect that they acknoledged on a creative  level the importance of this too.

It's a shame that never happened, but the GoT show-runners had to rush and leave to go create a Star Wars trilogy so it's worth it right? ... oh wait nevermind."

It’s nice to think civilization will be some sci-fi futuristic world. But I think we will do something stupid, wipe out most of civilization and then start anew. 

Maybe that’s what happened on Mars. There was an advanced civilization, things got messed up and so they sent their purest to Earth. While Mars got nuked to oblivion.

I went to the dentist to have a filling done, laid back in the chair and he turned on futurama on the tv right above me. 

Then he put numbing gel on my gum so I wouldn’t even feel the needle. Stuck the needle in, did the filling. 

No pain, no fuss, no worries!

Years later that filling failed and it’s turned into a root canal but the moral of this story is that life can be a bittersweet bitch sometimes."

patientgamers,fdwydf7,t3_en6s7t,1578763499.0,"Micro-transactions are unnecessary in video games. 

Especially single player games. 

I can’t stand the “it’s just cosmetic” excuse some people use. Whatever happened to earning cosmetic items by playing the game?

We turned what used to be a reward for an accomplishment into something you pay real world cash for. 

Publishers have also managed to convince gamers that this is the only way to support and maintain a video game. 

Whatever happened to sequels and expansions?

Because of this incredibly greedy practice I find myself running into increasingly grindier games that are purposefully designed to frustrate you to the point of giving in and buying their micro-transactions. 

Video games are meant to be an escape from frustration, not a cause. After you buy the game, that should be it in terms of financial exchange.

Slowly but surely the quality of our games are being eroded away, and quite depressingly companies are raking in billions of dollars.

To get a full feature complete game without lootboxes or micro transactions is a rare find in the AAA sphere."
