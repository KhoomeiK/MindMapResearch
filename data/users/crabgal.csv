socialanxiety,ff6r609,t3_eryxeb,1579633159.0,"That sounds like it is social anxiety. The situation that warranted my diagnosis was a panic attack at the Smithsonian zoo, which is a large public place. In a way it’s similar to your situation. For a long time I had issues with public places with large crowds as well, but through exposure therapy that’s gotten better. 


Also, social anxiety is different for everybody. Some people work well with people and enjoy socializing, some people can’t keep friends to save their lives. I, personally, struggle to maintain conversations and relationships with my peers, but I’m okay giving presentations and talking to authority figures. It’s good to ask questions in a group like this, and I’m glad you’re taking that initiative. I had to go through my diagnosis alone and it was hard to find the answers I needed. I wish you luck in treating and understanding your anxiety, and I hope this helps!"

On a separate note, some people (myself included) feel awkward or weird carrying on text conversations and have a hard time figuring out what to say. If you get the vibe that they don’t want to talk, walk away from the convo and try again the next day. Either they will warm up to you or they just don’t want to talk to you. I’ve lost acquaintances because text convos make me uncomfortable, but if they had kept trying, I think a friendship could have bloomed..."

AskReddit,fevg7l6,t3_eqlu5a,1579396973.0,"I quit cheerleading my sophomore year. It was almost like getting out of a toxic relationship. I also had bad anxiety back then and had struggled to make some friends. A year later, right around the time I would be going to summer practices, I had this dream: 

I was sitting in a lecture hall type of room. On a small stage in a clear glass box were all of my new friends.  All around me is my former cheer team. They’re all watching as the head coach berates me, telling me how horrible of a person I am and why I don’t deserve to be happy. She insults me, and basically calls me all the things that I worry I am. I couldn’t do anything, just let myself be yelled at and watch as my friends listened to what my coach had to say."
