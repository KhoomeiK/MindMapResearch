Down Here we have 3 redditors trying to farm some points, they caught the attention of a confession comment that is apparently vulnerable and ready to be ripped on by the trio. 

Here comes  the approach of the first specimen Spock\_Savage,  oh he uses a classic ""git gud"" oh but the hit goes wide and the user runs away with the tail between its legs.

Now its the turn of the second one Taktika420 with another old classic move ""Lol noob"" oh and what a miss and the public dint appreciate that at all.

The third specimen ImNudeyRudey probably seen the approach of the other two before, and thinks two words are no good, and goes for one word heavily accentuated ""Nnnnooooooooooooob"" look at that smug smile that is sure nailed it...but what a disaster even the last one has been denied

The trio retreats ashamed not even bothering to cover their defeat in fear of more downvotes they go hunting to another subreddit..because you know this one ""was shit anyways""."

did they put a condom on a dildo and pushed it in to a  flashlight with special liquid   to see how much would get inside the condom and vice-versa?
