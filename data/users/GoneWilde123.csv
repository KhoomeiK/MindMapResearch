ThanksManagement,ffbv3qk,t1_ffblxbp,1579783776.0,They’re sending him this email prior to an in face discussion. They’re sending him this e-mail for written records. Pretty sure not a single HR/management person would send this garbage for someone’s written record when they’re about to have the chance to go off not on the record.
ThanksManagement,ffbukd0,t1_ffbtinf,1579783252.0,If you do what you’re supposed to do and they still talk to you like this your job is not safe there. Cross T’s and dot I’s my dude.
blunderyears,ff7mn7m,t1_ff7hvba,1579653189.0,Photobucket changed their coding and then lost their licensing last I checked. Those images are somewhere but no longer privately searchable last time I checked.

todayilearned,febygm7,t1_feadv6r,1578964297.0,"In Florida, honking is usually done when someone does something deadly or sits through a red light while nodding out. It’s still “you want a piece of me” sounds for us. 

(Also, if you’re going 70 in the left lane and someone behind you is approaching quickly while honking its means you’re going to get hit unless you move.)"
whatsthisrock,fe4jmoy,t1_fe4f2rn,1578860010.0,"Yeah, I didn’t like that confidence so I looked through hundreds of photos (slowly narrowing search refinements) and stated “No way. The colours are too bright;” went to close the window on mobile and saw the images side by side.

You win."
todayilearned,fdmxbxx,t1_fdmtxcw,1578570029.0,Vargas is a dead link? That’s so sad.
thesims,fcxlo1l,t1_fcxli40,1578065934.0,That’s how I feel about gardening. All of my sims are pro-gardeners. I’ve even made public farms but it’s just not the same.
todayilearned,fcm76gf,t1_fclso3m,1577766011.0,"Without fail I always burn the roof of my mouth on pizza, forget, and end up eating a grapefruit 48 hours later.

My dentist gets so concerned when she sees heat and acid burns at the same time. Poor woman."
BrandNewSentence,fc9ykvm,t1_fc6ek6u,1577560141.0,If you wrote this do I have permission to send this out to all of my family members during the holidays? I love it.
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fc220ja,t1_fc21h2j,1577337275.0,Plot twist: You have hundreds of alt accounts. In fact you don’t exist. You are part of the mainframe. NWO.
blunderyears,fc217mx,t1_fc1gesk,1577336426.0,"Charmed actually tried! They didn’t just go the easy route (“witches have magical powers that are summoned from satan”) and actually used Wicca. They referenced how Wicca was their moral guide throughout the entire series. Yes, things were sensationalized for TV purposes but they were always really sensitive to the real religion."
AskReddit,fbzxwkw,t1_fbztxm8,1577267672.0,"I’m an American that eats like this. I tend to be a “one meal” person but that meal usually takes 1-3 hours and has multiple parts. (I’m stressed so it just looks like unhealthy binging but when I’m eating right it helps a lot.)

I tend to go to restaurants during slow times and I work in the business so I stay low demand, outside, and tip fairly for “camping”/“renters fee.” I receive extraordinary service this way and never feel pressured to hurry.

I’m not humble bragging but if you want that experience while dining in America I would advise not going during peak hours."
