Complex in World War II- Mark Harrison"", well, their bits on manpower anyway.

> However, the privileges accorded to defense industry were of limited use when
the supply side as a whole was crumbling under the impact of devastating military
blows. Towards the end of 1941 the initial momentum faltered and nearly gave way
to collapse... the collapse of the civilian economy, which directly threatened the supply of power, metals, machinery, and
transport services to defense industry. According to an official report,
Beginning in September, and right to the end of 1941, a decline in industrial
output occurred. At the end of 1941, industrial production amounted to only
one-half of the prewar level. The output of nonferrous rolled metal, cable
products, and ball bearings, had almost completely ceased. Average daily
railway shipments at the beginning of 1942 had fallen to 36-37 thousand
truckloads, i.e. one-third of prewar shipments.

> ... From material balances compiled
within Gosplan, roughly 14 million defense workers in material production can he
identified in 1942 – a quarter of the working population – compared with nine
million in 1940 (again, this is an incomplete figure). If we combine this change with
the change in military personnel (excluding internal troops of the NKVD), we find
that numbers generally employed in supplying military goods and services grew by
at least 11 millions in two years. On the supply side was a decline of 32 million in the
available working population over the same period. Adding these figures together
gives an astonishing total of at least 43 million to be subtracted from prewar
nondefense employment

Considering the sheer amount of material gained through lend lease, I would have thought to produce such equipment on their own would have been impossible, because more production means more workers (which they didn't have). Part of the cause of the food shortages were a reduction in agriculture from 49 million workers to about 24 million."

They were critically deficient in a lot of manufactured goods and high tech stuff, as well as food. Civilians were on starvation rations while front line troops would often have to stay put to farm their own food, but lend lease supplied 4 million tons of food.

Half the ammo was supplied by lend lease. Ammo was super vital, and it was a thing the nazi generals persuaded Hitler not to help the Soviet's with.

Trucks, trains, & communication equipment were vital. Aluminium was another, where it's estimated without lend lease soviet air production would have halved.

I dunno, I just (mis)remembered reading something about it a while ago but it's not proven. There was a study where they had guinea pigs infect each other without physical contact, dry cold air was the highest chance of transmission. Emphasis mine.

> Three mechanisms could potentially explain the observed influence of RH [relative humidity] on transmission. The first acts at the level of the host: **breathing dry air could cause desiccation of the nasal mucosa, leading to epithelial damage and/or reduced mucociliary clearance, which would in turn render the host more susceptible to respiratory virus infections.** Long-term exposure to dry air is likely to affect influenza virus growth in the upper respiratory tract, and may indeed play a role in influenza seasonality. Nevertheless, based on the brevity of the exposure of naïve guinea pigs to dry air before becoming infected (less than 72 h), we do not believe that this mechanism played a significant role in the observed effects. The second mechanism acts at the level of the virus particle. The stability of influenza virions in an aerosol has been reported to vary with RH [12,14,15]. The most recent of these reports [12] shows viral stability to be maximal at low RH (20%–40%), minimal at intermediate RH (50%), and high at elevated RH (60%–80%). The similarity between these data on stability and our own on transmission is striking, and suggests that the stability of the virus in aerosols is a key determinant of influenza virus transmission (with the exception of the absence of transmission at high RH). The third mechanism acts at the level of the vehicle, the respiratory droplet. At low RH, evaporation of water from exhaled bioaerosols would occur rapidly, leading to the formation of droplet nuclei; conversely, at high RH, small respiratory droplets would take on water, increase in size and settle more quickly out of the air
