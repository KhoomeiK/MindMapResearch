BipolarReddit,ffdemsg,t1_ff8o7zs,1579819264.0,"Ohh, ok. I understand the feeling of a rock in your stomach. I’ve been having issues with the dizzy also. It almost sounds like this is a side effect that won’t go away on its own. 

I’m going to try the fasting  and see if that helps. I’m thinking  if I can force my stomach into some type of eating pattern I can reduce the window in between meals. 

Thank you again so much for your response !"
BipolarReddit,ffdcwft,t1_ff7ww6a,1579818218.0,"Oh man, I’m sorry to hear that :( I completely understand the feeling of waking up with anxiety and paranoia. Do you have this reaction every time you increase dosage ? I had the same thing happen when I first started my medication. My doctor reached back out to me and is keeping me on 100mg of Lamictil and putting me on 200 mg of Seroquil. I know I’m going to need a higher dose than the 100 mg"
BipolarReddit,ff8be8s,t1_ff7mzns,1579671782.0,"Have you had any issues with zero interest in food ? My stomach will growl horribly but when  I eat it almost makes me feel sick. As if there’s no flavor to my food. If you don’t mind me asking, are you still losing weight as a side affect or is your food intake still low ? 

I really appreciate the response. As awful as it is that you’re dealing with this, it’s nice to know it’s not just me."
BipolarReddit,ff8b22z,t1_ff7n6tm,1579671452.0,Absolutely ! :)
BipolarReddit,ff7lkpb,t3_erscgh,1579652449.0,I had a similar situation a couple of weeks ago. When I realize I’m laying in bed trying to turn off the radio that’s my thoughts and that sleep is impossible I will usually get up and make some tea. I’ll put on something funny to watch or grab a good book. I’ve noticed fighting my lack of sleep will put me into a panic attack but if I roll with it I seem to do better. Hope this helps !
bipolar,ff4g2pu,t3_ere5no,1579562757.0,I love it ! Sunflowers are my favorite !
