Dont worry about how you think you'll make others feel about gay people, people who aren't stoked on us feel that way because they probably don't know any gay people, so consider yourself an ambassador and show them being LGBT isn't what they expected and that it's actually quite normal."

AskReddit,femjzmu,t3_epyom3,1579259444.0,"In high school every class would do a mock drunk driving accident to scare us before prom, complete with the local fire department cutting up a car in the parking lot and the EMTs taking them away in an ambulance. One of the girls who was part of the demonstration drunkenly crashed her car like two weeks later and almost died. 

In middle school we took over night field trips, in 6th grade it was to a summer camp out of state were we spent the weekend. One of the guys in my cabin took a shit in the shower, no one ever admitted to doing it.

In elementary school, 5th grade specifically, one of the girls brought her mom's dildo to school and showed all of us. I was part of a car pool so my mom drove home me and three other kids. When we all told her about the dildo she almost crashed the car."
