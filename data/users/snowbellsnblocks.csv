At least once a week I do a heavy pressing session sometimes more if I feel okay. I pretty much fit in swings according to how I feel on that given day. Usually one workout is dedicated to swings and cleans only. Another day is focused on squats. I understand it's not that structured but I do all this along with climbing so I just kinda see how my body feels. Basically I have specific workouts I'd like to get done in a given week and as long as they are done I don't really care exactly which day they are done. 

It can totally be done. I think sometimes you need to adjust what you do on a day based on how you feel instead of on Thursdays I must do xyz. As long as you can stay disciplined there's no reason it can't work."

It may be okay but just be careful especially with more and more weight. I only notice because I've had the same problem. When you lack hip internal rotation pointing the feet out makes it easier to get into a deep squat. With that, the knee MAY collapse inward and this places a great amount  of torque on the knee which can be harmful. Also this position doesn't allow the arch of the foot to be it's strongest.
