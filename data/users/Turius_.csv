NintendoSwitch,ffkfsxs,t3_etwkr1,1580022056.0,This is one of the best pieces of art I have seen on here.
VitaPiracy,ffjsm93,t3_etsneq,1580005839.0,Where is this game on the echelon of Vita JRPGs? Been thinking of downloading it.
oklahoma,fff8zm1,t3_et5xpx,1579878682.0,This is right up there with Oklahoma is “OK” in how bad it is.
funny,ffc52kl,t1_ffc3uzh,1579791711.0,"Wow, glad you are able to live a somewhat functional life. Even 10 is too many though. Hope you can improve that number even more."
todayilearned,ff62s8b,t1_ff5z580,1579617687.0,"Instead of insults, explain it to me wise one. Because right now I’m seeing a bunch of probably single, 20 something burnouts who think it’s cool to be bored with life."
todayilearned,ff62ggk,t1_ff5y5ic,1579617449.0,If you’re okay with it then you must find some joy in life. Keep living it like you are.
todayilearned,ff5xfim,t1_ff5t952,1579613437.0,"I can’t imagine just thinking everything in life is boring. I wish there was more time in the day to invest more in the things I’m interested in. There’s so much amazing shit out there to explore. Challenge yourself, set goals, go back to school, travel...have kids - I guarantee you that isn’t boring."
todayilearned,ff5x2ml,t1_ff5scwt,1579613119.0,Something is going on if you don’t see anything interesting in life. You might want to see someone about that.
JRPG,ff3wh8k,t3_eri3c0,1579550360.0,Just remember that FF7 is just part 1 of the game whereas Persona 5 Royal is THE definitive edition of the game so buying a collectors edition I’d probably go with Persona.
VitaPiracy,ff0656j,t1_fezvea9,1579465630.0,"I believe there is a fan translation available. I haven’t tried it so I’m not sure how good they are. Also, Falcom recently revealed they are working on bringing those games to modern consoles so hopefully we get a ps4 or 5 release eventually. Here’s the link I found for the fan translation patch.

VitaPiracy,fewlvn8,t1_fewaovc,1579414026.0,"There is an English release on Steam. The Evolution release has updated art, music and added Japanese voiceover for the dialogue. I think the battle system is tweaked as well. They also pull the camera back a little more when you’re walking around which makes a huge difference to me since the game felt cramped and it was hard to tell where you were going sometimes in the older version. After playing this version, I like it better so far, but some purists would disagree. There is a way to add the art assets and Japanese voices to the Steam version for a similar look."
VitaPiracy,few700e,t1_few6hk9,1579406210.0,"External. Downloaded the game from PKGJ and patched it from my computer. Here’s the link where I got it.

VitaPiracy,few2jiq,t3_eqqlvx,1579404584.0,Just picked up one from Gamestop and hacked it to use as a Retro/JRPG machine and it is amazing. Just loaded up the Japanese/vita version of Trails in the Sky FC evolution and installed the English patch. So awesome!
windows,femeobt,t1_femcufn,1579251573.0,I’m getting the Oops! Something went wrong. It’s probably us message after trying to sign into my MS account through windows. I ended up giving up and going to bed. Tomorrow if it doesn’t let me sign in I’ll probably do a clean install and start from scratch using an Ethernet cable to hopefully immediately sign after install.
NintendoSwitch,feiugih,t1_feiqlfs,1579147527.0,"Also, flipping through the glossy, fully color instruction manual was pure joy when I was a kid. No longer a thing unfortunately."
JRPG,fedux2n,t1_fedj43s,1579020422.0,Doubt it. CD Project Red is an incredible company and they know what they are doing. Nobody in the industry has a better track record right now.
nba,fdqc7ik,t1_fdpllvc,1578662710.0,Presti has said the Thunder are open for business so Unfortunately half this team will probably be traded away by then.
tifu,fdqadu6,t1_fdq3id6,1578661073.0,Edibles fuck my shit up more than anything else. AND they last FOREVER.
nba,fdpkpep,t1_fdpbgqn,1578631298.0,I was at that game. Never been anywhere louder or more hyped in my life. It was amazing.
Trophies,fczgrbv,t1_fczftwr,1578100899.0,"It’s a pretty easy trophy, just long. Death March difficulty is tough at first but pretty easy after you level up a bit. I’d guess it takes around 100 hours to platinum. I followed this guide for my platinum run.

NintendoSwitch,fcusnwl,t1_fcub1an,1577987726.0,"I’m playing the Witcher 3 on switch and it’s worth it for portability. It’s the only way I’m ever going to get through it all since there are other newer games I would rather play on my TV at this point. It’s obviously not the best looking way to play, but it’s a pretty damn incredible accomplishment."
nba,fcpuzhv,t1_fcp49oc,1577872700.0,First and second year I believe before going back to New Orleans.
changemyview,fcoofpe,t3_ei8ckv,1577837351.0,We have a guy in the White House who’s entire MO throughout his life is deflecting and never accepting blame. Seems to have worked for him just fine.
NintendoSwitch,fcofywy,t1_fco10ko,1577831304.0,They’ve been making incredible games since before I was 5 years old and developers who grew up loving Nintendo games now work for them. So they aren’t going to stop making amazing games anytime soon. Historically probably the greatest video game company of all time and top 5 developer as far as games now.
personalfinance,fcnhuay,t1_fcn1h9d,1577812017.0,Don’t worry about those social skills. They will come along with time and life experience. Especially now.
Trophies,fclvd10,t3_ehsy71,1577757377.0,"Great game. I probably got more than half-way through, but then I got so frustrated with the map and getting lost that I didn’t go back. Need to get back to it and finish."
NintendoSwitch,fcgpc98,t1_fcgogeq,1577642652.0,"That’s fine. My point stands. It should have been in there at launch if it is the best way to play, which it sounds like it is from all the comments. I may go back or I might not. I have other shit to play. All the glowing reviews at launch I think are probably merited now. It was just frustrating at the time to see how deep the game is from an RPG/Strategy perspective and just wipe the floor with everything and never come close to losing a student or a battle.

Thanks for the discussion. Have a nice day."
NintendoSwitch,fcgnp90,t1_fcgnguf,1577642150.0,I paid $60 for a product I expected to be finished. It wasn’t.
NintendoSwitch,fcgn9u0,t1_fcgidvz,1577641950.0,"Yes, such gall to pay $60 for a game and expect it to be challenging. An unfinished product for two months counts as free content in your eyes."
NintendoSwitch,fcggq6u,t1_fca11s2,1577639769.0,Maddening came out 2 months after the game launched and I had already moved on from it. It should have been there at launch was my point. Clearly many other people agree with me because I did not expect my inbox to be blown up with that comment.
Trophies,fcanbz2,t1_fcal2v9,1577572671.0,I have it on PS4 Pro and it doesn’t run even close to a good PC.
oklahoma,fc9y1n0,t1_fc95ua3,1577559908.0,I’ve known a few people who came back from that place straight brainwashed.
NintendoSwitch,fc72d2d,t1_fc724q1,1577495688.0,I might do that. The mechanics are really fun though at times repetitive doing the same thing in the monastery over and over again. At some point I just asked myself why I was even bothering to min-max my Byleth when he never got scratched on missions and I never came close to losing an ally after the first couple hours of the game. Glad they released maddening but it should have been there from launch.
