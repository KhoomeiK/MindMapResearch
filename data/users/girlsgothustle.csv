Other times, they've listed multiple items and don't remember what they listed them as before, so they end up with the same items at different prices. Traders will also list items for different prices, so they can test the market and see how high they can go to make a profit when the value swings. An item might be at $1k when someone lists it in their bazaar, but as demand shifts and the item becomes more valuable, it behooves a bazaar owner to have a few priced higher to take advantage of that swing in value."
torncity,ffbu1t2,t3_esh5ko,1579782733.0,"I don't know why people are telling you that reselling on the market is a waste of time, I made tons of money doing just that when I was new. I'd buy low at the bazaar price, then list it for the lowest market price. By not undercutting, everyone wins and prices stay reasonable, and your listing is the top one so you sell first. A lot of people simply search for items and buy them from the market instead of the bazaars, so buying low and selling high works very well. Sometimes undercutters will completely ruin an item's market value - like with the kitchen knives. I've sold those for up to $35k, and sold them almost daily for $5k-$8k, but they've been saturated with people selling them super cheap, so that item's resale value is practically ruined.   


You can also often find cars valued at less than their resale value at the docks, and find items int he market priced less than what they'll auction for. You just have to be diligent and check often."

RimWorld,ff5umwu,t1_ff2v9hu,1579610831.0,"Yeah, these ruins look good, until the entire world comes crashing down on you in the form of a giant raid for the loot. These are best left until mid-end game when you have an army of OP dudes ready who can take on an army. Until then, avoid them at all costs! I also learned this the hard way, so you're not alone. To escape, draft your colonists to the edge of the map and walk them off manually. Good luck!"
RimWorld,femvy1y,t3_epo054,1579271032.0,"I decided to play a random naked and afraid challenge. I ended up with a 17-year-old boy and decided that I would only recruit children under the age of 20 for my playthrough. I have children mods, so I'm getting kids as raiders and drop pod survivors. It's challenging in different ways, and I've decided to protect their morality, so no war crimes. I'm trying to NOT go full-on Lord of the Flies. :)"
3Dprinting,fehfvqp,t1_fehf3tz,1579115693.0,"I've seen posts about layer shift. I'll have to read more about that. What causes it, and why would it not affect the entire print on that layer?"
3Dprinting,fehfsqk,t1_fehfo2c,1579115644.0,"Yes, it's just the one leg (and a draped sleeve for my other mini)."
3Dprinting,fehezg1,t3_ep6o65,1579115168.0,"At first, I thought this mini turned out great, but then I saw that the left leg was in the wrong place. I printed another mini yesterday that had a similar issue with a sleeve. What causes pieces to print offset or incorrectly like this?  


Ender 3 Pro, Cura Slicer. I am currently having an issue where the first layer of my raft does not print - can this contribute?"
Ender3Pro,fefda2x,t3_eomwt9,1579053839.0,"Thank you for your replies. I was able to get her working again. I took out the filament, took apart the extruder and cleaned it, and cleaned out the nozzle as well. I put it back together and made sure it was working by disconnecting the boden tube and launching a print, and it did. I still wasn't getting much filament on the bed, so I releveled. It's printing now, but did not extrude any filament on the first layer of my raft, so I'm thinking I still have some leveling issues."
Ender3Pro,fefcz8c,t1_feeicj6,1579053646.0,"No cracks. The wheel was quite dirty, however."
Ender3Pro,fee7b3h,t1_fee4p59,1579027881.0,Thank you. I'll go through that process and report back.
PrintedMinis,fedpr4z,t1_fedooh0,1579017233.0,There is a link to the download for the stl on the pdf.
3Dprinting,feaz6sb,t3_eo7gr6,1578953774.0,"Minis are a tough print. You can get them to come out quite well, even on an ftm printer with pla. Here's a video from Tomb of 3D Printed Horrors that might help you tweak your settings for a better outcome:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqEWl51s9Rw&t=601s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqEWl51s9Rw&t=601s)"
3Dprinting,fe2k393,t1_fdy46lb,1578839340.0,"Search YouTube for ""Ender 3 Upgrades"". I found several videos with printable upgrades and explanations as to why they make the printer better. I have a pro version, so some of the items had to be adjusted or weren't needed. You can also search thingverse for ""Ender 3"" or ""Ender 3 Pro"", depending on your version, and see a host of upgrades you can print for free."

3Dprinting,fdn7q91,t3_em7ttg,1578579563.0,I too could use this. We just started teaching both the kids and grandparents how to play!
Ender3Pro,fdlhuy4,t1_fdkilhs,1578524351.0,"Fixed it! My new filament had different heat settings that were needed, and I wasn't properly leveling the bed. She's back up and running smoothly again. :)"
Ender3Pro,fdl5aqn,t1_fdl56rj,1578517287.0,"Nah, ignorant and impatient. :)"
Ender3Pro,fdk79q8,t3_elsap2,1578497691.0,"Now I have a new problem. I'm trying another print and the printer won't load new filament. Upon closer inspection, it looks like there is a section of the old filament that ran blocking the advancement of new filament. No filament is coming out onto the bed."
Ender3Pro,fdjwdz5,t1_fdjv7c0,1578489658.0,"Thank you. I actually haven't even opened up a slicer program yet. I leveled the bed and printed what came on the drive, and that's all I've done so far!"
RimWorld,fdh5exk,t1_fdgxue3,1578415761.0,"While I consider Psychology an essential mod, I actually like the Leadership mod much better for elections and stuff. I use both together and disable the elections from Psychology and feel it's a lot nicer. Psychology's mayors go on mental breaks a lot because they're constantly being complained to by their constituents, causing some horrible negative mood effects. The Leadership mod allows both the colony leaders and followers to be regularly buffed via inspiration instead, which is a nice addition to the election process."
RimWorld,fdh4qju,t1_fdh2kon,1578415344.0,I too would like the ability to sort workshop mods by type! That would be a wonderful addition.

RimWorld,fc2l2pw,t1_fc0nfdi,1577365502.0,"I've got well over 3k hours and have never even built the dispenser. I guess it's because I like cooking IRL, and can't imagine my poor colonists eating paste. Yuck!"
RimWorld,fbyl4j1,t3_ef3czz,1577219673.0,I have to go to my mother-in-law's tomorrow and I'm dreading it. I'd much rather stay home and play Rimworld. sigh
