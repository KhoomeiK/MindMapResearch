elderscrollsonline,ffiatw6,t1_ffi4lpw,1579969455.0,"Go in numbers! Don't have a guild or friends that will run it with you? Then throw out the question into zone chat, see if anyone else would be interested in doing quests, hunting skyshards, fishing, etc.

Or, go into one of the emptier campaigns."
elderscrollsonline,ffia7un,t1_ffhyl34,1579969035.0,"This is called ""soft stacking"". You may hear someone in your group say to soft stack - what they're asking is for you to put a little room between yourself and your group mates. Don't go far! And try to not be on the outside of the ring if you aren't wearing impen gear. :)

Also, when you are stacked, like at a flag, throw down your aoe heals and shields on your group and keep them active until you are moving again."
elderscrollsonline,ffh5skd,t1_ffh4nig,1579923899.0,"No clue. Maybe they're a jerk. Maybe they linked it accidently - I know I've done that before while trying to lock the item. Maybe they were showing the gear to their buddy that was running with them, because they had been farming it for a while and were excited that they finally got it.

My point it, you can choose to think that there were nefarious reasons that they didn't give you the gear. Or, your can choose to think that it's not your gear, so nothing was lost since it was never yours to begin with. 

Either way, you still don't have that gear - do you want that interaction to anger you and potentially ruin your experience? Or, would you rather see it as another opportunity to have fun killing monsters? 

It doesn't really matter what reaction the other player may have been trying to elicit from you (in the case that they were flaunting it and not willing to trade it). In the end, you're the only person that has control over whether you get upset or not."
elderscrollsonline,ffh3npk,t1_ffgys6h,1579922232.0,"They spent their time doing the dungeon. It's their gear to do with as they please. 

Maybe they're farming gold, by selling the gear. Maybe they've got another toon they want to run it (ya know, the gear that *they* farmed) on. Maybe they felt like the tank deserves first dibs on that Ebon chest since it's tank gear. 

Doesn't matter. No one owes you gear in a pug, just because you called it out first."

This made me giggle way too hard!

I have traded many blown kisses with enemy players on my baby pvp toon. :) I learned early on that throwing up my shield and just kinda standing there is also a decent strategy for indicating, ""I just want your skyshards/ocean fishies/treasure map chests, not your life"". :D"

elderscrollsonline,ff694tj,t1_ff5kq17,1579622040.0,"As a new healer, I'm astonished at the number of my healer friends that don't throw out buffs, debuffs, resource regenerators, synergies, etc... I love my healer, and she's now pretty much my main, because she's so much more complex to play than my petsorc (and doesn't have that annoying flappyness getting in everyone's way!). Like, I would be so bored if all I did was toss out heals.

My only request of my tanks is to let me know if they need more resources or synergies. I can light you up with resources and synergies!! But, only if I know that you need more than I'm giving."

Narrator - They are not.

Lol! As a Templar, I can easily switch gears to dps or a strange hybrid - depending on how much brainpower I have towards regearing/reskilling her. It's always fun to realize, mid fight, that you forgot to unslot resto skills when you swapped it out for a destro, heh! And don't get me started on the number of times I realized that I ran half a trial with my pvp jewelry still on...

I really need to have a checklist of all the things I change out between her different roles, lol!"
elderscrollsonline,ff66k7m,t1_ff60194,1579620345.0,"I am usually a huge fan of spoilers and knowing exactly what I'm getting into in a dungeon, but man am I so happy that my friends and I stumbled across a mysteries nightstand on our first playthrough. We were all just fumbling around in the dark and trying to figure out what the hell we were supposed to be doing was such great fun!

The dungeon is beautiful and trippy, the bosses were fun, and the story and mechanics only serve to enhance its awesomeness!"
elderscrollsonline,ff2vq33,t1_ff2upw2,1579525989.0,"My guildy ran across a ""Mysterious nightstand"" during our first play-through a few nights ago, opened it (cus, ooh shiny!) and this wisp flew out and led us to an indrik ground. I looked it up and found [this oldish reddit post](http://reddit.com/r/elderscrollsonline/comments/ax2qk5/the_great_indrik_hunt/) from [u/sadistic01](/u/sadistic01) that was really interesting, and also has the info you've asked for.

I promise, I'm not trolling you, lol! We ran another guildy through it last night and the whole time we were looking for the first mysterious wisp she thought we were sending her on a snipe hunt - making her look for something that doesn't exist.

But man, that dungeon has easily become my favorite and I can only imagine it's because I'm able to really enjoy the beautiful scenery and the fun mechanics because of the buffs."

Daily crafting writs on a singular toon should net you around $6k a day, easily."
elderscrollsonline,ff2cn6p,t3_er7qnc,1579500831.0,"And don't forget to do each of the hidden Indrik grounds between the bosses. The buffs they give upon killing the golden indriks will help you fly through the rest of the dungeon. Spending the extra few minutes to go through all three grounds will make the other bosses a cakewalk to kill and the Wyrd sisters (first boss) end up being the toughest boss of the dungeon.

Plus, you get a fun momento and a bonus chest after killing the final boss."

elderscrollsonline,fesksd3,t1_feshmee,1579366254.0,"You can make all the items for your writs and have them waiting in your bag. For ease, I jot down the info I need to craft all the writs that I've procrastinated on doing - so, I'll make like 50 items at once, then just go through and open a writ while in front of Rolis, turn it in, then open another.

To help guard against mistakes, I'll craft all the items, leaving them at white and double-checking that I've got all the stats correct before I actually construct the item. Then, after I've made everything, I'll level them to blue/purple/gold all at once. I'll again check the stats on each item before leveling them from white to green. 

My fail rate on catching mistakes (something made with the wrong trait or style) is really low (at around 1%) at Rolis. It's more around 5% between the crafting and leveling part of the process - and that's quite a few tempers/tannins/rosins that I've saved myself from wasting!"
