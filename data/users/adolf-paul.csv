OnePiece,fcuoczb,t1_fcuboov,1577985254.0,"No what I'm saying is we can presume Roger was weaker than rocks and was weaker than whitebeard(when he became king) so for luffy to be king it's OK for him to not be yonko level and only needs to get the one piece to be king. This is further supported by how Oda wouldn't ruin one piece just so luffy gets an asspull power up and does want to end the story soon. This means luffy probably has 2-4 at most arcs left to get to King level. However we already know arcs that need to happen which are; Elbaf, Raftel and the war that follows the discovery of the one piece. The world government, other yonko, revolutionaries, destruction of fishman Island all have roles to play in this short time Oda is leaving to end the story. I doubt he will go from getting one shot by a yonko to being on that level within that time. However he can use his friends to get to the top as Oda has always made luffy rely on his crew. It just makes sense."
OnePiece,fcu7e9u,t1_fcu1wlc,1577974323.0,Roger was sick so there is now way when he got king status he was the strongest not to mention he still needed help with Rocks pirates meaning Rocks was the strongest and Roger needed help to get to the top.

OnePiece,fctedsm,t1_fctdy3v,1577940591.0,Like I said I don't think Oda cares too much about making him the top of the food chain and is happy to show luffy using help from his nakama to get there. Oda isn't going to give luffy a bullshit power up so either we get another time skip(I doubt because Oda wants to end one piece within a few years) or luffy never makes it to the top alone  and relies on zoro and other powerful friends to get there. Though I think he will beat blackbeard in a 1v1 at the very least. We see in the most recent chapter ((((SPOILERS)))) SORRY I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THE TAG) Roger was strong but not stronger than whitebeard but on the same level and had to help in the fight against rocks meaning he was weaker than rocks but still got king status.
Showerthoughts,fctdwb0,t1_fctdsy3,1577940165.0,Yeah probably
OnePiece,fctcsyv,t3_eit0cx,1577939226.0,I suspect he will use a lot of help and exploit some random weakness kiado has. Oda is very deliberate and reasonable so there is no way he would let luffy jump to yonko level right after the jump to commander level he just had in whole cake island. Luffy may never actually get to yonko level but still find the one piece.
