rugbyunion,fgs591j,t1_fgqou9o,1581072247.0,"His priority is presumably staying in England. I imagine the cap scandal will squeeze salaries across the Premiership. 

Hopefully it’s a sign that he’s expecting Leicester to see a bit of a resurgence with the new coaching setup next season."
me_irl,fgpfdfl,t1_fgp1vat,1581003693.0,He’s evidently using hyperbole to make a point.
rugbyunion,fgpdyvt,t1_fgp5qqr,1581002873.0,In league the equivalent position is called loose or lock forward. But in union a lock is a second row.
ABoringDystopia,fgnba8f,t1_fgn6wu7,1580941261.0,The state already assumes responsibility for educating children and has them in their care during the time that they do so.  I don't think it's a massive overstep for them to feed them during that time too.  It's providing a material benefit to the children and doesn't assume the role of parents.  I don't see the state ensuring children in their care are fed as a negative.
ABoringDystopia,fgn506n,t1_fgmzst3,1580937822.0,I too am terrified of the slippery slip of the government *checks notes* feeds children.
ABoringDystopia,fgmuer3,t1_fgmpfb8,1580932262.0,Two would be better. Even three. One is a start though.
todayilearned,fgmmx4l,t1_fgmm196,1580927857.0,Yeah. Russia has an official moratorium (notwithstanding any extrajudicial killings) and its banned by all the others.
ABoringDystopia,fgmlm8g,t1_fgmg93c,1580927080.0,Guaranteeing every child at least one healthy meal a day sounds like excellent policy. Of course it would also require that schools ensured the meal options were healthy.
todayilearned,fgmleeq,t1_fgmft8f,1580926949.0,There is the European Arrest Warrant.

todayilearned,fgml2ci,t1_fgmjcch,1580926748.0,"I don’t know about America, but the role of the Probation service in the UK is broader. People on non-custodial and suspended sentences, as well as those who are out of prison but haven’t completed their entire sentence can all have to cooperate with the custodial system."
rugbyunion,fgm8th5,t1_fgjhqj3,1580920074.0,I’m not sure his selections make more sense in the context of him thinking about the next World Cup.
soccer,fgm3jhs,t1_fgln7dj,1580917326.0,"You seem to assume that FIFA and the IOC have identical rules. It might make sense for the Olympics to allow individual athletes to compete, but I can’t see FIFA letting a team other than the team that’s officially sanctioned by the national FA."
soccer,fgm3233,t1_fglyh6z,1580917021.0,"All junior academy players are treated as an investment. Even if they’re not from overseas, a lot of kids have fairly significant disruption to their lives only to be cast out when it’s decided they’re surplus to requirements."
soccer,fgm2qsc,t1_fglzgkr,1580916823.0,"It sounds like bollocks. Americans aren’t unique in being able to produce fit athletes, soccer isn’t getting their elite athletes, and their popular sports don’t require the same physical qualities that make a good footballer."
rugbyunion,fglxp96,t1_fglpsc9,1580913483.0,I enjoy it more when we’re winning.

rugbyunion,fgj74i8,t1_fgiuylp,1580838251.0,New Zealand tried playing an extra second row at flanker in the semi to disrupt our line out and it was a disaster for them and not us.

unitedkingdom,fggd864,t1_fgg186h,1580759414.0,Jewish is an ethnic group as well as a religion. A lot of Jews aren’t religious.

rugbyunion,fgg6wt0,t1_fgfc8vp,1580755554.0,I sometimes feel like he’s let the celebrity status get to his head a bit. But overall he’s still a very good ref and he’s been good for the sport.
AskReddit,fgfpbs6,t1_fgf1byp,1580744556.0,I don’t think anyone has actually used the word snog since the 90s.
rugbyunion,fgfo2if,t1_fgfjuwj,1580743720.0,"Fair enough. It seems pretty level to me, and a fairly good chance for someone like him to prove he can go from defence coach to be head coach."
rugbyunion,fgfit6p,t1_fgfdor9,1580739913.0,Is the A-team head coach not a similar level to being defence coach?
rugbyunion,fgf610a,t1_fgf5f5y,1580726378.0,It’s a PR statement.
rugbyunion,fgf5za1,t1_fgf2yn9,1580726303.0,"I wonder if he’s going abroad. The tone of that message makes it seem like he wouldn’t play elsewhere in the Premiership, and he seems to have come to terms with the fact that his international career is over."
rugbyunion,fgf57t1,t1_fgcg91b,1580725092.0,"We were hardly impressive overall in the second half. Both tries were created out of nothing and while our scrum was good, we never actually managed to turn it into anything."
soccer,fgcm829,t1_fgbjgbx,1580674028.0,He was in Cats. And he’s done some stuff on the West End and Broadway. He’s pretty much moved on from British TV for the most part though thankfully.
rugbyunion,fgclq4r,t1_fgcfmzi,1580673869.0,Apparently I forgot not to make jokes during the Six Nations.

rugbyunion,fgbfujd,t1_fgbcwgs,1580661672.0,He said halfback*s*. Which would imply he meant both.
rugbyunion,fgbdxtd,t1_fgbdoes,1580661137.0,If he makes it through this Six Nations. He’ll get his 100^th cap. Hopefully they’ll decide that it’s them time to call it a day.

rugbyunion,fgacd6w,t3_exmfn8,1580649625.0,"I think it feels like this has come round pretty quick after the World Cup. With that and the mess in the Premiership, I can see why you could feel a bit less excited. 

We had a good World Cup apart from the final, so we don’t have the excitement of a new coach and cycle and it’s also ages until the next one so it’s a bit of a weird one for England fans. 

I get more and less into it too, partly just depending on what else I have going on in my life."
rugbyunion,fgac0cg,t1_fg9y73e,1580649466.0,"I can’t imagine how clueless you’d have to be to think he should be dropped. It’s undoubtedly an absolute howler, but it’s a single mistake and he’s far too important for them to not be picked."
ukpolitics,fg7gkui,t1_fg6dj39,1580591995.0,"The AV referendum wasn’t advisory. The legislation specifically required the Secretary of State to introduce the provisions within the act to change the voting system. 

Constitutionally there is no issue with parliament delegating a decision to another instrument, whether that’s a referendum, a devolved parliament or whatever. The EU referendum being advisory was either by design or by oversight and not simply a constitutional inevitability."

rugbyunion,fg63dud,t1_fg3djco,1580551495.0,He was lethal at the start of his career. If he’d kept his try scoring rate up he’d have beat Williams by now.

worldnews,fg0519r,t1_ffzz9k3,1580400365.0,"I’m not an expert on infectious disease. But obviously for a pathogen to go from one species to another there has to be proximity. Having those markets with loads of different live species means a lot of people are exposed. 

But also in China, there are a lot of cities, like Wuhan, with huge population densities. Having a lot of people in a small space means that any diseases are able to  spread rapidly. 

People in the US generally aren’t in as dense populations so diseases would spread less quickly. There are probably other factors in the US’s favour like higher hygiene standards."
worldnews,ffzmhew,t1_ffzm07z,1580385953.0,"Again not unique to China, but having people piled on top of each other like they do in Chinese cities combined with the markets is what makes it a recipe for disaster."
rugbyunion,ffziwut,t1_ffzbz79,1580381430.0,"I’m guessing they do it this way so that people know for tickets and flights etc. 

If they were just going to do it based on ranking six months out then they could just sack off even bothering with a draw. Do 1-4 and 9-12allocated A-D, and 5-8 D-A etc."

soccer,ffuwegy,t1_ffuq1sr,1580250612.0,It’s not like it’s your money he’s spent. It’s just that United fans are so used to being dominant that you have no perspective on what it’s like for a club to actually collapse.
rugbyunion,ffuqb5w,t1_ffu51x8,1580247280.0,"That semi-final will in all likelihood be remembered far longer than almost any Six Nations match. 

It’d be lovely if English media and fans could wait for us to lose something before going negative."
rugbyunion,ffu5vqv,t1_ffu513m,1580235148.0, I don’t see why they have to have anything to do with each other. The Lions and Aus/NZ/SA wouldn’t be playing in a tier 2 cup and there are two other years in the cycle that the tournament could be held.

rugbyunion,ffqz9pl,t1_ffqbpqs,1580146983.0,They’ve been relegated and paid a massive fine. It’s not that limited. Cancelling all their games would lead to a fairly significant loss of revenue for all the other clubs.
rugbyunion,ffqx2mt,t1_ffqstul,1580145591.0,Yeah. I’d imagine there’s an exception for injured players. A lot of junior games have rolling subs too.
