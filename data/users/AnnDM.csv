relationship_advice,ffizcnp,t1_ffiyziq,1579986464.0,This is only the opinion of an internet stranger provided with limited information so take it with a grain of salt.. but has she felt uncomfortable towards her co-workers? As in something happening and her wanting to take someone off her.

If you go back into it at full force it might cause a lot of troubles and make you sick. There was a post from a vegetarian who ate chicken broth and got very sick.

His part of the story would be that I wasn’t there for him and would look for constant attention (I was there for him, he never opens up to me and then blames it on me and expects me to know what he is thinking- and the attention part I am actively working on, I just didn’t get the kind of love I needed from him, but after all I need to love myself and not expect it from others and I take the full blame for it).
