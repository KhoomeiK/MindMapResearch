socialskills,fe8g0ue,t3_ent281,1578925774.0,I feel the same way. I honestly end up being left alone while my friends get whisked away by some guy and I just excessively drink and make sure they don’t get hurt or whatever. It’s lame so I stay home usually..

relationship_advice,fe3gygv,t1_fe3072q,1578849151.0,Yeah I totally understand where you’re coming from. But if she’s defensive every time it’s most likely because she’s guilty for something. Anyone who wants to be with someone will be willing to listen to their issues. Seems that she won’t.
AskReddit,fe2ss7g,t3_eno2m6,1578842434.0,"Depends. Are you bringing them down? Staring like a jack ass? Humiliating them? Cause we don’t need to be told by some average joe were fat. We are well aware and some of us are doing something about it, some aren’t. 

Im far from mean but if you’re a bully, I don’t think it’s being mean to tell you to fuck off lol so idk"

relationship_advice,fe2rn28,t3_ennyz6,1578842100.0,"Sorry you’re going through this. I honestly don’t buy the whole “I don’t want people in my business” ordeal. Because what happens if you guys progress? (Which I’m sorry to say, I doubt you will see this) Also, I noticed you apologized a lot when she flip her shit, and gets her way. That’s probably why she isn’t worried about you pushing the issue because you’re not putting your foot down. You need to be firm and tell her it’s bullshit. 

Easier said than done but honestly, you’re just in for a long haul of hurt if you don’t call her out. So it’s up to you after at that point to proceed or drop her. Good luck!"

rant,fdi65tf,t3_elegey,1578436418.0,"I remember there was a thread about a dude that asked if he was an asshole cause the girl he was banging (who knew it was no strings, nothing was to go further than just fucking. Not even friendship) claimed that he was an asshole cause she was trying to pillow talk and talk about deep shit and politics . He didn’t want to engage more than he had to and when she was mad he wasn’t reciprocating, he was called an asshole. 

I said he wasn’t an asshole, she’s pushing boundaries and knew what it was from the start. She agreed to just be a fuck toy lmao and I got my comment deleted for no reason except everyone was calling him an asshole and I said he wasnt. Smh that sub is a joke lmao"
rant,fdi5nl8,t1_fdi5hko,1578436171.0,"I definitely learned my lesson, and been called “bitter” for it when I sense just a hint of that bullshit and nip it in the bud. It is definitely draining."

I hope it works out but know that you deserve someone who wants you and only you. Anyone allowing theirselves to fall for someone else isn’t worth the time... it just won’t make the rest of the marriage that fun. Happy new year."

I mean, I get why everyone is up in arms about OP being an asshole but she’s the dumbass that sticks around if he don’t wanna do more than fuck her, she clearly knows this and still pushes it lol. Sure, OP seems like a dick but as they said, he’s not her boyfriend and he doesn’t want to engage in conversation especially politics. 

OP, did you set the boundaries before hand? If so then yeah, tough but if not maybe you should lol"

TrueOffMyChest,fcgousf,t3_egwcu2,1577642449.0,"I realized I have it at a later time in my life, as far as sexual abuse. When it came to sex, losing control made it hard for me to be intimate with anyone even if I trusted them with my life. It’s really scary and it sucks.. and then I was in a wreck over the summer, wrongfully blamed as I hate driving with other people. Last night I almost cried driving with a friend to a bar, it was misting and he was multi tasking (texting, checking phone,) on the interstate. I just prayed and made sure to text my mom I loved her, it’s bad but thank you for this post.."

This is not how relationships work, and people settle because it’s comfortable but you are going to grow resentful towards him. You’re young don’t worry about finding the “one” find someone you can grow with and then you will know who is the one. This guy is going to anchor you down with his issues."

relationship_advice,fcamrv7,t3_egx8cl,1577572343.0,"Well I’m so sorry about that happening, but if no one was aware and you didn’t speak up.. it just goes that way. It’s okay to distance yourself, and try to cool off. However, I don’t know how good it will be to tell him how you feel, it’ll get awkward. Such a shitty situation, I’m sorry."
AskReddit,fcame5v,t1_fcalttd,1577572119.0,"So you want to live the rest of your life “sucking it up” ? And could you sit back later on in life older feeling good about everything while sitting on your money with that shitty job, and shitty, energy draining people with that toxic significant other? You think you can over come that and still be happy?

It’s simple, life is not guaranteed tomorrow or the next. You don’t need to surround yourself with negativity when you can help it. Sure some things you have to get through to get to the better side but self care/love is important. You should try it and not just settle..."
