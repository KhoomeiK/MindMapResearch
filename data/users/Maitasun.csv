But man, vampires are really the weakest creature in WoD, lol"
WhiteWolfRPG,ffc0bs7,t1_ffbz2i6,1579788259.0,"I might have translated the terms wrong, lol. But I’m pretty sure conscience is in the third column, right under mental attributes."
WhiteWolfRPG,ffbynz5,t1_ffbvw2n,1579786937.0,Paradox.
WhiteWolfRPG,ffbxeku,t3_espoop,1579785866.0,"In V5 at least, you can roll Resolution + Conscience (difficultly 4) to know if a mortal has the blood you need."
WhiteWolfRPG,ffbvl1v,t1_ffbiuha,1579784230.0,"I was so expecting that clip. thank you, good sir."
WhiteWolfRPG,ff9zk5q,t3_esft4c,1579724858.0,"My Giovanni has a ghoul, Frank. This guy somehow convinced him that he is a great fighter and would work awesomely as a body guard.

Turns out he just has great charisma (and my character is also an idiot), so Frank likes to pick fights he cannot win and always solves my character problems but in the most inconvenient way. Once, my character needed a phone, and Frank gave him an Iphone. It was blocked, it was robbed. Somehow the police got involved. And that’s everyday (night?) of my unlife with Frank, the most useless yet loyal ghoul ever created. 

Moral of the story: Give your players fucked up ghouls too, they can be fun and annoying and lead to interesting stories."

But, whatever floats your boat. This drawing at least reminded me to one of my players, lol."
vtm,fezttxq,t3_eqswu6,1579461578.0,"I honestly apply the exact same, thanks for writing it."
todayilearned,fea3p3u,t1_fe67ed2,1578944037.0,Can you imagine? But I don’t think so. She might survive trains but her weakness is tripping with her own clothes.

todayilearned,fea3805,t1_fe69wa3,1578943906.0,"Not everywhere. I live in a little town that nobody cares about, why would someone bother putting signs in it? Also, I have never seen those gate things anywhere in my country."
todayilearned,fea2rjx,t1_fe681y1,1578943780.0,You read it right. She’s tough af
todayilearned,fe64t5t,t1_fe60b9u,1578881795.0,My grandma’s car decided to stop working just while the train came. It impacted and crushed the car but besides some ugly bruises nothing happened to my grandma. Moral of the story: cars are weird.

chile,fdyjwcg,t1_fdyc9dl,1578780604.0,"Demás, entiendo tu punto y hasta cierto punto lo aplico. Pero lo personal es político, hay cosas que no puedo dejar pasar. Pero tampoco me junto con gente que piense exclusivamente igual que yo, hay una variedad de matices políticos, y el filtro se hace solo con la gente de derecha, porque tampoco aguantan muchas cosas y todo lo tachan de comunista al toque.  

Y bueno, la familia, porque ahí no hay mucho que hacer, una de mis tías favoritas le tiene un altar a Pinochet en la casa y csm."
chile,fdyajkj,t1_fdww903,1578777711.0,"La vida no es mas linda si te juntas con gente que quiere menos justicia social para ti o para el resto. No me es agradable juntarme con gente que trata mal a los inmigrantes, por ejemplo. 

Me parece bakan que puedas socializar con todo y dejar debajo del tapete cosas importantes en pos de la buena onda. Lo intenté, no pude. Entre mas cuico mas aweonao. Me imagino que obviamente tiene que haber gente que no cae en ese prejuicio. 

Tengo suficiente fascistoide weta en mi vida, no necesito mas, ni darles oportunidad de nada."
chile,fdy9mlm,t1_fdwsd3h,1578777490.0,Asumes mal :)
chile,fdy9fcn,t1_fdxvktt,1578777415.0,"La verdad no me interesa conocer gente mas diversa, estoy super bien con mi grupo afín. Y de todos modos, he conocido mucha gente en la vida (no vivo debajo de una piedra). Desde derecha moderada hasta extremistas y todos en algún momento se aweonan con los derechos básicos ajenos."
chile,fdwics4,t1_fdwfkw5,1578758941.0,"Igual no estaría con una persona de derecha. Una tendencia política es una visión de mundo, ni ahí con relacionarme con alguien que cree que hay que quitarle derechos básicos a otros humanos. Digo yo."
Cringetopia,fdsl6q0,t1_fds2vbk,1578704604.0,"I know moral is not religious based in all cases but I’m biased to think that because of a country full of fuckers who can’t hold a real moral debate without always talking about God. Sorry about that tho, my bad."
LAbyNight,fdsibmw,t1_fds52xc,1578703292.0,"True, I totally forgot about the Beckoning, lol. Poor Vannevar."
Cringetopia,fdryyus,t1_fdru3ai,1578691856.0,"I mean, idk what I was expecting but it was not a discussion about morals on the topic. But yeah I think that as long as you don’t put the word ‘God’ into your definition of ‘moral’ it counts as secular.  Thanks!"
Cringetopia,fdryf33,t1_fdrtxg3,1578691584.0,Exactly. Not a secular reason imo.
Cringetopia,fdrqsyw,t1_fdrowfs,1578688214.0,Which one? I’m honestly intrigued because never have I found a secular argument for anti abortion laws.

Honestly, he seems like an asshole too."
WhiteWolfRPG,fdgh2et,t3_el6ao8,1578396477.0,"How’s that everyone gets a wholesome moment? 

My coterie is full of assholes (myself included) and the ONE TIME that I tried to make something wholesome my shitty Sire ruined it by looking down on me. 

Fucking Ventrue, they ruin everything, lol"

Congrats on your finding!"
WhiteWolfRPG,fcqixxn,t1_fcpl3lt,1577886825.0,Totally! This is super cool!

Will the neonates try to stop him? Join him? Will they even become aware of what’s happening? 

Funniest one shot I’ve ever ran."
WhiteWolfRPG,fc6esr0,t1_fc61kq3,1577478871.0,"I mean, I’m pretty damn sure that all the reasons that Twilight should be hared for, you’re not thinking in any of them. Probably just sparkling vampires."
rpghorrorstories,fc1w4xj,t3_efiuje,1577331552.0,"Fuck those guys. If I was the DM I would’ve kicked them right there. As a player too, probably. 

On an unrelated note, I **LOVE** the name Victor."
