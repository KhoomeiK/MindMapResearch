Just in case anyone is reading. We were getting closer. The problem is defaulting to the idea that god has to abide by what we see as reality which wouldn’t be applicable for a truly omnipotent being. It (unintentionally) limits god. 

The mention of the temptation of Jesus doesn’t really disprove what I’m saying. The argument must be that a Jesus *could* turn the stones to bread without *any* negative consequences, but chooses not to. It must always be a choice. So god could achieve his goal of “saving” us without a sacrifice but he chose to for some other reason. 

I haven’t heard any good idea of what another reason could have been except for the idea that it’s a show for our benefit to prove a point. Which is really odd.

So now we’re gone from Jesus doing things because of the curse, or a guilt thing and now it’s root is The Law. So far from being a good explanation that just throws up the same question. Who defines and controls the law? Why is Jesus subservient to the law? Why would Jesus be below the law and not above the law? 

The reason nobody is above the US law for example is because everybody else holds them accountable to it. If we are talking an old King, they could be above the law because no one had the power to hold them accountable to it. 

So for Jesus to be below the law with us, we would have to have the power to hold him to account. That would not be the case if he was actually god and actually omnipotent. The only way he could be below the law would be if he chose to pretend to be. Then we’re back to the unanswered question: why?

> Whilst you disagree with the actions the child took (not paying attention etc), the child's salvation IS dependant on your action to save them from themselves if they are to be saved. The action is a mercy to the child born out of love and compassion.

> So in your equation where properly X is to save and Y is  to act, your assertion is that God cannot save without action, which I agree with wholeheartedly but then you say therefore God cannot overcome action which is demonstrably false because Jesus came in the flesh and acted.

Sorry you didn’t get the point of my XY by using the car analogy. 

In the car analogy for you to save the child (result X) you must push them out of the way and lose your life (action Y). You can’t achieve X without doing Y even though Y is undesirable, not what you want. That’s because you are limited and not very powerful. 

Now take your car example again but now you’re Superman. You *can* achieve X without paying Y because you’re so fast or so indestructible that you just swoop up the child. 

God if he exists would have to be so powerful that there *is no possible X that would require any Y* he would be able to achieve *anything* without *having to* do anything. Anything he wanted could just happen. 

The only way that the whole crucifixion can be from an all powerful god would be done is if he chose to do it *not* because he had to to achieve something. Or he’s not all powerful.  

So then the question is: if he chose that when he could have just achieved his goals without it... why?"

“This curse is simply God's disapproval. “ So Jesus, who is god, did something to remove *his own* disapproval?!

To quickly summarize: the sacrifice is meant to appear to us as a debasement or cost because of our mortal understanding, but obviously god can never actually debased or lose anything.  He’s doing it for us to show us how much he cares. 

But. Once you now realize that idea, the appearance of debasement or cost is now seen as just an appearance and not a reality, and then then it ceases to be a thing that has value. You can’t stand on the sidelines and see that without realizing that it therefore has no effect for you. 

For example. If Warren Buffet in disguise meets you in a Subway and says “I was going to buy myself a sandwich but instead I give this $10 to you”. You’d say “wow, what a nice guy”. To me watching on the hidden camera I say “psht big deal, he has billions he has sacrificed barely anything. He couldn’t hand over $10 fast enough to even outpace his earnings per second”.

You mentioned the ancient people feeling that their land was “unclean” or they had “shame” or there was a “curse” that needed to be lifted.  Those all sound like either simply the feelings they had or superstitions. I don’t see how those can be claimed to be anything otherwise. How were those real things?

The ideas behind capital punishment nowadays (if you agree with them or not) are around deterrence and removing the threat. Vengeance is not longer seen as a suitable justification. It appeals to our monkey brain, but it’s not actually a valid requirement outside of that appeal. 

For proof just look for interviews of the families of people whose killers were executed. For some the execution brought them peace, for others it did not. If it came at all it was later through acceptance. Others find peace even when the killer is not killed. Which shows that it’s not the fulfillment of the vengeance that has the benefit, but instead the change in the individual’s mind. 

Do you see what I’m saying? The fulfillment of vengeance was not *necessary*. It can help, it can not. Therefore it can’t be a “thing that *must be* done”. We could choose to do it, but it’s not a requirement 

I’m not saying you agree with capital punishment or that Jesus’s sacrifice doesn’t play into that yadda yadda. But just use this to substitute this for the Jesus thing. 

It appeals to some part of our monkey brain as I said, but that part of our brain is grounded in our limited existence in reality. Why does it annoy me when someone takes my banana? Because now I don’t have a banana. It’s a limited resource that a limited body could use and enjoy. It’s a fact of our reality.

But I’m not following your alternate proposed explanation. I get the idea that it’s for our benefit (and I’ll address that separately maybe), but the idea that it’s to represent god’s spiritual realm debasing of himself doesn’t seem logical. 

It’s entirely contingent on human mortal ideas of shame, humility, honor or whatever, and the mortal idea of that being a cost. (*)

Shouldn’t all things be effortless and without any cost to god if he’s truly all powerful? If there’s a thing that has some emotional or consequential cost for him to do, then who is he paying that cost to? 

Think about it like this. If someone does X but there’s the negative consequence Y, then by definition they are not all powerful. Otherwise that contingency would not have to exist. If god forgives our sins, but has to sacrifice some dignity, then he’s not all powerful. Because an all powerful god could forgive sins without that cost.
