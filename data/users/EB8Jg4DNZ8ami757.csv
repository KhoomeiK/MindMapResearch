Okay we agree here.

>Unfortunately for them they are part of our food chain.  

This is circular logic. We eat them because they're part of our food chain and they're part of our food chain because we eat them. We don't need to eat them though so there's no need for them to be part of the food chain.  

>I think we can eat less meat, step off from the shitty meat factories and occasionaly eat from a free range farm or hunt yourselves.  

80% of all agricultural land and 25% of all ice free land is used for livestock currently (http://www.fao.org/animal-production/en/).  The current system is much more efficient in usage than hunting or ""free range farms"", but it's still destroying virtually every ecosystem. Reverting to hunting will instead directly impact those systems.  

>Suffering is part of life.  

True.  

>Prey animals suffer, but it is an necessary evil.  

All animals suffer. Why *choose* to create more suffering? Does that not make your actions inherently evil?  

>I do need meat to live.  

You don't though.  

>I am not willing to take supplements.  

Livestock is supplement with cobalt (for ruminants) and cobalamin for non-ruminants. You're already taking the supplements, just through a filter. B12 is produced by soil bacteria.  

>If you need supplements to live healthy that is an indicator for me that your diet is wrong.  

This is a naturalistic fallacy. I used to use this same one when I ate meat. You could eat unwashed produce, you could drink from streams, you could have bits of soil in your diet, but it's safer and easier to just take a supplement. Simply because it's a supplement doesn't negate it's efficacy or deride from its use.  

There is no biological necessity for us to eat animal products. In doing so you're making a choice to create suffering. Vegans are just trying to make a world with less suffering in it."

>Do not unjustly eat fish the water has given up,  
>And do not desire as food the flesh of slaughtered animals,

>I washed my hands of all this; and wish that I  
>Perceived my way before my hair went gray!  

The bees did not gather their honey for us so why should we hurt these bees who have toiled away to support themselves and their kin?  

*Personally*, I don't entirely object to the keeping of hives but I do oppose the collection of honey. Hives die because we take their honey. *Maybe* spring honey with the less harmful hives (I can't remember their names) would be ideal, but we don't need honey. I'd rather the bees enjoy the fruits of their labor than steal it from them.  

The suffering they endure in the wild is different than us making the choice to make them suffer. Exchanging one for the other doesn't make it ethical as you're choosing to inflict suffering."
AskReddit,ff7wj6u,t1_ff7b420,1579660042.0,"The linked study says ""high honey bee densities"", not exceptionally. That is an important difference. High honey bee densities would be the result of commercial apiaries.  

The vast majority of soy is used for livestock. Actually, the majority (80%) of all agricultural land is used for livestock. Regardless, you'd find few vegans who support pesticides that cause harm to life.  

Veganism opposes the suffering of animals. Killing bees or otherwise causing them to suffer to take their honey, which is not a necessary foodstuff, is antithetical to the ideals of veganism. The  industrious bee did not collect honey for you but for them and their hive.  

The false dichotomy you present isn't a choice one has to make. You can both forgo honey and oppose damaging pollutants."

It doesn't even make sense what you're trying to say. Reduced demand will mean reduced amounts of cattle. Cattle don't breed naturally in animal agriculture to begin with. If more people eat less meat then there will be less cattle raised for slaughter.

>Osteoporosis in laying hens is a condition that involves the progressive loss of structural bone during the laying period. This bone loss results in increased bone fragility and susceptibility to fracture, with fracture incidences of up to 30% over the laying period and depopulation not uncommon under commercial conditions.   

https://academic.oup.com/ps/article/94/4/816/1554578  

>Commercial laying hens also spontaneously develop ovarian cancer at a high rate, and susceptibility to this disease has been associated with ovulatory events in women.

Inhibition of ovulation in hens through a hormonal strategy mimicking oral contraceptives results in a decrease of ovarian cancer incidence.
