SeattleWA,fffp7yg,t1_fffnp4c,1579888807.0,Darn well I tried. But tell all your friends how awful it is so nobody else follows you. It’s expensive enough and too crowded now.
SeattleWA,fffnk6s,t1_fffmndd,1579887795.0,Don’t do it. Denver or Austin are much better to move to.

Seattle,ffdqr9w,t3_et0yjx,1579826667.0,"Thought Alaska had it? They sent an email a couple days ago, it was Alaska Pavilion or something."
AskReddit,ffdcxl4,t3_esse9d,1579818238.0,"Did a little backpacking around Europe and met up with a friend for a portion. Think it was a train station in Hungary and a train pulls up 5 minutes late. We’re watching from above as you take some stairs to go down to the platforms. A man in a suit sprints down the platform, shoves an older women out of his way, and rams his way through the people trying to get off. The train doesn’t leave for another 15-20 minutes as everybody deboards and the next passengers get on. I assume he was also foreign and was used to stricter timetables or something. But watching the scene unfold was a good laugh (nobody was hurt) and he was the only person in an extreme hurry."

SeattleWA,ffcktbe,t1_ffck1e7,1579801583.0,Seattle city prosecutor. Aka the guy who decides whether the city prosecutes criminals or not. He’s had a lenient view on crime past few years so every other violent offender in the city is almost guaranteed to be a repeat offender. Dunno anymore.
Seattle,ffcekuh,t1_ffbqacu,1579797780.0,"Basically don’t eat at McDonalds downtown. The one on 3rd actually has drug deals and sketch people going in and out constantly. People getting stabbed, etc. the one on Westlake just has homeless people, some are mentally ill. Not necessarily unsafe but might feel uncomfortable."
science,ffajq10,t1_ffa63vy,1579737439.0,Nobody’s carrying a helmet around on the off chance they can hop on a scooter share service.
aww,ffa9tnh,t1_ff9t8ad,1579730690.0,The [mirror test ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_test)  is supposed to indicate if an animal has self awareness. I think the idea is that self awareness is a precursor to conscientiousness. Don’t quote me on that but somehow it’s related. But there’s lots of critiques of the mirror test.
todayilearned,ffa71zg,t1_ffa1ll2,1579729136.0,I think you’re thinking of gene expression. You could have this gene and then something would trigger it eventually.
AskReddit,ffa5la7,t1_ff9qzy9,1579728329.0,The problem is limited overhead space and everybody brings as many carryons as possible because they charge for baggage and nobody wants to wait or risk losing their stuff because airlines are incompetent. So they board in order of premium seating as a perk to incentivize upgrades because then you’re basically guaranteed overhead space.
worldnews,ffa4owv,t1_ff9vrxu,1579727825.0,Anybody know if he lives in Everett or if he was just transferred there because of isolation? Dunno if other regional hospitals have that option.
science,ff85wzi,t1_ff80r01,1579666884.0,Haven’t heard about destroying supply to maintain prices. The government subsidizes the crap out of corn to make it cheaper. That’s why it’s used as filler & sweetener in every processed food.

Seattle,ff4hfo6,t3_erikvh,1579563691.0,Direct them to a shelter and then go volunteer at such places. You want them to utilize the provided services since it gives the government an accurate picture of the problem and allows them to push for treatment and stuff. If you give them cash or food then they sneak under / avoid the system. Pressure them into it.
IAmA,fetigpk,t1_ferr20v,1579375776.0,Has it been different carriers? Usually if it’s their own and they fail and you complain then they make delivery notes for future drivers.
worldnews,feo5zr1,t1_fenj76y,1579295543.0,"Except that the massive stream of traffic from North Seattle to Redmond everyday because of Microsoft employees. And that before Microsoft, Redmond was farms. And not considering the buildings that Microsoft had downtown, which I think just recently closed shop (in the last year)."
science,fekrjwt,t1_fekdn4f,1579206129.0,Did you train this behavior or what? I have a high energy kitten who I imagine would love it if she could figure it out.
Seattle,fehm1c2,t3_ep51nc,1579119282.0,"I think the MoPoP could be better but it does spend a couple hours or more. It’s a lot of seeing (guitars, costumes, props). But not a lot of reading so there’s limited context or history or story. As a result I felt that some of it falls flat. Like the Nirvana room was great with mix of background and music and videos and memorabilia. But other sections didn’t live up. I didnt see everything, tho I think i only missed the Minecraft exhibit."

SeattleWA,feh3ch1,t1_fefxln6,1579108290.0,If that was true then traffic wouldn’t be as bad. There’s a marked difference between UW in session vs not.
SeattleWA,fdsl7wx,t1_fds92n2,1578704617.0,Except it’s a contractor from Texas or some shit that keeps the vast majority of the toll money. If it was the state collecting then the toll wouldn’t need to be so high.
gaming,fds4zrt,t1_fds3z1j,1578694481.0,Dual card configurations has anywhere from insignificant performance increase to maybe 1.8x. There is some overhead in the technology to manage both so you’ll never get exactly double performance but it comes down to a lot of software optimizations so for some games you might see substantial improvements but in others you might see almost none. It’s wildly across the board so a regular consumer should stick with a single card of higher tier.
SeattleWA,fdrxf7b,t1_fdritac,1578691207.0,Federal Way line under construction
todayilearned,fdlnxd1,t1_fdlhvqf,1578528326.0,Seattle has a monorail (albeit that’s more of a tourist  novelty). We also have light rail (elevated track). Vancouver has tons of light rail. Japan has lots of elevated rail. There’s probably some way to make them earthquake resistant.
todayilearned,fdldrms,t1_fdjrt0j,1578521856.0,"There’s some thought that before we truly evolved to be long distance runners who outran and tracked down our prey, that we basically did this. Figure out where the freshest kills were and then run there and scavenge as fast as possible."
SeattleWA,fdhmvnu,t1_fdg7yq5,1578426017.0,I’ve known white collar Boeing employees who’ve swapped back n forth between Everett and Renton. If you’re switching teams then they aren’t always based in the same area... would’ve driven me insane tho cause their commute went from 10 mins to over an hour.

hockey,fcykqxe,t3_ejge59,1578081790.0,Defs been frustrating considering there were a few years that Vancouver needed its depth to get results but constant injuries of key players...
Seattle,fcyhpw7,t1_fcy8r3f,1578080360.0,"I’d say people in Chicago drive like maniacs. Roads don’t even have lanes, everyone drives in the middle. People cut back and forth between lanes constantly for no benefit. Cars just stopping randomly everywhere. It’s chaos. I imagine that’s what India is like based on what people tell me."
Seattle,fcodz7h,t1_fcoaoku,1577829916.0,Or next door to the Bollywood cafe. But definitely Med Kitchen is a must eat. My pro tip is split an entree with your partner/friend or take it home since each entree is legit 2 meals or 3 if you’re a lighter eater. Btw they serve soup and bread with garlic dip so you definitely won’t go hungry. This way you can also get a baklava dessert.
AskReddit,fcl58ee,t1_fcky55w,1577740081.0,Not sure what the norm is but I’ve known families who share usage of resort properties within their extended family (so multiple nuclear families). It also provides another avenue for family get togethers. So like a house in a ski town. It probably got used most of the ski season by someone. Dunno about summers but there’s lots of options these days for short term rentals like AirBnB so you can make money during the times you aren’t using it.
SeattleWA,fckxk1r,t1_fckntcn,1577735340.0,If that’s all your drink then sure but as a casual observer (who only occasionally tries a sour as a novelty) I’ve seen more sours in our region than anywhere else. So not sure how much better it could get... at least you have options and they’re draft.
SeattleWA,fckxb7w,t1_fckwkhs,1577735191.0,I personally like Eddie Bauer performance but I still layer over those with a jacket or pullover when outside. But that’s because I’m temperature sensitive so I want to be comfortable indoors when heat is on. Can wear them hiking and then go out to and people aren’t none the wiser.
SeattleWA,fckvt4c,t3_ehnvxk,1577734274.0,Woodland Park Zoo is still fun unless it’s freezing and raining. Playgrounds & animals. Though I’ve personally never gone in rain so not sure if the animals all hide or what. I’d imagine they don’t mind the cold tho.
hockey,fckvday,t1_fcjv9sb,1577734005.0,Well the next couple weeks has them playing against teams lower in standings split half/half by teams relatively same position versus towards bottom. But the “bottom” teams are Chi and SJS whom they generally lose to... so there’s that.
hockey,fckuxoy,t1_fckk1ru,1577733733.0,A spiritual replacement to Burrows?
AdviceAnimals,fckulu6,t1_fch8k1e,1577733532.0,It’s probably more that they used years of order data to determine what the average purchase amount was and set the free shipping just a bit higher to encourage more sales. Like maybe they ran the data and found that people usually spend $21.36 average order. So they were like shit if we incentivize $25 by offering free shipping then the average order becomes $27 because you usually can’t increase your order exactly to just show $25.
AskReddit,fcktqsf,t1_fci1nn1,1577732997.0,"Real estate is generally a conservative investment, appreciates over your lifetime. Why not invest your money and get to enjoy a sweet place as well? Saves you money on lodging, parking, etc. you buy in a resort area and then you can make rental income. Definitely worth it."
AskReddit,fcktju0,t1_fcjan0d,1577732879.0,"Oh man I hate when friends or family buy us random shit. Like thanks I appreciate the sentiment but now I have this random tchotchke I’ll never use taking up space. And then I feel like an asshole taking it to Goodwill cause I probably should’ve treasured it and now it’s just become an errand to get rid of. I want less stuff, not more!"
AskReddit,fcatr8d,t3_egsztr,1577576443.0,Uni which is sea urchin. I’ve tried a few times at different places. But there’s nothing about it that I can stomach. The taste and the texture both make me want to vomit.
