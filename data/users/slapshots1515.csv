Nicole herself admitted it was more or less a PR stunt (highly effective as it turns out) and that there was no chance of winning at that pace. If you could draft an entirely different race than you, it opens up a ton of stupid scenarios. What if someone fielding a slow men’s team orders their men to drop back to allow their women’s team to draft? Or more simply pays someone off? 

The two races simply aren’t meant to interact, and the race organizers made a ruling to preserve the race as well as possible. There’s still things to be critical of, sure, but the answer is not to let things just go Wild Wild West. If there were a severe crash in the lead race, should they just allow the back race to dodge mangled bikes and cyclists just because of “unforeseen circumstances”?

No, that doesn’t mean the organizers were right; they clearly fucked something up. But sending off a women’s race behind a men’s isn’t uncommon and doesn’t usually result in this. 

If you validate this as a strategy, you open up all sorts of ridiculous loopholes and changes the race dynamics. The whole point is that if you want to ride in the lead you have to deal with the wind. If you remove the wind, everyone is going to dead sprint, which would be an entirely different type of race then."

If you CAN draft, this would be the only winning strategy. Hence why it’s dumb. Competitions have rules for a reason.

If EA found out they were being sold (which they would if there were a court case about this), they would make the cards unusable. This really isn’t that difficult to understand.

Let’s try this in a perhaps easier way. TOS agreements represent a legally binding contract (assuming they’re written validly, but we can assume pretty easily EA’s is written by a team of lawyers.) Thus, selling cards constitutes breach of contract. The law isn’t just going to let you realize perceived value off an illegal act.

I completely understand that attraction can take time to build. I’ve had numerous adult relationships, I’m engaged, I understand how it works. I’m not going into my whole sexual history but I’m well aware sex is not the only thing in a relationship. 

In this story, they DIDN’T take time. Within a few hours they went from a story in which he thought she was a teenage boy to setting up a date. All I, and several other people said, was “that’s a quick turnaround.” Going on a date implies some level of sexual attraction, in terms of the clinical sense of the term. People don’t go on “dates”, in the way the vast majority of people use that term, unless they believe they have some level of sexual compatibility.

The show goes from them struggling to kill a single minor demon to icing fifty of them every fight. 

Don’t get me wrong-I’ve watched the show pretty much since the beginning, and I think it’s great. But the whole show is power creep. Picking the leviathans specifically is a really weird point to die on (even if it is the worst season)"
tifu,fez8vi8,t1_fez7zcb,1579454929.0,"Yes, 15 minutes was an exaggeration. Even if it was a few hours, given the initial story, it’s still weird. Look, this isn’t meant to be offensive to less feminine women. They exist, people can find them attractive, and there’s nothing wrong with that. It’s what happens directly before that which makes it weird."
tifu,fez2rp4,t1_feyyw7y,1579453329.0,"That’s not what anyone is saying. This post is claiming that in a span of about 15 minutes, this guy went from being so sure that this was a 13 year old boy that he thought it was appropriate to squeeze her chest area to “wow, I’m sexually attracted to this person”. You don’t see the difference here?"
AskReddit,feys8nf,t1_feyp8zu,1579449966.0,"People are always shocked by the can/tin opener fact, but I’ve never found it that surprising. Early can openers were just variations on a knife...which is exactly what was used before to open cans. One of those “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” sort of things. The knife worked perfectly fine* so why worry?

*note-this was also in frontier times when some minor to moderate stab wounds were a little more commonplace. You knife your hand trying to open a tin can, don’t come complaining to me."

television,feypmw9,t1_feyc2oe,1579448827.0,"Supernatural did not in any way shape or form invent this. It goes way back to the early days of comics at minimum and continues all the way through TV and movies after that. Also, DBZ was before Supernatural."

AskReddit,fewgun4,t1_fewb25x,1579410362.0,"Story is too good in 1 to skip. That being said, there is a DRASTIC improvement in 2, which is among my favorite games ever."
MaddenUltimateTeam,fewemm3,t1_fev9m78,1579409315.0,Seems like a great way to get ripped apart by the run if someone picks up on that.
