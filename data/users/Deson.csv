politics,ffhckvs,t3_ethfny,1579929938.0,To be fair.  Isn't this derived from the Air Force Space Command emblem?  The Air Force Space command was started in 1982 so would predate his orangeness by a considerable time.

Normally I have a somewhat bass voice but when I'm angry it gets even deeper.

madisonwi,fdl8y23,t1_fdjth6o,1578519058.0,The worst was trees.  I jumped at shadows a bit from them.  One in particular on the down slope on that big hill you hit after you go through Springfield corners towards Sauk.  An old tree it was and cast some very scary shadows at the time.  With the expansion I imagine it was cut down.  I'll never forget that tree.

I didn't know anything about the flick other than it was Science Fiction and I had heard it was ""Good"".  I lived in Sauk City area at the time and had a moped for transportation.

The first computer I ever programmed on was an Atari 400 my Dad had.  That was in about 1978-1979 or so i think.  maybe a bit earlier.

By the way have you done any programming on an Trs-80 Coco emulator or have the desire to relive those days?  If then I have a surprise for you.  Hopefully.  Check out this playlist  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDfh7JjQaSYA1fP5KwRiOwefFIIF1Alid  This guy shows you how to setup a Coco3 emulator and he goes page by page showing you how to program.

Edit to add:
They work ok if I manually tell ships to go places but the Rally points are ignored ans ships fly on their own ignoring the stargates.  For example i sent a ship from Khaldon to Simpson manually and it worked.  When I built a ship at Simpson the rally point was Khaldon and the ships ignored the gates and headed out on their own.  As far as I can tell to seems to be something with the rally point system."

A lot of farmland would suddenly go up in mushroom clouds.  Militarized farming would be a thing for certain.  Wagons of beans coming off the fields would be weighed very, very carefully to avoid hitting ""critical mass"".
