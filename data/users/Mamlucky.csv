A foster child is still a child and in such a vulnerable place in life. Ignoring the fact that you will likely scar this innocent kid, you're insulting your mother's decision to bring in a new FAMILY member by excluding her. 

And let's say this kid doesn't stick around, so what? You will not have ""some random kid"" in the photo (your MOTHER'S photo); you will have a foster sibling who your mother treated with love and kindness in the photo. This isn't like a passing boyfriend or girlfriend; this is a child brought into the home to be provided unconditional love & support. Even if she isn't adopted, your mother will be impacted by her presence for life, therefore deserves a place in the photo."

(As a Korean, I didn't see a lot of fathers willing to openly show affection and play with their kids, so it really stood out.) 

The major difference was that the Park father could put on a cheap costume portraying an oppressed people and play make believe with his son for an afternoon; Kim was legitimately oppressed and there was no escape. Park's revulsion to the odor of a poor man was perfect on so many levels, but I feel his Native American theme party was icing on the cake.

There was one request I liked and it wasn't even smooth or turned into a relationship. A very good looking man was a regular for several months. We would chat and shoot the breeze and he eventually asked, ""So when are we going to hang out?"" Gave me his card with a smile and let me pursue him."

Team effort, my friend. Go help with groceries next time and see how expensive this shit gets. I'm a stingy person and am impressed she's feeding a family on $70."
