solarpunk,fe9eqxr,t3_eo6jt6,1578936963.0,"Obviously this is too slow to be useful for actual computing tasks, but I think the interesting implications is that it's possible for logical deliberation to emerge from such structures. What might mycellial networks already be doing with this ""intelligence""?"
getdisciplined,fe90sgv,t1_fe8k2tk,1578932937.0,"The spark of motivation and helping someone to convince themselve to do it can carry a suprisingly long way. But I can almost guarantee you that daily, committed action on something will create a meaningful shift, and if done with care and reflection, results.  


In psychology there is something called the cycle of change. Many people who consume motivational material online are in the Precontemplation, Contemplation or Preparation stages - and thus not yet ready to take action, but know in some sense that's where they want to move towards. In the Precontemplation stage change feels unnecessary, but there is a nagging doubt. That doubt should be investigated and examined, and if significant, amplified. Contemplation is the place where it's maybe worth doing, but not a strong inclination. In this stage, explore the positive and negative outcomes/futures. In Preparation, there is a desire to act, but uncertainty as to how - explore strategies.

Thus, people out here looking for that spark are actually doing what they need, but don't know exactly where to start."
getdisciplined,fe6bg8p,t1_fe6abea,1578886173.0,"So you say that you know, but you don't know? Is knowing maybe not the answer? What would the alternative look like? Try doing that, and observe how it feels. Is it possible to do without the presumption that you know it will turn out as you assume? What is necessary for it to feel like for it to be different this time?

I'm asking as questions because just telling people doesn't have the same transformational effect as helping them to find it in themselves."

It could be helpful to consider what sort of social habit you'd be willing to stick to (even when you don't want to that day) that will reinforce the positive outcomes of social interaction. You say 1:1s are good, so maybe commit to a friend date once a week?

Alternatively, you can look for alternate ways to be social. Do you play xbox with others online? If you have a headset and play games that require coordination, it could also be socially related. I have a friend who only games now if it's in the room with others, which is great. But I've even found low stress creative games like Starbound (or other construction/open world games) lead to both cooperation communications, as well as the inevitable goofing off."
NonZeroDay,fe3lzjs,t3_ennrk8,1578850545.0,"Asking to be held accountable when you don't have a reason is just external pressure, which may last for a while, but it's not gonna hold up the bridge after it's taken away.

Sounds like you need motivation even more: ""dont have any real reason"". So, what's worth doing that you want someone to help you achieve?"
getdisciplined,fdqp5tt,t1_fdq730u,1578671866.0,"People have a negative reaction to the term suffering because it sounds so dramatic. Words have not always meant the same thing, and translations of different versions have varied over time.

A much more approachable translation of the Buddhist ""suffering"" (=dukkha) is Unsatisfactoriness. I use this as an example because it's the tradition that I'm most familiar with, and places a lot of focus on suffering. 

Unsatisfactoriness basically means: There's always something better. No matter the happening, good or bad, it is easy and possible to conceive of a way it can be improved. We idealize things in symbols, and reality is complex and layered, so it can never touch these perfected representations. When we measure the difference between what is and what could be, we see it as lacking, and it creates suffering. If you look for it, everything can be unsatisfactory in this way. Anything. And we are primed instinctually to look for inadequacies in order to survive. But, you can also measure yourself from a different perspective, one of gratitude and appreciation. It is our perspective that reinforces the suffering. Sometimes that is useful, sometimes it is painful, other times it is annoying. With meditative experience you can look at the suffering as those moments of inadequacy appear and choose what to do about them without following the instinctual emotional spiral."

But! There's totally hope! You're not the only one to feel like this and still make it through, in spite of, and because of it all. Find the success stories, figure out what you already have, do what you think is right and believe it to be the truest guess of reality. And that's enough. You'll get there. Giving up will make it hurt more."
getdisciplined,fdotkt9,t3_ema2hu,1578612566.0,"It's good to push yourself sometimes, you can notice the limits of your capacity. As long as there's support from many things in your life, you can sustain this type of exhaustion for quite some tired. How can you distinguish true desire to tap out and do nothing from the lingering habitual want? What does your body and mind need to keep running, as well as to find balance, and push your edge...

What would give you the strength to keep at it? You can find it if you need to."

CollapseSupport,fdnsja0,t3_em1hmf,1578591961.0,"A moral life is to do your best and always seek to do better. The embodied energy of a system came before you and will continue regardless. Where did all of this biomass come from? Was it just due to the ending pour of sunlight energy and space mass falling to the planet? No, there was a constructive process on top of that, which has gone through a history of rises and falls. Algae were the first major biosphere collapse. Life evolves and creates feedback patterns which allows for greater complexity of resource flows. As long as you are a part of moving that forward, then you are not exploiting as much as participating. Taking more than what is fair is hard to justify, but we cannot accurately account for the outcome of our behaviour. The best we can do is to act in accordance with our highest values, to the best of our ability, and continue forward. We cannot blame the gaffs of past humans if they did not have the tools to make better decisions, but we can be committed to doing what is important and not just what is easy."
vajrayana,fdf16qk,t1_fde8eom,1578350983.0,"It seems unlikely that anyone has realized spontaneous realization from intellectual understanding alone. That's just throwing ALL of the concepts at the non-conceptual. ;)

OP would benefit greatly from putting that mental energy towards practice rather than trying to achieve philosophical 'correctness'. Though I would encourage the use of motivation from intellectual investigation as a source of energy to engage in dedicated practice. Curiousity is very useful. 

But do not assume that you ever know: flirt with uncertainty and doubt as though it were a lover, and seek to expand knowing beyond that which only represents to find a deep wisdom that trascends words."
tokipona,fdeqoc0,t3_ekk55r,1578344599.0,"You can truly consider yourself fluent in a language when you no longer find yourself translating between them, but instead can think and form ideas completely within that language. During a time of immersion learning at a summer school, we were forbidden to speak any other language, and even encouraged to dream in the language we were practicing.

Toki Pona invites us to think of language in a more raw way. Not without nuance, but without the suggested specificity of other languages with large vocabularies. All words can be only defined in relation to each other or objects/actions in the real world - representations upon representation. Toki Pona refuses to collapse these and continues to leave them exposed.

I am creating a symbolic, logical language with no spoken form (only written symbols). It's more influenced by math, symbolic logic, and blissymbolics than Toki Pona though. But I have taken to learning Toki Pona (and emojilang) in order to better understand how to convey meaning using conjugates of semantic-prime-like units of information. Toki Pona is beautiful and special because of the premises it has grown from, and how much community has formed. A language is a living thing, and I believe in the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, but it's one of those things that you can only truly understand if you have experienced it. 

My symbolic language is currently sitting at 157 words (285 if you count the flow chart schema as part of it, though it's also conceived as a separate entity that can standalone. And an unrelated universal phonetic script of 56 characters which is something else completely). I'm trying not to add too many more words/symbols and testing right now is on the grammar and what sort of other modifiers would be needed. Where Toki Pona holds positivity as a theme, my themes are in science, logic, systems design, non-duality and relational frame theory. I won't expect that it's culturally neutral, but it comes from an idealistic worldview and nerddom. One quirk that I'll mention is that it has two words for time, which is handy when it comes to writing functions and models. Anyways, it's in dev for a while yet, and doesn't really fit into the Toki Pona sub per se, so if you're interested I'd recommend that you follow me (it'll end up on one of my sites eventually)."

What will it create space for if you do solve the problem? What would the difference be between you in 5 years if you solve the problem, vs if you don't? How much would that be worth to you? You can put a dollar amount on it if it helps making it more real, but how much would it affect your happiness and day to day life? Is that worth the struggle that it will take to overcome this challenge? Focus on your motivation, and reinforce it with disciplined action. You can do it if you want to."
getdisciplined,fdb6fvv,t1_fda3pos,1578254364.0,"Yeah, I also love Workflowy and use it everyday. It's not a flow chart, but the nested trees/lists format combined with the hashtags and good search makes everything pretty easy to find.

Flow charts, concept maps and mind maps are really only necessary when you are trying to view the whole system at once - to see the relationships and look for feedback loops. The rest mentioned here in the thread are good, but if you code it's worth getting one that's XML compatible should you ever want to do some computing on it."
