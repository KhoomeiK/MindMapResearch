pics,fe2jwqg,t1_fe25q3l,1578839273.0,"> In your mind, there is nothing that people could think that would represent toxic masculinity?

Sure, I would say thoughts could constitute toxic masculinity. For example, ""I can't cry, I need to man up and stop being a little bitch"" would be internalized toxic masculinity. 

Although, stopping yourself from crying still kind of is an action technically.

I don't know about toxic femininity; I'm sure you could come up with a definition for it, but off hand I can't think of any overtly toxic actions typically associated with femininity, other than maybe verbally tearing each other down behind each other's backs or something?
