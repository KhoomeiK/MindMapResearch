northernireland,ffiwmfl,t1_ffi5xn0,1579984490.0,Oh I know I’m just pedantic.. I really appreciate when British media actually makes an effort with Taoiseach though
ShitAmericansSay,ffiwh6s,t1_ffi2sju,1579984387.0,"1. The vast majority not just many.. Saor Éire was the most inconsequential “terrorist” group that ever existed

2. At one point they did have Dublin based leadership, you’re right but that was mainly pre-split and I think the Provos may have kept it there but certainly not at the height of the Troubles, that’s not to say there wasn’t any operations run from the south- less British Army presence meant it was easier to prepare for operations front he south (obviously a lot of gun running between both sides, financing..)
But you’re forgetting the other side here.. the UVF, UDA etc

3. It still wouldn’t be the sectarian violence that you were referring to. I can’t speak for London (though I’d be pretty surprised if Londoners felt that way..) but Dublin’s sectarian tensions are and have always been vastly lower than they were Belfast. Of course there is some level of sectarianism (and racism, intolerance etc) but no higher than every other country in the world."
ShitAmericansSay,ffi25sx,t1_ffi1eb6,1579962863.0,"Not at all, I’m pretty well-versed in Irish history myself actually. If you had actually read what you sent you may have noticed that the bombings etc came from northern sectarian terrorists (UVF and the IRA that operated primarily from the north). They also attacked London but that doesn’t mean that London is a place of sectarian violence as you tried to claim Dublin was."
northernireland,ffi1pg6,t3_etpt48,1579962455.0,Dáil is not pronounced Doyle.. mostly Dawl or maaaybe Dawyl in some accents
ShitAmericansSay,ffi1be1,t1_ffgu7p4,1579962096.0,Did you even read what you sent??
AmITheAngel,fekdi50,t3_epjwxs,1579197767.0,I know throwaway account names often look similar but... anyone else notice how it’s the exact same format as the ones who posted the whole AITA for being happy my bully died/is dying
insaneparents,feewvo3,t1_feekxhs,1579042965.0,Sometimes the eldest children also get that treatment!
trashy,fe5vf8m,t1_fe5uyke,1578875823.0,All personal info had been edited out.  There was literally no way tell who it could be.  We only know who it was because she posted about it herself and tried to get some sympathy going for her on youtube.
trashy,fe5uyco,t1_fe5scc4,1578875531.0,They didn't expose her name originally
trashy,fe5uv7k,t1_fe5t5es,1578875474.0,He never exposed her.. she did that herself
trashy,fe5uj0d,t1_fe489b2,1578875253.0,"Have a look at the White Moose Cafes video, it shows exactly what shes offering (basically nothing)and exactly why he's calling her out in this ridiculous, selfish entitlement"
trashy,fe5u9m6,t1_fe4c9ou,1578875079.0,"She wasn't publicly shamed.. her name was blurred and no clues about her identity were given in the owners original ( Instagram or youtube, cant remember) post

She exposed herself in a video talking about how upset she was that he called her out on asking for free stuff"
trashy,fe5u1aw,t1_fe3soxy,1578874928.0,More like some weak reading comprehension skills from you
todayilearned,fe172va,t1_fe0wtcq,1578823282.0,Oh definitely.. No Irish person would refer to Irish as a race
Nicegirls,fcsnrfc,t3_eijxlq,1577920600.0,Hmm.. still grieving the loss of wife OP?
AmITheAngel,fcmw7pp,t1_fcj84fp,1577795092.0,"No not at all he’s absolutely not an asshole for telling her. She deserves to know the truth. And the worst person in the entire story is her mother.

However, this is still the girl he raised as a daughter for 3 years and then left when he found out she wasn’t biologically his (btw also not AH for this obviously). If I were in her shoes I would understand and forgive (I think) but I would still be devastated and feeling abandoned. 
It’s very mature of her to apologise but as the adult in that situation he should have told her she had nothing to apologise for, how could she have known otherwise. This kid now has no parental figure to turn to. It was too easy for him to wash his hands clean of this whole situation then and absolve himself of any guilt by going to AITA for validation. He’s an asshole for how he handled the whole situation, he may have absolutely no feeling (either of love or resentment) towards this child but he basically just ripped her entire world up in that short conversation, she apologised and as far as we know he left it at that. It just baffles me that someone could be so uncaring towards someone else."
HumansBeingBros,fcllwvn,t1_fcli2qw,1577750860.0,"Is this also true if the accuser is a minor though? 

I honestly don’t know much about these cases but I always assumed children wouldn’t be obligated to go and face the defendants"
facepalm,fcju22r,t1_fcjrmo6,1577704728.0,"I can only speak for Ireland but almost everyone learns a third language (outside of English and Irish) from 12/13-14/15 and most would continue it until the end of their schooling, but the standards of teaching foreign languages and the will to actually learn them for yourself (rather than just to get into college) is so poor that many dint end up with a second or third language.

This is also a problem with Irish. The syllabus is so pointless that some kids leaving primary school (so 6-8 years of learning Irish) can barely string a sentence together)"
facepalm,fcdxlnn,t1_fcch917,1577614816.0,"Seriously? Mc (or Mac) is a ridiculously common prefix in a surname.. 
Also no one has ever thought of Supermacs a ripoff or in any way a related to McDonald on account of their food actually being decent."
facepalm,fcdvx0n,t1_fcdtpft,1577614345.0,"You are the first person i have come across who thinks that 

Fast food-wise Supermacs is the better chain"
AmITheAngel,fc6tb8a,t3_egf2bt,1577488950.0,"He refers to the girl he raised as “her daughter”, and actually said that this kid (13) had the “maturity” to apologise to him?? For what exactly?

Disgusting that he is treating a completely innocent child like this.."
northernireland,fc6r2aw,t3_efzjbh,1577487310.0,"Seems like a lovely subreddit..

Shocking to be downvoted for speaking of your own experiences"
MapPorn,fc5cry6,t3_eg8fap,1577453555.0,I know it’s a joke but seeing Ireland labelled as part of England..
trashy,fc43mqv,t1_fc3yobl,1577405768.0,C. As do men. What's your point?
