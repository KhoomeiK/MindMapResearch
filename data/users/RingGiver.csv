Problem solved.

Edit:

Enough people are mining in Null with Rorquals that the stuff that you can mine in High-Sec isn't going to be that significant. If you want to make ISK while mining, you don't really have many options other than going to Null. And going to Null is as simple as going through a relatively simple application process either on the alliance website (basically just asking for information to check if you're a low-effort spy or not) or in-game (for Pandemic Horde) due to the fact that big Null alliances are based around trying to get as many people as possible mining and ratting. There are diamond rats in Null, but there will be enough people keeping an eye out that they aren't going to cause too much problem.

Rorquals are overpowered enough that no other ship is worth mining ore with unless you're on one of the really good moons (and Pandemic Horde restricts the best moons to subcaps only so most people are in Procurers).

Aside from that, the type of mining that's really good is wormhole gas mining, but that's an entirely separate matter."

Joining a Null alliance (one of the big ones makes things easiest) is the standard way to make safe, substantial income. I'm in the Pandemic Horde alliance right now (not particularly impressive, but of all the Null alliances, it's probably the best for new players and a pretty good place for somewhat experienced ones such as myself) and I joined for that reason: previous small wormhole corp went inactive (and wormhole corps need a higher activity level than any other area of space in order to survive at all), so I wanted the stability of a major alliance where I wouldn't have to worry that I might lose all of my stuff just because a couple of people didn't feel like logging in anymore and while the money in wormholes is great, the sort of upkeep and preparation work required to make that money is enough that most people can make more in Null.

To put into perspective, the kind of combat site that I run when I need money but don't feel like taking the effort to do anything else and my alliance's moon schedule doesn't have anything really good coming up is around 35 million in bounties. A fairly inexpensive ship like a Gila can run it in a bit over 40 minutes. That's the least profitable thing that I do to earn ISK."

It hasn't amounted to anything really big now (although INIT. might be running low on faction battleships).

Pandemic Legion is nowhere near what it used to be. Hedliner pretty much just runs a SIG in Northern Coalition. now. Pandemic Horde is now the strongest alliance in the coalition and is running things more than the other two, though NCPL still has more experienced FCs overall and probably more capital ships in raw numbers. PanFam still has a substantial rental empire of Brothers of Tangra, Beanstalk, HKASS, and a few others, but it doesn't have the same benefit that it used to (the reason why PL has fallen upon hard times). Botting is a thing that happens with the renters just like all other rental space.

Biggest political events going on right now relate to how the Chinese alliances are aligning themselves. For the most part, they take roughly the same stances toward each other that they did on the Chinese server. Fraternity was the first to take a definite allegiance: fair-weather friends of PanFam (though the alliance leader has a habit of breaking every agreement that he makes) because PanFam helped them out fighting TEST for a bit. Army of Mango was TEST-aligned, but one of their big names became the head of Ranger Regiment (the biggest bot farm in the game relative to number of members, though FRT does a substantial amount more ratting overall with more than 2.5 times as many characters). PanFam and TEST are fighting Ranger Regiment, Goons are backing RR up. Newer arrivals include PanFam-aligned Veni Vidi Vici and Stars of Northern Moon, there's also a Goon corp People's Liberation Army."
