But not every cop is trigger happy."

relationship_advice,feiy99q,t3_epbkpf,1579150576.0,">Are any of these abusive? Am I being controlling and manipulative? She says I'm trying to control her which is abuse.

No, no, and no.

She is in denial and is manipulating *you* so you can continue to do the things that are in *her* favor.  

She knows she has an issue with her weight and has kyboshed all your efforts to help her.    Her reactions alone tell you.

I don't know if this is even a thing, but if there is a way you can do an intervention, I would look into it.  If she has an unhealthy food addiction, it's not for the love of food in an of itself, it's because of depression.  

You need to get to the root of the depression issue in order for her to start acknowledging that she has a *life threatening* weight issue.  

Would you consider opening up an account and start putting your paycheques in another account and tell her that from here on in, she doesn't get a say in what groceries are brought home until she addresses her weight issue?

Stop buying the junk.  Stop buying any of it.  Sit her down and lay it all down on the line and put your foot down for the health of your wife. Tell her you love her, and you are concerned for her and enabling her by allowing junk food to be eaten in the house 24-7 by her is something that you will not tolerate any longer.   Tell her how it's making you feel as a husband who is desperate to help his wife.  

I'm not sure if she will see the light after you say all these things to her.

OR, you can skip the sugar coating and simply tell her that if she doesn't start changing her eating habits and if she doesn't start aiming to strive for a healthier lifestyle and address the real reasons why she resorts to food, then simply put, she is going to die, and if she chooses not to do anything, she will die sooner than she would like. It's inevitable due to her health."
askTO,fei4sn0,t1_fehuptm,1579130282.0,">If you can drop $250 on your hair you can afford to give a bigger tip.

That sounds just like when someone says ""if you can afford $2000 in rent you might as well buy a house and have a mortgage payment for that much"" - not the same meaning, but it SOUNDS the same.  

No. If someone pays $250 for a haircut/color/blowout it does NOT mean they can afford a tip of over $15.  

If the OP can afford to tip $10-$15 then that's a fair tip.  Anything beyond that is a *generous* tip."
toronto,fehrsfj,t3_ep22ng,1579122595.0,"My friends brother committed suicide because he was in so much pain from TN.  He had it for roughly 3 years before the medication just stopped working.  Pain management was slim to none, and whatever they did give him only took the edge off, and that was a difference between bearing the pain enough to want to live, and not being able to withstand the pain and wanting to die.

Had 1 surgery that didn't do much for him.

Ironically, the medication they gave him before he died was the same medication I take to control my epileptic seizures.  Tegretol.

He used to tell me that the pain was so bad that he wishes he could ""just die"".  I thought it was just him exaggerating.    It happened when he would least expect it.

I would hate to have pain like that."
dogs,fehpzvr,t3_ep5jpm,1579121565.0,"Reading all of this sounds off the bells loud and clear 

Emily is suffering and from what it seems like, it sounds miserable :( it sounds tiring, and it sounds painful and uncomfortable to live the way she's living. Her quality of life is basically zero 

So it's time. It's time for you to do the most selfless act of love you have ever done for her, and that's  to hold her hand, kiss her gently, and let her go to the rainbow bridge.   

She will wait for you there I can assure you that.  

I'm so sorry for your pain.  But in all reality, better your pain than hers, as hard of a pill as that is to swallow.  

Wishing you healing and courage during this time."
