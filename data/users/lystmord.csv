ColorBlind,ffejlq1,t1_ffd7l6t,1579850701.0,">Well, bruh, tell me exactly what “severe” meant when I said it

One would presume you meant ""severe."" Usually, when people say ""severe,"" they mean ""severe.""

In which case, the simulation would be represented by something like [this image](http://chroma-glass.ucsd.edu/assets/img/DifferentSpectrum.png). On the ""protanomaly"" scale:

- reds are brownish
- greens are lime, trending toward yellow (""if I’m shown a yellow that looks green"")
- purples are really bluish (""Sometimes I can’t tell if a purple is blue or if a blue is purple."")
- magenta does indeed exist, but it's pretty desaturated (which might explain you confusing pink and grey, idk)

So I don't really have to tell YOU what you see. You told US what you see. Your own verbal description seems pretty congruent with what was described to you, despite you taking great offense. Maybe your description is not understandable to us in some way, but that's the limitations of language, innit? It may well be that you see a significant difference between that scale and the normal color one at the top, though. In which case, maybe the simulation is flawed, maybe you are less severely colorblind than you were told as a child, etc. etc., many reasons.  I don't see why you'd get wound up either way, though.

Sure, our eyeballs are all individual and even if we had the same measurable type of color vision, your blue might still not be my blue, etc., etc., philosophizing bullshit about perspective, yippee, you're an ~individual~, a unique star in the sky that science can't quantify, go take a toke or whatever."

No, I'm telling you how *you're* coming off: weirdly combative, starting with arguing against things he didn't even say in the first place.

>and how wrong he was about what I see. 

Your own descriptions mostly back him up, actually."
ColorBlind,ffcs0ij,t1_ffb32k0,1579806064.0,">Blue and yellow are two distinct colors to me.

That's what they said, why did that warrant arguing? If you show a person with normal color vision a R/G CVD filter of any kind, the first thing they're probably going to say is, ""wow, everything is blue and yellow."" That doesn't in any way suggest those two colors *aren't* distinct.

>There is no such thing as a yellow lime.

Unrelated to the color argument, but this is actually incorrect. For many varieties, yellow limes are the ripest. You generally won't see them in a grocery store because limes ship better unripe (like bananas, I guess), so they're alway picked and shipped green. You'd probably only get a chance to eat yellow limes if you live in a citrus-growing area.

Over time, this has resulted in people widely believing limes are *supposed* to be green and no other color. We pretty much all eat limes unripe and think that's the proper lime flavour.

> Purple looks purple. Sometimes I can’t tell if a purple is blue or if a blue is purple.

[...]

>I don’t even know what magenta is.

How do you get from ""blue and purple are easy to confuse"" and ""I don't know what magenta is"" to ""purple looks purple""? Only the reddest red-violets and the bluest blue-violets are going to be confused as ""red"" and ""blue"" by most people, and those are edge cases. Maybe you can indeed see some purples, but it wasn't crazy of the above poster to say simulations suggest you'd have a lot of trouble with that color. It sounds like you do.

>Sometimes the grayish pinks look gray. 

Again, it's a serious edge case for most people that a pink would ever be confused with grey. It would have to be deeply desaturated.

The above poster is going off what simulations look like. That is indeed going to be flawed to apply to every person, since the simulations can only ever show one level of severity at a time, and the simulation may still not be exact even for the level of severity it's attempting to show. But you're trying to make it sound almost like you have no problems distinguishing any color, even when your own descriptions don't remotely match how someone with normal color vision would describe it. It's honestly bizarre."

ColorBlind,ff3u8aa,t3_eq521r,1579548961.0,"Tea fan here. Green tea varies a LOT, but it is generally closer to yellow than green. Sometimes I think green teas have a greenish cast (especially if the liquor is paler), others are more of a honey color. High-quality matcha will be the farthest to the ""green"" side of the spectrum, as it is a bright green. (That's a key sign of quality, actually - poorer-quality matcha leans more yellow and dull. ""Green tea"" latte and smoothie-type drinks are usually based on matcha.)

""White"" tea is usually a pale straw color.

""Black"" tea is generally more of a reddish color (deep dark honey yellow for the lightest varieties), and is actually called ""red tea"" in China. (""Black"" tea in China is a fermented type of tea also called ""pu'er,"" not what we call ""black tea"" in the West.)

Oolong varies the most, as the way it is processed can result in its properties being more like a green tea or more like a black tea.

aww,fd3k9pv,t1_fd3awda,1578159063.0,"Man, you don’t get to make that goofy skating analogy above and comment on my logic.

I’m actually relatively certain that the data finds most people between 75 and 83 to be illiterate, but I didn’t want to overstate because it’s not in front of me right now. For now, I’m saying it’s a completely reasonable hypothesis that someone too slow to be trained to perform menial labour adequately also probably cannot read. And the number of illiterate adults in the US is simply way too high for there not to be multiple explanations beyond “Timmy comes from abject poverty and had to work instead of going to school.”

It is also primarily genetic. I’m not going to engage that further, because it’s an exhausting debate I’ve had far too many times with people are essentially zealots in the false belief that IQ is meaningless. If you want to know more, I suggest starting with Stuart Ritchie’s “IQ: All That Matters” as a layman’s intro to the research.

I don’t personally know anyone who had their parents teach them to read. I learned in school. I think that’s a pretty normal experience."

The cutoff to be classified as mentally disabled is 75, if I’m not mistaken. But studies find that 83 is the real cutoff point below which people struggle with basic functionality - like being capable of gainful employment. There’s a large number of Americans below 83. It’s not unreasonable to say most of them are probably functionally illiterate.
