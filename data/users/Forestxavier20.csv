pokemongo,ffans22,t3_esfp0j,1579740287.0,"A simple guide on why Ryhorn automatically wins.

Everybody wants it to win because of the stone. It is the only one there that requires an evolutionary stone and due to previous events we know that they will give out a free set of stone to evolve just in case. If they were not to do that it would ruffle so many feathers. So most people are going to be voting for the stones and not for what they really want as the shiny or meta

Edit: Stop using Ralts community day as your example, it is getting repetitive. You are using a single piece of evidence that has a clear cut reason for not giving out Sinnoh Stones. Ralts has Gardevoir, a Candy based evolution, with no stones required. The Swinub event, who requires a Sinnoh Stone to fully evolve, gave out Sinnoh Stones to evolve your mons."
pokemongo,ffanjqw,t1_ffa8gwq,1579740132.0,"Exactly, so this is going to cause the vote to be extremely unbalanced. Everyone’s going to be voting for the free stones rather than trying to get the free shiny. Nobody cares about a shiny if they can evolve multiple Pokémon due to the event.
