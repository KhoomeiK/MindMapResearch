This is completely false. What is your source on this?"
AskReddit,ffgali2,t3_etgoup,1579902034.0,"For me it took years of grieving, introspection, and self-acceptance. It's still traumatic to think about, but I've come to terms with it. 

You really have to listen to your own needs and let yourself feel your emotions and let them take their course. Sympathetic family and friends can be really great (if they're not full of empty platitudes), but if they're just a toxic influence it may set you back.

You don't ever really get over trauma, you just make room for it as it becomes a part of you. Just
don't lose sight of your self in the process. If it doesn't take over your life, you'll be a stronger person for it."

DaysGone,ffctjt4,t1_ffcmrlu,1579806967.0,"It's pretty great. The game is 90% story and 10% gameplay, but don't let that dissuade you. It *is* essentially a point and click game, which in theory sounds boring, but you really get drawn into the story and in making decisions that have far-reaching consequences. I'm a fan, and I commonly play *only* fully-interactive games.
I think the first episode is available as a demo, so I recommend that to see if you like it."

DaysGone,ff5hqhf,t1_fey2beb,1579593408.0,"Idk, maybe you were expecting a different kind of game. I didn't find ammo scarcity or gas depletion (you can upgrade the tank, btw) to be contrary to survival game criteria. Looting is slow, but if you're looking for realism, I consider that very realistic.

The swipe menu controls *are* awkward. I kept accidentally swiping them while playing, so I turned them off. The whole menu system is poorly designed. I can't remember what shortcut buttons go to certain menus other than R1 and triangle, but those are the only menus I care about.

The game definitely has its flaws (I could write a whole post about them) but I'm enjoying the game regardless."
