And the fact he got uncomfortable at the mention of your very valid reasoning for not wearing what he wants is just childish. Like, what did he expect? He asked, and you gave him an answer. I really feel you should think about if you're willing to stay with this guy. He doesn't sound like he's healthy to be with, especially when you're bisexual and he seems to have issues with being gay himself.

This guy is a total creep, and it's gross he's pushing his kinky shit onto you. I'm kinky myself, and I would instablock this guy. You are absolutely justified in blocking him.

We have different things to talk about that a lot of parents either don't understand or they judge their kids for it. Many parents grew up in a time where they were not allowed to express as much, and therefore they push that into their kids, who then are able to turn to the internet for comfort and understanding. Communication then falls apart between parent and child. I think it will get better as generations become more understanding of new things and stuff like mental health."

As someone who also loves their hair and wants control over it (ironically by shaving it all off lol), you are the only one who can decide if you want to shave your hair. It's okay to be proud of it and keep it as it is. As someone mentioned in another comment, a donation will go a long way. You're not a bad person for not joining in on this, and it's disturbing how upset your coworkers are over it. Don't let anyone guilt you into changing how you look just because they want you to.

BDSMcommunity,feb5ih0,t3_eo96wf,1578955632.0,"So, throughout my serious dating life, I did BDSM with the two first I had, and I'd always like to try and Dom them for fun. However, it was never an actual session with it, it was just me being put back in my place, and they didn't like subbing (which is totally fair, I would never force them). I enjoyed it like that, but it always felt like there was something missing in the dynamic and I never knew what it was until I met my boyfriend now. We messed around a lot during the beginning of the relationship, and we both came to find he liked subbing, and would only do it with me.

You will teach your son nothing but self hatred and resentment towards you and God. You should be like Jesus Himself and accept your son for who he is and love him, not abandon him.

I'm a very emotional person and spent the majority of my life being yelled at for one reason or another. I would assume you got yelled at prior to any of the other punishments, so you associate it with being in trouble and it immediately triggers your panic response, which is to cry because it's upsetting for you. Even if you know its not anything like that, your brain associates the familiar thing with the familiar response.

\>Whenever someone even slightly raises their voice at me I start balling my eyes out. I feel...betrayed almost. Like, it hurts my feelings when people get mad at me.

insaneparents,fdf08i9,t1_fdewv0y,1578350385.0,"So, I see what you're saying. However, it is unfair for a parent to say they won't get mad and then get mad anyway. It's manipulative and, as I said, toxic. It causes your child to just lie more because they can't trust you. I do absolutely agree its situational, though. But I also think that you should control your emotions if you're a parent. You want to set a good example to your children and allow them to come to you if something happens. You don't want to be too soft, obviously, but not explode at them when you say you won't. 

Insane by definition is just repeating the same action over and over again, expecting a different result. So, you're not incorrect in saying that it it's not what's happening here. But, we do use the word for other things, such as this kind of behavior from parents. We call it insane because it's absurd to be so manipulative to your own kids.
