A much more likely cause is incompetence as the survey base is at extreme risk of response bias. 

The study that the linked article is referring to began tracking women a week after already having had the abortion, so women who severely regret their decision already at that point are much less likely to respond to the survey on a regular basis years after than those who don’t regret it."

The study that the linked article is referring to began tracking women a week after already having had the abortion, so women who severely regret their decision already at that point are much less likely to respond to the survey on a regular basis years after than those who don’t regret it.

memes,ffe08b1,t1_ffdzuxs,1579833342.0,"Yeah I’ve never understood this claim very much. My high school publishes their salary payouts and teachers start at $40k without a masters or $60k with a masters and the 30+ year vets make between $100-120k. 

While this does include their healthcare and other insurances, it’s still nice pay considering they have guaranteed weekends, holidays, and an entire summer off. 

Overall I’d say that *some* teachers are underpaid while others are certainly overpaid.

I’ll add that my dad has been a 5th grade teacher since 1986, has a masters and makes about $110k."
