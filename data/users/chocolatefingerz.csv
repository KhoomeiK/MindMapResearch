“I’m Hobbes”, came the response. A gentle, loving voice, unmistakably human yet coming from the fuzzy smile of the giant tiger-sequel figure. 

“Hobbes... like Calvin’s toy, Hobbes?” There was something about even the question that seemed ridiculous, like asking if Santa Claus delivered to every child in the world. 

“Well, I prefer *friend*. I have feelings, you know?” Said the tiger. Even the thought of “said the tiger” felt hilariously childish. 

“I’m seeing things. I need to go see doctor Erin-“

“No doctors. You’re not seeing things. I’m here for a reason.” Hobbes interrupted, reaching his paws out to calm things down. 

“What reason is that?” Snapped Calvin’s father, suddenly feeling very faint and a bit dizzy. Was the ground spinning? Or just his head?

“Well, Calvin got it much quicker, though I suppose he was also a bit younger and more open to new ideas.  You remember that time you convinced him the sun was the size of a quarter? That was priceless— he told everyone at school and no one questioned it!” Hobbes gave a hearty laugh at this, then wiped his eyes of a tear that had formed from his wincing. 

“Sure. I remember that... so you said you’re here for a reason...” Calvin’s father replied. 

“Yes, I told you, I’m here to be a friend.” Hobbes responded, matter of factly. 

“A friend to whom? To Calvin?” Calvin’s dad asked. In his confusion he felt a strange desire to hug Hobbes. 

“No, to you.” Said Hobbes 

“To *me*?”

“Yes... do you remember when you first gave me to Calvin, what you said?” Asked Hobbes, who continued without waiting for a response, “you said— he’s here to be your best friend— and he’ll be here no matter what happens, whenever you need him, even through the worst lightning storms and the scariest days.”

“I remember that.”

“Well... perhaps I can be your friend today.” Hobbes said, gently putting a paw on the shoulder of the father. A father who’s shoulders couldn’t stop trembling. Shaking violently from grief and disbelief. 

“But Cal.... Calvin...” Calvin’s father began to heave. Anger, desperation, and tremendous sadness tore through him. 

“i know buddy, I know.” Hobbes whispered, knowing how difficult it can be to face to reality. Thunderstorms are scary no matter how grown up you are. 

“He’s sleeping. He’s just sleeping right now. Let’s not wake him. It’s snowing out, he loves the snow.” The father’s words were choking out in violence now. 

“That’s right, buddy. It’s okay. Let’s just wait for him to wake up, shall we? Maybe we all go sledding together when he does.” Hobbes words sounded so comforting and safe. He truly is a great friend. The best friend a person could have. 

Calvin’s father wrapped his arms around Hobbes, sobbing deep, guttural cries into the stuffed toy’s chest. This was no simple toy. It was the last thing that gave his son joy right before that god forsaken sled crashed. At least Calvin wasn’t alone, he thought. At least he had Hobbes. 

“It’s okay,” he could hear Hobbes say, as if he’s truly alive, “don’t worry...I’ll always be there for him.”"

Entrepreneur,fdsf925,t3_emuaa9,1578701393.0,"Immediate red flags:

1.	If their marketing is very vague terminology: “6-figure business” or “7-figure business” is absolutely meaningless because they usually mean revenue. They also don’t mention time frame— there was a guy on here recently talking about how his affiliate course made a million dollars. In the AMA he revealed he’s been running it over 10 years, and his take is around 50%. That’s $50,000 net/year BEFORE his own expenses. 
2.	“Made a million dollars by 27” type marketing falls under the same description As above. When I hang out at eCom and T&C type events, I can't tell you how many ""millionaires"" I met who were deep in debt, or selling a lifestyle while they're barely scraping by. 
3.	if their marketing is mostly things like flashy cars or other status symbols but not REAL change. It costs $200 to rent a Lamborghini for a day for photo shoots. It costs $300 to rent a mansion on AirBnb for a photo shoot. Hell, you can BUY a Ferrari or Aston Martin that’s ~10 years old for about the cost of a new Honda and in the pictures it looks the same. 
4.	“X dollars in one day” marketing, even with photos = launch day sales. You made ""$20,000 a day!!!"" ... on launch, but $5 the week beforehand, and $10,000 went to your affiliate partners... so you make $3300 a month. Congrats.
5.	“Secrets”, “Hacks”, “Formulas”, “Blueprints”, are all marketing terms that have no meaning, and they’re deliberately metaphorical. Also, secrets are suspicious. If it’s a million dollar secret then why are they telling you? Why not use it to make millions? 
4.	Anything selling a shortcut. If they can make a million on amazon working 5 hours a week, they wouldn’t be working so hard selfing you this course. 
5.	You can say you spent “$0 on ads” but still have spent thousands on affiliates. Entire industries are built around affiliate marketing. 
5.	Social proof is almost meaningless. You can buy Instagram followers, YouTube subscribers, Facebook likes, reviews, testimonials, etc. Forbes contributor, “As Seen On”, etc are all easily acquired. Hell, you can buy a blue checkmark on Facebook/instagram for $5,000. 
6.	I auto exit any course pitch that has a countdown clock. Without thinking. If they felt they needed to add artificial scarcity it usually means their course isn’t good enough to withstand critical thought. 
7.	I auto exit any course pitch that doesn’t have a legitimate money back guarantee. I always read the fine print, sometimes the money back guarantee is hilariously bullshit, like asking you to prove that you’ve tested out every single technique in their course, which you literally can’t do. I recently bought a $99 “mindfulness” course that required you to “prove that you didn’t achieve mindfulness” to get the money back. Fucking scammers. 
8.	any video where the guy is doing something “weird” as a way to catch your attention raises a fuckton of red flags. Your product should speak for itself.
9.	Most “passive income” marketing is bullshit. Launches are feast and famine businesses, where you work your ass off without sleep, food, or seeing another human for 8 months to hit a launch, and then take 4 months off because you are generating artificial scarcity. They then take a lot of photos in Bali (which is dirt cheap to live in) to use the rest of the year. The only true passive income is investments, I haven’t met a single successful business owner who doesn’t work at all... unless they’re okay with their business not growing. 


The ONLY thing you can trust: Content. Go through the person’s blogs. Go through the person’s videos. Go through the person’s podcasts. See if you like the free stuff and the delivery. There are tons of REAL experts, and they’re usually so filled with good, ACTIONABLE info they’re constantly spilling it in their content. They want you to win from the free stuff.

You might as well ask how do some *people* get so wealthy. 

A few other things-- you can get really nice cars second hand for a fraction of the cost. You can get a 2012-2015 Lambo for about $150k, that's like $2500 a month on a payment plan or just $30k a year. By no means out of reach. 

People way overestimate what lifestyle icons cost."

I recall this was what happened in France where they lowered the retirement age, and then seniors would go to another country and continue to work, thereby cashing their pension plus a full time job, and the societal health benefits wouldn’t kick in."
