ìIím Hobbesî, came the response. A gentle, loving voice, unmistakably human yet coming from the fuzzy smile of the giant tiger-sequel figure. 

ìHobbes... like Calvinís toy, Hobbes?î There was something about even the question that seemed ridiculous, like asking if Santa Claus delivered to every child in the world. 

ìWell, I prefer *friend*. I have feelings, you know?î Said the tiger. Even the thought of ìsaid the tigerî felt hilariously childish. 

ìIím seeing things. I need to go see doctor Erin-ì

ìNo doctors. Youíre not seeing things. Iím here for a reason.î Hobbes interrupted, reaching his paws out to calm things down. 

ìWhat reason is that?î Snapped Calvinís father, suddenly feeling very faint and a bit dizzy. Was the ground spinning? Or just his head?

ìWell, Calvin got it much quicker, though I suppose he was also a bit younger and more open to new ideas.  You remember that time you convinced him the sun was the size of a quarter? That was pricelessó he told everyone at school and no one questioned it!î Hobbes gave a hearty laugh at this, then wiped his eyes of a tear that had formed from his wincing. 

ìSure. I remember that... so you said youíre here for a reason...î Calvinís father replied. 

ìYes, I told you, Iím here to be a friend.î Hobbes responded, matter of factly. 

ìA friend to whom? To Calvin?î Calvinís dad asked. In his confusion he felt a strange desire to hug Hobbes. 

ìNo, to you.î Said Hobbes 

ìTo *me*?î

ìYes... do you remember when you first gave me to Calvin, what you said?î Asked Hobbes, who continued without waiting for a response, ìyou saidó heís here to be your best friendó and heíll be here no matter what happens, whenever you need him, even through the worst lightning storms and the scariest days.î

ìI remember that.î

ìWell... perhaps I can be your friend today.î Hobbes said, gently putting a paw on the shoulder of the father. A father whoís shoulders couldnít stop trembling. Shaking violently from grief and disbelief. 

ìBut Cal.... Calvin...î Calvinís father began to heave. Anger, desperation, and tremendous sadness tore through him. 

ìi know buddy, I know.î Hobbes whispered, knowing how difficult it can be to face to reality. Thunderstorms are scary no matter how grown up you are. 

ìHeís sleeping. Heís just sleeping right now. Letís not wake him. Itís snowing out, he loves the snow.î The fatherís words were choking out in violence now. 

ìThatís right, buddy. Itís okay. Letís just wait for him to wake up, shall we? Maybe we all go sledding together when he does.î Hobbes words sounded so comforting and safe. He truly is a great friend. The best friend a person could have. 

Calvinís father wrapped his arms around Hobbes, sobbing deep, guttural cries into the stuffed toyís chest. This was no simple toy. It was the last thing that gave his son joy right before that god forsaken sled crashed. At least Calvin wasnít alone, he thought. At least he had Hobbes.

Entrepreneur,fdsf925,t3_emuaa9,1578701393.0,"Immediate red flags:

1.	If their marketing is very vague terminology: ì6-figure businessî or ì7-figure businessî is absolutely meaningless because they usually mean revenue. They also donít mention time frameó there was a guy on here recently talking about how his affiliate course made a million dollars. In the AMA he revealed heís been running it over 10 years, and his take is around 50%. Thatís $50,000 net/year BEFORE his own expenses. 
2.	ìMade a million dollars by 27î type marketing falls under the same description As above. When I hang out at eCom and T&C type events, I can't tell you how many ""millionaires"" I met who were deep in debt, or selling a lifestyle while they're barely scraping by. 
3.	if their marketing is mostly things like flashy cars or other status symbols but not REAL change. It costs $200 to rent a Lamborghini for a day for photo shoots. It costs $300 to rent a mansion on AirBnb for a photo shoot. Hell, you can BUY a Ferrari or Aston Martin thatís ~10 years old for about the cost of a new Honda and in the pictures it looks the same. 
4.	ìX dollars in one dayî marketing, even with photos = launch day sales. You made ""$20,000 a day!!!"" ... on launch, but $5 the week beforehand, and $10,000 went to your affiliate partners... so you make $3300 a month. Congrats.
5.	ìSecretsî, ìHacksî, ìFormulasî, ìBlueprintsî, are all marketing terms that have no meaning, and theyíre deliberately metaphorical. Also, secrets are suspicious. If itís a million dollar secret then why are they telling you? Why not use it to make millions? 
4.	Anything selling a shortcut. If they can make a million on amazon working 5 hours a week, they wouldnít be working so hard selfing you this course. 
5.	You can say you spent ì$0 on adsî but still have spent thousands on affiliates. Entire industries are built around affiliate marketing. 
5.	Social proof is almost meaningless. You can buy Instagram followers, YouTube subscribers, Facebook likes, reviews, testimonials, etc. Forbes contributor, ìAs Seen Onî, etc are all easily acquired. Hell, you can buy a blue checkmark on Facebook/instagram for $5,000. 
6.	I auto exit any course pitch that has a countdown clock. Without thinking. If they felt they needed to add artificial scarcity it usually means their course isnít good enough to withstand critical thought. 
7.	I auto exit any course pitch that doesnít have a legitimate money back guarantee. I always read the fine print, sometimes the money back guarantee is hilariously bullshit, like asking you to prove that youíve tested out every single technique in their course, which you literally canít do. I recently bought a $99 ìmindfulnessî course that required you to ìprove that you didnít achieve mindfulnessî to get the money back. Fucking scammers. 
8.	any video where the guy is doing something ìweirdî as a way to catch your attention raises a fuckton of red flags. Your product should speak for itself.
9.	Most ìpassive incomeî marketing is bullshit. Launches are feast and famine businesses, where you work your ass off without sleep, food, or seeing another human for 8 months to hit a launch, and then take 4 months off because you are generating artificial scarcity. They then take a lot of photos in Bali (which is dirt cheap to live in) to use the rest of the year. The only true passive income is investments, I havenít met a single successful business owner who doesnít work at all... unless theyíre okay with their business not growing. 


The ONLY thing you can trust: Content. Go through the personís blogs. Go through the personís videos. Go through the personís podcasts. See if you like the free stuff and the delivery. There are tons of REAL experts, and theyíre usually so filled with good, ACTIONABLE info theyíre constantly spilling it in their content. They want you to win from the free stuff.

‚ÄúWhat reason is that?‚Äù Snapped Calvin‚Äôs father, suddenly feeling very faint and a bit dizzy. Was the ground spinning? Or just his head?

‚ÄúWell, Calvin got it much quicker, though I suppose he was also a bit younger and more open to new ideas.  You remember that time you convinced him the sun was the size of a quarter?

‚ÄúSure. I remember that... so you said you‚Äôre here for a reason...‚Äù Calvin‚Äôs father replied.

‚ÄúA friend to whom? To Calvin?‚Äù Calvin‚Äôs dad asked. In his confusion he felt a strange desire to hug Hobbes. 

‚ÄúNo, to you.‚Äù Said Hobbes 

‚ÄúTo *me*?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes... do you remember when you first gave me to Calvin, what you said?‚Äù Asked Hobbes, who continued without waiting for a response, ‚Äúyou said‚Äî he‚Äôs here to be your best friend‚Äî and he‚Äôll be here no matter what happens, whenever you need him, even through the worst lightning storms and the scariest days.‚Äù

‚ÄúI remember that.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut Cal.... Calvin...‚Äù Calvin‚Äôs father began to heave. Anger, desperation, and tremendous sadness tore through him.

1.	If their marketing is very vague terminology: ‚Äú6-figure business‚Äù or ‚Äú7-figure business‚Äù is absolutely meaningless because they usually mean revenue. They also don‚Äôt mention time frame‚Äî there was a guy on here recently talking about how his affiliate course made a million dollars. In the AMA he revealed he‚Äôs been running it over 10 years, and his take is around 50%. That‚Äôs $50,000 net/year BEFORE his own expenses. 
2.	‚ÄúMade a million dollars by 27‚Äù type marketing falls under the same description As above. When I hang out at eCom and T&C type events, I can't tell you how many ""millionaires"" I met who were deep in debt, or selling a lifestyle while they're barely scraping by. 
3.	if their marketing is mostly things like flashy cars or other status symbols but not REAL change. It costs $200 to rent a Lamborghini for a day for photo shoots. It costs $300 to rent a mansion on AirBnb for a photo shoot. Hell, you can BUY a Ferrari or Aston Martin that‚Äôs ~10 years old for about the cost of a new Honda and in the pictures it looks the same. 
4.	‚ÄúX dollars in one day‚Äù marketing, even with photos = launch day sales. You made ""$20,000 a day!!!"" ... on launch, but $5 the week beforehand, and $10,000 went to your affiliate partners... so you make $3300 a month. Congrats.
5.	‚ÄúSecrets‚Äù, ‚ÄúHacks‚Äù, ‚ÄúFormulas‚Äù, ‚ÄúBlueprints‚Äù, are all marketing terms that have no meaning, and they‚Äôre deliberately metaphorical. Also, secrets are suspicious. If it‚Äôs a million dollar secret then why are they telling you? Why not use it to make millions? 
4.	Anything selling a shortcut. If they can make a million on amazon working 5 hours a week, they wouldn‚Äôt be working so hard selfing you this course. 
5.	You can say you spent ‚Äú$0 on ads‚Äù but still have spent thousands on affiliates. Entire industries are built around affiliate marketing. 
5.	Social proof is almost meaningless. You can buy Instagram followers, YouTube subscribers, Facebook likes, reviews, testimonials, etc. Forbes contributor, ‚ÄúAs Seen On‚Äù, etc are all easily acquired. Hell, you can buy a blue checkmark on Facebook/instagram for $5,000. 
6.	I auto exit any course pitch that has a countdown clock. Without thinking. If they felt they needed to add artificial scarcity it usually means their course isn‚Äôt good enough to withstand critical thought. 
7.	I auto exit any course pitch that doesn‚Äôt have a legitimate money back guarantee. I always read the fine print, sometimes the money back guarantee is hilariously bullshit, like asking you to prove that you‚Äôve tested out every single technique in their course, which you literally can‚Äôt do. I recently bought a $99 ‚Äúmindfulness‚Äù course that required you to ‚Äúprove that you didn‚Äôt achieve mindfulness‚Äù to get the money back. Fucking scammers. 
8.	any video where the guy is doing something ‚Äúweird‚Äù as a way to catch your attention raises a fuckton of red flags. Your product should speak for itself.
9.	Most ‚Äúpassive income‚Äù marketing is bullshit. Launches are feast and famine businesses, where you work your ass off without sleep, food, or seeing another human for 8 months to hit a launch, and then take 4 months off because you are generating artificial scarcity. They then take a lot of photos in Bali (which is dirt cheap to live in) to use the rest of the year. The only true passive income is investments, I haven‚Äôt met a single successful business owner who doesn‚Äôt work at all... unless they‚Äôre okay with their business not growing. 


The ONLY thing you can trust: Content. Go through the person‚Äôs blogs. Go through the person‚Äôs videos. Go through the person‚Äôs podcasts. See if you like the free stuff and the delivery. There are tons of REAL experts, and they‚Äôre usually so filled with good, ACTIONABLE info they‚Äôre constantly spilling it in their content. They want you to win from the free stuff. 

If you research a ‚Äúguru‚Äù and find that all there is marketing, there is 10000% nothing behind the curtain."

news,fdlyc5x,t1_fdlo5gn,1578535420.0,"Having been in a number of consultations (not at facebook but at a few Fortune 500 and one fortune 100), the legal department is often engaged to do a ‚Äúworst case scenario‚Äù for almost all major deals in the risk assessment stage.

Even if a couple started smoking or causing overheating to melt, it'll be settled with a few hundred dollars and an apology letter.

If 1/10,000 devices for Apple malfunctions, or even worse, 1/100,000 devices so much as causes a spark, overheats, or melts, it will be the biggest news in tech since the Samsung Explosion Note."

You might as well ask how do some *people* get so wealthy. 

A few other things-- you can get really nice cars second hand for a fraction of the cost. You can get a 2012-2015 Lambo for about $150k, that's like $2500 a month on a payment plan or just $30k a year. By no means out of reach.
