We believe that everything people do should be for the good of society as a whole, and that many individual freedoms that seem harmless can actually harm other people, and it is wrong for one person's pleasure to harm someone else.

Lib-right exists as well, basically they believe money is the ultimate form of value and that if someone has money, it proves that they are a good and moral person and deserve more than most. (But unlike auth-right they don't believe those with money deserve to have control over those who don't, not quite sure how they intend to accomplish this)"
