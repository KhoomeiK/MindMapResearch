Elizabeth was born and is formally a ""windsor"", because of her father king George V.

The only part that's somewhat manufactured about it is the fact that the house name was Saxe-Coburg-Gotha and king george changed it to Windsor around WW1 because of the whole german...ordeal. 

Then from that time until in the 1960s when Elizabeth married lieutenant Philip Mountbatten (obviously a functional last name), she took on Windsor-Mountbatten and as has the lineage, so whether anyone believes the Windsor part is a sham, obviously Philip's lineage isn't, and that's the real reason some, like Harry's son can take it as part of their real formal full name, while others go without last names but descriptive headers of positions, areas, etc."

Showerthoughts,fej5uj1,t1_feiz1hz,1579158109.0,"You do realize that's not what they mean when talking about public restrooms right?

You're helping people pretend that one thing is better where they are, or people falling for it being worse where they are.

Also the US absolutely has paid public restrooms, it is just overall different variations.

You have optional paid restrooms in Munich, Amsterdam, etc.

But there's a difference, they're separate with locked off entry in certain malls and stations, they have different measures of cleanliness, seat covers or in amsterdam automatic swaps and cleanliness with actual clerks providing services.

But you still have public restrooms too and you can just go to regular stores, bars, or even department stores, like bijenkorf in Amsterdam.

I'm a germaphobe and like the options for comfort, so I map out these things whenever I am in Germany, the Netherlands, the UK, etc.

You have outdoors free toilets I'll never use, public free restrooms, decent things like the bijenkorf restrooms, and the example I gave of the paid restrooms sectioned off and serviced in certain malls, where I'm more than willing to pay 50 cents for the amenities and to comfortably sit down for a number 2 if I have to.

I would absolutely hate not having that option for when it's needed while being in a big city filled with residents and tourists going in and out.

Now in every smaller city in those countries I know for a fact that because there's a lower influx of people, which makes it hard to service restrooms and keep things organized, you can just hop into most stores, restaurants, or whatever and use their bathroom for free, I've done so in all the countries I mentioned and more.

Even you know there's a difference between smaller cities and places like hamburg, munich, berlin, etc.

It's very similar in the UK, Germany, Netherlands AND the US, the main difference comes from city size and even then it's options, like the Amsterdam example.

I even remember one time it was late, the mall with the serviced restrooms was closed, I didnt want to go to a worse free restroom, so I literally went to a police station and they didn't mind, also the restroom of a hotel lobby on another occasion.

It's not free everywhere and where it isn't, the options are just different, the people arguing or discussing are people bringing halfway information to the table and then saying others have it better or worse.

It's not some dignified owning of a mistake, although it's something else people like this often don't do, looking at the longterm, even in this case they're using that for further delusions.

Since usually they think short-term and ruin the longterm while still pretending it's others' fault, never conceding and keeping the cycle going.

In this case they thought this would good bring good results short-term and longterm, but now that the former is proving to be impossible, they're trying to push through for the second part of the delusion that'll never come like this.

I just beg the people that might eventually save the longterm to rub it in their faces, otherwise they'll pretend it was because of them, try to retain power and repeat this type of shit, being the cause of problems while going ""I told you so"" too."

Had to stop reading there, trump is a dumbass, but this is some pedantic pretentious garbage, unbearing to even read as your position from that self-appointed high horse seeps through your vocabulary. 

Trump thinks he's better than others while being too stupid to have anything to prove it with, you do your best to come across that way as if constantly trying to position yourself.

Like trying to prove yourself through insecurity, instead of just being comfortable and letting your merit speak for itself, ironically while calling others insecure.

Reading your comments is like watching someone consistently adjust their dick, not for comfort or to hide a bulge, but to make sure it stays on display.

You write like a woman adjusting her pushup bra."
Damnthatsinteresting,feeud2o,t1_fee77b8,1579041404.0,"Best medical treatments in the world is provably false, even if you look at plastic surgery, places like Korea have that beat.

Not only does the US rank at around #33 for healthcare in the world.

But deluded people that have only traveled to a few places pretend that at least the private sector in the US is the best, but even taking healthcare out of the equation the US still ranks outside of the top 10 for treatments, surgeries and so on.

There's a reason even people with money don't fly to the US for surgeries and just go elsewhere.

There are options that people take for cheap good surgeries and top notch expensive care, and none of those international destinations lead to the US, people would be flocking without you having to advertise it if it was reality, as they do to other countries.

You're the only one feeling security and assurance to the supposed best country when it comes to everything, that says all you need to know, you wouldn't have to advertise it to outsiders and people would still flock due to the actual merit.

But somehow the only influx you got are immigrants from third world countries only wanting to basically escape war and death, but no novelty cases like surgeries or better healthcare, and even though you keep selling it, nobody buys it, why? Because the product isn't as good as you tell yourself it is.

Your words wouldn't be needed to convince people if it was true, not in this day and age."
Damnthatsinteresting,feetgbw,t1_fee3og5,1579040845.0,"I guess that's part of the difference with europe, a lot of Americans try to project and say others are ignorant, bigoted or haven't experienced variation to be able to compare things.

But the US has Mexico below it for comparison, and canada above it, which both still get used as examples with one as bad and one as good, even if nationalists won't let up on canada having most things mapped out better.

But if in europe you for example live in Belgium or the Netherlands, you can experience those countries, and no matter where you live in those countries, by car, train or plane and even for less than 50 bucks (one way unless great budgeting, but possible with deals) at times able to go to surrounding places like germany, france, the UK and so on.

And a lot of Europeans have experience with or traveled to other countries even further, but the amount that crosses their borders or the ocean to the UK is immense, so you experience and learn about a lot.

It almost becomes like US states, but as individual countries and ironically the percentage of people traveling many states is less than Europeans in certain countries crossing their border, for example the Dutch/Belgian/German examples I gave, you'll barely be able to find older people that have never went across those borders from any of those countries, and then you can include the easy and cheap ship to the UK from the netherlands, or overall planes, trains, car routes, etc.

It's not even a money or middleclass+ thing, those would be the ones easily goung on vacation each year from anywhere in europe to the warmer Mediterranean or further"
Damnthatsinteresting,fees77g,t1_fee60qo,1579040081.0,"Oh sweet sweet irony.

The same ones against better healthcare and talking about America being the best compared to other countries, having republican arguments including fallacies about having to pay more taxes for better healthcare and comparing it all to communism and not in line with the ""land of the free"", are also like trump the ones fully for tariffs, like they unloaded on iran.

And things like tariffs and domestic price hikes for medicine in the ""free market"" (like the Martin Shkreli scenario) are part of the reason Americans don't have free access to what they need in the land of the free.

Oh the sweet nectar of irony and karma"
Damnthatsinteresting,feer753,t1_feepj8e,1579039474.0,"They think they're doing their part in being able to achieve the dream.

It's as simple as thinking that if the pot was more even, it's basically all communism and nobody can become succesful, be a billionaire or achieve the foundation of their delusion, the American dream propaganda, which really is just the global standard.

So they're willing to believe it's necessary for a big gap between poor and wealthy with no ""handouts"", just for what they feel like could be the chance to make it themselves, even if in most cases that choice is watching others and themselves die unfulfilled.

It's about collectively being individuals putting everything into lottery tickets.

Even though collectively they could uplift each other to keep climbing and still have outliers, billionaires or whatever they fantasize about, but just by uplifting everyone as a whole, so the baseline grows alongside all other higher levels.

Instead they fell for the lies that  you need to bottom out even more to be able to have the top, even if it means eventually both extremes eroding each other anyway."
Damnthatsinteresting,feeqgr8,t1_feen0xy,1579039045.0,"Propaganda is the defense line, it's easier for people to get told that they're in the best country, than to make them believe it through actions.

You can mention people getting murdered and shot as much as in a third world country, die because of preventable health issues like third world countries, and people will be indoctrinated enough to go ""b-but we have freedom, we live in the land of the free, best country in the world, everyone else is poor"".

It's all about the American dream propaganda, the idea that you could have it all be worth it since because of the fake freedom and exploitative version of capitalism everyone could become the next bill gates, as if it's that easy and there's no other strings attached, or as if you can't do so in other countries.

But for that perceived idea that the gap from bottom to top has to be big for the potential of achieving the dream for themselves, they're virtually all willing to pay for that lottery ticket with a life of pretending and emptying their pockets, minds and souls regardless, if there was even any to give a chance to win that lottery.

Ironically everyone would be better off if it wasn't undermining others regardless, but most are willing to live garbage lives under the notion that at least if others get nothing too, they might just win the lottery themselves."

Eventually his stream died out with how stupid he is and the amount of time he has fucked up and done fucked up things.

But the origin stories are fairly normal, regular gaming streamer living with parents, played a game called runescape in which if you type, the first letter gets capitalized automatically, so naturally reverse smileys became a thing, since as someone else mentioned, if you typed xD it would turn into Xd, so him and his first viewers started using Cx.

Eventually he became more famous, everything became less innocuous, he was too dumb yet malicious to handle the fame and money, even moved to LA from Florida for some dumb ideas with IRL live streaming, now he gets like 500 viewers on fucking mixer of all platforms."
