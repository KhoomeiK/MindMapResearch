depression,fetxv6q,t3_eqm12f,1579381120.0,"Well, I think you should take it easy. Talking of women as 'targets' seems a little odd to me (not trying to be mean, just my thoughts).

Asking her out for different activities sounds good to me. Don't worry if she really is way more talkative than you, maybe it is even nice because she might just start a new topic during your conversations without you struggling to find one.

Anyway, good luck with it! :)"
depression,fet1a6r,t1_festyo6,1579370891.0,"I don't think they said it to hurt me but because they were overwhelmed. One of them called me later and cried but I guess she just doesn't really see how that makes me feel even worse..
Wishing you the best, too!"
depression,feqhz4h,t3_eqcju4,1579342114.0,"I told my two closest friends what's going on with me (depressed, suicidal thoughts etc). Their only reaction is to talk back to me like 'eh don't say that, you don't have it THAT bad' and then making me feel guilty because they say things like 'think about us, you're making us sad'.. Well yes thanks I guess? As if it wasn't hard enough already.."
depression,fdobchg,t3_eme2p4,1578602112.0,"It is totally normal for you to feel that way. It is not easy to see your mother like that. You have to keep in mind that you are not responsible for her and even if she is having a hard time right now, you need to focus on yourself. I can't really give you a specific advice, just take it easy on yourself.

Maybe just structure your day. You could spend some time with her, maybe do something together even if it's just watching TV so she sees that you are there for her. This could relieve you from your own sadness and the bad thoughts you have. And after you've spent some time, you could go on studying, maybe checking up on her every now and then but making sure the main focus are your studies.

Anyway, good luck!"
depression,fdo87xj,t1_fdnfnte,1578600587.0,"Thank you for your input!


(I had to delete my answers because I didn't really feel comfy with all that personal stuff here, still hard for me to talk about it even if it's just a stranger. But rly, thank you!)"
depression,fdnffib,t3_emb44a,1578584659.0,"Even tho you said you didn't want any comments I'll say something anyway.

If you were an asshole, you wouldn't want to help your ex or even cry for her. I understand that it is exhausting and that you've been strong for too long to the point where you think you can't take it anymore. But truth is: you can. Give yourself a break.

I know it's hard but sometimes you can't help people with their depression no matter how much you want it. But at this point, you should take care of yourself first and let her be for a while even if it hurts you. You are worthy of the same effort you're trying to give her."
