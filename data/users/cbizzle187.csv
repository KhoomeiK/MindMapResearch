A lot of trash is actually worth money so they process the materials with monetary value so they effectively recycle everything. It's really only municipal trash collection that goes straight to the landfill. For example, everything collected by Waste Management goes to their processing and is sorted before the remainder is taken to landfill."

Random facts. Wasabi is quite rare. Most of what is called wasabi is actually horseradish made to look like wasabi. In 2014 the vast majority of the wasabi crops were destroyed and there was very little real wasabi globally. Wasabi is widely known as the most difficult to grow commercial crop. As an American you likely have never had real wasabi."

PoliticalHumor,fd42921,t3_ejy4wc,1578163692.0,Why is it everywhere the US tries to start a war there is tons of opium? Vietnam was the top producer of opium in the world at the time of the Vietnam War. Afghanistan was the largest producer of opium when we invaded after a bunch of Saudi Arabians flew planes into buildings. Iran produces a large amount of opium. North Korea also produces opium. Not a coincidence.

funny,fcw7vts,t1_fcw5z6n,1578019167.0,"I never mention a strike. Protesting is much different. Often you will see a protest outside a construction site that have signs that say ""Shame on such and such company"" this is a protest hosted by the union because a contractor hired non-union work for their project (I work in utility construction so I see it often). Not sure how this comment is so misunderstood. Union members are too valuable to stand and protest. This is not an anti-union comment. I'm pro-union."

funny,fcvtw8s,t1_fcvqb4w,1578010002.0,Not a shitty statement at all. Unions represent skilled people that perform incredibly crucial jobs. Why would a union make skilled people waste their time by standing in protest. Especially if there is work to be done. Don't get your panties in a bunch. It makes perfect sense to use laborers for these protests and not skilled union members. Don't be so sensitive.
MadeMeSmile,fcvt3a2,t1_fcvq3zs,1578009484.0,Downtown New York was obviously eliminated. Roads near beaches are never that wide. Land that close to the ocean isn't wasted with wide paved roads so that option was also eliminated. There go your two examples.

AnimalsBeingBros,fcvpyqd,t1_fcvpple,1578007470.0,Yea and all you did was say they were wrong. OP provided much more info and you tried to call them out with nothing other than a dickhead comment. You're still the asshole.

Just like the people unions hire to protest the hiring of non-union workers. Those are day laborers not actual union members."
AnimalsBeingBros,fcvo5pk,t1_fcvn4pm,1578006326.0,"And again you're an asshole trying to prove someone else wrong with no facts. Why is it overblown? What is the science/research behind your dickhead responses? The OP makes a case for their opinion and you just say they're wrong with no information. If you want to make a point make it. If you want to call someone out for being a false ""cat whisperer"" with no credentials then be prepared to be called a dickhead."

PoliticalHumor,fcv8cka,t1_fcuwxhs,1577996756.0,"Term limits is a terrible idea. Imagine Putin and Xi versus a green, inexperienced Congress. Term limits is not the answer. Educated voters is the answer. Education in America should be our number 1 priority. Educated people make better decisions.

Also, when you have a dedicated public servant that is great at their job why would you want to limit that person's career and effectiveness? Term limits for a president makes sense because it is one person with tremendous power. A single Congressional member has nowhere near that power. They are simply one of 535. Congressional term limits is a terrible idea.

Another example. 2016 exit polls showed voters wanted the government run like a business. What business has term limits? If a company is hiring a CEO they are not even going to interview the candidate with no experience. Limiting the experience level of Congress is an absolutely idiotic policy."
PoliticalHumor,fcv3eg3,t1_fcuxxuk,1577993827.0,"Why does humor mean laughter? The definition of humor does not include the term laughter. Humor - the quality of being amusing or comic, especially as expressed in literature or speech.

Why do you insinuate they are linked? Humor does not equal laughter. I find many things amusing that do not make me break out into laughter. Still fits the definition of humor. Look up the definition before you start an argument."
