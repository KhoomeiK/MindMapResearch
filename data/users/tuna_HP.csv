I don't like many of the specific policy legacies of her husband's administration, such as financial deregulation that has lead to the financial industry consuming a greater share of GDP, outrageous copyright extensions, and disastrously-failed trade deals with China. And I have never heard Hillary distance herself from these policies. 
2. I don't like how the Clintons were willing and able to so lucratively monetize their political offices in public appearance fees and donations to their foundations. I am tired of hearing that these politicians aren't impacted by money like this, and much more tired still of people arguing that these corporations and dictators pay this money because Bill or Hillary puts on such a good show. Their 30 minute speech and Q&A was totally worth the $1M public speaking fee plus round trip private jet air travel. Hey rubes, for $1 million your could hire Bruce Springsteen or Adele to play your corporate conference, with enough money left over to hire Kevin Hart and The Rock both to take pictures and sign autographs during the set break. There is no universe where the Clintons make so much money so fast except one where political value involved. 
3. I didn't like her speaking style. Her campaign tone was so much different than the tone she took on Howard Stern. All these mo's on /r/hillaryclinton have been trying to say that the Howard Stern Hillary was the real Hillary all along, but that is delusional- on the campaign stump she sounded exactly like a *Doctor Who* Dalek! Which is an evil alien robot that speaks in a monotone of progressively increasing volume and pitch... I swear it is exactly like hillary clinton reading through a stump speech. It was just really uncharismatic.
4. I didn't like choosing her as a nominee because of the Bill baggage. Some of it is the policy stuff above, some of it the fact that there is a widely-accepted-as-credible accusation of violent forceful rape against him, and some of it doesn't have anything to do with Bill or Hillary themselves, it is just that the American people are indoctrinated from birth to be suspicious of the idea of political dynasties, and why the hell was the Democratic Party so arrogant as to try to compete in an election with that self-imposed handicap."
JoeRogan,ffaoap9,t1_ff6fsvo,1579740636.0,"Firstly, I don't think that many Jews oppose ""White"", European or American countries right to ""live there in peace"", that's a pretty nonsensical statement.

Secondly, there is the matter of distinction of different countries having different levels of ethnic vs civic nationalism. France and the USA for example are explicitly civic nations as declared in their founding documents. In contrast, Israel was explicitly created as a ""homeland of last resort"" for refugee or discriminated Jews. The founding documents outline that all people are to be treated equally regardless of background, but that the state primarily exists to be a place where Jews from anywhere in the world can be assured that they will be treated equally in front of the law and practice their religion without discrimination.

Thirdly, there is of course the matter that Jews live all around the world and they want to be treated equally in their home countries too. They don't all want to move to Israel. Jews were living in Iberia and France since before Christianity was invented. Jews were immigrated to the Americas since the 1500s'. Of course Jews will feel the need to oppose anything that excludes them from the central identity of those countries. Any way you judge it, Jews are as ""American"" as any other group. They were here as early as anyone else and have made their fair share of national contributions, political, cultural, academic, commercial, financial, military, and otherwise.

Fun fact: the first and only Attorney General of the Confederate States of America was Jewish. He fled to the UK and lived out the rest of his life as a prominent and prosperous lawyer."

They defined a generation of ""Third Way"" that married moderate social liberalism with fairly extreme economic liberalism (to use the word correctly). Repealing Glass-Steagall, signing trade deals with zero respect for the interests of the workers effected, very strict welfare reform, zero measures to reduce healthcare pricing exploitation, zero measures to address conflicts of interest and tax loopholes in private equity and hedge funds... to me it is hard to differentiate the economic policy agenda of the Bill Clinton administration from any recent Republican.

It is not Gabbard's lawsuit that was the original injury against the public's right to know the truth, it was Clinton's cynical, knowingly false attack. Clinton was not ""simply stating her honestly held opinion"", she was getting revenge at Gabbard for her principled stand for free and open Democratic primaries in 2016. Clinton is in a position to know more than the public about whether Gabbard had any real ties to Russia. She would have had access to that information as Secretary of State and her husband receives access to that information continuously as a former president. Clinton exploited her public platform, her authority as a former holder of high office, and her access to secret intelligence to slander Gabbard baselessly, and it is disgusting.

What option does Gabbard have to correct the public record other than to ask a court of law to force Clinton to admit that she has no special information or intelligence that suggests that Gabbard is a foreign asset? To force Clinton to admit that she was just ""talking shit""?"

AskALiberal,ff6o7bg,t1_ff6lqvx,1579631389.0,"You're still not understanding me. *I said* that it was wealthiest that are benefitting at the expense of the middle class.

I am saying that rather than calling the ""moderate white"" racists, they should be engaging them in a black-white alliance against the oligarchy.

Obviously Obamacare was not a race-based initiative you dolt but it has always been analyzed partly in racial terms since it more beneficial to the average black citizen, who is more likely to now have insurance where he didn't at all before, and more likely to be detrimental to the average white citizen, who often already had insurance and now just has drastically higher premiums and deductibles. Democrats often questioned the motivations of anti-Obamacare Republicans in racial terms. This is not something I invented this was the mainstream discourse around Obamacare.

But I am saying- we all know that the *real* problem with healthcare is that we are being bent over the barrel on costs. Similarly wealthy countries spend 40%-50% per capita on healthcare compared to the US. Why are we calling Republicans middle class people racist because they don't want to spend even more on healthcare when instead we should be allying with them to take down the healthcare oligopolies? Healthcare is a perfect example, for the amount that the oligarchy is fucking out of America above what any other countries pay, we could easily have provided Obamacare-scale coverage and *lowered* everyones prices!"
AskALiberal,ff65a6x,t1_ff58r5y,1579619467.0,">You’re assuming that anyway we address it will automatically come at the expense of middle class white people, which is a very big leap to make.

No I was trying to say that it has historically. The Great Migration of African Americans northwards with zero federal assistance lead eventually to the collapse of northern cities. Obamacare lead to skyrocketing healthcare costs for middle class families. Integrated school districts with no additional outside funding have historically lead to lower school district performance.

What I was trying to say is that we should prioritize the interests of the middle class whites as well, alongside the blacks, so that they don't see each other as rivalrous. Obamacare should have been funded on the back of healthcare cost reductions to international norms, rather than premium increases on the middle class. The Great Migration should have been accompanied by a massive wealth extraction from the South to pay for services for the former slaves they imported that were now moving North. The federal government should contribute more money for the education of poor people, such that a district taking an additional poor child isn't making a sacrifice, they are getting all the funding they need to pay for it. We let the people that benefit the most from our economy off with no costs, we let the people that actually imported and enslaved the african americans off with no costs, we put all the costs on marginal white families, and then when they question how it will impact their quality of life, we call them not only racists, but to use the language people are in this thread, we are calling them ""worse than the people who would rather re-enslave the african-americans""."
AskALiberal,ff6419h,t3_erncrl,1579618590.0,"Eh I think sports fans are a good example:

There are the people who watch *Sportscenter*, and they may watch it religiously multiple times a day, but that is all they are consuming about sports, or maybe some more very surface-level, shallow, marketing-first content from broadcast sports shows and mainstream sports magazines. They may be spending a massive share of their time consuming sports content, but  the sports content they are consuming is intellectually worthless. *Sportscenter* is 50% a commercial for ESPN/Disney's sports broadcast licenses, 30% a commercial for other Disney properties, 30% ""funny"" quips amongst the hosts for mindless laughs, and -10% insightful sports analysis. 

 But then there are also the rabid, obsessive, *intelligent* sports fans who are digging way below the surface. They are reading specialist coverage from people that are dedicated full time to analyzing one single team in one single sport, and they are doing so for multiple teams in a single sport to get a full sense of the competitive field. They are going back to read about and watch historical games that happened before they were born just to get a better context for the history of the sport. They are reading high school scouting reports to get a sense of the up and coming talent and how that will impact the value of draft positions. They are following athletes on social media just to try to glean their mindsets and how that will impact their performance.

IMO that first group of people, amongst whom I have many friends and family, are just participating in a circus. It is a mindless exercise in popular entertainment. It is intellectually bankrupt. The second group, the super nerds, they are actually doing something intellectually worthwhile. They are analyzing sports at a deep enough level to actually be able to derive new insights.

And yes I see many parallels amongst people who talk about politics. You have the people that may watch MSNBC or Fox News (but definitely not both), and who might read some NYT or WaPo. And then you have the people who are reading in depth analysis and listening to podcasts that dive into specifics on individual districts and states. You have the people that read both NYT and WSJ, both Salon and Breitbart, so that they get a sense of what all sides of the political spectrum.  You have the people who read the NYT article and then go find the actual referenced academic study to see if its conclusions are what the NYT implied they were. You have the people who see the policy debate and don't think first to to hear more perspective from talking heads and political hacks, but instead dive right into the fundamental scientific or engineering topics that will actually dictate the best approach to a social challenge. 

And yes, the people who are just watching the surface-level, marketing-first, mindless content from the biggest sources, they are pretty worthless as far as political analysts. They have no opinions other than what was fed to them by some NYT or Fox News hack."
AskALiberal,ff4ay72,t3_eriood,1579559386.0,"Relevant to our current political climate, I believe that there are many people on the left that need to be more careful about where they cast their aspersions if we want to expand our voter base. We can't just blame all social ills on a generic ""wypipo"" with all sorts of lazy and prejudicial stereotypes about your typical ""ignorant white"". The people who feel attacked by that language are less likely to vote for Democrats. You know, kinda like how we all expect black voters react when they are called ""dangerous predators"" or ""welfare queens"".

The reality of MLK's ""white moderates"", and the reality of many of today's white swing voters is that they are not the ""socioeconomic elite"". Yes, the socioeconomic elite are overwhelmingly white, but less than 1% of whites are in that socioeconomic elite. The majority of these white people are just middle class people trying to provide for their families. They want safe neighborhoods and good schools for their kids and good healthcare for their parents. So even if they are a couple ""rungs of the economic ladder"" above the average black citizen, they are not so rich that they are completely isolated from the impacts of government policy. And back during the MLK era the same as today, many of the policies that Democrats propose to provide better services for blacks do so at the expense of the services for those ""moderate whites"".

For example, if you bus poorer students into a school district, now you have additional students, that each require more individual attention and resources than the average wealthier student, with zero extra funding. If you eliminate residential zoning (which is something I am greatly in favor of) you make it possible for lower income households to move into that neighborhood, which means a lower average contribution to local tax rolls per resident. They guaranteed poorer people healthcare through Obamacare (which of course I agree with) but they did so primarily on the backs of younger people and middle class people through skyrocketing premiums, and relatively little did they finance through the additional income tax for the wealthy.

So we're talking primarily about northern, white, middle class people, who are not related to anyone who owned slaves, and often didn't even immigrate to the US until after the slavery era, and whose wealth has been under attack for decades by hostile public policy that accrues more and more money for the uber-wealthy, and then we ask them to underwrite the entire costs of some new racial justice program. They aren't the ones that brought the slaves to the US. They aren't the ones who profited from the slaves. And yet they are being asked to bear the costs and Democrats are calling them racists when they have any questions about it."
chicago,ff3g2eu,t1_ff37ol8,1579540314.0,"Allowing coach houses is itself a zoning issue. That is all the same thing. The way I would break down the housing issue is,

1. There are lots of people who would be able to afford market-priced housing if market prices weren't being artificially inflated by zoning and other supply restrictions. There are lots of households that would be made substantially better off by reduced housing costs allowing them to spend more money elsewhere.
2. There are lots of people who are simply too poor to afford housing even if we address the supply restrictions. The cost in materials and labor to build a house is simply more than they can afford.

To the extent that we need to be doing multiple things with housing, I see eliminating the capacity restrictions to bring down the market price of housing as one thing, and providing subsidies or public housing as the other thing, for people who are simply too poor to afford housing even if we completely eliminate all zoning."

ukpolitics,ff3airx,t1_ff2q4cp,1579537424.0,"Relative expense of building this public transportation infrastructure in the UK compared to Germany/France/Japan definitely tells of some inherent flaws in UK practices, but it also reveals flaws in the practices of those other countries.

The reason things are so relatively expensive in the UK is because UK people have stronger property rights and more deference is given to the interests of each individual. In the UK, a community will complain that the train makes too much noise too close to their residents, and that will lead to enough political pressure to re-route the train or tunnel it, which adds massively to the cost of the project and possibly makes the project worse and less viable overall since now the train has a longer travel time that isn't as competitive against road and air as it would have been. In contrast, in Japanese culture they don't give a shit if the train noises rupture the eardrums of nearby residents, 'that is a sacrifice every good Japanese makes for the common cause'. There are pros and cons. We train nerds can fantasize about High Speed Rail routes running everywhere but there is no denying that it would have an extremely disruptive impact on the existing developments. The rail lines take up lots of room and are very loud.

And then there is the matter of whether high speed rail routes are worthwhile to begin with. The profitability of HSR in France and Germany for example is a contentious subject. Advocates say that the HSR lines run an operating profit, while detractors say that they can only do so because of state subsidies towards track maintenance and towards running the local non-HSR rail lines that feed passengers to the HSR lines. The operating costs for High Speed Rail are surprisingly high. Per available seat mile, the train might be slightly cheaper to operate over a typical HSR distance, but then the airplane is probably filled to 97% capacity whereas the train might only have 60% of the seats filled, so operating costs per actual passenger is often higher for the train in the real world. In any case, *nobody* argues that any HSR line in Germany or France is profitable after accounting for capital costs. The tens and hundreds of billions of euro spent to build those lines initially is just written off.

So what is the alternative? Right now, today, at very little cost and using off-the-shelf technology, the UK could eliminate all road congestion between London and Leeds. Just implement a dynamic congestion charge using GPS monitoring to take enough vehicles off the road to eliminate congestion at all times. That means that a nice comfortable bus should be able to make it from London to Leeds in about 3.25 hours regardless of the time of day. That's slower than HSR, but you have reduced the upfront capital investment by about £106bn. Also, since each bus seats fewer passengers, they can leave direct from numerous London neighborhoods and drop off their passengers at numerous Leeds neighborhoods without requiring passengers to make transfers at central train stations or bus depots. In the longer term, as airplane powerplants become more electrified, there is an opening for new commercial airplane designs that could take off from much shorter runways and operate short routes much more efficiently than current airplanes and more efficiently even than high speed rail."

If only we could put a tax on vast fortunes and intergenerational wealth. The problem is that the tax is too easy to avoid, and the unintended consequences is that economic savings are moved somewhere else, away from investments in US-based businesses and to investments held elsewhere outside the purview of a US wealth tax.

My preferred way of attacking wealth accumulation and intergenerational wealth is to attack the rules of our economy that allowed that wealth to accumulate in the first place. Our economy has been consolidating into fewer and fewer massive companies with continuously less competition and continuously higher profit margins. This is not the inevitable end of market economies. This is the predictable result of the rules we hold in place. We could just as easily not issue patents on pharmaceuticals without ensuring that the public interest is served first and foremost. We could just as easily not have issued Comcast the public rights of way to build their internet lines all across public and private property without ensuring that the interests of consumers were being served first and foremost. We could just as easily block mergers and acquisitions when the various stakeholders aren't all being prioritized as they should be.

Bill Gates suggested, for example, that software (and maybe other types of intellectual property) should be treated as individuals for income tax purposes.

Unfortunately there isn't a good alternative. This is a ""strategic situation"", a scenario where economics *game theory* applies.

They face no consequences for attacking the interests of the poor people, so why not? If instead rural Republican voters felt that their interests would be acutely damaged by Democratic leadership, and that Democrats leading at the federal level would ""wreck their shit"", then they would be much more inclined to negotiate on constructive compromises with the Democrats, and much less inclined to act so adversarially against them when they are in power.

Those attributes might be how the land handles water, or its soil nutrients, or its suitability towards supporting large heavy buildings, or other attributes that will impact how conducive that land is to various types of improvements. For this reason alone, it would be suboptimal to implement a 100% LVT as was George's proposal. You need to allow people to still have the incentive to maintain and improve the physical land value. With an 100% LVT, people essentially pay no price if they destroy those highly valuable physical land attributes.

What is the benefit of boosting the property tax base when you also have to increase government spending by an even greater amount in order to hire enough teachers exclusively from within the city?

> Reduces the number of cars on the expressway during rush hour, thus reducing congestion and emissions.

Why should *the children* pay the cost of reduced congestion and emissions in the form of receiving worse teachers and degrading their academic prospects? Why should the city be paying the cost of reducing congestion at all when none of the people commuting in from the suburbs are paying the cost? Sure congestion is a problem but offering the teacher hiring policies as the solution is tantamount to making city taxpayers and especially their children pay the price when it really should be the people creating the congestion that pay the price.

Keeping the teachers in the city drives higher house prices... to the tune of maybe a few hundreds of dollars of tax revenue per year per teacher at most, and probably not even that.

I don't associate with the self-flagellation you describe on the Left over colonialism. Overall, I am vey proud to identify with the history of Western Liberal Civilization. Western liberal democracies have wrought the greatest period of peace, prosperity, and human progress in the entire history of humanity.

I also take big issue with the way you (accurately) describe many leftists as perceiving contemporary race relations. I am very worried about the way that illiberal leftists treat all blacks and all whites as monoliths. The reality is that only a small portion of whites are ever part of the economic elite at a given time. Even amongst whites, most were always living on the economic edge. Which is an obvious observation of reality.

In this framing, *gender* refers specifically to the culturally constructed aspects of femininity and masculinity.

I don't know who amongst the ""TERFs"" and other ""anti-woke leftists"" is saying that there is biological sex requirement to perform whatever gender and assume whatever gender roles. There are definitely men and women who are more feminine or masculine so to the extent people call that a ""gender spectrum"", it isn't totally unreasonable.

Where they fail is when they try to say that *biological sex* is socially constructed, or when they say that biological sex *is a spectrum*. False. Isn't true. Dictionary definition of ""sex"" has to do with reproductive genitalia and genotypes. 99% of people have either unambiguously male genitalia and XY chromosomes or unambiguously female genitalia and XX chromosomes. There is no reasonable way to call that a ""spectrum"". Sometimes they will argue that we're wrong to define ""biological sex"" only by genitalia, but that goes back to the point you rightly make out in your OP: you can censor the concept of ""biological sex"" or you can censor the concept that genitalia is relevant to biological sex, but you can't eliminate the reality that the genitals a person was born with has strong correlations with other aspects of their physiology and would be relevant information in many real world situations."

At the very least, the topic should be up for debate without being a fireable offense!

We are talking about the issue of biological sex, which just means whether a person has a penis or a vagina. It is very simple. In over 99% of people, there are unambiguously male or unambiguously female genotypic and phenotypic traits. In other words, 99%+ of people have either XY chromosomes and unambiguously male genitalia or XX chromosomes and unambiguously female genitalia.

But to be honest, I was already very familiar with the gender vs. sex distinction, I studied it in anthropology courses, but I was less familiar with details of the genetic distinctions between biological males and females. So in the next section when it started talking about different chromosome patterns besides XX and XY, and started talking about how people with XX chromosomes can have male genitalia and people with XY can have female, I was intrigued. Even though this cutesy little work of political narrative-building had distorted its ass off about the definition of ""sex"", maybe I was about to learn something new about the genetic variables involved. After all, this document isn't saying anything about prevalence of these differing genotypes. It must be that these differing genotypes are common- it must be that myself or someone I know is some a person with male genitalia and an XX chromosome, right? Let me just do some quick googling to confirm... god damnit your pamphlet was lying again. All those examples your pamphlet mentions, the people with the XXY or XXXX or other abnormal chromosomes, the people with XX chromosomes and a penis or XY and a vag, the people with both genitals or indeterminable genitals, the people whose non-standard sexual biology doesn't even get noticed until they go through puberty or until they try to get pregnant, all of those nonstandard examples together add up to, *at the high end of the estimates*, 1% of people. That means that for every 1 person who is anywhere on this ""spectrum"" of biological sex that this pamphlet purports, there are another 99 people who are either XX with a vagina or XY with a penis. That is a binary distribution with an outlier, not a ""spectrum"", lord spare me this cursed 30 page lying-ass pamphlet.

But it is a great example of the sort of political narrative-building that I am talking about. It is a fairly transparent piece of obfuscatory propaganda- who the hell could read through 20 pages talking about wide and wonderful spectrum or biological sex that doesn't mention once the prevalence of any of those other parts of the spectrum... which each turn out to have prevalences like, ""1 in 110,000 babies"" or ""1 in 20,000 male babies""?

Regarding sports, again, this is a very straightforward thing: the reason we have separate womens sports in the first place is so that they don't have to compete with men. You may have a trans woman who feels as light and feminine as a flower, who in every way sincerely embodies the female gender identity, but to the extent that this person spent some or all of their physical development years under male hormones, that person likely has a physiological advantage in athletic endeavors. That is all. And Also, I don't even really care. If no biological female ever wins another athletic medal ever again, whatever, that is between the cis and the trans females, they can deal with it amongst themselves. I am not some white knight out here to save the female athletes lol. Female athletes have plenty of agency they can deal with the issue themselves. If the cis female athletes did decide that they wanted to ban trans female athletes from competing in their leagues, that would make the most sense to me, and I would support them. I also support making ""male"" athletics unisex. Any women should be allowed to compete. People talk once in a while about potential female NFL kickers. Hell, if there is a cis woman out there who can play linebacker in the NFL, that is something I would pay to see."

Your centrist friends are clearly wrong because there is no evidence that many of the ""centrist"" Democratic candidates are less triggering to Trump voters, and in fact the case may be the opposite. There is much evidence that many Trump voters in key tossup states like Michigan would have voted for Bernie, but not Clinton. What Trump voters were reacting against was this perception of a heavily corrupted and corporatized mainstream political institutions, and a candidate that represents those same institutions, as Clinton did, isn't going to do any better with Trump voters.

Your radical friends are clearly wrong as well, because how delusional do you have to be to miss that the left has completely forsaken all connection with the working class, that the far left has become the exclusive domain of the over-educated under-worked bourgeois, and that not in the next 1 million years is there a conceivable scenario where the working class are won over to wokeness ideology?

The most charitable ""steel-manning"" of your message is that you're saying that ""just like you, illegal immigrants did nothing wrong, so to boot them out of the country makes just as much sense as booting a law-abiding self-sustaining citizen out of the country"".

Which is a certain ideological outlook. I know there are people who believe in completely open borders, perhaps you count yourself as one of them? But the American electorate does not have that outlook. The majority of Americans favor stricter immigration enforcement than what they're getting. And I myself tend towards the outlook that, ""sovereign nations have the right to set and enforce their own immigration policies"". European countries don't have open borders policies. Mexico doesn't have open borders policies. The American people don't *want* open borders policies. And to the extent that some of them think that Republicans are the only hope of movement on that policy, they will be more likely to vote for Republicans.

Seeing that you come from the neoliberal background, I will add that I agree with the standard neoliberal outlook that open borders and unlimited immigration would allow for maximum total economic growth. No dispute from me there. But I take it to the next level of analysis and see... that the very reason that it maximizes economic growth is because it minimizes low-skill wages, which leads to increasing wealth disparity (which in my worldview leads necessarily to social degradation), and we have never been able to implement any effective wealth transfer mechanisms to redistribute the *Kaldor-Hicks* improvements of unlimited immigration to the low-skilled laborers whose wages get depressed."
AskALiberal,fc5xp7a,t3_egb2op,1577468070.0,">What are your thoughts on the “they do the jobs Americans won’t” argument.

It is obviously a false platitude. There is no job that an American won't do for the right wage.

Look, it is not net bad for the immigrant workers. They are not the ones being made worse-off. Compared to where they came from, being a strawberry picker in the USA is a huge improvement. As far as which country you want to be an illegal immigrant in, the US might be the very best in the world: we have more compassion and assistance than most other countries, and we have much less stringent enforcement than European countries or Japan. If you're not a war refugee, Germany, Italy, Denmark, they will all boot you out instantly without much fuss. In comparison, in the US we have a policy of tacit acceptance of unlimited illegal immigration.

The illegal immigrants themselves aren't the only ones who benefit from the unlimited illegal immigration policy: higher skilled workers and the wealthy benefit hugely as well. The people who are the losers in the illegal immigration phenomenon are our incumbent low-skill workforce. They are the ones who suffer depressed wages when the jobs ""that they didn't want to do"" reduce their wages to minimum levels because, sure, a Guatemalan coming from a one room hut that he shared with his chickens is thrilled to make USA minimum wage.

But I ask why so many supposed Progressives on this subreddit are so quick to say that our incumbent african-american population, which suffers from the intergenerational trauma of slavery and well as the discrete impacts of Jim Crow and economic discrimination, should have to directly compete in the labor market with every mud hut villager in the entire 7 billion population world? You guys realize that its not like, after all the poor mexicans move to america and jobs are created to take them, ""then wages will be stabilize and rise""- it doesn't work like that, after all the poor mexicans come here, next it is guatemalans, and then it would be further south, and then it could be africa or asia.... as long as we have a tacit policy of unlimited illegal immigration, there is effectively an infinite supply of those illegal immigrants who can come to America, enabling our deliberate depression of low-skill wages to continue forever... since that is what you ""progressives"" want for your fellow Americans, lol."

A lot of people on this subreddit seem to be more associated with Democratic Party politics in general, with no specific allegiance to liberal ideology, and often great ignorance and disrespect towards the place of liberalism as the founding ideology of the USA and the as the substrate upon which humanity has created its greatest period of human progress and flourishing, ever.

The flaw in their worldview is that they erroneously think of the ""Democratic Party platform"" or ""Leftism"" as a coherent ideology or worldview, when in reality the popular politics of the Democratic (or Republican) Party has nothing to do with a coherent ideology, but rather is based on competing interests amongst the Democratic Party electorate. That is why the platforms of the political parties are so often at odds with themselves: they are not the result of a philosophical and logical undertaking, but of an electoral undertaking. Why do most Democrats/US Leftists advocate both for more low-skill labor immigration AND for higher wages for low-skill laborers, when those goals are at absolute odds with each other? Why do Democrats vote to spend money on public transportation but then also vote to spend money on home mortgage subsidies, highways, and other state spending that enables sprawl and makes that public transportation into a wasteful boondoggles? Why do Democrats vote for ethanol mandates while also voting for programs to subsidize food for the poor and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, even though biofuel mandates increase food prices and crowd out greener energy alternatives? Because ""Democrat"" is not an ideology, it is a electorate that includes both incumbent laborers and unions as well as immigrant activists, public transport supporters as well as single family home owners, farmers, hunger activists, and environmentalists, all of which have conflicting interests.

So in my opinion, ""Leftism"" has nothing interesting to say about the issues of the day. ""Leftism"" just means ""the collected interests of the left-most 50% of the political spectrum, which are in direct conflict with each other nearly as often as they are in alignment with each other"".

In contrast, Liberalism is an actual political philosophy. It does not provide definitive answers, but it is at least a logical framework through which to intellectually explore various policy ideas and social trends. To me, that is the worthwhile side of this subreddit. The other side of this subreddit, people posting Leftist platitudes and Democratic campaign narratives, formulated not as intellectually honest, universally-applicable political philosophies, but as demonstrations of political identity allegiance and empty marketing slogans, I always ignore that part."
AskALiberal,fby16do,t3_eezmtw,1577205605.0,"Realistically, there is good competition amongst private teams to hire female soccer players. There are private soccer teams around the world and the way that sports leagues operate in most places outside the USA is much more favorable towards the players than the rules typical of the US pro sports leagues which operate as cartels with explicit policies that drive down player wages such as salary caps and profit sharing. So there is a lot of market competition for players, which suggests that they are getting paid but they are worth. But female pro soccer is very unpopular everywhere on the planet, and people don't care even when their local team is winning, which means that it isn't worth it to pay players very much.

The Olympics may be a different economic situation. Firstly, the market for labor is infinitely less competitive, since it is a monopsony with the USA Women's Soccer being the only possible employer for American female soccer players. Secondly, olympic women's soccer is elevated in value for the same reasons that all the otherwise-ignored sports are elevated for the olympics. They get a huge boost in visibility, they share in the general excitement over the olympics, and there is a sense of ""a medal is a medal"" in terms of the medal counts for national pride. Sure, some medals are  more sought after than others, but when it comes to counting the medals each country won, a medal in women's soccer or air rifle is just as good as medals in gymnastics or track. Thirdly, enthusiasm around men's olympic soccer stifled since many of the best players don't play in the olympics.

To me this suggests that it is likely that the US Women's Soccer team would likely get paid less than they are worth without the union and an implicit threat of a strike to bargain for better wages. The US Olympic organizers have strong incentives to win any gold medals they can, and to pay the people who can do it a high wage, but with monopsony buying power, they have no reason to do so unless the players are predicted to strike if refused the money."
TeslaLounge,fbqvdld,t3_edq884,1577036053.0,"It's not just the software, Tesla is not prioritizing the markets that get super cold like the Midwest. They seem to just be surrendering those markets for the time being. Maybe they will get their act together if they ever face more competition for electric cars. If The US automakers start to git good at electric cars for example, being based in Detroit I would expect them to come out with relatively good engineering solutions to cold weather performance, which might compel Tesla to respond.

First of all, multiple other electric cars either offer or include as standard a *heat pump* to greatly reduce the energy requirements for heating the cabin (and potentially the battery as well). Heat pumps can reduce the energy required for heating by 50% to 70% by themselves. The Nissan Leaf and Jaguar I-Pace include heat pumps standard, the press releases for the Porsche Taycan says that they will offer a heat pump as an option.

Second, there is clearly some outside temperature below which it is no longer productive to expose the uninsulated battery to the environment. Sure, in southern California, 360 days of the year the ambient temperature is within the range that is perfectly fine for the battery and will help the battery shed heat at a productive rate. When it is 20\*F out, or -20\*F, that is very far from the case. The car is essentially running naked, and why? One solution could be for electric cars to include a mounting system on the underside of the car that you can attach a flat piece of airtight insulation to during the winter. Maybe it would be designed to be switched out at the same temperatures people switch to winter tires (\~45\*F). So you will leave it on for the cold months, and your car will have less phantom drain and generally require much less heat input to keep the battery at optimal temperatures. During temperature fluctuations in the Spring and Fall, say that you have this piece of insulation on during a day that spikes up to 70\*F, not a big deal, maybe it would just be the equivalent of driving your Tesla without any added insulation on a 110\*F day, as in it works perfectly fine with limitations on max performance. Also, just like people who don't bother with winter tires, there is no need to install this battery insulation. It would just be a big boost to your effective range if you wanted to bother."
