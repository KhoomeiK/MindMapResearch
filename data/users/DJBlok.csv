This means that if your kid *doesn't* end up believing in your religion, then as a 'Godly' parent...you done fucked up somewhere. 


This is why parents often claim that their kids 'don't respect them' when they don't believe in their religion since, to them, it's *not* a choice.

This kills a lot of the leverage that unions have since it makes it easier for companies to win the PR game that union strikes can come down to. 

Also take into consideration that we directly pay for the products and services in the private industry, and that the company will tell the public that increases in pay and benefits will mean an increase in price for the product/service.

At one point in the series, they were down 3 games to 1, and Leafs fans were prepared to be disappointed *again*. Because *of course* the Leafs were going to lose.

But then they won game 5, and then game 6! Leafs fans were starting to feel that forbidden emotion again: hope. 

Next thing you know, they're up 3-1 and with just under 15 minutes left in the game, Kadri puts the dagger through the hearts of the Bruins, by scoring to make it 4-1. Leafs fans at this point are in full ""Start planning the parade!"" mode.

They don't *really* know whether you'll meet someone or not, and it's likely they haven't put much thought towards that other than ""they're a great person"" (which is very non-descript as well). To be fair, even if they're a friend, it would be difficult to make a real judgement about your chances, but that would require getting into a deep talk about your issues, which is a lot to ask of someone. So I can see why it's just easier to give a platitude. Which is fair. No one owes it to anyone else to cheer them up.

Remind yourself that your feelings are just that...feelings. If the less emotional part of you isn't ready to act on those feelings yet, you can choose to try to ignore them. I will say, though, that ignoring feelings is easier said than done. If you're not ready for a relationship, and find it not to think about things that way, it would probably be best to tell him that this won't work right now.
2. No one owes us anything. Yes, ghosting can be considered rude, but we don't know people's reasons for why they do it. And it does no good to try to figure out why. So if it happens, just move on. There will be other guys. 
3. Tell him? FWB situations need communication just like a 'normal' relationship does. It's just that the nature of the communication is more about making sure you're on the same page and letting each other know if how you feel about things changes."

But I feel that if you look at human psychology, and *especially* after reading a lot of the comments here, that their importance in other people's lives is a much bigger deal than it actually is in reality. And finding out that not as many people give a shit about us as we think can be a huge hit to our ego."

relationships,fel5b0f,t3_epn97o,1579214373.0,"Having been the older guy in this kind of relationship (almost exact same age), I can attest to the age gap being a problem. Even *if* he has honorable intentions.

My SO ended up growing and changing a lot over the years and after 5 years she realized that there were things that she wanted to do or didn't do because I was at an age where certain things just didn't appeal to me (for instance, going out clubbing). And it's not like I didn't stop her from doing things when we were together; it's just that she realized that she had aligned her interests too much with mine instead of trying to find her own interests. 

Once she started actually exploring her own interests and discovering who she was more, the more we both realized that we weren't going to work long-term. Of course, we didn't want to admit that, even to each other, and we still tried to make things work. In the end, however, she finally told me that this wasn't working anymore, and after much discussion we parted ways.

Now, this isn't to say that things *can't* work, because no two situations are exactly alike; but there are many inherent problems in that kind of age difference that can make things harder than it would be for a couple who are closer in age.

I do wish you good luck if you continue, however!"

dating,fegui3v,t3_ep1vn9,1579102820.0,"Sometimes someone is perfect for us, but we're not perfect for them. And it sucks. It hurts, cause we tend to take it personally, as if there's something wrong with us that the person we want doesn't feel the same about us. 

But that doesn't mean anything is wrong with you. It's just an uncomfortable truth that we have to deal with regarding incompatibility. Look at it this way... Would you have been fine being with him if he was only with you because he was perfect for you? Even if he would never truly feel fulfilled himself, but was still a perfect gentleman, and would never even think of cheating, and fulfilled everything you need in a relationship?"
