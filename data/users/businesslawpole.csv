antinatalism,ff7eq6i,t1_ff6nrj4,1579647841.0,"You can’t have kids and expect them to grow up and consent to living. Your parents made that decision for you. Plenty of people want to die, but don’t want to kill themselves out of fear. Some people are scare they will be unsuccessful. I don’t think it’s wrong, illegal, or immoral to encourage somebody to kill themselves. However, I do think it’s wrong & immoral to continue to have kids with the expectation they live and mIt commit suicide."
antinatalism,ff7egs9,t1_ff6nrj4,1579647670.0,No it’s his parents fault. Stop having kids. This guy was miserable.
antinatalism,ff7ecaj,t1_ff6m94z,1579647588.0,Don’t have kids.
antinatalism,ff68f6i,t1_ff5y5a5,1579621578.0,"She wasn’t there so he had the option to not kill himself. If you want to kill yourself that’s your decision. People can encourage you to have kids you can’t support financially and/or emotionally, but it’s a problem to encourage an already suicidal person to off yourself? If you’re on a ledge I’m not going to stop you. You don’t have to live. Stop having kids that don’t want to be here."
antinatalism,ff5xal4,t1_ff5m5kj,1579613317.0,He was already suicidal. If he wanted to die that was his final decision. I believe there should be assisted suicide so that people can go out peacefully. Besides we didn’t sign up to be here. So it is your decision not to live. Simply don’t have kids because this is one of the things that can happen to them as a result of living in pain and suffering everyday. It’s not her fault!

antinatalism,ff56r22,t3_erncz3,1579581837.0,"I would tell them that sometimes I don’t want to be here. Sometimes people with kids don’t want to be here as well. However, the argument for antinatalism is to not have children. You can’t unborn yourself, but you can prevent others from being born by simply not having children. I am already here suffering. My goal is to prevent this suffering from happening to my own kids by not having them. In addition, I will cause more pain and suffering by killing myself because someone will miss me. Antinatalism is about the prevention of being born—not suicide."
antinatalism,ff4kz0k,t3_eqxce9,1579566139.0,Wow— why do people try so hard to have kids? If it don’t come easy naturally give it up. This means you don’t need any kids. When this kid grows up they will ask why didn’t you just stop? This is unnecessary

Divorce_Men,feirhol,t3_epdi8p,1579145365.0,You can contact the legal aid in your state to see if they have any pro bono attorneys that can assist you. Also contact law schools in your state. They may have a Family Law clinic with student attorneys supervised by an Attorney that can take your case.

Before ceiling fans there were floor fans. Someone probably thought hey this should go on the ceiling to circulate more air and takes up less space.

antinatalism,fefg1ma,t3_eoq96l,1579055558.0,"Poverty was a part of the reason I got an abortion when I was 18. I wasn’t about to raise no baby on welfare. I wasn’t bout to be begging the government to take care of my child. I said f*ck that. 

Being a mother is not all these people have. Honestly— it’s just nothing to do when you are poor. Your options come down drugs, alcohol, and sex. My sister had her first born when she was 16. Why? Boredom. You need something to occupy your time and when you don’t have anything positive— well you probably just fine spend a lot of time f*cking and sucking. 

Poverty shouldn’t exist— but the government isn’t going to solve your money problems. People create their own poverty by having kids. People will have a baby with $1 to their name because they think babies are a gift from God and God gone supply all their needs."

I wonder do she think life is worth living. Even after the surgery she looks miserable. They need to make assisted suicide legal. Why force people into the world and force them to stay living in pain!?? Make it make sense.. ."
