offmychest,femekdh,t3_epndfj,1579251415.0,"I couldnt have said it better than that, life is a fucking shit show, I'm still trying to comprehend why God started my heart again the night I wrecked my car, I didnt ask to be born but here I am still suffering and have been since birth, married to a cheating man somehow I feel responsible. Alls I can tell myself is I must have been a royal piece of shit in my last life to be suffering through this life. The scars on my body and in my heart are the only things giving me strength to live another day with the hope that I'll experience true happiness before I'm worthy of death"
offmychest,fehx40l,t3_eouddd,1579125601.0,Suck because your parents put pity over responsibility as parents. Pity and guilt are two very easily manipulated emotions and your brothers using those to his advantage

offmychest,fdqrizf,t3_emrq2g,1578673333.0,Not necessarily wrong like I said I've experienced being rejected and treated rudely and was told I shouldn't try to talk to them because I'm normal so I should just go talk to normal people and leave them alone because they didnt need normal people in their life.
offmychest,fdqm7wv,t3_emrq2g,1578669998.0,Well believe it or not but people with autism treat people the same ways they reject normal people and I myself experienced it. What should they feel? What should we feel when its done to us? So b4 you go ranting about people rejecting autistic people remember they're capable of being just as rude to others.
