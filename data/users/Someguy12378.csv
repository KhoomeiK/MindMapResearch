askteenboys,ffpo4nm,t3_euh65b,1580100059.0,"I'd rather not be touched unless I know you very well, trust you with my life and it's a hug and nothing else"
askteenboys,ffpo28p,t3_euhe9i,1580100004.0,Find something to do in place of it (don't overdo THAT though) and just stop going to the places you go. Maybe put a block in place so it's inconvenient to get to.
modernwarfare,ffpnx6o,t1_ffpnexr,1580099888.0,"RPG is a pain. Good luck with the ground streaks. If it hasn't been patched, PRadars, CUAVs and VTOLs count as ground.

As for weapon choice, I picked the Deagle because it's the best in hardcore and after finishing the X16 I needed something easy, and the AK is because it's one of my favourite guns in basically anything. Really solid for hardcore too, the consistent 1 hits are very nice."
modernwarfare,ffpi0pm,t1_ffpgus4,1580095532.0,Whatever I'm golding at the moment. Right now it's the AK47 and Deagle

modernwarfare,ffjzubd,t3_etvd9y,1580011525.0,Of course you have the classic toxic dickhead in the chat hating others for playing in a way that's fun for them in a game they paid for
modernwarfare,ffjzlf4,t1_ffjuli3,1580011320.0,Aww you don't wanna see the guy who was in the back of his spawn all game spray someone with the M4?

Like, seriously. It was made 3 days before my account c'mon man"
askteenboys,ffj5isk,t1_ffiwuc9,1579990924.0,"That sub is just a shithole of complaints tbh.

They complain when a quest is too easy (Devil's Ruin), they complain when it's too hard (CoT), they complain when the reward is a gun they were excited for a week earlier. I find it's best to avoid that place.

Also if you are a Hunter and say Hunter's aren't OP prepare for downvotes because Hunter bad, Warlocks are the only class with bugs"
