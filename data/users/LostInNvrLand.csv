TooAfraidToAsk,ffugiuh,t3_euxto6,1580241475.0,"I believe people know what he’s done. That’s the thing he’s always in the public eye, nobody has forgotten what he did. But people put things in the past. We’re all human at the end of the day. I’m sure we’ve all made mistakes that we don’t want talked about 5-10 years from now. When someone dies I don’t think people want to think negative about someone, they want to remember the good in a person. Celebrities are always under the public eye...so they don’t get a pass. I think us as civilians get a pass. I would HATE to have someone constantly bring up something I did years ago when I was young and stupid. Hope this give some understanding.."
