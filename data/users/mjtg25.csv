# FAQ

## What does this mean?

The amount of karma (points) on your post and Reddit account has decreased by one.

## Why did you do this?

There are several reasons I may deem a post to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:

* Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeepost,
* Low effort posts,
* Shitposting.

## Am I banned from Reddit?

No - not yet. But you should refrain from making posts like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.

## I don't believe my post deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?

Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.

## How can I prevent this from happening in the future?

Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right."
