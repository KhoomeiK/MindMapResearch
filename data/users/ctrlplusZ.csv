Games,ffeiz84,t3_esxm5p,1579849942.0,Man when this was new I loved tearing it up but I put it down. Played again recently and just got destroyed by sweaties. Everyone got so damn good at this game.

justneckbeardthings,ffa1iar,t3_esfdh6,1579725999.0,"Here's the situation. They're not in fashion anymore. It's over for the dress hat. The same way the corsette the parasol or driving gloves have gone, so too have fedoras. Don't wear them, not even with a 3-piece suit and you're in shape and it's a wedding. They're not cool anymore."

OverwatchUniversity,ff25gjb,t3_er2k53,1579494336.0,I've been playing a few months and I haven't played rank yet. I'm honestly reluctant to deal with PUGs for this reason and can't imagine it being any fun with all the toxic sweaties. Maybe if I played with a stack but I only have two friends who play and they hate the pressure of ranked too. What's the benefit to playing it? Genuine question.

Cyberpunk,fc5b7hg,t1_fc5118g,1577451881.0,I'd say servicers are essential in a restaurant unless you do counter service with buzzers and the customer comes to get their order themselves. The drones are cool but pretty pointless considering they only take one plate at a time on a lane that only fits one of them to move a dish 10 feet. Add to that the cost of install and maintenance as well as losing table space for the awkward track in the middle of every table. I like new tech but this is just awkward for the sake of having robots for novelty.
