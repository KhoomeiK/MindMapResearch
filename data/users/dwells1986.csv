gaming,ffp6q25,t1_ffp69zr,1580087621.0,"Because PSX and N64 often didn't render games in even 480i? The resolutions were often smaller and were stretched onto 480i CRTs. Playing the same games on modern LCDs that are both widescreen and capable of between 720p and 4K resolutions makes them damn near unplayable.

The tech back then was designed to take advantage of the scan lines on 480i CRT televisions.

Today's hardware exposes the flaws, so to speak. At a bare minimum, you need a scan line filter. At best, there are Hi Rez and Widescreen mods available.

Playing Ocarina of Time at 1080p and in widescreen is basically a whole new experience. I can never go back.
