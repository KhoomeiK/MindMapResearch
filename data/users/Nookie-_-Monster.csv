It certainly is beyond ""just entertainment"" and I wasn't trying to reduce his podcast to that. I've been exposed to a lot of subjects through his podcast that I wouldn't have been otherwise. But the onus is still on the viewer to verify any info presented there. I would have to disagree with this exactly for the point being made above with regards to Larry King.

Without more specific details as to what exactly you're struggling with, it's hard to give advice on how to approach / study for the class.

Some general advice for proofs though might be to keep in mind the result you want to prove. In my early days, I would often be doing a proof by following my nose only to get nowhere because I had lost sight of the end result. If you get stuck, you might want to try a different method or invoke some other result. For if-then statements, depending on what method you use (eg, direct, contradiction, contrapositive) there should be a very clear starting point and a relatively clear idea of how to get to your end result. There are also some pretty standard methods for proving certain types of results and you'll pick up on this with time and practice. Good luck"

You don't have to wait til the end to adjust to a proper merging speed. When I merge, I make sure I merge at the same speed as the traffic in the lane I'm merging into so that the car behind me doesn't have to brake. It's not that hard.

I agree with the sentiment but I don't think thats the case here. I can't imagine mean/median is anywhere near as accurate at measuring wealth inequality as gini. For example, gini would account for a single individual skewing the data in a big way, OPs method has no way of accounting for such a thing and can thus show (theoretically at least) a much greater gap in equality than is actually present

Edit: As an example, if 9 out of 10 people have $10 in wealth and the 10th person has $1000 in wealth, then the median is $10 but average is $109. The mean/median method would show a large wealth gap when in fact, the vast majority of the population see no disparity between each other's wealth (this isn't to say that having a single individual that is exponentially wealthier than the rest of the population can't be problematic). You could also have outliers on both sides, giving a very similar data set but with very different mean/median ratio (much closer to 1).

Another thing that may be useful is the fact that every action defines a homomorphism and vice versa. For example if a group G (left) acts on a set X, then this defines a homomorphism (we'll call it phi) from G to the symmetric group on X.

nextfuckinglevel,fco0vyf,t1_fcmemzi,1577822085.0,"I never understood this line of reasoning. Why ban assault rifles? The vast majority of homicides (and gun suicide) are committed with hand guns. If your solution to reducing gun deaths is to take away guns, then we should first look at hand guns, not assault rifles. However, I am in favor of mandatory training courses and other regulations. I just don't think bans are helpful whatsoever"
