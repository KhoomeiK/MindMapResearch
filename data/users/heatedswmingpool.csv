i do too. i realized that i wasn't being some whiney baby who didn't want to work. i felt overwhelmed. my last day there three other people cried in the bathroom (i made 4). 

me too! i am certainly better for it. i don't have many. i foster cats, and i like to decorate house. i'm into crafting and for christmas i made a bunch of stuff. i have a piano and basic piano skills so i need to get myself to start playing more."
offmychest,fd1t5mo,t1_fd1oh1a,1578136412.0,"no i get that everyone can't engage, or doesn't know what to say to some things. i frequent a lot of fb groups for domestic violence survivors and i certainly have those moments. that's the beauty in the internet you know? i think what i meant is that sometimes i just encounter a lot of users who are just kind of... rude or cold. i was in another sub where i thanked someone for their advice and it helped me feel less bad about quitting a job where i was working the late shift. someone commented, and essentially put me down for quitting because it was only a 6hr shift. it was a little uncalled for. a late shift is not everyone. i know that's just one person, but this has been a regular experience for me, too. 

but thanks for your input. have fun with the son!"
offmychest,fd1pa2f,t1_fd1n0mc,1578134684.0,"hey thanks! 

i have. my most recent therapist never really took me serious when i talked about my issues with suicidal ideation. i felt like he just dismissed it like it was a non-issue. i stopped seeing him because conflicting schedules. tha'ts not to say i didn't have positive experiences. the one before was kinda.... wacky. so i stopped seeing her. i want/need to go back, but just bad experiences are holding me back. i also got a letter recently my last therapist would no longer be covered by my insurance.

sure! so i am a 25 yr old female. currently i don't work, or go to school. i recently took a job at a fast food place, but quit after 3 days. i was working the late night shift, and that triggered a really intense breakdown. i was considering putting myself on a hold. i felt guilty but i was so tired. i am also a DV/sexual assault survivor. i've had multiple abusers and recently kicked the last one out of my life. then to add to that in oct i had to put my 6m old kitten down due to a fatal illness. she was my best best friend."
offmychest,fd1o5lf,t1_fd1maxq,1578134139.0,"hey! thanks so much! appreciate that, i certainly will.

hugs to you too!"
offmychest,fd1o28a,t3_ejsfrd,1578134090.0,"owie i just started crying because i am in a similar position. it's hard to enjoy tv or movies sometimes bc i get soooo sad when scenes like that come on. that feeling of yearning is just so overwhelming.  


i've never kissed anyone who has like truly liked and cared about me. it is such a lonely feeling. every person i have kissed either took advantage of me or just didn't want to be with me. nye sucked because i had to stand around watching all my friends kissing their s/o. i was dreading it all night. there was an added cherry of an old flame being at the party and then later i caught his girlfriend cheating on him. it was  fun mix of emotions."
jobs,fd1j03j,t1_fcvc54j,1578131898.0,"i worked in food service for 51/2 years prior to this. in my experience if you didn't have boundaries you were taken advantage of. you're right, it's something to get used to, but i didn't want to work the late night shift for a fast food chain that is constantly busy at all hours of the day."
jobs,fd1ikh1,t1_fcvddvx,1578131725.0,the realization i was going to be giving up my social life really affected me. i'd been working office jobs for the last 3+ years so i wasn't used to that. it was only three days of my life but it greatly impacted my mental health. it really triggered a breakdown. the good news is i have been interviewing with this company that is standard 8-5. crossing my fingers.
jobs,fd1h5kl,t1_fcvecpc,1578131321.0,"frankly i just didn't want to, and i think that's completely ok. my schedule would have eventually increased to 10pm-6am. it may have been a few days but it negatively impacted my mental health. i also have issues with sleeping as it is due to trauma related issues. i need to keep a proper sleep schedule.

but good for you that you can handle that kind of schedule."
jobs,fd1g2z9,t1_fcwkjd4,1578130907.0,thanks! someone of the comments that i got back did make me feel a little guilty.
jobs,fcv6h06,t3_ej38g0,1577995638.0,"hey thanks for this! i've been grappling with this idea lately. i've been unemployed for awhile, but recently took a job at a fast food place. i ended up quitting after 3 days because all i wanted to do was get a good night's rest (the hrs were 10pm-4am). it's hard to talk to my mom about this kind of thing because she makes me feel bad for having boundaries with my employers.

i appreciate the advice!"

I have come down with yet another migraine."
offmychest,fcj62a7,t1_fcj599n,1577678161.0,"yeah np. i totally understand that. for me the way i see it is, if i know what is i can better address the issue. for instance, i was having really bad stomach aches, trouble eating, rapid weight loss. turns out i had chronic heartburn so they gave me a script for some medicine. now when it acts up, i take my medication, i try to avoid the foods that will trigger my acid reflux. i know what it is so i can treat."
offmychest,fcj58lz,t3_ehg7c6,1577677583.0,"may i ask what you take? what do you do to curve the adjustment side affects. i take lexapro and have trouble sleeping so i don't take it regularly, but i want to be more consistent with taking my medication."
offmychest,fcj537w,t3_ehg7sn,1577677478.0,"do not go back. trauma bonding is a hell of a drug. i am a DV survivor, and i still in some way love my abusive ex, but i know he is dangerous. it's hard, and it's a process, but you will be so much better for it if you stay away. read anything you can on domestic violence. youtube videos helped give me the confidence i needed to leave for good. however, know that if you choose to stay with him that's ok, too, just stay safe out there. whatever decision you make is the right decision."
offmychest,fcj4a5n,t3_ehg9io,1577676910.0,"have you ever thought about ADHD? you describe a lot of my own personal troubles and i have been meaning to get screened. i'm not sure of your situation, but just read up on ADHD you might be surprised. i know i was. i know what your feeling. for me, math was difficult and i felt like internally combusting. i know i've had the same thought myself; thinking i am mentally disabled. no disrescpt to those w disabiliies, but i def felt like i was be treated in a similar fashion; lesser than, and stupid.

know that you are not stupid. you are very capable, you may just need some accommodations. i hope that it gets better for you."
doordash,fbktoq5,t3_edsesr,1576955259.0,hate this shit. i will not understand why people do not tip. and of course i'm like eff u DD for giving me this ass pay.
