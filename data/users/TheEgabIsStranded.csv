People died as a result of what Trump did. What's equal about what Biden did?

See, right here shows your coming into it in bad faith. You're so quick to say Biden committed a crime, but Trump ""may or may not have."" It wasn't may or may not have, Trump DID commit it. You're so quick to defend Trump but accuse Biden, while you yourself are saying to look at both sides. Trump and Biden can both be investigated, why are you acting like only one can happen? Again, Tump has priority because *he's literally the sitting president*, that's more important than an ex-vice president.
