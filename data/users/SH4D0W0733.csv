halo,fd5itsl,t1_fd56mr6,1578178052.0,"Spawning in the enemy base has always been a possibility, not because of how the spawn system works but because of how the maps are made.

You can make spawn points that are team exclusive, such as red only or blue only or orange only. But Bungie instead tends to make their maps into neutral spawns only, and then put a huge team spawn zone cowering half the map on top of that for objective gametypes. (The zone doesn't make the spawns exclusive, but they do increase the chance of spawning on spawns cowered by your team zone.) This means that you can spawn in the enemy base, theoretically but it would only be if all of the spawns on your teams side of the map are horribly reduced in suitability from people getting killed and nearby enemies. As can happen in a really one sided game.

So, preventing spawns in opponnents base is as easy as just putting down team specific spawn points, or putting down more spawn points over all to prevent all places from being unsuitable at the same time."
halo,fd5eruv,t1_fd5afnc,1578176889.0,"It's practically impossible to create a spawn system that uses line of sight to the spawn point to determine if it is safe. It would be very system intensive with 20 - 40 objects constantly trying to look in all directions at once looking for enemies. It would also be blocked by a single tree, meaning enemies could still be nearby when you spawn.

That's why the current spawn system uses a field around each spawn point that sees if an enemy is within it, regardless if there are walls between it and the player. IIRC it's about 1 warthog length in all directions as a sphere, but don't quote that as a fact.

What could be done is increase the size of this field, so it can recognize enemies from further away, but this would completely ruin spawning on smaller maps like Countdown or Anchor 9."

3 - Other spawn points may have been demed unsafe because of nearby enemies or players spawning at one of them dying quickly after. (This would've reduced the spawn score of those points.)"
