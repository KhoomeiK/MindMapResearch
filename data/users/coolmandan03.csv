Well, there's billion dollar hospitals and insurance companies that'll sue the federal government if they lose out. There's a ton of waste in our current existing government. The terribly run VA system is evidence that government doesn't know how to run an efficient health care system. Typically, the feds get involved and it increases cost, like how giving out federally backed student loans only increased the cost of tuition.  No one wants to pay higher taxes and charging a higher corporate tax will hurt corporations (which is why our GDP is so high because they're here) 

There's just some examples off the top of my head. Really it comes down to the fact that Americans are different than other countries. We also have more gang violence and amusement parks than anywhere else. Our melting pot culture makes it difficult to get everyone on board."

Never said this, since I continue to claim that doctors and patients should make the choice and not legislation. 

Don't claim that every single person on earth should receive gender reassignment surgery^1 .  I think medical professionals should be the ones in charge of their patients well being, and it should ultimately be their choice with the patient - not the child and not legislation.  And since some people [regret the decision of gender reassignment \(between 1% and 8%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detransition)), it seems that putting that decision on a child who we don't trust to make decisions in driving a car, tattoos, smoking or drinking wouldn't be right either.

I think the choices should be made by the **doctor and the medical profession** and neither the patient or legislators.  I worry that the opposite of this law is forcing a doctor to work on a client that does reassignment surgery because the minor/parent wants the procedure done.  And just like a doctor can't pick and choose who they want to work on for a lung surgery, they wouldn't be able to pick and choose if a minor isn't in the right capacity to get a procedure done.

This took a[ quick 10 second search](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/when-transgender-kids-transition-medical-risks-are-both-known-and-unknown/):

> The shift is because of the concerns over the impact that delaying puberty for too long can have on development, physically, emotionally and socially.
> 
> The physical changes that hormones bring about are irreversible, making the decision more weighty than taking puberty blockers. Some of the known side effects of hormones include things that might sound familiar: acne and changes in mood. Patients are also warned that they may be at higher risk for heart disease or diabetes later in life. The risk of blood clots increases for those who start estrogen. And the risk for cancer is an unknown, but it is included in the warnings doctors give their patients.
> 
> Another potential dilemma facing transgender children, their families and their doctors is this: Taking cross hormones can reduce fertility. And there isn’t enough research to find out of it is reversible or not. So when children make the decision to start taking hormones, they have to consider whether they ever want to have biological children.

I never made a claim that a parent abused a child and forced them into transition, although I do think it's a grey area about what the parent wants for the child, [like this story from last November](https://www.vox.com/identities/2019/11/11/20955059/luna-younger-transgender-child-custody).  I also don't hear children complain about being in beauty pageants at 6 years old; but that doesn't mean it's the parent that puts them into that mindset/lifestyle. 

And there are [lots of stories of people regretting their transition](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/feb/03/experience-i-regret-transitioning).  This isn't [unheard of](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2019/02/11/transgender-debate-transitioning-sex-gender-column/1894076002/).  But if we can't trust a 10 year old to make decisions about tattoos and smoking, then why something like potential life altering hormones?

And it's funny that you have nothing to do on a Monday than make claims without any sources or links.  I'm all for transgender groups and kids should wear/act however they want.  But when you start making life-altering choices that require a doctors approval - I think it should be the doctors/physiologist's choice and not a law."

WhitePeopleTwitter,fejr4u3,t1_fejqxcn,1579183764.0,Do you think raising the minimum wage wont be absorbed in higher priced goods and rent?
WhitePeopleTwitter,fejqpj1,t1_fejqkeb,1579183448.0,"That's the point... they need higher wages because of their high cost of living - because of their 'free' health care.  It's outrageously expensive and they pay a lot for it, just through different means."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fejmu90,t1_fej2vv4,1579180196.0,So are you referring to the France where the [Yellow Vest Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_vests_movement) is still going on after more than a year? A movement started from high fuel cost and high cost of living?
WhitePeopleTwitter,fejmhiw,t1_fej031q,1579179867.0,"Me too. But you should check Bernie health care calculator. Because of this, it's going to raise my taxes about 4k a year. I have a problem with paying more in taxes and still no fix for any of these issues. Probably another war somewhere instead"

Denver,fei4cpe,t1_fei2wo5,1579130004.0,"Oh no, I was way behind on my bills and messed up my credit pretty bad.  Also, I moved to Denver for a job (I'm not dumb enough to move to an expensive city without any job prospect whatsoever).  And I only used a couch on craigslist a few times - most of the time I had a room on a weekly/monthly basis (either a roommate moved out or they wanted some extra cash).  I bought a $10 camping pad to sleep on.

And yeah - this was in 2009.  As most people the centuries before me, I survived without a cell phone."
