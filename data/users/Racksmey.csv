PublicFreakout,ff3l516,t1_ff3j3lx,1579543370.0,"No fault at all.  There are no slams in wrestling, there are only throws and knock downs.

The difference is control, a slam has no control at all and ussaly happens before the person being slam can prepare for it.  A throw requires setup and control through the whole process. 

An example is a shoulder throw.  You grab your oponents shoulder and use your hip as a pivot point.  Once your oponents is off the ground you must control the decent.  You drop one knee and twist at your hips in the direct you are going down.  This throw shoud either end with you opponent their back or side and you in top.

If my opponent decides to grab for leverge it os my responsibility to either change what I am doing or find an exit."

SandersForPresident,fdqpiwu,t1_fdpxhbs,1578672094.0,"First, show some respect.  Second, you forgot to take into count how many people voted on party lines.  A majority of republicans voted for trump and the sole reason was the republican party endorsed him.


Finally, Hillary Clinton should never had ran right after Obama.  The last 2 years the republicans used the bengasy incident against her.  She never properly explained this away.  Too many people on both sides saw her as bad as Trump."
explainlikeimfive,fdfugp2,t3_el3nmt,1578370523.0,"It is called predictive movement which is combined with fancy sensors.  I will not go into anymore detail than that.

The fancy sensors are cable of converting a picture to something a computer is cable of reading.  The computer determines what a threat is and is cable of computting what is called a vector.  A vector is a math way of saying movement.  The fancy sensors take picture fast enough that a computer can plot the movement.


From far away, the computer is not cable of predicting movement.  It follows the target till it is close enough to predict the movement.  At a certain distance you switch what type of fancy sensor you are using.  This new sensor is cable of taking better picture at close range.  This allow the computer to make guess for when the target is in range.  Since we know the blast radius of a missle, we detonate before we reach the target.  The blast radius is what causes the damage.


Edit typo"
tifu,fdbrrnt,t1_fdb684c,1578261028.0,"As a young adult, 26 years old, I can say you are not an adult.  An adult knows they cannot do what they want.

Finally, until you have adult respones and understanding about the consequences of your decidsions you are not an adult.  An example is, working to pay for college.


If you are actually 18, then you need to be careful about saying your an adult.  Once you are 18, your parents are no longer legally required to be responseable for you.  This means no longer providing you with a house, medical insurance, or a phone."

politics,fcv08l2,t1_fcuwzg4,1577992009.0,"A law is not constitutional when an artical in the constitution conflicts with the law.  This is ture for both state and federal laws.   A law can also be found to be not constitutional, if there is a precedent.  A precedent is how the constitution has been interpreted and applied.

The Supreme Court of the united states (SCOTUS) has responsablility to interupt the constitution and setting precedent.

The person, who applied to your comment mention that states cannot set term limits on federal offices. This is because the constitution says this out right.  

Before the 13th admendment, states decided if they would have slavery.  This is because the constitution did say anything about slavery.


TLDR:

When the constitution lacks certain language, it is left for the states to interrupt what is constitutional.  When the constitution expresses a conflict with a law, it is up to SCOTUS to interrupt the meaning of the law and agree to or disagree with the law."
