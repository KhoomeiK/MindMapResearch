There's something to be said about steam one day dying, but even then, I can pirate whatever becomes unavailable.  Even my old PC in the other room sometimes gets turned on to play something that just doesn't emulate well on Win8/32bit.  Old consoles though?  Are you really gonna have those plugged in, and will all of the games work without a connection?  To me the cost comparison is night and day.

The big draw for me with consoles used to be the couch coop, but a lot of PC games come out with coop now, and my setup is attached to a TV in my livingroom, I have multiple controllers from every generation, and I can emulate all of the old consoles too.  It's just not even a competition for me.  Any exclusives are single player so I just look forward to playing them emulated in a few years.  I tried buying nintendo consoles but paying 60 dollars for a game 3 years after it came out is painful, and then I only end up playing 1 or 2 games on it anyway."

His domain was most often limited to a single window in the back, but his power would grow and soon he would rule over each of the windows at some point in the car's life.  If your car window gnome was especially powerful, he'd disable all windows at once--but only after one was lowered.  Early automatic windows were also plagued with these creatures, but soon their numbers would dwindle as the electronic systems were upgraded.  Cash for Clunkers killed off the last of the window gnomes.  Little known fact:  USB gnomes are a distant cousin of the window gnome."

apexlegends,feg20aq,t1_fefk2qx,1579073479.0,"I didn't really understand the balance of this game at launch.  Most games launch with a pretty solid and obvious rock paper scissors, healer tank dps meta.  But their kits are just so unbalanced.  I do not understand how, at any point, they expected Bloodhound to be competitive.  Why do characters have vaguely the same ults (gibralter and bangalor)?  Why can lifeline do like 5 different things?  Why give so many heroes speed abilities when that inherently spreads teams out on these huge maps?  Why is caustic so useless in most situations and then oppressive in close quarters?  Why make mirages ult so useless when Wraith can do something that's basically a better, more effective version of it?

I love the map and weapons, but I figured the classes would be a bit more balanced by now.  Nope, it's still all over the place.  It's just weird and nonsensical, there's no parody or consistency.  It's like playing a fighting game where 2/3rds of the roster uses high, medium, and low attacks with modifiers, and the other 1/3rd uses a dodge and parry system, and another character has supers, zoning, and juggling attacks all in one.  Some of the characters have 5 healthbars, and it has nothing to do with how good the rest of their kits are.  No one plays 3 of the characters.

P.S. I PLAY almost all of the characters, and as a former TF2/1 player, there's a place for all of their abilities.  It's just that, Caustic for example, has zero mobility and likely wont get to use his kit until the final couple of circles, or as a gimmick at spawn.  I still love playing him, and have a great time playing with that gimmick, but even when he's playing at 100%, caustic is doing very little to help his team.  Meanwhile, lifeline can put up a shield when her teammates are downed, heals faster than everyone else, and doesn't need to carry health packs.  Pathfinder has one single item and dominates everyone else in the game, and it was THE item that dominated their last game.  But god forbid we give bloodhound a proper pulse blade!"
thegooddoctor,fef6fem,t1_fef38o1,1579049283.0,"Watching the episode now and I do think Shawn handled it poorly, as well as Lea saying they need to keep it between them, but my point had less to do with that part of the narrative and more to do with their overall relationship and how Lea and Carly have been differentiated.  I think Carly had weirdly unrealistic expectations and comparisons about who Shawn would share his intimate details and life with.  Taking it personally every time he does something with Lea only made Shawn less comfortable sharing with her."
thegooddoctor,fef38o1,t3_eooqnm,1579047133.0,"Good lord.  I haven't watched the episode yet, but this feels like one of those monogamous things that I as a more open person cannot stand.  What in the fuck is wrong with receiving intimacy and comfort from someone you're close with?  Why does that have to exclusively be something you can only get from your partner?  Why do people constantly compare themselves to people in their partner's life and get disappointed when they aren't #1 all the time on those lists?  That's setting yourself up to be hurt for no reason?  And why compare a moment of turmoil with your sexual intimacy?

I have tons of really close female friendships, and the people who don't accept that those women came before them don't do well in a relationship with me--but my partners who don't even mention it and couldn't care less LOVE my support group and understand that it's what makes me a better partner.  I don't always have to lean on my immediate partners for comfort and safety.  My partners don't need to be the best at everything.  The difference is I don't want to live with my friends, I don't want to start a family with my friends, I don't want to share finances with my friends, I don't want to have to hear about my friends' day every day.

I can understand if your partner is getting ALL of their needs met elsewhere, but expecting them to feel ashamed the one time they're vulnerable and need closeness is shitty, and I think a lot of real relationships end because of things like this.  I think it's especially shitty in this situation because Shawn has unique needs--and the safety nets he's built around him are essential.

Carly seems so patient and caring, but she can't recognize the woman he's living with is part of what makes him a good, autonomous partner?  In fact, I'd argue without Lea, Carly and Shawns relationship would be more institutional and she'd be more of his caretaker, and one could even argue that he'd be in a more vulnerable position and that she'd have to be even more strict about mixing caretaker and girlfriend roles.  As a disabled person myself, I'd be pretty goddamned annoyed if my girlfriend got mad that I talked to my friends or a PCA about our problems.

Say what you will about Lea, but she's been far better at making sure Shawn is doing what he wants to do, and is remaining autonomous in their friendship.  She's protected his independence more than anyone else, and I think if she and Shawn ever do have a relationship, she'd be the least likely to infantalize him and become his caretaker, and yet that's exactly what makes her the best support for Shawn during his relationship with Carly.  When my partner has a really good close male friendship, I look at him as my ally and someone I can trust to do what's in my partner's best interest.  I respect his position in her life and look to him for guidance, not competition."

apexlegends,fdhi78l,t1_fdhgrr7,1578423177.0,"But the only indication you have to call anyone by any gendered term is the clues they give you with their outside appearance.  You don't know people's actual biological gender, so why is it so hard for you to accept the one explicitly provided?  If it's a social construct, that's as far as you need to be concerned, anyway?

And I think a major problem in general about laws specifically is there's really no specific need to gender them.

Medicine has a problem with gendering disorders when this correlation is inherently illogical, as gender doesn't inform as much as it seems, and when it does the nuances are so deep and complex that the binary definitions of gender aren't helpful.  There should be far more of a bifurcation between medicine's understanding of chromosomes and social labels of gender.

And gender-names are just names.  If you're socially aware and are into genders, and you meet me, it's pretty clear I'm not a typical ""mans man.""  To me that's irrelevant, I don't mind being called he because it's just a silly label.  The problem is people like you trying to enforce those labels as if their association to biological gender is important in any context outside of an individual's biological needs--in which case their specific body and chromosomal makeup is more important than how it relates to other people's.

I don't know.  Call people what they tell you to call them and mind your own business.  A person with a mask and no distinct skeletal structure wants to be known as an everpresent adherent to a mythical force.  If you wanna use meta shit about their voiceactor to pick a gender, you might wonder if YOU'RE the one who's forcing things.

gaming,fdhgehq,t1_fdhab0e,1578422088.0,"Yeah, designing the P in the first place was what cost all that money.  Try flipping just any P and making a 5 out of it.  Try making a font at all even once.

I've done it once for way too little money and now I'd charge quadruple what I did then, just knowing the kind of work that goes into it.

What frustrates me is all of these ""I'd do it for $20"" is why when I design a proper logo for a company, they want to pay me chump change for what CAN be easy, but if it's done right is very painstaking.  Plus, if it is easy for someone, they spent years honing their abilities to be able to do it fast.  You pay for that.

Also, on some deep seated level gender is kind of irrelevant and socially constructed for some people, so it feels doubly wrong calling themselves trans because wanting to appear as a gender is kind of the opposite of the point, and to remain respectful to people who do want to appear as a certain gender, calling yourself trans seems kind of... messed up?"

I was in Chicago, trying to find the one government services building in the whole city.  It was smack dab in a neighborhood I was told by several people to avoid.  The area seemed alright to me, and I'd eaten at a Mexican place near here before.  I thought I had to cross under an overpass, so I went down this street that I thought was a regular block.  Instead, it was this corner street under the overpass that didn't cross it, and went right back to the main street instead.  There was a bunch of small houses with older folks, and all of the pavement seemed new, so I felt relatively at ease.  I figured I'd just keep going down it since it was headed in the direction I was going.

All of the sudden all of the hairs on the back of my neck stood up, and I felt really uncomfortable.  I was rolling in the middle of the street instead of the sidewalk (it was empty, and my wheelchair handles asphalt far better than sidewalks) but b-lined up into someone's driveway.  I turn around and see a truck driving slowly down the street, then suddenly a bunch of people sit up and point non-automatic weapons, like pistols and hunting rifles, at a house across the street from where I am, then speed off.

For some reason, even RIGHT after the event, I remember less of an orchestra of gunfire, and instead it all sounded like one big explosive bang.  A bunch of people came out of their houses.  It smelled like gunpowder and there was smoke still in the air.  A little old woman came out of her house and yelled ""I'm fine! I'm fine! No one is hurt.""  A woman came out of the house next to the driveway I'm in and starts talking to a woman on the front porch of the house of the driveway I'm hiding in, saying something about ""her son is in a gang.""  Then they saw me and asked if I was okay and I sort of tried to explain that I hid but couldn't quite articulate that I hid BEFORE they came.  I also remember feeling like I was way more disturbed and shocked by it than anyone else that came out of their house was.  And their concern was more for me than themselves, which was even stranger.  I was a young kid though, maybe 19?

It didn't feel real to me after it happened.  It was like someone showed me a tape of a re-enactment with toy cars.  I have no idea how I knew they were coming.  I want to believe I heard their tires squeal as they came down the street?  Or the relative silence was broken by the car coming up behind me?  Maybe I was just avoiding the street and didn't wanna get hit by a car?  I mean--I've had that feeling before when nothing bad was going on that I imagined was.

I just went to my government services appointment where there was a security guard and suddenly that part of town felt a lot less safe than it had before.  I never really experienced any violence like that otherwise, that was by far the worst--but it was mid-day, broad daylight."

He convinced 20 people to do this dangerous thing and me saying ""What if we didn't"" took away his power as a director.  Had I been able to pull him aside, or if he discussed his plans with me before the day of the shoot, he could've saved face and I could've made him feel like it was his idea, which became the technique a younger me learned to get him to do things.  He would later basically leave the company in my charge and he was more of a worker, handling technology deployment and letting me manage the crew and speak with our clients, as he wasn't very good at seeing anyone's vision but his own--and he slowly recognized that."
