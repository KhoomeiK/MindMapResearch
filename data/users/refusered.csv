I'm moderately down on eye-tracking - it's a lot of cost for not much benefit as far as I can see. But yeah, if you have it, might as well use it.

WindowsMR,fc3jdvk,t1_fc3i2nx,1577391099.0,"The resolution is like that with WMR headsets in SteamVR. I think it has to do with how Microsoft setup their software and the plugin they made for SteamVR.

The quote I pasted has a link to a DisplayPort to HDMI adapter that is said to work to get 90Hz running. I donâ€™t know if you want to spend the money or do a return on the headset or what, but if keeping the headset you should ask the sub for recommendations on adapters. As far as the 470 idk how well it would workout for you."

i did a quick search and saw:

>""We root caused the issue. This generation of AMD cards doesn't support HDMI 2.0. When the display on the headset is trying to step down, it hits a compatibility issue. The solution was indeed to use a display port to HDMI adapter. This is our recommendation: http://www.club-3d.com/en/detail/2366/displayport_1.2_to_hdmi_2.0_uhd_active_adapter/

do you have hdmi 2.0?"
