I actually like all the dropped plot lines because I get to fill in the blanks with whatever I want."
magictavern,fgm2kdn,t3_ez5ebh,1580916710.0,I assumed it was robot Arnie.
magictavern,fgkqq7k,t1_fgh2fan,1580871508.0,This premise is fabulous.
freefolk,fgewaa6,t1_fgehiqu,1580712476.0,I'm not a football fan but that games ending was 1000x better than season 8.

AskReddit,fgdpkc7,t1_fgaqgd7,1580685102.0,"I just heard a story somewhere about how a woman survived being captured and horrifically tortured by imagining a different reality during her imprisonment. 

I'm not saying retail is horrific torture, but I'm also not NOT saying that either."

witcher,fgbnen4,t1_fgbkysg,1580663976.0,Oh my God. It's me. I've been Henry this whole time.
AmItheAsshole,fgbmrv2,t1_fga726l,1580663856.0,Can we get the mods to make YAA a sub rating? There have been plenty of times I would love to add NTA and even some YTA with a YAA sub rating.

magictavern,fg41ihy,t3_ew6ss9,1580494198.0,God I HATE Stiticher.  I signed up awhile ago and am loving everything the boys are producing but the UX of Stiticher is just terrible. I hope they move it all behind a different paywall soon.

books,ffv9ul8,t1_ffv9ilu,1580259108.0,"But it all depends on what the subject matter was. What if the novel was a confession about his cheating scandal? This is a terrible example (sort of...adultery is a common theme Cohelo explores in his novels) but it would be horrible to continue working on something like that without Kobe's blessing or input. I still say whatever it was, I trust Cohelo made the right call."
books,ffujspz,t1_ffu83j4,1580243447.0,"Yeah, I think this is important. We have no idea what stage the book was in and it might not make any sense whatsoever without him. And if anyone knows anything about or deeply respects the Personal Legend of something, it's Coehlo."

advertising,ff1obdp,t1_ff1lwj8,1579482552.0,This. I did a toxic stint at one place and only lasted a year and a half.
advertising,ff1o7hi,t3_er4a7q,1579482486.0,I've spent my entire career in house. I recommend it as the pace is much better. The project work isn't always as splashy as what the agencies do but the work/life balance on the corporate side is much better. Just find the right corporate atmosphere and it can be a really good gig.
