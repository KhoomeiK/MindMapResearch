MensRights,ffdzdlj,t3_et0e33,1579832722.0,"I liked that situation when I was young, They all bought 'fixer-up' starter houses and were quickly over their head on repair/remodel. I got passed around like the town slut. As soon as one gave me up, a better one was waiting in line. Trivial easy work for me and they couldn't be more appreciative & grateful.

Frugal,ffdgjy9,t1_ffbuvsb,1579820407.0,"Long story I'll try to make shorter.

I like solving real world logic problems. I like figuring out complex interlocking faults/failures. It's frustrating, entertaining, educational, and satisfying. It's like video games, but super realistic 3D.

Not many of those problems in my life so I've always been alert for other people having interesting problems. I get permission to work on it and revive their dead car, sunk boat, crashed system, or whatever. I don't charge for it since I get as much satisfaction out of it as they do.

I pursue knowledge and skills as a tool for solving problems.

To answer your question:

1st off, money continually accumulates because earnings go unspent. My vehicles, housing, and entertainment are low cost, free, or actually profitable because I 'spin gold out of flax'. People like having me around and give me derelict things to revive/rebuild/restore. The longer I own something, the better it gets and more it's worth.

2nd, successful people value problem solvers and guide you to where you'll be useful. Those often pay well long-term.

3rd, while most things I fix are just passing through and have no affect on my net worth, a few are worth thousands (cars/boat/airplane), and some are worth hundreds of thousands (houses). One was over a million.

4th, a few people aren't satisfied at my refusing payment and find other ways of balancing it out. I get written into wills. I don't like this because I don't need the money and didn't agree to spend months cleaning up their properties &  legal work, and deciding how my proceeds get distributed to their descendants. And then I got stuck with another will from one of those descendants. Solved that problem by only giving estate proceeds to younger generations. I usually pick through & keep any mechanics tools better than mine. One will didn't have any poor descendants so I kept 1/4 of that one ($500K) and rest went to well-off descendants. There's still another will out there worth over a million. I'm hoping he outlives me.

In summation:

If I actually wanted to make serious money, I'd do my life differently. I don't want more money and I like my life the way I'm doing it.

I'm a polymath. I became one because I like pursuing knowledge and skills. If you don't like doing that, it would be a horrific amount of work for low or late-in-life pay.

I still recommend frugality, DIY, and future-oriented attitude as the surest path to a good life. You don't need to take it as far as I do."

Should clarify I'm a boomer and describing small town life in 1950-70.

Our parents went through the Great Depression and knew how to live comfortably without spending money. Grew and harvested their own food from kitchen gardens, home orchards, chicken houses, bee hives, food exchanges, hunting & fishing. People cooked & baked what they ate. No microwave meals.

Deer season was when working people filled their freezers with venison for the winter. They'd have an old-fashioned refrigerator on back porch (the type with ice compartment in with rest of frig). It was only run in the winter (when it was cold outside anyway) and easily freeze meat solid.

Frugal,ff84u4o,t3_es4gy7,1579666024.0,"Told all this before. Started adult life with no money, no job, no employable skills, no contacts, no mentor, no clue.

Using frugality and DIY I deliberately worked on making my immediate future better. When you persist at something, it happens. As my immediate future got better I reached farther into future for things to improve. I'd fail & fail and eventually succeed. And then need a new higher/further goal.

And so it went from homeless day laborer, to slum resident minimum-wage earner, to cheap apartment full-time laborer, to duplex resident office worker, to shared-house tech worker, to estate-owning system designer, to early retirement age 47, to higher prosperity.

Here's the tell... through 30 years and over a dozen jobs & careers, I was off work as often as employed. I spent so little money that I could take months/years off to pursue my own projects and interests. I worked in total about 15 years paid employment. My serious income came from non-paid activities for my own satisfaction. Airplane, cruising sailboat, race car, year-long world travel, early retirement... all happened while wandering through life with frugality & DIY.

Frugality & money, physical endurance & agility, DIY knowledge & skills are TOOLS. Making tomorrow better is your real job in life. You can do it slow and lazy as I do, but so long as you keep improving your tools and working on tomorrow your life will get continually better on its own.

Defense against siege would be thick walls with battlements and machilocation for a few full-time defenders with ample provisions. Battle of attrition would be for short-term occupation by native field army.

funny,fdj7c8e,t3_elge3v,1578460502.0,"That's not how you're supposed to do it.

Correct way is quick sweep in early spring when weed shoots are just starting to come up. And you don't burn them, you singe them. The idea is to cripple the growing tip without harming the stem. If weed seed root thinks the tip is still growing, it continues sending up stored nutrients. When nutrients are used up, the weed dies to the root.

If you burn the stem down, the seed root knows to send up a fresh new sprout. You haven't killed it."

I'm not used to doing my own dish aiming, HVAC repairs, cabling, wiring, plumbing, and appliance repairs but if want it done properly I need to do it myself.

I've found it best to let them do their work, and rebuild it properly after they're gone. Doesn't do you any good to get a bad reputation with local techs.

Then there's the local crooks... I've encountered 3 different service companies/techs that deliberately sabotage to get work. Some fairly subtle that few would catch. Encountered a crude one at friend's place recently. On a 'free home inspection', the tech disabled it by disconnected start-time capacitor on HVAC blower motor and then listed a bunch of improbable problems. I found & fixed 3 actual problems with their system, none of which were listed by 'professional' tech."
