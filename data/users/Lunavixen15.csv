Starting with small changes has worked way better for me than just dumping off whole sections of food. I've found for discretionary snacks (like chips or biscuits/cookies) swapping to the little kids snack packs has worked well for me because it lets me set a limit way better than having a big box. Cutting discretionary food out completely caused me to binge, so having the small allowances like this works better for me, but does slow my progress with weight loss.

Portion control is critical, especially if lots of exercise isn't doable either time wise or (in my case) health wise. One thing I found works is either using a set size container if you bulk cook like I do, and/or using a smaller plate. When I bulk cook meals, I try and veggie load my meals, because you can eat a lot more veggies for the same calories than you can with pasta.
