I think it's hard for people to understand normalizing shitty behaviors, even if you're the one getting screwed over for it. It wasn't until college that I realized my sister's boyfriend was a creep and borderline assaulted me. Looking back now I don't understand why I didn't confront that behavior, why I kept telling myself everything was fine, that it was to be expected. So if I can normalize bad things happening to me, then it's probably pretty easy for me to fall into normalizing doing bad things to others.

There's so many awful things I went through in high school and didn't realize were not normal everywhere.

Imagine if 50% of the population had an extra arm, but none of our furniture or tools accommodated that arm, and those unlucky enough to be born with one were put at risk because engineers designed cars for those with only two arms. It doesn't mean that as a man you cannot suffer the same risk, but it does mean that if you're a woman you're almost 50% more likely to get injured in a crash. Part of it is just women being shorter, but if that many people are at risk because of their height, why aren't we designing cars for a lower height?"
