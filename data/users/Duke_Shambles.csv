sffpc,fcxzqzd,t1_fcxwldm,1578072720.0,"just having a ram waterblock for show is a bad idea, because it will actually impede airflow and result in poor cooling. If it's not in the loop don't do it. Just get some fancy looking RAM instead or put some nice heatsinks on what you have, you probably won't even need an extra fan at 1.35v."
sffpc,fcxvi8u,t1_fcxrzm6,1578071101.0,"in a SFF build with limited rad space I probably wouldn't want to but there are occasions where it makes sense. B-Die can be run at really high voltages for overclocking which in turn produces quite a bit of heat. It gets very unstable above about 50C though. So if you want to run 1.5v-2.0v on your B-Die, yeah watercooling makes sense, especially if you don't have great airflow inside your case."

If you are serious about the program and getting sober you will be invited to closer social circles where you can feel some trust. The whole thing about sponsors isn't about having a personal therapist, because that's not what a sponsor is. It's partly about having an experienced sober alcoholic/addict to guide you to the right people and groups so you don't have to worry about that bullshit."

I've never met an addict, including myself, that led a saintly life.

punk,fcjfrah,t3_ehb4hb,1577685970.0,"That's a big set of questions. Punk is not an identity that most or your fellow inmates are going to recognize. Prison is a big reason that Nazi punks exist. If you are white, you either need to stick up for yourself and hold your own and stand for your beliefs or you need to jump in with a 'gang.' Prison is a place where the weak are taken advantage of. If you show that you're willing to fight for what's yours, you will be left alone until you can find a group of folks that you can stomach being around. Stay out of the real gangs if you can help it. You might not be able to safely. Normally for the guys that can hold their own, even in the hardest compounds, you might just be asked not associate with certain groups by the gang you 'fit' with. It's best not to challenge them. It's not like the government or civil society telling you how it is, those groups will have you beaten down or worse for fucking with them. But they will leave you alone if you don't fuck with the order they have imposed. Don't do favors for anyone. Everything has a price. You are no longer a 'good guy' or someone that can be trusted and neither is anyone else. That said, the only thing you have is your word. Don't make threats you won't follow through on. Don't act bigger than you are. Don't trust anyone. Speak softly but with purpose. Have respect for people. Prison is not the place to be a non-conformist. Once you start settling in and getting comfortable, kick your self and realize that's the most dangerous thing you can do. never stop watching your back, never trust anyone."
