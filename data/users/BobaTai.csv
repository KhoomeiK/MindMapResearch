Chipotle,fepnbvn,t1_fepm96t,1579325112.0,That’s usually a hiring preference. They said you can’t date a manager though. If you so you have to tell your DM but I took my sister to her interview and her new manager told me to apply as well.

Chipotle,fep9rv8,t1_feom6x2,1579315332.0,I used to be a manager at a qdoba and I had an orientation with chipotle before but something happened and I couldn’t start work. I don’t every start at crew level there’s almost nothing in fast food I haven’t really done . But I understand where you’re coming from at my current job we’re training managers and they all come from outside the store and I and everyone else can’t stand them.
Chipotle,fep9lx7,t1_fep975v,1579315223.0,"That doesn’t makes sense there’s always a different title wherever you work. Captain, team lead, shift supervisor, assistant manager, and I know at chipotle from an orientation I had they have a different title. Either way, I don’t usually get turned down from jobs my resume speaks for itself I just needed a good asking number."
AskReddit,femz8sd,t3_eptxb3,1579273370.0,My uncle moved to and died in Oregon (we’re from Delaware) he moved out there and lied to my grandmother about him being a medical student and nurse and always sent her photos but he was actually homeless and suffering from bipolar disorder he house sat for a very wealthy friend (he died in his house) and his body was so badly decomposed no one could ID him except for his friend ... by his Penis (I still don’t understand this) my mother also told me that the reason why he moved was due to my aunt suffocating him while they all lived together and making him feel unwanted and a bother to his mother (why I also moved out this year)

I literally have no friends and no family besides my boyfriend (who lives away for work) and my mom. I’m supposed to be happy with myself but I’ve never been lonelier in my life. One thing I realized is that some people don’t want you to be happy no matter how close you were with them which might have been the hardest part of my journey.

depression,fdzi2el,t3_eng2wb,1578790416.0,"I’m going to start with a story. 

When I was 15 I met my boyfriend I was extremely depressed and planned to kill myself on my 16th birthday. He saved my life he showed my love he was my rock and the source of my happiness. We eventually started drifting apart and I was more depressed than ever and blamed it on him but it wasn’t his fault. My mental illness isn’t his burden to bare when I started feeling better I should’ve branched out more. Took the opportunity to find more friends and more interests outside of him. 

The point is and my suggestion for you is to not lose contact with him but he’s not your only option either. If you don’t want to leave the house you can find hobbies, gaming, puzzles, card magic, cooking, focusing on studying. You can find people around you who will be open to you as well HE may be your best friend but he doesn’t have to be your only friend or your end game. 

One thing that helped me was a large group chat I had on discord and snapchat with a few friend and people in a community I was in it was a very inclusive feeling full of laughter some occasional drama 🤷‍♀️ but nothing’s perfect. 

I’m rooting for you. If you ever need to talk or just wanna day what’s up. I’m Pm is always open."

I’m ironically in a similar situation and I completely know what you’re feeling the answer is still know you don’t accept that. A true friend, someone you want in your life would’ve tried to spread that positivity with you instead of shunning you or not accepting you. I can feel your personality in this post and in how you wrote it, you’re not a problem you seem quite lovely in fact. He’s an asshole and he treated you poorly and you don’t deserve to put up with that. You can forgive and keep it cordial and I think it would help you to heal. But that’s not your friend dude.. and it’s okay to still care about him and your moments with him. I still wish you the best. I hope you’re easier on yourself in the future as well."
