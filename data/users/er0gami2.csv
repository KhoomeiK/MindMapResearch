Guildwars2,fgjpix2,t3_eyho4b,1580848841.0,"Going to say this because I think it fits in very well here.

I pug 100CM almost every day.. generally I run alac/bs/dps depending on what the group needs. In the Arkk fight, almost every single day I see this argument.

Alac: warrior, do anoms. This is exp group, that's your job.


Or

BS: Alac, do anoms. This is exp group, that's your job.

... to get to the point, if you are pugging, stop pretending there is some magic standard (that happens to be the one you are used to.. or the opposite of whatever class you are running because you don't want to do it) and calling other people ""newbs"". If someone asks ""Alac, doing anoms?"" (Or warrior..), the only acceptable answers are. ""Yes"" or ""can you please?"".


I use this as an example. I have seen this  garbage everywhere be it in fractals/raids/... where people think what they are used to is the right way and whoever doesn't do it their way is a nub.

iran,fdp00r1,t1_fdoy6rl,1578616777.0,"Before you get into justifying the assassination and why it may be a valid cause, I will need you to dig a bit more in history. What you will find is 1000 dead Iranians because of US actions for every 1 dead American dead because of Iran's actions... going back to the coup in the 50s, to the backing of Saddam as he was dropping chemical weapons on Iranian civilians... chocking the country with sanctions and embargoes for the last 40 years... 

If you want to get into justification of threats to your country, you have absolutely no leg to stand on in this discussion.

All that said, you asked how an Iranian would view this and I answered this to the best of my ability.

I am sure I don't represent all Iranians... I can't even claim to represent Iranians in Iran since I have now lived 2/3 of my life in Canada. I was a child when I came to North America and I am as ""integrated"" as one can get.

With all of that said, the only thing thing I find less acceptable than those cockroaches continuing to rule in Iran is another country interfering and thinking they have any right whatsoever to attack it.

If this is how pissed off/offended/worried I am, I think I can safely believe my feelings are multiplied 10-fold for someone living there."
iran,fdoww4g,t1_fdnh4rk,1578614728.0,"Depends which garbage media's stories you are believing. Ones reporting he was there to coordinate attacks? (Trump administrations' claim for which 0 proof has been provided to even satisfy members of the US government) or ones  claiming he was there to discuss cooling off tensions between Iran and the Saudis with Iraq as the mediating party (what Iraq says he was doing there since you brought up harming Iraq).

For you as an American, I think had this situation occured as I presented in my hypothetical.. I think whatever the reason was would not change how you feel about the situation one bit. In case he was there to plan attacks against China, it would still be your home under attack for decisions of some dirty politicians that you probably hate with a passion."
iran,fdng4ie,t3_em2kta,1578585081.0,"I will pose a hypothetical situation to you to hopefully help you understand.

I think it's safe to say a lot of Americans (probably the majority) are currently unhappy with Trump. Now say tomorrow, China attacks a US General's convoy while he is on business in Canada... then their  president goes on TV and says if you dare retaliate , they will bomb the Statue of Liberty, and 51 other important historically significant places in your country... and if you retaliate again  they will start bombing your country until all your problems are solved and you are ""free"".
