saltierthancrait,ffhd5nr,t1_ffhbfjj,1579930515.0,"I don't get why the kid didn't show Finn and Rose his powers either. He obviously knew he had the force, and he could control it. He could have used it as a free ticket off that place by telling them, ""Yeah, I have the force,"" and showing them the force."
saltierthancrait,ffhcsqy,t1_ffh8hvj,1579930156.0,"Yeah, that's a good point. I haven't seen Episode 6 in a while, so I must have forgotten about that.

Maybe his portrayal is one of those things that could have been done very well but ended up being something that retcons past meaning or is unnaturally forced. Perhaps if he had grown too weak to defend against some evil like the Yuuzhan Vong or something else outside of the Sith, it could have worked, right?  It could have made sense, it could have respected everything that came before it, and it could have been a message of passing on the torch - a message everyone can understand.

It's just, that, we didn't get it; we did not get something that respected the past, that gave us something new, nor something that made sense."
saltierthancrait,ffh7vje,t1_ffh7jal,1579925610.0,"Honestly, that was the only part of the movie I felt was genuine, and I still feel that way.

Seeing him dip into the Dark Side, watching as he destroys what he had built due to a vision created by evil, and then suffering from regret and shame. It felt like Star Wars. Hell, even George Lucas' original idea for his ST had Luke hidden from the galaxy, ashamed of his past, until Rey's original incarnation helped him let go of the past to focus on a brighter future.

That was the only thing done right. Of course, though, they ruined the pure dread of seeing a hero in exile by creating the HILARIOUS scenes of him tossing his lightsaber behind his back, and drinking milk out of an alien."
saltierthancrait,ffh7fy9,t1_ffh7b13,1579925245.0,"Yeah. Now that this trilogy is over, and nothing good happened, I don't like those movies except for some scenes."
saltierthancrait,ffh7bnb,t1_ffh77pl,1579925143.0,"mmm yes

I can't wait for 'Temiri Blagg - A Star Wars Story.'"

TIHI,ffgv9tb,t1_ffgoot8,1579915944.0,"It's probably poking fun at Whitney Wisconsin or whatever that dog-fucker's name is. The only reason I think this is because the sperm wants to be a police dog, which are generally german shepards, and she has/had a pet german shepherd."
