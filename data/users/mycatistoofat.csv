sydney,ffg68ja,t1_fffs7kx,1579899340.0,"Don’t be sorry! On the plus side, you’re really good at self-analysis and they do say that the first step to solve a problem is to state the problem. Another plus is that you haven’t tried a different country yet and you never know, in the future you might have the resources to do that. I realise I’m doing the very thing you’re not supposed to do - try to offer solutions ! So just want you to know I hear you and acknowledge your pain. I’m quite poor and am trying to come up with creative solutions as to how I can buy a Tiny House and find land to put it on, the alternative being to live in a small mini bus for a while. It will be a big scary challenge so my life has pointy bits in it too like most people’s lives."

sydney,fffplgl,t1_ffelz2l,1579889039.0,"You’d be surprised by how much a move to somewhere else can change that around. 

I love NZ but was never happy there, thought it was me but moved to Sydney and found my peeps and with that a change occurred within me. 

We are very shaped by our environment so might be worthwhile you thinking about somewhere else to live and starting to plan for that and trying a few different places before you find your mojo."

whatisthisthing,ffcyzv7,t1_ffcfxy0,1579810174.0,But neither of those explain why they are different sizes or have grips on the end to grip the surface. Legs for holding something is more likely. Ask your Mum if she bought something that came with legs to grip a surface.

australia,few54ws,t1_few4b58,1579405531.0,"Calm down. it’s not talking about small rodents. All links to correct methods of feeding wildlife are good, like the links you have supplied. Who cares if it’s old person’s fb from mythical Pete as long as people realize there are proper guielines for feeding them instead of feeding them peanut butter, like the videos of that woman making the balls is doing. the Taronga zoo guidelines are not coming out until next week."

australia,feiv2cs,t1_feit12u,1579147993.0,"I dont think they were hanging around from what I could see of them getting into their car. When the sky is dark, smokey, and the wind gusting the trees around you, you don’t want to stay on a tree-lined country road with pets and children and leaping kangaroos. We could still get north and south, its just that GV is the quickest way to get to the highway."
australia,feiu4ym,t1_feirjgr,1579147276.0,"We had already evacuated twice, I guess it was a bit of ‘well nothing came up the last 2 times’, and wasn’t looking forward to either staying in evac center with my pets again or driving up to Sydney. Also at the village bushfire meeting that day to a packed village hall, the RFS said ‘not really expecting it to hit Bundanoon’ but we could see the cloud was even bigger than the first time and had already experienced the southerly coming through in literally minutes the first time , one minute we were looking at this huge cloud in the valley and the next minute it was as if someone had turned the cloud like a tap and we were enveloped in bushfire smoke, the sky turned orange then red, and people were actually running to get in their cars. We were thinking if this is how fast the smoke is coming, is this how fast the fire is coming? Still, didn’t learn from that...

Next time I’ll understand that:

1. No one packs a ‘bushfire bag’, everyone packs their car to the ceiling with stuff - so pack days before you need to, not on the day!
2. You can’t keep an eye on the fire, follow all 3 fire apps, check the village Facebook, listen to the RFS scanner, find out where the cat is hiding, and pack your car all at the same time, something has to give
3. You can have a clear run out until you hit that one spot that prevents you going further, either fire/trees/traffic so you misjudge your own safety
4. It might be boring/tiresome/hard work if you have horses/livestock to evacuate but it makes the firies job so much easier and best to go early when you can think clearly. 
5. Next time I will go when the alert is yellow and stay in distant but local area so i can come back quickly if I need to. If a wind change direction is predicted to come towards me, I won’t wait to see what happens!"
australia,feis20x,t1_feirjet,1579145758.0,"Golden Vale is basically a long country road lined with ghost gums. Given how fast the fire was moving, ember attack probably. You wouldn’t want to be anywhere near those trees. But it eventually leads to the Hume highway. Same with Penrose Rd that my house is off, the ghost gums are a canopy over the road there, even more dangerous than Golden Vale so I wasn’t going to leave in the other direction."
australia,feie1y9,t1_fei81di,1579136338.0,"My neighbours and I all evacuated from Bundanoon when the Morton Fire suddenly raced up the valley, it was a red emergency alert and it stated it was too late to leave. The first thing we found was our exit on Golden Vale Rd blocked by the police. We all screeched around in a u-turn and you could just see the panic from everyone’s speed. We’re lucky there wasn’t a back-end accident right there. Half of us then split for Goulburn and the other half for Sydney via Moss Vale. We waited that long to leave because we were waiting “to see what the fire would do.”

Yes, thank you, I am pretty stupid."

aww,fe3zqs9,t3_enlafg,1578854414.0,Moving. Unfortunately Koalas can die if they drink from a bottle as it can get into their lungs and drown them. There was a koala recently that died from drowning/pneumonia and would otherwise have recovered as their burns weren’t that bad. The rescue centre put out a poster asking that people only put water in a bowl (like this guy was trying to do).

sydney,fc5wzdr,t3_ega9t7,1577467653.0,"I live in a small white village in regional Australia. Poor, white uneducated people are racist here, especially on old people’s Facebook. I think there’s at least 2 reasons: a) there’s not a large group of non-whites, so if they see or experience a negative or even neutral event in which a non-white is involved, then they immediately assume that to be the case for all non-whites. b) they’re usually white males with fragile egos who know they’re not high up the ladder in life and need to make themselves feel better by pushing others down. 
Funnily, I was asking some Indian colleagues if they’d experienced racism, and we got talking about Indian culture and it sounded like Indian culture was even more racist (caste system)!"

If anything, houses should be made of quick, light materials that can be rebuilt quickly and easily after natural disasters."
