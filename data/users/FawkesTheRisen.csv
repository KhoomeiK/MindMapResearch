nextfuckinglevel,ff34tjk,t1_ff2yeb1,1579533692.0,You’re absolutely right.

interestingasfuck,fev6phv,t3_eqivnw,1579393745.0,Could climb it in less than a second if you speed the video up even more. And we know bears can climb. So...
interestingasfuck,fev6drq,t1_fesmobr,1579393598.0,Because they can climb?
oddlysatisfying,feuy9ms,t3_eqaycc,1579391113.0,Gotta be something else with it. Ice doesn’t work like that. If it did it’d be posted to death on this sub.
educationalgifs,fesxm92,t1_fep795j,1579369970.0,It landed on the snake’s head. Probably didn’t realize it was a snake and that it had just landed on a loose rock or something. Poor guy.
mildlyinteresting,fel9awj,t1_fel8chi,1579216870.0,Touché.
mildlyinteresting,feklmil,t1_fekl73o,1579202606.0,Right. Seems like anyone could just walk up and take it or turn it off and then listen. I guess maybe the therapist would be able to hear it turn off? I’ve never heard one of these in person.
nextfuckinglevel,feh8k5q,t3_ep410c,1579111371.0,Causally walking dogs during a thunderstorm?

Overwatch,fdkvskm,t1_fdk6abp,1578512184.0,Hey man...I understand what you mean. He just assumed ball would try to come back to point but he didn’t. If not for vision rein would have charged into nothing and looked silly.
lifehacks,fdkuz72,t1_fdkoeb2,1578511702.0,That is a good point tho
lifehacks,fdkeurs,t3_eltysm,1578502379.0,Does no one realize some dryers come with a cool/heat switch?
WatchPeopleDieInside,fdebex1,t3_ekuj2v,1578335341.0,This probably the most hilarious video of a kinda douchey thing to do.
AnimalsBeingBros,fd68w3x,t1_fd4kb6s,1578187307.0,A ‘joke’ on the exploitation of industry workers in the late 1800s. Couldn’t find a better way to make the wording more satirical.
youseeingthisshit,fd4bgr8,t3_ejygif,1578166088.0,This is a reaction sub meant for seeing people react and figuratively say ‘you seeing this shit?’ to the camera/other people involved. Not for you the OP to ask us the viewer ‘you seeing this shit?’. Thank you that is all.
AnimalsBeingBros,fd3nwxv,t3_ejvegm,1578160126.0,until his death...one month later.

educationalgifs,fcsl86x,t3_eiijll,1577918878.0,It’d be cool to see an infrared video illustrating this.
nextfuckinglevel,fcqu0ie,t3_eihzxf,1577892183.0,But how high on a regular floor? And how many other people can jump that high on a spring floor?
educationalgifs,fcn2p8s,t3_ehz1si,1577801595.0,"One of those things where even though I am seeing it clearly, my brain still can’t fully process it unless I see it in person and am the one moving the square."
Overwatch,fcfvs79,t3_eh0edu,1577634216.0,Personal opinion it’s one of the worst ults in the game and you’re a really good widow apparently. You should have been able to shut him down. The fact that a high noon got a 4K with you on the enemy team with infrasight actually is kind of impressive.
nextfuckinglevel,fc6xetk,t3_egdcf4,1577491966.0,"It’s great, but it’s less reflexes and more anticipation, IMO. That’s how it is for me at least, if I were him my first thought would be ‘ok he’s mostly like to back up and fall off’ so I’m my mind that’s the contingency I’m anticipating."
lifehacks,fc6tpz5,t3_egcxyp,1577489252.0,Thank you!!!

Overwatch,fc6rw98,t3_ega5b0,1577487914.0,"“If you strike me down now, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.” 

Also it physically hurts me that you were able to get 4 kills but wasn’t able to get any ult gain. Hey there’s an idea. What if ult gained carried over into the next ult."
Overwatch,fc6rlzh,t1_fc59nw1,1577487705.0,👋🏻
Overwatch,fbz0knv,t3_eesi8k,1577231497.0,"Ok now I REALLY need Ana, Pharah, McCree and Zarya how much please?!"
Overwatch,fazdiua,t3_eanu8b,1576415024.0,What I don’t get is why did Orissa walk from behind cover and into LOS to drop a shield in the first place? Also instead of standing there you could have taken about 3 steps back and two steps to the side and been fine.
