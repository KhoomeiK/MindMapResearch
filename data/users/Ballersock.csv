Remember catalytic converters becoming mandatory, old man? What really stopped acid rain in its tracks, though, was the 1990 Clean Air Act that let the EPA regulate sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from power plants. 

Acid rain was a massive problem in cities like Los Angeles where the emissions were uncontrolled. Look it up. They literally had to cancel classes reasonably often because the air was too hazardous to breathe. (3 stages of smog alerts). What happens when it rains? It takes all those hazardous chemicals that burn your lungs out of the air and rains them down. It gets in the water, erodes roadways, etc. It still happens, but the chemicals being pumped into the air aren't nearly as bad, or in as vast of quantities, as they were in the 50s (though with relaxing regulations and more people, smog is starting to come back).

Cars are a necessary part of American society. Society could not function without motorized vehicles of some sort. Also, how many people use cars on a daily basis? This is why it's stupid to have a ""deaths from x per year vs deaths from y per year"". They should be over like denominators. Deaths per 100,000 uses, interactions, etc.

In 2016, the year with the highest motor vehicle crash fatalities since 2008, 37,806 people died ([Source: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration](https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812603)) 2016 was a leap year, so it had 366 days. 37,806 / 366 = **103 deaths per day. Compare that to the mass shooting deaths per year since 2009 (50) given below and your metric shows it's roughly every 12 hours, not 3.**

And if you look at the [fatalities per 100,000 people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_vehicle_fatality_rate_in_U.S._by_year), you'll see that vehicle deaths are trending downwards pretty heavily. (**2018 had 11.18 deaths per 100,000; 2006 had 14.27 per 100,000 and every year before it had 14+ per 100,000, excluding 1922 and before when cars weren't as ubiquitous as they are now**) 2017 had 1.16 fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles traveled, and the Fatalities per 100M VMT is trending downward heavily and has been since they have started collecting the data.

>More likely to die by lightning strike than in a mass shooting.

Since 2009 (year chosen due to the data already having been provided, used after a quick accuracy check), there have been 25 deaths per year, on average, from lightning strikes. ([Source: National Weather Service](https://www.weather.gov/safety/lightning-victims)). Over the same time period, there have been 50 mass shooting deaths per year (excluding gunman) ([Source: Time.com, updated August 7, 2019](https://time.com/4965022/deadliest-mass-shooting-us-history/)), and that's using the 3+ killed, excluding gunman definition, not the much broader 4+ injured, excluding gunman. **So, your claim about being more likely to die from a lightning strike is absolutely false unless you include much earlier stats in an attempt to conceal the fact that mass shootings are on the rise in the US.** We are no longer living in the 1990s, using relevant (i.e. modern) data is important when looking at these things.

>How about this stat. Every 3 months the police kill more people with guns than have died in mass shootings over the last 37 years combined! Every 4th day they have already killed more than will die in mass shootings per year.

Yes. Imagine how many of those wouldn't have died if they didn't have access to guns or if cops weren't so trigger happy due to there being a large risk that people are carrying a gun. I'm not sure how you think this argues against gun control, it's more Americans dying because they have access to guns. Just because it's not in a mass shooting doesn't mean it helps your point."

A large portion of rich people don't have to work at all, and can live off of a portion of what their money makes in a year. A large portion of rich people were born into wealth, never HAVING to work a day in their life (while some do work, it's never as something like a mechanic or construction worker. Gee, I wonder why. Because the work is hard and the pay is shit, they can just go jerk themselves off for 40 hours a week and make much more due to their family connections, so why wouldn't they?)

>You can't deny the fact that the world can only run properly when they are involved. Who's gonna employ people? Who's going to be as motivated to innovate things further?

The vast majority of rich people aren't Bill Gates, Elon Musk, or [Tim Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/11/trump-defends-his-tim-apple-comment.html). They aren't innovative. They work for holding companies, they run funds, they're in the finance industry, they own and rent land, etc. They provide little-to-no benefit to society (and in many cases, such as landlords, are a detriment to society). 

Lastly, you can have innovation, job creation, etc. without the insane amount of wealth consolidation we see. You can have profit and ethical, green business practices go hand-in-hand. You can just make more profit saying ""fuck the environment, fuck the poor, and fuck anybody who works for this company"", and that's what needs to stop. Incentives aren't working nearly as quickly as they need to be."

The lockers were assigned randomly. Being the complete shitshow the school was (she my [other comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/ellgp2/til_of_uk_student_jacob_ford_who_protested_his/fdkidgk/)), it was possible that you just didn't have time to use your locker before class at all. And of course, they tried to ban bookbags from being brought to class. The only saving grace was that all the classes had classroom and take-home copies of the books. But yeah, I still brought my bag to every class because I couldn't get to my locker, open it (the locks were fucked, often took 2-3 attempts to open), and get to class without being late."
todayilearned,fdkidgk,t1_fdjuea8,1578504441.0,"My school had 1,100+ students, 2 main hallways that were about 5-6 students wide and side hallways (where every single class was) that were 2-3 students wide. Traffic flowed both ways. Everything was laid out in a square with side hallways so that you were almost guaranteed to go through at least one intersection where you were guaranteed to have people coming from and going to all directions (people from bottom going left, right, and up; people from right going bottom, left, up; etc.)

We had 5 minutes between classes and lockers were in the same hallways people had to walk (unless you were lucky and got a locker outside the hallways, overlooking the cafeteria). It took literally 3-4 minutes just to walk halfway around the square, so if you came from the far end of a side hallway and had to go to another side hallway on the opposite end, you were guaranteed to be late some of the time due to no fault of your own.

I ended up getting suspended (out of school) over 30 times in one year because I refused to go to detention for being late to my class. I even videod myself walking one day (this is back when they would confiscate your phone on sight) and tried to show it to the teacher. Rather than watching the video, or saying ""see me after class"" or anything like that, she just tried to confiscate my phone by grabbing it while I was holding on to it. Naturally, I jerked it out of her hands because fuck you, you can't have my phone. I got suspended 5 days for refusing to give up my phone and ""assualting a teacher"". It's funny, you'd think if they had any evidence that I assaulted the teacher, they'd have pressed charges, but suspensions don't require any oversight."

1. It's a major hassle to carry around a coat everywhere. Invariably, inside will be so hot that I'll have to take the coat off and deal with it.

2. In the amount of time I have to walk, I can stave off the cold with normal body heat. If I had to stand still for 10+ minutes in the cold, I would have a coat. Walking from point A to point B is not a huge deal.

3. Cold isn't necessarily a bad thing. Most people think cold is a negative feeling, but until it's so cold that I have difficulty breathing due to shivering or am in physical pain due to the cold, I'm fine. Yes, I am ""cold"", but that's fine. It's not uncomfortable.

No, I'm not trying to be tough. If there's a strong breeze, I will probably have a coat. If not, I will be power walking between buildings, minimizing my time outside. As soon as I'm genuinely uncomfortable, and the discomfort outweighs the discomfort/annoyance of having to deal with a coat, I will wear a coat.

tl;dr: If the conditions call for me to wear a coat, I will wear a coat. If not, it stays in the car (in case I break down, etc. Don't want to get stranded without a coat)"
