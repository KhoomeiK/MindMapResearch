fatlogic,ff9kw7b,t3_esazin,1579715156.0,"I hate the whole ""Women shouldn't lift weights because they'll get big and muscular,"" because it's so stupid. It's not that easy to bulk up with muscle, if it was, more people would do it. Also, people (both men and women) who say that always make me feel judged for liking fitness. I've always wanted abs. 

But then I realize that lifting weights feels awesome and their opinions don't matter:)"

Feminism,fevaddr,t3_epubmg,1579395065.0,"I haven't specifically had that happen to me  but after coming out as bisexual and a feminist, I had a lot of people say things like ""It's because you had a bad experience with men, so now you hate men."" And I'm like ???  What???"
Feminism,fev9avw,t3_eqjgvd,1579394666.0,"Damn, that sucks, that doctor sounds like a dick... I have experienced similar things. I had a psychiatrist lecture me about how getting a boyfriend would help my anxiety. I said I didn't want one and that I thought it was wrong to date someone just to use them to ""fix"" anxiety. For some reason that pissed him off and he went off about how ""it's not normal for a girl your age to not want a boyfriend."" I was 16."
fatlogic,fesm6sw,t3_eqgo9g,1579366698.0,"Women's clothing sizes are pretty weird anyway, I have medium tshirts that fit me, I have small tshirts that fit me, I have extra small tshirts that fit me. And don't even get me started on bras! Ugh"
MadeMeSmile,fec3mkq,t3_eo73dn,1578966165.0,This made me a lil more emotional than it should
artcritique,fd9y6f2,t3_ek6paa,1578239454.0,"I love the colors you used! I'd say work on anatomy. Look up references of shoulders, neck, etc. It can help a lot to look at skeleton pictures. You can even try doing the pose yourself to see how it feels. I would also suggest practicing shading too, and just making the shading consistent so it's clear where the light source is. Easier said than done, but it helps to imagine the drawing as a 3d object. 
Really cute picture though!"
AskWomen,fd5mk5c,t3_ejvkej,1578179091.0,"I'd take them off for any kind of excercise, anytime I wear a long necklace (getting hit in the tit with a necklace sucks), any time I want to wear a tight tshirt without it feeling weird. I'd put them on anytime I wanna wear something fitted/styled in a way that looks weird without them."

DoesAnybodyElse,fcyyvau,t1_fcyyn1e,1578090127.0,"That's why I get so started and panicky when someone gets out a camera, I wish that it was customary to ask permission before taking someone's picture. At least so I can mentally prepare myself for the anxiety"

fatlogic,fc4wuyl,t3_eg5oao,1577431794.0,"WHY would you be upset at the comments, and not at the owner for letting their pet become overweight? I love my dog so much, I would never want her to have to suffer from any of the terrible health complications that can happen to obese animals. People who overfeed their pets so they can be ""chonky"" or whatever, are so fucking annoying."
