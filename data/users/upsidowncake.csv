blackcats,ff5t9j0,t3_erlpm9,1579609401.0,Cecil clearly adored you. What a soulful kitty. So sorry for your loss.
aww,ff5dmu0,t1_ff2muuy,1579588483.0,My heart just melted. Congrats on attracting such an amazing kitty. He found his people!
aww,ff5djri,t1_ff2cahq,1579588388.0,"I’ll be waiting! She’s such a funny little thing with crazy eyes, I like to joke that she hasn’t grown a soul yet. She’s still so young and frisky."
aww,ff5dgxy,t1_ff2anae,1579588304.0,"All good tips! This kitty wants to be around us and loves attention, but it’s the curling up in the lap and general cuddliness that I miss. But somehow this morning, as if on cue, she came up on the bed and snuggled me. It’s like she heard my soul crying. Sweet girl."
aww,ff29y55,t1_ff191r6,1579498194.0,"Was he always like this? How has your kitty evolved energetically and affection-wise since you adopted him? We adopted a young adult stray a few months ago, and she will not chill in our laps. It has happened, but only a handful of times since August. I trained her with treats to chill out when being held, but she will only stay in my arms if I'm standing. She's still a spazzy little dingaling. I accept my kitty for who she is, but remain hopeful that she'll come to enjoy laptime as she matures...maybe."
BenignExistence,fem7tcf,t1_fekkoam,1579242867.0,"I’m really excited about a weighted blanket now! How heavy is it, would you say? I currently sleep with a silk-filled duvet which is not lightweight like a down-filled one. It’s got some heft. I wonder how they compare. If yours has a link, I’d be interested in checking it out. And the do-over of your nighttime routine seems like a great call. On a good note, I can barely keep my eyes open and it’s 10:30. Hope I sleep through the night! Sleep tight!"
BenignExistence,fek1mmq,t1_fejtgce,1579190677.0,"Thanks very much. You’re so right, it’s a cycle that is hard to break. If you’re a ruminator, like me, its also no picnic. I’ll do everything I can to get a good nights rest tonight."
BenignExistence,fek1ffg,t1_fejwwyf,1579190551.0,"Thanks, OP. Must see about one of those. This level of anxiety is fairly new to me, so I’m open to suggestions. Trying not to go down the Ambien road if I can avoid it. Glad you got some sleep! I did get another two hours in. It’s a start!"
BenignExistence,fejlktr,t3_epdnfk,1579179012.0,Sounds absolutely dreamy! Happy for you.
BenignExistence,fejle3b,t3_epfb8h,1579178831.0,"Right there with you. Horrible anxiety is crushing me right now. Got about two hours and now I’m awake again. Doing square breathing didn’t help me tonight, but it may help you, OP."
agnostic,fehtc0e,t3_emoben,1579123462.0,"Your feelings are also deeply understood here. I was raised as a Catholic, church every Sunday, confirmation, the whole bit, but I started questioning around 13. My mom is steadfast in her faith and is also very chill. My whole family remains devoted and never in a holier-than-thou way. They just live their life, they pray and have faith that God knows what’s best for us, even if that means we suffer. 

I have a hard time reconciling the suffering in the world with the type of God that I was raised to believe in. Instead, I try to be content not knowing, and being interested in the human desire for religion to explain why the world is the way it is. But I can’t seem to make the leap to the faith my mother has. I wish I could have it, because my mother is so accepting and compassionate, and I believe her faith has a lot to do with that. But I’m curious and like to question. I still enjoy going to church with her now and then. I’ve toyed with the idea of making church a bigger part of my life, but it feels disingenuous because I’m not a true believer. But I like the way it feels to be in church. That’s especially funny because I definitely wasn’t my favorite thing growing up. Church was where I did my best daydreaming. The journey continues, I guess."
GriefSupport,fedbx12,t3_eoixvr,1579007044.0,"My heart goes out to you. Your memories of your mother will stay strong, though I empathize with you for wanting more. I’m just so sorry. It’s ok to hurt, and it’s ok to be gentle with yourself, too."
whatsthisplant,fdhlql5,t3_ekt1x8,1578425328.0,"Looks like a giant kale leaf to me, but I’m not a botanist. Just looks strikingly like the leaves of kale that my Portuguese family have grown for generations. Some might call them tree collards. I don’t claim to know the difference."
CasualConversation,fdhjm72,t1_fdf57nq,1578424038.0,"Aw, that’s nice. They will become so soft, if they’re not already."
CasualConversation,fdf0ds9,t1_fderhou,1578350475.0,It’s been 12 years since my dad passed and I still cherish and wear a particularly cozy sweater of his on cold nights.
CozyPlaces,fcodjmx,t3_ei826s,1577829609.0,East Bay in the house! Nice place.
curlyhair,fcod7pj,t3_ehup6q,1577829374.0,"Speaking as someone who grew up in the late 80s/90s, you are doing so much justice to this look! Keep it for sure."
blackcats,fc4sdlh,t3_efwmvz,1577426626.0,"My kitty has the same long & shiny black fur! In fact, I almost named her Glossy. She says hi to Nuit."
oakland,fbbk6pz,t1_fbb3aea,1576702160.0,"Shoot, yeah, I figured that info would be out of date. It was a long time ago, but so helpful back when."
