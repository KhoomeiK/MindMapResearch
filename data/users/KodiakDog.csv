Thetruthishere,ffiophg,t3_etlyv0,1579978935.0,"Thank you for sharing. Mama Aya definitely presented you this man for a purpose. Perhaps think of him less literally. I tend to believe the Divine uses symbols that only the beholder can decipher. Meaning, just because you saw a mangled slave doesn’t necessarily mean anything sinister (not that I got that vibe from your post), it is somehow worth your attention. Sounds like your doing all the right things. Stoked for you brother. Life is so much weirder than we can ever understand."
