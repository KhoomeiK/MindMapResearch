Even the attitude- Charlie Brown isn’t as pathetic of a sad sack in the original, Lucy isn’t as much of a bitch, Patty is just an everygirl, not the demented Sally or the spacey Peppermint Patty in the sequel. It’s gentle in a way that borders on bland, since constant repetition of the TV specials has made a louder, crazier version of the characters stick in our mind.

The revival also gave Schroeder a more defined personality as a prissy, snarky, somewhat effeminate drama queen, and really amps up Linus’s child prodigy qualifies beyond the other characters."

Heaven, on the other hand, is inconceivably great. It is the mind blown out like a TV tube, with all function rerouted to the pleasure center. Constant, endless, transcendent joy, with each moment topping the next and getting better and better and better. You're hardly sentient anymore- you don't think or feel or wonder, you just EXPERIENCE AND CONSUME THE LIGHT and it's fucking incredible. Basically, Cthulhu, but reversed. And there is no downside.

Heaven premium sounds terrifying and unwelcome, until you're there. That's the catch. It's not everything you could ever want, it's the one thing you could not conceive of wanting. And THAT is the only punishment in Mehven: everything there is so FUCKING GOOD, how could there be something better? But there is, and you don't get to have it- you don't even get to conceive of it.

It's not in my fancy and polished ""house style,"" but I may get to that sometime.

BIGGEST CHANGES: Cliff becomes a singing role again, and his bisexuality and polyamory/sex addiction are much more pronounced. Thanks to the inclusion of both 1998 and 2006 material, Bobby has become a secondary lead role. Nonce characters like Max, and the non-featured Kit Kats from 1966 and 2006, all appear. Notes are included for using the 2006 version's altered act break placement if desired, as otherwise Act 1 is very long and Act 2 is very short.

After the show was cancelled, they did a one-night-only concert version of Bombshell on Broadway, and it was a huge hit. So for half a decade now, the producers have been trying to write a working libretto for the story that makes the show and score work. The reason it's taking so long is that a big conceit of the score was Marilyn Monroe being played by two different actresses instead of one (for reasons that only made sense in the TV series). The big ballads would lose their punch without the two voices harmonizing."

From a mix of feminism and gay rights becoming mainstream, internet and social media integration into popular culture, and new ideas about masculinity and its relationships to women, the 2010s were the first decade where the female/queer gaze went mainstream. 

Men as pop cultural objects of desire were always generalized as either a teenybopper thing or a beefcake punchline before- I think of this in part as the Magic Mike effect.
