You are correct! There's a vast difference in quality and features from the shittiest car in existence to the fastest most luxurious car in existence. If cars are your thing, then by all means invest your time/money into it. 

However, that's not the point of this post. The post is measuring success based on what year in life a person purchases a Mercedes. If you never purchase a Mercedes does that make you unsuccessful? No. All we're saying is success should not be measured by which make/model vehicle you own."
GetMotivated,ff4ebkh,t1_ff46jm1,1579561579.0,"""I think the point is valid that one should not measure their success on their kind of car, as long as it works. ""

Exactly! Having a Mercedes does not make you any more successful than someone who has a Jeep, Toyota, BMW, Audi, Ford, etc. If cars are what you're interested then invest more in a car. If it's shoes, shirts, or a house then invest more into those things. It still applies that the brand of shoe/shirt or size of house still does not measure success.

People shouldn't feel bad for investing time/money into things that make them happy... But also people shouldn't feel like they're forced to purchase certain brands to fit into a very specific illusion of ""success""."
GetMotivated,ff3it9r,t1_ff3fd39,1579541950.0,"Oh for sure! But comfort isn't what the post was about - it was about measuring success. I agree with you though, if you have the financial means to invest in added comforts then by all means treat your self. After all, the majority of people spend a substantial amount of time in their car."
GetMotivated,ff3i0if,t1_ff3ep17,1579541459.0,"There's absolutely nothing wrong with investing more into a vehicle. The only point I was making is, success shouldn't be measured by what vehicle you drive. If cars make you happy then you should of course invest your time/money into that which you enjoy."
