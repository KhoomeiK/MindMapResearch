depression,fele6vt,t1_feldpkm,1579220080.0,"Thank you so much for your comment! I also feel this way about college, which is why I haven’t gone back yet. I would struggle as well, so thank you so much for saying this. You’re right, as long as I’m getting by I should be fine. I appreciate you so much."
depression,feldkuf,t3_eprttm,1579219671.0,"I had severe anxious nausea for YEARS after getting physically sick and having to drop out of high school! I know it might sound silly, but I chewed packs and packs and packs of peppermint orbit gum (specifically), and have recently started chewing the ice breakers kind. Peppermint helps your tummy, and it’s also soothing to have something else to focus on (chewing, having something in your mouth, etc). I hope that helps!"
depression,felcesa,t3_epmjuq,1579218892.0,I really like your technique. So surrealistic and interesting!! I would love to read a book with illustrations like this.
