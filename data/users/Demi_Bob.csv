Correct.  Plenty of people voted for Hillary because they found Bernie to be too radical or otherwise unelectable.  Also, that's not conversely.

DunderMifflin,fff9wmx,t1_fff4x9p,1579879283.0,"He can be selfish.  The whole athlead arch was him basically being selfish.

""... Well actually I did tell my wife about it, and we decided No.  But then I decided yes anyway.""

And getting mad at Pam for screwing up taping Cici's dance recital.  ""That moment is just gone forever."". Like, come on dude, that's what happens when you choose Stumpany over your family.  I know, I know, Stumpany was ""for the family"", but we all know it was actually for his ego cuz he saw how big Roy's house was.

I don't hate Jim or anything, but he's definitely not perfect, and certainly not as perfect as people make him out to be sometimes.

And a quick aside, why not just call Andy ""Drew""?  You drove him into anger management, you could at least be kind to the guy upon return."
