Dogtraining,fecq7rl,t3_eocw2y,1578980637.0,"You can teach most things at any age (tricks, leash walking, etc.), but socialization and bite inhibition is time sensitive, meaning you'll have to do it before 16 weeks and 6 months respectively or you'll have a difficult dog on your hands.

1. Start potty training.
2. Socialize as much as possible. If you have lots of Parvo in your area, you can carry the puppy with you. There are socialization checklists online that will include handling, sounds and surfaces, dogs and people, different environments, etc.
3. Teach the puppy it's name and start some early training, but don't stress out over this. You have all the time in the world to get an obedient dog. The most important thing is to teach your puppy what training is and get them to like it.
4. Bite inhibition is easy when puppies are about 8-12 weeks. Just yelp and disengage if the bite actually hurts. Later there might be a period when your puppy bites and bites and bites and that really sucks. Gradually you should start reacting to lighter bites, nips and mouthing. By 6 months there should be no biting or mouthing behavior. Playing with other puppies as well as well socialized adult dogs is also really important to develop bite inhibition and good manners. [Here's a good resource on bite inhibition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=068K5Zlph9U)

Kikopupu has a YT-video on the pro's and con's of crates [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tFu4G9YNE0). If you're gonna be home for six weeks you don't need a crate for successful potty training (also, check your local laws, crating is not permitted everywhere). A play pen or a puppy proofed room would be more appropriate, when the puppy eats, sleeps and plays in that area they will not want to potty there, even if it is bigger than a crate.

Best of luck with your new puppy!"

There might be some under-reporting, I agree, but what evidence is there that DCM is so severely under-reported that we cannot use the numbers available to get an idea of how common it is?

You are saying exactly what I was trying to say, that WSAVA is only for manufactured foods. It also tends to protect certain large manufacturers, not intentionally of course, but still.

There is probably never going to be much scientific data supporting a non-commercial canine diet, who would pay for such a study? If we're lucky some commercial raw food manufacturer will grow large enough to have the means to pay for research on their specific formula. The closest to any ""evidence"" I've come is to ask the owners of high performing dogs (hunting dogs and sled dogs) what they feed their dogs. There's a lot of real meat in these dogs' diets, and it's not a fad but rather what dogs like this have always eaten. Judging by their health, performance and life span it's not a terrible diet."

dogs,fe9jgcp,t1_fe8du0c,1578938167.0,"Sorry for messing up the links, where you able to gather any information? If you're interested in information for some other breed I'd be happy to look it up for you. The brands of dog food popular in Finland are comparable to what is sold in the rest of Western Europe. There might be some differences with regards to North American dog food as you have more soy and corn as well as other industry standards for meat production.
You're right, the English term grain includes corn and rice! In my native language we use a similar term but it refers only to wheat, barley, etc. so that is why I got these mixed up. My bad!
My beef with WSAVA is not that it shows which brands of ready-made dog food meet certain criteria. I agree it's a valuable tool in that way. Rather it's the fact that a non-commercial diet like home cooked or raw food cannot realistically meet WSAVA guidelines. With WSAVA it's kinda built into the system that the food needs to be made by a large company that sells a fairly to extremely processed product.
I wold not feed my child exclusively on ready-made baby food, even though that food meets a very high standard of production. Dogs have different metabolism and nutritional needs than humans, yes, but for me being able to feed my dog a varied diet with fresh foods is something I really value and I do not believe a well constructed diet that you make yourself is worse than feeding even the best commercial dog food."

dogs,fe6hadi,t3_enw4zb,1578890871.0,"Hounds are generally good with other dogs, but I like that you are being careful about this. One way of introducing dogs is walking them together. You can walk with one dog in front of the other (at some distance) or beside each other but not too close. Walking like this is less confrontational and builds a ""pack"" feeling between the two dogs.

Gradually you can move a little closer, but don't do any greetings on leash. When you feel the dogs are ready to greet (calm and relaxed), let them loose in a large, fenced in area with no toys, food, sticks or other things that could cause a fight.

A friendly female dog of the same size would be suitable for him to get to know first.

dogs,fe6g1qc,t3_enwp6d,1578889800.0,"She is probably barking to entertain herself, distraction and enrichment will help.

Give her things to chew and make her food as difficult as possible to eat. You could stuff it into a Kong that you freeze and hang from a tree, for example. Or put kibble in those balls that the dog rolls around to get the kibble out. Throw away her food bowl. Dogs cannot bark while they chew or eat.

Hide things that she can look (and dig) for. 

Give her a job, she's an extremely energetic breed so walkies and fetch might not cut it.

When she barks, interrupt her (but don't punish her).

Try to find out if there is something that sets her off and teach her to react calmly to that.

As you are working 8-5 you might need someone to come over once a day when he gets older as well, unless you want to have a permanent indoor potty or you have a doggie door.

A tip for helping him settle and fall asleep is to feed him frozen food from a Kong or a similar toy. If you feed kibble you can moisten it first and then scoop the mush into the toys and freeze them. Make sure he understands how to eat from the toy, and then leave him with one or more stuffed toys in the laundry room.

Having the radio or TV on can also make him feel less alone.

I really enjoyed teaching it to my dog, we ended up also learning this thing where I tell her to wait but I keep walking. I was expecting her to need treats for a long time with this command, but she quickly started doing it without treats. Perhaps continuing the walk is enough of a reward.
I like your method of doing tricks on the walk to get her attention back on you and calm her down, I'll borrow that one!
Have you tried using the ""leave it"" command when she is pulling towards something? It's fairly easy to make the command really strong (and enjoyable to the dog) by reinforcing heavily when the dog chooses to take their attention away from something. This can be done mostly at home, with only random rewards on walks. Getting away from the leash tension and continuing the walk seems to motivate dogs to listen to this command with little to no treats."

Puppies learn bite inhibition by biting other puppies (that will complain if it's too rough) and adult dogs (that will scold them if they are too rough), as well as humans (that should only react to painful bites at first, but the end goal is no biting or mouthing). Could bite inhibition ""training"" be part of their dynamic?
If you're worried it's something more than him being parental and teaching her doggy manners, a canine behaviorist would be the best person to help analyze the situation. That being said, I've seen dog mommas growling at, chasing and snapping at their weaned puppies. All without actually hurting them. Tough love."
dogs,fe5id3k,t3_entszb,1578869830.0,"The things to be aware of when using corrections are:

1. Am I hurting my dog, causing it to become stressed, anxious, afraid or aggressive?
2. Does my dog understand what I'm trying to tell it?
3. Am I hurting the bond between myself and my dog, or my dogs' eagerness to work?

From what you're writing, you don't seem to be causing your dog any major harm, but there are some minor tweaks you could consider, just to make sure you and your dog have the best possible relationship and get even more enjoyment out of each other. 

I would perhaps replace ""NO"" with some more specific commands like ""leave it"", ""drop it"", ""down"", and ""go to your bed"", since you can teach all these commands through positive reinforcement and say them in a happy/neutral tone. It's not really fair to say a dog is misbehaving, the dog does what it's instincts and experiences tell it to do. If the behavior is unwanted, that's a training and/or management issue.

""Get back"" sounds like a perfectly fine command, and you have the option of rewarding her every now and then for getting back to you and staying close. Instead of tugging on the lead (there's always a risk of neck injuries) you can teach your dog to give in to leash pressure (pull gently on the lead, mark and reward when the dog gives in, practice all directions). The goal is for the dog to react to gentle pressure on the neck by loosening the lead instead of instinctively pushing against the pressure, this will allow you to use very light leash pressure to communicate with the dog. When you train this you'll need treats (also for the first times you practice on a walk), but you should be able to cut down on the treats and more or less get rid of them pretty quick. The walk itself will act as a reward. If your dog sometimes does not give in right away, just wait her out.

Teaching commands like ""left"", ""right"", ""wait"", ""go"", etc. will add an extra dimension to your leash-walking and communication. And it's really fun to have a ""remote controlled"" dog.

Making the dog wait, or turning around, if they start to pull is a negative punishment, meaning the dog does not get what it wants (to go forward). Negative punishments are seen as completely OK among positive dog trainers. Just be careful you do not turn it into a positive punishment (meaning that you add something that feels punishing to the dog) by acting angry or intimidating. Making her sit or down might be excessive, and could possibly make her less likely to do these things happily in other situations. Would it be enough to just stop her so she can't go forward?

I do not disagree with cooking food for your dog, nothing wrong with that. When comparing raw food to kibble, keep in mind kibble can carry salmonella and mycotoxins. Raw feeders have a little more to educate themselves on than people opting for kibble, as hygiene goes, but we should all be careful.

I have some more data points regarding DCM, these numbers are for Dobermans (a breed considered very much at risk of DCM) in Finland. The registry is pretty good, but not all deaths get reported. As you can see there are 1452 registered deaths in total, out of which 75 (5,2%) are due to DCM. https://jalostus.kennelliitto.fi/frmTerveystilastot.aspx?R=143&Lang=en

With another breed, let's go with the Whippet, 4 out of 863 deaths, or 0,5% of deaths where due to DCM. https://jalostus.kennelliitto.fi/frmTerveystilastot.aspx?R=162&Lang=en

So, if your dog is not considered a high-risk breed for DCM I still think it is fair to say DCM should not be your main concern when choosing a brand of dog food.
However, if an owner wants to balance between, for some reason, avoiding grains and avoiding legumes (which might be a good idea), there are foods that use ingredients such as rice or corn as well as raw or home cooked options. Personally, I don't mind a little bit of grain in my dogs diet, but I do not discount owners that find grain free is better for their dog.

I agree some brands have more scientific research behind them, showing that they meet minimum requirements. Are they really that great, though? I don't know. Are there boutique brands that have just whisked together a recipe and put their product on the shelf? Surely. Going for a certain price point does not guarantee a good product. 
If you are willing to go through the differences as well as pro's and con's of brands, I'll be happy to read about it. Most people don't, they just promote whatever brand they themselves happen to feed. 
I do not think WSAVA guidelines are a bad thing, but hopefully we will have better guidelines in the future."

In a little more than four years, the FDA received 524 reports of DCM in dogs, 119 of these dogs died. The amount of dogs that die in the US every year is in the millions, so, yes, DCM is causing more worry in pet owners than it should. Obesity, kidney disease, diabetes and cancers should still be the major concerns of pet owners.

dogs,fdxsxh6,t1_fdxl070,1578772554.0,"Didn't OP say that she had a reason to feed grain free? You could ask them why that is. 
Since we are talking about food for pets, there is not going to be a tremendous amount of scientific evidence, unless that ""science"" can be used to sell something. Taurine deficiency was linked to DCM in cats in the 80's, but back then it was believed dogs made enough of their own taurine. You are right that legumes in dog food might be (part of) the problem, but we don't know if they inhibit taurine absorption completely or just make absortion less efficient.
I have not claimed that raw feeding in any form is superior, although it is often low in legumes, but I'm happy to give some pointers to people who have decided for themselves they might want to try it.
It is common practice to mix kibble with something like wet food or food scraps to enhance taste. There is no scientific evidence for or against this practice (apart from the fact that a lot of human foods are not suitable for dogs), but it makes sense that nutrient rich add-ons like eggs, innards, meat and bone would compliment the diet quite nicely, especially if you don't use too much of any one thing. Vets often claim you can exchange 10% of a dogs food without making or breaking their diet, so that is probably a suitable amount to go for with very young puppies, unless you are confident you have a raw food that will meet all their needs."

dogs,fdxji8t,t1_fdx97rp,1578769304.0,"I am not generally in favor of grain-free kibble over any other kind of kibble, but for the dogs that get relief from skin-issues, allergies etc when they are on a grain-free diet that is a direct benefit that, IMO, outweighs a possible increased risk of DCM.
If you are worried about DCM, looking at the amount of taurine in your dogs diet is a good idea. Taurine does not survive high temperatures very well, so kibble can often be deficient in it. Poultry is a good source, if you cook it you need to make sure the dog still gets all the meat juices since that is where most of the taurine will be. A stew made from the ""dark meat parts"" of chicken or turkey (thigh and drumstick) would be better than a fried chicken breast. Remove any bones before feeding as cooked bones are dangerous to dogs.
It can be difficult to find a raw food formulated for puppies (and making your own blend requires extensive knowledge), but a high quality puppy kibble topped with some raw food is a good option until they are old enough to move on to an adult diet."
