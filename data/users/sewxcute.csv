AskReddit,fejhtsf,t3_ep9ur1,1579174903.0,in the early days of the Internet some creep in a chat room sent me a link to child porn. the girl couldnt have been older than 5. I was 11 or 12 at the time and its fucked me up worse than any gruesome death video.
dating_advice,fejh61j,t3_ep4cow,1579174042.0,"I live at the end of an apartment building next to a taco shop. it's easier to give taco shop address to people so they dont end up on wrong side of the building. I told the guy this and the dude still actually knocked on the door to the closed taco shop and then walked around to knock on the back door. 

the guy was training to be a cop. 

YIKES."

Frugal,feg11lp,t3_eov3l2,1579072360.0,"I buy big packs and good shit on sale of freezable stuff. split into single servings so you don't have to thaw out everything. meal prepping works for most things, just takes a day but you could easily cook up a few different meals and freeze in smaller portions so you're not stuck eating the same thing all week.

I spend around 100/month but I only eat once a day."

doggrooming,fefyxpr,t3_eomrty,1579069988.0,"look at the shelandy dryer on Amazon. its cheap but does a decent job. you can lightly mist the coat with a spray bottle and dry. it'll also help you see the tangles.
dryer on low in one hand going slowly and fluff out with a slicker brush in the other hand. I go over everything with a greyhound comb afterwards to make sure i didnt miss anything and then brush those spots out til I can get the fine end of the comb through."
doggrooming,fefyj02,t3_eox999,1579069550.0,"if theyre not to the skin, try working them out with cornstarch. then soak them in undiluted  conditioner and try to brushout (dont overdo it with brushing/combing). if it's too bad then just shave it. it'll look weird but grow back. no big deal"

though I do see other people changing a lot over the years. 

but I feel like I've always been lost. and everyone else seems to know who they are at least at that point in their lives and I've just always been nothing. I never felt comfortable labeling myself because it feels fake as fuck."
