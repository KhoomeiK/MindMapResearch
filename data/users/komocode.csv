Of course, I'm a software developer and I've used plenty of open source code in my projects. The point still stands that anyone can still create a copycat, utilize the patents (which means less R&D), undercut Tesla's prices, and sell it.

> I'm not saying that Tesla should just up and use one of those licenses

I'm not saying that. I'm just simplifying the explanation by generalizing it a bit.

> If Ford had started using Tesla's patents under the pledge, Elon would have been very happy because it would mean that Tesla could have called the Model 3 the Model E after all

How about play that out a little more? Ok, so Ford uses patents, Elon suddenly uses Model E (assuming the timeframe is around when Model 3 wasn't even announced yet). What happens next? Obviously Ford is going to call Tesla out on this. ""Tesla was trying to act in good faith and allow other car manufacturers use their patents. It turns out, it was a trojan horse all along. It was Tesla's plan to steal everyone's IP because they're a failing EV company that can't make an affordable car without stealing technology. We will now cancel our EV efforts and focus on ICE vehicles for the foreseeable future."" So Tesla is going to risk the PR hit and as well as the potential accelerated EV demand because Elon wanted the SEX? Nah, I don't buy it.

Not saying it's the prime example for this. I'm sure there could be a car manufacturer that came up with a entirely new battery chemistry that's far better than Tesla, but because they used one small manufacturing Tesla patent, Tesla could steal that battery chemistry. But then again, the PR fall out from that could be devastating as Tesla relies on word of mouth to sell cars.

> If Ford sues GM for patent infringement, they lose the protection under Tesla's patent pledge, and Tesla would be able to sue Ford for infringement

Tesla has 0 incentives to enforce this. Obviously GM isn't acting properly and Tesla would even encourage Ford to fight it since Tesla is, in your example, using Ford's IP and would like Ford to come up with more IP that Tesla can use.



This whole ""open sourcing of patents"" really has good intentions since getting other companies to build EVs would only help Tesla sell more cars regardless of how good the competition is (at least at the time when people weren't hungry for EVs). But Tesla lawyers were simply doing their job of protecting this stunt, so there are a bunch of clauses where it can easily be interpreted in court that Tesla could take a bunch of IP and control a lot of the legal aspect (which in my opinion, Tesla wouldn't do outright). No question there that would scare off a bunch of lawyers to warn the executives to not take up Tesla's offer.


TL;DR - can Tesla technically take a bunch of IP and control a lot of the legal battles if someone used their patents? In court, sure. Would Elon actually do it? Not really, unless there was malicious intent or some bad actors involved."

It doesn't because those GPL and Creative Commons allow you to basically rip off the entire creation as long as you put in the names of the original author (among other things that GPL needs).

Tesla doesn't want a rip off. They want more EVs to be on the road since it would generate a lot of EV demand (and therefore Tesla benefits substantially). A GPL or Creative Commons would allow any company to create an exact look of the Model 3 as long as Tesla's name is written somewhere in the credits.

My take is that Tesla won't sue a car company if they created a much better EV using those patents, as long as it is different. But lawyers of the different car company are telling the executives ""no no no, you shouldn't use these patents"" (since it's their job to do so), so they don't use them."
