dogs,fejmts8,t3_ep5jpm,1579180184.0,"So sorry. It’s the worst...but I agree with most of the people about it being better to have it happen a bit too early than too late. We don’t want them to suffer for one second. It is a gentle moment- 
Take care."
DidntKnowIWantedThat,fcsxuo2,t3_eijvqn,1577927840.0,This just seems silly...and not even that fun.
grammar,fcjb5dd,t3_ehh7j3,1577681885.0,What does ELSYS stand for?
dogs,fcjadwj,t1_fcj49iu,1577681283.0,I wish that for you also- take care-
bipolar,fcj4796,t3_eh7ypx,1577676852.0,"My father has said numerous times to me, “So- what’s your so-called diagnosis?” You can imagine how supported I feel... He thinks it’s total BS."
dogs,fcj2ery,t3_ehf4hk,1577675584.0,I am so sorry. This is heartbreaking-  As a dear friend once told me about our beloved dogs: We have to see them out when they let us know it’s time... It sounds like you are listening to Loki- but it is still the worst. The worst. My dog died two weeks before my sister killed herself in 2017. It seems that you have had too much to deal with in a short amount of time. I am so sorry.  Take care.
bipolar,fcexlj0,t3_egz14c,1577624617.0,"Agitated, highly irritable, more creative (sharper?), totally awake and then utterly exhausted, anxious, lonely, overly sensitive (I’m not a crier, but I cry during mixed episodes), obsessive thoughts, some suicidal ideation, big ideas, some spending...literally a mix- maybe with a leaning toward mania or depression- but generally a sloppy integration of the two. I sometimes describe it as “bees in my brain...”

I’m sorry you are going through it. Are you taking any meds? (Obviously you don’t have to answer that! :))
Take care. Rest your brain."
