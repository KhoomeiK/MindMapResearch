relationships,feiiaeu,t3_ep9gwa,1579139171.0,"It's kind of amazing to hear ""am I being a creeper?"" come from a woman in this situation. I can assure you that female attention is almost never anything but flattering and day making. Female coworkers who have asked me out and I've politely declined have been on my mind for 2, maybe 3 days after, and then it's back to the usual. Conventionally attractive people are nice to look at, even if there isn't any possibility of romantic involvement (hence why you might find each other meeting gazes). You're totally in your own head here. Just be normal and treat him like a friend.

If you're still worried that you're being a creeper, I can think of maybe one in my life in which getting romantic attention from a woman ever fell under ""creepy."" Here's your measuring stick:

I was at a bar with friends playing pool and said ""ah damn that was my last beer I'm outta cash."" A girl overheard, offered to buy me one, I said sure, and she gave me one. I said thank you and went back to playing pool. Every time my beer was close to finished, she was there with another one. I have not said anything to this girl beyond ""thank you so much, etc."" No real conversation. It was time to leave, so I thanked her again, and my friends and I left the bar and got back on the campus drunk bus, and as soon as I sat down she popped up on the bus and sat down next to me. No conversation the whole way to our stop. I text my friends to get off the bus one stop early. We got off the bus, she got off the bus with us. We go, ""OMG we got off on the wrong stop!!"" and hop back on, she said the same and got back on. And then we ran to our apartment when we got to our stop.  


I think you're in the clear lol"
offmychest,fei3u3y,t1_fei3hd2,1579129679.0,"I can see that perspective, but at least when I commented there really wasn’t any intentional misgendering that I found like you described—just targeted correction. I just had a hard time believing she’d go to those lengths to correct, but for the situation, then suggesting it’s been drilled down. To whatever degree beyond that it is/isn’t a subconscious issue, is of course purely speculation from us."
offmychest,fei1mug,t1_fei1fda,1579128314.0,"Yeah, that’s my take on it as well. Even though I just made observations, I think her response, and taking it as a personal attack, is perfectly normal for a heated person in her situation."

offmychest,fehvd5c,t3_ep5d4a,1579124612.0,"How careful and meticulous you are to pay gender respects, and how resilient you are in the comments to correct people when they don't only say ""her"" or ""paula"" is so curious to me. I'm all for treating people with respect, and not intentionally needlessly shitting on anyone (for bigoted reasons or the lack thereof), but this just seems so different--so adamant--for someone in your position.

It's almost as if I'm reading this in the tone that you've really tried to embody the acceptance to a point where you are shining a badge of ""non-transphobia"" and also venting your frustrations at the same time and on equal playingfields. To me, I have a hard time not seeing it is conditioning you put yourself through--to always put respect for her choice first. It makes me wonder, however, how far beneath everything you've put yourself in an attempt to be that person.

I hope you walk to a future that works for you."

Honestly, I really still wish I wasn't going because the hotel and tux rental will still be on me, as well as anything I spend out there. I won't die from setting aside $600 or so for his wedding, but damn could I REALLY use the money for other stuff and debt. Just shoot your shot and live your life.

I've been in the same situation (still find myself cracking and buying a cart/8th every few months) after being clean a couple months, but used to be an every day all day smoker for years. It really does fuck with your perception, your motivation, self-worth, anxiety. Everything. Any stoner that gets sober won't be one of those ""weed is a miracle drug bro smoke all day every day"" kind of people. You have no idea how far perpetual weed use puts you in a hole and suppresses you until you quit cold turkey and readjust over a week or two.

relationships,fdbi8b9,t3_ekayqw,1578257623.0,"Good luck. Can’t fix your younger brother without fixing your family’s weight problem first—he’s fat because they live a fat lifestyle (cognizant of the health concerns or not), and he’s being indoctrinated into it.

Not that I know anything about your family dynamic, but I’ve seen plenty of examples of the fat members of the family ganging up against and making the healthy family member the black sheep whenever lifestyle change is brought up.

No easy way out here that isn’t likely to also be a huge burden on yourself as well. Kudos for caring, but you should worry about your own wellbeing too. If you pour yourself into fighting this, you’ll be spread super thin in the rest of your life too. Pick your battles, and do your best to educate."
RocketLeague,fd9evz8,t1_fd76fxm,1578232471.0,"This is one of those plays where everyone knows what can happen, but they don’t necessarily plan for it exactly as it occurs until they’re in the moment. It’s like one thing leads to another. 

He gets the pass off kickoff up the wall; everyone thinks: about to push it up mid for a pass/shot on goal, so the person in mid gets ready because of his position and the balls position. Person receiving the pass in mid is already anticipating and goes up and either shoots or passes depending on how he reads the ball/situation—could’ve been a bad shot that turned into a great pass. The person who made the initial pass is there to receive the next pass because he’s reading the momentum and positioning to know he could have another touch if he gets a pass or a wide right touch, so he goes anyway just in case.

It’s like conditioning and experience just elicit these outcomes sometimes because people can foresee possible outcomes even if they’re not confident they can create them in the moment. They’re just there shooting their shot."

AskMen,fc778hn,t3_egf0l1,1577499399.0,"I act like everyone else does, and put on a smile, but in reality it's just to fit in and not draw attention to myself. I have zero ambitions in life; little will to live, little will to die. Working a dead end job I'm extremely over qualified for, in debt and I don't make enough to really chip away at it. No idea how to want more out of life. Intelligent, but unable to channel it into anything. Attractive, but not interested in anybody, but also starved for affection and emotional depth. Extremely active and healthy, but for what?

I would just like to feel like there's anything more to my existence than essentially being rechargeable battery for some capitalist's endeavor, but I have no idea how to want more--I feel like everyone else in the world seems to ""get it,"" but I don't understand how they can. I think that if I were to consider killing myself, and if I were to leave a suicide note, it would hark back and pay homage to Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep, but it would end differently--something to the tune of, ""You should not miss me, in the darkness of your dive.

I remember learning in a psych class in college (probably brought up in some nature v nurture debate) that homophobic parents tend to, on average, have more LGBTQ children than parents that aren't homophobic.

truegaming,fc4e5mg,t3_efzb8g,1577414055.0,"I like to reference this video about Amnesia, and how the guy breaks down horror game types:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXuIZstyM7E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXuIZstyM7E) 

Basically the type of game that is the scariest is one that cements the expectation of ""about to be scared"" in your brain, and then fucks with you by fucking with that idea to no end, essentially sitting you on the edge of your seat hyping yourself up for the scare. The actual scare is not the majority scary part, it's how the game makes your mind build the tension leading into something scary.   


There are also very general things that have an association with fear/panic: claustrophobia (Silent Hill PT does this well by making the whole game a looping hallway), darkness/sensory deprivation (most horror games do this--we use our senses for security, so less senses = less secure; even quality timed silence can be chilling), ominous music/sounds (every horror game), and the inability to fight back (games like amnesia/penumbra) really add to the stress because you're on the lookout the whole time without the ability to defend yourself.   


If you're able to bypass immersion and just play it as a game with pixels and sounds and puzzles, then I imagine none of these will matter, but then why would you play any immersive game if you're just looking to play a puzzle game?"

Nothing is more daunting than feeling like you’re the one person driving the conversation, or like you’re just trying to buy time to fire off the next question because you’re not getting an engaging conversation in the moment. Doubt is the killer of men’s confidence.
