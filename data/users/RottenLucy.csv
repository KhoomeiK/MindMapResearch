If someone believes a colour can only be green or yellow but not both, they're just wrong. I'm going to call them out on being wrong, and I'm going to criticise stuff that seems to spread and/or legitimise black-and-white perceptions such as the examples above."
SampleSize,feyyw2k,t1_fexn7k9,1579452198.0,"There's some miscommunication going on. The kind of testing you're talking about is 100% fine. Categorising the colour spectrum is 100% fine as long as you know it's a spectrum. However, a lot of people forget about the spectrum and think of categories only. That's why you have silly reddit posts such as ""me and my gf are arguing about what colour this dress is - yellow or green?"" when the said dress is lime.

For a lot of people there's no such thing as ""lime"". For a lot of people there's no such thing as colours overlapping. For a lot of people a (lime) thing can only be yellow or green, not both. A lot of people are just dumb like that.

Imagine if this survey was about race. Imagine if it was pictures of people with different colour skins and you were asked to label them as ""black"" or ""white"". Wouldn't you think that survey would be propagating an idea that a person can only be white or black and not anything in between? Especially if the survey didn't specifically indicate that the author didn't have such an unrealistic perspective of races and was just interested in seeing where the line is drawn. Wouldn't you find that problematic?

I'm not saying ""don't categorise colours"". I'm saying ""don't have black-and-white thinking"". I'm sad that a person with a username like yours has such hard time recognising [splitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splitting_(psychology))."

Axe is simpler in theory, I'm just not good at timing slow weapons. You know, fast weapons are more forgiving as you seem to get fewer frames to recover. If you miss once, you can avoid getting punished fairly easily, and can hit again soon after missing. That's not really the case with axe or hammer.

So yeah, I'm not great with axe, although I've been playing Ragnir and Azoth quite a bit. I guess I'll try them out in ranked some time.

The post and survey say ""Gender Stereotypes"". You lead me to believe it was a survey about gender stereotypes. Then you ask a question about something different than gender. Why not call it ""Gender and Sex Stereotypes"" instead, then?

Then you follow up with this:

>Which stereotypes, mentioned above or not, do you think have a real biological basis?

Makes me think your survey is a about biological sex rather than gender. I didn't know what your views on gender were, and this made me think you think ""gender = sex"". I was doing a survey about gender and then I'm asked about sex. Don't you think it's at least somewhat confusing?

I also have no desire to be helping out bigots. I gave you the benefit of the doubt since people seem to be socially progressive on reddit. Those last write in questions made me think that perhaps you're actually more on the traditionalist side.

Of course, at the end, you include options for trans people, so that's good. Although it wasn't ideal. You group sex and gender options into one. As others have pointed out ""transgender"" isn't a gender. It doesn't matter that the question says ""gender/sex"" since transgender isn't a sex either. ""FTM transgender"" is neither a sex nor a gender. It's just a type of trans person.

Don't ask about two different things in one question. Instead, you should've asked for gender identification, then bio sex. You could also ask if the person was trans or not, if you want.

Also, state what the survey is for at the very beginning of it. State its purpose, state your view on gender and sex. Hell, maybe even collect the gender and sex information right at the start instead of at the end of the survey.

Edit: People don't pick gender. When you say it that way, it makes it sound as if people choose to be trans. They don't choose either. People pick what to label themselves."
