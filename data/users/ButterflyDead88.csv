insaneparents,ffd345t,t1_ffbldfp,1579812476.0,"Sounds like that book ""A Child Called It"" was written by a guy who was abused by his mother while his other siblings were well taken care of and loved. For wherever reason the mother decided to take all her mental health issues out on him only. It was a really sad read just fyi."
aww,ffd2d8y,t3_esvrya,1579812052.0,And this is why you mount your furniture to the wall in a child's room. Even a small dresser like this.
aww,ffcrqrf,t1_ffco906,1579805903.0,Yes and also suffocating. If the blanket is thick enough and covers the baby's face it can cause them to suffocate. Much like holding a pillow over the face. Takes a lot less force to suffocate a small baby.
aww,ffcj35w,t1_ffcinkt,1579800538.0,"Honestly it's true. That blanket, though unlikely, poses way more of a threat to that baby then the cute furbaby helping keep it warm and safe."

Also it's adorable I love it!"
badwomensanatomy,ffbwpbu,t1_ffbs028,1579785253.0,That movie was actually a mix of hilarious and disturbing.
badwomensanatomy,ffbwm5f,t1_ffbv1mo,1579785176.0,Fuk u bruh I came here to same that and u beat me to it!! Lol have my upvote.
walmart,fempte3,t1_femami2,1579266016.0,"Of course you have to tell management. But the thing is they can't really tell you that you can't leave because PPTO was meant to cover instances of ""life coming up"". So if I have to leave to get my kids and I use ppto they can't coach me for that. They can't coach anyone for it. And you don't HAVE to give them anymore reason of why u are leaving beyond ""something came up and I have to leave. I have ppto."" 

Sure if you leave your work undone you aren't going to make any friends of your manager or co workers. But they can't stop you or deny your ppto. Because that's exactly what it's used for. Covering moments when life comes up and you need to either leave early or be late. Or be gone the whole day."
walmart,felelxy,t1_fekowqv,1579220357.0,"Our store... ""Ppto doesn't cover you leaving early."""
trashy,fekmbdm,t3_epko5e,1579203020.0,"Your dad?!?! This looks like something you would find in grandma's basement where her ""precious grandson"" lives... Not a grown ass adult man with children.... Jesus fuck."
Instagramreality,fejmsqw,t1_feieenm,1579180158.0,Right same! And I've seen a bunch of gifs and videos where chicks literally show in real time the difference between a low angle and a high one. It came sooooo much difference.
Instagramreality,fehrpze,t1_feg2pd4,1579122555.0,"I was hesitant to say this because this sub is notorious for ripping into people for claiming that a photo is only makeup and angles because apparently any picture that's not of you at your worst is obviously fake and not the realistic. 

But yeah I was thinking that as I was looking at these pictures, the angle of her face especially the fact that she's got her head tipped up and to the side so she doesn't have the double chin thing going on like she does in the second picture. 

I will admit there is definitely some kind of filter over it to give her slightly smoother and slightly more tan skin, either that or she's under completely different lighting. but yeah everything in this photo could easily be achieved with makeup and angles."
ChoosingBeggars,fehos1w,t1_feh8pg1,1579120861.0,I'm sorry but as a parent I would never expect anybody to watch my children for free just because I needed them to at the last moment. I don't know where your logic comes from but it is completely unrealistic.
ChoosingBeggars,fehojbh,t1_fehgcvh,1579120722.0,"Op ignore this idiot. Sounds like he probably agrees with your ex friend and her husband. ""If you don't fight tooth and nail for your money you must obviously just be a whiner and not actually need the money"" 

OP you do what's best for you which includes ignoring your ex friend and people like this commenter. You are an amazing person and don't deserve any of this. I hope your health improves and your life gets a little easier. 


P.s. I think your paintings are beautiful!!!"
AmItheAsshole,fehl0lx,t1_fehic5a,1579118689.0,"my oldest is 11 and I still wouldn't leave her in a waiting room for 2 hours by herself, but I also wouldn't make her wait in the waiting room while I was getting a sonogram for her brother or sister that's just mean. And the fact that the mother doesn't want her to ruin it means that the mother knows what type of person her daughter is and instead of fixing it she just doesn't want to have to deal with her own kid. That's really sad and I bet you that little girl smart enough to notice what's going on."
AmItheAsshole,fehkqmd,t1_fehi2vt,1579118529.0,"I was literally just wondering this. It sounds like they're setting her up to deal with the daughter while she's being difficult so that they don't have to while they're bonding with the baby. And with no regard to the fact that she's also pregnant. 

I think that's the part that blows me away the most about this. OP is having a complicated pregnancy that is made her have to take time off work and instead of supporting her and being there for her and her needs they're using her as a free babysitter and a stand-in parent for them so that they don't have to deal with their admittedly snarky rude child. 

in my opinion there is nothing worse than parents who set their kids up for failure and then want nothing to do with them, or pawn them off, when they act out and misbehave.  ""Oh she's just gonna ruin the experience"" I WONDER WHY?!?"
AmItheAsshole,feaa1cv,t3_eo58hd,1578946138.0,man I just love all you keyboard warriors who want to pretend that you're so honorable that you wouldn't have walked out of that store paying $99 and got absolutely furious at the idea of being told to come back and pay $200 more for it... Y'all are so ridiculous and so full of it you all know you would have walked out of that store paying ONLY $99 and nothing more stop acting like you're better than OP.
AmItheAsshole,fdqc833,t3_emimf3,1578662723.0,"NTA .....LIKE HARD. 


Can u be my husband???? Mine is still weirded out about having to buy me tampons once in a blue moon. I even take a pic of the box and send it to him so he knowS EXACTLY which one to get but he still acts like I asked him to bring me a dead rodent for dinner. Lol"
walmart,fcuvrl9,t3_eizv8o,1577989538.0,"Sounds like my Friday to Saturday this week. Work till 11pm Friday night then turn around and back in store by 8am. Add the 20 min drive to work and 20 minutes home. Eh... Whatever... Go team...

badwomensanatomy,fc2mayx,t1_fc2jnu6,1577366901.0,"This! I'll never pull off the dewy look because my face is so oily naturally that within 5 minutes it really would be oil. And much like y'all I grew up where ""SHINE BAD"" was basically makeup law."
