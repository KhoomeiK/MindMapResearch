It’s not silly games that makes kids spoiled. She wasn’t demanding to win and the parents aren’t just rolling over to appease her. This is a really young kid they’re having fun with. He’ll have the relationship with her to guide her if she ever does deal with failure poorly. People are overanalyzing one cute thing when it’s the overall parent relationship that matters."

Let’s review and change the policy.” People who care about discrimination will be thoughtful and work with you instead of dig their heels in or circle their wagons."

When I’ve visited him, the prejudice down there is jarring. I’m white and other white people would talk to me like they thought I would share their prejudice. What they thought was normal or “not racist” was still really prejudiced."
SapphoAndHerFriend,ffal29e,t3_esei0m,1579738430.0,"So, this might be too generous considering they left out his activism, but could their be a style guide rule that prevents reporters from outing someone in certain circumstances?

nottheonion,ff42ek0,t3_ere6f9,1579554057.0,Maybe this could summon enough of the Internet and gaming trolls to wreck him in the primaries?

nottheonion,ff41wbx,t1_ff3q2mw,1579553746.0,"Yeah, the actual quote is about the particular CEO, but the whole thing is still a campaign killer with the male Internet vote.

gay_irl,feoxw8i,t1_fenityf,1579307770.0,Sex isn’t just penetration. That’s what straight people don’t get. Sex is all the great things you can do until both people climax. Just one of those things is limited by Chipotle.

Another example though of how people need journalists more as our ability to even contact someone responsible dwindles. It’s like you have to get a story published to even get a refund for so many things."
nottheonion,febhyo2,t1_febeetk,1578958994.0,"That’s kinda the point of the bigger story though. The contractor structure of the ride sharing companies removes a big layer of accountability and responsibility that was built into laws for cabs over time. The cab situation needed an overhaul, but it’s like we’re back to starting over on consumer protections and company accountability when it comes to ride services."

KidsAreFuckingStupid,fe5y6gp,t1_fe51wrl,1578877567.0,"I feel like so many of these Facebook advice posts by police are written in a really Dunning-Kruger way. It’s like a tone of full authority and kinda condescending like you would to kids. And on top of it, it’s rarely data driven advice or cited in any way. I’m thinking of this one post about an opioid overdose situation and a sheriff was just like “this is why we gotta get in schools and teach kids not to use drugs.” Like that’s it? That’s all you got? Nothing about consulting experts on addiction or the history of how we already tried anti-drug education and it doesn’t show flawless results."
