tf2,fdnj9po,t1_fdn1i6u,1578586975.0,"Something i try and do instead of reject that i died is laugh at how stupid i was for putting myself in thst situation, i take a mental note to practice multitasking and strafing, and i respawn. I don't beat myself up over deaths the way most oeople would."
tf2,fdmz108,t1_fdmh4a4,1578571956.0,"The classes i've been looking into getting better at were Soldier, Medic, and Scout. With scout, i find myself getting more kills and surviving longer with the Force-a-Nature, the Mad Milk, and the Boston Basher. My problem, however, is that my hand flinches whenever i'm in 1x1 combat.

Soldier i find that i'm surprisingly good at. I can actually lead my shots with the Direct Hit, and i fond myself hitting more shots with it than say, stock or Beggar's Bazooka. However, the same problem comes up. In close quarters combat, i often have no choice but to whip my enemy to death like a kinky fucker. I normally use the Batallions Backup [i forget which is which, the one that gives you health and gives anyone in your proximity resistances and crit immunity] 

For Medic, i normally use Crossbow, Uber, and Ubersaw. The meta. Not much to say here, i'm always the focus point of enemy fire, which i understand. Always knock out the healer first. I just need to learn better positioning against the enemy."
