dogs,ffnz2g2,t1_ffnulqi,1580072480.0,"Brush frequency is based on the coat type and shedding. What breed is your pup? Or does he have a double coat? 

Shampoo, I'll be honest, I give my dogs a bath 1-4 times a year tops, depending on how dirty they get during summer playing in mud. Otherwise I use my waterless shampoo for their deep brushings. I have a GSD/Lab and a Malamute for reference. A good shampoo I've used while grooming was Top Paw, they also have a conditioner that works so good and smells amazing. I do strongly recommend trying to get the smallest amount you can and using it as a test first as your pup can sometimes have odd reactions to shampoos due to unknown allergies and the likes. 

The issue beyond that would also again, be your pups fur. Decrease those numbers if your dog has fur like a pittie or rottie, where it's not double coated, as that type of fur is easier to clean just the waterless shampoo. With that type of hair, it's more crucial to maintain their hair oils to protect their skin."
dogs,ffnu33s,t1_ffnrkcj,1580070836.0,"More than likely puppy coat shedding. Check to see if his skin is red and irritated or appears to be drier than normal. The itchiness most likely is simply due to shedding his puppy coat.

Wahl makes a waterless shampoo and one is a coconut oatmeal type I'd use for dogs with skin issues. What I would do would be to examine your pup's skin, if no skin irritation appears present, you could use this to help with the shedding as well as skin dryness, however with him being so young I'd use small amounts and only once every two weeks. Make sure to give him a gentle brush after. 

Any signs of skin irritation should be checked by a vet as they could vary in severity at that age."

I need an idea on what you're looking for as to why you need a product.

Dogs have oils that are vital to keeping their fur healthy, this is why frequent baths are a no-go. No product should be used daily on your dog. Esp if he's only 4 months old."
dogs,ffngfcj,t1_ffneb2a,1580065605.0,"No prob! 

I'm willing to bet that if you saw a vest on a K9 unit of any sort that they had a Molle vest.

See if you can find Icefang, OneTigris, or Elite Spanker, this is usually online. I'm not sure how Amazon's shipping is like in EU, kinda skipped over that part in your post sorry, but you may be able to find another similar company online if you can't find them with decent shipping. I know that the vests generally run about 30-40 USD. 

Hopefully that helps too!"
dogs,ffndjhi,t1_ffmah9f,1580064547.0,"Here's my set up:

I use a bungee leash with two handles, Elite Spanker is my go-to company for this. I also use their collar but any collar works good. Having a collar with a handle is great at times.

I have a carabiner on the top handle, and use that to attach it to my belt. This allows me to either grab the leash where it's attached to me, or the second and lower handle and pull my dog in closer as needed. Being attached to my belt, I less likely worry about tearing. 

Molle vests work amazing if you want a vest too, as they have handles, leash attachments, and you can get molle gear to take on/off as needed."
BeAmazed,ffmtla4,t1_ffl838u,1580058720.0,"I don't think I meant to apply punishment towards accidents? But I see what you mean. I meant more towards when you can catch them in the act of say, eating food that they're not supposed to. I should've added that I'm not saying it's something that should be relied on, but rather saying that's what you should do at most. Wording things isn't always my strong suit. 

And also, I know 100% they do not teach that. Except that in the US, they don't really have a ton of classes for dog training. In fact, the scary thing to note is anyone can claim to be a dog trainer and get clients. I only do it as a side thing and refer certain cases (high risk aggression for example) to people who need a higher trained person. I trained my Fiance's Service Dog. That's how lacking regulation is in the US. No certifications or anything. 

That said, this is why I also dislike Ceasar, and one of my BIGGEST frustrations is dealing with people who watched his stuff as a base for their training. Ugh."
BeAmazed,ffk3yw9,t1_ffk2i1n,1580015094.0,"Lemme explain a case study story.

We have Max, who when he was a puppy and made accidents in the house, his parents would scold him and punish him when they found the messes. He started to show signs of submissiveness because he could see the mess too and knew that mess equaled punishment.

After Max was house-trained and 2 years later, his parents got another puppy, Anne. Anne would leave a mess when the parents were gone. When the parents discovered the mess that was clearly too small for Max to have made, Max still showed signs of submissiveness, awaiting to be punished. 

Dogs are terrible at making connections. In the case of your pup, she doesn't understand that the action is wrong, she is making the connection of the debris being there equals punishment. The gotcha is that being caught in the act is your time to correct, but not when you haven't. And I don't recommend yelling, as you do not want your dog to fear you. Other dog trainers can put their two cents on this, but I prefer to put a hand around their mouth and firmly say no. 

Also, here are several other ways to address destructive problems and behaviors. 

A common cause for destructive behavior is boredom. A husky/lab mix needs a lot of mental stimulation. I recommend doing more exercise as well as spending time training her. Teach her to do silly tricks if you want, just help her be entertained and feel accomplished."

Banks need money to operate. The numbers have to represent actual currency and be backed otherwise there are issues. This is why you can't just print money, banks don't just create those numbers out of thin air. 

I agree the bar is set high for what the minimum is, but we live in an era now where options are popping up outside of physical bank locations. People have too much of a hate-boner for Banks to realize that if you don't like how one place is, there are other options.

We were supposed to role the new menu out, ya know, the ones that had the big pictures of burgers on the front, 4 days before they announced the name change. As a result, news articles picked up on everything before anything official was announced.

I worked my last month and a half after being transfered to what was supposed to be the ""prized store"" the store that was just remodeled. We had water leaks right above our grill and our fryer, there was a section of the kitchen where the wall was buldging from water damage, there was heavy amounts of rust around a doorframe to the point that it was falling apart en masse. A customer got stabbed by a spring that poked through a seat. And that was the newer prized store.

AskReddit,fdr1kln,t3_ems7r3,1578678281.0,"I consider myself a middle person but I'll delve into this. Without getting into policy:

- He's a egomaniac. Everything he does he claims he does it best. He claims he's the healthiest president ever. He claims he researches things and therefor knows more about certain topics than anyone. Isis, windmills, coal, the list goes on. There is nothing below him when it comes to protecting his ego, including encouragement of colleges to punish students for booing at his rallies. It's annoying to listen to someone repeatedly say that everything they do is the best and that they know more about something than people who dedicate their lives to said thing. That's not someone I want as president as in that position that's a very dangerous mindset to have.

- His temper. He handles everything at the very highest extreme and than blames everyone else for the issues. His twitter is a goldmine of these examples. 

- He has been found guilty of laundering money from charities. Need I say more?

- How he handles people who in general criticize him. At rallies, he kicks them out, even if they weren't saying a thing. His handling of McCain was an example of this, going so far as to demand that a ship with McCain's name was moved out of sight. He attacked 4 women telling them to go back to their countries who are by all means American. 

- His polls that he supports and runs are compiled of rigged questions.  

- A friendly reminder that he was friends with Epstein, was on Epstein's radar, and has a long list of sexual harassment/abuse claims dating back before the presidency, one of which the girl dropped due to a mix of harassment and threats. 

- His speeches are utter nonsense and at times an embarrassment. When he gives them because it's not slightly raining. I mean seriously, claiming we stormed the airports during the Revolutionary War? 

- He lies. A lot. He claimed the UN cheered for him when we have video of them utterly laughing at him. 

Now, a bit into policy debacles. 

- His attacks on media. In my opinion, a president should not be attacking media he disagrees with and declaring it as false news. It's a very dangerous slippery slope and results in a lot of misinformation to be allowed to happen. When faced with questions he doesn't want to answer, he is allowed to claim that they work for false news and doesn't even answer. And his base eats it up. Not seeing an issue with this is to ignore the basis of our freedom of press.

- How he handled Puerto Rico was bullshit. 

- He alienates our allies while sucking up to countries like Russia and, depending on the time of year, NK. Change my mind, but if Hilary had gone to Russia and had a press conference in Russia condemning our intelligence agencies, and asking Russia to aid in an investigation, the GOP would have lost their minds and demanded her to be arrested for treason. What he did then was blantantly and utterly unacceptable. You do not go on the world stage in another country as the president of the United States and attack your own country. That is treason and the fact that supporters did not see it that way baffles me.

- He puts people as the head of agencies who would love to destroy said agencies. He put someone who sued the EPA as it's head.
