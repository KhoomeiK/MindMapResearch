If you want this sort of thing to be your style then I recommend taking a look into the sorts of ""fear"" that are personal to people. If you try to scare people with the usual stuff then your games won't be as effective in communicating the intended experience.

If we take Silent Hill as an example, the team warped the sound of a dentist drill and weaved it into one of the audio tracks. Many people experience anxiety with the dentist, and that particular track capitalised on that.

ukpolitics,fdo6ifa,t1_fdo30xj,1578599744.0,"Adding language into a school curriculum, say at primary school level, doesn't mean that burnout would follow. Similarly, spending more time on something doesn't necessarily make the learner better at it. If anything, students memorise a lot in schools, and forget soon after.

On the contrary to what you said, adding language education into the school curriculum at an early age has been shown to [improve mathematical reasoning and problem solving](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1041608017302212)

Helping our brains develop through language learning would be beneficial and lead to better results as opposed to simply more maths (more of the same thing). Also, it isn't up to the school to determine or produce mathematicians. A student might be talented at maths but not necessarily want it as a career choice. On the other hand, they might fall in love with learning languages and be a translator."

gamedesign,fdgqolp,t1_fdgptfh,1578405807.0,"In the UK at least, the tuition would be the same as other subject areas, and a lot of game design jobs here are starting to specify a degree in game design. I've heard that in the US they're not too great except for a few, and I guess that's because the field is still relatively new.

It's a creative field, and therefore similar to other degrees such as Fine Art and Animation, but we don't have the same discussion on whether those degrees are worth it. Ultimately it's about your portfolio, and these days you can teach yourself most of what you need for the majority of subjects, but university is good for more than just the taught elements. It helps with structure and networking opportunities, in addition to the number of student based funding competitions such as Tranzfuser. There's also student industry placement opportunities that you can't access unless you're enrolled on a games degree.

So the cost is worth it for all the additional factors that university provides, and the above is just to name a few."

gameDevClassifieds,fcysqaw,t1_fcypwjd,1578086268.0,"If you want to learn programming then I wouldn't start with Unity. Since it's C# based you could start with console applications through visual studio. That will teach you to start thinking like a programmer without unity getting in the way.


If you want to think about gameplay without programming getting in the way, then I'd recommend an engine like Stencyl. Pretty active community, has a curriculum to follow as well that's free. 


Before I knew any programming I just used the RPGMaker VX software. When I moved to C# (console apps), I noticed that concepts from RPGMaker such as conditional loops/branches were programming concepts such as if statements and loops.


It's far better for you to start with one thing at a time. Learn a programming language first. Understand how to write simple programs. This will take you through the development process and have you learning as you go.


One of the most important things right now is for your programs to fail, because then you can learn why your code isn't working, and how to fix it. Understanding *why* something works is really invaluable, as in programming there's hundreds of ways to do the same thing.


For C# I'd recommend the [C# Yellow Book by Rob Miles](https://www.robmiles.com/c-yellow-book/). It's free and it's what I started with. Read the first 20 odd pages and take notes on everything. What a semi colon is and does, what static means, what a variable is etc.


Alongside this, try writing tiny console applications. A text adventure could be a good one. Other small programs such as getting the user to type their age to compare against some other value, a petrol pump that has a max amount of petrol to use of the user pays money (loop until the user can't anymore).


Understand some fundamental programming concepts are and write small programs to reinforce them.

Know:


* Variables

* logic (if statements)

* loops

* methods/functions

* arrays

* classes/objects (since C# is an OOP language)

**THEN** Jump into Unity and play around with it. Understand what a vector is, and get something moving on the screen. I recommend developing the basics of Space Invaders (player moving, enemies moving, shooting the missile). This will teach you colision detection as well, along with some score tracking, menus etc.

That's enough to get started with! Take it all step by step. Spend 3 or so months just full on with programming, and when you're ready, move on. Don't run before you can walk!"
