pitbulls,ffzck2a,t3_evzwj2,1580372278.0,Good for both of you.
dogpictures,ffs9mv7,t3_eur1b0,1580176515.0,Were you at a dog park?
TooAfraidToAsk,ffgldw6,t3_et8trl,1579908923.0,"I think its the complication of pneumonia that gets them. System fails all along the way: oh, just a cold, oh nope, its the flu, oh crap corona virus/ pneumonia! The danger seems to be if your immune system is compromised or you ignore symptoms. Plus, if it's  ubiquitous you're surrounded."
aww,ffgi9qr,t1_fffwb0k,1579906851.0,They absolutely are!
worldnews,ffgho0n,t1_fffhm3c,1579906458.0,"Thats very funny. Thanks!

It crossed my mind he may have meant it the way a hit man would take it."
politics,ffgfk3t,t1_fffoefb,1579905107.0,"Thinking is the key. She's not thinking. She's reacting to emotional manipulation. I wonder if her husband acted like DT in their marriage, would she recognize the evil?"
politics,ffgf9zi,t1_fff1pyp,1579904930.0,Pucker up. It seems hopeless. I'm so in despair over this massive moral failure I don't know what to do.
pitbulls,ffg4fba,t3_et0j5h,1579898233.0,"Lol!! Yes, yes they are!"
politics,ffek4t8,t1_ffd6hsn,1579851363.0,"Scary, thats my demographic and I loathe talking to them. I just dont get it, I really don't. I have a neighbor, Mensa card carrier, who is an absolute moron when it comes to Trump. He can't even articulate anything in his defense regarding why he supports him, other than parroting Fox et al.. I told him politics is off limits if he wants to talk to me. Everything I told him before Trump won, has become a reality and he still can't see he's up to his neck in a shitstorm of his own making. He'll vote for him again. Multiply him by millions and you have the nightmare if four more years, unless young people vote en masse to remove him. Do it, guys, I'm right there with you."
politics,ffejoc8,t1_ffe6yct,1579850791.0,"Sadly, I think that's true."
politics,ffeji4s,t1_ffd7hca,1579850579.0,"Seriously, everyone vote this maniac out of office.  Im not in the age demographic, but mentally I'm right there with you. I'm appalled that many in my generation gave this self centered, antipathetic piece of crap, along with his family,  the license to undo the moral and ethical ideals upon which the Constitution was based. Read the other post re: all the environmental rollbacks he's responsible for.   Four years damage will take four generations to fix. Not to mention he has stripped the members of his party,  by intimidation,  of any moral imperative they may have felt to uphold the Constitution.He's made lies truth,, facts- negotiable. He's destroyed the integrity of our political system and I dont know how we get it back. I know no current republican senator who can be trusted ever again unless they vote him out. They're bought and paid for....and you know what thay makes them."
politics,ffeito5,t1_ffdyph3,1579849755.0,"""Guys""....just hold up and wait for the serious age reality to hit you. It is like nuthin' else."
SweatyPalms,ffehc10,t1_ffeceq4,1579848024.0,"Thanks, Gubanater. That's what tempered the creepy for me. It kept nudging me away from focusing on the strangeness."
SweatyPalms,ffeh4z6,t1_ffecthi,1579847802.0,"Thanks, its there to see, I think."
SweatyPalms,ffebvgv,t3_et0j4d,1579842503.0,"Dont laugh, but there was a grace in how she used her hands,brushed back her hair....Her bone structure gives you a hint at how beautiful she once was. Then,  add the knife and the strangeness of the demeanor, and it just makes you realize what has been stolen from her by mental illness."
SweatyPalms,ffebjcm,t1_ffdy7bv,1579842196.0,"Boy, do I agree with that. No degree of judgment to read the dog's body language, many cops just shoot them. Just awful."
aww,ffea928,t1_ffe0vzd,1579841058.0,"Me too. Arrogancei will be humanity's downfall, and it is deserved."
dankchristianmemes,ffdx3cf,t1_ffdnx8d,1579831083.0,With a smirk on her face. Mary don't play...

AnimalsBeingDerps,ffdw5qc,t1_ffdly4n,1579830419.0,Yes. Awful...where is this? Asia?  Are they food??
rarepuppers,ffdvm85,t1_ffdqdwv,1579830034.0,Sounds like a shady breeder grandma. Glad your pup is now safe.
pitbulls,ffdvbqe,t3_et0j5h,1579829832.0,My pitties roll themselves in the blanket and refuse to get up unless the sun's out or they have to pee. I mean REALLY HAVE TO PEE...
politics,ffdus7v,t1_ffchemr,1579829444.0,Nice to read it.
politics,ffdomdj,t3_esvska,1579825323.0,Just assume everything said is the opposite and you're good to go.
politics,ffdofa0,t1_ffb40yn,1579825201.0,DeWine I mean.
ANormalDayInRussia,ffdm99z,t1_ffbuoca,1579823885.0,He needs to go to a sanctuary. Enough of this animals as entertainment crap. It's  abuse.
ANormalDayInRussia,ffdlyx9,t3_esrasa,1579823704.0,"Greta is already a moral powerhouse, a force for good.  Her bulk is her ability to speak truth to power."
politics,ffdlh33,t1_ffdl16c,1579823402.0,"Yes, I knew he did. Doesn't that just take any doubt away and confirm what a dark cynical SOB he is. It shows how he is contemptuous of his followers' stupidity and how he uses it to his advantage."
HumansBeingBros,ffdl3ut,t1_ffdkxl0,1579823176.0,Best hope for that good kid too.
