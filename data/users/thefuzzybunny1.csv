There are indications that the next day is a Friday (two college girls are both preparing for a date.) If it's Thursday when Kyle encounters this cop, then, it's probably the 17th of May. (Or, possibly, early in the morning on the 18th - could go either way, since the cop is on an overnight shift and not looking at his watch.) In which case, the Tech Noir shootout is on the evening of Friday the 18th, Sarah and Kyle flee the police station overnight into the 19th, and they have sex before sunup on May 20th.

That puts us much closer to the possibility of a full-term baby being born on February 28 of the following year."

FanTheories,ff9i30b,t1_ff9gwgq,1579713485.0,"Hmm, that puts things in a different light. There are two further complications to this timeline: first, the cop tells Reese that it's ""Thursday, May 12,"" but in 1984, May 12 fell on a Saturday. The opening titles say it's 1984, but that combination is impossible. The cop must be mistaken or lying about the date on which these events occur.

Second, in *The Sarah Connor Chronicles*, Sarah reminisces about John's birth. She describes having him in the jungle because she couldn't hike to a village in time. This suggests he was born earlier than she expected, which introduces the possibility that she miscalculated the date of conception. But it also establishes that John's birth certificate must've been issued some time after his actual birth. It's possible that when she made it to a consulate to report a US citizen born abroad, she had to take her best guess at his birth date because she had no witnesses."
FanTheories,ff92fh5,t1_ff8jtni,1579703183.0,"Your math doesn't rule out this fan theory. If Sarah and Porsche guy had sex on 7 May, the previous Saturday, then John Connor was born exactly 280 days after that.

I do think Reese is more likely to be the father, however, because he and Sarah probably had unprotected sex. As a sexually active college student in the 1980s, Sarah's preferred form of contraception would most likely have been the Pill - which, of course, must be taken daily. She doesn't return to her apartment after saying good night to Ginger, and loses her purse during the events of May 12-13 (I think she leaves it at TECH NOIR, but she may have left it at the police station.) Therefore she can't have had access to her pills on May 13. 

Furthermore, it's established that Kyle is a virgin and also trying *not* to make sexual advances to Sarah (witness how tensely he walks away from her and starts packing up weapons when she first raises the issue!) So when he went out for supplies, he wouldn't have bought condoms, if he even knows what those are.

Suppose Sarah had been casually seeing a man with a Porsche in the weeks leading up to the attempt on her life, but they practiced safe sex. Then she has unprotected sex with Kyle Reese. When she comes up pregnant, she'll naturally conclude Reese is the father."

It was downright bewildering when I was a kid, and my parents struggled to explain things in age-appropriate ways.

todayilearned,fevs77g,t3_eqlnu8,1579400834.0,"I think of this as an important reminder not to assume current entertainment trends will continue. For instance, let's think about a show that premiered during the heydey of TV Westerns and was inspired by them: *Star Trek.*

During *Star Trek*'s original run, it was not highly rated. In all three seasons (1966, 1967, and 1968), NBC's real ratings juggernaut was *Bonanza*. If you'd asked NBC executives in mid-1967, ""which of your shows will be the most influential?"" Or ""which of your shows will make the most money in syndication?"" Or ""which show are you proudest of?"" They all would've gone with *Bonanza*.

But now it's 2020. *Star Trek* basically took over US pop culture, is on its 7th spinoff, helped invent the concept of TV shows becoming movie franchises, has inspired world-changing inventions like cell phones, and even introduced new phrases into American English (""the final frontier"" did not always mean ""outer space""). And *Bonanza*... isn't available as a box set, isn't on streaming services, and has been largely forgotten by anyone born after 1970."

AskReddit,feunvsy,t3_eqies2,1579388367.0,"We have a family Bible. It is old, like 150+ years old. It has all our genealogy information in it: birth, death, and marriage dates for everyone on that side of the family.

For decades, it was in my grandmother's possession. Somewhere around 2009, my mom brought the Bible to our house (in another state) for me to look at. TBH, I've forgotten why - maybe I had a school project or was just interested. I didn't go to my grandmother's state as often as my mother did, so she brought it to us.

In 2014 my grandmother said to my mom on the phone, ""hey, the family Bible isn't in its usual place. Have you seen it?"" Mom says no. Mom mentions this to me. (I'd been away at college in the interim but was back at my parents' house because of a health crisis.) I said, ""well the last time I saw it, it was here in this house. What year was that, anyway?""

And my mom *swore* to me that she'd never brought the Bible to our house, or even our state. It had *always* been at grandmother's house and I had to be misremembering. When I insisted I'd seen it in our living room during high school, we called everyone - my father, sister, Grandmother, uncles - and nobody else remembered that Bible making a trip to my parents' state. Grandmother especially insisted that she never would've sent it that far away. If it had gone anywhere, it would've been to my great-aunt's house... 

Oh wait... The great-aunt whose children threw out all her sentimental stuff when she died?? So we called those cousins - they don't remember seeing that Bible anywhere. It actually caused a minor family feud because some people decided my black-sheep cousin must've stolen it.

More years go by. The TimeHop app is invented, and suddenly one day I'm looking at a Facebook status from 2009 in which I mention my mom bringing the family Bible to our house. I show my mom this contemporaneous written evidence, and now she's freaked out. She has no memory of this trip at all. We've somehow Mandela-effected each other. But if I'm right, then this Bible is somewhere in her house. So we tear the place apart. Closets, attics, desks... And nothing.

Another year goes by. My father is in our guest bedroom, moving around some books on the bookshelf. He's making room for a new book. He notices a white plastic bag on top of the bookcase, and looks inside to see if it's anything important. Then, he wordlessly walks into the kitchen and hands my mom her family Bible. It had been sitting in plain sight all along for 8 years... But how??? 

How did Mom forget it was ever at the house? Why would she stick it in the guest room? How did we miss it when we were looking for it? How did no one move anything on that bookshelf in 8 years?

Tl;Dr my memory and my family's memories completely diverged, and we lost a family heirloom for almost a decade before finding it hidden in plain sight."

My grandmother (the deceased's sister) swooped in and ensured that the widow and the kids were financially taken care of. My great-Aunt eventually remarried, happily. Their daughters grew up and lived normal lives and stayed close with their father's family.

It has been suggested to me that *Death Wish* would be an example of a female death being mishandled, because the murder of the wife plays like a cheap excuse for a man to get violent...and then stay that way for decades.

Would you recommend I watch the series to evaluate whether that interpretation is accurate?"

The cruise ship didn't even really know where, exactly, he'd fallen. And there were very few boats out there in any case. So the fact that a responding boat even found the guy is amazingly good luck.

It'd still be a moderately interesting story if this were any random civilian vessel. The fact that it was a party yacht full of an Oscar winner's personal friends is but one cool twist in a story full of kismet."
