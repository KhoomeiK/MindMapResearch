GoRVing,ffph4t7,t3_eucqnk,1580094916.0,"While researching campers to tow with our Ford Flex Ecoboost, we came across Ford's info on towing and how not only does trailer weight factor in, but your passengers, fuel, stuff.  That and the wind resistance of the trailer because a 3000 lb. boat has less wind resistance than a travel trailer.    


Our Flex Ecoboost is rated at 4500 lbs., but also has 355 hp and the towing package with transmission cooler.  As a family of five, we're comfortable in our highwall pop-up with a wet bath and slideout, but I can't imagine it would be safe towing a full-height travel trailer.  If we didn't have 350+ hp, even our pop up would be too large a load in my opinion.  Crosswinds on a travel trailer would make me uncomfortable.    


Sales people will try to make you fudge things however suits them, but they're not the ones living with the situation after the deal is done.    


I hear you when you say the Highlander isn't as comfortable on long trips.  Having compared passenger space between the Flex & Highlander, I'd agree the Odyssey would be more comfortable for passengers.  But, on the other hand, your Odyssey is going to have enough for its engine to do with a pop up."

funny,fescti6,t1_fes8cwu,1579363927.0,"Inefficient because why? Just wondering.  


Just wondering.  We tend to use forced-air-based heating.  It retains and transports heat to some degree, and they're not exactly complex, expensive or highly technological. Just duct around your house (almost always when it's built), with no need to insulate the ductwork inside the house and put a register where you do (e.g. under windows).  You can also use the registers as a place to dry your clothing on (as seen in the photo from OP).  


A 6"" duct does the job of transporting heat to a room differently than half-inch copper/plastic water pipe.  All you have to do is heat air through a heat exchanger and blow it with a big ass fan through the whole system.

They aren't often blocked by gloves unless you're intentional or plain careless and are very low maintenance.  In 20 years in my house, I've had someone out to repair one thing that wasn't caused by a bird building a new in the air intake."
