AskReddit,ffahisz,t1_ffaf7r1,1579735871.0,"I lived as an expatriate in Germany for 14 years (ex husband was German), and I truly appreciated the fact that if I had a life threatening illness it wasn't going to bankrupt me or make me homeless.  I was pleased with the level of care I got, and it took over 5 years for me to not be utterly shocked and get used to the fact that I could visit the doctor, receive the medications I need and I wasn't going to have to shell out thousands of dollars of out of pocket costs. i contacted pneumonia and was in a wonderful hospital with excellent physicians for 2 weeks and did not have to pay a penny. 


 Then I moved back to the good old USA and was diagnosed with cancer. It took me years to pay off the out of pocket costs.  I received about 10 ""Surprise!"" invoices for thousands of dollars a pop for ""out of network"" specialists at the same hospital where I received my treatment.  My total out of pocket ( and I have insurance) was about $25K and I feel very fortunate.  I am thankfully in remission now."

I imagine it's pretty expensive to run a sanctuary like this - do you have to be wealthy like Linda Mccartney to carry the costs ( food and vet care)?  Please don't flame me, I'm genuinely curious. I've wanted my own horse my whole life and even though i work myself to death and do well it's not possible because the maintenance costs make it unattainable. My lottery dream is a horse sanctuary.  Some farms discard animals the nanosecond they stop making money and I would love to be able to save them."

The nurses have always been the best part of any surgery or medical issue I've had.  You are my people and I'm grateful to you from my heart."

The actual therapy advice from my doctor, and printed in an AMA journal was - lemon drops and lemonheads to stimulate saliva.  I had a whole bunch of lemonheads during that time."

todayilearned,fbwkg3p,t1_fbwjhgd,1577152286.0,"My uncle contracted polio the year before the Salk vaccine came out.  He was 18, in the prime of his life, just starting University and in an iron lung for almost a year.  The March of Dimes paid for all his care.  He suffered his whole life from the remnants of the disease, but eventually could maneuver in a non electric wheelchair.(Electric ones were too pricey and there were no scooters.) He was truly a great man.  He earned a PH.D in public policy (his colleagues would carry his wheelchair up stairs because nothing was ADA compliant at that time.) and managed programs for the disabled for our state. He was an eloquent and fine man, who never let his disability slow him down. So anyone who is anti vaxx- as ridiculous as I think you are, i truly hope your child never has to suffer a moment  of what my uncle endured."
