Also intraspecies cooperation likely tampers the competition in mating."

todayilearned,fejtezb,t1_fejt1zz,1579185411.0,"I'm being hyperbolic. But social darwinism is a made up term with no real scientific backing. In fact most of the science actually flies in the face of social darwinism. Competition between species is pronounced, while competition for resources within a species is much more rare.

From Oxford dictionary :

>the theory that individuals, groups, and peoples are subject to the same Darwinian laws of natural selection as plants and animals. Now largely discredited, social Darwinism was advocated by Herbert Spencer and others in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and was used to justify political conservatism, imperialism, and racism and to discourage intervention and reform"

Since you mentioned you need more than most ppl recommend I wanted to be sure you weren't mixed up. I remember when I first bought seasme oil I wondered why it didn't have as strong as a flavor as I thought it would, when it was actually the cooking oil I had bought.

AFAIK they work the same just flavor is different"
