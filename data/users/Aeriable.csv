SuicideWatch,ffltthg,t1_ffl8b87,1580044103.0,Thank you! I try my best :)
raisedbynarcissists,ffjybtj,t1_ffflkua,1580010317.0,"Im glad I could make you happier. I'm not treated as if I matter either most of the time, but one thing that helps me keep going is a sort of joke-fact my friend once told me - ""It be like that.""

When something bad happens to me, I just tell myself that, and take control from there. Hope this helped :)"
Angryupvote,ffjwupb,t3_ettz8u,1580009146.0,Take my goddamn upvote.
roblox,ffjwffu,t1_ffiiul0,1580008805.0,Roblox: I heard you asked for more insanely overpriced Rthro? Say no more!
copypasta,ffjw8g9,t1_ffifkk8,1580008651.0,This is the most honourable post I've ever read by far and I don't know whether that's a bad thing or a good thing.
SuicideWatch,ffjvna9,t1_ffitqd7,1580008201.0,"I second this. I've also been in that shitty place and have also been thinking of dying from an age that was too early. Severe depression is no joke, and I've been through it. Luckily, I've been one of many who got help and got out of that shithole. Sure, it took time and I still contemplate whether I'm insane at times since I still suffer from some mental issues I can't quite pin, but hey, at least I'm not willing to take my own life anymore!"
AskReddit,ffdpvim,t3_esy6i5,1579826112.0,Upvote.
raisedbynarcissists,ffdlu34,t1_ffdfv4h,1579823619.0,"I definitely agree; except you aren't necessarily alone with your one friend with all of your problems. You can reach out to me to talk about something or just vent through this subreddit. Either way, I'm glad you got yourself out of a potentially horrible place."
robloxgamedev,ffd1mtd,t3_ess8au,1579811640.0,"Check your ""Move"" increment. That might be the reason why the part is created so far away."
raisedbynarcissists,ffd11db,t1_ffcub94,1579811305.0,"Incredibly proud of you for pulling this off, it isn't easy. Stay strong!"

blursedimages,ffan66x,t3_esjxbn,1579739878.0,"Ironically enough, they got ""illiterate"" right"
memes,ff7mlyt,t1_ff6pb3x,1579653167.0,Seriously impressive. Coming from someone who can't draw an outline for shit.
raisedbynarcissists,ff7lnr7,t1_ff7jhtn,1579652507.0,I've also had experience with narcissistic family members. The absolute minimum that you should do - regardless of how much it hurts - is to cut off all contact with them. Allowing them to call you and try to feast off of you does not help; I know from experience.
SlyGifs,ff1jp8n,t1_ff0k6te,1579480278.0,Yes.
LogitechG,ff1hs5w,t3_eqylne,1579479437.0,F.
roblox,fep4n5q,t3_eq51x9,1579312035.0,Looks amazing!
SuicideWatch,fec0y5d,t3_eo9o49,1578965027.0,I'll say this much; it is the pain and bullshit that you wish to end. Not your life.
raisedbynarcissists,fe5wi5k,t3_enpe96,1578876510.0,"Oh, yeah. I'm much better now though, mental health wise; but I still suffer from minor things."
SuicideWatch,fdp5tbl,t1_fdp4cv5,1578620679.0,"Yet they are directed towards you, and no one else."
Mirukuchan,fdp3kq3,t1_fdp2zwe,1578619176.0,I hope you aren't serious.
SuicideWatch,fdp30qs,t1_fdnsewm,1578618795.0,"It's a real shame. You seem like an innocent, genuinely great person. Funny thing is, I'm not the only one saying this, and if you really do off yourself, then the rest of us will forever live in pain and regret of not being able to convince you otherwise.

Listen, I've tried suicide 21 times last year. One of the attempts actually almost took me, but in the last few seconds, I've realised that what I'm doing really isn't worth it. I can push on, despite my (former) severe depression, anxiety, and overwhelming suicidal thoughts. And here I am now, in a significantly better mental state, trying my best to talk some sense into you.

Trust me on this; if I can do it, there's no reason you shouldn't be able to. After all, it is the pain and bullshit that you want to end. Not your life."
