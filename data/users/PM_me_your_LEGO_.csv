I'm still angry when I think about it 25 years later. No one else in the family had/has curly or wavy hair, and she just hated mine. Even now I still get told to ""Move your hair off your face"" and ""Only children wear their hair like that"" from her.

My mother did not understand my curly hair at all and insisted on tons of painful brushing and ripping out hair all the time. Detangle spray did nothing, and there were certain no paddle brushes used. I looked like Hermione in the first HP movie for most of my childhood.

As an adult, I remember this one girl in school who had gigantic blonde hair. It was huge! It was wavy and messy. And now I can look back and recognize that she too had a mother who brushed her curly hair."

I would always comment about how that isn't ADHD, it's just how brains work! They would respond that I probably have ADHD, hah. Then at the beginning of the year, my occasional therapist suggested I might have it, And later in the year, I took the steps to actually get diagnosed. At 32, this is a game changer. I got my meds yesterday and will try them this weekend (a history of adverse reactions means new drugs wait for the weekend).

I have my own home and I'm pretty under control in my life. But testing doesn't really care if you're successful. Psychological evaluations aren't there to see how well you succeeded; they're there to see what road blocks you have. 

My test was like and IQ test. it was quite a surprise to me. I have absolutely no idea how they got from that that I have ADHD, but it worked out. I now have a fancy new prescription that I'm going to try out this weekend.

explainlikeimfive,fcg7mks,t1_fcdozyq,1577637244.0,"TL;DR: Unlucky genetics at 32, but they lasered the area around the tear to stop it from progressing rather than other surgeries. Your eye can't feel anything, but its still a bit painful in your skull. It takes a week to heal and a few months for your eye to fully recover. Right now I have no restrictions from the doc but took myself off things like bumper cars and rollercoasters.

LONG story: I'm 32 years old, nearsighted, astigmatism, colorblind, and learned this year about lattice degeneration. It means that the retina and surrounding tissues are weak and more likely to tear. About 10% of people have this condition, and up to 1% of them will experience a tear because of it. It's genetic and often seen in clusters in families, although no one in my family has ever heard of it. Being nearsighted increase tear risk as it means the eyeball is longer and subsequently there is more pull on the retina. Also as the vitreous gel gets watery with age, it's no longer supportive, and can lead to the tear.

For right eye, about 10 days before I noticed the right tear, I played Whirleyball, but I've played it a dozen times with no issue. I noticed for a few days that my office lights were diffusing differently between my eyes but couldn't figure it out, then one day while driving home from work noticed that one eye was seeing more gray spots than sky. I got home, Googled it, freeeeeaked out, and called every ophthalmologist i could (all closed, obvs, although they do all have emergency lines fwiw). I emailed my manager and told her what was going on, and the next morning called around until i found one that was closest and would see me immediately. To their credit, every one of them was offering me a visit that day, some were just a lot closer than others or earlier appointments.


The appt was about 2 hours. Get there, get vitals checked, numbed, dilated, then wait an hour for it. The doc finally saw me, and very gently told me that i had a retina detachment and that he thought we should laser it instead of the other two options because they involve cutting into the eye, long recoveries, and will cause cataracts. Being 32, that's no bueno. The laser won't fix the detachment, but it will basically tack down the area around it to stop it from getting worse.

You know that machine they pull up at the optimist with the very bright light, and the doc looks at your eyeball? It was that, but with a laser. Like, they didn't even hold my head still, just numbed my eye again, but this lubed up glass lens against it, and went to town. Your eye doesn't have feeling inside, but the surrounding skull sure can feel when your eyeball is being cauterized. It also smells not great, and you get an instant migraine. Five minutes of laser was intense. ""Wow, most men can't even stand it the entire treatment."" 

""That's because women have a higher pain tolerance and i think I'm going to pass out."" Then they bright me juice and laid the chair down because apparently this is a common occurrence. I don't think i cops have taken it for another minute.

No reading, exercising, or being in a car (not just driving but even as a passenger) for several days after as it heals because rapid eye movements could disrupt the laser barriers. ""Better get some snacks because all your allowed to do is watch Netflix."" The TV distance means its not hard on your eyes during healing.

It took about 2 months for my iris in that eye to mostly contract again and my vision to return to normal. Distance is fine immediately (""You won't need an Uber; you'll be able to drive yourself home""), but like, i couldn't read my phone screen for a month with that eye, not totally clearly for a month after that. It still doesn't contact fully, but maybe someday. The floaters have mostly settled, although sometimes i get a cobweb here or there. I will now see the ophthalmologist every four months for as long as i have human eyes. The next time, it will be scleral band surgery in that eye. Ugh."
explainlikeimfive,fcd6dre,t1_fccsv8q,1577606918.0,"It's super normal to see small amounts as you age, maybe even a small cluster. You will probably only notice them looking at the sky or a blank document on your computer.

If you get a sudden onset of enough that they fill your entire field of vision or actually darken your vision from all the shadows, it's time to get to the ophthalmologist. I notice as well that there are so many, i can see their depths (lighter ones would be further from the retina as their shadow is lighter). They might also look like cobwebs or spots. That's how i noticed the first one as there are really no useful symptoms, like, say, pain.

If you notice a black curtain in your vision, your retina is detached. The floaters don't always mean a detachment, but that curtain sure AF does. 

Also if you catch it early enough, your doc might opt to just do laser like mine. It won't fix your retina, bit it'll stop the tear from getting worse, and it's a LOT less horrifying than the other surgeries.

Currently i have a big chunk of vitreous that's still attached to the back of my eye, just shedding these stupid cells like crazy, and the chunk mostly stays on the same part of my vision but also moves around with my eye of course. I can see the shadow as or whips around. My doc is keeping an eye on it (lol), but it's super annoying."
explainlikeimfive,fccs5ai,t1_fccglrt,1577601990.0,Can confirm: learned my retina was starving by a sudden onset of floaters. Get to the ophthalmologist that day if possible.
explainlikeimfive,fccj90v,t1_fccgehz,1577599028.0,"They are vitreous cells that have come up detached, and it's super common as we age. The vitreous is the gel inside your eye that gets more and more watery as we age, and subsequently, more of these cells are easily able to travel in it. You can't actually see them because they are between your retina and your lens, but they cast a shadow on your retina, and that's why you see them when you look at bright things like the sky.

If you suddenly see a TON of them, you need to get to an ophthalmologist immediately, like, that day as or could mean a detaching retina.
