teslamotors,ff9jyfu,t3_es78rk,1579714604.0,"Yeah the problem is that they are (mostly) the fastest car anyone has ever driven. They mess up doing 0 to 100, wreck, and of course don't want to take the blame. It is the same as someone who has never ride a motorcycle and then buys FZR-1000 as the first bike. Guess what happens next?"
