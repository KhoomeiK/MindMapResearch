mallninjashit,ff7rcsa,t1_ff6ypwo,1579656493.0,"Depends on what's taught. Things like anatomy and puberty make perfect sense to teach around 9-10. Some girls can start puberty as early as 9. Boys usually later around 11-12. You don't have to cover the in depth topics of sex like pregnancy stages and organ details. Simple stuff like what sex is, how pregnancy starts, disease, hormones and secondary sexual characteristics like hair growth and breast development.

dating_advice,fed3xmy,t3_eod7p2,1578997596.0,"Matched with a cute girl on Tinder and set up a coffee shop date. 


Show up to her place and she comes out with a windbreaker in her hand. Thought it was weird because it was like 100F and the middle of summer. I ask about it and apparently she uses it as a purse. Thought it was weird but I'm a sucker for a quirky girl so it was whatever. The shop is about 10 minutes away because of traffic and we get to talking, and by ""we"" I mean ""I"". Ask her the usual questions about work, she doesn't, school, she isn't in it, and social life, she just moved here. I said that must be hard to not really have friends in the area to keep you busy. She responds that she has a dinner date with someone else IN AN HOUR. So that soured my mood but I figured I'm already in the car, might as well finish this.


Get to the shop and she's a monster. Now in her profile picture she looked about 5'5 or so based on the counter in the photo that was about at the bottom of her ribs. She's at least 6 foot and way bulkier than her photo, she was I want to say 20 with full bingo wings. She was at least 50 pounds heavier, they must have been old photos or of someone else entirely. Her posture was weird too because her neck REALLY lurched forward to the point she had a large lump at the base of her neck. This is only worth mentioning because she looks absolutely nothing like her photos, I wouldn't be saying anything otherwise. 


Get into line but I don't drink coffee so I offered for her to go first while I look at the menu. This puzzled her and she got a small drink. After talking to a female friend I got that look because she expected me to pay for it. I'll pay for a date, but because I want to, not because it's expected.


 I got a small drink too and we grab a table in the shade and again she had nothing to contribute. We'd  text about anime, games and TV that we both liked. Now she has nothing to say. Try to talk about the anime she said she liked, but she didn't even finish the first season that had been out for a couple of years and the second was currently airing. Tried to bring up games but suddenly she hadn't played anything since she moved and this trend of nothing to say was to everything across the board. She gets on her phone after maybe 10 minutes at the table and I finish my drink. I say that we should probably get her back if she's going to make that dinner. 


I don't know why she was like this. My car was clean, I was well dressed and groomed, we'd had decent conversation before the date but she was so incredibly boring. I didn't say anything offensive either, kept it to topics we'd touched on in text that I wanted to elaborate on and see how well we'd connect. I told my GF about it when we talked about horrible dates we'd had in the past. Her best guess is she was just did it for free food."

Long story short a goose left its nest unattended and one of these suave gentlemen found lunch. This dude is just PACKING his mouth with as many of these little chicks as physically possible. He looks like a squirrel with cheeks brimming with little feathers and feet hanging out. Then mom comes home and he tries to dart but is dropping chicks left and right. He's trying to pick them up and run at the same time but that just makes him drop more like trying to get that sock with arms full of laundry. He made off with 3-4.

iamatotalpieceofshit,fe2ka1n,t1_fe291kq,1578839416.0,"100% no dude, that's not at all how that works. They were terrible parents. The kids would not listen to them at all for anything. They constantly caused trouble in the house breaking shit and fighting each other. Not the ""boys will be boys"" kind of stuff I mean they were vicious and would break anything nice the other one got. They never did chores, they outright ignored their parents and the grandma. They'd listen to more distant family sometimes but they had 0 respect for their parents. That's not testing boundaries, that's being an asshole. Testing a boundary would be staying up later than you should or out a little longer, watching a movie you were told not to, maybe leave the mall and come back before you're parents picked you up. Breaking things and getting into fist fights with family isn't testing a boundary. 


They did really well in school until high school where you plan your own classes and schedules. They started skipping a lot.

If you read the other parts of what I've said you'd remember I mentioned wearing revealing clothing like really short skirts. The point of revealing clothing like that is to be sexy and flirty. You shouldn't be surprised or upset if people look at you, that's the point of the garment. It'd be like me being angry that someone laughed at grumpy cat shirt I was wearing, it's the garments intended purpose. That's what I mean by bearing that responsibility, you wear something that's sexual you're going to be looked at.

ABoringDystopia,fcts8uq,t1_fctr6lu,1577956815.0,"I disagree. Origin stories tend to have simple but well constricted ideas. Thor learned to be humble and responsible. Spiderman of course with great power comes great responsibility. 


You don't have to have a character arc to tell a good character driven story. Captain America for example is what's called a flat character, he causes change in others. He changes iron man for the better and his struggle is to hold his beliefs against anyone and holds his ground for what he stands for. Captain marvel doesn't stand for anything. I mean I guess be skeptical could be a message but usually the message is said aloud in some way by a mentor character. Again look to spiderman with first his uncle telling him that with great power comes great responsibility, then tony stark telling him that if he is nothing without the suit he shouldn't have it. Thor had his power stripped of him and it wasn't until he was ""worthy"" would he be able to lift the hammer again. Captain marvel doesn't have ""that moment"" where their character shines like captain America jumping on the grenade or falsifying documents to try to be a soldier because he wants to fight ""bullies."" She didn't have a moment if enlightenment either like iron man who realized that he's built an empire on bodies and wants to change it. 


My original statement was akin to men in the movie being overwhelmingly negative interactions. The biker who's bike she steals after assaulting him, and the asshole ""you know why it's called a cockpit right?"" pilot stand out the most. The flash back guys of course too, her boss/leader dude. The only male positive characters are already established."
ABoringDystopia,fctpvic,t3_eim9fn,1577953411.0,"Why not both?


I don't buy new games anymore, the newest game I bought was DMC5 on launch and before that Dragonball Fighterz. Haven't bought a new game since then and I don't remember the last midnight release I went to, maybe Halo 5. Most games are broken at launch or nothing like advertised. My disappointment in Halo 5 is immeasurable. The whole industry is profit over everything else. Any half decent game gets a remaster on each console that comes after it too.


As for ""feminism is destroying gaming"" yeah kind of. Any story that is ideology over substance is terrible though. You can have a compelling story about race or gender and you can have powerful women, but they need to belong in the story. Most these companies don't actually care about the message, they are just shoving shit in so they can say there is a message. 


Take Captain Marvel vs. Black Widow for example. Black widow is just a human, but she's fucking bad ass. She does as much as she can with what she's got. She's smart, she's capable, and fun to watch. Captain marvel however is an example of what companies THINK is a powerful woman. She's literally just powerful. She doesn't have a characteristic outside of she's powerful. When she was human we were told she was a capable pilot and pushed herself to the max. However it pushed so hard at the ""men are the problem"" part that it split the audience so half still think it's ""you go girl"" and the other thinks she's just a bitch. The Montage at the beginning I find hilarious because it's a bunch of dudes telling her ""you can't do the thing"" She tries anyways then fails. Not only that but she has no weaknesses. She wasn't in the last 2 marvel movies really because she blew up an invasion fleet by herself like it was nothing. That's not fun to watch. Superman has the same problem but that's why they focus not on IF he can win but if he fights for the right reasons. It's why Goku will never beat him. Goku is written to challenge himself and become better, Superman is written to win but to challenge his humanity. Captain marvel is written to always win, but that's it, she had no struggles or growth."
