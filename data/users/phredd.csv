If they don’t recover 100% of the loan that you had outstanding, they will sue you for the difference in a couple of years. It takes a little bit a time and you’ll get calls from collections. If you must walk away from the house do not ignore collection calls and try to work with them otherwise you will be sued and that’s no fun trust me."
