When herd immunity requires an overwhelming majority to adopt the vaccine, every single person who chooses not to vaccinate does have a direct, measurable, negative effect on their local population."

news,fcaz0uh,t1_fcawkuw,1577579422.0,"> You have a comparable risk of drowning

Are you deliberately conflating ""risk to yourself"" with ""risk to others?"" I've probably stated in every comment that mandating vaccinations has nothing to do with one's own personal health.  You are free to risk drowning, but you are not free to risk drowning others.

>There is nothing reasonable about worrying about someone who is not sick or otherwise infected getting you sick. Spontaneous generation was debunked over 350 years ago.

This is either a deliberate mischaracterization of the issue or indicative of a profound ignorance of viral epidemiology.

Please [read this](https://www.vaccines.gov/basics/work/protection).

> But again, how much? 

The time-honored standard of ""reasonable belief.""  Why do you think that your poor understanding of how vaccines work has any bearing on how reasonable of a threat it is compared to the insistence of everyone who has any post-secondary or terminal education on the subject?

>Waving the gun is illegal, sneezing on someone is not.

Deliberately sneezing on someone is definitely assault."

The government, by definition, governs.  It is the arbiter of concerns which exist at the societal scale.  Vaccination is not a matter of personal health, it is a matter of societal health.  There's a pretty obvious distinction between this and swimming in a ""teaspoon of water.""

>Punishment happens when harm is done, not prior.

The harm is failing to vaccinate your child.  Victims need not be harmed to be victims of your actions, but merely the reasonable belief that they could be harmed is enough.  e.g. reckless endangerment, terrorist threats, verbal assault, etc.

Reckless endangerment in particular clears up your misunderstanding:

>The accused person isn't required to intend the resulting or potential harm, but must have acted in a way that showed a disregard for the foreseeable consequences of the actions

There is a clear precedent for setting consequences upon people for risking harm to others, and not being vaccinated is a clear and well-known risk with far-reaching effects to both lives and livelihood."
