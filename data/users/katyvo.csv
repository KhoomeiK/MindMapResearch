politics,fg07bn7,t1_ffz1urw,1580401782.0,"I read Atlas Shrugged. I can think of a few better uses of my time, like being run over by a car."
rarepuppers,ffvu2dm,t1_ffun997,1580273266.0,You know those long brushes people use in the shower to scrub their backs? I bed they'd love those.
fulbright,ffv0knd,t3_evbbym,1580252937.0,"A friend of mine is a researcher, not an ETA, so take this with a grain of salt. He's taking classes in Germany. I think it depends on the school you're placed into - some will be more time heavy than others."
velvethippos,ffuzb2t,t3_ev8qod,1580252223.0,"OP, what are you going to do for her 6th? Big and blocky as Pittie heads are, I don't think there's much real estate for another. A unicorn horn maybe?"
Justrolledintotheshop,ffpkln4,t1_ffkwvrl,1580097320.0,"My state stopped doing stickers two or so years ago, so my plate still has its 18 (maybe, unsure and I'm not putting on shoes to check) sticker."
succulents,ffpj0nm,t3_euefh2,1580096198.0,Yep! A lot of crassulas like to branch out like that.
velvethippos,ffosmbk,t3_eu7z0w,1580081189.0,"Aww, poor hippo. Mine looks absolutely distraught when he's in the bathtub and then immediately gets extreme post-bath zoomies."
wholesomememes,ffi3yem,t1_ffhrrh6,1579964393.0,"I've trained him to jump off of the bed when I snap my fingers. If I have to get up before it's morning (usually before 6 or 7 AM), he'll just look at me when I snap my fingers, so I'll clamber around him. Then, as soon as I've touched the doorknob, the previously immovable pup jumps off of the bed and follows me."
wholesomememes,ffhebid,t3_etlp2n,1579931749.0,"My dog will refuse to get out of bed when comfortable, so I've learned how to leave without disturbing him too much. Problem is, as soon as I leave, he jumps down too and follows me to make sure everthing's okay. Even if I tell him to stay, he doesn't want to.

It means he gets tucked back in, which I find adorable and he seems to enjoy, so I'll take it."
succulents,fffnxtb,t3_etd6jq,1579888026.0,It's so cool to see what were once parts of my plant enjoying life so far away!
rarepuppers,ffflspj,t3_et9j03,1579886722.0,My dog will purposefully dig his nails into my thigh if I don't pay immediate attention to him. No shame in his case.
velvethippos,ffexc7w,t3_et0qc5,1579869283.0,Hippo wiggles are some of the best wiggles! Give her a boop for me? :D
fulbright,ffc0kd4,t3_esj7as,1579788444.0,"If you haven't committed any form of misconduct, you should click ""no,"" so you're good. For the US at least, I think misconduct is a legal judgement that isn't a minor traffic violation (e.g. theft)."
mildlyinteresting,ffbvtu7,t1_ffbal6r,1579784456.0,You don't have to weave around them as much if they're folded up like you would with more obtrusive chairs.
mildlyinteresting,ffb103k,t1_ffb0cyg,1579749118.0,I've never actually been to Kansas.
mildlyinteresting,ffatrkk,t1_ffarwih,1579744299.0,"The old ""hit the desk with your forearm and jiggle it around"" test looks dumb, but one of the desks I tried it on fell and cracked me in the knee.

My laptop is still safe, though, and that's more important. My right leg's already messed up anyway, so the sacrifice is more than worth it in my book."
mildlyinteresting,ffat39x,t1_ffasl9r,1579743851.0,"That is, if economy seats could fling themselves at you when you tried to leave. That's probably in development."
mildlyinteresting,ffar3rc,t1_ffaoi5g,1579742524.0,"If you don't move fast enough, the edge will smack the back of your thighs."
