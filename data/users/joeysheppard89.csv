pens,ffie62h,t3_etrkko,1579971724.0,Wow what a lucky find! Not very good at the whole pen identifying thing but not bad at feeling slightly jealous haha enjoy...
fountainpens,ffhvq6y,t1_ffhq8je,1579956101.0,"Ah OK.  Fair enough.  Thanks for the feedback.  I've got a X450 and was wondering if it was worth getting a 600 nd giving it a try.  I don't mind a bit of top heaviness - being a lefty it gives me a little more control somehow. 
Thanks again"
fountainpens,ffhq4cr,t3_etormm,1579947931.0,How do you rate the Jinhao 500? Was looking at this exact pen yesterday on Amazon and love the look of it.  Is it nice to write with?

Only a couple of months? ? My gosh.. Well if that isn't inspiration to practice then I don't know what is!
I'm still a bit of a noob to fountain pens.  I goty first one last week a Jinhao X450 standard nib.  I just googled all the different nibs you can get for fountain pens though.  Thanks for the info.  Had no idea haha.
Please post more :)"
