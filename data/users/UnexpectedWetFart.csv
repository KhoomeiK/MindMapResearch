AmItheAsshole,ffaip0t,t1_ffae89g,1579736675.0,True but people who buy it as an investment because they think they might win one day are truly dumb and should be taught statistics.
AmItheAsshole,ffab8wb,t1_ff9yflu,1579731510.0,Buying a lottory ticket once a month or once a year is stupid too. Its basically destroying your money.

"" the great delusion of an addict is the idea that somehow someday he can control and enjoy getting high. ""  


Yeah that's so true, the longer i went sober, the more i forgot about this, its good to be reminded of.  


I hope you are doing ok now, best of lucks !"

physicaltherapy,ff4d6da,t1_ff4b4qi,1579560821.0,"I just disagree with you when you said "" While sources and evidence is great, you can also use clinical experience and reasoning to look at the usefulness of a treatment. ""  


This is wrong, you should not do that. There is no ""logic"" in medecine, you can't use theory or experience to create a treatment, it needs to be backed up by quality studies or its no different than homeopathy."
BobsTavern,ff49z2g,t3_erkldr,1579558769.0,I like it but this will probably make Jaraxus pretty op since you start with one extra minion and the most usefull one for demon comp which is already a pretty good way to get at least top 3-4 in most cases
physicaltherapy,ff49o5t,t3_eri1p2,1579558580.0,"Well I think you figured it out already but no I don't think there is any real evidence showing that it does anything particuliar beside placebo (Would love to be corrected if someone post grade A B or C  recommendation studies).  
 If you are already questioning if its placebo you won't benefit from it so don't do it if you don't want to, massages and cold showers are probably better AND with actual research backing it up.  


Also ignore every one trying to convince you because of their ""expert opinion"" and ""clinical evidence"" those two are literally the worst forms of evidence..

rickandmorty,fet654d,t1_fess0cj,1579372156.0,"I get what you are saying, but you THINK you get good sleep. In reality you don't get as much rem sleep as someone sober (people who quit smoking realise once they quit that they start dreaming a lot more, you dream when you enter rem cycle).  


It's like alcohol really, if you drink before bed yes it will help you fall asleep faster but it's not a regenerative sleep, more like being knocked out."

BobsTavern,fe46nss,t1_fe3zbvt,1578856257.0,Why ? You just loose 2hp in first round then round 2 you can buy a demon (best) or another wrath weaver (which can tie or at worst you loose another 3hp) and then you have the strongest early game assuming you dont get mega unlucky and dont see a demon ( its rare because there are already 2 demons in tier 1)
