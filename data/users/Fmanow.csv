Also, getting to the playoffs is the ultimate goal for this season, after the last 6 seasons. But Lakers are at best the 3rd best team in the league and that’s a generous statement.

freefolk,fezebj2,t1_fezd17t,1579456485.0,"Are you for real dude. I’m the one not looking at this objectively? Does it look like I fell into the hive mentality hate that so many did on this sub. I already told you S8 has flaws, but I didn’t hate it cuz the next asshat on this sub hates it. Does it seem like I’m afraid of downvotes by telling the entitled little shits (I’ll use that instead of cunt today) to fuck off. You go on hating, but I expect when people grow up on this sub, they’ll realize how silly they were. This sub has become a live action blunder years."

I’ll keep it civil, although my comments will get downvoted by the asshats on this sub. GoT gave you at least 6 amazing seasons of unparalleled entertainment, show some respect for DD. You want to piss on someone, piss on GRRRRM for not finishing the books. This was always a book adaptation. Obviously Jorge wrote himself into a corner and just gave up, and DD tried their best to land this juggernaut. Nobody is saying S8 is without flaws, but get over it."
