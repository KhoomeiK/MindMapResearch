And with regards to meeting new people - it involves taking you out of your comfort zone and trying new things and being open minded. 

I would still swap places with you in an instant. Youth is something you cant get back - money is replaceable. I didnt grow up rich either. I basically (off and on) crashed at my parents whenever i was out of funds. I tried a few things off and on and tried to get stuff going. Eventually i took it seriously and things took off from there. I’m not saying its easy; i’m just saying its doable. Time is on your side :)"

Here’s some tips: its not always about money. Find something you really love to do or *something you excel at*. Take it seriously and you might find that you’ll be rewarded for it. 

23! You’re at the age where its really easy to meet people, make new friends, and take risks! Do it! It seems like your parents have your back so right now is the best time to take a risk."

AskReddit,fetzgwd,t1_fes8jej,1579381572.0,"Unpopular opinion, but i dont see the fuss about parasite. Its a decent film but is it worth all the accolades? Maybe it speaks to the lack of “makes you think” symbolic movies in the US in 2019. Its not uncommon in korea, though. 

I thought parasite was good but not “film of the year” good. A lot of the camera work and genre shifting is pretty common in korean cinema as korean filmwork and technique is pretty high quality imo. 

I do suggest watching more foreign films! And going in blind is definitely helpful. I do that with most films i watch these days."
