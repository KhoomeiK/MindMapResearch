You come from a good place, but I think this needs to be addressed and if they decide not to do anything then I'd maybe call CPS and ask them if there's anything to do..."

If it was something that was necessary, that would've been different, but it wasn't, it was luxury. A luxury they don't even have. My parents would NEVER act that way. They gave me everything I needed and they still help me even at 27 years old. They never asked for anything in return, because that's how parents should behave (when they can afford to). If you make a kid just so they take care of you later/to use them/their cash, then you're not doing it for the right reason."
