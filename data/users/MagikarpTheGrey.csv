therewasanattempt,fepvxnv,t1_feoobe0,1579333239.0,"I was expecting a source because while logical, that makes as much sense as any other possibility (e.g. the subject in the clause hypothesis like in French) and is prescriptive grammar trying to justify itself by internal reasoning, which is not an accurate method in linguistics.
You also seem to forget that while the words may not be in order, a relative clause has the elements of a complete sentence. ""I see the man"" is a complete sentence. 
That is why a good source would be appreciated, or a redirection to a grammar of reference in English (like Merriam-Webster but for syntax, grammar, etc.)"
therewasanattempt,feoe90m,t1_feoapk8,1579298947.0,"Yeah, but when it is the object of the main sentence or in the relative clause? Like, is it *whomever I see will be chosen* or *whoever I see will be chosen*?"
therewasanattempt,feo9d9t,t1_feo84zp,1579296866.0,"Isn't it ""whomever"" when the pronoun is the object of the verb it introduces (like ""I challenge whomever it may concern..."")

Edit: non native speaker here. I did a bit of research, and grammars are inconsistent whether the pronoun has to be the object in the main sentence or in the relative clause, since they apply the ""him/he"" indifferently, in cherry picked examples and without a great deal of method. In French the pronoun takes the case of the function in the relative clause but I don't know if it's the same in English."
