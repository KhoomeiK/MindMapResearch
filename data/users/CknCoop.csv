EDC,fewnrmm,t1_fewnj8t,1579416091.0,Thanks! It’s been my favorite pistol I’ve ever had to date. The modularity of the P320 is awesome since I can run the XCarry grip which is way better imo. Sig is really doing some awesome stuff.
EDC,fewnaka,t1_fewmyqq,1579415556.0,"I guess I didn’t specify all that well. The Apex trigger is just the trigger. This is a P320 (not the Xcarry, I just have the Xcarry grip) so I wanted a flat face trigger. Since the Carry has a curved trigger I swapped just the Sig trigger for the Apex flat trigger.

Long story short, the trigger pull is the same weight, maybe ever so slightly lighter if you pull from the bottom of the trigger, but all of the springs and the trigger bar and everything else is all Sig components except for the trigger itself. 

I agree with you, for my range pistol I like a light, crisp trigger, but on a carry gun not so much."
