overlanding,fdzupqe,t1_fdzmbc6,1578796240.0,"SHOW NOTESThe complete article is available here: [https://expeditionportal.com/the-10-commandments-of-modifying-an-overland-vehicle/](https://expeditionportal.com/the-10-commandments-of-modifying-an-overland-vehicle/)

“An overland vehicle is not perfect when you have added the last possible modification, but when you have taken the last possible modification away. ” –our adaptation of [Antoine de Saint-Exupery’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_de_Saint-Exup%C3%A9ry)  famous quote

After a few trips around the world and crossing all seven continents, these are the lessons we have learned (mostly the hard way) about properly modifying your overlanding vehicle for adventure travel.

**1) Complexity is the Enemy:** Keep the vehicle as simple and reliable as possible, minimizing the number of systems and variables that can fail in the field. Adapt only as required for the vehicle to perform in the environments and conditions expected in your route. Consider the engineering performed by the OEM manufacturer, and how all of the factory systems interrelate. The vast majority of failures we see to 4WDs ae aftermarket modifications, and of those, electrical and engine system modifications are the most prone to failure.

**2) Weight is Also the Enemy** Keep the vehicle as light as possible, removing heavy items that provide limited value, are purely aesthetic, or are never used. ***The goal should be to stay under 90 percent of GVWR***, which will ensure the best performance in technical terrain, particularly snow and sand. “Stuff” is always a reflection of experience and training. The more experienced, well-traveled, and well-trained the traveler, the less stuff they carry, and the fewer modifications they need.

3) \*\*Suspension Performance\*\* The suspension system, geometry, and handling with a load are a reflection of proper design. The vehicle *must* perform just as well on pavement as it does on the dirt. A suspension serves several critical roles, including emergency handling (think avoiding a deer or child that runs into the road), load carrying, and technical terrain performance. Who cares if you can achieve a 1000 in the ramp travel index if the truck rolls at speed on a dirt road. The suspension should also be robust, with quality shocks and durable components. Properly configured, a modern vehicle should be able to manage technical obstacles and also exhibit predictable and safe handling during high-speed dynamic inputs.  Remember to tune the suspension to your travel load, including the spring rates and lengths, along with compression and rebound valving. This video shows what is possible with a lifted overland vehicle on 35-inch tires, fitted with a proper suspension.

**4) Keep the Engine Stock** This is the most common mistake we see with vehicle preparation: dozens of little modifications to the engine, including changes to the ECU, headers, cold air intakes, aftermarket turbochargers, etc. These all seem like a great idea until you need to repair one of those items in the middle of the Gobi Desert or find a replacement belt in Uganda. Certainly, there are proven or even mandatory upgrades that address known failure modes of the factory components, but otherwise, leave the engine mods to the tuner crowd. If the environment you are traveling in demands a certain amount of power (like sand) then buy the right truck with the right engine to start with.

**5) Isolate and Minimize All Electrical Modifications** 

**6) Use High-Quality Tires with an Appropriate Tread Pattern**

**7) Avoid Roof Loads** 

**8) Self-Recovery** 

**9) Secure the Load** 

**10) Quality and Design Over Quantity** 

***Simplicity and reliability is the key to vehicle preparation for long-distance adventure travel.***"
overlanding,fdzcxt2,t1_fdz4ony,1578789051.0,"So it starts with WANT or NEED. If the driver wanted the mods then discussion over. If its was a need then why? Can you get repairs parts around the world or easily repaired. 

 Also the discussion was geared to overland across multiple countries vs. off roading.
