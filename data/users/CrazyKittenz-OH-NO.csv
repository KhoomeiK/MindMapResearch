questions,fffz5ry,t1_ffevoxu,1579894984.0,"Dude, I was just saying people are bitches. I want saying my life was so horrific and horrible and bad and shit, I was just saying people are mean and rude and you can’t change that. Yes I have anxiety, depression and self harm, and yes I want them to get help and I encourage them to, but I can’t make them. I’m sorry that so you were so offended by my comment that I thought was common sense, but yes, they deserve help for whatever they need. So please, this making me feel like shot so just stop. I know you think I’m making them feel like shit but you are proving my point that people are horrible. The human race is horrible. That is just that."
