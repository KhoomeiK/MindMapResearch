relationship_advice,fdy6sew,t3_en8vr8,1578776675.0,"You are definitely right to be upset, anyone would be in that situation. Sex is about pleasuring both parties and that’s especially important in bdsm. Sex isn’t “just like that sometimes”, it should be comfortable and enjoyable for everyone involved and that includes in bdsm. 
It looks to me like your wife is abusing you, it’s not healthy to stay in a relationship like that ( for you and for her) so either you have to change the relationship or just break it off. 
I understand that it’s hard to make a good decision when you feel this much pressure, just remember to stay strong and that sometimes the best decision is the hardest one to make."

So yea, cutting them off was def the right choice."

wholesomememes,fdsav8q,t3_emtoc1,1578698368.0,"Hey, thanks for posting this.
It honestly took me years to make me realize that it’s worth doing things just because they make me happy. Whenever I wasn’t working  I felt that I was lazy and procrastinating, I’d beat myself up over it until I went to work again.
I’m glad to say that I’m in a better place now, this post just kinda reminded me of how far I’ve come.
Thank you OP (:"

You have the right to use whatever’s the most comfortable for you and if she doesn’t get it that’s on her. Fuck the system! Buy some tampons!

That man needs to learn how to take care of himself!! He can’t honestly expect others to pay for him/house him his entire life. He’s an entitled man child who should have run out of chances years ago!"
