However, just hurling insults at internet strangers isn't making you look smarter, it just makes you look insecure and childish. I get it, I used to do it to, the internet makes angry keyboard warriors out of all of us, but it's all good mate, no one is insulting you, and you don't need to try to insult others. That's not a good way to dialogue. I'm not ""running away"" I just don't have time to waste energy with internet strangers who want to try to insult me, I'm way beyond that in my life. 

I grew up on a livestock farm, we even had sheep. Ten years ago I would have vehemently written anti-PETA _anything_ and spent a lot of emotional energy on it. But you know what? It's not worth it, you'll be much happier if you just relax, have friendly dialogue wherever possible, and open your mind up to new information and realize it's totally OK to be wrong! That's how we grow and progress! I _love_ being wrong because it means I'm learning! 

As I said before, it took me about five seconds to google it, and it was the very first link. It would have been very easy to copy and paste what I put to verify that it's sourced and I didn't just make it up. Google will give you that answer in less than a second. But seeing as you need me to link you to it rather than check it yourself, [here it is](

OK 

Again: 

Official Statement from the American Society of Animal Science Board of Directors: 

> The excess wool impedes the ability of sheep to regulate their body temperatures. This can cause sheep to become overheated and die.

I'm not sure what part you're not understanding, but you're starting to be condescending to internet strangers rather than just admit that you were wrong. For that reason, I'm out. Maybe someone else can explain it to you if you need any further explanation."
facepalm,fdk42bj,t1_fdk19qa,1578495548.0,"Just to remind you of your argument: 

> It's not an excess of wool that causes heat exhaustion in sheep. Have you ever worn merino wool? It's an extremely good insulator against heat as well as cold. This protects sheep from temperature extremes, which is why they can be farmed in the [...] hot outback of Australia. If anything, the wool works to their benefit."

hockey,fdibdst,t1_fdi4k96,1578439160.0,"Messi is pretty darn fast. It's his pace combined with his lower centre of gravity which allows him to turn quicker than others leave so many players for dead. Not to mention his footwork in close, comparable to McDavid's hands in tight, that said, Zidan's footwork was incredible as well. Zidane was absolutely known for his vision of the game, in that sense I'd compare him more to a Gretzky, whereas Messi's strategy seems to often be, give me the ball, I'm going to run at those five defenders, somehow come out with the ball and then chip the keeper. 

You make good points though, I can see what you're saying, I think I'll respectfully disagree. Imo, Zizou and Gretz are a much closer comparison to each other and McDavid and Messi are more similar."

facepalm,fdgra10,t1_fdgnlev,1578406271.0,">Prove your claim.

Firstly, maybe you should prove your claim? 

Secondly, it took all of about 5 seconds to google ""does extra wool cause sheep to overheat?""

Here you go: 

Official Statement from the American Society of Animal Science Board of Directors

> As long as there are sheep, shearing must be practiced for the health and hygiene of each individual animal.
Unlike other animals, most sheep are unable to shed. If a sheep goes too long without being shorn, a number of problems occur.

>1. The excess wool impedes the ability of sheep to regulate their body temperatures. This can cause sheep to become overheated and die."

If you're completely behind a player like that and get your stick up like that you're asking for trouble in today's NHL. Don't get me wrong it was a very soft call, but rather than be annoyed at the refs we need to stop blaming them and realize this was Drai's play (or lack thereof) that led to that scoring chance and put Klefbom in that position. 

https://imgur.com/a/LFtkfPP Kinda hard to screenshot with the source I was using but you can see where Klef's stick gets up on the gloves of Eichel there."
