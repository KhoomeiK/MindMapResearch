StopSpeeding,feior2q,t3_eoy7lp,1579143493.0,"Personally, smoking trees helps me forget about stimulants. It's honestly keeping me sober and sane. 

Just be careful though, weed is still a drug and if kept unchecked it can go downhill. But a few bowls a week is fine with me."
StopSpeeding,feiogmw,t3_ep3ijx,1579143300.0,"I feel your dilemma, dude. I always tell myself that I'll be responsible with my drug use, that I won't binge or overuse. But I always do. I have no self-control when it comes to stimulants. 

So I made the decision to never use again. I can't trust myself. It's a little sad when I have no confidence in my self control, but hey, its keeping me sober.

Also, think ahead. When I used, my high was temporary and usually always followed by shame, self-loathing and anger towards myself. Nobody wants an emotional rollercoaster."
StopSpeeding,feinhzk,t3_epc086,1579142666.0,"Not sure if this is true or not, but it's worth trying out.

Someone once told me that whenever you have a craving, it's your body wanting some dopamine. So, to satisfy your craving, do something rewarding that will satisfy that craving. For example, if you are wanting to use, drink a Pepsi instead."
