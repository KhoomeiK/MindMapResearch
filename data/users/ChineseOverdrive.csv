electricians,ffq4m15,t1_ffp0gfr,1580120187.0,"The white switch leg in the box of the first light in the chain will likely have a band of black tape around it. It is very common for just a two wire romex to be dropped to a switch with black being the hot or white being the switch leg, or vice-versa. Fortunately, the 2011 NEC changes (Section 404.2(C)) mandates that a neutral now be provided to any box that switches lighting loads regardless of it being needed at the time."
electricians,ffouyty,t3_eudjj9,1580082085.0,"Unfortunately, as u/tucker181 pointed out, there is no neutral in either of your switch boxes. It's looking like your 2-wire romex (black/white) is bringing in your voltage via the black wire, landing to the common (black) screw on your first three-way switch. The red and white in your 3-wire romex are acting as your travelers and the black in the 3-wire romex is your switch leg, which is tied to the white wire in the 2-wire romex via a wago connector. I know this doesn't help your current situation but figured explaining what exactly is going on might help you understand your situation better.

Lutron Caseta smart devices work without needing a neutral wire but their stuff can get a little spendy. Hope this helps."

cincinnati,ffi3ugr,t1_ffi2snp,1579964301.0,One of the local news reports here had the pastor at Eastgate Crossroads going to bat for Evans on account of his generosity to the church and was trying to convince the sentencing judge to go easy on him.
cincinnati,ffhzv5i,t3_etjonh,1579960705.0,"If you give Crossroads enough money, they will push for you to receive a less-strict sentencing when you are convicted of fraud. Just ask Doug Evans."

Mio's Pizzeria on the corner of Clough and 8 Mile is close to Eastgate and has a nice atmosphere and is reasonable. My first choice for something unique close to Eastgate would probably be Laszlo's, though."

He never finished his BS (in chemistry) due to enlisting in WWII and I don't believe he completed his studies until after his selection into Project Mercury. That said, dude had a preternatural sense for flying and his exclusion from the program would have been a terrible mistake given his ability to handle crippled aircraft."

vinyljerk,fdyfj70,t1_fdxu2we,1578779224.0,"Probably because it is a double album and a song cycle at that, meaning it takes a degree of commitment to listen to. It's not exactly an album that you got drunk or high back in the day only to decide to set the stylus on a random instrumental."

It helps delay the onset of corrosion should moisture find its way into a fixture. I see no reason to do it in any other situation, though.
