JoeRogan,ff4itpa,t1_ff4ep1u,1579564644.0,"It served you well to have that attitude but it doesn’t work that way for everyone, your circumstances are unique that may have allowed you that attitude. Maybe you don’t have a wife or kids or elderly parents to take care of, maybe you had a good education and good up bringing and no one around you suffered from drugs, alcohol, or violence. Maybe you learned some life lessons early on, or had parents and guardians to teach you that, and had the support of parents and friends when you failed at something or didn’t get that job. 

There’s so many factors and for you to say it served well is true for you, but that’s not the case for everyone.

It’s not a defeatist mindset I am trying to put out or win, winning isn’t the point here, but to point out a bit more grey and nuanced in that, it’s simply not about having a right mindset will overcome anything.  If you don’t have the right environment around you too and people and the necessary education or support, they can’t develop that attitude or have the time to think about it. 

Many Americans lack even these basics and to say just have the right mind set will overcome anything, because it worked for me, is simplifying a much more complex issue for people being able to change their lives.  That’s the point I am hoping to express"

Not every business needs to hire 100 new people but just 10 as it’s their capacity or what they can afford, so 90 people lose out on a great job. 

Also banks might not give them the loan they need or that corporations outcompete them or in some cases sue them under the pretense for a similar model of business or product until they can’t afford legal fees and close.
