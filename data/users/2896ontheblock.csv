socialanxiety,fe0hyiy,t3_enetc9,1578813719.0,I think it’s better to just accept that that’s how your brain feels and try to look at it from the 3rd person.
socialanxiety,fdpljqb,t1_fdpiwva,1578632005.0,"My point is that if you have the willpower to overcome the avoidance consistently then you don't even need any of the benefits of exposure therapy because you can just use willpower anyway.

Also the effects of exposure therapy are temporary (atleast from my experience) and if you have a bad day and give in to avoidance you are going to start declining back to your baseline anxiety level. So it seems you're relying on willpower either way."
