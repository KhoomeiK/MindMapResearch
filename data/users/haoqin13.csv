aww,fehxzfo,t1_fehiijd,1579126116.0,Yeah it's pretty unreasonable. And thanks :)
aww,fehhvfi,t1_fehhbhb,1579116857.0,I'm training her to only bark when she needs to go outside. We live in a crowded apartment complex and I don't want anyone to report us for her barking alot. It's in our lease agreement that our dog cannot bark constantly.
aww,fehh94y,t1_fehge97,1579116494.0,"She has different barks. One is more urgent, which means she needs to go outside. But this one is ""PLAY WITH ME""... even though I spent the last 45 min playing fetch and I have a cold and I'm trying to rest."

nextfuckinglevel,fdi2z4n,t3_elbx4w,1578434802.0,"I think this is important and neccessary, but what I don't understand is why it's just save the children. Isn't it so much worse to not take in the parents too? The children's success rate probably goes up when receiving asylum with their parents. It just seems sad that the only way we can garner compassion for people in war zones is if we use the logic ""what if it was your children."" It's kind of like the argument about rape: ""what if it was your sister or mother?"" Why can't we have compassion for people in horrible situations like that without having to make it personal to one's lives?"

pics,fbr91cm,t1_fbr2g9j,1577040608.0,"Well for starters, just as an FYI, Affirmative Action benefits white women the most out of all the groups it's supposed to support. So, as a system it actually doesn't provide enough support to minorities of color. And to elaborate, it also doesn't mean beneficiaries of Affirmatuve Action don't have the required grades or SAT scores. So your comment is misguided and incorrect. They still need to meet the institution's minimum requirements."
