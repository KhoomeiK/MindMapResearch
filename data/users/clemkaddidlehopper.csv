If you really want to make this girl crazy, respond with dripping positivity and don’t give away any sign you feel threatened.

Can’t wait to see you tonight after practice!” Rub it IN HER FACE that you don’t give a fuck about her attempts to move in on your man because at the end of the day, he’s with YOU.

If you act threatened by her, she will feel like she is winning. It will make her feel like you think she has a chance with your boyfriend. And that will embolden her.

If you act completely unthreatened by her, especially publicly, it will probably embarrass and discourage her. All of your interactions with HER should suggest, “I totally trust my boyfriend with you because there is no way in hell that he would pick you over me, and we all know it.”

AskWomenOver30,fecsa0x,t1_fecg32a,1578982685.0,"I’m with you. A typical day in my life looks like this:
1. get up, shower, feed cats, dress. My skincare and makeup “routine” takes 5 minutes and I just let my hair air-dry or pull it into a ponytail. I’m out the door in 30 minutes, and hour if I feel like lingering in the shower.

2. Commute is 20 minutes.

3. Work 9-5.

4. Breakfast is coffee with protein powder. Lunch is frozen vegetables heated in the microwave and whatever carb/fat I feel like eating. Snack is more protein with a serving of almonds.

5. Gym (near work) 5:30-6:30/7. 

6. Sometimes after work I have a tutoring gig that lasts an hour. Sometimes I go to a dance class or have dinner with a friend.

7. Around 7-8, I eat dinner, either takeout, leftovers, or super fast homemade (like fried eggs and toast or veggies and pasta). I NEVER cook anything that takes longer than 15 minutes on a weeknight. 

8. Then I read, play/write music, watch a show with a friend and/or date, and/or clean. Technically I can get all this done by 10, but I’m usually late because I have a ton of energy and like to do stuff. 

9. Weekends involve friends, dating, music, my side gig, and cleaning (I also use Tody and love it).

I work 1 full time job, 1 part time job, and play in a band. I see my friends several times a week and keep a clean house. I eat really well (I track my macros) and work out 3-5 times per week. My life is full of friends and classes and experiences. I am busy and don’t have a ton of money to outsource labor, but I’m really happy, overall. I’ve definitely been in worse situations. 

I think people who can’t juggle this kind of life either don’t have the skills (of prioritizing or time management, maybe?) or personality for it. And I think that is ok. Some people move at a slower pace and want more peace and quiet. I LOVE going and doing all the time, so I make it happen.

AskMenOver30,fdamoll,t3_eke1e3,1578247797.0,"“As men, we are consistently measured on the metric of our service to others.”

It’s interesting to me that you say this, because most women would say the exact same thing, except for them, as women.

I live in the United States, and I feel like parents in general here feel a phenomenal amount of pressure to do way more on their own then it is reasonable to expect any couples or single person to do.

Both men and women place huge demands on each other as providers financially emotionally and recreationally. They also usually don’t have convenient or affordable childcare options, and taking care of children is so incredibly expensive and time-consuming that I really don’t know why anyone does it anymore.

I also think that in certain areas of the country, particularly ones that are anti-feminist, men feel more of a burden of being the primary breadwinner for the rest of the family. This is an insane amount of pressure on a man. Women feel other pressures as well, but a lot of times since they make less money, they become the primary childcarers, which is a separate but equal burden.

I think some solutions lie in having egalitarian approaches to the financial burdens of a family and handling daily household chores. But I also think that our society as a whole just makes it really hard to be parents, let alone non-parents. Even non-parents that I know of struggle to have enough time to have healthy relationships and make enough money to survive.

I think life is just really hard, and everyone is constantly on a search for meaning. I think that it is important for everyone to take care of themselves and spend time on nurturing hobbies and interests that they care about."

I usually have a lot of other issues in my relationships, so I’m really glad that at least I can consistently count on the possibility of sex being mutually gratifying."
relationship_advice,fcacobj,t3_egqob1,1577566853.0,"Since when do good men make you quit something you love, that is good for you, because of their own insecurities? This guy sounds like a jerk, sounds like he doesn’t really care about you very much, and I do not understand why you would want to save this relationship."

AirBnB,fc9k8av,t3_egnum5,1577553896.0,"This is one of those “give a mouse a cookie scenarios.”  I think you made a mistake by accommodating his requests at all. By not firmly sticking to the 3 PM check-in time, you imply that you could have let him check in earlier than you did — you just failed to do whatever it is in his head that he thought you needed to do to get it ready in time. 

If you would firmly stuck to a check-in at 3 PM, he might have pitched a fit, but you wouldn’t have been rushed or bothered and you wouldn’t have had to go back-and-forth communicating with him as much."
