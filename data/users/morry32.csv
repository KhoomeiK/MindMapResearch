They were 10th out of 14 AL teams in Winning Percentage.

I understand why in hindsight someone would say that 2016 was the height of a lot of those players value, but those players begged to be given a chance to stay together and the entire city believed in them.

I didn't care if they solved the crime but imagine those people were more serious criminals.

Then you find out that license plate belongs to a nerdy middle aged man who reported the plates stolen months earlier and the police didn't bother to take the report?
