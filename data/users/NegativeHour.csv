OCD,fdymn5d,t3_endtz8,1578781398.0,"I would love to know as well. I have suffered from OCD for many years, but it has gotten super bad the past months. I feel so stuck, like I cannot see outside of the OCD. It hurts so much."
OCD,fdthdby,t3_en2nox,1578716782.0,I cannot read with OCD. I re-read almost every line and it takes me forever to do. Hopefully as I see relief I can read again.

OCD,fdtgba7,t3_en2e2q,1578716350.0,"For me, it's going in and out of a door 5 times. Washing hands way too much. Doing WAY too much research about obsessions online. Asking for reassurance over and over again. This is just a couple examples."
OCD,fdtg4la,t3_en2hph,1578716273.0,"I start to get really uncomfortable, I might even cry. I do feel very disturbed and upset. The thoughts are just so strong, and I feel you."

OCD,fdspuyh,t3_emzp4a,1578706396.0,"I feel you so much. My intrusive thoughts, my compulsions and obsessions, and ruminations are hurting me so much. I don't even feel connected to this world anymore. I am hurting so much. I wish the pain would end. I wish you the best, that both of us can make it out of this."

cigars,fdp8v6p,t1_fdp6qe2,1578622724.0,"Hey man, I feel you! I am a beginner when it comes to cigars so 3-5 sounds like a ton. I assume you take breaks, and do not chain-smoke them? So that you can enjoy them more?"

OCD,fdp44ux,t3_emjflz,1578619555.0,"It took me 3 tries to find the right psychiatrist, and now I am with one who I trust! But medication wise, I have suffered. I am on 300mg of Luvox, and have seen very little benefit. But I wish you the best, and hope you will find the right medication."
OCD,fdp3ue2,t3_emjfvb,1578619360.0,"I feel you. I have been having an existential crisis due to my OCD. What if everything is working against me? What if everything is a lie? What if nothing is real? I don't have a good answer. You just gotta keep pushing, hoping that things will get better. Maybe one day they will, at least I hope so."
OCD,fdp3cc3,t1_fdp2ipz,1578619016.0,"I know it hurts, and you feel like death is the answer, but I have learned over the years that you just have to hold on for LIFE, and hope that things will get better."
OCD,fdp33gc,t3_emjckh,1578618846.0,"I feel you. OCD has made EVERY day a day full of pain and misery. The obsessions, ruminations, and compulsions are just too much. I wish there was a way to be freed of this pain. I just hope that my meds with work, because meds are a  HUGE part of it. I wish you the best, and I hope that we will both be able to make it out of this mental HELL alive. I wish you success and happiness."

depression,fdp2n3b,t1_fdo0s0e,1578618543.0,It harms me so much. It hurts me so much. SM is pure toxic garbage.

OCD,fdp2b0s,t1_fdp1ype,1578618310.0,"I know some people with OCD who I talk to to, but still, at the end of the day, I feel so alone. I feel so much pain and suffering. I wish I could of been freed from this evil disease but it still plagues me."
OCD,fdp25ui,t1_fdp1byj,1578618211.0,"Same thing with my obsessions. I remember chain smoking, overdosing on caffeine and alcohol, and being harmed in many ways, even though I am 99% sure it didn't happen."
OCD,fdp1q8q,t3_emgsfj,1578617919.0,"I hate OCD so, so much. It has caused to much pain and suffering. I cannot stand it anymore. I feel llke I overdosed on EVERYTHING (nicotine, alcohol, caffeine) and it hurts so much. I always feel like I am going to be injured or harmed/hurt in some way. I obsess about handwashing, doing things in multiples of 5, and more. I wish others could know how much OCD makes you suffer. I am here suffering with you. I wish there way an easy way to end the pain, but I haven't found one yet. OCD hurts so, so much. I am just begging for the thoughts to end, for the obsessions and ruminations to end, and the compulsions to end. I am hoping that one day we will both make it out of this, and be happy and content. F\*ck OCD!!!"
OCD,fdp16ih,t3_emiw4j,1578617550.0,"I feel the same. I suffer with uncertainty, not knowing if some scary thing actually happened or not. It hurts so much. I wish I could know that I didn't get injured, that I didn't overdose, that I didn't get hurt, that everything feels like it is going wrong or not the way I wanted it to. I search for reassurance and certainty, both of which don't help."

OCD,fdodpah,t3_eme9ts,1578603243.0,"I do things in multiples of 5, I don't know why though. It just is a great number in my mind."
OCD,fdodm22,t3_emeimo,1578603200.0,"I have been through mirtazapine, prozac, lexapro, ritalin, wellbutrin, and zoloft. I am now on Luvox. I am taking 300mg. I actually have lost weight, and my appetite is very low. I am seeing very little relief from the OCD though, but it takes time."
OCD,fdoddah,t3_emepcb,1578603083.0,"I am in so much pain too. The obsessions and compulsions are just too strong. I am hurting so much. I wish the pain would end. I am tired of living like this. It just is the worst. I am obsessing and ruminating about so, so much. Just know I am suffering right with you."
OCD,fdod47p,t3_emfchw,1578602965.0,Nice! Very accurate.

depression,fdmfk6y,t1_fdltghd,1578548231.0,"IG is pure toxic garbage. Is there a way to delete it, rather than temporarily delete it?"

depression,fdm3oew,t3_em3hyh,1578539042.0,"I don't know if this is helpful, but the past week has been one of the hardest and most painful weeks for me. Everyday is filled with pain and suffering. I have severe OCD, depression, and bipolar. I have thought of suicide as well. The only reason I can continue is because of my psychiatrist, my meds, and those around me (family, my cousins). Life can be so, so hard. I wish there was an easy solution, but I am searching for anything that can help. For example, cigars. I love them, and it's a hobby. I also go on walks and walk around the mall. Small things really add up, and can help you to become distracted from the pain. I wish you the best."
depression,fdm2v49,t3_elycos,1578538495.0,"I am so sorry for what you have suffered through. I can relate to feeling like you have been   
""set back."" I am 20 and I have only taken a handful of classes. No college, no parties, no friends, no girls, no fun, none of anything, really. My depression, bipolar, and OCD have really ruined my life. I can relate to not eating almost all day, not showering, and not brushing teeth, because that's me now. I am not sure that my meds are the right ones for me as well. I wish you the best, and hope that we can both make it out of this pain and suffering. It can be so, so hard."
OCD,fdm1zv5,t3_em2r1o,1578537908.0,"I would say that you have OCD, but that's no diagnosis. I would seek a psychiatrist that you can trust. OCD can be hard, because of how broad it is. There are many types, and they can show themselves in different ways. I would say that you seem to be obsessing/ruminating about those daydreams, and that fandom. I wish you the best :)"
OCD,fdm1jm6,t1_fdm11kj,1578537606.0,"Hey, it's worth a try! Thanks :)"
OCD,fdm0w7h,t1_fdlxbsb,1578537164.0,"I am so, so stuck. I am in so much pain. I see a psychiatrist, but I haven't seen my psychologist for weeks. I am hurting so much. The intrusive thoughts and obsessions are just way too much. I am on the max dose of LUVOX but I have gotten no relief. I wish there was a way to exit the pain that I am in. It's the worst pain I have ever been in."

OCD,fdlfk3n,t1_fdlentc,1578522938.0,"Thanks, and I have heard of ERP before. I just haven't done it yet. I am hoping that it can help give me some relief, I am so tired of suffering with OCD so much."

OCD,fdjehvb,t3_elp8v1,1578467437.0,"I feel the same way. I feel truly alone at times, and the OCD is making my life a living hell. No medicine has been right for me so far, except for Zyprexa and Lithium, which don't treat OCD. Just know that I am here suffering right with you. OCD can be so, so hard. And it just hurts so much. I wish you the best."

OCD,fdfday7,t3_el1llo,1578359004.0,"I have been in an existential crisis for years. I constantly say and think that life is completely meaningless. Lithium and some drugs have helped to quench those dark thoughts a bit, but it is still such a struggle."
OCD,fdf96hq,t3_ektgx7,1578356230.0,This is too common of a belief of OCD. One CAN have OCD and not give a single f\*ck about cleanliness.
depression,fdd1t2x,t3_ekpwki,1578291406.0,"I feel you man! I though I overcame depression but things the past week have gone horribly for me. I get no enjoyment from pretty much everything. I have stopped showering and brushing my teeth. I wish I could offer more help. I am just hoping that one day things will get better, although they haven't so far. I wish that I could feel better too, man. I feel like I am in a black hole of depression. I have tried smoking, drinking, eating tasty foods, taking a class, going out, but I still feel bad."
depression,fdd1n70,t3_ekpwsl,1578291223.0,"I spend most of my time in my bed, so I understand. The darkness of depression is hitting me so hard too. I wish I could just cut the pain somehow, but I don't know how. I wish I could offer some form of help."
depression,fdd1ala,t3_ekptw8,1578290846.0,"I feel you! I haven't showered in weeks, and rarely brush my teeth. I am in so much darkness and it's hard to see my way out. I wish I had good advice, because I am suffering with keeping up my hygiene so much too."

OCD,fdc41x5,t1_fd9kqp7,1578266691.0,"It has caused issues. I am in the 10th percentile of weight, so this obsession has caused me to not want my weight to change. I am on the max dose of luvox, since Friday. Hopefully I can feel some relief with the meds."
