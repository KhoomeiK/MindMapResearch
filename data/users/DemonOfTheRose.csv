DiWHY,ffad936,t1_ffa0f8y,1579732817.0,"For some people with chronic illness, 5 isn't all that much. Everything is subjective, but for me I have had arthritis and neuropathy since I was 22 (and have always had anxiety and insomnia) so for me, 5 is a pretty basic number. For others yeah that would be a lot, for me, I'm happy when I'm only at 5 lol. Life is subjective, but I've always been on a fair amount of medication, my grandma being the same way, so along with being brought up by here and my own health, it's just like any other thing to me."
Cringetopia,ff7p4ua,t1_ff6fxc3,1579654933.0,"Sorry, you're right I should have specified.
People wishing others death and doing things like this. And also the amount of people that feel so entitled to their hatred that they actually don't see a problem here."

DiWHY,ff5irkg,t3_erfh0g,1579594776.0,"Actually, while I can def see why people would find it weird don't get me wrong, but it is kind of nice seeing something usually taken as something that makes you feel sad and making something pretty out of it, PLUS a LOT of those bottles fill landfills, so the recycling aspect is a bit nice. It's also nice seeing just needing someone that does take a LOT of meds"

Cringetopia,ff5h0bq,t3_erol8k,1579592471.0,"In some countries being famous and being in a relationship/talking about being in one is pretty taboo. Some places make people sign contracts stating they can't get into a relationship, just because it would ""ruin the fantasy"" for people, or whatever you would call obsessively drooling over a celebrity, idfk"

cringepics,ff57ujs,t1_ff4ooxm,1579582788.0,.......They can't though. You can't on tinder. They don't want you to be capable of changing their age to pretend to be something different. Not every dating app is the same. And not everyone knows you can change your age on Facebook and/or that it will change your tinder age. They purposely did not want people to be able to change their age on tinder easily.
cringepics,ff57ggc,t1_ff4nza1,1579582443.0,"Tinder goes based off of the age attached to your Facebook profile, you don't set it on your own.
That precaution was created because of people lying."

This poor girl is getting death threats and messages to kill herself over something some bitch made up, and btw, HER DADS BEEN MISSING FOR 5+ YEARS
this poor girl has been missing her father for years and now she has to deal with messages not only reminding her of her lost father, but also insinuating she's sleeping with her father and all the other gross crap you can probably imagine this poor girl is getting in her DMs. Go to her Instagram (which is even shown on this - mnblasnprincess ) if you would like the proof yourself, there's  a saved story on her page about it all as well.

Captain America can pick it up, and while yes, he is strong as hell, but is no stronger than what a human is capable of (look it up if you want). If it were strength alone, every one as strong as, or stronger than Captain America would be able to lift it. And it has already been cleared up that Captain Marvel IS one of the strongest marvel heroes ever in the MCU, not just by speculation or opinions, but the 'facts' based on her and the MCU and it's comics."

assholedesign,fdj4cdl,t1_fdiuo3j,1578458099.0,"Right but it comes up every single page you turn, even on short comics that take only a few seconds read to per page, and even if you do not wish to join the event you have to deal with this pop up untill you have read 100 pages. There is no way to get rid of it. I understand wanting to promote, but if you do not want to join the event, you shouldn't have to deal with a full screen pop-up ad that takes time to full load before you can exit it. Getting promotion for artists is wonderful, but taking away the entire point of the app unless you deal with a full screen ad every time you turn a page for 100 pages is not wonderful. You have to deal with 100 of these even if you do join the event, too."
