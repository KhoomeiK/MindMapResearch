singapore,ffex469,t1_ffeujcw,1579869056.0,I somehow had a conversation with a taxi driver on this topic some time ago. He mentioned he was one of the drivers who dared to ferry passengers to and from the hospital at the time. He said he did it because it was very good money and he was young and single at the time so he bochup. Most trips window open.

singapore,ffcoia7,t1_ffcnunz,1579803839.0,Tech boom in the 90s in Singapore really? When we were using dial up modems? You mean the US. And you seriously want to compare the size of the tech industry in Singapore now and how it was back in 2007? Maybe you like to take things literally.

I already mentioned skilled workers will not be let go so I don't know why you are trying to convince me they will be retained. All I am saying is popular industries for Singaporeans will be badly hit. 

Retail downsize, of course it will happen. I sense you think I am somehow defending the retail industry. Im saying is these jobs will still go to foreigners because they are willing to take up suppressed salaries.

Last point: my example wasn't great, but no need to be triggered. Academic jobs are least likely to be affected anyway."

singapore,ffc8zre,t1_ffc82je,1579794279.0,"People stop investing when the economy is bad. That kills off the banking sector. Tech jobs are mainly start ups using investor funds. When the economy goes down, investor funds stop, these company downsize, drastically. Specific skill jobs will be safe. But I ask you, do you really think Singaporeans are the ones with the real expertise? Let me give you an example. All the top scientists at NUS are foreigners, mainly China. Singaporeans are usually the sidekicks."
singapore,ffc6tp2,t1_ffc5rtp,1579792882.0,"The only reason retail workers are retrenched is if the business folds. Besides retail workers can always find work easily since hardly any locals want to take up. When economy is bad companies will suppress salaries. 1.6k a month is still attractive for them, locals can tahan? The new generation hasn't felt a real economic downturn. With SARS 2.0 on the way (remember the downturn SARS caused?), the threat is very real. It is going to be very depressing."

singapore,ffc4tfo,t3_ests0v,1579791540.0,"Result of gahmen policy to push everyone to be highly educated, stigmatising blue collar work. Now hardly any Singaporean wants to do these type of jobs even when the pay is decent. When the economy turns bad and the all fancy start ups, bank and tech jobs are not hiring, the foreigners are the ones with jobs."
