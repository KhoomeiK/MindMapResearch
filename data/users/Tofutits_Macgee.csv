Without all the fear mongering and editorialized news people might recognise what the actual problems are and instead of staying divided there would be unity. Can't have that. /s"

It may not be obvious but throughout the years but they hinted at vegetarianism and even veganism as the status quo on working well supplied ships and stations. When Riker was cooking eggs in his quarters his guests were fascinated but kind of off put at first without articulating if it was also actual eggs that came from animals as well as cooking them yourself that was so unusual. When Keiko and Miles were talking about food from their backgrounds, Keiko was surprised and a bit shocked that his mother used real meat. That is the most immediate references that come to mind."
technology,ff3dlnh,t1_ff3cbzk,1579538978.0,"That's pretty condescending reply considering you completely misunderstood my response to the parent comment.  I was suggesting that OPs theory about trying to appeal to older voters by identifying with their out of touch rhetoric and repeating it to win the election \*is\* Biden's strategy **NOT** that it is a good strategy. OP claiming Biden coming to this conclusion does not mean it is based in fact, but a hypothesis on Biden's thought process behind this hyperbole. My comment was intended to suggest I agree with OPs theory and not Biden's alleged attempt at appealing to the older voters. I hope that clears it up for you."

TrollYChromosome,ff2rosl,t1_ff2lyg8,1579521137.0,Cool. So everything that goes into your body is up for discussion too by your logic. You have renounced autonomy over your own self. Which also invites opinion from complete strangers to tell you what to do and what not to do with your body. Let me get that ball rolling by demanding you stop using axe body spray in lieu of showering and to lay off the mountain dew and cool ranch.

SandersForPresident,fe7jaiq,t1_fe6k5d5,1578915332.0,"I am Canadian and your voting system seems pretty wack to me. Especially with the robotic voters owned by companies that are chaired by the likes of Mitt Romney. Is vote reform possible...like something that can be legally done? Through observation alone, the most dense regions via population seem more left leaning yet the ridings in more sparse areas seem to run things. Anyway I hope Bernie wins. Everyone deserves access to health care and college so they can improve their quality of life and the quality of life of their families and their community at large. Good luck to you."

thesims,fdpepj3,t1_fdpe53a,1578626714.0,"I love this stuff.  Home like these evolved from what were just adjacent rooms and in order to get to another room you have to travel through another set of rooms as there were no halls like we are used to. It meant very little privacy and side rooms were just smaller insignificant rooms beside main rooms like bedrooms, music rooms, ballrooms etc. and the staff would used those smaller adjacent rooms for setting up, or one might speak to their staff their out of side of the guests. There are youtube docs on Versailles which illustrates how grand homes used to be laid out.

thesims,fdo06ts,t1_fdnf1po,1578596411.0,"I know this! Side rooms had a few uses and it was dependent on what the side room was adjacent too. If you had an elderly or ailing parent, they would occupy this room primarily during waking hours if this was on the bedroom level. 

If off to the side of the main hall it was for use of guests that were not staying (kind of like that room wrapped in plastic with french doors that no one uses). You put your nice fancy furniture there, maybe a record player, and you might have some tea and entertain short stay (or unwanted guests). This is opposed to the morning room which was primarily intended for family.


Again this change with times and finances but you get the idea."
