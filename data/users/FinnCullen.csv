I’ve stolen the basic idea for various home brews (including the home brew rules I made up to replace Ars Magica in the Victorian campaign I was running)
rpg,fffkraq,t3_etd6tl,1579886086.0,"Ars Magica has a wonderful magic system in which your character is ranked in what are effectively magical verbs and nouns.   By combining two, for instance Create and Fire you can attempt to create a magical result with difficulty modified by range, duration, potency and so on.   Light a candle or create a city wide inferno."

trippinthroughtime,ff8pkqi,t1_ff8mi28,1579690545.0,"It’s from an old poem.  The story is that a jealous husband painted a donkey on his wife’s stomach when he went away knowing it would be rubbed out if she was unfaithful.   The wife’s lover simply repainted it after each tryst.   The ruse was discovered one time when the lover’s memory failed him and he added a saddle to the image where there was none before.

rpg,ff5knss,t1_ff5kbrx,1579597469.0,The board game is unrelated in fact.  The HQ rpg was originally intended as a spiritual successor to Runequest- in Glorantha the heroes go on hero quests to enter the mythic realm.  Because the board game existed the Rpg was originally called Hero Wars but regained its true name in a later edition.

I think it is very telling that the demographic most likely to accuse people of being “snowflakes” and complaining about “them libtards getting offended by words” are the first to start screaming REEEEEEEEE when they hear an opinion they disagree with.

Matthew was an elaboration of Mark’s with an added gloss to link the events with the prophesies of the Tanakh, Luke was never an eye witness but the Bible itself says he was a companion of Paul who compiled the tales of the life of Jesus by speaking to primary sources and was written for a mainly gentile audience to broaden the scope of Jesus’ ministry.  Other scholars say that like Matthew’s gospel, Luke’s was created using Mark as a base.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcan_priority"
