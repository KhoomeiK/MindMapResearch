She technically was.  Again, she was really good at staying just on the right side of the line.  

That is honestly one of her top attributes...being able to do shit that she shouldn't, but technically making it ok.  And I'm not saying that as a negative.  If there is one thing that Clinton can do, it is walk that narrow path to keep everything legal.  She could literally shoot someone on 5th avenue in broad daylight on TV and there would be some legal justification for it...again...not being negative, but impressed.

>Hillary refused to let the text of her speeches given to the likes of Goldman Sachs for a $300,000 payday for a one hour speech go public.

This was a terrible decision on her part.  It really made it look like she was hiding something, especially given the lies and deception that she was already engaged in and known for.  By the time they leaked out and were shown to be nothing anyway, the damage was already done to her.

>Hillary Clinton is very smart but there is no freaking way her speeches are so amazing that she should get $300,000 a pop for them.

Eh...You'd be amazed at what people get paid for that kind of stuff.  $300k really isn't all that much to be fair.

worldnews,fe8gxpc,t1_fe8b9h5,1578925996.0,">It’s a bit of a stretch to say that the US is deliberately targeting civilians with the intent of causing terror.

First of all, that is absolutely not at all what they said.  they said that we provide material support to organizations that do...which is undeniably true.  Heck, the entire reason that we are where we are with Iran right now is because we helped to install and provided support to a brutal dictator as their leader until they revolted.

Second of all, we do this exact thing.  Drone strikes on suspected members of terror organizations (ie civilians) in their homes (ie surrounded by other civilians) for the express purpose of causing terror is *exactly* what we do.

>but the targeted killing of non-combatants is not in US doctrine.

It is not supposed to be, but since 9/11 we do it anyway.  We will even target US citizen children.

>We don’t send guys with bombs strapped to their chests to blow up marketplaces.

We simply have more sophisticated delivery systems.  That doesn't make what we do better.  It isn't any less awful when the video footage is a gun cam from an apache as they light up a van that clearly has children in it.

Iran does terrible things.  We do terrible things, too.  We have for our entire history.  Don't try to claim that we don't or haven't as it just hurts your credibility when discussing these matters."

The entire point of the Pardon power is to be a check on the courts **and** Congress by allowing the executive to undo an unjust action whether via errors in the process or unjust laws (including unjust application of those laws).  Sometimes the pardon power is used simply to move past an event without any further drama.  A prime example of this was Carter's blanket pardon of Vietnam war draft dodgers.

Adding all of those extra requirements and steps makes all of that nigh impossible.

Yes...the power will be abused just as it ever has been.  People who have the connections to get the President's ear will get consideration while those who don't will not.  That will not change if you add a bunch of restrictions.  What will change is that a lot of people who deserve pardons will no longer be able to get them.

Having some rando just blurt out, ""Thank you for your service!"" every time they find out that I'm a veteran means nothing to me and is honestly both cringe inducing and awkward.  They don't know who I am or what I've done.  I could be a war criminal for all they know.

I don't need nor do I want want people to thank me for doing what I did.  I did it for my own reasons and none of those was the adoration of my fans.  At the same time, I don't want people shitting on me simply for making the decisions that I have.  I conducted myself with honor and continue to try to be the best version of myself that I can (eh, you gets what you gets).

Nobody should be praised blindly...a lot of people in the military are complete assholes with few redeeming qualities (no different than a lot of people outside of the military).  You can't generally know that just upon meeting them (there are, of course, exceptions).  I'm glad that these kids who are coming home now are being treated well.  I really am.
