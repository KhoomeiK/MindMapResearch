I completely understand how those feelings can hurt other people, but I think it's a mistake to hold those feelings as some kind of sin. We can't help how we feel. All we can do is try to understand each other and move beyond it. 

I've disappointed my dad many times, and I always feel a little ashamed whenever I don't live up to his standards of masculinity. I'm not very strong, I hate the outdoors, I spent most of last year's fishing trip vomiting. My main inferiority complex would be to my brother, who is so much more like my dad than I am. That isn't to say I know specifically how you feel, but I'm no stranger to feeling shame about not being the kind of son my dad may have wanted. 

But at the end of the day, it doesn't matter. I know my dad loves me, and I love him, so whatever disappointments we may have in each other at times will be forgiven. No parent is perfect, but as long as there's love there, there will always be a path to moving beyond the failures."

ffxiv,ffgozwc,t3_etip9k,1579911416.0,"In the beginning there were the same six cards, but they all did different things.

- Damage buff

- Critical hit buff (it originally did something else but it was changed to this after a bit)

- Action speed buff

- Defense buff

- MP regen

- TP regen (TP was essentially MP for weaponskills, but they removed it in Shadowbringers)

No matter how hard they tried, the dev team could not figure out a how to make the cards balanced. The damage buff card was clearly better than any other choice, so players would almost always fish for it. Weakening it wouldn't work, because AST's biggest contribution to raiding was its damage buff, and taking it away or weakening it too much would make AST effectively worthless. 

But three of the cards were already effectively worthless and two were only slightly better than that, so having players fish for the damage buff relying solely on random chance was awful, and a lot of people refused to even try AST because of it. They were also planning on deleting TP from the game, which meant the TP regen card would have to be deleted as well or change entirely.

Their solution in the end was to make all the cards buff damage directly. That way, AST keeps itself relevant compared to the other healers and players don't have to stress as much about getting the ""best"" card, because all the cards are good. They also added a new seal system on top of it that when done correctly provides an AOE damage buff so players still have to manage the cards a bit, AND changed the Major arcana cards to basically being outs for the occasions where you still don't get the card you want. This change was largely to make things easier on the dev team going forward, not something that players specifically asked for. Players wanted AST to change, but as always, there wasn't any universally agreed upon idea of what that change should be.

People have differing opinions about it, but speaking for myself, I much prefer the new system. Randomness certainly isn't boring, but that doesn't mean it's fun either. I *hated* AST from Heavensward through Stormblood, but I find it a lot more fun now."

If your idea of racism is KKK members and Neo-Nazis, then sure, what you say would be true.

That kind of hyperbole (""I wouldn't hurt a fly,"" ""I don't have a greedy bone in my body,"" etc.) is pretty common for bad liars.

witcher,fduefoi,t1_fdqqf5l,1578731873.0,"I think having her become empress is not as terrible as some people think, but at the same time, if she becomes a Witcher, Emyhr has no heir and the empire is basically doomed to crumble because it's built on a cult of personality around Emyhr. Plus it leaves Ciri, an incredibly powerful person, free to act as she pleases, and to really use her powers to actively protect the world from huge threats. As Empress she would have too many political responsibilities to directly confront problems. Her day-to-day might just be killing monsters, but if another catastrophe looms, she can save the world.

There's good and bad in both endings. As Empress she gains political power but won't have much individual power, as a witcher she has no political power but is free to develop and use her Elder Blood powers to their fullest potential."
witcher,fducaoa,t1_fdtjtmv,1578731087.0,"It doesn't take a lot of muscle to stab someone. To be as factually accurate as possible, you could argue that *on average* a man could fight for longer than a woman and swing with more force, but unless you are trying to bisect a dude through his torso, strength alone won't do much.

When people say ""biologically, men are stronger than women"" it's almost never about scientific accuracy and almost always about masking their sexism with science. Because the REAL fact is that women can be great athletes if they train, just like men. We're talking about swinging a sword, not pulling a school bus."
ffxiv,fdts05q,t1_fdpv3hq,1578721294.0,"The two mindsets for crafting in MMOs are either that it should be really complex and time-consuming so that only the most ~~deranged~~ *dedicated* players will be able to reap the greatest rewards from it, or that it should be piss easy enough that anyone could do it and the markets are manipulated almost entirely through demand.

I lean towards the latter, so I don't mind the changes. It is just a game, so the idea that the economy could be ruled by a shadowy cabal of maniacs gouging prices for fun and profit doesn't really hold much weight, but there are certainly games with horribly balanced economies where that very thing has happened (but typically in those games the economy is MUCH more important to the overall experience).

FFXIV has never really had that problem though outside of housing. To me, the simple fact that you really don't need lots of gil to accomplish 98% of what the game has to offer means there's no point in making crafting tedious."

There is no innate ""betterness"" someone can have over you, only the illusion of it. If you look at other people and see them with the things you think you're supposed to have, try to remember that what you think you're supposed to have is also based on what other people say and do. Don't think of yourself as lagging behind in some imaginary race, instead value how far you've come and how far you can still go. The finish line is the same for everyone anyway."
