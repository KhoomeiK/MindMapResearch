Should we prevent wealth concentration altogether, or just limit the percentage? Because one could argue that using current resources to acquire more is one way the economic pie is enlarged, which is a generally a good thing, and we don't want to discourage that, because the goal ultimately should be to maximize the wellbeing of everyone, even though some will have more, and not just lower everyone to the same standard of living."

You experience the world via colors, sounds, tastes, smells, pains, pleasures, etc. That's all the evidence you need. In fact, there is no evidence without those experiences, because that's how you know about the world, and thus brain activity and everything else. If you deny that color, sound, etc. experiences are real, then what basis do you have for saying brain activity is real? None. You've undermined the evidence.

You can say that one is real and the other is an illusion or cognitive mistake, but you have no basis for making that determination, since your interaction with the world would be an illusion or cognitive mistake."

Figure out a way to make a living that produces something people want. Even better if can do that at scale, like successful athletes, entertainers and entrepreneurs.

People aren't going to spend money on things they don't value. Your hard work means nothing to anyone else but you. Hard work was always the wrong thing to focus on. It's valuable only to the extent it helps you create value for others, whether it's impressing a boss (enough to pay you more or promote you) or learning a new skill.
