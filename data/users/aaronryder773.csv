DistroHopping,fejizbh,t1_fejiinb,1579176298.0,"Arch breaks more often than I thought. Its definitely stable than manjaro though. On the other hand, zypper is so slow it takes forever to update the repos but the good thing about it is that it didnt break on me. Not even once. I am not talking about system updates im talking about packages like calibre, fontawesome, transmission. These packages are not up to date at all. Infact they completely dropped the support for calibre and I had to install it manually. This is just an example of one package but there's a lot"

openSUSE,feiyute,t3_epd2u6,1579151092.0,things tend to break in linux if you don't pay attention to them and you will spend quite some time searching for solution to fix things unlike windows. Linux community is very helpful if you know what error you're getting or what issue you're having and are able to explain probperly. If you blindly do something and get an error and post it in community or don't look properly before posting chances that you will get ignored for it is high.

i3wm,fdvlf9j,t3_en5932,1578748637.0,"If you install arch, you can directly install window manager instead of a DE but you will need to configure it and since a lot of the applications are based on GTK+ or Qt, window managers don't come with the support and required dependencies for it. So, it's just easier to install Desktop environment which comes with GTK+ and qt (almost all DE's) and install your choice of window manager on top of it."

BasicBulletJournals,fdqpf3o,t3_eliuhl,1578672027.0,"I like how you connected it to personal things like mental and emotions which matters a lot especially in bullet journaling. I recently read the book called The Power of Habit. It was a great read. and it focused on stuff how entrepreneurs made their products famous world wide famous. There's The Cue, The Routine and The Reward. For example lets take pepsodent, The cue for pepsodent is giving you a tingling feeling when you brush, the routine is brushing everyday and reward is clean teeth. BUT in case of bullet journaling if we apply the same logic then, The Cue is marking an X or any other symbol on your bullet journal, The routine is going to the gym, food you eat, study, etc. and finally, The Reward is fitness, health and good marks in exams for studying. Haha, I know its not emotionally or mentally as connected as you made it but hey it works and we can see the results ourselves, that is what our goal is, The Reward(good results) and that is what matters.

It's the discipline and consistency that matters for me. Maybe mood is the right way for you but I haven't tried anything related to mood yet so I can't say much about it. I will definitely try this though! Thank you again.
