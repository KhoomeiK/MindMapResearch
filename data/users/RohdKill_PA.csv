todayilearned,ffa6maz,t1_ffa5o29,1579728896.0,"nice. There were many doors that just had a number on them. Not knowing what could be behind. I got to meet the man that digitizes music for Iron Mountain. What a cool set up he had. He pulled the original Tom Petty Learning to Fly 24 track reel to give us a demonstration...  man was this guy into his Job (Reminded me of that scientist in Independence Day"")... After digitizing 85% of the Music on the Famous Guitar hero games he landed contracts from Tons of Bands."

The mountain is actually a geographical anomaly with a giant layer of slate that actually acts like an umbrella. There were a few cages there than at EMP doors. Pretty freaking awesome.
