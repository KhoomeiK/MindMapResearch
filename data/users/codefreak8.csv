hockey,ffg83h0,t3_et1lvs,1579900496.0,"I don't know that they could have told Holland before he was hired.  It does sound like they didn't tell him for a while after he was hired, though. I feel like that's something he should be aware of as GM considering he's the person in a position to make the moves they would need to make to try and make up for losing McDavid for the season, if it had come to that.

It's also a complicated position to be in, because on the one hand McDavid is probably the most attractive part about working in that organization. You don't want other teams to find out about the injury if Holland doesn't join, especially if knowing about the injury is a factor in him not taking the job. On the other hand, if you don't tell him you get a situation like this where I can easily see how Holland feels deceived by not being told earlier.

I really wonder if they could have had him sign an NDA about this and then tell him before hiring. At that point the risk of it leaking is possibly lower, but it doesn't keep him from not taking the job over it."

Ovi need 202 goals to tie and 203 to pass Gretzky. If he maintains his career average Goals per Game (0.611), he could pass Gretzky in 333 games.

FireEmblemHeroes,fcmgkis,t1_fclurh0,1577774452.0,"Basically, every character has an ""origin number"" as well as a number that represents what order they were added to the game. The origin number is made up of a few parts: 

* A two digit number to represent the game they are from (00 for Heroes, 01 for FE1/3/11/12, 02 for SoV/Gaiden, 03 for Genealogy, 04 for Thracia, 05 for Binding Blade, 06 for Blazing Sword, 07 for Sacred Stones, 08 for Path of Radiance, 09 for Radiant Dawn, 10 for Awakening, 11 for Fates, and 12 for 3H). 

* A two or three digit number to represent a group of characters within the same game (for example, for Awakening characters, units with 01 in this position are part of the Shepherds, or 69 are the 2nd gen characters).

* A two digit number to further organize units within the previously mentioned groups, usually starting with 01. There seems to be spaces left for units that haven't been released yet (for instance, group 03 from Binding Blade originally just had Raigh, who was number 02 within that group. However, Lugh was added as 01 and Chad later added as 03). 

The URLs are based on these values, though they are formatted slightly different from the character's origin number as it exists in the game's files. For instance, Hubert's number in his URL is 12002002000406, while his origin number in the game's files would be 120000200200; However, the numbers that make up both (12 for the game, 02 for the group (Black Eagles), and 02 for his placement in that group are all the same, just placed slightly differently (it seems like all URLs should put these numbers in the same places from my research). The added bit on the end, 000406, is the order in which this Hubert was added to the game. They add that for the URLs because **every alt of the same character will use the same origin number** (this doesn't count characters like >!Sirius!<, though, who is the same person as >!Camus!<, but is considered to be a unique character in the game), so if a character that already has this sort of URL gets an alt they need a way to make them distinct so as to not reuse an existing Meet the Heroes page."
hockey,fcm77i3,t1_fcl0ibh,1577766033.0,"To me, if the public is able to see and listen to these videos that show when the whistle blew and when the game clock continued to run/stopped and started again, the refs or somebody with the power to talk to the refs had that same feed. I get that missing calls in the moment is going to be a part of the game as long as we have human refs that we trust to make most calls, but when we have a system set up to review plays that *aren't* judgement calls, and those things being reviewed are supposed to be 100% accurate, especially a case like this where there's no mistaking what happened, I feel like at some point a real example needs to be made. The calls refs make affect the game, and I think it's fair to expect them to make the right call if they're given the tools and time to call it right. Players and coaches are all held to a standard and yet there are still enough of them in the league even when they're punished. If a ref can't stay in the league after they try and hold them responsible for the worst actions on their part maybe we need to give some new refs, ones who have been brought up in a system that properly utilizes the tools  they have, a chance."
