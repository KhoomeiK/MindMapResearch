You don’t respect yourself so therefore it’s actually repulsive when someone else treats you with respect, cuz what the duck is wrong with him to have respect for you??? This is a cycle which will continue and get progressively worse as time goes on unless you go to therapy and come to grips with yourself as a human.  What is it exactly about yourself that you dislike so intensely?  For right now your brain ONLY wants shitty people who will reinforce your belief that you don’t deserve respect or happiness.  Your brain is so starved for being “right” that it chooses to cling to people who will shit all over you, only so that you can go “see i fuckin KNEW this would happen.”   It doesn’t matter to your brain that it literally orchestrated the entire debacle- being right is being right!  You have to break that cycle before you can even think of a man being able to “make you happy.”  Cuz you’re gonna fight the right person until you become the right person for yourself.  It sounds cheesy as hell but our brains are powerful- and if it wants you to sabotage your chance at happiness it’s gonna get what it wants- it just has to be sneaky about it."

AskReddit,ff1gos2,t1_ff0tj2y,1579478947.0,"My house growing up had some sick popcorn ceiling, wood paneling, weird wallpaper, AND thick-ass 70s style carpeting.  Hallucinating was so fun at home!"
exmormon,ff1fqwp,t1_ff0b9zd,1579478518.0,"Ok but that aside... it’s fuckin shitty to try to shame someone for being bipolar, as you did when you went thru someone’s post history to find a six year old post about their manic depression."
exmormon,ff08jyz,t1_ff02vt8,1579466312.0,"I scrolled up, used my eyeballs, and saw the comment YOU posted in which YOU quoted someone’s six year old post.  Someone else brought up their history first, sure, but YOU are the one who literally quoted their old shit."
exmormon,ff07jq5,t1_fezrikv,1579466039.0,Are you fuckin serious??  This person posts on THE DONALD and you’re choosing to try to shame them for being bipolar?!  What is wrong with you.  Do better.
BeAmazed,fezyemt,t1_fezxa44,1579463241.0,Are you new to Reddit because this happens so frequently that I tuned it all out like twelve years ago.
MaliciousCompliance,fezp755,t1_fey107w,1579459928.0,"No.  Absolutely no to all of this.  Why would you suggest these things to a grown man who has his CHILDREN with him?  People do have to grow up at some point, you know.  And anyway all of this is just an invitation to get punched.  You give suggestions like someone who’s never had a grown man punch them square in the face.  None of this will work.  Sorry."
MaliciousCompliance,feznv1c,t1_fez9y9s,1579459466.0,You’re giving absolutely no consideration to the consequences of exposing his children to this behavior.  You need to have a seat.  Everything you’ve suggested is highly inappropriate.
Animal_Sanctuary,fezlbsu,t3_eqx69g,1579458567.0,This is like that one time when I was at a strip club and dude had a highly visible boner.  I’m uncomfortable.
PublicFreakout,fezjgvi,t1_fexye0c,1579457997.0,"My parents’ Chevy celebrity wagon was the car I learned to drive in, and drove for a few years before I finally got my first car."
PublicFreakout,fezj82c,t1_feywju8,1579457911.0,"Certainly each cylinder isn’t powered by a single exhausted hamster, if that’s what you’re suggesting.    Because it’s definitely what I was suggesting."
PublicFreakout,fexfnyt,t1_fexa3dz,1579430217.0,"Oh wow thank you for the flashback to my 99 chevy cavalier, which had such a noticeable difference in horsepower that I used to joke with people that I had a “turbo” button.   Nope, it was just the AC.  I swear that engine was powered by a damn hamster wheel."
politics,fevx8bi,t1_feupyhl,1579402635.0,The big one that scarred me the most was in third grade (so like 1988 maybe) one of the DARE people explained to us how some kid was eating at McDonald’s and apparently someone had put angel dust in the salt shaker.  The kid put salt on his fries and then before his parents could do anything he had gone crazy and GOUGED OUT HIS OWN  EYES.  Now I was never worried about angel dust but I WAS terrified of all restaurant salt and pepper shakers for many years.
politics,feuog3a,t1_feuk3nk,1579388463.0,Yeah but like... nobody does that.  It’s a DARE officer’s fantasy but it’s not applicable to real life situations.  At all.  Nobody needs to TRICK people into wanting to do drugs- that’s just human nature.  Honestly bro stop spreading 80s style propaganda.
politics,feunfmy,t1_feuj16q,1579388231.0,"They still do!  At least in my part of Texas right next to Louisiana, they do.  Drive thru daiquiri shacks."
unpopularopinion,feousxu,t1_fenpt2z,1579305904.0,That’s like the people who don’t tip when they go out to eat because “it’ll encourage them to get a different job.”
unpopularopinion,feoupkz,t1_fenkjo2,1579305847.0,"That sounds like your typical Protestant work ethic to me.  They’re not so much about charity.  They’re more “teach a man to fish” than “feed him,” only sadly they never end up doing that teaching- they usually just walk on by.  And then pat themselves on the back for not giving in to their “selfish urge” to not see this homeless person be hungry.   Then they go to church on Sunday and share their story of fighting their own selfishness and everyone praises them.  I find it fascinating!"
unpopularopinion,feoto0k,t1_feobv5q,1579305302.0,"What was the point of making that observation, Mr Newton?"
videos,feo9xm2,t1_fenurgr,1579297177.0,I’m from just east of Houston and have never heard of this segment and THANK YOU.  So much.
