The prevailing theory from feminists is that if people knew the percentage of rape accusations that were false, then people wouldn't believe real victims when they came forward.

The funniest story of all when I was trying to find information about how common false rape accusations were, a cop was giving an interview, from some college town, and he said that most of the rape accusations his department sees are bullshit, made up. The reporter quoted him in the article, and the outrage mob got him fired.

Oh, and one statistic that I found interesting, I was falsely accused of rape, it was proven false, so it never made it to trial, and the prosecutor didn't charge the ""victim"" with making a false rape accusation ""because it would discourage actual victims of sexual assault from coming forward.""
