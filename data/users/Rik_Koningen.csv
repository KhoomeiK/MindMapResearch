AskReddit,ffc9tri,t1_ffbv2y6,1579794807.0,"> Why do IT people think that everyone should know what they know?

Probably because people keep pretending they know more than us all the time. ""My son has a PHD in computer science so I know that simply restarting won't fix this issue. I demand you come down here and fix it right away!"" So you come over and restart the PC and the problem is magically fixed.

Secondarily it's not demanding people know everything we know, just enough to do their job. A car mechanic for example can't expect customers to know how to fix their own car. But they can definitely expect them to be able to *drive* the damn car. 

And that's where the disconnect happens. Because with IT you find people who rely on a computer to do every single part of their job that still don't know how to use the PC in any way. We can't expect people to know how to open a PC and repair anything. But surely we can expect that someone who's entire job is PC based knows how to restart a machine?"

AskReddit,ff61eqo,t1_ff5pefh,1579616665.0,"I used to use the audio technica ath50X for ages. After the first week or so it became very comfortable to wear with my glasses. The most comfortable pair I've ever owned. I kinda regret going for something else when they finally broke. Probably will go right back when my current headphones break. Though they may be out of your price range depending on how much you're willing to spend. Also depends on the shape of your head, what's great for me might not be amazing for you and vice versa.

Ideally you look for something that doesn't put too much pressure on to stay on first and foremost. That depends heavily on head shape. Going to a store where you can try them on is helpful for this. If you can't find online reviews done by people with a similar head shape to you. Can be a hassle but often if you DM authors of reviews they're happy to tell you what kinda head shape they have so you can tell if the review applies for you. Secondly you want a pillow type on the earcups that retains shape well or that's very soft or both. Most of my headphones end up with a line where the glasses sit and don't put much pressure there as a result. This does take a while and makes new headphones less comfortable for a while until they wear in a bit."

fatlogic,ff2qgrs,t1_ff1wufg,1579519374.0,3-4 is a lot. I do that on average maybe once a week. But 1 hour a day every day is totally doable. Think about how much tv the average person watches. Just cut an hour from that. 1 hour a day I've done for the past 5 years now I think. That's still around 300 kcal extra which has helped the sustainability of my diet immensely.
fatlogic,ff0bk8h,t1_ff06cxc,1579467270.0,Depends on what you count as negligible. If you exercise consistently every single day it's not hard to say add 300Kcal to your budget. There's a lot of nice treats that fit into that. I certainly wouldn't call it negligible. Diet is still going to be the main factor but exercise can make a sizable difference to a lot of people in terms of being able to fit something tasty into their day. Which can make the rest of a diet infinitely more sustainable because you don't feel like you're depriving yourself of anything.
fatlogic,fezsscw,t1_feyoz5y,1579461189.0,"You should take it into account though. If I spend 3-4 hours in the gym as I sometimes do I can burn quite a large amount. And that does need to be taken into account. If I didn't I'd drop weight rather quickly.

And if you're fat because you consistently ate 300 calories over maintenance, like I was once upon a time, you can manage that fine by just an hour or two of exercise. Problem is you'd need to do it every single day 7 days a week. And besides myself and pro athletes I know very few people willing to do that in addition to their normal lives.

TL:DR it is possible to rely on caloric burn from exercise to stay lean, but it requires a level of dedication most people can't manage."

MemeHunter,fdsha8r,t1_fdqoctq,1578702728.0,"> What's not to love?

The fact that in most of the story she's an idiot. Think back a moment, how often has she just run ahead in dangerous poorly explored areas? Realistically how often should she have gotten killed because of that by now? Of particular note here is the deviljho quest. She should have been dead there because she decided to be an idiot and go gather stuff alone in an area known to be filled with dangerous monsters she knows she can't handle.

If it wasn't for that one thing I probably wouldn't dislike her honestly. It just feels like she's cheated death way too much for my liking though. Do something stupid, get consequences. If a character avoids consequences once, okay. But if a character consistently avoids the logical consequences of their actions it gets rather obnoxious to me."
MemeHunter,fdsgqec,t1_fdqu84b,1578702407.0,I'm not a fan of serious handler. But the way that the normal handler is portrayed as an absolute retard in most of the quests in the game does not help her. Seriously how many times has she run ahead and or fallen down something right in front of a dangerous monster? Of particular note is the deviljho introduction quest here. That's what I hate about her for the most part. Although I am much more moderate in my dislike than a lot of the hate I see online so maybe there's more to it. Or maybe it's just online circlejerk mentality.
MemeHunter,fdsgeqa,t1_fdr86b6,1578702213.0,I'd doubt the smart part. I mean how fucking often does she run ahead of the experienced hunter right into a fucking monster. Remember the intro quest for deviljho? She's not smart in the slightest. That's my main issue with her character. Well that and being stuck slowwalking behind an NPC in a game where I usually have the freedom to do what I want is also a good way to get me to hate a character.

quityourbullshit,fdh8tef,t1_fdg6v7g,1578417874.0,"> Would this money not be better donated to an Australian party that apposes climate change and doesn't cut funding to firefighters?

No, because politics is a money black hole. And the problems are never simple. When whatever party you send the money to gets in power there's a very real chance they simply change stance. Because the status quo is where the money and power are. And power as we all know corrupts.

At least in donating to firefighters you get an immediate return along your expectations. They'll use the money to do their job. With politics you're taking a gamble on whatever new party not just doing the same things because of the various pressures in place. And that's not that favorable a gamble IMO.

grandorder,fc9x9ia,t1_fc9sr8y,1577559563.0,"I guess our difference lies in what we think is riskier. I'd see blindly trusting the mages/church/UN not to be entirely evil as a much greater risk than for example hiding Kiritsugu. I wouldn't estimate his risk of being caught much greater than Holmes' personally.

>Sure First Hassan and Kiritsugu could kill everyone in the room, but could they do so before a bullet from one of 40 guards hits Ritsuka and successfully evacuate him and Mash from the observatory, then keep them safe for the rest of their lives from every major organization while living in hiding?

Maybe maybe not, it's a better shot than having nothing though. Better a flimsy 1% chance of not being murdered than a guaranteed death. That of course relies on the assassin in question being able to hide reliably though. And as far as I'm aware we don't really have any solid info on how well they'd be able to do that. Considering all the skills and abilities we know they have I'd expect them to be able to hide fine personally. If they'd just get detected we would indeed probably be in a lot more trouble than before assuming they're not evil. It's a gamble either way, and I don't think we have enough solid info to really know which gamble would be more favorable. Which makes it all the worse that it's not even mentioned as an option that was considered and rejected or anything.

Of course in the context of this story the writers know that the mages won't kill us so they don't even try to account for the possibility. Which I think is a shame. It's a pretty good opportunity for character development to have people disagree on how best to proceed. Canonically those discussions have to have happened anyway. No way the *everyone* just agrees to this without some convincing. But they decided to just cut all that and go with ""everyone just has blind faith that the mages/church/UN aren't evil or at least won't try to kill us"".

They could have made the point in game that a backup is too risky for reason X or Y. But instead they just skip on that explanation all together. Maybe I misunderstand the detection capabilities they have. Maybe I overestimate the ability of assassins to hide. That could all be the case. But as it stands both of us are grasping at straws because these concepts are kinda underdeveloped in game. Unless my memory is completely failing me. In which case that's my bad."

Well you're arguing against a point I didn't make here. Keep some insurance, that does not mean keep everyone around. That'd obviously not work.

>And of all the Servants, Holmes seems like the only one fully able to avoid Chaldea’s detection

I highly doubt that, Holmes is pretty much just relying on his smarts to do this. I'm fairly certain there's servants far better suited to avoiding detection. Someone like assassin Emiya for example should be perfectly suitable that that sort of role.

>Plus, with all of the singularities taken care of, the only reason for them to stick around would be to either just mess around or fight modern humans.

No, you don't have them stick around indefinitely. That wasn't the point I made. You have someone suited to it stick around long enough to ensure your own damn survival and to ensure chaldea doesn't immediately get burned to the ground for knowing too much/being too powerful.

Chaldea would still be in a lot of trouble in an all out war scenario. But being able to fight back and have some kind of ability to *maybe* survive is better than just outright dying. Especially if there is no cost to just having the backup. As with any backup, pray that you never have to use it but for gods sake have it prepared just in case.

If you don't use the backup, great. Get rid of them after it's clear you won't die. Not before. Things would largely play out the same. You'd just have the extra insurance that you won't just be outright murdered. After all, we broke every rule in the book. Who's to say we're not in for an outright execution right away?

Big difference between being prepared to deal with a possibility VS actively working to make that possibility a reality.

Media isn't really relevant as magic is hidden from the world. Good PR doesn't apply so much when neither side is known to the public.

What they should've done IMO is almost the same as what they did, just with minor modifications. Instead of just hiding holmes hide him and someone with combat capabilities as a last resort. See how things play out in the knowledge that if the association turns out to be the greater evil that you can at least fight back to a degree. Again only as a last resort.

The main problem I have with the plan isn't the plan itself but rather the complete lack of any sort of backup if it fails. Plans fail all the time, and if you have the resources to have a backup plan you should always have one. Preferably several even. Basically IMO risk reduction is the name of the game, and chaldea is not playing it.

I really don't see all the servants just leaving without leaving someone combat capable behind. I'd expect at least a few of them to say ""hang on what if the mages decide you know too much and just kill you?"" and try to set up a plan for that.

And considering this organization was all that stood between humanity and annihilation a very short while ago I would not take the risk of them deciding we've seen too much and know too much and just killing us. At least putting an insurance policy in place for that scenario might be good. And yeah Gudao probably wouldn't think of that but you can't fucking tell me none of the servants had anything to say about that.

Beside holmes just hide one combat capable servant, just in case of the mages association deciding to murder us because we know too much and this problem is solved. Yeah if that situation happens chaldea would still be in a lot of trouble after all we need outside help.

Secondarily it's not demanding people know everything we know, just enough to do their job. A car mechanic for example can't expect customers to know how to fix their own car. But they can definitely expect them to be able to *drive* the damn car. 

And that's where the disconnect happens. Because with IT you find people who rely on a computer to do every single part of their job that still don't know how to use the PC in any way. We can't expect people to know how to open a PC and repair anything. But surely we can expect that someone who's entire job is PC based knows how to restart a machine?"

If you can't find online reviews done by people with a similar head shape to you.

grandorder,fc9x9ia,t1_fc9sr8y,1577559563.0,"I guess our difference lies in what we think is riskier. I'd see blindly trusting the mages/church/UN not to be entirely evil as a much greater risk than for example hiding Kiritsugu. I wouldn't estimate his risk of being caught much greater than Holmes' personally.

>Sure First Hassan and Kiritsugu could kill everyone in the room, but could they do so before a bullet from one of 40 guards hits Ritsuka and successfully evacuate him and Mash from the observatory, then keep them safe for the rest of their lives from every major organization while living in hiding?

Maybe maybe not, it's a better shot than having nothing though. Better a flimsy 1% chance of not being murdered than a guaranteed death. That of course relies on the assassin in question being able to hide reliably though. And as far as I'm aware we don't really have any solid info on how well they'd be able to do that. Considering all the skills and abilities we know they have I'd expect them to be able to hide fine personally. If they'd just get detected we would indeed probably be in a lot more trouble than before assuming they're not evil. It's a gamble either way, and I don't think we have enough solid info to really know which gamble would be more favorable. Which makes it all the worse that it's not even mentioned as an option that was considered and rejected or anything.

Of course in the context of this story the writers know that the mages won't kill us so they don't even try to account for the possibility. Which I think is a shame. It's a pretty good opportunity for character development to have people disagree on how best to proceed. Canonically those discussions have to have happened anyway. No way the *everyone* just agrees to this without some convincing. But they decided to just cut all that and go with ""everyone just has blind faith that the mages/church/UN aren't evil or at least won't try to kill us"".

They could have made the point in game that a backup is too risky for reason X or Y. But instead they just skip on that explanation all together. Maybe I misunderstand the detection capabilities they have. Maybe I overestimate the ability of assassins to hide. That could all be the case. But as it stands both of us are grasping at straws because these concepts are kinda underdeveloped in game. Unless my memory is completely failing me. In which case that's my bad."
grandorder,fc91t2g,t1_fc8si40,1577545656.0,"> Even if Chaldea kept every servant around

Well you're arguing against a point I didn't make here. Keep some insurance, that does not mean keep everyone around. That'd obviously not work.

>And of all the Servants, Holmes seems like the only one fully able to avoid Chaldeaâ€™s detection

I highly doubt that, Holmes is pretty much just relying on his smarts to do this. I'm fairly certain there's servants far better suited to avoiding detection. Someone like assassin Emiya for example should be perfectly suitable that that sort of role.

>Plus, with all of the singularities taken care of, the only reason for them to stick around would be to either just mess around or fight modern humans.

No, you don't have them stick around indefinitely. That wasn't the point I made. You have someone suited to it stick around long enough to ensure your own damn survival and to ensure chaldea doesn't immediately get burned to the ground for knowing too much/being too powerful.

Chaldea would still be in a lot of trouble in an all out war scenario. But being able to fight back and have some kind of ability to *maybe* survive is better than just outright dying. Especially if there is no cost to just having the backup. As with any backup, pray that you never have to use it but for gods sake have it prepared just in case.

If you don't use the backup, great. Get rid of them after it's clear you won't die. Not before. Things would largely play out the same. You'd just have the extra insurance that you won't just be outright murdered. After all, we broke every rule in the book. Who's to say we're not in for an outright execution right away?

Big difference between being prepared to deal with a possibility VS actively working to make that possibility a reality.

Media isn't really relevant as magic is hidden from the world. Good PR doesn't apply so much when neither side is known to the public.

What they should've done IMO is almost the same as what they did, just with minor modifications. Instead of just hiding holmes hide him and someone with combat capabilities as a last resort. See how things play out in the knowledge that if the association turns out to be the greater evil that you can at least fight back to a degree. Again only as a last resort.

The main problem I have with the plan isn't the plan itself but rather the complete lack of any sort of backup if it fails. Plans fail all the time, and if you have the resources to have a backup plan you should always have one. Preferably several even. Basically IMO risk reduction is the name of the game, and chaldea is not playing it. And since literally the fate of humanity rested on their shoulders not that long ago I think that's rather a bad thing."

I really don't see all the servants just leaving without leaving someone combat capable behind.

And considering this organization was all that stood between humanity and annihilation a very short while ago I would not take the risk of them deciding we've seen too much and know too much and just killing us. At least putting an insurance policy in place for that scenario might be good. And yeah Gudao probably wouldn't think of that but you can't fucking tell me none of the servants had anything to say about that.

Beside holmes just hide one combat capable servant, just in case of the mages association deciding to murder us because we know too much and this problem is solved. Yeah if that situation happens chaldea would still be in a lot of trouble after all we need outside help.
