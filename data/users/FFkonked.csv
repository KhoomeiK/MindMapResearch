fatlogic,fef676m,t1_feekf0h,1579049132.0,"I think it has more to do with the fact people dont understand diets. A diet isnt something you do for a week or two and go back to eatting like shit. 

if you lose weight you'll gain it back if you return to those eatting habits, for most thats a hard one since they've probably been eatting like that for most of they're lives. Snacks are loaded with empty calories and should be avoided same with soda and juice.

just cutting out those 3 will do wonders for people."
