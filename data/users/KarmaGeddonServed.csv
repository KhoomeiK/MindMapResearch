On a side note, I’m a mother with a kid with autism. I’m really concerned that you’re using the word ‘disabled’. My kid was diagnosed 10 years ago, (he’s 16 now), and I’ve never heard anybody who is part of his care or education refer to his Autism as a disability. It’s certainly not something I would say. Language matters. If you ask my son, he’d just say his brain works differently from other people’s. Because that is how it has been explained to him. It isn’t about ability or disability, it’s about needing different tools and resources to accomplish the same things. We all have our strengths and weaknesses. We all focus on our strengths, and my son is fortunate enough to to have people around him that help him do that, as well as assist him in navigating through his weaknesses. That’s my opinion anyways.
