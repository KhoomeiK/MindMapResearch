FragileWhiteRedditor,ff9y94a,t1_ff9hsgq,1579724093.0,"I think that’s the Liberal answer but not too close to the truth of the situation. 

Assuming for the sake of argument that none of this stuff is driven by bigotry (huge assumption and ONLY for the sake of argument, tons of this stuff is driven by bigotry alone), middle class people in positions of privilege experience suffering in their lives too. But they have better tools to cope with and deal with it. What they don’t realize is how much better off they are than those with less privilege. However they still suffer A LOT under neoliberal economic policies, so when someone else complains about their suffering it seems like “I’m suffering too, why should they get help when I don’t?”

 And the people with economic power have a lot of interest in keeping people fighting one another, so you end up with fear mongering media encouraging bigotry. And it’s not like the rich people are just the ones in control of the media, oftentimes they are the media. 

And no, I’m not naive enough to think that redistributing wealth will solve bigotry. That’s going to take a whole lot of work and possibly another march to the sea."
todayilearned,ff9v40m,t1_ff9405q,1579722130.0,"Most likely some kind of bravado that someone wrote down. 

Alternatively, if you’re simply fleeing and don’t have a particular direction there’s a good chance you’re running parallel to the wind (provided your ship is square rigged) or 3/4 to the wind. This would put you potentially into a downwind position which means your cannons are elevated relative to the enemy ship so they’ll most likely damage sails and rigging if they land hits at all, but won’t penetrate the ship at or near the waterline. Why would this be the case? Because the wind is literally pushing the ship over and tilting it. 

It’s because of this that the English preferred fighting naval battles from an upwind position - their cannonballs would be more likely to strike at or below the waterline. How would they strike below the waterline? Well, remember the enemy ship would be heeled over (sometimes quite a bit) because they’re downwind. So if they were to come about for any reason or the winds were to shift or die down, the part you made holes in would go from being above the waterline to below the waterline. This isn’t instantly fatal, mind you, as all these ships would’ve had pumps. But it takes crew to man the pumps, crew that could’ve been doing something else. Also that damage would’ve slowed the ship down. 

But you could also flee upwind if your ship has better rigging for it and is smaller / lighter. 

Naval combat of this era was extremely strategic and dependent on a shitload of factors."

beholdthemasterrace,ff6zjf7,t1_ff6xqf0,1579638111.0,"Occupy was never directly in contention with violent extremism. And again the Tea Party was bought and paid for to be nonviolent and appealing. 

Antifa is not an organized movement per se, and operates mainly for intelligence gathering and outing Nazis. The reason there are violent confrontations is because fascism is inherently based on direct violence. The tea party’s violence is all indirect (economic, policing, wars, etc). 

I think your biggest mistake is thinking the tea party isn’t also inherently violent - the violence of the tea party is just removed from your life experience and hasn’t been framed by the media as violence. Insofar as the TP is an outgrowth of the early 2000s neocons, one could trace violence by them all the way to the GWOT. Domestically their policies violently affect people of color and immigrants in the US, as well as anybody dependent on social services. Thing is that isn’t as visible to most people as a fascist running people over with his car. The damage is far more widespread and lasting, however."

I’m not sure about most. I’ve encountered plenty who are very anti-gun but very far left. Their response to the idea of violence against them seems to mostly be lay over and die which.... I don’t understand at all. 

Personally, since nobody asked me, I do think a socialist state can be achieved through elections alone. Will this happen in a reasonable timeframe in the United States? Doubtful. But it’s possible. Significant gun control should not be a part of that path, however. Firearms have been vital to civil liberties in the US, including playing a large part in the CRM in the 60s. 

But racists will always want firearms to be totally unrestricted because they can be used as a tool of oppression as much as liberation. Thing is, I don’t want the nazis to be the only ones with guns."
SocialistRA,feyiuk0,t1_fex8amy,1579446016.0,The two biggest problems Cuba faces are economic warfare from the US (embargoes) and authoritarianism.

Most communist nations turned authoritarian because the communist language was used as a propaganda tool to inspire people to join what would otherwise be a pretty fascist regime.
