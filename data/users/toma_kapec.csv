no amount of knowledge will help you become charismatic you need experience! What you said can and it doesn't nees to be true but if it is or isnt wont change anything! You need to meet new people guys, gilrs, grandmas, old ladies, kids
anyone! Il tell this a hundred, a thousand times if i need to!

Push your damn comfort zone and talk with anyone on the street

Start by asking for directions then level it up from there...

Now honestly:

When you get to my level you gonna just come into a room and make everyone there your friend but sometimes everyone will hate you and that is okay!

What you wrote is half right half wrong! 
It really doesn't  matter the gender but the age could be the factor. When i am talking to girls my age i set the standars but when i talk to older girls it's not like that!

(P. S it really doesn't matter i just love theorising cause i am a nerd but all you said is unrelated to making friends!)"
