You can definitely reach 127 pounds before March. Check out the [keto calculator](https://keto-calculator.ankerl.com) to see how many calories you should be eating; the only way to lose weight is to be in a caloric deficit so the bigger your deficit the more weight you'll lose. 15g of carbs is fine, many people do a 20g daily net carb limit but that's up to you."
