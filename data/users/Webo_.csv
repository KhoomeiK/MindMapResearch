A) the members of the Triumvirate were using each other for their own ends, it's a lot easier to get enemies to work together if they all think they can eventually screw each other over and come out on top and B) this is a common Historian's fallacy, it was a perfect storm of factors that allowed it to succeed, and political alliances weren't uncommon in the Roman Republic.

>The entire goal for roman men was to become powerful like Caesar and he was the only one who pulled it off during the Republic. 

Dictatorial powers had been invoked in times of crisis multiple times in Roman history prior to Caeser, if anything Octavian should get the credit for this for holding on to power after Caeser's assassination

>The rest of the emporers stood on the shoulders of Caesar. I mean come on dude there is a reason Russia and Germany used his name as a symbol of power.

Again, Augustus bigged up Caeser's achievements in order to prove his divine right to rule; other emperors followed suit because they didn't want to be overthrown. Russia and Germany simply mimicked the Caesers.

>Also that wasn't luck. Caesar speed of action constantly fucked up his opponents plans. He did it to everyone. The gauls, the other generals Caesar faced. One of Caesars best attributes was the ability to get shit done faster than anyone else alive. Pompeii knew how many men he could count on in the region, he just didn't think Caesar could get there so quickly. He expected he could get his army from Spain there if Caesar tried anything and he was wrong. There are writings describing him writing 7 letters and dictating notes all while marching his army day and night to out maneuver people politically and upset their plans militarily.

Caeser only 'out maneouvered' the senate through the Triumvirate, so nothing massively impressive there considering it consisted of *three of the most powerful politicians in Rome*. He also was only able to defeat Pompey through sheer luck, he took a gamble in crossing the Rubicon and Pompey fell for it by thinking he had a much larger army than he actually did and so he fled allowing Caeser to divide and conquer. 

Caeser was impressive but he got lucky. History is too kind to him because he was the victor and Augustus bigged up his achievements in order to consolidate his right to rule."

Thanks for your reply! I'm not massively worried at a master's making me over-qualified, I've seen a few threads asking if over-qualification seems to be a barrier for JET and the general consensus was no as some people had been accepted even though they had doctorates etc., but I suppose it's something to keep in mind.

I understand your point completely. We both have degrees and a pulse so in that regard we're qualified; if one or both of us are rejected, that's just life. I only included that information so I wouldn't get comments about if both of us are qualified for the JET programme/if one of us has more relevant experience than the other etc.; we both have similar academic backgrounds and if we're rejected it probably won't be due to them.

I myself have been accepted for an interview, and all I have applicable to this job is a degree. Anyone I know currently in the program is similar.

I didn't mean to insinuate that we're assuming we'll automatically recieve offers, just that our qualifications aren't our primary concern (we may very well be rejected for other reasons) and that we don't need help on that front; but thanks I guess.

You've hit the nail on the head. I primarily game on PC and whilst I was tempted by some of the PS4 exclusives they were just too few and far between, and the overall experience on the console itself would have been worse than what I was used to. The only console I ever seriously considered was the Switch because I just couldn't replicate that experience on a PC; I bought one last year and it's been everything I hoped for and much more. It's a good time to be a Nintendo fan."
