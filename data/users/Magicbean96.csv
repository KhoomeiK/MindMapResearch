Not the same person but when I did my first aid training someone there was so large they were unable to complete the cpr training because of their weight. Yet they still passed the course. If a child is in need of cpr and they are the first aider they are not going to get help. It's stupid and not safe."

Due to a condition called neurofibromatosis:

You will probably get a migraine, if this happens just let yourself vomit and go to sleep it's better that way.

You will feel constantly dizzy and may lose your balance while standing, just grab something to stop yourself going down.


Your wrist feels broken all the time due to a tumor on the nerve endings don't worry it's normal and if it gets too bad you have enough pain killers to kill an elephant.


You also have benign tumours all over your stomach, right arm chest and bum these ones do not hurt though.

Do NOT eat bananas, it's not worth the pain or nausea."
fatlogic,feqgck8,t1_feonlhl,1579341533.0,"Not anorexic but I was bulimic for years which developed kind of along side a very restrictive and low calorie diet. There was about 8 *safe* foods I would eat. But would also binge and purge on other foods multiple times a day. For a while I was underweight and incredibly thin but the restrictive diet fizzled out and I gained some weight which I hated. For most of my bulimia I was eating normally while also binging and purging and wishing i could get back to my underweight self. However during my recovery from bulimia I gained a lot of weight and ended up being about 14lbs over weight. Which I didn't seem to care about, and for a while tried to get on board with the body positivity movement and kept telling my self ""hey at least your not bulimic anymore"" but in reality I was not ok with my new big body.
I am now a healthy weight and am working on a healthy relationship with food."
