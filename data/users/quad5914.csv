if it wants to store a file, the head moves to a specific area of the disk and magnetises those little spots (it writes the binary data of a file, in 1s and 0s. e.g. magnetised = 1, not magnetised = 0).

Electricity,fdny0a7,t3_emc5rz,1578595145.0,"shorting a car battery produces lots of sparks because of the huge amount of current flowing. low voltage + high current = reckless but big sparks. high voltage + low current = steady(ish) and direct sparks.

and also, shorting a car battery is the worst thing you can ever do. every time you short a car battery you kill it more and more. thats why over-time a car battery goes from being able to deliver 1000+ amps to only say 100 amps. that huge current spike can destroy stuff inside the battery itself and wear it out. whereas if you draw 10-50 amps from it over the same time, it will do far less damage. think of it as tapping a cymbal quite fast vs slamming it every few minutes."

730 hours in a month (roughly) so it'd use roughly say 51kW over 1 month (70 watt-hours \* 730 hours). in the UK, it's 15p per kW so £0.15 \* 51 is between **£7 to £9 roughly over 1 month**. but it really depends how long your fridge is on for. mine turns on every 10 or so minutes, for a few minutes."
Electricity,fdjwryo,t1_fdjlm7f,1578489997.0,"anything can build up a charge. everything has a capacitance to ground, like you. when you rub your feet on a carpet, because carpets are odd like lots of fabrics (more like good at giving away charges), they can give away charges and make you slightly positively charged (though it might be negatively... charges run from you to ground so its probably negatively) . then if you touch ground all that charges goes to ground sometimes as a spark.

but if you only touch the 240v AC wire, there's only a tiny bit of current flowing from 240v,through you and to ground (because ground is connected to neutral through the earth). and if you don't touch ground, then the electrons won't move because they cant; there's no complete circuit. they'll just sit there in the wire but once you touch ground again, there's a high resistance circuit completed between 240v, you and ground so electrons will just flow through you and not stay there."
