You do not *need* to have kids, and you are not ""doing the kids a favour"" by having them. The only reason to have children is because you want them, and doing whatever you want, ignoring the fact that you don't actually have the means to do it, is incredibly irresponsible.

Basically, she wasn't going to win anyway, so ""losing her advantage"" made little difference.

I'm confused why you would even mention stopping the men's race however? There would be absolutely no reason too. They were meant to be ahead, and they still were, so whats the problem.

Overall I can't see myself failing that.

The only issue with finishing my degree is it's going to take another 5.5 years to do it, and I'm going to have to find another job in around 1.5, so I'm not sure it's worth trying to find another job that will give me enough time to do my degree for 4 years rather than just joining up in a year and a half.

As for the officer option... I've been told it's almost entirely administrative. I'd still like to be on the ""practical"" side of things for a good while yet."
RoyalNavy,feumtwp,t1_feulcpa,1579388003.0,"I had looked at that. My issue there is that since I'm unlikely to be offered a job at the end of my apprenticeship (due to the company's financial situation, not any issues on my part), I would have to find another job for the 4 years it would take me to finish my degree.

My issue there is that the sorts of roles I would be looking at are mostly field service with a lot of travel involved, so I would have issues finding the time to complete my degree anyway. Even if I took a role without travel, my apprenticeship has taught me I'm a sucker for overtime so I'll have time issues no matter what.

I also had a chat with someone from this sub who told me officer roles are pretty much entirely administrative in engineering so, while of course I recognise my experience on the practical side would give me a better understanding of what the navy people on the practical side are doing, I cant help but feel my apprenticeship would be a bit wasted if I went straight into that. So I think I'd rather enter in a practical role."
RoyalNavy,feukupn,t1_feui587,1579387495.0,"Any and all advice is welcome believe me!

I'm not really in a rush to join. I have the qualifications needed for the role now, but I want to complete my apprenticeship first. 

So its less that I'm in a rush and more that I want to join at a specific time. My apprenticeship concludes at the end of August 2021 (and due to the company's financial situation it is exceedingly unlikely I will be offered a job), and I was told at the AFCO one of the ""intakes"" is in september, so that lines up very nicely for me.

So I will finish the HNC and NVQ as part of my apprenticeship before joining. The issue with the degree is that, since I'm taking it part time alongside work, it will take 6 years to complete, that means 4 years beyond the end of the apprenticeship. So I would have to find another job for those 4 years which gives me enough free time to do my degree on the side, and given the sort of roles I'm looking at (field service, with quite a lot of travel) this would be unlikely anyway.

Its interesting you mention pushing back my entry date as I had heard about doing this before, so had asked at the AFCO if it was worth applying now and pushing my entry date until the end of my apprenticeship, and was told I would need to enter on whichever intake I was given since the role is apparently quite competitive."

In the books we were introduced to the city through carrot because that was the first book in the series. If they want to skip to a point where the watch was established, they could have done the same thing through the eyes of another character.

To me, there's two ways they could have gone with this. 

If they want to keep things more serious, use a recruit we don't really know. Introduce all the characters we already know from a third party perspective. If they want the character to not be a complete rookie, they could have used the system where the watches from different cities were swapping some officers around. So you get an experienced Watchman, but someone who's still new to the city.

If they wanted to make things a little more light-hearted (or this could even work as an occational cutaway from the main story), Nobby and Colon.

Don't parents tell you you should always be honest with them? That you should tell them what you're feeling so they can help you?

Reguardless of all that, they still made a decision which effects her so, whether or not her opinion changes anything, she has a right to voice it."
AmItheAsshole,femepru,t1_femefjb,1579251632.0,"Ffs... You can share whatever opinions you like. Again, it is the PARENT'S choice whether or not that opinion changes their minds, it's not your job to decide that for them."

AmItheAsshole,fema1pj,t1_fem9r5y,1579245429.0,"> if OP wants to refuse

That's just the point though, they shouldn't have to ""refuse"", it shouldn't be expected that they'd help.

As for the noise complaints... OP's parents need to understand what time of life OP is in now. Given 2-3 years, they'd be off to uni, and the parents could do whatever they liked without bothering anyone. The fact is they didn't wait 2-3 years, seemly so that OP was around to help (which we've established they don't want to do).

It's not overwhelmingly self centred to complain about a choice someone else made which will negatively effect your life, especially when they expect you to be happy about it."
AmItheAsshole,fem9jne,t1_fem9hc3,1579244817.0,"Which, the way they're phrasing it, puts an obligation upon OP. That's not okay."
AmItheAsshole,fem9h4a,t1_felufkx,1579244734.0,"The way the mother phrased it was as an obligation though. There was no ""if you want to"", it was just ""you will do this""."
AmItheAsshole,fem9b38,t1_felyo5t,1579244538.0,"Actually her parents said it was.

""And we have you to babysit if we need a break"". Reguardless of context, I'm not seeing any element of choice in that statement."

They do get to have an opinion. You can have an opinion on whatever you like. Whether the parents take any notice of their opinion is up to them, but OP is fully entitled to their opinion."
AmItheAsshole,fem8xfq,t1_felhij7,1579244103.0,"I think OP's parents could have phrased it better.

""And if you like you can take care of the baby sometimes"" sounds a lot better than ""and if we need a break, you can babysit"". The second one sounds like OP has no choice in the matter."

AmItheAsshole,fejuyws,t1_fejuooc,1579186452.0,"Asking repeatedly for sex, and the person relenting, is not rape. It may be sexual harassment, but it isn't rape.

If you *threaten* someone, i.e. ""have sex with me or I will hurt you"", yes that's rape. If there is an implied threat, for example not allowing someone to leave, then yes it could be argued that that is rape.

""Wearing someone down"" is not rape. It might be a shitty thing to do, and of course makes you look desperate beyond all belief, but it isn't rape."
