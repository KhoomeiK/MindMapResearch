history,ff30glz,t3_er5g3w,1579530347.0,"The restored bus where history took place is on display at The Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. When we went there, there was a very knowledgeable and personable docent on the bus who knew many of the things mentioned here. She told us the story of both Claudette Colvin and Rosa Parks and pointed out the specific seat she was sitting in (much to the surprise of my son who was sitting in it). I’m not really a spiritual person but as I left I touched the back of the seat and felt a little flutter in my soul. If you are anywhere near Detroit I highly recommend going. It’s an amazing museum but Rosa’s (and Claudette’s) bus alone is worth the trip."

madmagazine,feckjea,t1_fdyr0mn,1578976161.0,"In 1898 in Wilmington N.C. the towns African American people  had formed a successful middle class community complete with black owned businesses, banks, stores, law offices and doctors offices, a local newspaper and  elected political office holders. The state white militia members, ate up with jealousy, invaded the town, burned down the businesses, murdered citizens in the street, overthrew the local government and forced any black survivors out of town. The justification? Black bucks were after the defenseless young white women, randomly raping and defiling them.
Once again, this time in 1920 in the Tulsa, the district of Greenwood had developed into an affluent black community complete with black owned drug stores, grocery stores, clothing and hardware stores, theaters and banks, with black professionals practicing law, medicine and finance. In fact Greenwood was known as the black Wall Street. Once again white mobs, driven by hatred and jealousy attacked the black community. The justification? A young black teen had been accused  of the assault of a young white woman and had been taken into custody. Fearing a lynching a group of local black men stood their ground to protect him. Once again militia was utilized, burning down the town, this time using WWI era aircraft to drop incendiary bombs. 
And here we are, well into the 21st century with the same old lame ass black bucks are gonna defile your defenseless white women bullshit."

That’s sounds great, less stress is always good but the article makes little attempt to define exactly what mindfulness is or how to achieve it. If this is a good thing it needs to be explained, that is my point and very view articles that talk about mindfulness seem to do that."

What bugs me is the way “hip” people pick up on a new term and drive it into the ground, often time never really understanding what it means, just parroting it because it sounds cool. Seems to me parroting the term mindful or mindfulness rather than describing the process just cheapens it. Do you love sitting on the front porch on a warm summer night listening to the crickets, hearing a train whistle off in the distance, watching the fireflies? Than say so, don’t just call it mindfulness. Describe it, make it come to life, don’t put it in a pocket, jeesh!"
