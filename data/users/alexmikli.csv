KotakuInAction,fflwwrx,t1_ffk14w0,1580045139.0,"I think ""transsexual"" might have been the appropriate word here. It's not used that much anymore, people will still get pissed off, but it's more ""old timey"" than a lot of the words today, still in keeping with Goemon's usage here. Though considering you said it was said in a ""casual"" way, ""tranny"" might still be appropriate as a translation. I just think that the Japanese word isn't used the way we use that word in English these days."

Too well known, too badly handled by it's current owners, and as a Fallout lore nerd since the Bibles came out, I feel bad even thinking of tweaking the setting in even minor ways.

Also what the hell do I do with Psykers? Bestiaries beyond the typical ones we had repeated 7 games in a row? If I ran a game set, in say, the Great Winter of the 2130's, the lack of super mutants may disappoint some players as well.
