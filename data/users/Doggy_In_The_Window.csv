nfl,ffdq4jh,t1_ffdpqp4,1579826269.0,"What kills me is that he was so close to scoring on that botched snap when he ran for the TD. His lineman quit on the play basically rather than playing to the whistle so he got tackled just shy of the end zone, had he scored the narrative would have completely changed."
nfl,ffdoojc,t1_ffdoihd,1579825362.0,"That’s fair. If it wasn’t for all the injuries I’d go with Romo personally, but I’m probably a bit biased. Injury history and unavailability accounted for though gotta go with Rivers."
nfl,ffd5z18,t1_ffd3by2,1579814075.0,"They were always pretty much neck and neck. I always saw Rivers as the Romo of the AFC, skill-wise. That said, there were better QBs to never make it to the Super Bowl."

nfl,ff3v21r,t1_ff3e4po,1579549477.0,"What kills me most is that had his lineman blocked for him on the botched snap, he gets a touchdown and the narrative changes completely.

Edit: I say botched snap, the snap was fine, poor word choice."

nfl,feb9jdp,t1_feayqc7,1578956605.0,Eagles were beyond lifeless in some positions and still won the division. Pederson is a hell of a coach.
nfl,feb8pwp,t1_feb6cxa,1578956445.0,BOB is such an oddity to me. I have no clue where I’d rank him.
cowboys,fe6pziq,t1_fe6ahp8,1578900003.0,"Seriously, I hate this narrative so much. Anyone can watch that play and see a blatant face mask that wasn’t called either."
politics,fdp9ncz,t1_fdp9ew8,1578623239.0,"I don’t think it’s so much a matter of supporting Iran (at least I hope not) as much as it is just wanting to avoid another war in the Middle East. Obviously the USA’s military capabilities dwarf theirs but it still means lives lost for both sides, and soldiers away from their families."
