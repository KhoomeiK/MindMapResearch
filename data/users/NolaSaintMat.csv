neighborsfromhell,ffal148,t1_ff8s63r,1579738408.0,"Exactly. If you're cleaning the entire house, scrubbing floors and whatnot, you don't want to stop and haul trash out in the middle of it. You wait until it's all done and you've emptied all the trash cans, thrown out all the used cleaning supplies and whatever you've ""decluttered"" in the process. 

Once you've actually finished everything you trudge down to the dumpster to toss out your garbage so when you get back you can sit down, rest and enjoy the sparkling cleanliness of your home."

Turn his attempt to be a dick into a symbol of pride! Embrace it fully and proudly. 

As stated above, the starfish is known for its ability to regenerate its limbs and even its entire body. This teaches you to trust in your ability to renew yourself so you can be a different but better person. The meaning of the starfish speaks about guidance and inspiration. When you are at a crossroads, you can find the answers that you need from the meaning of the starfish. It teaches you to cure yourself over time, fill up the void, and replace it with something better.


“The Starfish is a universal and celestial symbol of infinite divine love. It has been used to represent the Virgin Mary – or Stella Maris, which means Star of the Sea – an ancient title she goes by because she is believed to lovingly intercede as a guide and protector of those who travel over troubled waters or seek their livelihoods on the sea. For this reason she is also seen as an emblem of salvation during trying times, which the Starfish reflects in this mirroring symbolism. In addition to love, the Starfish also emanates the energies of inspiration, guidance, brilliance, intuition, and vigilance, with its connection to the stars"""

relationship_advice,fcvvrum,t1_fcvblf2,1578011208.0,"He means you're only temporary. Please know you deserve so much more from a partner than someone who is just using you until someone (they think) is better comes along. I know it can be scary to step away from something you've grown comfy with but it isn't good for you in any shape or form. If you don't think you can do the ""band-aid method"" and rip it off all at once and walk away, take small steps away. Don't answer every call...don't respond to his texts for hours, then go longer and longer between seeing him and depending on him for your happiness. Find something else to occupy that space.  Whether it's a new or old hobby or craft. Maybe it's taking a walk or listening to/making music, reading/writing. Something to help redirect that energy from him to yourself. 

Anyone who has zero problem telling you straight to your face that they don't find you ""enough"" but doesn't have the decency and the courage to actually leave you alone is a heaping pile of garbage and the sooner you can get away the better. I'm sure you've got so much to offer someone who deserves it and can appreciate it. This jackhole is neither! I'll be happy to be an ear to listen and/or shoulder to lean on and/or just the void to scream into if you need it. Sending lots of positive energy to you. You've got this!!

Edit: I was trying to be nice but I'm sorry...the more I think about it the more dumbfounded I get. What an utter piece of absolutle sh*t he is to demand something so intimate from you yet not even attempt to be a decent human. F*ck him and everything he is. I hope for his sake he grows out of his stupidity and disgusting behavior. Nobody deserves to be treated like he's treating (treated) you."
