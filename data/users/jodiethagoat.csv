socialanxiety,ff4owzd,t3_erl52i,1579568908.0,"I’m a mature for my age, I guess (16m) and I sometimes get ridiculed by that “one person” in class for no reason. At the same time, I’m trying my best to take being made fun of or criticized like a man."

confidence,ff42sp5,t3_erj7kd,1579554301.0,"So I’m apart of the young teenage generation (16m) and social media (instagram) messes everything up. No one is loyal anymore. All the boys are dogs and the girls seek attention, followers, likes, and dm’s from guys they won’t talk to.
Basically the pretty girls get all the attention while the “not so good looking” girls don’t. I want the pretty girl right? But I wouldn’t be surprised if she is talking to a guy on the side."

introvert,ff1lu1c,t3_er1s6d,1579481299.0,"I think I’m running away from being my true self (personality), because teens will judge. Sometimes its hard being ridiculed, and not thinking about it at night, that shit hurts people. This is relatable and I’m in my junior year."

socialanxiety,ferp45x,t3_eqcbc9,1579356735.0,I be making sure I’m not darting my eyes all around the room because people will stare and think I’m weird/got a problem. But really it’s just my anxiety messing with my head and I’m listening to it.
