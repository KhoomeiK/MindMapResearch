Topic change: I have questions now that we have someone who’s there. 

How are on street parked cars marked so plows don’t hit them? 

Have you ventured out to check on elderly neighbours? I’m a grown ass man and that storm kinda scares me, I can’t imagine how the elderly might feel. 

Do you have pets? If so how are they coping. 

Do you keep a shovel inside the house to enable escape? 

Good luck digging out! Rest of Canada is thinking of ya!"
facepalm,ff6hfk3,t1_ff6fee0,1579627270.0,Looks like they make inner covers for them.  I mean it might suck for the purists but it gives life to a book that would remain on a shelf unread because it’s unwieldy.

While technically this is true, and she is on our money. Day to day she has no effect on Canada, other than we appoint a Governor General to act on her behalf, but the position is really just symbolic."

nottheonion,ff5tobo,t1_ff5ausg,1579609840.0,I never thought of it that way. Sometimes I think it’s super Canadian to point out our canadian flaws or problems thinking bother don’t have those same issues.

Filmmakers,fcufmcb,t3_eizmhy,1577979793.0,"At 15, I can truly say you might feel lost, but you have so much time ahead of you to figure it out. Don’t stress about what you “should do”, just “try to do”  and you will figure it out. There is no static plan to succeed, but just try and fail as much as possible and learn from those failures."
