You need to compare her courage to yours?  So when she stops hanging out with you, and spends time with people who are proud of her and encourage her, you'll think she dumped you because you're fat... right?"

Weight loss doesn't need to be THAT painful, and even if she ate only 300-500 calories a day, I guarantee it wasn't for a month.

osteoporosis,fdya31a,t1_fdwb0k5,1578777645.0,"I understand the stress! I was really worried about taking these drugs. I haven't had any heartburn or reflux. No diarrhea, or bowel changes at all. I've heard some people have back pain and feel feverish - I didn't experience that at all. I follow the directions exactly (staying upright, taking with water on an empty stomach.) I wait the full hour before having coffee,  which is the hardest part for me. I took my dose today :)  

I don't mean to pry, and don't feel obligated to answer, but are you recently post-menopause?  I went thru menopause fairly early, and I don't know how that impacts onset of osteoporosis. I asked for the bone scan because I had gotten shorter. To my knowledge, no one else in my family has had osteoporosis."
osteoporosis,fdw6ho3,t3_en6gnl,1578755542.0,"I am taking Boniva. It has only been a few months but I haven't had any negative side effects. I resisted for two years because of the potential side effects, and during that time walked four miles a day, took Vitamin D, calcium and avoided inflammatory foods.  I'm relatively young for osteoporosis  (63) and was somewhat active before, so I didn't think I had the risk of falling an elderly person might have. However, my next DEXA scan indicated that the osteoporosis in my spine had gotten worse. (-3.3)

My doctor wanted me to take Fosamax. Since my hips aren't a problem (some osteopenia) I  agreed to take Boniva. He said it might relieve some of my back/neck pain and it did! It's one pill a month, so not terribly inconvenient.  

Time will tell whether it's working. I'm very protective of my back (taking care when lifting things and being very careful not to fall) but still garden and walk a lot.   If you live in a cold climate, I highly recommend Yak Trax. They are amazing for traction on snow and ice.

There are some discussion groups for people with osteoporosis (outside of reddit). I saw fewer complaints about Boniva than Fosamax, but that may be just because fewer people take it. Be sure to tell your dentist you're taking it - my cousin had jaw necrosis on Fosamax. Boniva can also cause jaw necrosis so dentists need to know.

Best of luck. I hope it helps you."

RBI,fdirluu,t3_ekqzps,1578449481.0,"This doesn't sound like a typical burglary. Unscrewing all the motion detector lights would have been done ahead of time. Otherwise they would have set them off if you're in the northern hemisphere.  Most of what you described sounds like it was done to look like a robbery, when they were more interested in your filing cabinet, and the two doors behind the smaller cabinets they moved. If they were looking for jewelry/cash, they would have opened and dumped every drawer, not just your panty drawer. As for the blood - I wonder if it's human. You said your dog got hurt. Check for cuts from the broken glass? What does your BF do? Military contractor or tech? As for not taking fingerprints, the police probably knew the guys were wearing gloves or didn't think it was important, since nothing was taken, and no one was hurt."

 Fatlogic's greatest hits accepted without question are going to cause a lot of misery down the road. I wonder how that kool-aid will taste in 10 or 20 years. 

There was a thread in a medical subreddit about hospitals requiring ""obesity sensitivity training"" (anti fat-shaming) but I gathered most believed weight loss is critical for hypertension, heart disease and T2D, but also don't believe weight loss will work unless the person really wants it."

fatlogic,fd3ydw6,t1_fcwxcdd,1578162727.0,"I'm the opposite. I have been skipping breakfast for years because food -any food -makes me really sleepy.

fatlogic,fd3p51u,t3_ejj6oh,1578160496.0,"If I know someone well enough to comment on their weight, I know them well enough to offer support and empathy if they are ill, or enthusiastic encouragement if they are trying to lose weight. I asked a coworker if she had lost weight recently and she was delighted to tell me the details of what she was doing and how much it improved her health (she has relapsing/remitting MS.)  I think most of the objection around complimenting weight loss is sour grapes."
fatlogic,fd3l1fz,t1_fd3i3hu,1578159304.0,I agree so much. Any interruption in the progression toward disease has to be better than not trying to improve health. I also don't buy that yo-yo dieting is more harmful than obesity. Good luck to you!
fatlogic,fd3iyfi,t1_fcz6wbq,1578158771.0,"You make a good point and I'm not sure where she is coming from. Since it's an idiotic comment if she's talking about restrictive eating disorders, I wonder if she is assuming that everyone who's obese has an eating disorder. If you believe this, wouldn't you encourage people to STOP eating fast food and snacks laden with HFCS? The patriarchy and capitalism benefit far more from your addiction to junk food than from mental illness-- they certainly dont want to pay for your health care. I don't know  how the stock market value of ""diet culture"" compares to pharmaceuticals, fast foods and junk foods, but I'll bet you a dozen donuts it's a fraction. I really don't know what her point is."

>Diets don't  work

People who are successful at keeping weight off have accepted that this is a battle worth winning and are willing to change their thinking as well as their eating habits. This is work.

>You'll gain it all back

If you have a progressive disease and stop the intervention,  yes, you will return to a diseased state.

>and then some

The DIET didn't cause you to gain more than where you started. It's where you were headed all along - the diet temporarily stalled the progression. You have a progressive but treatable disease, and willfully stopped the treatment. 

(I'm not talking about people who just need/want to lose a few pounds - and in fact think these are the people HAES and IE might actually work for.)

Happy 2020 everyone.  Keep fighting the good fight and giving people hope. You are inspiring."
