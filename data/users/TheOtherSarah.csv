wholesomememes,ffgd56g,t1_fff58pu,1579903593.0,"There is more variation among humans than you think. Not everyone gets these instincts, not everyone who does gets them to the same degree, and not everyone focuses them the same way. “Maternal” instincts can mean showering love on nephews and nieces, pets, or a cause. 

The human need for socialisation can be easy to fulfil with one’s community and friends, not exclusively a traditional nuclear family, and there have always been people who live full and contented lives permanently single. For one example, many nuns of past centuries joined the order to avoid pressure to marry, and the term “spinster” comes from female weavers who chose a career over a family even in medieval times. 

Being in r/teenagers is relevant because, even if you’re not a teenager yourself, what you’re saying lines up with what many teenagers are told by their parents and grandparents about how the world works. It may be broadly true in the parents’ experience and especially for the grandparents, because women of older generations had less freedom to choose not to marry and have kids, and they also would have fallen out of contact with peers who didn’t have the same goals in life (so, confirmation bias). 

It’s not true for everyone, and you never know who is going to be that slightly unusual person who doesn’t fit the mould. So it comes across as fairly insulting to insist that knowing a rough trend means that you know a stranger better than they know themselves. People will object to it, not because you’re speaking an uncomfortable truth, but because they’ve heard it many times before, and they’re sick of being reduced to a stereotype and told that they have neither individuality nor free will."
