I'm down for the idea that a small child, on the right meds and thoroughly drilled in coping mechanisms, will be a much more ""together"" ADHD adult than most of us are. They might not need meds. They might seem normal. The disorder is still there, they've just internalised incredible coping skills.

Of course that's not the case for everyone. You only have to look at the number of posters talking about how they were put on meds young and it ruined their life to see that."

I certainly don't blame my mum for not realising something was going on. She would often say things like ""I'm exactly like you, I just had two kids so I had to get over it"". And I would say to her, mum, you were *able to have two kids*, you were able to hold down jobs and go out and have friends, you aren't like me.

I think she was probably somewhere on the ADHD/C-PTSD spectrum. I'm autistic as well (also diagnosed in the last couple of years), so I had a huge bundle of disability to unpack that didn't let me relate to anything like a normal life. I wish she was still around to see how well things are going for me now.

I don't even blame doctors, TBH. There was no way I was going to be diagnosed with autism as a kid when Asperger's syndrome wasn't even codified until a year before I left school. I wish the medical establishment had noticed adult ADHD, and ADHD in women, sooner.

I bet lots of those tasks are on the ""annoying if not done, but not time critical"" list. They can be done last. Which means, for your purposes, *they don't exist*. If you have a list, cross them off it.

Can you break your tasks down into tiny steps? Put *one* dish in the dishwasher. Pick up your phone and find your doctor's number.

But mainly, take time out to baby yourself a bit and destress. You are not bad. You are a good person who cares enough to get so upset, and cares enough to make this post. Do your best, but don't punish yourself when your best isn't as high as you'd like or others expect."

I hacked something together that I could record in shorthand, but I was *professionally offended* to be put in a situation where I had almost no option but to *write down my password*."
