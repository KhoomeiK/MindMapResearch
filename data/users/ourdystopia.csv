There certainly **is** a change that happens, but **wanting** that change will forever obscure it. I didn't say there was no change, I said there is no change **you can make.** To notice something is already a certain way is not changing it, it's noticing what is already happening.

What he is saying in this quote, is that people never end up finding it and get stuck in perpetual states of seeking what is being obscured by the search itself (trying to change in some way, thus denying being at peace with what always is).

Some people are already at peace and do go for community. Even the people who are seeking are going for community too, which does provide some peace and love. That's not really what this quote is about, it's about trying to find a salvation that is perceived as 'out there' rather than in you; here and now."

Here is an example. When he talks about douglas harding having no head, what he is saying is so straightforward and easy to understand that a child can undertstand it. But it won't **mean** anything until they glimpse it for themselves. This is most of harris' discussions, it's why he gets a lot of hate, because what he is saying can be understood in language, no doubt, but doesn't carry any weight in meaning or understanding; and the people who are on that same page will continue to subscribe to the podcast for that reason. That is what I meant. Not that people can't understand his lingo or follow him, but they lack the requisite experience or depth for what he is saying to sink in.

In this case the analogies would be that people use horses for travel, horses need food and get tired and only go so fast, so lets figure out a way forward.

A first principle would be that people like going from point A to point B and need momentum to get there, then figure out how to generate momentum.  Now you've broken down the analogous thought into it's basic constituents, you can begin to build it back up. What generates momentum? A few easily come to mind. Rivers, a rolling ball or stone, wind, running, etc...  You can see by doing this we broke free from thinking how to improve horses and now might be able to imagine boats, airplanes and the modern wheel.
