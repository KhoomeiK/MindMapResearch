ComblocMarket,ff8qr19,t1_ff83ql4,1579692196.0,"Laughable that I have never done woodworking before, or just getting into it. A smudge on the finish can be easily wiped off. The reason the dongs look like the finish isn’t complete or stripped off is due to cleaning it and stripping it down to lighter layers then the other areas. The one but stock that looks like the laminate wasn’t completely stripped off, well you’re right on that one but the finish is complete. I was afraid to strip off any more layers for fear of causing a blotchy look that appear some on the dong. I also offer people a money back guarantee if they’re not satisfied and I have redone a set of furniture due to the finish getting messed up during delivery. Check my feedback 


TL:DR
Finish is complete, smudges can be wiped off. I’ve always offered satisfaction Guaranteed or your money back."

Each set is $125, and comes with a Romy Bakelite. The only hardware is on the UHG, dong, and cleaning kit spring.  Striped cleaned then refinished. I left these glossy but 0000 steel wool will give it a more matte finish if you desire.
