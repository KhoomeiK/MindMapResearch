childfree,ffpyvso,t1_ffpwtv2,1580111502.0,"Right? I really want someone at my wedding who thinks of it as “random.” Sounds like a charming guest. I don’t mean you have to get emotional over every wedding you go to but sheesh, have a little respect for the people whose day it is."
childfree,ffpvaea,t3_eugsoa,1580107057.0,"At our wedding we did want kids to be welcome at the reception but I had nightmares about a wailing child ruining the ceremony. We have a lot of friends and family with kids, including a bridesmaid, and we wanted them to come and enjoy themselves. So we had on-site childcare (it was at a hotel so it was very easy to arrange) and the invitation had some politely worded language requesting people make use of the childcare during the ceremony.

We figured anyone who still had a problem wouldn’t be missed. But nobody did. There were some kids in the childcare, and in other cases one parent was at the ceremony while the other watched the kid elsewhere. 

The bride and groom are entitled to the kind of wedding they want, whether partly or entirely childfree. I just don’t understand people who need to make someone else’s wedding all about themselves. We would have been sad if someone was offended by my barring children at the ceremony, but it’s happened SO many times at weddings I’ve been to and it’s not cute in any way. I’m thankful that we had no one give us any grief about it, and we had a perfect ceremony and very fun reception."

Keep in mind she knew I was a nonbeliever, and yet she was saying this to me not realizing at all what an insult it was. 

That’s a lot of cognitive dissonance, to worry about your kids becoming atheists and turn to an atheist you like and respect for advice. (I spoke to her parenting as the important aspect of their upbringing, etc.) Religious conditioning that atheists or nonbelievers are evil, immoral, endangered people can remain even in the face of evidence against it.
