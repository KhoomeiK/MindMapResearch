From the article: 

>The new shelter will have the capacity to serve approximately 275 people each night. This is only about two percent of the estimated 12,500 homeless people in King County, where Seattle is located.

Wouldn't more affordable housing also decrease the growth of the homelessness rate? 

Also from the article:

>After Amazon built its campus in Seattle in 2010, the cityâ€™s rent prices skyrocketed. The cityâ€™s median rent increased by 42 percent between 2007 and 2017 â€” where the average for the U.S. overall was an 18 percent increase. Meanwhile, the rate of homelessness has increased by 9 percent each year since 2014.

Now the article didn't say how much this will cost Amazon. I'm sure it's a lot. But between ""Immediate housing"" (Rental, operating, master leasing and/or capital subsidies for
housing serving homeless with incomes at 0-30% AMI.), Basic shelter, Enhanced shelter, innovative temporary housing, and ""Safety in place"", the head tax would have provided ~$10,952,000 which would have provided the follwing:

* 289 immediate housing units
* 70 basic shelter beds
* 180 beds (+50 beds in year 2)
* 2 encampments with
tiny houses, Buddy
Shelters, or shelter
tents, for 54.

...and more.

That adds up to something like 600 people off the streets in year 1. 

That's not counting the 591 units of ""Rental Housing
Production to Assist
Homeless Households"" that would not only serve the 30% - 60% range, but also the 0% - 30% range.

All those numbers are from the link you provided BTW.
