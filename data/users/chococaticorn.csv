This one is a SARS-like coronavirus. SARS is covered on that page. This is the equivalent to the H1N1 flu outbreak- it was still influenza but a new mutation. H1N1 was still a flu; ergo, the information about influenza could be generalized to H1N1 flu. Same can be said here. Information about coronaviruses in general can be applied to this mutation because it is still relevant to that class of viruses."
