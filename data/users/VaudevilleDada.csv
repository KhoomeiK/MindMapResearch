gifs,feozah2,t1_feorm0t,1579308639.0,"There's a great bit in the making-of footage of *The Phantom Menace* where McGregor is doing a stunt against a blue screen. He is called to do a jump from a platform while lightsaber fighting and do a fall from a platform. He does the stunt and lands on a pad right in front of the cameraman shooting the behind-the-scenes footage. Ewan looks at the crew guy next to him, grins, and says, "" 'Do you want to do a Star Wars,' they said. I said, ' Too fucking right!'""

EDITED for accuracy."

todayilearned,fen9aen,t1_fen6hqs,1579279764.0,"There's a notorious Batman comic book that was a sort of grim-and-gritty new take on the character that had swearing indicated by black bars. At the writer's insistence, the swears were printed as scripted underneath the black bars. However, two different kinds of black ink were used for the letters and the bars, meaning in the right light a reader could easily make out the words. And that's how the word ""cunt"" was published in a Batman comic book.

The issue was promptly recalled and reprinted. (It was *All-Star Batman and Robin* \#10, if anyone's interested. I didn't care for it)."

movies,fd39pi4,t1_fd2i7lw,1578156092.0,"Kind of? For legal reasons, Arnold isn't playing Conan in Red Sonja... but, you know: it's Conan. Per a user summary at [StackExchange](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/49415/was-kalidor-explicitly-intended-to-be-conan):

""Arnie was [tied into a multi-picture deal](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091828/trivia) with Dino de Laurentis and that Dino's strong desire was to create **another Conan feature** given the financial success of the [two previous films](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conan_the_Barbarian#Films). He'd even gone as far as pre-announcing that the next film would be based on the book ""Conan the Conqueror"".

Dino de Laurentis unfortunately faced two major obstacles, both of which related to his budget;

1. The character rights for the Conan character were held by Universal and de Laurentis was evidently unable to secure them at a reasonable price.
2. Arnold's bargain-basement salary deal meant that he couldn't be forced to work a full shooting schedule

Rather than simply abandon the whole project, de Laurentis had what must have seemed a master stroke. He managed to secure the rights to a less well known (and much cheaper) *comic-book* property called Red Sonja. Sonja was still set in the [Hyborian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyborian_Age) universe which saved him from having to rethink the screenplay and he wouldn't need Arnie to work full time since he would effectively become the *co-star* of a Sonja film rather than the *star* of a Conan film. As an added bonus, his writers could simply rehash some existing Conan + Sonja books into the screenplay without having to worry about the rights issues."""
movies,fd37l9o,t1_fd2njk7,1578155487.0,"Yes, exactly. There'd be a lot less putting actors up on pedestals if more people realized that for the VAST majority of actors, even ones who have played characters they know and love, theirs is a ""freelance"" business and they just want to make sure they're working; quality would be great, of course, but just having the job is paramount for them. Very few have the luxury of picking and choosing roles. It's not like, say, Jon Cryer doesn't *know* that ""Two and a Half Men"" was trash, but he ALSO knows he didn't have to look for work for a decade and at the end of it he would have a pile of fuck-you money and just kind of do what he wants. That's pretty rare for a ""working actor."" Awards, ""iconic"" portrayals, etc. are nice, but ultimately they're just trying to make a living."
