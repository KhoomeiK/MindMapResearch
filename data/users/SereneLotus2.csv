At first, I slept in one hour ‚Äúchunks‚Äù, waking up sweaty and anxious and some nights, not falling back asleep at all. Here is what worked for me:
If melatonin doesn‚Äôt give you nightmares, it can really help with sleep. Amazon sells Good Day (?) Chocolate...they are melatonin m and m‚Äôs, 8 to a small box. I had to take all 8 and they are not cheap but you will sleep. 
Less expensive solutions: a hot bath or shower immediately before bed. Use Epsom salts in the bath water as this will replenish your muscles and relax the body. I Also found drinking Calm Magnesium powder during the day (one and one half teaspoons is a 17oz bottle of water is perfect to help me sleep at night. 
I have tried lots of CBD products. The best for me is Zillis berry flavor (one dropper under the tongue just before bed, and one dropper at the inevitable 3am wake up. Stanley Brothers Charlottes Web CBD is also very good, get the mint chocolate flavor. 
Listen to something soothing. I fiend Harry Henshaw Fantasia (on YouTube) to relax me. Or listen to a boring audio book or rain/nature sounds, Anything to distract the racing mind. 
Come on here and keep asking for help. People here care...and remember, everything you are feeling is TEMPORARY!!! Remind yourself ‚Äúthis too shall pass‚Äù because it will. And you will feel and BE sooo much better!!!!üôè"
stopdrinking,fd2graz,t3_ejwt8u,1578146988.0,"I have not read this book but I have read many Books specific to drinking, craving and addictions. I offer you these thoughts which I hope will help you during this week and beyond. 
First, because this book resonates with you, see if your local library has it. It‚Äôs free there and this is where I would go during the first few months after I stopped drinking. I needed a place to go that was quiet and far away from the places I drank. The library has so many good books, videos, magazines (lots of good ‚Äúquit lit‚Äù)and it became my safe space. 
Next, in the beginning the cravings come from the body, which is literally craving the sugar alcohol once provided, and from the brain...again, the sugar addiction and the psychological addiction. Not forever but for now, have sweet treats available. I carried hard candy around with me but any sugar will help. Indulge your sweet tooth, for now, you don‚Äôt need to be fighting this craving. 
I also found that having/ finding an alcohol free drink that I enjoyed was helpful, just having the rocks glass or a bottle in my hand was comforting to my brain, and surprisingly the contents were not that important after a while. Staying hydrated with water is also super important for your body and brain especially in the first weeks. 
The cravings dissipated for me when I was active. Go for a walk, go to the gym, clean a closet...Move. The more I sat, the more the cravings would creep up on me. I found that when they did it was best for me to acknowledge them, tell them ‚ÄúI see you, but I‚Äôm not drinking‚Äù and then DO something...and they would back off!
Smell/scent  also can reduce cravings. I got an inexpensive $10 diffuser from Walmart and some lavender and lemon grass essential oils. My house smelled great and the scents somehow distract my brain. 
I hope this helps you. Your body and brain will stop craving alcohol in time and these suggestions are the things that got me through the time. All the best."
