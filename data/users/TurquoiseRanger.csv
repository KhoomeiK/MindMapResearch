AskReddit,ff51rev,t3_erhu3x,1579577886.0,"Interesting fact. I can actually go back to sleep and pick up where I left off. One summer in HS, I had a series of dreams that were the same story centered. 

I also dream about things and they come to fruition and I experience deja vu at future unknown random times, whether it be a month or years."

tifu,ff4xa80,t3_er7i1t,1579574660.0,"Pretty please, put your TL;DR at the end of the story. The  people who want that know where to look. Those who were interested in the full story just had the mystery/story behind the title ruined.

Regardless, that was quite hilarious. I would have loved to see her dead pan facial expression when she said it lol"

My parents quit after over 30 yrs each and are like a week shy of year! You can do it!!!

There are apps that give you a daily reminder of what is happening with your body, money you're saving, and encouragement for the process. Maybe look into it?"

AskReddit,fd5ok3e,t1_fd2ik7k,1578179709.0,I moved from Chicago to the L.A. area in 2010 (I was 22). I miss home and those good weather days in the bleak streaks and the foood. But I dont think I can ever move back. I dont miss the violence and the idea of not having a beach at my immediate reach now is a hard pill to swallow.
