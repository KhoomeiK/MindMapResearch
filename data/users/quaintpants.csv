AskReddit,fglv1v8,t1_fgl1h8c,1580911619.0,"i’ve been doing some reading and it does seem to be true. this is an old (1984) article from The Atlantic which goes into it in detail:

https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1984/02/freud-and-the-seduction-theory/376313/

It seems that freud bowed to the pressure of the prevailing wisdom of the time which was that incidences of childhood sexual abuse and incest were few and far between. It seems like a mixture of outright psychological denial and a wish to retain his good reputation was to blame for his reversal. It looks like the effects of that one decision have reverberated down through the time even up to the present, where the reality of these things is still denied because people would rather not have to deal with the unpleasant facts. The recently disbanded False Memory Syndrome Foundation was one organisation that kept the facts hidden."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fglj5ws,t1_fgka3gd,1580900433.0,"it’s mystifying to me why you were downvoted. thank you for continuing to speak your truth, it seems we all need to hear it."
AskReddit,fgkal1j,t1_fgk2fs6,1580861115.0,i read something about how he first wrote about it as being that a lot of kids are sexually abused by their parents (i think he called it the seduction theory) and then later reversed it to being that people just innately want to have sex with their parents.  i think he even said originally that his own father was a pervert - a sexual predator. so some people think he was abused by his dad and that’s where his neurosis came from.

ContraPoints,fgi3q17,t3_eyctww,1580804083.0,"There was a huge thread recently about the how beneficial the HPV vaccine  was and the comments were full of the usual “antivaxxers are morons” stuff. I listened to an interview recently with the authors of a book called “The HPV Vaccine on Trial”. They set out a very detailed case for why it shouldn’t be mass administered to everybody.  The book was even endorsed by a Nobel prize winner. 

To me it’s another area where a more nuanced discussion is warranted instead of people just picking a side and shouting about how right they are and how dumb everyone else is.

edit: just to add, i’m not an “anti-vaxxer”.  i have a 2 year old who has had all her vaccinations. nor do i think vaccines cause autism."
ChoosingBeggars,fgh0hdm,t1_fggyleh,1580773771.0,Who decided that was the system? I don’t know of any country outside the US where waiters rely on tips to live. In most countries employers have to pay their staff a minimum wage which allows them to live. The US tipping culture arose from workers having terrible rights compared to other western countries.
