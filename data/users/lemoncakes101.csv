Crushes,fefbezf,t3_eov88r,1579052617.0,"Yes, heh. not all the time tho"
Crushes,fefb5va,t3_eov8al,1579052453.0,"yes. and i fucked up from my anxiety. 
despite the many opportunities before and after that, this one was still very cute and memorable  tho. long story short me and a few other ppl had been called down during 1st period to go see our Spanish virtual school teacher (she came to the school to check on how we’re doing in the online class) and at some point she called me and my crush to say we both didn’t do this assignment and she told us how to do it (my crush being right beside me) n the example she gave us was calling us guapo and guapa... and shitt i was so happy this was happening but at that moment my anxiety just got really really bad and when she told us to partner up i just didn’t (and I KNOW it was the perfecttt opportunity to talk to him 1-on-1). 
me and my crush don’t talk, but still. cute moment"
Crushes,fefa82y,t3_eov5o9,1579051831.0,can’t she see u look at her back
