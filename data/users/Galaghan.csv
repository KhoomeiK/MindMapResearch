It never hurts to prevent it by rolling someone on his side, because yeah swallowing your tongue is definitely possible. 

Just don't put your fingers in anyone's mouth, they will snap off like a carrot if the teeth go to town."

youseeingthisshit,ff9bn8b,t3_ese2s4,1579709274.0,"People just don't seem to get what this sub is about anymore... I showed it to my cat and that is the face she made.

Seriously, +90% of posts here are just r/whoadude or whatever sub material. There's just not a single reaction in the posts, let alone the one we're here for.

Mods, please get more active in removing posts. The bot isn't cutting it anymore and the sticky from a year ago just gets ignored. 

I volunteer to police the sub. But please do something because this sub is going to shit fast this way. It feels like it's the new r/wtf. And it's not just some days, it's a constant stream of shitposts.

P.s. Yeah I know this isn't 'fit for the sub' either, but it had to be said."
youseeingthisshit,ff9973w,t1_ff96dsr,1579707735.0,I think people simply don't know what is or isn't fit for the sub anymore..

youseeingthisshit,ff3k24e,t1_ff3gska,1579542713.0,I think you're reading into it a bit much.
youseeingthisshit,ff3jyye,t1_ff379u5,1579542659.0,Yet there's no such reaction to be seen in the video. What the hell is it doing in this sub then?

Sure this looks cool, but that's about it."
