bipolar,ff8kpun,t3_es7hxh,1579683156.0,"Personally, I love seeing these types of posts especially when they come from this sub. I’ve started painting again a lot more ever since I joined this sub. It’s my favorite support sub by far and it’s because I see so much positivity in it."
DAE,feunadb,t3_eqmp5n,1579388177.0,"The more emotionally intimate I become, the more sex repulsed I get. It’s depressing that I find sex difficult with the one I love most."
unpopularopinion,fetkweq,t3_eqh2c2,1579376403.0,"Something was off about me early on. I wasn’t a problem child, but I was in the counselors office on a weekly basis up until 2nd grade. Someone, maybe one of my teachers noticed something was up. I first cut myself at 10 and my parents punished me for begging for attention. Even if it’s for attention, a child calls out for the needed attention they’re being denied. 

I’ve been depressed for as long as I can remember. Around freshman year I got the idea that I was maybe bipolar. I begged to see a psychologist which I only saw twice, once after almost jumping off the second floor. Mid twenties now and after receiving health insurance for the first time in years my suspicions were confirmed. Psychiatrist believes I’ve been bipolar for years, maybe most of my life."

rant,fes2pvz,t1_fes10y4,1579360812.0,"I “dated” an almost 30 year old at 18. Looking back, idgaf if I was legal. What do we have in common? I had just graduated high school. That’s fucking weird. Date women your age."
rant,fes1qpm,t1_ferzyod,1579360553.0,"Your brain is fully developed by 25. Not saying you’re not an adult until then, but like you said; three years is a world of a difference. If you can’t drink till you’re 21, you shouldn’t be able to enlist until then. 

I wasn’t all that wild when I was 18, but even then I was making some childish decisions much like everyone at eighTEEN."

rant,ferxrzg,t1_fersvw6,1579359385.0,What does this have to do with anything. Since when is the left the pedophile party??
rant,ferx78p,t1_feru47t,1579359276.0,"The scariest part is most pedophiles never molest. As someone who was molested by a pedophile, I personally believe there’s something psychologically wrong like any other disorder. 

Like a psychopath, not every psychopath is a murderer, but there is something pathologically wrong. As much as a resent my molester (I’d love to find out he was beaten to death), I pity the “benign” ones. I’d imagine those with self awareness hate themselves. 

It’s uncomfortable to humanize, but it’s the only way to better understand and possibly fix because they can’t just go away. If they are born this way, maybe we can find markers to prevent or even remove.

But, I agree that acting pedophiles deserve heavy punishment. Too often do I wonder how different my life would be without my childhood trauma"
rant,fervmsy,t1_feqz4ky,1579358816.0,"Romeo and Juliet Law, if I remember correctly it’s okay with parental consent for a minor to marry as long as the difference in under four years. Could be worse, but still fucked.

Personally I hardly regard any 18 as an adult, but that’s just my opinion."

bipolar,fdznmar,t3_encbw8,1578792059.0,"I’d like to just add on to say that with the severe nicotine addictions going on with teens today, I’m speculating a generation of bipolar and other mood disorders.

Early nicotine use can contribute to a mood disorder."
bipolar,fdzmwdy,t1_fdyd467,1578791865.0,"I used to joke about being bipolar because I genuinely believed it was a real possibility. Years later here I am with a diagnosis. I kind of just always knew that it wasn’t just “puberty”. I’m 24 now and was diagnosed mid to late last year.

Two of my friends whom used to joke about it loosely were also diagnosed recently as BP2. Makes me think that birds of a feather really do flock together."
TrueOffMyChest,fdk24rf,t3_elmop8,1578494184.0,"Sure, we cope with comedy, but I’d go as far as to say that most of the jokes are coming from people who don’t fully grasp the severity of the situation. You have to grasp it to come to cope with it.

Everyone I know joking about it is genuinely laughing their asses off. I’ve been annoyed for days, I had to unfollow a bunch of people. I posted about this yesterday and all I was met with was *okay boomer*. Because everything is a fucking meme and a joke."

bipolar,fdia4ps,t3_eliwql,1578438486.0,"Bipolar 2 and ADHD on adderall. It has changed my life entirely. I don’t get high off of it at all and definitely hasn’t triggered any mania for me. Sure, maybe the first two days of being on it I felt a little hypomanic because it was new to my system, but I’ve been on it for 5 months now? It’s been a life saver, for real. I’d fall asleep  left and right without it."
