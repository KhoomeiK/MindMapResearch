ModestMouse,ff4tgl5,t3_erg5n3,1579572041.0,favorite part is at the very end of this song you can hear isaac (the backing/more distorted vocal track) say â€˜i fucked up the last lineâ€™

cats,feoi8kq,t1_feoc0ol,1579300481.0,"I had an informal version of this in undergrad. Off-campus apartment with a cat that lived there for like 8-10 years and had 3-4 sets of humans living with/taking care of him over time. He was super social and always happy, didnâ€™t seem to mind the changing of the guard every now and again!"

WeAreTheMusicMakers,fcssekt,t3_eioyaj,1577923924.0,there are also some settings in â€˜socialâ€™ that allow you to have a private session or restrict certain info from appearing on your profile. Bit of a hassle to do every time but itâ€™s an option..
ActionFigures,fcrg9jo,t1_fcresxx,1577901427.0,Itâ€™s SHFâ€”I think itâ€™s just called dark knight Joker. Awesome figure and usually goes for only like $40!
suggestmeabook,fcgoq4q,t3_eh8uhy,1577642405.0,are you new to the genre? I read the Enderâ€™s Game series as a kid and have been into sci-fi ever since.

DeathStranding,fcbdlp1,t1_fcbcqj1,1577585566.0,Awesome. I actually just picked up a copy on sale and itâ€™s next on my list after finishing DS!
DeathStranding,fcbdf1w,t1_fcb59yy,1577585503.0,thanks :)
DeathStranding,fcaj3a9,t3_egwtwz,1577570135.0,"I think materials are unique to each locationâ€”so anything you earn/recycle/store at a given terminal can only be accessed from that same terminal. Recycling is a helpful way to boost your numbers as youâ€™ll need more over time to build structures, fabricate items, rebuild roads etc!"
photographs,fcacp5x,t3_egw5ge,1577566866.0,Had the opportunity to visit Cambodia and see some beautiful landscapes and people. Shot with a Nikon D3200.
PS4,fc6rkk0,t1_fc5njzs,1577487676.0,"Agreedâ€”I loved this game. Your choices really impact the story arc of each character and some levels have tons of unique branches/paths to explore. 

Not quite as story-driven, but Portal 1+2 have some awesome puzzles and force you to think differently than most other games in terms of physics/mechanics."
PS4,fc6qpt3,t1_fc5qv62,1577487068.0,"left behind is great. I find myself playing last of us 1-2x every year, itâ€™s too good to not revisit. If youâ€™re doing another play through I recommend pausing the main campaign and booting up LB right after Joelâ€™s injury, gives an awesome and more â€˜linearâ€™ experience."
DeathStranding,fc5uvl0,t1_fc3oui8,1577466422.0,"Finding a generator, ladder, etc. when you really need it is when the strand system is at its best IMO. As soon as I connect a new region to the network 20 bridges will appear and there isnâ€™t much reason to build new ones/it feels like Iâ€™m late to the party.. but stumbling across the smaller stuff in more remote areas is invaluable."
