Pacybits,ff8s66n,t1_ff8s4za,1579693989.0,I’m in a game rn and I’m destroying the ai. Thanks!
Pacybits,ff8s2yf,t1_ff8s1zj,1579693881.0,Ohhh so that’s why it’s easier to win with worse teams
Pacybits,ff8rzur,t1_ff8rx2r,1579693778.0,Ohhh I see. But why is it better to use a silver team over a high rated team? Like silver teams’ stats aren’t better than say a 192 team right?
Pacybits,ff8ri5s,t3_es9a3m,1579693171.0,Can someone explain?
FIFA,ff33vtg,t3_eredb9,1579533016.0," Unfortunately there’s no flair for satire.

[iPhone 7]

My iPhone 7 32gb was having extremely bad battery life (already down to 90% right now and it’s first thing in the morning) so I did a reset all settings and decided to clear up my storage from the 31.7 I had used down to 30.

This was last night and this morning when I woke up I had the “storage full” notification and I had 31.9 used. I saw I had a new file called iCloud Drive that I can’t delete and it takes up 700, but i don’t know what exactly happened?

Also, my messages say they take up 500 mb but in iCloud Drive they take up 2.5 gb?!"
