MadeMeSmile,fe6ediu,t1_fe5tnim,1578888421.0,"She's a researcher at the University of Houston famous for her two TED talks, Power of Vulnerability and Listening to Shame. She studies shame and vulnerability and their impact on our lives. She's written several books, most recently Dare to Lead, but also Gifts of Imperfection, Daring Greatly, Braving the Wilderness, and Rising Strong. Highly highly recommend her work"
samsunggalaxy,fdlwd5b,t1_fdloq0c,1578534086.0,"no real  solutions but I have similar issues, same model but without that severe of a lag - I found [this website](https://androidcure.com/speed-up-samsung-galaxy-s7-edge/), seems to have helped me quite a bit, maybe it can help you too? (If you've got an AdBlocker like me, just hit continue without unblocking). I followed steps 1, 3-5, and 8, might go back and try more steps if I run into issues.

For me it was also an overheating issue, I find mine speeds up when I take it out of the case.

Hope some of this helps!"

techtheatre,fcp2hbn,t1_fcotlz4,1577848446.0,"Oh!! Haha I really like the updated ones! Except the last one, not as much a fan. I like how the pins are underneath the information especially, and what you did with the opacity of the square. Have you considered changing the scissors in the top one to crossed pins?"
techtheatre,fcopjjf,t3_eia41h,1577838160.0,"I like the top one, not so much the bottom one because the white against the pink is a bit jarring. Is your last name Flagkind like your username? It almost reads Flagleind with that font at a super quick glance, but I also think that style fits your branding - maybe explore a similar font that is still as on brand?

I might also add a space/differentiate ""wig designer & stylist"" from the contact information, highlight it in some way - maybe make it the same font as contact info but larger and closer to your name? That way when someone picks it up, first thing they notice is your name and game. I'm a stage manager, and my cards/resume/website/etc all say my name (at like 20pt font) with Stage Manager right below in the same font at like 16pt, with contact info at like 12pt spaced below"

Theatre,fbmxqjx,t1_fbmxahe,1576990146.0,"Apologies for being unclear - if it's a performance performed for the public, correct the same issues apply. Correct if I'm wrong though, but Fair Use does apply to say, directing class projects that are strictly for class use, where no profit is being made and it's not being performed for the public, but rather for the class itself as an educational tool. Am I misunderstanding that?"
