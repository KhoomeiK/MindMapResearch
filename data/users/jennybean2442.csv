college,ffqo6n3,t3_euhgnq,1580139712.0,"Group projects suck.  But when everyone has an interest in the subject, it makes it so much better. I had a group project last semester in a comp course. We chose our own groups based on majors and interests. Once in groups, we chose our topic. That was the most effective group I've been in. It felt most realistic to what I would be dealing with in my field. The weak link was the one who didn't give a flying flafoodle about his major. He even waited until 20 minutes before a major due date to tell us he didn't understand what he was supposed to do for his portion. That was infuriating when he had weeks to tell us or the professor.  So I totally feel ya. 
But in the end, we did well on the project. Take every group project and try to learn from it. How will it help you in your field and in future projects? What can you learn from your group mates? How can I better deal with problems and weak links in the future?"
college,ffqedfj,t1_ffq7sv3,1580132064.0,Yes! I was pursuing teaching the first 2 years. I hated it. I switched to English to get a career in what I love. Now I'm much happier for it and even look forward to going back to school during the weekends.
college,ffqe741,t3_eugbaq,1580131907.0,"I fell into a depression when I was at community  college. I even failed a class and came really close to failing a couple. It was a tough transition. Plus I struggled with balancing with everything going on in my life. I was feeling suicidal and my mom found out and put me in therapy. Best thing shes ever done for me. Therapy changed my life. Because of it, I decided to take a year off between community college and university.  In that time, I learned coping skills, learned what I wanted to do with my life, and figured out who I was. 
If you can, I recommend therapy. At the very least, look into mental health services. Most colleges have counselors. You're going through major life changes. Your feelings are valid. Just know, you're not alone. Many others are struggling as well. They just may not show it."
TwoXChromosomes,ffperxo,t3_eu829x,1580093239.0,"Girl, I feel ya. I usually do the laundry. And one day, I had a shit done of homework to do when I got home from an 8 hour shift. Meanwhile he had the day off and was telling me how bored he was at his sister's, where he goes every day. So I told him he could go home and fold clothes and put them away. His excuse as to why he didnt? He doesn't know where they go. He could have at least folded them and I would show him where they go when I got home. He played dumb. Still pisses me off"

For real, you sound exactly like me. I'm a 23 year old girl who couldn't flirt with a girl to save her life. Plus I would be way too shy and anxious. I dont have many girl friends either and i struggle to make them. But I need female friends. Particularly LGBTQ ones who can understand the struggles"

I'm so sorry for your loss. You lost a parent, which is hard. No woman will ever replace your mom. She needs to respect you and know her place in your life. The fact that she told you to ""get over it"" is absolutely disgusting."
