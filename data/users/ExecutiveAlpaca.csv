ottawa,ffc4dh6,t1_ffc3anf,1579791236.0,"> Okay, so here you basically admit that sex isn't binary if they can be mixed. If they were binary, by definition they could not be mixed as they would be an either or state. Ergo if they can be mixed they are not binary states.

If you google 'non binary definition', you will see that the first definition is as follows:

""not relating to, composed of, or involving just two things""

And by definition, I have used this perfectly with my analogy. It also means that I was correct and that non binary does not exist in humans.

Now, whether you didn't know the definition or are just emotional is not for me to decide. That is the definition of the word, and I advise you to learn it well.

> In detail. I'll link it again for posterity

People who link videos that are hours long to 'make a point' clearly don't have a point.

If you want me to take your video seriously, link me to specific time stamps.

> Here, have a primary source for the sake of it.

Again, you are clearly posting a lengthy article that you likely never read or understand. If you did, you would quote directly.

In fact, just by reading the introduction:

> These studies are sparse and their results are sometimes inconsistent. Some studies have reported no obvious biological incongruities, such as sexual chromosome aberrations, in transgender individuals21); some other studies have suggested a possible association between genetic factors and only one type of the transsexulaism, for example a higher risk for MtF transsexulism among non-twin siblings18) or the assumption of prenatal testosterone exposure for MtF transsexulism

And here as well:

> In relation to the etiology of GD, we should consider other potential mental problems and environmental factors

You can tell beyond a reasonable doubt that the studies conducted around this are extremely inconclusive and likely not based at all in science or biology.

In fact, here is a video from Steven Crowder, and putting your judging of his character aside (which is what the entire LGBTQ movement is about, right?), note the second person he talks to:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUrBKFG9Ilw

She actually says a lot of the stuff you are saying, and watch how badly she gets trampled in the debate.

Now, maybe you are smarter than her and know something she doesn't, but from watching the video and reading your comments it does not seem so.

This entire classification of 'brain types' in regards to transgender is so overwhelmingly stupid (in my opinion), and that is why there is not a single direct link that proves it, as shown in your article that you posted.

Any two people, trans or not, will have differences in deep brain structure. You are not proving anything by comparing the literal cell makeup of trans people to non trans people. Unless they have glaring differences (which they do not), then they are most likely either sick or making the choice themselves.

Furthermore, biology not only accepts only two genders, but in fact, in the cases of intersex people, science also states that these intersex people are rarely in the middle of the spectrum and usually overwhelmingly lean to one gender or the other, which is why the decision to cut some parts out is usually made on the spot.

I'll be waiting for your specific quotes and time stamps if you want to continue this."
ottawa,ffc19fi,t1_ffbzwq3,1579788977.0,"Alright. Just to be clear, I was talking about trans people then.

> variation of non-binary

You are talking about me using personal attacks. And you wonder why. Do you know how hard it is to take you seriously when you use terms like this? Whether terms like this are 'acceptable' or not, these are useless and empty terms, and I hope you know that.

There will always only be two sexes. You are either male or you are female. If only two flavors of ice cream existed (chocolate and vanilla for the sake of this example), mixing them together does not create a third undiscovered flavor. It just creates a blend of the two. Intersex people are mutated, but they are just a combination of male and female. That's it.

Using any other terms that you 'identify' as is your right, but unless you have a physical or mental illness that makes you identify as the other gender, then you are just an idiot making up terminology that was made to calm emotionally unstable people down in the first place.

> who also exist and are accepted by medicine and psychology.

Pyschology, sure. Psycology accepts any abnormality known to man pretty much.

Medicine? Don't make me laugh. Transitional and hormonal medicine has always been around. But to make it sound like medicine, or science by extension, takes these absurd denominations of binary and gender classifications seriously is a bit stupid.

Biology only accepts that there are male and females when it comes to humans. If you want to be silly and make your own biology, go for it."
ottawa,ffbpp8y,t1_ffbpiiq,1579777517.0,It was sarcasm. As denoted by the rest of my paragraph. You can't not feel dysphoria unless you were hardwired to think in a specific way or receive treatment.
ottawa,ffbpnsb,t1_ffbpf8i,1579777458.0,"> in Samoa, the fa'afafine, a group of feminine males

So you're telling if I was raised in a crackhouse and my dad violently murdered people with his own hands every night in front of me, I would grow up to have no problem using violence?

Ofcourse if you were raised in a group of people who are literally RAISING you to be feminine as a male you would not experience dysphoria.

This neither correlates societal expectations with it nor addresses what would happen if, for example, the males who were raising them were NOT feminine.

This is not the same as accepting them. We are talking about a group of males who are extremely feminine. Since children are shaped, in part, by the environment they are raised in, it makes sense that they don't experience the dysphoria. Because the decision has already been indirectly done for them.

If you were intersex and raised by two extremely feminine gay men (or two very masculine lesbian women) you would likely feel much less dysphoria, regardless of what society expects of you. It's because your environment wired you to ease into the role."
ottawa,ffbpea9,t1_ffbpacm,1579777077.0,"Really? You think if you were born with a dick and felt inside you were a girl, and you knew that girls had different genitalia (which isn't expectations, just basic science), you WOULD NOT in any way feel traumatized?

I really can't jump on that thought process. The dysphoria would come from feeling like you an alien inside a foreign body. 

Now, bear in mind I can see society making the dysphoria worse, no doubt. But the dysphoria will start when you realize you are not what you are. Doesn't matter if you decide it or someone else decides it."
ottawa,ffbojfs,t1_ffbofzo,1579775814.0,"Yes, but what that paragraph is saying is that people who already HAVE gender dysphoria will encounter distress and other problems because of the inner conflict. 

How does that translate into societal expectations causing gender dysphoria??

I'm pretty confused as to where you drew that connection. That paragraph does not talk in any way about what causes gender dysphoria, rather it is talking about people with the disorder already."
ottawa,ffbobkw,t1_ffbnpwb,1579775490.0,"Nowhere in the link you posted does anything even come close to supporting your theory that gender dysphoria is caused by societal expectations. If I missed something, feel free to quote directly instead of posting entire pages you probably never read.

Also, here is a quote from your link:

> Gender dysphoria is not the same as gender nonconformity, which refers to behaviors not matching the gender norms or stereotypes of the gender assigned at birth.

Maybe you're confusing the two. Maybe you're just a dumbass. I don't know.

Either way, understand that a child growing up FEELING like another gender would cause trauma, and that would then cause gender dysphoria. This can happen with or without expectations from society. Hell, it could happen in an isolated room.

So treating people is the way to go. Not accepting sickness as the norm."

Imagine being so stupid that you're comparing a hormonal deficiency disease to gender identification.

> Gender in society is mostly defined as phenotype (aka, what do your genitals look like) until you're old enough to say what your gender expression is

And in 99% of cases, this is more than enough to determine sex. 

The other 1% isn't for you to 'say', because you are sick with disease (either mentally or physically, like with your misuse of CAH up there), and after treatment you will fall in line with what your genitals look like.

> Most people never have their chromosomes mapped out unless they're experiencing fertility problems

And nor should they. Why would we start doing this useless process when 99% of the human population are male or female as defined by their genitalia??"
