fatlogic,fcthqfr,t1_fct3l44,1577943675.0,"Yeah, I was fine up until the last couple of days. Really felt it yesterday and today.

And yes, constant overeating is physically taxing in more ways than one. I can't believe I wasted so much of my energy until a couple of years ago on it."
fatlogic,fcsjd70,t1_fcsgeqt,1577917726.0,"I got lucky and found out I could OMAD based on a 1200 calorie plate of bacon, eggs, and...I think tuna, but it might've been some other meat, I can't remember.

Anyway, I wasn't hungry at all for the rest of the day, so I kept doing that, with various meat/cheese combos. I can keep hunger at bay for awhile with this tactic.

I eat other stuff, because I love carbs. But I get to determine desserts by taste and calories without feeling a strong desire in any one direction. It makes me more deliberate in what I choose for desserts."
fatlogic,fcsiqns,t3_eioike,1577917275.0,"I did the ""eat eat eat"" thing over the last week or so because holidays and debauchery.

I'm tired of eating at this point. I'm still not sure if I'm gonna eat today, as I haven't really felt hungry.

My body has had [*too much energy*](https://youtu.be/qRuNxHqwazs), and I've felt my subsequent weight gain in ways that have motivated me to get back to good _ASAP_.

I think it's good to be reminded of how unpleasant the whole thing is when I eat for taste vs satiety/health. The side effects are unpleasant, to say the least.

Moderation, here I come."
fatlogic,fcobqrf,t1_fcoaki8,1577828359.0,"Yeah, you can argue about secondary health effects all day. I'm on that side of Twitter, and it is ridiculous.

Weight loss is much simpler though."
fatlogic,fcnydwe,t1_fcnsb4x,1577820839.0,"There are definitely companies that mislead people regularly, but we all have access to the same internet.

I have seen more ads for junk food (even allegedly ""healthy"" junk food) than I have for weight loss/WW/any kind of diet or program, and I would imagine I'm not alone.

People who want to lose weight don't have to do much research tbh."
fatlogic,fcnlte8,t1_fcnjnob,1577813956.0,"They aren't going keto to lose weight (although they were initially), they're doing it to maintain at this point.

If they went back to eating carbs and didn't track, they'd definitely gain."
fatlogic,fcnj3lj,t1_fcnh21g,1577812680.0,"I learned from Reddit as well, and I made a blog post on calories and macros so I could tell others how it works a couple months ago.

My problem with the above is that the diet industry is significantly smaller than the industries that keep pumping out junk food, yet gets all the blame for obesity. *What?*

It can't possibly be the individual, must be something else, seems to be the theme."

It did require research though."

I've been told the ulcers mean it's working. I am energetic and food hurts, so I'm now a pro at 72 hour fasts. I save so much money from not eating, I can buy more crack for each salad!

Truly, it is the most effective diet."

I can listen to my hunger cues, although I  can eat well past them if I want to.

I get uncomfortable past a certain point, and it kills my desire to overeat for awhile."
