And before you say that those things are derived from capitalism I'll say that I own a mallet I made with my own bare hands. So anything I make and therefore own from that mallet I created does not equal capitalism. Capitalism is the exchange of goods and/or services for money. Ownership is required for that to take place, but not always.

But I've seen and personally experienced enough to know that what they don't know, at least regarding me exercising my rights, won't hurt them. However, what you tell them might hurt you. 

Why? Because they're trained to escalate and they're trained to investigate and they're trained to see you as a threat and anything you say absolutely will be used against you, your rights be damned. So in most circumstances you're better off saying nothing at all rather than telling them you're exercising your right to bear arms. Because as soon as they hear ""I've got a gun"" they automatically think ""THREAT TO MY LIFE!"" And they pull their cocked and loaded pistol and put it in your fucking face. 

We see it happen almost every day in this country. I'm not giving anyone that opportunity to claim they felt threatened by me or by my right to bear arms. Why? Because I know I'm not a threat to them. I know I'll never point my weapon at anything I'm not prepared to kill, and I'm not a cop killer. 

Most police, however, do not operate with such a high standard. Why? Because they're trained to kill first and ask questions later so they can go home to their families, and your family doesn't matter as much as theirs. Yes. They're better than you. They're better than me. That's the mindset in this country, that cops are the absolute most important defenders of peace and you and your rights can go to hell. You're guilty until proven innocent. When you get pulled over in the US you're a suspect that's subject to their every command. So if you want to survive the encounter you'll do exactly what you're told and nothing more, and you'll keep your fucking mouth shut, partner. 

It is what it is. Just ask the guy that got arrested in this case how he survived. I guarantee they pulled their loaded weapons out on him and threatened his life for simply being an American exercising his rights. They'll break down your doors at 4am and shoot you in your own bed in your own home and claim they felt threatened. And they'll shoot your little dog too. Around 1,000 Americans and over 2,000 dogs are shot to death by police every year in this country. Don't give them the opportunity to turn you into a statistic. Because the courts have ruled that you and your family have no recourse if you're killed by police, whether they were right or wrong to kill you. So because they know they will face no punishment, they have no hangups about it anymore. Rant over."

lawncare,ffqyc28,t1_ffpg4sr,1580146391.0,"Mulched bed - Yes, if you have a truck find a landscaping company that provides mulch and go fill your pickup bed. Drive it into the backyard if you can. If you can't, unload your truck into a wheelbarrow using a hard rake or flat shovel and dump the loads every few feet, then spread it out into the bed with a hard rake so that it's a layer of mulch a few inches thick. 

That is a big area and looks like it'll be a couple loads if not 3 or 4. You'll pay by the yard. You can measure out the area to get an idea of how much mulch you'll actually need. I don't recommend pine straw because of the willow. Mulch is easier to clean out willow tree litter with a leaf blower than pine straw. Again, stone will be the easiest to maintain and will be less costly over time as well as giving both a high end look and feel. But you might want to hire that out, because it's more labor intensive. 

Regardless, define your beds prior to adding any kind of cover. If you don't know how to do that, check out some YouTube videos. It's easy to do, but it is time consuming. Still, it's well worth the effort. You can get an idea of how you want your beds to look with a rope or garden hose prior to defining them with the spade. Leave the rope or hose in place as you go around so you don't get off course.

That unique tree on the right in the first pic that appears to be some sort of palm, I'd do the same and turn the entire portion that's in its shadow into a mulched bed. You'll have a path of lawn just big enough to get a mower through. The closest tree in the bottom couple pics appears to be a willow. They're notoriously messy, as you can see in the pic, but it's still worth mulching. For the lawn, it seems to have a lot of bare spots but not a lot of weeds, which is great. So get started on a good fert schedule, a good watering schedule, and stay on top of the weeds. 

It wouldn't hurt to go to your local nursery to pick up some colorful flowering shrubs like hibiscus to help fill in the huge beds between the trees. You can even plant them in big containers so they can be moved wherever and whenever you see fit. Seems like the area probably gets plenty of sun to sustain something like that, but talk to your nursery about your goal. Some kind of sculpture or small water feature or even a bird bath would be cool too, and maybe something decorative on your fence that will make sense to be seen in a gap between the trees. 

If money is not an issue, you might consider going with stone in those beds instead of mulch for a higher end look and less maintenance. You're not far from having a stellar lawn and landscape. Good luck and please post pics of your progress!

It's because Obama was authoritarian. He made that very clear when he told the Republicans to sit down and shut up because he won. Progressives are every bit as authoritarian as conservatives, just in their own ways. It's the same old shit, different day. It's the bedroom under attack under conservatives or the boardroom under attack under liberals. But it's only one party that is so incredibly authoritarian they don't think you should have the right to defend yourself, your family, and your neighbors with firearms. That's the type of authoritarianism that's scary. And it's bold faced in Virginia. If you can't admit that progressives are authoritarian, you're in denial."

bestof,ffhb08g,t3_eteu3p,1579928395.0,">“I heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down and that’s really unfair,” Mr. Trump told Mr. Zelensky, ***in what people familiar with the conversation said was a reference to Mr. Lutsenko.***

Who are *these people*? And just how familiar with the conversation are they? 

This is how misinformation works. It's how fake news spreads. Come up with some assertion, input your own narrative behind the story, and attribute it so vaguely as if the source and the switcheroo of information doesn't matter. But it does matter. Because **it's just as likely Trump was talking about Victor Shokin.** 

And if he was talking about Shokin, which is most likely the case considering that's the very prosecutor Biden got shit canned and considering Trump was talking about Biden's corruption of threatening to withhold funds unless the prosecutor looking into his son was fired, this entire narrative is blown out of the water.

>“***A lot of people are talking about that, the way they shut your very good prosecutor down,”*** Mr. Trump said, later adding that Mr. Lutsenko ***“was treated very badly and he was a very fair prosecutor.”***

The part about Lutsenko was added not necessarily by Trump, but by the author of this fake news narrative trying to implicate Trump in a crime. 

Again, if Trump was talking about Shokin this entire thing is complete nonsense. Given the timeline of events, and given Trump was going after Biden's corruption of publicly admitting to threatening to without funds to get the prosecutor looking into his son fired, it's a much safer bet to replace the name Lutsenko with the name Shokin in all these quotes that seem to be intentionally taken out of context to trick people into believing Trump is guilty of any crimes."
