worldpolitics,ffdfbb1,t1_ffcuvri,1579819677.0,"Trump might have more supporters than you think if they keep complaining about this and that, wasting money trying to get him out, all without being successful.

Everything they repeated day in and day out has been lies. 

Russia was a DNC staffer by the name of Seth Rich. He saw that they stole the primary from Bernie and handed it to Clinton. He then turned over the emails to Wikileaks. The download rate was too fast for a remote Russian to do so. A couple memes didn’t sway the election.

Ukraine aid was held due to suspicion of corruption...which will come out in the near future. 

Aid being withheld is not a crime. If you were going to give someone money, then suspected they may be doing something wrong with it, would you still give it to them?

Speaking of aid, remember hurricane Maria and how they said we never sent aid? Did you see how they just found warehouses full of supplies we sent and their corrupt asses hid it? Trump called it but they all said he was lying...I guess innocent lives are less important than admitting Trump can do one good thing.

Back to this shit show-
They literally said, “we can’t let the voter decide this because the election might be compromised.”

Go back to the late 90s and everyone of them who was in office then said what they are doing now was wrong.

I’m just saying they are all hypocrites and liars trying to cover their corrupt asses.

I guess if you had a regime executing 15 year old boys for being gay, beating and locking up women for years for refusing to wear the headscarf, or killing you for protesting your government you might feel different that a terrorist was killed without taking out civilians who is helpful with all of that, responsible for 100,000+ lives, and was actively plotting attacks.

There are plenty of videos being put out there, from Iran, that say the opposite of what the media tells you. But I guess thinking the corporate media might have an agenda is crazy cultist ideology.

Just because someone says look into how people, real people are reporting what’s going on, not the media telling you what to think, and most of its bullshit(wether cnn or Fox News) doesn’t mean they worship Trump.

Want to know more...research CEOs who resigned following that EO. Google’s CEO resigned the same day!

Trump cut ties (photo ops and interactions) with this creep following the information that Epstein was a pedo and Trump testified to get him locked up. Unfortunately the prosecutor was told to stand down and Epstein got off with a cakewalk of a sentence.

Epstein “killed himself”...well we all know that’s bs. Maxwell is more valuable and is being protected...Epstein may be dead (of no further use) or “dead” (GITMO for protection)

People are respectful around people they don’t like to avoid negative situations. This guy was extremely powerful and tied to everyone! Don’t worry, it will all come out soon...it takes time to eliminate evil of this magnitude without messing up and letting them slip away.

This man was responsible for 100,000+ lives. To make a decision like this you have to take human dignity into account. If he is planning to take more lives you have to find the best opportunity to take him out. Based on the military intelligence this was the best opportunity with minimal loss of innocent life. It’s not an easy choice but you have to weight the good and bad and realize more lives were at stake if he was left breathing.

Trump canceled an air strike at the last minute because the risk of innocent life lost outweighed the benefits not long ago. We don’t love in a perfect world but we have to make the best out of what we can. Of course we can’t see what would have happened had he carried out these plots so this is what we have.

I do support the people who risk their lives to prevent that bs from happening here. I just wish others were as grateful for the sacrifices made.

Comparing that to being an asshole who mistreats vets or the homeless is way off. They are being killed, raped and tortured over there. Children are separated because there is no proof that those are their parents. You do realize the cartel traffics children and are doing so more often than people seeking asylum.
