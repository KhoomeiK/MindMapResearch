As for the social side of Pollock, I mean, it's almost all people of a certain socio-economic background since a lot of people wouldn't be able to afford Pollock, a lot of international students as well but that's just Edinburgh in general. People from Pollock also tend to stick with other Pollock people I've found (wasn't uncommon when I was in first year for people from Pollock to lose interest in you once they found out you weren't in Pollock) but that won't be an issue for you obviously. 

I wouldn't worry about it, I wouldn't say exclusively for the London bubble because like I said it's more about money, yes a lot of students from London can afford it, but so can a lot from other places in the UK, and from elsewhere in the world. There are a lot of people at Pollock, you'll find someone you like.

However, more serious suicidal thought can develop slowly. It's not uncommon for suicidality to start off as lightheartedly thinking things like ""god I just want to shoot myself"" or ""it would be seriously easier to just die right now"" or to imagine dying, again key work lightheartedly rather than anything the person perceives as serious, often as a reaction to things going wrong and minor inconveniences and difficulties etc.

Now most people experience this as a coping mechanism at times of stress, and usually the stressful period passes and people move on and it's fine, but it can also be one of the first signs that someone is slipping into a more serious mental state that will develop into more seriously meant and regular thoughts of suicide, and then into more detailed considerations of whether or not to go through with it, and into planning and then attempting.

OutOfTheLoop,feklfxl,t3_epmawl,1579202499.0,"Answer: It's been like this for a while now, at least a couple of years, very intensely for at least 1 year. It's hard to know how to explain it other than to say that kpop music is very popular, obviously in South Korea, but also increasingly in the west. if you want an explanation for that, you could point to the fact that there aren't really any big boy bands or girl bands in the way that there used to be (one direction et al) so kpop groups are filling that niche, but because of the way the industry is set up and the types of content that is produced sometimes fans tend to be even more obsessive than you averegae one direction fan."

Look, think of it this way, the victims were working class football ""hooligans"", a group the Sun generally pits itself against and would have run countless stories against, and the culprits, at least in some large part, were the police who had completely fucked up crowd management that day. Now, if you're right wing authoritarian like The Sun are, you can't directly criticise the police in that way, you can accuse the justice system of being too soft, sure, but the police are fairly untouchable since they are the front line in how you exert power and control, you have to keep them on your side and you can't risk making them unpopular or weak through bad press.
