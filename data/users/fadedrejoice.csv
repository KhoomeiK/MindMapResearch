vinyl,ffe8dpi,t3_er8tgk,1579839494.0,Hey all. This may make me sound dumb and clueless but I kinda am. I recently got a new player and my cousin told me to put a penny on the arm because I was having some feedback coming from the needle? Idk if that’s a thing but that’s what I sounded like. I put the penny on and it seemed to fix the issue but it keeps falling off? Should I even be bothering to do this?
