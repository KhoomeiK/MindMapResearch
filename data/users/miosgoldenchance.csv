Another fun fact - dogs are one of the few animals that can follow a pointing hand gesture. Wolves cannot."
AskVet,ffndl29,t1_ffmzx0u,1580064565.0,"Good luck. Open mouth breathing in a kitty is unfortunately a true emergency. She needs help now, even if that means just finding someone to end her suffering."
