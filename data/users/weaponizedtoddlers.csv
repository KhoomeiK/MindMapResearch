EnoughCommieSpam,fejk63s,t1_fehzs20,1579177593.0,I went to a post-Soviet school until 3rd grade when my family immigrated to the US. The way it was in my school was we learned to march in a line in first grade in gym class. Then there was a whole lot of boring marching until the kids got a wooden replica in I think 6th grade to practice rifle discipline. One for each class I mean. Then the upper classes got to try a real unloaded AK. I remember watching what was I think 10th graders in the field and the guy taking his turn was prone on the grass and learning how to switch out the magazine etc. with an instructor being a retired army guy as far as I remember.

sleep,fe8pu68,t1_fe6n6m6,1578929093.0,"My source for it is Matthew Walker's Why We Sleep, Chapter 4 ""How should we sleep?"" p.69-70:

""Around the close of the early modern era (circa late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries), historical texts suggest that Western Europeans would take two long bouts of sleep at night, separated by several hours of wakefulness. Nestled in-between these twin slabs of sleep-sometimes called first sleep and second sleep, they would read, write, pray, make love, and even socialize.

This practice may very well have occurred during this moment in human history, in this geographical location. Yet the fact that no pre-industrial cultures studied to date demonstrate a similar nightly split-shift suggests that it is *not the natural, evolutrionarily programmed* form of human sleep. Rather, it appears to have been a cultural phenomenon that appeared and was popularized with the western European migration."" (my emphasis)

The author indeed cites Ekirch as a source on the Dickensian era sleep habits and goes on to speak in a positive manner regarding siesta practice.

I understand that I was not very clear, just like the comment above was not very clear in the ""people used to naturally sleep in two segments"" bit. Also, a long bout of sleep at night followed by a short siesta in the mid-afternoon does qualify as a form of biphasic or segmented sleep. My issue has been with the claim that the first sleep followed by a second sleep bit that periodically pops up in an article about sleep ""may be a more natural form of sleep"" rather than a cultural phenomenon observed in western Europe. It then goes on to be misconstrued as it's a way we *should* sleep and that it is better than a long uninterrupted bout of sleep at night.

If the claim would be ""people used to naturally sleep in two segments (night sleep, afternoon siesta)"" I am much more on board with it and absolutely support revival of the practice of a siesta to the hectic modern life. All this being said, if OP feels great and refreshed with a 1 hour break between two ""sleeps"", I do not have an objection to it other than it just takes a long time."
sleep,fe6khby,t1_fe5rhwf,1578893875.0,"No that was a cultural phenomenon in the Dickensian era. The so-called biphasic sleep. There isn't a record of it in any other time period unless you're talking about a full night of sleep and a short siesta in the afternoon which is different from ""sleep 4 hours, wake 1-2 hours, sleep again"". It's true that people in Europe used to do that, but it being natural is a myth that should've died after the last clickbait article on it."

sleep,fcst781,t1_fcskkuj,1577924490.0,"> Which means that you probably get more NREM sleep.. did you read the article? 

Yes did you read the article? Do you know who published the study? Matthew Walker. He is an opponent of cannabis as a sleep aid because of the detrimental effects of THC on REM sleep. CBD oil *maybe* has some positive effects for some people, but may have the opposite effect for others depending on the dose.

If you feel groggy then a good idea would be to talk to your GP and get a sleep lab done with a sleep specialist.

I've spent months where I would wake up 1:30 or 2 hours before I need to wake up and then fall back asleep right away. It didn't affect my sleep quality, but was just annoyingly regular. It eventually went away on it's own."
