MurderedByWords,fe3zpk4,t3_enoz9r,1578854403.0,"This doesn't seem like the kind of thing that deserved a murder. The whole point of this woman's post was that she was admitting to something she was ashamed of. She's cheating on a good guy that loves her and that she loves back. Yeah, she's the asshole here. But her sex life is unfulfilling, which is why she's doing it. It's not her guys fault that the sex ends so soon (technically it's his fault, but not intentionally so), but let's be honest, that's some weak sex to have every day. But still, she should be having conversations with her husband about why she's unhappy. But the point of her posting at all was because she was doing a shitty thing and felt shitty about it. She's not a narcissist or a predator or anything vicious, she's an unhappy woman who's making terrible choices and feels bad for making them. She deserved someone to point her in a good direction, not to throw YOU'RE TRASH in her face. She needed more of a ""fix your life, you're throwing away something good"" conversation."
