Sanaa is another option but not because of the food but rather because you can see the animals at lunch instead of it being too dark at dinner.

You may also need to factor in sustainability. Some people struggle with making too many large changes at once. If you're changing your diet and going to the gym it can be a big adjustment.

loseit,fciybxc,t1_fciub1u,1577672755.0,"Maybe, maybe not.

When we lose weight we don't only lose fat, some percentage of it is muscle. If you're actively working out and eating enough protein this can help you maintain more muscle while losing. If you lose more muscle than what you gained while gaining weight then your bf% would be higher at the same weight as previously which will make you look different.

Fat does tend to follow last on/first off so in theory the fat you put on should be the fat that leaves. 

Losing weight can also have an affect on the elasticity of your skin in those areas.

There are just too many variables to say anything definitive."

Some people use a weekly calorie target instead of daily. 

Others go for the bullseye approach where they try to target their goal but wind up above or below it. The closer the better.

Others even 'save' calories for the weekend this way. 200 a day for 5 days gives you an extra 1000 for Saturday night.

I'm completely unaware of what sort of accreditation is needed in the UK. In the U.S. the requirements are laughable, I believe you can knock it out in a weekend. If you're at a commercial gym they'll have the minimums and anything above and beyond would likely mean they'd be working somewhere else.

You're describing a personal trainer.

Be aware a common tactic is to give you a free session then kick your ass to show you how much you need the pt (personal trainer). Don't let it discourage you.

It's also expensive. This can help keep you accountable because not showing up is throwing money away but it also may be unsustainable long term depending on your finances. 

Looking at beginner group classes may also be a good strategy. They won't show you how to work the gym but they are structured and depending on your gym are either free or a much lower cost.

Of course reddit is also a good resource. /r/fitness and /r/xxfitness are good places to get started. Look at the sidebars for the faqs."
