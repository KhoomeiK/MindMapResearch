sociology,fgmpxto,t3_ezdvos,1580929665.0,"You actually already said it, the term most people would use is is ""structural racism"" or ""structural sexism"" or ""structural discrimination or oppression.""  Some people will argue that there is a difference between prejudice and racism to try to get at this concept, but I do think its more clear to just say ""structural...""

The goal of seeing oppressions as structural is move beyond the idea that individual bad faith or hatred are the root causes.  So it is absolutely true that women can have individually sexist ideas or participate in sexist oppression.  And that is because they grow up in a society that is fundamentally shaped by sexism.  It is how we think about gender int he US -- men are women are different, they are the ""natural categories"" they are sexually attracted to each because of reproduction, etc.  Just because I am a girl or a woman its not like I get special training on how to think like a feminist.  So of course individuals of every group, dominant or oppressed can have thoughts and feelings that are oppressive and discriminatory.  Of course we can all participate in structures that reproduce inequalities.  Even when we as individuals may be trying really hard not to, its as inescapable as any other part of society.  Just like I can't start showing up to work in my bathing suit and everyone will that's okay, I can't change my individual behavior or thoughts around sexism or racism and everyone goes along with me.

So I would avoid the language of directionality all together.  These inequalities are in our language and culture and society, we inherit them and learn them simply be being members of our society."

There is a difference between structural racism and individual racism.  There were plenty of racist people against slavery.  They might not have wanted slavery, but that didn't mean they wanted black folks to be friends and coworkers with whites.

Racism has nothing to do with anyone being natural enemies.  Its about the history of colonialism and slavery where Europeans decided they were entitled to control the world economy because they were superior to everyone else.  This isn't some radical crazy race theory, this is basic history.  Go to r/askhistorians and ask them where the idea of race and racism came from.  It has a history.  The ancient Romans didn't think of themselves as white and Carthaginians as black.  None of this has anything to do with individual morality, but it has everything to do with our inherited history.  We didn't create this mess,  but we do live in it.  So the question is, to you want to continue the racism we inherited or do you want to challenge it?  I'm white and I want to challenge it.

GenX,fgbd6cq,t3_exje0b,1580660874.0,"I totally get why you want to break this down, and its a fine and fun project.  But the thing is, the whole notion of generations is really just an advertising tool meant to help target products to audiences.  So the generations as we label them now are false and misleading and overgeneralized by the characteristics of those with leisure money to spend.  

That makes us inclined to narrow the categories down (like you are doing) and clarify them.  But once we start doing that, it becomes harder and harder to make a scheme that people agree with because growing in the US is so incredibly particular based on our geography, gender, race and class.

So I am born in 1966 and my brother is 1961.  And neither of us really well defined by Boomer or a Gen X.  So your categories work in terms of separating him from Boomer, but still put me with Gen X.  Why is that a problem?  Because the 80's Grunge scene was a local development -- grunge didn't travel until the 90's.  I was out of college and in grad school when Nirvana's first album came out.  It can hardly be said to have shaped my youth.  Heavy metal was around in my teen years, but I never really got into it, it was more of a boy scene.  I was more classic rock and punk, but true punk was over by the time I got into it.  Meanwhile, in NYC lower income kids and black kids were creating hip hop, rap and house party music.  Rap on the west coast developed a very different sound and pattern from east coast rap, and that difference was significant for kids of that age and time.  Punk, Metal and Grunge were irrelevant to them.  The rural south and midwest were being swept by the Satanic Panic which seriously impacted some of the kids because it was taken so seriously by the adults in their lives, while in my more educated upper middle class suburb it was a joke.

The oppressed were the people in the white legal and economic structure who participated in the denial of basic rights and benefited from it.  Recognizing the system did victimize them as a community, it wasn't all in their heads or just a matter of how they defined themselves, African Americans organized to challenge the system.

bannedfeminists,fg2rlp1,t3_ewigd3,1580453076.0,"Yep.  r/feminism is run by non-feminists.  There is some history suggesting this is on purpose to make feminism look ridiculous.  There are a few people who may be motivated to actually try to do something about this, but we have not gotten our shit together to make anything happen.  But it still is something I want to deal with."
Foodforthought,fg2rckp,t1_fg2l5y5,1580452806.0,That does sound a lot like my retirement plan.
feminisms,fg20vtm,t1_ffz3w5u,1580436187.0,"Well, I don't really like this question because the truth none of us know what anything really evolved for, its always speculation.  It may just be an outcome of being primarily visual mammals and being able to imagine things that not in front of us and think about the future.   But I suppose it would be useful for spatial navigation, finding food sources and such."
science,ffydr6q,t3_evrvhw,1580343995.0,Well isn't this just another way of saying having a human brain puts you at risk of mental illness?
AskAnthropology,ffydec7,t3_evvk5o,1580343756.0,"There is an argument to be made that there is a social component to almost all illnesses.  Consider flu viruses that jump the species barrier from birds or pigs to humans.  They are able to do that because of farming.  As we cut down forests and put people into closer contact with the few remaining natural habitats of various animal species we increase the likelihood of more virus and bacteria to spread to humans.  Air travel means flus and colds spread much more quickly and widely.  Many cancers have causes produced by humans, a sedentary lifestyle increase risks of heart and cardiovascular disease.  Racism produces cumulative stressors that increase the likelihood of certain health problems for people of color.  The biggest predictor of your health and mortality is your socio-economic status.

There are diseases that culturally defined, but I would not say that culture causes disease, I would be more careful to say that certain kinds of social and economic arrangements cause patterns of health and illness."
feminisms,ffycc23,t1_ffwgcd7,1580343041.0,"Its useful in planning for building or placement of troops, or anything where you need to imagine the shape and relation ship of objects in space.  Less useful once you have computer models, but its always been a major test for military training."
feminisms,ffyc2se,t1_ffvdu0s,1580342869.0,"I know, right?"
SeriousConversation,ffxynsi,t3_evr801,1580335012.0,"I think there are legitimate questions here.  When an industry becomes part of an educational institution it is open to these kinds of questions -- an ethics course in the topic would be appropriate.  There are good arguments for decriminalizing and regulating industries that exist on the margins of formal economies, and adult entertainment is certainly not a marginal business."
AskAnthropology,ffxy7t5,t3_ev5d97,1580334758.0,I think the big question is one of scale.  A hundred people can only cause so much damage.  5 billion people can destroy the planet.
newhaven,ffxxsf8,t3_evsnz5,1580334517.0,I really want to check it out!
GirlGamers,ffxxq6e,t3_evru43,1580334481.0,lol what a delightful flower you are!  Love the attitude.
HistoryPorn,ffwqshu,t1_ffv73gk,1580308754.0,Yes.
CasualConversation,ffwqqyp,t1_ffvj8oq,1580308725.0,Good for you!!!!
newhaven,ffwpti7,t1_ffvr9gy,1580308053.0,I agree completely. I also think we need to redefine when it is okay to use deadly force. It should not be based on individual fear but some measure of objective danger
TrueReddit,ffvivf1,t1_ffvi6v4,1580265155.0,"Well, we don't know that.  Technically the study is not meaningless, it just did not measure the variable you would like it to have measured in the way you would like to have measured it."
science,ffvimci,t1_ffvgzql,1580264986.0,"You don't get to define the word ""better,"" the research does.  Past researchers argued that men were more capable of completing the task than women, not that men were faster at it.  This research is significant because it shows that women and men are equally capable of completing the task.  This research also suggests that men do it faster because they use a different method, so conceivably one could be trained to use the faster method.  It is not a difference in capability."
TrueReddit,ffvhntv,t1_ffvh1ln,1580264340.0,"Oh I thought it was a joke, sorry.  The article didn't say, I am guessing they went by self identification."
AskAnthropology,ffvhlh5,t1_ffvh46q,1580264295.0,Well apparently we can have a lot of variation and still be the same species. We need a physical anthropologist for more details.
CasualConversation,ffvhbkv,t3_evdf27,1580264112.0,"I can't tell you how happy and proud I am for you.  It is a great day when a person decides they and their kids deserve to be treated with respect, and when some family or friends are willing to help them get a new start.  That is what being human is all about.  Thank you so much for sharing your story.  You really rock!"
science,ffvgwb1,t1_ffverf9,1580263834.0,"It may be, but it still undermines the claim that men are ""better"" at the task."
science,ffvgtrw,t1_ffvdoha,1580263788.0,"Right, but the point is that that is an arbitrary standard.  It does not mean that men are better at the task, they are simply faster at the task."
TrueReddit,ffvggtx,t1_ffvg27w,1580263550.0,THAT is an excellent question.
science,ffvgbh1,t1_ffvbz99,1580263450.0,"Yes, mice are not humans.  All research with mice should be taken assessed as relevant in mice."
AskAnthropology,ffvftfa,t3_evfrg2,1580263120.0,I'm afraid the answer is right in front of you -- its one of those things that's so obvious we forget.  Its because we have always been the same species.
