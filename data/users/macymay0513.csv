I’m jealous that you can actually leave it -_-"
offmychest,ff8p7es,t1_ff8os61,1579690005.0,Thank you for taking time out of your own day to respond to me... it really means a lot. It feels really good to have someone understand me for once... I’ll do better... I just don’t know why it’s hit me all of a sudden
UnsentLetters,ff8p1jj,t3_es3pyj,1579689761.0,"I know exactly what you mean... and for while, I really hated myself for putting myself in a situation like that. But I suppose loves like that always tend to come out as a surprise and they stick. What I’ve learnt is to let it be a positive thing... love has the ability to make or break who we are. It’s beautiful and dangerous all at the same time, but only if you let one favour the other. I still have dreams of my ex... because I still have a deep love for him that I know I’ll never get over, but I use it as strength to keep me going... knowing that I’m a better person now because of what he came into my life to teach me"
offmychest,ff8al1x,t3_erkltn,1579670998.0,"That’s so fucking amazing! Congratulations!! I’m so happy for you! That’s really made my day, I hope the sun shines extra bright for you tomorrow!!"
offmychest,ff8agyo,t3_es5ecr,1579670891.0,"I know exactly what you mean... I’m sorry you’re experiencing all of that... I had to learn the hard way too... I recently separated from my partner, before the new year, and when I needed my ‘friends’ the most... they weren’t there. 

I had to cut a lot of people out of my life because of how much negativity they were giving me. Some people are like that, unfortunately... they’re only there when they need something and that’s how life is at times. Learn to be kind to yourself, be your own best friend for now, and one day someone will come into your life and be the best friend that deserve. What you manifest is wha you’ll get, and one day you will get that loyal best friend that hangs out with you and just supports you. A mutual give and take friendship. 

But for now, hi! You’ve got a friend in me should you ever need it! I believe in you! :)"
offmychest,ff8a2lg,t3_es6789,1579670515.0,"First off, I’m so sorry that life’s been so unkind to you and your family. I don’t know if it means much, but I’m sending as much love as I possibly can to you... 

And secondly... I know the feeling. I know my pain won’t amount to the pain your feeling, but pain is pain after all... I lost one of my best friends to suicide years ago and I remember not being able to cry about it for almost a year. Sometimes that happens, when bad things happen right after another. It makes you feel so much pain to the point where you become numb... and then stop feeling it at all. And because it’s so fast paced, you don’t have time to mourn or grieve after each thing. It’s like a feeling beyond sadness...

What did it for me was finding a way to just focus on my feelings. When I felt tears coming, I made sure I got to a space where I could just be by myself and I wrote how I felt. It didn’t work for everyone but there are other ways to focus on what it is you’re feeling. Perhaps the reason you can’t cry is because you’re blocking yourself from doing it without even realising. Thinking about it might help but it might also block you, try and find an outlet. Whether it be writing, drawing, ripping you paper... something that will relieve the frustration but also allow you the time to think about everything you’ve gone through and give you time to process it all...

I hope the sun comes out for you wherever you are... I believe in you :)"
offmychest,ff89ixp,t3_es41oh,1579669998.0,"Excuse my French...

That’s fucking amazing! I’m so fucking proud of you! And I believe in you!

You are beautiful, loved and valued. Never forget that... :)"
offmychest,ff89d2x,t3_eqnjho,1579669847.0,"First off, being able to admit your most vulnerable emotions is the bravest thing anyone can do. And you should be proud of yourself. It’s not easy for some people to admit that they’re not okay or that they aren’t who they want to be. That takes a lot of strength, whether it’s a drunk declaration or not. 

Secondly, it sounds like you care for her a lot. And not just the romantic kind of care, it sounds a like a deep love and care for someone who means a lot to you. And it sounds like she loves you a lot too, if she was willing to give everything to you... and if someone truly loves and cares for you, they’ll want to see you at your best. They’ll want to see you happy. 

I fell in love with my best friend and I still- and will always- love him, but the universe just thought we weren’t ready for each other. Perhaps not now or not ever... but I’ve made peace with the thought that if he isn’t my twin flame, he is a wonderful soulmate. Theres no hate between us, it just wasn’t right for the time of our lives that we’re in right now. It’s good to be hopeful, but a realistic hopeful. The universe has us in its hands, I’m just letting it do it’s thing. It’s incredibly painful, I won’t lie to you... and everyday has gotten harder because I miss him so much and, like you, I’d give anything to hear his voice again. But I know that he’s getting back up onto his feet, slowly but surely. I know I need to do that too, but I can’t help but need him now more than ever... 

But I know he doesn’t need me and that’s okay! It’s what’s best for him.... C’est la vie, right :) 

Being away from him opened my eyes to lots of things and made appreciate what he did for me more. Do I wish he was still in my life everyday? fuck yeah. There’s nothing I want more. 
But if we weren’t apart, I wouldn’t have learnt what heartbreak felt like. I wouldn’t have learnt how to fend for myself. I wouldn’t have learnt how to pull myself away from the edge... I wouldn’t have learnt to be okay with not being okay...

it also made me realise that I’m not ready for something like that yet, and I’ve decided to work on myself first. There’s always a part of me that still loves him. And no matter how much he’s hurt me, I’ll always be quick to make sure that he knows that he is loved and valued. Because he is. And you are too. 

Love is potent. It makes you feel like you have wings but also feels like you’ve got an anchor strapped to your feet. When you enter a relationship you know that what you’re essentially doing, is giving that person the power to hurt you. And it cuts deep. But at the same time, that person also trust you enough to be vulnerable to you too. If you both love each other, that is. Some cuts don’t heal, and some do. But the essence and purpose of those scars in life, is the option it gives you: you either let it help you grow and develop or tear you down completely. I’m sure you went to best for her, and I’m sure she wants the best for you too. 

But it’s time to want the best for yourself aswell. 

You sound like someone who puts out a lot of love... but never saves some for yourself...

Find something you love to do. What makes you happy? 
Even if it’s a temporary happiness! 
Going on a walk? Writing? Singing? Sports? Start there and walk with baby steps. It’s okay to be scared of falling on your ass sometimes, otherwise how will you ever learn to run?

Don’t be too hard on yourself either. 

There are so many people that love you and want the best for you. Your family, your friends... it might not seem like it at times but they want you to be happy too. 

Do something that’ll improve yourself, things that are healthy and kind for your wellbeing. Something that’ll help you work off the negativity and develop yourself at the same time. It’s a long process but it’s necessary for us to go through sometimes. Work on being the man that you WANT to be. 

My mama always says, ‘If God thinks it right for people to come back to each other, whether it be friends or lovers, he’ll make sure it happens when you’re ready. And if not, he’s got better things planned for you’

Focus on yourself, believe that you deserve good things and good things will come to you. Manifest goodness, and make sure you thank the universe or whoever you believe in- If you believe in anything at all- for working to create happiness for you. Be more forgiving of yourself and be honest with yourself. If you want love, then give it. If you want forgiveness or honesty or a second chance, then allow yourself to become someone who deserves it. 

Instead of beating yourself up about not being the man that the woman you loved deserves, do something that allows you to become someone that’s close to it. That is, if that’s what you decide you want. If you want to be the man she deserves then choose to be it, if you realise it’s not what you genuinely want then don’t. But you need to first, before anything else, know what you want and what you need. 

If you want to be with someone because you genuinely, truly and deeply love, don’t change who you are as a person but do the little things. Communicate your vulnerabilities and worries, let people know that you appreciate them. call people out if they’ve hurt you. Be strong enough to admit you’re wrong and apologise. Tell the people you love they you love them. Do something To let them know that you’re thinking of them. Say thank you if they’ve taken the time to let you know that they’re thinking of you too... The little things are important. Though they are little, they mean a hell of a lot. 

Who are we to say that you aren’t the person that your woman deserves, because that might not be what she wants in the first place. Try not to assume what people deserve because it might not be what they want or need, instead focus on what you want to deserve. What you need in your life. And that’s not limited to romantic love. 

Learn to love yourself first. 

Once you have grown into the person you want to be, when you are older and wiser, maybe your woman might be too. If it’s right, it’ll be right. But work on your own personal goals for now, put yourself first. And if, down the line, she chooses to come back home to you and start again (and if you choose her too)... then you’ll be a better version of yourself and you’ll be ready. 

I believe in you! You just need to believe in yourself too :)"
offmychest,fdto7ql,t1_fdtn4em,1578719637.0,"I’m really sorry that you’re hurting too... I needed to get it out of my system somehow because it was eating away at me and I couldn’t do it to myself anymore. He was my first love and I’ll always have a love for him... yeah the context of the love is different now but he taught me to value and love myself first... i thought it backfired but looking at it again, he was put in my path to teach me that. He came into my life for a reason and I guess he wasn’t meant to stay... writing this fucking sucks and it hurts a lot....

But seeing that I’m not the only one in this situation gave me a bit of strength... we can do this. I believe in you, love is a strong thing. Don’t let go of the happiness and the lessons you learnt in your relationship, use it to grow... that’s what I’ve learnt from the other wonderful reddit users who messaged me... you’re not alone, but you also need to remember that you are loved and valued and beautiful... and you need to believe it to. The hard choices are hard for a reason, it might not be the one we want to make, but if it’s one that we have to do to make ourselves happy then we need to push ourselves to be strong enough to do that... 

I believe in you, whatever you choose to do."
