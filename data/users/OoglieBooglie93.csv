ANSYS has a crapton of buttons and was extremely irritating for me to use in school, but it is much more powerful than the FEA stuff built in to CAD programs. That said, the simiplified FEA stuff in the CAD programs might be better to learn the basic ideas with because you won't be overwhelmed with so many different options, and you can screw around with the part to make changes and see what happens in the same program."

Furnace not working? Google. Ac not working? Google. Washing machine not working? Google. Car leaking coolant from some wonky spot that makes no sense? Google (and a pain in the ass to repair).

If you can google and are not a complete idiot, you can fix almost anything."

EngineeringStudents,feilraq,t3_epb1bl,1579141498.0,"People at my school were told it was generally better to have a sponsored project from an actual company, because it would look better to employers and give a bigger budget. If you don't have a sponsor or much funding from your school, make sure you can do it with cheap junk or scrap laying around.

My project doubled as a club competition project.

Maybe make a tool that your school's machineshop or makerspace (if you have one) can use to help make future projects. Then everyone is happy. Or maybe a wind tunnel or something to measure stuff. Then put a Bulbasaur in it and compare the results to that meme CFD screenshot."

I never did much with my Arduino, and I really don't have any idea how much processing power voice recognition requires. I really don't think you'l get much cheaper than an Arduino though. 6 bucks for a knockoff nano on ebay with free shipping is pretty hard to beat. The Uno or Mega should have more power and only be a few bucks more for a knockoff.

I've made some drawings by hand as well. All you really need for that is a paper, pencil, ruler, compass, protractor, and some way of maintaining the horizontal/vertical position for all the lines. This method takes some forethought if you want to keep the dimensions neat because you'll be stuck with eraser marks if you screw up."

You can get knockoff Arduinos from Microcenter if you have one nearby, or maybe get some sketchy ones direct from China online. I believe the cheapest Arduinos are the nanos at like $5 or $10 a pop, but I don't know how much processing power your project requires.

An alternative to an arduino is a raspberry pi, but those run about $35 and require an SD card (sold separately). Basically an entire miniature computer that could be turned into a low-end laptop, though."
