Carlin bitched about the world but was able to do it humorously. A generation of 'comics' aped the bitchy part but forgot to be funny. Instead it feels like a Trump campaign rally where the comic just rants about shit and you're expected to laugh or whatever because you think 'oh man I can relate to that and share the same view', not because there's an actual joke in there anywhere.

There's only a tenth of a gram of caffeine in a cup of coffee, which is a tiny amount, and it would be trivial to accidentally ingest 5 times that all at once if you're eyeballing it, especially on the trail. 5 coffee cup equivalents all at once could create some serious jitters...

I'd personally stick with coffee/tea. When you're cold you get the benefit of a hot drink anyway.

Camping next to the car before hiking = cooler with whatever you want in it. 

Hiking to a remote campsite for one night, maybe two = stuff you can carry comfortably and doesn't require much preparation or extra gear to prepare. Just whatever won't spoil or get ruined squished in your pack and doesn't weigh a ton. If you really want eggs in the morning, there is egg powder which you can mix with water and make reconstituted scrambled eggs, or you can *carefully* take actual eggs (I've done it). I don't think I'd trust the carton liquid egg stuff to be unrefrigerated for any amount of time though. A shelf stable breakfast meat (precooked bacon or tinned meat for example, or cured sausage) and oatmeal, etc make for a decent hot breakfast. Everything tastes better in the woods, so while a breakfast of summer sausage and oatmeal may not be appetizing in your home, it's pretty satisfying out there. 

Long distance/multi day hikes = time to start looking at dehydrated/freeze dried/etc meals. 

Universally applicable to any category above = cheap, lightweight and easy sides like instant mashed potatoes, Knorr pasta sides, ramen noodles, instant rice, mac and cheese, etc."

https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2019-09-21/salesforce-tentatively-cleared-in-backpage-sex-trafficking-suit

It was a lawsuit which was dismissed, not a criminal investigation. A group of 50 women sued Salesforce because Backpage used the Salesforce platform to host their stuff. Suing Salesforce for that is like suing a web hosting company (or something) because some bad people used it. 

I'm a Salesforce admin for my company (I don't work for Salesforce but I am the platform admin for the company I work for). You pay Salesforce for a blank, default instance, and then you do what you want with it. Salesforce doesn't build it for you, and instead point you to certified third party consultants if you want someone to build it for you. 

I can go to Amazon and pay 5 bucks a month for a T2 small EC2 instance and host my own website where I do illegal shit. That's not Amazon's problem. They just sell you the platform. Sure they'll kick you off if they catch you breaking terms and conditions (which might include clauses banning anything illegal), but it's not on them to police everything, and it would actually be a huge privacy problem if these providers spied on everything you do, and hosted services would end completely. 

You might as well sue Gmail because someone, somewhere used it to do something evil.

Do you even know? Is it freedom? Or truth? Perhaps peace? Could it be for love? Illusions, Mr. Anderson. Vagaries of perception.

It is the quintessential human delusion, simultaneously the source of your greatest strength, and your greatest weakness.*

The way I see it, his 'rule' is to not serve as jury and executioner and sentence criminals to death. But if it's in self-defense or to save someone else (like saving Martha from flame thrower dude), that's on the bad guy.

See: Batman killing Harvey Dent in The Dark Knight. He didn't want to kill Harvey, but Dent was about to shoot Gordon's son and he didn't have a choice. But he would have of course not done it if he had a choice. 

Plenty of goons (and the Joker) were offed in 1989 Batman too, but nobody complains about that."

They'll be indoors sitting at computers, which is just as dumb a place to wear foliage based camouflage as outer space. 

What's more is that this 'Space Force' bullshit will end shortly after Trump is gone. It's dumb."

Regarding the vampires and werewolves, I always thought they were the earlier Matrix versions of Agents. In trying to initially keep humans under control they created a sort of fantasy universe based on human mythology. The ghost twins in Revelations would have been similar holdovers. 

The Agents are just more modernized 'spooks'."
