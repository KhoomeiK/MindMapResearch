NarcissisticAbuse,fethlzt,t3_eqkf0b,1579375570.0,"My Nex was like this too!! Always really high, really full, really tired, or really depressed. He was never just “content” with sitting and watching a movie with me. Spending time with me was *unbearable* to him."

I hear your heart hurting for those kids that don’t know any better.  Your post made me cry. Cry that you have to be there at the worst times, but also, that this is the turning point for those kids. I’m proud of you and you have my support."
aww,feeaqi2,t3_eonffw,1579029895.0,Congratulations from a birth mom. Giving is probably the best thing a mom like me can do.
UnsentLetters,fe0aok2,t1_fe0ai8q,1578807944.0,"Thank you for your kind words and prayers. There are much worse things to go through, but this is the hardest thing I’ve gone through yet in life. I really appreciate your support."

ForeverAloneDating,fctee87,t3_eip0a9,1577940603.0,"I thoroughly enjoyed your subtle humor in this post! A rare gem to stumble across! I’m in the Midwest too, care for coffee?"
AskReddit,fcs196l,t3_eii9ke,1577909854.0,"The most subtle things a guy can wear is a button up shirt that compliments his eyes, his sleeves rolled up to his elbow (to show off those sexy veins that pop out), and one button from the collar undone to show a bit of outline from his chest, but not too much though. Also, jeans that fit *just right*, making the ass seem very sexy and highlighted. ~Just my opinion though!"
aww,fclbw14,t3_ehni6t,1577744248.0,**Why doesn’t this have sound?!?!** The most wholesome thing is the click of a birds talons whilst hopping around innocently on hard surfaces... :(
abusiverelationships,fcg4rm9,t1_fcdlwnj,1577636452.0,"Physical, emotional, and mental abuse destroys the one person that we look at and change the most: ourselves. But, you already took the first and second steps toward healing! First, and most pivotal, you walked away and left the abusive situation. Second, you realized what hurt you! Third, trying to turn over a new leaf, because a person rarely heals back into the person they were before the relationship. You now have knowledge into what *not* to fall into again. I am sorry that you feel empty and invisible. But now, you have a bigger opportunity to make the most of what and who you want to be. If you ever need anybody to talk to, don’t be afraid to message me! I am here for your support."

UnsentLetters,fc2vtji,t3_efv3v2,1577375389.0,This was a punch to my heart. I am so sorry for your loss. I am here for you dear stranger.
