sewing,fdw92wo,t3_en6y08,1578756330.0,"There are a few ways to go, all will be visible.

You can sew over the weak parts in a zig zag, by doing a straight seam over it, turning the fabric under the machine and going again. This will reinforce the fabric and be very visible. Best if you add a bit of fabric to the inside and sew through both layers, then trim the excess of the added fabric. If you think of it as a feature and not a flaw, I think this is the best way to go. Wear it with pride, you will have fixed a perfectly good shirt.

You can sew a patch under the weak part, but again, the seam will show. Or sew a patch on the outside as an added design feature.

You can iron on some interfacing, that won't need a seam, but probably will be visible through the thin fabric and will not be as sturdy as something sewn it.

Anything is better than a hole and when it brakes, you won't wear it at all."
sewing,fdw4g3t,t1_fdtev7u,1578754922.0,"Did you thread the machine properly? That exact thing happens to me when the thread has become undone somewhere. Check both the needle and bobbin threads and always use a pice of scrap of the same fabric to test out if your tension and whatnot are correct.

Thin Fabrics need thin needles and thread, as well. And do pull the bobbin thread up to between the feed dogs and hold them to the behind. When sewing thin Fabrics you have to give a slight pull on the threads to help the feed dogs to move the fabric, as there is a very small amount of it between the dog initially.

So do a test on a piece of scrap fabric before you start on your actual pieces."

The solution was to shower the plants, cos the bugs fall off and then repeat the shower in a few weeks until you can get rid of them.

If the animal died, make it worth it. Kind of like hunting for sport is so much worse than hunting to survive and using every last bit of the animal.

But lets be honest, leather is a biproduct of the meat industry. Well, maybe not specialty leather, but definitely cow hide. Leather demand is decreasing, while meat demand is not and animal agricultrure is incredibly expensive. Noone will raise a cow to just harvest the hide and discard the rest. So if an animal is killed for meat, it only makes sense to also use the skin (and the bones etc). Leather is much more durable than alternatives, biodegradeable and attainable to craftsmen.
