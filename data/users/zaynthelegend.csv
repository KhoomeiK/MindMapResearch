I can remember we had some kind of project in school where we had to make this life size model of a computer from styrofoam or something and my mom helped me with the entire thing and one night, when everything was all set, she set out to paint the thing all black ( which was supposed to be my job but I guess she came all the way through) and while she was doing that, she suggested we watch the movie while she painted in the same room ( because it takes a LOT of time to paint foam) and we watched it all the way and looking back, I kind of remember how happy she was watching it with us ( me and my younger brother) because she had watched the movie when she was young and loved it, considering it came out in 1989. I just remembered that one scene where their ant friend gets injured by that scorpion they encountered and watching it die made me SO sad but then my mom must've told me that the ant they used in the movie was a robot and that the real one was taken away, because I cheered up quickly afterwards. One hell of a movie."

AskReddit,fejoy8s,t1_feicpub,1579182040.0," 

I found this information about the video:

Dashcams are a big deal in Russia so there are many videos of accidents filmed from the inside of vehicles. In this video, the dashcam filmed something slightly different, but nevertheless pretty unnerving.

It was a quiet ride down a highway between Azov and Starominskaya in the Rostov region of Russia. A man driving Audi A4 had his wife on the passengers’ seat and a couple with a child in the rear. Their dashcam was filming when on the 11th kilometer of the highway a group of vehicles with large Kamaz-5410 truck in its tail came from the oncoming direction.

The Kamaz truck was loaded with bricks and a few of them came loose. One of them smashed through the Audi A4’s windshield, striking 29 year old Olga Gaikovich who was on the passenger’s seat in the head.

The truck driver didn’t even notice and continued driving on. The woman was taken to the emergency room in the Azov hospital with skull split open where they pronounced her dead after two hours of failing attempts to revive her.

With the use of the video from the dashcam, the police was able to identify the truck driver and are considering pressing charges because cargo was not securely fastened.

The video doesn’t contain any graphic images, but its shock factor and the screams which follow the brick splitting the passenger’s head make for a pretty unnerving experience. The incident occurred on June 12, 2012."
