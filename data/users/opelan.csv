aww,ffaa4zv,t1_ff9x83f,1579730872.0,A bunch of people from my home country are in prison in Turkey for nonsense reasons. They might have said something negative about Erdogan and the AKP in social media or in private and the wrong people heard it. And when they visited Turkey they were declared to be terrorists or helpers of terrorists like Erdogan does with so many of his opponents. So it really depends if you are safe in Turkey or not. The most in danger to get imprisoned seem to be those with a Turkish background who might have parents or grandparents from there. But no one who has openly and not anonymly critisized Erdogan is completely safe there. Though in most cases Turkey will simply deny you entry into the country.

I saw an article about it once which I just tried to find again but so far no success. There they looked at three movies closer. The result was that only looking at the opening weekend wouldn't represent all viewers well at all. Young men were really overrepresented at the opening weekend. In later weeks their percentage decreased as older people and more girls and women watched those movies, too."

Otherwise the portrayal of their relationship wouldn't really work on screen. He has to be developed as an individual and then in relation to Kara. That does take some screen time. 

Even if he doesn't become her love interest, it would be kind of stupid to have a main character in the cast you don't use. I think a character either should have a purpose and proper storylines or he/she should be written out."

She was a regular in season 2. I think if Floriana Lima wouldn't have left the show, she would have been one in season 3, too. 

And yeah Chris Wood got o lot of nasty comments on Twitter. He was very active there before, but then nearly stopped using it. 

Even Rahul Kohli, the guy who played Jack Spheer, got tons of hate and he was only a guest star.

I think by now all male actors playing the love interest of either Kara or Lena are doomed from the start. It doesn't matter what they say or do, they will get tons of hate just because the character they play are in the way of Supercorp."
supergirlTV,ff3yum6,t3_eri1ed,1579551846.0,"Lena was portrayed as a villain this season though one which at her core is not evil incarnate (yet) so she might come out of the darkness again or maybe not and she goes down fully with no return. We will see where the writers will take her character.

The series isn't portraying her deeds in a way that the viewers are suppose to agree with all she has done. I don't think you are suppose to find her manipulating behaviour towards Kara justified or killing Eve or that she tried to mind control the whole human race. So I don't get why you are so concerned about her portrayal. The series isn't sending out the message that she acts in a good way."

https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/dec/05/cslewis.booksforchildrenandteenagers

> Most British children will be utterly clueless about any message beyond the age-old mythic battle between good and evil. Most of the fairy story works as well as any Norse saga, pagan legend or modern fantasy, so only the minority who are familiar with Christian iconography will see Jesus in the lion. After all, 43% of people in Britain in a recent poll couldn't say what Easter celebrated. Among the young - apart from those in faith schools - that number must be considerably higher. Ask art galleries: they now have to write the story of every religious painting on the label as people no longer know what ""agony in the garden"", ""deposition"", ""transfiguration"" or ""ascension"" mean. This may be regrettable cultural ignorance, but it means Aslan will stay just a lion to most movie-goers.

To be honest I have seen the movies as an adult and didn't get any Christianity connection before I read an article about it. I guess you have to be pious and the Christian faith has to be a significant part of your personal life to see it without someone pointing it out."

They obviously never really had a proper plan for season arcs, too. If the series would have been good at what it wanted to be, I think there wouldn't be so many complains, but it is really bad.

So that the series feels and looks different in a lot of regards to older Star Trek series and didn't care at all (at first) to keep Star Trek canon somewhat intact, gets it a lot of additional ill will."
television,ff3lxz5,t1_ff1v0a2,1579543865.0,"Generally speaking the best thing is a good middle ground. You don't want to rush though the set up and the introduction of characters, because then there is a chance that the viewers don't connect emotionally to it all. But on the other hand you don't want to be so slow and move the plot at snail's pace, so the viewers might get bored and impatient for something to happen. It also depends if you binge watch a fully released season or if you have to wait a week between episodes."
television,ff3kj12,t3_erfome,1579542997.0,"Season 3 was much better than season 2. They reduced the weirdness a bit again. Season 2 had too much of it without a good reason for it. Season 1 is still the best though, because most of the weirdness had a good explanation and the storyline about David and everyone else figuring out what was going on with him was the most interesting part."

Spike was initially a really good guy who was turned evil completely against his will and then became good again despite his nature as a vampire whose instincts make them bad. So I guess it is understandable in his case that people don't mind his redemption. He never really made a choice to be evil in the first place. He was a victim himself with no freedom of choice. Considering how few vampires there are in Buffy who turned good somehow, his moral improvement is also really remarkable in his case and a huge achievement."

television,fds6z9b,t1_fdqiw0y,1578695761.0,"Nancy Drew and whatever ""ghost hunter"" show you are talking about (haven't heard of that one yet) were greenlit more recently. Wayward Sisters was already dead by then. I just think that they wanted more variety in new shows starting in the 2018/2019 fall season to give each one a good starting point and of course they can't greenlit an unlimited amount of shows each year. Some ideas are made into a show, some not. 

I guess the timing and circumstances were just against Wayward Sisters unfortunately. When it comes to supernatural shows they obviously prefered Charmed and Legacies that year. Legacies gets currently good ratings by CW standards. Not as good as Supernatural, but it is one of their middle shows ratings wise. Charmed has currently one of the worst ratings of CW shows though and that was their first choice out of Charmed, Legacies and Wayward Sisters, because of its big name. In hindsight I think they would have been happier with a Legacies and Wayward Sisters combo. I bet Waywards Sisters would have gotten better ratings than Charmed and maybe also better ones than Legacies.

Now I hope that they will one day try another time to make a Supernatural spin-off. At least there won't be any concerns anymore that the mother show could get hurt by it in some way. The CW makes so, so many spin-offs, so I am confident that they will try again with Supernatural, which is one of the most successful shows the channel ever aired."

Personally I would be surprised if Kara doesn't get together with William Dey sooner or later. I just don't see any other purpose for introducing his character. They could have told the Leviathan/Andrea Rojas storyline easily without him. So there must be another reason for him being a main character on the show and the only one I can think of is him being Kara's new love interest. 

When it comes to the media talking about Supercorp, it is in my opinion simply because they know there are a bunch of Supercorp shippers out there and they want clicks and attention. I mean they likely wouldn't mind Supercorp becoming reality, but they would write about all kinds of other fanon ships, too, if they would have a lot of shippers. So it doesn't mean much."

There might be more under clouds, but those are the toy stores I see at the moment. 

I looked though it a few times and I am quite sure now that those numbers are right. With 9 level 1 toy stores you can create 3 level 2 toy stores. Overall you need only 5 of them if you do a 5 merge to create 2 level 3 toy stores. So one level 2 store can be deleted."
MergeDragons,fcyx0lc,t3_ejkrr8,1578088939.0,"I looked at all the harvestable items on the board and I think you can still get that giant toy store level 6 when you delete one level 2 toy store. It seems there are enough level 1 toy stores to compensate the deletion of one level 2 store. Can someone confirm this though? Not that I made a mistake. I don't want to do something I might regret later, but that level 2 store on the first big island is really annoying me and is distracting the dragons."

> As such, “AJ and the Queen” is likely to appeal to the group he says is his core audience: not urban gay men, but “smart, 13-year-old suburban girls.” This demographic is wary of joining “the assembly line of synthetic femininity” and understands, on a gut level, that drag mocks this performance — the big lips, the fake boobs. “I see how ridiculous it is. I’m going to align myself with other people who also see how ridiculous it is. Drag offers us the ability to mock identity and flip our middle fingers up at the sexual hierarchy that has shunned us. Hoo! Can I get an amen?”

So he himself thinks he caricature certain kinds of women, make fun of women following certain beauty standards to the extreme. He thinks that drag queens look ridiculous and fake and they put on those clothes and the make up to anger people who don't like gay men. 

> “I think little girls my age look up to him,” says Izzy G., 11, who communicates with RuPaul over text and Facetime. “For me, when he’s in drag he represents a strong, independent, amazing woman.”

And this little girl on the other hand thinks he in drag represents admirable women. 

Maybe someone should tell her that his goal wearing drag is not to be a role model for little girls. He doesn't admire the kind of women drag queens represent. He ridicules them, because he thinks they are fake and synthetic. The less stereotypical female a woman looks and acts, the more likely ge respects her. Profused stereotypical feminity is in his eyes not a good thing. He just wants to make gay men more visible and that is it. He is definitely not a role model for girls and women. The opposite is closer to the truth as he is portraying putting on heavy make up, outlandish clothes, etc. as something bad when a woman does it and not a gay man."

See here specifically. You felt the need to defend yourself, although I was only talking about the older downvoters who I said were likely a lost cause. I was clearly not talking about older guys in general just the ones who felt this thread deserves a downvote, because outside of sexism I can't think of a reason for downvoting the article and thread.

And I definitely think there are way more than 5 super talented female directors out there, some who have the same ability to make high grossing movies as the 107 male directors. Especially as a bunch of those high grossing movies didn't really make their income thanks to some super great directing. Some movies would even gross quite a lot with a bad director, simply because they are part of a popular franchise. You always assume that more female directors would mean a lower standard. I think there would be no noticeable difference in the quality of movies. And considering the amount of young women in film schools the female talent pool will even get bigger over time, but even today there are already clearly more than 5 great female directors who should get a chance."

So I suspect there might be something in the game which determines what Kala asks for which makes sense as a new player won't have any high level items yet and I don't think the game makers programmed the game in a way that Kala asks for impossible things. 

So does someone know what it depends on? Does it matter how much dragon power you have? How many fields in the camp are cleared? How many stars you have collected? How many wonders you got? How many high level items are in your camp? And if it makes a difference if you have your wonders and high level items bubbled? I have most things bubbled and I wonder if that might be the reason why Kala asks me all the time for small stuff."
television,fct2ajh,t1_fcsoiss,1577931021.0,"In the context of the series it makes sense. She came to Earth about 10 years before we first saw her in season 1 and she was a kid when she arrived and then lived for years with a human family. By the time we first meet her she has already acclimated to Earth. Though of course she still should mention Krypton, her native culture and science more than she does in the series. But overall I can understand why Kara is the real person in the series.

It is a missed opportunity though. They turned Supergirl practically into a female Superman. In season 1 she was at least not a journalist yet, but even that changed. The biggest difference between her and Superman was always that she remembers Krypton and a lot of storylines about her weren't so far after she arrived on Earth. They should have used a different premise for Supergirl. Start the series with her arrival on Earth and then no time jump. How she deals with the lost of her home planet and being stranded on a primitive Earth where she suddenly has super powers. She should feel really alien and should look on humans and their society from an outsider point of view. I like the CW Supergirl series, but a series like I described would have been much better and would have done the character a bigger favor than turning her so much into a Superman copy."

Not to mention when you let your cat outside tons of other animals will suffer because of it. Among them some rare ones, because cats really enjoy torturing and massacring other animals. 

https://theoatmeal.com/comics/cats_actually_kill

https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/01/29/cats-wild-birds-mammals-study/1873871/

> Cats that live in the wild or indoor pets allowed to roam outdoors kill from 1.4 billion to as many as 3.7 billion birds in the continental U.S. each year...      
> The study also says that from 6.9 billion to as many as 20.7 billion mammals — mainly mice, shrews, rabbits and voles — are killed by cats annually in the contiguous 48 states.

And they kill reptiles, butterflies, etc., too. 

I think if you keep a cat inside the overall suffering of animals will be much smaller. And by the way your cat also can't get killed by a car, hurt in other ways, get stolen or run away. A cat might have more fun if it can go outside, but overall I would say the pros for keeping a cat indoor clearly outweigh the cons."

For me it is more that you identify with a character, because you might be similar in some way to that character or you have experienced something similar to that character. So more like the people OP criticized define it. 

The difference to them though is that I don't come to this conclusion:
> ""unrelatable"" and therefore unenjoyable

I have no problem with liking and rooting for characters who are nothing like me. Who have a different gender, are much younger or older, have a different ethnicity, sexual orientation, etc. and who experience things and problems I will never face in my life. Good writing will make me care about them, even if I don't identify with them on a personal level."
