EpicSeven,ffhqlic,t1_ffhqgnc,1579948668.0,"Maybe, but I consider quitting this game sometimes because of the tedious and monotonous grind involved with getting good gear. Saving us an extra minute from every battle isn't some fucking malevolent gesture that would suddenly change the game overnight."
EpicSeven,ffho4kz,t1_ffh75bw,1579944853.0,I hate stall teams the most I believe.  Too many times I've had battles where I've won but the enemy Angelica has healed herself half a million damage.  The most annoying Soul Weavers have very low CD skills so now I either bring SSB or Luna with Joker but even then sometimes it's just impossible when she's healing for 7-8k every two turns and getting CR pushed.

War Thunder is much worse though.  On certain maps an entire team is at a disadvantage because they're facing the sun and in RB mode there's no tank outlines, you have to spot them visually."

nottheonion,ff5p8q3,t1_ff5n75d,1579604392.0,"Holy shit, are you thick?  The headline implies a generality while the article itself makes it very plain that his comment was a targeted insult.  Those people sitting around that table?  Not the majority of game developers in this country and certainly not the people that do the monotonous work.  He was talking to a million/billionaire which heavily implies a meeting with leadership who are generally not even developers themselves.  He insulted the CEO(OR OTHER LEADERSHIP), not the humble developer doing back-end work.

The level designer is not meeting with Joe fucking Biden, buddy."

Showerthoughts,ff4jsaj,t1_ff4654v,1579565315.0,The accent you generally see on TV is a Midwestern accent which is *slightly* different than people that live directly in the west. *Supposedly*. When I moved from the east coast to the west coast people told me I had an accent but I honestly thought that people in California and Oregon sound exactly like people from home in the UP of Michigan. Aside from pop vs soda there wasn't anything else I noticed that was different.
nottheonion,ff4ihnv,t1_ff4bbly,1579564415.0,I'm a Sanders fan and I'll definitely hold him to his comments. It's a very dumb and old fashioned way to think but I believe Bernie has more than enough talking points that I stand with him on that I can let something like this not phase my opinion of the man. He's very open minded and I'm certain were he more involved in the gaming sector he would come around. Biden on the other hand is just awful on most of his campaign talking points.
nottheonion,ff4i8ky,t1_ff40q34,1579564244.0,"I don't recall boasting about anything and what you've quoted doesn't have any effect on what I've said. Standard developers are not millionaires or billionaires and Biden is big enough to get an audience with a CEO which obviously leads me to believe he was targeting the leadership. Whether or not he was talking to one individual or the entire room is irrelevant because his comment was a reaction to someone bragging about making violent games.

We can't know for sure what is verbatim so I'm taking the article as face value and not projecting like you have done."
nottheonion,ff3q2mw,t3_ere6f9,1579546408.0,"Nobody here read the article. He was calling the CEO a creep because he boasted about making games that teach people how to kill. He was fairly mild about everything else.

I don't like Biden either but just reading the article title and then becoming upset enough rant and rave is how ""fake news"" spreads, especially with dipshit authors like the one for the piece using bait headlines."
aww,ff3nv7c,t1_ff37odj,1579545058.0,Definitely. If you do at least get some that are flat and take the effort of cutting them down to size. My unfortunate dog doesn't get any at all now after I had to stuff my hand down her throat to get it out.

WorldofTanks,fel4ep5,t1_fel2vhc,1579213821.0,"What I'm ""seriously"" telling you was that fighting a squad of 279e meant not having the time to fully aim my shots and that the E4 shell is heavy and has low velocity and isn't as accurate as you seem to believe it is.

WorldofTanks,fekwvaz,t1_fekwnr4,1579209267.0,Doesn't work so well in application and the derp nature of the E4 gun makes it worse. Facing 3 or them with my big ol tumor means no precise shots to be had.
WorldofTanks,feks0po,t1_fek9u6v,1579206402.0,If you have a 120mm gun or higher you can deal a lot of HE damage to their tracks. When I was in my E4 I was facing down three of them and didn't have the chance to really aim so I just started lobbing HE into that mess of tracks for an easy 500 to 700 damage.
