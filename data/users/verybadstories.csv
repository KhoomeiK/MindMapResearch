bulletjournal,fddkda9,t1_fddbw0y,1578315659.0,"Basically repeated layering of the colors at each edge, you kind of gently drag the ink into the next color."

bulletjournal,fdcym3o,t1_fdcigqj,1578288201.0,"I recommend it for sure, it's such a fun look. You have to be more careful about smears I've learned haha but you should look up other designs for black page journals - some who are much more artistic than I do some very impressive gradient drawings"
bulletjournal,fdcyfm2,t1_fdcx5y1,1578288038.0,"It took me a while haha I practiced on scratch paper for probably 30 minutes and then doing the whole border took maybe an hour and a half, if not 2. I think it helps that this journal has very thick paper (so it doesn't bleed) and the pens are gel so you can layer and relayer until it looks right."

AskReddit,fciw063,t3_eh8gs2,1577671148.0,"I haven't seen anyone mention it but... As a former everyday user, I developed an allergic reaction. You can develop an allergy to literally anything, even things you've used for years. So for me, it was marijuana. Interestingly only happens if I smoke but I break out in a crazy itchy rash, my eyes get watery and itchy, its awful."
marvelstudios,ezilmlj,t1_ezidx6e,1567929194.0,Not sure about the mixing realties part. Imo w/ Dr. Strange (even sans time stone) and all his mystic magic lol there could definitely be mixing reality in MCU future. Isn't his next solo movie literally going to be called multiverse of madness?
