AskReddit,fg4v1ak,t1_fg4tu7n,1580511720.0,This was one of the most interesting comments I've read recently.
AskReddit,fg48tto,t1_fg3nikh,1580498595.0,I kinda like the second one. Make it actually difficult to buy expensive shit. I'd like to add one thing: the person making the purchase must bring in the currency by hand. Good luck buying that yacht or mansion.

facepalm,ff5vxr6,t1_ff5tph4,1579612071.0,Junior CEO. Everyone who wants to be a CEO needs to do the job for the first time in their lives at least once. You can't always have experienced workers.
facepalm,ff5pqfn,t1_ff5pdru,1579605096.0,Or somewhere in between. I don't see why it should be black or white.
facepalm,ff5pbfj,t1_ff5jmzm,1579604501.0,It's not about what's between their legs but about giving non-experienced people a chance. Some times you gotta hire for junior positions.

explainlikeimfive,fekcxjo,t3_epjfbc,1579197430.0,The answer is in your question. They understand the half-life of any particular isotope by studying the half-lives of all isotopes. They see the general trend and from that they can find the exceptions.
Futurology,fek5w3o,t1_fejytxf,1579193264.0,"While I think you're right and I don't know much about smartphones, I don't think many manufacturers are making micro-USB phones any more. Besides, all the new Android phones have USB-C, so it's just a matter of time until the old ones die out. And if it wasn't for audio, USB-C would be perfect for a long time."

todayilearned,fedphns,t1_fed2v9f,1579017068.0,"It could be that life is rare and it appeared on Earth or maybe it's so common that it came from space and there are plenty of space rocks full of it (we just haven't found one yet or we haven't realized it was a precursor to life) and it could be that life is so common that it appeared on Earth before it got the chance to fall from the sky.

I think the last one is true. We still don't know with certainty whether or not there is other life in our solar system. We know that water helps A LOT, so who knows what secrets Europa holds under its ice?"

todayilearned,fdh4996,t1_fdgsf06,1578415049.0,Then you'll be glad to know that we're at over 100 million transistors per **square millimeter**.
todayilearned,fdg82l6,t1_fdg6t2x,1578383964.0,"Well, a CPU has over a billion, a GPU has like 10 billion and SSDs have a few hundred billion... You do the math.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor_count

>In terms of the total number of transistors in existence, it has been estimated that a total of 13 sextillion (1.3 × 1022) MOSFETs have been manufactured worldwide between 1960 and 2018, accounting for at least 99.9% of all transistors. This makes the MOSFET the most widely manufactured device in history.

That's about 13 trillion billion transistors ever made. Or 10 trillion per second for 1 billion seconds (~30 years)."
webdev,fde0txi,t3_eks8uh,1578328623.0,"Because the same route can have different verbs. You can have a `GET /user/profile` route on the **back-end** which returns the currently logged in user's profile as a JSON, and you can have a `PUT /user/profile` route on the **back-end** which updates he profile of the currently logged in user with data from the request JSON body.

In express you do:

    /* To handle a profile get request on the back-end: */
    app.get('/user/profile', (req, res) => res.json({ name: ""John Doe"", age: 30 }));
    
    /* To handle a profile update request on the back-end: */
    app.put('/user/profile', (req) => Profiles.updateById(req.session.userId, req.body));

Then, on the **front-end**, you call `GET /user/profile` to display the user's profile information, and when the user edits their profile and saves it, you do a `PUT /user/profile` with the data to be updated in the database.

In React you do:

    /* To get profile from back-end: */
    const profile = await fetch('/user/profile');
    
    /* To send a profile update to the back-end: */
    await fetch('/user/profile', {
      method: 'PUT',
      body: JSON.stringify(profileToUpdate),
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
    });

Look up REST and CRUD."
