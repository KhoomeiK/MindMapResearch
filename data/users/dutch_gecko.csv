As an answer to your actual question: I've not done something like this before, but I would try doing something using systemd instead of cron. Using

    Wants=network-online.target
    After=network-online.target

In a unit file would allow the service to (re)start after every network change.

An alternative that I saw [on the Arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/WireGuard#Endpoint_with_changing_IP) is to use a cron script or systemd timer that regularly refreshes the DNS to test if the correct endpoint is still being used. I'm not sure what you mean with ""Crappy DNS setup"" but this could be enough to resolve the problem.

'n' refers to the length of the input to the algorithm. It's not really a number, but it is helpful to consider it as being really frickin' big. If the length of the input were to become bigger, say n+1, how much longer would the algorithm take ***relative to an input of length n?*** This is what big O notation tries to encapsulate.

It is useful to know what the big O for an algorithm is, as this lets us reason about how the algorithm will perform as our input grows. As an example, lets imagine an algorithm performs in O(2^n ). This is an algorithm which grows in exponential time, which is generally bad news. It could be, however, that in our case we only feed it an input with length 100, and this performs acceptably, so we can deal with having an inefficient algorithm in our code. But, if the boss shows up at my desk and says, ""Hey, we're going to have to crunch more numbers, can we do 200?"" I'd have to tell him no, as it's almost certain the algorithm won't be able to complete its work in a useful amount of time.

What the address of the server is depends on a few things, so here are a few examples:

* A server in a datacentre (usually) has a single IP address, which is ""public"". Any device that is connected to the internet can connect to that server using that address. The address can be accessed using tools like `ifconfig`. Often, such a server is also given a domain name using DNS, so that humans can access the server with an address consisting of easy to remember words, rather than a number, like `example.com`. (You can use a domain name as an endpoint in Wireguard too)
* An ""internal server"" is a server that is present on a private network, and is not accessible from the internet. An example could be a DNS server at a company's office, which can give easy to remember names to all the computers on site. It also usually has one IP address, which will be from one of the internal ranges I mentioned in an earlier comment. Again, that address can be checked with `ifconfig`. Computers on the network would use that address to connect. Computers on the internet cannot access that server.
* ""Home servers"" (and similar setups) where a computer is located on a private network, but needs to also be accessible from the internet. That computer still has one IP address, and it is internal. Computers at home can access it via that address, but computers on the internet cannot. Instead, the home router must be configured with port forwarding to pass connections from the internet to the server. The router has a separate, public IP that is available from the internet. Devices on the internet must connect to that address in order to get through to the server. The public address is not available via `ifconfig` on the server, but is usually available from the router's interface. Another option is to run `curl http://icanhazip.com` on the server, which will give you the address that the outside world sees connections from the server coming from and is almost always the address you want.

Basically, I don't know what your setup is, so have some material to learn from (:

If you are connecting to your server with SSH, the address you are SSHing to will be the address you want to fill in as the Endpoint for Wireguard. Your VPN client needs to know where on the network or internet your server is hanging out: its IP address."
programming,fcimhi5,t1_fci3oog,1577665037.0,"The API solution to these types of problems is for the API host to provide a single-use code that must be in the request to do the ""dangerous"" thing. If the call is repeated with the exact same code, you can conclude that the request is an accidental repeat and can be discarded (or as other commenters are pointing out, respond with suitable reply to indicate the command was previously carried out and further requests are futile).

> So would it be possible to theoretically use PIA as well as connect to my Wireguard VPN at the same time?

Yes in theory. You need to set this up in the client configuration by adjusting the `AllowedIPs` setting. Change it so that it only contains the IP address ranges that you want to go through the wireguard tunnel. I'm not 100% sure if this will work in combination with PIA, you may need to change something for their configuration too (I don't know how their config works, sorry!).

> and do I need to set wg0's IP on the server, or is it set when I run `wg-quick up wg0.conf`?

Do you mean the `Endpoint`? This is the public address of your server, you must set it in the configuration of the client. Your server already has (or should already have) a public IP address. It is, for example, the address that you SSH into. Your client needs to know that address otherwise it doesn't know where it should be making your Wireguard connection to.

If you mean the ""internal"" address that your server has inside the VPN, this should indeed be set in the server configuration, using the `Address` setting. It must be in the same subnet as the configured IP for every peer, and must be on a different subnet from its ""real"" IP address(es)."

TCP isn't even robust enough to prevent corruption, never mind preventing connection errors. You could use some protocol over HTTP that provides extra integrity, but at that point why not just make your API robust?"

WireGuard,fcdsbud,t3_egvil8,1577613159.0,"1. The endpoint is the publicly available IP address of the wireguard server you want to connect to. It is not related to the IP address of the client.
2. There are three private ranges of IP addresses: 10.x.x.x, 172.16.x.x, and 192.168.x.x. The differences between them is in how the *subnets* are split up. 10.x.x.x is /8, which means that every device in a private network with an IP address in that range should be able to connect directly to one another. 172.16.x.x is /16, so the same rule applies, but note that there are two octets (numbers between periods) filled in now. The total range is smaller. 192.168.x.x is /24, so each range is only as large as the last octet. 193.168.0.x and 192.168.1.x are different networks. I would recommend using a 192.168.x.x range for wireguard, as it is less likely to clash with a local network that a device might be using. /32 btw means that the given address is a single address and not a range.
3. `wg0.conf` is the server's configuration, it should not be present on the client.
4. As above. For reference, there is a command line tool to generate QR codes in `apt`, but I don't remember its name.
5. Nope. Public/private key authorization is considered highly secure, but do keep your private keys private."
