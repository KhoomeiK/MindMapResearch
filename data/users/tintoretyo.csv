TikTokCringe,ffc4rt3,t1_ffba3y1,1579791509.0,"That’s a false equivalency. They person you’re responding to was not at all implying fat people don’t have personalities or healthy functioning relationships. Nor were they saying people can only be dated for one thing.

Fetishisation is wholly different to just dating a fat person or being attracted to fat people. Fetishisation is a sexual fixation on something. Note: that’s something and not someone. Attraction is liking and taking interest in someone. That can be physical, emotional, sexual etc. No one is saying these things can’t overlap; that the object of your fetishisation can’t also belong to someone you’re attracted to. But the person you’re responding to was not saying that’s unhealthy. They were saying it’s unhealthy to be with someone specifically because of a fetish. Especially one like this.

Something worrying with fat fetishisation would be a desire to change people to meet your sexual fixation: the [wiki ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_fetishism) says that might be a bigger part of this particular fetishisation than you expect. That’s an issue because it’s a life altering thing that can have repercussions in a number of ways. People can be fat for a number of reasons and I don’t think badly of anyone for it. But if you’re gaining weight to please someone else’s sexual desires it’s not great... and definitely not healthy. There are documentaries out there about feeders where you could learn more but they might search for people on the extreme end so grain of salt, yeah?"

blursedimages,ffbq7g4,t3_eslo6g,1579778223.0,"When I was younger I was kicked out of home and I asked my mum to just leave me alone and blocked her number except she didn’t, she then started turning up at my workplace to say “hi.” It wasn’t to apologise or make things right; she just liked to pretend nothing was happening and everything was fine.  While I’m living in a shelter. And every damn time I would start breaking down while working checkouts and serving customers. And they would just very awkwardly be there like oh yeah... I have my own bags... no, I don’t have a card to scan. Probably questioning my sanity as my demeanour completely changes with a casual hello from someone walking past. Lots of the time I’d put my light on and ring the bell for help but if a supervisor was busy and I was serving someone I kind of have to finish serving before I can go to the bathroom and calm down. I also can’t just leave without letting them know where I’m going. No one was ever mean about it, it was just sooooo embarrassing.

Honestly, it’s awkward as fuck and definitely good policy not to cry while you’re working. I mean I know it’s just a joke but damn if that experience wasn’t awful enough to share."
blursedimages,ffbpzky,t1_ffbll0m,1579777920.0,"The one time I didn’t thank the bus driver was late last year. I think it was because the first bus was 10 minutes early so I missed it. Then he was 10 minutes late (it was an empty bus and traffic was light). He then proceeded to sit and wait at two other empty bus stops for 5 minutes each, one directly after the other. So I was then late for a connecting train which added another 40 minutes wait time for the next one on a 40 degree day. And on top of that he would take off speeding while people were getting to their seats and force them to stumble.

I still felt guilty and petty for not giving him a wave and a thank you. It god damn he was bad at his job.

Edit: by people I mean me. And I also remembered what set me off most was in the city there was a stop where heaps of people got on (I was getting off on the next stop) and there was a woman running up trying to get on the bus and he closed the doors when she was veeeerry close and waving and went off without her.

justneckbeardthings,ffaucko,t1_fface4w,1579744685.0,"I think people get really caught up hating the looks and appearance of neck beard stereotypes on here instead of realising it’s more about a mentality. I’m not the biggest fan when they just post photo of some random person who happens to be fat or have a bad beard and then start bullying them when they’ve done literally nothing we’re aware of. Seems more like it’s used as an ego boost for insecure people then, and it gets pretty nasty. Like memes about stereotypes are one thing; finding a random person you know nothing about and bullying them about their looks (and getting large groups to) is just shite.

Also am all about people expressing themselves through their style. I think it’s pretty wonderful we’re able to do that. Maybe cause I’m slightly outlandish with my own style - I think to me it’s about artistry and it gets pretty fun. I just don’t understand why people care what others wear to the point of getting angry unless it’s something genuinely hateful or derogatory, it shouldn’t matter too much."

justneckbeardthings,ffaqmab,t1_ffa8jti,1579742197.0,"I follow quite a few people who wear vintage clothing as their regular daywear and they pull them off just fine. I think the bigger issue is popular fashion and most individual style has moved on from when they were a common accessory, and when they looked good with a lot of clothing because of this. Some people might make it work outside of suits but it just does not suit jeans and a t-shirt with whatever blazer 3 sizes too big that you manage to find in a thrift store.

Definitely doesn’t make you cool but expressing yourself through style is pretty neat. When it works, it works.

Talking about the fedora here, not the trilby; that looks like a weird iteration of the hat from the Robin Hood Disney cartoon. I haven’t seen people wear those outside stereotypes and a very bad period of fashion in the late 90s - early 2000s."
PublicFreakout,ffadozv,t1_ffa00zd,1579733132.0,"I feel like that’s not a worldwide truth. 

It’s possible being assaulted (however deserved) and publicly humiliated and shamed, not just in person but now online as well, might cause him to lash out towards others who are less capable of protecting themselves or in quieter scenarios. It’s like that stereotypical story we see: where the kid in school is a big bully and it’s because his father bullies him at home. People can and do pass on those negative emotions to others in unhealthy ways. You just might not see it.

I’m not saying they will, but one person getting small after being confronted by many people does not mean his attitude has changed in the slightest. Some people learn with tough love, some people don’t. My mum always says when someone is nasty to her she gets motivated to prove them wrong; when someone is nasty to me I internalise it and lose motivation. People are just different and they deal with things differently. If this person is already a bully to defenceless, will that change with a beating? Maybe? It’s definitely another stereotypical story we see all the time. Feels weird to want that though. Also doesn’t address the underlying issues that may be causing lashing out; it either makes them afraid of your violence or opens their eyes to the pain they have been inflicting. Not a gamble I’d make lightly.

Also people aren’t afraid of using violence, it just should not be the go to solution for problems that can be solved in other ways. Violence shouldn’t be easy and it shouldn’t be fun. It also can escalate things drastically - I’ve used violence to defend myself against a threat and it only escalated from there and I had to use more violence to even survive the scenario that I created. And it likely wouldn’t have gone that far, at that time, if I hadn’t seen danger and felt like it was my only defence. This person had been violent with me in the past which is why I wanted to beat them to the punch and it was awful, it also didn’t stop their abusive  behaviour. It just meant they could justify what they did to themselves and others. Maybe I just didn’t give a strong enough beating? Am I supposed to get a gang of men to beat up bad guys? Or do I do it myself? Does that make me the bully? Or my gang the bully? When do we cross that line? Confusing stuff tbh. But if the military are volunteering to beat up people, I know a guy."

criticalrole,ff8mlhq,t3_erc913,1579686043.0,"The only reason I dislike the idea that it’s the same woman for all/most is just how pre-ordained it makes their meeting and destinies feel. There’s already a lot of those coincidences showing up in fun ways like Fjord and Cads stories intertwining. Having the same woman come through each of their lives and touching them in some way before they met makes the world feel too small and their freedom almost non-existent. 

I like that it was a bunch of mistakes and coincidences bringing them most all of them together to meet in an inn and develop friendship and family from there.

Not saying it’s bad or uninteresting to theorise. I enjoy that or I would be reading threads like these. Just that eventuality is not to my taste. I hope it’s more seperate stories and motivations. Most I could see together is Beau and Nott. But even then, why did the witch want to transform Nott into a goblin in the first place? And why make it almost impossible to transform back? And  I don’t think we know all the nitty gritty of the deal with Beaus dad and I am so keen to find out more and explore her backstory sometime soon (I hope).

I think the motivations behind the characters and their choices are really interesting and I’d love to hear more about people thoughts on that. Especially the person who gave Caleb his memories back; who would do that and why? It’s a risky move for something with seemingly little payoff for them."
Anne,ff8eea3,t1_ff89nbn,1579674959.0,"Hey, it’s clear you’re very upset about peoples disagreement and dislike of the email you sent and posted on here. It’s also very clear you’re young. I don’t hold any of that against you but I think you ought to take a moment to breath and self reflect. You’re not a victim here. Disagreement is vital in communities, it’s important to learning. People felt your email did not reflect the thoughts of the community here, nor was it likely to illicit the change you desire. People took the time to let you know that. It’s not an attack on you, nor it it meant to make you feel unwelcome in a community you’re clearly passionate about. What you decide to do with those feelings is your prerogative but I can say with certainty you’re not unwelcome because of a silly email. No one is forcing you out, even if it may feel that way. You don’t have to force yourself out or even lash out because you feel rejected. 

I think it’s commendable that you are passionate about this show and that you want to make efforts in having it renewed. However, I do think it’s important to undertake these things in a reasonable manner. I think it’s important to be careful and considerate in how you speak with others where possible; especially when you’re asking them for something. Your best bet is taking a break, a breather, listening, and learning from the experience. I am sorry you felt hurt by the disagreement you met here but that doesn’t make it any less valid. Don’t double down on childish or entitled behaviour in response, don’t force yourself out. You don’t need to do that. And it won’t help you grow as a person."

Anne,ff7ns3z,t1_ff7maxt,1579653980.0,"Yeah I think the only reason that one is acceptable (in my opinion) is because it’s an incredibly loaded subject and needs time and care to handle appropriately. I don’t imagine it having a happy ending if we consider the history it’s based on. And I do feel they ended it as well as they could have; leaving the audience with uncertainty and a little hope. Feels poignant.

I’m also not against renewal or more seasons and hope  we do get some. I just think they wrapped it up very neatly and I was satisfied overall. But there’s more stories to tell based on those works, and definitely more they could build on from their own creation and I’d be happy to see them."
Anne,ff5kn15,t3_ernnpj,1579597438.0,"This is genuinely super cringe. 

I’m all for renewal and campaigning for it but this just comes across as incredibly entitled and childish.

Because honestly, I would just feel very awkward receiving messages like this and it wouldn’t motivate me to address the issue in whatever capacity I was able to. I’d just delete it and look into blocking your IP.

Also it’s a jerk move anyway; people might need help and your threat is to block up their complaints line? Like sure, that’s a viable option when campaigning for important change. But you’re mostly hurting customers who may need their help with that strategy and throwing a fit about a shows cancellation is not a worthy cause.

Also they pretty neatly wrapped up most of the plot threads so not even sure what you mean by that."

WatchPeopleDieInside,fel9h12,t1_fejfq6v,1579216979.0,"Er, not sure that isn’t a self deprecating joke answer.  

Of course there are people who believe those things or people who are socially awkward. But people complaining blow it way out of proportion. There were a *few* people saying the punches were weak and they most came across as more of an attempt at a bad joke. And maybe some people believed it but damn if the complaints aren’t very hyperbolic and the circle jerk that follows the same. It’s also the language used “people on reddit” well, here you are on reddit thinking the opposite so why are those you disagree with singled out to be ‘people on reddit’ then thrown into the stereotype of no friends losers who can’t take or make a joke?

Like I’m merely pointing out that you’re complaining about it on reddit, you’re also a person on reddit. And there’s really not that many people who truly thought he was punching weak. So was the entire point of that comment and the very many agreeing to feel better about yourself for being on the website or something?

dragonage,fdmiteu,t3_em531n,1578551448.0,"People watch streamers for their personality, right? I don’t feel like this would be a way to get people vested in your personality. It’s a game heavy with dialogue, so you’re either talking over it all time or pausing to discuss it; which will make things drag on a lot. Dialogue options are also one of the game features, and when you’re watching you don’t really have control over that, which isn’t very entertaining. The combat isn’t interesting enough, and doesn’t hold enough weight to draw people in. But I suppose that could be where you try to let your personality shine through. Problem is; I think you would kind of already need to have followers who are interested in you to do that successfully.

It’s also not the best audience because people who like dragon age have most likely played them all. And one of the biggest draws to playing them is making your own decisions, so it’s not likely anyone who hasn’t will want to watch streams religiously. At least, it’s not enough people to make it worth the investment of your time and money. It’s also probably not a good foundation of followers. 

It’s kind of just a big ask of people who have no reason to really watch you play the game. They don’t know you, or have an investment in your success. And it’s a long game that doesn’t have much excitement for an audience who isn’t making the decisions that impact the game in an interesting way (holding votes would not be the best solution). You would be expecting people who aren’t invested in you, who don’t have a connection to you, to watch 4 hour streams of you playing a game. And they won’t be able to just watch whenever because it’s story focused, so they would have to keep up. It’s just way too much to expect to really be successful with.  I think you need to think very rationally about these things if growth is your goal. What are you expecting or an audience? Is that enjoyable to them? And would you support someone doing the things that you decide to do?

However, the most important thing is just to stick with what you like because,honestly. It’s an over saturated market so you may as well enjoy what you’re doing. If that’s dragon age, do it! Who cares how many people will watch. If you’re focused on numbers and growth,  which your post makes me think is the goal, I don’t believe it to be the best choice.

I think people really enjoy those err, battleground games? Because there are stakes and it’s very fast paced. I don’t personally watch streams outside of critical role, which is very different to that genre. But I would assume the quick nature allows people to drop in and out and not feel completely lost. In addition to the stakes being high enough that there is suspense and a win is exciting for the audience. Which makes for an enjoyable watch, and is one of the reasons it’s such a successful genre of streamed gameplay."

But I’m happy they didn’t rush into it, even though it’s more likely than not we won’t see a 4th season. It would have been far too complex a situation to tackle well in just a few episodes. And I think something they always did very well in the show was pacing. So it makes me happy to know that even with cancellation, they didn’t sacrifice pacing to that extent and just left it open for us to imagine. Which, I think we all know, Anne would approve of. 

I’m actually relieved that Anne and Miss Stacy aren’t related though. I always feel like that runs to possibility of making the world feel too small and it’s such an unnecessary coincidence. Which you don’t want when all stories have to rely on some coincidence some of the time. I’m also not sure how much it would have added to either of their stories. I feel like Anne found a home and family, it was also very important for her to discover where she came from but she found peace knowing she was truly loved as a child; that she wasn’t abandoned intentionally.  I’m not sure where you would go with the story if the opposite were true. But I’m also just a sucker for happy endings.

Love your idea about seeing a contrast with Diana in finishing school and Anne at Queens. Though I suppose if there’s no hope for season four it’s the best outcome. I just wish there was more closure for Jerry. It felt like he was just a prop to her story. And he was, I think she almost tested the waters a little with him and found she wanted more than what was on offer for her, to the point she could stand up for herself. But, I dunno. I think they could and would have done a lot more were they given more time (and seasons) to explore the stories in.

I’m going to stop rambling now!"
mallninjashit,fdkr0f0,t3_elmosz,1578509345.0,"I don’t understand how people could look up to such petty, vindictive and childish behaviour. Or why he thinks it’s appropriate not only to act on it, but to publicly ‘brag’ about it. It’s so embarrassing."
WitchesVsPatriarchy,fdkpzgw,t1_fdjnw1u,1578508736.0,"I don’t know if you’re trying to imply I was saying the opposite is true. You came across aggressive towards me but fairly certain it’s just due to the entire situation being incredibly frustrating.

Either way, just wanted to clarify; I’m definitely not saying they did it out of the kindness of their hearts. Nor that the severity of the tragedy is not caused by their malicious incompetence. Was merely stating that they have pledged it and to say otherwise would be spreading misinformation."
criticalrole,fdhhgxt,t3_elfffe,1578422735.0,"That’s such a clever idea, and great execution as well!"
WitchesVsPatriarchy,fdhe915,t1_fdh61z0,1578420797.0,"Not strictly true. They have pledged 2 billion to get people back on their feet. 

Doesn’t excuse any of the bullshit. Just feel it’s important information to spread."
