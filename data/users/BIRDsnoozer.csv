How do you measure the emotions of other people without feeling them yourself? How can we properly measure the suffering, or remorse vader was feeling when he took off his mask, looked at luke with his own eyes and thought, ""shit... My life has been wasted on evil hatred and fear"" imagine doing an emotional/philisophical 180 like that after just having your insides broiled with force lightning and a few minutes left to live. Imagine the sense of urgency he must have felt and the disappointment in not being able to prove himself as a good man, a redeemed man, and the hero of his own personal journey and battle against the dark side. Anakin achieved enlightenment seconds before his biological and technological body shit the bed.

Anakin may have inhabited the same body as vader, but they are different people. They need to be judged separately. Vader was evil, vader was guilty. Anakin was sick, and had the power to keep away anything that would come close to curing him, until Luke bested vader, and essentially cured him.

People shit on the prequels, but they do a fairly good job of showing Anakin's journey and transformation into vader. Anakin was played like a fiddle, and made into vader. That essentially puts the blame for his atrocities on palpatine and everybody else who had a hand in it."

CasualConversation,feywkhw,t3_eqoo9f,1579451411.0,"I had a terrible time in highschool. I was not good at sports. I was smaller than the other kids. The girls didnt pay me attention. I was bullied. I was terrible at subjects that did not interest me (math and phys ed), and only good at the ones that interested me (art and tech)... I had some dark days where I thought about suicide, but my friends, and honestly music always pulled me out. Now it has been 20 years since I graduated highschool and I can tell you this.

Its very important for you to know this at your age:

Highschool is such bullshit. It does not matter at all. The things you do in highschool have almost no impact on your life even a few years after. I know it seems very important to you NOW, but it is not. At all.

Nobody cares about what grades you got in highschool. The **ONLY** lasting thing i have from highschool are the friends i made there.

Thats it.

Some people i knew that did well in highschool ended up failing at life... And other kids who did worse than me in highschool ended up succeeding. They have formed an idea of what success and happiness is, and crushed it, while those others had an idea of success forced upon them and found they were not happy within it.

In the near future you will find things that make you happy and the stresses you felt will honestly feel so laughably insignificant, that even thinking back on the failures and awkwardness and anxiety makes you feel... Good! Because they are all so hilariously insignificant on the scale of what your life is soon to become.

Hang in there and ride out the storm. I know it is a cliche thing to say, but it gets better. It does. It gets so much better that you will laugh.

And those people that are trying to tell you what success is, maybe are not worth pleasing. Aim to please only those people who love you no matter how hard you fail... That brother you mentioned sounds like a good candidate. If anything, live for him."
AskReddit,fev591n,t1_fetc836,1579393250.0,"Ok holy fuck, i have a story JUST LIKE THAT.

So when i was born, my mom took maternity leave of course, but when it ended, she sent me to stay at my aunts house to be looked after in the days so she and my dad could go to work. It was about 15 km northeast of my house, in a neighbourhood called rexdale (toronto people should know it). From age 1 to 4 i stayed there every weekday with my aunt and uncle and my 4 cousins... All my cousins were older and in school already, so i met neighbourhood kids and made friends with them.

There was one kid in particular that i remember the most. He was my ""best"" friend out of the neighbourhood kids. His name was Eric and he had red hair. I used to play with him and colour and watch batman (adam west) with him. Eric.

So then its time for me to go to kindergarten, i stop going to their house and I dont see them much until later in life. There was some family drama around one of our uncles, and the solution was sadly, to not get together as we did in the past, because everybody hated him, and our grandparents thought it was unfair to have big gatherings without him... but then he died, and the family gatherings were back on! Now im about 12 or 13, and i see them all again for the first time since i was like 4.

At a family gathering I ask them, nonchalantly, ""hey what ever happened to Eric?"" My cousins laughed and kinda brushed me off, ""Hah! Eric!"" I was like, ""yeah but how is he?""

And then my cousins AND my aunt were like, ""uh... Eric was your IMAGINARY friend!"" I was like, ""no... I knew even at that age what an imaginary friend was, and thought it was stupid... Eric was a real kid. He had red hair, and i would draw pictures with him at your dinner table.""

They were like, ""you would sit at the table and talk to nobody in the empty chair and call him eric...""

That was so fucked up. As a kid, as i said, i KNEW what an imaginary friend was, and thought it was bullshit. I REMEMBER what eric looked like. The most fucked up part is, i dont know what's scarier... Weather I made up Eric, against my own will, so to speak... Or if I did see eric, and nobody else did."

1) most notable is their charge/gore attack combo. If they run 10' towards a target and succeed on a gore (horns) attack (which is a ridiculous 2d8+4 piercing damage) they can ADD an extra 2d8 piercing AND the target must succeed a strength save or be pushed up to 10' AND be knocked prone.

2) they are hit point sponges with 9d10+18 hit points. If your opponent doesnt have a 2-handed bludgeoning weapon, theyre gonna have a bad time.

3) honestly, if I were your DM I would make you provide their greataxes yourself, which would provide a unique challenge for a scrawny lil necro...
