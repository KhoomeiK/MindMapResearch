Uhm... How about the fact that Claire's employees literally just watch a power point to be able to do piercings and the equipment they use cannot actually be sanitized. Disgusting.

If you want something, anything pierced, visit your local tattoo and piercing shop. They are trained, licensed, and certified to perform piercings.
