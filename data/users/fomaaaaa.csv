childfree,fciqssg,t3_ehbbov,1577667609.0,Having children doesn’t mean that the children will have anything to do with you after they leave the nest. Being married doesn’t mean you’ll have a happy marriage and companionship. You can have friends and other people in your life who aren’t bound to you by blood or legal documents.

When I see pregnant people, unless I know them personally and know that they want to be a mother, it gives me the willies to think that they could expel a living creature at any moment.

childfree,fc9nnr1,t1_fc9i650,1577555419.0,"If OP has the refusal documented in her medical records, gets unintentionally pregnant later, and dies, couldn’t that also fall back on the doctor for refusing to take a potentially life-saving measure? Doctors shouldn’t be under constant fear of litigation. It’s why there are consent forms to fill out before procedures."
childfree,fc9nacd,t3_egq8v1,1577555255.0,Let me get this straight. The doctor wanted to preserve your remaining tube in case you want to get pregnant later. After telling you that pregnancy is a likely fatal thing? The doctor somehow believed that you would be willing to risk your life for a pregnancy?
