No separate license for concealed carry, we are required by law to have  firearms covered or concealed when carrying them in public, so everybody carries concealed here.

Extract from the firearms control act
Any firearm, including a prohibited firearm (fully Automatic being a ""prohibited"" firearm), can be licensed as a collector However, the firearm must be one approved for collection by an accredited collectors association; the applicant must be a member of an accredited collectors association; and the license application must be accompanied by a sworn statement or solemn declaration from the chairperson of the association verifying the applicant’s membership.  The firearm must have an attribute of collectability that is of historical, cultural, artistic, technological, heritage, or scientific value

So you would go to a collectors association and join them,we have a couple of them with about 2000 members in the country. you join them through an interview process where you explain your interest and what themes you plan on collecting, ww2 for example.  then you join them as a Cat C member, you then take proof of this to the police and they approve you as a collector and issue you with the card in the middle of the picture. then you need to be a Cat C collector for three years (you can collect in the interim, just not semi auto stuff, pistols, bolt guns, shotguns, no limit) then after three years you ask your club again to approve you as Cat B. you go for another interview with the club and explain on how allowing you to collect semi auto firearms will help you expand your collection. then off to the police again, and they upgrade you to Cat B allowing you all of Cat C plus semi Auto stuff like AK's Galil's Fal's. and the same for Cat A, wait three years, apply again and off you go

My theme: (I went as wide as I could)
Theme: The various manufacturing methods and different metallurgical compositions used in the manufacturing of firearms from the age of black powder to the present day. Firearms (typically side arms & Rifles) associated with the Anglo-Zulu War, Boer wars WW1 & WW2, Korea, Rhodesia/Zimbabwe Bush War and our Border War as these are conflicts that are either specific to South Africa or in which our country’s armed forces were involved  

This type of license is issued for a ten-year term and may be renewed if the licensee is in compliance with all applicable requirements."

No, closest I come to safari's is when we shoot vervin monkeys. hunting in general is expensive and many farmers do charge like wounded buffalo... some will charge you per shot fired, hit or miss, then charge you for the animal, entrance to the farm, use of facilities, traveling there, accomodation it adds up quickly.

The only hunting here is done on farms, ""public land"" or state owned land is not open for hunting. if you hunt in any national park you run a very real risk of being shot by anti poaching units. hunting on military land is obviously also not a brilliant idea neither is hunting on community/tribal land.

Was so annoyed when this happened. If I recall it was in Pinetown, KZN, think the cops  left to draw money or stop by a shop, and these guys broke out.

At least could have kicked the door shut, or stomp their hands to keep them inside, maybe film it to use for evidence. but cheering and letting them get away like that... shows much about the Average South African"
LateStageCapitalism,feyvzce,t3_eqqtxk,1579451116.0,"This is often something I wonder about.

I am not a lazy person, and I also believe that one should have proper work ethic, regardless. you are there to do a job, so do it and do it well. but I am well aware many if not most companies will ""exploit it"" but it is almost like ""treat other as you wish to be treated"" type deal. the world will not work if everybody just slides by on the minimum amount of effort or tie their effort to a salary. then most every cop, soldier, nurse, teacher,sanitation worker,farm worker will bail... and then what? but also who wants to be taken advantage of?

But like I told my boss when we discussing unions and minimum wage  (he is not a fan, because in his opinion he is fare and non exploitive)  I say if done right they are both very good to have for the working class. no companie sits and has meetings where they plan and work towards paying everybody as much as possible

You are still young, and there is plenty of time left for you to be upset about girls still. just work on your communication and social skills and be a good person. takes time to realize, but having a relationship is no guarantee of happiness and you can certainly be A for away on your own (not saying you will die alone)

how you experience life is also largely based on the viewpoint you take. it is not always easy, but try and be thankful for that which you do have.

I am not sure if more people are unhappy and battling with relationships than in years past, or that we simply see more of it because of mass and social media.

I am sure there have been plenty of instances were people though the world is going to hell in handbag, 1914 and 1939 spring to mind. but it does feel like we are on the verge of a new type of growing unrest, not the same as world war, but people are battling on a personal level.

I know it is not cheap getting everything in place, and the costs, combined with waiting times can put many people off of it, especially younger guys.

But the best is to do in small chunks then, like eating a elephant. if you save up, you can get the competency out of the way in three month or so. and start the waiting on that.

Then you can shop around for saves, the price I gave will get one with two small shelves. but if you are only getting a single handgun, maybe go smaller still and save some cash there. and search on places like gumtree, I bought my rifle safe off of there for a R1000, same price as a small new one.

Then look at places like gunbroker, there can some killer deals on handguns below the R6,000.00 mark

Occasional sport licenses cost no more to apply for (R140.00) than a self defence one does, they are all the same. and you just need to be part of a club (they usually charge a yearly fee) which is not a bad idea regardless.

But feel free to contact me at any time now or in future, and I will try my best to lend you a hand where I can.

Let's get you armed so you have the tools you need to defend yourself.

And if you want to check out a South African firearm forum look at gunsite south africa. has its ups and downs and there are all sorts, but it can be a great place to pick up deals and meet like minded people closer in your aria which can help with clubs etc"
southafrica,fegq3fj,t1_fegg6xx,1579099868.0,"The state does not want anybody to have firearms... but it is not that bad, my M1 Garand was approved early December. bigger chance of issues on a semi auto rifle than anything else. so it's more luck of the draw. but you can appeal their decision if you want, or you can reapply 

Cost is hard to determine, but usually 
+-R1,500.00 for a comp
+R70.00 for application of compt at saps
+-R1,000.00 for a small handgun safe (get the biggest you can)
firearm depends on what you want, a cheap second hand pistol R5/6,000.00 or say R10,000 for something like a Glock/CZ/Beretta
Holster can be R100,00 cheapy or something ""better"" at about R1000.00+ a dude on FB artic wolf makes killer hand made leather holster for sub R1000.00

And then there is spare mags and all the other bits and pieces. say if you budget somewhere between 15 and 20K you should have everything you need and maybe even some change.

May I also suggest looking into an occasional sport license for your handgun. licenses last double that of self defence, and may be ""easier"" to motivate, but you will need to be part of club then, then you simply say the handgun is used for ""club shoots"" as long as the firearm is licensed it is suitable for any legal purpose... many have gone that route. all my firearms are on 10 year licenses, none on self defence yet I carry my pistol every day"

Write your tests and get your comp application in at your local DFO as soon as you can, in theory it should not be more than 90 working days for approval, and I think another 90 days for them to get your competency card printed and sent back to your DFO

I also suggest joining a club/range so you can at least get some shooting done as well, no need for a thousand rounds a week, but a couple times a year at least, so you know and are comfortable with your firearm"
