dontdeadopeninside,ffnnrvz,t1_ffn3r6e,1580068274.0,Yupp if people have eaten out then they’ve eaten far worse than op. I agree I haven’t met a single person who gets sick for leaving room temp food for a handful of hours... I work at a restaurant ( I’m not in charge of food I just see it happen) and not one person gets sick. We don’t have  weak ass stomachs lol.
ask,ffkc0wf,t1_ffk3c2i,1580020299.0,"No actually it’s the opposite, I feel good when I’m home, relaxed when I’m alone and no one bothers. Work school, errands etc. but it’s constant the I want to die. It sucks we live in this type of world, shits tough I can only help those that are with me, hope you get better- hope we all get better"
AskReddit,ffjz214,t3_eu1qqn,1580010893.0,"Does everyone feel depressed/suicidal? I see many memes and jokes but does everyone think about suicide multiple times a day?

To be clear I don’t really know how depression looks like I do know that I’m just tired, I think about suicide at least three times. I’m not sure if I’d actually want to die but I guess recently it’s been non stop. Like a screeching alarm just going on trough the day.

There’s been a lot of shit going on recently mainly just adding to work load and stress. I have school then work. Shitty sleep patterns and overall I just don’t have time to do anything I want, and it’s been like this for a while but I just tell my self “soon, soon I can rest”. But that day seems to be getting further, the more I need to say it, the further it gets.

Most people consider me a nice person a really good person to hang around with, very down to earth. Ofcourse I want and like to be that way, I try my best being there for other and helping them. This really means that I’ll put myself in their shoes and know that I wouldn’t want them to go trough judgment, bullying, made fun of, and just issues. I went trough that and it doesn’t take a genius to  realize that it makes a person feel like shit. Back to the reason of why I’m nice, I’m nice and try to reach out when people are in that ^ type of issue because I know what it is and I try to spare people from feeling what I felt. I wouldn’t want others to go trough what I did or will.

I’m taking a really hard short semester class in college, it’s usually a 4 month class that’s already intense as is, but now it’s only 1 month. This would be manageable if my a schedule was consistent. I work on the weekends, it’s busy but it’s at my max so I can handle it. I work with my mom at a family business so she had to leave for a family emergency a week or so after the semester so I was working every min I wasn’t in school. She actually had to leave again, another family emergency, but I’m getting really fucked my school, I’m staggering, and i can’t keep up. But what am I supposed to do?! I can’t complain her fucking family is dying, plus I always cover for everyone... yet I can never be covered. In fact I get shit on for it. I don’t get it, but again I can’t complain because her family is dying so I guess I’m just supposed to take it?

My family is always been something else but I’ve been noticing they’re just assholes. My brother is absolutely and asshole just a simple asshole, to everyone. My older brother is an idiot who doesn’t listen to people that give help, yet I’m still trying to give positive feedback. My mom she’s inconsiderate, literally I’m the only one she bothers for fucking everything, yet No one seems to be able or wanting to help me out whenever I can. Then when I finally start snapping they tell me to relax and i just get ignored  even when I’m trying to be respectful. And repeat.

I shout but no one listens

I try to be understanding. I try to be nice. I try to prevent others from feeling what I felt. I used to be ok with that, and I still think I am and it used to make me feel good- to help others and support them. But now it’s like it’s firing back mainly from my family, I help and whenever I say something I just get bitched at.

People ask and ask, hey can you do this? Can you cover my shift? Can you give me a ride? Can you? Can? You? I rarely ask for favors and it’s been a while but I do so much for my family I assume yeah I’ll ask if someone can cover my shift... yeah it was wrong of me to assume that someone can cover my shift. I was wrong because then they complain about me not wanting to work, wanting to replace me. They make me seem like if I’m not trying to work! Like if I’m quitting. I just want to work on my car sleep, play video games with the only friend I have online. I’ve tried talking to people but it would take me hours to get them to understand why and who I am. 

Why is it that people are soo full of shit? “Yeah you can talk to me?” “If you need a day off let me know” “hey mijo, I appreciate you”

Really let’s start if with the you can talk to me shit. Most of the people I know  are absolutely soo full of shit they just say that in hopes to show support but don’t actual want to hear you, like my family. You think that it’s be obvious from all the “I’m stress””I’m tired” I slept at 12 and woke up at 3l that I’m in fact crumbling and yet I still get shit on by them thinking I’m not trying to work?! It’s not that I don’t want to work, I don’t want to be replaced. I just want a break.

Showing emotions is for the weak atleast ya Mexican people are that way. People make fun of you, I try my hardest to get people to talk about it, I tell them they’re brave and I envy them... I wish I was them, to be able to talk about it. Suicide ? You’re crazy? Depression? Mental facility.  That’s another way I try to help others to avoid what I went trough. I try my hardest for others to talk to me about their pain knowing dam well I can’t do the same with them, others, or even my family.

There’s one person I could my gf. But I couldn’t possibly give her this ticking bomb of a  bag  I carry, I couldn’t- I can’t let her carry this so I’ll Keep it to myself, not that I don’t trust her I just know that she’s sensitive and I don’t want her to go trough any pain as others go trough, as I go trough

Soon you’ll have your time off, I’ll rest soon. Soon.soon.soon. I don’t really know if I believe that anymore. Why is everyday just getting heavier when it should have been getting easier?

What does depression look like? Is this it? Am I a walking symbol? Or am I just tired? I sure feel tired but I’ll go to sleep at 3am tonight just to wake up to work tomorrow and the school after that and repeat. Idk if I would actually want to die?  But whenever I think of suicide it’s a relief thinking yeah it really would be over, it really would be rest whenever I’d wanted to, I don’t have to wait for it... but once again I think of others, I know how deathly a loved one in a family looks like... I know what it feels like, do I want to be that cause of that? Does their pain outmatch mine?As of right now yes but I don’t know how much longer, soon?
