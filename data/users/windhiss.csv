And don't get me wrong, I used to be part of r/dark_humor when there was actually dark humor there. Now it's all about a bunch of idiots posting offensive stuff against minorities and saying it's funny. I mean, there's a rule ""Dont be a whiny faggot"". Thanks but no."

That hit me like a train. I know that feeling too well. I hope things work out for you."
TIHI,fgugxx2,t3_f0de5c,1581120534.0,"The feeling of helplessness seeing that comic... the world is sick, and even though many people, me include, are battling to prevent things like this to happen (and that's something I'm proud of my generation), it seems nothing changes, we're going nowhere :/"

I don't want to share animals suffering. I have animals and love them, and not in my dreams I want to spread this as a funny thing. I'm sorry for my misinterpretation on the video and for anyone that got offended (like I am right now feeling like a complete jerk)."

Don't like the post? Downvote and move on, your opinion isn't needed for me."

I believe there's nothing wrong with this cat, my cat have done something similar already and he's perfectly normal."
