Do you think you're entitled to being paid a working salary while you're moving? I've never heard of a company offer that. And that's usually because you're moving between companies so you're not getting paid in between. 

Ask them for unpaid leave if time is what you want to sort out logistics. But since it sounds like you've already agreed to last date at your old role and start date in your new one, you might be SOL. Again, should have been in your negotiation before accepting the new job."

The app is not too different from just using Google Maps in navigation mode. 

The only real benefit in the head-unit is that I get to auto-start it when I plug in. I know there's a bluetooth auto start as well but I've found that to be hit or miss or takes a while sometimes. Bigger screen is helpful too. and you can tuck your phone away so it isn't in direct heat especially on sunny summer days.

If you still value her friendship, even if it requires putting back together, you might want to address it head on. Taken from her perspective, she asked for help and you blew her off. Your ""Life happens doesn't it?"" is pretty passive aggressive in itself. You also state that you didn't want to get into all the reasons with this friend so she literally has no idea why you're being so standoff-ish. 

That being said, there's nothing wrong with choosing how you want to live your life, including saying no to anything. She might feel rejected and is lashing out.
