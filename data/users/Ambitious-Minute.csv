At one time society worked toward a greater good from a national point of view. If it was good for the country, it was good for society.

Now everyone is looking out for themselves.

Society mocks every institution that means anything in the interest of social justice. There is no discipline to start at the bottom and work your way up. Everyone has a degree and wants to start at the high end instead of working their way up.

Ontario is $360 Billion in debt. Canada has $ Trillion debt. The numbers keep growing. Health Care and Education are the reason we are so far in debt. If we don’t balance the costs of these, where do we cut costs? The third largest expense in Ontario is interest on the debt. This will only become a bigger number if we continue down this path.
