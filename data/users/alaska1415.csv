They don't know what they're doing and the economy has very little to anything to do with Trump or his policies.

>More opinion. Where did he ""reach across the aisle?"" 

To start off with, the ACA. The ACA's original form comes from a plan the Republicans themselves proposed in the 90s to hold off Clinton's healthcare expansion plan. The committee assigned to draft the ACA had an equal number of seats for each party and began from the Republican's template. They quickly said they would have no part in it. Exactly how much more did they need to be given, huh? 

>What people buy matters. The price impacts what people buy. 

Okay, I've adequately explained this point. Your inability to understand how a published price really tells you little to nothing given the vast differences in healthcare plans is no longer my responsibility.

>It's super basic economics so yeah. 

Really weird how everyone who says this doesn't actually understand economics.

>Medical need is not the only deciding factor for which drugs to use. There are different levels of care possible with different costs. There are drugs that do the same thing but observably better or faster than other drugs. 

Which would be decided by a doctor, not a person looking over a sheet who has no technical knowledge to make those decisions.

>Society can't afford to give cutting edge medical treatment to every citizen so it's impossible to provide medical care based on your idealistic ""need."" 

Never said everyone absolutely needed cutting edge treatments, but that should be up to a doctor to decide, not someone's pocketbook.

>I have 5 hospitals near me. Being able to compare their costs before an emergency helps me decide where to go. 

No, it doesn't. Not unless you have some inside knowledge of your insurance's preferred provider network and deals between your insurance and the hospital over certain treatments. Which I guarantee you don't have a knowledge of. Jesus, imagine knowing so little that you think you can compare healthcare options like you compare pear prices at a Kroger.

>You specifically said ambulances. 

Did I specifically say it was only those?

>You know nothing. 

Great rebuttal. 

>Those are apprehensions not illegal crossings. You're making my point for me. 

""That's total numbers of fires put out, not of fires total."" For real dude? Apprehensions go up because the number trying has gone up. Jesus.

>As I was getting out of the Army in 2016 they were talking about the need to shift resources to more conventional warfare as we've been focused on fighting insurrections. Trump is modernizing by increasing funding where we need it for more conventional warfare.

>Nope. Your logic is bad. 

Nope man, yours is.

>This is entirely your own opinion and has no basis in fact. 

No, it's a fact. Anything he ever tried to do, he got nothing from the other side. McConnell said as much when he said their goal was to make Obama a one term president. Obama reached across the aisle constantly. Just to pull back a stump.

>Being under the insurance company umbrella means that costs are shared. The cost of your ambulance ride is impacted by drug prices, doctors, specialists, hospitals, clinics, etc. 

Wow, how did you miss the point that people's insurance rates are so different that a ""published price"" means nothing? If X procedure costs A amount, but I have B insurance, while another person has C insurance, the published price means dick.

>Picking your brand of drug, specialist, doctor, or preferred hospital based on advertised price would put pressure on the industry to lower costs. 

HAHAHAHA!! What?! Are you serious? Wow.

1. You don't get to, and shouldn't for that matter, decide the brand of drug you're prescribed. Not to mention the sheer insanity of you thinking it's a leap forward to have people decide their medicine based on price instead of on need.

2. A lot of hospitals are owned by the same groups and people. Making that process opaquely transparent won't do shit.

>Most healthcare isn't critical emergency and ambulance rides. That's just a massive misrepresentation of the industry. 

I didn't say it was. But this is a huge part of the costs people are hit with.

>Won't be finished is different than not being built. The wall is being built. Considering that it and Trump's talks with Mexico have dramatically reduced illegal border crossing, and considering that Congress has approved funding for the wall, I would say that the wall will continue being built. Trump may win in 2020. 

Believe me, based on population trends, the fatigue he puts on moderate to lean Republican voters, his inability to reach beyond his base and the resistance he inspires will keep his chance of winning re-election at about 30%.

Thought I would get that out of the way first. Now.

Okay, I'll amend it to: ""it'll be a patchwork monstrosity eating up millions every year and accomplishing little to nothing.""

2018 and 2019 saw shit tons of border crossings, so what are you talking about: [Source](https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/sw-border-migration)

Congress did not approve funding for the wall, what are you talking about?

>I was in the military, I saw the shitty old equipment. Not every unit gets the same equipment or funding. 

Again, every president increases the budget of the military and modernizes a lot of it. Saying Trump has done so is completely missing the point. Might as well compliment him on waking up in the morning."
changemyview,fetr7gx,t1_fet3a63,1579378735.0,"538 did a good write up on this, but his historic unpopularity. Trump may not become more unpopular, but his ability to reach beyond his base is extremely low. 

More than that, he won by the skin of his teeth in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. Two of which jettisoned their Republican Governors in a mid term year. Not only that, his wins in those states could also be attributed to voter suppression, a tactic that Democrats are having a modicum off success getting over. 

It’s not unheard of, obviously, for a party that gets shellacked in the mid term to pull a win there next year, see Obama after 2010 and Clinton after 1994. But that we’re seeing even more states that were usually Republican come into play, such as Georgia and Texas, it doesn’t speak well to his chance of being re-elected. Name recognition is a big part of the incumbency advantage, but who hasn’t heard of Trump before now?

Hell, look at his response to Biden. He sees the writing on the wall well enough to violate the law to dig up dirt. 

Anything can happen, but Trump’s limited ability to reach beyond his base, the lack of a decades long smear campaign against Biden, historically Republican states coming into play and Trump’s inability to still act like he’s an “outsider who fights for the little guy” is not a good position to be in."
changemyview,fepux9k,t1_fepp2eq,1579332189.0,"> That doesn't diminish the fact that it's better. 

It quite literally does seeing as it JUST CAME OUT.

>Same thing as one.

Just as wrong as your last response.

>But it wasn't. Trump signed it and addressed prison reform. 

It wasn't because Republicans would do anything to deny Obama just about anything, while Democrats actually give a damn and are happy to pass good legislation whether or not the one in the executive branch is from their party or not.

>One of the big drivers of cost in healthcare are the anti-competitive practices. 

Wow, and having the prices be public will really help when the ambulance still brings me to the nearest hospital. Not to mention this is completely useless since prices are worked out between insurance companies and hospitals.

>The wall is being built and has been worked on for months. There's 100 miles or so done. There's nothing racist about border security. 

Again, won't be finished and construction will ultimately be stopped when Trump loses in 2020. And yes, building a useless wall is nothing more than a monument to ignorance and racism. Border security is just the useless ""reason"" you'd rather wrap it in.

>Many units in the military were using outdated equipment. They got better equipment. Improving the US military. 

Every president since Eisenhower or so has increased the military's budget. The equipment was never outdated. Jesus, imagine ACTUALLY thinking our military had shitty equipment.
