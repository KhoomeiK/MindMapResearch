90DayFiance,ffc8nq4,t1_ffb6cy0,1579794062.0,Agreed!! Spot on
90DayFiance,ffb4g67,t1_ffaut1x,1579751534.0,His beady eyes along with the fact he never smiles really gets to me. I‚Äôm rooting for Anny to get the green card and then run far far away. I‚Äôd love to see his reaction at that point. I loved how she stood up for herself at that dinner!
90DayFiance,ffb41ln,t1_ffazy2i,1579751236.0,I would definitely see a therapist to figure out all the root causes of this and how to undo them. Maybe a nutritionist to figure foods that work best for you and keep you full :) edit: intermittent fasting changed my life as far as weight loss
90DayFiance,ff8503q,t1_ff81p7n,1579666154.0,üòÇ soul crushing!
90DayFiance,ff6sts9,t3_erwpu9,1579634159.0,Lmao quality post. I cannot stand her greasy expressionless Botox bloated face
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fe9c5vb,t1_fe96ccg,1578936254.0,Exactly. Free and easy
MUAontheCheap,fe0c15j,t1_fe06p5w,1578809270.0,I use it on my whole face. Looks great and has spf :)
Instagramreality,fe0br7b,t1_fdzu34c,1578808988.0,It really is
socialanxiety,fdkp4gp,t3_elp28w,1578508223.0,"Once you realize social anxiety is a form of self obsession it helps... I don‚Äôt want to be so in my head and obsessed with myself. Takes practice and it took years to undo. Much easier said than done but it can be done :) focus on the outside as much as you can, as to not obsess with what‚Äôs going on inside"
90DayFiance,fdj7mf3,t1_fdj6tuk,1578460735.0,Lmaoo exactly
Cringetopia,fd7pfn6,t3_ejyf6o,1578208042.0,This physically hurt me to watch lol quality cringe content
socialanxiety,fd7nbbb,t1_fd5trsz,1578207113.0,Totally relate. People say something in the moment trying to be helpful but maybe he is going through something. It sucks but I‚Äôm proud of you for trying :)
socialanxiety,fd7m2t8,t3_ek97of,1578206573.0,I‚Äôve healed so much. When I was younger I was crippled and so shy with anxiety. Through getting jobs and pushing myself out of my comfort zone I got better. It took a long time. I had to take beta blockers and other times Xanax to help me jump out of that comfort zone but after that I didn‚Äôt need them. Trying new things even tho I was afraid is all that helped and also being ok with failing. At least I was learning

HaircareScience,fd5kd5h,t3_ejxb4i,1578178474.0,I do my own Brazilian keratin treatment. I buy it from amazon and it‚Äôs life changing
beauty,fd5jugo,t3_ejvqr9,1578178355.0,Ariana Grande - Cloud :)
femalehairadvice,fd3fecm,t3_ejruvn,1578157760.0,Go platinum blonde maybe!? I did and it‚Äôs a lot of fun
EUGENIACOONEY,fd3dngm,t1_fd3d0ij,1578157271.0,I wish someone would have her hospitalized again like Jaclyn did.... fuck why is her family so useless!!!
truechildfree,fd3dhqf,t1_fd2wnaq,1578157212.0,That and also birth looks absolutely horrifying to me
Instagramreality,fd2ok2o,t1_fd2np43,1578150148.0,Agreed
90DayFiance,fcneahs,t1_fcmf7i9,1577809918.0,Ah I didn‚Äôt see their whole story line. I still think they have no chemistry and it sucks she is tied to him for life lol
90DayFiance,fckfnzv,t3_ehj3vi,1577724274.0,We should all message Syringe on insta and beg him to not settle for her lol he needs an intervention
90DayFiance,fcjfb8d,t1_fcja2x3,1577685525.0,Same! I‚Äôd love to read OP‚Äôs take on Tim and others lol
90DayFiance,fcjexu6,t3_eh8nnu,1577685164.0,I like Tim‚Äôs commentary but I don‚Äôt care for Veronica. They needed someone to banter with him so they settled with her but she is a try hard and just so basic to me. (Basic is fine but on tv it‚Äôs a snooze fest) Go awayy Veronica
90DayFiance,fcjeu7b,t1_fcj7uqo,1577685067.0,He thought he liked her at first and he also really wanted to come to America I‚Äôm guessing. She‚Äôs turning out not to be worth it for him I think!
90DayFiance,fcjes4b,t1_fcj8ds9,1577685009.0,L‚ÄôOr√©al Voluminous for life ü§õ
90DayFiance,fcjeql0,t1_fcj8y80,1577684969.0,That hair with her skin tone looked just... beyond washed out. Poor girl is going through it rn
beauty,fcjed01,t3_ehf5df,1577684617.0,Michael Kors perfumes like Sparkling Blush and Sexy Amber. Ariana Grande‚Äôs ‚ÄúCloud‚Äù is my fav right now which pains me to say lol
90DayFiance,fcjdwf5,t1_fcjdbmp,1577684201.0,I don‚Äôt know much about the process so I suppose it‚Äôs wishful thinking lol
90DayFiance,fcjcs5i,t3_eh8prh,1577683230.0,I wonder if Michael can end up in the US or not. I think for his own safety/sanity that it‚Äôs best the whole thing falls through.
90DayFiance,fcjbxit,t1_fcjaiy9,1577682518.0,She just wanted so badly to have an excuse to leave the room
90DayFiance,fcjbw7j,t1_fcjb6nd,1577682488.0,Sasha and Emily have zero chemistry. I don‚Äôt understand their relationship at all except she must have some serious self esteem issues. To go across the world for THAT man??? I wouldn‚Äôt go across the street for him
femalehairadvice,fcgw22s,t3_eh8fa9,1577644521.0,I‚Äôd grow it long! It would be such an incredible mane üòç it is now as well tho!
iamverybadass,fcgvwma,t3_eh75i4,1577644462.0,This video gave me chest pain
awfuleyebrows,fcc65ci,t1_fcarg8f,1577594851.0,I love tightlining my eyes and then smudging underneath and up top very subtly with an angle brush that I run across the same eyeliner pencil. I use the urban decay 24/7 eyeliner and it stays put very well! Brown eyeshadows or brown eyeliners look nice with blue eyes. Warm colors like that make them pop :)
hygiene,fc460s4,t3_efwi9b,1577407559.0,After your braces you can try white strips and also use whitening mouth wash and crest optic white tooth paste :) maybe it‚Äôs overkill but it works for me
beauty,fc16xeg,t3_efgoiw,1577310000.0,Laila by Geir Ness is so lovely.
EUGENIACOONEY,fbz2v97,t1_fbx7r58,1577233425.0,Right. Where is she now? What is her stance? It‚Äôs sad that we even have to wonder
hamsters,fbjyi8g,t1_fbhtidt,1576942047.0,Take my poor man‚Äôs gold for that comment lol ü•á
