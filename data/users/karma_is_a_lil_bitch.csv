There were days where my professor would say I did an excellent job and ask me to take one of his classes in his absence to days where he would trash me to rock bottom in front of undergrad interns working with my prof. Sometimes I was fucking clueless what I was doing and some day I would walk out with an approval from IEEE publication. But that one day he called me Doctor was all worth it and was down to happy tears in his and my eyes.

Edit: Yes, I am an Electrical Engineer. I did my thesis on LAN Networks and was working on some R&D projects with NASA. I won‚Äôt be able to disclose my research work here but if you pm me with interests and ID I will consider discussing more details. Also yes it took 6 years for PhD and Honors

Edit2: It‚Äôs new years eve. Had really no plans. Was rampaging on comment sections. Unfortunately it was my cake day"
