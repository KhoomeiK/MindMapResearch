todayilearned,fecru7q,t1_fech31g,1578982216.0,"Holy fuck, you're a moron. Yup, northern BC is 'north' of a mountain range that runs from NNW to SSE. Congratulations on making the stupidest comment in this thread."
todayilearned,fecfnhc,t1_feces0u,1578972776.0,"Dude, my exception is that you literally wrote ""roads, towns, and infrastructure all over"". My problem is with the 'all over' part. It is NOT all over. There's quite a bit up in the Fort St John area, yes, but that's a very small part of the northern half of BC, and the VAST MAJORITY of the northern half of BC has very little in the way of ""roads, towns, and infrastructure"", and what amount there is of those things certainly isn't ""all over""."
todayilearned,fecdc73,t1_feccrx4,1578971242.0,"Dude, with this comment you're only proving how ignorant you are. Open up a freaking map and look at how close all those places you mentioned are to Fort St John. You're describing a relatively small part of northeastern BC that is only the way out is because it's BC's small extension of the flat expanses east of the Rockies. When you have that map open, look at how much of BC still lies north and west of all those places you mentioned.

Edit: wrote Fort Nelson when I meant Fort St John"
todayilearned,feccmqz,t1_fec8n8o,1578970805.0,"If I may, I'd like to jump in with my own answer to your question.

First off, quick background, I was born and raised up here but couldn't wait to get out, so moved away for school and lived for many years in larger urban centers, including Vancouver and Ottawa. I moved back to the area of BC I grew up in 7 years ago when I was around 32 years old.

I chose to move back because I missed the outdoors. The TRUE outdoors. Not 'outdoors' where you go out to hike or camp and are surrounded by fellow hikers and campers. I wanted to get back to where you could go hike, camp, fish, hunt and be the only person (or people, if you bring anyone along with you) within miles of where you are.

I also wanted the freedom to have land at affordable prices. I bought a house on 80 acres with a sizable, fertile garden in 2015 for under $300k Canadian dollars.

And despite the myths, it's not like it's perpetually winter here. As I write this it's crystal clear skies and about -20°C, but in the summer we regularly get temps in the 30s Celsius and everyone's at the local rivers and lakes in their boats and jetskis, etc. We actually have seasons here, warm springs, hot summers, cool falls, and cold winters.

I've traveled extensively and internationally overseas in my life so far, and there's still nowhere else on earth I'd rather live."
todayilearned,fecbhj1,t1_febvwqu,1578970153.0,"Dude, do you live anywhere near northern BC? Fully half of the geographical landmass of BC is north of the Highway 16 corridor, and there's only 2 highways that go into the north from that corridor, Highways 37 and 97. There are literally hundreds of thousands of square km in the northern half of BC that isn't ""roads, towns, and infrastructure all over"".

Source: I actually live in northern BC."

AskReddit,fdqrcfq,t1_fdqp9bs,1578673222.0,"Sure buddy. You want to know something? In my experience with people (and I've had a lot of that over the years), the ones that are guilty are the ones that most vociferously declare their innocence. The innocent ones let shit like that run like water off a duck's back."
AskReddit,fdqnpi8,t1_fdqjwjj,1578670955.0,Put your money where your mouth is and enlighten me as to what I wrote that suggests in any way that I don't know what I'm talking about.
AskReddit,fdqhn8e,t1_fdqh6sd,1578666900.0,"Christ almighty, you people are more dense than a neutron star.

How I would or would not react is completely irrelevant. I'm not a fucking judge. I would expect a judge, ANY judge (not just a Supreme Court nominee), to be able to keep their emotions in check and remain calm and level - headed under those circumstances. BK didn't, so he's unfit to serve in that capacity."
AskReddit,fdp9j0m,t1_fdp94ol,1578623159.0,"And you don't see the problem with that reasoning? Because I think it's pretty obvious. A Supreme Court Justice isn't just 'anyone'. Some people, in certain positions, should be held to a standard higher than the average 'anyone'. Would you want someone that can't regulate their emotions to be in a trench next to you? Or to be the cop pulling you over for speeding? I would think in those instances you would like someone very even-tempered to be the one in the trench with you or pulling you over. And cops and soldiers are a dime a dozen compared to Supreme Court Justices."

I could see people giving him the benefit of the doubt and all when it comes to the actual accusations, but I watched that entire testimony and his conduct, right there and then, showed he was unfit to serve in the capacity he was nominated for.

netflixwitcher,fcoxzz8,t1_fcmqv7l,1577844696.0,"To be totally honest, this is exactly me. I hadn't heard of the books (or the first 2 games) before Wild Hunt came out. Being the completionist that I am with gaming, I couldn't start TW3 without playing the first 2 games first. Then I started Wild Hunt and ordered the first 2 books. I finished Last Wish and was probably 2/3 of the way through Sword of Destiny when I finished TW3 and was kind of bummed about being done the game :D I put everything down when other stuff started to distract me and I've only come back now after this Netflix series came out. Read through Last Wish again to refresh, I'm halfway through Sword of Destiny again... and I ordered the boxed set of the first 3 books of the saga the moment I finished my first watch through of the series."
