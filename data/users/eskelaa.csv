Not sure if I used the right calculator but getting 2 vidar reactors in 2 runs is 0.16% chance. Here's the calculator screenshot: [https://i.imgur.com/Z0KYcr8.png](https://i.imgur.com/Z0KYcr8.png)

Getting 90 or more on avionics roll is 14% (roll range is 70, so 10 out of 70 is 14%). I could use 'exact' 93 roll but that wouldn't be functionally adequate, so allow me to make this tweak. 

The chances of getting exact 93 roll are 1.42% (also 1.42% for roll 94).

4% chance with 14% chance for drop and roll, combined together is 0.56% chance of both occuring.

The chance of two 0.56% events occuring is 0.0031% <- this is the chance of getting 2 vidar drops with +90 roll.

If I had used 1.42% roll chance with 4% drop chance, then the combined chance of both events occurring is 0.000032% <- this is the chance of something that exactly happened to you.

I'm not entirely convinced I calculated this correctly though, my gaming experience usually focuses about singular drop chances. :P I used [this calculator](http://www.calctool.org/CALC/math/probability/4_events) and [this calculator](http://www.calctool.org/CALC/math/probability/2_events) for the second part, I got [the same results](https://i.imgur.com/F08J8pP.png) regardless if I combined pairs of events together or calculated all 4 (which I expected, I think)."
Warframe,fehn6ua,t1_feh7zid,1579119946.0,">In 2020 Warframe - what is a mission reward for those everyday star-chart missions?

I never thought I'd be saying ""new currency"", but damn, here I go.

I want everyday mission currency that allows us to BUY things from the NPC. Things like bundles of resources (maybe excluding argon), but other mats like kuva, cryotic, mutagen samples, orokin cells, oxium. 

I thought Nightwave rewards would be that, but they are rotating (WHY?!) and not varied enough, and I have no incentive to run NW challenges once I complete 30 'ranks'... 

Captura scenes. Decorations.

Anything that doesn't have a real reason to be locked to certain place / game mode. 

Damn, reconsider if Khora bp really needs to be on 8th wave of Sanctuary... And Nidus too. Make it expensive, but available. If expected number is 13 runs to Rot C for 1 Nidus part, I'm more than happy to do double the equivalent in any other mission time. Maybe allow those drops as purchasable if Tenno does a certain threshold of those missions (NPC can say ""Yoo, I heard about those Nidus parts somewhere, but no clue where it is, find it for me and maybe I can sort out some deliveries to the shop"").

Ephemeras that you locked behind rng, despite early promises to be achievement-based.

It's time to stop forcing people to do mission modes they don't enjoy, allow them to do any mission in order to get their reward. Make those things expensive if need be, make them less efficient than 'original' mission would be. I'm happy to buy 1000 cryotic with the equivalent of 25 capture missions, as long as I don't have to set my foot on excavation mission.

Allow me to exchange my mission 'currency' for credits too. I won't feel the need to burn out doing Index whenever there's a credit bonus weekend.

Offer brown/blue mods. Smolts that get interested in builds are missing so many mods even around MR5 or so. For example, I didn't have Fever Strike until MR6 because I accidentally deleted the one I got. I didn't know about loot tables or trading with players at the time. Maybe offer some yellow mods but with higher price (I'm talking about Streamline, Continuity - mods to make basic build, not corrupted/dual-stat/etc).

In the same way platinum allows us to buy convenience (&save time), this mission currency is reverse, we would get goodies FOR our mission time.

If you really have to, then for balance purposes, I wouldn't mind if mission currency decayed a bit over time, but it would be nice to make a formula that doesn't hurt Tenno playing less regularly.

Mission level and type should definitely impact the amount of 'mission currency' as a reward.

I'd be a lot happier, just faffing about, doing things I like and not feeling like I'm completely wasting my time running Earth mission for shit and giggles with Smolts.

&#x200B;

Caches / spy vaults can reward additional mission currency, replacing all the shit loot like 500 Endo. Some rewards like rare mods on Eris cache, or chances for xiphos part bps should probably stay. I would feel the need to do caches and I wouldn't be as annoyed if some Tenno decided to hunt caches in the middle of regular pug sabotage.

&#x200B;

I'm sure writers can come up with plausible story why suddenly one NPC has all the stuff available. Maybe reconsider and convert some of the Cetus/Fortuna good that can be purchased with resources to be ALSO purchasable with mission credit (standing purchases stay without any change).

Warframe,feh13hx,t1_fegml3a,1579106934.0,"Not 'at least', this is exactly for 1 drop in 50 runs. That's the frequency of getting one drop, and 87% is far from 100% drop too.

The first time you run you have 4% chance to get drop. And each time you run, you have 4% chance, drop chance doesn't increase over time. Your probability of getting this 4% drop does increase with the number of runs. There is 4.7% chance that you will not get a single vidar reactor drop in 75 runs. For example, if 100 Tenno ran veil mission 75 times each, five Tenno will not get vidar reactor drop at all."

With 4% drop chance, your probability of getting 1 drop in 50 runs is 87%.

With 2% drop chance, your probability of getting 1 drop in 25 runs is 39%.

Initial Energy is custom for each frame. 

Free mod capacity is how many unused mod points your warframe currently has. 

Some frames have it quite low, with initial energy being 50. It makes sense to not put useless mods (like Steel Fiber lvl 2, just because you have 6 points), because if you leave 6 points unused, it will give you 6 points \* 5 = 30 energy extra to start with (50 + 30 = 80)."
