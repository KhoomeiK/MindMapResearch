Its weird and confusing stuff"
todayilearned,ff2klgh,t1_ff2h53u,1579510460.0,"You're correct about the cube. Speaking from my own experiences, if you say ""cube"" I don't visualize one. I certainly know what a cube is because I've seen them before, but I can't picture one in my head.

Honestly, I never thought about this being weird until I saw that reddit post that was mentioned above. Then I started talking to friends about their visualizations and realized it isn't the norm"
DestinyTheGame,feskwce,t1_fes026z,1579366286.0,"Not exactly. They still have some direct purchases for cash, but they also have items for r6 credits that can't be bought for renown. So, they've got everything"
sports,felg9jl,t1_fekr5pr,1579221471.0,"Fuck off with that bullshit. You have no actual reason to believe that, you're just making the guy into a racist with no evidence. 

The security guard sure seemed upset even before he looked to see who slapped him. But noooo, according to you, he's only angry because it was a black guy."

sports,feleq10,t1_fekz02m,1579220433.0,"Welp, in the article that you linked it says that the cop threatened to arrest anyone smoking cigars. It doesn't mention him only threatening black players. 

The video definitely doesn't show the whole interaction so you're just assuming that he was being racist when there really isn't evidence to support that."
Showerthoughts,fej5ylb,t1_fej0ff6,1579158242.0,"Its always going to be the storytellers fault if they forget. I have no control over their memory.

Plus, my unmemorable reaction was caused by their presumably unremarkable story. Tell an exciting story and I'll react accordingly"
Showerthoughts,feiluyz,t1_feibecx,1579141567.0,"Yeah, it's all just people forgetting. If they don't remember your reaction that would imply they forgot about telling you.

I don't know how OP thinks they are different"

DestinyTheGame,fd36hhu,t1_fd2oqkl,1578155197.0,"That's been one of my biggest complaints. The collection system is everything I wanted for managing items, except it's completely useless for any gear that isn't from y1. I understand that they didn't want people to be able to just pull out armor/weapons until they get the roll that they want, but we might as well not have a collection system if I still have to store everything in my vault in case I want it"
DestinyTheGame,fd31jpo,t1_fd0vfpv,1578153838.0,"Sorry, I'm honestly trying to make sense of your first comment.

You bought the pass last season and leveled it up to the point of getting the ornamented armor. Somehow you didn't get the hunter armor even though you were at the level for it?"
funny,fd0nxos,t1_fd0fdwi,1578121416.0,That's a rough thing to tell a gal
DestinyTheGame,fd009ak,t1_fczfe7y,1578111674.0,So you thought the vex hunter armor would come back this season?

Not about the show"
