The United States in particular was (virtually) founded on, among other things, a clause protecting free speech. And with that, a type of cultivation occurred around speech, where in opinions became nearly as valuable as facts. Today we still get morons all over the place saying ""I can say whatever I want, it's a free country"", at any opportunity they can, not realizing that it's a crutch to lean on when one is uncomfortable with the idea of expanding their horizons and trying out new perspectives."
politics,fe6i68g,t1_fe6fz6b,1578891664.0,"I don't think ""it is not that hard"" is good advice for an incel. For many people, it is not that simple, and it is kind of a privileged thing to say it is easy being attractive. Some people come from extremely poor or abusive homes, and/or who's parents have borderline cult-like rules on sex. Others grow up in such destitute situations where even the concept of getting regular haircuts doesn't make sense as an incentive, because they aren't even surrounded by enough attractive people of the opposite sex, that it warrants putting in any effort into one's appearance. I spent a brief time in public schools, and nearly everyone I was in school with was either obese, or had clothed full of holes. Many students didn't show up to school, and the ones who did were typically violent or undereducated. I was lucky to get out. But let me tell you, there was really very little ""incentive"" to look nice unless, you considered emulating Kid Rock as looking nice, which was pretty much the highest standard for the twenty white dudes in my school (there were maybe five white girls at the time). I'm afraid economics has a very real role in the cultivation of incels. It's ultimately up to the the incel to do anything about it, but we should not be taunting them, seriously. Some of them just have hard lives.

politics,fdgr6xp,t1_fdgoa8l,1578406205.0,"I actually think, given the history of our unwanted presence in the middle east over the last decades (and really the unwanted presence of white westerners in the middle last over the last century and a half) that poor, young, impressionable men in the middle east were radicalized to commit violent acts of terror in the name of an ideology they scarcely had a reason to follow. I do not think a war within Iraq was the correct response, nor am I giving America/the republicans a pass, but I am completely against the spreading of *complete conspiracy theories* that cater to the liberal wet dream. Assuming that Islamic extremists couldn't independently organize an act of war, both underestimates the danger of our meddling in the middle east, and frankly also insults the integrity of all cultures in undeveloped countries outside of the U.S. and treats them as barbarian.

Iran has orchestrated violence against Americans. That *fact*, may be a weak excuse for the assassination of general Soleimani, and the GOP may be harping on themes of divisiveness strongly to help rally support around the president, but that does not make the evidence for our abrasive relationship with Iran *fabricated*. But more importantly, there is a distinction between 9/11 and 2020. Trump committed an act of war against Iran -for his own personal benefit- without proper consideration. A reckless gesture. What you're insinuating is that a former president committed an act of war *against his own country* for personal benefit, a scenario in which the incentives just don't line up, and the evidence doesn't exist."

If someone wants to change things, the U.S. government has to step in, and either decide that Twitter *has* to enforce freedom of speech a certain way (as the government sees fit), or Twitter stays private, and the government sanctions a new platform with its own rules and terms of service (based on the constitution) that is separate and totally independent from Twitter and the other social media platforms.
