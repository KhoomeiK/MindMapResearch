This statement right here shows me you don't have any idea what you're talking about. Even among stimulant based medications, there are four different categories, only one of which is amphetamine based. Then there are the non-stimulant options, not to mention the off label options.


As for the increase in diagnoses, it couldn't possibly have anything to do with better diagnostic tools could it? Like, instead of just labeling a kid as a ""bad kid"", maybe they actually look at what's causing the kids problems in the classroom. Also, removing the stigma associated with ADHD and other EF disorders (like Oppositional Defiance Disorder) has led to increased awareness among parents who are more willing to listen when an educator or physician suggests sending their child for additional testing with a trained child psychologist.
