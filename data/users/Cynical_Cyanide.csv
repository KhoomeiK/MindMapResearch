Tactical nukes like the Davy Crockett - That's a 'mini' nuclear bomb. 

Here you are trying to downplay this by talking about the explosion in terms of the entire nuclear armament of an Ohio submarine? Why not just fucking speculate on how many (full-strength) Tzar bombs the USSR could've made during its entire existence and compare this explosion to the entire country's stockpiles? 

Idiot."

That means Joe consumer pays profit to the ISP/telco, pays more to the govt, and the govt just hands it right back to the company ... 

It's a consumer tax that goes straight into privately owned infrastructure they don't have to pay for.

Why isn't this a company tax for those industries that goes into public/shared infrastructure?"

Obviously $100 or whatever is too cheap, duh, but I struggle to believe that a huge chunk of that $1,000 purchase price isn't just pure profit that they can get away with charging only because in a wedding you're either one of the family members obsessed with the bride looking perfect for a day, or one of the family members scared to piss off the other half of the family by making cost a factor. Same reason why diamonds are so extremely overvalued."

Mate, you do realise that the tech-heads aren't their target audience yeah? You realise their plan is to trick artists and wealthier consumers into shelling out huge dosh for a monitor that they'll think is just as good as the 30K+ monitors?
