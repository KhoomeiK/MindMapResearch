HumansBeingBros,fdqumsc,t1_fdqt7wq,1578675154.0,"> Thats not the why of what you claimed. You said you're charged with public intoxication because you might commit crimes.

You have bad reading comprehension. You are the one continuing to argue the merits of public intoxication laws. They exist, like it or not, and I have provided a select but by no means complete list of reasons why. 

> So im drunk enough that i throw up and need to sit down. Im a danger to everyone?

""Need to sit down"" is not the same as ""blackout drunk."" At least not for most people.

>Yes, youre logic is twisted.

Our self-proclaimed legal expert, everyone!

>You keep saying that but havent substantiated that claim. What is that drunk? What makes me a danger? The fact that i puked?

If you have lost control of your facilities such that a bouncer has to take you home and get you cleaned up, you are a danger to yourself in many ways. If you are too dense to understand that premise there is no sense in continuing this conversation.

>Right, which is what the bouncer did.

Recommending Tylenol to a drunk person is a perfect example of how this bouncer does not know what he's doing.

>Any real bouncer has thorough training in First aide and intoxication related dangers, including poisoning.

Not necessarily, they don't. See above."
HumansBeingBros,fdqtnpy,t1_fdqsqe5,1578674638.0,"> there is no precedent to prosecute someone for transporting someone to a residence for appropriate care as a kidnapper.

""Appropriate care"" - you mean recommending a potentially deadly mix of acetaminophen and alcohol?

There are a lot of kidnappers who do what they do while telling themselves that they are doing a favor to the victim. That doesn't change the fact that it's kidnapping.

We don't need to argue semantics here. A prosecutor may not charge this person with ""kidnapping"" but might charge ""abduction"" or similar. Obviously depends on jurisdiction. The point is that taking someone somewhere without consent is not ok and could easily be prosecuted. 

Bouncer is not a ""bro."""

HumansBeingBros,fdqrerv,t1_fdqp20w,1578673262.0,"> Still not legally kidnapping.

Do you realize that if you have sex with someone who is too drunk to give consent you are committing legal rape? When you take someone  somewhere when they are too drunk to give their consent to go with you, you are kidnapping.

> still not a crime

Yes, kidnapping is a crime and this bouncer could easily be prosecuted for it.

> they arent going to be drunk by the time they wake up

Yes, they probably are. Likely not blackout drunk but probably still significantly elevated BAC.

> they have a right to self care

Giving someone a recommendation for a medication that could potentially cause liver failure is irresponsible. 

> Youre punishing the victim you little freak.

The theoretical person in this fake post is only a victim of kidnapping. There is no such thing as being a victim of drinking too much. Those are choices we all make and sometimes we need to face consequences for them. Being kidnapped by a bouncer is not an appropriate consequence."
HumansBeingBros,fdqqsm4,t1_fdqox5s,1578672886.0,"You're charged with public intoxication because you're publicly intoxicated. I gave you a list of reasons why public intoxication is not ok. If you don't agree that public intoxication should be penalized that's a different conversation, but almost every municipality has rules against it and it's for a good reason. When you're that drunk you are a danger to yourself and to others. Period.

>Sounds like you just want to punish the victim.

That is some twisted logic. Again, when you are that drunk you are a danger to yourself and others. You have taken actions that require, for the good of the community, intervention by people who know what they are doing. The bouncer is not an appropriate interventionist."
HumansBeingBros,fdqqgjl,t1_fdqopm6,1578672682.0,"We don't have enough information to know if this person has an addiction or not. All we know is that they consumed too much and were no longer in control of their facilities.

HumansBeingBros,fdqop0s,t1_fdqnlba,1578671574.0,"It's extremely irresponsible and reckless, though, which is why someone who is that drunk should be under trained supervision vs being kidnapped by a stranger, be they well-meaning or not."

You admit that's it's not a particularly original line of thinking. The only thing kind of unique about it is its extremity. And is extremity really all that special? And the only reason anybody has read it is because he threatened to kill more people if we didn't.

You have bad reading comprehension. You are the one continuing to argue the merits of public intoxication laws. They exist, like it or not, and I have provided a select but by no means complete list of reasons why. 

> So im drunk enough that i throw up and need to sit down. Im a danger to everyone?

""Need to sit down"" is not the same as ""blackout drunk."" At least not for most people.

>Yes, youre logic is twisted.

Our self-proclaimed legal expert, everyone!

>You keep saying that but havent substantiated that claim. What is that drunk? What makes me a danger? The fact that i puked?

If you have lost control of your facilities such that a bouncer has to take you home and get you cleaned up, you are a danger to yourself in many ways. If you are too dense to understand that premise there is no sense in continuing this conversation.

>Right, which is what the bouncer did.

Recommending Tylenol to a drunk person is a perfect example of how this bouncer does not know what he's doing.

>Any real bouncer has thorough training in First aide and intoxication related dangers, including poisoning.

""Appropriate care"" - you mean recommending a potentially deadly mix of acetaminophen and alcohol?

There are a lot of kidnappers who do what they do while telling themselves that they are doing a favor to the victim. That doesn't change the fact that it's kidnapping.

We don't need to argue semantics here. A prosecutor may not charge this person with ""kidnapping"" but might charge ""abduction"" or similar. Obviously depends on jurisdiction. The point is that taking someone somewhere without consent is not ok and could easily be prosecuted. 

Bouncer is not a ""bro."""

Do you realize that if you have sex with someone who is too drunk to give consent you are committing legal rape? When you take someone  somewhere when they are too drunk to give their consent to go with you, you are kidnapping.

> still not a crime

Yes, kidnapping is a crime and this bouncer could easily be prosecuted for it.

> they arent going to be drunk by the time they wake up

Yes, they probably are. Likely not blackout drunk but probably still significantly elevated BAC.

> they have a right to self care

Giving someone a recommendation for a medication that could potentially cause liver failure is irresponsible. 

> Youre punishing the victim you little freak.

The theoretical person in this fake post is only a victim of kidnapping. There is no such thing as being a victim of drinking too much. Those are choices we all make and sometimes we need to face consequences for them. Being kidnapped by a bouncer is not an appropriate consequence."

When you're that drunk you are a danger to yourself and to others. Period.

>Sounds like you just want to punish the victim.

That is some twisted logic. Again, when you are that drunk you are a danger to yourself and others. You have taken actions that require, for the good of the community, intervention by people who know what they are doing. The bouncer is not an appropriate interventionist."
