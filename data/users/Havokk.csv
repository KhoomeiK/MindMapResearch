sadcomics,fdtt68p,t1_fdtgk8e,1578721808.0,"lets say it start it starts with a boy that is 12 years old who has a dog for 12 years and the dog dies.  that boy was (arbitrarily) 12 years old when he got the dog in the beginning and then age with the dog over the 12 years.   When the dog dies the first time the boy is now 24.  There is a time machine technology and he goes back in time to be with his dog again from the beginning when the dog was born.  The man lives another 12 AWESOME years with his dog and the doge dies again.  the man is 36 years old now and wants to go back again for the 2nd time!!!!!   lives another 12 with years with the dog and the dog dies again after 12 years and the man is now 48....
The man continuously gets older as he lives his life 12 years at a time by the side of his beloved dog to the point he dies of old age and no more time travel is possible and the cycle ends.


Moral of the story is THERE IS NEVER ENOUGH TIME TO SPEND WITH A BEST FRIEND (DOG) AS IT WILL NEVER BE ENOUGH no matter how many times one goes back in time to re-live the years by their side.
