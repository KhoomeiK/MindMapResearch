doordash_drivers,fdypd9b,t1_fdynjyz,1578782186.0,"And I agree with the postmates .50 instant cash payout, who wouldn’t? Not only is it cheaper but you can do it as many times as you want whereas DD only allows you to do it once a day. Why?"
doordash_drivers,fdyot3p,t1_fdynjyz,1578782081.0,Because scheduling doesn’t guarantee you will be busy the whole time. I will sit for hours sometimes on a shift and get either no orders or shitty offers that I have to decline. Also beings that you can adjust the scheduled time or end it when you want without repercussions tells me that scheduling is pointless on both sides.
doordash_drivers,fdyn5j4,t1_fdyghr0,1578781585.0,"Also, wtf is the point of reddit and this subreddit if it’s not getting on here to bitch about doordash or anything in general ?

doordash_drivers,fdykjdg,t1_fdyhtk3,1578780737.0,"I doubt that the scheduling is their edge over PM, that’s ridiculous. The fact that you know what you’re making before you accept is definitely their edge over PM. My point still stands, they need to get rid of scheduling, then I’d have no issue."

doordash_drivers,fdy0pk6,t1_fdy0ew9,1578774835.0,"Beings that I posted that I missed my scheduled time slot, I’m already aware of that. My point was, it’s stupid and should be like PM where I can work whenever tf I want."
