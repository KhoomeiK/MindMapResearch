Bottom line, interview the therapist and see how it goes. Don't focus on their sex, focus on their qualifications and experience. Ask for references. If you open up to other men you will be pleasantly surprised about how many men have been to therapy. This can get you some good recommendations."

I did see a story in legal advice where a strike was missed because thr patient disclosed his weed use. All of his stroke symptoms were ignored and he didn't receive adequate care until three damage was done. So I agree on some level but if I used drugs I'd take the risk of disclosing them to prevent a bad reaction. But I totally see your point.

It's absurd to wait until AFTER marriage to find out your partner's finances. In this case, I already know half of the equation (her salary). Someone at her income level, with a newer model bmw sends red flags for me especially since it's all over social media (not my thing). It's something I definitely would inquire about after the first 90 days. This is still about compatibility. Financial recklessness is not something im willing to look over anymore. 

It doesn't matter any way. There's many reasons we are not compatible and why I would never pursue the relationship. The biggest one is she works in the same building I do and she works for a company closely related to mine."

Advice,fdmyxik,t1_fdmyq1a,1578571851.0,"Women can be crazy, vindictive and manipulative. You don't know anything until you see a dna test. Don't sign anything. Are you sure she's pregnant? Some women buy positive pregnancy rates from pregnant women online to set up guys like you. Tell your parents and let them handle it."

Divorce,fdm3bbt,t1_fdm2tf6,1578538804.0,"1 - Friends don't treat friends how you are describing her. 2 - Do you have free rein to go into her home (I'm guessing no). 3 - You know about her online dating because she believes it hurts you.  She's throwing that in your face, again this is not how a friend should treat you. 4 - Are you allowing her freedom in your home because she will ""snap"" at you? If you are afraid of her reactions, then you are afraid of her and that's not healthy. 5 - She is still not over what ever happened with that comment she made about how you feel about her.    


She is manipulative, controlling and possibly narcissistic, but if that works for you go right ahead."
