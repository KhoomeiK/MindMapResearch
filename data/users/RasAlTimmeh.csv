MMA,fehzj5v,t1_fehvnlj,1579127047.0,"It is all halfway shit. The rules are not black and white and it depends on each situation. 

You would rather have herb stop the fight, raise up both fighters, take a point from Conor for the shit that Conor did? Conor did nothing, he was struggling the whole time and was getting absolutely smashed despite his cheating. 

The right call is for Herb to let Khabib continue to do what he is doing, not stop the fight and reset it standing. 

What if Herb made that crucial decision to stand them up and Khabib gets KOed despite Conor getting a point taken? He'd get so much shit for that and that just shows you, you can never please everyone as a ref. 

Refs not just Herb Dean, are very hesitant to take away points EVER. It just doesn't happen a whole lot. The ref has to stay out of the way and only takes a point if its really necessary. Taking a point while the cheating fighter is in a less dominant position and losing the fight only punishes the winning fighter. Just let them fight. 

Khabib did what he did which was to ride it out and submitted Conor. I'm sure Herb knew that and he didn't want to get in his way."
MMA,fehugwh,t1_fehth5k,1579124103.0,"A foul in basketball is way different than a point taken in MMA. Refs rarely take points even when people keep eye poking standing up or nut shotting someone where they have to take 5 mins. Conor was definitely cheating but it was doing nothing to Khabib. 

If Herb Dean stood both of them up and took a point everyone would be furious that a) he took away Khabib's dominant position b) He influenced the fight majorly when he didn't have to. 

Cheating acts have to be doing something and by quite effectively for a ref to have to want to jump in. not to mention this was one of the biggest fights of all time and a title fight. 

Refs should stay out of everything until they ABSOLUTELY need to jump in. And in this case, no we didn't need Herb to jump in and save Khabib. He did what was correct, which was doing nothing and letting Khabib handle it."
MMA,fehs9ap,t1_fehkvfb,1579122856.0,"I disagree. You need to hear the take from Firas about that. As a ref, what's he going to do? It's not egregious enough to take a point in a massive fight he just kept doing sneaky sly shit like holding his gloves for a split second and letting go, putting his toes in the fence and letting go, just dirty enough that it wasn't enough to take a point. If Herb had taken a point for those things he would've influenced the fight heavily.

And he certainly can't stand them up because that only penalizes Khabib by resetting position.

In sports there are always gray areas and players know it and exploit it. They cheat just enough that it's not enough for the ref to take a point. I believe he got verbal warnings but as far as the fight is concerned, Herb deemed him taking a point is not justified as Khabib was smashing him and doing so would only penalize Khabib.


&#x200B;

What exactly do you expect from a ref? You want him to save the already smashing and dominating fighter from subtle and dirty tactics that are doing nothing for the losing fighter? You just let it ride at that point.




EDIT TLDR:
- Conor down all rounds. Losing a point doesn't do anything for Conor as he's already down on score cards.
- his only chance is to get back to stand up and KO khabib
- khabib already smashing and dominating

Explain to me how standing up both fighters benefits Khabib? It doesn't. In this case rule following without judgement and discretion hurts the winning fighter. 

If herb Dean took a point and stood them up and Conor KOed Khabib would you still keep singing that same tune?"

MechanicAdvice,fdorhyb,t1_fdokiuu,1578611260.0,"Do what?

My point is CA is strict on smog but also has programs that help out if you have financial hardship. Including cost of repairs for emissions related things. CA also sets the bar at the longest warranty period on emissions related things when it comes to new cars.

There is no inspection which means that while emissions and evap systems are strict, you won't ever have to be out on the street for having to replace the power steering rack that's leaking, hunting down electrical gremlins, or anything else related to inspections. I know people in other states that stress about their annual inspections and it seems like it costs just as much, if not more money to deal with that than smog, seeing as how smog is a fairly simple system.

Registering kit cars such as Factory Five cars or anything that's not a standard manufacturer car is the easiest process in CA compared to other states like Texas. You get full emissions exemptions for life on the car and have to pass a basic inspection.

It's really not as bad as people think it is and almost 100% of people talking about CA really dont live here.

Yes removing your cats (aka headers) will send you to state ref though if the cops feels like it, but that's illegal federally anyway it's just more enforced here.

&#x200B;

So really you can make the same argument about state inspections that you applied to CA emissions.

CA is only OBDII check emissions for any car 2000 and above. Much like other states."

cars,fclhk4w,t1_fcldhoq,1577747954.0,"How long do you think it will take to re-do all the wires that go to every single home and apartment building? What about the people who park on the streets? The standard 110v that goes to homes underground and overhead is not enough to charge cars. And I think you misunderstood what I meant by infrastructure. The entire grid cannot handle everyone charging electric cars all at once. The way electricity works is that not everyone uses at the same time. This is a limitation from the size of the wire all the way to the electrical companies equipments. Everything would have to be changed. 

Changing all of that even if we started now would take decades. It's just the nature of how long it takes for construction to complete. 

Hydrogen is ridiculous? How is it anymore ridiculous than gas? You fill up and it powers an electric motor with no emissions. Is it any more flammable than GASOLINE? Gas stations already dispense propane, hydrogen would be an easy transition. 

Lithium is not an overexaggerated issue. It is mined in 3rd world countries like venezuela and other places and there's a finite # of lithium in the world. I thought we were replacing finite carbon fuel with something abundant like solar. Well lithium is the problem and it just trades 1 problem for another. 

Just look at Tesla's lithium supply btw. Where are all these Tesla powerpacks that should have been here long time ago? Tesla makes amazing cars but they operate on hype and release new revolutionary products when they need to raise capital. We have yet to see the Powerpack which from sources say they cannot produce because they don't have enough lithium to do that and also produce Model 3s. Where is the Roadster which is supposed to come out in 2020? 

Lithium mining is a bottleneck and it is a world wide global restriction not just restricted to Tesla.

There is a new technology in glass batteries that use Sodium which would revolutionize this entire argument. But it is not proven yet. But electric vehicles as it stands have hurdles beyond what people think. 

I feel like your argument about LA is speaking from a bubble. There are LOTS of people who drive that electric vehicle currently would not work for and that does not even include the massive number of commercial vehicles that requires towing and hauling. 

Setting policy ahead of time by 10 years is a foolish move and doing it before the technology or any planning is in place is even worse. 

You're welcome to not buy gasoline and there are early adopters now but the problems to fix before electric is in every house hold is YEARS away."

cars,fcl9tay,t1_fckuy2u,1577742924.0,"There are so many hurdles that need to be addressed before everyone can use it. We're not even talking about range or anything with the car. The biggest is infrastructure. Los Angeles has issues with the electrical grid already and my city has blackouts from people using too much power during the summer because of AC. 

We would have to beef up the grid to every single home in order to charge electric cars and that is a huge undertaking even if the car has 500mi ranges. 

And the charge time is still too long to use for a lot of people. Not everyone has access to a supercharger so currently the electric car is viable in cities for shorter commutes. But if you want real reliable range for long commutes, travel, transportation and hauling, they would have to employ technology with either much faster charging or massive battery packs or both. 

Or another option is hot swap battery packs and possibly to do it as a quick change service at gas stations that are converted to EV stations. 


Either way it is possible but people are way too unrealistic about the time frame for it to happen. 

Even if the technology existed right now, the infrastructure problem will take years and years to solve simply because of the time it takes for construction. 


I personally think hydrogen is a better solution than full electric. It's an electric car but uses hydrogen gas. You can readily convert petrol gas stations to hydrogen stations and fill up and range doesn't require infrastructure changes or long times. It has a lot of the benefits of full electric vehicles such as no emissions, electric motor, etc with none of the charging limitations. Although it's not sexy as it doesn't give you the instant power of a shit load of batteries which produce tremendous acceleration. 

Currently to sum up, infrastructure and lithium mineral mining are big hurdles we have yet to solve and passing legislation to ban petrol cars in 10 years is BEYOND retarded."

Did you need any help checking out?

Steve,

Account Executive

You don't want to bombard them with links or buzz words. People have pattern recognition for spam and marketing emails whether they actively notice it or not. Everything is personal when I write emails and it sounds like a real person is typing. I also get to the point quick.

I also end everything with a question as it evokes a response.

Lastly, a lot of what I'm promising is only available thru me and not the website. Notice I did not say I have a promo code and end it there. I have had people say ""what's the code?""

People really dont want to deal with salespeople or people in general and so you must be willing to offer something of value to the prospect that makes them ok with talking to you for a few mins. Whether it's a longer trial for software, bypassing the credit card requirement, promo codes, discount codes (that are only valid until X), etc.

Label yourself with a proper signature.. Steve, Account Executive, Office #, Cell #. I am a real person and they should know it. I noticed that when prospects think you're a customer service rep just calling, they treat you like trash. If you establish yourself as an account executive and a real professional, they are more open to talking cordially and respectfully."
