Edmonton,fgo93i2,t1_fgo5xxh,1580962863.0,Someone broke into my car in December and stole my snow brush (along with the tool kit ahead in the trunk). Thieves are weird.

ADHD,fghpger,t1_fggxlyu,1580790299.0,This usually happens to me at work. Someone will come into my office to ask me something and I realize there's nothing to pause when I take my headphones off.

AskWomen,fghgdr0,t1_fgfxuj9,1580784218.0,Up in Canada I only had two channels in total. I watch so much Golden Girls after school.
thalassophobia,fgeqmit,t1_fgepzfl,1580706681.0,I grew up in the northern prairies of Canada and didn't see the ocean until I was 12. Most people here don't really think about the ocean much. I have travelled quite a lot and did grow an affinity for the coast. I'm back in the prairies now and don't often notice how much I miss the ocean until I see it again.

ADHD,ffvqvv8,t1_ffufgkv,1580270737.0,"I definitely had this. I didn't get diagnosed until my 30s so it would be really embarrassing when something small would get me crying at work. I couldn't figure out why I would react so intensely to small things. I saw a counsellor briefly in university and she suggested that was just how I expressed emotion and it was no big deal (ugh). Over a decade later my ADHD diagnosis finally explained it. The meds helped a lot but I am also trying meditation and yoga (double ugh but it's worth a shot, right?).

Edmonton,ffuud8k,t1_ffug9nc,1580249507.0,It was more that I didn't want to risk the loogie bleeding through the paper towel.

Edmonton,ffswjpn,t3_euzj83,1580195372.0,I parked at a Petro-Can next to a pickup taking more than his fair share of a spot (I was between the lines myself). I guess the poor boy had to squeeze in and felt the need to spit on my car on the way out. Worth it.
WhitePeopleTwitter,ffsw6da,t3_euwm2k,1580194917.0,"Real talk, I would love to go braless but I'm on the bigger side, rack-wise and I need the support. Running, riding ATVs, even going upstairs quickly can actually hurt quite a bit. Also, chafing."

AskReddit,ffn12e4,t1_ffmiur6,1580060903.0,"As a 14 year old girl, I was looking for pics of Leonardo DiCaprio and David Duchovny on dial-up. It never occurred to me to wipe the search but I was the only one who knew how to use the internet in my house. I likely even included FBI in my search: *Fox Mulder FBI speedos* lol."
todayilearned,ffju79o,t3_etytlb,1580007060.0,"Everyone is comparing this to radio, which makes sense if you don't consider the fact that streaming is replacing song/album purchases for a lot of listeners. That is the bread-and-butter for independent artists. My brother-in-law is a folk musician and he told me that a gig pays the same now as it did for his dad in the 70s. CD sales used to lessen the blow a little bit but not anymore. Without a revenue stream, small-market musicians won't be able to continue."

onguardforthee,ffiv7cx,t1_ffikxt5,1579983519.0,I lived in both Nova Scotia and Alberta. The difference is that the Alberta racists are pretty open about it. Many Nova Scotians seem to be completely unaware I've how bad their prejudices are.

MapPorn,ffh16b5,t3_eteysq,1579920347.0,I'm going to Germany in three weeks. This is going to be insanely helpful- awesome job!
ADHD,ffh0y2j,t1_fffcap7,1579920172.0,"Can confirm. Almost exactly a year ago I started my first office job after doing outside contract work. The amount of time I spend on the internet is embarrassing. The funny thing is I usually get super motivated in the last couple hours of the day so I accidentally stay late once in awhile. Luckily we have Flex hours so I can bank that time. It's also government, so even my dopamine starved brain made me seem like a keener compared to the lifers."
Picard,ffed7y3,t1_ffch1vg,1579843762.0,"In Canada they air it on the Sci-fi channel so there was no season synopsis before the episode started, thankfully."
Picard,ffe7u6i,t1_ffbjgqb,1579839052.0,The only trailer I saw was the one from the intro with hPicard playing poker with Data. When I saw the Borg cube I was like 'oh shit!'. I assume this is how Seven of Nine gets pulled into the story. Over the years I've learned to wean myself from the hype machine before the release of something I love. It's getting harder and harder to do but it's worth it. My first experience of a full non-spoiler release in the internet age was the video game Mass Effect 2. I was out of the country in the lead-up to the game release and so when I played with no foreknowledge it totally blew my mind.
marvelstudios,ffe5jjj,t1_ffdqsn6,1579837261.0,His wife Emily Gordon is a pretty interesting woman as well. I used to listen to their video game podcast and if their marriage is not #relationship goals I don't know what is. Glad Kumail's doing so well and definitely plan to check out the Eternals on his endorsement.

On the bright side my three buddies I was playing with spent the rest of the night going after this guy and tea-bagging him to the point where he quit.

I actually think it detrimentally affects my dating chances sometimes. I was changing the oil in in my driveway once and a guy came over and offered to help. I said sure because he was cute and then he looked under my hood despite the fact you can only access the filter and drain plug from underneath. He nodded and said ""looks good, seems like you have things in hand"", and then left. I really could have play the damsel in distress and kept them around but couldn't be bothered."
