The 3rd was better than the 2nd. The first was great because it was a nior mystery. The 3rd was more sci-fi-esque. 

The 3rd one is a slow burn and really sinks in better after some reflection. 

I'd love to read more of the series."

You realize that just because you were born on leap year doesn't mean you only count every forth year right?"

Is that true or is the media as biased as they claim and only report stories about them designed to make them seem insane?"

From my side I see a party that shut the other side out completely for 8 years. I felt like under Obama I had no voice and important criticisms to major policies, such as the ACA, were being ignored and played off as partisanism instead of being critically examined as serious structural flaws in the a major policy change. Since then I've watched the media stop even pretending to be unbiased in an all-out effort to defeat republicans. Some of the criticisms are valid but they get lost in the shuffle when every story is spun to criticize the president and so people on my side now disregard nearly every criticism because the boy cried wolf too many times.

As for Trump. I don't know if I'd personally want him as a next-door  neighbor but I also cannot easily dismiss his business success as something anyone born in his shoes could have pulled off in his place. In fact most rich kids end up squandering thier inheretance. I read his book in the 90s and saw he had policy ideas that resonated with me even then. The Wolman rink is an example. So while I do fully agree that both sides are to be looked at with skepticism I also know that blind faith in any philosophy is folly. This is why I feel we must be as free as possible to make our own decisions because they may fool some of us but they cannot fool all of us.

When I see people supporting ""socialism"" I realize that those who promise it never bring what those who support it were promised. They have different ideas of what that term means and when they fail to implement it they defend the term saying ""that's not what socialism really is."" Ok, I don't disagree but can anyone deliver what you believe it ""really is?"""
