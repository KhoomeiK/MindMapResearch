cats,fewrksk,t3_eqnro1,1579418441.0,"I came home from work once and saw that my cat had found my yarns. It looked like a Tom and Jerry movie had been filmed in my house. Yarn everywhere! Under the chairs, around every leg of anything you can imagine, under shoes, and out the cat door in the back. There it got stuck in the LITTER BOX! I didn’t even want to try to spool it up again, I can tell you that"

entitledparents,fewm3vc,t3_eqq9x4,1579414266.0,"I’m glad you informed other parents too because those things have a way off snowballing. Someone has a party like that and the next kid wants one too. And guess what? All the same kids get invited. So she’ll probably try to take the chance to do that again. Now I know this might affect peoples minds in the way that the older sibling doesn’t get invited to any parties but I sure hope not. It’s not that siblings fault. Maybe walk her to the car, make sure the younger one is buckled in in the backseat? Give her a nice toothy smile while waving goodbye?"
