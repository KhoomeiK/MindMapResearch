The way I see it, Americans are just passive so they resort to twitter and reddit rants because they don't care enough to go outside. I see this sentiment all the time, not only with impeachment but with climate change and other issues, ""show them you care with your votes. Vote in _insert year_"". Really? You care so much that you are going to sit for a couple of years in hopes that someone will change things for you?

The other thing that i find perplexing is that some Americans argue that the 2nd amendment is there so there will be time where the people will have to fight against the government. Really? You can't take a day from your time to protest but you think you will be ready to go into civil war?"
