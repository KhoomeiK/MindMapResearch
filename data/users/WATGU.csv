With how fast people go and how little your visibility is until you're committed to the ""merge"" I don't consider it safe. 


You're basically forcing your car into a spot that may or may not be there with no time to actually accelerate to the flow of traffic. Also right on red is illegal in some places and at some intersections. 


I view suicide lanes the same way. You have a lane with 2 way traffic in the middle of 4 lanes with parking lots, pedestrians, and bikes to look for. It's actually surprising how few times accidents happen there as there's frankly no way at a busy time of day most people could accurately pay attention to bikes, 5 lanes of traffic and an opposing parking lot."

Based on your statements I don't think this guy is intentionally doing it. He's either clueless or very insecure and needs education. Obviously he needs to mature but you're all young this is the time for it. I don't think that makes anyone TA.


I think his reaction makes sense. Although I think he's wrong to call you a bitch, I can understand his pain. Masculinity is tied to penis size and his just got outed. I'm not surprised he couldn't or didn't want to have sex. What happened to him is humiliating and it's valid. Society makes men just as ashamed of our bodies as women of theirs. 


You were genuinely trying to help. Him and her from disease and unwanted pregnancy. I don't think that's wrong. 


Your friend tried, but she needs some strategy and tact maybe. She obviously likes the guy enough to have sex with him, so I assume she likes him enough to not needlessly humiliate him. I think by her not thinking through the best approach to using her own condoms didn't help but doesn't make her TA."

I am slightly above average girth, average length. I've measured and used the condom sizing website and they suggest magnum by fractions of an inch. To be honest I feel embarrassed buying that size I shouldn't need them. 


I've tried all sorts of regular condoms and they are incredibly uncomfortable and painful to go over the most sensitive part of my body that needs unrestricted bloodflow. 


So I use the magnums and they fit just fine, never bunched, slipped or broke. I'm only saying this to say 2 things;


The right fit is actually very important and getting condoms too small can actually be very uncomfortable or painful regardless of if that same size can stretch to fit over a foot. 


This guys problem is he has a below average penis and is self conscious of it."
AmItheAsshole,fdjbu90,t1_fdiadj3,1578464597.0,"Agreed. 


It's really not hard to say ""I'm more comfortable if we buy these condoms together"" or ""we're using these unopened condoms I bought and if they don't work we can go get more""


Just letting it slip she knows his penis size beforehand is a problem.

Edit: you can downvote but the reality is this girl cared enough about the guy to have sex with him she probably cares enough to not humiliate him. It is possible and 100% valid for men to feel insecure about their bodies, particularly our penis size. It doesn't make it right to take it out on people or delude yourself, but these people are in college they're still learning how to accept their bodies and find their place. It's not unreasonable for people who care about eacj other to work a little harder at being more sensitive around people's insecurities and help them work through them."
