I think it would be fun to run a 1930s Vintage 3 gun match. 1911 or HiPower + Winchester 12 or Ithaca 37 or Auto-5 / Rem 11 + Rem Model 8 or Garand (1936). Sort of like what Ian does for his Forgotten Weapon 2 gun matches.

I was also trying to convince them to do a 70s Cop division (service revolvers or 1911, pump shotguns, Mini-14 or M1 Carbine, massive fake mustaches) because I think it would be a fun way to introduce new shooters without a huge penalty for just reloading from a dump pouch instead of fancy expensive purpose-built gear."

Did I mention the misleading gimmicky marketing schlock?

Barrel - last ~10” of the 30” barrel has heavy pitting. Cut down, dress, and blue to match extension tube.

Receiver: minor pitting w/ blueing loss - polish and reblue, or leave as-is.

guns,ffaqy0v,t1_ffa9t4i,1579742415.0,"Lets game this out from an engineering perspective:

Lets say the barrel got up to smoking hot, 500 degrees. The barrel rifling would wear much faster, but it wouldnâ€™t burst or anything. More importantly, it doesnâ€™t appreciably change the heat treating. So factory barrel would probably be just fine.

If the barrel was replaced, then the failure mode for the slide if it was by chance effected by the fire would be softer-than-normal slide lugs, so like a cheap Philippines off-brand 1911 it would tend to wear and shoot loose a little faster - not a safety issue.

If the slide rails are a little softer, same thing - wears a little faster, shoots loose a little faster. 
The casehead on a 45 contains the pressure (look at how much is unsupported on a Glock barrel for instance) so the face hardness isnâ€™t all that important other than long term wear. Again, not a safety issue.

Lets say instead the frame was too soft - again, wears faster, loosens faster, still not a safety issue. Also, the wood grips are not burnt, so the grip frame area didnâ€™t get any hotter than about 500-600F max (would have charred and auto-ignited at that temp) so the temperature wasnâ€™t high enough to really anneal or temper the grip frame.

Now, heating the barrel and frame hot enough that they lose heat treat would have also heated the spring steel recoil and mainspring such that they would have lost their spring temper - so the hammer would not snap forward as hard as it should for instance. This does not appear to be the case.

Either way, the pistol is likely safe to shoot, especially if the barrel is replaced."
