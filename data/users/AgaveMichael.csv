>Shit I wonder what the wood on that door is made of. Is there anyone behind it? That's the bathroom right? I wonder what I'd be doing if I was in there. Oh man, what if I had to take a shit right now? That'd be embarrassing, but not as embarrassing as if I just ripped my pants off right here and now.

I wonder how fun it would be to fly a jet right now. Like Top Gun or some shit. ""Breaker breaker"". That would be so fun- Fuck, I need to fucking focus, except now I'm fucking starving. If I was on a date right now, what would I eat? Shit, if I had a date tonight, where would we even go? Fuck I-

Thought chains like this are how I suffer, and it's insanely hard to break out of them, and they happen constantly, all fucking day. I can't present it to you via text, but they're also accompanied by very detailed 'daydreams' I can pretty clearly see in my head. It takes an ungodly amount of focus to actually work on something I don't want to work on, and even when it comes to doing things I *like* to do, sometimes I have to break free of a 'thought chain' in order to do those things as well. 

A lot of people think ADHD is just being ""hyper', or 'inattentive' but it truly, truly causes you to just get ***lost*** in your thoughts and imagination. It's insanely hard to know what it's like if you don't have it. It sucked when I was a kid, and as a guy in m mid 20's, it still sucks. But it's 'normal' for me. I can't imagine not thinking like I do, anything else seems 'slow' and 'boring' to me. I think fast, about 30 different topics at once when I get stuck in these 'chains', and 99% of those topics are totally mundane, that don't make me any smarter, or more knowledgeable lmao. Literally staring at a blank wall or out a random window with a shitty view will just... Keep me thinking about shit. Time will fly by and I'm just like... Wait what the fuck have I been doing?
