Subtle was more influential in my life because the whole Buddhism perspective has changed the way I look at literally everything. But if you are interested in learning how to meet/talk to women, date, be more confident or build better relationship, Models will certainly help you. I believe it’s a pretty long book that’s why I decided to go with the audio book. Mark Manson has a blog with some AMAZING content as well if you just want a crash course on certain topics."
selfimprovement,fe6kkgi,t1_fe3p0jz,1578893962.0,I like a lot of Alan Watts’ quotes and teachings. Maybe I’ll give book a try. How has it influenced your life?
selfimprovement,fe6khh3,t1_fe4g91n,1578893879.0,Awesome. My four buddies and I just started our own mini book club and this is the first book we’re reading. Seeing this comment has me excited to start it!
selfimprovement,fe6kdn1,t3_eno12m,1578893772.0,"The Subtle Art of Not Giving A Fuck. This book change everything for me. I’ve reread it three times. I always go back to it for advice on specific matters. Mark Manson in general is one of my favorite writers, probably because I relate to his younger self. This book also got me into Buddhism and philosophy."
selfimprovement,fe6k9g1,t1_fe3ihlu,1578893657.0,Yo honestly this was the first self help book I read and it genuinely improved my life in so many ways. I continually go back to it when I need career or relationship advice. The relationship stuff is super interesting because we’re never really taught how to form and maintain proper relationship with people.
selfimprovement,fdh6h87,t3_elane0,1578416413.0,"Action inspires motivation. Live by the Nike slogan and “just do it”. I’m super tired and unmotivated or I use to be until I stopped thinking about what I wanted to do and started doing it. When I feel super unmotivated or tired or depressed. I go for a little jog. Even a half assed one will make me feel much better and much more motivated. Mastering new hobbies will make your routine feel less like a routine. Just start simple, if you want to learn to paint just start somewhere, anywhere, and that action will inspire more. Many people think it goes: motivation > action. But it can also be the reverse. You can take control of your own motivation."
getdisciplined,fc626to,t3_eg8yba,1577470591.0,"Some people believe it goes like this: motivation > action. But you can actually take life into your own hands. By doing something, anything at all, you can create motivation or inspiration that turns into motivation. You can actually practice: action > inspiration > motivation or action > motivation. Ok it sounds kind of dumb. For years my friends preached to me that action causes motivation. I didn’t realize how true it was until I started taking action whenever I didn’t know what to do or didn’t feel motivated. I don’t feel motivated today because I was just fired from a job and my emotions have been keeping me in my bedroom. This post has reminded me of what I learned. I’m going to go work out and then apply for jobs. Just do, don’t think. Sometimes it’s hard to remember in the moment. But the more times I remember it and take action, the more this discipline is ingrained into my psyche. I wish you the best of luck my friend!"
