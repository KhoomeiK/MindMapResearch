Games,fe9frc9,t3_enywi3,1578937173.0,"Fallen Order definitely. Cool concept, great devs with a history of good games, and dark souls-esque mechanics.

However, I found the game to feel really unpolished and janky. The animations were absolutely terrible and took me out of the game multiple times. The map design was also confounding because it was deliberately video-gamey in that none of the areas you visit seemed lived-in or part of the universe, rather they seemed something specifically created for a Jedi to hop and wallrun through. Not to mention that exploration is basically pointless because the only rewards you could get are poncho skins, ship skins, droid skins, or the occasional lore dump.

The story was also pretty forgettable, which is in part due to it being a prequel so you know how things are going to end up regardless. But also because a lot of things that happen during the story are quickly forgotten by the characters. Like in the very beginning where Cal's best friend is killed right in front of him. 5 minutes later it's like it never happened and Cal never mentions that guy again. And another part where, all of the sudden, Cal is captured and has to fight in an arena? Well after the arena it's never brought up again as if it didn't happen.

That being said, there were many cool moments. Darth Vader fight, getting your lightsaber crystal and making a new lightsaber, the main villian was also cool in how ruthless she was."
