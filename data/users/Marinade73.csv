If it's a multi-lane road a person turning left has the right of way to the left most lane provided there is no one coming straight through the intersection.

The only exception to this is a commercial vehicle, like a tractor trailer, that needs more space for the turn. They can turn from the left or right lane to any lane required to navigate the corner."

Look at the big hand, the minute hand, first. Is it pointing mostly down, up to the left or right? Mostly down it's around half past, mostly up and it's almost on the hour. To the right is about quarter after and the left is quarter to.

Once you've determined that, the small, hour, hand gets a bit easier to read. Say you've determined it's about half past based on the minute hand location if you look at the hour hand and it's between 3 and 4 you'll know it's about 3:30.

If the minute hand is to the left, you know it's about quarter to the hour. So when you look at the hour hand if it's still between the three and four, but should be getting closer to the four. This means it's about quarter to four."
