My mother tried very hard to not buy junk food for us, so that we had something good to eat after we would eat like, half a bag of chips by ourselves, which I bought for my brother and I.

Now I eat pretty damn healthy. Lots of veggies, pasta, chicken, and fruits. I thank my mother for all of that.
My dad just ate whatever he wanted. Lol."

trashy,felrgwe,t1_felr0j8,1579229131.0,"No no, I get that. I'm not trying to start an argument.

 I just don't like assuming that he can actually access it. I have a few accounts that I have money in that I physically cannot access until a certain date, and if I do I will get fined, or at least heavily taxed.

I want to keep an open mind to the situation. If you don't then that is fine. Also, I'm sorry about your brother. I do not know what I could do without my little brother, as much as a pain he is."
trashy,felq4yj,t1_felpktr,1579228223.0,"Like I said, we really don't know if he does. I'm not gonna just assume he has all the money ready to go. I'm also not going to assume that the family asked him to do anything but give the community a way to access their donation site. Losing a family member makes things tough and they all may not be thinking straight right now. We. Do. Not. Know. Anything.

I just don't find it fair to assume he doesn't want to help in anyway that he can just because he is not throwing all the money he has in their face atm. Maybe they are taking off work for a while and will need money for the service while Mark is paying their bills."
trashy,felp2as,t1_feln9d1,1579227476.0,"Still, it is fairly expensive. And as mentioned further up in this thread, it is not like he has infinite access to that estimated $ he is worth. He might have access to a very small portion of it, we do not know. For all we know they are counting the house into the total of his wealth."
trashy,felbi6b,t1_fel4syq,1579218296.0,"It cost $6,000-$7,000 flat for just burying someone. My friend's parents had to take out a loan for it.

It is not easy to bury someone. This cost does not even include a service. This is just straight burial . . ."
facepalm,fel9x2u,t1_fekib0a,1579217265.0,"It is much more common than you would think in hangings. Petechiae occurs in the eyes when there is a sign of struggle, that fight to survive, which can occur in both strangulation and hangings. Hangings break your neck at a different location than with strangulation. I think of it more as a mini-decapitation taking place within the victim's skull. Strangulation causes that little bone on the front of your neck to become depressed, fracturing it and causing damage there.

Now, whether the strangulation was by hand or by use of a ligature is a different story. Using a ligature makes it easier to cover up rather than using your hands. And it takes a while for you to die when being strangled, so using your hands takes a LOT of work. It would be easier to use a ligature.

(Sorry for long post. My criminal investigation class taught me too much info.)"
