Don't describe the alien in full to us perhaps, but minor notes. Also, give it a few eyes to give you suggestion on corrected grammar, there are some big errors and some spelling mistakes that took me a couple reads to figure out. 

You have a solid start here, just needs some polish."

todayilearned,ff57om6,t1_ff55u6x,1579582644.0,"I never said any of them deserve it, not am I saying we shouldn't be working on this problem. The reality is, in our current society, there isn't a good solution."
todayilearned,ff54en1,t1_ff534pk,1579579920.0,"Yes, sort of, but not really. 

Part of that problem is logistics, for sure. Who pays for it, who employs them, how does it all get done. And you can fax the people to death, and maybe eventually solve that problem. The other part is the human element. Others have touched on the aspect of ""well, if the state will provide a house, why should I work and pay taxes?"" I am going to completely ignore that side for this, because that is its own political quagmire that I don't want to get into. But part of it is the homeless people themselves. A significant portion of them are sick, in one manner or another, and may not be able to work, or to even take care of a house. Others still may not want to be a part of the system, and may not want the house (or to contribute back. Again, not getting into that side of things.) Further, you have some that, contrary to popular belief do not want own a house and live like you and I. 

It's not that if we as humans wanted to, we couldn't solve homelessness. We could solve a lot of our issues tomorrow if we could put down our sticks and give up our tribalism. No, part of it comes down to that, without taking away human rights, we couldn't solve the problem. There will always be people that simply don't want that life, and would rather freeze in the -40 weather I just experienced than find a home. Some people won't get clean, won't work, won't be a part of our system. It seems counter intuitive, but it's a reality. You could force them into government shelter, force them to be clean, but at that point, you might as well lock them in a prison, because that is what their lives will effectively become. 

Does this mean we should stop trying? Hell no. But we have to also realize, at some point, there will always be homeless people, we need to focus on helping those who want it. 

Also statistically speaking, governments with their bureaucracy are terrible at managing these projects, and we can't trust your average large corporation to do this without abusing human rights, so somewhere, something has to give."

WhitePeopleTwitter,fevu4qp,t1_fetj79x,1579401533.0,"Okay, but let me counter. 

It is 5 am, on a Sunday. I am up, because my body has been trained by the woman down the hall who lets her illegitimate crotch goblin run screaming down the halls for 30 minutes while she get ready to go to church. This child shrieks and bangs on doors anytime he is in the hall. If you have a shit animal owner, you can have them removed, but if you go to building management and go ""that woman is running an illegal tailoring business, using our washing machines to do it, and her child is the cross between a banshee and a goat, evict her"" suddenly you're the asshole who should think about finding somewhere new when the lease is up.

I'm not saying we should charge a child fee (although some backtracking on recent provincial laws around adult only buildings would be nice), but a place should not be allowed to charge me to have a 30 pound mini Aussie who hasn't so much as made a peep, when someone can have a 40+ pound hellspawn."

UnethicalLifeProTips,fcxt09x,t1_fcxjcuq,1578070032.0,"I mean, there are some studies that suggest weed use in children can lead to schizophrenia due to the brain being under developed.

worldbuilding,fcvrycf,t3_ej3i3o,1578008749.0,"**The Alliance of Independent Worlds' Technological Leap Frog**

It's actually something that a lot of species in my universe now study in a way to ensure that military secrets don't fall to enemy states. The Alliance is a human nation that was technologically stunted on a Galactic level due to the inability to trade technology with other species for 2 Galactic Years after their founding. This was part of the Galactic Trade Commission rules to prevent other species from exploiting fledgling species by driving them into indentured servitude to races that promise to keep people competitive. The problem was that other human nations couldn't trade technology with the Alliance either without risking punishment. This meant the Alliance couldn't advance their naval forces through adapting changes in tech for two years, and put them at a disadvantage. 

 

After a bad war of which they only won when the other two Human nations stepped in to protect them (and through GTC law they were then required to pay back for their support), they decided to not be forced out anymore. They started luring alien patrol ships into ambushes, and using hit and run tactics, combined with their only real advancement in stealth technology, to vent crews into space, and strip the ships for technology. No one could prove it was the Alliance, but with a year left on their clock their technological levels exploded forward, soon beginning to surpass other nations at a rate they shouldn't have been able to. After the period ended the Alliance became massively isolationist and refused to allow GTC scientists into their core worlds to study their growth, to the point that only a slim rim of their space became accessible. A hundred years later it is something many nations resent them for, even though they continue to deny it."
