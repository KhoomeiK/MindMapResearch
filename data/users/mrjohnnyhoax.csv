fatlogic,ffij1ml,t3_et4oms,1579975046.0,"""Storing the fat"" sounds like the cousin of ""starvation mode"""
fatlogic,ffii95m,t3_etekwf,1579974500.0,"People fail diets, diets don't fail people. Honestly, the trick to being successful with dieting is to find one you are comfortable with and can sustain. Most of the time that will be simply be your current diet at 60-80% intake. Liquid diets and all meat diets and plant based diets can work, but can you stick to them? If so, great. If not, beware falling into your default eating habits once you fail the diet."
fatlogic,ffig8jz,t3_etr1xy,1579973136.0,I have been wildly successful tracking calories in/out. Having them listed everywhere is a godsend.
fatlogic,ff2env6,t3_er5s1i,1579503000.0,"The answer is yes most likely, unless you're really  active and/or really large. For example, I am 6'8 and even at my leanest, at rest I would burn 2500 calories per day. Throw in a workout and calories burned doing random shit, I could clear 3000 to 3500. A 1900 calorie meal isn't outrageous if you're lighter on other meals. 

The real egregious part is how awful the quality of food is. Loads of sugar, loads of salt, loads of shit. The calories become egregious too if you're not working out a lot and not a naturally large man."
moderatepolitics,fena9rh,t1_fen775z,1579280366.0,"That's the question. There are a lot of philosophical and economic questions baked into it. For me, the idea that M4A would be cheaper than the current system is really hard to believe, purely based on the fact that M4A covers a lot more and would immediately stimulate demand without addressing supply (and in fact, stifling supply if Medicare reimbursement rate is maintained). Administrative costs are used as a gap to cover that but I don't think it stretches near as far as people think. I think M4A would be more expensive, and definitely more expensive for the average American making more than 30-40k lets say. We talk about average healthcare costs in America which is about 10k per person, but median is probably 2k-5k based on data I have seen.

Despite that, I think the question is still valid, because maybe we should just accept the real cost regardless of what it is, guided by the belief that people dying because they can't afford to be treated is barbaric. If that's the argument, I think it's powerful in a way. Some people might not like the idea of having to absorb the health consequences of others, but that's an individualism/collectivism type of argument as old as time. I am much more receptive to the moral argument for M4A than the idea that it would actually save money, which just strikes me as a way to sell it to the people whom the moral argument doesn't resonate."
moderatepolitics,fen5kkr,t1_fen0ydw,1579277463.0,"There is a difference between killing an industry and letting it die. I am not in favor of keeping jobs just to keep jobs, and I am in favor of letting industries/jobs die that become ""superfluous"" as you say. That is vastly different from intentionally killing an industry by making it illegal, and creating a government-run monopoly. M4A doesn't want to let the current system die, it wants to intentionally kill it by making it illegal. 

Just to be clear, I am very aware the current system is highly flawed and could be greatly improved upon. I am just wary of the common mentality that it can't get any worse, and that radical change will necessarily be beneficial. It can absolutely get much worse, and we should be careful so as to avoid that."
moderatepolitics,femxq8z,t3_eq0o05,1579272328.0,"I don't really have a problem with the proponents of the current health care industry trying to frame the issue against M4A, since proponents of M4A run political ads against the current setup, and M4A wants to completely kill the current health care industry. When candidates push M4A over the current setup, they round out the edges and frame things favorably as well. That's just politics. It basically amounts to an incumbent vs a newcomer. The policies at odds here are basically just proxy wars for the candidates themselves."
moderatepolitics,fehhtjj,t3_ep54lb,1579116826.0,"People making 6 figures don't need the relief of having their student loans paid off. They are now earning in a way that was originally intended by the loan, and will be able to cover their original investment within a reasonable amount of time. Giving tens and even hundreds of thousands of dollars of taxpayer money to a person who will likely never have money problems is truly foolish. Usually progressive redistribution ideas are actually progressive (from rich to poor), but student loan forgiveness is one of the weird outliers that is really regressive. Its probably the worst idea floating around the progressive platform these days. If we have 2 trillion laying around to redistribute, you could just write a $10k check to every American earning less than some arbitrary threshold and that will help those with student loan debt that are actually struggling with payments, and will also help people with other kinds of debt or expenses that are struggling."
moderatepolitics,fdexqg4,t1_fdeujrw,1578348827.0,"Fair enough. If progressives choose to stand on principle and live with the results, then that's their prerogative. I just disagree that it will have the effect they wish for, but if principle is more important than outcome, then that's not as important to progressives anyways.  

Out of curiosity, what was the answer to my question about Biden? As a progressive, do you think AOC should rally her supporters behind Biden if Biden wins the nomination?"
moderatepolitics,fdesqn1,t1_fdel4ym,1578345825.0,"I have witnessed Libertarians purity-test and principle-clutch their way into being politically irrelevant and obsolete for decades. Progressives are kind of new to the scene and remind me of a left-wing version of Libertarians. It sounds noble to be firmly planted in your principles, but given how many worldviews and ideologies are actually represented in American politics, it is exceptionally difficult to be at all effective without a healthy respect for compromise and pragmatism. I don't actually disagree with what AOC said about Biden. He is probably closer to John Kasich than Bernie Sanders, but if it becomes apparent that she and others are merely using the D party to push their own separate agenda and/or hijack the party, they'll find themselves on the fringe again in a hurry. The test of this will be if Biden wins the nomination. Will AOC implore her base to support Biden against Trump, or go silent and give the impression that it doesn't matter which one wins because they both stand outside the small circle AOC has drawn around herself?"
moderatepolitics,fde5s1e,t3_ekwqzj,1578331795.0,"One of the major complaints that Democrats have about AOC and other Justice Democrats is that they don't have enough respect for process and strategy. They tend to be the bull in the china shop at all times, under the assumption that their principles will always win out. This seems to be a good example of that. AOC is a spokesman of the progressive movement, and to basically throw Biden into the same bucket with Republicans is creating more enemies than she can actually handle. The Republicans are formidable enough. To pin yourself and your movement against both the D and R party is a nice start to a Cinderella story, but this is the real world where those pesky endings don't always go as scripted."
moderatepolitics,fbd1ad1,t3_ecnklm,1576741949.0,"The impeachment itself was such a success for Democrats (in terms of sticking it to the president's legacy, not necessarily polling), that I think this moment is a little bittersweet. Whether you are for or against impeachment, I think many of us already knew how the movie was going to end given the makeup of both the house and senate. 

This is akin to having the best night of your life and not wanting to go to sleep because you know when you wake up you're going to be horribly hungover, all of your friends will be gone and your buzz totally killed. If I simply don't go to sleep and keep the night going, then I am prolonging the inevitable hangover."
