Anyway, you are incredibly talented."

MMA,fecn8lu,t1_fecfhqv,1578978152.0,I think that a liver kick from Joe would be curtains for most people. But unnecessary. Joe would just choke him out. He’s a BJJ black belt.
MMA,fecn0du,t1_fecl1qt,1578977973.0,I’ve noticed that the TKD traditionalists are usually terrible with their hands and head movement. Kind of the T-Rex of martial arts.
