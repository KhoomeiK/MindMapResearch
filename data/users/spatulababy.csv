news,ffffana,t1_fffbwxm,1579882707.0,"There are a few bars out here in Maryland that required “private membership” to gain entry after indoor smoking laws went into effect back in 2007. Effectively, this allowed them to continue operations as a “smoking friendly” business without having to deal with the legal issues around it. For the most part, they did the same thing as you described above: took a photocopy of your ID and asked for an extremely reasonable membership fee.

I quit smoking (cigs) in 2013, but haven’t gone to those places since 2009 or so (despite being a smoker at the time, I was never fond of smoking indoors). Not sure if they’re still operating that way today."

aww,fffc7ch,t1_ffe8v5x,1579880751.0,"You can thank evolution for all of the above. It’s not a disadvantage for the koalas; rather, they’ve found and filled a specific niche. 

They’ve evolved to eat and digest the leaves of a plant which are highly toxic to many other animals. That means they don’t have to deal with competition from other species when it comes to sourcing food.

Their brains are smooth (lacking folds and the surface space that comes with it) probably because so much energy is devoted to digesting the highly fibrous and nutritionally light eucalyptus leaves. Maintaining a dense brain takes up a lot of energy, energy the body can’t spare as it is busy with digestion. 

Young koalas engage in coprophagia because it allows them to obtain the bacteria needed to properly digest the vegetation found in their habitat. Pandas, elephants and hippos also do this. 

We believe they don’t recognize the leaves on the ground for a couple reasons. First, koalas are very slow moving. Getting down from the trees they typically rest and graze in takes a lot of energy and leaves them susceptible to ground based predators. Second, it’s been noted that koala’s prefer to eat the young leaves at the top of a given branch, which are called tip. Koala’s prefer tip because they are higher in water and nutritional content. In fact, there’s enough water in the leaves and koalas consume so much per day that they rarely need to drink water. As the leaves fall on the ground and dry, they lose water content and nutritional content. It makes sense that evolution has geared them to avoid wasting their waking hours on subpar nutrition.

Chlamydia is sexually transmitted among koalas like it is in humans. However, it’s often passed from mother to young when they eat the pap of their infected mother (nutritious mother poop). It’s extremely rampant among koala populations and isn’t fully understood why, although it’s been found that koalas infected with an immunodeficiency retrovirus (think koala HIV) are more susceptible to chlamydia transmission and infection. This has little to do with their intelligence or evolution and everything to do with viral evolution and propagation. Just as the koalas have filled a niche by being able to eat a food that is toxic to most others, chlamydia has found a species it can infect most easily, and due to circumstances yet unknown (but most likely to do with the coprophagic behaviors and low genetic diversity)."
