AskReddit,fbtuwmj,t1_fbtp8tx,1577097193.0,"Seconding for organizing. I transitioned to book keeping for my uncle’s business and I use everything said above plus my epson portable scanner. I’ve had two other portable scanners and flag bed ones on multi use printers, but the epson one folds up nice and kicks ass for quick quality scans. 

One other beautiful edition is a $99 laser printer for black and white only. I hated all my ink jet printers and their ungodly high priced inks."
