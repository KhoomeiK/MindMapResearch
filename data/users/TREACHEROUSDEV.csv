EDH,ffcve02,t1_ffcshv3,1579808053.0,"I think what happens is some people intend on doing a secret santa and either get distracted, forget they signed up, or find out later they just don't have time or money for it.  Secret Santa is very much a middle-America bored-housewife type thing, you should be happier to give than to receive in such an event.  I'm sorry it didn't work out for you, but the above reasons are why I have never tried to sign up in the first place- I never feel comfortable enough knowing that I'm going to deliver.  


Lots of other things can happen from literally the person dying, to the account being frozen, to never noticing the inbox message saying ""here's your secret santa"", to health issues, to mental health issues, to being a small child trying to get free stuff because you lack empathy.  


Remember the Spirit of Christmas for Santa Claus is literally just giving for the sake of making someone happy.  You should be happy you helped someone have a good Christmas.  If you aren't all about giving for the sake of making someone happy, why on God's Green Earth didn't you just buy your own self stuff?"

I don't want people to have to take apart their combo deck.  I want people to have a combo deck that wins on the same turn as everyone else's combo cEDH deck.  Protean Hulk is fine, Flash breaks it though.  What's the fair compromise?"
