I saw this post.  My car has no payments; it's 17 years old.  So, naturally I looked up average monthly car payment and immediately thought, ""so I can't afford a dog?"" But after reading more comments and texting a friend seems like a can afford a dog.  I mean, if you take all the posts here about the cost of dogs, OPs is about the least accurate."
personalfinance,fdrd63g,t1_fdrauhx,1578682828.0,"I didn't realize how many more used cars are sold than new.  But my numbers are still way less misleading than OP.  I've read all the comments here now, and almost everyone is way below $400 per month on their dog expenditures.

The point is clear to you, at least?  Pretty condescending thing to say, really.  I think everyone gets OPs post is a warning about costs involved with specific items.  But, my point, which should also be clear, is that OP is vague to the point of being misinformative.

If you are thinking of getting a dog and instead of being told how much they cost you are told they cost the same as some thing that is actually 4 times the cost of a dog, how is that helpful?"

personalfinance,fdr14or,t1_fdql3jh,1578678042.0,"Yeah, but $20k for 2 (Large) dogs over 4 years is $208 dollars a month per dog.  Average car payment on a new car in the U.S. is $554 a month.  So, OP's post could needlessly prevent some dogs from being rescued.   Because OP saying 1 dog cost $6,660 a year."
