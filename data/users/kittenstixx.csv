television,feovccs,t1_feoqb2t,1579306204.0,"Comparing bouncy castles, shoes, books and concert tickets to products that are legitimately harmful at worst and violently benign at best seems like a stretch.   

When i said personal responsibility what i meant was taking responsibility for your own actions and not looking at external factors such as parenting or society, consequences are real, you cant say to a judge that's presiding over your criminal court case that your parents didn't teach you not to do crimes, its expected of you as a member of society.    

While i believe that companies like goop or televangelists prey on insecurities and they do need to be legislated out of existence that is more my ideal and as i don't really have much say over how those decisions are made and i understand the difference, i accept that."

Denominations are just different ways of interpreting non-core bible passages, as long as they believe Christ died on the cross for our sins and rose 3 days later and that the greatest commandments is to love God with all your heart and love your neighbors(re: everyone far and wide) it doesn't really matter."

But as to the metaphor, the world is run by fat people, they've bought the doctors, the food companies and the researchers, the few that say obesity is unhealthy are looked at as ""fat alarmists"" so nothing is going to make anyone lose any weight and while that information doesn't really effect my daily life right now, I believe it will, but hope I'm wrong."
fatlogic,fcquqvr,t1_fcqq4e8,1577892503.0,"No, you misunderstand my analogy, this isn't a run of the mill fat person, that would have been the earth decades ago, no this is a fat person that is in dire straits and needs to lose weight years ago, so drastic action is what is required.    

NOW, im not a doctor/scientist so i can only interpret the data that's already been collected, and what i can see in a less than academical way, BUT as i said before the consensus among scientists that aren't funded by organizations that have reason to obfuscate the results say we're almost fucked."
fatlogic,fcqm2fp,t1_fcqdvhx,1577888398.0,"Basically what you just said is the same thing HAES 'activists' say about health/dieting.  

It's fucking hard to lose weight, painful im sure, you might not even see the light at the end of the tunnel for some time, but it's necessary to extend your life and live well.  

Same as how it's hard to look at the planet and science consensus and realize if we don't take drastic action we are going to die of heart failure in the very near future, the only thing we can do is eat the bare minimum nutrients and exercise our asses off to get our weight down, if that means going without gas/creature comforts/vacations/etc then that's what must be done."
