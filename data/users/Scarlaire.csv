It gets lonely because there’s not much to do. I’m used to constantly talking to my parents when I’m home so I miss that. But I’ve gotten more used to it. The way I think about it is that it takes time for your own mind to fill the void of company, but it happens. I think this is just part of being an adult. Sucks but here we are and it’s not changing anytime soon so might as well make ourselves comfortable."

college,fc4uu58,t3_eg3dvx,1577429304.0,"I had 5 classes this semester and got 3 B+s, when I was convinced that 2 of them would be As. It’s the weird grading policy of my school. To me honestly I didn’t ever think of anything other than STEM as a career option. I forget there are people not doing science. So it never crossed my mind to do anything else. 

Still decided to minor in another STEM field. So I guess if you really love it you just wouldn’t want to do anything else. Just remember that grades are assigned based on your ability to pass the course and the course isn’t everything. College courses don’t even seem relevant to real life sometimes. 

Bad grades don’t mean you’re not good at STEM"
rutgers,fc1uxkx,t1_fc1frsv,1577330500.0,Thanks! I wasn't sure if we started from the very next chapter itself. It's good to know that we are
rutgers,fc1uw28,t1_fc1g6g7,1577330464.0,Is this honors section easier than regular? Or is the curve bigger? I'm taking 18.5 credits next semester so I'm trying not to make life harder. Also yes can you please PM? Thank you so much!
