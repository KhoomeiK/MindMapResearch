Is good fortune. I have to drive around a lot of Trump Country for work. When you grow up in a place full of closed stores, a Dollar General, a Family Dollar, two gas stations that function as food markets, and a bottle return center as the center of business, along with drug problems all around and a brain drain of the best kids to the coasts - it's hard to see it as good fortune.  And it's almost never talked about on TV. I mean, the greatest shock once I traveled for this job is just the sheer mount of abandoned buildings in these small towns...

> they aren't responsible for the state of society...they are part of the problem whether intentionally or not

A lot of people aren't into the ""sins of the father"" logic(I mean, look where it always leads - to more fighting).  If you're 25 and your Ukranian grandparents came here to flee starvation in the Holomodor, it's hard to blame yourself for historical racial inequalities that literally had nothing to do with you.  In general, all those colonization problems came from England, Spain, Portugal, France and the Neatherlands.  There was no Polish oppression of Africa, for instance.  Most ""white"" people in America now have little direct relations to those countries, or the Confederacy.

Well wouldn't you if the TV is glamorizing people calling you evil, or for punishment against you?  Especially if you've got maybe just a high school education?

The maybes like Romney or Collins are in places less hardcore for Trump.  They can afford to sway, and/or swaying helps them overall.  But most GOP senators have a vested interest in not bending.

(Not to mention that cops wearing masks isn't a real option for ""hiding"" in a day and age where 10 year olds can sneak into a database and just find out who they are.)  But, I'll admit, maybe I'm just gatekeeping my favorite comics and character(Doc M), plus I'm just exhausted at all the race stuff in media.  Now that the comments said she got Doc's powers, I know why three people have told me it was good until the final ten minutes, they it turned to shit.  Do you think this is a show that would have survived without the Watchmen branding and Doc M overtones?  Like, if it was just a show about masked cops and white supremacists and vigilantes, with no association to any comic property or squid rains, do you think it would have even been greenlit?"
