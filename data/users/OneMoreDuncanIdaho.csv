PS4,feg17xq,t1_fefyfka,1579072570.0,"The companies might be able to make up the loss in wages through increased sales though. When I made minimum wage I bought groceries and paid rent. When I got a raise, I started going out and buying stuff like a new tv and ps4. Sony would have never got my money if I was still making next to nothing for example. The real challenge is finding the optimal level, and 15 is probably too high in some areas. 

Now obviously raising the minimum wage too high or too quickly will increase inflation needlessly, but you can't ignore other factors like this and assume that everyone trying to raise minimum wage just doesn't understand math."
