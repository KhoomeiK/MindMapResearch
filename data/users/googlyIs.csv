specialed,ffa8t7w,t3_esif3x,1579730118.0,"For my middle school kids we basically just read them social stories, sometimes ones that were quite direct in talking about masturbation and cleaning up after oneself. 

I’m teaching transition now and I haven’t found a great curriculum and admin is lazy about it. We have a few students where we show them some YouTube videos about consent and how to treat a partner, but so far nothing about STIs or condoms or birth control, which the kids really need to learn about too!"

She could have cognitive delays, learning disabilities, Hell she could even be having seizures when she’s staring off into space, but no one has bothered to push further into this. This feels negligent. It isn’t the students fault!!"
