queen,ff5q9uo,t3_ert52z,1579605826.0,"Looks really disappointing actually. It's just a typical Seiko 5 Sports watch, apart from the dial looking slightly different and it having the words ""Red Special"". It doesn't seem to represent the guitar at all, nor does it represent anything else that is Queen related. 

For a price that is approximately double of a normal Seiko 5 Sports (560EUR/620USD vs 280EUR/310USD) it really feels like a pure moneygrab."

You can check it yourself using https://lichess.org/analysis/rn1qk2r/4bppp/bp1p1n2/p1pPp3/P1P1P3/5P1P/1P1N2P1/R1BQKBNR_b_KQkq_-_0_1 for example"
chess,fdbf0go,t1_fdbde36,1578256738.0,"There doesn't seem to be a forced mate sequence, however something along the lines of Kh5 Rh4 sequence is very beneficial for black. I'm not sure either what ""missed win"" supposedly means, I guess it just means getting an advantage."
chess,fdb9vzt,t3_eki28n,1578255284.0,"Because there's the threat of playing Bh4 I assume after Nh5, which can't be denied unless white plays g3, causing you to at least win a pawn and gain better a better position"

Although I do think it's a beautiful piece, it's not something I'd really wear myself so I'd rather not bring it to a watchmaker. I hoped I'd be able to identify the watch myself by opening it but unfortunately wasn't successful. I still want to give it a try to get to the movement, but it just seems as though I'm unable to open it without damaging the watch, hence why I hoped someone here could provide information. 

And I assume it's the watch in your post history you're speaking about? It looks great!"
