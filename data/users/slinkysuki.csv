Im pretty sure the most meaning you can give your life is helping others and experiencing new things. Everything else will turn to dust and leave no impression, ultimately."

I get 3 wks paid, but am allowed unpaid, which works for me. Canadian.

Every time i travel, i hear Europeans going off about 5+ weeks to start... Plus holidays. Jealous. :("

To me, flex time seems like a no brainer. Have core hours 11 to 3 or something... And let everyone manage their time to best suit their schedule on either side. People will be happier and more productive.

I love the 7 to 3 deal. Get lots done before everyone else comes in, beat traffic going home."
todayilearned,ffo1en1,t1_ffnzu3b,1580073149.0,"I agree, but some companies apparently can't work through the logic. They figure if you have a pulse and are breathing, they can make money having you come in. It's insane."
todayilearned,ffo12l0,t1_ffnb5z6,1580073037.0,"This seems to be a predominantly North American problem. I feel other developed nations realize 2 or 3 weeks off a year is not the way to have happy and productive workers.

I always check if the company allows unpaid time off, because 3 weeks non-work a year is a fucking joke. That's ONE decent sized trip for me. Id rather save my pennies and be able to take a couple more weeks off. I think 2 months of the year would be an excellent amount of non-work."
todayilearned,ffo09mq,t1_ffnl15l,1580072882.0,Pto and sick days should always be two separate things. I can't imagine a company that says otherwise is a good place to work.
todayilearned,ffmo6jy,t1_ffmkyys,1580057204.0,"Thats almost another issue though. Sick days... Like what, you dont trust employees enough to only stay home sick when they actually need to? Sounds like you're overworking them then.

I feel so much better about my job when my boss isnt demanding sick notes or making me feel even worse when i decide I can't come in. You trust me to do my job, but not to know when i need time to recover from illness? What?

Studies have shown unlimited sick day plans work. The best places i have worked all behaved the same way: ""you're sick?! Oh no! Sry to hear that. Rest up and we'll see you when you're all better!""

End of story. And you infect less co-workers that way. Easy peasy."
AskReddit,ffh02xw,t1_ffgxkvg,1579919514.0,Thats how I read it. Shes wasting her time because he would never do that to her.
