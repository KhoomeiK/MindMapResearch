Since you obviously don't comprehend this, allow me to explain. Boomer as an insult doesn't refer to the age group as in you're from '65, rather that you think in the crotchety old man ""technology is bad"" mindset. It is possible to be a baby boomer, and not be a boomer. Likewise, it is possible to be a millennial like yourself, and be of a boomer mindset.
So fuck off."
darksouls3,fff4bcy,t1_ffek2tp,1579875339.0,"Well, if you want my personal favorite single player game series, try metro. It's a super well done concept, the environment is super in depth and well done, the story is great in the second and third game (the first is still good, just not as good as the others) but for combat it's still kinda lacking in skill requirements. The hardest difficulty is hard though.
Otherwise, another one of my all time favorites is Titanfall 2. It's got a great campaign, and is a game more about mastering the movement mechanics rather than gunplay. Story mode has decent difficulty, but it's cheesable by just running past the AI. Multiplayer is awesome though.
But for difficulty games online? I have a list, Hunt showdown, super intense, very difficult, high risk high reward gameplay that forces you into tough situations. Rust and pubg too :)
Good luck!"

aww,ffan7a7,t1_ffam7b5,1579739899.0,"I'm gonna answer it anyways, it doesn't matter as much that it's wet, what matters is that there's a barrier between it and the ground. I really don't get why you're pursuing this further, like what was the person supposed to do? The dog would've tried to get out of the hoodie if it was placed ontop, as it did in the video, and you don't know the financial state of this person. They might not be able to take the puppy in, or they could be allergic. It's like adopting dogs from a shelter, you can adopt a dog, and be a good person, but adopting the whole shelter is too much. Basically, they helped, that's all that matters. Just because you don't think it was good enough doesn't make it any less of a good deed than it was."
aww,ffaldff,t1_ff9zvns,1579738647.0,"Well, actually no. While yes, the sweater is most likely going to be wet, it will actually do a better job of protecting the puppy than putting it overtop or just about any alternative. The amount of heat that you lose to the air is extremely low when compared to the amount of heat that you lose to simply touching the ground. Have you ever touched rocks or metal on a normal day? If you have, you probably remember it being either colder, or hotter than the air because both of these hold and drain heat much, much better than the air does due to their density. So, since the ground is denser than the air, it soaks up more heat from you than the air does, and will make you colder faster. So by laying down the hoodie, this person made a barrier between the puppy and the floor in order to minimize heat loss. Sadly the puppy still gets wet this way, and the hoodie will most likely get wet as well, but it's still the correct choice."
