Im bisexual, and I got called a TERF for saying that, if I was dating someone, and only found out they were trans when it came to sex, I would be pretty upset and probably end the relationship - and for saying that lesbians shouldn't be expected to date trans women if they're uncomfortable with the idea of male genitalia, and vice versa (this was during a discussion over a video in which a lesbian was savagely beaten by a pair of trans women for rejecting their advances at a gay bar - the two trans people were then praised online for 'showing a TERF what happens').

I'm genuinely curious if this actually makes me a bad person, and what your opinion is on the subject? I have no issue with trans people, any more than I have issue with anyone - I respect all genders and will call anyone by whatever they ask, it's not like I don't think they're real men/women."

No. But, when you really don't have much, those luxuries mean everything - make you feel like youre actually worth something in the world, something to make you feel a little better on a tough day.

Yes, the car is not a necessity - it's a gift, a birthday gift, and, technically, the mum has every right to take it away. But using it as a bargaining chip is a major, major dick move - and saying that every gift you give is with the expectation of something back... No. Its for an event - a birthday. 

Quite clearly, the mother already said their kid could do it, forgetting that their child has their own life, and now feels too awkward to admit they didn't ask the child first - so, they're making threats. How can you defend a mother trying to force their 16 year old to work over their birthday, anyway? Kids should get to enjoy their birthdays before they have no choice but to work over them.

No one carries a baby that long then suddenly decides 'actually, I don't think I want this anymore...'

There was a case in Ireland, which at least up until recently was strictly no abortion, where a woman died because she had a partial miscarriage, but, her body failed to expel the dying fetus. This was found out in a hospital. Despite being examined by doctors, they refused to do anything to help her, because of the strict laws, until it was too late for them to save her - and she died of sepsis due to their inaction. The fetus would not have survived even if she hadn't died - but, due to their laws, the mother was also doomed to die.
