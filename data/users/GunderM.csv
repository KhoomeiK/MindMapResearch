PublicFreakout,fe01lyp,t1_fdy33f2,1578800819.0,"Communism is more of the political system anyways. Socialism is the economic system that falls under a proper communism. Generally, a market economy is what we experience in the world today which is a blend of government intervention in failed markets. We don't see let it be capitalism or open capitalism much anymore because if one group gets too much power, they control too much of the system. Essentially creating a monopoly over multiple markets and owning all the supplies of production. This is why we have anti trust laws which essentially is a government intervention of capitalism for the social benefit.
