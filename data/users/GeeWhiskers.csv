Allowing someone you don’t trust in a public setting to share a bedroom with you is every kind of nope.  Give yourself and your friend permission to put your safety first, the answer is no. It’s not cruel, it’s necessary."

They were delighted with the length of time it took Joe to figure out that they were not refusing to let him on the wifi and that was the actual password."

dogs,ffbegaa,t1_ff974wk,1579761790.0,"Our bully mix didn’t howl until she was 9! It’s a soft sweet wooo, and it’s generally sirens that start her off. The others (6 year old  female shepherd mix and 6 short and tubby male mutt) don’t howl at all. He tries to howl though and it’s a weird yip/yawn/bork thing. Pathetic but entertaining."
dogs,ffbe59e,t1_ffanken,1579761442.0,"Our shepherd mix softly growls in her sleep. It’s a little like a purr, just the sweetest sound."
husky,ff307t3,t3_era3v1,1579530145.0,Hmmm.  I would have guessed a wolf and sheep mix.  So fluffy.
AmItheAsshole,fewrtba,t3_eqpkz1,1579418540.0,"In nature, weak and sick animals are taken by predators. We protect our pets from that, which sometimes means that we have to take the sad but necessary decision to end their pain. If OP’s wife sees God in nature, perhaps she’ll come to understand."

The prize has to go to our cats who licked the icing off a coconut cake, but left the coconut. Cake had coconut carefully spread all over the de-icinged top."

AmItheAsshole,fewn6c7,t1_few625p,1579415425.0,Anyone who says kids won’t understand or remember can get stuffed. I am still scarred from a flogging scene in Mutiny on the Bounty when I was supposed to asleep in the back of the station wagon at the drive in.  So much old in that sentence.

AmItheAsshole,fef9261,t1_feesp5h,1579051057.0,"I live on a 6 house dead end street. 4 of the houses (including mine) are empty nesters - some boomers, some Gen xers, all who’ve lived here 25+ years.  The other two houses have younger families and honestly it’s been great having kid noise again. One of the houses is a little noisier than I’d like, but on the two occasions I’ve gone over there in 5 years because of noise, I asked nicely. Too loud music? Hey you don’t have to turn it off, just down.  Kids shrieking in the pool? Yelling is okay, but please not for hours straight (and never call for help as a game). Some people young and old are assholes, but often being respectful can solve neighborhood issues. 
As for OP, it’s all down to HOW loud the kids are and whether OP and offspring are expecting the neighbors to accommodate their lifestyle without taking the neighbors lifestyles into account."

AmItheAsshole,fecvw95,t3_eofyl9,1578986706.0,"NTA.  Life is full of potential embarrassing situations and your lack of freak out shows her you’re not ashamed and though embarrassed she shouldn’t feel shame either. The hurdles get higher as kids grow and letting her know that she can come to you with “girl stuff” is great. That woman is the sexist AH, fathers can support girls and mothers, boys."

dogs,fdptahs,t1_fdohbjj,1578639621.0,"Your story and pup sound a lot like ours. One Christmas Eve a sweet puppy was surrendered by her in-humans because she’d gone into heat for the first time. She’d have been euthanized that day because her scent would have caused fighting between the intact male dogs, but the staff called rescue groups until they found one that would come get her. We later adopted her from that group and she is the bestest girl. We are grateful to the staffers that took part of their holiday to go above and beyond and to her foster mom who cared for her until she became an important part of our family 9 years ago."
