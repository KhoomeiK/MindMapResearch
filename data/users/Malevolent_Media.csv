TheDepthsBelow,ffw78he,t3_evfjsm,1580287608.0,We had snapping turtles back in uni when I studied animal science. The husbandry teacher emphasized how much we need to use the long tongs to feed him. When someone asked why he showed us the tip of his pinky finger was missing.
skyrim,fft40ci,t3_euyhft,1580205905.0,"Don't worry, it's just a flesh wound."
AmItheAsshole,ffrzr86,t1_ffqn8ob,1580169648.0,And I don't blame her.
AmItheAsshole,ffrzpkw,t1_ffqp20s,1580169617.0,Saves you the trouble of telling everyone. I thought when you get engaged you WANT to tell everyone? You're definitely the AH.
AmItheAsshole,ffrzkbs,t3_eup5jx,1580169518.0,YTA. You didn't ask if it was okay to propose ON THEIR special day. Not the time or place.
JUSTNOMIL,ffq6wpp,t3_eukyr2,1580123727.0,"Do not let that woman anywhere near your child, husband or you! Yes definitely file charges and get a restraining order! I really hope your baby, you and your husband are okay.
Also you should get a paternity test done and send the results to her alongside the restraining order. Just to rub it in."
TooAfraidToAsk,ffq6aft,t3_eukwcp,1580122803.0,"Not everyone does. Some people think meh this is my life, others change it or even enjoy it. I once new a guy who worked in the same place for 20+ years and said he often cries because he hates it so much. Yet he still works there. I don't get it. But some people like their 9-5. 
I never understood how people could be happy with being born, educated, get a job to pay other people so they can live, maybe have kids, if you're lucky have a few years retirement then die. How can you not want to do something more with your life? I'm 25, in debt, moved 9 times in 3 years and had 5+ jobs in those 3 years.
But now I have a job I love and pays well, I'm slowly paying off debts and plan to start saving for a house of my own. I don't want kids so don't have to worry about that and I find pleasure is the little things in life. But I still find life mundane and struggle to see the point in life or why I'm here. Guess I just...am?"
aww,ffii5ya,t3_etpock,1579974441.0,My mum loves sloths and I can see why she thinks they are cute. But this video always gives me the heebyjeebys! It's so weird! I might send it to her...
RATS,ffihh8l,t3_etswlu,1579973981.0,"One of my boys scared the life out of me a few months back. I heard a thump from that cage, out of the corner of my eye I saw something fall. I see the shape of a rat on the bottom of the cage, he has fallen off of a platform and slammed into the floor. I screamed for my husband, just about to burst into tears. I go to touch him and he jumps up like nothing was wrong. Luckily he hasn't done it again. God damn Squeakers!"
oddlysatisfying,ffih1c8,t3_etmk75,1579973681.0,"It reminds me of those plastic strings we had back in school, Scoobies I think they were called? I could only make the spiral pattern and never got my head around the square one. Man I miss those."
childfree,ffibj4r,t1_ffibcuz,1579969939.0,THANK YOU! I'm so suppried they said no even after my diagnosis and mental health. So instead I've got to take birth control until the menopause gives me peace of mind. Not looking forward to that but hey.
UnresolvedMysteries,ffibe0k,t3_etk6rl,1579969841.0,"As she thanked the cousin for everything, maybe he helped her escape? He may have set something up so she could go somewhere, have the baby safely and live the rest of her life. Or maybe it was a case of him getting her pregnant and found someone who said they would take the baby as payment and in return, look after her?"
childfree,ffi9z6r,t1_ffhzfce,1579968864.0,"I've been asking doctors for years. Each of them say no, I'm too young. I'm 25. They said when I'm 30 they may consider it. I told them my husband and I do not want kids and I have serious mental health issues, they still deny me. It sucks."

IsItBullshit,ffi8w2a,t3_etesz5,1579968100.0,My understanding is teeth aren't supposed to be pure white anyway? I've tried some whitening gel/pen thing on and off for a few months. I don't really see a difference plus it tastes so bad.
childfree,ffg07z0,t3_etbrar,1579895640.0,The same with gender reveal parties imo. It's like hey we are reproducing! Give us stuff so we don't have to buy it! Because kids are expensive.
AmItheAsshole,fffkdms,t3_et8zc8,1579885851.0,"NTA. Your mother needs help and therapy. Contact a GP and tell them your concerns. I understand that losing a child is hard, but she must remember here others are still there and you all need each other. Wishing you and your family the best."
AmItheAsshole,ff9ft9t,t3_es8oxf,1579712095.0,NTA it's his kid as well. He doesn't need to be thanked he should be doing it because you know...it's his kid as well?

AmItheAsshole,ff4avbl,t3_erfvwt,1579559335.0,NTA she presumed you'd let her have the dress without formally asking you.
TrueCrimeDiscussion,ff3lpqt,t3_erdx2j,1579543724.0,"Bundy Bundy Bundy. A lot of people have asked me to cover him on my channel and I'm really reluctant to do so. Mostly because I know I will end up going on a rant about how I'm sick of seeing people go all uwu over him and calling themselves a 'fan' of his. 

I spoke to a woman who had photos of him in her house, nearly a shrine, another who named her kid after him. I told them both it was so disrespectful and I'm sure they'd feel differently about them if a loved one was killed by them. But of course they didn't care."
britishproblems,ff3l8dq,t3_erbmjv,1579543427.0,"I constantly see people on Facebook ask what local takeaways are open? Does anyone have a number for a taxi? What time does such and such open? 
Apparently writing out a huge Facebook post asking for something and explaining why they need it is easier than googling it. I don't get it."
NoStupidQuestions,ff2pu7k,t3_er1vm8,1579518442.0,"I have an app on my phone that automatically blocks known spam callers, or comes up with a warning that someone else has reported it as spam. I don't answer unless the spam warning doesn't come up and I'm expecting a call. Other than that, I ignore it. If it's that important they will leave a voicemail or email/text me after saying who they or the company was and that they tried to contact me."
JUSTNOMIL,ff03sdi,t1_ff032xv,1579464847.0,"He understands my feelings towards her. He trys not to mention her but I guess sometimes he forgets? If he does I tend to change the subject. It's usually when he talks about stuff he's done rather than her specifically. I wish I was okay with her but after all that's happened, I don't think I want to."
JUSTNOMIL,feyy550,t1_feyumza,1579451888.0,"Oh trust me, if she ever shows up at our place I'm immediately calling the police. Luckily she hasn't got my number, dodged a huge bullet there!"
JUSTNOMIL,fey65os,t1_fexyy39,1579441312.0,Tbh I wouldn't put it past her.
UnresolvedMysteries,fexmwwp,t1_fexligk,1579433450.0,"I did a whole documentary on her and looked at the autopsy files. Yes she wasn't taking some of he medication, but some tablets were on a take when needed basis, not daily. So she was missing some of them. There are theories ranging from murder, suicide, an invisibly cloak theory and a theory she was used to spread TB. Ultimately, I think it was either murder (which to me makes more sense after looking into it all) or unintentional suicide...so an accident I guess? I'm thinking maybe she met up with someone she met online and something happened on the roof. John Lordan did a fantastic series on her case and gave me some of the files he had sourced. He looks at the footage, the autopsy, her social media etc. Highly recommended!"
JUSTNOMIL,fexm2ah,t1_fexljot,1579433206.0,"Man that's a weight off of my shoulders, thank you!"
