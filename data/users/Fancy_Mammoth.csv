The first sentence in your comment 

>You're best bet is to look up how to make your own fight stick out of a PS4 controller

I read this and all of a sudden, something just clicked. I've been approaching this all wrong!

Problem 1 - I kept using the term ""PS4 Controller"" in my searches instead of using its proper name Dualshock 4.

Problem 2 (this is the part that makes me feel like an idiot and makes you the genius) - I've been trying to find some kind of DIY guide or unofficial documentation on the data sent to and from the controller. If that didn't work, I was considering picking up a Bluetooth sniffer to try intercepting the data. Over excited me was thinking more like a ""hacker"" instead of a software engineer.

Once I started thinking like a developer again and using proper search terms, I finally found what I was looking for, the developer documentation and communication protocols published by Sony for the Dualshock 4 controller.

Please accept this shiny as a small token of my appreciation. I bestow it upon you using the last of my Creddits for somehow causing my brain to reset my train of thought.

First off, mom has been around the dog for a while and has developed antibodies and immunities to fight off what the dog may have. If carried to term, the baby start receiving copies of mom's antibodies at the 3rd trimester. While these antibodies are weaker than the ones on mom and will take time to grow into a full immune system, the fact that they are present provides at least some protection against disease.

Secondly, if mom is breastfeeding, then that baby is continually getting new antibodies from mom as she is exposed to more and more germs in the real world. These antibodies pass through breast milk and further strengthen the babies immune system and as a result, breast fed babies tend to get fewer infections and recover more quickly than non breast fed babies. 

>Breast milk contains many elements that support your baby’s immune system. These include proteins, fats, sugars and antibodies and probiotics. When a mother comes into contact with germs, she develops antibodies to help her fight off the infection. These are passed to the baby in breast milk. As mothers and babies are usually exposed to similar germs, this means the baby is protected.
Breastfed babies have fewer infections and get better more quickly than formula fed babies."

The last program she was in was a Dual Diagnosis program that focused on the mental health aspect of addiction and made it a point to involve and edudate the friends and family of the patients. You had to go through a screening interview process and sit through an hour long presentation on supporting a loved one with addiction and how their mental health has a huge effect on their addiction. They basically wanted the friends and family to understand addiction for what it is as opposed to the stigma associated with it and teach you how you can help them recover and provide them support without enabling them in any way. 

A lot of the staff at the program were addicts with a significant amount of sobriety under their belts or people who have worked/lived with them for long enough that they understand what they're going through. My advice, try to focus on what's going on in your head before you tackle the addiction. It's a lot easier to get clean if you've got your head squared away. Otherwise, all of the stress you're experiencing will push you to the edge and make you want to drink/use. Most importantly, and I cannot stress this enough, take things One Day at a Time!

dayz,fdi977h,t3_el0rcb,1578437990.0,"Bear in mind that Bullet Drop and Rifle Zeroing are a thing in this game. Most people, maybe not you Idk, don't know what bullet drop is, how to adjust for it manually, and how to zero their weapon.

* Bullet Drop - Bullets don't travel in a straight line. They follow an arc that's determined based on the velocity the projectile is fired from the weapon and gravity. For most rifles (large caliber rounds with high powder loads), the bullets arc becomes steeper around the 100m mark. Handguns, shotguns, and other small caliber firearms typically (but not always) start to drop around 50m. For example, if you're engaging a target at 200m on level ground, aim your scope center mass, and pull the trigger, the bullet is more than likely going to hit the dirt instead of your target.

* Rifle Zeroing - Some rifles/scopes have the ability to compensate for bullet drop by allowing you to adjust the ""zero point"" (where the cross hairs meet) of the sight. Adjusting the zero changes the pitch angle of the sight slightly so you can aim at targets straight on instead of aiming up. Using my precious example, you're engaging a target at 200m, this time you adjust the zero on your rifle to 200m, aim center mass, pull the trigger, watch the bullet hit your target instead of the dirt.

* What if I can't zero my rifle/scope? - Unfortunately, you'll have to do it the hard way and adjust your aim manually. If the scope you're using happens to have little dots on the cross hair lines then you're in luck because the scope is already doing the work for you. These dots are called MIL dots and the distance between each dot is equal to a distance of 100m off zero at maximum magnification. What this means, using my previous example, is if you're engaging a target at 200m with a 100m fixed zero rifle and a scope with MIL dots, you'll want to line the first dot BELOW where the cross hairs meet with your target before taking the shot to account for the additional distance.

You can also use a MIL dot scope to estimate the range of a target without rangefinders. I'm not going to go into the details on how it's done, mainly because there's math involved and there are plenty of posts online explaining how it works.

Russian PU/PSO scopes make all of this even easier by building a range finder into the scope and marking each range modifier next to its cross hair in the scope.

Hope this helps some."

AdviceAnimals,fcgrlol,t3_eh6z99,1577643358.0,"Good for you! I can only imagine it was a difficult road, but 1 year is a major milestone and if you keep putting the work in, and take things 1 day at a time, it will get easier and things will get better. Keep up the good work, stay strong, and remember; you're not alone, and there is help available.

Not to steal OP's spotlight/moment, but I would like to take this opportunity to remind everyone that this can be a very difficult time of year for addicts/alcoholics, especially given that addiction in any form can be coupled with mental health issues like depression. If you are struggling with addiction or mental health issues, don't be afraid to look or ask for help or talk to anyone. Admitting you have a problem or that you need help is the first step to recovery, NOT a sign of weakness.

If you know somebody struggling with these issues, DO NOT, under any circumstances, try to force them into getting help or into recovery, blame them for their ""choices"" or act like it's their fault, and most importantly, DO NOT ENABLE THEM! 

The first step to recovery is for the addict to admit that they have a problem, that they are powerless to their addictions, and that they need help, and most of the time, the person has to hit rock bottom before they can recognize any of this. If you try to intervene and force them into something they aren't ready to do, they're less likely to trust you when they finally are.

It's important to keep know and keep in mind, that addiction IS a recognized mental illness. People with addiction didn't just wake up one morning and say ""I think I'm going to become a heroine addict today"" or ""I'm going to go gamble away my life savings at the casino"". Their brains are wired differently than non addicts, so much so that the rewards and pleasure centers of the brain will produce up to 10X more dopamine than normal when engaging in these behaviors. Addiction hijacks the brain and over time physically changes the personality of the person into someone you won't recognize anymore. It's not their fault, it's biology. Blaming somebody for being an addict at its core is no different than blaming blaming somebody for being depressed or diabetic.

Not enabling an addict can be extremely difficult if it's somebody you care about. But for their sake, and yours, it's one of the most important things you can do. Enablment can come in many forms such as giving money, supporting their habit, looking the other way etc. If they come to you asking to borrow money for something, either decline or physically go with them to get it. Gift cards may seem like a good idea, but to an addict they're as good as cash since there are vending machines and stores that buy them and you can sell them on the street for less than they're worth.

What you CAN do, is educate yourself on addiction and learn more about what you can do to help. It's more than just showing up and putting on a bright face and acting like you care. You have to be willing to deal with the bad days and the setbacks, and accept the fact that like anything else, this is a process and won't happen overnight. ALANON (and the other variations) meetings are the greatest resource at your disposal, they're support groups for people who have friends and family struggling with addiction and are looking for an outlet or help. The most important thing you can do though, is just be there and remind them often that you love and care about them and want to seem them well. 

If and when they choose to get help, let them know that you're willing to be there and support them through this difficult time in their life, but don't push, let them come to you. Remember, this is probably one of the hardest things this person has ever done, so it's important that you tell them often that you're proud of them for making this decision and the progress that they've made, remind them of the progress they've made, help them keep a positive outlook on the future, and to take things ONE DAY AT A TIME!

I've been helping friends and family battle addiction for several years. It never gets any easier, and it can take a lot out of you. So make sure to take care of yourself first, you're no use to anyone else if you're own life is out of control or unmanageable. Another important and hard reality to face is that you can't help everyone and sometimes you have to just walk away. The problem with addicts is they live life with blinders on and don't think about how their decisions can impact others. If you feel like you aren't getting anywhere and things are just getting worse, walk away, they obviously haven't hit their rock bottom yet and until they do, you're just going to end up enabling them.

If you read all of this, good on you. Again, sorry if I stole your spotlight OP, I just felt like this was a good opportunity to spread some helpful information."
