AskReddit,ff80j45,t1_ff7um8b,1579662830.0,No kidding. Add to that stomach issues and it's really a miserable time.
offmychest,fetncqb,t1_fem2lq1,1579377162.0,"I have a theory about this (might be wrong, who knows).   When you're stressed, you suck your stomach in, to the point that you're constricting your ileolocal sphincter (between right hip and belly button), making it tight or even herniating it so that it cannot pass food to the small intestine.  The ileolocal is almost certainly involved in indigestion in most people who have this issue.  There is a chiropractic adjustment for a herniated / tight ileolocal -- I know what you're thinking, but it _really worked_ for me.  That and constantly working to relax my stomach.  

Probably TMI but I'll just leave this here in case someone can find benefit."

offmychest,fellglw,t1_fel56gd,1579225004.0,"The stomach thing, yep.   Few understand this -- but if you don't have your health, you don't have anything.  You can't do anything.  Feeling like shit ruins your life.

About the bread thing -- have you tried a liquid diet?  I basically make something ""soylent"" and consume it exclusively for meals -- corn starch, whey protein, glucose, etc.  Was a game changer in terms of quality of life."

Really would love to do temp control with a premade.  I used to have an RDA but frankly I don't enjoy building."
wallstreetbets,fcm0xbz,t1_fckdi9d,1577761355.0,Thanks.  Forgot that professors can be prestigious.
wallstreetbets,fclvjbo,t1_fclsbwe,1577757498.0,IB's at just about 3% now that interest rates have dropped :)

Economics,fce0hbw,t1_fc8iyuq,1577615664.0,This is exactly the concept I was looking for.  Thanks you!
Economics,fc7y6v2,t1_fc7fotu,1577521786.0,"I think insurance is fully to blame. Medical insurers do not make what seems to be a large profit percentage - but I believe they have a perverse incentive to pay more money out to medical providers in order to justify larger premiums, even if it seems counter intuitive.  The more money flowing, the larger that percentage of profit is in nominal terms.  Although ostensibly insurance companies negotiate prices downward, I think that medical providers and insurers work together in some sense to spend as much as possible, to increase overall net cash flow."
