Briar rabbit would lick his feet and jump in the air, this meant to run in water and climb a tree to avoid the dogs. His coat was also noted of being thick so he can hide in the briar patches. Hide in thorny past thorny areas so they wouldn't fallow. My family from Savannah Georgia area.

Then you proceed to annoyingly convince them to just accept it. Where you find the most difficulty is keeping them hooked.  My tactic is responding with over simplified and most likely false armchair psychology and that accepting my love with make them feel better. To add more annoyance maKe sure you correct any grammer or spelling errors they make. Another key part is to never define the type or intensity of love. Your love lies anywhere between love for yor fellow man to straight up sexual and obsessive. If you want to end the conversation, implant some creepiness have have your love suddenly escalate in style or intensity. I did this on world of warcraft and i managed to find where the guy was questing so i set my character to fallow him making everything that much creepier
