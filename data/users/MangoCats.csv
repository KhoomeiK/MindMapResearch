Yes, it has some really shitty design choices like overly thin wires carrying heavy current with insulation that ages badly.  However, proof in the pudding, 60K miles has so far cost us only $5K in maintenance, and most examples do run like this.

Alternatives we were looking at at the time included things like late model low miles Hyundai Sonatas, but they were like $20K+ a) we don't even have $20K in the old Merc yet, b) the Hyundai wouldn't have been totally maintenance free, and c) we only had to front $12K - the maintenance money just dribbles out as needed.

So - before you bring it up - the Merc only gets ~21mpg and requires premium gas, so, yes, it does cost more gas money than the Sonata, but the $10K we've spent in gas still would have been $7500 in the Sonata, so even with gas money difference, the Merc has still been cheaper so far - and... it's bigger, more comfortable, faster, etc."

Yes, they are, however... the locations are carefully chosen, the breaks are long and as you can see from the photo the waves are actually quite small.  Helpers are usually about waist deep standing on the bottom.  Also, the boards are large, stable and buoyant (not sinking shredders), which means that someone with just the ability to not tip the board over can be given a push into the wave and ride the break a long long way unassisted.

It's a great program, very rewarding for the helpers, and a great experience for the participants.  It does involve long days in the sun, exposed to the elements for many hours.  The amount of pre-planning and scheduling that goes into the events means that things like jellyfish in the water are often ignored - I was a helper in a jellyfish infested event in Daytona Beach and a couple of days later the toxin was messing with my facial nerves making me think I was having a stroke.
If you like making people smile (participants AND their families), like the beach/water/sun, and have the slightest inclination, you should see if you can hook up with an event like this as a volunteer - jellyfish infestations are rare."
