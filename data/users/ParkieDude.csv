So it was more a confirmation of ""Damn, dude you've Parkinson's for most your life but never realized it"".  Nothing would have changed, no medical treatment to prevent progression, the only thing that seems to slow progression is exercise, eating right, and getting a good night's sleep.

Still, lots to learn about Parkinson's."

Thank You.   I had a wonderful Nurse who noted ""Parkinson's"" on my chart and made sure I had my Sinemet postop to get me up and moving!

Lung Cancer, so docs went with DaVinci to get my lobe. I told my wife ""45 minutes, pretty quick surgery"". Thoracic Surgeon found his first lobe with multiple arteries/veins. My blood supply didn't branch with one artery and one vein, but four arteries and five veins. Doc called in experts from across the USA to see if anyone else encountered that. Finally opted to trim out cancer as best as he could.  Five-hour surgery. My wife was a wreck.  Poor PACU nurse couldn't get me awake but realized it had been six hours since I had meds, so got me meds and 15 minutes later I was up waking.

Oh, my medication was effective to 90 minutes, but I took it every three hours. Preop took my Sinemet (with sip of water) and was animated and chatty.

I find my best relief to be from intense exercise (boxing) or getting out into nature (run, cycling) just helps my mind disconnect from pain.

Normally you take levadopa in pill form. Empty stomach. Full glass of water to move into the small intestine to be absorbed.  

I've done too much water, but with outside activities. 100F Texas day I wasn't getting enough electrolytes, too much water. In my case I had zero Potassium levels. So it messed up heart signals, mimicking cardiac issues. Solution would have been a bag of potato chips! Since then I use caution, but drink something like Skratch Labs when on long distance cycling. Katy Flat Land Century was 85F 85% Humidity, so 130F Heat Index. Kept hydrated, oranges and bananas at rest stops and managed to keep on cycling! I ride a three wheel recumbent.

First time, after taking medication my arms loosely swung at my sides an I kept thinking ""what is wrong with my arm, why it is doing that? It didn't feel natural.

My college girlfriend told my wife in college I wouldn't hold hands and complained my arms hurt doing that! She also explained to my wife it was I would often fall over after getting up. 

I learned to run three years ago, and loved it. I had knee surgery (both knees) last month and orthopedic surgeon explained I probably should have opted for knee replacement on both. So no more running, but still cycling and swimming. I did manage to take my dog for a two mile walk which felt great as a week early I made it a 1/4 mile but turned around due to pain.

I suspect Mom had Lewy Body but it was early on. They ""good days, bad days, show days"" become apparent her last few years. I lived out of town, so when I showed up it was ""Show Days"" (everything was great, she put 100% effort into that day). My sister was a hospice RN and had warned me ""Mom isn't doing well"". We had a great time Saturday Afternoon I told her we would take her out to breakfast as I had a late flight. Plans set, next morning Mom didn't remember we had made plans. She knew we went out, but didn't realize it was the day before. Bad day.  Since then, and knowing friends living with Lewy Body I can see how much in confuses close family.  Mom passed away a few months later, respiration pneumonia.  Still a blow."
Music,ff7aqxb,t1_ff71r3e,1579644866.0,"Everyone with Parkinson's progresses at different rates.

The key to delaying progression is exercise.

Our nerves work, our muscles work. Out mind has a harder time, so we start taking smaller steps. After enough time those steps become a shuffle, eventually, we end up in a wheelchair.  Muscles atrophy. So exercise is critical. Getting the right support for Physically Therapy is critical.

I got the point I couldn't get off the floor without assistance. I couldn't get out of a chair. Thankfully a local Husband & Wife team opened a Parkinson's Boxing gym. I had met them earlier in Parkinson's exercise (we did not use weights, all classes were for all levels). So with their gym, it was focused on assessments so we had four levels. As a result, I had classes that were peer level. I am competitive so it helped push me. Plank for 60 seconds is difficult to do solo, have a class with 20 people all with Parkinson's and I can do it. We do plank taps (Plank, right hand taps left shoulder). Peer pressure!

The more I work out, the more I can do. 

My medication made a world of difference. Finally got the point where I maxed out on medication but qualified for DBS (deep brain stimulation) in 2016. I did something I never thought possible, learned to run! Freinds with Parkinson's do marathons, yes 26.2 mile runs. So I would join them, run, walk, run. Couch to 5K. Finally did a 5K run! Dead slow but loved it. Last year I learned to swim! Knees are trashed, but I can still swim and bike.  

Enjoy every sunrise and espresso is a great way to start the day!"
Music,ff79blh,t1_ff6uzj7,1579643744.0,"Ouch!  One of the criteria for DBS is ""responds well to levodopa medication"".

So take medication every three hours, but only had 90 minutes of ""on-time"" so all my errands (Costco) had to be done in those 90 minutes. Frustrating.

So I was considered an ideal candidate. Passed Neuropsych eval, did great when on medication, no other outstanding medical issues.

Sleep is so critical.  For me ""too much"" medication was almost as bad as too little. Visual and auditory hallucinations so if things didn't seem right I wouldn't leave the house.  I was sleeping three hours a night, just horrible.  Exercise is my biggest key (wear myself out so I can sleep). Five hours a night of sleep and I'm doing OK."

Took about six months to get DBS dialed in. Would do it again (1% due worse; 4% no improvement; 95% do better). If he has heart or other issues they do not recommend DBS due to risk of surgery.

Alzheimer's is we lose all memories. Basic functions like how to walk or who is the room. Often playing music from their High School/College days will show some cognition is still present.

Haldol, aka ""Vitamin H"" by the nursing staff, is a great antipsychotic for Alzheimer's. For Parkinsons or Lewy Body it can kill them and cause permanent damage. Hence the staff needs to be told ""PDD"" or ""Alzheimers"" as opposed ""He has dementia"" so they know what they are dealing with. 

Agreed on caregivers need respite care.  Eventually Dad may need full time assisted living, hard to know what that will be the case."
CaregiverSupport,ff61mf9,t3_erk4w2,1579616826.0,"What about setting up a small kitchen on the ground level floor. Small fridge, microwave, sink.

This allows a caregiver to use stairs and ""say hi"" as they come and go (he has his bedroom for privacy/sleeping).  

The Biggest concern is ""if he fell and couldn't reach a phone"" how long before someone discovers him?  I was out changing the oil in my truck and couldn't get off the garage floor for four hours. Thankfully my son stopped by and helped me up, but I didn't fess up about how long I had been on the floor. Since starting my boxing works outs I can not get up off the floor by myself (we have to practice on getting up without using our arms in class, harder than it sounds)

Dementia, by definition, means we forget thigs. PDD (Parkinson's Disease with Dementia) is different than Alzheimer's - so be specific with medical personal that as treatment/drugs are different.  With Alzheimer's a friend's dad forgot how to stand, he would fall on the floor. So a much higher level of care. With PDD we have balance/stability issues but remember how to use a walker to navigate the flat. 

I'm 36 years into Parkinson's. It started when I was 25, at 61 still active. My boxing classes (for Parkinson's) help with keeping me active both physically and mentally.  My memory is not good, fine during the day but I don't drive at night.

Pulse Oxigen meters are cheap $30 on Amazon.  Take it with you to your Doctor's Appointment and compare to their machine.  Even the good brands will have about 3% that just don't read correctly. It should be with + or - a point of the fancy medical machine. Still an amazing device.

OK, EVERYONE stand in the doorway. Shoulders back, back straight. Heels, back, head against the door frame. Breath. We need to work on our posture to inflate those lungs! Practice this a few times a day so you don't get into the habit of hunching over. Hunching over is not good, lungs are compressed, can not inhale/exhale with a full breath.  

Notebook: Once in the hospital keep an 8x11 notebook to jot down what the doctor said. Patient/Caregiver will be sleeping at times and ask the other one ""who came in, what did they say"".  Date & time each note:  Doctor's name; summary. Leave space at the bottom for questions (they will be back and having those questions written helps both).

CPAP - take it with you for surgery and hospital stays. Disinfect with 70% alcohol. (70% alcohol as the water permutates into germ cells easier than 90%)

When I was 25 a Neurologist commented he thought I had Parkinson's but it was so normal for me, nothing had changed. I was an avid cyclist so his comment was I was too young to have Parkinson's and should keep on riding.

Now at 37 years later, it is clear it was Parkinson's.  I did learn to run btw, a few years ago. I kept falling. Went way too fast downhill, but damned if I didn't learn to run.
