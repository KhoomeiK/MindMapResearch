The One drive folder is synced to the local machine.  Oddly, the file extension type (.mpp) is set to open with Adobe Reader which cannot be changed.  I'm thinking it might have something to do with this?"

Entrepreneur,ff37uz2,t1_ff26lte,1579535765.0,"It could be my market but I guess I'm not sure.  I know there's a lot of computer sites out there with guides for certain things; however, I feel mine is a little different.  I like to post guides that are hard-to-find for people meaning there's not a lot of sites with these guides.  And I'm not sure about other entrepreneurs."

Paranormal,feoyqmu,t1_felv7bn,1579308299.0,Did you ever try talking to them? I wonder if you could've gotten closer to them by trying to communicate more.
Paranormal,feoynec,t1_felx3ur,1579308241.0,Thanks for the reply! I don't know why I do it but I love the paranormal yet I'm a little baby when I go downstairs by myself in my current non haunted house after reading an article or watching a show. Stuff is creepy

Paranormal,femkipp,t1_felvxh2,1579260158.0,Not sure if it's related at all but my mom despised alcohol growing up.  She's now in inpatient treatment for alcoholism (just went a few days ago).  She started drinking because she couldn't sleep at night about fifteen years ago.  Sounds like something a demon would do.  Thanks for sharing!
personalfinance,feltge5,t3_epu78j,1579230511.0,I also think it depends on how much you like each company and position.

personalfinance,fe6b7bb,t3_eny5ej,1578885990.0,"You're thinking of filing bankruptcy on $5000? You're thinking of offing yourself because of $5000 debt?

What you need to do is go to school, take out a loan to pay for your school, apply for grants to pay for your school, earn a degree in something you love doing, graduate, find a job, make more money than you're making now, pay off your debt, meet a sexy lady/man, have some kids, buy more shit you don't need but now you can afford. 

Bankruptcy for $5,000 doesn't sound like a good idea and some may see it as an easy way out. 

Offing yourself for any amount of money is pretty stupid."

The fact he was going to hook up with another girl is the same thing as actually doing so in his heart. I think he's more sad at the fact you guys are pretty much done more than the fact you slept with another guy even though that was probably the thing that made the water boil out of the pot. Good luck. I apologize for being harsh but I'd say stop wasting time and move on,"

tax,fcqqoen,t1_fcpklfc,1577890673.0,"Social Services thinks that we can claim them if they are with us less than six months and no one else claims them or if we have had them longer than other families.  So for example, we had one child for four months.  Someone else may have had him for 3 months, and another family for 3 months, and then another family for 2 months.  Since we had him the longest, we can claim him they think.  Otherwise, he goes unclaimed.  Thoughts?"

relationships,fcpf2lq,t3_eietgd,1577861194.0,"Im 29 and wife is 39. We shoot for once a week and 99% of the time,  I am the initiator.  I  have told her that I feel wanted and loved when we are intimate and how it is important to me. She has been working on it more but I also have to remember, she may not be in the mood for a lot of reasons which is most likely not me. 

Additionally, I've been trying a few other things. Not pushing her as much anymore. Letting her decide when to initiate. She knows that its important. 

A lot of marriages fail because of sex but sex is not the problem, it's the desire. How can we change our desire? What can you do, or not do, to get her into the mood more? Stop pushing or initiating for a while. See what happens.

Also, if take care of yourself more to somewhat make her want you more. Work out. Dress nice. Do things for her and your relationship."

relationships,fcki062,t1_fcke2dt,1577725764.0,"I'm sorry that you feel this way. All I'm saying is that everyone has needs. 

You may be giving your boyfriends what they need and they may just be losers who you tend to attract very easily OR perhaps your boyfriend  isn't getting his love cup filled. This could be physical touch, quality time, words of affirmation, gifts,  and acts of service. Read the five love languages by Gary Chapman. If someone isn't feeling loved through these methods, I believe it could lead to cheating. 

Additionally, I also believe you need to show confidence, strength, and independence in a relationship. Don't settle for losers unless you believe losers are your standard. 

Most of all, have standards. What do you want in a person? A ""badass"" with tattoos who likes to drive big trucks that he can't afford?  What about someone who treats others with respect?  What about someone who takes care of their things? Has a clean car? Can afford a car? Or what about someone who plays video games more than they spend time with their kids from a previous relationship? Someone who has a job? 

Set standards, be confident in who you are and what you want in life and what you want in a relationship."
