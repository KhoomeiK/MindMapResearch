It hasnt been coopted so much as it has been shoved in there lap after a bunch of 4chan people decided to see how many people would actually buy onto it by making a few memes. Same thing with pepe the frog. Its not a white power symbol, it still means OK.

 I went to an amusent park a few months ago and specifically remember seeing a little sign with instructions for employees with a picture of hand doing the OK symbol, and they use it to communicate to the roller coaster operator that everyone is locked into their seats and ready to go. Nobody actually believes the ok symbol is racist except for people who really want it to be true."

cripplingalcoholism,fessoas,t1_fesc5uv,1579368613.0,"Yo I got divorced at 23, I got married at 21 like an asshole. It really does fucking suck but it needed to happen. Spent a lot of years single, dated but nothing really serious for like 7 years, at first it was intentional but eventually I wanted a serious relationship again and I was real lonely. But I just focused on trying (and failing often) to improve myself, now Im in a great relationship with a girl who just wants to make me happy and that goes both ways. We argue sometimes but never yell or freak out. I dont get drunk as often as I did during that time (which was 5 to 7 days a week) but I still do once or twice a week. You sound like youre in a crazy relationship and its not too late to find someone who doesnt do crazy shit like cheat on you. Im 30 now. After that divorce I also dated a girl who cheated on me at a festival, we broke up right away, I cant just go on pretending things are ok after something like that.

Just my experiences and thoughts on the matter."
