phoenix,ff9fp58,t3_eseiox,1579712025.0,Still lots of tweekers everywhere but beginning gentrification along dunlap/7th street. That area has potential to be nice in a few years.
arizona,ff62u83,t1_ff5pfmu,1579617729.0,I didn’t know this was an issue. what makes it terrible for the ecosystem?
azdiamondbacks,ff62gsh,t1_ff5p9s1,1579617456.0,He actually wasn’t brought up in the Mitchell report. That would’ve been big news too

azdiamondbacks,ff61wn1,t1_ff4eep5,1579617038.0,"Wait, why you bring Womack and Finley into this? 

Finley was known as a guy who took impeccable care of himself. The announcers used to talk about how he’s the best conditioned player in the league. I would be extremely shocked if he was using steroids"

phoenix,fersqtg,t1_feooi5t,1579357962.0,This is not just “an employee committed a crime” this is systematic neglect of patients by the entire staff and if the management is unaware of these conditions then they shouldn’t have applied to become a manager
phoenix,feobo19,t1_fenxkfr,1579297788.0,"Management absolutely is responsible. Their job is solely to make sure the place is run right, which it clearly isn’t"
movies,fenhyal,t1_feltcd9,1579285079.0,"Watched this movie a couple weeks ago after not seeing it since I was a kid. First I can’t believe how many times Paxton’s character just bails on his fiancé to ride with Helen hunt and she just goes along with it most of the movie. It’s still entertaining, and the characters are all pretty well written. however it is so 90’s and the CGI is pretty dated. Would be awesome for a movie like this to be released today with newer technology. 

This was the first movie we watched when Dolby 5.1 surround came out and I remember looking outside to see if there was really a tornado because the sound was so epic!"

Frugal,fcs1cah,t1_fcrvneq,1577909896.0,"Also I would be skeptical that machines are made cheaper now, and more likely to break sooner. 

Rather than an 18 year old tank that was built with quality parts, you now get a bunch of plastic that breaks in a few years, and a lot of times the cost is high because they’ll market it as “smart” or something but skimp on the product"
phoenix,fcrdcvh,t1_fcqsxex,1577900313.0,The thing about the death penalty also is that if we expanded it’s use we also expand the precedent of it’s use. There’s an old saying like better a criminal lives than to kill an innocent person.
phoenix,fcqstqs,t1_fcp5uuf,1577891670.0,"Why are you so concerned about “illegals” getting free health care when it’s the healthcare companies and drug manufacturers that avoid taxes and live like kings while ALL of us pay the price?  

It costs next to nothing to provide healthcare to poor people with the profits the healthcare industry makes. 

You’re being pitted against “illegals” by very wealthy and powerful people who want us to fight over pennies"
phoenix,fcqrdus,t1_fcqqb72,1577891014.0,"A lot to unpack here but just wanted to point out that the death penalty is a lot more expensive than life in prison, because there are a lot of appeals that happen and the drug itself is costly, and prison is definitely not for rehabilitation in the US"

todayilearned,fcoccul,t1_fco7qce,1577828783.0,"People are misguided about the realities of homelessness in general. Job programs are nice and I’m sure they help some but the vast majority of homeless are mentally ill/abused past the point of functioning at a traditional job. 

There should be a return to subsidizing mental health services and begin to end the stigma. Most facilities have shut down over the last 30-40 years and most social work is either volunteer, minimum wage, or a heavy mixture of both. 

It’s going to require lots of people to become more compassionate to help the greater good though."
