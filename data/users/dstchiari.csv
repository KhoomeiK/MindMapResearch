No one in my family, extended and otherwise, has lactose intolerance; only me and only since I did the course of cipro. Maybe it was just a coincidence, but I don't think so."

I've never gotten to see one in person. :( Most of the flying I do is domestic, so I don't go hang out at the international terminal where they'd be at."

NCLB really stripped the funding out of home ec and other courses at my school. :(

I don't think Husband's school required home ec; I just know he definitely didn't take it."

insaneparents,ff017oc,t1_feyt0zo,1579464044.0,"I avoid it, too, if at all possible. It's just hard when I visit my dad and stepmom because they're hardcore and insist on everyone going to church with them. E v e r y o n e. Mormons, non Mormons, etc.

My mom is a lot more accepting, though she has a hard time with it because she wants to go to the temple with me and stuff, and I can't go. She's come to respect that I am LGBT, as well as that I'm more spiritualist than religious."

AskReddit,fevw55v,t3_eqies2,1579402193.0,"While I was away at college, I had a nightmare that one of my parents was cheating on the other. I woke up, and I *felt* that it had happened. I hadn't talked to my family in weeks at this point (we were kind of ostracized from each other at the time), so I had no news on anything that was happening in their lives.

I was depressed all day. I gave up trying to do my homework or play video games. I went to my room and read a book, but the depression just wouldn't go away.

My cell phone started ringing. I saw it was one of my parents, and I just knew. I already knew what the call would be, but I answered anyway.

Sure enough, the other had been cheating for weeks, if not months, and they were getting a divorce.

yay"

It's been beaten to death, but report that to the school and the police. This isn't a haha-you're-funny. This guy shouldn't be trusted to be alone with anyone. Get him expelled/removed from tutoring/etc before he sexually assaults or worse someone."
funny,feti7i8,t1_feta14d,1579375680.0,"Because I manage and track our finances better? He's not good at it at all. When he did the 82 degrees thing, I showed him the gas bill for keeping our house between 70-72 for a month, so he respects the cost a bit more.

If I made my point too confusing, he was the primary income for our house for a long time, but I was still the one who made sure the bills got paid and kept track of our income and expenses. He doesn't ""not pay the bills"" in the not giving me the money to pay the bills sense. It's just he doesn't know how to manage the money, keep track of bills, pay those bills, etc."

Told him to put on sweatpants, socks, and a sweater like the cruel, unloving wife I am.

Also came home one day to it 82 in the house. Got mad at that one. He doesn't pay the bills, so he doesn't appreciate what it costs to get the house that warm (hell, what it costs to keep it between 70-72F)."

Yeah, the con smell didn't seem to be so bad this year, compared to DragonCon and anime cons, but I was a mobile booth babe, and we usually stayed in more open areas that didn't have the chance to reek."
justneckbeardthings,feikxoe,t1_fecqj3g,1579140935.0,"Oh, dang, I totally missed that, but I didn't get to see much of the con (was working). Did they have MTG/DnD/etc there, and was it by those areas? The last con I went to, that was where it reeked the most. Main floor was fine; gaming areas were gag worthy.

When I walked through the PAX-W con hall this last year, it didn't seem to smell too bad, but I wasn't waiting in lines for things where it would have been noticable."

Not sure what set off the detectors; they were the interlinked ones, and they weren't fancy enough to say which one triggered them.

Doc even suggested it to help me relax and get in the mood to be intimate with my Husband and enjoy him with less pain, and it's a good way to get to know your body so you can better enjoy being with your spouse and communicate what you like with them. Mutual masturbation can be fun, too. 

Masturbation isn't an evil thing and doesn't keep you apart from your spouse. It's normal and natural, regardless of what the clergy says."
