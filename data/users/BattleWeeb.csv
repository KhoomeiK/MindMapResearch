If so, the driver was kind of a dick for not letting you go and get it.  But I've seen so many times where a customer will tell me the package is ready, and I'll wait, only for them to come to me with an open box and loose items, telling me to just give them 5 minutes.

After that happens a few times, you get a bit jaded.  Not making excuses or anything, though."
MaliciousCompliance,fewv2xe,t1_fewqy5d,1579419948.0,"In my opinion, it's both.

&#x200B;

Yes, the seller's return policy is garbage, and basically impossible to enforce.  That's a problem with the seller, sure.  But as a buyer, you gotta ask yourself, ""Hey if this mattress doesn't work out, how do I get it back to you?  How do I recompress this mattress back to its shipping size?""  You end up buying something that expands to way beyond its shipping dimensions and you end up basically stuck with it.

Even if it's partly on the seller, OP isn't taking it out on the them.  He's taking it out on the guy doing this return calltag."
MaliciousCompliance,fewo5e6,t3_eqrfyl,1579416735.0,"> UPS comes to pick it up, and says they can’t take it because it isn’t in a box. Anyone who’s ordered a mattress online knows there is Noway to get one of these beds back into its box.

Which is a flaw with the way these companies ship these mattresses, not a flaw with UPS policies.  That box wouldn't even fit in my truck if it was empty, let alone if I had deliveries or pickups to make.

&#x200B;

We can't take returns if they're not in a box because it'd be a liability.  The return tags likely wouldn't stick and without any protection, the item that's being shipped would get absolutely destroyed.  I feel like this stuff is common sense.

Why are you making the driver's job harder because you lacked the foresight to not buy a mattress online?"

Thing is, I didn't have his package.  It got left behind at the facility, apparently and was scanned remotely as (attempted delivery).  It sucks because it makes the driver look bad, when we didn't even do anything wrong."
