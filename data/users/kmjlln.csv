 I'm one of his girl friends and this is what I've noticed: girls like him because he's nice, harmless(not sexualizing us in any way), knows to stop and apologize when he makes someone feel uncomfortable, he's nice to old people and his parents, he let girls do harmless physical contact(hugging, holding his hands/wrist, putting his arm on their shoulder) and let's them initiate it instead of him, he helps people when he can but he doesn't let people take advantage of him, he's respectful, he's nice to talk to(listens when he needs to and shares his stories/opinions when needed) and most importantly, despite having a lot of girls around him, he only show actual interest to a girl he likes and doesn't give false hopes to those that he only see as friends. 

He's not gay but he definitely get all the gay bestfriend benefits that guys wish to have. He gets invited to  girl only sleep overs where he got 2-3 girls cuddling him, our parents trust him, we don't feel uncomfortable around him and he lives like a harem king with hella girls confessing to him. Currently, he doesn't have a girlfriend but he belongs to my circle(me, 2 girls and him) and he always look like he got 3 girlfriends and he get all the wholesome benefits of having a girlfriend from multiple girls. 

TLDR:Just be nice, wholesome and stop being creepy."

Most of their stuff comes from china, korea and japan and I've found multiple harajuku style clothes, nice jackets, dresses and 'rock band'-ish shirts. There's also a thriftstore for shoes just right in front of Valenzuela People's Park and most shoes costs like 400-950 and they have class A nike, adidas, yeezy, etc along with thrifted maybe-branded shoes."

I've seen reaction and food review channels slowly evolve into a channel that revolves just around making content for filipino fans and some of them even ask their fans to fund their trip to the Philippines.

 I don't get filipino priders at all, they want validation from other countries but they think their own country is shit and they don't like filipino content creators."

I see r/ woosh being thrown everywhere even when the r/ thing doesn't work on other platforms and it doesn't fit the context. When I started using reddit I've also had people reply r/ woosh to me just because I replied on the joke with something that isn't sarcastic or complimenting how funny/shitty the joke is even though I'm well aware that that post is indeed a joke.

AskReddit,fcw1858,t3_eixc75,1578014794.0,"I tried both tinder and facebook dating(because it was more convinient)and all I get was guys who got the yellow fever. I also get a lot of weebs who think I'm some sort of waifu just because I look like a fucking child on my pics(I think I can be used as a pedophile bait bruh). 

I don't look as good as my pics irl so I always have an issue when guys are into me because I think they're just there because of the pics but at the same time, of course I wouldn't want to put ugly pics on my profile and I'll only display the best ones. 

So far I've only had 2 guys who I was kinda into and I chatted a lot with but now I'm backing away because they're sending pics of them flexing and stuff and I think that's kinda cringe. I live in the Philippines and I post a lot of pics of my food on my IG story and one of the dudes I talk with asks for the recipe of those food and he cooks it so he can try it(he lives in UK) and I think that's kinda cute but I'm not that into him either(looks wise). Maybe I'm just not into dating in general cuz I always find things to nitpick even though they seem like nice people idk. 

I also get easily tired of talking to people. Like for the first day I find an online friend or a guy who likes me, I talk with them a lot and we'll have interesting conversations but the next day I'll be too lazy to reply or have a conversation so we don't usually continue the relationship. I feel like replying to people turns into a responsibility so I just don't reply. In general, I think a relationship is a responsibility and I don't want any of that. I just want to know that I have someone I like who likes me back that I can hit up when I'm in the mood to talk or hangout but I don't need to tend to whenever I'm not feeling it.

I haven't tried video games from xbox and stuff cuz that shit's expensive in my country so I mostly played online games. I've played both shitty girl games on Y8 and also some shooter games like special force whenever there's a vacant pc on the cafe. Good thing my dad was also addicted to playing rpg and shooting games so he didn't have any problem with me playing with the guys renting pc on the cafe. My dad also had a thing where he levels up an account on cabal and he gets payed for it and sometimes he's selling rare in-game items to people in other countries. Those years were one of the most precious memories because the guys I play with are so nice and they even let me borrow their accounts sometimes even though I'm waaay younger that them and I'm not that good at games. I used to play flyff, fiesta online, luxor anmum, plants vs zombies, ragnarok, special force, half life, super granny, supercow, dota, o2jam, cabal and counter strike. Nowadays I don't really play that much pc games anymore because pc cafes suck now and people treat you like shit when you're not that good even though it's just your first time playing a game. I don't own a pc so the only chance I get to play video games is through pc cafes but pc cafes near my house smells and the overall hygiene is not that good, the internet and the computers suck too."
