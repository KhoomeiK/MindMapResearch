depression,ffa63hd,t1_ffa0mih,1579728608.0,Exactly. Ignorants think that depression is just a smart word for being down. So they'll just give you some bs advice on drinking herbal tea and thinking positive.

atheism,ff5g4xh,t1_ff4g7c7,1579591393.0,"On the other hand there's no point in bringing up any philosophical arguments with a paranoiac person such as this particular lady. The ironic comment meant to show that everything in her behavior is contradicting the belief system that she suppodedly is a follower of (pride and anger being deadly sins to begin with). Such a person would behave the same whatever she believed in, so ""converting"" her would not change anything. Would she be more acceptable if she defended atheism in the same way? I don't think so."

atheism,feyo3q5,t1_feximnj,1579448098.0,"You know, with Christians you can ask an individual's opinion on an aspect of religion, but it doesn't work with Muslims - Islam had banned any polemic with the mainstream teaching so if you ask someone their opinion they will most certainly consider it a sin merely to ask. People do read the Quran regularly but usually in Arabic which is an incomprehensive lanuage to most so they basically have no idea what they're reading. They follow the interpretation of local imams."
atheism,feymucg,t1_feximnj,1579447705.0,"With the current government it's becoming less and less secular. The religious extremism has become more common than it used to be. I'm working at a company of very religious people so I guess I will not inform them that I gave it up - othereise I might get in financial trouble. Religion is treated dead serious here in its every aspect and although it does not include legal prosecution, you do get socially ostracised if you don't play along. However, due to the intimate nature of circumcission it's very likely that no one will ever know except his possible future gf or a doctor."
atheism,fetcm21,t1_fetb000,1579373954.0,If you tattoo a kid most people will say it's wrong because the kid may not like it in the future but for some reason it's usually OK to do any atrocity in the name of religion. It's a sick world and I hope our kids or grandkids can fix it someday.

If one day he decides he wants to play along with the local rituals, he can have it done on his own account.

atheism,fet7lyz,t1_fesnp9s,1579372482.0,"First of all, I'm not a guy. Secondly, I said I didn't want to do that (and actually decided not to). I posted the question because I get biased opinions around that I absolutely must do it no matter what. It's not exactly a culture where people ever question their beliefs so there's no point in arguing with them - I can just do what I velieve is right. The reason for the question was to find out IF they have any means to force it in a way - mostly asked to people familiar with the local regulations as I don't know anyone unbiased by religion here irl. And yes, doctors are biased, too."

NoStupidQuestions,ferwm0j,t3_eqee9g,1579359056.0,Still some orthodox muslims prefer iodine or hydrigeb peroxide instead of pure alcohol for desinfection (accordingly they use oil based perfume instead of the alcoholic ones). I think it depends on the particular school of islamic law that they follow.
introvert,feq10st,t3_eqclnt,1579335843.0,"My friend back then taught me a good strategy for that (although I'm not sure if it's culturally relevant everywhere) - on your first day, and it's crucial that it's the moment the first see you, just walk up to every single person in your group, say your name, smile and shake hands. You don't have to actually talk to them as it's just a swift runaround. After that they will consider you a positive person even if you don't talk much later on. It worked every time and helped to connect with some people who later turned out to be like me - just not confident enough to make the first move. It also reduces the threat of becoming the invisible one later on. Good luck!"
Neverwinter,fepziu0,t3_epvqvu,1579335271.0,Tried the methods available to me but still it gets too hopeless. Thanks to all of you anyway - at least I know where I need to get better. More luck next year I guess :)

introvert,fejzil5,t1_fejvybx,1579189373.0,"That reminds me when I was little and cell phones were not yet commonly used my dad's boss called him on the home number. He told me it's his boss and I should say that dad is not home. Ok, so I did: ""hello sir, my dad said he's not home"". :)"
introvert,fejv7an,t1_fejmhst,1579186607.0,Sounds almost like the meme about the introvert convent that no one came to :) we want friends like us but can't talk with one another. I'll start working on that.
introvert,fejkztg,t1_fejk2it,1579178438.0,"I do reply sooner or later. It's just that it's annoying if the small talk messages happen every day and never go beyond how are you, how's the family, etc. Like... the family and me are pretty much the same as yesterday. I see your point though. Never thought about it this way. Thanks for pointing that out."
depression,fejjsar,t3_epguj3,1579177186.0,"After all these years I kinda learned to love the darkness in me. I can even joke about it sometimes. It just sucks having all that crowd of people around and yet no one like me. I used to suspect that maybe I have some sort of physical defect invisible to myself but seen by everyone else. Now I believe I'm just too weird to be had around so as long as I don't find another weirdo to vent our troubles to one another, I don't think I can fully recover.
However - and that's why I'm posting it - after two suicide attempts and a period of heavy psychotic trips I can tell that it is possible to have a normal (in many ways even successful life) with the condition and if you learn to accept it (I'm not saying it's easy and doesn't need med support) - it somehow becomes bearable. It's like a scar - it's obviously there for a lifetime and itches every now and then but it's only a part of you, not the whole you. 
To the very young of you: I've been there and I know it feels like an eternity, but believe it or not it gets easier with time (a long time unfortunately). The more you live the less you pay attention to everyday troubles. Even bigger traumas get buried in the past sooner or later. Then one day you live something unexpectedly good and believe that it was worth staying alive for. Now you believe that it will never happen - naturally - but it can come the day you least expect it. I dtopped thinking of duicide with the though: I can do it just anytime so why specifically now? Procrastination does save lives sometimes, I guess."

depression,fdqc5ev,t1_fdqbdzb,1578662659.0,"You're right. I had an early stage cancer - taken care of in time so I didn't become a hairless skeleton, just functioned with huge doses of painkillers until I had the tumor surgically removed. I'm also not the type of person that would complain on physical pain in public. So even with the reports I was told at work that I'm probably not really ill because I don't complain. We have a collegue drama queen who cries on a papercut so when she had a tooth surgery she was given a 2 weeks leave because she looks soooo ill. With people like that around I gave up seeking support."
depression,fdqaugc,t3_emnl5m,1578661498.0,"I think it's because psychiatry is not popularly considered a medical branch. It's hard to get an objective report on some conditions (apart from extreme ones). If you have cancer, you have MR pictures (or other test results which are repeatable and will always get the same outcome) and it's hard evidence which can't be disproved by another specialist. Psychiatric conditions are hard to prove in an undeniable way. That doesn't change the fact that social awareness is close to zero and people like us tend to get brushed off when it comes to moral support. No matter if you can prove it or not you do need help which many don't understand."

Most people believe that depression is a lower mood for some time (thanks, mass media :/ ) and can be healed by some mysterious Positive Energy supposedly coming from people that won't shut up. Did you try to explain that this is a long term condition (possibly permanent)?
I'm in a similar situation but was also given only a short leave and an advice to Think Positively (eyeroll). Depending on the level of awareness in your country, you may need a support from an expert - a more detailed report from your doctor maybe?"
depression,fde3866,t1_fddu7jp,1578330182.0,Not yet but thanks for asking. Need to get to the doc but too busy with end of the year accounts at work. I'll go after 2 weeks depending on the available appointment. I mean I'm not as bad as I used to be but I still have anhedonia and lack of energy and motivation. Working in an open space office full of extraverts doesn't help. I snapped last month so I suppose I left the meds too early.
