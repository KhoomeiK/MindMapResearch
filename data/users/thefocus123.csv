Dub itself was/is a name brand wheel company that specialized in oversized wheels.they're not cheap either. Some wheels start at about 3k a pop. that at the time was the allure. Buying a fully loaded 50-60k SUV, then slapping about 20k worth of wheels on top of other expensive yet subtle modifications. Dub was a flashy but classy type of culture. That culture died in the down of the crossover car. The last of cars to see dubs in Mass was the Chrysler 300c. Cars just aren't big enough anymore, nor do they hold up to the modern/classic looks dubs require to pull it off."
