socialskills,ff2fuue,t3_er330d,1579504362.0,"I would recommend looking up some information about what women like in a relationship. Most women do not like it when you are constantly texting them, or badgering them if something ""Is wrong"". If you feel like something is wrong the best thing to do is hang back and not text her.

The next day she texted me saying she fell asleep (I don't think this is the truth I just don't think she knew how to respond, but it's cool I know I made weird). I made a joke in reference to something I said the night before which she laughed at. Then I said I enjoyed her massage from the other night and could use another one. She only gave this a thumbs up, so I think I turned her off or she was mad at me or something like that. I figured it was best to give her a couple days of space before talking to her again."
