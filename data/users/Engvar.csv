personalfinance,ffe080f,t1_ffdza37,1579833336.0,"You can put just about any stipulation in a trust. I've got a client that has one for his adult son. It will only pay out once he has 18 months of consecutive clean drug tests, then it will pay a set amount every month, with mandatory drug tests every six months. Tests are all paid by the trust too. 

If he makes it to a certain age without having qualified for a certain amount of withdrawals, the rest will be donated to a charity that helps addicts.

That being said, adding all these stipulations makes it a nightmare to administrate."

news,ff62lj9,t1_ff5zsh7,1579617552.0,"I tried to buy a revolver a couple years ago. Lady was in her late 60's, didn't want it, was afraid of it. She told me the serial number,  brand and caliber, we decided on a price, and the serial number came back clean. 

When we met, it was a different brand from what she said, and it was also loaded and the hammer was back. She said she'd cocked it a couple years before trying to unload it, then got scared and wrapped it in a towel and put it in the closet. 

I called a friend in law enforcement to run the serial number with the correct maker this time. Came back stolen. Turns out her husband was in a gang, and gave it to her after someone mugged her on her doorstep. She had left him a couple decades ago because he would beat her and her kids. She thinks he's dead now, but is afraid to look for him in case he can find her.

When I told her it was stolen she started crying. She was afraid that the police would ask where she got it, and it would bring her husband back into her life. She was away from that life, her kids were grown, and she's in a relationship with a guy she can't marry because she's afraid to file for divorce in case the old husband is still alive. The way she reacted was one of the saddest things I've ever seen. 

I took it from her, unloaded it, cleaned it, and took it to a buyback. Gave her the $50 Walmart gift card I got for it. She's such a sweet old lady. We swap recipes now."

Everything is streamlined to move from raw up to the sandwich making station. Frozen chicken goes into the thaw cabinets, next is the breading station, next to that is 4-8 pressure fryers and 2-4 grills depending on the size of the store.

When you find it, check the time, then sit tight and farm.

If you find it at 11:20pm, that means it will run until midnight, biome lasts 1 hour, and shifts on the hour. So you found a spot running from 11pm-midnight.

The next night it will be in the same place, one hour earlier. So be ready there at 10pm, and you'll get a full hour. I finished the quest in 2 nights this way. Got lucky and it was at my house.

Longbows and crossbows can pack some incredible power. Crossbow bolts also tend to be shorter and thicker than arrows. The type of tip also matters, as there are different designs for hitting fleshy targets and doing the most damage, or tips for long range accuracy, and others that would be better suited to penetration."
