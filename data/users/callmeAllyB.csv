LifeProTips,ff7o9v7,t3_es2z6h,1579654329.0,"Also, smoke of any kind is bad for you. Less poison is still poison. If you want to encourage someone to quit smoking, don't put a bunch of pressure on them, it will just stress them out and make them want to smoke even more. I keep a pack of nicotine gum in my bag so if I'm having a conversation with someone and they want to move it outside so they can smoke I say something like ""can we stall your need with some nicotine gum?"" And then add something relevant to where we are (""its really cold outside"" ""they won't let us out with our beers""""I dont want to loose the good table"" ect.)"

LifeProTips,ff7mwfo,t3_es280p,1579653363.0,"Also, don't get the person having said baby Newborn size! (Or at least not everything in newborn) babies grow like slime mold looking for food. You turn around for a minute and they are 2"" longer and 5lbs heavier when you look back. Spread it out amongst the sizes and try to think ahead for weather appropriate clothes. My niece never wore quite a few newborn items because she grew out of that size too quickly. Now she's almost a year old and all her outfits from the baby shower aren't warm enough (all short sleeves amd shorts but its still 50°F outside) 

Get baby clothes from Thrift Stores! Buying new kids clothes is a scam. They grow so quickly that they only wear it 2-3 times then it doesn't fit. With baby clothes people end up donating brand new, never worn clothes because the baby either never fit in it or they grew too fast to wear everything they got in that size. (I know my sis ended up donating things that still had tags on them!)"

Parrots are very social birds and doing stuff like teaching them tricks, talking to them, ect can help prevent anxiety, boredom, and social distress.

aww,fekrb07,t3_epl478,1579205985.0,"Friendly PSA time! While Jun is adorable, her owner is dedicated to having a fox. They are a lot of hard work. Please dont get a fox if you arent prepared to have a destructive, hard to train, one to two people only, wild animal in your house. Even ""domestic"" foxes are still very in tune with their wild instincts and habits. If you want a cute cuddly fluffy animal that will love you unconditionally, get a dog or a really friendly cat. If you want to help save foxes, both wild and fur farm rescues, donate to your local fox foundation/rescue or wildlife foundation/rescue.

Tl;dr: this fox is cute and her owner is dedicated but, wild animals dont make good pets and require lots of hard work. Let them stay in the wild and donate to organizations that help keep them there/rescue them from cruelty."

I usually make it a rule to check under my hood if the temperature has dipped below 40°F and I drove the previous day.

aww,fcozu9u,t3_ei42qh,1577846190.0,"Friendly PSA time! While this guy is cute, please don't let your feline companions become overweight. It impacts their ability to jump, groom, balance and just be a cat in general. Its very hard on their joints and can drastically reduce their lifespan. Be sure to follow serving size suggestions set by their vets and if you aren't sure, check out the pet food container. Cats may seem to be difficult to exercise but a good hard play/hunt session of about 60 minutes a day is enough for most adult cats. Some even enjoy walks outside on a leash! (Solid exercise before bed can help reduce midnight zoomies!) Cats can live 20+ years and part of making sure your feline friend lives up there with the record holders is to keep them healthy."
