I wish you all the best."

abusiverelationships,fdxr984,t3_enb7z0,1578772140.0,"I can relate to your feeling.
I haven't talked with this abusive ex for about three weeks, but can't stop myself thinking about him every day. He treated me like dirt; everything is about him, forced me to accept an open relationship so that he can still sleep around with different women, especially those women are older and less attractive than me. I don't see my value when I am with him."

Congrats!"
cats,fclng2y,t3_ehtaum,1577751913.0,"Let me in, slave! LOL"
