Youniqueamua,ffdlqjw,t3_esuo35,1579823561.0,I will say that she did a way better application of that spider mascara than most huns can manage.
reddeadredemption,ff7mena,t3_es3vs8,1579653026.0,You can still do all of that after the story concludes.
Youniqueamua,ff66ulb,t3_erw2y1,1579620535.0,Why do the selfies often feature people staring at their own preview image instead of the actual camera lens?
reddeadredemption,ff65xzy,t3_ervy8l,1579619925.0,"My favorite bits of foreshadowing come from the blind prophet. 

I happened upon him during my second play through (when I obviously knew the ending) and it was chilling how the guy warned me with crazy accuracy what was to come."
unpopularopinion,ff0tc3w,t3_er39dc,1579472066.0,No. Only someone ridiculous would care about that.
Instagramreality,fenfddg,t3_eq3l50,1579283495.0,I’m getting serious Billy the Puppet vibes.
CrewsCrew,felzx7r,t1_fbge3mp,1579235357.0,Icelandic Provisions is the shit. Vanilla is my favorite.
Instagramreality,fela2le,t3_eprg13,1579217363.0,"Her face photographs well, but I watched a recent tutorial video of hers and the mouth area moves like a hyperrealistic mask. Freaky."
AmItheAsshole,fel9bjn,t3_eprhfn,1579216881.0,"NTA. They seem to be engaging in some bad behavior and can’t recognize you. My advice is to let it fizzle instead of telling them directly. Stop accepting invites to hang, and they will stop inviting you."
trashy,fekwnbh,t1_fekw39t,1579209134.0,"A glottal stop is the exhale of air after the closing of the glottis. When you say well in everyday speech, we maintain the pitch of the “L” sound longer and without the fricative expulsion of breath. The sound just tapers naturally with no closing of the glottis."
trashy,fekh89d,t1_fekh4o6,1579199989.0,You right. I recant!
trashy,fekapb7,t1_fekak4t,1579196112.0,Why can’t they just say “well?” The meaning would be the same. The glottal stop is more for color in speech.
trashy,fek9w93,t1_fek9h70,1579195640.0,"That’s fine. I was more so just musing and sharing my perspective. I guess people don’t agree lol. I’ve always been a fan of established rules because they are useful for clarity, but it’s a fair point that language is fluid and can change whenever."
trashy,fek991a,t1_fek8s8t,1579195256.0,The issue is more that she (and everyone else who does this) wrote an entirely different word that has its own meaning.
trashy,fek8iyc,t3_epm8l6,1579194830.0,"I hate when people say “welp” when they are trying to say “well” with a glottal stop at the end.

Edit: I learned there were some gaps in my understanding below. Welp is legit!"
AmItheAsshole,fek85it,t3_epm6uf,1579194609.0,Is this a joke? It’s your internet service and he’s preventing you from using it. You know you’re NTA.
fatlogic,feifssh,t1_fei0qcq,1579137516.0,"Same. I would doctor mine with extra butter, heavy cream in place of milk, and extra cheese. Soooo good. Super calorific. Still didn’t stop me eating almost the whole pan."
TooAfraidToAsk,fehsby2,t3_ep8ip6,1579122899.0,You’re thinking about it too hard. Put them where it feels natural! I am personally a fan of grabbing biceps and butts.
justdependathings,fehs4dq,t3_ep8jfa,1579122780.0,Ugh. Barf.
fatpeoplestories,feguhax,t1_fdqqt6h,1579102806.0,"The coffee thing is no small feat. It’s really hard to give up that tasty sweetness that starts your day! 

Same thing was a breakthrough for me. Now drinking a coffee like I used to take it is gross - overwhelmingly sweet!"

52book,fegjjt1,t3_ep1y5x,1579094715.0,I love that book. Check out Brian’s Winter also!
reddeadredemption,feghya0,t3_ep20nd,1579093329.0,"I kept all that stuff besides the horse, as far as I remember!"
RedDeadOnline,fefevqt,t3_eovqvt,1579054849.0,"Finish all the story missions first. Find treasures using all the treasure maps you get.

Go visit Madam Nazar, start collecting. Nice little experience bumps throughout the game.

Then, get the butcher table to start trading. Focus on close deliveries, as the money isn’t that different and the xp is the same. 

Get Moonshiners. Do the story missions and start making flavored moonshine batches and selling them to the right buyers for good prices. 

Alternate between hunting, exploring, filling your trading wagon, and making moonshine and goods deliveries. 

Use special ammo, try for headshots, and shoot from your horse as often as possible. All give extra xp for each kill!"
curlyhair,fefdegp,t3_eov30n,1579053916.0,I got a devacut and my curls have never looked better! Go to devacurl.com and find a stylist in your area.
TooAfraidToAsk,feeoqtd,t1_feeomli,1579038054.0,Seems unlikely. Just be kind to your D and take it easy with the blanket. See a doctor if you’re still concerned after a few days.
TooAfraidToAsk,feenvju,t3_eoruhb,1579037548.0,Why not just go to the doctor to be sure? Does it hurt?
curlyhair,fee86kr,t3_eopg5k,1579028392.0,"They have worked so well for me. Never crunchy, and really holds curls together and keeps frizz at bay once you’re dry!"
fatlogic,fedwstj,t1_fedu29y,1579021548.0,I just started doing the same. I have been having 2 squares each day that carries around 130 calories and has reasonable macros. It has been hitting the spot for me and actually made me appreciate the flavor of chocolate more!
