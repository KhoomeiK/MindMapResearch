If you do put a fan on a VRM heatsink it should be blowing directly on a heatsink. Details don't really mater too much but optimally the airflow should be directed towards in between the rear exhaust fan and motherboard itself. Again, it doesn't matter too much as long as the fan blows directly on the heatsink and it does not blow against the airflow generated by your CPU fan and rear exhaust fan.

Amd,ffiva0n,t1_ffhdtjj,1579983565.0,"Well from this point of view both liquid and air cooling is... air cooling. Since both dissipate heat into air via air - fans, rads and all that. With liquid cooling water ""carries"" the heat to where it is dissipated, with air coolers it's usually copper heat pipes.

Liquid coolers better handle spikes due to the fact that liquid has a lot of mass and takes time to heat up. Air coolers get hot very quickly as they don't have a mass of liquid absorbing the heat. Also there's often more radiator real estate and fans hence the higher cooling potential.

&#x200B;

One last thing is isntalling the radiator as intake provides consistenty fresh air to cool the CPU. However this pre-heats the air that gets into the GPU(not the case for full custom loops, obviously). With air coolers much of  the heat that GPU dumps into the case goes straigth into the air cooler."

The quad channel barely matters while the PCIe lanes and RAM capacity you night not need.

Amd,fddlmct,t1_fddbkgw,1578316937.0,"That's good to know. But IF clocks are dependent on CPU, not motherboard."
Amd,fdcw02c,t3_eknldw,1578285920.0,"Your board will likely limit your memory overclocking. But going over what your infinity fabric can clock doesn't make sense from performance standpoint. Infinity fabric clocks between 1800 and 1900 MHz. Thus RAM should run at 3600 to 3800 range.
Running memory controller not in sync with infinity fabric incurs a latency penalty which adversely affects operformance.

Get a new CPU, keep your board for the meantime and if you're ultimately unhappy with it you can switch to X570. There are plenty of good boards, including Taichi, Unify or Aorus Elite."
nvidia,fdcv4wz,t3_ekoauq,1578285194.0,"Difference between freesync and G-Sync mostly comes down to the fact that G-Sync has adaptive overdrive. This means that overdrive can change according to refresh rate. This should eliminate ghosting and/or overshoot.

How big is this? In my opinion not very. First of all a good monitor with properly tuned overdrive shouldn't really have these issues to begin with (LG 27GL850 comes to mind - it just works on 'fast' setting no issues). 

Secondly the value of adaptive sync in general on high refresh rates monitors isn't that high in my personal opinion. On a 60 Hz display screen tearing was very noticeable. After upgrading to a 144 Hz display I've noticed that I'm not using any kind of sync because the tearing is so, so much less noticeable. I'm only seeing it if I'm actively looking for it. So I ended up with an adaptive sync monitor and I'm not using this feature at all. This might just be me though.

I would choose a monitor based on its main merits - response times, refresh rate, size, panel type, build quality, factory calibration, color gamut, available settings, curve or lack thereof, etc. G-Sync would probably be the last thing I'm looking for, especially considering that it adds a lot to the price."
