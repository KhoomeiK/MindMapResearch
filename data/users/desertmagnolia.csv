This Christmas I’m house/pet sitting up on a mountain at 4,700 feet. The snow just started and is supposed to continue for the next two days. So I’m snugged here with a fire, 6 dogs and 7 cats. I made a pot of chili yesterday so I’m set. 
It’s a good Christmas. I was/am thinking of you and hoping you’re doing better. 
My internet connection is sporadic and I guess that’s the worst thing."

AskReddit,fbzjf5z,t3_efa18q,1577248715.0,"It’s not difficult. Last year was great. I went to a spa in a hotel and had a body scrub followed by a massage. Grabbed my dog and suitcase and dropped them at the house I started to house sit for that day for the next two weeks and headed to the movie theater. On the way to the house I picked up some Chinese take out. A really good day. This year I’m house sitting up the side of a mountain and expecting snow in the morning, so the scrub, massage, etc..., it off. I did cook a big batch of chili today. It’s all good."
