science,ffjezri,t1_ffhc7ia,1579996853.0,"Wow.  Yeah I agree with you, that seems like a low number for such a wide expanse of time for a species that Ruled the Earth for a hundred million years.  From the littlest finger sized dinos to the gargantuans,  But I’m no scientist.  I’m impressed either way.  I wonder if it was kinda like Africa?  There are gazelles, there are lions, there are rhinos, there are elephants.  Some birds.  Same insects.   And that’s about it?   I guess every ecosystem doesn’t have to be as diverse as the Amazon just because the Amazon is a diverse ecosystem."
