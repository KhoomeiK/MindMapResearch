runescape,felppmt,t1_felew78,1579227926.0,"Holy shit I have seen this but didn't chalk it up to a bug. I was depositing chickens. My screen flashed to my last tab, and the chicken seemed to swap places with whatever was in the same location on the last tab. However, no item moved or disappeared from my last tab, but I also couldn't find my chicken until I searched for it. It doesn't happen all the time so I dunno...

Edit: I was trying to drag the chicken from my inventory into a specific slot on a different tab.

Edit 2: Also search told me it was in a tab (can't remember which one), but I swore I had looked there and didn't see it?? And it's definitely not because there was a preexisting placeholder, as I do make that mistake often and always check. And when that mistake happens, my interface doesn't flash to a completely random tab. My last tab is a junk tab, and I never go there."

I apologize for that, and want to clarify that I respect your personal choice, and do not think any less of you (or anyone else) for making the choice that's right for them. 

My intention was to add a viewpoint to a topic that I think is incredibly complicated, directed to people who might not have given it as much consideration. I think it's extremely important that people really think about whether or not they are equipped to handle problems that are likely to arise. I hear and agree with you that the case of adoption, it's not a hypothetical scenario like ""one might develop cancer"". In that sense, my comments were like telling someone to move into a hurricane zone, because who knows their house might burn down accidentally anywhere at any time. It is not the same thing. 

P.S. happy cake day!"
aww,feej045,t1_fee4zju,1579034724.0,"Yeah totally, I'm not disputing that. However, same thing can happen with bio kids. Illness, addiction, other mental health problems, trauma. You never know what will happen. It's kind of a marriage ""in sickness and in health"" thing. I understand why some might not be equipped/want to deal with issues related to adoption, but I hope they also know that they might have to deal with other difficult, unpredictable issues as well. Bio kids are not guaranteed to be easier."
aww,fedqfa5,t1_fedopea,1579017649.0,"Yup. You have to focus on building a good relationship with your kids, irrespective of how you got them.

So yeah, I agree. I get why companies need to profit, but we need a new incentive model."
technology,fdtccp8,t1_fdsmnhg,1578714747.0,"The biggest utility of this data would be knowing which diseases are associated with certain sequences. However, getting matched data can essentially lead to re-identification of individuals, particularly for rarer diseases. It's really hard to know where to draw that line, especially when information like socioeconomic status and geography can be immensely helpful for understanding what a particular sequence means. 

&#x200B;

On the other hand, biology is so complex that knowing the sequence will only get us so far. So it's worthwhile really considering who should get access to what data. That's more of an ethical question than a ""how do we prevent this database from getting hacked"" and data handling question.

And should companies really be the ones with access to this data? You still need to do research, and most biotech companies are unlikely to invest in research unless they are reasonably certain that they can make a profit. So who is it really helping in the end? Arguably not the population at large."
technology,fdtagll,t1_fdsjj2y,1578714032.0,"What should be more anger-inducing is when tax-payers who pay for research don't get to benefit from the results of that research. I wouldn't say that 23andme was a force that drove down the cost. It's more accurate to say that the decreasing cost of 23andme is is due to advances in sequencing technology.

AskAcademia,fdsg047,t1_fdqnoty,1578701936.0,"People say this all the time, but don't think enough about ""why are students like this?"" It's because the system has made them this way. It's because teachers have taught them to be like this. Educators forget all the time that we are supposed to be teaching students. Not just the material, but how to learn, how to grow, how to get curious and stay curious, good habits. 

They're all real students. Some come in with more privileged and appear to be special. Reality is that the qualities of the ""top 2%"" can be achieved by the majority of students if we bothered for freaking teach them!"

todayilearned,fdbwlju,t1_fdayazj,1578262980.0,"We have a saying, and it's ""trust, but always double check"". Should laymen *generally* trust the consensus of scientists? Mostly, yes. Same as how you would trust that the house you live in won't fall down at any second. Does it meant that the house you live in won't collapse one day? Not necessarily. Someone can ask me a question that I can answer by summarizing 20 years of research. But if they don't believe me because they're skeptical by default, then no explanation would ever satisfy them. 

Scientists frequently disagree, so it's almost a miracle we manage to come to any sort of consensus. It's a fine balance between agreement and disagreement, and it cycles based on the best available evidence. 

I encourage everyone to ask ""what are the caveats"", because there are caveats to even the best research, and any scientist worth their weight should be able to answer that."
todayilearned,fdbttwf,t1_fdbsy4j,1578262013.0,"Scientists are notoriously bad at communicating effectively, especially to those not in their fields (hell, even those in their fields). There are a lot of details that can affect how a certain result is interpreted, and it's near impossible to lay people to pick up on or think of by reading a some primary research articles. And this isn't because lay people are stupid. It's because the vast majority of primary articles are not written to be accessible to anyone other than experts in the field."
todayilearned,fdbsro4,t1_fdbpcdi,1578261458.0,"Can confirm it's doable for a lot of biology too.

Yeah this is the one thing that I thought of too, and would definitely make me think twice before potentially losing two friends! Although on the flipside, if I found out a friend knew and didn't tell me, I'd understand why, but would probably stop being their friend. It would fucking hurt."
