I know a few people who changed theirs too quick and ended up doing it twice when they finally settled on their name, I wanted to avoid doing that. Additionally, I’m hoping that Ohio will change their law about birth certificates with the pending lawsuits that are going through the courts, otherwise my documents will never match."

askportland,fcyor5g,t1_fcyktpb,1578084038.0,"I would say it’s cheap but nearly everything is more ready made or somehow processed (with the exception of their produce which isn’t always good).
