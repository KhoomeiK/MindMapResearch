todayilearned,fez77m5,t1_feylss8,1579454443.0,"EXCEPT....the reason why VHS cassettes were so expensive was to capture money from the rental market.  Laserdiscs weren't rented that heavily, so their price was a more reasonable 29.99 or so.

You had companies that offered PPT (Pay per transaction), a rental store would spend 10 dollars per movie and then would pay a fee each time it rented out.  That allowed smaller stores to get depth of copy at a cheaper initial cost, but at the expense of long term profits.  

I worked in video stores from 1989 until about 1998, and the first new release movie on VHS I remember people actually buying was Ghost.  At 89.99 a pop.

Ideally you want your CI to be less than your CO, the easiest way to do that is through diet.  Especially in the beginning if you're morbidly obese.
