Within this already obscure subgroup i focused on data from a language with approximately 4000 speakers. I know of three academics worldwide, who are experts in this language. I'm sure there are equally obscure subfields within math that require extreme specialisation. Doesn't mean you have to be extremely smart to understand it. It's my experience from academia that there exists a lot of super obscure research fields, where only a handful of people worldwide have the knowledge to understand the research.

magicTCG,fdqubtc,t1_fdqt80z,1578675019.0,"You're partially right. The format does have a lot of high toughness creatures and a tendency for board stalls, but only if you're unprepared. The most succesful drafters in Throne of Eldraine identified that tendency and adjusted their pickorder to combat that meta. The set gave you the tools to combat a meta full of high toughness creatures. That's why it didn't frustrate me as much as it frustrated you. I would agree with you if these tools weren't present in the set. It wasn't  a problem if you identified good stall breakers and drafted them earlier. It's not a structual problem with the set but something you could turn to your advantage as a player. It was a very skill intensive set in that sense. Meta-gaming in draft is not something casual players think about, so i understand why it could be tedious or frustrating if you didn't know how to handle it.

TLDR: I agree with you that it was a difficult set to draft. It feels like a set that was rewarding for dedicated limited players and off-putting for everyone else. I enjoyed it more than any other sets in recent memory for the same reasons you disliked it. It presented many interesting puzzles to solve and high replayability because of the variety of archtypes. It was not a good experience on Arena though."

This was the best format to play aggro since Guild of Ravnica, which runs counter to point 4. I noticed games ran long early in the format until strong limited players figured out how to build aggro. This was actually a quite fast format with many viable ways to build aggressive decks. I say this as someone who peaked at #14 on the limited ladder on Arena and played hundreds of drafts."

pcgaming,fcnt0ju,t1_fcnqypl,1577817849.0,"Sharper: Less unnecessary content and better execution of the gameplay. Most of the sidequests contribute in some way to the story, where Planescape has more filler.

Better written:  Planescape Torment does well with the different characters but it loses track of the overarching plot, that falls apart midways through the game. Planescape Torment doesn't achieve anything like the effortless polyphony of voices in Disco Elysium. It's good fantasy writing but more heavy handed. The writing lacks the command of stylistics and register Disco Elysium has.

Deeper: It gives a nuanced treatment of the forces at play in the world without taking sides. It goes deeply into philosophy and political theory with success, where Planescape Torment is more your typical lore building."

[http://financialfootballnews.com/everton-fcs-2018-finances/](http://financialfootballnews.com/everton-fcs-2018-finances/) this article covers the fiscal year 18/19. I don't think there is data available yet for their financial performance in 19/20.

'Going forward Everton’s new owners are going to have to invest further due to the rising losses of the club on the back of rising costs that isn’t being met by any meaningful rise in revenues as performances on the pitch struggle to match the investments made off the pitch.

Evertonians alike will be hoping that going forward funds will be spent more wisely, leading to a more sustainable Everton in the future'.

Everton fans claim the club is rich now, which indicates that they haven't read a single financial report in their life. The club has undertaken a huge risk to get european football, and it won't continue unless the performance on the pitch improves.

This article from the magnificent Swiss Ramble shows exactly why Everton's financial strength is overrated by the club and the fans. The article is a few years old, but there is no reason to think that the club's economy has improved significantly since then.
