DelphiMurders,fgbxfs9,t1_fgaalnx,1580667031.0,"Those two attorneys aren't involved in the case. They are speculating, repeating ""I heard that police believe (insert your favorite theory here)"".  They didn't say the info came from investigators actually on the case. Additionally, everything in that post has already been discussed on this very sub. It isn't new or privileged information.

>Either its gossip and the positions don't matter - it could have just as well came from two McDonalds staff... in which case, the mods should delete the post. 

If the mods should delete this post, they might as well delete the entire sub, because other than a very small percentage of discussions, it's ALL speculation.

What it comes down to is that unless the attorneys are directly involved in the case, it's not privileged information. In any case, absolutely nothing was said that hasn't been discussed to death on this sub and everywhere else. I respect u/criminalcourtretired enough to believe that if there actually had been sensitive information, it would not have been posted here.


>I'm sorry... how would two attorneys relay what the police believe without that information coming from an investigator? 


In the same way someone on this sub can state ""police believe"" although the information may be 2nd, 3rd or 4th hand and not directly from an investigator. After info has travelled a generation or two from its source, its accuracy can't be verified. 
The info could have come from the janitor at the police station, who actually said ""I think police believe"" but by the time the info gets to two attorneys who then discuss it with OP, it has changed to ""police believe"" and the source can't be verified.

I don't think the post should be deleted, it's interesting to hear another viewpoint. But I am beginning to wish mods would lock it do the back and forth about whether the attorneys were inappropriate would cease."

Dogtraining,fg8tt19,t1_fg8eium,1580629549.0,"I'm not arguing with you. I've already said we agree in principle. Aside from that, what I *actually* said was I recomend a deep layer of cat litter or stall pellets OVER the pee pads for easy clean up and to change the texture of the area.

Up until 2/14/17, no one believed a double homicide of two teens could happen in Delphi, where ""nothing ever happens"" But here we are. 

I agree the drug related assault theories are pretty far fetched- but bad stuff happens everywhere these days."
DelphiMurders,fg8m380,t1_fg3j3xf,1580623963.0,"Yes, and now all those friends/family/locals trooping around has led to the speculation that the crime scene was contaminated. Had LE stayed on the scene, taken control and properly organized the search, limiting the number of people in the field and recording who was in what area, that speculation could have been avoided. Instead they shut down official operations, allowing freelance searchers to go willy-nilly wherever they would roam. 

Thus no one seems to know what areas were covered that night, or who may have been through there. In terms of good search procedure, that's a disaster."
DelphiMurders,fg8jrjm,t1_fg88pe0,1580621693.0,"About the crime scene... the recent ""Scene of the Crime"" podcast has a comment from someone supposedly in the know that some things about the crime scene were ""odd"". This is such a strange thing to say.

Nothing AT ALL was said that this info came from an investigator on the case. Nothing, with a disclaimer that the information was unverified and from an unknown source.

>the client is the investigator. The prosecutor, commonwealth attorney, states attorney, etc... pursuing the case

Aaaannnd the reported information came from none of these people. It's from lawyers in an entirely different county who most likely have not heard that info *from the investigators or others ACTUALLY involved in the case.*  That makes it hearsay. Gossip.
There was no client/attorney priviledge violated because the attorneys in question are not directly involved in the prosecution of this case. 

These same speculations are made on this sub hourly."
DelphiMurders,fg89qno,t1_fg84rp3,1580613336.0,"No. What they put forth could be as much hearsay as anything on this sub. It's just gossip and probably speculation into the bargain. They are not involved in the case, and may have just picked up tales from anywhere....just like the folks on this sub."
DelphiMurders,fg896na,t1_fg85j3u,1580612906.0,"Also, you have at least twice stated that cannot vouch for the authenticity of the info- for all you know it could have been pure speculation, as you have said. Which is EXACTLY what 90% of the posts on this sub are.

It's funny to me how many people are complaining that not enough info has been released, but then when presented with a **possible** new outlook, there's complaint about *that*."
Dogtraining,fg88d7i,t1_fg7zrf1,1580612256.0,"Yes, we are complete agreement. Your ideas *would* probably make it less confusing with the scent of grass and the texture. Just, as you said, a bit harder on the human."
DelphiMurders,fg8463n,t3_exg7m1,1580609058.0,"On a scale of 0 (complete speculation) to 10 (absolute truth) where would you rate the reliability of the lawyers? This kind of backs up the theory that *some* information at least has been discretely discussed outside immediate LE involved. I find this to be a bit reassuring in case the killer shows up in someone else's courtroom. He might be recognized.

That scenario of the girls makes sense to me but also makes me very sad.

I hope there's a LOT more evidence than the public has been lead to believe, and that LE is quietly making huge strides."

Dogtraining,fg8096w,t1_fg7tb2w,1580606069.0,"I think it depends on the size of your dog- I've seen baby pools as small as 30"" in diameter at my local dollar store. 

The essential thing is that your dog **has** to be able to get her **whole body** inside the pool with a bit of room to turn around and find a good spot to squat. It's easier to start larger and gradually reduce if space is a concern, but she will always need enough room to get in, turn around and squat with 8 or 10"" to spare all round.

We found that the real grass pads hold odor and the fake grass is too much like carpet for some dogs"
Dogtraining,fg7zla8,t1_fg7x3y9,1580605573.0,"There will be some initial confusion, yes. It might mean OP has to start retraining like a puppy more or less for a while. I suggest cat litter or stall pellets because most folks don't have those types of things in their house (cat litter boxes excepted), whereas dogs can easily confuse fake grass with carpeting. It's a texture differentiation thing. Grass clippings stain feet which in turn stains carpet, and actual real grass growing pads hold odor. The closest thing along those lines might be hay or straw, but those are pretty messy and waaay hard to get out of carpet. (Source: I am a farmer and horse owner)"
Dogtraining,fg7uk0a,t3_ex6nsy,1580601813.0,"Any training or skill will start to deteriorate without practice. In the case of dog training, repetition until a behavior becomes automatic (almost a reflex, actually) is essential to reliable training. 2 weeks or even 6 months is not enough time to fully achieve this, especially if you aren't really working hard at it.

It's true your dog has become collar wise, because somewhere down the road he did a (some) behaviour(s) without the collar and got away with it. For successful training you need to know how to reinforce good behavior and prevent/eliminate unwanted behaviors without reliance on anything other than your voice and body language...and perhaps a collar and leash.

Your dog learned to respect the collar, not your wishes, and this usually happens from too much correction and too little reward combined with a lack of consistency and length of time.

Back to basics with absolute consistency, and practice, practice, practice will help get you on track."
