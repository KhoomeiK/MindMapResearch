My boyfriend bought his parents' house and property, planning to farm it. Over the next ten years, he's bought an old tractor (and another, and another...) a greenhouse, built a chicken coop, wood shed, and the first phase of the barn.  We plan everything, track finances.

We work full-time off-farm, and build slowly. We have 1/2 acre organic veggies, chickens, meat birds, goats, ducks, 11 pigs, and a cow.

poultry,fggxszb,t3_eyfjds,1580771973.0,"FOr cleaning, here is what we've arrived at that works for us:

Our coop is HUGE. 2 100 square foot rooms with a tiny feed room, and another 100 sq foot solarium. Winter is long in Canada, man.   They haven't been outside in like 2 weeks.  Being able to walk around inside is soooooooooo nice for cleaning/cobwebbing/bird catching.  


This allows us a few things: 

a clean feed room where we can store buckets, bales of straw, etc. without them nesting in it or pooping on it.   If needed, the feed room can be a quarantine or sick bay.  
Multiple doors. Two man-doors and a chicken door. The one man door has a 1/4"" wire screen door, which allows for weasel-proof breezes on hot summer nights. The other man-doors give us lots of options for ventilation on mild winter days.  


Our soffits aren't really finished up tightly, allowing for more ventilation. 1/4 wire mesh (weasels) and some used insulation stuck up in there.   Keeping it dry in winter really does make for warmer birds.

One of our rooms has the roost and nest boxes. Two roost poles, with a ""shit board"" underneath. I don't slope my shit board, as I have some very tiny and older birds that walk on the board to get to the roosts.   A shovel fits between the board and the bottom roost pole for easy poop scooping. The shit board keeps my straw on the floors mostly dry, and we do a deep litter method, so I only add more bedding weekly.  The floor underneath it all is plywood in this room. It floods otherwise.

The other room contains two feeders and waterer, and free-choice supplements. There's less bedding in here because they just kick it into the feeders.  Just enough bedding that I can scoop up wet straw if it gets gross, but the floor stays dry.

I whitewash twice a year. Not only does it really brighten things up, it helps with bacteria."

While they're standing right at the very edge of the stairs, have a helper (it could be you later, but not this first try) pick up the front paw that you're NOT trying to clip. They might distract the dog a bit. If needed, they can distract a back paw, too. You, holding whatever clipper, will clip the toes that the dog is putting weight on. It's easiest if you can make them overhang the stair. You might need to wiggle some toes aside, but otherwise, the paw is on the ground.

With some step-in posts and cheap fencing, fenced the thing off. People Paid $10, and then $5 in later rounds to buy a square. The middle square was for the couple. 

Once all the squares were sold, we let out the chicken, spun him around, and placed him on the middle. It never took him longer than 30 seconds to poop on a square. Square owner gets 50% of the profits."
BackyardPork,ff6f5c8,t3_erv89n,1579625849.0,"Spots? Berkshires?  Our meat pigs are berk/tamworth/landrace crosses. Love their temperament.

Never had predators.

We start out with some serious fencing in a small space to train them on electric. You can not have them escape this early training pen. Once they obey it, one or two strand electric is fine. Ours was off for 2 weeks and no critters noticed.

Forest and shade are nice. They will seriously turn up any grass and leave it super lumpy.  If they get bored and run out of pasture they will test fences. We're not sure how to level out the lumps yet... The plow did nothing to help.

They're going to dig up at the base of your shelter. Push out the bottom of the walls. Make 'em solid!  And yes, don't run with goats. Our goats get in there sometimes and nobody minds, but they would eat the goat if they could.   The pigs got into our chicken coop once and trampled some birds.

We mix our own feed with water in buckets every day for 13 pigs. Nice to have control. add restaurant scraps.

I think Our butchering works out to about $200 as well. Additional $1.75 for smoking, sausage. More to keep feet, etc.   Nice choice of cuts.

A half pig barely kept the two of us for a year, and we also have unlimited chicken. We're out of pork for another three months and so bored of chicken and tofu and beans!"

As a lady, I wear spandex capris every single day of the damn year. Get ones with pockets.  You can swim in them, get them wet, they're pretty cool in summer, or layer them in winter. Or jean shorts. I have a few pairs of tougher jeans for bush work.  I pair all of my fashions with rubber boots (cheapie,) crocs, birkenstocks or blundstones. Those shoes are worth the dough.  


My guy buys a couple pairs of carhart pants, and then a dozen thrift store jeans. He wears the same three pairs at work and on the farm until I condemn them. He does pants all summer long, but never has all the cuts and bruises I do.  


On top, I wear sports bras and tank tops, and suffer stupidly in blackfly season, resorting to ""full on DEET"" when necessary. He wears whatever teeshirts, but has some long-sleeve button-downs from the thrift store for the bugs.   


In winter, we all have old hoodies, some carhart bib snowpants and matching jackets. I thought I looked like a huge marshmellow in mine, but it's warm, dirty, and the pockets will hold my drill. Those last forever. Layer the flannel.

We both dig tilly hats, but the purple, sequined sombrero from the thrift store is always a winner.  I use some large stretchy headband-scarves for the hair/sweat factor.

The muscovies only chatter to me when they want food. But they do fly. The drake is terribly clumsy. Could clip wings?  I don't know how high a fence they would try to get  over -- all they really want to do is find water. Their roost is at 4"" and the drake struggles with that.  They're heavy birds and make jumping up the 6"" door sill look like torture.  On the water bit... those darn muscovies make a huge mess out of every puddle, downspout, rain storm, car wash day... But they're friendly, taste great, and lay well."

The dealer I bought mine from had the carpet out for cleaning as part of their detailing. Maybe it's not too hard to put back?  I wouldn't say that the bedliner has impacted anything that couldn't be covered up by carpet again.

But the look of plain bedliner is maybe not super appealing to a buyer. I think it's great, but I'm super tough on my cars."
