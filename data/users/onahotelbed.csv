These ought to be produced in equal amounts, barring any dependencies in chromosome pairs splitting up during meiosis. This means that OP's children could be XY, XX, XYY, or XXY. All of these combinations are generally viable.

It's important to note that most people don't know what chromosomes they have. A person with male secondary sex characteristics probably has XY chromosomes, but they may have XYY chromosomes, or some other combination. There are probably a lot of folks with trisomies in their sex chromosomes who just don't know and who live their entire (probably very normal) lives without knowing."

All processes become cheaper as they are scaled. The price per ounce of this product will drop dramatically if/when this process is scaled as a result because a lower price point means more customers means more profit. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume that you mean that the drop in cost to produce won't be fully passed on to the consumer as a drop in price and you're obviously correct - bio-based products will be premium products for a long time. This has less to do with CEOs wanting to line their pockets and much more to do with consumer uptake, which is extremely challenging in markets dominated by huge players who actually *do* exist to line their owners' pockets with profits."

There are massive drug and mental health problems, and the people are, for lack of a better word, hicks. Going back home to visit my mom always leaves me depressed - it's like visiting a dying loved one in the hospital. I'm convinced that if it weren't for the drug trade, Gravenhurst would not exist in 5-10 years.

Bracebridge, while only 20 min up the highway, is totally different. I lived there for two years in high school. There are still problems there, but I never felt unsafe as a young and obviously queer person in Bracebridge like I did Gravenhurst. I think that's very telling. And, while there's a high turnover of businesses in Bracebridge, it's definitely less economically depressing than Gravenhurst. Some cool and unexpected businesses have managed to thrive in Bracebridge.

Huntsville, though, is where it's at. Given those three options, I'd pick Huntsville any day. My dad lives there now and it's a bustling little community! They've got a few breweries and gyms, interesting eateries, and the population is small but not so small that everybody is up in your business all the time (as was true in Gravenhurst).

This is why you are indeed acting in bad faith: your argument reduces to ""well you as an individual don't have the solution, so therefore we ought to at least take a stance of apologism for the status quo"".

Anyway, the answer of how to pay for all the infrastructure and tech is to tax carbon. That's it. It's actually incredibly simple. In my province we were able to raise $3 billion in the first two years of our now-cancelled cap-and-trade program and a good portion of that funded green infrastructure and tech (my own green chemicals company got a grant from this pot, for example). In fact, Australia could enter the same carbon market we left if they wanted to because it still exists. 

This idea that one must have the perfect solution to a thing they are critical of in order for their criticism to be valid is silly because it allows any criticism to be arbitrarily dismissed.
