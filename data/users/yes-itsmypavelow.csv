WWII,ff8fsqt,t1_ff8db1o,1579676580.0,"Agreed. QS is a lot of fun in WW2, my only complaint is how aim assist breaks down when the connection isn’t prefect. It gets a lot harder to flick if anyone is on yellow/red bars. Dead on scopes still feel decent tho so it’s not unplayable in the lag, just annoying.

The OP was specifically about RF on the PTRS feeling a bit off. I tried it on the range and against bots and I can’t for the life of me explain it, but the gun feels better without RF even for the first shot in the mag or follow ups much slower than the RF cycle speed. Just weird to me"

IAmA,fewmftj,t1_fewkerk,1579414622.0,"I don’t really agree with the last part of what you said. Credit cards and small loans make sense to build up your credit, but a car is a utility and there’s zero financial benefit in financing a car if you can afford to buy the same utility outright.

Aside from just the interest rate, the problem is that cars depreciate *hard*. It’s amazing how many people are absolutely bewildered when their new-ish car gets totaled and insurance leaves them still owing thousands for a car they no longer have. The cycle continues when they have to roll that note up into yet another outrageous car loan just so they can drive to work.

So to be clear, I’m decently well off, and I honestly believe part of the reason why, is that I haven’t financed a car in about 20 years. What I lost from the one car I’ve financed- in interest, depreciation, and lost potential earnings in an actual investment, would have been enough to buy a much nicer car now at 2020 prices, or remodel my house, or retire a couple years earlier.

I’m not saying everyone should buy shitty old beaters and money pits every couple of years, just don’t buy new or nearly-new with seven years of “low” payments and think you’ll come out the other side with more money than if you had just paid $10-15k cash for a reliable car that gets the job done."
IAmA,fewk2rl,t1_few3flp,1579412318.0,"Idk, I have the same philosophy as that guy. I won’t buy anything I can’t afford to “pay cash” for. That doesn’t mean I *will* pay cash tho. Also doesn’t mean I’ll let my cash idle in some low-return bank account either."
IAmA,fewhbnf,t1_fewd8qn,1579410582.0,Financing to purchase is just as bad when something happens and you find yourself owing money on a car that you no longer have. Rolling your note up into another car is just kicking the can down the road.

Get the rest of your furniture (especially the cat tree!) out.

I finally got around to unlocking camos on the melees and more challenging guns recently. My stats have taken a sharp nosedive, but I’m still being matched with about the same tier of players as always.

I will note however, that turning off triple 2xp and whatever that big ass patch was, noticeably thinned out the player base and I’m now getting consistently shittier (connection) lobbies. My last 50+ games were almost all yellow bar and I’m in a decent-sized west coast city with stupid fast internet.

If you play enough though, you’ll notice the more popular game modes use some kind of recent performance MMR (hidden skill rank algorithm) to divide the lobby into teams.

I consider myself to be a pretty decent player, and there’s a handful of other good players I regularly encounter in my region— we are almost always on opposite teams. Low to mid-tier players seem to fill out the rest kind of randomly.

Player rank doesn’t seem to have much to do with team balancing at all, and of course there are some terrible MPs out there, especially since this game’s been out so long."

Jet engines can, and occasionally do fail in a spectacular fashion (shrapnel and burning fuel exploding out along the plane of rotation). 

Considering the wings are basically giant fuel tanks, and the fact that they’re also critical aerodynamic structures for keeping a plane aloft, it is completely plausible that a catastrophic engine failure might ignite the fuel in an internal wing tank and cause a rapid fiery crash.

Also it’s *possible* that the aircrew was in communication with air traffic control before the crash, and depending on what might have been exchanged, a preliminary conclusion might be reached before the investigation has been concluded. 

I personally don’t have enough information to speculate on what actually happened here; these types of investigations can take weeks, months, or even years to find a root cause."
