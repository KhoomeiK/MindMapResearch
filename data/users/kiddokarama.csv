And what hurts the most is I never had the chance to say a last goodbye, we went to see him once thinking he's getting better but little did we know that was the last time I see him smiling at me... 

You are not alone in this, you made it in life this far and you still have so much ahead, we can make it, it's not gonna be totally easy but we can make it... Each day as it comes, focus on the small things that make you happy and appreciate the ones around you... There's love everywhere if you know how to look...
