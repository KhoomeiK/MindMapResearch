ehlersdanlos,ffz1wzh,t1_ffyx59s,1580361309.0,Wow. Before I see any dentist I sit down with them and explain how not numbing has left me with some severe PTSD around dentists. I had them not believe me when I said I wasn’t numb and just keep going. If they won’t give nitrous then I won’t use them. I make that very clear. I pay a premium for it but I’m ok with that.
HumansBeingBros,ffz1ril,t1_ffyygao,1580361170.0,I didn’t even know this existed!! Thank you!
Fibromyalgia,ffybycn,t3_evrvjq,1580342786.0,"I understand where I you are coming from. I have fairly mild. I work full time, I work out 4 days a week. People see me as fully functional. What people don’t see is me on Sunday nights after a full day of housework crying and trying to massage use back into my body. They don’t see me getting 20 trigger point injections each month to keep my back limber or how I can’t move afterwards. Some days I can’t wear a bra or hold a bag because my skin is on fire for no reason then it’s a day that ends in Y. The fatigue and loneliness this illness causes. We are all valid! I have it easier then some, I have it worse then some. We have all gotten good at hiding our pain. We need to be a little more open and talk about our experiences. It seems to me that hiding it for fear of reactions does a disservice. We need to help teach ‘functional’ people that each case is so different. Those of us that have the energy and are willing can help take that burden off of those that can’t."

The plakers aren’t the best but they are better then nothing. 
I would also find a dentist that is very knowledgeable about EDS. I have found that that makes everything easier."

ZeroWaste,ffwxk6h,t1_ffwwu1y,1580313278.0,Problem is most offices don’t have secure places to store your bike and shower/ change. I’m in the PNW so I would be soaked by the time I got to work most of the time. Working in an office I would be immediately considered less showing up less then professionally dressed and made up.
ZeroWaste,ffwof06,t1_ffwlj1q,1580307019.0,There is a bus stop 1/4 mile from my work. It literally only has a bus come at 6am. This is the manufacturing area of my town. Probably 300 people work within a mile of this stop. But we have to drive. Biking isn’t safe due to traffic patterns and the semi trucks.

Sexuality is so fluid and can change rapidly, I found that going with the flow and feeling comfortable in each iteration has produced the least amount of stress for me.

Fibromyalgia,ffcsvqm,t1_ff4atp7,1579806579.0,I usually use a sunbeam twin sized electric blanket. Charter club extra firm down pillow is my favorite because I can change how it feels as the night goes by. As for t weighted blanket my husband got it for me for our anniversary last year. He got it off amazon.  Sheets I prefer a soft Pima cotton or crisp Egyptian cotton. Pima doesn’t wrinkle much but sleeps a little warmer. Egyptian wrinkles but is cooler since it has air pockets.

AskReddit,ff4ct1m,t3_ercoeh,1579560581.0,I was that kid. I remember one being told that they didn’t think I could talk. Funny thing is now my family knows I’m sick because that’s the only time I’m still and silent. I just didn’t want to talk to my classmates. We had nothing in common. Now I’m married to a PhD candidate and about to go back and get mine in Forensic Psychology.
AskReddit,ff4ad4j,t3_erili0,1579559017.0,I go hide in our warehouse and listen to podcasts. Everyone figures I’m cleaning or taking inventory. Whenever someone comes in I pick up my clipboard and write something.
AskReddit,ff474on,t3_ergjyj,1579556999.0,They called a coworker a racial slur. I full on kicked them out of the store screaming. When they tried to say I didn’t have the authority and that they were going to call and complain I picked up the phone and called the manager. I was backed up. We don’t have to take abuse and my coworker was crying and couldn’t stand up for herself.
Fibromyalgia,ff46akz,t3_erjcsi,1579556479.0,"Yes. I found a heated mattress pad, weighted blanket and a selection of pillows that I can change out for whatever I need that particular night. Good quality sheets that don’t pill are also a huge need. If I feel different textures on my sheets it usually ends up irritating my skin. I also had to create a sleep ritual and I lay down about an hour before I plan on sleeping."

ZeroWaste,feol5fz,t3_eq705a,1579301669.0,I use both. I prefer pads on my days off. At work I like the cup because I don’t have to tend to it. I just rinse my pads when done and then pop them in the washing machine. I don’t see them as any more unsanitary then normal underwear. I’ve been using cloth pads for more then 10 years and have no problems with blood washing out and staining other clothing. They are just creeped out by menstrual blood.
