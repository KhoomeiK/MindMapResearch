That's not a problem, they have a right to do that, but as the article even points out, the incompetence of Modi's government is destroying India's potential to be an economic powerhouse, helping its people climb out of poverty.  It's also pointing out that India's businesses aren't able to compete on a global level so they need to be coddled by their government.  This is just nationalist, protectionist scapegoating of a ""foreign"" threat and diverting attention away from Modi's conservative govt's own mismanagement.  Sound familiar?

It's far better (and healthier) to work to make something happen rather than to stop something from happening.  There's really nothing to be done about Trump's behavior while he's in the Whitehouse anyway.  There's a slim hope that 22 Senators or so will find their conscience and there's a small amount that ordinary people can do to help them find it but the odds aren't in favor of it.  From what I've seen, the people who actually can do something to help a conviction happen in the Senate are basically doing everything possible, but don't forget that even if Trump is removed, he was only ever a symptom of a disease, America is still sick.  

My personal long-time experience with narcissistic people has taught me that centering your life around the wrongs they do to you is part of their pathology.  Right now the entire country feels like an abused household, like mine was growing up.  It's part of the perverse way they control your life and make it all about them.  Bad people will do bad things, it's a fact of life.  There's people who understand Trump is a bad person and he is bound to do whatever bad things he can, and there's people who don't get it.  As a Buddhist I am a firm believer that there is no place anyone can hide from the consequences of their actions and Trump is no different.  He will pay, eventually - but that won't be the end of America's troubles.

Disclaimer: I watched his full routine and laughed by ass off.  I also have a huge problem with why a lot of people unconditionally agree with everything Ricky said and what's really behind the Schadenfreude.  

If you were a famous person whose opinions are capable of being seen by and influencing society and you know speaking out could potentially help or raise awareness for a cause you know is important, is it better to A. keep your mouth shut or B. speak out? Thinking actors and artists do this because they think they are special is missing the point - they are visible and they are choosing to use that visibility, NOT because they think their opinion is more important simply because they are famous.

I appreciate Hollywood or any other celebrity for speaking out, one, for providing an example of courage, risking societal judgment because they feel true conviction; two because people who are highly successful in an artistic field such as entertainment are usually well-traveled, well-educated, creative, and intelligent. I also believe that while there is corruption and misconduct in the institution of showbusiness, it's no different from corruption and misconduct that's rampant in ANY OTHER institution, be it organized religion (insert priest/cardinal/bishop's name here), professional athletics (Larry Nasser, Jerry Sandusky), or anywhere in the corporate world. Hollywood just gets a bad rap because it's 1) more visible and 2) conservatives and the right wing want to demonize it because so many actors and well-known artists are outspokenly liberal so they have an axe to grind. Sorry my Republican friends, but Tom Hanks, Robert De Niro, mostly the entire cast of Star Wars old and new, the entire main cast of The Avengers, Taylor Swift, Lebron James, and Steph Curry supported Obama and think Trump is a bum. Maybe when a bunch of talented, hard working, cool, and yes, popular people all think the guy you support is a bum you'll feel some doubt as to your own judgment, and I enjoy that you feel so threatened by this you need to demonize entire institutions and creative professions to try and get rid of that discomfort.

But for those who might be interested in trying this if you haven’t, I thought I’d share some of the things I’ve learned in my struggles to avoid the Critical Mission  Failure screen in what most consider the hardest game of the trilogy.  Really, I’m doing this almost as a diary of sorts to satisfy my own obsession with getting all this out, but if this helps people thinking of trying it, great.  If you’re looking for a challenge I’d strongly recommend it, I actually gained a lot of insight into the game by doing it.  It also was some nice practice at being disciplined and patient.  Finally, it also made the story feel more intense again too, which is a nice feeling after doing so many playthroughs. 

1.	 I’ve learned that my palms don’t sweat, thankfully.  My feet do.  Profusely.  

2.	Treat your Shield like your Health, and your Health like the Grace of God.  In the early game you are so squishy that using any Bonus Power other than Barrier, Geth Shield, or Fortification is unwise; I personally used Barrier the entire way through until Arrival DLC which I always do last, after the Suicide Mission.  

3.	ME2 has a lot of problems, and I’ve ranted about the gameplay of Insanity Difficulty and my problems with it before.  The best way to think of it is NOT as a shooter, but actually as a real-time puzzle game.  Solving it is about knowing what enemies spawn when/where and what triggers them; and also knowing the layout and best cover spots for every challenging fight.  Finally, it’s about Resource Management – killing enemies, cooldowns on abilities, shield recharge, squadmate cooldowns, movement, weapon switching, and reloading all cost the resource known as TIME.   Efficient use of TIME is actually the primary skill of ME2.  The secondary resource is ammunition, both regular and heavy weapon, but that is less difficult.  

4.	If you have the Long Service Achievement bonus EXP, doing every available mission, assignment, and sidequest will just barely unlock level 18 prior to Horizon.  Depending on what missions you choose after Horizon you can also just barely reach a level threshold prior to the Collector Ship but that’s not always as critical, but for Horizon you definitely want to be as powerful as possible.

5.	This seems obvious, but Medi-gel is your friend.  Playing casually, I always hated using Unity and usually if a squadmate died I’d just let them be dead until I finished a segment and they revived automatically.  I had to throw that mindset out the window.  Save medpacks you find and don’t just greed them for 100 credits.  Get the Emergency Shielding upgrade ASAP; once you have it, Unity becomes your best defensive “panic button.”  Don’t even hesitate to use it if your shields go down but you seem “safe” behind cover.  The cooldown is short, it restores everyone to full shield, and can be done on the move.  It also can be better to use Unity preemptively when a squadmate is taking hits rather than to wait for them to die, as the revive animation takes time.  Another lesser known fact is that Unity is guaranteed to restore you to full health and shields – that is, while the animation and power are healing you, you are functionally invulnerable at least until you hit 100%.  In testing, I’ve had the Shadow Broker himself whaling on me but was able to escape by popping Unity.  It is often the only ability that can save you in a bad spot where your shields are down and you’re still taking damage.   I had to train myself to remember this, because my habit from casual play would be to hit my “shield” abillity, in this case Barrier.  The problem with that is, 12 second cooldown as opposed to 3.  In a tough situation with imminent threats, putting your abilities on a 12 second cooldown can be a death sentence. 

6.	Avoid any “fun” purchases like fish and models until late in the game when you have tons of cash.  You’d be surprised what upgrade you might not have been able to afford had you not had credit card discipline.  

7.	Careful planning of mission order, upgrade progression, and squadmate selection is rewarded (and fun).  Squadmates should usually be picked based on who can best help you through the hardest part of any given mission.  Squadmates that can cast CC (interrupt) abilities on a short cooldown are generally the best - I used Samara and Jack often in the later stages of the game. 

8.	Don’t believe everything you read on walkthroughs and guides, some of it is less than optimal, some is patently wrong.  For example, whoever wrote the walkthroughs on the ME Wiki seems to think the Arc Projector is the greatest thing since sliced bread.  It’s not.  In fact using it on Insanity with its 2 second charge up time is suicidal.  My go to heavy weapon for my run was the Avalanche, and I never regretted it.  I only used a different heavy weapon two separate times, for very specific reasons.  

9.	If you aren’t trying to do a completionist run, avoid most of the assignments (N7 Missions); many of them are VERY dangerous and also can tend to be glitchy.  Do the easy ones of course, and ones that provide useful upgrades, but avoid the hell out of N7 Archaelogical Dig (Christ this one is nasty), and N7 Strontium Mule, the Heavy Skin Weave you get is not worth the risk.  I did these regardless, primarily because I wanted to prove how hard I am (also fuck the Blue Suns) but if I ever do this again, heeeell no.
  
10.	Your squadmates often “forget” you told them to sit and wait somewhere due to certain progression triggers so keep an eye on them to make sure they’re staying put as you advance through a mission.  Squadmates in ME2 are clumsy, glitchy, and stupid and can get not only themselves killed but you killed if they draw things like rockets or friendly Scion shockwaves at your position.  

11.	I retrained my powers and adjusted my bonus power several times during the run (changing from Heavy Barrier to the long duration one, for example).  One thing to remember is that because this completely screws up your hot bar assignments, avoid missions that plunge you right into a fight immediately after you do this, for example Miranda’s Loyalty mission, because none of your abilities will be mapped how you’re used to and you don’t want that slowing you down or making you waste abilities.  

12.	Once you’ve killed almost every enemy that will spawn in a particular area, the remaining ones will often just bum rush you.  This can catch you off guard at the worst time: when you’ve grown overconfident because you know you’re close to killing everything.  On Insanity you can easily get pwned by the weakest enemy in a 1v1 if they invade your cover so never let your guard down.  This happened to me in Thane’s recruitment mission where an Eclipse Vanguard just ran straight at us and luckily he went for Garrus and not me.  I wasn’t in the greatest cover position and reacted a little slowly.  RIP Garrus.  

13.	Remember that Lair of the Shadow Broker unlocks a bunch of upgrades and also lets you retrain your teammates’ abilities completely, so even though it’s hard it can be very useful.  Sometimes you will build a certain squadmate on way for the early game or a specific mission but want to change it later, or maybe you just screwed up.   My example would be Tali; I put a bunch of points into AI Hacking early but after unlocking Energy Drain I redistributed to max that out.  

14.	The hardest missions and areas in my view are:  (1) LotSB - Broker Ship exterior waiting for Liara's hack (2) Collector Ship - opening ambush (3) Horizon - when Harbinger shows up on (4) Miranda’s Loyalty Mission final battle (5) Suicide Mission – final battle specifically (6) Garrus’ Recruitment – the Garage (7) Tali’s Loyalty Mission – the fight after she complains she can’t smell flowers  (8) Kasumi’s Loyalty Mission – final battle"
