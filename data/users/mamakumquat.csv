I am also 9 and 2 and I can't BELIEVE how relentlessly shitty I feel. I have three states: nausea, vomiting, and sleep. Thank God for sleep.

My house is also currently a tip and even working part time currently I am struggling. And I don't have a kid. Hang in there, it's not forever (right???)!"

Thanks for your kind words."

I've spent a lot of time writing emails to our useless politicians. Hell hath no fury like a hormonal, home-bound pregnant woman."

Aug2020bumpers,fe73iqx,t3_enyi4e,1578909522.0,It's the worst. The other day I had to pull over and puke in the gutter. It was a Saturday morning so at least I looked like a party animal?

I did not know this. Thank you!"
Aug2020bumpers,fe72v3u,t3_envhi9,1578909222.0,"Hey! I am a couple of days behind you, but my symptoms have been really similar (nausea, boob pain). We also just had our first scan and are now waiting for the 13 week scan in February. It feels like ages away!

The thing that has helped me has been being strict with my anxiety. The truth is that, I think once you get on this baby journey, you might never stop worrying again. I tell myself that once that scan has happened I'll be worrying about the next trimester, then the labour, then if the baby is about to stop breathing at night, then stranger danger, what if they get hit by a car/ attacked by a neighbour's dog/ bullied by a kid at school/ brainwashed by Nazis on the internet etc. And it will just never end.

So I just tell myself that this is part of it! We have to get used to not knowing what tomorrow will bring. But today, you are pregnant, and you should celebrate it <3"

Get pregnant with a kid you want. Get judged for everything from how much/little you work to how much screen time your kid has to whether you let them eat nuts too young..."

I think he looks great but he's still grieving his old curly mane (it was so large it was kind of part of his personality!). We need to talk more about how great variety is, so thank you for your contribution to that dialogue."
Aug2020bumpers,fdpksz5,t1_fdmvv6i,1578631379.0,"> I guess I’m averse to everything because I’m nauseous all the time, and if there’s any one particular food I can think about at a given time without wanting to puke then I guess that food is my craving at that moment

This best summarises my 'cravings' also :'D"
Aug2020bumpers,fdmmgoq,t1_fdm5eoa,1578555572.0,Omg. Clinging to this post right now. How far along are you? I am exactly 7 weeks today.
Aug2020bumpers,fdm2tta,t1_fdm2dgo,1578538470.0,Thanks. I'll chat to my doctor.
Aug2020bumpers,fdm251b,t1_fdm05zw,1578538005.0,"I'm a little reluctant to do that because of fears they will affect the baby, which may well be irrational but I think I'd rather just eat ice and bitch about it on the internet. Let's see if I've changed my tune after another month of this though."
offmychest,fdcf85l,t1_fcx2enj,1578273429.0,"Another update: 

I have my first scan today, to check for the baby's heartbeat. The air is so bad today we've been told to stay indoors. I have a mask so I'm going to wear that to get to the hospital for the scan. Crossed fingers it's good news today."

I'm staying indoors, hopefully the air will improve soon. It's hard not to get emotional. We are all affected by this. To give you a sense, an area the size of Belgium is burning. Nowhere outside the city feels safe. The New York Times compared the situation to Chernobyl today. I have cried a lot."

My partner works for the family business so we have a lot of flexibility in that regard, and my work, although the hours are long when we're shooting/ prepping, is quite ad hoc, so I may have no work for 3 weeks, followed by full time for 12 (ahhh the arts!).

This is right up there with my fears. Are they all gonna be like the YouTube people?! Is everybody out here having $10k baby shower/ gender reveal parties and a lot of preaching from the bible?\* Coz I would love a community of fellow mums but this ain't it.

I've also worked fairly extensively with kids in the foster care system and while putting more support into that system and/or providing vulnerable mothers with financial and emotional support should absolutely happen, neither of those things mean women should be forced to have children they don't want."
