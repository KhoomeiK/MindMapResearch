You can be trans and not take HRT. That's totally valid. If you don't think you actually want HRT, you don't have to go on it to be trans. Your transition is your own, it doesn't have to match anyone else's journey. You also don't have to match gender norms to be trans. There are feminine cis guys, there can be feminine trans guys, too.

I do know trans people with only social dysphoria who have gone on HRT and liked the results, too. HRT can make it more likely that you'll be gendered correctly by strangers, after all. I also know trans people who thought they didn't have physical dysphoria until they started noticing changes from HRT and realized just how much they felt better about their bodies after those changes occurred."

No one is 100% certain of a) that they won't pass on something unpleasant or b) that they won't suffer through some event that could leave them unable to care for their children. There's no guarantee in life. No matter who you are or what your situation is, when you have children, you are embarking on a venture that could result in suffering, because suffering is part of life.

At least if your child does have mental health issues, you have some idea what to expect - lots of parents have never encountered mental health issues until their children develop them, and they end up screwing up in ways that anyone who has as much experience and self-awareness as you is unlikely to.

And I've learned that if you put off living your life until you're healed, you end up missing out on so much, and you have more trouble healing. Doing something that's meaningful and fulfilling to you is an important key to healing.

The best you can do is be aware of the risks and do your best to lessen the impact of your issues on your child. Make sure to make taking care of yourself a priority, and make use of your support system. Keep crisis line numbers handy. Research how your conditions can affect parenting, and think about how you can mitigate the negatives of that."

Alternatively, you could just let them have it, and let it be an RP thing how they negotiate the use of it. I've had a couple cool RP bits around one of my PCs accepting that something they want is better in someone else's hands - one was a vampire in Curse of Strahd deciding to trust a vampire hunter with the sunsword hoping she'd use it on Strahd and not him, the other was a character who really wanted a pet wyvern deciding that the cavalier with a better understanding of dragons should get the wyvern egg.

DnD,ff3khcs,t3_ergkuw,1579542971.0,"Here's my take on it:

>For Minor Illusion I play a halfling so I’m under 5ft, could I use minor illusion to make myself “invisible” by making all the sides look exactly like what is behind me? Or do I have to make it something like a bush/rock appearing, or pressing against a wall and making my thin shape look like the wall just extends a bit further over top of me. (In this case the enemy is not looking at me during the casting.)

You'd have to be very precise to do the invisibility thing, I'd probably have it be a spellcraft ability check or if you get it wrong, it'll look off. The latter option would be easier.

>Could you use minor illusion to make a mirror? I’ve seen a lot of debate on this since technically minor illusion can’t move. 

You can make it look like a mirror, but the reflection won't change.

>With Silent Image Could you make a illusion person talk using a combination of silent image and minor illusion?(outside of combat of course)

Yeah, but it'd be tough to keep the two in sync. Again, I'd probably call for a spellcraft check or they'll be out of sync.

>Can you make multiple separate illusions within the space of silent image? Ex: Two men with swords.

Yeah, sure, as long as they all fit.

>Could you change what the illusion looks like while the spell is active? Ex: start with just a chest and then the chest disappears and moments later I use it to make an image of a man, or would I have to recast silent image?

If you've got the malleable illusion ability that illusionist wizards get, you can change it. Otherwise, no, because I don't want to give out a class feature for free.

>Could you use mage hand, silent image, and minor illusion altogether to create a very convincing illusion outside of combat? Ex;An illusion that can hold a dagger and talk.

That'd be very tough, but potentially doable.

>Could you use silent image to create something you are holding? Ex: fake sword, fake instrument, fake papers, and have it move with your hands?

If you're careful about how you move it and you, sure. I'd probably make that a Deception check, because your own movement is at least as important as the illusion's.

>Could you use silent Image to change what looks like is written on a piece of paper while the illusion is active?

Sure, no problem.

>Combining two previous questions- could you use silent image and minor illusion to create a fake instrument and make it sound like you are playing it?

Yeah, that'd be doable. I'd call for a Performance check to see how convincing it is."
