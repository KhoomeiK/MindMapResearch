blackjack,fg0wg1y,t3_evh6gr,1580416365.0,"I would stop focusing on merging the two until you have mastered the basic strategy so well that you don't have to think about it at all. However you can do that, you should be able to just make the call the moment you see the cards laid out, and not even think twice about it.

Doing that first will ensure you can count without having to even worry about playing basic strategy because it will be second nature to you.

Personally for me (I'm a very visual learner), I didn't even mess with alot of the methods out there to help learn, like remembering cute sayings and stuff to help figure out what to do. I just studied the actual basic strategy table (like the one on the blackjack wiki page) and when I saw cards laid out, I would picture where on the table this hand landed, and would just do what I remembered the chart said. It only took a few weeks of playing online and going over it in my head that I could actually just draw out the entire chart from memory.

After that, I can be as distracted as possible, but when I glance at the cards on the table, I know what call to make."

If you've seen Grindhouse, ""Planet Terror"" is right in the sweet spot for a satire. It's like a movie that satirizes other movies in the genre but also has absolute respect for them and just does a fantastic job of feeling like the filmmakers knew exactly what they were doing, and they were in on the joke, while also being a genuinely good example of a real movie in the genre.

F&F for me just never hits that mark, I never feel confident that the filmmakers are in on the joke with us. There's some moments in the series that certainly hit the mark for a second, like the Rock fucking FLEXING out of his cast and saying ""Daddies gotta go to work"", that shit is amazing.
