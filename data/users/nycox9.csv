Parenting,ffpbig0,t3_eugyp2,1580090926.0,"My ex was an amazing person, she grew up just fine, but she told me that when she was like 12 she wanted to know what it was like so she did it to a boy she only knew for a few days while on vacation. She was actually quite reserved sexually when we dated in our early 20's and I was only the 2nd guy she'd been with. It's not the end of the world for you or her. Maybe she's not as innocent as you want her to be but everybody grows up in different ways. She very well may not have sex until she's in her late teens like you."
Parenting,ffpadl7,t3_euav1s,1580090131.0,My daughter is 6 and her mother still doesn't buckle her up properly quite often.
Unexpected,ffhs5i2,t1_ffhiu95,1579951091.0,"I would have liked to have learned some life lessons, guidance, moral support, confidence affirming, how to stand up to people, maybe some hugs or attaboys, help with homework and projects, help with medical issues, help with issues at home. I was interested in computers and programming at 7 or 8 and could have used some guidance there but instead didn't start with them until my 20's and by then I was just trying to get by. I mean, a conversation would have been a good start. If he could have taken some of the stress off my mom that would have helped me too."
Unexpected,ffh7gy6,t1_ffh3kyj,1579925269.0,"No more naptime :(  She's 6 and getting more independent, so in those rare moments when she still reaches up for me my heart still melts like she's 2 again, and I'm her whole world and her safety blanket just like then.  BRB sneaking back in for more back rubs."
Unexpected,ffh6z3y,t1_ffh1gpk,1579924855.0,"Nothing. Just existed around me while growing up. Provided no guidance or assistance, just did enough to keep us fed and housed. Was more of a provider than a father. Spent his time off work drunk and blasting television while intermittently making my mom cry. The only advice he ever have me was not to grow up to be like him."
Unexpected,ffgxy7m,t1_ffgvg4e,1579917921.0,Ouch. My heart. As I lay here still rubbing my daughter's back even though she fell asleep half an hour ago. Couldn't imagine not being with her.
Unexpected,ffgxr50,t1_ffgx5a0,1579917775.0,I've seen my dad. You're not missing anything.

guns,fff5cn1,t1_fff3fa2,1579876107.0,"I see, thanks. I wish companies would stop advertising pre-cocked and striker fired as DAO. Unfortunately I didn't do enough research, knew Taurus had some issues with their guns going off inadvertently but thought I'd be okay with their DAO G2C but it's actually pre-cocked so I'm too nervous to carry with a round in the chamber. Going to hopefully switch when I find a true DAO with similar capacity and size."
guns,fff2beq,t1_ffev5jt,1579873783.0,"Amateur here. Don't a lot of double action only guns precock most of the way when you chamber a round? As in, whether or not the primer fires if it's struck with a mostly cocked striker is really up to chance?"

pettyrevenge,ffdva5j,t1_ffd6ohi,1579829801.0,I assume they're all hackable and don't do anything in front of one I wouldn't want anybody else to see. Used it mostly so my daughter's mom could check in on us when I was alone with our daughter for days in case I suddenly keeled over or something.
pettyrevenge,ffduzoq,t1_ffcp4cp,1579829594.0,No you just sit it on a shelf or table or whatever you want.
pettyrevenge,ffc3e5q,t1_ffc07wo,1579790552.0,You don't have to hang them up. Plenty come with a base. I use the yi with the cloud subscription.

PublicFreakout,ff3t2tn,t1_ff3myk1,1579548251.0,My brother still has back problems from when a teammate did this to him in wrestling practice 20 years ago. I find no fault in what this father did and I hope he wasn't punished too harshly for it.
tifu,fewq8v2,t1_fevrvsb,1579417863.0,Thanks. No not red headed but I do grow a weird single thick red beard hair.
tifu,fevb0nb,t1_fev2no7,1579395290.0,"Let me share a story with you. I had a vasectomy. The butcher of a doctor ""numbed"" me up and then cut me open. I said ""ouch I can feel every bit of that."" He didn't believe me and put the clamps on my nuts and asked ""did you feel that?"" I informed him that yes, I was in terrible pain. He injected my ball with some more numbing shit and finished that side. The smell of burning sack is etched into my brain. The same exact thing happened with my other ball including him not believing me and clamping my sack. I passed out from the pain. I carried a purple sack for a week. Fuck that guy."
WatchPeopleDieInside,fep8tcq,t1_fenyygp,1579314710.0,I told my 6 year old daughter something she drew looked like a swastika. Well when she was showing her mom the drawing she said it was a swastika and her dumbass mother freaked the fuck out and yelled at her like she was Hitler reincarnated.
AbsoluteUnits,fdpfhsg,t1_fdpbrq4,1578627276.0,Mine after.
PublicFreakout,fdm18cq,t1_fdlxerv,1578537395.0,"I know a guy who was on leave back in the US from Iraq that severely injured himself just enough so he wouldn't have to go back. War is fucked, fuck those who glorify it or call people pussies who don't want to do it."

PoliticalHumor,fd4cfqv,t1_fd3yv63,1578166365.0,"I knew of a guy who'd tell some stories of his time in Iraq. He was the guy that stuck his head out the top of the Humvee and manned the grenade launcher. Well in urban areas when he came under attack he just started letting them go. He didn't know where most of them landed. To me this doesn't necessarily sound like war crimes, seems like the horror of war most ignore when  talking about how badass America's military is. Those grenades easily could have blown children into strips."
todayilearned,fd49ptm,t1_fd40jbb,1578165655.0,"When I'm home, yes, I'm essentially a single dad. I don't know exactly what my daughter's mom does and doesn't do when I'm at work, but I know it's not much. She is basically how my father was, unfortunately."
todayilearned,fd3uo66,t1_fd2rg3q,1578161755.0,"Honestly I think we're tougher than our parents' generation's men. They really couldn't handle being tired very well. We are fucking exhausted and we still make time for our kids because we didn't get that. I'll work 16+ hours, get 4.5 hours of sleep, get my daughter ready for school, on the bus, clean, shop, cook, clean, get her off the bus, do homework with her, play, cook, clean, bath her, read with her, play some more, get 7-8 hours of sleep, work another 16 hour shift, then do it all again. I've fallen asleep playing with her many times but she keeps coming back so I guess she doesn't mind.  It's exhausting but worth it. My dad worked 10 hour days and then watched TV, then slept and watched tv all weekend. He could put a drill bit through his foot without blinking an eye but a little sleep deprivation was more than he could handle."
todayilearned,fd3sofg,t1_fd3daul,1578161354.0,"It's like hanging around the dumbest person possible and being responsible for their every need. They have almost no intuition. My daughter is 6 and still trips over my feet if they're under a blanket. You can't make any moves when they're around you because they'll walk right into you. If they're standing in front of the garbage and you're holding garbage standing right there too you have to ask them to move. My daughter saw a sticky glue trap on the counter and immediately stuck her hand into it. They know almost nothing.  And they think they know everything.  They're constantly trying to get over on you and you have to be constantly vigilant. I am a corrections officer and work feels very similar to the time I spend with my daughter. Kids eat chocolate on top of your important papers, will go to the bathroom with or without diapers on, do any task you give them as slowly as possible and you have to act like they're doing a good job, love you one second and hate you the next, get permanent marker on table tops, fall down and somehow up things, fill the house with clutter faster than you can imagine, cry over the smallest things at the worst times, and try to get pulverized in parking lots. It's the most amazing thing when you look in their eyes the first time and it never loses its magic, I love every second of being a father."

MadeMeSmile,fckeikh,t3_ehke97,1577723540.0,"Within the past hour I fell asleep multiple times while watching my daughter in the living room (not home alone, her mom's in the house too). Every time I fell asleep she poked me in the face with a pencil and asked me how to spell another Disney character's name."
