Competitiveoverwatch,feo1ulw,t1_feo1jga,1579294042.0,Same. They've really switched up during this offseason.
Competitiveoverwatch,feo1h82,t1_feo1cyk,1579293836.0,"They aren't physical jerseys. They could easily be switched. The last time they changed the colors it was changed in-game for free. It wasn't as drastic a change by any means, but still."
Competitiveoverwatch,feo12fd,t1_fenzxi9,1579293606.0,I can't believe they're making their fans rebuy their skins. That's such bs.
depression,feg495h,t3_eoxun3,1579076217.0,"Same bruh. It’s pretty much my entire identity/personality at this point, so without it I have nothing. Measuring how depressed I am at different points throughout the day is a daily routine, and without that I don’t know how’d I’d feel."
depression,fdpt8ih,t1_fdpszda,1578639561.0,No problem. Hope you can work things out with your loved one.
depression,fdpt4sv,t1_fdpssz2,1578639447.0,It’s a really complex field. There’s different strains to try and different ways to consume it so that it doesn’t punch as hard and is a little more easy-going. Just have to experiment to find what works best for you.
depression,fdpsu8w,t3_emmfkf,1578639128.0,"It’s your conscience aggressively making everything you think of negative. For me it’s intense feelings of pointlessness, anger, paranoia, etc. 

Everyday is a flatline of emotions; there’s never any happiness, only dread and internal suffering. When it’s really bad it will physically hurt as well. It’s like a full-body feeling of exhaustion and an aching sadness. 

Everything around you, including your mind, seems as if it’s underneath a dark filter."
OverwatchLeague,fdiq8sq,t3_elj85l,1578448604.0,"The green and gold was great imo, it definitely stood out from the rest of the league. Just bandwagoning onto the Chargers is a cheap move. Ruins the individuality as well."
depression,fdg47de,t1_fdg0nqj,1578379369.0,sorry if my comment was a little hostile. i’m glad you’ve been able to make some progress with yourself :) i understand what you’re saying. i guess i just misunderstood in the original comment you made.
depression,fdfzz1x,t1_fdf9r63,1578375118.0,a lot of people who feel the way this post describes can’t help feeling depressed though. saying there’s no point in living your life depressed is really ignorant. it’s not as easy as 123.
SuicideWatch,fbgy9jz,t1_fbfyrql,1576861330.0,but can you really expect a man to live for a food? i know you said “or whatever” but it’s easier said than done to find something worth living for and sometimes impossible.
