WTF,ff7ixz5,t3_erwg99,1579650636.0,"So I was hypnotized recently and I made a fool of myself on stage.  I was skeptical and didn't believe it, but it worked......probably because I was tired and was able to get super relaxed as the hypnotist instructed.

I honestly think that hypnosis is the reason things like this exist.  The guy that leveled the woman was probably told to relax and do a few things to put him in a state of hypnosis (without calling it hypnosis), but it didn't work.  It doesn't work on everyone.  I think that's how believers are susceptible to this kind of bullshit.

I also think (without any research, mind you) that hypnosis might play a part when mega church preachers touch someone on the head, causing them to collapse or fall down, or perhaps whenever an exorcism is performed, or even when churchgoers speak in tongues.  I don't believe it's all acting, but at the same time I bet that under a state of hypnosis, they ""play the part"" that is suggested to them.  Just a shower thought I had recently,  and this video made me think of it.

worldnews,fdl80ji,t1_fdks6gs,1578518604.0,">But who gets to decide what's misinformation? Especially in political topics? I understand the sentiment but I think it's terribly misguided if we let private companies or governments decide what ideas are permissible

Those are very important questions that must be considered before any changes are made.  First and foremost, private companies *already are* deciding what ideas are permissible.  Twitter censors ideas by banning people that make posts that speak against their political or social ideologies. 

In the case of OP's post, any social media company should absolutely be obligated to remove posts that promote and/or incite violence.......no exceptions.  If twitter and facebook have these complex algorithms that basically know what you want before you even know it, then they can develop algorithms to weed out hate speech and violence, etc.

Another step I think is necessary.......these social media giants need to have a clear and concise set of terms and conditions, and if they choose to ban a user, they should disclose exactly how the user violated those terms.  twitter should not be able to ban people for saying something that goes against their political ideologies.

Fake news:  this is tricky, because who determines what fake news is?  Well, one example of fake news that's detrimental to society as a whole.......anti-vaxxers.  Thanks to social media, we have a group of people who get to spread lies and disinformation.  Right now, twitter has the ability to censor it, but they don't. This presents an actual danger to the public.  I think a reasonable law would be able to distinguish misinformed posts vs. posts that are intentionally misleading, as well as posts that are inherently dangerous, and hold twitter liable for the terrible outcomes of a user's shit-postong.  For example, if Karen is vocal about not vaccinating her kid, and she has an extensive history of shit-posting about how vaccinations cause autism and etc, if an outbreak at her kid's school can be traced back to her, why not hold twitter partially liable?

There are probably better ways to go about regulating these social media giants, but they have such a major impact geo-politically and domestically, and we have seen very little social responsibility demonstrated by these companies.  They can't continue what they are doing without checks and balances in place.

Edit:  also, in Sacha Baron Cohen's speech, he addresses a need for moderators.  They don't employ enough/any moderators as it is.  If Reddit didn't have any mods volunteering their time and desire for making their subs great conduits of discussion, then Reddit would become a giant cesspool of garbage, much like 4chan"
worldnews,fdknq1c,t1_fdkhksf,1578507379.0,"I definitely see both sides of this argument, but when these companies encourage divisiveness, allow it to be weaponized to spread misinformation and propaganda, aid in the tampering of foreign elections, sensor their own platforms in order to push their own agenda while denying their own users the free speech that these social media networks claim to be a pillar of, I feel that some kind of action and responsibility is necessary."
