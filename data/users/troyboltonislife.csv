PublicFreakout,ff5b6bi,t1_ff4106p,1579585896.0,That’s exactly what I was thinking. While yes he shouldn’t have done it it’s almost entirely the fault of the guy who got slammed that he was slammed that way.
PublicFreakout,ff5b17z,t1_ff3j3lx,1579585758.0,Also think it was his fault by flinging his feet up making him more vertical and landing on this head. The kid doing the toss was most likely trying to do a mostly horizontal toss and just barely lifting his feet up but the kids feet just fling in the air.

AskMen,ff4ftc0,t1_ff3v0tk,1579562581.0,advil doesn’t mess up your liver though. Tylenol does but advil might just fuck up your stomach but your liver is fine with it.
sarmsbible,fezpgrv,t3_eqljg9,1579460021.0,"I’m just gonna tell you what I did, as I was in your same position.

 I just didn’t take my daily dose on days I drank. That’s it. LGD has a half life of like 36 hours so I  felt like if I wasn’t working out that day there was no point in dosing (and I didn’t work out on days I drank too). A lot of people are gonna call that stupid cause your supposed to be cycling but I really didn’t experience any issues with it and I would just take a fatter dose the next day. (I was only doing 5mg a day). 

I def still saw gains but YMMV"
hangovereffect,fezkocu,t1_fexhbp6,1579458331.0,your remedies and symptoms are hard to read

hangovereffect,feu781p,t3_eqjvex,1579383799.0,"If everyone on this sub took the survey we would come so close to figuring it out.

also I think it would be worth mentioning sleep deprivation in this survey because sleep deprivation seems like a common way to replicate the effect and I was positive I matched with the symptoms others described when I saw that."
realestateinvesting,fetoipz,t1_fetfper,1579377637.0,Depends on the law but a lot of time they do.
realestateinvesting,feskavh,t1_fesfajj,1579366121.0,"Yeah I just don’t understand the economics of these types of markets. They’re pretty much everywhere that’s expensive to live. But I would assume that rent prices keep up with house prices but they obviously don’t. Where I live, renting doesn’t make sense based off property taxes alone. $500,000 houses with like $12,000 property taxes and $2000 rents. Deductions help but when you do all the numbers, it becomes really difficult to justify investing here."
realestateinvesting,fes94p8,t1_fepqwty,1579362757.0,"Then don’t do real estate in Ontario. Also I’m sure these laws didn’t just spring up out of the blue. They were proposed, talked about, and then voted through. If you had done your due diligence you would have seen this coming and gotten out. I’m sure the smart investors did. 

Any investor complaining about over regulation is a bad investor. First off, If a liberal government is going to make it “impossible” for you to make money then you should get out. If every investor left a market the policies would have to change cause market prices would tank and cities don’t like that. Second off, everyone over exaggerates how laws affect their bottom line. If you’re a good landlord then tenant friendly laws have very little effect on you. 

If anything these laws can be good for you because it gets rid of all the amateurs. That’s the way I would look at it."
realestateinvesting,fes5pft,t1_feptkxv,1579361691.0,I don’t get this though. Why don’t rents match home prices?
PKA,fem5erk,t1_fell8rp,1579240373.0,They can still be a raunchy podcast and professional at the same time. Considering how much the show makes there’s no reason for them to not be professional in the sense of not fighting with each other mid show.
PKA,fel9g1r,t1_fekjjoq,1579216962.0,"I think the worst part about it is just the unprofessionalism of it. Like if it was just the three of them it would have been way less cringe but they made the guest feel super awkward and out of place because woody can’t take a joke. Like the guest had to jump in and ease tensions with “well good thing there’s 4 hours to talk about everything” because the situation was so awkward. This is what bothers me about this podcast. After listening to a ton of other podcasts recently, I’ve realized this type of shit would NEVER fly on professional podcasts."
baseball,fel6735,t1_fekrqzr,1579214915.0,"It feels unfair to me that Beltran is being punished when other players are not having their names being published and dragged through the mud. 

I get why given that he is the only non-active player and thus not protected but it bothers me in a general fairness sense. These players who were just as complicit as Beltran and definitely benefited more than him are facing no repercussions."

iamverysmart,fek5xdi,t1_feies52,1579193284.0,"nah it’s totally doable. he probably was renting out servers from large companies, configuring them for like minecraft or something and selling it."
umass,fei03cq,t3_ep9hl8,1579127383.0,"Pats a really nice guy. The class was overall decently easy. You learn how to use Latex which unless you go on to write math papers is pretty useless. You do make a resume and stuff in it. 

The thing that frustrated me the most about the class was that some of the assignments involved actually really hard and complex math that would take me hours to figure out when the point of the assignment wasn’t to learn new math but to learn Latex. If this happens meet with him and you will save yourself so much time. He’s pretty good about scheduling office hours. 

You make a physical project that is supposed to take like 20 hours or something. That’s really not that bad tho. I recommend doing something with like wood or cardboard. The people who said they did origami sounded like it took forever for them. I did a galton board as did like 3 other people. Mine was easily the worst one and I still got an A on it. 

You also have to make a video project with a group of your classmates. So make sure you befriend people in your class at the beginning. and try and find someone who’s good at making videos. My group saved me here cause one of the kids was experienced making videos. 

You also write a research paper which wasn’t too bad. 

Biggest takeaway is if your struggling with anything to just meet with pat. That’ll save you time."
