Because they are criminals, it would actually be just to arrest them imo. You spoke of Russia and China but i don't think it's like that at all in those specific republicans cases. I also think blair should go to jail.

But yes I suppose every congressperson who voted in favour is not Automatically a criminal, maybe slightly complicit tho but I really hate the Iraq war so that's just my extreme position.

Well I mean some morals are important, some actions are just wrong. Well it's human nature to be concerned with that imo, we're some of the most social animals in existence of course you want to avoid those that you think would be harmful to you or nasty etc. Its all about the group, the society and how it functions, altruism is key there. 

But maybe you're right about true altruism, it maybe isn't possible to do a good deed and not boost your ego slightly. 

Some babies are altruistic I think,  but it might be observed from their parents and stuff."

I don't think I do, you're getting very animated by the sounds just because someone disagrees, seems kinda insecure to care that much.  

I consider myself more moral than immoral, I give to charity, I do things for others. But I'm also a bit selfish, but that's ok. But I'm not the best person in the world that's for sure. But that's not entirely relevant the question ""does altruism exist?""

I'm not sure you're moral though, I mean by your logic it doesn't matter everyone is selfish and immoral so I can just be nasty and selfish. Just sounds like an excuse or justification for selfishness and self centred egoism."
