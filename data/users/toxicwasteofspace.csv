college,ffu73fo,t1_fftye1e,1580235878.0,"Studying languages or translation in Italy is one of the worst decisions you can make because the market is overcrowded as fuck. We have a specific high school path for learning languages, I think in the last few years it's been the most popular among students. That means we have tens of thousands of people who graduate from that type of school every year and the natural progression for them is to either learn how to be a translator or do some absolutely useless Foreign Literature degree (it must be the least marketable degree you can possibly get, much worse than philosophy or anthro or even classical literature AND there's way too many people in the field). Going in the field when you're not even particularly passionate about it is suicide, plus OP has a good level of English but I don't think it's exceptional. To get an idea of just how competitive the market is, try looking for any gig where you have to translate from English to Italian or vice versa... one Summer I must have made 10 different accounts on freelancing sites and I was not able to get even one job."

Either there are enough people with the same background as me, so they understand that my experience was unconventional which makes me feel insecure and ashamed   

Or there aren't enough people with the same background as me, so I stand out, which makes me feel insecure and ashamed   


Fuck me. I would give anything to just go back in time and fix this mess of a life I've created for myself and that I keep making more needlessly complicated. Btw, if you're wondering what mistakes I could have possibly made that makes me so ashamed, if I was a criminal or something... I literally just had a couple years of being a very bad student. I kept making my situation more complicated and weird and now I have 0 normal high school experiences to talk about, as a college freshman. So that's fun"

FemaleDatingStrategy,ff02sdh,t3_eqvr17,1579464555.0,"Yes they are much cheaper. Fellow Italian here but I get lots of American matches on Tinder because of transfer students + Vicenza army guys. I'm just a young student so it's not like I have high expectations, but local dudes literally won't pay for more than a coffee while Americans will offer right off the bat to take you on a movie + pizza date (doesn't sound like a big deal but again, we're just young students). I think a big part of it is just that they're more chilled out, Europeans feel like going on a date is on the same level of commitment as asking for your hand in marriage. Girls and guys my age will basically spend months texting each other before they go on a single date, it drives me fucking insane."

Also if people have already made friendships it's going to be 99.99% impossible to insert yourself in these already formed groups. Don't go out of your way to avoid people, because that makes you look even more stunted, but don't have high or even low expectations for anything because I guarantee from personal experience that they're going to be shattered."

FemaleDatingStrategy,fdukitf,t3_en08sg,1578734349.0,"I swear Reddit users are on some bullshit. The top commenter is basically advocating that a man should be able to opt-out of being a father so that the woman would feel pressured to abort the child? Like he's not saying that outright but if you read between the lines that's essentially it. Sure, leave the mother of your child to fend for herself because you're too much of a coward to step up and be a father and too cheap to pay child support. Thank God these are only Reddit circlejerk opinions and they're not widespread irl"

Like it's cringy to watch because the interviewer insists for a bit but that's the only thing he's able to say about her. I also have this theory that if Pewdiepie hadn't gotten into reading books and later developed an interest in philosophy he would have never married Marzia... the recent influx of literature to his brain definitely made him develop a bit, he still doesn't act his age but he might be getting there"
