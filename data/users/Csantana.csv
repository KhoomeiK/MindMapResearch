marvelstudios,fgocw9m,t1_fgnbkgn,1580965902.0,to be fair he's probably talking less about collectors and more about kids buying toys. But at the same time screw him.
marvelstudios,fgoch8r,t3_ezji40,1580965546.0,"I don't like the ""he's a friend from work"" line in Thor 3. Some people have called the new Thor ""Bro Thor"" which I don't think is entirely accurate but I don't think that spending as little time as he did on Earth that Thor would change the way he spoke so drastically. 

Of course a lot of people liked it and the line apparently came from a a make a wish kid who got to visit the set so it's a pretty petty complaint. 

It's also kinda how I feel about the whole movie since I was hoping for something more I guess serious and dramatic for lack of a better word. And the movie is a pretty goofy comedy. 

That being said it is undeniably good and some of the jokes like ""piss off ghost"" just get me based on delivery."

politics,fgmimqc,t1_fgmgc00,1580925323.0,I don't think so. He's saying that she is disrespecting the Constitution in general probably with the Impeachment and other things. Which makes sense since that's something that's something political rivals have been accusing each other of for a long time. Not that I'm any fan of Trump and the Repubicans at all since clearly they care about being in power more than actually respecting the law.

GatekeepingYuri,fgj7xan,t3_eyqlzj,1580838722.0,"The milkmaid wants to be married (since that's supposed to be every woman's dream at the time) in the beginning but must wait. She isn't particularly attracted to men but surely she thinks that must be the case of all women no? Through a bizarre set of circumstances she meets the noblewoman. Who is married but not really satisfied or truly in love with her husband. They develop a fast friendship and the milkmaid doesnt understand the noble woman's melancholy and argue s that she should be happy to be married. The noble woman explains how marriage isnt always what it should be and how she doesnt love her husband. Not in the way that...she loves...the milkmaid. 

The milkmaid is taken aback at first. Since a love between women as sisters is always encouraged, (though many of the nobility does not like their friendship) but a physical love between women was never something she was taught to value. Still she cannot deny her own feelings. The two find times they can escape together and enjoy each other's ""company."" Even though the noblewomans mother in law disapproves of the ""friendship."" The kind butler who probably knows more than he let's on helps them avoid her. 

In the end the noblewoman contracts smallpox and dies with the milk maid by her side. The nobility didnt want her there but everyone who tried to stop her was too afraid of also catching smallpox to do so. She was immune of course so she was safe. 

The noblewomans husband marries again but the milkmaid never does end up married. She mourns the noblewoman and is surprised to receive a package from the butler. At first it seems it's just a pair of shoes but inside is a locket with the faces of the milkmaid and the noblewoman inside."
