AustinBeer,fg1e5pk,t1_fg1a6sw,1580425495.0,We'll find out this week. Probably the biggest wildcard of the bunch. I suspect I'll have strong feelings one way or the other. Will report back since you asked.
AustinBeer,fg1dw64,t1_fg163jy,1580425367.0,"It really ties the room together, does it not?"
AustinBeer,fg0q40n,t3_ewaucx,1580412822.0,Thanks for the heads up about the Central Market beer sale. I'll be prepared for when dark beers become scarce in the spring.
Jokes,fg0agum,t1_fg046jm,1580403681.0,"Keep trying, you can get this one!"
hotsaucerecipes,ffzfuvm,t1_ffyktfp,1580376986.0,I was thinking on the NYSE
hotsauce,ffzfnr7,t1_ffzbzhf,1580376694.0,It tastes like Baltimore.
ThatsInsane,ffy9g78,t3_evq6za,1580341175.0,My contact lenses melted to my eyeballs just watching this
AustinBeer,ffy2nmt,t1_ffx8ytt,1580337395.0,"Sorry, I'm dense. 20% off a purchase of $25 or more?"
fantasybaseball,ffxne6x,t1_ffx6mjm,1580328661.0,"That May 28 v BAL game is the one that stands out to me the most. Maybe they thought as a soft opponent, they'd push the limit of how much they can cheat without anyone noticing? Like a soft run for ramping it up before division rivals and a tough AL East+MIN stretch."
instantpot,ffx0lsj,t1_ffwua5e,1580315182.0,"Nice. I usually scale up so we only have to cook twice a week, so I'll be sure to keep that in mind! I should have gone with the 8qt IP!"
austinfood,ffwu6ku,t3_evko1y,1580311086.0,"It's about 2 hours away, but Niki's Tokyo Inn in San Antonio has the best fried egg rolls I've had in Texas, with an outstanding house made spicy Chinese mustard. I haven't found one I'd recommend in Austin yet, so I'm all ears."
instantpot,ffwtna4,t3_evi1ej,1580310730.0,Sweet. I'm on the lookout for quick and easy recipes I can make later in the week with ingredients I have on hand. Thanks for sharing!
DIY,ffwevv2,t3_ev7dko,1580298380.0,"Nice. I just had the same problem. But my oven is ancient and the screws for the handle are situated in a way that was never meant to be dealt with after building... it would mean pulling the door off the hinge and removing the entire front panel. And of course there are no replacement parts, so it'd be a janky fix even if I had that kind of time. Using a commercial grade suction cup handle for now. Hope it doesn't melt."
explainlikeimfive,ffvqlmf,t1_ffvi820,1580270517.0,"Reminds me of my HS physics teacher. For finals, he let us write down whatever formulas we could fit on an index card. I was the type to pay a lot of attention in class but never did my homework. Night before the final, I'm cramming in all these formulas on the card and it hits me: that MF tricked me into studying!"
todayilearned,ffvoi8u,t1_ffuwcnu,1580268997.0,"I think about this dynamic a lot, given the current macrotrend of wealth consolidation. You hear these guys make claims that their philanthropy is more effective than whatever the government would do with the money if they were taxed in line with historic norms. I'm sure there are compelling cases to be made on each side of that claim, but the bottom line is that they benefit from a society that enables them to accrue that much wealth and there's not much accountability in place to ensure they return the favor. I think the term ""billionaire"" would be a lot less demonized today if there were more outward philanthropic gestures, like Carnegie's libraries. Gates bought himself a lot of goodwill, considering how reviled he was a generation ago. People love Musk because his money makers are ostensibly about helping reduce greenhouse emissions. Bloomberg's bankrolled a lot of Sierra Club efforts. Is Bezos widely known for philanthropy? He could've been dropping a billion a year into my favorite causes and I haven't heard anything about it. Zuckerberg seems like the kind to give the world free internet just to expand his user base. I guess my point in the end here is that when you're a modern day Carnegie, you should be making it super obvious that you're putting your money back into the system that created you."
politics,fftiwms,t1_ffta3es,1580221742.0,"This point seems to be getting missed. Bolton and Trump agreed that Iran was a problem. Bolton would want to maximize the strategic effect of any action, while Trump only cared about how he could cash in on it. Bolton is likely on the outside of Trump's insider deals when it comes to runs on defense stocks."
politics,ffti2tw,t1_ffsvj48,1580221123.0,"Bolton needs to testify, and his opening line should be, ""Cancel work tomorrow and get out in the streets. Ukraine is just just tip of the iceberg."""
texas,ffrvp7u,t1_ffrr3nn,1580166915.0,"I thought about saying that, but chose not to be pessimistic"
AustinGardening,ffrq4j4,t1_ffro2z0,1580163333.0,"""What's your story, morning gl----"" ""DEATH FROM ABOVE!!!"""
texas,ffrpyxz,t1_ffro9jn,1580163236.0,The fact that it's gross is why I think it works as a metaphor.
texas,ffrok0d,t1_ffr0kzi,1580162356.0,"I'm not an expert on homelessness, but I figure if they find $3 they'll spend it on food instead of spraypaint."
texas,ffro7hm,t1_ffrlljz,1580162141.0,It's spray paint public masturbation. A fleeting bit of fun for the person doing it and a mess for everyone else.
fantasybaseball,ffrnuz7,t3_eusxnp,1580161930.0,This is great for dynasty people with Marte. Also with Marte.
AustinGardening,ffrmyay,t1_ffr8y5z,1580161381.0,Solid local advice. Thanks! I threw a couple handfuls of seeds in select spots. If I'm not happy with how it goes this year I'll just spend the rest of my days fighting their progeny.
todayilearned,ffjvzs1,t3_etytlb,1580008465.0,How much did Cee Lo Green make?
politics,ffjujbq,t1_ffj8rpt,1580007326.0,Just wait until he discovers Twitter. Oh wait...
