I actually have the same belief and value as you have stated, but I was just curious about your stance because you seemed passionate about it in the original reply. Thanks for letting me pick your brain and have a good one!"

ApplyingToCollege,fbnml82,t3_edw1qg,1577000086.0,"I disagree personally as someone that comes from a poor and rural area in a state that doesn't fund schools and especially small ones. Where most of the kids don't have the internet at home. I realize my privilege, but many of my friends don't have this opportunity and I think that is a big reason why I have higher scores. I don't really feel like debating this late at night or on winter break so I will just leave these links here so you can do some interesting research and reading yourself. There are many flaws with the education system in general that we need to fix, but all the old farts making laws are too stubborn to agree on a better plan. 

Have a good one and enjoy the holidays bud.
