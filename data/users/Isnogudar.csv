rpdrcringe,fecu352,t1_fecsizf,1578984655.0,"Nope. Can’t answer to every stupid „hi“ from an empty profile. And most of the time if you say you’re not interested, they pull you into a debate over it."

leagueoflegends,fdqbrfm,t1_fdq6uw3,1578662320.0,And where Galio is actually useful.
leagueoflegends,fdq44bi,t3_emp033,1578653931.0,I thought the same about the ult in the sky. And then it spawns a Galio? What a waste.

rpdrcringe,fdjkfiv,t1_fdjhho4,1578475039.0,Especially his extreme overconfidence in the seasons while looking like hot trash or having the worst performance was so cringy.
leagueoflegends,fdhzw5y,t3_elh0f2,1578433213.0,But why doesn’t Xerath kill Skarner if he has vision?
YouShouldKnow,fdgi8sw,t3_el86o3,1578397910.0,Is this titlegore? Doesn’t the title imply something else than the post?
