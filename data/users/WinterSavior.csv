SquaredCircle,ffbzyfx,t1_ffb8z5b,1579787964.0,When he wrestles it's for a reason. Either to extend comedy angle or a very rare serious role. I can't remember the last time Spud even wrestled in TNA once he found his groove as a comedy wrestler. He had the hair vs hair match with EC3 though.
SquaredCircle,ffbmn1t,t1_ffbit4p,1579772929.0,"You got downvoted but based on his own line of thinking, you are correct. Booker T was the last, but if he means Jericho then he's acknowledging WCWs continuation in WWE, which is still going on today as they've absorbed it. So he defeated his own point."
SquaredCircle,ffbf709,t3_esmdup,1579762661.0,I know that you guys are trying to make this a so spiritual continuation of WCW but that's not how this works.
SquaredCircle,ffbf2jy,t1_ffbbyjv,1579762513.0,"That's not how that sounds at all. It sounds like *""he was a great wrestler, but the best thing he did was have kids who made me a lot of money.""*

If that was all he said then yes indeed, he meant what I said and not some ""family man"" business."

SquaredCircle,ff01oxl,t1_fezsfn0,1579464244.0,"He's also still relatively new and these movies have introduced him to a big audience quicker than The Rock got. He's no Rock of course, but we're gonna start to see people move him from support roles to focal point in the next few years. Right now he seems to be trying to show his acting range to not get typecast. I hear he did really well in Bladerunner"
