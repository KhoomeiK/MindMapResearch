AskReddit,ffpn0vj,t3_eu725g,1580099160.0,"I remember turning on the tv before school to watch cartoons while I got ready for school (5th grade) and the news being on every single channel. Since my brother and I had no other options, we watched the news. My brother saw the second plane hit live on air. We then went to school like normal and it wasn't a big deal at school (L.A. area). I heard some chatter, but I think the teachers were making it on the DL. When we got home, our parents asked us ""they didn't send you home early? We both got let off early today."" ""Why would you guys get sent home early because a plane crashed into a building in New York?"" It took a while before I understood the idea of terrorist attacks and that this was a matter of national security"

askscience,fec0q61,t1_feb8oyz,1578964931.0,"While thermoplastics can be melted and reprocessed, the high temperatures and shear forces used in recycling streams tend to degrade the polymer chains, reducing the molecular weight and negatively impacting the mechanical properties. Recycled PET (water/soda bottles) is often used for carpet, which doesn't need to be as strong or have good gas barrier properties"
askscience,feawalo,t3_eo8zzj,1578952836.0,"Recyclable plastics are linear polymer chains: think a bowl of leftover spaghetti noodles with no sauce that you put in the fridge. The pasta will hold its shape and if you try to break it apart, the noodles will tear (which is analogous to solid plastic). But if you warm it up or put some oil (solvent) on the noodles, they'll be able to slide past each other and flow and you can form the pasta into a new shape (recycling).   
  
Now imagine you took that same cold bowl of spaghetti and zip tied random noodles together. Now, no matter how warm you get it or how much oil you put on it, the noodles won't be able to slide past each other and the glob of noodles will maintain its shape. This is what (some) non-recyclable plastics are like. If you keep heating up the plastic, instead of melting, it will just burn instead. These are called crosslinked polymers, or thermosets (the other type is called thermoplastic). With this type of polymer, the physical object you see is one sometimes giant molecule because everything is chemically linked together. On the other hand, recyclable plastics are made of many (still very large) molecules"
