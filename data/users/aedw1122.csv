AskReddit,fc56m3x,t3_eg9zot,1577445878.0,"I have experienced a lot of sleep paralysis.

The first one is where i went to rock mountains with my siblings and there was a huge, giant T-Rex running after us. I couldn’t wake up, i was screaming but no one heard me, i wanted to move my body but it wouldn’t move. So i cried as loud as possible. I was helpless but eventually i woke up and my body was tired as hell.

There are many cases where i felt like i was awake, but couldn’t move, i call for help but no one was there to respond. I could hear people talking outside of my room and doing their activities, but as my body wouldn’t move at all, i screamed but my lips wouldn’t move. This happened so often, almost everyday a few years ago. Happened in day light when i was taking a nap.

The scariest sleep paralysis i have ever experienced is where i felt like i was awake, and i could see someone at the corner of the room. At the ceiling. Staring at me. The person was dressed like a grim reaper, all black with hoodie. I tried to move my body but I couldn’t, i cried for help but no one could hear me. It was terrifying.

The sleep paralysis happened so often even when i was taking a nap. Happened for like two to three years. Some people said the house is haunted. Scared the shit out of me.

And every time i got out from the sleep paralysis, my body would feel numb with tingling sensations, from on the top of my head, to my toes.

It happened so often that i could only remember few of the stories."
