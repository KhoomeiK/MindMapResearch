ZeroWaste,ffj5pwy,t1_ffixdhu,1579991066.0,"That's so silly, though! Especially when stores like Barnes and Noble and Books-a-Million exist with their non shrink-wrapped books that people are free to peruse! Plus, ya know, libraries and the internet.

Plus, aside from the obvious plastic problem, I wouldn't buy this book anyway if I can't at least skim through it to see whether or not it contains any valuable information. (And, I'm going to judge by it's cover and say that it doesn't really contain any groundbreaking information that isn't already widely avaliable on the world wide web.)"

Yep, I feel that one on a deep, personal level."
Aquariums,ff895wd,t1_ff7kwgb,1579669671.0,"Yes they absolutely can.
Lemme get on my soapbox for a second to remind people not to release their plecos into the wild. They've become a huge issue here in Florida, tearing up ecosystems and harassing manatees."
