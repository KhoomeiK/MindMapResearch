knitting,ffcrck6,t1_ffc7hxa,1579805665.0,"Get 2 16"" circular needles, divide stitches between them. Never look back. 

Benefits:

1. Less laddering between the end stitches - I get huge gaps when I try dpns.
2. The inactive stitches you just slide down to the cable, it's very hard to drop stitches this way. You can get into a rhythm where sliding from the cable back to the needle to knit doesn't take too long if your tension is just right.
3. Don't have to worry about losing the ""extra"" dpn 

Downsides: 

1. If you're not careful sometimes it can be easy to pick up the wrong needle and you get yours stitches in a weird loop. The upside is you will never get more than 1 row around with this method before noticing your mistake.
2. Have to buy double the needles."

ShitMomGroupsSay,ffc4olr,t1_ffapsov,1579791448.0,"I mean, this is the method I did, but we stayed in an area with just vinyl flooring, I cleaned messes up right away - actually, including the child in the clean up is part of the process. They know they did something incorrect, see that if they make a mess on the floor, they have to stop playing and do something less fun. 

The book I used is called Oh Crap! And it was very challenging but for people like me with both parents working full time and daycare not especially dedicated to making a transition like that (diapers are SO much more convenient than the first couple months of potty training.) Oh Crap is a high intensity way of getting the biggest part of the switch over and done with, then just continuing to reinforce it all. 

The idea behind letting them run around bottomless isn't so they pee and poo on the floor, but so you can recognize the signs they are about to go, and get them on a potty right away and foster opportunities for success. Kids in general want to do the right thing and get approval, but with a thing like potty training, the right thing is completely different from how they've done things their whole life, so they need more help figuring this out than anything else they've ever had to do."

Also fuck I'm only doing candidates I can remember the names of without googling it.

Eric Swalwell - He was the guy you had a crush on in Middle School when he was a nerd who moved away and came back in Junior year after beefing out on the wrestling team, but still has DnD handbooks in his backpack. You'll ask him to study with you for the AP Chem test and you'll have the purest make out session of your life but you're both too clumsy to get any further before your little sister gets home from lacrosse practice. It never goes anywhere but every time you lock eyes across the room at Honors Society meetings, your panties get a little wet.

Julian Castro - He has a twin brother. It's all going to happen in your head better than it could ever happen in reality. 

Kristen Gillibrand - She'll take you for a ride in her minivan while she waits for her kid's soccer practice to end, and she'll offer you a Capri Sun and some orange slices before kicking you out the hatchback. 

Kamala Harris - she has really high expectations and even when you fulfill her demands for rose petals on the bed and flattering candle lighting and all that, you always feel like you missed something you didn't even know she wanted and she noticed and she's disappointed in you. She's still gonna show you just how damn good she is and make your toes curl and your walk funny for a few days afterwards, but you know you're not marriage material as far as she's concerned. You're not in her league, you're not even on her planet. she'll always be the one you think about when you're with other women.

Tom Steyer - He likes to buy complicated sex toys and use them on you while he's fully clothed with his favorite plaid neck tie on because he has really low self esteem and doesn't think anyone would ever want to have penetrative sex with him. He'll try whatever you like if you ask nicely and he can keep his clothes on.

Michael Bloomberg - He watches you and Tom Steyer from the other side of a 1-way mirror, in a darkened room while listening to interviews of himself recorded off cable news.

Tulsi Gabbard - She will bite your head off with giant glistening mandibles afterwards in a ritual cult sacrifice. That's your kink though, so you're fine with it.

Andrew Yang - He's poly and looking for more people to help his family incorporate so they can take advantage of corporate insurance policies as a collective so his 6 girlfriends, 13 boyfriends, 7 non-binary partners and their 33 children can get preventative healthcare and increase shareholder value. 

Pete Buttigieg - He talks you into having sex on the beach but his interest fizzles out when he realizes how unpleasant the reality of it is. He doesn't get the joke when you [quote Star Wars at him](https://youtu.be/2tLf1JO5bvE ). You find out that he made plans to meet up with other friends at the Libertarian craft brewery two blocks away and you can't help but realize either he planned to show up late or he knew his beach plot was destined to fail because the timing just doesn't make sense.

Marianne Williamson - she leads a circle of undernourished people in waving some scarves over crystals representing their wounded chakrahs and everyone pretends to feel orgasmic sensations as toxins are removed from their bodies using the power of #goodvibes. When you try to see her again a week later, the yoga and wellness center is gone and replaced by a dry cleaners. You never know if it really happened or if the blondie they gave you was an edible.

Biden - he's got a mechanical, practiced rhythm. He leaves his unbuttoned crisp white shirt on and pressed navy pants dropped down around his ankles. Afterwards he asks you if you want anything from room service, but forgets what you asked for and only orders for himself. He's done this same ritual hundreds, thousands of times before. You get the feeling it's not about you -it never was.

Warren - she somehow knows everything you feel insecure about, and knows exactly what you need to hear and feel to restore your confidence.  She has decades of experience, has been many places and met many people and she brings to bear her wisdom of the world in a simple, humble way that makes you feel like you've come home for the first time since you were a kid. When you're both spent and basking in the afterglow, she wraps you in a handmade quilt that's just the right weight and softness. You doze off with your legs intertwined and have the best nap of your entire life, you know what I'm talking about, a little bit of drool coming out? When you wake up, the sun is just going down and bathing you in a beautiful golden light, and you can smell something delicious and wholesome like fresh bread, the quiet clatter of pots and pans and you know she's decided to keep you, and you feel relieved about something you didn't even know you were worried about.

Bernie - after you eat a delicious home cooked dinner at Liz's house of free range chicken eggs, fresh vegetables from her garden and crusty dark brown bread, you step out into the last rays of sunset. Across a field you see the silhouette of a man leaning on a shovel, and even at this distance there's something of a coiled, tense strength in his figure. As you walk across the darkening field, lightning bugs in numbers you haven't seen since you were a kid alight around you and the glow lights up his face as you get close. The soft light belies the intensity of his gaze, and he reaches out to you, holding you firmly, fixated. There's an urgent need in his grip, and you feel your blood pulse with longing. Before you know if, you're on your back, the strong smell of dewy grass filling your nose, and looking past his strong, sweating shoulders, you can see a sky full of twinkling stars, and even the milky way is visible here, far from the city lights. After a long, passionate night, you find yourselves passing out in the musty warmth of barn, the quiet sounds of cows and horses around you. When you wake up, you're covered in giant crochet blanket and Liz Warren left a thermos of hot cocoa and a plate of sandwiches next to you. You can hear Bernie forking hay and speaking softly to the animals nearby.

Edit: This is blowing up with my friends, please respond and let me know which candidates sexual energy you vibe with. This poll will be considered qualifying for the February debates."

Even when presented with sources they are incredulous and insist on deferring to their own recollection."
beyondthebump,fe7don7,t1_fe6oq1i,1578913157.0,"Yeah I agree with all that, the tone of my post was meant to be heavily sarcastic, I'm sorry if that didn't come across as clearly as I intended.

 She was criticizing my adherance to a specific book on potty training that had been working great for several months, but we had regressed at nighttime. Following the advice in the book, I started giving my son about half a cup to drink closer to bed time to get his body accustomed to holding more liquid at that time of day so he could go back to sleeping through the night.  This meant that while she was visiting us last week, I went to bed early, sleeping on the floor in my son's room to try and prevent bedwetting episodes and getting him on the potty - husband  was also still fighting off a cough and I was trying to let him sleep in peace without my getting in and out of bed and waking him up. So I looked a little crazy sleeping in a nest of blankets on the floor but it was the most efficient method of addressing all the current problems.

She was questioning the wisdom of giving the kid a small drink before bedtime - what we had done for months that had not helped was consistently cutting off drinks by 5:30 PM for a 7:30-8pm bedtime. We'd done that for months with the problem ongoing. It seems reasonable to switch it up to try and find a fix, right? 

But anyways that's just me ranting. I haven't really read too many parenting books in all truth, but the ones I've read I hold in high regard. It just slays me that she criticizes my methods of getting information in one breath then praises my husband for doi g the exact same thing to learn skills like mechanics and home repair in the other. Neither of us has had a baby before, neither of us has owned a home before. We're learning as we go, self-taught. I'm the same as you, there was no access to ""practice babies"" in my family either!

I get dizzy spells every so often, nothing like what you're describing but I've fainted a handful of times usually related to blood pressure issues. Anyways, the thing I remember most during those episodes was if my face landed on a cool tile floor, how comforting that feeling was while I waited for my vision to come back and if I was lucky, for someone to help me. 

If you can lay somewhere like a bathroom or kitchen floor with cool tiles and just shut your eyes. If you have earbuds put them in and put on white noise or some kind of meditative tone, music or whatever you like. And just lay there until you feel ready to go in and lay on the floor with your baby. Many times I remember curling up on the floor with a pillow and blanket to doze with my baby safely engaged with the play mat arm's length away."

I'm sure if it was excessive there would be a conversation about it but, shocker, we all act like responsible adults and communicate when stuff comes up and I've never seen it become a problem for us.

My almost-3 year old knows what ""not nice"" is and will let me know if I'm being ""not nice"". He understands promises made and promises kept or not kept - he usually gets a small food reward like a Hershey kiss for a successful #2 in the potty, but lately he saves up all his #2 for after we've brushed teeth and done bedtime routine. He did a really late #2 the other day and I didn't want to deal with brushing his teeth again at 10PM so I asked him if he would wait til the morning for his treat and he'd get a bigger than usual reward and he said ok.

If you think of Parenthood as a fandom, it makes a lot more sense. Like in any fandom, you have the people who just got into it, are super pumped and want to talk to anyone and everyone about it. They ask questions to groups they could easily Google because they just want to talk to other people about their cool new thing. They instantly jump in with both feet, want to plant their flag and be part of this thing they are so passionate about.

Then as they get settled in, they settle down a little, internalize the fan community standards, know where to look when they have a real question and save more philosophical questions for group chats.

Then after years have gone by and all the novelty is gone and theyve specialized their random focus (""Toddler Mom has evolved to....Soccer Mom!"") They move into another fandom or hobby all together, maybe if they are lucky something they can share with their kids like fantasy football or Minecraft and it all starts over again.

I can't tell you how many times I've gone through this process with different hobbies and fandoms and having a kid was no different. Finding the sub communities like Tula worshippers or cloth diaper brand stans paying $$$ for whatever specific print or toddler hiking groups. 

You'll find the over excited newbies in literally any community."

Jaskier is the Polish word for the flower Buttercup/*ranunculus*. Because buttercup has a certain connotation in English, it was originally translated as Marigold. Then the character named **Triss Merigold** was added, complicating matters. She was translated as Triss **Ranuncul** in the English books. And with the Witcher games, Jaskier becomes Dandilion and Triss stays Triss.

That's what I've come to understand, while the characters have other names as well in other language translations."

Sometimes I vented here and having my feelings validated would be enough to get me through another day. More often than not I would type a post up and save it in drafts without ever posting because I don't want to be a bummer, so i squash it back down and have to just keep slogging on by myself, since I have nobody else I can commiserate with. Those times don't feel good but it's all I have. How many other people on this subreddit sit in the dark like I so often, wishing they could speak up but feel they have to carry it alone? 

It's not that hard to keep scrolling when someone posts a vent post, the world itself is unsympathetic enough. Not everyone is neurotypical, not everyone has the same support system to help them get through those minor-but-major molehills. Sometimes it's *not* that big a deal but we don't get to choose what is a big deal to other people.

beyondthebump,fc2zfjh,t1_fc2q40t,1577377974.0,"Some kids are more sensitive than others.

Family members disregarding that intentionally or otherwise can be the straw that breaks the camel's back when you've got someone who maybe hasn't gotten more than 3-4 hours sleep a day in months. 

And it's not just ""being tired"" in many cases. Long term sleep deprivation can permanently affect the endocrine system which manages, amongst other things, emotional responses. This can affect people's ability to respond proportionately to situations, and it may be ""overreacting"" to ""a bit of cookie"" or what have you in normal terms, but in context of the individual and their physical and emotional health state, they may not have any control over how upset they feel."

AskReddit,fc2h6rh,t1_fc2frsu,1577360034.0,"Practicing patience is the biggest change I've had to make since my baby became a toddler, and I have to do the work for everyone around him too because my husband, my mom, most of the other adults I see interact with him, can't cope with crying or frustration emotions themselves and try to shut them down and it's a huge gross spiral. I have trouble too, that's why ""practice patience"" is something I say to everyone now including the kiddo. You won't get it right every time, but making the effort counts and kids will give you thouaands of opportunities to try again. 

Teaching kids how to work through frustration and validating their emotions seems pretty important - I have ADHD and at 33 one of the toughest things I deal with as an adult is feeling frustrated about something and giving up immediately then getting stressed because I know I need to do the thing but it's not coming easily. 

Kids are in a constant state of frustration like that - they are always hitting walls - either not capable yet or being told No by adults. No wonder they are always whining! So as adult my job is to empower my kid and show him what he can do whenever possible. Maybe he isn't coordinated enough to pour himself a cup of milk yet but he can 

1. Tell me he wants milk

2. Communicate what cup he wants (2a negotiate when that cup is inevitably dirty or location unknown)

3. Open the fridge try to take the milk out

4. Help hold the cup steady

5. Help twist the top on

6. Put milk away

It takes longer and you have to let him make mistakes sometimes but as they say, it's not worth crying over spilled milk, so showing your child that it's ok to make mistakes, address the negative feelings, how to cope and then move on is invaluable. If you just yell at them then tell them to get out and clean it up yourself they can't learn anything except that it's not safe to make a mistake around you. It's also important to show them they are worth your time. So often I have too tell him, ""just a minute mommy is busy"" or ""after I do this thing then it's your turn"" so making sure a child gets your full attention show them they are important too."
