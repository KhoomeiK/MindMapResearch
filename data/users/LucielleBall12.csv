cats,fedh2sm,t1_fedguhl,1579011335.0,"I've had horrible luck with my cats health (all 4 of them) and they're random cats I got, not anything fancy. I was hoping to at least attempt a healthier cat by buying a breed from a good breeder who does genetic testing so I researched all the breeds I was interested in to see their health problems to know what to ask the breeder about. Scottish folds were my first pick but I changed my mind once I read about them. I still have two of my original babies and won't be getting any new cat until they are gone but I settled on maine coons. I'm sadly VERY familiar with HCM so at least I know what to expect if they end up with it"
cats,fedgrd2,t1_fedgiuv,1579011094.0,When I read they can have to be put to sleep as young as 8 from the pain of their arthritis I couldn't do it. It's terribly sad. I read an article from a vet saying the breed shouldn't exist and people should stop producing it because of how much pain they have and I don't want to support that or have to end a life too young from that.
cats,fedfvww,t1_fedft8u,1579010413.0,I'm not great with fancy breeds so entirely possible. I do know Scottish folds can have straight ears (I was looking into buying a Scottish fold until I found out they suffer from severe arthritis)
cats,fedfh6o,t3_eok2wv,1579010090.0,That baby looks like a Scottish fold!
weddingshaming,fe4fpjs,t1_fe2yh5n,1578858754.0,I came here to say this!
AskVet,fdgd5l5,t1_fdg68s5,1578391067.0,Agreed
AskVet,fdgd3i1,t1_fdffxra,1578390980.0,"I had a cat that understood ow meant stop. I have zero idea how it happened but if he was playing with me and I said ow he would stop, I wish I knew how he learned it because I didn't teach it to him."
AmItheAsshole,fdd4zwr,t1_fdcln5p,1578295048.0,"My husband is allergic to clindamycin. Before we knew that I took it for 10 days. I promise we swapped saliva and he still lives to talk about it. Antibiotic allergies are not airborne, that's not a thing. If it was those people would have anaphylactic reactions almost everytime they went somewhere busy in public"
AmItheAsshole,fdd4whn,t1_fdcq49d,1578294927.0,It's amoxicillin and clavulanate. A very good drug with very broad coverage. Both humans and animals take it but obviously at very different doses and the animal pills come chicken flavored so they would obviously prefer it.
AmItheAsshole,fdd4stk,t1_fdcmt3f,1578294802.0,"You can actually, some medications vets don't carry and have to send you to a regular pharmacy. I know because I've picked up quite a few medications at a human pharmacy"
AmItheAsshole,fdd4l3t,t1_fdclxuq,1578294541.0,"You won't find anything. If it was an issue could you imagine what would happen to all these people if they went into public? Lord, imagine if they attempted to go into to a hospital, their throats would swell shut immediately."
AmItheAsshole,fdd4j0d,t3_ekn97g,1578294470.0,"NTA your roommate is crazy. 

You can only have an allergic reaction if it's ingested. Think of all the people in the world allergic to all the different types of antibiotics, not a single one of them would be able to go to the hospital if they had an anaphylactic reaction just by being near someone on it. In fact, they wouldn't even be able to go out in public because antibiotics are extremely common."

AskVet,fcpgddz,t1_fcpev01,1577862802.0,Diapers with a onsie so they don't shift. They have to be changed frequently and the cat needs to be cleaned well or they get burned from urine and feces

RoastMe,fcinsbg,t3_eh5mhc,1577665713.0,"I admit, I went over your profile and I'm confused as to why you even bothered posting on this subreddit. You appear to be very proud of your.....body type(?) and proudly proclaim yourself a hick (which I'm unsure if you realize hick = ignorant and stupid).

I just don't see any of us being able to actually insult a morbidly obese moron who thinks Walmart is a good quality store. Life is your insult friend, your future cardiac arrest will be quick at least."
netflix,fc946ek,t3_egmocs,1577546752.0,I liked it. I will admit I had zero prior knowledge about it at all and it took me what I consider to be an embarrassing amount of time figuring out that there was more than one time line but I definitely think it was worth it.

tifu,fc7cvil,t1_fc6w7yd,1577503719.0,You know cats can suffer from anxiety same as humans and there is actually medication for that. The first choice is Prozac as most anxiety cats tend to pee everywhere and it helps them to stop but if it doesn't work there are other drugs. My girl takes a combination of gabapentin twice a day with amitriptyline once a day as well as us having feliway around the house. She does need to be put on a very large dose of gabapentin with a valium to go the vets still but she does much better and her quality of life is much greater now that she isn't stressed out 24/7. When all of that stuff doesn't work I bought a shirt for her to wear because she rips her fur out until she's bald

 I'm just going to keep it short by saying you look at least 50, you are seriously unattractive and I'm POSITIVE you live in your moms basement fucking your fleshlight and screaming at your mommy to leave you alone because you're busy."
