dating_advice,fglad42,t1_fgl9z01,1580888023.0,I mean to be fair it wasn’t so much a charade. Sometimes people are so scared of losing someone that they never truly express themselves. Sometimes I think I should have seen it but it’s hard to see when they hide it and want to get married because of how well our lives fit together. We don’t have kids and are in our late 20s. Sure 9 total years gone but life moves on I’ll be alright.

seduction,fgksip6,t1_fgkpup3,1580872636.0,"Then the real part of having “game” is recognizing they are interested and not being an idiot about that. Pretty sure I still suck at that. Oh well. 

At the end of the day I’ve built myself a better life and there is a lot more to it than getting girls."
Tinder,fgkpvz0,t1_fgk1o90,1580870996.0,"Of the matches I currently have 1/5 are from super likes. I'm not sure if the supernness is off putting, but I imagine actually seeing the profile gets you a higher chance of being swipeond, and my impression of tinder based on my experience of getting \~20 matches my first week and maybe 10 or so in the 2 months since then is that a big part of tinder not working for guys is also just people not seeing your profile to swipe on it. Nothing has changed except at the beginning I presume lots of people saw me, and now they don't (I haven't changed a single thing on my profile)."
kings,fgknk1n,t1_fgjex8t,1580869594.0,"Last 10 years we have held the:

>\- 2010: 5th cousins  
\- 2011: 7th Bismack Biyombo  
\- 2012: 5th Thomas Robinson  
\- 2013: 7th Ben McLemore  
\- 2014: 8th Nik Stauskus- 2015: 6th WCS  
\- 2016: 8th Marqueese Chris (Turned into Bogi, Skal, and GOAT  Georgios Papagiannis)  
\- 2017: 5th Fox  
\- 2018: 2nd Bagley  
\- 2019: No pick but would have been 14th

Now, I don't know how many of these were trades or what not because well I'm not gonna research that thoroughly, but if we accept that if we average these results we should get close to what we have averaged in suckage for the last decade. Omitting last year we were the \~6th worst team in the league, which is some serious suck. Including last year closer to 7th worst which still sucks.

So far this year we are the 10th worst team by record. So a minor improvement if anything more mediocre but still suck, and yeah worse than last year. Lets see if we can do the opposite of last year and suck less in the second part of the year. After the All Star Break last year we were 9-16 (0.36 win percentage). Currently we  are 19-31 (0.380) so basically just as bad as we were after the break (marginally better, so marginal it doesn't mean shit). I'd much rather see us improve over the year than digress, so here's hoping for that."

seduction,fgkirv8,t1_fgkgaqp,1580866523.0,"Punish is just the wrong term here. Cause and effect is not punishment. 

“the infliction or imposition of a penalty as retribution for an offense.”

Not having sex isn’t a penalty or retribution it’s just an undesired outcome.  The food doesn’t punish you by burning your mouth because you ate it when it was too hot. That’s a simple negative outcome. Punishment requires intent, it needs to be inflicted or imposed. Not to mention the whole withholding thing which makes sex an object that can be given by a woman as opposed to a mutually shared experience."
seduction,fgkfuvb,t1_fgkbgbr,1580864587.0,"> witholding sex

I hate this term. Does she owe you sex? She doesn't want to have sex with you because you haven't made her feel comfortable sexy or whatever other reason. If you use your words and communicate and understand *why* she doesn't want to have sex with you, then you can do something to change it. Also not wanting to have sex isn't the sole provenance of women."

seduction,fgkb0g6,t1_fgk7256,1580861395.0,"Fun fact... punishment doesn't really work in conditioning whether with dogs or people.

Also don't try to classically condition people that's manipulative."

dating_advice,fgkalvn,t3_eyxdar,1580861130.0,">You have to be open for the possibility that others may try to use you for their own gains. They may not be looking for the same as you, and they may pretend to be looking for something else in order to convince you to go out with them.

Or .... in my experience keep up the charade till marriage years later. That was great."

dataisbeautiful,fgiybhx,t1_fginxv5,1580833451.0,It would be interesting to also see data on percentage of sun possible time. Of the amount of time the sun is risen what portion of that is it actually sunny. (Of course that struggles with the definition of sunny but that can be defined... like what is the maximum percentage of sky that is cloudy when you call it sunny?)
