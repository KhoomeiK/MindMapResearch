I'm a teacher and my supervisor was sharing a story about an out of control classroom at our last meeting. There was a 6 year old boy squatting in a chair scratching his chest and stomach with his shirt hiked all the way up. When his teacher asked him to put his shirt down, he shouted with exasperation, ""I'm itchy!"" My supervisor kept softly repeating, ""His nipple is out."""
