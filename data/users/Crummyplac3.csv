SuicideWatch,fdymuv7,t3_enakk8,1578781474.0,"This exactly. I think about it everyday. A scary and unhealthy amount. I've thought about how I'd do it, I wrote a note. I've thought of like everything. I'm just waiting until I really can't take anymore."
SuicideWatch,fdxy7cz,t1_fdxwcpq,1578774133.0,I mean. I'm not really into guys. But yeah. I guess I could.
SuicideWatch,fdxqfkp,t1_fdxpzcq,1578771805.0,"I don't know. I really don't. The possibility of me getting better is slim to none. I just feel I need to take my life into my hands, and do what I want with it."
SuicideWatch,fdxmkpp,t1_fdxl0zw,1578770595.0,"Yes, it really did, but it was so hard to come up with more material for my world. I'm not the most creative person, and it's difficult coming up with things. I haven't done it in about 6 months anyway."
SuicideWatch,fdxkpaz,t1_fdxk72e,1578769824.0,"Both?

I really like medieval sword fighting, magic, all that. But I also love sci fi, I'm really big on star wars, I like the laser weapons and space battles of sci fi"
SuicideWatch,fdxkhbw,t1_fdxkbnn,1578769729.0,I don't know. I guess anything is possible. But I don't think I can stay here.
SuicideWatch,fdxjmlk,t1_fdxiv3m,1578769378.0,"I was really into world building, so I tried doing that. I love the depth of it, how you can go so far into detail. Make your own everything"
SuicideWatch,fdxiktq,t1_fdxhhkg,1578769043.0,"Reading, writing, playing games, walking. Now all I do is listen to music, I still love music."
SuicideWatch,fdxguxi,t1_fdxg3wb,1578768569.0,"The human mind is both amazing, and completely terrible. 

I don't think so. I know a lot of great people that are supportive but I feel terrible everyday, consider suicide everyday. I've lost interest in almost everything I once loved to do."
SuicideWatch,fdxen4x,t1_fdxe32r,1578768018.0,"No. I sit in bed all day. Not having motivation to even eat. I'm constantly being pressured into doing something with myself. ""Get a job, go to college, get a job and go to college"" then they ask, what do you want? I have absolutely no idea what I want. I just know a job or college won't matter much when I'm gone."
SuicideWatch,fdxcqzb,t1_fdxc5t8,1578767482.0,"Sorry about how you're feeling. 

I still feel as awful as ever. Lonely, terrible, I feel hated, by myself and the people around me. I feel hopeless and helpless. I just want to leave"
SuicideWatch,fdxas1t,t1_fdx9m6p,1578766953.0,"I really appreciate your time and kind words. But I've given up almost all hope. I'm helpless, I'm a broken person never to be put back together. I just have to work up the courage to end my life."
SuicideWatch,fdxa5z7,t1_fdx7ug5,1578766839.0,I just don't want to be here anymore. Life isn't for me. I'm done here.
SuicideWatch,fdx54ix,t1_fdx4oy5,1578765457.0,"I've given up at this point. Not just on girls, on everything, I'm probably not going to be here much longer. But thanks for the whole ""tough love"" thing, I appreciate you trying."
SuicideWatch,fdu35b4,t1_fdtzo14,1578726695.0,"Same. I've never had anything in a romantic sense. Kiss, hug, girls don't like me. Guess I'm destined to be lonely."

atheism,fc9n721,t1_fc9d0gu,1577555210.0,"Yeah, I'm sensing a ton of bias here, a lot of churches do help, but yeah, everyone can believe what they want.  I too happened across this post, sure in every group, there's bad people, but it is right to classify the whole group as bad because of that? I Don't think so"
depression,fc402bx,t3_efyemj,1577403083.0,"I know exactly what you mean, I always feel fatigued, I either don't eat or overeat, I have no sex drive at all, I don't have motivation for anything other than turn my xbox on, and even then sometimes I can't focus enough to play any games, I haven't told my family in fear that they'll just say ""get over it"" or some shit. I just deal with this all on my fucking own, and it's pretty awful."
Anxiety,fbuegzs,t1_fbtxn8p,1577112983.0,"Yeah, I don't go out for weeks at a time sometimes, so it gets pretty bad."
