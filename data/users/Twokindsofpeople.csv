It's possible.  I follow politics closely and so do most of my close friends so I don't have a great feel for a good part of the electorate.

His growth comes from legitimizing his message and electability.  It took him 4 years and radically changing the democratic party to get to this point.  So Yang has two hurdles to overcome.  The first is name recognition which he basically conquered.  The second is convincing people that his radical changes are possible, good, and electable.  That takes work and I hope yang has a long future ahead of him in politics because I like the core of his message, but not a lot of the execution.

He attracted the hardcore xenophobes, sexists, and the junior fascists and motivated them to come out to vote.  He ignited a base that the mainstream republicans have been priming clandestinely for 40 years and now has their cult like adoration.  

He's stupid, but he does have a skill set and that skill set is conning people dumber than himself.  Pretending like he's a useless political operator is a great way to lose to him again.  He could, like he said, shoot someone 5th ave. and still have 40% of the voting population support him.  

Half of all voters are below average and he targets them relentlessly by telling them they're actually the smart ones.

One of the things in regards to medication it dealt with is the extreme changes antipsychotics can cause.  The lethargy, the mental cloud, and the other major adverse side effects it can cause, especially long term use.  

Joker was a story about how the system totally failed a man and how he sees the world that has not only given him nothing, but actively broke him down.  It's both a character study and a cautionary tale.  It's not the best this subject has ever been tackled, but it did it pretty well and it did it as a comic book movie.  It deserves praise for not only tackling a real thing but also having something to say about it.  That is, if you constantly kick a dog don't be surprised if it starts biting people.  It's not the deepest theme ever put on the big screen, but it's something unlike the bombastic nothing that Marvel has put out for the last decade.

Because you don't have the ability because I'm right.  Post black death, British common law gave the peasant class vastly more freedoms than anywhere else in Europe.  These things included keeping more of their crop, and most importantly, the ability to sell extra crop at market AND the ability to personally travel to the market to sell.  Both of those things were not universal in the rest of the continent  and both of those greatly increased the British peasant wealth.

no fucking way if you're talking about medieval.  Maybe early modern peasants could afford a LITTLE bit.   You're talking about the early modern era if you mean an average person would have the means for even a little bit of imported spice.  And I mean a little bit.  Even at 1700 nutmeg was (adjusted roughly for inflation) $400-500 a pound.  A peasant could hope to make on the very high end (assuming they owned an ox and weren't just doing everything by hand) $1- $2 a day if it was a super good ass year.  Way out of the price range of your average peasant.  It wasn't until the early 1800s that nutmeg, cloves, and mace were available outside the well to do or the Dutch.  Part of this was rising wages from industrialization and part of it was the collapse of the dutch monopoly.  This is in Britain, peasants in other countries during the middle ages didn't have it nearly as good as they did.

Edit:  ignorant motherfuckers down voting me.  Christ.  A medieval peasant buying nutmeg would be equivalent to someone making  between $100 to $400 a year buying a single malt scotch. A single seed would be 10% or MORE of their total yearly income.  That's in England where common law protected peasants economic rights much more than other parts of the continent."

horror,ff5bcqg,t1_ff4wrfg,1579586073.0,"Better on rewatch imo.  You notice all the little things getting set up.  Ari Aster is really good at giving his movies a pay off.  I wasn't a huge fan of midsommer, but there's no denying that what he set up payed off."
Games,ff5a1uj,t1_ff4a1y9,1579584806.0,"To me nothing tops mount and blade.  It's simple to understand and god damn insane to master.  It's fast, it's responsive, there's so strategy master and once you get good it's hard to compare any other melee combat system."
Games,ff59ufm,t1_ff4ht08,1579584615.0,"Mods.  I'm not a huge skyrim fan, and I honestly don't think vanilla is a really great experience, but modded to hell and back it is something special."
news,ff59jkq,t3_erou9m,1579584332.0,"Fucking crazy that in the middle of a fascist takeover of our government by reactionaries the left is doing its damndest to disarm themselves.  going after illegals is only the first tiny step.  Once they know they can trample the rights of a group they'll go after anyone brown, then black, then poor, then anyone who wears glasses.  The reactionary right needs an enemy, and their potential victims are jumping through hoops to make sure they're defenseless when the brown shirts come knocking."
Games,ff56zzh,t1_ff568be,1579582046.0,"Teleporter heavy offense totally fails unless you also have some beastly weapons.  Same with boarding drones.  They can be useful in the fight, but if that's your main offense then you'll be wrecked."
Games,ff56w84,t1_ff4weg3,1579581957.0,"Honestly, you always have to eventually go for some very good weapons.  the teleporter is great mid game, but it does fuck all to the flagship."

horror,ff56inw,t3_erio44,1579581637.0,"It's tied for the best Werewolf movie with Ginger Snaps 2.  Ginger Snaps back, is like the first but worse in every way.  I honestly recommend avoiding it unless you REALLY need more Ginger Sanpas action."
politics,ff4iery,t1_ff4ft3b,1579564361.0,"By the right wing.  Yes.  He was.  Like you're arguing with historical fact.  They hated him, they'd still hate him if he wasn't murdered."
politics,ff4fjar,t1_ff4dyur,1579562393.0,By the right he sure as shit was.  He was at 70% national disapproval.
politics,ff46bc1,t3_erehnj,1579556491.0,MLK Jr. is only honored after getting murdered.  When he was alive you better believe all currently old republicans who were young or middle aged at the time were suggesting he was an un american communist.
horror,ff2jcfo,t3_er6rmy,1579508742.0,"This is one of those movies that starts with a great idea, but no idea how to end it.  Ambiguity can work, but only if it serves the greater themes.  This movie used it as a crutch because it couldn't think of a good ending.  That's not to say I didn't like it.  I did, but Ari Aster is very good at providing a pay off, and Kill List just didn't have one."
horror,ff2ij4r,t3_eqzo61,1579507660.0,"Hell House!  Really half of the stuff by Richard Matheson invented modern horror tropes.   Ever seen a haunted house movie?  There's a good chance it was inspired a huge amount from Hell House.

If you want something more literary than pop, Blood Meridian is both the best American novel of the 20th century and the best horror story as well.   Cormac McCarthy's ""Child of God"" is another one that just stays with you.  It's grotesque and so plausible in escalation it sticks to your ribs."
horror,ff2ievd,t3_er6lyk,1579507504.0,"I love Wishmaster.  Wishmaster2 isn't as good, but it gives more campy djinn fun.  Now any Wishmaster after 2 is.... not good."

Honestly, the starting island had 2 of the 3 hardest fights in the game imo."
projecteternity,ff2i45f,t1_ff1dphv,1579507126.0,Penetration for sure.  If you're not at least meeting the enemies armor rating you may as well be casting nerf's many missiles.
