Also worth pointing out that in the case of the MAS, the breed was *heavily* based on an existing breed (Australian Shepherds), and the main thing they did was just make the breed smaller. (I am now patiently awaiting the wrath of the Aussie people for saying that.)

>The Miniature American Shepherd was developed in California during the late 1960's with the breeding of small, unregistered dogs that were thought to be Australian Shepherds. These dogs were bred with a goal of maintaining their small size, active character and intelligence.
>
>The breed was first registered with the National Stock Dog Registry in 1980 and was originally called the Miniature Australian Shepherd. By the early 1990's, they had attained nationwide popularity. Several clubs promoted these small dogs, as they were registered and shown with various rare-breed organizations. The first parent breed club and registry, MASCUSA, was formed in 1990 and incorporated in 1993. The breed entered the AKC Foundation Stock Service as the Miniature American Shepherd in May 2011.

Be honest about what you're looking for in a puppy, and the breeder should be able to help you out.
