hockey,ff7wcwf,t3_erxi6o,1579659923.0,It's one thing to be the guy putting up 1000. But imagine it being your son. That's gotta somehow be even better.
hockey,fewl8wt,t3_eqlwwk,1579413386.0,"Every season I worry, ""is this the year he slows down?"" The answer is always a resounding no, no it isn't."
videos,feut9zv,t1_fetijbr,1579389678.0,I distinctly remember seeing Peanut Butter Jelly Time at the end of the 90's.
videos,feusnmz,t1_fet410d,1579389550.0,"The way I feel about it is, the internet was sort of a ""wild west"" in those days. The internet seemed so much bigger. Now, the internet is essentially reduced to a very small amount of websites that most people indulge in. The internet doesn't feel as vast as it used to."
videos,feus6mt,t3_eqia5m,1579389404.0,Peanut Butter Jelly Time was one of the first I remember. I saw that in 1998 (or 1999...not sure which.)

Advice,fel7jr9,t3_ephod6,1579215753.0,"Operative words you yourself used were ""in my spare time."" Man, that's what spare time is for! Doing whatever it is that you enjoy doing. If you keep that balance it sounds like you have, then play on."
DetroitRedWings,fekgdht,t3_epfdk9,1579199481.0,"Undisputed favorite player of mine. Even after growing up in the 90s and seeing those teams, nobody has made me laugh, shake my head, and lose my mind cheering all at once more than Datsyuk."
cats,feik53j,t3_ep8lcb,1579140398.0,I demand occasional progress pics be posted.
Catswhoyell,fehybta,t3_ep233x,1579126321.0,I love Puddin'. She's just layin' her ass down; she ain't got shit to say.
pics,fe6elq6,t3_enwftt,1578888604.0,So instead of adopting a child already here they used your body to create a new one. Nice!

BlackPeopleTwitter,fdxxmxa,t1_fdxqmpa,1578773931.0,"The special itself holds up. It's a brilliant exercise in the medium of stand up. But part of the draw was Cosby's wholesomeness, which is the part that taints it."

PublicFreakout,fdxqprx,t3_en9pwq,1578771924.0,A speech isn't a public freakout you dumb dipshit. Will we be seeing MLK JR posts here soon?
cats,fdtb9dr,t3_en1653,1578714333.0,Admit it. You're just marrying him to get closer with his cat.
cats,fdozyiv,t1_fdndmsr,1578616737.0,"Same. I NEVER call my cat ""buddy"" *except* for this circumstance. It just seems apt."
hockey,fdm38kx,t1_fdl85y5,1578538755.0,It's crazy to think that even the worst NHL player has the sort of skill that would drop jaws if you played them in a rec league. The elite players possess skills that are even greater than they appear.
cringepics,fdio6nr,t3_elh299,1578447286.0,"My sister made me mad, so I want to potentially have a fucked up sore hand for the rest of my life."

hockey,fdfah3w,t1_fddbfpf,1578357103.0,I think I'm in the minority that enjoys it. Adds to the fan atmosphere of the game.
PublicFreakout,fdbcy8q,t1_fdauha3,1578256161.0,"Not only that, they could be inhibiting people from picking up their kids, taking care of a sick relative, etc. But these short-sighted pseudo-activists aren't capable of complex thinking like that."
PublicFreakout,fdbb8wo,t1_fda78ew,1578255660.0,"Exactly. If I get written up at work because of a protest, even if I completely agree with it, it accomplishes nothing."
DetroitRedWings,fd7cwjp,t3_ek8hpj,1578202522.0,"I have no problem with what Larkin said, but you have to admit that Burke isn't unfair in his assessment. The All Star Game may be an increasingly irrelevant novelty that seems to be more of a chore than fun, but it can be argued that maybe he should have kept these comments to himself."
cats,fd7bp3n,t3_ek1oe6,1578202043.0,He was absolutely interrupted doing serious cat business for this call.
hockey,fd7ax3o,t1_fd6ytfc,1578201740.0,"Honestly though, at least from the angles I looked at, it doesn't seem like Perry intended to hit the head at all. It looked to me that he was intending to play the puck, and it just kinda happened. Leon deliberately got the arm up to go for the head in this instance. I'm the last person that wants to defend Perry, believe me, but I'm just not as convinced as everyone else that he intended on a blindside hit to the head."
PeopleBeingJerks,fd747zj,t3_ek111k,1578199218.0,"I have a good feeling that somebody took this pup on and he's living a much, much happier life right now."
hockey,fd6nn9h,t3_ek0az8,1578193511.0,"Even more Deliberate than Perry's, yet the pitchforks aren't up as much and I guarantee the league doesn't hand out 5."
hockey,fcz3o9l,t1_fcylat6,1578093016.0,Definitely good that he has a redeemable issue and not an irredeemable one.
hockey,fcy32jd,t3_ejhukg,1578074059.0,Fuck Kovalchuk. Stay in Russia.
Advice,fcwggsu,t1_fcvu6wy,1578024996.0,">I wouldn't give him brownie points for playing the ""wouldn't do that to a bro"" thing. Yeah no shit, that's like the implied rule

I think it's worse that he refers to her as ""that"" with her sitting right there. It comes across as objectifying, as if her interest was irrelevant, and that there's only *one* thing standing in the way - their ""friendship."""
personalfinance,fcvmutf,t3_eizvk5,1578005506.0,"Get yourself a new job, my friend. Sounds like essentially ANYTHING is better than no benefits/vacation. Most places give you SOMETHING."

This is the most difficult yet most responsible thing a person can do. Knowing when to give up on someone is very important."
DetroitRedWings,fcra1bp,t3_ehqulf,1577898952.0,I felt the kid had a very nice personality when we drafted him. I can totally see him being a calming presence in a locker room. I'm so glad we drafted this kid.
TheSimpsons,fcoxbsw,t1_fcon740,1577844152.0,A joke that definitely gets you good when you are an adult.
hockey,fcobq8q,t1_fcoaq19,1577828349.0,"Most chirps around here are stupid, smart guy."
hockey,fcnxx6x,t1_fcnvt99,1577820596.0,It was all in good fun. But I guess you can’t chirp back without getting downvoted into oblivion. I rooted for the Blues last season for fuck sake lol.
hockey,fcnly0f,t1_fcnibdz,1577814019.0,"This year was the first time people in St. Louis knew they had a hockey team.

A chirp for a chirp, I’m not being serious. Has this sub really gotten this sensitive?"

hockey,fccnag7,t3_egw8m8,1577600379.0,"I think the response was appropriate. The ones that didn't shake his hand showed the proper respect to the rest of Team Canada, who were mindful of the tradition. Hope the kid got chewed out in his own locker room for it and learns a lesson."

netflix,fc0nqza,t1_fbzly8u,1577295424.0,I feel you. Kittens and cats are the most precious things in the world to me. I don’t get why people could hurt one.
netflix,fc0nfet,t3_efbjp1,1577295203.0,"I’m on episode 3. They show more of Luka’s videos than I cared to see. Especially of the kittens, which is what really fucks me up. If you’re thinking of watching, be advised you see sweet kittens who are real trusting being gently coaxed into a vacuum bag, and you see their stiff little bodies at one point."
