I hear it's a total crapshoot sometimes. I think there's just too much demand or something so you get just any old random up there trying to counsel and some just aren't any fucking good at it. Like yo this isn't Mcdonalds you can't be a mediocre therapist, that shit kills people. What an ass."

Dancing on this line might give me a perspective that's very valuable to someone some day. 

Or I'll fucking blow my brains out, I dunno."
