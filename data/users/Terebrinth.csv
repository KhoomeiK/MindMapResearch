egg_irl,ffh9x6r,t1_ffh9d86,1579927394.0,"Without spoiling too much, the story is about time travel and alternate timelines. Ruka is a feminine guy who wants to be a girl, and is absolute goals.

It exists as a VN sort of like danganronpa if you're into that."
egg_irl,ffh9chv,t3_eti8kq,1579926878.0,"Have you seen Steins;Gate? Ruka is one of my favourite characters, and thinking back on it, an early egg moment."
ForeverAlone,ff7y2dh,t3_es4ij1,1579661086.0,"I've actually seen sort of the opposite. People here don't feel entitled to a relationship. We're just bitter we're not part of a normal world that many others are. We don't think we deserve people to fall for us.

The distinction (entitlement) is what separates FA from incel. 

>I think people allow themselves to believe that because it makes coping with being forever alone easier.

Like, you're right, but I'm beyond coping and I think others are too at this point.

>I think valuing yourself makes it easier for other people to value you. Why would someone want to invest their time in us if we do not invest our time in ourselves?

Yeah. I wouldn't date myself, so how can I expect someone else to?"
egg_irl,ff7qlxz,t3_erj322,1579655971.0,"Ack, that second panel. I had someone refer to me as female in a guild I was in, and I really struggled with correcting him, but I did because I wasn't about to lie or anything. 

I left the guild later and all I could think was ""Damn, I could have totally passed""."
socialanxiety,ff2dzzb,t3_er6lvz,1579502261.0,"The McDonalds here have self-order kiosks, which is honestly a life-saver.

I'm sick and tired of McDs but I keep preferring it over other fast food places solely because of the kiosks."
egg_irl,fel72x7,t3_eplzvg,1579215464.0,"Ha, I knew Ferdie grew out his hair for a reason."
ForeverAlone,fel6uf4,t3_epe0j8,1579215316.0,"I don't like how condemned it is. Like, I get it, humans need to reproduce to survive so it's unnatural not to be able to do so. Yet, whenever I see a guy talk about how he can't get a date, the responses say it's his fault. They always tell him to change his personality, his mindset. We've all seen the shitty advice, but I'm referring to the advice that's just straight up toxic and meant to put down the guy, to label him as an ""other"", to separate themselves from him because they absolutely do not want to be him.

And then there's the problem with women. With the MeToo thing putting so much emphasis on sexual harrassment, I can't even begin to imagine how the ignored women must feel."
socialanxiety,feezi2c,t3_eoobsc,1579044655.0,"One of my friends discovered my reddit account. He saw some of my comments and was like ""Wow, you're more cheery online"" and I just wanted to die."
egg_irl,fecwn5p,t3_eogpj3,1578987572.0,"I also have the thing where I don't really hate my body or self. Okay, I wish I was thinner and I had better hair, but I don't hate the fact that I'm male, I'd just much rather be female. I guess that makes me 35% sure I'm trans according to your scale. 

But yeah, I think it's telling when you think you're cis, like actually convinced you're cis, but there's a part of you that wishes it weren't true. I get that sometimes.

Piccrew is like TvTropes or something. When I discovered it I spent like 20 minutes before closing it because I knew I'd get sucked in and, like you, create a perfect picture I'd only feel envy about. Feel free to add me on Discord if you want, although I haven't cracked yet."
socialanxiety,fdsrqgx,t3_emvoyh,1578707090.0,"I didn't know proper bar etiquette either (actually I still probably don't) so I was so afraid of going to the bar that I didn't go alone until after I went with someone else first. People go to the bar by themselves all the time, and I think the ""pathetic guy drinking alone"" is just a myth/narrative that the media tries to push. I've seen a lot of people drinking by themselves and none of them have struck me as pathetic. Most people at the bar by themselves just stay on their phone and that's perfectly fine. 

You basically just walk in and take a seat at the bar, you don't have to wait for someone to direct you to a seat or anything. Some bars have like an ""orders"" section where people walk up and order drinks, and pay for them right away so there's no tab. They can then take the drink back to their table or whatever. It's also where waiters/waitresses grab drink orders for the tables. Just be wary where this is and don't take a seat there blocking it, although there really shouldn't be seats there in the first place.

Anyway, once you're seated, the bartender will drop by once they're free, ask how's it going, or what they can get you started with. If you know what you want you can just say it here, otherwise you can ask for a drink menu. You can ask for the food menu as well, if the bartender doesn't ask if you're looking for food. You make your order like you would anywhere else, and the bartender will bring it to you. You can spend an hour sipping a beer and nobody's going to care, so don't feel rushed. 

They're usually smart enough to notice when you're finished your drink and will ask if you want another one. I find myself having the most trouble flagging them down for additional things like water or the bill."
CasualConversation,fdohnd2,t3_eme00g,1578605335.0,"Hey, 26 is still young. I know it's really easy to compare yourself to others, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't do it, but there's really no need to. Life really isn't some sort of competitive race, so don't think of things like ""stock value"". I have this one friend who constantly cares about his status and appearance, and all I can think about is how exhausting his lifestyle must be, to always put on a fake show, to always try to one-up other people, to always appear invulnerable. 

Basically, comparing yourself to others just makes you feel bad. You're trying to figure out what makes you happy, and others are not on that same path."
CasualConversation,fbx69kk,t3_eesmh3,1577171174.0,"Nah, you're not being a grinch. Or maybe you're being a grinch and I'm also being a grinch, idk. 

I agree though, the thing with celebration posts is that it rarely invites discussions. Like, I'm happy that the OP is doing well, but I just can't relate to their life, so there's nothing for me to bring to the table. There's also not much else for the OP to bring to the table because it's just a celebration post. 

Like, it's important to remember conversations are a two-way street. ""Look at this thing that happened specifically to me"" aren't good ways to do that. I remember a time where I could scroll through this sub and want to engage in multiple threads but now it feels like I can't respond to a lot of things because there's not a lot to respond to."
