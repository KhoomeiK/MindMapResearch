LifeProTips,ff9hrjl,t1_ff8qi81,1579713288.0,"It's something that's happened a lot recently. Like the past 8 years. It's obviously an age based habit too, between 18 and 30ish. In that age range I'd say about 3/4's of them looked at their phones during an interview and the others kept their phones out. More than half aren't dressed properly, ie., wearing sports jerseys, tennis shoes, basketball shorts, etc. We're not a club at happy hour. Either way the meeting won't last more than a few minutes. If you're preoccupied during an interview it's pretty obvious you're not going to put much effort into the position. The one thing that does look good with a phone is using it to fill out an application then putting it away afterwards. Our company issues iPhones. Proving you can use a device responsibly is a plus. We do watch you when you come in. Then there's the older applicants, 35 and up. They come in dressed nice even for field work positions. They have great manners (most of them). If they have phones it's rare we see them out the entire time. Seeing how we issue company phones I have to ask if they're familiar with them. For the most part they say yes, I leave it at that. Also we're not a TV show, don't come in talking like you're off the the set of Real Housewives or any of that garbage that passes for entertainment. That's not how the world is. I'm not HR, I only interview for the niche opportunities that come up once in a while then I refer you to HR for the in depth interview involving legal aspects."

There's no more help for them and no one in government is doing anything but trying to hide them. They cut so much budget for the under privileged and make getting help of any kind just a paperwork game with nothing to gain at the end. We've had a few that tried to get housing with us. They passed all the paperwork to move into income qualified housing which took several years to process by government agencies. If they didn't have a floor or a couch to sleep on while they wait for an answer, they had to sleep on the streets. Seniors, living on the streets. Exposed to the elements. Getting beaten and robbed because they're easy targets. Dying because they can't get medical treatment for preventable diseases. On the other side there's large corporations not paying one cent in taxes and claiming to bring jobs in to a community. Except they're minimum wage jobs no one can afford to work at unless you're a kid living at home. Or being worked to death in an Amazon warehouse.

Here's advice to keep your job as long as possible. First off remember there was a reason a position was opened, because someone else failed to perform. When you're dealing with people older than you they have more experience than you. That's in life and employment. Be friendly to them. Do not force anything new and meaningless. Don't pretend you know more than they do. Did I mention your position was open because someone else failed to perform? Don't be bossy, be respectful. Don't pretend you know everything. You don't. Make the older workers the best work friends you ever had. They will make or break you in seconds. The higher up you go in a company the easier it is to get rid of you. Your first priority is results. That's something only experience can teach you no matter how much schooling you've had. Did I mention your position was opened up because someone else failed to perform? Come down off your high horse, you're no more human than anyone else. And that 25% seems like an outrageously high bump in pay."
