TalesFromThePharmacy,ffnswf4,t1_ffnetu2,1580070356.0,Yes.
Kentucky,ffnsusi,t1_ffn9qyg,1580070338.0,"Ehhh, yes and no. Typically, the county fiscal court funds the county jail. No one says how well they fund the jail, just that they do. That usually means, “we pay salaries, find how you’re going to run your jail on a shoestring budget.”

Keep in mind, too, on the county level, particularly in rural counties, deputy jailers are not paid that well. And that is another big sticking point.

So, you and I pay county taxes, and they don’t really fund the county jail at any meaningful level. A lot of county jails take state and federal inmates, because they bring in a higher per diem. Not to mention, they apply for grants, take on programs, and do other things to make funding stretch farther.

However, even knowing this, and that many county jails are overcrowded and underfunded? That’s still not an excuse not to follow the law. The law says that if an inmate is found not guilty, you return the inmate’s jail fees. Inmates are typically poor and uneducated, looking at pretty much every crime stat ever, and they’re the most likely to get screwed over by the system. Add systemic racism in, and it gets worse.

Inmates should not have to sue to make jails follow the law."
Kentucky,ffn86nv,t3_euabjy,1580063012.0,"I’m of two minds.

One, the jail does have to feed, house, and clothe them, and provide medical care. That costs money, and is ultimately the responsibility of the inmate to provide.

On the other hand, I do think jail fees should at least be partially reimbursed should someone be found not guilty and released. And keeping someone’s SSI is just gross."

Never in a million years would he pinch me like that. I would automatically deck him. It’s instinct for me after my first, abusive, marriage.

Get out while he’s just a boyfriend, and it’s just pinching. Do it before it gets worse. See if you can’t use your number and make it a Google Voice number, and change your real number. That way, if he starts calling and texting threats when you dump him, you have a trail.

JUSTNOMIL,ffhfw7r,t1_fffwqad,1579933524.0,"Yikes.

We took our daughter’s door off when she was in, I want to say, middle school, and in the throes of early adolescence, and kept slamming the door, and cracked the door frame.

So, we took the door off, as we had promised we would if she kept it up and damaged the damn door frame, and made her help do the repair work, and re-hang her door. We left it off for maybe a day or two, because we had to have time to do it, but? She also had her own bathroom, with a door, that locked. 

I hate reading these stories. These always seem like a power play to exert control, when what we did was enact a natural consequence. You break the door frame, the door comes off until it’s fixed, and if you fucking slam it again because you’re pissy about something?

Kentucky,fdx4jno,t1_fdw8bag,1578765265.0,"Unfortunately, we don’t have universal single payer health care. It would make my job easier.

And emergency services would be fully funded, instead of having to rely on the whims of the taxpayer. So, “I pay taxes,” doesn’t mean shit to mean. If you as a population decide to stop funding your ambulance company? It’s going to cost you MORE. Because there is no tax base support for emergency service.

Plus? People abuse the system. Don’t call an ambulance because you don’t want to wait at the ER. Don’t call an ambulance because you have a cold. Don’t call an ambulance because of something someone can drive your lazy ass to urgent care for. Chest pain? Call an ambulance. Giving birth? CALL AN AMBULANCE NOW. Massive trauma? CALL AND GO TO THE GOD DAMNED HOSPITAL.

Getting huffy with people who work billing because your insurance won’t pay for a treat no transport? Doesn’t win you favors. If it wasn’t serious enough you felt you needed to go to the hospital, you maybe should have sucked it up and gone to urgent care. The ambulance is not a free mobile emergency room in this country."

But there’s also bad cops on a power trip, and they all cover for each other, on what seems like every level. KSP won’t do shit to investigate bad cops at a local level, unless the public outcry makes them look bad.

So, the good cops don’t mean shit, because they won’t police their own. And the bad ones are often the ones in power."
Kentucky,fdvkey2,t1_fdvgluc,1578748372.0,"I hate getting calls at my job from people from Oldham County. “Why do I have to pay for this service, that’s what I pay taxes for!”

There’s one missing woman tied to The Company, which is The Bluegrass Conspiracy.

And, there have been other murders in Central and Western Kentucky that remain unsolved that have nothing at all to do with the Cornbread Mafia (the most boring book I have ever read). Heather Teague is still unsolved. It’s been 24 years. KSP still says Marty Dill dragged her off and killed her, but really, that’s bullshit.

It would almost be easier if they were all done by the Cornbread Mafia.

It’s disturbing how many unsolved murders there are in the Commonwealth. And how many missing persons cases there are."

She just doesn’t feel like having their shit turned on HER. She thinks she’s exempt.

Tell her that you are under no obligation to normalize child abuse for your idiot brother and his wife, or to allow them to beat and scream at your kids. And it’s the other way around - her kids should be wondering why their parents are so awful they would rather scream and hit than actually deal with them."
