I think this is the first thing that needs fixed. He doesn't know how to take care of the baby because he has no experience because he was away for 30 days at a time while the baby was little. Support him but don't intervene. Point out to him that if he wants to stay home with the baby that means he has to be able to take care of the baby for a full day alone. Remind him that you weren't born with knowledge on how to parent, you learned with practice and time and he can too. Maybe get him the book What to Expect in the First Year. It covers all the basics without being preachy. 

You look for a job while he takes care of the baby. You can pump breastmilk while doing that so that he is responsible for feeding baby too. Or you can start mixing in formula. Make sure that he understands that while your looking for a job, you need to be focused on that so you can't be taking the baby at the same time.

AskWomen,fffahsq,t1_ffer7d8,1579879664.0,"If you needed this advice years ago and are currently strapped with credit card debt, consolidate that debt into a personal loan. Even if the rate isn't better or your monthly payment stays the same, structured debt reflects better on your credit report than revolving debt. Pay your personal loan on time for 6 months or so and then refinance again. By then you will probably qualify for better rates because your credit score will have gone up.

Of course, the key here is to not continue to put more onto your credit cards. Get your budget under control first."

centrist,ffa3doz,t3_esh28h,1579727081.0,"There are a few arguments that come up:
1. Most of the middle and upper class people like their current health insurance policy and don't want their coverage to change. Some employees and unions have accepted lower pay in exchange for better health insurance and taking that away would significantly impact their total compensation package.
2. Many people are concerned about control of their own care and wait times to see a doctor. For example, in England the NHS decides if you can see a specialist. In America, you can decide to see a specialist if you want to. Some insurance companies require a referral, but most primary doctors will give you a referral if you push for one. The US also tends to have shorter wait times, especially for specialists. People in other countries sometimes have to wait months to get in. Most people in the US do not.
3. There are concerns that with less incentive to make money, there will be less research and development to continue to improve treatments and medications. I've seen compelling arguments against this, but it's really hard to predict what a single prayer system would do to R&D
4. The Healthcare industry is something like 15% of our economy, so any big change is going to have a significant impact on the economy overall. Also, while streamlining the system would be more efficient and cost effective, it achieves that by eliminating jobs, which means a lot of people would suddenly be unemployed"
