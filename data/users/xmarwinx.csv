science,fffsj0u,t1_ffex6kg,1579890853.0,Both are real since they are the same. This philosophical problem is dumb. It just comes from religion and a believe in a soul and that humans are special.

This information is so easy to access in our time.

There is no proof that your religion has it right. As shown by you dodging my question twice.

I can really recommend ""A Brief History of Time"" by Stephen Hawking. It's well written and very easy to understand. It explains how early scientists got to the theories that we all work with today. I think it will really help you understand the difference between believe based on faith and believe based on evidence much better than I can.

""Brief Answers to the Big Questions"" might be really good too and directly talks about God, I haven't read it tho."
