AskReddit,ff8kpbc,t1_ff6fv21,1579683134.0,"My cousins and I used to do bike races together. The problem was that one time I got stuck with the small bike you could never win with. Naturally I tried taking a shortcut to win anyways.

It would have worked, but my foot slipped from the pedals and jammed itself into the bike's spokes. Front wheel locks up and I go straight over the handlebars. The bike follows, because my foot is still stuck inside the front wheel, and lands on me while I skid.

Because of the fact that I took a shortcut, it took my cousins some time to find me as I was trying to drag my mangled body and bike back to the finish line."

Ammo makes a big difference too. I used to shoot Federal bulk packs that came in white boxes of 525 with a bullseye on the side.

They'll knock excess carbon out by running a dry snake through the bore, and they'll clean the chamber and action out, but the bore will never see a solvent once before the barrel is shot out. It's because once you clean it you have to build back up to a copper equilibrium again for consistent accuracy.

Basically clean it whenever you see an issue (accuracy or POI change, malfunctions, etc.) if you can afford for minor issues to happen, and otherwise clean every 300-1000 rounds or so.

There was a 10 minute gap to these same support vehicles at the start of the race that she erased by being faster than them. The support vehicles follow behind the slowest men and match pace. The slowest men cycle faster on average over the entire race than the fastest women. 

Therefore she was traveling faster than the slowest men, by quite a lot to close a 10 minute gap in 35km, a pace that not even the fastest women can maintain for the duration of an entire race.

If she traveled at the pace that even the fastest women racers can sustain for an entire race, she would not have caught up to the support vehicles because they were traveling at the pace of the men's race, which is faster than that of the women's race."

You're wrong, entirely, and you're confusing the speed of a single cyclist on a suicide break with the average speeds the best and worst cyclists are capable of maintaining for an entire race. 

During a suicide break a single woman or a small group can catch up to the slowest men. It's called a suicide break because they use up so much energy doing it that they can't win the race in the end. They're expending far more than the average energy expended by the most elite racer, meaning by the end of the race they will need to slow down because they can't sustain that pace.

That's exactly what happened here. After the break (which helped her more than anything by allowing her to recover somewhat from her early push) she regained her 2+ minute lead. Then she faded later in the race because her initial pace was literally impossible to sustain. It was like running the first lap of a 1 mile race in record 400m time - you can't keep that pace up and you will lose because you burned your energy too quickly at the start."

todayilearned,ff3zg7k,t1_ff3r174,1579552221.0,"The ironic thing is that for Formula 1 the thing that makes drafting work in other forms of auto racing (less air resistance because the air is turbulent) actually makes the trailing F1 car substantially slower overall. The turbulent and less resistive air helps on the straights yes, but turbulent air reduces aerodynamic efficiency with current cars by over 50%. This means less downforce, which means slower cornering speeds, which in the end makes a bigger difference than the advantage on the straights.

Because of this F1 has DRS, or a drag reduction system, where you basically get to remove the drag from the giant rear wing on the long straights if you're closely following another car. Even with this system, it's ***barely*** enough to make up for the loss of aerodynamic efficiency in the corners."

GunAccessoriesForSale,feu6htw,t1_fetc4om,1579383582.0,"Colorado's magazine ban was recently challenged again in the state's supreme court and this was one of the big arguments made by the plaintiffs. 

Magazine changes take less than two seconds to complete for someone with even a small amount of practice, and less than a second if someone has more practice. Someone committing a mass shooting isn't going to be hindered by magazine changes because it's so quick as to not interrupt them at all really.

On the other hand, magazine changes are difficult to organize and complete in a self-defense scenario. If you're at home you aren't carrying spare magazines in a convenient location for fast reloads like a mass shooter would. You've got adrenaline pumping because you're literally fighting for your life, and you're stuck trying to remember where your spare magazine is located. You're trying to dig it out of a drawer or a safe with fumbling hands while your life is still in immediate danger. 

The entire time you're trying to do this, the intruder/intruders is/are still trying to kill you because your first magazine didn't have enough rounds to stop the threat. Maybe you missed because it was dark or because they were moving. Maybe you missed because you're literally shitting your pants in fear for your life. Maybe you didn't miss, but you didn't hit the threat in an area that immediately incapacitates you. None of the reasons why matter, the only thing that matters is your magazine is empty and the threat is still actively trying to kill you.

Police officers have an 18% chance of hitting their target in a gun fight, and the average person won't fare any better. You might hit with 1-2 bullets from a 10 round magazine. This could be enough to stop a single threat to your life, but if there are two or more threats you might only hit one of them with your 10 round magazine. Even with a single threat, being hit with 1-2 bullets does not guarantee immediate incapacitation.

All of that potential risk to your life caused by only having 10 rounds in the magazine is unnecessary. Having only 10 rounds in a magazine doesn't affect the prepared criminal. It does, however, massively endanger law-abiding citizens who have to defend their lives and can't prepare in the same way."
legaladvice,feu1l4n,t1_fero1yl,1579382178.0,">There probably isn’t any middle ground here.

The only possible middle ground would be finding the daughter and vehicle, returning the vehicle to the dealership, and working out an agreement with the dealership to cover any difference in vehicle value for mileage and wear/damage the daughter might have added to the vehicle. The dealership would likely be motivated to make this deal, because they were complicit in the fraudulent car loan by not getting approval from the mom originally before issuing a loan in her name.

Since it sounds like there's a good relationship with the dealership, this could be a good option if the daughter and vehicle are found. u/sweetwine888 the mom's top priority right now should be finding the daughter and the car if the mom doesn't want her daughter to be criminally charged. A deal like this would be basically the only option with minimal cost to the mom and no legal repercussions for the daughter.

Ultimately the daughter stole her mother's identity here, and the dealership participated in the fraud without getting agreement from all parties involved. The mom doesn't have to pay the fraudulent debt, but to avoid paying it she does have to report the crimes and allow the legal system to intervene (i.e. laying charges against the daughter, and likely also the dealership). 

The mom can pay the debt, report the crimes, or find the daughter and attempt to work something out with the dealership."
MaliciousCompliance,fetyq5u,t1_fermd5q,1579381397.0,"I know it's popular to say that retail work is hell, and I can understand why people might dislike it, but the whole thing is sometimes overblown in my opinion.

I worked retail at a golf course for two years of college and at a gun store for two more years of college. Both of them had slow periods and busy periods. Slow periods were nice because I got paid to just hang around in the store/clubhouse and do pretty much whatever I wanted, so long as everything that needed done for the day was sorted. I could read, play games on a phone or computer, do homework, so long as it wasn't while customers were in and it wasn't getting in the way of required duties. Busy periods were also nice because they made time pass quickly - golf and shooting are hobbies of mine so it was fun to answer questions and talk about equipment with customers. Cash registers, to me, have always been kind of fun to operate and at the golf course I got to put on a fun impression of an ""announcer's voice"" to call groups to the first tee.

Basically if it was busy I always had something to do that wasn't difficult/backbreaking and time went quickly. If it was slow I got to do whatever I wanted and get paid for it so long as I kept up with basic things like vacuuming.

Ultimately whether or not retail work sucks is a matter of your boss. Everything I mentioned liking happened because I had good bosses at both places. The same can be said for any job in any industry, however, because good bosses make good jobs and bad bosses make for horrible jobs."

Your statement is blatantly false. Some choice quotes from Joe Biden's own website:

>**Buy back the assault weapons and high-capacity magazines already in our communities.** Biden will also institute a program to buy back weapons of war currently on our streets. This will give individuals who now possess assault weapons or high-capacity magazines two options: sell the weapons to the government, or register them under the National Firearms Act.

Biden is literally saying the most popular rifle in the United States will either be ""bought back"" by the government (confiscation with compensation, the government cannot buy back something they never owned) ***OR*** the owners will have to pay a $200 tax stamp plus go through a years long waiting process to keep their legally owned firearms.

You are literally fucking insane if you think that isn't confiscation, especially with the number of people who cannot afford a $200 tax stamp for their gun. The gun that is protected, mind you, by a supreme court decision which stated guns in common use may not be banned.

>**Create an effective program to ensure individuals who become prohibited from possessing firearms relinquish their weapons.**

This is a direct confiscation program, though not a bad one considering it targets those who are felons and the like.

>**Incentivize state “extreme risk” laws**

""Extreme risk"" laws, or red flag laws, are confiscation of firearms from people who have not been found guilty by a jury of their peers. He is encouraging confiscation in violation of the sixth amendment rights of every American.

>**Put America on the path to ensuring that 100% of firearms sold in America are smart guns**

""Smart gun"" technology does not exist in any acceptable or reliable form. It must be reliable not 99.999% of the time, but 100% of the time. This technology does not exist, yet Biden wants to mandate it - a de-facto ban on the sale of firearms. There are more than 2,000,000 defensive uses of a firearm each year in the U.S., and if a ""smart gun"" fails only 0.01% of the time that means that the gun will not work in 200 of those cases. That is 200 lives lost directly to a stupid law, more than the number lost annually to mass shootings in the first place.

&#x200B;

From Yang's website:

> Create a clear definition of “assault weapon”, and prevent their manufacture and sale 

More unconstitutional law aimed at AR-15's, which again are explicitly protected by the Supreme court decision from Heller v District of Columbia.

> Pass a federal gun transportation law that will require people to transport guns unloaded and locked in a storage safe 

Unconstitutional restriction of the right to ***bear*** arms. Citizens have the right to carry or transport their firearms without undue restriction. Beyond that, it's just stupid in general considering transporting guns to and from the firing range has resulted in 0 deaths from them being loaded or left unloaded in an unlocked case."

You really don't understand how elections work, do you?

At the state level, presidential elections are a popular vote. Whoever wins the popular vote gets the electoral votes for the state.

All of the states I mentioned are ***strongly*** biased towards Republicans in their popular votes. You have to convince a majority of people to vote for you, not ""a couple of idiots"" like you think.

Oh come on now, don't be so blatantly dishonest. Lying like this does you no favors and only makes you look unintelligent and uninformed.
