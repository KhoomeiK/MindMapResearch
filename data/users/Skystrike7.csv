It is not a rigorously academic endeavor, to become a policeman. But it requires a lot of 1) protocol ingraining 2)knowledge of the law 3) physical ability, reflexes, and response. Bonus: 4) tactical interaction with people, suspect or not. Saying cops need ""more training"" without specifying what training, exactly, is nonconstructive. Gun discipline? Well, they already are trained in that. MORE gun discipline? I'll leave it up to you to decide if it's really going to be beneficial to add more hours of case studies of violent encounters is going to help their split-second decision making.     

A few bad cops definitely do not spoil the whole bunch. They do, however, spoil the reputation when the only notable stories you read about cops are those negative events. Most serviceman do their jobs adequately, if not admirably, and they do not deserve any of the vitriol directed their way by sectors of the public that think all police are trigger happy,  out-to-get-you power abusers."
