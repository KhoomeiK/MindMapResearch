If you open up a message (and thus remove the notification), answer it. If you don't have time to answer someone or don't want to, don't even open the message.

This is similar to setting time aside as the other person recommended. It depends how much work this is. I usually only have one or two people, so it just takes me a few minutes before bed. If this is legit work though, maybe you do need to set aside time.

The biggest thing to me is that it's like dishes. It doesn't feel like work to wash a pan or two after a meal. But if you let dishes pile up for a week, suddenly it's a big task to wash a sink full of dishes. If you do this every day, messages don't pile up, and it doesn't seem like such a big task."

Can't treat patients but you can get supplies, wipe down tables, etc. This will make you feel less like an intruder and will also help you figure out the day to day routines of the job.

Also, ask TONS of questions. I asked a lot about, ""Why are you pulling on their leg? Why are you doing squats?""  Honestly, you don't really need to ask those kinds of things unless you're just curious.

Instead, I would focus my questions on, ""Why did you choose PT instead of other healthcare fields? What are your favorite and least favorite parts of the job? What surprised you about the job when you got into the field?

You'll figure out all the science behind the job when you're in school, and honestly, you probably already know enough about the science to know whether or not it's interesting to you. The part you don't know is what the job itself is like and what it's like as an adult person to work in this professional field. That's what I would focus my questions on.

One more thing - look at how the PT spends their time. How much time seeing patients? How much time cleaning up? Documentation? Do they have breaks? Are they balancing multiple patients at once? Are they talking with their coworkers? These things will vary from clinic to clinic, but it gives you an idea of what the work environment might be like."

physicaltherapy,ff53gm0,t1_ff40tka,1579579187.0,"It has some value, just not enough. The benefits to a practicing PT on a micro level aren't worth the cost. Most PTs (including myself) don't see the value in paying for something that doesn't individually help me. They're theoretically gonna do the same things whether I pay up or not. But if everyone thinks that, then they can't do what they are doing now. And we don't need to because, like you said, students are footing the bill. I agree that it isn't right, but it's the truth.

I agree that doctors are already referring us out. But the APTA is enhancing the profession by giving us things like CPGs, organizing CEU events and social events, and publications about the profession. It helps people to improve the way they practice. Most people don't take advantage of these things, but when you're looking to argue for things like direct access, it looks a whole lot better when you have stuff like that looking legit. It keeps us afloat in the sense that it helps keep people together, and give a set of standards to prevent people from being total quacks who don't know what they're doing.

And I agree, it makes more sense in the pre-internet age. Nowadays, I can find a ton of resources online that are equally helpful and don't come with membership fees.

To be clear, I also don't like that students are forced to pay for the APTA membership. I just see the situation differently than I think you do, and I wanted to provide a perspective. I appreciate the passion and the discussion!"

I honestly don't know how responsibly the APTA spends their money. Is there somewhere that is broken down? It wouldn't surprise me if they don't spend much on politics, but I honestly don't know.

I get why you are attacking the school as they're the ones that do it. I guess my point is that they don't really lose anything by discontinuing the process. The real loss is by the APTA, so however that makes you feel, it's the reality.

I agree that free market will do what it does if this were to happen, and maybe that's a good thing long term. But I think the APTA gives us an outward sense of legitimacy and authority in the public, whether it's warranted or not.  And as a PT, my well being is partially dependent on this organization whether I like them or not.

Think of the APTA as a boat. Maybe it's rusty and dirty and falling apart and its just barely keeping us afloat. As shitty as it is, I don't want it to sink until the rescue boat arrives. Otherwise we are all floating out at sea by ourselves.  I don't want to let this organization die until we have a better one that can take over."
baseball,ff3q016,t3_erhg9r,1579546363.0,The fuck did we ever do to Gammons to make him Coors all over himself?
physicaltherapy,ff3kzyq,t1_ff3hkvb,1579543285.0,"I agree that it seems unfair to force APTA membership onto students without even really telling them, or calling it a ""free perk"" when its obviously built into tuition. I also think it's absurd that there is this culture where it is a ""professional responsibility"" to promote APTA membership to peers. Finally, I don't think that the cost of APTA membership balances out the benefits of being in the APTA.

That being said, I personally don't have strong enough feelings to warrant a lawsuit or an attack on the organization. I think the APTA and academic faculty have the right intentions, and intend to build enthusiasm for the profession through this attachment.  I think it is important to have some kind of professional organization to bring together PTs to share ideas and build community. It's also a key way to have organized advocacy for the profession on a political level with lobbying, and to provide a backbone for quality of care. So rather than shut down this practice (and in essence, the APTA as a whole) I recommend we either find ways to make membership better worth the money, or design a different organization that is less dependent on student revenue. Students don't value the APTA because they aren't practicing. They get everything they need from the program. The organization should be designed to help practicing PTs and operate financially indepenent of academia. 

There are benefits of having a PT organization. The problem is that the costs outweigh the benefits, so we've essentially relied on forced donations to stay afloat. You can work to end this practice, which would kill the APTA, and start us back at square one. I'd rather figure out a way to make the benefits outweigh the costs. I don't think we can do that for students, but if we can do that for PTs, we can end this practice by increasing PT membership and decreasing the reliance on students.

This can be done either through the APTA or through the creation of a new organization. But I don't think the current practice should end until we have a healthier organization in place. 

I think lawsuits would create this downfall too quickly since the schools have no direct benefit to this. They will quickly stop doing this. Which will quickly end funding to the APTA, which will quickly end it, leaving us without political power, professional oversight, and a sense of community. We need these things as a profession. We just need to figure out how to have them without using students to foot the bill.

How to actually do that is beyond my pay grade. I don't know. But I don't think suing schools is the way to do it. Maybe it would force change in the APTA, but maybe it would just kill the APTA. I don't think it's worth the risk."

If you can keep up at that level for a while, I don't see an issue. The problem is that it's typically more beneficial to run for, say, 30 minutes at 85% max than to run for 2 minutes at 100% max."
