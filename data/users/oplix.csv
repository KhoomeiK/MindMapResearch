conspiracy,ffgroyi,t1_ffgriyg,1579913342.0,I feel like you are having a really difficult time piecing together something that's very simple. Like as if the only place an outbreak could be found would be at the exact ground zero.
conspiracy,ffgrkir,t3_etjbg8,1579913253.0,I made almost exact same thread on Underground MMA forums several weeks ago. He is a compromised shill at this point and nothing he says should be taken seriously anymore.

FortNiteBR,fdobafg,t1_fcms0q1,1578602083.0,Agreed. Or why it suddenly became an issue on mobile is bizarre.
FortNiteBR,fcm9uwf,t3_ehuwqw,1577768176.0,"UPDATE: Ok guys, so the one thing that really helped with this issue is setting Anti Aliasing to High. At None this issue would be the worst. Low is what the screenshots were taken with. Medium still has the issue like Low. High and Ultra seem to fix it for the most part. You might notice it very slightly but it's not visible during a match."
FortNiteBR,fcm9381,t1_fcm7c71,1577767538.0,Hm. I mean I'll try something else it just seems strange to me that this issue is now on mobile too.
FortNiteBR,fcm91yt,t1_fcltaqb,1577767510.0,That's a cool idea. I really want to use these items too but I won't until I fix this
FortNiteBR,fcm9056,t1_fclwv4c,1577767468.0,It just seems redundant to me that it would be graphic settings related. Like why would that texture look like that even on low settings? Why wouldn't they just make it slightly different so it didn't have the problem to begin with?
FortNiteBR,fcm8xxq,t1_fclzoms,1577767419.0,"Hmm, I'll try it but I think I already tried that before."

FortNiteBR,fclp05l,t3_ehpdpr,1577752975.0,I'm curious if it's possible to tunnel using this type of roof edit. Meaning not that if you can technically do it but if you can do it fast enough to make the tunneling effective.
