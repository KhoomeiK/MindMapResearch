Botchedsurgeries,ff3ps4o,t3_erehjl,1579546229.0,When I see boobs that round I just wanna punch ‘em.
exjw,felqpc2,t3_epszcy,1579228612.0,"Monday nights were book study, Wednesday nights were ministry school/service meeting. Saturday morning field service, Saturday night study for Sunday (which always took forever because of my little brother), then Sunday morning meeting. When I stopped going to meetings, I couldn’t believe how much free time I had!!"

whatsthisplant,feiefkt,t3_ep8k79,1579136594.0,I have one of these! Put it in a pot where you can see the interesting round bases and purple stems!
bipolar,fei33px,t1_fei2mek,1579129214.0,"It can be discouraging, but by doing everything you can on your end, you give yourself back some power and control, which can do a lot for your state of mind. They’re making progress every day with new medications and pot strains to see if certain CBD oils can help. It’s ok to get discouraged, but don’t let it keep you down!"
bipolar,fei2fen,t3_ep7rx0,1579128799.0,"My step son deals with this. Took 3 times to get the right meds and dosages figured out, then after 10 months or so, they don’t seem to be doing much. Gotta see the doctor again. Make sure you’re being forthcoming with your therapist, lots of times you won’t realize your thoughts are causing problems. Read up on what you can do to monitor your cycles - like keeping a daily calendar. There’s a great packet of cards created by someone with bipolar disorder. She has books too and talks about the research she’s done on it. I found it at her site Bipolarhappens.com  
I hope that helps"
MomForAMinute,fehmcid,t3_ep4g7c,1579119461.0,"Hey kiddo. We’re not too far apart in age, but it Sounds like we have a lot in common. I can easily get down on myself and get into negative spiral thinking. I find that often I have to say something out loud and change my body position. Example: I’ll say ‘stop’ or what are you doing?’ Then push away from my desk or get up. It’s important to talk to yourself and ask why you’re thinking the way you are. No one else is going to do it, so take control. Small changes interrupt negative thinking and moving can keep it from happening again. It doesn’t have to be loud and the movement doesn’t have to be big. Even getting up for fresh water or walking to a window can help. Fake a good mood with friends or co-workers. It’s works to trick yourself - more often than not. I hope this helps a little. We’re all out there fighting our own battles. Hugs.

Edit: fixed a word"
exjw,fehktva,t3_ep5mxl,1579118581.0,"Oh god. This is my younger brother. He’s still PIMI, divorced, mid 30’s, has a kid and can’t find a new girlfriend. I keep telling him to look outside JW’s or he will never meet someone, especially due to the area he lives, but he also has the issues just mentioned. He’s been stunted by my mom and the Borg. I’m so sad for him. Great guy, very handy, but no schooling and used to being bailed out financially by my parents."
bipolar,fefg5bs,t3_eou9vz,1579055620.0,"I’m jealous. I have issues understanding how to do stuff like crochet - it took DAYS where I spent 5 hours or more practicing to do the most basic knitting technique before I could grasp it. Even now I struggle with learning to do a new technique- I just don’t get it. You might not feel you can do other art projects, but this is a cool one, IMO. Carry on!"
bipolar,fedadv3,t3_eofu2b,1579005586.0,Beautiful color balance. Well done!
relationship_advice,fdny15n,t3_em99hd,1578595158.0,"I don’t have a lot to go on here for past history, but heating up leftovers is something my husband does ALL the time. Birthdays he’ll either cook me a great meal, or take me out. Love is a funny thing. We stick with people because we still care and have invested a lot of time, so it’s hard to just quit. Especially if you’re not the type to quit. This life doesn’t just affect you, it affects your children, who will become members of society some day, so how will living with a father like this mold them? Hard questions with hard answers, but still better than regrets. It may be time to evaluate a separation. Speaking from experience here on the regret."

exjw,fdlgoz3,t3_elqkyd,1578523634.0,"So I’m gonna give you some things to think about to make you feel a little bit better, hopefully. Number one, she couldn’t been perfect for you because she found someone else therefore that means that it was never meant to be. (That sounds so harsh, but I really don’t mean it to be). Which means you might find someone even better in the long run. And then lastly, you still could have some growing to do and maybe you can be a better person for the next one that you meet. There’s a lot of undoing to be done after you leave the Jehovah’s Witnesses. Take some time to get a cleaner viewpoint on your new belief system and take time to let a few things go you’ve been putting on yourself. I know I had a lot of baggage when I left. I’m sorry your heart got broken, just don’t let it make you bitter!"
Youniqueamua,fdkh00q,t3_elt9qi,1578503683.0,Is this the same woman who did the video for other MLM people saying her kids weren’t allowed to bother her when working? Even if they were vomiting or bleeding? Or do they all look alike?
ketorecipes,fdjtg4e,t3_ell69y,1578486888.0,Thanks! I’ll head over there this weekend!
ketorecipes,fdjt6je,t3_ell69y,1578486619.0,"Ok, I’m just outside Detroit and I don’t recognize the brand of wine on your counter! What is that?? Also, good luck with Keto - my hubby and I have been doing it since September and consistently lost weight."
insanepeoplefacebook,fdef2e3,t3_ektsdl,1578337625.0,"Thank you for telling me the basics on not getting raped. Quick question, what is your recommendation on how to avoid all other areas of rape that you neglected to mention? Is there a great tip for kids to avoid it? How about spousal rape? Rape during war time by soldiers? Please respond ASAP, as you sound like an authority on the subject and I’d like to avoid a second occurrence in my life, you garbage idiot."

There are so many other guys out there who will respect you, your body and your wants. RUN."
LuLaNo,fcxtn59,t3_eja6tx,1578070237.0,"Turn it into a mini skirt and pair it with a dark blue t-shirt, I would rock that. Crazy patterns like this are only ok if used in small amounts. I would also consider making a short skirt with the bottom half as this material and the upper half a matching dark color. But I like sewing and finding ways to make clothing that looks unflattering, look good once I’m done. Although If it’s hot dogs or crap colors, I’m out."
Botchedsurgeries,fcspg10,t3_eii41a,1577921791.0,My husband grimaced and said her lips look like “a couple of sea slugs” and I fell out.
exjw,fcl0f32,t3_ehob18,1577737101.0,"You can read some other posts where people put the sort of gentle/diplomatic questions and statements to their family members still in the Borg. You can tailor them more to each person, but that’s about it. You also risk having them shut you out the moment you start asking heavy questions or saying ‘scary’ stuff."
AmItheAsshole,fckzm59,t3_ehhqv8,1577736602.0,"My son changed his last name to his step fathers last name as soon as he was 18, due to how much he hated his biological father for abuse. It’s your life. If changing a name helps you heal and start new, that’s your choice. If anyone wants to disagree, that’s their choice."
MomForAMinute,fckvzyz,t1_fckrc67,1577734391.0,"No problem. I’m no therapist, but I have a lot of experience in dealing with family and friends who have trauma or mental health issues. A lot of it is just immediately reminding yourself that what they’re saying or doing is motivated by an unwell mind or learned traits."
MomForAMinute,fckqxqe,t3_ehora9,1577731271.0,"So my daughter-in-law comes from a similar situation. First, there’s absolutely nothing wrong with cutting ties to your parents once you move out. You can’t fix mental health problems in people, it’s just easier to move on with your life. This sort of abusive parent and accepting parent relationship happens more than anyone wants to admit.
Here’s the big issue: making sure you get therapy so that you don’t perpetuate the cycle unknowingly. My step sons mom is manipulative, and although he hates it, he can be manipulative too and doesn’t even realize it. Once you get out of there, you can begin to heal."

exjw,fc0z6mb,t3_efh61y,1577303689.0,Welcome! So glad you have support! Always saddens me when I hear someone stuck and their family is still in. Merry Christmas!
exjw,fbze592,t3_efagrw,1577243698.0,"Don’t focus on the bad. It’ll only drive you crazy. You’re more free than I was at your age - I didn’t have the internet til I was 18, and it was pretty basic! If you have an idea of what you’d like to do for a career, start reading up on it now and even if it seems far away, start reading about scholarships. Writing college entrance essays. Anything you can do to prepare yourself to GET OUT. Save money like crazy. We did it, so can you!"
exjw,fbt1ynm,t3_ee8g1j,1577066159.0,"Omg!! I’ve been saying this for years! There are certain classical songs I’ll hear that will remind me of JW music! (I refuse to use their words for things, always trying to be different as much as possible)"
