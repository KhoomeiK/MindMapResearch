JustNoSO,ff8pq0r,t3_es55rk,1579690757.0,If her mental health is that bad then she should see a professional. Therapist or psychiatrist something. And if its so crippling that she is unable to work then maybe its time for her to apply for ssdi. She would need a professional diagnosis and backong for that to happen. Sorry this is happening op. I hope both of you get the help you need. Maybe at a time when you both have had the chance to cool down and not in the heat of an arguement sit and discuss these options with her. Ita not fair to bear the sole burden of running the house and her contributing in someway is not an unreasonable request for you to ask of her
