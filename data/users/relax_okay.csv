aww,ff2pfr1,t1_ff1v0ug,1579517844.0,Microsoft should totally get in on this with their Xbox. A system to allow handicapped people to play their games would be a great move for a company that has the resources to develop things like that.
GetMotivated,ff2kuiq,t1_ff1x3nk,1579510823.0,After this episode I had “Be a little better than you were yesterday” as the background on my phone. That was a really moving monologue and hit me personally.
assholetax,ff2kr9d,t1_ff2jzy5,1579510694.0,I’m really sorry for what he had to go through. The stress must have been unbearable. Make sure he has given himself time to work through it and get past his feelings about the situation. Some people move on without ever resolving their feelings and it can affect them long after the situation is over.

AskReddit,ff1kcw8,t1_ff1en2f,1579480581.0,Depends on the restaurant. I worked someplace where a waitress had a misogynistic asshole as a customer. Even slapped her ass when she walked away and hinted at wanting to have sex with her. The guys in the kitchen were pretty protective of her and did some unspeakable things to the guys’ food.
AskReddit,ff1dhr3,t3_er3d55,1579477796.0,It would allow me to move out early to a more affordable place. I struggle to pay my rent every month. I had some very last minute issues (day before moving day) moving from my last place and my only choices at the time were homelessness or living in a place I could barely afford.
AskReddit,ff1cvkw,t3_er32ic,1579477549.0,"Pushing Up Roses. I think her videos are funny and I like watching her playthroughs of old adventure games. The Organ Trail (yes, Organ, it’s with zombies) is pretty fun."
AskReddit,ff1c6ff,t3_er3p5l,1579477397.0,Intrusive Thoughts. It would be a real life simulation of how to make it through the day while horrible things run through your head. You’d have to solve puzzles so you could get back to focusing on work or being able to fall asleep.

movies,fchvwoc,t1_fcfgt23,1577654759.0,"I’m just re-reading the book series now and the books are the same way. 6 and 7 are long winded and more grounded where the ones before were magical and kept a sense of whimsy. The last two get so bogged down in the seriousness of Dumbledore’s death, the fear of Voldemort, and the search for the horcruxes, that they forget what made people fall in love with the books in the first place. It’s more about wrapping things up than it is about keeping the magic alive."

movies,fbxlrpy,t1_fbx7vqr,1577193145.0,"I always thought that role was very personal for her. It pulled something out of her that we otherwise wouldn’t have seen, so I’m not sure we will see it again. It was so incredibly painful to watch because that was one of those performances where it crosses the line from acting into reality. You can tell when people are “acting” and that was something else, like something you’re not supposed to be seeing. She deserved every bit of recognition she got from that performance."
