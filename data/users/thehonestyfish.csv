>- **Nadym, the Nenets' capital and last remaining city, is in serious danger of falling** to the travelling forces of the Metis, as they clearly want to one up Yupik in the long distance elimination challenge.  Although actually, did we establish whether they were actually at war; their units aren't damaged at all?  If not, is that damage just from planes from Prussia?  If so, fingers off the F key, Prussia have no units anywhere close.

I was really hoping we'd get a definitive answer to that Metis question this episode. 

Oh, and I'm guessing Nenets finally picked up an ideology. They were the last ones left, iirc."
