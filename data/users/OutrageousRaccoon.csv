I get that it’s super trendy to hate the Eastern suburbs. But if you ventured there, you’d be surprised to learn not everyone drives 3 Mercs and goes to Oxford."
AskMen,ff8ot8h,t1_ff57vyr,1579689417.0,"Bro, at work I've spent the last 2-3 nights combing through all these stories. And it first it was okay and made me feel kinda okay that I'm not getting dates and not mentally well enough to talk to anyone atm.

But, really. The last 1.5 days have been spent reading these horror stories, comparing them with my own, thinking there's no one out there that'll realistically care about me, it's too late and I just want to end this shit because I know if I do ever get back to this shit. This is exactly how my life is going to resume.

I'm not even a terrible looking dude, I'm quite tall and I think I have so much going on for myself besides all the trauma and shit going wrong lately. But nothing is ever enough in this ultra-narcissistic, hypergamy driven, FOMO dating era we've normalised."

It's quite literally the worst place to get to know someone, only a concert could be second. At least you can dance and enjoy the music at a concert, while grabbing a drink after, between sets etc."

Hunters are eating far more sustainable than other omnis, they're not contributing near as much to animal suffering etc etc.

That being said, I would date a girl who's family is into hunting, even a girl who doesn't mind it. But no fucking way am I dating someone with bumper stickers about hunting."

Especially hard drugs/amphetamines. Although it's likely she was banging the dude (given she had so little care to basically bail on the date for coke) it's still stupid to think that it's going to take less than 5 mins. Especially if they're friends.

Most people I know do a quick bump or two with their dealer before doing the actual sale."

todayilearned,fej9gou,t1_fej2kok,1579162737.0,"Everyone is blowing this way out of proportion...

I'm going to shed some knowledge on a situation that may pertain to the one at hand, although i'm not entirely convinced neither.

I live in a beautiful suburb I could barely afford, definitely not on my own. I also live in the most magnificent street in that suburb, my house is estimated at $4M, and it is the smallest house in the street. 4 of my neighbour's homes are valued at over $7M, despite us having the best plot/ocean view in the street.

***The twist?***

We rent.

There's 7 of us in total, we rent out this magnificent 6br home (we added a door onto one of the spare lounge rooms to make it a 7br) and we only pay about $300 each a week for our extraordinary rooms etc. For reference sake, $300 a week is about the average for a room in my city, let alone the swanky beachside suburb I live in.

At the surface, when cab/uber drivers drop me off, everyone assumes we're all loaded... no, we're a bunch of mid 20's who are renting a beautiful mansion by pure luck."

However, as i'm sure we all saw against the Knicks. We let in over 70pts in the paint against us, which is the highest amount of points scored in the paint in any NBA game this year (I believe) 

I would say the contrary, completely opposite to what you said and say it starts with our inside D. We are weak as fuck inside and Bam needs some help."

Give them a call, they might be able to help a little, they might be able to help a lot. I imagine they're set up similarly to how it is in NSW, where they'll provide you food, a safe place and somewhere to wash your clothes/stay hygienic etc.
