Dr. King's cohorts, predecessors and best friends also protested illegal immigration because Corporate America and their bought politicians were exploiting illegal immigrants to intentionally harm the American Worker.

King died in 1968.  Clarence Jones who wrote the ""I have a Dream"" speech also states that King would be against illegal immigration in his 2008 book ""What Would Martin say?"".

Jones is also very clear that even mentioning Trump and MLK in the same sentence makes him sick.

Iran is in a ""cold war"" with Saudi Arabia and Iraq is the current battleground.  Right now, it is a war for influence, alliances and control, so that in the event of a ""Hot War"", one side or the other will have the support of Iraq, which has historically been a very powerful nation.  

Recently Iraqi leaders have turned away from Iran and there have been massive protests to get Iran out of Iraq, which caused the Iraqi Prime Minister to quit.  Iran responded by sending their spy organization (Quds) to attack the US and provoke retaliation, because they cannot directly attack Iraqi nationalists.  By provoking the US into an attack, Iran will be able to appeal to Iraqi Shia Muslims (most of the country; same religion as Iran) to support them politically. 

The US and Quds have been hitting each other in a series of strikes for a few weeks.  First Quds and their local Shia militia hit an Iraqi base, killing an American.  Then the US hit that militia.  Quds next attacked the US embassy and apparently was planning further attacks.  The US assassinated the leaders of Quds and the local Shia militia he was working with.  Now Iran has promised to attack the US in some way, while simultaneously trying to garner support from Iraqis (and anyone else who will listen)."

This assassination is the retaliation Quds was trying to provoke.  It may not be when and what they were hoping for, but they are trying to sell it to the world as an outlandish and totally unprovoked attack as expected.  What is unclear is what happens next...

Americans don't want war, but we screwed up by backing the Shah 40 years ago and Iran has been provoking war ever since.  I am not sure it is in America's power to prevent open conflict.  I can say that I do not expect a nuclear attack.  Hope we are all safe..."

The US doesn't take territory, so there could easily be a land grab when this concludes and foreign powers have only to push aside weak local militias and stand up puppet leaders."
memes,fcyl0zi,t1_fcxoiun,1578081946.0,"America assassinated the Iranian Quds commander and Iraqi militia responsible for attacks on an Iraqi base and the US Embassy.  The drone strike occurred in Baghdad, Iraq.  Quds operates specifically outside Iran, so they handle Iran's support for organizations like Hezbollah and other militias in a number of countries.  There were no attacks inside Iran.  This is what I know at the moment."

memes,fcy3hib,t1_fcy0q7p,1578074274.0,"I think the airstrike was on an Iraqi militia, which was an Iranian proxy, but not (openly) Iranian soldiers.  The US citizen killed was killed by an attack conducted by that militia on an Iraqi base.  If those militia forces were openly Iranian, it would have already been an act of open war against Iraq.  Iraq also complained about the airstrike on the militia because the militia somehow rolls up into the Iraq defense forces.  It is a lot to unpack..."
memes,fcy096t,t1_fcxtz19,1578072869.0,"It was a series of attacks.  His proxy forces hit the US, the US bombed them directly.  Then his group attacked the US embassy.  Apparently there were more attacks planned, the US got wind of them and made this strike to prevent  those attacks.  So the message isn't that it was retaliatory, but preemptive."
politics,fcwtxcu,t1_fcwsxem,1578037467.0,"Iran kicked this off with an attack on an Iraqi base, which also killed Iraqi allies including an American.  The Americans (not sure with or without Iraq) then hit the militia responsible.  Then that militia hit the US embassy.  The US now hit the leadership responsible for that attack.  The chain of events seems to make sense and it seems like Iran was looking for something like this from the outset.   It is just hard to gauge their motives and what they hope to gain."
politics,fcwppf6,t1_fcwntik,1578032851.0,Don't think so.  Iran is not Saddam.  This is not Trump just doing this out of the blue.  Iran architected all of this.
politics,fcwpksb,t1_fcwntvm,1578032723.0,"Baghdad is in Iraq.  

This started with Iran and local militia that they fund and supply attacking an Iraqi base and killing several people including an American.  The US (and presumably Iraq) retaliated with an attack on the Iranian-backed Militia.  The Militia then hit the US Embassy, and this is a retaliation to that attack.  This strike hit the Iranian Quds leader and members of the militia group.  This is from reading some of the articles linked above.

Speculation is that this series of events is basically what Iran was trying to achieve in an effort to destabilize Iraq and pull people to their alliance."

Wisconsin deserved to lose, but they were so much better than Oregon that they couldn't give it away.  But still it was interesting.  There were good plays and the final drive was going to be a battle.  It was going to be settled by the players, on the field, but instead it was settled by some jackass with a whistle.  It was like the final season of GOT all over again."

CFB,fct7rss,t1_fct0wmh,1577935124.0,"Good on you being classy, but as an uninterested 3rd-party watching because nothing else was on.  Fuck them.  They did ultimately steal the game for no obvious reason.  I would actually really appreciate it if a gambling expert would explain to us all what the impact in dollars and cents was of officials deciding this game and the OSU-Clemson game.  Sure **it could be incompetence**, but this could also be ""Eight Men Out"".  Why pay players, when 1-2 officials can decide the game?"
CFB,fct78yr,t1_fct27jt,1577934721.0,"That PI call was absolutely the game decider.  It was a first down in what that late in the game would have put them into four down territory, and it was a call that didn't need to be made.  In the entire game, there were just two penalties called against a woefully outclassed Oregon team.  I don't care.  No one like Wisconsin, but we are forced to watch this crap because nothing else is on.  Football is getting unwatchable when so many dominant teams have wins stolen by referees."

reddeadredemption,fcmpf2q,t3_ehwi98,1577785673.0,"Very cool.  I should show my dad.  He grew up watching tons of westerns.  It was a massive part of their culture as kids with very few TV channels, which everyone watched.  I actually really enjoy the scenery, hunting, camping and all of the subtle parts that make the game rich.  

I used to hunt in real life and I am seriously thinking about doing deer muzzleloader season in January because of this game.  Of course the idea of packing in on horseback and doing a hunting trip out west is what I really want to do.  A buddy of mine did an elk hunt on horseback in the 90s and they had to quarter the animal and haul it out on horseback.  Not something I ever wanted to do, but now that I have pretended to do it, I would really like to see if I could in real life.  Plus the country and the horseback riding would be amazing."

I don't know about other nations, but the US accepts around a million immigrants annually and those immigrants also have higher birth rates than non-immigrants.  We need them, but without them, the US would be stagnant or declining and we would have a fraction of the population we have now.  

Anyway I would just be happy if we would get people to stop putting so much damned packaging on everything and making single-use plastic illegal.  Lets do something like that instead of being genocidal douchebags..."

We roll them out around the holidays to let them entertain, but most of the year they just hang out in our 14 bedroom guest house with personal spa, pool and jacuzzi.  If you want to see the sleigh and reindeer, they are grazing out back with Sasquatch.  Its a little too hot for the Reindeer, so we air condition the entire neighborhood year-round.  Oh I forgot, we have our own Sasquatch.  The neighbors thought they were hot shit because they got a Yeti and a T-rex, but those two just shit everywhere, so we are happy with 'quatch.  He is pretty quiet and cleans up after himself.  He also DJs when we have parties.  If you want, he would be glad to airdrop you some of his tracks..."""
