wholesomememes,ff7lvk5,t1_ff4j3pd,1579652658.0,Man. Seeing your kid be excited to see you when you get home from work. Its seriously makes me want to cry. She does this shreaking scream and just smiles so hard. Ah its incredible. Makes those sleepless nights so worth it. the parent-child bond brings such a crazy euphoric feeling.
wholesomememes,ff50f9t,t1_ff49qlr,1579576894.0,My toddler can only cuddle for like 4 minutes and only if we have something good on for her to watch. She is just too damn independent and wiggly!! I wish she would cuddle more.

daddit,ff2zic8,t3_er6fcs,1579529551.0,A fellow snoo’er!  Was the only thing that got my daughter to sleep more than 1-1.5 hrs long. Was a blessing but I always felt like it was scrambling her noggin. Really awesome tech for tough babies.
daddit,ff2za8l,t1_ff2rv91,1579529362.0,"I didnt do it untill my kid was a few months old. Even then I just did one ear because she always made noises waking me up. 

I always felt like crying that young meant they needed tending to in some way. 

If you can, Id recommend doing shifts with the baby in another room and one of you in the main bedroom. We did it for nearly 5–6 months bc our lil one would wake up every 1-1.5 hrs for the most part for so long. It was great (relatively speaking) because i would take shift till anywhere from 12-3 and then sleep till 7-8. So i always got a solid amount of uninterrupted sleep."
daddit,ff0zm5p,t3_eqvmn4,1579473788.0,"Man. My kids first 6 mo of life were utter hell. Well even the first year. But those first few months... pure torture. She was colicky so we got unlucky. She didnt sleep more than 1-1.5 hr at a time for months straight it seemed like. Bouncing on yoga ball was the only thing that stopped her from crying. 

Anyway. We tried everything under the sun to make her happy. All sorts of swings. Swaddles. You name it. She hated it all because she just preferred fast movement and nothing offered her that (for safety reasons I imagine). 

What really messed with me during the first year is how much things change. One day can suck then you get two good days and think “hey we are doing it” then back to sucking and you are like “change formula?? Etc etc..”   

Do your best and try so hard to enjoy it. I miss when she was so tiny. Shes becoming such a little person now and i want her to stay my little one forever some days (and other days i want her to grow up faster lol when she is misbehaving..)"

Just spent the last half hour triaging that.... found that deleting home-assistant\_v2.db fixes it (which it does) but still have wyze sense errors that I can't figure out, wondering if my dongle is messed up for some reason. 

My next step is a fresh install if this doesn't work.

homeassistant,fbwv7kv,t1_fbvahvb,1577160318.0,I just cant figure out the logic though. Sometimes i want the lights off. Like if i’m watching tv. Not always though.
homeassistant,fbwv4b9,t1_fbvlwox,1577160247.0,I agree. The bathroom is one place i just left alone. Maybe one day if I can afford and figure out the zwave light switches I may try it if anything for my toddler( just as a person mentioned below).
AskReddit,fbmq6i3,t1_fbluo9w,1576987500.0,"Do not use coffee grounds to exfoliate your skin unless your derm advises it. Chemical exfoliants are much better (like sal acid or glycolic acid on face) or lactic acid for keratosis pilaris. Of course only do this under MDs care. 

I see way too many people screwing their skin up with mechanical exfollients."
