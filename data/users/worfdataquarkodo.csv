blender,ffaq20x,t3_eslivl,1579741822.0,"When should I officially smooth my character? When the body is done before adding clothes? I have been adding a subdivision surface modifier to track progress then deleting it.

The edges clustered down the front middle of the torso are there actually because I was getting strange deformations and warping around the character's nose when I smoothed it, which was resolved by adding more edges, but now it has a ton of edges clustered together, and they kind of create seams or lines when I smooth the character via subdivision surface. 

Also, when I smooth my character, how can I assure a smooth polished look that doesn't look slightly low poly, or doesn't show any traces of polygons."

it looks like their van is less wide than the gap between the barriers. Idk, maybe if your job was construction or whatever you might be like way into measuring stuff, and kind of a nerd about knowing how wide things are.

I know this is reddit, and the whole thesis of reddit is ""look how stupid these dumb idiots are"" but sometimes you just have to let some dudes do their jobs and drive home between two barriers which they fit through because it occurred to them to bring a measuring tape to their construction job."

facepalm,felsvbl,t3_epsklg,1579230099.0,"Walmart uses facial recognition on EVERY customer. I used to work there. If they see you on camera stealing, they set it up to alert them every time you go back in. They let you steal several times or many until they have a record of you stealing enough that they can heavily convict you. They even have monitors in the aisles to show you, it puts a rectangle around your face to illustrate your face is being documented. The Asset Protection Manager at the store I worked at said the monitors are there to prevent people from stealing, but I think it’s because they legally have to tell you in some way or another your face is being documented."
