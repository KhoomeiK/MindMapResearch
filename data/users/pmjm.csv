Now they all arrive around Christmas and you have to vote by like January 20th or something. I'm speaking as a SAG member, not an Academy member, but the screeners are handled by the same company."
movies,ffkcisg,t1_ffjrib8,1580020525.0,"I'm a SAG member so I vote in the SAG awards, which are far less pressure than the Academies, but every year I'm overwhelmed because they send all the screeners within like two weeks of each other, than you basically have three more weeks to vote. There's literally too much to watch in that time for anybody who has any other job.

If you're an Academy member on a production at that time, there's no way you have an extra 200 hours to watch films.

I guess the argument is that you shouldn't vote at that point, because you're not really making an informed decision.

But is it fair that we can make uninformed votes for the President of the United States and not Best Picture of the Year? 

Carey's point though is a good one though. I don't know what the solution is."

AMD Support has gone so far as to say running at 80C presents no issues to the processor.
