The reliance of the United States on telecommunications technology is incredible, and if they don't have the security to keep it reliable, I could see that being a great impeding force on any campaign.

Original Constitution > Federal > State > Local

Anything not covered by Constitution defaults to federal, which then defaults to state, which then defaults to local. 

If something is illegal at the federal level but legal at the state level the federal government can prosecute you and the state cannot protect you. If something is legal federally but illegal locally, local police will arrest you for it but state and federal law enforcement won't care."
technology,ff0engy,t1_ff0d7xm,1579468179.0,"I can understand how pedophiles and predators would seek to do so, but protections have to be built into the law for situations that can occur where minors are acting in bad faith as well. Being underage doesn't make you infallible, just in most cases deserving of more leeway due to lack of proper maturity. Protections should exist for both parties in that case. If it's established that the minor did indeed carry fault as opposed to the adult in this situation, the adult should not be punished for something out of their control."

I don't give a fuck about pornstars, I care more about underage girls lying their way into bars and getting people into hot water. I understand that this situation isn't the likeliest to occur, but it is still very possible and the standard of guilt is just absolutely ridiculous on that front. If you're in an adults only place, the other person does something only adults should be able to do, initiates sexual relations, and does all of the above while underage, the person they trapped is at fault?

Anarchy exists in one place, war torn lands after governmental collapse. That is what you want. Evil, sick human being. 

Communism requires a state to implement it, so it cannot be stateless. 

A state requires a class of elected or unelected officials in order to implement policy, therefore communism cannot be classless. 

A state requires common unified currency or objects of universal value to function in trade. Communism inherently requires trade of goods and services, and therefore cannot be moneyless. Even in bartering at the interpersonal level, if you trade x goods for y services, the goods and services are defacto money in the trade. 

Stupid communists can't even understand basic economic theory yet claim they can change human existence into Utopia. Only problem is, it has always, and will always fail due to the direct incompatibility of communist ideology with how reality works.
