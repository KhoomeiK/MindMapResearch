wholesomememes,feozqy4,t1_feowg1f,1579308931.0,How?
wholesomememes,feokaee,t1_feojt8l,1579301382.0,That depends entirely where you live and the local laws.
wholesomememes,feohlu4,t1_fenurib,1579300308.0,"You're right, marriage isn't important to everyone and it's fully possible to have a long an happy relationships without ""putting a ring on it"". Idk why you're being downvoted."
CrappyDesign,femhanb,t1_feme5hz,1579255498.0,We buy it because it's largely what's offered to us and affordable
CrappyDesign,femh7tn,t1_femc3tm,1579255380.0,"I actively seek out clothing woth decent pockets. It takes ages to locate them in highstreet stores and when I buy online it's impossible to tell if the item has pockets till it arrives. Yes, some women's clothing has pockets, but not all, and those that do are often not from affordable brands."
CrappyDesign,femgt4t,t1_felteqp,1579254774.0,I bought some mens cargo pants a couple weeks ago and it's honestly a revelation
AmItheAsshole,feawpph,t1_fdxkp45,1578952968.0,"Not everyone knows their neighbours, especially if they don't live right next door. OP is definitely an asshole, but not knowing her neighbours isn't the reason."
AmItheAsshole,fdsue6z,t1_fdsty2d,1578708066.0,"OP wants to eat it. Its OP's birthday. She isn't asking a single other person to eat it. The brother can make a SMALL vegetarian lasagna for OP, along side a meat only for the guests that want it. OP asked the brother if he would make something else and he refused.

This has all been covered dude."
AmItheAsshole,fdsso1b,t1_fdss8x1,1578707432.0,"But he isn't, he's slapping some sauce on pasta fir OP and making an elaborate lasagna for everyone else. How can you not see that those thing's are not remotely the same.

She's not asking anything extra just the same standard of food as everyone else."
AmItheAsshole,fdsrpic,t1_fdsrhip,1578707080.0,If he gave a shit he'd offered to cook a dish that OP actually liked rather than insisting on making what he wants
AmItheAsshole,fdsr9ma,t1_fdsqru2,1578706914.0,"To me it comes across like the brother doesn't care about what OP wants. He only offered to cook because he wants to show off his ""special lasagna"" and doesn't give a shit that it's his siblings birthday..... that kind of is a slap in the face ."
AmItheAsshole,fdsql40,t1_fdsj9om,1578706666.0,"OP isn't asking everyone to eat vegetarian. It would have been completely fine if the brother had made a second, smaller, vegetarian lasagna for OP. Instead he offered her a bit of pasta and a basic sauce.
It's OP's birthday. The least they should expect is having a meal that's equally as nice as everyone elses."
PewdiepieSubmissions,fdrzk48,t1_fdrzc1k,1578692075.0,"No worries, this has been a surprisingly pleasant and enjoyable interaction for reddit"
PewdiepieSubmissions,fdryr2s,t1_fdry7iz,1578691773.0,"A lot of women, myself included, enjoy anal. The anal and vaginal cavities are very close, meaning insertion in either orifice will stimulate the same, or similar set of glands. Anal should not be painful if done correctly, with a partner that cares about your comfort.

As for why straight men like it, I'm not really the right person to ask as I'm not part of that group."
PewdiepieSubmissions,fdrmhzr,t1_fdrerjj,1578686616.0,"When you're attracted to someone is it only their genitalia you are attracted to? Typically the entire physique and personality pay a role in choosing a significant other. 

Straight men enjoy anal with women but you wouldn't catch them burying their dick in man ass."
HumansBeingBros,fdogf2s,t1_fdnr44z,1578604626.0,Yes! Definitely that too
HumansBeingBros,fdn7bb0,t1_fdn50yv,1578579252.0,Definitely tell the bar staff so they can at least keep an eye in him
IASIP,fdmtqr5,t1_fdmt0t0,1578565363.0,"They mean that the original post, without the always sunny part, was posted to r/polyamory. It wasn't intended as a joke in that context"
Neverbrokeabone,fdk2oxy,t1_fdiciku,1578494591.0,Not all milk is cow/animal milk
SapphoAndHerFriend,fdjhci2,t1_fdhtnsl,1578470844.0,Nope
AmItheAsshole,fddrtu8,t1_fdd1ye5,1578322327.0,Or just be single if that's what makes you happiest
SapphoAndHerFriend,fcyr28l,t1_fcy4ajy,1578085310.0,It's supposed to be infinite love but I like your interpretation
weed,fcm18ja,t1_fckrplc,1577761589.0,"Or, you ever consider that a woman may want to have sex/suck someone off and the weed they smoked together was just a bonus?"
MadeMeSmile,fc6c35z,t3_ege4il,1577477091.0,My families dog used to love opening wrapped presents! He'd undo the wrapping really gently then destroy whatever toy as inside
RPDR_UK,fc5hrx1,t1_fc4f7j5,1577457959.0,Get both of them in together to mentor the contestants in a comedy challenge!
stevenuniverse,fc18rfu,t3_efmecy,1577311502.0,That's such a cool Christmas gift! I'd love a pair of those! Tell you're cousins I think they're super talented
