cars,ffdv7uv,t1_ffci53w,1579829756.0,Bikes aren’t really emissions tested in the states. I’m sure putting the engine in a car would make the engine perform worse since it would need to run a typical cars exhaust to be able to be sold lol

I signed up for the Sat & Sun shift (6-4:30pm) since I am a full time student — 18 credits monday thru Friday with a farish commute. On the paper they gave me, the OT day is “blank”. I don’t even think I can do “OT” or an additional shift/ time with school in the way.

I was told OT was mandatory (unless nobody voluntarily took it) and given 2 days in advance but I am taking hella credits at college with a gapped schedule and far commute."
Acura,ff49pq6,t1_ff48sct,1579558607.0,"If you wanna “reflash” your ecu to stock or to see if it is stock: 

pull the ecu fuse and let it sit for like 10 minutes. Put it back in, start the car. Drive around and see if it made a difference. 

If you have a wrench on hand, you can just d/c your battery negative terminal and let it sit for 10 minutes. Reinstall the terminal and start the car. Have the radio code handy too cuz it’ll probably ask for it unless you’re is aftermarket. Drive around and see if it made a difference.

Edit: apparently I’m kinda wrong. You’ll have to get it tuned if the ecu was actually changed."

cars,ff47azv,t1_ff46e39,1579557108.0,"Yeah the way I set it up, if I’m in the rightmost lane I’m usually in the left most position, and rightmost position for the left most lane. If I’m in the middle lane I tend to just keep in either 3 if I’m moving (depending on what is going to be on my side). If I’m stopped while in an inside/ middle lane I just keep in between the center and a side position. I think I’m just worried that in traffic if I’m not centered (while in the middle lane) people will see it as an open lane to merge into because I may look one lane farther away than I am if I’m towards the sides of the lane i am currently in

I’m referring to each position like the respective 1/3 of the lane, not like rightmost being at the white line."

Going from my accord to my CBR i feel like I really had to be smart with it. Im fairly good at anticipating drivers in my accord so it kinda transferred over. I would rarely illegally lane split/ filter (because I would get hot mainly), speed so I can get away from cars lol, keep a large following distance, generally try to be staggered relative to other lanes. I do the same things in my car to be honest. My only worry on my bike is really rear end collisions, I flash my brakes while I’m sitting but that’s the most I can do besides cut right or left at the last second."

cars,fdjgi39,t3_elkdu9,1578469790.0,"This is kind of a loaded question to an extent. 1.0L v10 will have to rev to the moon to make power. It'll probably make shit for torque but a lot of horsepower relative to it's displacement because of how quickly and high it revs. A 1.0L i4 found in certain Honda’s (CBR 1000rr) gets 37MPG US, has like 200HP or so, but only weighs 430lb. A 250r, quite literally 1/4 the engine (.25L single cylinder) gets like 75 MPG while weighing close to 230 probably with 20ish HP.

The issue with MPG is moreso that the bike will be so far away from peak torque in like every gear unless you’re ballsy, first gear tops out close to 90 MPH, so I’m guessing at peak torque you’ll be doing maybe 60– 25 MPH will probably be around 3000 rpm or so (out of 13000 rpm). A 250 is geared a lot smaller so it’ll be at its peak torque at 7000 (out of 10000 rpm) at normal speeds, 7000 in second gear is like 30 iirc, and it pretty much increases by 10 MPH each gear you go up (70 in 6th at 7000 rpm, 60 in 5th, etc.)

The reason the 1000rr gets worse fuel economy is really intent and gearing. Short gearing would drop its acceleration and top speed, which would be bad because it’s a race replica bike. Give it a top speed of 80Mph and gear it super short and sure, it’ll probably get better MPG than 37 but It’ll really never beat the 250 or anything that manages its gearing for legal speeds well.

Not really an apples to apples comparison, but my 3.0L v6 Honda has an epa estimation of 20 MPG with a 3200Lb weight and 200Hp I think.  I really don’t know the gearing but you can kinda see how the RR gets better mpg but is totally like shit in actuality. Pushing 1/8 the weight of my car but only getting 1.5x the mpg, whereas the 250 gets a bit more than 3.5x my mpg but  also weighing as much as like my bed.

EDIT: certain cylinder configs will lend a higher HP. 250cc sport bikes exist in 1,2,and 4 cylinder configs. The i4 250cc bikes make tons more power than any with fewer cylinders because of moments, but still like less than 50 HP I think and with a less usable power band."

In the summer ( I live in NJ ) I would daily it nonstop. I'd go to the gym, Stop and Shop, WaWa, Costco, etc. for groceries or whatever. It had to be really limited though. I use a typical school backpack so I can't fit as much as I can in my car. I am super adamant about it. I'm always like ""look man, I'm tryna have fun within the journey/ traffic"""

Acura,fdiogbx,t1_fdij93h,1578447456.0,"I’m currently in a 2002 v6 accord, looks to be around 6 inches longer and 1 inch wider with a 1 inch longer wheelbase too, all things relative to the TSX. My accord is surprisingly 100lb lighter or so too. I’d wager my accord is probably gonna be identical to a TL I’m guessing and I’m mainly just looking for something to mod (bolt ons) and stance, I don’t do track days but I don’t really need a lot of room either. I rarely use my rear seats as it is."
Acura,fdi5fll,t3_e9gtea,1578436056.0,This is cool! How do you like your car? Kinda split between a TL or TSX (both stick) in the near future.
Acura,fdi4n3v,t3_ej8rlo,1578435659.0,"If your mom has the AWD TL, it’s the 3.7. That being said, I’m not an owner but the j35s in both the 3g TL-S and 4g TL seem to be identical. The designation is different but bore and stroke are the same and HP is like 6 off. It’s probably gonna sound the same, but I imagine the intake is going to be the biggest difference/ reason for more HP."
