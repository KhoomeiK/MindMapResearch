You misunderstand- Pentacostals' belief isn't *based* on that feeling, that's just them noting the product of it. It's *based* on Jesus literally saying that it would be a sign exhibited by his true believers...

 I'd absolutely argue that the way Pentacostals speak in tongues is in a manner of prayer. It is done while assembled as a congregation, as a worship community for the purpose of praising gods greatness - it's not like it just kind of happens while sitting in traffic or shopping or what have you.

No it's not, because that's not what I said. In fact, this strawman of yours is the only fallacy I'm seeing here.
