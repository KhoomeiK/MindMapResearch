technews,ffg3ibt,t1_ffdrp0q,1579897665.0,"Market cap is not valued at just revenue - expenses. Included is forward looking growth and opportunity, earning potential, market share. It’s hard to compare 10m gas vehicles to the 400k electric vehicles.

Tesla cars cost quite a bit more than the standard Toyota, and most folks are looking for a cheaper reliable car, not a luxury vehicle and are not or cannot afford to think about the environmental impacts.

Toyota also has the benefit of having a long established and well funded logistics network, and economies of scale are a major player in their ability to get cars out for “dirt cheap” and still make profit on those sales. Tesla’s only *really* been around for 10 years. Prior to this they were a super niche roadster company still researching and developing. 

And a ton of people forget Tesla also has hands in Solar, grid power, AI and self driving, which have the potential to be massive money makers in the future once they’re fleshed out. 

I love Toyota, until I get a tesla I wouldn’t own anything else. I’m wary of Tesla’s current valuation, but I don’t think it’s very far off from being super fair."

Is it super hot BEFORE you strangle your one eyed yogurt spitting snake? Or just during/after? From both friction and increased blood flow you will notice an increase in temp, but it shouldn’t be to the point it’s too hot to handle. 

If its hot before, see a doctor, if you try it with lotion, and it’s still super hot, see a doctor. If you just beat your meat a little different and the lotion solves it, should be fine.

Notify the power company of the situation and dispute the account ( and any other accounts she opened) on your credit report. The power company will help you at the very least clear up the debt. You don’t have to sue your mom, but you may have to file a police report, the power company can and will go after HER for the $5400 and not expect you to pay it. If they can’t recover it they’ll write it off after a while. They account for this and have insurance to protect them against this, they’ll be fine and best case scenario your mom will just have ruined her credit, which is what she has done to you. This is reversible, but it’s going to be a pain in the ass. Just DO NOT PAY IT.
