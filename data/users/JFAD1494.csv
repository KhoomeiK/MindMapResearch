Doom,fffqjlb,t3_et8buc,1579889629.0,I got it working by using the latest version of GZDoom. I think this might be my new favourite way to play the original Wolfenstein.
Doom,ffesjd9,t1_ffeqsbi,1579863461.0,"No text file. The version I downloaded was uploaded just last month so I thought it might work with the newer ones though. The main thing I want is a version of Wolfenstein 3D on PC that has the flamethrower and rocket launcher so if there's any alternatives, let me know."

THPS,feyplyn,t1_fey6jhi,1579448811.0,"Nice to see Proving Ground get some love. I only started playing it for the first time a couple weeks ago and I'm liking what I've seen so far. The physics feel really good, I think."

IWantToLearn,feje9da,t3_epe44e,1579169824.0,"There was a TV documentary about the Beatles, called Anthology, which aired back in 1995. It's a couple of episodes long and covers the whole history of the band. You could start there."

PixelArt,fejdhn7,t3_epft4g,1579168667.0,I don't know why this got downvoted. That's great.
tmbg,fehdia3,t3_ep4mw8,1579114313.0,Classic album. I listened to Live in Australia today to celebrate. That version of Particle Man is my favourite.
KennyOmega,fed189f,t3_eod63q,1578993579.0,Kenny or Bret Hart would be cool
KennyOmega,feb0pum,t3_eo07wv,1578954270.0,Another big Lucha Underground name. They're doing a great job bringing in the talent. That'll be a big loss to Impact.

romhacking,fcw3jnt,t1_fbwnn3w,1578016324.0,"Saitama has his 'consecutive normal punches' too so if you wanted to balance it a bit, you could make the regular punches the same and have it where the star punches always win the fights."

FreeProWrestling,fcu30mc,t1_fcu1v2r,1577971010.0,Sorry for that. A friend of mine recommended the sub so I thought I'd cross post. I was thinking that was the case. I mean no harm. I'll take it down now.
Cd_collectors,fcsvxio,t3_eik21m,1577926473.0,Nice set. I'm on the look out for that Ghost one. I have Meliora and Prequelle in my own collection.
THPS,fcss6h5,t1_fcsq0cm,1577923759.0,I've not played that one yet. I skipped over it as a kid since I was kind of burnt out on the series after THUG2. It's only recently I've started to get back into them. An 80s theme sounds good though.
THPS,fcsplwv,t3_egu9ql,1577921906.0,"The music and simplicity of the controls/gameplay. I was introduced to the series by these two guys that lived on my street, via the Xbox version of THPS3. I remember picking it up pretty quickly and busting out some combos. Our favourite song on the soundtrack was Ace of Spades and we'd go extra crazy when that came on."
truegaming,fcqr3gf,t3_ei51n2,1577890877.0,"I thought Metroid: Samus Returns on the 3DS did a good job 'casualizing' the Metriod series with the radar system it had, where you could reveal an area of the map to show if items were near. The counter attack system they had where the enemies would flash was a good way to make the combat a bit more accessible too."

romhacking,fcqjdpx,t3_ed712l,1577887040.0,"My dream Mario hack would be if someone could increase the resolution of Super Mario Bros Deluxe. It's my favourite version of the first Mario but being a Gameboy game, it can feel kind of cramped."

BretHart,fcgscm0,t3_eh2a36,1577643564.0,Badass. I guess Ric Flair Drip wasn't the first rap song about a wrestler.
SubofJericho,fcgp1r9,t1_fcgmz2n,1577642527.0,"Yeah, ROH really isn't great. They seem too nostalgic for the ECW days and the quality of the gimmicks is pretty low from what I've seen. They keep pushing Bully Ray as one of the top guys for some reason."

KennyOmega,fc701ym,t3_egjmeo,1577493932.0,"I hope the two of them get to work together again at some point in the future, even if it's not NJPW. Definitely the greatest wrestling bromance."
THPS,fc679dt,t3_egf79s,1577473889.0,All models of PS3 will play the PS1 games but only the early models will play the PS2 ones.
nosurf,fc17e0k,t3_efjegz,1577310378.0,I know what you mean. It's easy to fall down the rabbit hole of suggestions. I used to be a sucker for those Korean street food videos that'd show up. What I ended up doing was putting all my subscriptions into Feedly and swapping over to Newpipe.
