AskReddit,ffao17c,t3_esksf0,1579740459.0," Huge turning point in my masculinity after watching a small kid getting picked on and beat up by some bully bent on terrorizing the entire cabin (and doing absolutely nothing about it because I was 8...and scared shitless). Then after this big bully punched the little kid again during lunch line...one of my best friends went over, grabbed the big bully by the throat and quietly told the kid that if he touched or bullied any more people...he was going to get his ass kicked to high hell. Never had a problem in that cabin again. Sad thing was...the kid who stood up for everyone was one of my best friends who looked up to ME. I'll never forget how humiliating it was to just sit there and let that bully terrorize everyone. Forever changed my life after that day. Told myself I'd never be that scared kid every again...and I'd stand up for others who couldn't for themselves....even if the odds against me were overwhelming.  Haven't to this day."

NoStupidQuestions,ffa51ut,t1_ffa397f,1579728026.0,Thats what you need to figure out. I went to SCAD for photography and dropped out after my first year after my photography prof said I was wasting my time and copious  amounts of money at the overpriced art school. Told me I had a great eye and showed great techniques in my initial works I entered. So I dropped out the next semester.  As far as what you should shoot...that's purely up to what kind of eye you have and what level of risk you're ok with taking. I've taken amazing portraits of 4 year old little kids smoking cigars...to an intimate view of a woman dying from stage 4 pancreatic cancer...to the death and destruction of an F 5 tornado in a poor subdivision in Alabama.  Remember this: Good is the enemy of GREAT.
