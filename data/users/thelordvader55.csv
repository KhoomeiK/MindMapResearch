depression,ff72vqa,t1_ff6kn2u,1579640029.0,My complaint is just that we don't live long enough. I feel like 80 years on average isn't a whole lot of time.
depression,ff2hbmw,t3_er8ejf,1579506134.0,"For me I feel like I'm never good enough for any purpose I can fulfill. All of my hobbies get tiring after a while because I'll never be the best at it. My gamedev projects can get tiring when I see other works and realize mine looks like shit. Any purpose I could potentially fulfill feels like I'd be a garbage offbrand imposter who can't be the best, so why even try at all"
depression,ff2h55l,t3_er8g22,1579505913.0,"That's been the start of this year for me, and kinda a little bit of the end of last year. My brain has been off the rails and it's been super hard to not fixate on bad thoughts, and as a result I've been feeling more tired/sluggish. The only real thing I've done to combat this is to push forward with what I need to do, even though I'll feel like shit doing it."
depression,ff2gys2,t3_er8lx7,1579505698.0,"I experience a lot of this. It's really weird when something tragic, like death, happens and I can't come up with that same response others have without being disingenuous. Part of me thinks that we're all just gonna end up dead in a mere 80 years anyway, so why should I bother putting energy into someone who was gonna be gone anyways?"
depression,ff2gp2l,t3_er8ttv,1579505369.0,"Everything I do usually feels fake. I see something that should be funny and laugh like I'm supposed to, but I don't actually feel humored. When someone does something stupid I get frustrated because that's the appropriate response, in reality I couldn't care less. I feel like it's become harder and harder to muster any genuine response to anything. The best way to phrase it is that I just feel like an empty husk, going through the motions until I can't."
depression,ff0e67m,t3_equ4dc,1579468015.0,"Yeah, sometimes I'll be doing things that I should consider fun, but then all of a sudden this switch goes off in my brain and I just want to wrap up whatever I'm doing because i feel tired all of a sudden."
gamemaker,fezzcky,t1_fezygu0,1579463493.0,And you say you're using the collision event to do this? Try using a step event instead and seeing if it fixes the issue
gamemaker,fezxsmw,t3_eqysym,1579463096.0,Is this code written under the text object or player object? If it's under the player object then place_meeting is looking for an overlap with another player object rather than the text object.

Advice,feojoyy,t1_feoi98t,1579301060.0,Thanks for the advice
Advice,feo97l1,t1_feo1pp4,1579296768.0,"I'm usually opposed, but someone else in the comments mentioned that it's harmless, so I'm willing to look more into it"
Advice,fenvjgb,t1_feluzok,1579291556.0,Thanks for the advice :)
Advice,fenvemi,t1_felw8hx,1579291482.0,"Sounds neat, I'll look into it"
Advice,fenvaqz,t1_felygqx,1579291417.0,"I'm typically against taking meds too often, but if it's not bad like you say I'll definitely look into it."
Advice,fenv3wd,t1_femc1kx,1579291304.0,"I'm typically still until I'm actually sleeping. It's more of me not being able to think about nothing. My mind starts racing before I sleep, making it hard to sleep."
smashbros,fedy66m,t1_fednyja,1579022374.0,"I've been kind of tired of 3rd party characters (unless it's gonna be indie), but in the end I'll be grateful for whatever we get anyways :)"
smashbros,fednb4e,t1_fedlbnf,1579015680.0,"Have they actually said each character will be from a new franchise? I know that's been the trend so far, but I haven't actually seen any quote about that."
depression,feciucn,t3_eo71t2,1578974970.0,"I honestly wouldn't mind working my ass off forever to sustain livelihood if I was given the choice to live forever or at least a very extended period of time. The fact I only have 80 years on average to do things isn't satisfactory to me, and I might as well do nothing if it's all gonna amount to nothing in the end. Even if I could live forever, we're all just gonna end up as a big scrambled hydrogen cloud trillions of years from now so what's the point if I can't even retain consciousness or memories?"
depression,fe0kyx3,t3_enjmi4,1578815278.0,"I feel as if I'm pretty similar, I'm not completely dead inside but I feel those moments I feel alive are sparse. I also don't get sad music. If I'm in a state of mind where I feel nothing, I play super loud high energy music in an attempt to stop feeling tired or drained and continue with my day"
depression,fe0iftw,t3_enhwpv,1578813898.0,"I'm in the same boat. My life isn't horrible, but the fact that I know that one day everything will end kind of puts me off of trying to care. Sorry I don't have a solution, but it's nice for me to know I'm not the only one who feels this way."
depression,fe0fm35,t3_enjhpq,1578812598.0,"As someone who suffers from the latter, I'd definitely rather feel numb. In some sick twisted way, I think it can be useful in some situations where you just need to cut out all the bullshit emotions and take a pragmatic approach. I think being sad all the time is awful and I couldn't imagine having to live with that. Not trying to glorify being numb for the record, it can be tiring to pretend to give a shit all the time and sometimes I wish more things could make me genuinely laugh/smile or bring joy to me."
depression,fe0aorv,t3_en2qbu,1578807950.0,"I can relate. I find it hard to do things when I know in the end it'll amount to absolutely zero because we'll all just end up dead. People will say to do things you enjoy, but what does that matter if you can't reminisce on those moments for an indefinite amount of time? Sure you can have fun in the moment but that's just a temporary high, but once again in the grand scheme of things it's just nothing. Feels like I'm in a waiting room for the next half century, but I'm not impatient enough to just get out and leave."
Advice,fdqoj8y,t1_fdq5dlc,1578671473.0,"It's a thought that's crossed my mind before, but I've never been diagnosed with anything and part of me doesn't know if I want to because it'd confirm my fears."
