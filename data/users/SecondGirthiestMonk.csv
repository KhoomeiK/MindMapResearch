 you're clearly very well researched on music in the relevant time periods and genres. 

It pisses me off too, and I include Led Zeppelin in there as just as overrated. I appreciate all these mentioned bands, they're still talented but it's disgraceful to overlook what came before, and during their time. None of them were groundbreaking. 

What fucks me off about it, it seems 'marketability' was the possibly biggest factor to why these three (and Elvis) were as massively widely known which people mistake for quality. They were all attractive, white and young. It's seems like a bit of a hangover from the days where music came through pre-approved financial mainstream pipelines. People didn't really know about anything that wasn't internationally plugged before the invention of the internet. Music labels and executives held control of what filtered through the few available media outlets, and undoubtedly like today, they care about what sells.

Seriously, people no longer discuss actual issues but instead are throwing around labels. I feel like I'm going insane, I hardly ever see an actual conversation that isn't just ...icans do this, ...ism is just this or that...erals always do that...

Is it just me or did politics devolve at some point?

 I swear it didn't used to just be arguing definitions of labels, throwing insults and whatnot like they're sports team rivalries. And I don't even just mean party politics, every single point is just talked about via some label (e.g. communism, neo-liberal, whatever).
