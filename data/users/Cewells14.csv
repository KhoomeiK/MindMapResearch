IndianaUniversity,fe01zf5,t1_fdzuurh,1578801075.0,"Yeah my strategy so far has just been to retake the prerequisites, because I'd rather be safe than sorry. Luckily medical school admissions requirements are almost always easy to find on the schools' websites. Still, it is frustrating hearing conflicting information from people who are supposed to be helping! Thank you for your advice!"
IndianaUniversity,fdyvyl9,t3_emz7kq,1578784124.0,"I'm a freshman, and I've already had plenty of advisor problems. Advisors telling me I don't need to take certain required classes, telling me to take classes I don't need... It's very frustrating. I'm hoping to go to medical school, so I've ""retaken"" some prerequisites that I initially took as ap classes: calculus, biology, etc. My honors advisor is trying to tell me now that I didn't have to take those again. I know for a fact that many medical schools want their prerequisites taken on the collegiate level. I don't know who to trust. I'm pretty much relying on my own research to choose classes since I can't listen to any of the advisors anymore."

namenerds,fds50h5,t3_em207l,1578694493.0,"I'm Chloe, and I was almost named Autumn. I like autumn better. I have auburn hair and pale, freckly skin, so I feel like it would fit my appearance better, not to mention my general demeanor. Honestly I don't hate my name but I kind of cringe at it sometimes. It just has such a bratty vibe. It looks cute on little kids, but how's it going to look when I'm in my fifties?"
college,fdqu1kr,t3_emr95v,1578674870.0,"I think you should strongly consider taking the year off. You could try a reduced course load, and definitely look into that, but if you take a year to work while maybe visiting a therapist, you could potentially be a lot more motivated by the time next spring rolls around. You have to keep busy, though. Take some time right now to grieve, and don't rush into work or school if you can avoid it. Then when you're ready make sure you fill your schedule with some positive things to do. I'm very sorry for your loss. :("

AskReddit,fdj723f,t3_elgpmo,1578460273.0,"Mental health should be prioritized as much as physical health. I don't think many people my age get yearly medical exams, but regular mental health assessments (say, along with vaccinations) would be a good way to start focusing more on mental health. As a teenager I was always asked about my mental health briefly during checkups with my pediatrician, but I never admitted my problems to her out of fear and shame. It's a sign of some cultural changes that need to take place."

misophonia,fd702vv,t3_ejxwgg,1578197834.0,"I adore the sound of the piano. I work in a library in my college dorm that has a lounge with a piano right outside, and I could listen for hours. It's just a lovely and rich sound, and it reminds me of a good friend of mine from high school."
AskReddit,fcpkius,t3_eic8yl,1577866349.0,The thing is... I don't know that I've learned a thing in these eight years.
offmychest,fcjkftk,t3_eh2v9j,1577691205.0,"When I was 16 I was wishing the exact same thing. My parents told me my whole fucking life ""we're getting divorced"" over and over only to turn around every time and say ""wait no we're not"". It gets exhausting to live with the fighting and to grow up in a stubbornly unhappy household. I'm sorry for all you've had to deal with.

I'm 18 and my parents just split officially, during my first semester of college. I still wish they had done it long ago and saved both me and themselves the pain, not only of a bitter, poorly timed divorce, but of years living in an unhappy home."
AskReddit,fc2w9q5,t3_efqzp6,1577375725.0,"Well it definitely wasn't completely ruined, but my dog had some sort of episode and lost all control of legs, bowel, bladder, etc. very suddenly when I got home from breakfast at my sister's place. I was home alone with her and didn't know what to do. She seemed to be struggling to breath and maybe trying to throw up so I took her outside and sat on the front lawn with her but she just laid in the grass twitching and making this hissing sound. 

I called my dad and just tried to comfort her until he arrived. I really thought my dog (really my mom's dog, the family dog) was going to die right in front of me on Christmas Day.

I took her back inside and she got a bit better. She was breathing normally by the time my dad showed up. She started walking again later and now is actually acting like nothing happened. My mom came home from work crying her eyes out later that night. Overall, not the highlight of the day, but I'm happy she's doing better now. We'll have to take her to the vet today. She's old, but she's never had anything like this happen. I'm just really glad she didn't die yesterday, especially with no one else around."
college,fa2gih8,t3_e774xg,1575781811.0,"I'm also OOS, about 1500 miles from home. First semester wasn't perfect, but it was really good. I dealt with a lot of mental health issues in high school, had no friends. College to me was a chance to restart and become someone else. In a lot of ways, it has worked. Being completely surrounded by the unfamiliar forced me to break old habits and search for connection. I have several people I can call friends I feel more motivated in my classes than I did in high school. I live in a beautiful town in my favorite state and there are a lot of lovely people here. I have learned a lot and I feel lucky to be here. 

But it's also been challenging in several respects. I'm not completely better mentally, and I'm currently struggling a lot with insecurity. I am a lot more self-critical than I used to be, and I tend to dwell on things I dislike about myself, which probably holds me back in friendships and other relationships. My family has also kind of fallen apart. I've had to deal with my parents' immediate divorce and mom's suicidal thoughts from states away. Since I don't have any super close friends here yet I don't really feel like there's someone I can talk to when any of these things are bothering me."
