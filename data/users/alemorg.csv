SuicideWatch,fgr6hmz,t3_f01x51,1581039342.0,Man you’re carrying a heavy burden. Feel free to shoot me message over chat and we can talk about it
SuicideWatch,fgr65ue,t3_f01xrd,1581039108.0,Same man. Everyday I wish I could kill myself but my body for some reason wants to live. I also can’t give up so I can fight for those who have no voice. I can’t give up on them. Shoot me message on chat we can talk about anything.
SuicideWatch,fgr61qp,t3_f021b1,1581039027.0,"If you’re boyfriend cares for you, you can’t do it. Just imagine how traumatized he’d be finding your body. I understand how pain can feel and Change our thoughts. Feel free to talk to me over chat talk about something cool you like. I’ll just listen and give input lol. Or talk about anything."
SuicideWatch,fgr5w5a,t3_f029zg,1581038921.0,I can try to care man. Tell me what’s bothering you over chat. Also my grammar is gonna suck if we chat so apologies in advance.
SuicideWatch,fgr5p53,t3_f02feu,1581038787.0,It’s true it might relive everything but that’s only because you won’t have a body to feel. I have no clue what you’re going through but I’m sorry you feel that way. I apologize on behalf of society as a member of it. Shoot me a message we can talk about anything you like.
SuicideWatch,fgr5k7u,t3_f02ghp,1581038692.0,"I can relate as well. I feel like I’m a waste of oxygen and should just be decomposed for the good of the soil. But we gotta see the few bright sides. Hey you managed to find a partner, you managed to get a couple of jobs even if you weren’t the best at them. Get away from the train tracks. You don’t wanna traumatize the poor train conductor guy. You wanna talk about anything you like no matter how small big a topic just shoot me a message."
SuicideWatch,fgr58tc,t3_f02ghq,1581038468.0,Apparently it causes low glucose levels in your blood. I’m not sure exactly on how that would feel but I’m guessing you’d feel some kind of pain in your organs or just an overwhelming sensation to pass out. I’m guessing you’d probably have to overdose on allllloot of insulin to die from it. I wouldn’t go through with it man not only because well you might just fuck your body but also because it’s not worth it. Shoot me a message we can talk about ducks for all I care.
SuicideWatch,fgr4vek,t3_f02ino,1581038207.0,"Some parents were just not meant to be parents. Try to start an open communication with them. I know it’s hard to do that sometimes because my parents are the most stubborn people I know. If it doesn’t work it doesn’t work, try to put your anger into something else like improving yourself. Also about the gun man you have to get rid of it. Even if you decide you don’t wanna kill yourself anymore you can just keep it as an option for the future. I don’t know what you’re going through but overcoming more pain only makes you stronger. Also you can’t expect the world to change you, real change comes from within yourself no matter how inspirational or motivational someone can be. If no one cares about you make it your mission to care about yourself. There’s probably a ton of celebrities out there that have millions of fans that would give them their liver but don’t even care about themselves. You don’t need anyone’s approval. You do you and that’s enough."
sailing,fgr1bhi,t3_ezzihf,1581035949.0,What a beauty!!!
WhitePeopleTwitter,fgr08j5,t1_fgqsym7,1581035290.0,Government bro... what we gonna do about it?? No wonder nothing can ever get done! Not only does this reduce productivity it doesn’t incentivize people to work hard anymore and it makes hard workers hate their job.
WhitePeopleTwitter,fgqrrn7,t1_fgqrfzp,1581030091.0,That’s what I’ve heard as well. Easiest way to get fired is watch porn and besides that you’d have to do more fucked up shit which is very unlikely. This one persons job is so fucking simple it’s fucking ridiculous how much they get paid (80k) just to do something that could be automated or given to literally anyone else with basic computer skills.
FREE,fgqm445,t3_ezzakg,1581026822.0,Second Year college student here! I’m kind of tired of eating Taco Bell and rationing large dominoes pizza... Some fresh food would be nice for a change (More than likely I’ll buy some chicken and eat that for days buts it’s better than Taco Bell)
PublicFreakout,fgpcy54,t3_ezncsu,1581002265.0,This is years old. This was filmed in Cornell where bill was having a speech or something.
WhitePeopleTwitter,fgpcstx,t1_fgpcpwe,1581002175.0,Who is your master?
WhitePeopleTwitter,fgpcmvn,t1_fgpcg9t,1581002075.0,That’s what everyone in the office says... he could of easily had a good retirement at 60 or even younger because he’s been working his entire life there apparently. You’d be appalled the amount of work they do in federal jobs.... (obviously there are federal workers that work way more than they should but that’s an exception)
memes,fgpc90n,t1_fgoz6h5,1581001840.0,Quantum computing chip!
WhitePeopleTwitter,fgpbj86,t1_fgp61ki,1581001399.0,Lol that’s what a federal employee told me too!!!! Apparently they have a worker that’s 100 yrs old and he doesn’t want to use the computer so they had to hire someone to help him use the computer.... they can’t fire him..... Government mismanagement at its best!!!!
LifeProTips,fglyrhs,t1_fglu8k5,1580914212.0,I sent a bunch of emails to lyft and called them and tried to escalate the situation. The customer service is tasked to ignore all responsibility. Them helping is admitting responsibility. These companies need to be taken down
2meirl4meirl,fglkwxk,t1_fgki37l,1580902647.0,I appreciate your meme man don’t listen to the haters
MakeNewFriendsHere,fgipygr,t3_eyq0qm,1580828249.0,Ayy college student here! I like to talk about anything lol
MakeNewFriendsHere,fgipiyo,t3_eyppow,1580827955.0,Yo what’s up man!! I’m a college student in the US that speaks multiple languages and like to talk to people from different cultures! Send a me message anytime
FREE,fgimf8w,t3_eyislp,1580825750.0,Bro you’d make my day and restore my faith in humanity I lost years ago. Pizza is the real move!!!
LifeProTips,fgav1rw,t1_fgaufn1,1580655688.0,Some small businesses don’t do background checks that’s true. The thing is if I own a bookstore I’m going to interview people and most likely choose someone who doesn’t give me creep vibes compared to uber and lyft where there is no one interviewing the people.
business,fg8ablg,t1_fg6rzph,1580613789.0,They have this plant based alternative that’s really popular in Finland. It’s made from oats and you can eat a bunch of different ways. They’re even making bacon now!!!!!
weed,fg3v5z4,t3_ewo4qm,1580490354.0,Flexing out her with the pink!!!!
LifeProTips,fg35t2t,t1_fg2z3l5,1580471501.0,"It’s not a minimum wage job. There are plenty of jobs that are actually minimum wage that background check their employees. Uber and Lyft might attract the same kind of people but it’s their job to make sure they’re not hiring dangerous people just as an official company would. And it’s not about having a masters degree. There’s probably a bunch of creeps with a masters degree too. I do agree that it’s capitalism at it’s finest. I’m just disappointed that a lot of these startups are from the best schools in the US and you’d think they’d create a better future., but instead end up making everything worse."
BOLIVIA,fg1yewo,t1_ffp9pqm,1580435090.0,Hi is it possible If I could buy them off you? I’m Bolivian but live abroad (US) it’d be cool to have this.
BOLIVIA,fg1y52t,t3_evfq3u,1580434971.0,Hi I’m going to Bolivia in a month or so. But I am a native Bolivian. I’ve never done a postcard exchange before how does it work? Also I have to let you know that if you try to mail something to bolivia we don’t have a government mail service. It has to go through fedex and it might take months.
ZeroWaste,fg1o4sc,t3_ewe8hm,1580430653.0,Cool company!
LifeProTips,fg15fiv,t1_fg0qq9e,1580421105.0,I’ve had and know of similar experiences. Greed and profit is the cause of this. Lyft and Uber have tried to solve a problem but have only created them. They need to step up their verification process ASAP. It’s disgusting that the company doesn’t do more.
LifeProTips,fg14x5a,t3_ew866h,1580420817.0,"I got scammed from a lyft driver and basically was held hostage. Lyft didn’t do shit about it. I’ve had multiple friends with creepy drivers. Honestly lyft and Uber at this point need to step up their verification process. These companies were supposed to solve a problem not create more. They probably legally don’t have to assume full responsibility for a drivers action since their technically not legally an employee but an independent contractor. I’ve had a lyft driver offer to smoke weed with my friend, granted my friend accepted and smoked weed with him but not cooool.... I think it’s time we start complaining."
college,ffzpakx,t3_ew11hs,1580388808.0,lol same. I’m finally getting mental health help!!!!! After years of suffering I’m getting help!!
lego,ffy5efi,t3_evmnq3,1580338880.0,Yooo I think I had that one. One of my first pieces if I can remember. Awesome!!
CFA,ffcwxjm,t1_ffcv009,1579808983.0,We’re on the same page I just can’t word stuff for shit lol.
CFA,ffctr5n,t1_ffctavl,1579807086.0,By financial status I mean like they know what they’re doing with their money and not like making out credit cards right and left even if they are rich. Also people with a better financial status usually are more motivated so yeah.
CFA,ffchobh,t1_ffcg2qf,1579799679.0,Not accusing I just wanted to know the specifics lol. Sounds about right. I know I only try to date women with the same financial status. Obviously I don’t disregard people just for being poor but you know what I mean.
CFA,ffcevx7,t1_ffc59da,1579797969.0,Sounds about right. How many of those dates have been quality though? Also how do you know for sure it’s because of your LinkedIn?
benzodiazepines,ffcemje,t1_ffby6x5,1579797809.0,Sounds good then!
Shoestring,ffcc5pw,t3_esebfh,1579796271.0,Hi South American native here. I think if you’re eating at budget places like for example no international chains and you eat a local restaurant that isn’t fancy you should be good on food. Vegetarian specific cafes will charge a lot more. Those hip places probably charge the same as an upscale fast food place would like Cava or Sweetgreen if you’re familiar. Transportation is your biggest concern. If you take buses between cities it should be pretty affordable. Tours are pretty expensive. If you want a guided tour through anything outdoorsy it might cost you a lot. But these are usually geared through outsiders/Americans. Try not to get swindled. People see Americans and they will charge you more.
CFA,ffbwr7p,t1_ffbclkn,1579785299.0,"You always gotta remember LinkedIn. I had a friend who blocked his ex in literally every form of communication except LinkedIn because he forgot about it. A week after he blocked her, his ex asked to follow his LinkedIn...."
