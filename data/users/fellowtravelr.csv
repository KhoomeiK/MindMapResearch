AskReddit,fdqf5p5,t3_emr9ml,1578665083.0,Dysfunction. Orange juice and Bailey's. $20 and no matter how much tip you get the bartender will give you a disappointed look.
todayilearned,fdqf10k,t1_fdqe8r3,1578664982.0,"Like, right next to other passengers? Yea maybe but imagine how weird / gross that would be if you were sitting there. 

Probably they cleared a row of seats to do it in, like at the back."
todayilearned,fdqdx3w,t3_emr4e7,1578664119.0,"Wow! My question is where the heck on a plane did they do the actual surgery? Is there a secret lounge in not familiar with? Jk. But for real, like, in the aisle? Or on one of those tiny counters where they prep food?"

Psychonaut,fdq7ezq,t3_emo0cb,1578658041.0,"




You can withdraw from the world AND have community. Join Twin Oaks or another such commune and live out your days in the woods surrounded by likeminded people. If racked with guilt, take time to go out there and battle, do activism, etc. Retreat back to commune for rest and healing. Travel to renew faith in humanity. Repeat cycle."

couchsurfing,fdletux,t3_elzidp,1578522496.0,"That sounds frustrating. I would be upset too, if I brought a surfer out and they wanted to spend a lot of money on shopping. When I am a guest I try to help out my hosts with cooking and cleaning at least so there is some give and take. 

Its also important to set boundaries - you may be giving more than you can ""afford"" to give. If you give with desire for something in return, its not true giving. It will set you up for resentment."
CostaRicaTravel,fdlasbl,t3_elw1kv,1578520065.0,What part of Costa Rica are you talking about? I'm going to the Pavones area. Does anyone know about that area?

solotravel,fcbcwfk,t1_fcaz1y3,1577585323.0,Awww. How old is he? What are you doing in the meantime?
confession,fcb0ky4,t3_egtp3e,1577580302.0,"It was an accident and freak tragedy. You only meant to push him over. You need to forgive yourself and move on. Things happen. People with paralysis can live happy lives. I saw a study that shower that lottery winners and quadriplegics both return to their original state of happiness one year later. That person you hurt accidentally can be happy again. It's good you feel bad, but if you can grow from this and try to be kind to others from now on, then that will be good enough. You are not a monster. You are just a kid who made a mistake. You are worthy of love and forgiveness."

driving,fc701cn,t1_fc5bvuv,1577493919.0,Coming to a complete stop on the highway for the purpose of merging is legal?! That sounds so unsafe.
commune,fc6wg7y,t1_fc6rzgl,1577491258.0,"I think they do, though they seem to prefer families with only one or two children. 

They ask everyone to get verbal consent before touching anyone else, so if you are touchy conversationally that takes getting used to.

It's shared living spaces so it feels kind of like going back to college, i.e. no private bathroom. 

Monthly allowance is $80, so if you have multiple vices or like fancy things it probably would be a problem. But they meet all your basic needs so if you are minimalist it's totally fine. 

If you hate vegetables you won't like the food they serve."
