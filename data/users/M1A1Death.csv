Surface,ff699pr,t1_ff67ic9,1579622126.0,Yeah I had the Surface Pro 6 before trading it in for the SB2. I do miss the form factor every now and then but nothing beats having a full keyboard and a dGPU
Surface,ff67e2r,t1_ff62v8z,1579620894.0,I like it flat and least bulky
Surface,ff612fy,t1_ff5zgqw,1579616406.0,Nope. Tried one and didn't like it. I don't have any scratches and use it daily with the pen.
subaruoutback,ff1jvh1,t1_ff0nr9e,1579480352.0,I'll give these a try. I'm looking to find yellow bulbs for the fog lights as well. The ones that come stock are useless.
college,ff1jkyf,t1_ff18qco,1579480226.0,My veterans office sucks. They barely know anything other than certifying my credit hours. Last semester (before all this happened) I asked them if there was any veterans groups on campus and their answer was to google it.
subaruoutback,ff0edov,t3_ena29b,1579468089.0,Do you need any new wiring with these or is it just plug and play?
subaruoutback,fezyhc9,t1_fezl9rp,1579463274.0,I'm assuming it'll go down by 2-3. I have a Thule rooftop cargo thing on at all times too so I've given up on MPGs lol

legaladvice,feehzv6,t1_feehk4k,1579034141.0,And this is why marriage is stupid. My siblings and I are getting screwed out of everything my father owns because of it. She's locking all of us out. I guess i'll just take the loss on the plane tickets and atleast get a free consultation at a nearby attorney to make sure. Thanks for the info. It sucks giving up everything your father loved to someone who never cared about it.
legaladvice,feehbom,t1_feegm0t,1579033755.0,Hmm that's a good point. But wouldn't it be seen as me receiving her goods in exchange for my service of retrieving her other goods? Or something along that line.
legaladvice,feefvz2,t1_fee2llj,1579032922.0,So if we both agree to receive goods on both sides of the agreement. Doesn't that constitute an exchange sort of like this [link](https://www.lawdepot.com/blog/are-verbal-agreements-legally-binding/) says? I already fronted hundreds of dollars and planned a trip around this agreement so I couldn't seek reimbursement for the funds spent on it plus the initial items that I made the trip in order to retrieve with the agreement previously made?
college,feb4tg9,t1_feb26qs,1578955409.0,"I didn't inherit it. I simply was put in charge of managing the little things he had. I have to pay for his funeral too. I was extremely minimal in planning it so it will be about 4000, dollars. His estate will most like be considered insoluble"

college,fe8uw3e,t1_fe8u0r8,1578931145.0,Well I do make about double minimum wage part time but I have to work some to pay my bills. I'm 27 and have been independent since 18. I am going to be doing school though as well. We'll see how it goes
SuicideBereavement,fe6ix61,t3_emoe14,1578892357.0,"I just lost my father on Christmas Day '19. It's only been a few weeks but I am still having a hard time coming to terms with reality. He called my two brothers a few days prior and said strange things but didn't call me because I was working at the time and he was always a very considerate person. There was no note, and he was considerate enough of us finding him after that he drove a few states away to do it.  

It hurts. It's fresh in my mind, my body, and my heart. The only thing that helps is talking about how things make you feel instead of trying to figure out 'why'. I obsessed over my father's death for the first week. I never, and I mean never stopped searching for answers. Now that i've spoken to so many people in my life, and a few professionals, i've learned that some answers aren't meant to be found. Your father probably chose the day you were working so you wouldn't find him. He was protecting you. I've read two books about suicide and the human mind since Christmas and the biggest thing that both had in common was ""the switch"".  

The switch is just a way of seeing how a person thinks. Once someone flips that switch, and wants to end their life. They are no longer considering anyone else and i don't mean that in a negative way either. Your father loved you, and before he flipped that switch, he made sure to make sure he protected you enough to make the switch easier on himself, and on you.  

In the coming days you'll have the funeral process to deal with. Just remember to find all the photos and videos you can and learn everything about your father that you didn't know. I found this to be sort of fun and a way to keep him alive.  

When your ready, I suggest starting a journal. I have. Every week I am going to write to my dad. Just a one way letter that can't be responded to. I want to keep our conversations going and I know I have enough of him in my heart and in my head to do it. I suggest the same to you to keep him with you everyday.   


I'm so sorry for your loss. But you're not alone."

college,fdrt8hk,t1_fdrru7q,1578689421.0,"Another issue I find myself is finances. The GI Bill pays most of my bills. Without school, I can't pay rent. I have a job but it's on campus work and I'm limited to 20 hours per week at just above minimum wage. I want to not go to school but i worry about this sort of stuff too. :/"
college,fdrpo54,t1_fdqt6uh,1578687817.0,Would this constitute a full time load? I need to manage full time in order to satisfy my GI Bill. I can't pay my bills wihout the housing allowance it provides

AndroidQuestions,fdq654u,t3_emoc46,1578656556.0,"I've had the Pixel Buds, Airpods, Galaxy Buds and the Sennheiser Momentum true wireless and can easily say Airpods suck. I had them with paired to an iPad too and the ""features"" are minimal. They feel weird, look bad, and sound mediocre for the high cost.  
  
By far my favorites are the Momentums. Hoping the new Pixel Buds coming out change that. I highly recommend the Galaxy Buds as well.  
  
My daily headphones are the Surface Headphones though usually"
legaladvice,fdokdmq,t1_fdofrb4,1578606907.0,"So for things such as a car loan, will his estate have to pay that? He bought a brand new truck that not one of us could afford now. Plus, since it's the scene of a suicide, it's worth far less now. And, it's been sitting on a lot over 800 miles away gathering fees. What can credit card companies do if there's no authorized users on his accounts nor any joint accounts?  
  
I'll probably end up taking a break off school in order to manage all this. I'll find an estate attorney and speak with them. How much does one meeting normally cost? I only have 2 grand of my own to work with and I have to pay my own bills still."
legaladvice,fdoeaw0,t1_fdocqjd,1578603529.0,"I'm a full-time college student so I can't afford and estate attorney at the moment. Hoping to get this going on my own. I know he had a lot of credit card debt, a brand new car payment, and probably more that I am unaware of. Are these debts going to disappear with his death certificate or will someone absorb them? He didn't have much money and had a limited life insurance policy (which may be voided by suicide). The only things we're trying to save our things we would consider heirlooms.  

  Can I file at a courthouse without my step-mother being there or will she have to sign things over to me? I have a storage unit and plan to get his things out, determine what are heirlooms, and sell everything else to fund his estate. Hoping to pay off the funeral at minimum"

Veterans,fc8sijs,t1_fc8hov4,1577541189.0,I've done everything involved with his death thus far. I've had to guide my step mother to do things that I wasn't legally able to. I'm trying to become the only person with power but am trying to find a way to do that. I'm working on talking to her. They were splitting up so I don't think she deserves to manage this part of his life. What kinds of things should I be looking to do?

It will take awhile but I do want it to end with his pain. He suffered enough to leave us without a warning, it should end there. Thank you. I just need a lot of time. I have a hard time being alone because I just think of him constantly. I just need distractions I think. My dogs help a lot."
