Her legs were bowed outwards dramatically due to all of the weight put on them back when she *could* still walk.

That became a joke by a female comedian—something like “isn’t that just like men to come up with a drug to make women forget childbirth so they’re willing get pregnant again?” And the other element is that it’s more common today to stereotype women as being “hormonal”.

TheHandmaidsTale,ff5b4s4,t3_er97ah,1579585854.0,"\> Well in the testaments, Aunt Lydia mentions how on what is Easter in the  rest of the world, nobody is celebrating it in Gilead. She lets the  aunts color eggs they eat for dinner and has a seasonal prayer.

That's not what the book says, It says ""Today was the first full moon after March 21. Elsewhere in the world, lambs are being slaughtered and eaten; Easter eggs, too, are consumed, for reasons having to do with Neolithic fertility goddesses nobody chooses to remember. Here at Ardua Hall we skip the lamb flesh but have kept the eggs. As a special treat I allow them to be dyed: baby pink and baby blue. You have no idea what delight this brings to the Aunts and Supplicants assembled in the Refectory for supper! Our diet is monotonous and a little variation is welcome, even if only a variation in color. After the bowls of pastel eggs had been brought in and admired but before our meagre feast began, I led the usual Prayer of Grace...""

It does not say they do not celebrate Easter--in fact they mark the day with a special observance and feast, using the same date calculations as are used to determine Easter's date. But they appear to call it the Equinox. Her contrast with the rest of the world is related to them not  marking it with the slaughtering of lambs, which, given the comments immediately afterwards about the low quality of their food, and what we know about rationing in Gilead, likely just means they have no lambs for slaughter.

In any case, Atwood has been pretty clear about how in envisioning Gilead, she wanted to incorporate real-life practices around the world and through time that were oppressive to women. She's deliberately vague about what religion is actually practiced in Gilead, likely because that sort of specificity might cause people to interpret the book as being aimed at criticizing one religion or culture, rather than criticizing sexism, misogyny, and patriarchy in a broader sense. She uses plenty of symbols from both the Old and New Testaments, as well as the atheistic Romania of Ceaucescu and modern day fundamentalist religions, including the Islamic revolution in Iran, which happened only a few years before she wrote the book."

Rising progesterone, which begins at ovulation, is what causes the lining to change to prepare for implantation. When your body doesn’t get a signal that you’re pregnant, progesterone production stops, and it’s this progesterone withdrawal that causes menstruation to happen. 

If I had to ELI5 this, I’d say estrogen and progesterone are teammates in a relay race. Estrogen starts the race, then hands to baton to the progesterone, then progesterone hands the baton to hCG, which is a hormone produced by the placenta and the signal that you’re pregnant. If hCG isn’t there to take the baton, progesterone quits the race (menstruation happens) and heads back to starting position to run again in a few weeks"

One of the key characteristics of cancer is that it rapidly divides and spreads throughout the body. Each cancer has areas it has an affinity to, where it’s more likely to spread. So like breast cancer might spread to your bones, destroying them painfully. Or your lungs, destroying them and killing you because you can’t live without lungs. Ovarian cancer typically spreads throughout your abdominal organs and blocks your digestive system so you can’t digest food anymore and you eventually die as a result—you starve to death, basically. 

If you catch cancer early, before it has spread, then chances of long term remission are higher, because you can remove the body part and in doing so, remove the cancer.
