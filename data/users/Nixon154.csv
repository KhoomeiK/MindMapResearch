Blind,ffxb9jw,t3_evl6cz,1580321607.0,"I actually knew that my partner was legally blind and could potentially lose her vision over time before we started dating. 

I settled into the little things that I would have to do such as driving her to appointments when she needed, always looking ahead for obstacles when we were walking together and she wasn't using her cane, making sure that when I move things in the house I place them back where I found them etc... These things have become automatic at this point and I don't really think about them anymore.  Even the two cats we have make sure to meow when they are around her so she knows they are there.

It has always been there in our relationship so I can't really speak to the experience of finding out that they will lose their vision but I know I can speak to what it is like to see how strong she is and how we will get through anything as a team."

No one is denying that dal rends is good but arguing that dal rends is better is fucking dumb"
classicwow,fdkqhr7,t1_fdkjfjl,1578509037.0,"They are saying it's a BIS upgrade over his dal rend swords. And they scale very similarly and use the exact same stat priority. The talent trees are also almost identical other than a few choices like sword spec and taking backstab damage talents. As far as playing differently the only difference is managing energy, sword rogues sinister strike and snd, dagger rogues backstab and snd, they both use evis if they have a surplus of combo points and a long snd duration. Shit even on group fights like luci you do the exact same blade flurry/adrenaline rush cleave. They are really not that different. Switching from viskag to perd is different because they are both BIS in their respective spex."

classicwow,fdk6ktj,t1_fdk69dm,1578497238.0,"1) It's bis for daggers yes. If you aren't using the bis sword then it is stupid to stay using swords. You should switch to daggers and do more DPS. 
3) you missed the point of my statement. Any smart guild will make that decision for the sword rogue because it helps the raid as a whole, you shouldn't sit in a spec when you have the option to do more DPS with daggers. It's all about DPS regardless of spec. Whatever does more is the correct choice."
classicwow,fdk5iqp,t1_fdk5e9g,1578496537.0,"1) it's literally bis until aq and far more DPS than dal rends set.
2) if you give perditions blade to a rogue who already has viskag over a rogue with dal rends then your raid should just disband.
3) rogues have one spec and it's DPS."
classicwow,fdk5c8d,t1_fdk3m6d,1578496419.0,This is exactly how it should be done. Not ms/os if it's a clear upgrade
classicwow,fdk54tw,t1_fdk4uv6,1578496280.0,"You should be going daggers if you don't have viskag, it's better DPS and better for the raid"
classicwow,fdj9qks,t1_fdj9bzp,1578462576.0,Well if you don't have bis swords like viskag then you should be rolling on perd to go daggers. Literally no point in not rolling on a weapon that is bis until aq

classicwow,fdhxr1r,t1_fdhxnk2,1578432078.0,For sure man. Play the game the way you like it. However I do suggest gouging mages to set up ambushes as they can't blink out of them
classicwow,fdhx2jy,t1_fdhwsji,1578431717.0,"Okay well no offense but you really need to check out some tip videos for rogue pvp. You might as well play a different class if you aren't even stunning in PVP. The only class you might be able to 2 shot is a mage that is sitting down, and even then they can just iceblock or blink before the GCD resets and then you are totally screwed. Basically the power of rogue is killing people in stuns. You can CS, Bs, Kidney, Thistle tea, BSx2"
classicwow,fdhv9jt,t1_fdhuh0c,1578430767.0,"This is much better. However I would still pick up 1 points in dirty deeds and take elusiveness. Imp sap is pretty much a mandatory take in competitive pvp so I would still suggest you understand the reason behind it before you completely drop it, I have seen people take 2 points in it but I have never seen a single high level rogue completely drop it. Also I have reworked the assassination tree for you as you want relentless strikes for more energy after you 5 point kidney:

[https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fheboxkZGcZVMjcc0k](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fheboxkZGcZVMjcc0k)

Also your opener entirely depends on the class/spec you are fighting against in a 1v1 situation, group openers can also be totally different. For example: if you are in a WSG and your goal is to cc the back line (healers, ranged dps) as much as possible then you don't want to pop out of stealth right when you sap a priest. If you land that sap it can change the course of the entire group fight. If you do land it without imp sap you will pop out of stealth and will be killed immediately, which totally wastes the effectiveness of your class in a group fight.

1v1's on the other hand can be totally different, you will never open up on a rogue without a stun because you will be immediately blinded and reset on. Same goes for hunters, if you open with anything other than CS or gouge you will be scatter shot and trapped. I usually never open up without a stun unless I am fighting a mage, and even then I will CS with sprint up and bait out the blink. Also keep in mind you can't ambush, bs and immediately blind or gouge without thistle tea. This is why you take atleast 1 point in dirty deeds because you will be able to cs and immediately backstab if you time the energy tick properly. 

One final thought, you can take master of deception as a dagger rogue but I personally don't as I am a human with perception and I also use tiger's eye goggles when I know I am fighting a rogue."
classicwow,fdhoi2q,t1_fdhoejq,1578426983.0,"It provides immunity and prevents any stealth detection. If a human uses perception or a hunter has stealth detection then you need to vanish or else you won't get an opener. Starting a fight getting scatter shot is pretty much gg. Back to the previous point, sap is extremely strong for resetting fights and getting an opener on another rogue, also if someone runs over you in stealth you can sap them without breaking stealth."
classicwow,fdho8s0,t1_fdhnqlu,1578426830.0,"If you are hardly using sap in pvp then I suggest watching some tip videos, also no class is going to detect you that easily except a hunter or a human with perception up. In any case you can pre vanish before your opener"

classicwow,fdhiesp,t3_elb6i8,1578423303.0,"You want elusiveness for the shorter vanish CD and improved sap for sure. As daggers you don't need to take master of deception, just grab some engi goggles or pre vanish for fighting hemo rogues. You also don't need that much hit chance with pvp. Also having one point in dirty deeds is nice. Just either go 21/8/22 or 15/14/22 imp sprint. I personally like cold blood 21/8/22"
