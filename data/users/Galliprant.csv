Then you wonder what happiness is and if you'll ever have it. What would even make me happy? Am I capable of finding love or meaning? Am I worthy of them?

It becomes a terribly tragic pros and cons list, and it breaks my heart that we can feel so meaningless that our life is held to such a low standard.



Dealing with this makes you feel so trapped."
depression,fe6xqci,t3_eo1usb,1578907415.0,I know exactly how you feel. It is a terrifying thought when I think of spending my life like working so long just to fund a life I am not entirely sure is worth living. It really does suck. I'm here if you need anyone to talk to. I really mean that.
depression,fdvi5nq,t1_fdveim8,1578747613.0,"Yeah I think you should just go with a direct approach as soon as you think you can handle it. 

I get that he is going through a hard time, but personally I feel like everyone should get closure. I don't think it would be unfair to bring this up when you're ready.

I definitely feel your pain with the walking on eggshells though. It can be so torturous.

If you ever need anyone to talk to about it I'm always down."
depression,fdvbqxc,t3_en6qhi,1578745776.0,"Have you guys discussed where you two stand?

I feel like there's nothing wrong with messaging him and having a discussion on where you both stand. But try to go about it in a level headed way, because if too many emotions get in the way here, it can get really messy. 


There is a possibility that he will have no desire to try things again. I would keep that in mind and maybe think about what you'd really want to be said beforehand, because it'll be hard to say them in the moment. 

I really know how much that sucks to think about, but you'd be so much better off actually knowing how he feels. Good luck to you."
depression,fdlydec,t3_em2ois,1578535444.0,"Yeah, this is how I have been viewing things for the most part, and it is not an easy thing to accept."
depression,fdd07f4,t3_ekpjfv,1578289698.0,"You don't have to keep going and no one can tell you why it is worth it. Trust me, I've asked that question far too many times. But you should keep going because this will change.

There is also very high chance of you feeling okay in the future okay. Idk your story or age but I can almost guarantee this is a temporary feeling. I know how easy it is to get blinded by these horrid feelings though. 

Please take it slow and look for anything to distract you when you just can't think about anything else. Nothing gets done during those days.

I hope you feel better. I'm here if you ever need to talk."
depression,fdcz65v,t3_ekpens,1578288711.0,"Yeah your mom reminds me a lot of a few of my family members. But I still can't even begin to imagine how shitty that must feel because I haven't ever poured my heart out to them because I am sure I'd get such a similar reaction. 

I'm sorry you gotta deal with that, I can't offer much advice because at some point that kind of stuff just stopped bothering me. I take like everything they say with a grain of salt because it would fuck my self esteem even more if I believed them even slightly. 

But just know you're not alone.

I really hope things get better for you, and I'm always down to talk if you need anyone. Good luck."
depression,fdcyhan,t3_ekpb50,1578288079.0,That really sucks and I'm sorry you have to deal with that. I don't know what to say about your situation but I am here if you ever need to talk.
depression,fdcxl98,t3_ekp26u,1578287297.0,"This is kind of a shot in the dark because I don't know your exact scenario, but I'll tell you this:

I know someone who has described very similar feelings to me. It is a common thing to experience and it is very difficult to figure out.

You have to put yourself first, but you also have to be open and honest to the ones who you leave behind, because they will feel it hard, but that's going to be okay.

If you're anything like my friend, then you probably keep things bottled inside, and it appears to people as strength. This makes you an easy rock for people.

You have to set boundaries and remember that it's your life. You deserve to be happy and you can't save everyone. 

I hope you figure it out. Sorry if that didn't apply at all."
depression,fdcwjxa,t3_ekojxt,1578286394.0,"I have recently started getting into thc carts and have used them almost all the time for the last month. Like you said, it makes me happy and drags me away from how miserable I've felt lately. 

I'm using it as a crutch and I was already very worried about addiction but this kinda stuff terrifies me. 

I researched everything that could go wrong before I took my first hit, but still ended up talking it. 

I don't know how long this will last but you are definitely not crazy. You're just obsessive and it makes sense because this can be a big deal. 

I hope someone can help you, but if you ever need to talk hmu."
depression,fd8el9x,t1_fd8do1f,1578217558.0,"Yeah I'm sorry :( 

Crying happens far too often for me now, especially so if I drink. Everything feels like it's going downhill and no one deserves to feel so alone. I'm always down to talk if you literally ever need something like that."
depression,fd8d6bn,t3_ekawad,1578217114.0,I'm dealing with it but I can't give any tips because honestly I'm still so lost. That's the only way I can seem to explain myself lately. It sucks so much.
bisexual,fbwkhis,t1_fbwkfcw,1577152316.0,It's both really.
