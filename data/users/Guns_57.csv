Grew up in an area that's about 50% Jews, and as such about half my friends are.  One night, I'm going out with my friends who both are Jews, A & B.  B also has the same name as me, and has just returned from Birthright (Trip to Israel for young adult Jews sponsered by local groups).  We make plans to meet up in a popular downtown spot with their friend C, who had just gotten back from the same trip as B.

When we get there, there's now roughly 7 of us, as C is with three girls, one blonde in particular who is gorgeous.  We're on the 2nd floor of this establishment and I begin to make general smalltalk with her, and she's congenial but nothing indicating that there's an opening.  As the bar had a 3 deep line, I opted to excuse myself for the less busy bar the level lower.

I come back and something has clearly transpired.  She's really flirtatious and now wants to know all about me.  Every dumb joke gets ""Borat the first time you saw it"" laughs, my D- dance moves are received as well as Swayze's in Dirty Dancing, and some magnet I must have buried in my hip has triggered hers, as literally she's glued to me.

Things are looking up... until she makes reference to ""my time on Birthright""  I get perplexed, as I've never been anywhere near the Middle East and ask her what she meant.  ""You know, your Birthright trip with C."" As she points over to C I realize that she has mistaken me for my friend B.  I explain this misunderstanding and she is instantly DEVASTATED.  She sadly manages ""Does this mean you're not Jewish?"" to which I reply with a slight smile ""No, but I am circumcised, so that's gotta count for something, right?""
