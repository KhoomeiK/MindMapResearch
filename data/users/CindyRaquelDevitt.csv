offmychest,ffbvyrv,t3_esqwr3,1579784584.0,"Wow, I’m in the same boat with my kid sister, not the exact boat but very similar. I’ve had to make the hardest decision of my life and stopped interfering. Of course my situation is different. I’ve been helping her take care of all of her 3 kids, support her 20 year marriage, give her money whenever! And nothing I do is enough or as she puts it “I have no say in her life.” Yup this is what happens when we facilitate others life there is a huge chance they are and will remain ungrateful. I’ve put more work into me trying to figure out why I put up with it and I’m making progress now. I’m sorry this frenzy of an energy has pulled you in but do you and them a favor, let them figure it out. It’s so freaking sad how some disregard human life, she’s carrying a baby in her womb and upset because she cannot drink wine... do you really think that she’s ready to have a mature conversation about anything?? The worst is the emotional investment on our parts. That is where the attachment and pain come in for us. This shits a work in progress! I wish you the best of luck! And may that baby rise up from everything and grow up to be happy and fulfilled!!"
