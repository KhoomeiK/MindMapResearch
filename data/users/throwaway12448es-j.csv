nyc,ffiwxaw,t1_ffbbqcs,1579984708.0,The clank is so comforting. Makes me feel all warm and cozy.
PubTips,ffh4b9y,t3_etle0d,1579922741.0,"Just skimming this, there are far too many rhetorical questions. Many agents aren’t a fan of any rhetorical questions, to be honest."
writing,ffglrhg,t1_ffg2ew5,1579909180.0,"In what way? I’ve noticed he writes a lot about gay men (although he seems to be gay, so) and the Holocaust, so I’m guessing it’s the latter?"
writing,fffn8c0,t1_ffemusz,1579887597.0,"This is good advice, thanks"
writing,fffn37u,t1_ffeokwb,1579887511.0,"I genuinely wasn’t trying to be rude, just thought it was funny the way your posts came across. Maybe you’re misinterpreting my tone. Thanks for going into my past posts and using them against me, though, gonna go on a deleting spree now."
writing,ffeipzf,t1_ffeina7,1579849635.0,"Does putting it in big text make it more controversial? The fact that it’s huge but *not* in all caps makes me feel like someone is standing right next to me and using a megaphone to state this very loudly, but very calmly, directly in my ear."
NarcissisticAbuse,ffec1x6,t1_ffe7ttc,1579842665.0,Thank you! I was pretty creeped out too lol

StrongCurves,ffdjd0r,t1_ff9wb5k,1579822106.0,"But does scientifically really apply to everyone? My bf never does actual “good” glute work, just squats and deadlifts, and never put a focus on his glutes at all, but his butt is rock hard."
PubTips,ffdbn34,t1_ffdbdp4,1579817411.0,This gave me my first smile today lol
PubTips,ffd09fj,t1_ffcxidm,1579810878.0,"Yeah in some ways it is pretty repellant. Like most things I come up with, unfortunately..."
PubTips,ffcp52b,t1_ffco0yl,1579804219.0,They all seemed to really like it/love it. Especially the later ones
PubTips,ffcm9na,t1_ffclblv,1579802457.0,"It’s around 90K words. As I’ve been seeing from agents’ MSWLs, the flavor of the month seems to be #ownvoices (which I can’t do no matter how hard I try, lol), and fantasy, which I realized I really hate writing."
PubTips,ffclzel,t1_ffckejd,1579802286.0,"Yeah, I had (2016) It ends with us (for the abusive relationship part) and (2019) Infinite Detail (for the dystopian society part). The problem is there aren’t that many books at all similar to mine. And it turns out there is a good reason for that lol"
writing,ffcf6xf,t1_ffblgxx,1579798154.0,"I don’t think you would be condemned. People might not like the protagonist (if this guy is the protagonist), especially if he doesn’t have lots of remorse for his actions later on, but that’s still pretty far from hating *you*.
Then again, you never know. Writers have gotten death threats for being racist after having their books bought by big 5 publishers, (the books were then pulled) so it’s best to play it safe whenever possible and write about rainbows and unicorns. I guess"
antiwork,ffberlt,t1_ffawqjb,1579762154.0,"This reminds me of the time I put up anti-school posters in my high school bathroom. No one knew it was me, but everyone was kind of impressed. Still look back on that and feel proud lol"

PubTips,ff9p81e,t1_ff9oj8w,1579717828.0,Yeah I did and was much happier with my own in the end!
PubTips,ff8ag6z,t3_es5jwd,1579670872.0,"I hired someone from Fiverr. Awful experience, as she charged me $30 but delivered a query full of grammatical mistakes and run-on sentences. I got my $ back though."
writing,ff5hmxo,t1_ff47zf5,1579593283.0,"Your last sentence is so true, I’m getting tired of the amount of books that pluck a modern person and place them squarely in Medieval England/Ancient Rome/Mayan Empire, etc. I’m reading my great-great-aunt’s memoirs right now and she was born only a hundred years ago but the way she thought was clearly very, very different than the way I do. You can find this in old books as well"

You’ll never see this in a published book, but some people don’t read published books, so they don’t know that this is wrong."

AskReddit,fdp5wf7,t1_fdp08qr,1578620736.0,She got published via connections through YouTube. If she didn’t have the big YouTube following those poems would never have seen the light of day ... proof you can write utter drivel and it’ll still find a publisher if you have a big enough fanbase who are guaranteed to buy it. Why yes I am bitter
AskReddit,fdozu43,t1_fdn24hi,1578616655.0,I LOVED agents of Cracked! I watched the whole series like 3 times. I also read all their articles after school. I avoid the website now as it saddens me
NarcissisticAbuse,fdbkr3y,t1_fdbkjoq,1578258299.0,Reading your first 3 sentences gave me a lurch in my stomach because that’s almost word for word what he’s said.
