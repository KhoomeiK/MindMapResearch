dogpictures,fepbyqj,t3_eq7nnz,1579316794.0,I found Grover as a very young pup hiding  behind a garbage can beside my house. I looked for his family for a while afterwards but they never came around and I never found any other dogs in my neighborhood. He had a tough beginning but it’s been a easy life for the last 13 years
dogpictures,fepbdeu,t1_fep2d46,1579316395.0,He is a unknown mixture although his vet has always said he has a lot of Dachshund and Basset Hound characteristics.

tonightsdinner,fe3d1k9,t1_fe1woy7,1578848188.0,The one I had are just frozen fries from the store that I baked per the instructions on the bag but there are several methods for making waffle fries at home. I’ve attached a link of one way here. [how to make waffle fries ](https://www.instructables.com/id/Waffle-Fries/)

tonightsdinner,fe2xdk6,t1_fe009bk,1578843938.0,"This was my mother’s recipe and You can play around with the amounts. I add more cayenne than what is called for and I sometimes add a can of chili beans. 

•1 LB lean ground beef

•12-16 oz tomato sauce (depends on how thick you like)

•1/2 teaspoon minced garlic
 
•1/2 teaspoon minced onion

•1/2 teaspoon cumin

•1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper
 
•1 tablespoon chili powder

•1 tablespoon paprika 

•Salt and pepper to taste

Brown meat and then add everything else and simmer for at least 30 minutes but the longer the better."

Msstate,fdbrfhy,t3_eicg7q,1578260824.0,Hopefully baseball will give us something to look forward to
Msstate,fd042cs,t1_fczo4xg,1578113321.0,The main “issue” people have was JoMo being too friendly with the team and that may be true but that is also what got us a top 25 nationwide recruit class and also it’s not right of Cohen to fire a coach after the early signing period where we signed over 15 players with JoMo and now he’s gone. Those players aren’t getting what they were promised.
Msstate,fczs9pe,t1_fczn8pa,1578107752.0,If neither of those things had happened Joe Moorhead would be happily starting his third year as head coach and MSU wouldn’t be paying a 7+million buyout
Msstate,fczhfcb,t3_ejpcsv,1578101321.0,I was on the fence about the firing but after reading this article I agree he deserved at least one more year
Msstate,fcys4oi,t3_ejgs7z,1578085904.0,"Dave Clawson is currently getting around 2.2 million at Wake Forest so I doubt he’s a contender. 

It seems like Billy Napier will be taking over though and he is getting around 875k at ULL so he would be a bargain."
