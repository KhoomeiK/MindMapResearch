cordcutters,fet4187,t1_feo5v1g,1579371627.0,The Netflix strategy for streaming is to try to retain subscriptions but drive people away from actually browsing content or watching things. This way they make money but don't have to pay for bandwidth or licensing.

howto,fehqn8a,t1_fehdvbx,1579121937.0,"> A lot of time it is the spring inside the pull that breaks

There's no spring inside a zipper pull. It's just a shaped piece of metal that has a bar down the middle and is wider at the top than the bottom. When the pull moves over the zipper the bottom of the pull forces the zipper tabs together."

So pull the zipper pull up so that it zips, then pull it back down? How does that help?"

Nothing new to see here. TiVo (the DVR) and Apple TV have been doing this for ages. What I want is for the streaming apps to go away entirely. Streaming services should just provide content, not apps. I want to have the same UI and user experience playing content from Prime as I do from Hulu or Netflix or wherever I am subscribed. I'm sick and tired of apps that don't even know that the enter button is not the play button and when I'm done watching I want to hit back once, not 15 times to get the show to end."

cordcutters,fcvo0n0,t3_ej21px,1578006237.0,"Am I the only one that finds these kind of lists useless? Give me a nice table with things sorted alphabetically (except when there is a series of movies, keep them grouped together in order). Add a column for the service it will be on and another column for the date. And also indicate if something is a TV show or a movie.

Having to scroll down a long list like this takes too long and is just a mess. No I don't want to Apple-F for something because by looking at everything I might see something I've totally forgotten about."
