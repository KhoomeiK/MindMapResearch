SuicideWatch,fgcwn03,t1_fgc5rds,1580676911.0,"i hate to see this kind of comments man, i feel like a part of me goes missing whenever i think that the person that left these comments is gonna commit suicide."
Brawlstars,fg7xxi5,t1_fg7wr0q,1580604318.0,"First, mortis is definetely not the worst brawler for the mode, imo the bb suits him the best.
Secondly, i would still post this if it was any other brawlers like 3 Franks etc.
Third, i guess it is compeletly clear that i am not complaining about the players in my team that they picked mortis, but about supercell that caused this situation.

I hope that you are not an asshole like this all thw time and I really hope that it was just a bad day for you and it will get better and i also would hate to see a reply of yours pointing out to the grammar mistakes i made. Fuck off."
