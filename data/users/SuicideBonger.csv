----

I have played Battlefield since BF1942, and I have studied World War 2 since I was 5 years old. I majored in Economics at UCLA with a minor in German Studies, with a heavy focus on the Second World War. To call me “uneducated” because I want a reasonablly authentic game is completely uncalled for. Women DID NOT serve for the Wehrmacht or the Waffen SS. I am by no means a sexist, but any quick search online of female roles during the Third Reich will reveal that Hitler’s ambition for women was to reproduce as many children as possible, in order to create more “Aryan” people and keep the German military full of new soldiers. Having women on the frontlines was the LAST thing that Hitler and the Nazis wanted. You know what Patrick, maybe YOU are uneducated. Maybe you should do some research on WW2 and realize that the game you are creating is a joke. I call on all of you, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. We as a community should not be subjected to comments from EA degrading us as uneducated bigots, simply for wanting a game that feels like a World War 2 shooter. Disgusted.

EDIT: But wait, there's more!

Yes, as many people have pointed out, I did lie about my background in this post. Please do not upvote. This post was an attempt to put pressure on EA and raise awareness to this issue. As those familiar with the Battlefront 2 subreddit will remember, significant pressure by the subreddit resulted in an EA Rep talking with the Reddit community about microtransactions. This communication resulted in heavy backlash on EA, and allowed for the company to temporarily disable microtransactions and mitigate the pay to win elements of the game. Unlike many people here have said, I do not believe Reddit is insignificant, and I do not believe that those who want a degree of historic authenticity are an extremely small minority. I believe if enough pressure is put on DICE and EA, they will create a setting that disables customization and allows for player models that look similar to Battlefield 1 (different silhouettes for each class, somewhat proper uniforms for each faction, correct helmets). I honestly believe that no one wants to take away someone's ability to choose what gender and race their soldier is. However, I also believe that this shouldn't take away someone's ability to choose to play the most accurate representation of World War 2 that the game offers. More choice is a good thing, and to want a historically presentable viewing experience should not be seen as ""uneducated."""
FragileWhiteRedditor,fdyegrz,t1_fdwz6so,1578778880.0,I agree with what you're saying. Good thing Evita is well-known to be incredibly historically inaccurate.
