For the most part a lot of my brother’s cases are murders, but he also isn’t in a super populated town either, he’s in a town that has a high crime and high poverty level.

ABoringDystopia,felfxz4,t1_fel777g,1579221251.0,"Well, I mean, we’re all in the money making business. I’d also argue that judges and prosecutors aren’t as corrupt as you think they are. Prosecutors don’t get paid more based on how many convictions they get. My brother is a prosecutor, however, he only deals with felonies, so I’m not sure how it works for misdemeanors. It really gets to him when someone gets away with a crime that they did commit. For instance he had a rape case where the victim was not trusted due to being mentally handicapped. It really messed him up when that guy got off because he really believes that the woman he rapes is going to be murdered. 

Judges and juries can 100% be bought and corrupted, but no one really tries to pay off prosecutors."
