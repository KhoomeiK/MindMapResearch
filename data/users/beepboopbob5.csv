TrueCrime,femuyne,t3_epyjjv,1579270300.0,Jesus. Imagine having to find that. What the fuck goes through these peoples minds....
TrueCrimeDiscussion,femuot9,t1_femhw1t,1579270091.0,"So, I know you told me to avoid the video but I found it and skipped through. He was definitely moving a lot at the start but it looked like movements made while sleeping. When luka actually attacks him he doesnt seem to move around at all, which I find strange because he had previously been moving quite a bit. 

My guess is he was unconscious completely at that point. Maybe shock or a really high dosage of sedatives. 

Because of the cartel videos I suppose the stabbing didnt shock me too badly, but jesus christ the dismembering and the dog... yeah. Wish I hadnt seen that part. It's just so disrespectful to that poor man and his family/friends...Although some of it seemed familiar so I'm assuming I had seen it years ago and just blocked it out. 

Also yes, in hindsight it's easy to see how all of his videos were connected through a power trip. They all involve defenceless beings being tortured, as you said. 

I actually think I *couldnt* watch the bathtub cat one. I assume it's my own fear of drowning. I feel like that one was one of the most cruel. 

And yes please avoid the cartel ones. I wont go into detail, but the noise people make when they have blood in their throat is... worse than the vacuum, which is already horrifying and anxiety inducing."

If not, say you want to shave your armpits or something and ask for some money to buy shaving foam and razors. If they ask why say its itchy. 

I just assumed everyone owned razors and shaving foam, sorry lol."
TooAfraidToAsk,felg7x3,t3_epsj5z,1579221438.0,"Well I'm a girl so the answer is slightly different, but first probably do it in the shower with a good quality razor, along with shaving foam. Also use a mirror if you cant see places."
Anxiety,felfd49,t1_fekns4o,1579220859.0,Thank you!
TrueCrimeDiscussion,feknsnk,t1_fejvm40,1579203904.0,"Hmm. I wonder if it's like how when we die sometimes our legs or arms move and we poop/pee. I'm really really hoping that's all it was from him. But as you said, luka was a sick bastard. I remember seeing the cat video accidentally and I felt like I couldn't breathe. It was so horrifying.

As for you mentioning the cartel videos, I think one time I watched a video of a guy having his neck cut with an axe (I almost threw up) and I think that was cartel related. 

I actually think that YEARS ago I saw the ice pick video, or I heard it being mentioned/saw images. My brain maybe blocked it out. I definitely remember the name, and I saw the snake one in the papers. 

However I didnt know until the documentary that all these attacks were connected."
