There's more than one kind of socialism."
politics,fgv3sg4,t1_fgv3a2y,1581136315.0,"And to answer your second question, no. It's simply a label applied to the pseudo-socialist policies enacted by modern democratic governments. Socialism is arguably *more* democratic by nature than capitalism because it actively enforces equality and egalitarianism."
politics,fgv3n22,t1_fgv3gu8,1581136194.0,"Communism is a form of socialism where all property is publicly owned. 

The difference is that under most capitalist societies, the state provides legal means (police, civil lawsuits) for the protection of private property rights. Socialism either does not have these mechanisms or (as with Communism) actively enforces state ownership of all property.

There are also market and non-market forms of socialism. Communism is a non-market form and abolishes the creation and use of capital."

SandersForPresident,fgu7i42,t1_fgtym97,1581114420.0,They seriously *have* to have Larry David show up as Bernie at least once during an official event. I will be so disappointed if this doesn't happen.
politics,fgu47ip,t1_fgu35dk,1581113138.0,"It's the classic scapegoat strategy: blame what's wrong with the country on the stereotypes that hit all the emotional buttons, like immigrants, ""welfare queens"" (who are always black), the gays, women, etc, and ignore the real problem-makers: rich white capitalists. 
You have to make them understand that they've been manipulated and lied to. The ""how"" is the tricky part."
politics,fgu07bk,t1_fgtvk6e,1581111646.0,"All he needs to educate them on is how his policies will benefit the working class, honestly. 

""Socialism"" is such a four-letter word in the US that it would only be worse for his campaign if he said it. Many US voters completely agree with social democratic policies...as long as they're not called socialist. 

Look at how their advertising is already. You don't see ""socialism"" anywhere. All you see is a focus on policies that benefit citizens."

TheRightCantMeme,fgspgxo,t1_fgsp3fv,1581089846.0,"The enlightened centrists put disclaimers too. That's kind of their thing. 

""I'm a centrist but Trump is our President and we need to respect him"" as an example.

There are plenty of literal Nazis saying they're ""centrists"" as well, so the assumption that it's simply bad-faith manipulation is based on that.

My advice would be to word things differently."
TheRightCantMeme,fgsoayh,t1_fgsmhti,1581089111.0,"It was the way you worded that comment, not what you actually meant, that brought the downvotes. The phrasing was way too similar to that of every ""enlightened centrist""."
