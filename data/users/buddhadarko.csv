introvert,fdmutc2,t1_fdmnvh2,1578566832.0,Same. I have tried so hard to make that connection but it just doesn't happen. End up getting talked over all the time or seemingly forgotten about.

introvert,fdik4de,t3_elfv8l,1578444694.0,"The fact that you have an inner world that NO ONE else can penetrate or even begin to understand is amazing by itself. It's like a cocoon. Studying others comes natural and it's not done to be creepy, but to understand others better than they do themselves. 

Introversion is unique in many ways. I spent many years trying to not be introverted but have only recently fully embraced it."

PublicFreakout,fcsmlgo,t1_fcsgxd3,1577919773.0,Absolutely. It's horrible to see humans treat other humans the way they do. But I think that's a by-product of some agendas. They are amoral.
PublicFreakout,fcsgsjw,t1_fcrt010,1577916311.0,"What I am trying to figure out is why people are acting like these things are shocking. Given the high tension and extreme chance for violence, it seems like the cops using excessive force is expected at this point."

Botchedsurgeries,fcnc4ki,t1_fcn44wm,1577808497.0,I never knew that but it makes sense. Always wondered why she made such drastic changes to her face. I thought she was very cute and pretty before the surgeries. I stared at that Hardcore album art so much.

NipseyHussle,fby0ccp,t3_ef2yod,1577205034.0,"Good post and what a great video. 

OG makes a lot of good points and I enjoyed listening to him speak on Nipsey and gang culture and how deep it is. Nipsey was and still is respected. I listened to him way before he was killed and the amount of love he got only increased with time. It's like 10 fold now. 

Whatever is going on with Wack, I think Nipsey would just let it fizzle out in its own. Not worth his time so why should true fans and followers of Nip care about what Wack thinks?"
