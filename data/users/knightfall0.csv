For those unfamiliar with the program, I do barbell squats twice a week, one day is 5x3(heavy) and other is 3x10(light). T3 exercises are accessory lifts done for 3x15.

So I'm confused as to what accessories to add. I'm already doing Bulgarian split squats once a week, so I have three options. 

1) front squats

2) Goblet squats

3) hack squats (machine) 

Which one would make the most sense? Are there any pros or cons to each?"

If you're worried about scaring her off, ease into it. Try telling her how you feel without explicitly saying you ""love"" her. See how she reacts.

When I had my first ""failure"" I was embarrassed beyond reason. I felt like a failure. It took me a while to get my confidence back up, even though I had nothing wrong with me and it was perfectly normal to not get hard sometimes. One you realize you can't get it up, you get anxious, and that makes it even more difficult. It's a vicious cycle. 

That said, your boyfriend is on medication. He has legitimate reasons to lose libido. Don't get disheartened by this. You should realize that this is a difficult time for him, and he's trying his best to not make you feel dissatisfied by making sure he goes down on you. I understand your perspective where you want to please him, but that won't happen if he feels pressured to perform. 

The best approach is to not directly address the issue, because that will make him more anxious. Try other methods. If he's overweight, you two can consider going to a gym (if time permits) since working out gives a testosterone Spike and helps with libido. Or maybe try not stimulating him as often, which will build up his urges significantly(usually 2-3 days for a normal healthy man).

This took me 30 seconds to find. Agents who recruit workers from other countries trap poor needy people with false promises and send them to UAE.

>Fraudulent agents at any level of the chain take money, sometimes lakhs of rupees in cash, from the candidates and the employers both. “They justify the sum saying that they have to pay the middle man, foreign embassy, foreign employer and also to agencies to arrange a job,”

So they find poor people, take money from them, promising better jobs and payback.

> Another common strand in stories of most exploited migrant workers is that they are given their documents (visa and passport) at the last minute, which are then immediately taken away by the employer once they reach the destination country. This effectively stops them from one, inspecting if the visa being given to them is for the same work as promised by the agent, and two, leaving the Gulf country if they want.

Then they don't allow them to leave. Once they arrive, their passports and visas are taken away and the agents demand a huge sum of money as payment if the worker wants to leave (which is impossible for a poor person to pay especially in a whole new country) 

So.. exploiting people with false promises and then not allowing them to leave. Hmm. But wait there's more. 

>Under the Kafala system a migrant worker’s immigration status is legally bound to an individual employer or sponsor (kafeel) for their contract period. The migrant worker cannot enter the country, transfer employment nor leave the country for any reason without first obtaining explicit written permission from the kafeel.

Yeah she said obese, which is worse, but the reason why a lot of people shy away from diets and exercise is because of the drastic lifestyle change. Starting small with just trying to exercise more often and eating a balanced diet is already better than what most people do today."

Fitness,femw7ws,t3_epyh1r,1579271232.0,"I've been following Greyskull LP (phrak's variant) for about 3.5 months now. I made decent progress I think, but I was not satisfied with the volume. So after about a month of doing it, I added some accessories to increase the volume. So far it's working well, and I actually like the routine I have. It takes me about 1.5 hours to complete it. But I haven't considered any imbalances or redundancies that the routine might have since I don't have the necessary knowledge to asses it myself..

Here's the routine:

Workout A:

* Bench Press 

* Barbell Row

* Deadlift

* Cable crossovers (upper and lower chest)

* Bulgarian split squats

* Skull crushers

* Straight arm pull down

* Dumbbell curl (2x10 heavy, 1x15-20 light)

* Facepulls


Workout B:

* OHP

* Chinups

* Squats

* Close grip bench press

* Hack squats (1x15-20)

* Lateral Dumbbell raise

* Shrugs

* Cable Rope pushdowns 

* Dumbbell curl (2x10 heavy, 1x15-20 light)

* Facepulls

The first three exercises are (2x5,1x5+) and all others are 2x10 unless specified. The only change I've made to the original workout is I do deadlifts for 3 sets instead of 1.

So are their any problems with this setup? Is there some form of redundancy, potential imbalance or maybe bad structuring? 

I appreciate all the help!"

AskReddit,femuxc4,t3_eq0rzs,1579270271.0,"I've only done it 5, maybe 6 times. I always have this mentality that when I'm doing drugs, I'm only doing it for fun. I'm not looking for some profound experience, not trying to deal with pain or any other reason. That way I don't get dependant on them.

However acid was different. I went in with the same mentality, but everytime I did it, it was usually when something in my life was not going okay. The first time I did it, I tripped alone. I had a problem with procrastination and finding motivation to study. I sat there, alone and thinking. It changed my outlook towards work and studies for some reason.

Same thing happened this other time when I my relationship was on shaky ground. Me and my girlfriend tripped together. It wasn't like we had too many fights, but I could feel the spark dying out. That night, I felt like I was seeing my girlfriend for the first time. She was so beautiful. I almost cried because of how amazing she looked. That trip saved my relationship.

In general, I feel like I've become more empathetic, and open minded. It's hard to explain, but you really start thinking about life in a different way."
