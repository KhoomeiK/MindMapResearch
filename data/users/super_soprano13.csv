Your statement is misogynistic as fuck and is full of erasure of populations of folks that participate in drag as the art of non-conformist, gender fucked performance art. Women portraying an exaggerated ideal of femininity or masculinity or anything in between is STILL fucking drag. 

Don't like it? Take it up with those who started the art, which, for the record, included fucking bioqueens."
rupaulsdragrace,ffefeeu,t1_ffe6jfh,1579845923.0,"you clearly haven't seen some of the bioqueens on the internet. We can transform just as effectively as men. Exaggerated shapes and makeup and more. Same entertainment value in lipsync or live singing.

As a genderqueer/nonbinary AFAB person I think the worlds is missing out on another view of art.

As for saying drag started purely with men in wigs, I think you need to revisit that statement. There have been bioqueens as long as there have been drag queens."

MakeupRehab,ff736l2,t3_eru12a,1579640202.0,"I reuse boxes that I have for storing brushes and like right now where I have a larger quantity for my project pan. I have a little three compartment basket where I'll switch the makeup to when I pare down what there is to pan.

My closet has a little mini shelf area where I keep my regular rotation skincare other than face wash (My bathroom doesn't have much counter or cabinet space) I also keep 4 sterilite small 5 drawer things that have all my other makeup and small skin care in. Still figuring out where to put my haircare/body care stuff I don't have a consistent routine for either. 

I put my larger palettes between these little sterilite things, and leave masks and lashes on top, so when I really want them I don't have to search for them bc I'm usually prepping for a special occasion if I want to do those.

I also keep jars and small pots to mix ends of oils or foundations that are the wrong color etc."

I only smoke if it's with someone else and I'm just trying to shut my brain up enough to fully relax, which is a rare occurrence.

As for shades, my countoury shade I use the balm anti orange bronzer in 9liver, for blush I have a few faves, the one that is always in my bag is lottie London ""zayn"" it's a super pigmented mat cool toned pink. It's a little dark so I just am really careful. I also like the wet n wild ombre blush in the princess daiquiries I have a doucce blush that someone gave me out of a glossy box that idk what shade it is but it's a gorgeous peachy tone. I have a iredale mineral cosmetics blush in ""bronzer "" lol and looking at it under many light forms I could probably use it as contour. Pixie beauty blush duo in peach honey(this one has shimmer to it, it was a fave and it shattered D:) elf cream blush in soft rose (I love this on dewy skin days. Which who am I kidding, that's every day for me) and if I want to be lazy and highlight and blush in one I use the two darker shades in wet n wild illuminating palette in catwalk pink.

For highlighters, I have more than I can count. If you're looking for a specific tone, let me know. It's one of those moments where it pays to be pale because literally any lighter highlight works. I have your standard champagne to gold to green, blue, purple, yellow, pink. I love using highlight to play with color. Bronzer I pretty much use two. In winter when I'm palest I use elf blush duo in st. Lucia and I just swirl both colors. The actual blush is peachy and for me it calms down the bronzer that's a little too deep. In summer when I'm more freckly and fake people into thinking I'm more tan I use the Pacifica coconut infused blush duo in beaming and tenderheart. One is a pretty kind of darker mauve and the other is a warm toned softer brown. I swirl them together again with more of the browner shade, the mauve just makes sure it's cool enough for my undertone.

With bronzer and contour especially make sure to tap off excess. There's a pro mua on youtube Robert Welsh that has a really great tutorial on highlight and contour that's helpful about placement. I also find if I do too much I can take a powder brush with barely any product and kinda buff it out. For highlight even after I apply with a brush, even if it's perfect I tap it in with my middle finger or ring finger to just help it really diffuse. I find that it makes it less like BAM highlight and then if I want more I get a eyeshadow blender brush and make just the highest part of my cheekbones blind. Keeps it from getting weird and gray/dull/muddy

Also! if you wiggle the wand gently back and forth (side to side) at the root of your lashes and THEN pull through it helps to separate. My lashes like to clump and this is always my trick to making sure they don't. I do it with any mascara I use :)"
sugarfreemua,fds4n40,t3_emeakg,1578694254.0,it may be that you're starting your blending too high. make sure it starts in the crease. I would also suggest making sure that you're using a different brush for each color AND a clean blender to blend together.
sugarfreemua,fds4h68,t3_el7i8r,1578694149.0,"As a naturally freckle faced human, I think this is pretty good start, you've done well with different sizes which is how they appear naturally. I have a couple suggestions that are just from looking at my own face. 

1) make sure whatever product you're using has the same undertone as your skin. IE If you're warm/golden use a golden toned brown, if you're cool use a more taupe based color, neutral can kinda do either, but I'd lean more cool.

2) you could put more higher on your cheek bones, think about where the sun hits, which is generally where you place highlighter, I have a pretty heavy concentration of freckles from my cheekbones up to right under and over my brow bone, most concentrated right over the highest part of my brow all the way into my hair line and all over my forehead (I see you've done some, you could do more ;) ) Also up on the nose between my brows I have some! you could do a few more on the actual bridge of your nose on the top too, same concept

3)I generally do have freckles on my chin and jawline (again, where the sun hits) but not on my upper lip (it's shaded by the nose, so I don't get many there)

4) because freckled humans tend to have a little more flush, if you pop a little wash of a light blush that's similar to your undertone (so peach for peach and probably warm, mauve/rose for cool undertones and somewhere between for neutral) wherever you put the freckles, even on your nose and forehead. 

For others checking this out the EXCEPTION to the color rule for the freckles is for redheads (natural or otherwise could do this) they tend to be a more red toned brown, sometimes even flat out red depending on the person. My step-mom is a freckly redhead and she has the almost red freckles, but they're a cool toned red"
sugarfreemua,fds0krz,t1_fdktaj2,1578692432.0,"1000% this. The only thing I'd add is that with this eyeshape (I have this kind of lid but my eyes are more round) that you can pull off slightly more blown out shadow both top and bottom. It gives us lots of options for playing with color, the trick is to really start in the crease, not above and blow it out well. I know fully hooded eyes and mono lids are totally different, but bc the hood on your lid isn't huge you can still start IN the crease and then just use that fluffy brush (I use the fluffy side of the brush that came with my Jackie aina palette, after washing it's legit one of the softest brushes I own) to blend the crap out of your lighter crease color and then use a smaller, more precise blended (my faves are the luxie 243 precision blending, which is pointed, and the luxie 121 mini tapered which is a little fluffier) and then also have a clean fluffy blender handy to go back and forth and then blend together. I most frequently use either an ecotools blender (doesn't have a number, it's just a fluffy blender) or a morphe m441.

Sometimes I use a fluffy shader to work in the crease too. As for lashes, everyday falsies you could do some wispies or demi wispies. more dramatic I like shapes like the flutter lashes loveable.

sugarfreemua,fdry5hn,t3_emvi54,1578691421.0,"To start, your base look flawless (I assume you're wearing one? maybe not) and well matched which can be the hardest part to get right (I'm constantly like ""ugh this foundation too dark/light/pink/yellow/orange"" so the struggle is real)

I would avoid downturned brows with really long tail, it tends to pull the eyes down into a permanently saddened look, I'd also tap out the front to prevent them from being too sharply squared off. I literally just tap with my ring or middle finger to warm and bend out just a little.

For my tastes, and being a fellow pale person, you could do more blush, just to add a little more color back post foundation. If you're feeling spicy, maybe a little bronzer(I don't always just bc it can be overwhelming if not blended right, it takes me a long time to blend it in well, regardless of color bc of my cool undertones)

my only other thing that I'd say is as you do have a deep crease that can cover shadow (same tho) you could blend your shadow up slightly to show it more. not TOO high, but just start in the crease and blend blend blend until you think it's good and then blend some more. It'll give you more options with shape and shade."

He did it if you asked him to do anything he didn't want to, and it only got worse if you insisted and then called his parents when he didn't. My admin wouldn't do.anything until the para started filming it. I couldn't bc I had 34 other children to focus on.

Chances are they just want to see if there is a real reason to worry if other than that the med balance is good.
