HDMI 2.1 apparently has a new standard of cable to support it, but it's where I think the ""lol"" came from, from thinking it also wouldn't need a new cable, as long as it complied with previous high-speed standards (correct me if I'm wrong on any of those things)."

Personally, I have a feeding window of about 5-6 hours everyday, and spend the rest of the day only ingesting non-caloric stuff (usually water and coffee, with the latter being a common big helper in ignoring hunger).

As someone who started playing as soon as the game came out of beta, I have seen the game devolve into a worse and worse mechanical ""plays"" machine, with some designs along the way being so unbearably unbalanced that it really puts into question if ""200+ collective years"" is at all a trustworthy metric, as the game was always a broken mess in some aspect, and it seems to keep getting worse with every patch.

riskofrain,fciwvyb,t3_eh7gyl,1577671756.0,"Agreed. I think sometimes people get confused over a pair of concepts:  


1- Most games offer several different options for you to experience them. Difficulty, visual and accessibility settings, playstyles, etc. None of them are a wrong way to play the game, and it's nice when games have a lot of different manners in which people can get in touch with what they have to offer. This is in stark contrast to...  


2- People who willingly go out of their way to play the game exactly to the way THEY want to play, and not the ways the game is laying out to them, thus complaining about how the game is not fun, or poorly designed, and so on. Games like Dark Souls, Death Stranding and the like come to mind, but several others can have players who act like that.   


To me, the second concept is not an interesting way to approach games. They all have rules and you're supposed to follow them. If you manage to successfully break them, great! But don't complain the game is bad if all you do is try to avoid the experience it wants to provide, or keep implying the people who do get the rules and play by them and are having fun with the game are somehow faking it, being pretentious or ""just like suffering"". I'd wager many people agree with this, since no one likes a person who keeps on talking trash about a game they couldn't get into, even though the game does have objectively good concepts and the person complaining didn't put any effort into playing it remotely how it was intended to be played.  


My point with all this is that it seems that some assume that those who, for instance, prefer to play on lower difficulties, are somehow ""playing the game wrong"", even if they're having a blast by playing that way. They're not people forcibly trying to play a way that wasn't intended by the devs, quite the opposite in fact! So if they're having fun, why would these elitists think they have a say in how these people should play the game to ""really enjoy it""? If they're comfortable enough with the game and their skill level, they can attempt to play on Monsoon whenever the hell they want, if ever."
AskReddit,fciu31h,t1_fcisxg2,1577669831.0,"I don't partake in aromatherapy. Some people do and they see benefit from it. Regardless, it's not about the practice itself, it's about how you're overexaggerating the harm that vaporized plants will bring you. Smoking, on the other hand, burns the weed way beyond the point where it releases its high-inducing vapours, which also introduces harmful toxins. And there's a strong point to be made there, indeed, but several smoking apparatus have systems that allow for a better filtering of the smoke, with a good vaporizer being the ultimate goal for those looking for an almost harm-free way to smoke weed.

Your lungs are not a clean-air absorbing machine. They, much like several other parts of your body, are good at absorbing things in general. It does not mean at all that other substances are just as good as what's ideal for humans, but it also doesn't mean that it will ruin your organs just by merely coming into contact with it, especially when you do it in moderation. So yes, you can have benefits from inhaling certain vapours, even if they are just ""psychological"", as those generally tend to spill over several other physical aspects of one's body. High amounts of stress and anxiety, for instance, can really fuck up the health of one's digestive tract. 

I don't see why you're arguing so heavily against rather safe ways to consume something that allow people to feel good not only mentally, but also physically, as several patients have replaced dangerous opioids for CBD oils, while there are so many other much more destructive substances, foods and medicines that people take without caring about the consequences."

A bunch of the things you said have the science to back it up, and are some of the risks involved with heavy use, which people should be aware of, regardless of how minor they may be compared to not only the positive aspects of weed itself, but also the negatives other substances have (cigarette and alcohol come to mind, especially).

AskReddit,fciqgsc,t1_fcipkf5,1577667384.0,"Yeah dude, but the point is that you're blowing this way out of proportion.

Anyone is capable of getting to a point where an activity they enjoy becomes harmful because they lack moderation. Does that mean the activity itself is addictive? Yeah, you could say that, but then it just invalidates saying something is addictive as anything that gives any sort of pleasure to the individual can potentially be addictive. It's not at all comparable to the kind of life-ruining addiction heroin or meth, to name a few examples, can (and most likely will) cause.

Sure, weed is addictive, I'll play it your way. In turn, you gonna admit that literally anything anyone can enjoy doing has the potential to be ""VERY"" addictive and ruin one's life. Sound fair? I hope not."

Also, ""That kind"" of vaping does introduce stuff that isn't air into the lungs, but in a much more benefit-focused manner.

It's pretty obvious animals are not going to stop being used by humans any time soon, regardless of how many people decide to adopt a vegan lifestyle. So why not stop assuming people aren't aware of the potential cruelty and stop thinking showing gory videos of animals suffering the most extreme kinds of abuse will change anyone's mind, and instead show a little bit more of thoughfulness and present alternatives to the current methods of farming? Free range eggs are becoming more and more popular around here, and I myself started taking part in purchasing them instead of the regularly produced ones. They're even cheaper!   


It's not about whether consuming animal products is cruel or not, it's just EXTREMELY convenient for the huge majority of the population to consume them, and that trumps caring about any potential cruelty. Show people a more humane and compassionate method of dealing with obtaining animal products, while keeping the conveniency almost as high if not as high, and people will change their minds that much more quickly, I assure you.

Drugs,fc6liey,t3_eg62nu,1577483403.0,"You put forward good points, and I'm inclined to agree with all of them, but I'd like to share my views:  


Having ALL drugs be legal would not be ideal, imo. Each drug has different attributes and can lead to different kinds of issues. Some make you do stupid shit and that impacts society more, some are more ""introspective"" and are used for personal escapism and may lead to an overdose, some have important medicinal uses while others just fuck you up. My point is that ""drugs"" is too broad, and each substance should be either decriminalized or properly legalized and regulated depending on where and how they impact the society as a whole.  


In an ideal world, I'd like to see some of the most life-wrecking drugs decriminalized, while other, safer recreational drugs could be fully legalized and regulated. In both cases there would have to be a BIG focus on educating the people on how each substance works and why some have been decriminalized while others were fully legalized. Not only that, but for either case I'd like to not have to worry about going to jail if I choose to grow my own whatever in my backyard for personal use. Selling could be forbidden for some/most of the substances, if not all of them, but if I wish to grow anything for use in my own household, that's a right I should have.  


I don't necessarily think decriminalizing is the ""pussy option"", to be honest. I'd really like the stigma around DRUGS as a whole to die out. Each substance works differently on each person, and even though we categorize them as the same, which is practical and useful, I disagree that just because it's useful to fully legalize and regulate one of them, that it's ideal to do that to all of them. But to make it clear: I'm 100% for at least the decriminalization of EVERY drug, as sending people to jail for using a substance on their own body is just plain ridiculous and absolutely against free will and ethics. It gets even worse when you consider that some people become addicted because they feel they've no other choice, and still have to deal with the looming fear of going to jail and the social rejection that comes with it, which in turn results in them getting no support whatsoever from anybody, further encouraging drug abuse."

I don't mean to sound arrogant, but if you're not being able to save for what is the current standard in monitors nowadays, soon to be surpassed by 1440p/4k, you probably have bigger things to worry about.  


In case you are supported by your parents, well... there's not point in complaining about what you can or cannot afford."
DotA2,fc4l792,t3_eg4a3u,1577419936.0,"THE WORD HE SAID WAS ""FAGGOT"" APPARENTLY GUYS. Honestly, quit beating around the bush when it comes to saying ""the word"" as if it were some forbidden enchantment.   


Was it bad? Sure was, but please stop dodging saying the word like that. You won't get banned for saying what he said, especially out of context like this. Acting like it's something no one should ever say drags people away from improvement, imo. Normalize the non-usage of the word, instead of making a big deal out of saying it, else you KNOW some people will be tempted to ""break the rule"", as they do on the internet, and keep finding ways to le troll by saying it in improper situations/contexts.  


He probably meant no actual harm when he said it, but it's up to him to realize the impact his words may have and change his habits. In the context I could understand from people's reports on this, he said it in a clearly demeaning way, and should deal with the consequences. Whether that consequence should be a full-blown ban is something I think is arguable, but depending on how recurring it is, I'd say it's a fair punishment."

People can argue all they want against any individual being able to do whatever without being tracked, but rapists, pedophiles, drug abuse and so on will still exist regardless of having such a privacy-focused system in place or not. It's like saying cars are not viable because accidents can happen. It's not the car's fault, it's reckless driving, improper roads and signs, etc, and those should be addressed individually, not be a reason for the system not to be implemented."
