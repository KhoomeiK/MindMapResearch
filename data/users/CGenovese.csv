todayilearned,fdewe1d,t3_ekxqiy,1578347990.0,"That's brilliant. I read about this same con man selling the Eiffel Tower to someone once. At the last minute the mark felt suspicious and so Victor asked for a bribe to guarantee the deal, on top of the original price. The mark felt like this explained his odd behavior, paid him the bribe and the original price, and never heard from him again."

AskReddit,fcvpgnu,t3_eixc75,1578007147.0,"I went on one Tinder date with a cute girl in the military. We seemed to really connect and laughed a lot in chatting and over the phone but when I met her in person she had a completely flat affect, I felt like I was talking to robot. Practically no personality and nothing to say. The only time she came alive was when I said my father was a psychopath. I knew then it wasn't going anywhere. She texted to say it wasn't working and I was relieved."

AskReddit,fc5simb,t3_ega9qc,1577464888.0,"Phones: Put your ringer on silent, make a playlist or pick an album, get some bluetooth headphones, and keep your phone in your pocket. Don't take it out until you're done your workout. Phones are drugs and a distraction, they waste your time and nothing makes me more annoyed than waiting for someone to get off a machine because they're just sitting there checking email or searching for ""the right song.""

Hygiene: Spray and wipe down the machines after use, even if you didn't cover them in sweat, even if you used a towel as a barrier. I've gotten ringworm twice at the gym because people don't clean machines. You might want to wipe them down before too.

Proximity: Give equipment you're not using a wide berth. Don't block access with your body or position your bench too close to anything people might need to use. Lifting dumbbells and barbells can be dangerous so it's unhelpful/distracting/risky when people move within arms length (\~1 meter) of your rep motion.

Creeping: Don't be a creep. Don't stare at hotties. Don't flirt or ask for numbers. It's not the appropriate milieu (this includes the parking lot, Joe). Again, give a wide berth to anyone you imagine gets a lot of attention for their looks. They'll never know you're being courteous but they'll certainly remember if you made them uncomfortable.

Spotting: Ask and ye shall receive, but don't turn it into a conference, even if they give you a spot, the other person probably just wants to get back to their workout and go home.

Unsolicited advice: Don't tell other people how to workout. You don't work there and even if you do, they didn't ask.

Patience: Be patient with yourself and your progress. You get the benefits of exercise over time, not in one day. Don't injury yourself but don't waste your own time either, keep the workout just beyond the edge of your ability. I don't consider a workout good unless I felt a little bit of fear to continue at some point.

Starting vs. Habit: The hardest part of exercise is getting in shape in the first place and forming the habit, in the beginning (and if you take a long break) your brain will bombard you with all the excuses it knows will be effective at discouraging you to workout. Once exercise is a habit, it's harder not to workout. Exercise doesn't just shape your body, it shapes your thinking, makes you less susceptible to excuses and self doubt.

Purpose: Have a good and clear reason to be there. Purpose gives you focus and helps get you through any discomfort & pain. Some of the reasons I workout is because it's a mood-regulator, I want to stay healthy into old age, I sleep better, and I'm in less pain the rest of the day."
