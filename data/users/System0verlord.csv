>	Also, the people means everyone, not just citizens, because... we’re all people

But unfortunately for you, that’s not what a bill of rights applies too. [Per Wikipedia: A bill of rights, sometimes called a declaration of rights or a charter of rights, is a list of the most important rights to the citizens of a country. The purpose is to protect those rights against infringement from public officials and private citizens. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_rights)"

The ACLU went so far as to describe the struggles required for people who aren’t white men to be treated as full citizens, with the rights that come with it, in the article you linked. That total straw man came from the ACLU. Hell, it was a direct quote.

Those are still civil rights. Why? Because they’re defined by the government. The bill of rights protects those rights, but those rights are very much defined by the government.

They are given by a government and are thus civil rights. Human rights are universal, as was established in the UN UDHR.

Civil rights are very much granted by the government. Human rights are not. That’s one of if not the sole distinction between them.

Only in the technical sense that humans defined these rights and they apply to humans. That is otherwise incorrect. 

>	If you have ever taken a government class, then you would know that literally the entire point of the Bill of Rights, was to say that these rights are not government granted, but rather human rights which the government may never infringe upon.

Fun fact: that’s wrong. The Bill of Rights never mentions anything about that. Ever. The closest you get is article eleven of the 1789 Joint Resolution of Congress Proposing 12 Amendments to the U.S. Constitution which states “Article the eleventh... The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.”
