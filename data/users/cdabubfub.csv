psychology,fecxtno,t1_febxfa1,1578989006.0,"When dogs were wolves we were essentially partners, they had our back and we had theirs. There was obviously an immense amount of threats back then compared to now so it was very helpful for us and the wolves. They would help protect us and in exchange we would feed them and protect them also. Now since we have evolved into a modern society where they are very minimal threats, we are rewarding them for their loyalty by giving them shelter and food. It’s a beautiful relationship that has evolved over time."

nosurf,fe6s1e5,t1_fe6lf64,1578902690.0,"Maybe you are just scared because you know you are capable of more. Sounds like you are trying really hard and focusing on your negative thought patterns. I’m not religious whatsoever either, but I definitely believe everyone has a purpose. Otherwise you are selfish, life isn’t just about you. Imagine how many other people are in the same position as you, it’s how you handle it and move forward. You must fail and have bad times otherwise there would be no success or good times. I assume you are running from something, maybe your past? Family issues? I understand but you won’t get further in life by being a victim of your circumstances. We are humans, we have created everything you see around you right now. The people who did that are no different from you and I, the only difference is the words you tell yourself and the patterns and habits you indulge and take part in. This is life, you cannot compare your level 3 to someone else’s level 40. Sure some people get lucky and get born into a good life but most of us have to work for it. We as a species need to be chasing a goal. This is how we have survived for as long as we have, previously in much simpler times everyone had a role in the village they lived up to, a purpose. Now it is much more isolated and modernized, this has pros and cons. We are not designed to be living like we do right now, not at all. This is why the issues you express are so common, it stems from a lack of direction and action. It sounds like you spend too much time in your head, you need to get the fuck out of your head and just start doing something. Start a new hobby, start mma and create long term friendships. That’s just an example but I suggest you find a hobby or something to do that will get you out and put you in a group of people who will pick you up and help you on your journey. Life is hard alone, we are social animals. Long term solitary breeds bad habits and depression. You get stuck in a negative pattern and before you know it you’ve been doing it so long it’s ingrained into your subconscious mind so it becomes automatic like the motions of brushing your teeth or checking your phone as soon as you wake up. I suggest you listen to or read “3 magic words” it’s a very powerful book. There is no religion or any bullshit in there, it’s real shit that will change your life. You create your thoughts and your thoughts create your reality, this is where it all starts."

The trick is to kill your old self and replace it with a better you, this is called changing your identity. There are identity meditations on YouTube by Paul babin (the joe dispenza one) that really shift your mind and disconnect yourself from the present and puts you into the person you want to be shoes. It’s very powerful, meditation isn’t wuu wuu it’s some powerful shit. It’s not a permanent fix, you have to fix yourself with meditation daily. But this meditation specifically is a huge head start"

If you have any recommendations of consistent quality vendors please let me know, some good flower on a budget preferably! 

Looking for a solid vendor to stay with because I’ve been screwed by this same vendor 3 times (only ordered 3 times lol) ended up throwing out an ounce and a half of 3 total ounces. It hurts but I’d rather be safe than sorry. 

Maybe it’s time to try some indoor"

I recommend checking out r/hempflowers 
They have recommend vendors and stuff"
Petioles,fdzfha3,t3_enbd22,1578789687.0,"If you have any trouble buy some good cbd flower to taper off with, you’d be surprised how well it works! After just a week with the cbd I don’t crave anything anymore. It destimulates the endo-cannabinoid system which THC stimulates it and over stimulates with heavy use leading to over eating, habitual vices, over indulgence etc. I believe this is why people like you and I have such a hard time stopping, when you smoke the cbd flower you are still getting minuscule amounts of thc which helps a lot because it’s gradually taping off from thc rather than cold turkey which is very hard sometimes."

Luckily weed isn’t bad for the lungs for most people until it gets to very heavy use for over 50 years, now with that said weed is extremely unique in that regard. Most these inhaled will almost certainly cause some kind of harm to your lungs, now these people are making fake rolling papers (a very low ticket product that can be bought for cheap ) now do you think that they care about what happens after we purchase these fake papers? No. That’s why they cut corners and make them in the cheapest way possible, no idea what these are made of and I’m not taking the risk. I’ve had the hemp raws before
