guns,ff8c1fo,t1_ff7dviz,1579672429.0,"Seems like a slippery slope fallacy. The chance that Timmy handles a gun unsafely really depends on people who own guns handling them unsafely.

Realizing many people have their McMansions or a second home is one thing. But the amount of 100Millionaires is also larger than one would think. I always notice when I travel the yacht realtors. Every port town with a big dock has a few rows of big white yachts and inevitably a yacht realtor somewhere on the boardwalk. We talk about the 1% like they’re a handful of individuals. In reality those talking points you hear are about the .0001%. The billionaires. There are plenty of people keeping these yacht realtors in business. Who’s buying these yachts in rows and rows at every port you travel to? Ive known my fair share of people I consider wealthy and only one or two could afford one of these yachts.

> There is some variation in whether the term macaron or macaroon is used, and the related coconut macaroon is often confused with the macaron. In English, some bakers have adopted the French spelling of macaron for the meringue-based item to distinguish the two. Stanford professor of linguistics Daniel Jurafsky describes how the two confections have a shared history with macaroni (Italian maccheroni). Jurafsky notes that French words ending with ""-on"" that were borrowed into English in the 16th and 17th centuries are usually spelled with ""-oon"" (for example: balloon, cartoon, platoon).[5] In the UK, many bakeries continue to use the term ""macaroon"".[6][7][8]
