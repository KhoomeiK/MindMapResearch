I don’t think you should comment on acquaintances’ bodies as a general rule."
IncelTears,ff8tai5,t1_ff8m33k,1579695277.0,"Also on the point about being virgins, I think someone did a study comparing birth records and marriage records in an early modern English village and the majority of brides were pregnant on their wedding day, indicating that premarital sex was common, it was just expected that you’d get married when there was a kid coming."

I am sympathetic to the “other side” of this story because I’m bi and my lesbophobic mother kept me from getting close to my lesbian aunt by insinuating horrible stuff about her and treating it as sad/funny/creepy that she wasn’t feminine. I was wondering whether OP was giving off the message to her daughter that it’s not ok for HER to dress and act in a less feminine way (describing the clothing as “ill fitting” and disbelieving that a ten year old could know their gender and orientation, but we don’t question children about being straight). BUT the aunt lost credibility with that post."

fatlogic,fejw3ry,t1_fejbip3,1579187199.0,Yeah I’ve seen a lot of posts in bisexual online spaces about therapists that don’t believe bi clients and try to get them to admit they are really just gay or buy into the misconceptions. Therapists are probably more educated on social and health issues than the general public but they aren’t experts at everything that could impact mental health.

90DayFiance,fe8uym3,t1_fe8u44e,1578931189.0,Yeah I get the sense she outgrew Michael. And wants him to be happy for his sake and the kids.
LeavingNeverlandHBO,fe7llu7,t3_eo13l6,1578916210.0,"I am legitimately friends with a former neighbor who is is 65 years older than me, and we met when I was a toddler and I started going over alone to her house when I was four (my mother would watch out the window to make sure I arrived). She’s in a nursing home now and I try to visit when I can.

But a lot of things were the opposite of how Michael interacted with children. She always asked if I had my mother’s permission for things/kept her in the loop. She encouraged me to learn stuff and emphasized school (she was a retired teacher). She was still the “adult” in that she didn’t really tell me about her problems or make me responsible for her happiness. She didn’t encourage staying up late/mayhem/etc like Michael seemed to do. 

As to your question about what we had in common, I remember she’d usually come up with something where we’d play pretend but in retrospect with an educational component. Like we’d act out the character to Peter in the Wolf while it played or pretend to go to China. We also liked to look at her art books and she’d tell me about the artist. The Goya book was probably not a good choice for a child. As a got older she’d go to my cello concerts and stuff."
