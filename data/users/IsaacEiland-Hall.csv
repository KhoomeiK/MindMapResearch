And for anyone who is not watching because of toilet humour - it happens, but not all that often. And it is so completely and utterly worth it 90% of the time when it does.

I rolled my eyes first couple of eps at some jokes I thought were lame. But as it went on, seeing the crew totally relaxed during downtime felt more realistic to me.

Orville is the best possible modern TNG. It is not a parody; rather, a loving homage to the best of what Star Trek is."

You will note that the ad didn't contain anything copyrighted. No, you can't use those two copyrighted characters. But you can make parodies of them. IANAL, though, and depending on how closely you make them to the actual characters, you'd want to consult a lawyer that deals with IP (intellectual property).

Paid service has nothing to do with it. It is just as illegal to infringe someone's copyright whether or not you get paid. (There are some things that matter depending on how/if the IP owner filed for copyright vs. just depending on the immediate/automatic protection. In the former case, they might be able to recover more money from you. But it's a complicated discussion)"
