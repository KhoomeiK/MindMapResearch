His death and the death of the others have been very hard on everyone including myself. I’ve been in a bad mood since hearing that he passed away. 

I’ve been taught that I shouldn’t see life as being unfair but rather indifferent. He was the last person I would have expected to suddenly die out of nowhere. My heart breaks for Vanessa and the rest of his family. I’m at a loss for words and I don’t know what to make of his death—death is a natural part of life. Yet, it always seems so unexpected and sad, especially in situations like this. 

I’m bummed out."

You love that slippery slope fallacy!

Again, I will mention that I can literally make this argument about banning something because it’s bad about anything. I point this out because it’s just a part of life; I don’t think it’s possible to get through a regular day without coming across something that could be considered evil or bad for someone, somehow, somewhere. My intention originally was merely to point it out and really question whether this is something we should support as a social activity when the consequences can be fatal. For me, I don’t want any part of perpetuating an activity which is knowingly bad for someone else. I would feel awful knowing someone I supported slipped into a coma and died from playing football, all because this was that person’s only way to make good money and take care of their family. 

With kids, you can explain the consequence—it isn’t that they are too dumb to understand the consequence, it’s that the one part of the brain capable of rationalizing the fear they should feel doesn’t exist. In diabetics, they sometimes develop neuropathy where they don’t feel certain parts of their body—the signal for the big toe isn’t there and something gnarly happens like their dog chews off the toe and the patient has no idea this has happened. This is similar in the brain development for kids -sure, they can understand that it’s not good to take concussions to the head, they just aren’t going to get the signal in their brain as to how dire this can be because they lack that development in the part of the brain which involves risk taking. 

I’d also like to take a moment to point out that I’m not pulling this information out of my butt. I’m credentialed and took child development courses at the university level; this is a genuine thing and although kids are sturdy and resilient, there are just some risks I wouldn’t be willing to expose young adults to...this is one of those risks. 

Yes, other risks exist but this is the one I’m deciding to hang my hat on and discourage people from participating in."
todayilearned,ff8bvov,t1_ff8atxw,1579672269.0,"The only sport that runs a higher risk in danger is cheerleading. And you misunderstand me when I say that it should banned for children...it should be banned until they’re 21. At 15, the brain development is not physiologically complete. The part of the brain that makes you comprehend danger isn’t fully developed until about 21. Sure, you can explain the risks to a 15 year old but they are less capable from a physical standpoint due to development to truly be able to make that call. There’s a reason for the age limits being pushed up to 21...

The real danger lies in concussion after concussion after concussion. There aren’t doctors on the field monitoring the kids playing and kids often play with equipment that has degenerated and requires replacement. All it takes is a poor school that doesn’t provide proper equipment. There’s a lot of risk involved. Again, I can make this sort of argument for essentially anything. We can snowball into various reasons why kids shouldn’t play other sports as well but this one tends to be the one that carries a wallop in what can happen in the long run. 

The slippery slope is a fallacy but at some point, one has to examine their surroundings and question whether the choices made are the right ones. Is it right to make money at the cost of causing brain damage? Just food for thought."
todayilearned,ff87pnk,t1_ff87bcf,1579668386.0,"The desperation is there, though. It’s like prostitution—they’re at a higher risk to be sexually assaulted and abused in various ways, even when it’s regulated. Sure, some sex workers are there of their own volition but which one does the job and agrees to getting raped? 

Some sort of reform in the minimum should take place and it should definitely be banned for children. If at 21 they want to take that risk, fine. At least their brain is more or less mature enough to understand the consequences of brain damage resulting from repeated concussions when playing football."

He’s never had a cut or has developed a rash from it. I was obviously kidding about shaving it down to the bone. He gets shaved between his toes where his fur gets long, around his butt, the bottom half of his tail, and then most of his body. He has a modified cut in the winter because I don’t want him to be cold. He’s also indoors only  but you can tell he’s much more comfortable after the shave. At most, he gets shaved down 3 times a year. He also never bites at himself or licks at himself after. If any behavioral issues developed from shaving him, I would stop. It’s only done to keep him from developing more concerning health issues such as an intestinal blockage stemming from grooming himself and eating too much fur. He also gets brushed on a regular basis so hopefully the combined actions results in a healthy cat."
