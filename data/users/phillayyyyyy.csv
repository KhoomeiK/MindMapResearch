AskReddit,feoc6a6,t3_eq73ds,1579298130.0,"Every damn day! Sometimes my patients with schizophrenia are reality-based, but also sometimes not. Today I had a patient say, “Can you tell God to forgive me?” and “There’s a demon behind you.” I’ve seen people with schizophrenia punch their peers, strip and run around naked, and douse their hands in toothpaste and wipe it all over the walls. However! People with schizophrenia have ups and downs and have emotions like everyone else, so I by no means want them to be stigmatized. The horrible impacts of a chronic mental illness can be sad to see."
