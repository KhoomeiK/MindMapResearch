beauty,ffb1waj,t3_esl95j,1579749721.0,"All of the advice here is spot on! The only thing I'll add is practice walking in front of a mirror. A woman only looks good wearing heels if she can walk easily in them re: not look awkward and off balance; so while you're breaking them in around the house, maybe put a full length mirror at the end of a hallway and experiment with your walk/strut. You might feel a bit silly, but once you get it it's a skill for life!"
raisedbynarcissists,ffajdj8,t3_esfo1x,1579737181.0,"Yep! Lol one time I was out with my mother and two aunts and it was so bad that I went around the corner to the hostess stand (out of sight from the table) and asked for my server so that I could say something like ""I'm sorry for my family's rudeness, you're handling it really well, thank you."" As I was speaking, my aunt comes around to use the restroom, sees me talking to the staff and says to me, ""I've already complained, don't worry."" Lmao!"

raisedbynarcissists,fem2n1a,t3_ept7jj,1579237730.0,"I feel you. My mother took me ""make up shopping"", but only chose the blandest of items. I figured out how to apply proper make-up on my own (well, I had help), and that was ""attracting too much attention""; she hated me for it. And yet, if I didn't go to school well presented, she'd say I was a slob. Our parents' actions are confusing, hence the problems. It was YEARS before I'd be seen outside the house unless I was in heels. My advice: be yourself. Wear make-up, if you like the way it looks on you. Talk to the people at the beauty desk of Shoppers or London Drugs and ask them tons of questions. And be patient with yourself; our parents never were, so we can damned well offer it to ourselves <3"

raisedbynarcissists,fe6fok6,t1_fe367bo,1578889490.0,"I'm posting this here so that it's at the top: things DO get better, in my experience. Not by magic, not overnight, and not on their own; WORK at it. Find a good therapist, read up, learn everything you can about distress tollerance, behavior regulation and interpersonal effectiveness. I chose to be optimistic, and guess what: the work payed off. I still often feel rage, and bleak, and alone, but those feelings don't consume me anymore. They pass, and life is pretty great! But you have to want it. BE optimistic, it's the way through the bullshit. At least for me, but I know damned well you can work through it, too, just give it time <3 It gets better!!"

raisedbynarcissists,fditbf4,t3_elg9z9,1578450568.0,"Yep, my mother does this, too...accuses me of ""twisting things around"" to suit me; lol nope, just recounting what happened or what was said. I think she actually believes her version, that she NEEDS to believe in her false memories a) because it is utterly beyond her to be incorrect, and b) it is also beyond her to see herself in any light that isn't perfect. It doesn't bother me nearly as much as it used to (that took A LOT of practice, and time). My memory is excellent, like yours, and as the result of a childhood of being gaslit, I have since developed a strong sense of fairness, ethics, right/wrong, objectivity; it initially helped me survive, but holy hell it's an extremely valuable life skill to have! Bit of a silver lining :)"

AmItheAsshole,fdd3fa4,t1_fdd353p,1578293180.0,"The person stated that OP and his SO sounded like kids about who should do what around the house. My argument is that adults living together are better off discussing things (it's HEALTHY to do so); they're not squabbling siblings, they're partners."

AmItheAsshole,fdcyg0n,t1_fdbs7bs,1578288048.0,"Actually, no; it's the kind of thing mature adults who live together DISCUSS. OP only stepped out of line with the whole ""put my foot down"" thing, but it's reasonable to expect an equal division of labor/costs and the need TO TALK ABOUT IT like level headed adults. This is how you avoid drama, unnecessary fighting, and unhealthy relationships. You make it seem like they should be able to psychically understand eachother."
