Best of luck to whomever goes next. I can only hope that they recognize that this landmark is part of our community and give both the respect that they deserve."

todayilearned,fezlnl2,t1_fezfx71,1579458691.0,"Hey, there's a time and a place for everything. Once upon a time all I wanted to watch was indie flicks and documentaries. These days I'm much older and the last 3 times I went to the theater were for 2 Star Wars movies and the Jay and Silent Bob Reboot. Not exactly all time classics.

My point was film makers like Scorsese inspire, while senseless blockbusters do little more than appease children (or the children inside us) and rake in cash.

Give it a generation. When they don't create new ideas due to growing up on rehashed ideas and a lack of creative influences, don't bitch. Just realize that you, me, and everyone else who went for the low hanging fruit played our parts."
todayilearned,fezk13j,t1_fez1kkp,1579458160.0,"Yeah. 20 years old and the fucking thing felt like it was about to explode. No other explanation I can offer other than I thought I was going to die. Twice that day, in fact."

todayilearned,feyssve,t1_feyrp5f,1579450171.0,"It really was amazing! I never worked mom n pop, but at Movie Gallery we were always allowed to take home prereleases as long as they were on the shelf by opening.

I still remember bringing home Showgirls. As it was banned in Alabama at theatrical release I had a packed house for that viewing since I had the first copy most people around me ever had a chance to see. The movie was gawd awful but we all got to see Jessie Spano nekkid for the first time, so that was pretty cool."
todayilearned,feyrg0o,t1_feynox9,1579449726.0,Amazing flick! Every scene is so perfectly orchestrated that I can't even fathom how it all came together. And this coming from someone who adored RKO 281.
todayilearned,feyqyl7,t1_feyohos,1579449486.0,"Honestly I don't know. To be perfectly frank the moment I was told what to do, I just sorta tuned out. My guess from prior experience with Movie Gallery was either running movies (since Blockbuster only had us run teailer tapes on loop), or movies rated pg-13 or above (Movie Gallery only let us run G or PG, and I never asked why though I always assumed it was not to offend). I was also told to look for something about upcoming release oosters, but once again I was so far checked out of the conversation that I have no idea what I was told.

Sorry I don't have the answer that you're looking for, but it really was a long time ago and not an important job in my life. I know that's a cop out response, but its all I've got."
todayilearned,feyilqq,t1_feyhu5f,1579445942.0,"Amen. Record shops were the same way, but thankfully digital releases put most of those out of business so only the ""good guys"" remain."
todayilearned,feyhkmn,t1_feyfja6,1579445680.0,"Yeah, its rare but kind of a thing. I could eat it as a kid but once the early-90's came around every time I ate some I got sick. Basically gave me the shits, so I quit eating it iff of a doctor's recommendation.

 In college, after giving it up altogether for a few yaers, a frat boy (SAO) at a bbq wanted to prove I was seeking attention gave me a breast smothered in bbq sauce and told me it was pork. I was so drunk that I couldn't tell the difference, ate the whole thing, and wound up with such a severe reaction that I was hospitalized for a few days.

Since then a few doctors have theorized that it is the chemicals that mass producers feed chickens to make them grow super large that I'm really allergic to and that given my history I should be able to eat free range organic, but given the fact that the last time I tried it I was in so much pain that I begged the nurse to cut my dick off (true story), I'm not willing to test that theory.

Worst thing that happens to me these days is I accidentally order a pepperoni pizza made with some chicken byproducts and wind up with a nasty case of the runs for a few days.

TMI, but totally true."
todayilearned,feybh68,t1_feyac4d,1579443268.0,"It was her boss, but yeah. That really happened."
todayilearned,feyasi6,t1_fey7y4e,1579443117.0,"I can't 100% confirm that, but it felt pretty obvious at the time. If anyone here happened to work at the Family Video in Huntsville, AL they could provide better insight. All I know is that I was sent to investigate, gave them a heads up, they held a meeting, and they closed shop right around our grand opening.

And if anyone did actually work there, I was the guy at the grand opening in the blue monkey suit/costume that was sword fighting kids with my tail. Also, if you were one of those kids and I smacked you too hard please understand it was hotter than hell in that costume and aI was high as hell. Sorry, it wasn't intentional!

Edit: whoops, I misread your comment. No, they did not go after our own store. They went after the local business that was our soon to be competitor."
todayilearned,fey7ohw,t1_fey6qiz,1579441856.0,"No shit? Well TIL.

And fuck them! As a man allergic to chicken I can whole heartedly say that their burgers suck."
todayilearned,fey5ipi,t1_fex6r2f,1579441067.0,"My experience was the exact opposite. Their late 90's business model for opening new stores was to overload a ton of copies for new releases, but their selection of older flicks was utter shit. For fuck's sake, the store I helped open didn't even have a copy of Dirty Dancing or Citizen Cane.

Not exactly my favorite movie (Dirty Dancing, that is), but come on! What local video store in the 90's didn't have those? It was a chain for people who watched movies on a Friday night but didn't love cinema. Hell, even the crap chain that popped up in Wal Mart at the time had a better selection.

Edit: and we wonder how American cinema has devolved into billion dollar superhero reboots while Scorsese is forced to Netflix."
todayilearned,fey3tny,t1_fexdql7,1579440455.0,"Quick story to back up how much of bastards they were. In the late 90's I took a part time job with them to supplement my income. It was a new store, so prior to the official opening we spent our days settling up racks, candy displays, those blocks in the parking lot that stop you from hitting the sidewalk, etc.

One afternoon I walked into my shift and I was tasked with just one thing for the day, go to the local mom n pop neighborhood video store and find any and all violations. Running videos that weren't approved on their monitors, early releases of movies, things like that.

Instead I went straight to the counter, asked to speak with the owners, and gave them the heads up of why I was sent. They politely thanked me and I left.

Two weeks later they had a visit from our regional manager, and within a month they closed down for good.

Tl;dr Blockbuster intentionally targeted local businesses that were well established, and did what they could to put them out of business."

answers,fdc6fyq,t1_fdb9soy,1578268025.0,"So weird that you are willing to mislead about these ""secret pallets of money"". The repeated use of that phrase didn't sit well with me, kind of like it was a specifically worded and market tested talking point, so I checked on a few sources from the AP to the WSJ.

Turns out only the method of transfer was secret. Due to US regulations we can't make direct bank transfers with Iranian banks, so the money was sent in unmaked cargo planes. Futhermore the money was from a deal gone wrong in the 70's where we failed to give them the goods they paid for after a regime change. The first shipment was the initial 400 million that they paid, followed by 1.3 billion in intetest.

The whole ordeal was tied up in arbitration for years and also resulted in Iran paying out 2.7 billion to US citizens and businesses. It was also reported at the time of the agreement, which was reported on about 7 or 8 months before the cash was dropped off.

And yes, each source did recognize that the release of hostages coincided with this first payment, and I'm not so oblivious as to think that this wasn't a back channelled part of the agreement - but at the end of the day all we did was return money to its its rightful owner. Not sure how you made it sound so much more nefarious than that, but it is what it is."
