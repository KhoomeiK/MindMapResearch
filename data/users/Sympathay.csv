news,ffvm0ks,t1_ffvcibu,1580267284.0,"Also you’re actually dense, “it doesn’t matter how you give it to them” what you’re referring to is INFLATION. Inflation occurs with more money being present so it 100% matter how you give them the money, are you making more or just moving it. Jesus Christ you should learn this in school."
news,ffvluek,t1_ffvcibu,1580267167.0,"Buddy, if you own a taco store and sold them for 1$... still with me? Okay.
And everyone now has 1000$ more would it be better to 
A: increase prices making people less incentivized to purchase from you even with the money
Or
B: keep prices the same because now more people have money to buy from you, even people who would normally not have enough allowance to buy in the first place

If you’re smart you go with B. 

Just think about it a lil longer. You people repeat points you see online and spew them like they are fact. Use your fucking brain."

worldnews,ffrtnge,t1_ffre443,1580165573.0,"Because pedophiles are fucking everywhere dude. Are you say everything’s bad because someone you don’t like is involved with it? I never said I supported the church. I am however a devout believer. Any devout believer knows the “church” is not what God wants or even ask you to participate in. I’m not going to blame religion (God) for the evil of man. I wish the church would go to hell honestly, but for people to say “reLiGIon is BAd” is just so stupid. It’s understandable but it’s still stupid. Evil people take advantage of anything they can, including ignorant good people. Again, fuck the church but love God."
worldnews,ffr9c9v,t1_ffr34xh,1580153276.0,The source of evil is people not religion. People make religion bad. Religion doesn’t make people bad. Seperate the system from belief. People can love education but hate school. I love God but hate religion.
