To lose the few vanity pounds you want to simply reduce what you eat daily by a few hundred calories by eating a bit smaller portions or leaving out something calorie heavy here and there and move more, like adding a short round (3 miles of walking or running) to your daily routine. It shouldn't really impact your daily life in a major way, shouldn't leave you hungry and should still get you rid of the 10 lbs in time - you only need to lose an average of 400 kcal/day, so 150 kcals less eaten and 250 kcals more expended (about 5 km walked or 3 km run) should do the trick if you do it consistently."
loseit,feg07vi,t3_eofvui,1579071413.0,"You don't want to run marathons for weight loss or during weight loss. Marathon training is very specific and relies a lot on getting actually a lot of energy and usually happens in a surplus. If you ever run for an hour on empty glucose stores (like you usually have when being in a calorie deficit, especially if you limit carbs too) you know why. It's really, really hard and makes for bad times and bad run speed. It's the famous ""hammer"" of km 31 for many marathon runners. Once your glucose stores run out you run on fat burning, which is very inefficient and needs a lot of oxygen, making running really, really frustrating and hard. It's hard if you do it for 5-10 km, it's nearly impossible on a marathon distance.

So, running 5k, maybe even 10k during weightloss is doable, if not exactly fun (having done it for 6 months myself), but I would recommend you to wait for marathons until you lost the weight you want, since you very likely will pile on some pounds during prep, which is a good thing there. 

Walking is actually the far better exercise for weight loss, especially early on. It take more time, but you can do it more consistently, it's not as harsh on your knees at that high a weight and it builds a very good, solid base for running. The old ""learn to walk before you run"" chestnut is very true for this. Running is something I either would build slowly up and in smaller doses at your (presumed) fitness and weight level, or something I would wait to do until you have lost 40-50 lbs (that's what I did and I'm pretty happy about it, I started running when I had ""only"" 200 lbs).

Because a system change [I assume an IT system] we try to do the billing/invoicing according to the time period again starting with the 17th of December 2019 [Turnus = defined period like a year, quarter, month, semester etc. - she probably knows what is meant here]. With this change the invoices will be sent with the end of the period starting with the 17th of December 2019.
Please don't be surprised if some invoices end at the 16th of December 2019 [I assume they are still done in the old system and the new one starts with the next day]. We hope for your understanding and acknowledgement. Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions."
loseit,fdmt40f,t3_em7k4x,1578564471.0,"8 months is a perfectly fine timespan to lose 12 kg - 1.5 kg per month. It's very near the most recommended range of the 500 kcal/day, which works out at 2 kg per month.

Nobody can tell you if you get rejected because of your weight or not, since we don't know their criteria, but if they reject you because of the speed of your weight-loss it would be pretty stupid. Also, while a BMI of 34 is not great, it's also not one that really hinders you much in your daily life. I guess if you can convince them that you are willing and working on getting down to a even better weight, I hope it works out for you!"
loseit,fdmrbi1,t3_em1qh4,1578561929.0,"Running is great. I hated it with a passion all my life - turns out it was mostly because I was fat and it sucked doing anything if you are fat, and all the teachers, trainers, drill instructors simply took the median of the group I was in and tried to improve them - which meant it was always far, far too much for me and I got frustrated. Then I did - like 90 % of people I guess - C25K. Turns out interval training was exactly what I needed. Short bursts of running and long periods of walking, which the running part slowly increasing was exactly what worked for me. And how it worked.
December 2018 I started running.

Personally I don't find running very helpful for just losing weight, because I at least get pretty hungry and running on a deficit really, really sucks and makes you pretty miserable. It helps a lot for all other things in life though. Makes you feel better all around.



Can't wait to start running this year, still have to deal with a stupid cold, and I don't want to start too early."
loseit,fdmj71n,t3_elyxx8,1578551851.0,"It's impossible to predict because everyone's skin is so different. It's less likely  if you have to lose less weight, are younger and male. More likely if you are older, have lost more weight and are female. 

It also takes up to two years for your skin to go back to the lowest state after weight-loss, so don't be too hasty to judge it, putting muscle under the skin also helps.

And if all fails there is surgery, expensive, but works. However, even without surgery - empty skin doesn't work on killing you 24/7 like the fat did before, so it's already better.

I can only really speak from my own experience of losing 120 lbs - nearly no lose skin, just a bit if I go down on my knees and make a bridge, despite being older and having lost quite some weight."

giantbomb,fdg8t4c,t3_el1ruy,1578384911.0,"I actually like the West stuff overall more than the East stuff. I like both, no question, but East can be annoying and fatiguing to listen/watch far more often than the more mellow and relaxed West output. Not every format resonates with everyone (Burgle my Banana is something I can only watch in smaller bursts for example) and not every episode can be an highlight, but overall I'm very happy with the majority of content from both coasts.

And what gets called jaded is something I see as big plus of GB: Not getting reeled in by any new hype and thing, not taking every word put out by an PR department as gospel and actually seeing things a bit more long-term. Even if it means they completely ignore or don't ""get"" outstanding games like Witcher 3, Disco Elysium or Death Stranding. Or any strategy game, which outside of Austin's far too short time at GB is always pretty strongly neglected."

Stellaris,fddrznm,t1_fddllph,1578322450.0,Seems a common response oddly enough.

Imagine this on a galactic scale with the Rim barely controlled by the Republic, independant local clusters and worlds, Hutt worlds, Mandalore... 

Even if there were not even small local wars, there is still more than enough things happening in a  ""time of peace"" - Jedi as kind of Knights Errant helping local people, investigating crimes or some artefacts, unknown things, relicts etc. Many possibilities and things don't require an outright war or even an Empire or Sith stand-in."
loseit,fd0m67p,t3_ejm280,1578120757.0,"The nice things about cultures that don't care so much about public nakedness is also they don't care so much about how someone looks naked. once you have seen your share of naked people it becomes so normal  not much will ever vex you.

I also was terrified of my first visit to a naked spar/sauna, and that was after I had already lost a ton of weight. I just avoided these places for decades, after I was out of school. Turns out nobody cares and you soon don't care either, everybody is naked, everybody has things they like or hate on their body, even if they look like super models."
loseit,fd0jnei,t3_ejqew3,1578119778.0,"It's a ""talk with your doctor about it"" small amount of food, yes. It makes it difficult to keep the micro- and macronutrients at a required level without a medical professional making sure of it. Which would lead to at least short-term consequences (hair loss, brittle nails, feeling tired, moody...) to even long-term issues (rarely, but possibly scurvy, brittle bones, gall bladder problems...) if done for a long time.

It's hard for smaller women to lose weight and keep a good input going, it's unfair, but being on the save side is more important than being 2 months quicker.

Also, since you are already at a healthy weight there is no reason outside of wanting to look a certain way to rush it so."
