motorcycles,ff8x1ce,t3_esb4jr,1579698875.0,"Front end washed out at a high speed, people in our riding group said around 70mph. Went head first into a concrete jersey barrier, bike hit a curb-ish thing, I think.

I got knocked out for quite a long time. Concussion so bad I was throwing up the next day.

But I was an idiot and didn't go to the hospital because well yea.......


Edit: I rode for 3 years before I ever crashed so I knew it was going to be a doozy when it happened.

I never had the ""beginner rider blues""."
