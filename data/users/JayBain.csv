offmychest,ffmu2ij,t1_fflnjcf,1580058906.0,"Right yeah, I feel like PH should have a category for rape fantasy stuff and leave it in there so they don't blend in with the rest of the porn. Nothing ruins the mood worse than that shit."
cringepics,ffij84k,t3_ettral,1579975166.0,Aw what the shit
AmItheAsshole,ffhigls,t3_etncli,1579936716.0,"I thought this was gonna end with ""Uri-tarded"". I'm kinda disappointed now."
cringepics,ffhie1a,t3_etnd94,1579936621.0,"Yeah, how would anybody on Reddit know?"
notliketheothergirls,ffh9liv,t3_etbsgt,1579927100.0,I think fruity drinks are actually more masculine because it shows how little you care about social conformity. Or maybe that's just what I tell myself to justify my love for wine coolers and margaritas.
AmItheAsshole,ffh84pa,t1_ffh7wcq,1579925824.0,"You've got to be very straightforward and stubborn. Tell them exactly what you want and leave no room for interpretation. It's the same thing with tattoo artists, if you give way even a little bit, you're sure to get a different product. (Sometimes better but none the less)"
AmItheAsshole,ffh7rw4,t3_etlwkq,1579925525.0,"YWNBTA, but I personally wouldn't because they probably won't give it to you. I'd just go somewhere else where the hairdresser is willing to do what you want versus what they want next time."
iamverysmart,ffb0q6g,t1_ffb0cel,1579748929.0,"A throwaway account is a separate account you make with the intention of convincing someone you're a second person. I know that this is the same person who originally responded to me. You have 2 comments over the course of 1 year, and no activity until you responded to me today."
iamverysmart,ffaza8a,t1_ffaz1kw,1579747955.0,Also nice throwaway pal
iamverysmart,ffaz1kw,t1_ffaydv5,1579747794.0,"Yeah I guess I could have been a little more sensitive to him here. I was just kinda pissed he tried to woosh me on my own joke, and then said XD."
Triggered,ffapdfr,t1_ffapclv,1579741360.0,I'm 19
Triggered,ffapbn1,t3_eslfl6,1579741326.0,"No no no, you need to include the context otherwise it makes no sense."
iamverysmart,ffaowi1,t1_ffaou34,1579741047.0,Oh NOOOOOO don't
iamverysmart,ffanzpi,t1_ffano14,1579740431.0,"Yeah no fucking shit, you just piggybacked off of my original joke. You are the one who was wooooshed here von whiskers, because this has nothing to do with grammar. Ecks dee."

horror,ffadydl,t1_ffa5xor,1579733331.0,Yeah Beloved is super underappreciated in horror circles

niceguys,ff18ikl,t1_ff17g31,1579476298.0,I'mma tell you a secret fella. Everybody likes hot chip. We just act like it's a white girl thing to mask our insecurity.
niceguys,ff15myk,t1_ff10ejt,1579475483.0,"Like purple Takis, flaming hot Cheetos, I think certain Doritos probably qualify"

niceguys,fez8abw,t1_fez6j7c,1579454737.0,"So by that logic it wouldn't be insensitive for me to go on a tour of a concentration camp, look around at the other people on the tour, and say ""you know, theres really some quality plumbing here. Somebody really spent a lot of time on this sink."" Look back at the guide. ""Great tour man."" Even if you don't think it's insensitive, it's definitely irrelevant and would make me look like an idiot."
