My wife has a condition that would result in her having a miscarriage if she got pregnant, which happened during her first marriage, and I don’t want her to have that happen.

Oh god you’re totally right.  I never had the expectation that sex would be like porn, or that men and women look like them.  I didn’t date at all from about 19-20 to 28 due to a couple of bad experiences with a girlfriend in high school and then with a woman I had a few dates with in my sophomore year of college.  Mainly though it had a lot to do with being in a major rut in my personal life going to work ,coming home, going to work, coming home, etc that if I look back probably gave me social anxiety and depression.  

I finally dated and lost my virginity at 28.  From that point to when I got married non of my sexual partners had commented on the size of my penis, and obviously I never asked how I stacked up so to speak.  It seemed like a question one simply doesn’t ask, and also said more about the insecurities of the person asking.  

I should have thought about it as I broke a few condoms while dating, thankfully never when I had ejaculated.  

My wife says that I’m the perfect size, and that I fill her.  The problem for us is that she deals with pain during sex and we’re going to have to find positions that will limit the depth that I go as I don’t want to hurt her."

tifu,feo4kf3,t3_eq59kp,1579295031.0,"It was definitely a revelation for me as well.  I always assumed I was average.  I never looked it up, and I never had any experience seeing other dudes dicks.  Because I only really ever saw a guys dick in porn.  I don’t remember a gym where a guy was naked and I didn’t go looking since that would be weird and an invasion of privacy.  

My wife was the one that brought it to my attention, and suggested I try a larger size as well.  We don’t often use them since she is on continual birth control due to a medical condition, and I’ll be getting a vasectomy since we don’t want kids.  It’s definitely a game changer though."

That’s pretty shitty.  The customer was still in the store as they had purchased the items for him first before doing their own shopping.  Shittier.  

He did have a dog with him, but he wasn’t asking for anything that could be used for the dog.  I can guarantee you that anyone in that neighborhood would have bought something for the dog if that’s what he had asked for as they were all dog lovers.  

That’s the thing, he didn’t live on the streets, he lived in an assisted living place nearby.  He wasn’t trying to get a motel room, and I sincerely believe it wasn’t to buy drugs.  His vice was alcohol, which you could smell coming out of his pores.  

Yes I judged what he did to be crappy of him, yes this is one side of the story.  However maybe you should practice what you preach in not being judgmental.
