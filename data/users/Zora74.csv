Abortiondebate,ffreomd,t1_ffrds6a,1580156559.0,"But IVF has (according to pro-life) the same intent to kill for convenience and cost- effectiveness. 

You can say people are uninformed, and perhaps in general population that is true. But pro-life is aware of IVF and what it entails. Why are they not taking action? Why are they not educating people?"
Abortiondebate,ffregf3,t1_ffr4u2t,1580156422.0,So...start taking action.
Abortiondebate,ffrdh2e,t1_ffr71nn,1580155826.0,"Does intent matter? 

Most pregnant women seeking abortion didn’t intend to become pregnant. 

Most people don’t intend to cause accidents. It doesn’t mean they aren’t held accountable."

prolife,ff8qi3h,t1_ff8iy6f,1579691860.0,"Did prochoicers make child rearing expensive? 

Abortion, especially in the first trimester, is a simple and quick outpatient procedure. Of course it will be cheaper than birth or IVF. Also, most abortions are done by non-profits. 

Which side tends to vote more in favor of wider social safety nets and increased access to birth control?"
starterpacks,ff81s9j,t1_ff7oycx,1579663741.0,"As an adult taking kids to the beach or water park, I always let those kids join us, as long as they were getting along with the others. One time a 5-ish year old kid randomly glomped on to me playing with my niece in the ocean. We were in waist deep water.  MY waist, not theirs! So I moved to shallower water and played with them both."
TwoXChromosomes,ff7t3no,t1_fe9n5nd,1579657702.0,"I went through a similar thing for a while. Higher doses of ibuprofen or Napeoxen as soon as I thought I was getting my period, and taken regularly until bleeding stopped completely, did wonders. Something about my body not actually releasing an egg when I ovulated. I was offered BC pills for it,  but just didn’t want to. So we tried this first."

The study authors already mentioned and addressed concerns re: loss to follow up. 

What sample size do you recommend for a study like this, and how do you derive that number? What would be your acceptable attrition rate? 

Low cost clinics are located in low-income areas because that is where it makes sense to put them. How would abortion perpetuate a cycle of poverty?"

The only one which hasn’t followed up with me persistently is Deborah Heart Foundation, even though it’s an institution I would gladly donate to again. Which reminds me to make a donation at tax return time :)"

Abortiondebate,ff6euzh,t1_ff5qtz1,1579625672.0,How do you equally value them if one is causing harm to the other? If medical treatment for one increases risk or actively harms the other?
prolife,ff6dra7,t3_errwnf,1579624986.0,"How is preserving someone’s right to control and maintain their own body sexist? How is it sexist to allow a woman to make major medical and lifestyle decisions for herself? 

I support doing anything we can to help women and families keep their pregnancies. I don’t want pregnancy to be a binary choice of success or childbearing, and I don’t think it is. I do believe that there are situations where pregnancy is not in the woman’s best interest. But, ultimately, it has to be the woman’s choice to maintain a pregnancy or not, and I think society and government should be geared to help women, or at least not hinder them. Some women don’t want to be pregnant for any reason, others just not right now, and other’s want to be pregnant very badly. Keeping a woman’s reproductive options open and accessible is not sexist. 

I find it interesting that you brought up pregnant women being murdered by intimate partners. The Turnaway Study showed that women denied access to abortion were more likely to remain with abusive partners than those who were able to obtain an abortion.  They were also more likely to live in or near poverty than those who were able to access abortion. There is a lot to take away from this information, but I don’t think restricting abortion access is one of those things."
