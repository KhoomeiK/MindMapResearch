AskReddit,fckm3n6,t1_fckkj10,1577728299.0,"That makes sense. How do I get her to do it though? I don‚Äôt live there anymore and my mother is a very stubborn person and also rather lazy and unmotivated. When you tell her to do something she‚Äôll just keep saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do it later‚Äù and eventually get mad if you persist. 

My siblings are too young to understand all this so I don‚Äôt know how much I can help. My brother is nine years old and the special needs one is six years old and she‚Äôs got a really severe learning disability. 

I‚Äôve always dreamt of doing something big like maybe pursuing a medical career or scientific research. But frankly I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll be able to get a degree in something like that if I‚Äôve got my siblings to worry about. I‚Äôve also always wanted to travel around the world. And be active in nature, hiking, swimming, climbing, diving, you name it, there‚Äôs all these things I want to do but how would I? 
I‚Äôm also stuck currently taking care of someone who‚Äôs been out of an occupation for like a year. I work a depressing minimum wage factory job with awful hours to pay their bills and mine. 
Honestly I‚Äôm just so sick of everything now. I feel trapped. I don‚Äôt like my life. I just want to be far away from all this. Sorry for my rambling."
AskReddit,fckinag,t1_fckh72f,1577726163.0,"She‚Äôs got bipolar disorder. The way she deals with it is mostly sleeping all day. And she never leaves the house with the kids because she‚Äôs so scared of social interactions. 
Yes the house is a complete mess. There‚Äôs dirt and piles of stuff all over the floor. I visited this week actually and spent a whole day just literally just cleaning because it was so disgusting. The toilet made me retch. There were moldy vegetables in the fridge and I noticed today that the kettle I‚Äôve used for a week to make tea for myself had a filter covered in white and black mould. My siblings don‚Äôt feel close at all to my mum, just like i didnt either growing up. And yes my father tries his best to make up for it. 
It makes my life suffer because I‚Äôve missed out on a lot of things in my youth like going out partying with friends because I had to take care of my siblings. Even when I was younger, before I had my license, I missed out because i couldn‚Äôt go anywhere because we live in the middle of nowhere and my mum wouldn‚Äôt drive me anywhere. So I had a very lonely childhood. And now I feel like i might not be able to pursue the career and life choices I want because I have to be there for my siblings. The youngest has special needs too. And one day when my father can‚Äôt do it anymore I‚Äôm gonna have to take them in and care for them for the rest of my life. That is not what i imagined my life to be. I don‚Äôt look forward to the future anymore. I haven‚Äôt in a while. 

Thank you for your kind words it really means a lot to me right now"
AskReddit,fckgc17,t1_fckfthy,1577724701.0,My mum‚Äôs mentally ill and doesn‚Äôt take care of my younger siblings. Very neglectful and the house is a disgusting mess. My father‚Äôs barely home. I‚Äôm in the middle of it and because I‚Äôm the only older sibling who can handle children (my older brother has anger issues) I‚Äôve taken care of them a lot and my own life is suffering because of it.

unpopularopinion,fc52nuu,t1_fc4zdy4,1577439968.0,"I know how you feel. I‚Äôm in a similar boat. If you need to vent feel free to message me. 


My older sister is a functional person but has extremely severe learning difficulties which makes living a regular life on her own impossible for her. Years ago she ran off with another guy who‚Äôs also mentally challenged in a similar way and she got pregnant and refused to abort. Obviously she wasn‚Äôt able to take care of her daughter and my parents decided to take her in (instead of giving her to a better home like I had suggested). 


That might sound cold hearted of me by the reason I said it is because my mother is mentally ill. I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs bipolar disorder but I‚Äôm not 100% sure because my parents and I never talked about it in depth. What this means for my niece is that she‚Äôll be on her own all day basically. She will never get the attention and support she needs to flourish. My mother will provide food (sometimes almost rotten) and wash laundry but that‚Äôs about it.. she usually sleeps half the day and spends the remaining time scratching her face and staring out the window. The house is a fucking mess and my father has to fight for it every time to get my mum to do any cleaning. (He‚Äôs self employed and forced to work very long hours in a very physically demanding job). It‚Äôs dirty and there‚Äôs piles of stuff all over the floor and the kitchen always has that slightly sweet rotten smell. I moved out two years ago and it kills me every time to see the state of things when I visit them. Often when I‚Äôm there I have to fetch my niece and younger brother some clothes after I noticed they‚Äôve been wearing the same pair of socks and underwear for three days. 


I‚Äôve been taking a lot of care of my younger brother as well ever since he was born (when I was twelve years old) because he might as well have no mum and my dad‚Äôs barely home anyway. It broke his little heart when I moved out and he still cries that I‚Äôm gone but I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. I couldn‚Äôt focus on my life I was just taking care of children that I did not put into this world. 


Nowadays my father is pressuring me to come back, and I kinda want to because the guilt is eating me up inside most of the time, but I know it‚Äôll be the same again when I‚Äôm back. And one day I‚Äôm going to end up being stuck taking in my niece and taking care of her for the rest of my life and I hate it. I‚Äôm only 21, I should be able to live my own life. I know it sounds selfish but it really is a heavy burden on my shoulders and I wish I could be as happy and excited about life as others my age but because of all this I am not. 


Also where I‚Äôm living at the moment I‚Äôm currently taking care of someone who‚Äôs been out of an occupation for like a year and paying all their bills on top of mine when working a really depressing minimum wage job (chips factory...) and it‚Äôs really taking a toll on me. I‚Äôm just tired of life at this point. Taking care of others has always been my life and seems like it always will be."
