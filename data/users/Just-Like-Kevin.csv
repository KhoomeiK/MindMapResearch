depression,ff0q3un,t3_eqs4h8,1579471255.0,"I absolutely agree with you, but I use this idea more as a “just hang on a bit” sentiment rather than any sort of “answer” or “cure” for depression.

I have a photo of a rollercoaster next to my bathroom mirror. It’s there to remind me that life is a rollercoaster. It always goes up and down. When we are at the top, we never question whether or not it will go down again. When we are at the bottom, it’s all too easy to believe that it will never go up again. But of course it does. It always will. Depression is a liar."

You can think whatever you want to, big man. What you’re really saying is that you’re not allowed to have an opinion without other people telling you it’s stupid or hateful. That’s absolutely true. Always has been. All that’s changed lately is dumbasses crying over “not being allowed to think.”"

So yeah, this is a thing, and it’s good to know things before just jumping in to laugh.

The whole Black Lives Matter movement came from black people seeing far too many other black people being unjustly killed by white police and white citizens who received no legal punishment. The message seemed very clear: If you’re black, you don’t matter.

As a white guy, I have never in my life felt that my country didn’t care if I lived or died because of the color of my skin. I don’t need to march in the streets to protest and remind people that I’m human and my life matters just as much as everyone else’s.

Imagine that you’re hanging at home one night and the doorbell rings. You open the door to find your neighbor Anthony in a panic. He tells you his house is on fire and he needs your help to rescue his family. Instead, you remind him that your house and family are just as important as his. He calls the fire department and while they struggle to save Anthony’s house, you keep reminding the firefighters that you and all your neighbors also have houses that are just as valuable as Anthony’s and that it’s actually unfair of them to focus all their attention on his house.

The protester in the yellow hat is an ass, but the guy is just being a dick."

depression,fe2a8px,t3_enfyh1,1578836200.0,"I don’t know if this will help anyone else the way it helped me, but I once had a therapist who hit me with a bomb that permanently rocked my thinking.

We had been talking earlier about a coworker (Charlie) who had made a really presumptuous comment toward me that had ruined me for the better part of that week. It had led to me thinking that everyone else at work hated me. She listened for a bit, then she essentially asked me how my presuming to know the thoughts of other people, to ascribe feelings to them that I have no evidence of, isn’t more presumptuous and arrogant than the thing I was upset about.

Having someone call out my bullshit as “arrogant” was such a wake-up slap. Easily, the single most helpful moment I’ve spent in therapy.

Best of luck on your journey."

KidsAreFuckingStupid,fcwhqbk,t1_fcvsc4p,1578025929.0,"I work in a museum where a LOT of kids visit with their families or their schools. It has several places where kids can draw or write. On an almost daily basis, we find kids’ pictures with stuff like “follow me on Instagram at (name).” They all want as many likes and followers as possible.

Also, I live in a state where 178  minors were identified as victims of human trafficking in 2016. Statistically, 94 percent of victims are female, 43 percent are people of color and 29 percent are age 15 or younger.

Sure, this is probably new and seemingly crazy information to you because it’s not a part of your day to day reality. Trust me when I say that it’s a huge concern for authorities."

depression,fciuwsn,t1_fcirw4h,1577670398.0,"To clarify, I was saying that we need to stop adding “you’re entitled to your opinion” to our comments/arguments/responses because it doesn’t actually mean anything. All it does is make it sound like objectively wrong ideas are just as valid as actual facts. You have no ability to keep someone from thinking a thing, but you can certainly point out that they’re objectively wrong. 

If I said that I believe Norwegian people are inferior because they are made of mud and duck poop, there’s absolutely no good reason for your reaction to be “Okay, that has merit because it’s a thing you thought up.”

We’re honestly getting stupider as a society because we give easily disproven ideas the same value as facts.

Everything you said can stand without that statement, so it’s not necessary and only serves to confuse the issue."
