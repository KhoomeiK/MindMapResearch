49ers,ffbytuj,t1_ffan89i,1579787070.0,Same w GB too
49ers,ffbypup,t1_ffbe1qp,1579786980.0,Skip is an excellent journalist and a pretty good analyst when it comes to football. Stephen A is a decent analyst in general. The problem is once they got to first take they became characters instead of analysts. No idea about Max though
49ers,ffb8v88,t1_ff9wtoh,1579755441.0,I think these stats are great and tell a better picture of the teams but yards per drive don't really mean much. A better defense is going to get you shorter fields and skew the number
49ers,ff9qnf7,t1_ff76hsp,1579718851.0,This was dying down after the saints game and I don't think it would really be a big deal now if it wasn't for the fact that Kyle dialed him down after the pick vs the saints. Without that pick this is still not really in the media spotlight again
49ers,ff82ucd,t1_ff7ak8r,1579664516.0,"You're getting downvoted but you're right. We are all optimistic that ahannahan could be our BB but there's literally been only a handful of those guys in the history of the NFL. hopefully we have one of those handful but it's still too early to tell and definitely too early to hand out lifetime contracts. 

I think if we win, there will be a bunch of teams who start looking at our assistants next year, and while I don't think losing the coaches will hurt terribly on its own, it will make it harder to get players that fit out system because there will be more teams looking for those same kinds of players. Once that happens, we will see if Kyle is going to be our BB or not"
49ers,ff820el,t1_ff73zzb,1579663907.0,Well if it makes you feel any better I definitely feel the same about Kyle and never felt that way about harbaugh
49ers,ff81l04,t1_ff6tbub,1579663590.0,Man that was a good joke I don't know why they hatin on him for it
49ers,ff8097w,t1_ff7evji,1579662633.0,yeah 12 to 14 isn't that far off. I think you start hitting a debate around 9 or so and those QBs all have flaws in their game
49ers,ff509mk,t1_ff4785z,1579576780.0,"I would say the niners give very similar looks as well but will run vastly different runs from the same post snap read as well as dress it up with a ton of pre snap movement. So while you look at ten pre snap you can know exactly what is coming, you can be told the niners are going to be rushing on the next play, given a specific look, and still have no idea what is coming"
49ers,ff4k2cl,t1_ff4izzo,1579565507.0,Don't forget Bourne. He likes to hit too
MadeMeSmile,ff222w8,t1_ff1w5l6,1579491709.0,"Speak for your own! I loved when my little girl got the hiccups because she would always get them while she was crying, get confused, and stop for a long while"
49ers,ff1p0t3,t1_ff1omp0,1579482988.0,Man they are so upset hahahahahahaha
49ers,ff1op45,t3_er3n7k,1579482786.0,Greeny said the niners were better but there's no way they are 37-8 better. Welp!
49ers,ff1k6lo,t1_ff1jvbj,1579480495.0,It might be something where taking steps causes the elbow to move which could hurt like crazy if it's a dislocation for instance
49ers,fexijb7,t1_fex8qre,1579431560.0,"Well I just think if one of them got injured we'd increase the amount ofb12 and 21 we play. I think Richie would see some uptick but the majority would go to te , but you're right Pettis might get the fall especially if it's a multi game injury"
49ers,fewthzr,t3_eqrodi,1579419252.0,"First things first. If you're going to make an appreciation thread, at least spell his name right! It's Jimmie, not Jimmy!"
49ers,fevohvg,t1_fevg7wx,1579399708.0,He's still behind Richie James Jr too
49ers,fev7sv1,t1_feuu9fh,1579394211.0,He played 14 games last year?
49ers,fev75i8,t1_fev43jy,1579393919.0,2 out of Sanders deebo and bourne
49ers,fesrh6w,t1_feshjts,1579368242.0,I hope you're right but I just get the feeling they won't want to give up on him just yet. He's a 2nd round pick and one of shanny's guys.
49ers,fesr62r,t1_fesicif,1579368143.0,Lol I got autocorrected first one was supposed to be Rodgers'
49ers,fesfdld,t1_fesewe2,1579364562.0,But how it affects Rodgers not about his legacy
49ers,fesaaqo,t1_feryghv,1579363179.0,Rodgers's or Rodgers's*
49ers,fes66m4,t1_fepncb4,1579361868.0,"You don't spy when you play zone, which we usually do"
49ers,fes4fsn,t1_feqjo3j,1579361320.0,"But that should be elite, not just really good, going off of that single stat."
49ers,fes491p,t1_fepvhl4,1579361250.0,Nobody cares about tackles... Rodgers is one of the best QBs in the league (at least historically). You really wondering why they aren't talking about joe?
49ers,fes3wk5,t1_fervjam,1579361128.0,Apparently light hasn't played since the niners game so that would make sense why he gave up 0 sacks
49ers,fep5mup,t1_fep07h3,1579312666.0,Well who do you drop besides Pettis? or go with 7?
49ers,fep1u54,t1_feomw5n,1579310251.0,Tell that to the Ravens Titans and all the teams we beat all year
49ers,feoz92g,t1_feox43q,1579308615.0,"As well as he's played I can see Bourne not making the team next year. Assuming we keep Sanders, we have him deebo and hurd if healthy being virtual locks. Richie James provides more special teams ability, Trent Taylor would likely be our starting slot (again if healthy) and I don't think the FO is quite ready to give up on Pettis. Unless we keep 7, Bourne might be out, but I hope it's him over Pettis.  That also assumes we don't go after anyone in the draft that shows promise"
49ers,feox07i,t1_feopzge,1579307220.0,Hopefully we get hurd back next year. Back injuries are no joke :(
49ers,fene4df,t1_fen566x,1579282731.0,I think Rodgers will go down as the best QB in this era but In no way is he and will he ever get close to Brady in terms of greatest. Either way a win here wouldn't change anything so I don't think the pats fans care about Rodgers losing
49ers,fendnjw,t1_felcddp,1579282446.0,I can't say I've listened to him recently but when he was on ESPN he was rarely right
49ers,fen4opn,t1_fen3y5v,1579276899.0,Haha that's awesome
49ers,fen00ya,t1_fem2hrb,1579273906.0,Well I guessed that much but why? For example the Seahawks are the roots because of a sign Joe Staley's daughter made
49ers,fem1qaz,t1_fehwty7,1579236911.0,Why is he Aron Roger?
49ers,felxisj,t1_feik3oe,1579233441.0,But now that guy will be armstead most likely
49ers,fel7ql9,t1_fej734u,1579215874.0,"He's probably the weakest link at this point. That's just how good our team is though. I feel like the only thing teams can really capitalize on is the couple of bonehead throws he makes a game, although even that is going away recently. Only other possibility is the run defense but we just completely shut down the vikes in that respect too."
49ers,fekz3m1,t1_fekt3r8,1579210598.0,I didn't just heard people saying that. Reason why I asked
49ers,fekrt7i,t1_fekotl4,1579206279.0,He does... Just for the nba
49ers,fekrir7,t1_feknscx,1579206111.0,Wasn't the arrest warrant for slapping a cop on the butt as a celebration?
49ers,fejpwen,t1_fejm2ol,1579182807.0,"Yeah man hate the team all you want it's a gorgeous piece of architecture


Edit: app to all"
49ers,fegipgc,t1_fefu3f7,1579093995.0,Yeah the line was solid but we definitely needed an edge to pull it all together and we ended up getting 1.5 for this season (with Ford's health issues). No way we get that with Jimmy g at qb because he probably pulls out at least a couple of those wine
49ers,fedosle,t1_fedmw4d,1579016629.0,Tackles implies both were out when both started and one played the entire game
nba,fecjqjf,t1_fecg2ap,1578975590.0,It's definitely not that exact and it's not the same for every person. It's a guideline for people to try to figure out what works best for them
49ers,fecho4w,t1_fea657z,1578974157.0,Is the one up top official? They usually put a orange marker on both sides but only one of those is official too. It's possible the line to gain is the orange line or even further back of that one was the unofficial
49ers,fech5fq,t1_fec3lmb,1578973805.0,No? I remember most people wanted bosa but assumed Arizona would take him so the choice people were arguing about was QW vs Josh Allen?
49ers,fec56a5,t1_fec3r0r,1578966812.0,They do. There's likely and unlikely incentives. Likely count towards the current year cap and if you miss them you get refunded next year. Unlikely don't count this year but if you hit them they count next year.  Either way it's not a way to get around the cap
spaceporn,fe7hx7i,t1_fe6ufc4,1578914726.0,They calculated it wrong and this is for a generic star not a specific one
spaceporn,fe7hazl,t1_fe79hi8,1578914445.0,Wait what? Can you explain that a bit more?what would it look like?
49ers,fe684f6,t1_fe68020,1578883879.0,No he's not. They won by 20
49ers,fe61ceq,t1_fe60cib,1578879587.0,Well you were definitely wrong lol
49ers,fe5r7dx,t1_fe4lwg7,1578873425.0,Ford is definitely helpful but having tartt and Kwon definitely helped coverage. I wouldn't give this stat just to Ford personally but he definitely shouldn't be released lol
49ers,fe4te26,t1_fe4pcf7,1578862628.0,Titans for me. The less we see running QBs the better
49ers,fe3fvr4,t1_fe347ua,1578848901.0,I very much doubt that. We decimated the Packers already and beat the Seahawks with a less healthy team. Maybe the random person will pick against us but the general consensus will be niners to the bowl
49ers,fe0ys2w,t1_fe0j1n9,1578820460.0,Doesn't even matter to me I think Kyle should get it hsnds down. My only point was that today's games shouldn't have any impact
49ers,fe0eux8,t1_fdysciq,1578812156.0,I'd say it was good reffing. Let the play go and sort it out in replay
49ers,fe0egbe,t1_fdzodai,1578811858.0,It was towards the end. The broadcast kept showing Zettel like he got it but it was solly. Sorry no video
49ers,fe0e9wh,t1_fdzyx2j,1578811705.0,7 point spread is a big one you just hope cousins has his garbage time magic and gets the game close in the last minutes
49ers,fe0dx0j,t1_fe07avj,1578811306.0,Sounds like he reinjured it or injured another part or his knee
49ers,fe0dj30,t1_fdzfuht,1578810875.0,Then we probably don't have bosa
49ers,fe0dfyg,t1_fdzf4cn,1578810781.0,Might be that he doesn't trust his body after the injury
49ers,fe0d7rn,t1_fe07011,1578810537.0,Do we have enough? I remember something about not having enough numbers for someone because we have too many retired or something but I don't remember which position group it was
49ers,fe0czlt,t1_fe0688d,1578810292.0,"Jeez the man is only 22 and has played less than 2 seasons. Give him a bit more time before comparing him to harden (who has actually performed well in the playoffs and just choked away important moments, not played bad entire games his whole career)"
49ers,fe0c5j2,t1_fe00ylf,1578809393.0,I didn't hear his actual pick but will Cain has been saying that the best chance for an upset was vikings over niners. Mostly because of his lack of faith in garoppolo (in his weekly top 5 QB rankings he didn't even consider Garoppolo but did consider the remaining 7)
49ers,fe0bb3a,t1_fe00uwk,1578808546.0,It's regular season only though isn't it?
49ers,fe07c81,t1_fdzmpsj,1578804976.0,How would you define it? I'd argue last year was a closer team than any under harbough
49ers,fe0732m,t1_fdzqi7u,1578804769.0,Fwiw get up isn't really a debate show. It's more like sports center by greeny with a bit of debate thrown in every once in a while
49ers,fe06xmv,t1_fdzdlg7,1578804645.0,"Doubtful they never pick against the spread on get up. The image someone posted with expert picks was however

Edit: although maybe they did this time. Missed it Friday"
49ers,fe01wrh,t1_fdzk11z,1578801024.0,I wouldn't call anyone a clown for picking Minn plus points but Minn to win? Nah that was dumb
49ers,fe01rf9,t1_fdzwms5,1578800921.0,It wasn't just Jimmy g going down. We had a ton of important injuries last year right off the bat. Healthy we probably would have been between 7 and 10 wins.  Our defense would have not been this good though. Dee Ford and Nick bosa have elevated the D to levels we never would have thought last year
49ers,fe01d9e,t1_fdzwx4o,1578800660.0,Five thirty eight?
49ers,fdzwnn1,t1_fdzrvof,1578797595.0,I'd be hella interested if you find it
49ers,fdzrtkg,t1_fdzqp7e,1578794305.0,"I highly doubt they have a larger one than the cowboys... You got a stat for that somewhere?

Either way though there's a reason national media talks about east coast and Central teams more than west coast. They talk about what rates better and more people nationally want to hear about those teams more. Doesn't necessarily have to be fans if the team."
49ers,fdzkzwm,t1_fdzh18r,1578791182.0,Yep right before bosas last one
49ers,fdzja24,t1_fdzj1t2,1578790749.0,Definitely. Nobody nationally cares about the west coast teams. Packers are a larger draw than the Seahawks by a mile
49ers,fdz324y,t1_fdz2tzj,1578786176.0,I agree. Seems like collinsworth is right and Kyle is protecting garoppolo
49ers,fdz1fkp,t3_encukr,1578785731.0,Make a fuckin wish!
49ers,fdypxwl,t3_encukr,1578782400.0,Garoppolo with the garoppolo. Hopefully he got it out of his system...
49ers,fdypm77,t1_fdyov0z,1578782286.0,Physical attributes
49ers,fdyhu1w,t1_fdyhn28,1578779968.0,7 plays? Naw
49ers,fdy25ou,t1_fdxh4ul,1578775246.0,No I remember the same thing. He has been on the roster and it was just whether or not he was going to be one of the 46
49ers,fdxdpvy,t1_fdw7squ,1578767708.0,That's not bold!
49ers,fdxcrp4,t1_fdx1v4e,1578767489.0,Not just NFL it's all game threads for every sport
49ers,fdtrip8,t1_fdreozm,1578721071.0,It's because of the quarterback. Ravens have the MVP. Jimmy G is not at that level of recognition. They're just going with who they think is the best QB because that's the easiest position for fans to follow
jalenandjacoby,fdq8nab,t3_emodu5,1578659365.0,I was just about to post this
aww,fdo5yor,t1_fdo129h,1578599481.0,I didn't say it bothers me at all. I asked if the running water was necessary. The person I responded to said it was. I asked if that's true since most outdoor bird baths don't have that. Just trying to satisfy my curiosity
aww,fdo0fam,t1_fdnyave,1578596549.0,I don't but my wife does. So do people in certain parts of the world and everyone until relatively recently
aww,fdny0gd,t1_fdntcw2,1578595147.0,I take it you haven't heard of a bath tub?
49ers,fdnup0s,t1_fdntr71,1578593210.0,The 3 lb positions in out offense are interchangeable according to Saleh
49ers,fdnrp72,t1_fdnlmdz,1578591487.0,"Until a few weeks ago I thought it might be breida. He's a rfa and someone might pay more than we would be willing to spend to get him, but with his lower production the past few games that might not be as big of a concern"
aww,fdngefz,t1_fdne8j5,1578585248.0,"Do birds care about the running water though? Most outside bird baths are baths, not showers"
Justfuckmyshitup,fdneeaw,t1_fdl78ke,1578584027.0,1 got one of the most fucked up lines I've seen in a while...
Justfuckmyshitup,fdne06s,t1_fdm3hiv,1578583785.0,Nah the flat top is fine. That line is a completely different story
49ers,fdm6idf,t1_fdlevv6,1578540996.0,"Least snaps typically go to SAM.  MIKE and WILL stay on the field in nickel packages. That said, Saleh said that all the lb positions are essentially interchangeable so we will probably see both Kwon and Dre out there with Warner both together and with just Warner"
49ers,fdm50wm,t1_fdlwea8,1578539954.0,"You're mixing up or conflating team friendly with home town discount.  Team friendly is basically just below market value over the contract length. Home town discount is taking a below market deal to stay with your current team.

I do think you're right though. McKinnons deal wasn't team friendly just because of the out, and especially since it was front loaded and he didn't play."
49ers,fdksa1i,t1_fdjvz6t,1578510100.0,Everybody is starting to hop on this train now but I still feel like people are underrating his value
49ers,fdibq07,t1_fdib8xq,1578439344.0,I was under the impression that they said you can't reinjure the calf and it turned into the much worse Achilles
tumblr,fdgmhkn,t1_fdfe6ra,1578402268.0,"How many hours do you work in a day/week? Most people with a schedule work 8 plus a lunch break, and if you're home by 3 when leaving by 8 you just have it better."
