>Who does he name as a supreme court judge nominee? A moderate republican.

He named 2 nominees after conservative Owen Brady died. The moderately liberal and elderly Chief Justice Roy Ashland also retired to make way for Bartlet to appoint a more liberal justice in his place that would be there longer.

Bartlet named moderate Republican Christopher Mulready to appease Republicans and get them on board with also confirming the even further left liberal Evelyn Baker Lang to the Chief Justice position.

Ashland was reaching the age of either retirement or dying soon anyway, and had he not retired then to allow Bartlet to appoint Lang, the court would have had absolutely no liberal justices left at all. Only moderates and conservatives.

It was a long term plan to ensure a liberal presence on the court, while ensuring that it actually happened. If Bartlet would have appointed Lang to replace Brady, the Senate would have rejected her appointment and the whole thing would have fallen apart and the court would have gone completely conservative."

That most carriers basically give away for free when you have a contract with them. My wife and I get brand new phones ever year because with our plan we get free upgrades and any phone we want to lease is like $5-10 a month. 

Slap on $10 a month for insurance and the cost of the phone is absolutely negligible."

television,fggu9rk,t1_fggtgi9,1580769703.0,">in response to a Freedom of Information Act request filed by the Associated Press, the Defense Department released 2,300 pages of documents which were reported to indicate:[\[31\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Tillman#cite_note-newDetails-31)  
>  
>There has never been evidence of enemy fire found on the scene, and no members of Tillman's group had been hit by enemy fire.  
>  
>The three-star general who withheld details of Tillman's death from his parents for a number of months told investigators approximately 70 times that he had a bad memory and could not recall details of his actions.  
>  
>Army attorneys sent each other congratulatory e-mails for keeping criminal investigators at bay as the Army conducted an internal friendly-fire investigation that resulted in administrative, or non-criminal, punishments.  
>  
>Army doctors told the investigators that Tillman's wounds suggested murder because ""the medical evidence did not match-up with the scenario as described.""[\[31\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Tillman#cite_note-newDetails-31)

That was from the DoD themselves, through a FOIA request. The Army doctors that say his body said it looked like Murder, and the Army attorneys were congratulating each other for the coverup.

> On April 24, 2007, Specialist Bryan O'Neal, the last soldier known to see Pat Tillman alive, testified before the [House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Oversight_and_Government_Reform) that he was warned by superiors not to divulge information that a fellow soldier killed Tillman, especially to the Tillman family. Later, Pat Tillman's brother Kevin Tillman, who was also in the convoy traveling behind his brother at the time of the 2004 incident in Afghanistan but did not witness it, testified that the [military](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military) tried to spin his brother's death to deflect attention from emerging failings in the Afghan war.

television,fggsvo6,t1_fggs0ou,1580768812.0,"Nope. It was his own platoon.

He was shot 3 times in the head from less than 10 yards away by someone in his own platoon. And the Pentagon covered it up for weeks.

Members of his unit burned his flak jacket and helmet to cover it up as well.

It's likely that he was murdered by his own unit purposefully because he had an anti-war and anti-Bush stance, and was going to meet with Noam Chomsky after returning from deployment."
television,fggnujz,t1_fgglsjf,1580765743.0,Of course he would. He was killed by his own unit.

I just went with Sam Adams because they're the biggest player in the Craft beer world, and even as what people consider craft changes the CBA purposefully words it to include Sam Adams due to everything they've done for the Craft world. 

Also, You see Sam Adams at literally every bar in America. Sierra Nevada is common but still hard to find sometimes, especially something like Torpedo or Narwhal (which I have not found in a bar outside of California). 

And Sam Adams has done some beers that made people just say ""what the fuck is this"" like the Cherry Wheat."
