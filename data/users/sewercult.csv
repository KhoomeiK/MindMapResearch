They’re extremely similar but they’re both SO similar that they’re too focused on justice. Neither one of them knows when to stop.They both want to do what’s right for the people. 

But who’s to say? It looks like Kogami has changed since the sinners movie so that could be something in their favor. The thing is they’re so similar they wouldn’t stop each other. Like Kogami understands Akane has to do ___ and vice versa. TBH i could really see Ginoza being the one to stop Akane when she’s pushing herself too far. Its complicated, I  ship akane x Kogami BUT ALSO akane x ginoza so *shrug*. At the moment I see no one getting together."
