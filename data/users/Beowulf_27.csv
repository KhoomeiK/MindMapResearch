predental,ff3105p,t1_ff2afon,1579530790.0,The way he acted I don’t think he cares about the money. It’s more about being the best there is. Money just comes with it.
predental,ff30xy4,t1_feszkic,1579530740.0,Right? Smh I didn’t even get to thank the doctor for letting me shadow him. He just smiled and gave a thumbs up as started running in the other direction.
predental,fepc48m,t1_fep8oi9,1579316898.0,You definitely point some good points! I meant no disrespect to the Dentist. I’m just in awe I guess haha
predental,feoweit,t1_feorqdq,1579306849.0,"Haha yeah I was in awe the entire time. To him it was like a art form tbh. Like a dance he did and couldn’t lose tempo. 

I personally would want to have a more personal relationship with my patients haha 

I’ve got another dentist I am shadowing next week that is much older and seems more personal and family oriented. First thing on his website is a picture of him with his golden retriever haha"
predental,feow3sw,t1_feonktu,1579306672.0,Okay I will look into those! Thank you!
predental,feow1p1,t1_feogedo,1579306635.0,Yeah definitely I am shadowing someone else next week
AppleWatch,fejhq8i,t3_epc42p,1579174775.0,Wow that’s really neat! Do you have the link for the black sport loop?
dentaladmissiontest,feing0h,t1_fein5ew,1579142628.0,Oh okay good! Thanks for letting me know
predental,feilx0r,t3_epc73f,1579141604.0,"I took on an unpaid research position as a sophomore in my spring semester. By summer the professor started paying me 4 hours every week. I also got a job tutoring and working in the IT department on campus. Now as a junior I just got published and get paid 25 hours every week while being a full time student. Research went up to 7 hours every week. It’s all about time management and picking the correct opportunities. 

In my opinion a research position doesn’t open up that often while it is much easier to get a random job."
dentaladmissiontest,feilgxp,t3_ep8xpz,1579141299.0,I think if you don’t go you automatically get a 0. There should be an option to cancel it.

college,feil5ww,t3_ep1or8,1579141090.0,Not at IU where I’ve seen soda cheaper than a bottle of water
AppleWatch,fe6esw8,t1_fe6e4x1,1578888766.0,"I actually just paired it earlier today. 

It seems to be working now. I don’t know what I did but I guess third time is charm"
BlackPeopleTwitter,fdwcv2w,t3_en6bui,1578757447.0,Universal Healthcare where you at?
AppleWatch,fdnelxe,t1_fdmgzgn,1578584158.0,This is it! Make sure the watch is on tight enough and correctly so it can measure your heart rate. Sometimes if it is too loose it can’t get an accurate read.
bose,fdlxo5o,t3_em15la,1578534968.0,Don’t worry none of the apps work on iOS anyways
iPhonePhotography,fdk2591,t3_elm3g7,1578494194.0,Wow this is literally perfect! You even got a few stars in the sky. What time did you take the picture? Was it a little after sunset?
college,fdh6jjd,t1_fdgp59p,1578416453.0,Oh gosh seems like a nightmare to go through and sort it out
college,fdg0byu,t1_fdfun3d,1578375452.0,Yeah definitely but she is pretty strict about stuff. I’m surprised she even changed mine. She has a one week policy where after that she won’t change grades at all. She also strictly believes in no curves or percentages. Her class is based entirely on points brackets.
college,fdfqr93,t1_fdfpa2m,1578367930.0,Yeah it’s probably worse thinking you got a great score and then having it change after the holidays. Well I guess they were able to celebrate
college,fdfqlyw,t1_fdfqc6w,1578367835.0,Yeah I know it’s wrong but I kinda hope the prof doesn’t change their grade. It doesn’t help that I know exactly who the person is.
college,fdfqi92,t1_fdfpbfh,1578367770.0,Thank you! It’s such a relief after waiting all break to see my exam.

DentalSchool,fcojwt1,t3_ei3dja,1577834089.0,Just stop by and ask the receptionist to confirm your shadowing date with the dentist.
bose,fcojt2d,t3_ei6jo2,1577834013.0,Between Bose and Sony it ultimately comes down to comfort relative to your head shape haha. One thing to keep in mind is the touch features both have. I personally am not a fan and those prefer the QCs.
creepy,fck6m88,t1_fcjjzok,1577718052.0,You can find the info for tours on their website. Though you can to plan way in advance as they do a background check on you too.
creepy,fcftyb4,t1_fcaseox,1577633746.0,"In school we got a tour of the facilities and it’s super cool! They talked about this site though we didn’t visit it. At the time they were slamming Tesla’s into walls to see how safe they were and to make sure the battery doesn’t explode. They also pointed out a biology research building that no humans are allowed in as robots are working with super viruses/bacteria that they do not have the vaccine/antibiotic for. 

It’s crazy a place like this exist! I think there are 16 or 26 of the national labs in the country. Right out of a sci-fi movie."
insanepeoplefacebook,fcfo1rn,t1_fcdqvaz,1577632120.0,Yup different structure but same epitopes for binding. So it actually blocks estrogen binding sites and thus reducing effects of normal estrogen.
insanepeoplefacebook,fcfnjx3,t3_eh2f4l,1577631975.0,It’s phytoestrogen which actually blocks estrogen and makes you “more manly”
insanepeoplefacebook,fcfn7jn,t1_fcctpt6,1577631924.0,Also phytoestrogens blocks real estrogen from binding to its receptors which of you follow the logic makes you less of a girl and more of a man
bose,fc92hcp,t3_egr7et,1577545959.0,I updated and I genuinely think the NC got better if not the same. You are aware that the news article originally claiming the downgrade in NC was retracted due to false claims when retested. That article got all this placebo stuff going around about Bose.
college,fc91oug,t3_egmf35,1577545599.0,If you wanted to get him caught you should have persuaded him to tell the professor what he did and how he should quit.
bose,fc7l71n,t1_fc7hmxp,1577511020.0,Of course glad you got it working!
bose,fc7fhek,t1_fc7eyxm,1577505854.0,Yeah the last Android phone I had was at the start of the decade. I’m afraid I can not offer any more advice. Maybe someone with a more recent android can help out
bose,fc7evz3,t3_eglon3,1577505355.0,If you are referring to the google or Alexa assistants there exist notification settings in their respective apps. If you are referring to the phone then you have to use the phones notifications settings. If you have a iPhone switching on the mute/silent eliminates the notification sound or put the phone on do not disturb.
iphone,fc77yqb,t1_fc6xucx,1577499941.0,^^^^its true ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
ipad,fc77cbh,t3_egfi9p,1577499477.0,Best Buy has the same deal right now. Though they removed the $649 64gb 2018 iPad Pro and it’s back to $799.
ipad,fc779yg,t1_fc6scer,1577499429.0,Actually Best Buy has the same deal right now
predental,fc7720x,t3_egkj0b,1577499267.0,Congrats! That has to be the best feeling ever haha. Time to start planning!

iOS13,fc3zewk,t1_fc3yl6v,1577402596.0,I restarted my phone and it’s fixed now haha
iOS13,fc3bg71,t1_fc3awvv,1577386077.0,On the share sheet after selecting photos there is a options button at the top by the X. If you press options it gives you the option to airdrop edits and other data along with the photos.
iOS13,fc37n6j,t1_fc2mjqd,1577383424.0,If it’s via airdrop I think you have to select the option to include all data. Then you can edit the portrait. I might be wrong though.
bose,fc1bk0h,t3_efk0t8,1577313854.0,Congrats! What’s a Bose Sanctuary giveaway?
AskReddit,fbzb1be,t1_fbz7s4a,1577240749.0,I know my curiosity got the best of me

college,fbz9ykc,t3_ef5oc4,1577239745.0,Ok
AskReddit,fbz6w51,t1_fbywgfn,1577236941.0,Gosh I wish I stopped myself before reading it. Now I can’t stop imagining it
