AmItheAsshole,ff30mam,t3_erd3i7,1579530477.0,"NTA. How have you not met her? If she's such a good friend then why aren't you all hanging out together often from the beginning?

My ex and his girlfriend are both good friends of mine. He and I had been broken up for a while and were roommates when he started dating her. From day one I've made sure she knew him and I are just close friends now. Last year they bought a house together and I got to help them paint and move in. Last week they had a baby and I was one of the first people to meet her. There's nothing wrong with continuing a friendship with an ex but friends don't exclude significant others."

Austin,feyonp5,t1_feybf8j,1579448399.0,I sent the link to this post to some of my friends who foster in Austin. Sending lots of warm wishes to you and yours.
SexWorkersOnly,feydd78,t3_eqsw63,1579444085.0,How sad that this fact isn't common knowledge. I was telling a group of young adults at a bar that condoms don't prevent herpes or hpv and not a single one of them knew that. Sex ed is dangerously lacking in so many parts of the world.
Austin,feyb38l,t1_fey832p,1579443162.0,Austin Pets Alive is a wonderful organization. I'm so sorry about your loss.
interestingasfuck,fell8zl,t1_felesio,1579224862.0,Many albino animals have yellow or orange coloration. Lots of animals that are solid white and called albino are actually leucistic.
interestingasfuck,fel0pjy,t1_fekzjyn,1579211559.0,Possibly but without probing them there's no way to tell for sure when they're that young. The iguanas pictured are juveniles.

TrueOffMyChest,fejkiyq,t3_ephnkf,1579177961.0,"Don't expect them to react a certain way. All victims respond differently to being raped. She may want to talk about it, she may not. Many people get uncomfortable listening to a victim tell their story, if she does talks to you about what happened try not to show too much anger or any other extreme emotion. Your friend will need lots of time to start to heal from this, they will also need lots of support that doesn't run out just because she's not ""over"" it quickly enough. You're a good friend to look for advice on this awful topic."
BadChoicesGoodStories,fehrnzi,t3_ejet2o,1579122524.0,"I honestly don't see how this is any more invasive than grooming. They use nontoxic products, they are up there for 3 hours (which is how long many groomers take for these breeds anyway) and the dogs aren't restrained in any way different than regular grooming. It's weird for sure but I think costumes for pets are all weird. Not cruel just weird."

Outreach animals are often removed from their parents so they are better with the public."
WTF,fedfiu3,t1_federf1,1579010128.0,"Saving the environment is fun. Importing iguanas as pets is just a horrible idea all around. They need so much room, proper humidity, correct lighting and heating, a varied diet, plus they can be really aggressive. Iguanas are often purchased as impulse buys and there are no rescues with room to take any (at least in my state)."

WTF,fedatv4,t1_fed99yh,1579006019.0,"Fun fact, raising iguanas for food instead of cattle in central and South America helps the environment. Iguana farms like this are also where pet iguanas come from that are imported to the United States."

aww,fdqlbzs,t1_fdql86i,1578669422.0,His post history says otherwise but let's hope for sake of those poor kittens that he watches that video and takes it to heart.
aww,fdql56v,t1_fdq82sm,1578669296.0,He has an unaltered male. This litter was intentional.
aww,fdql06z,t1_fdqhjkh,1578669201.0,Downvote away. Dude intentionally bred his cats so he could have kittens while hundreds-thousands of kittens die every day across the country. This post is the opposite of awe.
aww,fdqkrk4,t1_fdqf3p9,1578669041.0,He also has an unaltered male cat. He most likely bred them intentionally.
aww,fdqhjkh,t3_empj0f,1578666827.0,There are so many kittens dying in shelters and on the streets here in  Arizona that now when I see these kinds of posts I just get sad. I don't even find them cute anymore because it's so heartbreaking.

holdmyfeedingtube,fdknjrf,t1_fdkifl4,1578507275.0,I have no love for the police but seriously that guy had a loaded rifle walking through a family neighborhood. The officer disarmed the guy without shooting and the guy lived. I honestly think the cop made a good call in this instance.

Edit* it's illegal to breed them. If they are not the same gender, you'll need to find another home for one of them."
