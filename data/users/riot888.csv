ConanExiles,fei0pcx,t1_feh8i7p,1579127749.0,They did say that they had hit the map limits. I can only take their word for it. They literally stated that and the way forward was working on density.

LifeProTips,fcmv8vd,t3_ehyhgx,1577793873.0,"We have top up insurance. It is over 4 years. If our car gets written off then it pays out the difference between what the insurance pays out and what we paid for the car.

We first took it out on our previous car which after a year was totalled while parked unattended roadside. The guy stopped and admitted full responsibility. 

Even though he admitted fault our insurance still paid out Â£2000 less than we paid for the car. Our top up insurance looked through the claim and then within a week they transferred the Â£2000 to our account.

The top up cost us Â£300 for the 4 years so that's what we were out of pocket.

Based on that experience we will always get top up insurance as even if we don't claim over the next four years we are in pocket overall."
