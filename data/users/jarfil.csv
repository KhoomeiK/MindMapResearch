techsupportmacgyver,ffdop7x,t1_ffdik6t,1579825373.0,"That really depends on how the multi-GPU rig is set up, but generally speaking GPUs have multiple ground connections. The voltage difference between the grounds of the PSUs should only be transient (otherwise you'd have a whole different problem), so it's more about having some not-too-flimsy and redundant paths for them to get to the same level.

If you have the SSD hooked up to a different PSU than the MB, then one of the possible paths ""should"" be: PSU1 ground, MB ground plane, SATA data cable ground, SSD data connector ground, SSD common ground, SSD power connector ground, SATA power cable ground, PSU2 ground... and that ""should"" be enough, so you could have no other ground connections and it ""could"" work.

But one thing is what ""should"" and ""could"" work, and another is what actually will. If for any reason that path gets broken, like a bad SATA cable, a broken connector, or whatever other reason... and you just happen to have a ground differential like maybe you touched one of the PSUs or the case with your hand... the next path could become: PSU1 ground, MB ground plane, MB SATA controller **chip**, SATA data cable A wire, SSD data connector A wire, SSD controller **chip**, SSD common ground, SSD power connector ground, SATA power cable ground, PSU2 ground... and now you're risking blowing up some of the chips on either the MB, the SSD or both.

The adapter you're using for the PSUs does have a ground cable, so that's good, but you're basically trusting that single cable, plus your ""MB, SATA cable and SSD"", to have no faulty ground connections so no surges can fry any of the chips.

Based on how many silly failures I've seen over the years, and how sensitive 3.3V electronics are, I'd feel better if you had like 3 or 4 ground paths between those PSUs instead of just 1 or 2.

For example, I'd be similarly concerned about a GPU mining rig set up with some of those PCIe-over-USB cable adapters hooked up to different PSUs and no other ground connection between them... but if the adapters were hooked up to the same PSU as the MB, while only the GPU's additional power was connected to a second PSU, then I'd be less concerned."

If there is, even for a moment, current will flow through the path of least resistance, which should be that cable... but if that cable fails, the next path could lead through the SSD and motherboard, and you *really* don't want that to happen.

Having both PSUs connected to the same UPS is not necessarily a guarantee that the internal grounds will match. Ground in a wall socket is often a ""safety ground"", which is not really a ground, just a way to detect whether there is any current leaking to the case of a device directly connected to it. An UPS may or may not (depends on the design) let that safety ground pass through, and the PSU may or may not let it pass to the case and/or to the ""ground"" pin on the internal connectors (actually, it shouldn't).

It's a common misconception that ""all ground is ground"". While it may be convenient as a simplification from a single circuit design point of view, and anything case-side from a PSU should probably share the same ground, isolating transformers are called that precisely because they don't (shouldn't) let any of the inputs to be directly connected to any of the outputs, including ground."
