brasil,fdgm0m7,t1_fc6b3t4,1578401835.0,"Não. Comecei direto no 2 mesmo. Me interessei depois de ver o review do AVGN no YouTube. O que mais me chamou a atenção foi o texto do jogo (trabalho com localização de jogos, então tô sempre avaliando as traduções) e também a trilha sonora. Quando eu terminar, procurarei os outros títulos da série."
DQBuilders,fdfm8tw,t3_el3ipe,1578364960.0,"After finishing DQB2 on PS4, I got Terraria on Steam and I'm lovin' it too. I played Minecraft for some time but I definitely liked Terraria more. It has a lot of variety in mobs, weapons and also NPCs who occasionally appear to help you in some way. You've got build houses for them. I'm still at the beginning but I'm liking it so far. Definitely recommend."

brasil,fc650ah,t3_egbmog,1577472411.0,"1. Se achar que está com depressão, não hesite em procurar ajuda ou se informar sobre o problema. Hoje em dia, é fácil a gente ouvir ""Ah, é tudo frescura!"" ou ""Vira homem!"", mas saúde mental é um negócio sério e eu vejo que poucas pessoas dão a devida atenção por se acostumarem a uma situação ruim.
2. Coma alimentos ricos em fibra e beba água. Ficar sem cagar por muito tempo é horrível."
depression,fc5ilfc,t3_eg5und,1577458599.0,"Humans are very insecure. It won't get better. We are always scared of something.  
I try to accept my fears and most of the time they are not so scary as I thought."
depression,fc5i492,t3_eg1ib1,1577458228.0,"Yes. Most people don't understand depression and think you just have to 'man up' or just don't want to hang out with a depressive person.  
If you are lucky to know someone who would understand your condition, then maybe you could try opening up to them. It's rare but there are some people who would be supportive. Loneliness only makes things worse."

I'm not going to say ""don't do this!"" but if you reconsider, do know that there are people here who read your story and are genuinely concerned and would do their best to help you in any way they can."
depression,fby9w3x,t3_ef4960,1577211638.0,"I'm felling the same today. I just want to stay in my apartment and do nothing. But I promised my parents that I would spend the holiday with them in some party of an old friend of theirs.

EDIT: I couldn't go... I called my mom in the last minute saying I couldn't go there and pretend that everything was fine to a bunch of people who doesn't even care that I exist. This old friend of theirs and his family are my folks people, not mine. We don't have anything in common and I would only feel more lonely there. My mother understood but my parents became very worried. I hadn't opened up about my depression to them until that point. They told me we should talk sometime soon.  
However, not all was bad. After I calmed down, my fiancée told her family would spend Christmas together. Since her mother died some years ago, her brother and father were never around for Christmas. So it was nice that this year her family was going to get together for Xmas after so many time.

I feel way more comfortable around them. I ended up bringing my PS4, we played, had some beers, talked. It was nice. I felt normal again and I think they enjoyed it too. 2019 was a shit year for my fiancée's brother and his wife too."

Enquanto isso, aparece um monte de ""cristão"" na Internet criticando especial de Natal dos Porta dos Fundos pq é ""intolerante"" e ""cristofóbico"". Tá serto."
