Concordia,ff8f68v,t3_es73hm,1579675847.0,It's really easy. Since your looking to change your specialty all you need to do is go to the student academic services office (2nd floor ev) and fill out a change of concentration form. You hand it to the receptionist and you wait to hear back. Easy peasy.
Concordia,ff5ynei,t1_ff4pko1,1579614473.0,Yeah go see student academic services and explain your situation.

KitchenConfidential,ff3b03f,t3_erdu3s,1579537668.0,Don't accept that.
Concordia,ff39haq,t3_eooknz,1579536832.0,Go to academic services and fill out the form. Just make sure the course you want to use as a substitute is on the list of equivalent courses. Couldn't tell you about courses outside of Concordia though.
Concordia,ff37h8t,t1_feilrqv,1579535514.0,Honestly if you make the effort to regularly work on personal projects (which you should be doing regardless) and attend job fairs there's a good chance you will land a job without too much difficultly. A lot of the struggle is simply landing an interview.

KitchenConfidential,fdky3pl,t1_fdks40t,1578513542.0,"Whatever you say buddy! The fact that every single on of your comments has been downvoted speaks for itself; I suppose self reflection is not your strong suit. Anyways, have a good one."
KitchenConfidential,fdkaqgu,t1_fdh4r27,1578499894.0,Of course you would; You're a piece of shit.
KitchenConfidential,fdh3nkv,t1_fdh2c5f,1578414677.0,Your definition of sensible is personal to you; others may be of stronger character allowing them to continue working in the industry despite their struggles. I feel you might struggle with this idea but I encourage you take a crack at understanding it. have a nice day!
KitchenConfidential,fdh1vr6,t1_fdh02yy,1578413580.0,Nice try cunt. The number of downvotes on your patronizing comment speaks for itself. Your experience working with people in recovery accounts is personal to you and does not reflect the reality of the situation. I too have worked along side servers and bartenders who struggled with addiction and I can say that almost all had no problem doing their jobs as they were passionate about their work. Get well soon.
KitchenConfidential,fdh02xm,t1_fdflel4,1578412437.0,Id suggest blending your mash until it is silky smooth. it looks a bit dry and chunky.
KitchenConfidential,fdgzvs6,t3_el2kss,1578412310.0,"You need to blend your mash with a a lot of butter and cream until its creamy with a custard like consistency as it appears to be dry and slightly chunky. Check out Joel Robuchons mashed potato recipe; Hes a 3 star chef known for his mashed potatoes.

Id also suggest serving some of the dishes elements as sides as the plate looks a bit crowded."

KitchenConfidential,fcnwdvc,t1_fcnoiy5,1577819777.0,"Fuck off with your anti immigration dog whistles. First of all, immigrants aren't the ones who are paying people under the table and ignoring labor laws; it's your fellow American business owner. Second, you work in an industry that glorifies work exhaustion so whether you are surrounded by immigrants or not, you're still going to be working your fucking ass off. 

What do you think would happen if American business owners were to only hire people with papers?"
