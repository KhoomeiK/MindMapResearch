relationship_advice,ff9ym3s,t1_ff9xqjk,1579724304.0,"You’re welcome. It’s hard to see the truth, even when it is staring us right in the face. Because we love someone, we tend to rationalize their behavior and play it down as being less of a big deal than it is. Even when we are hurting, we want to love them through our hurt because we think it will keep the peace or make it better. In these situations, it’s best for you to take a lot of space and do things to build yourself up and heal."
relationship_advice,ff9xeki,t3_esgfzl,1579723586.0,"She isn’t sorry, she is still covering it up. She is only sorry she got caught. The friends thing is an excuse. The stalker thing is a cover up. She said you “didn’t know *yet*”. Meaning, you would have been the one feeling like a wreck after she left you. But you left first. So now she is panicking because she still felt like being a deceptive coward and wasn’t ready for your world to crash down until *she* wanted it to be. Calling you paranoid to deflect her deception onto you. 

She has clearly overstepped boundaries several times with this guy, made you feel warning signals that you let go because you’re a good partner who loved and wanted to trust her. OP, the woman you’re meant to be with will never deceive you, will never make you live a lie, will love you and hear out your feelings and concerns and validate them, not deflect and hide. I’m sorry this has happened, OP. But you need to love yourself more."

relationship_advice,ff9lio1,t1_ff8zovt,1579715522.0,He has been physical with you. They’re your friends. They love you and want you to be safe and happy. Lean on them once. You can only return the favor in your own way if you feel guilty about leaning on them for support. But please don’t. They will feel even worse knowing they could have done something to help you and you didn’t let them.
