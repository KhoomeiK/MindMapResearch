Then ultimately, anyone with half a brain can purchase one of the dozens of refillable cartridges out there and just continue using their Juul.

In all of these cases, Juul and Vuse lose profit, and that's a good thing. Seriously. Educate yourself on PM/BAT's overseas marketplace. The shit they are doing is beyond reprehensible. They aren't getting the money for the carts, which is the lion's share of their business. The hope is that this ban, which didn't hit the actual independent e-liquid manufacturers, gives those businesses a means of closing the gap. This is the purpose of regulation. It's supposed to close the gap between fair and unfair practices.

While I disagree with the reasons behind the ban, thankfully the result was much better for the industry than you would think. I'm not saying the ban is a good thing. Just that for once, the outcome of the ban accidentally landed squarely where it belongs. Anybody that's rushing out to buy bootleg carts after this ban is an idiot. Seriously.

Honestly, the ban hurting Vuse, Juul, and the other cartridge players isn't a bad thing. They really are a terrible business model. The carts are insanely wasteful, materials-wise, and they are extremely costly by volume. Plus, in Juul's case, they got caught demonstrating their product at a 9th-12th grade school assembly, including one incident where they recommended that teen smokers switch to Juul. Not that they quit, that they switch to ""totally safe, harmless, flavor and water vapor"" Juul.

[https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/09/juul-gave-presentations-in-schools-to-kids-and-the-fda-is-fuming/](https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/09/juul-gave-presentations-in-schools-to-kids-and-the-fda-is-fuming/)

The two companies doing the most harm to the people trying to switch from tobacco to vapor-related products are:

* Juul (principal investors including Altria, parent company of Phillip Morris)
* Vuse (parent company being British American Tobacco)

Same players, same tactics, same bullshit.

These two major players are trying to corner the vaping industry by maneuvering people into using their products in the same manner that they use cigarettes, which is a really big problem. They have set an anti-consumer price-point, and they have created an environment that has resulted in less choice for the consumer (being that these devices have been curated to eliminate the consumer's choice of strength of nicotine in the fluids, they have actually been pushing the market toward higher nicotine strength to make their product more addictive), and despite the cartridges of these products having an operating lifetime between five and twenty times as long as the fluid lasts, they are designed to be difficult to refill. In fact, Vuse's cartridges were once easy to disassemble and refill, but once this was discovered, Vuse redesigned them to make it even more difficult.

Put simply, Trump's administration backing down on the total e-juice flavor ban was one of the best things he could have done for the modular vape industry. It's one of the few things he's accidentally done that hasn't been the worst possible thing he could have done. I can't think of any other examples of him doing something right, but I'm sure he saw a cat once and didn't kick it, or something, and I just haven't seen it. So I'll give him more credit than I probably should and say 'few'.

EDIT: Because I know someone's gonna say ""You shouldn't be disassembling vape carts, and the company is right to want to avoid consumers doing that so they don't get sued."". The new design can still be disassembled in the same manner, but you are more likely to breach the battery in the device because it's more firmly affixed. Yes, there's a danger of chemical contaminants due to mixing flavoring agents, but Vuse already issued a global recall of their faulty batteries (far lower explosion rate than much of the chinese manufactured market) and has been sunsetting the product in favor of a more addictive variant that is more expensive by volume."

news,feu0nz6,t1_fete54t,1579381972.0,">I pointed out that I was amused that you claimed you knew what the founding fathers envisioned, when top scholars can't even agree on it. Scholars who study and research this stuff daily.

It doesn't even take much research to figure out that the framers disagreed fervently on how weapons should be regulated. However, every single discussion at the time centered on discussion on whether the formation of a federally controlled military was a gross overstep of federal powers.

Review the early constitutions of the 13 states to ratify the constitution. Pennsylvania was the only colony to explicitly permit wide-spread ownership of firearms due to the fact that the state was so dominantly Quaker, that they could not reliably form militias to protect themselves.

Any serious legal scholar recognizes that the second amendment was directly targeted at the formation of regulated state militias, and a large number of the fledgling states had very strict regulations on the ownership of firearms.

* All states but Pennsylvania kept registrars of firearms owned by the citizenry through the state militia system.
* Armed travel was prohibited in populated areas under the English Common Law system that the American colonies adopted except where certain exemptions were made. This changed shortly before the civil war in the South, when handguns first became widely available. It never changed in vast swaths of the North. Further exemptions came about when imminent threat became a reasonable exemption for armed travel. (What you would call concealed/open carry today.)
* Under the English common-law system that our legal system adopted as legal precedent, we had a duty to retreat, and not stand our ground in a self defense scenario. This remained in place until after the civil war.
* Many states in New England adopted a number of laws regarding the storage of firearms, such as prohibiting the storage of loaded firearms in Boston in 1786.
* The very notion that the founders wanted their people to be able to rebel is part true, part false. The founding fathers demanded loyalty oaths before granting the right to bear arms during the revolution. The constitution defines such an act of rebellion as treason. The founders had a variety of opinions on arms, but they more closely represented the American north's current opinions on the provision and regulation of firearms than they do the American South. The South went completely off the rails when they seceded, and it's been all kinds of fucked ever since.

The people who represent the gun lobby and parrot this Dixie-revivalist NRA nonsense are paid shills and useful rubes who misrepresent history for their own ends. There are two Americas. One that inherits faithfully the spirit of the democratic republic that the framers roughed out, and the occupied, bombed out shell of the territory soaked in the blood of slavery, only four states of which were even in the room when the revolution fucking happened.

It is clearly, irrefutably obvious (owing to the volumes these men wrote on the subject, and the laws that they ratified as their legacy) that the framers did not envision non-landed, untrained, non-serving men having weapons for their own personal enjoyment, running the streets of Boston, Philidelphia, or Richmond with military-grade weaponry on their backs shouting about the right to open-carry loaded firearms, or to bring their firearms into courthouses and city council meetings. We can look back to the very actions of the framers of the constitution, ***they actively prohibited these actions during their own time when they were the ones in power.***

Books are great, because you can read them too. You don't have to rely on what some jackass in a red lapel pin tells you to think, because you can check his homework yourself. The best part about the most influential founders of this nation, is that ***they wrote beautifully, clearly, timelessly, and abundantly a great litany of their own thoughts.***

I refer you to Alexander Hamilton's, Federalist 46, where Hamilton clearly lines out that those so armed ought be part of a well regulated militia that should assemble at least once or twice a year. He argued *against* the creation of a federally staffed army, and against the very idea that a rabble of American citizens had any hope of defeating a standing national army of the like a federally requisitioned one would undeniably become. That it would take a large number of decentralized and armed militiae to fight off such a power, and that a standing national army would be unable to defeat such a force, as England at the time would surely so attest.

No one alive at the time was so deep down the NRA rabbithole that they were even suggesting that arming the rabble without training, without registration, and without regulation, good order, and discipline was an idea that could be described as anything other than a madman's farce.

Yes, current court precedent runs counter to my interpretation, but you so quickly forget I'm not making an originalist argument. I'm using the originalist argument to prove that *the anti-regulation side can't make one.* And I'm not arguing against the current precedent, because I'm arguing for new legislation, and new precedent more closely resembling where we started as a nation before the South found a way to fuck us all for 160 years. Not because it's how it should be because it's how it was, but because how it was was actually less insane than how it is. That the system is mutable, and that we have deviated from sanity. The entire 2nd Amendment argument depends on two lies: ""It's settled"", and ""It's how we've always been"". No it isn't, and no it god damn hasn't.

The slippery slope argument is really ridiculous. If we want to use slippery slope arguments, we can argue that all laws are unjustified because eventually they are going to ban all behaviors that were once legal because they are planning to criminalize literally anything.

As for our prior weapons bans, they've been so thoroughly neutered in legislative bodies as to be rendered useless. We basically have only banned specific foreign weapons, while allowing domestic weapons through the legislation with exemptions despite having the same capabilities as the weapons banned. Or worse, left mile-wide loopholes for background checks by creating exemptions for firearms purchased from individuals or via gun shows.

The whole second amendment brigade is a complete clown show. The bans that have gone into effect are ludicrously toothless. And yet it's still a shitfight every time an attempt to close existing loopholes comes up because: ""Hurr durr, they takin' our guns!""

I'm fine with people owning firearms. What I'm not fine with is the culture of gun fetishism that America is continually bogged down by. Historically, when you crossed the pomerium, you surrendered your weapons. Civilizations restrict the unchecked possession of weaponry so that there is an inherent lawlessness to taking the matters of the law into your own hands, and that to do so is a grave threat to one's continued liberty; thus, revolt would be reserved for only the most dire of situations; rather than every single time a bunch of rednecks get antsy about bills they didn't read, or immigrants taking their jobs.

The founders never envisioned a society in which the unwashed masses were toting cannons and muskets down the streets of Philidelphia for funsies. The possession of firearms was always envisioned to be the province of the rural, the militia-man, and those who protect the urban centers that drive commerce.

The problem is not that ultimately these laws are invalid, it's that we have a loud, disconnected rural culture being manipulated by industry giants into trying to dictate how people in cities should have to live out of fear that the urbanites are going to run roughshod over them the minute they pipe down and turn the other way."

Religion can be a tool people use to help them change themselves. Too often though, it is a truncheon of forced conformity to a patriarchal, bigoted, and self-righteous social order.

personalfinance,fehq371,t1_fehp2wp,1579121619.0,"This. If your state does not require verification of guarantor, that's the end of their responsibility.

Imagine for a minute if someone were to sign as a guarantor, then decide at the last minute to welch on the deal knowing that the party they signed for was gonna breach the contract. If they were to accept a simple explanation without a law enforcement investigation into the allegation, they could wind up taking on liability for any action that they took, which could get them sued for breach of contract. Imagine if your guarantor just straight lied to get out of the contract after you fell on hard times. All of these are possibilities in this situation. I know they aren't your situation, but this is the problem with taking someone's word for it. The allegation isn't enough to compel them to act in a way that puts them at risk, and it shouldn't be.

Be aware that the people managing the leasing agreements are little more than peons, and they aren't generally the ones that own the property. They have a responsibility to the person who does own the property, so it really comes down to you giving them a legal leg to stand on to void the contract and evict her.

Threats of legal action won't help you until you have an iron-clad case of them being in the wrong, not a case of them being misled by someone else's fraudulent actions. Some people gotta learn the hard way. OP's sister in law may have made a mistake, but we don't learn the stove is hot by having our hand gently moved away from it. Sometimes you gotta let people find out for themselves that what they are doing is gonna get them burned.

Fraud is a habit that doesn't tend to be a one-off. It tends to snowball. The sooner it's caught and the lesson is burned in, the less likely it is to grow out of control and turn into a life-ruining one. If OP's sister is lucky, she pays a fine, finds a new place to live, and gets probation."

The official regulation is that soldiers are not permitted to wear their uniform in an establishment where the primary function is the consumption of alcohol. They are not forbidden from drinking in uniform. Many soldiers are not permitted to drink in uniform at all according to standing orders from their commanders, who may elect to enact stricter guidelines than the regulation.

Even more specifically, this is an Army Regulation (670-1). Nearly all services permit consumption of alcohol in dress uniform, as it is tradition that alcohol is part of military ceremony and a socially acceptable liberty activity.

Where restrictions tend to occur is with working uniforms. In the case of soldiers, drinking in ACUs is not allowed, but drinking in PT uniform during work days was at one time commonplace. In other instances, the consumption of alcohol in service dress for all services is normal. And many bases do not restrict the consumption of alcohol while wearing duty uniforms where the purpose of the function is not solely the consumption of alcohol.

The Air Force has the most permissive rules regarding consumption of alcohol in uniform, yet one of the strictest cultures regarding alcohol-related behavioral incidents. I've worked multiple shops in my time in the service where I was being handed beers by my superiors while still on the clock on a Friday. It's not really the enforcement that is selective, it's that the rules are themselves intended to be elective according to the chain of command.

**Also, your example of police and federal agents is egregiously incorrect.**

Alcohol use is in no way prohibited for police or federal agents. What is frowned upon is ""impaired judgement"". If an officer or agent becomes impaired in such a way that it affects their job duties, or gives reason to question their moral authority, they can be dismissed. The regulations are deliberately vague to allow them to be applied to the real world.

The problem is not the hypocrisy of how we treat alcohol. The problem is that we treat drugs as a ""the book is law"" situation. Yes, our leniency on alcohol use is an example of that hypocrisy, but the leniency itself isn't the issue.

I get your meaning, but your examples don't work because they aren't accurate."
