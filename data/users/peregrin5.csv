You wouldn't ""respect the beliefs"" of someone who thinks all of the Jews should be gassed, but so many people are still dedicated to claiming we ""respect the beliefs"" of others even if we don't believe in them that they'll say this phrase about any belief no matter how abhorrent they actually are.

Stop ""respecting"" the beliefs of others unless you actually respect them. For example, I respect the beliefs of Buddhists because they generally teach very good things even if I don't believe in them. I do NOT respect the beliefs of Christians and Muslims because although some of their stuff is alright, almost all of them also believe gays shouldn't have rights or at the worst that we should be killed."

I think your expectation of what friendship should be is too high, and when people don't meet that expectation, you just give up and decide to stop being around them entirely.

Most friendships, especially ones which are not yet mature, are of the type where you’re only thinking about the person when they’re in your line of sight. Be happy for those friendships and continue them and cultivate them. Like plants, some may eventually grow into deeper friendships and some won’t, but all will die if you give up.

Find people who share your hobbies. Meet with them. If you want relationships to grow sometimes you’ll have to be the one to reach out to them and invite them to places instead of just waiting to be invited. Build up your confidence. Good luck!"

Some people don't. That's why scholarships exist. The rest of society has a vested interest in improving the state of human knowledge because every now and then a new discovery can be profitable, so that's why they offer scholarships to promising students who want to become scientists and researchers. But it's rarely profitable for the ones doing the science. Their entire lives are dedicated to research while they get paid nickels and dimes, while the businesspeople make the big bucks. But they couldn't be happier because their entire purpose in life is to learn and to further knowledge. This is one of the major purposes of universities and colleges. Not just churning out degrees. That's just how universities stay afloat.

Don't make the mistake of assuming that just because employment is your motivation, that it's the motivation of every student. And some people spend a lot of money simply for the growth they'll experience. After all, you can't take it with you, so why not spend it doing something you enjoy?"
