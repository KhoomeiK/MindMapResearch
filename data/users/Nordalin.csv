I'm well aware that many Germans must've known, deduced, or simply guessed. If that happens to indeed be an overwhelmingly large percentage, then so be it.

But I hate it to see the entire nazi debacle generalised like that. Claiming that all Germans knew is one step away from claiming they were all in on it, while you as German must know that I shouldn't even *try* listing all the nuances that apply.

The extremism that those Germans and their foreign buddies performed isn't exclusive to their country members, yet that is the implication that comes forward from lazy phrasing like ""all Germans"" and nothing else. There's a massive difference between january 1940 and 1945, and same between an inhabitant of Berlin and one from St Märgen. Yet all that and more gets wiped under the rug when the entire topic gets collapsed into ""yeah, pretty much everyone of them Germans knew"".
