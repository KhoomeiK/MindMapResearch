THAT is what is important in life,  When i was young the guys in a dance place in Texas were looking at the women like meat and i felt just like a big ole fat brisket in a sea of tight jeaned steaks.  My husband to be was in that group. He later told me that i was the only one he was interested in because i had some meat on my bones. And i SMILED at him. I think we all get it in our heads that perfection is what come off of tv and we must be like that.  Please 'don;t risk losing that beautiful glow from a confident woman or girl.  Take care of your health and it will show,"

They will be committed to raising money to send to Australia but be sure to look for reputable places to send that money. I love you all and am teaching my church school ages 4 and 5 about your beautiful country and the fires . they have cried and prayed for you as well as come up with ideas for raising money to send to you,"

I can survive without the caring and companionship from that person. My mama married  a man who she fell in love with at age 17 and he was 29,  They both were deeply in love all their lives, romantics both of them.. One physical and one verbally and emotionally, They loved each other and never married again when one died, I watched my mom SURVIVE, A beautiful 55 year old woman. she survived but she was lonely, even having grands and great grands who visited weekly. It just is NOT the same without someone to love and be committed and close and sexual and intense with, its a matter of ones life being BETTER and HAPPIER with that other person in their lives,"

I think of the people and fire fighters and rescue people and the wildlife every single day, I want to know from you what can the people of other countries do to help yours?  I am from the USA in Tennessee, but willing to work or organize or help Australia in any way we can. But how do you think is the best way to help . Sending love and hugs to you. And congrats on your up coming wedding."
