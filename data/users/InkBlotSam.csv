I agree. It shouldn't feel mandatory. The reason it feels mandatory now is because everyone knows their servers are being paid below minimum wage and are only living off of tips. That pressure would (theoretically) be lifted if people knew their servers were being paid fair wages.

And it's worth noting, it's not a societal pressure so much as an intentional pressure from the restaurant. Keep in mind by cutting workers pay, they';re passing their labor costs onto the customer. It's the restaurants who benefit presently by essentially stealing workers tips. ""Oh, you got a gift? Fine, we're going to cut your pay so that money becomes ours."""
AskReddit,ff7bewe,t1_ff7a5u1,1579645484.0,"Currently tipping is basically mandatory because everyone knows the servers are being paid below minimum wage and only survive off of tips.

As for making a *law* to ban servers from receiving goodwill gifts for excellent service, that just sounds like spite. If you find yourself jealous of servers getting tips (or anyone in a personal service industry), just go be a server, I guess. I think you'll find it's not a dream industry to work in, tips or not."
AskReddit,ff7akv4,t1_ff79zeg,1579644718.0,"Totally not win win for servers. By making it illegal to accept tips, you'd basically make all servers minimum wage employees, which is likely less than they're currently making with their current (below minimum wage) hourly wage plus tips.

They should be paid at least minimum wage because they're workers and should be paid as such. If a customer then gives them some extra money for an excellent job, then the customer is able to show appreciation for a job well done, the server gets some extra money for a job well done, and the employer has satisfied customers and employees incentivized to go above and beyond. That's the win-win-win. Making tipping illegal would just be spiteful bullshit."

> Being innocent does not mean that a state has to return your property.  The Supreme Court of the United States has held that the “innocent  owner” defense is not constitutionally required. Furthermore, even in  states where you do have an innocent owner defense, the burden is  typically on you. **Your property is presumed to be guilty until you prove  that you are innocent and that your property therefore should not be  forfeited.** In other words, you must prove (1) that you were not involved  in criminal activity and (2) that you either had no knowledge that your  property was being used to facilitate the commission of a crime or that  you took every reasonable step under the circumstances to terminate  such use. And all the while, the police retain your property. To cap it  all off, the success rate for winning back property is low."
