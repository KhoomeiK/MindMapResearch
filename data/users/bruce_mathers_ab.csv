AskReddit,fe1vqui,t1_fe1k31x,1578831450.0,"I don't know if you realize but, you are amongst the luckiest in that regard. I have people who support me when I'm doing just fine. But not a single soul to be seen when I'm dying inside."

AskReddit,fe06sne,t1_fe06j06,1578804533.0,I am a failure too. But I doubt about you. I don't know what to say.... I just hope you feel better about yourself. Everything will start working after.
SuicideWatch,fe06j41,t1_fe03bnt,1578804320.0,Thanks. I'll DM you.

AskReddit,fe015as,t1_fe011cv,1578800521.0,I feel it.
AskReddit,fdvcvm2,t1_fdv75l5,1578746099.0,"Kids might be just kids. But, beating other kid randomly, teasing him, giving him mental breakdowns which he can't overcome because he's weak, isn't something to be ignored. Though this might be the teacher's or parents' fault more than the kids. But this stuff at such an age is never forgotten. It has some serious implications on the victims. They are made to believe the lies about themselves. My social anxiety troubles me to this day. I can't talk to people looking in the eye, my brain stops in sudden social situations as if a fight or flight response is triggered. I don't disagree with you, but I can't fully agree with you."
AskReddit,fdv4v8m,t1_fdv4am8,1578743271.0,That's only in case of extreme boredom.

loneliness,fdk7inv,t3_elru4d,1578497854.0,"I am very much like you. Except that I have never been in a relationship, due to my social awkwardness. I cannot assure you of something or suggest anything as I am myself very depressed most of the times. I hope we find happiness. May the force be with you. Always!"

introvert,fcp0dgi,t3_ei7lgs,1577846631.0,"Happy New year, Brother/sister (as the case may be). I received a few wishes from close family people. Just that. My fellow co workers yesterday had a party w/o me, and didn't care to remember me. I've been feeling shitty for past few days.. suicidal, you can say. I've been tasked to an off-site audit and it's been two months now. It's horrible. Horrible ending to my past year. Thank you, for you kind words. Every bit matters to me. Every person matters to me. Being an introvert has contributed to my horrible social skills. I just wish, people could understand. Or the world was filled with people like you."
AskReddit,fcmkcyk,t1_fcmj18d,1577778852.0,Most relatable comment. Except that I'm unable to cry.
