insanepeoplefacebook,ffdv6gv,t1_ffdcydc,1579829729.0,I can never decide if I hate the term “statutory rape” or appreciate the distinction.
insaneparents,ff9ecui,t1_ff8mti0,1579711187.0,I can’t stop laughing.
fatlogic,ff8ysed,t1_ff8xpwg,1579700360.0,"You have absolutely nothing to be embarrassed about, ever. And good on you for adding to your savings."
fatlogic,ff8w2kb,t1_ff8vxrx,1579698010.0,"Yes, I’m sure you’re right. That’s not the “fatphobia” being addressed here, though."
AskReddit,ff8vvls,t1_ff8vigt,1579697837.0,"I am (kids!), but also you’ve never met me. Maybe I’m just a garbage person worthy of garbage relationship. It’s fine. Settling into my garbagetown."
fatlogic,ff8v29a,t1_ff8q1rk,1579697075.0,I hope you don’t still feel embarrassed. You’ve made good decisions and positive life changes.
fatlogic,ff8uyz6,t1_ff8quyv,1579696986.0,"You go, Glen Coco! I’m proud of you."
cats,ff8uad9,t1_ff8tyaw,1579696317.0,"Always question professionals!! If you’re not being rude about it, it’s not rude. You’re just trying to get more information.

Edit: No vet should expect a cat owner to be a cat expert. If anything, vets should feel encouraged by inquisitive owners trying to help their pets. If you try the new diet, follow up. Let the vet know how it’s going. If it’s not going well, stop, but tell the vet. There may be other underlying problems if a change in diet doesn’t help."
AskReddit,ff8u6ux,t3_esb1xo,1579696218.0,"Keep quiet, smile, and pretend like everything’s fine."
legaladvice,ff8u5sx,t3_esb1y4,1579696189.0,"So this is clearly a troll, yes?"
stopdrinking,ff8u36h,t3_esb1ye,1579696116.0,"I am very (truly) happy for you and proud of your sobriety!! Well done. 

I will say that if you’re looking to lose weight, WW is a garbage system. I’ve not experienced the WW subreddit, and I’m glad it’s supportive, but the structure is functionally incorrect. CICO."
Showerthoughts,ff8twpw,t3_esb20a,1579695931.0,Nope
AskReddit,ff8tv4f,t3_esb27t,1579695884.0,"Women have tInY sMoL bRaINs. 

Yeah, newsflash bucko, women are more similar to men than they are not."
cats,ff8tq0s,t3_esb294,1579695740.0,"My human doctor told me the same. I expressed similar concerns (high-fiber diets leading to more and messier poops). 

She could’ve been lying to me, but the gist of it was that eventually high-fiber diets even out and you (or your cat) will have more even, regular poopies."
AskReddit,ff8tiw0,t1_ff8td44,1579695527.0,"Thank you, and no it doesn’t sound preachy. 

Trying is really hard, though. It’s a helluva lot easier to be miserable in silence when everything looks great from the outside."

AskReddit,ff8t39w,t1_ff8sr1c,1579695053.0,"I would also not consider it successful. 

Any time I bring up his cheating, he kicks me out of the house (towards which I pay the mortgage, and in which I have several large functional pieces of furniture/heirlooms)."
religiousfruitcake,ff8spcb,t3_esay5z,1579694609.0,Funny how the Constitution doesn’t matter when it’s cited verbatim by cRaZy LIBrul dEms
todayilearned,ff8ske2,t1_ff8sf0w,1579694449.0,It’s like blaming the humans for the flu. Rattus norwegicus is not at fault.
aww,ff8sdr2,t1_ff8oys5,1579694236.0,Smart girl. Her squeakums sound like me in protest.

AskReddit,ff8rxqf,t3_esalnv,1579693709.0,"It’s barely working. He fucked several other women and I’m ignoring it because I live here and love his cats. 

I honestly don’t know if a (relatively new) relationship can rebound from such a thing.

Edit: we’re “successful” in the sense that we are still living together. Unsuccessful in the sense that anyone is happy."
AskReddit,ff8rfcs,t1_ff8r8p4,1579693075.0,"A. Yes, I agree. And for any young people reading this? His treatment of me is not okay. It’s never okay. Especially when you’re not allowed to tell friends or family what’s happening. Your SO’s actions should hold up to scrutiny. 

B, (kids stop reading!!) no I don’t I’m a ball of depression and fear and I’m constantly patting myself on the back for not being dead already"
AskReddit,ff8r3ms,t1_ff8qx8z,1579692658.0,I adore you.
