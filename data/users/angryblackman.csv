handtools,ff443yt,t1_ff2p3wc,1579555109.0,"If you like doing that kind of thing, go for it.

I love my hand tools, but I hate doing work like this by hand.  Table and band saws are huge work savers."
Browns,fe8z8bx,t1_fe81s8u,1578932482.0,"The Cowher one was kind of meh.

He was a pretty good coach, but not HOF worthy."
handtools,fe8s7g0,t1_fe8rnq3,1578930107.0,makes sense.  A tool well is a really good idea there.
handtools,fe8rvm4,t1_fdvmczc,1578929962.0,"That handle looks very uncomfortable.

Did anybody at that company use that plane for more than one swipe?"
handtools,fe8r2mf,t3_en50ij,1578929633.0,"Ignore the tear out, my friend.  It's a workbench.

Pour your obsession into what you build on the bench."
handtools,fe8qvy2,t3_enzkgg,1578929555.0,"I love my router plane.  I'd buy it again (and again).  It's so useful for all kinds of joinery (hand and machine) and installing hinges.  

It is absolutely necessary? No.  It does save me time which is important to me."
handtools,fe8qet3,t3_ensn9t,1578929260.0,what's the big ass cavity for in the middle?
handtools,fe8qby8,t1_fe5pyl3,1578929208.0,"I'll offer this counterpoint: It's a workbench, ignore the tear out.

I have tear out on mine, and it's not a big deal.  I save the obsession for projects."
starterpacks,fdi4wav,t1_fdh1wuq,1578435784.0,"Approach it the right way, you can grow as a person."
woodworking,fdhz897,t3_elc5ae,1578432859.0,you have good taste in tools =-)
todayilearned,fdhyz7l,t1_fdhie89,1578432722.0,"we're not close to perfect (two people wounded in different ways).  However, at our core we both have the same vision about how life should be lived (we're both Christian) and how a marriage should be."
Browns,fdhhcqm,t1_fdh75ju,1578422664.0,"There's the chance to be the guy who turns the Browns around, and not having to start on a rebuilding team.

If he gets two years better than 8-8 he'll be a freaking hero."
todayilearned,fdhd0l0,t1_fdh6oga,1578420181.0,"True.  You manage what you can, that's what we do.

So far, it's worked well =-)"
todayilearned,fdgzpg5,t1_fdgxsse,1578412197.0,it's why you don't just jump into it.
todayilearned,fdgzg7k,t1_fdgwy2z,1578412034.0,"When you get married you really have to put thought into it.  Looking beyond the hormones is hard, but you have to put together a framework for discussing the difficult stuff, as well as choose to treat the other with kindness.

I've been married for 20 years to somebody who is almost my exact opposite personality wise.  We make sure we always bring issues to the forefront and get them dealt with.  It's not easy, but our marriage is stable and we've weathered a lot of storms together."
handtools,fddtzky,t1_fd953ti,1578323929.0,"Yup, workshop based.  I'd never bring nice tools on site.

He also was crazy athletic (even when his knees were bad), which helped him quite a bit."
Browns,fcycx1t,t3_ej76o0,1578078239.0,"He was awesome to watch, a pure football player and a LB that could do it all.

If the Browns weren't a shitshow for the last 20 years he'd be in."
woodworking,fcy0kna,t3_ej7jda,1578073059.0,"looks great.

Is the top veneer?"
Browns,fcu7aqp,t3_eim7a3,1577974262.0,'how to kill a fanbase'
Browns,fcu75uh,t1_fctz34u,1577974175.0,No legit running threat either.   That team was baaaad.
woodworking,fbdvokn,t3_ecn982,1576772382.0,Very nice!
