She did recollect a drunken night when she was in highschool where my dad(raised me) and her got in a fight and she dropped him off at his brothers. Then proceeded to go to a party with a girl from school. She blacked out. Came too and she's in the passenger seat of some fellas car looking at the lake. Didn't really iterate what convo was had because it was about 28 years ago and she only remembers being freaked out not knowing how she got to the lake but... She said she was black out drunk but that females can usually tell even the following day if they had sex. She never thought she had sex with the guy but did find a hickey on her kneck.

todayilearned,ff3oerk,t1_ff3n2cn,1579545395.0,">How about letting the women race unimpeded, AND letting the men race unimpeded?

Because then then the woman who disregarded pacing herself to gain an early lead would get a major advantage by drafting the male riders.  The male race was naturally going to drift ahead of the women's but the organizers didn't expect her to go all out for the first five miles.  Unless she was superhuman she was almost certainly not going to win the race running it like she was.  The other women were treating the endurance race like an endurace race.  Letting her, and whoever else burned everything for an early start, run behind the men would end up distorting the results more then just holding up the race to widen the gap.

The organizers should have left a bigger gap in case some women did what she did.  But this is not some sexist double standard holding a super athlete back.  You just don't understand cycling."

dragonage,ff2xsjg,t3_erbjql,1579528028.0,"I have a pet theory that the story of DA:I was written with the intention of revealing Solas as the Dread Wolf earlier and him being the antagonist for the latter part of the game.  The ending of the game never really felt like the destination we were supposed to be arriving at.  The factions uniting at the Battle of Denerim and the Mage/Templar war igniting in the streets of Kirkwall were engaging conclusions to the rising action of the story.  Corypheus just sort of fought a losing war against us after Haven and then died.  There was no plot revelation or tragic character arc, he was just some Skeletor guy who needed to be defeated because the game wouldn't be over if we didn't.

Considering the nuance and effort that they put into writing the characters and subplots of Dragon Age, I was surprised that they put so little into main conflict.  Only thing I can figure is they actually put *so* much writing and nuance into the main bad guy that they decided to push him back into his own game, leaving the secondary antagonist to hold up the main plot despite not being written for it."

I would assume that 40k troops are more carefully selected and trained, but remember that during the Crusade the massive recruitment numbers were offset by the massive casualty numbers.  The Space Marines were the dominant military force during the Crusade as opposed to the ""scalpel"" they became today.

>‘Look at him and what do you see? An angel. The Angel. In a universe that the Emperor claims is godless – in an Imperium where our civilisation’s wisest and greatest have dismantled all the trappings of religion – Sanguinius is an icon of something that should not exist, glorious and supernatural. My brother knows this. He feels it. He’s too intelligent, too soulful, not to.’ Lorgar lowered his head, the shadow of his hood darkening his features down to his chin. ‘The Emperor, for all his many flaws, knows his sons well. Horus was chosen as Warmaster because he is the best of us. In Horus, all things are found in balance, and yet every facet is raised to excellence. Sanguinius is similar. His virtues eclipse the rest of us, for which of us could match his grace, his compassion, or his understanding of the human condition? And yet our brother is unbalanced. Profoundly so. He represents both the very best and the very worst of what it is to be a primarch. He is the noblest of us but also the most fearful; a glorious creature enslaved by insecurities.’  
>  
>Lorgar gestured again and the glowing image of Sanguinius vanished. ‘Oh yes, the Angel is righteous and he is strong and he is beautiful in practically every way. But he has a cancerous weakness in his heart – a weakness known to only a few of us. Sanguinius is loyal to our father out of perfect love and perfect nobility, and if that were all, he might still be turned or killed as you so desire, my son. But what you fail to consider is that he is also loyal out of perfect fear. He fears the reason he has wings. He fears what they might represent. He fears something went terribly wrong during his creation and he fears the effects this may have upon his own gene-sons.’ Angron watched Lorgar with undisguised fascination, the Nail-induced fire in his skull momentarily forgotten.
