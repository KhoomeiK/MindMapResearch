AskAnAmerican,ff8ytre,t1_ff8xbfk,1579700391.0,I'm guessing there might be a bit of racism involved as well. Here is an article about it https://medium.com/@daringivens/suburban-exclusion-of-marta-and-access-to-the-braves-stadium-b10fa9e6889d
AskAnAmerican,ff8cr13,t1_ff82t5t,1579673163.0,It keeps poor people away.
AskAnAmerican,ff8bta9,t1_ff6fg15,1579672200.0,Learned driving in our yard and then on rural county roads at age 12-13. When I was too short to reach the pedals my Dad used to let me sit in his lap and steer around the yard as a kid. Fun times.
videos,ff74778,t1_f9wssmu,1579640780.0,I think it's because you didn't grow up with it everywhere. This is the soundtrack of my teenage years. Brings back great memories. I'm from Alabama.
HomeImprovement,ff6ipik,t1_ff51bdt,1579628048.0,"Oh god a guy I know started working for them and constantly posts about it online. I got curious what it actually was since all the talk sounded culty/mlm'y, plus I never knew him to be into home repair or anything. Looked it up and can't believe this guy is so invested in working for them."
superstore,fey3i81,t3_eqlpq2,1579440312.0,She looks exactly the same. How did you not notice.
hamiltonmusical,fey2wq7,t1_few98fb,1579440041.0,Lucky!
hamiltonmusical,fey2976,t3_eqqedd,1579439741.0,"Actually just saw it. Cost me 110 dollars to sit in the balcony. The ticket was so cheap due to the fact I went by myself and single tickets were going for cheap at the time (I looked later and similar tickets were like 200.) And I know it's not a popular answer, but I downloaded the cam version of the original cast and have watched it many times."
AnimalLiberationFront,fexzsru,t1_fesmpfm,1579438913.0,Oh ok. I thought you meant you bought the dog.
AnimalLiberationFront,fesbldq,t3_eqcpvk,1579363553.0,Never ever buy an animal from a breeder. It only encourages the problem.
TrailGuides,fesbeqi,t3_eqhv48,1579363487.0,https://youtu.be/kJfwwDlwzjM Jupiter hiked this fairly recently.

leanfire,feruaj6,t1_feog558,1579358424.0,Ayyyy! Gulf Coast is the best coast. I'm now on the East Coast and it sucks.
howtonotgiveafuck,feh75p9,t1_feh5c6g,1579110555.0,"Yes we can reddit on our government computers, but no we cannot look at any nudity. That's what not safe for work means. It's not safe to look at at work."

trashy,fedlk8c,t1_fed1d3d,1579014518.0,How much is your water that it's such a boon? I've never paid over 25 dollars. I guess in a desert it would be more. I'm in North Carolina for reference.
EatCheapAndHealthy,fecshc2,t1_fec261j,1578982902.0,It's easy. Just think about how much healthier your food is and how an animal didn't have to die for you to have a meal.
marriagefree,fecpa2z,t3_eo2313,1578979805.0,"I'm in a 3 year relationship where we do this. We live a hour apart, and he works 4 days a week and I work 4 nights a week. We talk on the phone a bunch and alternate weekends at each other's houses. So on average we see each other 3 days a week. It's working out great. I wish we could see each other everyday and would like to eventually live together, but the job situation makes it very difficult. This is working out really well for us so far though."
fatlogic,fe0c28b,t1_fdxe6td,1578809301.0,It's just the bit of  broth left after you cook greens. It's called that because it's so good it makes you want to lick the pot
fatlogic,fds89ir,t1_fdr5tso,1578696604.0,I don't put any meat in but I do put some liquid smoke. I also cook them a really long time. I drink the potlikker so at least whatever is leached into that I'm getting.

BreadTube,fdla7fw,t1_fdknhvl,1578519724.0,"I've been watching Dusty for many years now and I agree. I'll watch or listen to the CODcasts every now and then, but he really shines doing his religous bullshit videos and other stuff like that."
AskMen,fdijr87,t1_fdflhdd,1578444465.0,"I was in before Post 9/11 was introduced and when I ETSed I switched over as well. With Post 9/11 you don't ever have to buy in, as long as you meet the requirements of eligibility."

army,fcz6yyi,t1_fcz2zje,1578094927.0,This used to play right after reveille when I was there in 05-06. We had to sing it. I still remember the words somehow.
