As far as what was said about Clinton, I have long thought that we should be more careful not to exaggerate so much in political speech, to avoid false comparisons just like this one."
worldpolitics,ff4cohm,t1_ff4c7zr,1579560503.0,"Well I’m not sure what you’re saying exactly. But I think you’re making the case that Obama, Bush, and Clinton were worse that Trump. While I didn’t vote for or really support or like Bush or Clinton, and while I did have some major problems with Obama, especially around foreign policy, they don’t even come close to Trump. The thing that is so bad about Trump is the way he’s not only corrupt but actively tries to undermine our system at every turn. I would argue that Clinton had a few moments where he got close to that level, and certainly many of Bush’s post 9/11 policies did as well, but Trump is a whole new level of this garbage. It needs to stop with him."

But incidentally, you haven’t actually laid out any facts either, you’ve just said that whatever facts were in the report you don’t think are impeachable. 

But of course you are wrong. There is no clear standard for impeachment just as, as the report details, there isn’t a clear legal standard for “collusion.” So while the report does conclude that there wasn’t enough evidence made available to the special consul to prove criminal conspiracy, they left it up to congress to decide whether to impeach.  (The report also points out that the consul was specifically instructed not to consider indictment for the President). Congress declined, because the Democrats were still balking at the Republican control of the Senate.

You will note, however, that the special consul left very open the question of obstruction. He documented numerous instance of this type of conduct and then said (remember, the President can’t be indicted, according to the Justice Department’s legal interpretation) “well, if we had found evidence clearing him of these changes we would have said so.”

So the idea that the special consul was inconclusive is a red herring. He prosecuted numerous associates for the activities detailed within the report, but when it came to the President he simply had nothing else he could say except here’s the evidence, “have congress decide.”

Then, along comes Barr, who’s move was to hold a press conference where he distorts the special consul’s findings and then immediately says he won’t prosecute. That was all just show to try to prevent impeachment."
worldpolitics,ff46czd,t1_ff45uyd,1579556521.0,"Hey look, I’ve spent enough time taking to Trump supporters online to know that if you’re deep enough in to have read the report and think “sure, no biggie,” then there’s nothing I can say to change your mind.

worldpolitics,ff3sj2i,t1_ff3rmjp,1579547912.0,"Wow, man. So what is actually in there is a detailed account of the numerous and mainly undisclosed contacts between the a trump campaign and Russian intelligence service operatives, accounts of the actions that Russian intelligence took during the campaign, often corresponding to those contacts, and then the actions of the administration, especially Trump, after the fact to obstruct the investigatory process. The pattern described, of parallel track unofficial contacts through trusted emissaries like his children, Giuliani, or various other insiders, followed by actions taken (or in the case of Ukraine considered) by a foreign power, and then attempts to cover up by attacking investigators/witnesses and denying access to records, is very similar between the two instances. The only real difference is that in the Russian case we haven’t been able to learn whether there was a direct quid pro quo or whether they simply did it to mess with us or to stop Clinton."

worldpolitics,ff3ecii,t1_ff3dsqj,1579539352.0,"Well, the point I was trying to make is that they were having a discussion about the PR relief scandal and holding it up as just another example of Democratic Party corruption, etc etc. So I pointed out that corruption really isn’t the purview of any single party and, in fact, what we are seeing play out now in the Congress is a much more significant corruption case involving the Trump admin. (The substance and pattern of which is detailed in those two places). This isn’t to say that the PR case shouldn’t be prosecuted but that we really shouldn’t turn corruption into a partisan issue. It benefits all of us not to do so."
AskThe_Donald,ff36yrc,t1_ff36r50,1579535165.0,"It details the massive corruption of the Trump administration. Obviously it’s not directly connected to the current trial, but it is something you can read that shows the basic pattern of corruption that is currently on trial. If you like you could watch the impeachment testimony instead. Both demonstrate very similar patterns of wrongdoing and obstruction."
AskThe_Donald,ff33psp,t1_ff31d41,1579532894.0,"Ok well let me be clear. Assuming that the facts  o this case are as the initially appear to be, its undoubtedly a scandalous case of corruption, which should be prosecuted vigorously. It’s also just one more instance of the US government as the colonial power failing Puerto Ricans. 

But at the same time, as so many people are rushing to blame Democrats for this instance of corruption, they are overlooking the mother of all corruption cases, which is now going to be tried in the Senate (where some senators who will serve as jurors have already stated that they plan to dismiss even before the trial has started). So the upshot is that no party really has a corner on corruption. It’s a feature of basically all politics. That’s not an excuse or an indication that it shouldn’t be prosecuted, but simply an argument for the idea that we shouldn’t make it a partisan issue. It benefits is all if all corruption is punished."

facepalm,fdzp6z4,t1_fdzkgqk,1578792722.0,"I’m not twisting anything. I’m just pointing out that abstract examples with hands and egg beaters don’t buy food at the store, unless you’re getting paid to teach free market economic theory, which most people aren’t. So you’ve got to start not from what your model says reality should be but from what reality actually is. And the reality is that a whole lot of working people are struggling to get by. So we either do something about that or don’t, but we’ve had 40 years now of supposedly waiting for the free markets to get around to it and things only get worse (and that includes the terms of two Democratic Presidents). 

And yes, you do, in fact, need to bone up on the history. Because despite the standard move to try to discredit early progressives around issues of race, the actual point I was making was that the current conservative obsession with a free-market-at-all-costs approach already crapped out once. This is why in that turn of the century moment, we saw folks from both parties coming to the conclusion that something needed to be done through government or our system wasn’t going to last. History doesn’t repeat itself, of course, despite the aphorisms, but it still seems like we should be able to take something away from looking at situations of similar inequality in the past. 

If you want to start with an accessible read that was confronting a lot of these issues in the wake of the Haymarket affair, check out Edward Bellamy’s Looking Backward. It’s a nice capsule of the concerns that middle class observers had about the late 19th century free market approach."
facepalm,fdzg0id,t1_fdz8h6g,1578789887.0,"Man, you got it bad. I’m guessing you’re a lawyer maybe? Or an economist? You know what Zeno’s paradox is, so you’ve had some education, most likely, but probably not a discipline that involves much direct observation of human realities. 

Yes, you nailed it: Woodrow Wilson was racist. So was Samuel Gompers, and by today’s standards probably most White people were. Stop the presses. I’m  not sure exactly what that’s supposed to mean to anyone, exactly, because it certainly doesn’t change the fact that the labor movement did a lot of good for working people in the US and around the world.  

Does that (sigh) mean that we should implement 1900s economic policy in 2020? No, obviously not. But, as you clearly are smart enough to understand, my meaning was that arguing for total, ridiculous free-market control hasn’t actually always been the strategy of defenders of capitalism when they had to come to terms with the reality of human conditions.

And so you’re also smart enough to understand my main point, which is that no matter how much hot air you expend trying to logically explain why people making minimum wage shouldn’t get paid enough to live, that ultimately means nothing to the actual people who find themselves in that position. So let’s dispense with all that.

If you wanted to make a better point, you should have gone with either “small businesses will suffer” or “it will cause inflation” (which I think you were trying to get to at the end there), thought ultimately none of these are very strong arguments either."
facepalm,fdz2tre,t1_fdyzhvu,1578786091.0,"Yeah, see the thing about trying to logic your way out of social problems is that logic and reality don’t actually match up all the time. What you are saying is that no one should be trying to live on the current minimum wage. I agree. And yet behold the reality of the world. 

So, our options are 1) to tell people trying to make a living to do better (and hope somehow that they can) or 2) to value their work at a price that can support their lives.  And, by the way, that’s what the idea behind a minimum wage actually originally was. There’s a lot of history written on the labor movement at the turn of the century that would help you understand some background.

Let me add one more thing: I know that it seems like arguing the way you do seems like it’s the best defense of capitalism (which I’m guessing you like), but labor laws like a living minimum wage were actually originally passed to save capitalism. In the early 20th century, there was a lot of that working people would organize a socialist/anarchist revolution. Labor laws and anti-trust laws (of the kind that every conservative now seems to find anathema) were often passed by as a way of heading off a populist revolution."
