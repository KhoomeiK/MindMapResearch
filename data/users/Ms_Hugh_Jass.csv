worldnews,fdq1bhh,t1_fdq0868,1578649952.0,"I don’t know how to quote posts on reddit so I will just address them in the order you made them. My apologies.

1. China may not have had a Jim Crow/segregation type issue, but Uyghur Muslims are the only one’s being targeted by the CCP mandated police; I don’t hear any reports of Han Chinese being dragged to re-education camps. Again, they are seen as ethnically inferior by the majority of the Han Chinese, who also happen to make up the largest portion of China, sitting at around 93%. I’d say the level of racism is comparable, but it is morally irresponsible to “rank” levels of racism, you cannot deny the discrimination Uyghurs Muslims face at the hands of the Han, the majority.

2. For a country that with a leader that openly speaks against religious persecution, his behavior is saying otherwise. Of course it is hard for a minority to live anywhere, but you can’t tell me Chinese people aren’t civilized enough not to serve pork and get offensive about it. The discrimination against them is rooted in racism.

3. On this topic, you keep preaching education, but that’s NOT what they’re doing. If this is education, I wouldn’t want to be educated in an education camp in China. Chinese officials flat out denied the existence of these camps until recently, why? Probably because there is shady stuff going on in there. And the bottom line is that, they are there by FORCE. I can bet my bottom dollar that no Uyghur Muslim wants to be in an education camp. There was even a Uyghur Muslim that went to Peking Uni and got pulled for    “Unknown” reasons. You would think that a student at China’s top university would be “educated” enough to be considered integrated into China’s Mainland society, but apparently not. 

3. https://theweek.com/articles-amp/877024/inside-chinas-reeducation-camps

https://www.bbc.com/news/amp/world-asia-china-50511063

Here are some sources that state the human rights abuses going on. One is from the same source that you used. The second link shows rules that the guards inside were supposed to follow.

4. https://www.wired.co.uk/article/airbnb-china-uyghur-muslim

Here is an article about Mainland Chinese discriminating against Uyghur Muslims. The places where it happened were at MULTIPLE airbnbs, not just places that serve pork. And even then, you are implying that Mainland Chinese people are not civilized enough to not serve pork and not get offended about it. That is not the case. 

5. On your belief that you think that human rights abuses stem from personal acts of violences rather than official mandated violence, I can’t say that you’re wrong. You’re right that the CCP has not officially mandated a statement to their guards at the re-education camps to torture Uyghur Muslims, but think about it this way: why would they officially state their wrongdoings? Verbal orders is enough to get the job done, and given their intense efforts to keep re-education camps as secretive as possible, it’s not really a reach to say that they could easily send orders to torture prisoners. And yes, the fact that they have a history of being draconian and strict makes it all the more likely.


In the end, you are right that China is a big place. But the whole of Mainland China thinks collectively because that’s the cultural values instilled in them and that’s what they practice. It doesn’t matter if the guards are acting against direct CCP orders by torturing Muslims. By mandating that Uyghur Muslims be put in camps against their will, they’re responsible for what happens to them. And as you said, given their draconian history in being harsh with people that dissent, it’s not a far reach that the CCP ordered for human rights issues inside the camps to take place. I can’t say that it did/it did not happen because you are right-no statement was released, but I don’t know why a government would actively admit to committing human rights abuses. They would probably keep it as tight-locked as possible-like what the CCP has been doing.

Edit: grammar issues."
worldnews,fdor2re,t1_fdoqelb,1578610992.0,"While there are shady sources regarding what’s happening inside these re-education camps, there are definitely credible ones as well.

I will agree with you on your point that the situation probably ranges between the two extremes. 
 
I don’t know what you mean by racism is different in China than it is in the west. The bottom line is that there have been numerous studies that show that Uyghur Muslims as a whole feel economically and socially disadvantaged as a result of being a minority. There are even signs in China that say “no Uighurs.”

And on your last point, why “re-educate?” It’s happening inside closed quarters so we can’t see what’s happening. I’m not going to say that I know what the CCP is doing. All I will say is that based on reports that indicate severe human rights violations, if that’s what they consider “re-education” then the CCP sucks ass.

worldnews,fdooqoq,t1_fdoo32f,1578609509.0,"I think you’re severely downplaying the issues regarding this matter. You’re right, it’s pretty shitty. But to treat the awful things happening inside the prison as a byproduct of sadistic guards instead of something the CCP is mandating as a part of their “re-education” is the understatement of the century.

It’s pretty common knowledge that the a large portion of the Han community view Uyghur Muslisms as inferior ethnically. I’m not saying that it’s a black and white situation, I’m sure there are some Chinese officials who truly believe in integrating Uyghur Muslims into Mainland Chinese society, but the way they have gone about it shows otherwise."

You need to understand that people have different morals. I think most people would agree that things such as rape, torture, and murder are pretty bad.
