dubstep,fehhgrm,t3_ep5eug,1579116619.0,"I think i started at 11-12 years old with Skrillex

then worked my way up to more underground genres like riddim around 2014 with Oolacile, Mvrda, Svdden Death, Midnight T., Phiso, Soltan, Subtronics just to name a few,

and then finally discovered Deathstep and Tearout in late 2016 with Supercool!, Punishment., Code Pandorum, Pfista, Nimda, Aimless and other less known soundcloud producers.

I'm a big fan of chaotic ear-shattering tearout where half of the time it's just white noise with a kick and a snare thrown in there (search Vomit by Pyre on soundcloud if you dare), but I still listen to Riddim on the side (Oolacile is still my top producer), I was listening to Punishment the other day and later my neighbor came down because he heard ""horrible noises"" coming from my apartment."
