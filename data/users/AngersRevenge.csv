Whatcouldgowrong,fehcain,t3_ep4evw,1579113610.0,That clip never gets old.
therewasanattempt,fda2jui,t1_fd9lrhi,1578240948.0,It’s kind of hilarious watching you try to fit your entire vocabulary into one sentence. Go pound sand.
therewasanattempt,fd7lj0i,t1_fd3zxf4,1578206337.0,Been there done that. I was actually in IET when 9/11 happened.
facepalm,fd3or7f,t1_fd3nvig,1578160377.0,How is attacking the American embassy not a threat? They only stopped the embassy attack after a bunch of U.S. troops were sent in.
facepalm,fd3mr37,t1_fcz9oh4,1578159812.0,They did attack the Americans. He was the person who orchestrated the embassy attack.
therewasanattempt,fd3kmf3,t1_fcz6xtv,1578159173.0,"Actually he is not impeached. Pelosi hasn't delivered the articles yet. So, therefore, not impeached."
therewasanattempt,fd3iu1y,t1_fcznfnx,1578158735.0,"It actually started when Iran killed a U.S. soldier and an American defence contractor, while wounding another soldier. That's when the U.S. bombed the terrorist. Then the embassy attack happened."
facepalm,fd0821z,t1_fcznuk9,1578115027.0,"O.k. even though I agree with the decision to take it the terrorist, that was pretty funny."
facepalm,fd076yq,t1_fczx9us,1578114660.0,Iran killed a U.S. soldier and a defence contractor while wounding another soldier. Then the U.S. retaliated with an air strike. Then a Hezbollah back militia attacked the U.S. embassy in Iraq. Iran basically said you won't do anything about it. So the U.S. took out one of the top Iranian general. The one who orchestrated the embassy attack.
facepalm,fczc8ok,t1_fcxfdif,1578098008.0,Some don't. Although it's due to America's military that they can afford not to. America is the one who keeps a lot of the trade routes open and safe as can be for others. America's is the one who will step in and defend the little guys if it comes to that. We can do that because we have a good military.
facepalm,fcz89e5,t1_fcypq15,1578095671.0,"Technically he hasn't been impeached yet. Pelosi hasn't delivered the documents for impeachment. The documents have been written but not delivered. So, technically....."

facepalm,fcym7x1,t1_fcyd0pm,1578082604.0,"We attacked them after they wounded a soldier and killed another. Plus they killed a contractor. That's when they attacked the embassy. 

After the Marines and some soldiers from the 82nd got sent in they ran like cowards."

funny,fcsrww5,t3_eimpyc,1577923562.0,"Say what you will, but with vaping I have cut down to 2 cigarettes a day. Hopefully, soon to be none. I know it's still nicotine but it's better than smoking and yes I have done my research from multiple sources."
instantkarma,fcm83rk,t1_fchz8lo,1577766741.0,"I agree, the mint is wrong. Me and my brother had a chuckle over it. Didn't mean to imply you was down voting. Just that some people have. The written word is often perceived as a negative connotation compared to spoken."
instantkarma,fchurgz,t1_fch3qgm,1577654384.0,"I never said Canada didn't have an official language. I know Canada has 2 official languages. Hence, a lot of signs being in both English and French. The Winnipeg mint stated that America had an official language of English. Why all the down votes for stating a fact. Do people not read the post? There was a display on which you could press buttons and see facts on a country compared to Canada. One of those countries was America."
instantkarma,fcgvv1g,t3_eh6jqu,1577644447.0,"First I know the US has no official language. It has an official business language of English but no official language of the country. That said, I recently went to the Canadian mint in Winnipeg and on their display it says English is the official language of America. Thought it was kinda of funny."
facepalm,fc1wfh4,t3_eflf8e,1577331799.0,"Although it is based off the book, the video game players are greater in numbers. While not the target audience, of which I doubt, they are going to be the vast majority to watch the flick. I believe they say it's based off the books so they can get away with more creative liberty. I was skeptical at first of it being a typical Netflix woke trash. It's actually pretty good."
funny,fbguemn,t1_fbgni5j,1576858817.0,Sometimes it's difficult to infer sarcasm on Reddit. Take my upvote to hopefully offset the downs.
