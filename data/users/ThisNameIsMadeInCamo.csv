NuxTakuSubmissions,fejlai1,t3_epg644,1579178732.0,So beating it is easy but playing it is literally like using fire moves
The8BitRyanReddit,fehhqcz,t1_fedz3gw,1579116774.0,"Also here’s a question that can’t be answered if you only play battle royale . How do you know that you are improving? Victory royales mean nothing cause for all you know either there were no good players or they got killed early on either by their mistakes or they just ran into a lot of players with no heals. So the feeling of improvement is almost none. Also I know what I am talking about because I played Shitnite since season 4 and gave up on season 7/8 , and for ALL that time I had no idea if I improved in any way because there is no reliable way to know , missions can just be grinded for hours so those arent reliable , same with tiers and levels. Oh and also can we talk about how winning is about 33% luck that includes chances for good players to die , not to be sniped from a mile away , to get good weapons and to not run into any players untill you have good weapons , you wouldnt believe how many times I died because I didnt find good weapons."

facepalm,fe7t2ct,t3_eo3auh,1578918961.0,Yeah she will need new tires soon ... and then even more ... and more
facepalm,fdsdkvg,t3_emro1u,1578700216.0,Is the traffic full of camo cars? I cant see them . Either she is bullshiting or just some random tires are there which are also camo.
