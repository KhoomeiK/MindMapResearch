It doesn't matter if they are nasty and rude, or polite and nice, about dropping the facts on these morons that they are subjecting their kids to unnecessary pain, suffering, and death.  It's the truth and telling people who are killing their kids that they are killing their kids and should wise up, is not morally comparable to being that parent slowly killing your kid.

prochoice,feyh42r,t1_fewe7cv,1579445473.0,"That would make her pro-choice, yes.  The people who call themselves pro-life even though they are actually pro-choice only serve to muddy the waters.  There are pro-lifers who believe we (pro-choicers) identify as pro-choice because we only support abortion, and not continuing a pregnancy, and that we pressure women to abort, in part because there are so many people who believe in abortion with limits who identify as pro-life and make it seem like believing legal abortion with limits should be legal is a pro-life thing.  It's not.

My strong suggestion is that to avoid confusion between the goals of the communities, if she believes it should be legal to recieve an abortion electively, she admit she's pro-choice and just include that she has a preffered cut-off point.  That's what pro-choicers who have a cut-off point normally do.  They just are square about being pro-choice and having an opinion on what they consider reasonable limitations.  The pro-life movement seeks to eliminate abortion access and in some new circumstances, voluntary medical euthanasia as well.

I have met pro-choicers with preferred cut-off points.  I have never met a pro-lifer who believes in elective abortion, becausr by definition if you believe elective abortion is permissable in average circumstances (even with a cutoff) you are in favour of a woman's right to *choose* whether or not to remain pregnant, once pregnant.

The actual account, (not saying it was trye obviously) was that the man was a businessman who arrived in Japan and presented his passport from his home country of Taurid.  It had stamps from Japan and other existing countries going back decades, and his stamps from Japan eent back to a year which was two years before Japan in our universe even began accepting international air travel.  Meaning in ""his world,"" Japan accepted international air travel earlier in time.

Supposedly, the man had no idea why no one had heard of Taurid because it was a power and had been around 1000 years.  It was apparently a country in Europe ""in his universe."" But our history/timeline was different and the country of Taurid was never ""founded,"" so it didn't exist.

To make a story that's actually pretty long, short, he supposedly was transported spontaneously (and temporarily) from his timeline where Taured exists and Japan accepted air travel from Europe starting in 1952, to our timeline where Andorra in Taurid's place and Japan didn't allow international air travel until 1954.

You can look up claims about people who were spontaneously transported to a ""different"" timeline and find tons of stories like this.  It isn't about the person inventing interdimensional travel and wasting time going to an existing location.

insaneparents,feksxy5,t1_fejqoz5,1579206946.0,"No, because then they wouldn't have the added factor of intimidating the child into being afraid of them by having the child witness them losing their shit and pummeling something to pieces with a hammer like a lunatic. The kid also wouldn't learn the important childhood lesson that things that they've been blatantly given and told are their's were never really actually their's, and that the people you love and trust will violently destroy things that are important to you and make you happy if you make them mad.

And if you can't do that for your kid, why even be a parent? (/s)

PS; Is it just me, or does behaviour like this from a parent just kind of work to subconsciously teach the kid as they grow up that the people who tell you that they love you and that you can trust them should be able to take belongings you have that make you happy and bring you joy, and permanently destroy just because they are temporarily angry at you, is acceptable? That it's normal for someone you love and trust to break your things if they're angry at you, just because you made them mad.

All I can think of reading this is that one anti-abuse comic where the girl's parents are constantly yelling at and belittling her when she's a child and as she grows up, her head transforms into a nail.  At the end the man she's shown marrying has a hammer as his own head.

I never want kids. But good lord, I cannot imagine doing something to my child that I couldn't completely reverse with a normal apology when I stop being angry.  If that child's life can't return back to complete normalcy as soon as you've stopped being angry and as soon as the punishment period is over, then the punishment was wrong.

Put the kid's Xbox in a locked cabinet for 3 months.  Take the power chords away.  Don't permanently shatter it in front of him with a fucking hammer, like the things that are important to him mean shit to you just because you're mad at him.

Sorry.  Rant over."

childfree,fekhz70,t1_fdxnjo1,1579200433.0,"I had a friend who was in his mid twenties and started ""dating,"" a 17-year-old.  (Legal where I am). Guess what I did?  I told him to date a girl his own age and stop trolling the local high school looking for pussy like a dirty perverted creep, or we're not friends anymore. And guess what: we're not friends anymore.  

Maybe you don't, but I actually have standards when it comes to my relationships and I don't stay friends with men who take advantage of high school girls.

Your friend ""dated,"" a high school student and then started having sex with her the second it was texhnically legal.  That's called child grooming.  We normally ostracize people for shit like that.  ""Dating"" a kid until they're just old enough for you to legally fuck is child grooming and it's a well-known and recognized child predator behaviour."

Your friend needs a grow up and accept that he's not in high school, or even college, anymore.  He's old.  If he didn't just saddle this poor teenage girl, fresh out of school, with a fucking baby who might not even graduate college before its father dies of old age, I would say he needs to stop raiding high school dances for underage pussy and date people his own age.  But now he has a freshly-graduated pregnant girlfriend who will likely be totally dependent on him because she'll have no fucking prospects."

It's creepy that he's old enough to be her grandfather and for her potential stepchild, his oldest, to be twice her own age. I cannot even imagine what a 52-year-old would have in common with a just-freshly-18-year-old.  Either in interests, or on the scale of emotional and mental maturity.  If a 52-year-old is going after girls who are still eligable to reasonbly be in High School, he needs to chill.  

My own father was 21 when I was born and my mother was 17, and I as their child still think that was disgusting and creepy and that my father should have been dating people who weren't in high school.  I cannot imagine how it's going to feel growing up with a parent who was fresh out of school when you were born and a father who's old enough to qualify for the senior discount."

He's a sex-hingry dude looking for an easy lay and sees women who already have at least one kid as an easy target.  And it doesn't matter to him that by *dating* them and not just having casual sex, that there's an expectation that he is interested in eventually being in the kid's life if things work out.  

These are women clearly looking for a partner who's serious about settling down, and clearly going into this expecting it to lead to that if things work out.  But instead OP ""dates,"" them for the ""easy sex,"" and has no interest in ever settling down with her and her kid(s), and would rather rant and bitch and make it out like the mom is the bad guy and the moron for ever *imagining* that the man she's been consistently dating may actually want to be a serious part of her and her child's life someday."

And I understand that keeping them in school gives them the message that the adults in their life are confident they'll pull through.

But some kids are just going to die, and that's sad, and I just think that making a terminal child who doctors have already stated multiple times will not make it through high school, spend the precious little time they have left on doing math assignments and spelling tests and homework is so cosmically unfair to them as human beings.
