Parenting,fcjmm1t,t3_ehh8py,1577694039.0,"advice from a victim who was told the same “why would you report hes such a good guy” bs that a lot of people say: the biggest thing that empowered me to stay resilient was that i was helping keep him from not doing anything like that ever again. 

i often felt bad about reporting before i realized this. 

be mindful of what your daughter specifically feels bad about though, since if she feels like you’re minimizing her pain or saying she took one for the team it’d be devastating. 

basically, to anyone who doubts that she should’ve reported, tell them that he otherwise probably would’ve done it again."

dogs,fcip9dy,t1_fcilx7s,1577666593.0,"should i “go about my buisness” by continuing to have him sit and focus on me, or should i attempt to physically remove him from the situation? i’m trying to think of ways to keep his training consistent and keep the weird encounters to a minimum. thank you for the advice"
dogs,fcip2eb,t1_fcim13z,1577666467.0,"that’s unfortunately how i think i’m gonna have to play it. i feel bad because its not like i dont want to talk to them or say hi to their pup, just not right NOW... thank you for the advice"
dogs,fcioxkd,t1_fcilqz3,1577666391.0,"my only problem with walking away is that it makes my pup lose focus and start barking/ jumping around. i’m also pretty small and not very strong plus it’s hard to drag him away from other people because i really don’t want to hurt his paws (we are often on concrete, i live near a big city). 

do you think i should take the risk and yank him away? like, should i just drop that training moment and continue with the walk (usually i have him sit and focus on me until the people pass, and once he’s finished he gets a treat)"
