 (I have seen cases where there was plenty of proof but they were still denied asylum. One specific one was a guy who got killed after being deported, he actually left a video message stating he feared this is what will happen.)

Yes, it does depend on students and parents as well how the kids perform, however not everyone is doing well in school settings and tests. Many highly intelligent successful people didn't do well in school. So I would actually argue that the current school system is not an accurate reflection of students skills and intelligence."

As far as I can see at this point in time there are completely insufficient charge points. The distance of EV is adequate but not great. Maybe this will change in the next 10 years but I won't hold my breath.

At present there are 70 fast charge points in Ireland - the whole republic of Ireland that is.  There are around 1100 in the whole island of Ireland including northern Ireland.  I rarely see a charge point that is free.  

If you can charge at home and at work it's not a big problem. However not everyone owns there home and you can't install the charge point on a rented property. Nor do all work places have charge points.
