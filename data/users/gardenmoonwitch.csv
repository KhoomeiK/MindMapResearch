relationship_advice,ff799eu,t1_ff6xnbr,1579643704.0,"I mean, in what situations are you talking about smegma?  Is it over a dinner of white rice and soft cheeses?  Or is it in a situation where something she asked you to do could lead to a large buildup of smegma that could endanger your health?

Because it's not the same situation at all.

However, if it's relevant to the conversation and/or a serious issue for you, she shouldn't be rude about your health.  So yeah, if shes acting like you shouldn't have any bodily functions and should only exist to arouse her, then you should definitely dump her and find someone that treats you like an actual person and not a sex doll.

But I'm also pretty sure that as long as you shower once a day and know how to clean yourself at at least a 4th grade level, smegma shouldn't really be that much of an issue. 

Also, why are you talking about smegma that often?  Fetish?  Serious hygiene issue?

I think a more accurate comparison would be semen, or similar."

The worst though is spitting. Men just spit everywhere and think women will find it attractive and manly.  Its fucking gross.

Mind you, I have been exposed to a lot of red necks and toxic masculinity, so it might be different on the coasts and in different countries."
relationship_advice,ff780mt,t1_ff6t2gg,1579642929.0,"That's a false equivalence and you know it.  Dont play dumb so you can hate on women.

OP wore boxers or granny panties because they're COMFORTABLE.  Ladies panties are usually NOT more comfortable for men to wear than boxers, briefs, or boxer briefs.

But let's says for some reason, a dude is more comfortable in womans lace panties than boxers and he wants to wear them to bed.

Yes, she has every right to find them less attractive.  She doesnt, however, have the right to put her sexual arousal over his comfort.  

That is the problem here.  It's not that he finds her less attractive in certain things, because that's perfectly normal.  It's that he expects her to give up her personal comfort and choices to look sexy to him while hes not even awake.  

A good number of women prefer men in suits.  We find men far more attractive in a nice suit and tie than we do in ratty ass gym shorts and a pit stained t shirt.  But we know that suits aren't comfortable and so we would never expect men to wear them constantly. Because we know men are people with feelings and they werent put on the planet solely to make us aroused."
relationship_advice,ff76x4g,t1_ff75r52,1579642317.0,"It's mostly men though.  Studies have shown that women that have sex with other women orgasm as often as straight men.  Of course gay men orgasm the most.  Straight women orgasm the least.  

Also, men often get angry and sometimes get violent when women dont orgasm and dont fake it.  I unfortunately know from experience.  When you've been physically assaulted for not orgasming fast enough you learn to fake it."
