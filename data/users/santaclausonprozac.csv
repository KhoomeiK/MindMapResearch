As you progress you'll want to look up how to do certain things (I spent about 30 minutes trying to tame an Oviraptor before I gave in and looked up how the hell it's done), but the best part of Ark is actually experiencing it, not knowing about it before you do it. Everything is an experience; the first Dodo you tame, your first flyer, the first time you get raped by a Troodon (this one gets old quick), your first Rex... everything is so exciting the first time you experience it. I remember being scared to death the first time I encountered a Rex, I was literally shaking trying to get away. It won't be long before a Rex poses zero threat to you, and you'll miss that feeling. Just take your time and enjoy the game. And like others have said, for sure play single player first to get the hang of it"

And speaking of promises, I’ve seen reports that as far as keeping promises, or at least working towards them, he’s one of the better presidents we’ve had. As others have mentioned, the prison reform I thought was a good start, but could be bettered. I don’t know all of the specifics, but I do like the USMCA, especially as far as Mexico’s labor laws are concerned (however enforcement could be an issue). The Paris Agreement never really sat well for me, it was more or less the US severely limiting themselves to allow for other countries to be more lenient, which doesn’t make a whole lot of sense to me. And even after the agreement, hardly any of the countries had met their goals that they had set, so I didn’t really understand the outrage at him backing out when the agreement itself wasn’t all that effective. I think a renegotiation *might* have been better, but I don’t have a problem with backing out.
