Having said that, if you instill totalitarian level of controls & best practices... it can work. 

I still think overall that I prefer SSRS, but Tableau can do more, and looks prettier... it's just a serious piece of shit -- which would be OK if it weren't for the fact that they, as a company, pride themselves on what a piece of shit it is. 

Quick example: Ever tried to figure out how to be able to sort a cross tab? You know like say a cross tab with 10 columns with the furthest one to the right (e.g. last mod date), where you want to have the newest at the top, or the oldest at the top, and to generate a list based on the filters. Go ahead and Google that tell me how much you've learned about how Tableau *is* sorting, and you need to understand how sorting works, and how it can't do what you want because... it *is* sorting, and you just need to understand how sorting works. 

Or ever tried to get stuff out of Tableau for a PowerPoint? No native connectivity or support? Talk to your Tableau rep about that, and enjoy the conversation about how you need to learn how to present, and how that PowerPoint isn't the future. Enjoy the vast amounts of time you will waste leveraging Tableau over SSRS because Tableau simply doesn't care, or doesn't have the resources to integrate with PowerPoint.

Oh, and don't get me started on how the fonts break, alignments shift, etc. Go in to make one change, end up having to fuck around changing all sorts of things back to make it look a certain way (if you work for a company that mandates those kinds of things, but I digress.)

Anyway, having raged about all that... I'll take it over most other poisons from a front end perspective, but you really need control on the database side, and really need to have data sources which come with all necessary calculations already being done in SQL. If you start going down the calculated field path for anything other than formatting (i.e. a field equal to zero, named zero... which is fucking stupid to even have to do in the first place)... if you start going down that road you will hate yourself when you are managing hundreds of Tableau workbooks and you need to make a code change for something that is happening upstream. 

Suddenly a small tweak  involves you physically downloading a ton of workbooks, or data-sources, and republishing, where if everything is just saved as a view, or a view of a view, in a hierarchical architecture that is populated by sprocs... you just go up to the highest level, make the change, save it, and everything auto-updates.

funny,ffizv7q,t1_ffidqiv,1579986839.0,"I used to have a sort of phobia, or fear of calling 911 because of the possibility that it would result in an automatic police presence. In my later life since I've become an adult I find myself calling 911 at least once or twice a quarter, generally to report hazards on the freeway. 

Like a week ago there was a steel ladder in laying between the left and center lane. 911 can't help you, but they will connect you to the highway patrol dispatch... which doesn't really have a separate line that you can easily call. 

I keep my time on the call to an absolute minimum.

""Hello, I'm calling to report an obstruction on the freeway.""

""Thank you, I'll hold.""

""Hi, there is a construction ladder between the left and center lane going westbound on <insert freeway> just before/just after exit #, cars are swerving to avoid it.""

""Yes, that's correct. <repeats the information back a second time>.""

""Ok, thank you. Have a great day.""

After like 10 of those it has become routine, and I can hear a happy tone of the voice in the operators when I just get right to the point, tell them what's going on, give them the relevant information, and then hang up like it never happened.

What I've learned is that you should never assume someone else has called 911 already. Sometimes they've told me that they already have reports, and have someone on the way... other times you can tell they're surprised by the call. 

Other times they know about the call but don't understand the details. Witnessed a very minor car accident recently, where 911 was called and police were supposed to be dispatched. Turned into a really long (45+ minutes) wait... and I called 911 just to make sure someone had reported it, even though I knew someone had. 

What wasn't in the original report is that an occupant of the vehicle who had been hit was a 90+ year old Korean war veteran, who was, because the car was destroyed, having to stand on the side of the road in the sun waiting for the cops before friends could drive him home. He wasn't injured, but he couldn't exactly leave, and you could tell he was agitated/stressed from standing on the side of a road.

Upon letting 911 know this detail, a cop appeared within minutes, and instead of going through the normal protocol immediately expediting the process of making sure that man could get in a car and be driven home."

The actual events, however, regardless of whether they are argued to represent ""Chinese culture"" or not, can be evaluated on their continuity, and the sum of this allows us to evaluate how much culture has disappeared.

>I guess it would be better to phrase it as ""cultural practices in China"" instead of ""Chinese culture"" to be more precise, so as to not be hung up about the definition of ""Chinese culture"", which is really not useful a concept when evaluating the continuity of cultural practices as how much a practice represents ""Chinese culture"" is irrelevant to whether it has disappeared or remained.

history,ff1wgxa,t1_fezw0a3,1579487747.0,"To add to this, I've been thinking about it all day... let's compare Mao to Constantine. 

Did Constantine destroy or create culture? What about all the books of the ""bible"" that he destroyed, or all the traditions that didn't make the cut? He literally invented culture as we know it today at the expense of many competing ideas, many of which survived in the context of being non-Roman Catholic, for example the Coptic Christians in Ethiopia. Is their culture Roman? Is Roman culture Ethiopian? 

I'm not trying to be difficult, just pointing out how difficult these types of questions can become, and also pointing out that China, as an entity viewed through a modern lens, did not exist historically. The closest you might get would be the Han dynasty, and you can research how many Chinese today are Han, or at least claim to be Han, the Mongolian empire, or the Song dynasty.

None of these three examples encompass the full landmass of modern day China, and you have lots of problems in your explanation such as Taiwan, Tibet, and Korea. Even questions such as where does ""China"" begin/end and where does SE Asia start/stop become interesting when you look into Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. Then you get into areas near Pakistan, Afghanistan, and India, Nepal. 

You can probably correctly argue that China is a geographic region in the same way that the United States, or even Russia is a geographic region, and from a political perspective that it was somewhat inevitable that a state would eventually rise to control these regions due to natural land barriers. Expanding that explanation to add cultural significance is probably a stretch though, at least to me.

edit: And this is where Mao succeeded, by creating the concept of modern China. Lenin, and later Stalin did the same with Russia, or the USSR. In the USA it was more clear cut because a bunch of Europeans showed up in the Americas and just took over, then revolted. By comparison the Chinese and Russians did this well over a century later in areas which were not freshly conquered and under colonial rule."

There certainly were dynasties that ruled most of China, or even empires such as the Mongolians that conquered large parts of China, but the idea of there being one Chinese people, and one Chinese culture simply was never actualized prior to the communists, and as loathe as I am to credit Mao with anything, his greatest achievement was in unifying China and supplying it with this central image."

The curve between say 130 and 150 is pretty bland. I can't remember off hand but I think Mensa starts accepting people at like 132? When you get into the abstracts there doesn't seem to be really any discernible difference, per se, but you might see some really weird aberrations.

Some of these types, like John Nash, probably understand very specific things, in very specific ways, in a context that no one else will ever understand. Your Stephen Hawkings, Einsteins, Newtons, etc., are still tempered and limited on what they can tangibly produce with that hugely advanced intellect... and again, it generally only applies to one specific area, and even within that area, one specific niche.

Without an ounce of arrogance I can tell you that I'm smarter than most people that I meet, and that it is very rare that I meet someone who I consider an intellectual peer. Even rarer to meet someone that intellectually intimidates me.

My point here is that I can have a conversation about any topic that exists with someone who has an 120 IQ. I can get them to understand all but thee most advanced concepts, and I don't even need to get them to understand them, per se, because I can give them simpler analogies that represent whats going on. They might not be able to replicate the work themselves, but they can go forward and have very advanced/intellectual concepts with other people who do understand those inner mechanisms, and get work done to specifications/requirements they desire.

At a 120 IQ there is basically no topic, or no body of knowledge that is inaccessible to the person. 

An IQ of 100, or 105, is very different. I'll never be able to have advanced conversations with that person.

And when you get way up into the even higher IQ's... there's no real difference or advantage. You might, at best, be able to do a few things faster. If I really wanted to sit down and master tensor calculus, I have the ability. It pushes the limits of my ability, and taxes me, but I could do it. I would never be able to do it as well as others, or as fast as others... but if I really had the desire I could look at their work, probe it, and have very complex conversations with them about it. I might even find things that they missed, or be able to significantly contribute to it. 

Once you get around 130IQ you're at the top of human capability in terms of any significance. 120 is a very robust score. Your *average* person is, by definition, 100, which means that a lot of people are *below* 100. 

I'd wager that most people reading this now are at or above 110 because of the way scores skew by demographics.

personalfinance,fdbmkoe,t3_ekdnbo,1578258835.0,"Travel budgeting is all about my ability to get time off, and what if any commitments I have during that time off. For example, traveling back home for a week is pretty cheap. I have a free place to stay, food is free, and it just costs a plane ticket. If someone is getting married and I have to fly home, that might eat into 3-5 days of my total yearly vacation time.

On the other hand, I might be able to take 10 days off around the holidays, but again, if I'm flying home to see family for the holidays then this isn't going to cost a lot.

It becomes a lot harder to take 10 days off at some other random point in the year, and a lot harder to predict. In my field we respond to production issues, and we never know what kind of production issues we might have next week, next month, or next quarter. 

I can book a 10 day expensive trip to the other side of the world well in advance, but it becomes a pain in the ass if things are blowing up and I need to jump on a call from a foreign country. My company gives unlimited PTO, but we're expected to be there for critical issues if we're on vacation (which makes sense if we're the sole SME, and no one can fix anything until we check in.)

Anyway, I look at the calendar and try to carve out time that makes sense. It's easy to get 5 days off if Monday is a holiday. I can then decide I want to fly somewhere to travel, but obviously not somewhere halfway around the world.

Once I figure out the times I want off, which naturally leads into where I can go... then I start ballparking expenses. Most of the time I'm traveling to see family/friends, so expenses are minimal.

Cooking,fcvxz68,t1_fctmfxy,1578012653.0,"I said the same thing in another comment, but honestly over 20 years of cooking I can count on one hand the times I've done something really good ""on the fly"" as opposed to sitting down beforehand and thinking things out.

I have no formal education. I've worked with a chef in the past for years, but there was no reason that I decided to add lemon, parm, and red pepper. I tasted the sauce as it was and thought those things would compliment it nicely, so I added them and tried it. The visual look of the sauce, and the taste of it somewhat reminded me of a piccata (lemon & arthichokes) so it made a connection and I thought it would be a good experiment.

Overall I was somewhat disappointed with how bland the final product was. It was very good, but lacked a certain oomph that I've come to expect from good cooking. This oomph is something that is probably going to take me a few years to test into as I try different ingredients and ways of preparing the dish.

My current thought is to do some kind of lobster ravioli and serve this on top. I'm not sure why but my experience is telling me lobster would work really well with this sauce since it's so 'bland.' 
'
I also see a lot of posts and comments about similar recipes that use butternut squash, but honestly I have no ambition to switch. I've always liked roasting acorn squash, and eating them as they are, so I want to keep with that as the main ingredient. In a very weird way I like the fact that it doesn't actually taste like squash.

I see other comments about how squash is used in vegan recipes as a substitute, but I really have no ambition to go down that road either. If anything this only encourages me to pair it with cream and cheese. 

And lobster.

Maybe roasted red peppers.

From here it could become a bisque or a soup instead of a pasta dish, or continue to evolve as a pasta dish. I don't know. Time and experimentation will tell. There are several dishes that I have been experimenting with over time, all of which I've researched or inherited from others and slowly made my own... but this one is a little different in as much as it was an unplanned, happy accident.

When I posted here I kind of expected other people to chime in with recipes, or similar ways this is done... because it just tasted too good for someone else to have not tried on their own.

As I get a bit older and reflect back on my experience I am becoming less tied to the concept of recipes, or ways of doing things, and more focused on specific techniques. Over the holidays my BIL cooked these scallops that would have put mine to shame. He didn't even have a recipe. He just sauteed them and focused on technique, and they were the best scallops I had ever had. If I had cooked them I would have been focused on a sauce, or a specific scallop dish, or a specific recipe... like specific instructions.

He had none of that. He just cooked scallops the right way, and his simple impromptu sauce was elevated because of it.

That probably isn't advice I would get a newer cook, to just ignore recipes and abandon them completely in favor of focusing strictly on technique, but maybe for a newer cook it is good to have that in the back of your mind as you hyper-focused on mastering specific recipes."
