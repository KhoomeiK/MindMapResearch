I will concede that China is no bastion of perfect democracy, as if any nation ever has been, but to decry it while ignoring other nation's long history of human rights violations does your ""intellectual conversations"" no credit.

Your beliefs are important and valid. No, we can't spend every moment of every day banging our drums and stay sane. However, our beliefs can't be made of wet paper either.

I do not know your life, but from what I read from the comments, you seem fine to me. It's okay to be excited when you realize that there is a solution to a lot of today's problems and that there are comrades who agree. I'm in that boat now.
