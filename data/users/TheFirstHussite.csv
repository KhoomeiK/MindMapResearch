horror,fficejk,t1_ffi56ty,1579970532.0,So far I'd say yes. I haven't seen the movie in a long time and when I did I was a bit let down because my mom always went on and on about how much it scared her when it came out. I was pretty desensitized buy then. And I don't remember Kinderman seeming so menacing like he does in the book.
