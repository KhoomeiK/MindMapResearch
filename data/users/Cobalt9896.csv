As for just cause, drop it down to medium low, just don’t touch the effect quality because that’s the explosions and you will be fine. So as long as you don’t mind playing on medium then you should get it. Also if it runs bad and you haven’t played more then two hours you can refund it. Hope this was helpful. Also do you know what your processor is? It might make a small difference in performance"
