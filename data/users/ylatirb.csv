Just know that your life is in your hands. If you don't like it, then you can make changes to improve it. Find a reason to be better for yourself, and the find other people who inspire you to keep it up. Share your goals with your partner and ask for their encouragement. Make small goals and set out to achieve them. Most importantly though, you need to set the goals for yourself. You're the only one you need to prove yourself to - everyone else will simply enjoy your company through your journey."

findareddit,ff7lxfp,t1_ff79vry,1579652694.0,"It's good that you have a full time job. What do you do? And do you enjoy it? - could you set yourself some little goals to achieve throughout the day to bring some sense of achievement into your days?

And that is really good that you get yourself out and about as well. As long as you're up and moving, you're making positive steps. It's okay if you don't talk to many people while you're out, but you might do so more as time goes on. You could also find some sort of community project to work on, or maybe do some volunteering? Something that is more conducive to meeting people and random socialising?

Also it's okay if you spend your spare time gaming. If it's bothering you how much time you do spend on them though, you could start trying to give yourself a time limit, or trade out one day a week for a different hobby. You could read a book (or listen to an audiobook if you struggle to read like me), try painting along to Bob Ross, or something else :)

relationship_advice,ff5yhs1,t3_errja4,1579614342.0,"My ex partner used to guilt trip me as well for not having a sex drive while I was on the pill or had Implanon. It was really unhealthy and he made me feel miserable over it. I barely enjoyed sex after that because it was always to please him rather than being into it myself or waiting for a time that I could get caught up in the moment. 

The best advice I can offer you from my own experiences.. 
Speak to him. Stand up for yourself and tell him how important this is for you. Do some research on contraceptives to show him how much they can affect libido. It is going to take you time to adjust because your whole body is affected by these hormones. 
If he doesn't listen and doesn't make an effort to be attentive, then if day this probably isn't going to be very healthy long term. 

My partners since the ex mentioned above have been so considerate to my pain during sex, and understanding with things around contraceptives while I was still taking them and my decisions not to die to the severe effects it had on me such as unprovoked constant depressions and no sex drive. 

You deserve to be listened to and heard.

TrueOffMyChest,ff4s90k,t3_erneb8,1579571205.0,"That sounds really awful :( I'm so saddened by your situation. 
Do you have a salvation army story or something nearby? I'm sure they would be willing to donate some clothes to you. There would have to be some sort of service nearby as well where you could maybe collect some food. Ask your local bakery if they could save some bread they might be throwing out - it would still be good for a few days. 
A cheap food option that you could buy in bulk for very cheap would be oats/porridge. It's good with milk but can be made with water easily and just sprinkle some sugar for taste. 
Best way to prevent roaches and spiders is to try and keep the house as clean as possible. I'm sure you already have a lot on your plate, but perhaps you could all make a day of it together.

I had a somewhat similar experience when I was much younger, however I don't have an answer to my friends whereabouts.. 

I spent a lot of time on online chat platforms and interactive platforms like Habbo hotel when I was still in primary school, back when MSN was the thing. I had a friend I'd speak to regularly, a girl from New Zealand who was a few years older than me. I was around 10-13 I think, and she was 17. We would jump online pretty regularly and chat about all sorts of things, but every now and again she would disappear for a week or so. For quite a while I didn't know why other than her saying she was sick. Then she told me she was going into hospital one day because she had a hole in her heart, so was constantly needing to go in for treatments. 
We kept talking for quite a while after that, with her occasionally disappearing. And then one day I realised I hadn't heard from her in a while. I sent messages, but she never accessed those accounts again. I didn't have any mutual contacts with her, so I can't say for sure what happened or if she is alive today. 

Regardless, I'm really sorry for the loss of your friend. I'm glad you have some good memories of them, and I hope your heart can find some peace in knowing he was probably grateful to have you to reach out to in times of need."

Nausea can be linked to your inner ear so I'm not surprised you would be experiencing that with your symptoms, and the headaches as well. Persistent swelling around your ear would be bound to cause headaches eventually. 

I probably wouldn't stop on the antibiotics unless your doc tells you so, and drink plenty of water - with any infection it's important to stay hydrated. I imagine having some discharge come out would be relieving of the pressure. 

Hopefully someone can at least recommend some painkillers in the meantime, like if paracetamol would be better than ibuprofen in this case, and whether a hot or cold compress would maybe offer some relief. 

It sounds super painful and just generally exhausting. I hope you feel better soon. Please go back to your doctor"
