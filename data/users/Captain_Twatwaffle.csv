MakeupAddiction,fdzvi4w,t1_fdzp1fr,1578796780.0,"I know my friend often uses some sort of illuminator underneath a sheer spot concealer. Generally the more sheer the better.

The problem is you really have to either 100% cover them or barely cover them, anything in between can look odd.

For your wedding, you're going to have a good photographer so I would trust your natural beauty here, applying sheer products to highlight your freckles, and maybe an under-foundation illuminator for light and angles. 

Just my 2 cents. 

Oh, just realized this is my troll account. Lol."

Take a breath. Ask yourself if this disregard for your feelings is a normal part of your relationship. Ask if your needs and wants are being met.

If not, communicate with him and gauge his reaction. If he again acts as if your feelings are unwarranted and overreacting, he’s (whether accidentally or purposely) kinda gaslighting you, which is indicative of either abusive behavior or an obscene amount of obliviousness.

There are people you can talk to about this. Don’t feel alone. Don’t feel trapped. You’re going to be ok."
