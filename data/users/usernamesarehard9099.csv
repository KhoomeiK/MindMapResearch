Mitch McConnell once fillibustered his own bill because democrats liked it and wanted to vote on it,  the ACA was a republican proposed compromise to universal healthcare but as soon as the dems agreed with it and wanted to make it happen it suddenly became ""Obamacare"" and they started to torpedo it. Republican leaders said in 2009 that their top priority would be making sure Obama was a 1 term president and in 2016 said that if Hillary were elected they would continue to hold a supreme court seat hostage for another 4 years.

In certain areas, like Kruger NP, they are doing quite well and actually exceeding carrying capacity of those areas. Transporting them to other areas for rerelease is not always viable bc africa is huge and elephants are hard to move, so hunting wouldn't be that bad. Hunting that is properly managed, where the number of tags given out is scientifically informed and the money goes back into conservation, is a net positive.

Your actions aren't directly killing him, only indirectly. With the pushing, you are directly killing the fat man to save the other 5. And it is really not your moral imperative to make that decision, you don't get to choose to sacrifice his life bc it's his decision to make. That's how I see it personally.

You are in an adjacent room watching through a small window. The man starts to slit the children's throats, one at a time. The children are all crying, terrified as they watch their peers be butchered. No amount of pleading will stop him. You can't get into the room to physically overpower him (even if you could, he is far too big to do so) and you can't get the kids out. There is no one else around who could hear you call for help. You have a gun, which you know how to use and are a good shot with, and a clean line of sight to the man. Would you kill him to save the kids?"
