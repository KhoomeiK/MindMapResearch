WritingPrompts,feo46fe,t3_eq2xnr,1579294915.0,"My girlfriend and I had met just a month ago, but we knew we were perfect for each other. We did everything together, made each other laugh, and always knew how to cheer each other up. One day at my house, she decided she wanted some watermelon for breakfast. As soon as she cut it open, a genie popped out. 

“I am the watermelon genie. For freeing me, you get one wish.”

“I thought it was three wishes?” 

“It’s one. For both of you. Take it or leave it.” 

“Can we think about it first?” 

“Of course.”

My girlfriend and I talked about it, she said she had always wanted bread for feet but I convinced her that would be a terrible idea. I suggested we wish that we wake up next to each other every day, she agreed it would be really cute. 

About a year, all the things we did that we used to think were cute ended up driving us crazy. We couldn’t stand the sight of one another. So we had to break up. 

We both ended up moving in with our parents. The next morning, she woke up and saw me lying next to her. 

“What the fuck are you doing? We broke up. You need to get out or I’m calling the police.”

“I don’t know how I got here... I was in my room when I went to sleep last night.”

That’s when we remembered the wish. 

“Well that ended up being a total waste. Why didn’t we wish for super powers or something?” 

She didn’t appreciate my joke. 

“This is serious. I don’t want to wake up to you every day for the rest of my life. We need a plan.”

“We found a genie in a watermelon once, maybe we can do it again. Until then I guess we’ll have to deal with waking up together every day.”

“What will we do with all the watermelon though?”

“Maybe make watermelon jam? Remember how much we used to love making jam together?”

“Sounds kind of disgusting to be honest. But I guess we’ll give it a shot.”

A couple years went by. Our jam business was booming, our love had been rekindled, and we completely forgot about finding the genie. One day, she was cutting open a watermelon when another genie popped out. 

She thought for a moment. “Oh right! The whole reason we started this! To undo our last wish! Hun, do you still want to undo it?”

“No” I smiled. “Let’s be together forever.” 

“That’s a wonderful idea.” We kissed and made our wish.

It wasn’t long before we drove each other crazy. We couldn’t understand why we got back together, so we broke up again. As she was walking away, she suddenly got pulled back to me like a magnet. 

“What the hell...” then we remembered our last wish. 

“Well fuck.”"
