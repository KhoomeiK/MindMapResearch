The book r/dannns3 recommended is one of the best ones but if you have access to a college library (or even Google Scholar), Csikszentmihalyi has several published articles on the subject.

Some things that help me are to make sure I'm well rested and have eaten well that morning. Even more important than that, though, is to make sure you're working at your 'peak' time. We all have a time of the day that if you examine your day, you are most productive. For me that's around 10-11am (*which is why, to me, the whole practice of having a noon lunch break is really, really stupid because it interrupts my flow and I can't get it back at 1pm. unfortunately at my office it's mandated*).

I haven't read enough on it to know if you can manually alter your peak work time but I imagine you could if you changed your sleep and eating habits. My peak time seems to be a combination of getting over my ""sleep hangover"" as I call it and the energy from my breakfast kicking in maximally. From around 10am - 12pm I work uninterrupted and the time flies by without me even noticing. It only ends at 12 because, as I said above, we're forced to break for lunch at my office."
StopGaming,ffewobq,t3_et4tg5,1579868600.0,"I was very much in the same place as you last year but with alcohol instead of weed and gaming. I had been a year sober but felt like my life was going nowhere, everything was happening too slowly. I was severely depressed which **wasn't fair** because I was sober now... life was supposed to be better and I felt worse! My therapist had to remind me more than once that even if I did *nothing* tomorrow, I was still sober which is a hell of a lot better than I was the year before.

I think that immediately after quitting something you're flushed with positive emotions and motivation and that's where all those ""I feel so much better"" posts come from. In A.A. it's called ""the pink cloud"". It goes away pretty quickly though and since those people who told us how great they felt probably never come back to update us, we assume they're off living their best life.

You're right though. Quitting your addiction isn't the cure for anxiety and depression. Your addiction is a result of anxiety and depression, not a cause of it (of course it certainly makes it worse, though). When you remove gaming, you've removed your coping mechanism which, even though it was unhealthy, was at least helping you deal with it. So, if you don't replace gaming with a healthier hobby that helps you to mitigate your anxiety, you'll *probably* relapse."

First off, like other people have said, you need to start taking advice that is being offered to you from your family. They want the best for you and even if they present it in a shitty way (mine always did), they're usually on to something.

I think that step one is making friends with some guys. Easier said than done, I know, and it's always frustrating to read because it's like ""OBVIOUSLY BUT IF I KNEW HOW I'D DO IT"" lol. Think of some things that interest you... maybe you don't have interests besides being on the computer, if so then think of some things that COULD interest you. Then find some meetups that revolve around those things. There are plenty of online tools for finding meetups ([meetup.com](https://meetup.com) is the most obvious one) and I've found they really do work. One of my friends recommended trivia nights at bars / pubs but I'm a recovering alcoholic so that doesn't work for me... maybe it would for you?

I also have the thought that at my age (almost 40) all of the good women are gone... and it's basically true. It sucks but that's just the way it is. There's nothing we can do about it so there's no point feeling sorry for ourselves. Don't settle, though. I realize you're a virgin and that sucks but you'll feel even worse if you're stuck in a relationship with a shitty woman. I think online dating is the absolute scum of the internet... you'll probably eventually hook up with somebody if you keep trying it but they won't be awesome. Work on your other problems first and better women will come along."

I'm often crippled from making comments on Reddit because I fear being downvoted into oblivion. It's not that I care about karma, it's just having something I said universally hated by everybody.

StopGaming,ff5sg0z,t1_ff5akx3,1579608501.0,"It's difficult to say because while addiction is a universal process, the reasons behind it and the severity of it are unique to the individual. For me, gaming addiction is nothing compared to alcohol addiction. I am very confident that I'll be able to quit gaming whereas I tried to quit alcohol for a decade on my own and was unable to until I admitted to myself that I needed rehab. Since then, like magic, I haven't touched a drop. It's unfortunate that there isn't something like that for other addictions.

Explaining what alcohol addiction feels like is hard and that's part of the reason addicts (of all kinds, not just alcohol and drugs) are still demonized by society: nobody can really understand what it's like until they've experienced it. If you're a gaming addict you have some idea, but alcohol has a few other tools in its belt that things like gaming, porn, and gambling don't have.

The chemical aspect is the real kicker. Alcohol rewires your brain into thinking that you need it to survive. You don't even get to decide if you want to drink or not; you don't get that far. The feeling of needing a drink is even more powerful than starving. You can't argue with it rationally because it's futile to try to argue with an emotion using words. Once you've been drinking long enough, the only time you can feel joy or satisfaction is while getting drunk. Many alcoholics, myself included, don't even like *getting drunk*. It's just the unfortunate consequence of drinking alcohol, which is what we really need.

Finally there's the relapse possibilities. I'd wager that there will be a time, if I work on myself and keep my priorities straight, that I could play games an hour or so a week. That's not true for everybody of course. But I know in my soul that if I ever take a sip of alcohol again, my life will spiral back down to hell. Maybe not at first... I might be able to go to a bar with friends and have a couple drinks and convince myself that it was just a special occasion. But then there will be another, and another, and before long I'll be drinking alone in my bedroom playing f\*\*\* Stardew Valley for 14 hours straight. lol.

This is a long post and still barely touches what I could say on alcohol addiction. It's just a complicated thing, as is game addiction. For me, though, quitting games simply amounts to getting my priorities in order and finding alternate hobbies. There was absolutely no chance of doing that when I was drinking.

The answer to ""is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ addiction really that bad?"" is always yes. Addiction is a compulsion that prevents you from living your life the way you're supposed to, keeping you trapped in a shell.

Gaming is a lot like my alcoholism, in my mind. I can't just cut back. I had to completely quit drinking, and I'll have to completely quit gaming. Even telling myself I'm just going to jump into a game for an hour will inevitably throw me back into a hole where I'm spending the entire weekend playing.

Life for me has been changing for the past 2 years ever since I quit drinking so it's hard to tell what's from gaming less and what's just from my brain repairing itself, but there's a night and day difference in my personality, self-esteem, and thoughts. When I have flashbacks of things I did 5 years ago I feel nothing but shame and embarrassment. Stuff like that doesn't happen anymore. Even if something does embarrass me now, it's always something funny not shameful.

You say that you don't have anything you're proud of other than your law school accomplishments. I think that's a pretty good thing to have at your age and it takes up a lot of your time so it makes sense that you don't feel like you have ""more"" than that. You're doing what people your age are *supposed* to be doing and if you do manage to cut back or quit gaming, you'll probably be very successful in your career.

As for what to fill free time with... ugh... still working on that. I'm interested in music and writing but sometimes I just don't want to do those things, lol. I work full time and am also in college so that takes a fair bit of time. I also really love to cook but fell out of the habit when gaming took over for my drinking so I'm trying to get back into cooking regularly. I was working out for a long time but after a bad experience with antidepressants at the end of last year I haven't been able to get myself back to the gym. I will, though.

I just liked games and hated being outside, lol. Never felt like I was good enough to pick up a different hobby. I did like writing and drawing but over time, gaming took over. Now these days I'd of course say I have ADHD... Depression not so much. I get depressed when I play games for a month straight but I don't think that's the same as being clinically depressed. I actually took antidepressants for most of 2019 and that's the first time I've ever felt like killing myself. No more of those that's for sure!
You cant blame anything on the games, they're a symptom of whatever problem is causing us to game all day. Just like alcoholics cant blame alcohol... It's not the beer that makes you want to drink all day. Estallen makes a good point about how the pattern of gaming all day messes up your dopamine circuit. Dopamine is pretty much the most important thing in the universe when it comes to motivation. When you F that up, nothing good comes of it."

I study for school and certification exams which takes a lot of my evening, but I'm also getting back into music production, learning piano and to read sheet music, and practicing photography.

StopGaming,fenxdja,t1_fenfytt,1579292187.0,"I've been trying to figure out how to answer your questions without writing a book for a few minutes now, lol. There have been volumes written on what we should base our trust upon and they don't always agree. In my opinion, you should first evaluate whether or not you actually even CARE about what's being discussed or if it's just something that rubs you the wrong way. I think 99% of things can be filtered out this way. There's no point in wasting your time arguing something that you're going to forget about tomorrow morning, somebody else who is actually passionate about it will do that for you if it's important enough.

Then, I think the best way to research something is through scholarly articles... or at the very least websites that list some sort of reference for where they got their information. Surprisingly few websites, even news media sites, do this. Scholarly articles aren't flawless, nothing is, but if you read enough of them on the same thing you can put together a picture of what the truth is for yourself.

As for how my studies have led me to different opinions, that's hard to say concisely. I guess the best way to put it is that I used to think I was right about everything just because I could Google something really quick that aligned with my preconceived beliefs. The truth is, though, the majority of the internet is extremely biased and if I really wanted to know something I had to face the fact that I was probably wrong about most of what I thought I knew. Most of what I care about these days is nutritional science and fitness so that's what I had to learn a lot of new things about, and that's really the only part of the original post that I'm slightly disagreeing with (not even disagreeing 100% I just think that it's very simplified and leaves out a lot of important information which is fine for a Reddit post and is why I didn't get into it). I don't know anything about the rest. Aside from that I study computer science which fortunately has known right and wrong answers so I don't have to search very far to learn about that. :D

I'm not an expert by any means but I'll tell you how I built mine. CPU is of course going to be the most important factor as far as I know, as a really fast multi-core processor will get you the lowest latency in your audio. Unless you're composing something nuts with like 64 tracks, though, most mid-range CPUs these days are going to do just fine. I have a Ryzen 7 2700 and it runs Maschine flawlessly, even with all 8 groups playing. I haven't used anything besides Maschine on this PC yet... saving up for Ableton 10 with Push myself.

I've read some sites that say RAM isn't that important and that 8GB is fine but I haven't found this to be the case, especially if you're using hardware controllers and lots of tracks. I have 16GB and I think that's the lowest I'd go for an audio workstation. I don't think you need to get into the nitty gritty details on your RAM like you do with gaming so I didn't worry about the latency or pc speed (as they pertain to RAM ratings) when I bought mine.

Aside from the obvious, storage space, if you do plan on getting into hardware more, you might want to invest in a motherboard that supports Firewire or Thunderbolt (ideally Thunderbolt). Lots of newer audio interfaces take advantage of Thunderbolt as it's so fast it doesn't add any perceivable latency to your audio.

Just my 2 cents, like I said I'm not a pro. I just like building PCs and like playing with music gear. Fortunately, liking music gear means I didn't have to give up building PCs when I gave up gaming!"

The games we play say a lot about why we play them though. Did you play GTAV online or single player? Does it fulfill a social need for you? That's a really difficult one to get over because it's legitimately scarier and harder to go out and meet people in real life if you haven't been doing it. I'm right there with you.

Everything starts with one day, though. Don't play today. Don't even feel obligated to dive into a new hobby or anything. Just relax and watch some movies and eat your favorite food. Let your brain realize that you can feel okay without games. From there you start to incorporate new ways to fill the time (because you don't want to be sitting around watching movies and eating all day forever, that's not a good replacement lol). The first go-to EVERYBODY recommends is some sort of physical activity because we can say with virtual certainty that none of us are as physically fit as we should be.

Some days you may genuinely have nothing important to do but you can still ask yourself if your time would be better spent learning a new skill or creating something. Don't want to dive too much into that because it starts to go beyond the scope of your question and we all do of course need leisure and social time every day; it sounds like gaming could provide that for you. You just don't want it to be disproportionate to the rest of your week.

Ultimately it's going to be up to you to gauge how you feel. If you and your friends play a game for 4 hours and afterward you feel like a worthless hollow shell, that was probably too much. I think any behavior expert would say that 30 hours of video games a week is a lot. That's probably close to what I played and I definitely did not feel good about myself.
