He likes models, and not settling down with just one person, this isn't a secret or a dupe. Citing some other hypothetical person duping someone has nothing to do with him. Unless you have evidence that he's telling each girl ""YOU are the one for me, I want to be with you forever"", I see no reason to assert that he's doing that. I mean he's a multimillionaire famous actor considered to be handsome by many women, it's not exactly a stretch that a girl would be interested in being with him even short term. I think that's probably why he's never liked parading girls around, he probably doesn't want it to be seeing as this big ""thing"" where everyone is calling them the ""it"" couple like Brad and Angelina, which I think is a respectful way of handling it. Why pretend that something is long term if it's not going to be? As long as that's clear in the relationship then what's the harm? I mean I've had summer flings before or short term relationships where we both knew going in that it was temporary, and when the time came to go our separate ways, we did so amicably. It's not just a celebrity thing.

And to clarify I think it's pretty objectively true that dating a 17 year old is different than dating girls in their 20s, but even in that situation, she and Jerry were together for 4 years, which anyone would call a long term relationship, and the relationship only ended because Shoshanna missed NYC and the constant press coverage of the relationship was too much for her so she broke up with him.

dataisbeautiful,fdj64oz,t1_fdizfv0,1578459512.0,"You said on the question of why it's ""creepy""

>The ridiculous power dynamic  
>  
>The same reason its illegal with anyone younger, except now its legal.

I'm straight up asking you to clarify, since I don't see how you're tying those two together. I asked a question. You're comparing societal status differences to literal pedophilia/statutory rape, which I for the life of my can not understand. Are you saying that two people of unequal social status or power shouldn't date or have sex? I mean feel free to explain what you mean because I seriously don't know what you're trying to say. If money is power then a billionaire should only be able to date other billionaires? Someone extremely popular and famous should only date or have sex with someone else who is extremely famous or popular? If that's your point then it's ridiculous, and in no way should you be comparing it to having sex with children. 

Either way you miss the point about why certain power imbalances are outlawed. The reason why teachers aren't allowed to date students even when the two are close in age and both legally adults, is because the student doesn't have the choice to avoid the person of authority and is put in a situation where the person may not be able to say no. In most places you MUST go to school under the law, and therefore pursuing that particular romance may be outright illegal in the eyes of the law even if the teacher and student are very close in age. 

The same reason why in many companies a boss can't date his subordinate, because the subordinate is then in a position where saying no to the authority figure is difficult and it's in the interest of the employer to just ban office place romances altogether or they must report them to HR or risk being fired. But office romances aren't illegal on the basis of them being office romances. It's when it spills into the realm of sexual harassment that they're illegal.

Power imbalances on some scale are always going to exist between individuals. The issue is when a person abuses the power they have. I mean if you get down to the most basic of power imbalances, physical power imbalances, nearly every woman involved with a man is at a disadvantage. You'll never get rid of all power imbalances, and anyone can find SOME way of damaging an individual, be that physically, emotionally, etc. Harvey Weinstein wasn't a creep because he was having sex with people in Hollywood, he was a creep because he was intentionally making sex with him a prerequisite to gaining roles and he was sexually extorting women. We have laws against that type of behavior which is why he's currently fucked. 

People in close social circles tend to have sex with each other. That's why models have sex with actors, singers have sex with athletes, and rich people have sex with gorgeous women in general because surprise surprise, gorgeous women like to be around rich men and vice versa. 

So I'm asking are you saying that we should is put some type of law in place that would prevent people of certain wealth, social standing, etc. from dating or having sex with someone with unequal social status even if people are overwhelmingly attracted to that person because of those statuses? 

And did you not strawman by saying ""your idea that literally nothing can make someone creepy""? Because who said that? Please point specifically to where someone said that literally nothing can make you creepy."

It literally derides him for ""not showing an excess of emotion"" with his girlfriends while they're out in public. What the fuck? Imagine thinking this is okay.

I never realized how much of a black nationalist he really is. It's pretty fucked how he justifies his legal decisions considering this. One interesting part:

 **COREY ROBIN** Yes. This is the constitution that Clarence Thomas states forthrightly was created by slave holders and racists. Now, one would think that Thomas would want to have very little to do with that constitution, but that's not the case. And I think here we come to the heart of the most unsettling parts of his vision. He has said the salvation of the black race depends upon black men and that one of the byproducts of liberalism was what he calls the rights revolution. These rights made life easier and more tractable, and black men began to disintegrate. They lost their authority. They lost their will. They lost their discipline. And the results for the black community are catastrophic.

**BROOKE GLADSTONE** Because the burdens they faced were so much greater.

**COREY ROBIN** Exactly. So what Thomas believes is that we need to recreate those conditions of exigency and constraint and adversity, because under the harshest, most exigent conditions, black men will rise to their potential greatness. They will overcome precisely in the way that his grandfather overcame.

**BROOKE GLADSTONE** How does it play out in his decisions? 

**COREY ROBIN** In order to recreate those conditions,Thomas also tries to enhance the white constitution, the antebellum constitution. And one of the features of that constitution were harsh conditions of punishment. And Thomas believes that one of the most terrible things the Warren Court did, the liberal Warren Court of the mid century, was to mitigate the conditions of punishment, to introduce the federal courts, to oversee the practice of punishment and imprisonment, that should be the province of local governments in states. And Thomas would like to actually empower the state to punish, even if, and sometimes it seems, particularly if that state is racist.

**BROOKE GLADSTONE** That's perverse.

**COREY ROBIN** It's the most unsettling part, I think, of Thomas's vision, but it comes from this idea that it was under Jim Crow when black men rose to the level that someone like his grandfather did and were able to create enclaves of black autonomy and black separation and black community."
