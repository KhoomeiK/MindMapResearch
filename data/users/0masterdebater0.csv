>This study has made it possible to clarify the role of big game hunting in Africa, and more specifically in West
Africa.
This role is negligible from an economic and social point of view, particularly in light of the considerable
surface areas concerned. Therefore, big game hunting has a rather negative effect on development.
As regards conservation, big game hunting gives mixed results:
x There is great disparity between zones.
x The results of conservation, for the same level of management, are lower than those obtained by
neighbouring national parks.
x Hunting areas are less able to withstand pressure from the peripheral areas than national parks.
x Hunting areas take up vast areas of land: 15% of the territory of the 11 main hunting countries (for
around 18 500 tourist hunters/year), which is in addition to the 9.5% taken up by other protected
areas. The total is well above the recommended 12%, which could be counterproductive and cannot
be acceptable to local communities in the long term.
This means that in the future, hunting areas will play a lesser role in conservation strategies than they have
in the past.
The strong point of hunting areas in terms of conservation is that they are self-financing: this is an important
advantage, particularly in a context where funding is hard to come by.
Certain conservation strategies have been based on a theory developed around thirty years ago, according
to which wildlife had an economic value which would convince local communities to preserve it. All the
figures, maps and data consulted show that this theory is in fact untenable and that the economic value is
not sufficient to generate the expected behaviour change.
It is in the interests of the big game hunting sector to change its way of thinking and communicating, and to
reposition itself clearly where it can have a positive effect as conservation agent. Unless this is done within
an overall strategy, reticence regarding hunting may grow, as seen in the decision taken this year by
Botswana. Indeed, the socio-economic figures of big game hunting are too low to convince local decisionmakers or the leaders of a country.
This conservation strategy must integrate hunting into a wider protected area network. The current networks
are for the most part inherited from the colonial period and are run according to obsolete economic theories.
The protected area network now needs to be defined in light of current realities:
x Demographic explosion and the legitimate search for land for agriculture and livestock,
x The global tourism explosion,
x The transfer of land and wildlife usage rights to the local communities and the creation of
community-private sector partnerships
x the notion of services rendered by ecosystems
x The emergence of sustainable financing mechanisms
x Environmental awareness.
To become players in conservation, hunting areas must first of all collaborate in conservation efforts. This
means that they must no longer prey on other protected areas. A change in mentality is needed because
national parks are not there to produce game for local hunters."

In some species, such as Rhinos, culling older males that are no longer mating is necessary so younger males are able to pass their genes, but, that isn't necessary true for all large game species.

Auctioning off big game hunts can be a big windfall for conversationalists, but in many cases, more money goes middlemen and to corrupt government officials, not conservation.

Also, sometimes trophy hunters think they are doing business with a legit organization but later find out they were actually poachers.

politics,fcqzpid,t1_fcqq9on,1577894624.0,"At least 500? More like the very beginning.

That's why Luke and Matthew are so different, con men playing to a different audience.

For instance, the whole Christmas narrative in Luke is easily proven to be false as he got the date of the census the death of King Herod backwards as Herod died 9 years before the census was conducted in 6AD (not 1AD).

Luke did this because he wanted to fulfill the prophecy that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem. This is why he also invented Herod killing the male children and the family fleeing into Egypt. He wanted the connection to Moses.

Now every year millions of people celebrate some dudes fan fiction origin story from 2000 years ago."

The vast majority of eggs available in america the birds are fed on chicken feed, weather it be called ""cage free,"" ""free range"", ""organic,"" whatever, the birds still spend their life eating industrial feed.

If you can find someone that lets the birds roam around feeding on bugs, worms etc. the eggs taste soooo much better."

I personally think that version has a better message, but what Aurelius actually wrote was closer to,

""You may leave this life at any moment: have this possibility in your mind in all that you do or say or think. Now departure from the world of men is nothing to fear, if gods exist: because they would not involve you in any harm. If they do not exist, or if they have no care for humankind, then what is life to me in a world devoid of gods, or devoid of providence? But they do exist, and they do care for humankind: and they have put it absolutely in man's power to avoid falling into the true kinds of harm. If there were anything harmful in the rest of experience, they would have provided for that too, to make it in everyone's power to avoid falling into it; and if something cannot make a human being worse, how could it make his life a worse life?""

As you can see it's much less ambiguous about the existence of the gods."

And, just as the Christians appropriated the winter solstice to celebrate the birth of their Messiah, now corporations have appropriated Christmas to be about consumerism and the buying of gifts.

If Jesus was actually born during the Roman census the way it is described in Luke, then he would not have been born in December as the census was not carried out in winter because that would be stupid. Also that census would have occurred in 6CE, so not only did they get the date wrong they were off by many years. Also King Herod died nine years before the census so yeah there's definitely a continuity error going on in that little book of fairytales."
