WatchPeopleDieInside,fee8132,t1_fee4ipu,1579028304.0,"Probably not. The origin of the mistreatment of natives came from when Europeans arrived and colonized areas where natives already lived. This lead to the heavy racism that still persists today across a lot of areas with a non-native majority like Australia, New Zealand, Alaska, and so on.

Because Anglo Saxons were essentially the predecessors of the modern UK, there is less of a culture clash and (probably) less racism, but I don't actually know.

Humans across the world tend to be heavily racist and nationalistic for no reason. Counties like China, India and Mexico tend to be heavily racist towards people viewed as ""outsiders""; typically white or black people because they are the most ""different"" even though we are all still human.

 If you're the same skin color as the country you're in, even if you're from somewhere else but have vaguely similar physical features, people are typically ok with you until they learn where you are from."

Baby zombies would only be annoying, much like in minecraft. Tiny hiboxes + high speed + fast low damage attacks = annoying. We already have the vultures and dogs to deal with, having another small-ish enemy is just overkill.

Also, a smaller zombie would be harder to see when it's attacking your base and decrease visual density of the horde, making it feel more underwhelming than a huge swarm of lumberjacks and ferals.

Imo hordes of larger, more eye-catching zombies are more fun. A swarm of tiny baby zombies is just going to induce rage."

In my(and many others') opinion this is much cuter than using ""correct"" grammar because it helps convey the basic speech one might use on a human infant or an animal, which in turn creates an emotional response in most people to protect and fawn over these animals.

Moreover, human dialect evolves over time into a new vernacular that changes per generation. What used to be a doggy is now a doggo. The meanings of the words are the same but the connotation is slightly different due to the shift in language.

Believing that you're better simply because you ""read a book"", something which nearly all humans on reddit have done and regularly do, shows that you are, ironically, childish. You try to act like you're more mature but in reality your overcompensation expresses immaturity because you cannot take a simple internet joke.

If you want actual cringe, I'll call the uwutranslator bots to ""yiff"" your ass."
