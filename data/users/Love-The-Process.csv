seduction,ffb4lr3,t1_ffb3ug7,1579751648.0,"Step one: write down all of your earliest recollections of encounters with women you had romantic interest in.

Step two: write down your recollections of your relationship between the dominant women in your life starting at a young age. What was your mother like? Did you guys have a good relationship? What about your sister? Grandmother?

Step three: cross examine both for evidences of early patterns of how you interacted with women looking for negative or immature beliefs that adversely impacted those interactions or relationships.

Step four: evaluate of those negative or immature beliefs are still dominating your current interactions with women.

Step five: evaluate new ways of interacting with women that would reframe your negative beliefs into positive ones.

That’s a start. You can probably do that in about a week of deep introspection. Not going to get you there fully by a long shot but doing the above would probably have a big effect for 90% of guys. 

Continue the above for any aspect of your life that causes feelings of negativity or self hatred. Take any insight you have as a success and reward yourself for it. Doing this process on repeat for about three months will build a habit and soon you will begin doing this naturally for just about any negative feeling you come across."
dating,ffb362d,t3_eskfcz,1579750608.0,"I wanna say this in the most sensitive way possible because it can easily sound like an attack when I don't mean it to be, and I only bring this up because I had basically the exact problem as you.

&#x200B;

For a long time dates would be ridiculously boring because I knew the words to use and actions to take to get laid but it was hollow and never actually fun. Then, I started listening to self development podcasts and I realized that I was a polite narcissist. I was always obsessed with myself and that made any sort of interaction dull because I didn't give a shit about the other person.

&#x200B;

Then I just started focusing on other people. What their lives must be like, what it would be like to be in their shoes for a day. Suddenly, people got super interesting! I remember I was having lunch with a friend and for the first time I was actually very interested in his life. He's a sailor for the merchant marine and all of these questions started flooding in. What's it like waking up surrounded by water? What do you do if you think you might be getting chased by pirates? Can you get wifi on board? Do guys watch porn at see? Do you get time to play video games?

&#x200B;

It was like a super power. Suddenly, I started seeing life not just from my point of view, but other peoples points of view! It was like I could live multiple lives simultaneously by learning more and more about what other people go through day by day.

&#x200B;

So maybe try that on. Ask yourself how much you are focusing on yourself versus other people."

But, to me at least, the way Todd was framing (no pun intended) the video sounds more like ""fake it till you make it"" confidence where as I'm arguing that a better approach is to tackle the inner game portion first then discuss the best way to communicate this confidence in a socially appropriate way. A more insightful video imo would be to discuss the ways in which a guy can display his confidence in a matter that is appropriate, which is much much much easier to learn once you've tackled the inner confidence issue."

It's better with these sort of things to be direct and precise. Not that you suck, because you don't but you probably would have done a lot better by sending a shorter and more direct text. Too much waffling can come across as awkward, and apologizing for asking her out is never a good move. You can hedge, but do so in a way that's not apologetic. Next time try:

&#x200B;

""Too bad you can't make it to philosophy club, I was looking forward to seeing you there!""

B: At the same time it also does sound like you are seeking some validation through sex. This can be very confusing because you want to (deservedly) explore your sexuality but it also feels like somethings a little off. Try seeing if you can spend a couple of days you might have off just exploring your thoughts around guys. What are your earliest memories of romantic moments with guys, what was your father or father figures like to you as a child, this kind of introspection can be very powerful in helping sort through these very complicated feelings."

relationships,feo8h9q,t3_eq5iif,1579296551.0,"See if you can start to see the logic behind the emotion. We often dismiss emotions as illogical but I’ve actually found that I can form a sort of logic (even if not always rational) logic behind emotions that either I or the people I’m in relationships feel.

For instance, let’s say your wife is upset because you can’t get an erection during sex (pardon the subject matter it’s the only thing I could think of in the short time I have to write this). You would probably be upset at yourself because you’ve been taught by society that you, as a man, should be a badass player that is always ready to have sex. With that in mind, it’s actually logical for you to feel guilt or shame because guilt is a response to failing at something you should have done better and you have “failed” at being a man.

Likewise, society has taught your wife to be beautiful and sexy and that men should always want to have sex with them because men are horn dogs. If you don’t get an erection, she will be upset because she feels like she isn’t sexy enough for you and she’s a failure.

Funny enough both of these emotional responses are totally incorrect because they operate on faulty core logic (the erectile dysfunction might be due to a new medication you are taking and have absolutely nothing to do with you’re masculinity or her looks). Thus it’s really important to find the message behind the emotion. Look at it as a red flag behind some logical reason for feeling a certain way. If you’re wife is pissed at you for example, don’t view it as irrational, view it as logical within a certain framework.

The beauty of this model is that it can be used on small things as well. Let’s say she loves soccer and you hate sports. You have no way to relate to her love of soccer because from your perspective you two are too emotionally disconnected on the subject to connect about it.

But, if we view the logic behind the emotion, we find ways we actually can connect. Maybe she loves soccer because her father use to watch it with her and she remembers that daughter-father time fondly. Maybe your father and you connected over Star Trek, on it’s face a very different topic from soccer but the core “logical” reason for loving the two very different subjects are, in fact, the exact same. Maybe she just loves the competitive aspect of soccer, something that you might struggle to understand because it’s just chasing a ball around. But then again, maybe you feel very competitive about trivia games and really that’s just a game of “who can remember random shit that’s not that important”, so you can connect in the fact that she loves something that’s ultimately kinda silly just because she enjoys being competitive.

Hope that was helpful in some way :)"
socialskills,feo4z2d,t3_eq5ugg,1579295174.0,"I really hard reality I had to learn to accept was that when I felt awkward in a conversation it was because our personalities were so drastically different that we could find absolutely zero connection (very rare) or because I was being too narcissistic about myself to actually care about the other person. 

Focusing more on your image and how you’re coming across is an innocent form of narcissism where you way over emphasize your own behaviors effect on other people. The reality is that people really don’t care about what you do as long as what you’re doing isn’t actually effecting them. If you seriously fuck up at your job, people will notice and be pissed yes, but when you’re grabbing a drink and having a good time no one cares what you do. 

Instead of worrying about what you’re doing, see if you can focus on the other person for a bit. To be interesting, BE INTERESTED. If you need more help, I highly recommend reading Chris Voss’s book “Never Split The Difference” (it’s more helpful with casual convo than you would think) or watching the YouTube channel “Charisma On Command”."

Of these, only one is written by a (former) pickup artist and only two are actually dating books. 

A lot of PUA’s prey on men that assume that there is some magic shit or lines you have to use to attract women when the reality is that most guys will do fine with women if they are confident, as attractive as they can make themselves through exercise, grooming and decent fashion, understand social cues, are capable of being vulnerable, and have a positive self image and the ability to defend themselves/set boundaries. 

Why do certain guys in college fuck a lot of chicks? Is it because they were schooled in some magic PUA shit? No, they are successful because they take action, have social awareness, and are capable of speaking honestly without neediness.

Most women your age are bad at dating, you will not believe how many “hey’s” I’ve gotten on Bumble.

Your primary mission is to look as cute as you possibly can.

Your secondary mission is to show the guy you are interested in that it is acceptable for him to make moves. I’m the #metoo era the conditions by which it is acceptable for a guy to make advances are very confusing for most guys. Make it simple by spelling out your interest. SMILE at guys you think are cute. Laugh at their dumb jokes. Make eye contact with them. Lean into them when they are close. Touch their arm when In conversation. BE INTERESTED.

When in doubt, MIRROR! Give them their last comment back as a question. Example:

He says “I’ve always been a massive Pear Jam fan. I’ve got an album with Eddie Vedder’s signature on it”

You say “you’ve got an autographed album? That’s so cool! How did you get that?”

Next, I want you to focus on being vulnerable. Read Models by Mark Manson. Let people see your big ugly, beautiful faults. Be proud of yourself.

Then, I want you to focus on other people instead of focusing on how sorry you feel about yourself. Next time you’re in a conversation with anyone you’re not allowed to think about what you should say, you’re only allowed to listen and ask questions. Stop worrying about the fact you’ve never gotten laid and start worrying about other people a little bit. Not what other people will think of you, that’s probably what you’ve been doing you’re whole life. Allow yourself to experience EMPATHY. Empathy is a fucking super power and fully embracing it will change your life forever. Learn to genuinely care about other people and other people will start caring about YOU.

Don’t be super aggressive and pushy, and don’t try and make it into something where you make a move, just try and be a good friend and see if he can open up about his feelings about his parents relationship.

Guess what, LOTS of people are in this category. The fact that you have to stoop to calling her a whore, which is an incredibly ugly thing to say about a person (especially someone you’ve had a friendship with) tells me that you yourself still need to work on some maturity issues. Why should she work hard to maintain a relationship with someone that would call her a whore to everyone on the internet? That’s low key bullying and it makes sense that she would be hesitant to fully engage with you. That being said, it’s also clear that she has some issues as well, which is probably why you guys still hang out. Your mutual maturity issues makes you two, in a perverse way, a good match. Forget this girl, forget dating in general, and focus on working on yourself. If you really want to help the situation then see a therapist and talk to them about your experiences with women."

&#x200B;

Now, yes, guys are attracted to the visual and guys will always like seeing hot chicks. There are a couple of things you can do about it:

&#x200B;

A. Nothing and continue living life the way you are (which you clearly don't want since you posted this)

B. Work very very hard on your physical appearance and become obsessed with it (not recommended)

C. Acknowledge that looks are important and spend some time optimizing diet/fitness while still loving yourself for who you are and accepting that not everyone will be a beautiful model and that's okay (recommended if you want more physically attractive guys)

D. Loving yourself for who you are and accepting that not everyone will be a beautiful model and that's okay but not making a serious attempt to change your own attractiveness because you decide that it's not very important to you (recommended if you are naturally confident and attractiveness isn't a priority for you).

&#x200B;

Personally, I recommend C. Challenge yourself to improve your fitness level while also accepting your body and loving it despite its imperfections. Dump anyone that doesn't respect you (such as a boyfriend that has cheated on you) and take a break from serious relationships while you work on yourself."

&#x200B;

Seriously, next time you drop a duece in the superbowl take the three minutes you have to scroll through some insta stories and leave a little comment. Doesn't have to be anything big, if someone posts a book their reading say something like ""I've been thinking about reading that! Is it good?"" text back and forth a couple of times and leave it at that."
confidence,fdi0225,t3_elbijm,1578433301.0,"Your competency at any skill, hobby, or action is never fully static. There are certainly certain goals or objectives that are painfully unrealistic (attempting to become an NBA level Center while only being 5'6"") but that doesn't mean you can't learn about being a better center and it doesn't mean that you have to feel awful about not becoming an NBA level Center.

&#x200B;

A lack of confidence comes from a couple of different beliefs:

A: I SHOULD be at a certain skill level to be able to be confident

B: I am NOT at that skill level and I never will be

&#x200B;

Real confidence is NOT ""I am perfect at this thing."" No one is perfect at anything. Lebron ""only"" has a 50% career shot completion average and many consider him to be the greatest player ever. The greatest of all time MISSES half of the shots he takes. If he quit basketball the first time he missed a shot when he was a kid there is no way he would be the player he is now.

&#x200B;

So what's a more helpful mental model? Let's try and rewire our brain to think the following:

A: I am EXACTLY at the place I deserve to be at skillset wise.

B: I can ALWAYS learn and always grow.

&#x200B;

To again use the basketball example, real confidence is knowing that:

A: I am only 5'10"" and the average NBA center is 6'11"", therefore it is highly unlikely I will ever be an NBA level Center. Also in Junior High and High School, when many kids were attending basketball camps or spending their time playing pickup ball, I was playing video games with my friends therefore those kids that are actually better than me are legitimately deserving of being better than me and that is okay.

B: If I go out there and play badly there is always something to learn and some way in which I can be a better player from when I went out there and failed. Even if I get horribly run off the court I gained something valuable, which is more experience and an increase in knowledge.

&#x200B;

Ya, the guys that's 7 foot tall and great at basketball will have more exterior confidence than you, because there is always a reduction in confidence when you want to be good at something but other people are far better than you. BUT, the deep sense of confidence you will gain from adopting the two beliefs I detailed above will provide a sense of confidence that cannot be tarnished. Even if everything goes to shit, in the deepest part of your mind you know everything will be okay. You will actually look forward to the times where you are NOT confident because that means you get to learn something new and level up your skills!"
