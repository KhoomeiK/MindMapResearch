I thought it was an accident, until I looked up and saw a guy I had noticed earlier in the store motioning to me and he said ""come here."" I never told anyone, but I did find my mom and stayed close to her. I noticed him again later. Then I saw someone who worked in the store putting back something I had seen the man with earlier. Later, I heard my mom telling someone he got kicked out of the store for trying to snatch a kid.

When I was 13, I missed the school bus home. My mom refused to pick me up because it had happened before (I swear the bus driver was doing it on purpose), and told me that she was going to call the cops and have them take me to juvenile hall (in FL, at the time, parents could have their kids locked up), so I decided to try walking home.
