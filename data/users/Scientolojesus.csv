LifeProTips,ffblejq,t1_ffbirr7,1579771032.0,"Hell yeah. I think The Place Beyond the Pines is an underrated movie. Once again, great acting from the entire cast. And Lars and the Real Girl was the first movie I saw that showed how legit of an actor Ryan Gosling could be. He was actually really good in Half Nelson, in which he played a crackhead teacher haha. It came out a year before Lars and the Real Girl, but I didn't see Half Nelson until a couple years ago."
funny,ffbb9i8,t1_ffba52e,1579758299.0,"Haha word! I love a good DVD commentary. Especially ones that have either the main actors, the writer, or the director explain awesome details that we would never know if not for the commentary. Tropic Thunder is one that comes to mind as having a really awesome commentary, with RDJ still being in character during it, as he stated in the movie, ""I don't break character until the DVD commentary!"" haha.

Can't Hardly Wait is another such DVD commentary that has both the writers/directors (a guy and girl who did both writing and directing) and Seth Green commentate, and Seth pretends to have a British accent for the first 15 minutes or so of the commentary haha."

But Alan Tudyk is awesome in everything he does, much like Steve Zahn. They're both underrated actors who can play diverse roles when given a chance."

funny,ffb8ecw,t1_ffb5bes,1579754883.0,"You shouldn't even feel guilty because it's a legitimately good movie. And it's started to get its due over the past few years, especially after Heath Ledger's death. I saw it in theaters in the 8th grade because nothing else was showing that looked that good, and my friends and I were pleasantly surprised with how good it was. The acting is awesome and the jousting scenes are really legit and well-staged/shot. Also, many critics disliked the anachronistic music in the movie, but I thought it gave it a unique flare."
LifeProTips,ffb7zl7,t1_ff9qw4i,1579754476.0,"No problem! I'm a movie enthusiast so I love when I can recommend a movie and people actually take my recommendations seriously.

She never seemed distressed, although it's not like we would know for sure. And we let her chill inside during the summer months anyway. She lived to be 16, but I really hope she wasn't suffering because she was shaved. She was an amazing dog, really smart and really sweet. She would smile if anyone was smiling at her haha.
