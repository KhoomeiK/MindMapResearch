AnimalsBeingDerps,fezdnoh,t1_fewveyu,1579456254.0,"I agree.  Taking a cat outside on a leash(or not if they are responsible cats that don't wander) can be very important to it's health depending on the cat, I can't agree with just letting them out into the wild though.  I feel it is the same as dogs.  If your dog were to constantly run away, you still let it outside, you just put it on a leash."

insaneparents,feyxsc4,t1_feywzna,1579451750.0,"Hey, person who lives in a gated community here!  I am one of 3 white people in a community of 27. If I were racist I would see a lot less people of color by just moving deeper into the city. You are making assumptions about a lot of things that simply aren't true 100% of the time.  You can't just say you live in a way in which I see racist people live so you must be racist."

And every dollar donated to a 5(3? I don't remember)01 charity counts as 0.9 dollars of tax, so companies are encouraged to donate so that they get tax deductions and advertisements from donating huge amounts.  Lots of problems with it, like it kinda punishes people for being rich, which isn't really fair, and it isn't that developed, but I could see something kinda like that making the world a better place."
