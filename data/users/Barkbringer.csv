I mean it sounds like you're doing tons of good stuff but to me it sounds like it just hasn't been long enough for it all to sink in.

And the common advice of him being crated nearby was worse for us, but crating him in a quiet room with a cover helped.  I slept near him in the beginning too but it was better when I went back to sleeping in the bedroom (I'm a night owl too).  


You still have a lot of house training, chewing phases, and adolescence ahead of  you and the crate is the safest place for him to be right now.  YouTube has crate games you can play and I swear that helped my guy the most, maybe that will help yours too!  Crate training is a huge life skill that will affect their traveling, grooming, and vet stays their whole life.  It's totally okay if it takes a while to learn.

That's ok, there's no reason to use them.

>All my other puppies learned in a week or less but I’ve had this pup for a month now and I’m really struggling with teaching him.

Then you had magic puppies and sadly your luck has run out!  Seriously, everyone learns at different paces.  You are asking way too much of a four month old puppy.

>later on in the day he’ll go in the same area he’s wasn’t supposed to

You need to supervise him so he can't make poor choices while you build good habits instead.  Either crate train or tether the dog to you so that they are encouraged to hold it or you can keep the dog from relieving himself inside.

>My house is fully carpeted and I’ve been washing it every weekend because the house just smells like urine.

You need to use an enzymatic cleaner to break down the urine and feces so he can't smell it anymore.  Otherwise your whole house will smell like a bathroom to him.  Even if you can't smell it, he can if you aren't using the right cleaning products.  You may also want to try to use a black light to find marking spots that may be higher than the carpet you are smelling.

>I’m constantly taking him out (10-15 minutes) and yet it doesn’t seem to do anything.

But it is!  He is learning be repetition and you are showing him what to do.  Eventually it will be habitual if you control the environment enough to where he stops considering going inside to be an option.  Taking him out so often also should help you stay ahead of accidents when combined with supervision. It already sounds like he's doing really good for his age going to the door based on your command!  He's still kind of a baby, it will take a while before he knows to ask, right now he is looking to you to lead."
puppy101,fdulzeq,t1_fdthufd,1578735059.0,There's a lot of training videos on YouTube that should help.
puppy101,fdultn1,t1_fdr1awx,1578734979.0,Someone advised me to walk a bit to get things moving and then picking somewhere boring and standing there.  After some sniffing and standing around it happened.  Maybe that's something to try too.
puppy101,fdulmos,t1_fdrmn88,1578734879.0,"That's a good question, I don't have an answer for that myself.  My puppy stopped whining in his crate closer to five months old, and was less frustrated with baby gates and pens a while after that.  I would guess somewhere near adolescence if they aren't taking to the training?  Every dog is different though."
puppy101,fdqqiij,t3_emspie,1578672715.0,"The good new is that puppies don't have separation anxiety like adult dogs do.  But they are babies and they cry when they're alone.  It's great that you want to stay strong so she can learn to stay strong too.  


Have you looked at the wiki here?  The [crate training](https://www.reddit.com/r/puppy101/wiki/cratetraining) may help.  Even if you are not using a crate, the separation and crying is the same."
puppy101,fdqn5ep,t1_fdqmxsb,1578670604.0,NP!  You're already doing great by planning in advance. :)
puppy101,fdqm901,t3_emsegy,1578670018.0," [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/puppy101/comments/ac8885/our_two_week_holiday_road_trip_was_a_success/) is the write up I did of taking my puppy for a two week road trip.  Not quite the same thing, and he was a little older, but some of the prep is probably similar, and things like keeping to his schedule when you are on the road."
puppy101,fdqk6gs,t1_fdqisqf,1578668647.0,"Everything I read says they are balanced trainers and you really should go to someone who uses positive reinforcement.  You want to train the dog to *want* to offer desirable behaviors for you, not fear that it will be painful or uncomfortable if they don't."

Dogtraining,fdqf95q,t1_fdqer2m,1578665157.0,"Crate training is much more than that.  There are lots of good videos of crate games on YouTube you can play, and you do things like feed meals in there, only give chews in there, and generally make it an awesome place to be so they think it's a great place to hang out.  It takes time.    


Maybe a dog walker or friend coming by when your shifts overlap could help too."
puppy101,fdqf05b,t1_fdqead5,1578664963.0,"Ok, I looked them up and they do use shock collars so there is no way I would send my dog there."
puppy101,fdqead5,t3_emqptt,1578664409.0,"I haven't, but I've never read anything good about board and trains.  Quite the opposite actually and I would never send my dog to one.  If it were me I would invest the money in home visits and specifically ask to work on training impulse control.  Even if you send her away you will have to continue the training when she gets back, and those places often use adverse training methods that could just harm your relationship with your dog or worse.  Ideally you want your dog to listen to *you* so your training them would be best.  


Edited to add: The money spent on a trainer to work with you is money better spent because you can use what you learn on other dogs in the future too."
puppy101,fdqdqwf,t3_emp4oh,1578663980.0,"My puppy needed overnight bathroom breaks until he was around 18 weeks old.  It's normal, and at least she's doing well with her crate training enough to tell you and settle after she can relieve herself.  But she'll grow out of it and it's good you take her out if she needs.  Eventually it won't be an issue."
puppy101,fdqdlkr,t3_emng1f,1578663861.0,"My puppy did this but I knew we would be traveling with him so I started taking advantage of that first morning bathroom break and taking him anywhere else I could to get him to go.  Can you take her on a long walk in the morning and wait it out?  Give her the best treat of her life when she does go!  She's still very young, and learning what to do, but in time it should be ok."
Dogtraining,fdqd5hk,t1_fdq48x3,1578663495.0,"It makes a HUGE difference for my dog and getting groomed!  He's very good now, but when he was a puppy he thought he was dying.  Taking him for a good brisk walk, playing some tug, and letting him work out a lot of energy first was super helpful."
Dogtraining,fdqcsfo,t3_empynx,1578663198.0,"They only get four bathroom breaks a day and freeroam in the house while you're gone?  It sounds like you need to start over, puppy proof an area or crate train, and give them every opportunity to get in the habit of going outside.  Going out four times, especially when training, is not anywhere near enough."
puppy101,fdqccti,t3_emq9xs,1578662834.0,"I feel you.  I slept next to the crate for a long time, and then nearby and my puppy still cried.  What helped was MORE work with the crate.  Look up crate game on YouTube to make it a fun, trained experience when he doesn't have to be in there.  We did this every day, along with treats/chews, and meals in the crate.  Even if it was for an activity where he didn't need to stay in, all of that made it a better place for him to be."
puppy101,fdpq8lp,t3_emlofe,1578636400.0,"It's ok, they all find their voice eventually.  You can work on adding a queue to ""speak"" and then create a queue for quiet.  I also find that if my dog is alerting me of something, a ""leave it"" and a distraction works really well for him."
puppy101,fdpprdg,t3_emhl3b,1578635916.0,"The only puzzle that has been too big or heavy for my Yorkie was the small Kong Wobbler.  Pretty much everything else works just fine.  Kong Genius pieces, spinners, slide puzzles, snuffle mats, they are all good.  Even putting kibble in a muffin tin and covering each cup with a ball for them to move is fun."
Yorkies,fdppmjt,t3_em9hnx,1578635783.0,I do lol.
