If you don't already; add exercise to the mix. You'll have forgotten about drinking in no time.

Good luck!"

kratom,feo355r,t1_fen00ob,1579294530.0,"This is so interesting to me how subjective every drug is - I had a lot of nausea when I was younger, it started to fade when I progressed into adulthood but never truly went away.

Since I've started kratom I've had little to no stomach issues. I'd say it actually increased my appetite, which is good cause I'm a skinny dude. 

In turn, my increased appetite has led to some weight gain which has prompted me to start swimming several times a week.

Kratom has done a lot for me."
kratom,feo2sqi,t3_eq3r8u,1579294338.0,"No.

I struggle with being sober, my body and brain harmonize very well with lots of different substances.

With kratom I'm able to do a little if I feel I really need to not be sober and it helps me avoid more risky substances."
