portugal,fdjhq0b,t1_fdi20h9,1578471327.0,Já estive em Istambul e posso afirmar que sem dúvida tem o seu lado europeu a nível cultural e forma de estar (literalmente também visto que uma parte se encontra geográficamente em território europeu). Aconselho a visitarem.

personalfinance,fcfy1nl,t1_fcfmhqy,1577634748.0,I never said I wouldn't tip if I went over there. It's not my country so I'd play by the country's rules. I'm talking about my country only. It's ridiculous to me to tip in my country.
personalfinance,fcfxfpb,t1_fcex8b3,1577634633.0,I understand it might be weird for you guys as well but yea we don't tip.
personalfinance,fcesnn9,t3_eh45af,1577623410.0,There's no such thing in my country. People have a salary already so it's not customary for us to tip anything since they're already getting paid for the job they're doing. It's just ridiculous to me to even think about tipping.

AskReddit,fc6x92q,t3_egbmco,1577491849.0,Went to turkey (Istanbul) and something that stuck with me was how the water is full of jellyfish I looked at it every time we were getting on a ferry to cross to one of sides. if you happen to fall in the water you're so screwed.
