It is an angry symbol. It's a symbol of revolution, used by those that are fed up. Revolutions, in the political ""new group of people takes over the power"" are normally messy and a lot of times violent, and normally take place when a group of people is angry about their situation.

Historically, it was first used by the French marxist violent revolts against Napoleon III. It was a call to fight (violently) against the doctator's opression. It was similarly used in the Spanish civil war by the Communists. In other words, it was used by people whose ideology was all about anger against oppression, fighting, and resistance. 

Biologically, the only moments where you cench your fists in such. A way is when you are going to punch something/someone, or when you clinch your fists in anger. 

Symbolically, it is used normally by groups of people that are calling people to fight, even if that fight is non violent. It's a way of raising peoples morale, normally against injustice (or in some cases, against perceived but not real injustice, as when used by white supremacists).


Saying that is an angry symbol is nothing bad, per se. There are sometimes moments when being angry and fighting are perfectly justified."

freefolk,fdolq27,t1_fdntx4f,1578607698.0,"So, the y are trying to argue against the Nordic model using as an example the country that does not actually really apply the Nordic model? In finland, it is only illegal to solicit prostitution from prostitutes working under a pimp. Basically, the clients are only prosecuted if they use the services of an enslaved prostitute. But, in practice, proving that the client knew if she was doing it voluntarily or not is very difficult, and in the law is not enforced.


However, the actual Nordic system (Sweden, for example) has gotten the number of males that have used prostitution from something like 11% to a bit over 5% (for reference, in the USA similar statistics give a 20%) with only less of 1% having done it in the last year.


The ""it always existed, and it will always exist, so lets just legalize it"" is a double lie. First, contract killing has always existed. Thieving has always existed. Blackmail has always existed. They probably will always will, to some extent. But no one tries to use that as a justification to legalize those behaviours.

Similarly, it is also a lie that prostitution will always exist. With adequate laws, social protection, education, etc. It will disappear, or at least it will be reduced until it's practice stops being relevant. Slavery used to be the basic economic motor of full societies to the point were having slaves was supposed to be a necessity for a society to be successful. However, at one point, we decided that slavery was not admissible, and we have been able to make it disappear, at least in the western world. In fact, the only cases of slavery in the western world are seen in relation to prostitutes. 

Plus, is not true that legalization makes the job easier. It just makes the job easier for mafias and mobs. Legalization just makes it easier for them to conceal their illegal acts.

Legalization does not make the job safer for prostitutes. Compare the murder statistics of prostitutes in Germany or the Netherlands (legalized) with sweden's."

The differences in the result are extremely noticeable: not only is the final product much more delicious, the differences are so deep that it applies even to the nutritional values. Good iberic ham, for example, is rich in good fats and low in bad ones, making it a very healthy alternative for someone with cardiac problems. However, a bad ham does not have any of those advantages.

Therefore, hams in Spain have very strict rules regarding its labelling, in order to avoid people selling fake iberic ham. And that is not protectionism at all: real free market requires customers to be properly informed to make rational decisions.

He tries the pie, chokes once, drinks the wine to shallow the pie, chokes massively. It could be either.



>Once again: that was never said here. There is a hell of a diference between ""Bedding"" and ""Fucking'.

Even if that is the case, the poisoner assuming that Joffrey will eat pie during the bedding is much more of an assumption than assuming that he will eat such pie while he drinks the wine, *as in fact happens* thus making it look like an accident."
asoiaf,fcvng2m,t1_fcvjooa,1578005877.0,"I would say the facts I listed are as close to facts as we can get in a GRR Martin novel. All of them is info provided by the books:


- That joffrey was killed by the strangler poison. *We are told that the symptons match, and we can confirm this when stannous maester tried to kill melissandre*.
- That such poison is extremely rare *Again, we are told that only three groups of people can brew it*.
- that it is a liquid poison that can be made solid by mixing it with ash, which makes it crystalize. *Again, not a conjecture*
- that the poison is meant to be dissolved in liquids, such as wine. This makes sense: a crystal would feel very unnatural in the mouth for the victim. *Pretty sure this is also told. Not sure. But they do describe dissolving it in wine as the normal way of using it, and is how it is used that other time*. Plus it makes sense: crystals would have to be dissolved, plus a purple coloured liquid would be noticeable if used in water, for example, as it would tint it 
- That Sansa was carrying said poison crystals in the amathyst she was wearing in her hair. *Again, not a conjecture*
- That someone with valid motive for killing joffrey (Olenna) touched Sansa's hair. *Same*. That he touched the silver net with the amethysts is a fact. And we know she was trying to kill Joffrey. Not even OP discusses that.
- Olenna also had opportunity to use said poison. *She was in the same table, and we are told by Balon that it was impossible to keep track of what everyone was doing*.
- That one of those amethysts is missing after Joffrey's death. *Again, fact*"

asoiaf,fcvi60i,t3_eizqx5,1578002598.0,"This seems.. farfetched at best.

Poisons are not something that can be used in any manner. What works dissolved in wine, may not work after being cooked at high temperatures.

What we know as facts:

- That joffrey was killed by the strangler poison.
- That such poison is extremely rare.
- that it is a liquid poison that can be made solid by mixing it with ash, which makes it crystalize.
- that the poison is meant to be dissolved in liquids, such as wine. This makes sense: a crystal would feel very unnatural in the mouth for the victim.
- That Sansa was carrying said poison crystals in the amathyst she was wearing in her hair.
- That someone with valid motive for killing joffrey (Olenna) touched Sansa's hair. 
- Olenna also had opportunity to use said poison.
- That one of those amethysts is missing after Joffrey's death.


With all this facts, is pretty obvious that Joffrey was killed by Olenna, who dropped the amathyst in his wine when everyone was distracted.  She had access to the murder weapon, motive, and opportunity. 

There is nothing that contradicts this, except the words of a fool, of which may, very remotely, imply that Joffrey was supposed to die at his bedding. But this is not a hint about the moment in which Joffrey is supposed to die. In the contrary, it confirms that Olenna and LF were the actual murderers. In that regard, please note that those words were said to sansa **before the murder takes place**, while Dontos tells her a plan that is, in Sansa's mind, supposedly only a escape plan. He tells her that they will escape **during the confusion**. He needs Sansa to know that in order for her to react when the time comes, but, for obvious reasons, can't tell her the real cause of that confusion (the poisoning). So he uses the most plausible explanation, the bedding. But this is simply confirming that Dontos knew that a chance to escape would happen during the wedding due to Joffrey's death.

In fact, it would contradict the second conversation he has with Sansa after the deed is done, where he tells her that he simply  choked with the pie: obviously, normally no one chokes with pie while fucking. It might happen, but a poisoner would never try to poison someone with food/wine at such moment.

So, it is obvious that Joffrey was, in fact, killed by Olenna.

Is there a second poisoning going on? Maybe. The ""tywin was poisoned with blood widow"" theory makes a lot of sense. But I don't think anyone was trying to poison Tyrion specifically."

I would say term is better when it comes to details and weaving the story. Erikson is better when it comes to conveying emotions and epicness."
asoiaf,fctmqdm,t3_eiq7wk,1577949239.0,"The main 13 books in the Malazan series are the only ones that imho, can compare. Although the style of writing is not for everyone. 


The first law trilogy is superb, although depressing in a bad way."
