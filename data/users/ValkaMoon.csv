furby,fdek42w,t3_ekzbz2,1578340719.0, Some context: I bought film for the camera that I got for Christmas and after several photos it seemed like the entire lot of film was ruined due to the shop storing it incorrectly. I started to take joke photos since the film was ruined. The one and only photo that wasn’t on destroyed film was of my Furby so now I have this extremely wack photo of my Furby.

Normally I'm an advocate for plastic tubs as you get a large space for cheaper, but in this case I don't think it is worth it."
Goldfish,fdehgqi,t3_ejseiw,1578339110.0,I personally started with a 100 gallon tank and I want to upgrade even more for my 5 fish to have more room.
Goldfish,fdehds8,t3_eiwqbp,1578339060.0,I personally have had luck growing Val with goldfish in my tank. It really does depend on your fish though. I know of some goldfish that won't even touch duckweed.
Goldfish,fdegse9,t1_fd75cuh,1578338694.0,"Also if you're short on money, the storage tubs from cheap stores like the Reject Shop are safe. We use them at my fish rescue and have had no issues."
Goldfish,fdegcj2,t1_fdc0apc,1578338424.0,"I just want to add to this. You also really shouldn't be buying feeders as pets imo. Feeders are bred for quantity, not quality, and have health issues far more often. If you want comets or shubunkins, bred for pets from a reputable breeder.   


Also 55 gallons is NOT big enough for 2 single tail goldfish. You could house 3-4 fancies in there but comets need a lot more space."
Goldfish,fdeg0rr,t1_fdc72se,1578338223.0,In all the pet stores I've been to (and one I've worked at previously) there has never been a limit on how few or how many someone can buy. This strikes me as odd.
Goldfish,fdefvht,t3_ekm919,1578338131.0,It's hard to see his fins properly in that photo but I would put him in a separate tank. Since there's nothing to have torn his fins it sounds like it could be an infection or illness. If he's unwell it could also be the other fish nipping his fins.
Goldfish,fdefnam,t3_ekmo9i,1578337989.0,"Just from a picture it's hard to tell what it is. It could be plants or waste stuck there. I've never seen slime coats being stuck to the filter, personally."
Goldfish,fdefi3z,t3_ekqpj4,1578337898.0,Nearly all goldfish with black on them will eventually have the black change to orange tones. Younger goldfish are also bronze in colour and will develop their adult colours. So from what I can tell your goldfish were just very young and are now developing their colours.
Goldfish,fdefaj3,t3_eky91u,1578337766.0,Marine salt is fine for helping sick goldfish (as well as any other fish who are salt tolerant). Just make sure to dose correctly as you would with any other salt.

dogswithjobs,fdaznfp,t3_eke88w,1578252103.0,"To those asking, without going into details about my health problems, he will be trained for public access & basic obedience ( this goes without saying though ), as well as being trained to alert to a medical issue and respond accordingly, some guidance tasks when needed, and to respond to some psychiatric issues."
dogswithjobs,fdaiq0c,t1_fdac42b,1578246529.0,"He's a border collie x blue heeler. It's a mix I enjoy working with for service dogs. They are intelligent and their energy lets them keep up with you on a busy day, and on slow days they're great fun to go to the park. They are also, from what I've found in the past, very clingy to one person. Not social anxiety or separation issues ""clingy"", but preferring to be around their one person when possible.

shittyaquariums,fcyf08k,t1_fcye3lq,1578079063.0,I'm new to the betta keeping hobby so I do apologize if my statement was wrong but among keepers in the hobby I regularly see 10 gallons suggested as a minimum for best quality of life.
shittyaquariums,fcyek5o,t1_fcyeau1,1578078961.0,"I'm expecting the same but I released that if I don't speak up, nothing will happen. Hopefully it's resolved."
shittyaquariums,fcyckbq,t1_fcxn307,1578078046.0,A betta fish really needs 10 gallon as a minimum. I wouldn't suggest any less than that.
shittyaquariums,fcycc1j,t3_ejh7ld,1578077958.0,"If she's willing to get the proper care for these fish it would be great. Ideally for 2 comets you'll want 75-100 gallon tank with a filter. I like using a sponge filter as it also adds lots of air, which really benefits goldfish.  


If she doesn't want to upgrade but realizes that this care is improper, I can suggest seeing if any local pet stores or rescues will take them."
Goldfish,fcyb015,t3_ejjje6,1578077419.0,"Why are goldfish, who require cold water, in with tropical that have completely different care requirements?  


The goldfish, if they live, will become extremely stressed. They will also end up eating a lot of those smaller fish I can see there. Goldfish need cold water. Even at the warmest point their tank should be, it would still be colder than the coldest recommended point for angelfish.   


Please, get them out of there and into their own tank."
Goldfish,fcy9kos,t1_fcxrode,1578076697.0,"Just adding onto this.  


One of the best (imo) enrichment items for goldfish is having sand substrate. It allows them to perform their natural sifting behavior and is mentally stimulating."

shittyaquariums,fcxewn9,t3_ejc5lv,1578061120.0,"Yikes.  


I never understood those kritter keepers. I keep invertebrates as well as fish and any invert that is small enough (with good husbandry) to be housed in something that size, can escape through the air holes. They are so bad for anything except as decor."

The ice thing is fine for my goldies because I have a bunch stored in the freezer and cycled through it. It doesn’t decrease the temperature more than a few degrees over a few hours but it helps. Without it the tank would be over 30c in this weather and you want to keep them about 20c, 23c for fast growth. The tank is also so large that it’s very slow and not distressing for them to have that small change. Where as if I put it in the betta tank the entire tank would almost be ice water and that’s a big yikes."

He referred me to a psych that was even further away (also the only bulk billing option). I saw them for some time but to keep it up is just not feasible realistically, especially paying to get there (still cheaper than paying for a doctor). On the weeks I was going I had to not buy food because of how little money I have.

Also 55 gallons is NOT big enough for 2 single tail goldfish. You could house 3-4 fancies in there but comets need a lot more space."

Goldfish,fdefvht,t3_ekm919,1578338131.0,It's hard to see his fins properly in that photo but I would put him in a separate tank. Since there's nothing to have torn his fins it sounds like it could be an infection or illness. If he's unwell it could also be the other fish nipping his fins.
Goldfish,fdefnam,t3_ekmo9i,1578337989.0,"Just from a picture it's hard to tell what it is. It could be plants or waste stuck there. I've never seen slime coats being stuck to the filter, personally."

Goldfish,fdefaj3,t3_eky91u,1578337766.0,Marine salt is fine for helping sick goldfish (as well as any other fish who are salt tolerant). Just make sure to dose correctly as you would with any other salt.

They are intelligent and their energy lets them keep up with you on a busy day, and on slow days they're great fun to go to the park. They are also, from what I've found in the past, very clingy to one person. Not social anxiety or separation issues ""clingy"", but preferring to be around their one person when possible.

shittyaquariums,fcycc1j,t3_ejh7ld,1578077958.0,"If she's willing to get the proper care for these fish it would be great. Ideally for 2 comets you'll want 75-100 gallon tank with a filter. I like using a sponge filter as it also adds lots of air, which really benefits goldfish.  


If she doesn't want to upgrade but realizes that this care is improper, I can suggest seeing if any local pet stores or rescues will take them."
Goldfish,fcyb015,t3_ejjje6,1578077419.0,"Why are goldfish, who require cold water, in with tropical that have completely different care requirements?  


The goldfish, if they live, will become extremely stressed. They will also end up eating a lot of those smaller fish I can see there. Goldfish need cold water. Even at the warmest point their tank should be, it would still be colder than the coldest recommended point for angelfish.

The ice thing is fine for my goldies because I have a bunch stored in the freezer and cycled through it. It doesnâ€™t decrease the temperature more than a few degrees over a few hours but it helps. Without it the tank would be over 30c in this weather and you want to keep them about 20c, 23c for fast growth. The tank is also so large that itâ€™s very slow and not distressing for them to have that small change. Where as if I put it in the betta tank the entire tank would almost be ice water and thatâ€™s a big yikes."
