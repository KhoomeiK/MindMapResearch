I have very few legit friends, but i know if you put effort into those relationships sometimes you wont always see it returned evenly but generally you will.  Then sometimes you realize its time to find better friends as well.

Maybe your dad is just too in his own world to notice things as he gets older and maybe there are things on his mind.  Keep trying to do good things for him.  

I still live at home with my mom but thats because im back in school so im just waiting for that degree before i can actually start enjoying life.  If i wasnt doing that and was younger, i would be looking into the trade schools, so maybe that might interest you.

Dont worry too much about the negative things, enjoy your bday, and if its quiet i like to turn music on and maybe play games, and have some beers and bbq some steak or good food if im not expecting calls on or doing anything on my bday. Treat yourself!"

Just because some people in this country want to vote for someone that talks and thinks like them like talking shit and alienating allies doesnt mean its a good thing.

Its not like im saying you cant practice your religion anymore but when its time to make changes then its time.  Besides the gay marriage thing, i care the most about issues where beliefs are withholding medical care, causing physical and mental abuse, etc.

Honestly as someones whoes gone to catholic private school for like 12 years, i dont have the patience anymore to even waste on a debate like this.  People who do things like this because of their ""beliefs"" are wrong and need to atleast update their religion.  This goes for people in other countries too where basically oppression is still a thing because of their religion.  Some things are just obviously and blatantly wrong despite their beliefs and its wrong to hide behind ""freedom"" to protect themselves and their misguided beliefs.

I dont blindly follow either political party, I hold them both accountable and it's hilarious you dont think trump is an elitist when you brought up how much money he makes as a qualifications.  I'll also tell you this, oprah makes alot of money and has alot of Twitter followers but I would never want her ass to be president either.  How about someone who already has the experience in working in government, and I'm saying Democrat or REPUBLICAN so no I'm not someone that hates democracy and prefer elitist controlling society.  What a weak ass accusation just because I'm pointing out things you dont want to hear because you support trump.

Listen internet stranger, despite all the other bullshit all I'm saying is people can do better in selecting whoes right for the job, trump isnt but you had a chance to pick others who are from your own party.  Do better, ""be best"" and I'll leave it at that."
inthenews,fdcq3pg,t1_fdcn9yp,1578281216.0,"The Bush and Obama administration both considered taking out general queso salami but had the sense to weigh the risk of if the potential retaliation would be worth it or not.  Personally I could give a fuck about the guy being assassinated, but yea theres a reason why its important to have someone qualified to understand whether the risks outweigh the benefits.  So with Bush as an example, I'm willing to bet Reagan, or any other sensible QUALIFIED Republican president wouldn't have taken this risk. Are you kidding me? Qualifications have everything to do with making these kinds of decisions any sensible person will tell you that especially those who work in government and military.  Yes ""so called allies"" are important to have support, as well as understand the problem if we dont have it.  Any one who makes military decisions or has common sense will tell you that.  If you dont understand that, than you shouldnt be president

Yea he did win, but that's because a good amount of people really fucked up in not understanding how much of a mistake it is to think this is the guy for the job, or didnt want to vote, or think Hillary would just automatically win, etc. Yea I get alot of people will stick to either of these two bullshit parties no matter what. But that's why it may do more people good to get educated about the things going on in the world so they understand how important qualifications are when making decisions having to do with assassinating other countries high profile generals and the ensuing backlash that could follow.  Lol Twitter followers or how much money you make are not qualifications for foreign affairs if anything.  You have to be joking trying to bring that up.  But like I said that's part of the problem with voters, they're not taking into account of how important qualifications are, they only care about hearing what they want to hear, personally I care more about substance and qualifications which is what every American should give a fuck about especially for these kinds of situations.

Again, you want to stick to the Republican party? Fine, but atleast pick someone better than this moron."

Just because you enjoy watching this idiot be a douche and act like a fucking idiot towards other leaders of our allied countries doesnt mean there isnt going to be consequences like in an event where we would want their support instead of alienating them like what this fucking idiot has done.  Believe it or not yea it's important to vote for someone who knows what the fuck they're doing when it comes to geopolitics and foreign affairs even if they seem dull and boring and doesnt talk, act, and tweet like the average person.

offmychest,fd0j0hm,t1_fd05v3k,1578119505.0,"Violence will escalate, but not to the point of a full scale war where they would attack and try to invade the US.  Like you said this is not the 30s and 40s where conventional warfare would happen so easily.   Russias economy is weak enough where a war would destabilize them economically.  China wouldn't want to stop making money either through a war over iran.  If anything, there will be more terrorist type attacks, and cyber attacks.  Iran knows  a full scale war with the US would be the end of their  regime.  

I understand people worrying about this because it is a significant event, but there will not be WW3 over  Iran.  The world is too interconnected economically for any country like china or russia to risk a full scale war especially with the US; a super power that invests more in military than the next top 9 countries or something like that, with a heavily armed civilian population.

Conventional warfare is not what we should worry about, but isolated terrorist attacks and cyber attacks is what we have to worry about constantly now."

offmychest,fd0b43g,t1_fczufoj,1578116308.0,"I get sick of the America bashing too, but the thing with this is it was a high profile person that was assassinated.  The Bush and Obama administrations  apparently considered taking him out too, but they decided it was too much of a risk because of the potential backlash and retaliation that could happen.  So despite all the other shit that I'm sorry trump brings onto himself, this was a risky decision that we might not have much support from any allies besides israel.  Speaking of which, personally one of my biggest issues with trump is how he alienates us from our long time allies, so when something does happen we could then lose their potential support when something like this happens.  Trump supporters cant deny that, that he is alienating us from our allies, and I feel is really fucking stupid and irresponsible if we want support as a country during  any conflicts.  This is what I always worried about mainly with this guy becoming president and dealing with geopolitics, and foreign affairs.  Noone would be bashing another Republican as much if it was someone else that was actually qualified to deal with things like this."
