relationship_advice,ffvowjl,t3_ev66yp,1580269279.0,"I have two women in my family who have either have been, or currently are, in a relationship similar to yours in this regards: 1) You worry more about him after you've left him even though you already know it's the right answer. 2) You're in denial and you think it's going to get better if you just give him more time or more chances to improve.

IMO, you need to leave him. Go from being BF/GF, to friends, to acquaintances, to strangers, and drop him out of your life completely. Because, like a boomerang, if he comes back into your life for any duration of time then he will mess up your future even more.

MOST importantly, for your sake please don't rush into another relationship after your current BF after you break up with him. It is very important for your sense of maturity to learn to live the single life. Perhaps after a year or more you'll know you're ready to get back into another relationship. Please give yourself the time you need.

Get a new roommate and find a family or close friend to be there when you tell him you've reached the end of that relationship. This way he'll know that this time he can't talk his way out of it.

I'm a guy, (32M), and I've never done anything your BF has done, but when a guy becomes as complacent as that it's time to let him go. It's not your fault "" He doesn't know how to do things on his own."" Whatever he does after the breakup is his responsibility and his worry. When you leave I recommend not telling him your new address, changing your key passwords (if he knows them), and otherwise protecting yourself. Because if he's ""addicted"" to the lifestyle you have enabled him to have then he may not let it go easily. However since I don't know the guy you should use your best judgement."
