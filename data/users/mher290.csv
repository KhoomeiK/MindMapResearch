But in serious notes , you just need to make an intresting storyline and animate it (but the best thing is you can come UP with a story that you personally like while considering other peopleâ€™s likings) Much like minecraft animation series from various YouTubers like Black plasma. The Main thing is creativity. Minecraft fits very well in any kinds of a TV series. But it would be perfect for something like horror ones. But it really fits in most genres., but it could be very cringy at Times."
