yep. There is more stuff if you google it, but reading about that shit is awful. Should of save the links to be honest. I realy do not like the idea of re reading it. 

>>You yourself has listed personal preference and taste as a criteria for judging the quality and health of pet food, which is an absurd standard and like I said points to you severely anthropomorphizing pets.

 Dogs are meat eaters, we are meat eaters, yet I do not just refer to what I think is tasty, to that as I have said, I agree, this is why I bother to read and research what they need to eat. 
 I do not randomly feed them from the table, Least not anymore, and if I do, I portion out my food to make sure there is enuff, so once I eat my fill, they have the plate.  But I only do that, if what was made, was safe for dog, likewise I will cook them there own meals.

 You speak as if I advertise feeding them onion soup and other such random nonsense, yet all I say, is real food, is better then the mystery in a can. To your argument of taste, I cant find that taste in the wilds, unless I dug up shit, or other such nasty things like bugs. Kibble also bland and flavorless, as dogs, I understand there sensitive tongue and nose, can smell and taste the meat, yet if I gave them a real piece of stake, cooked medium rare, with a bit of spice. Then made a nice thick rice and gravy from bone stock? Feed them that and they will go nuts. They will taste more then even I can comprehend.


also making my own ground beef is evidence that I know what it is made out. Bloody hate mystery meat. I will eat it. Bet as you alluded two, whats the difference of the meat industry from the pet? I could kill off a few hound pets and the only thing that will suffer from my neglect is my prophet and business. Neglectfully kill of that many pepole, well depending on the neglect, you might see a lot of jail time."

Also as a omnivore your right, I cant know what they like, but I can watch and experience, most dogs that grow up on real food tend to be very picky on what kind of pet food they will eat. 
 Nevermind that when you bother to feed them, they would rather wait to eat to see if they get fed off the table, only choosing to eat the pet food if they do not get substantial food from the table. 

Also the point of looking at what is nutritious and good for dogs online is not to ignore to personal preference, that would defeat the purpose. 
 I barely trust our meat industry, there is always some bull shit we do not want to know going on in there, Even many cases of food poisoning and shit and lack of sanitation in some cases. That is in a well regulated environment, I doubt pet food is as well regulated as pepole food.

 on to you comment on the meat industry, the beef I by whole vs the ground beef, least with a cut of steak I can see what it is, with ground beef I could be eating anything.

In short, yah I do not know what my pet thinks is tasty, but from experience, they prefer real food over pet food."

I do not trust the capitalist to put what is best for my pet into a can, all I can trust that they do, is make sure the nutrients and shit are at the best level, yet that says little about what the put into it, the safety and sanitation, shit blue buffalo has been killing pets.

 What is love? Its affection, care and attention among other things, that is the stuff I want to be put in my food. When I sit online figuring out what my dog can not and can eat, what spices, what dose he need? That is care and attention, when I put something together that is tasty and healthy for my pet, that is effection. When I make sure the quality of the ingredients are the best I can afford to give them? that is care.
