politics,ff3moo5,t1_ff3f9uv,1579544328.0,"Concurrence/Dissent In Part

John Paul Stevens (Author)

Ruth Bader Ginsburg

Sonia Sotomayor

While Stevens agreed that the disclosure provisions of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act were constitutional, he found that the other provisions also should be upheld. At least, they should not be struck down on a facial basis. Stevens conceded that they might be invalid on a case-by-case basis, following further factual investigation. After a close reading of Buckley v. Valeo, he found that it permitted the possibility of restricting campaign spending to limit corruption, which it recognized as a valid goal. He pointed out that the majority had diverged from the vast majority of the Court's previous jurisprudence in this area, relying largely on dissenting opinions.

Stevens argued for a broader understanding of corruption than limiting it to quid pro quo exchanges like bribes or buying votes. He foresaw the possibility of special interests gaining a higher level of political access and essentially blackmailing politicians into pursuing their objectives by threatening them with advertising attacks. Stevens also noted that it was important not only to prevent corruption but to prevent the appearance of corruption for a democracy to function effectively, since people otherwise would lose confidence in the election process. (This was supported by empirical research on public opinion regarding political spending by corporations.)

Rejecting the theory that a corporation is a person, Stevens asserted that it is different in many critical respects, including having no voting ability, no individual morality or loyalty concerns, and eternal life. People who are members of corporations still can exercise their individual speech rights, and a corporation was nothing more than a collection of people to him. In fact, he argued that permitting them to exercise such a sweeping set of free speech rights infringed on the rights of their shareholders, who might not agree with what the board chose to support. He found that a derivative suit was an unwieldy, complicated way of challenging a corporation's political expenditures that might not have an effect until it was too late.

Although Stevens shared the majority's respect for the marketplace of ideas concept, he felt that the marketplace could be threatened by being saturated with a certain viewpoint. By dominating the discussion, corporations could give the impression that their viewpoints were widely supported, which would encourage people to accept them. He was not concerned that censorship would result from upholding the provisions, since they could be challenged on a case-by-case basis, and he feared that the Court had exceeded the scope of the judicial role by severely limiting the ability of the legislature to fight corruption during the election process."
