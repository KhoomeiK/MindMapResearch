Yeah children don't know better, but still, they should at least know why you shouldn't glorify this stuff. I met someone from my school who started crying when I asked ""when did you get a professional diagnosis"" after she stayed how she has ""depression, anxiety, PTSD and, bipolar disorder."" No doubt she was a gacha kid, she also stated to me that she ""cuts herself for fun"" and all that stuff trying to be edgy and all qUiRKY uWu.
