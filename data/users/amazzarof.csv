AskReddit,fgv5jcv,t3_f0hzfu,1581137759.0,"Well do I have a story about a creepy coworker. 

Is one how this person still works here but that’s besides the point. This guy I swear is a sociopath. Or he’s autistic but hasn’t been diagnosed and he’s on meds for his ADD and he’s probably high all the time. 

So just to start off the story they were charged with voyeurism and are now banned from a university because of it which I plan on going to just to avoid this person. But the uni is better anyway. When I was in my interview with the boss he took me down into the area I’ll be working and when I was leaving they said to another coworker who then that coworker told me he said: “I don’t know how our boss can talk to her without drooling over her.” 
Like thanks for insinuating my boss will sexually harass  me. They tried to get with me and the excuse I told him was that he was too old for me to which I then got a boyfriend within the same dept who’s the same age as him. And then they started playing games by which the first one was to tell hr about us and make sure we told hr that we were dating and start micromanaging us if we were ever even talking together even though I still communicate to my bf because he’s my coworker. When they would tell hr and they would get up on us for stuff and they treated it as revenge for reportó him to hr for insinuating sexual harassment in the work place. WHICH ACTUALLY HAPPENS!

They would also watch me from across the room, harass me by trying to hug me when I didn’t want to, would touch other people without them wanting to, and they would micromanage everyone and act rude and disingenuous to everyone and wonder why no one wants to be his friend. And he would harass my other female co worker too. And still doesn’t understand why no one wants to hang out with him"

funny,fgogtqk,t3_eziks1,1580969459.0,It was probably liberating for her
relationship_advice,fgobmp6,t3_ezivwn,1580964836.0,Honestly it just seems pretty selfish of you GF to make it about her issues when you and your sister just lost your parents. Like wtf! Maybe be supportive and understand that you needed to focus your energy somewhere else for a bit. You’re absolutely right you saw your GF for who she really was.
self,fg6ijb2,t1_fg6i65f,1580568913.0,I would think Karen’s would always get their kids vaccinated hahaha
self,fg6ii5r,t1_fg6i65f,1580568888.0,I will for sure. Also my mom isn’t a Karen she’s very laid back and not strict and I love her very much. Just more of the natural medicine route. I never really got into why she never vaccinated my sister and I. We’re alive though. And I think it’s because the majority of the population is vaccinated.
TwoXChromosomes,fg6gou0,t3_ewnxy6,1580567467.0,Yea I had an Uber driver ask me for my number and wanted to “get with me” because I was good at keeping a conversation
trashy,fg05q5p,t1_ffzcout,1580400802.0,It’s a theory and that’s all it is but it gets you thinking what the governments intentions are. I’m not saying I believe it but I think it’s important to keep in mind. Especially because corruption is everywhere. Also I wouldn’t compare to to the idiocy of people who think the moon landing is fake.
trashy,ffz6eca,t1_ffyuspj,1580365426.0,This is what I was saying too.
trashy,ffz6d9o,t3_evyl4e,1580365402.0,"Why do you think there hasn’t been a cure for cancer or diabetes yet? They’re multi trillion dollar businesses that seek profit in giving and keeping patients alive but not curing them. It’s complex and there’s a lot more to it than this.  It’s not a sustainable business model to cure people. But it’s the right thing to do but businesses and people who just want financial gain running these things, wouldn’t want a cure."

stopdrinking,ffuhdei,t3_ev5352,1580241982.0,This is huge. Congrats to you for sticking to it and making sobriety your bitch. Perhaps talk to your husband how you see this is unfair for you/ discuss your frustrations and how you really feel like you’ve worked hard for this and he doesn’t seem to sympathize as much as you want him to

PublicFreakout,ffjyz2b,t1_ffj177v,1580010828.0,The medical system needs to have a better way of getting those people easy fixes that they need. Because sometimes clinics are closed when you need them especially on weekends. And sometimes you just need antibiotics and you know exactly what you have but they insist you have no idea what you actually have and you just wait even though you’ve had said ear infection or sore throat before.
AlAnon,ffayset,t3_esjwww,1579747625.0,Definitely don’t keep her debit card. The responsibility has to be on her and it will turn into you enabling her and she will feel like she can’t be sober/survive without you. You need to focus on yourself and support her from a healthy perspective. Both for you and her.
awfuleverything,ffa1g73,t3_esea9r,1579725965.0,I wouldn’t condone this as awful everything. It’s clearly just his style and you’re insinuating your very closed minded opinion on fashion on this sub. Disgraceful.

HumansAreMetal,fefvdb6,t3_eosp7k,1579066413.0,There’s no way to tell if he would have hit it or not because the bat broke before it made its proper trajectory.
AlAnon,fee97s3,t3_eojzw5,1579029004.0,I had an epiphany one day after my boyfriend and I broke up and I just finally realized that his life is not my responsibility. That he’s going to do whatever he wants no matter what. And the only thing you can control is your own life and your own happiness. It felt like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders but I didn’t even know the weight was there until it was gone. Then we decided to try an open relationship and we’ve grown our trust within each other exponentially. We’re a lot happier together and we’re trying to work on not being jealous and codependent of each other. I’ve taken a step back and stopped worrying if he was drinking or not because I rather focus on the good things and let him get a grasp of his life. I can’t do it for him. You got this and you’re absolutely right!
