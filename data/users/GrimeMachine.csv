Fitness,feema1d,t1_fedxsfy,1579036626.0,"I could never take beta alanine that much before going to the gym; at best, I'd have to wait until I was driving away to start drinking it.

I'm not sure why, but the tingles of beta alanine make me feel so gross when I'm *not* actively working out (like on the drive to the gym); when I'm exercising though, it feels like I'm reaching into a bottomless pit of ""fuck yea you got this."""

todayilearned,fee8sjk,t3_eod68h,1579028754.0,"I know this sounds like an ideal temperature. However, what people don't realize is there's absolutely no air movement in there. So yea, it's 68 degrees F, but when it's 100+ outside and you go into the tombs, the stale, stagnant air isn't much better.

I'll say that I actually felt so much better when I *left* the tomb, mostly because the moving air outside cooled me down."

Fitness,fdkruzb,t3_elqte7,1578509852.0,"This guy in my gym absolutely DESTROYS the leg curl machine. I'm talking about slamming at the top and bottom of his rep. And not the ""Hey this is PF, if we even hear two molecules from those weights move, we're hitting the lunk alarm"" slamming - it was like he was trying to break the damn machine. 

The worst part is, he kept looking over at me and smiling like ""yea you couldn't do this if you tried."" I'm never someone who shames the numbers you're lifting, but I walked by the leg curl machine after he was done and it was set to 70lbs.

I wish people would just read what's on some of these machines....as if the adjustment pulleys weren't already bright yellow."

Why?!"

aww,fdgtyox,t1_fdgtefb,1578408259.0,"If you live in the states, consider donations to your local DFW (Departments of Fish and Wildlife).

BlackPeopleTwitter,fd60v9c,t1_fd5zmgd,1578183962.0,"What's goofy is thinking that because some people rely on loans and/or government assistance, that they're being lazy. 

I relied on loans. My estimated family contribution was $500 a semester. I couldn't have afforded community college with that, let alone the college I decided to go to. I could have busted my ass off for some employer who didn't give a fuck about me so I could take pride in ""working my way through college."" Or, I could have busted my ass **in** college and positioned myself to pay those loans back. 

I chose the second. My college was nearly $60,000/year, but I'm blessed to say I have under $10k left on my loan payments.

I'm not saying I'm better than anybody, but I sure as hell wasn't ""lazy"" because I took out loans."

aww,fcy6ua1,t3_ejgf12,1578075638.0,"The other day as I was leaving my house, I saw a handsome chonk of a cat laying by my neighbor's door. I made eye contact and he got up, stretched, and stared at me, but didn't move.

Yesterday afternoon, as I left my house for the gym, I opened my door and saw the same cat by my neighbor's door. This time, the cat looked right at me then ran over. I put my hand down and it immediately started rubbing on me something fierce.

I know that's a typical reddit story, but that morning I had gotten a call that my grandmother had just died, and I'm currently alone while my whole family is on the other side of the country. It's like the cat knew I was hurting and ran over to console me.

I know it's just coincidence and he's probably just a friendly neighborhood cat, but that doesn't explain why I randomly went to check the mail at 6:30 this morning, opened the door, and saw the same cat, who ran over to me without hesitation this time."

So many comments on people's own experiences with cars out here, interesting ways people have made money with the cars they like, people who are willing to get their hands dirty to get a car that they want. Jokes and anecdotes and general conversation around buying cars in a market that we all live in.

Then look at your comment. 

If you don't want to engage in a positive way (constructive can be positive), then do a favor for all the non-jaded people and see yourself out please. It rains enough out here, nobody needs y'all being wet blankets."
