Both parents with me in the car heading out to eat. ""What do feel like eating?"" from me is answered with, ""I don't care"" or ""You choose"" from them. Suggestions follow, most of which get shot down. The last time they did this, I got so disgusted I pulled over and gave them two choices: pick somewhere now or go home. They chose.

Moved back home to help out (fire at my place in '18, didn't make sense to maintain two places with aging parents), and dinner was always like pulling teeth. I've reached the point where I don't ask, just cook. As far as I'm concerned they can eat it or not. 

I know this makes me sound like a raging bitch on wheels, but I've got my own issues and am often unwell. Getting the shopping done and meal on the table is hard enough, and some days I literally cannot do both. Negotiating their indecisiveness as well is a dealbreaker for me.

At least my mom cleans without prompting, though. Dad doesn't but he's also 87 and frail. A partner my age who's equally useless would probably land me in prison."

JUSTNOMIL,fedrsb6,t1_fedm969,1579018503.0,"I burned two fingers just above my nails late on Christmas eve 2018. Only place open that late was an ER. Ironically, I was in too much pain to go. I sat at the dining table for ~five hours with my fingers in ice water until they stopped hurting long enough for Neosporin to work. Kept reapplying it every 1-2 hours for two days, then switched over to 3-4 hours. As bad as the burns were, weirdly there are no scars.

I've been more careful since."

Why? She's an adult and responsible for herself and her own feelings. This may not help you but honestly, I think you should step away for a period of time. Tell her beforehand that you're doing so for self-care. Then mute her into oblivion. Restrict her to texts & emails only and let your husband read them. He can tell you anything you actually *need* to know and because it'll be relayed to you in his words, not hers, it may lessen the impact.

Best wishes."

A *little* bit? This crazy woman wanted her daughter to get a rhinoplasty on an already perfect nose.

I understand that the doctor was trying to be diplomatic but damn. Think he soft-pedaled that too much. Crazy lady didn't strike me as the type to be convinced by anything short of a 2x4.

ETA: And before she goes after her daughter, she really should have started with herself. She would've benefitted a helluva lot more from cosmetic procedures than her daughter... and she actually needed them."

I understand that it was hers first, but you're in it now. Add a chain or bar lock to it to keep her out when you're home. And then add a deadbolt she doesn't have a key for. You should never come home to her *waiting for you inside.* That's just too much.

Also- counseling for you and DH right now."
