Edit: As per [this](https://www.businessinsider.com/jeff-bezos-phone-hacked-saudi-crown-prince-mbs-report-explained-2020-1) article I found."
iphone,ffj1y5g,t1_ffit25v,1579988350.0,It was the newest model iPhone at the time this occurred.
iphone,ffj1vwr,t1_ffiujmv,1579988305.0,"I’m sure he would use the iPhone X Ultra 5000 if that existed, but at the time the X was the best iPhone out there. What’s funny is that he didn’t use an Amazon phone."
Android,ffiyuaw,t1_ffim0p2,1579986091.0,"It’s not. In both cases a new model comes out every year and you’re not required to replace it in any way. No one, even the companies making them, expect you to. It’s actually fiscally and environmentally irresponsible to do so. It’s entirely possible to trade up every year in either case... you just shouldn’t."

electricvehicles,ffhxaow,t1_ffgqdj4,1579957969.0,I still don’t get it. I admit I watched it on mute but it zooms in on the side of the car that says “hybrid” on it...
electricvehicles,ffhx77g,t1_ffhrwn4,1579957855.0,"I think that’s what he’s saying. They won’t disappear from Norway’s roads, they’ll “disappear from the market”"
learnart,ffhwk8h,t1_ffhnm6s,1579957111.0,Yeah I think they just got way better at shading and anatomy and nothing related to the direction of lighting...
Android,ffhwg5g,t1_ffhg00c,1579956976.0,Imagine paying 20k for a car that gets replaced in a year
Android,ffhwdsc,t1_ffhmbw6,1579956899.0,This is probably the innovation I’m most looking forward to. A 90 or 120hz screen will be awesome. Hopefully they go straight to 120 instead of doing 90 this year and using 120 next year as a reason to upgrade.
Android,ffhwb4z,t1_ffhepn1,1579956808.0,"Yeah that really looks like it’ll have to have the screen on the outside of the phone (I mean when folded closed). I love the progress they’ve made, pretty incredible really. When folded closed it would have a smaller cellphone sized screen, when open its a tablet I guess?"
science,ffhvb08,t1_ffhoagl,1579955572.0,"I find it so frustrating when people say “regular flu is much more deadly.”  Sure, the “regular” flu that we’ve had around forever *has* killed more people... because it has infected millions or billions more than this new virus has. The number of people the coronavirus has killed compared to the number it has infected is much higher and *that* is the problem here. If it ends up infecting the number that the yearly flu does then the death toll would be far higher (for that year).

It’s not much better than saying “supervirus kills 100% of the people it has infected but that’s only 1000 people so far, so influenza is far more deadly”"
