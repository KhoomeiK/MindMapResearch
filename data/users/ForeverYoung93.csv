Only to make a point. People with disabilities cannot necessarily use a shower, they need a bath or else they cannot clean themselves. That too for some is a genuine problem and not an inconvenience. 

It is a bad idea to use examples on this because for you these minor things would be inconveniences... but let's say you have no internet but live in an isolate community and can't teleconference with your doctor? 

People really like to get jacked up on first world problems being meaningless but often that it because you possess a level of privilege or ignorance. 

A few years ago had an issue where half the city had frozen pipes. People were told to stop complaining because you could just boil snow or buy water bottles. We lived in an apartment complex so everyone else was hoarding the snow. We didn't have a car so couldn't buy water in bulk. When we did take a cab once to pick up water, they were sold out and we were put $60 for the cab. We went weeks without a reliable source of water... we could only drink limited amounts at work. We could not bathe. My dog had diarhea and was covered in his own shit... so I was then touching germ filled diarhea with no way to properly clean us both up. 

But we were still told it was a first world problem to not have running water and that we couldn't complain because people had it worse. These people were the ones with backyards filled with snow and a basement filled with bottled water."

When they came home the next day looking for her and her things, my heart broke. One of our dogs was very close with the cat and he started panicking when he couldn't find her, similar to a time where she got out. 

The next day he started having seizures that only worsened over the next few months. Vet insists it is just a coincidence that he suddenly developed a seizure disorder the very next day with no medical cause, but it is pretty clear to us that it was the trauma of her being gone and not coming home.

It makes me wonder if all of his suffering could have been avoided if he was somehow part of the process and understood that she was dead, and not just suddenly gone. But who knows, could have made it worse."

When you call that is the best plan. I honestly think the worst case scenario is that they are annoyed with needing to send a new link. But you can also ask if it would be easier to email it or bring it with you on your first day. 

Apologizing and explaining is professional. These things happen to everyone, even bigshot professionals that have been working for 20 years.

My rule of thumb is that I say yes if I want it and if it isn't an imposition. A glass of eater/einr/slice of food is a small think and unless I am genuinely not hungry or thirsty, I accept.

This resonates with me because my therapist pointed out (after a similar disappointment) that I was acting like my coworkers were my friends, not my colleagues. 

Colleagues aren't nice to you because they are your friend or they necessarily care, but because that is what you do. Most interactions are rather shallow and often motivated by their own selfish needs. 

It can be so easy to blur these lines and start feeling like they are your friends. Then shit like this happens and you want to tell Karen to learn how to do her job for once and cut Jim's fingers off the next time he borrows your stapler. 

It is all about changing your perspective and expectations. You may have some genuine friends at work but you also have a pile of acquaintances. Take stock of your relationships to know which are genuine and which are professional. If your efforts aren't being reciprocated, take note and only offer as much energy that you are willing to give away.

I ran into a similar problem at a home show in my small northern town. A lot of Aboriginal vendors in a predominantly white community... they were there for money. 

So I spend time with this younger teen picking put the pair of gloves I wanted to purchase. She calls either her parent or grandparent from behind their curtain to ring up the sale. When she comes out she looks at me and then mutters something to the teen. The girl comes back all flustered saying that she can't sell me the gloves. 

I tried to get an explanation but she couldn't say and wouldn't call the woman back. I asked what gloves I could buy and she told me none. I suspected it was because I was white and walked away. 

I watched them from a distance and saw the same thing happen again with a few white customers. One was only allowed to buy a wool scarf that was knitted by the teen. The actual good merchandise (leaver gloves, bead work, etc..) was only actually sold to a few aboriginals.

I felt like I'd be an asshole because I was a white person claiming racism against a minority but in hindsight I should have reported them to the organizers.
