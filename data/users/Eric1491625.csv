Well, I guess if my life is crushed by a government official, that is tereible. But if my life is crushed by a company manager, that is okay /s"

Commonality: poorly educated or superstitious folks in both countries. ""Vaccines cause autism"" is the US equivalent ignorant statement of ""eating bats is good""."

worldnews,ffjl81h,t1_ffit6sk,1580000797.0,OP's comment was pointing out that China shows that Western governments shouldn't scrap food regulations...I agreed...somehow now I'm Chinese troll. Lol.

worldnews,ffi074l,t1_ffhut6x,1579961034.0,">Why do people eat wild animals?

It's... kinda how humans have been for 99.9% of our species history, so it's not surprising many places still do that. Heck non-farmed fish are wild. Wild deer is served in many places too.

In fact eating wild animals is generally considered much more humane than eating non-wild animals. Y'know, those factory farmed chickens cramped into tiny spaces."
worldnews,ffhzqc7,t1_ffh3maz,1579960571.0,"Yeah and so why not regulate it?

Western conservatives need to think hard about whether their supposedly superior free market ideology ought to apply to food markets in China. And if not, they ought to maybe rethink their ideas about deregulating food."

Life expectancy in China actually increased 20 years under Mao (even with the great leap forward) due to the fact that the state provided vastly improved healthcare and education. In fact Chinese at the end of Mao's reign could expect to live 10 years longer than Indians, a little-known fact mentioned by Indian Nobel laureate Amartya Sen. Sen also mentioned that more Indians died ""naturally"" due to poverty than Chinese died ""unnaturally"" during the great leap forward over the second half of the 20th century. 

Also having a terrible dictator is at least an improvement over civil war. Peace under dictator beats civil war any day. Maoist China >warlords China. Gaddafi Libya > warlords Libya. Saddam Iraq > Chaos Iraq. And so on."

worldnews,ffeys2m,t1_ffeus6t,1579870697.0,"Um...no.

People dying doesn't overthrow governments. Remember when *60 million people died* and they didn't get overthrown? Meanwhile the only time they came close to getting overthrown is when times were actually overall improving in the 80s.

It's funny you would think during an epidemic people would want to come out en masse in the streets to overthrow a government...like yeah, go to super crowded demonstration during epidemic, not a good idea.

Heck, imagine if some Wuhan people got the idea that ""I'm sick, also I'm rich, time to seek medical help in New York before they lock us down"". It may be a good thing they delayed public panic until measures are in place. Many countries do this."
worldnews,ffeyap0,t1_ffevlh9,1579870233.0,"They're actually not as bad as you think. It's because most Redditors have simply never cared about any *actual* shitholes and terrible governments.

Few pay attention to the daily fuckery of Belarus or Afghanistan or Pakistan because they don't matter like China does. China is also 1/5 of the world's people so every number in the news is very large.

China's government is actually above average on a global level. It's simply that no country on Earth that has a worse government matters enough for the average Redditor know about it.

The world is like:

Actually good western governments: Top 5% <= Netherlands is here

Good-ish governments: Next 10% <= USA and Japan here

Kinda trashy governments: Next 35% <= Turkey and China and India are here (Yes, even India, their PM oversaw slaughter of muslims with death toll = 3x Tiananmen Square)

Awful governments: Next 30% <= Pakistan is here 

What the fuck/no stable government: bottom 20% <= North Korea, Congo and Sudan are here - What are considered once-in-decades atrocities in China happen here on daily basis, nobody gives a fuck however."

badeconomics,ffbqfz8,t1_ffaedgl,1579778544.0,">I have seen is just to say, any acceptance provided before this date is non-binding, there is no expectation of non-reneging before this date. 

It already is non-binding, at least legally speaking, before you sign the contract.

Even if it were legally binding (e.g. signed a contract), a person would likely get away with reneging. This is because, unless the applicant is some high-level executive, it would be very difficult for the company to show that it has suffered financial harm from the reneging. And without proof of harm, there are no grounds for damages in a civil suit. At least this is how it should work in most common law countries."
badeconomics,ffbpmle,t1_ffajx19,1579777411.0,">The percentile-based question is meaningless because in a country like Ethiopia, the top quartile and bottom half are both just really poor. I would not consider it mobile just because you can go from poor to poor easily.

I disagree. Just because the top 10% in Ethiopia may be poor from a US standard doesn't mean it is poor from an Ethiopian standard, and that is what really matters.

Heck, from the perspective of people in 2500AD with their flying cars, Americans in 2019 are also going from poor to poor. Does that make any difference to how Americans should see their society?"
