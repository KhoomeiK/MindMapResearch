If you’re all spread out, it could be the only time the two families ever meet. It’s a great way to introduce everyone to who you are as a couple.

AmItheAsshole,ffif459,t3_etnlt6,1579972366.0,"YTA... This reminds me of an ex I had who refused to do even basic nice things for me sometimes because he didn’t want me to get “spoiled”.  I was  out of his league in many ways, and he was so terrified of me “gaining the upper hand” in the relationship that he basically destroyed my self esteem over a few years until I didn’t think I deserved better and groveled for the smallest scrap of affection. I’ve heard many, many similar stories.

OP you should dig deep and think about why you wouldn’t rub her feet.  Have you ever asked her for a foot rub? Would she do it for you? Do you feel resentful when she asks you to do things?"

stopdrinking,ff9jmqm,t3_esark6,1579714410.0,"I realized when I sincerely stopped, so many events I associate with alcohol only had alcohol because of me. If it’s not me bringing beer to a bike ride or climbing trip, no one else would think to drink. Had a few friends over for brunch, and no one brought booze or asked for any. Before, I would have made pitchers of mimosas and then we’d switch to whiskey.

I thought I was part of a hard-drinking crowd, but that was because I’m the main event planner of my friends and EVERYTHING was at a bar, or we’d plan cocktails before, or I’d sneak wine for everyone into the theatre.
