Duskers,ffdkp5e,t3_et12u9,1579822921.0,"Sensor - Use it when luring enemies to different rooms. For instance, room A is clear so you drop a sensor in it. Room B next door you know has an enemy. Open the door between Room A & B, the sensor triggers in Room A letting you know the enemy is now there. Close the door. Room B is now clear. Sensors can also detect slime.

Scan - Helpful in finding hidden items, you may as well scan each room and pick up any extra scrap laying around.

Terminals - Make sure you're not in a room that has a defence turret in it. Because if you turn on the defence it'll take out your bot."

Guitar,ff5napc,t1_ff4cii1,1579601484.0,"Then after that learn the pentatonic scale - usually start with the A major scale but it's easy to go anywhere. Same shape at different starting fret.

Go onto YouTube, search for A major backing track and just play up and down the scale.

You'll learn to hear what sounds good and what doesn't. Or rather what you like and what you don't like.

When you get frustrated with learning actual songs it's a great way to jam by yourself.

EDIT: This is a great way to improve finger dexterity. But definitely learn the chords first because they'll build fundamental movement of fingers."

bjj,fdgkvbj,t1_fdgk0g9,1578400731.0,"There was some prestige with training with the Gracie family back in the day (Helio days), and so they would only train those that they wanted to, or could pay. However there was also another guy, Oswaldo Fadda, who would let anybody train at his gym - including those that lived in the favelas/slums. So there was a bit of a rivalry between the Gracie's and Fadda.

Fadda issued a challenge to the Gracies, saying that he had 20 students ready to fight. In the end Fadda's team won and they used a lot of leglocks. Helio apparently called them ""poor"" techniques in relation to their social status, and was obviously pissed off because he hadn't trained in them too much. I think from there he completely ignored them out of spite rather than building on them... not quite sure.

So historically leg locks were deemed ""poor"" jiu jitsu and therefore not worthy.

ALTERNATIVELY, leg locks were also considered shit due to the fact that you had to give up a lot of position in order to attack one. By going for a straight ankle lock you had very little control over the rest of your opponents body. However, this has obviously been improved throughout the years to the point where leg locks are perhaps one of the most dangerous positions - especially in no-gi."
