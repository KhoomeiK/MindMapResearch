SuicideWatch,feizqsw,t3_epebdp,1579151872.0,"Well, I lost my gf/ best friend and she accused me of all these things I didnt do from 5 years ago. Blocked me, called me psycho, a liar, a rapist and all this other shit..I've never done any of that. And for someone I loved and cared about to say all those things just put me in a dark place"
SuicideWatch,feiwo97,t3_epeazd,1579149263.0,What's making you feel worthless?
SuicideWatch,fefyons,t3_eoyatg,1579069716.0,"It's hard to explain..but I had been dating this amazing woman for awhile. My super toxic and abusive ex got in contact with her and started telling all these lies about me to her, and going into  detail about a lot of bad shit that happened with us. Eventually she ended up accusing me of rape and telling what was my current gf this, who was understandably shaken. So now, because of this, my ex, the abusive one who I have children with, decided I couldnt contact the children or anything for denying the accusations. Some things I have done, I am not proud of, and have tried to be better. But all sources of happiness have been completely taken from me and it doesn't matter anymore."

SuicideWatch,feebby9,t1_fee9zqz,1579030244.0,"I think it's just an easy out, in a way. Like if or when I ever mess things up beyond repair, taking my life would be the most viable solution in my eyes."
SubredditAdoption,fedvsfq,t3_eonore,1579020940.0,"I would like to make this subreddit a place where people can share their own come-up stories, because we all know stability takes work, failure, and progress. It isn't always pretty, which would give users the opportunity to find relatable content and create a community of support and humor."
SuicideWatch,fedr3fu,t3_eoc598,1579018073.0,"I feel the exact same way. I am constantly riddled with suicidal ideation. It's a constant thought, and have attempted more times than I can count. The weird thing is, every time I've attempted, I've never actually died. Despite doing research on overdoses, etc. So idk lol."

SuicideWatch,fdqeqot,t3_emjsqj,1578664760.0,"I understand your shame and guilt. I've done some really bad self destructive things in the past that not only hurt me, but those around me. You are very brave for sharing this with a group of strangers, and the fact that you acknowledge that you dont want to give in to these urges, expressed remorse, says a lot about your character. Get into support groups, talk to people who you feel safe sharing with and give yourself credit for your accomplishments. I know its hard, as I have struggled with my own issues, not necessarily the same as yours, but having to come to terms with what defines me and what doesn't. I chose not to let my past or the darker side if myself be who I am. I chose kindness and acceptance for myself and others. You will find that in time."

rantgrumps,fc9eur3,t3_egity5,1577551617.0,"I've been watching GG consistently for the past 2 years. While I still love them and watch them most weeks, I end up watching their older stuff more than the newer. I've noticed that in a lot of their old episodes, it seemed like the conversation and jokes were more free flowing, whereas now it feels, idk...like forced? They have taken on a lot more projects this year, so I can definitely understand energy levels and such, but Arin has also stated that they want to be consistent in their GG, as well as projects. Unfortunately, it just hasn't been. There have definitely been some gems this year, but more few and far between. Am I the only one who thinks it could also come down to game selection?"
cats,fbgxldz,t1_fbfwpyg,1576860897.0,Thank you! I just got him 2 weeks ago and he is the best fur baby^-^
