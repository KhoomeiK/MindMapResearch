AmItheAsshole,fek09c0,t3_ep9wbx,1579189833.0,"NTA. I've got about 100 acres of mixed cleared and forested land in a rural area.  The previous owner was very absentee, so the neighbors and locals made use of his land, some with, some without permission.  When we purchased the land, I made sure to obnoxiously post the land and aggressively patrol the perimeter during bigger hunting seasons.  Anything with a clearing on either side of the boundary got a fence (three wires, top is barbed, plain wood posts every 12 feet).

There were a few trespassers to begin with.  Most hadn't realized the property changed hands and assumed they were ok, but were ultimately respectful.  One was less pleasant to work with, claiming his family has hunted that land for decades.  When I'm out dealing with trespassers, I'll keep a Go Pro running to document everything, and I'll take lots of pictures.  Repeat offenders got reported to the local PD and game commission.  If worse comes to worst, I'm prepared to defend myself.  Thankfully, we haven't had any issues over the past year.
