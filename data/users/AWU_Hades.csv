Rainbow6,ffi15db,t1_ffi0liy,1579961941.0,"Bullshit. Everyone can change it, where's the advantage? As it is now, everyone without colorblindness has an advantage over me. Is this fair?"
Rainbow6,ffhywrq,t1_ffhykuw,1579959735.0,The color. I would make it yellow or blue for me
Rainbow6,ffhy32s,t1_ffhxj5v,1579958867.0,No there isn't any option for colorblind people. Modern warfare does it right and puts a filter over the entire graphic to change it up. I wish Siege would do this too.
Rainbow6,ffhun64,t3_etq20y,1579954703.0,They need to add custom sight optics. I'm colorblind and have trouble to play Villa or Kafe with all its red backgrounds.

BattlefieldV,ffercbm,t1_ffeop9e,1579861704.0,I won't go so far calling Anthem a game.
BattlefieldV,fferauj,t1_ffeqzeg,1579861641.0,"Because everyone has access to the Type 2A at the same time, it's sort of balanced. Imagine if it was at rank 40 in the chapter rewards. People who have no time to unlock it can't play it for weeks while others who payed for it can dominate with it. Does this sound fair to you?

Pay-2win starts where guns and other stuff that give advantages are locked behind a paywall. Sure, you'll be able to grind things out but until then people who spent money have an advantage. THIS is pay-2-win, even it's only for a short time period each chapter. This is not good for players with less time or money."
BattlefieldV,ffer491,t1_ffeoqpv,1579861371.0,"Yes, they were. Some of the guns/gadgets in these DLC were so good they gave players a huge advantage. Let me just remember you to the UCAV drone in BF4 or the FAMAS in Battlefield 3.

I don't think you understand what pay-2-win means."
