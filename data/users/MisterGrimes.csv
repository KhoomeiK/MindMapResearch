DestinyTheGame,fc3cb7e,t3_eftura,1577386642.0,"You do realize that it's not that complicated...you completed everything...you basically beat the game at this point.

In D1 I hit that point where I had ALL the best gear, the raids were too easy, friends stopped playing, there was no real new content...we all just sat around waiting for the next DLC and new content. And when that came out, if it wasn't enough to hold your attention for more than a week, you basically just took a break or quit.

You could become a completionist and try for 100% triumphs/achievements or go the collector route and hunt all the exotics in the game even the ones you don't need...but then you're just doing it so you're not bored and most people would probably move on to another game...or get back to real life for a bit.
