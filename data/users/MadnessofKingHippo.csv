So many suicides and depressed people don't get counseling because of outdated stigma around it, even today.  So many people think that there has to be some kind of inciting incident (like a divorce, or loss of a loved one, or going to war, etc.) before you can be ""properly"" depressed or anxious.

For me, the survivors guilt also gets difficult because it's mixed in with guilt of making my loved ones suffer through my disease, having to watch me get sicker and sicker, go through all the pains and frequent stays in ICU over the course of a year and the countless nights where I, and they too, would go to sleep and have the fear that I wouldn't make it through the night.  Now that I wound up getting through and am in remission, I feel so much like its my fault that we have all these leftover traumatic feelings and memories.  Like what could I have done to change this (I should have gone to the doctor sooner, I could have been more attentive to my body, etc.).  I feel relieved too, but also guilty, just like you do.  It doesn't help either that my personal family and my wife really became divided during my cancer treatment (that's a whole other story) and oftentimes I feel like I wish I had died instead, because at least then both sides could separate and move on in time.  All I can say is that you should definitely consider therapy if you haven't already, and anti depressants as well.  It's not a cure, but it does help manage."

eldertrees,fffgom9,t1_ffeijc7,1579883566.0,"I personally think there's a big connection between CHS being more common and happening to more people, and the rise in popularity of highly potent concentrates.  We likely didn't see it happen as much until now because nobody was using such high potency products for so long, things like dabbing are fairly new and even though it's always said that because of the higher potency, you need less of it....let's be real and admit that people often use them just as much as they would regular flower.  Like it's one thing to smoke a gram of bud, and another to dab a gram of wax (and people often dab much more than that in a single day or even single session).  I don't think it's an accident that a lot of people who wound up coming down with CHS were also really into dabs and powerful edibles every day.  I know people who have completely stopped using flower, and only use concentrates, yet the amount they use and how much in a day hasn't changed.  There's just no way that's good for you."
