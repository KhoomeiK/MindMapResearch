UnresolvedMysteries,ffnho2o,t1_ffm98xu,1580066111.0,"I dont think that fact is all that interesting - I expect it because LE has a responsibility to withhold that statement until they are positive. As soon as you release that to the press, you have a lot of locals who are now very scared/panicking 

Since they have to wait until they're more or less positive, it makes sense to me that theyre the last to admit it.

Further, they're also probably reluctant to admit it because in doing so they are also admitting ""this one person has killed multiple times and we have been unable to catch him"""

It needs power to do this. If the phone stayed connected to internet or GPS or even pinged a tower, it would be lower battery when you turn it back on than when you turn it off.

Go ahead and test. Leave your phone off for 5 hours and walk around. If its bouncing between cell towers, you will notice at the very least a 1-2% loss in charge and this does not happen."

Seriously, if you have anxiety and Facebook, try staying off of Facebook for a week and see how your anxiety is checking in - I guarantee it will be much, much better."
