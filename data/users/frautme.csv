Existentialism,ffcsz2t,t1_ffc5iq7,1579806631.0,Time to open *Infinite Jest* again.
nihilism,ffb7hyx,t3_esmgt1,1579753955.0,"I’m a wandering determinist as much as the next guy, but I don’t go around constantly thinking “Oh shit, I didn’t decide that.”

Stop letting your head ramble and just enjoy what subjective experience has to offer. There’s a reasonable chance we’re all wrong about this anyway. Stop caring, it’s practically nihilism’s mantra."
nihilism,ffb6r8n,t3_esnm9u,1579753300.0,"Nothing’s certain, but if I were a betting man I’d label this gif as potently accurate."
nihilism,ffao0va,t1_ffamazt,1579740453.0,"That whole album, really."
nihilism,ffanywf,t3_esfywt,1579740415.0,Father John Misty’s album *Pure Comedy* has some nihilistic tones.
subaru,ff9m8ht,t3_es9gvw,1579715942.0,It’s true. Wrecking my Honda Accord and buying my Subaru Forester felt like metamorphosis.
radiohead,ff9lxxu,t3_es7sa4,1579715771.0,There’s our boy wonder.
AskMen,ff9lq4p,t3_esertn,1579715643.0,"Observant, probably to a fault."
DunderMifflin,ff85gm6,t3_es00fq,1579666515.0,"It’s strange, while experiencing my 13th watch-through I’ve noticed Dwight and I handle trauma remarkably similarly. This isn’t the only time he remarks about his emotional resistance being superior. Kind of chips me up thinking I share a mindset with such a ridiculous and hilarious character."
Existentialism,ff6re0w,t3_eryrtz,1579633292.0,"Camus, *The Myth of Sisyphus*

I had a kind of identity crisis around a year ago and found his interpretation of the world to be an enlightening one. Perhaps not one for you to believe yourself, but perspective helps. 

I also second what else has been said though. This is above our pay-grade."
englishmajors,ff6qqe7,t3_erylmj,1579632902.0,"That’s posh behavior. Language is an evolving structure, whether it be English or Hindi. If they’re implying American English lacks properness because it’s contemporary and moving at a different pace, then I’d advise them to study up on the origins of Proto-Germanic languages so they can read for themselves that *that* isn’t how it actually works."
movies,ff6j91e,t3_ertfkx,1579628380.0,Cavill really sold me on the last film. I genuinely went and watched it because of him.
samharris,ff6j10h,t3_erxact,1579628244.0,"I can’t say I’ve always liked him, and I’m not certain I do now, but Glenn is risking everything just to shine a little light in a part of the world we know almost nothing about. For that, I have to hand it to him."
nihilism,ff568fh,t3_erpazl,1579581398.0,"When the first wave of glaring futility hits, I think it’s pretty reasonable for most people to experience general anxiety and existential dread. Overtime, though, these feelings really ought to dissipate. Through the right lens, nihilism doesn’t have to be a disposition that’s meant to turn a happy ignoramus sad. It’s a worldview like any other, and there are ways to endure. The most vexing part of living, I think, is trying to find the most efficient and durable way to achieve a comfortable, or at the very least bearable, state of living.

But honestly, this trouble comes with the territory. Contemplating our purpose, or lack thereof, is bound to cause some nagging headaches."
nihilism,ff55ba7,t3_ero5wc,1579580649.0,"I think it’s an efficient method for opting out of a raw deal. I don’t have much use for it myself because I don’t think I’ve quite reached that point of boredom or frustration. But anytime I hear it happening, whether it be random or someone I know personally, I can’t say I’ve ever faulted their decision to act."
fatherjohnmisty,ff3jdtj,t1_ff3iw83,1579542300.0,"Yeah, but you don’t have to use it like this."
fatherjohnmisty,ff3iacn,t1_ff3aadq,1579541628.0,Don’t be this guy. Music resonates to different people for different reasons. Your tastes are not supreme.
nihilism,ff1wbbv,t3_eqqgc8,1579487643.0,Applicable.
nihilism,feyfuaj,t3_eqqbe0,1579444938.0,Last few months the universe had me convinced otherwise. I don’t know why I was naive enough to believe it.
nihilism,fe6ml1d,t1_fe6dp63,1578896060.0,"That’s neat, what you did there. But next time just pick points to argue instead of rewriting what I said. Much more apt to have a conversation about it."
nihilism,fe63ldv,t1_fe63i07,1578881018.0,That’s the spirit.
nihilism,fe631r5,t1_fe62i2k,1578880662.0,You would probably like Pure Comedy by Father John Misty.
nihilism,fe62acn,t1_fe611l5,1578880180.0,Got to find some way a cope.
AskMen,fe60yke,t1_fe5v1nn,1578879338.0,You’re letting your insecurity talk for you.
nihilism,fe60716,t1_fe5zh9n,1578878851.0,"For me it’s feeling content for having not made bad decisions, even if they would have felt pleasurable at the time.

I guess to put it most simply, it amounts to being proud of the choices you’ve made."
nihilism,fe5ur6l,t1_fe5t34p,1578875400.0,"Ignore this silly, obese goose."
nihilism,fe5sivl,t3_envnkm,1578873989.0,"For me, my morality stems from the fruitless attempt of maximizing general well-being. There are objective trues as to what heightens well-being and what deflates it, but much of it is a grey area and is strictly circumstantial. The fun is deciding which course of action is best depending on the situation. It’s a game that constantly requires careful attention.

I do agree with you, though. I think there is an innate desire to be treated fairly, and over the course of our development we’ve realized the easiest way to attain it is to play by the same rules. I wouldn’t call it selfish or insincere, but living by these norms is certainly beneficial to us. So, for the time being, the system largely works."
AskMen,fe5q2zo,t1_fe3tki0,1578872953.0,"Yeah, which broad thought this was a good idea?"
Existentialism,fe5ojsn,t3_ent53m,1578872220.0,Uncaring leans more towards nihilism. Existentialism recognizes the same futility but differs with their response to it. Existentialists believe there’s a way out of the void; nihilists bask in the void’s seemingly inescapable nature.
YangForPresidentHQ,fe5njcc,t3_enu5x0,1578871830.0,"MSNBC is nothing more than a bad joke at this point. They guise their maliciousness as carelessness, and it’s never likely they’ll admit to the latter."
nihilism,fe5n0we,t1_fe5j0yu,1578871524.0,"What is the point, then?"
nihilism,fe5mru6,t3_entw7s,1578871492.0,"It’s compatible insofar that you can do whatever you want without concern of divine judgment. But in an attempt to maximize well-being, my own experience has taught me that chasing temporary pleasures is a poor method of attaining it."
fatherjohnmisty,fe5l2ae,t3_enslcn,1578870818.0,"I think the people who have issue with his lyricism just don’t agree with his disposition. To fully enjoy his music, you have to on some level see the world as he does."
fatherjohnmisty,fbe3fka,t1_fbd5802,1576777336.0,"Yeah this picture was more in reference to that interview stating he had to leave due to inner ego. Not seriously implying he hated playing with the band, just thought the picture comedically depicted some of his drumming frustration."
