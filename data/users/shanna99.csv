witcher,ff80s2s,t1_ff8013w,1579663006.0,"> It's a fairytale with a fairytale logic. Just like you don't really  question people falling in love at first sight (as Geralt does) in a  fairytale, you don't look for bulletproof logic with these kinds of  what-ifs. 

Yes of course... it's just that it's a major plot point and kind of pivotal to a lot of the story so I just wondered if I was missing something, is all."
witcher,ff7zndh,t1_ff7sr3i,1579662194.0,"But once Geralt has made his last wish then he is no longer the djinn's master, no? Which is why the djinn is able to go free afterwards, so why wouldn't he just kill her after Geralt has no more wishes / is not his master anymore? Unless after he was free he just didn't care anymore?"

aww,ff7akqx,t1_ff71oam,1579644715.0,[Why do people copy and paste comments???](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/erw4cy/found_this_little_guy_after_he_walked_up_to_us/ff6gykn/) Literally what is the purpose of taking someone's comment from three hours earlier and pasting it into a comment chain further up just so you can get internet points? This is so pathetic.
aww,fel3df0,t3_epj6n3,1579213184.0,Omg I follow and love this instagram account. These girls are at yokokikuchi\_ks and if you follow them you will quickly learn that the white one (Hina) is the quirkiest and funniest little shiba around and makes the best faces (and is the chonkiest).

nyc,fde587b,t1_fddznti,1578331453.0,"I've heard that if you already have a fake Christmas tree, it's better to keep using it instead of buying a real one each year, but if you don't have one already, it's better to get real ones because of the carbon footprint associated with producing fake trees. Not sure if that's true but sounds legit enough for me."
