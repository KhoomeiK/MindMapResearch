Fortnite = build and get out manuvered inside ur own walls or dont build and watch a tower rize in front of you and get 1 shot from a far any way (good ideia but makes no sence building simulator in fast paced action game multiplayer ) .

Apex run fast , loot fast , games duration not more 20 minutes max , instant action , or loot fot 5 minutes then action, u actually can choose . Less then 1 minute between games perfect batle royal only doenst have single queue or that many maps /modes avaible . Still the best <3"
