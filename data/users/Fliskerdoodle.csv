Uhhhh.... COPY PASTE lol. 

 I mean you could do that, give up on life I mean .


But then you'd be like everybody else. Falling into comfortability instead of breaking through to the unknown. 

 If you're at the end of your rope, Then you should do something scary that your body will not instinctually want to do. 



What's something you've never done that you could do, that wanted to do? Because that's what youre going to do next.

When i was 15 I felt exactly the same. I still feel the same sometimes (27). I had nowhere and nobody to just get my thoughts out there. Never wrote it down, didnt think about it. I wanted so badly to be loved and appreciated. Ive come to learn thats what most people are seeking. With their pain deeply rooted and woven into their being. You see people in the streets, paranoid, afraid to do the wrong thing. Its all the same fear, the sense of purposeless. So they cling to whatever is safe to do, or safe to be. 

*Ok now onto something else*. 

I grew up with an abusive father and mother. Taking care of my autistic brother. Id be slammed on concrete, kicked in the face, thrown down the stairs. My father would run Dog Fights. Beating puppies to make them meaner, blood & fur covered sticks were leaned against the house. It didnt make me tough, it made me afraid of living. In 2nd grade I tried to jump out of a moving care coming back from school. Years after when me, my mom, and brother escaped. My mother sexually and emotionally abused me. Telling me I was weak, and equally as retarded as my brother. While simultaneously being poisoned by her. 

*Somehow school was worse*.

The teachers told me I was disabled and bullied me as much as any of the students... even in high school. I was ugly, unkept, socially a wreck. People would smirk, jab at my man boobs and generally take pleasure in being dominant over me. Now not only was my home against me, so was everyone else. I saw them as my parents, manipulative, wanting to hurt me just cause they could. 


**Why am I saying all this??**


My mom, my dad, the teachers, students. They all did have something in common, something I didn't discover until much later. 

It was a sense of purpose. 

So simple. 


Years later, after doing what youre doing now. 
I feel  Like I have the luckiest life in the world. I feel proud of myself for how much I've learned and gone through. I don't smile continuously every day, Instead I know I'm one of the few the who walks with his eyes open. Instead of trying to appeal to people in an artificial way.  Now I know whatever I want is actually attainable, as long as I put the work behind it. It also has the added benefit of me loving myself for putting work into things. I thought for the longest time I just had to keep **myself** from saying horrible things about **myself**.  That was never gonna work.. That's like beating a man so he keeps working. Why would I do that to myself?  In fact, while I'm on the subject -> 
Why did everybody else do it too?

Its because it was easier. 
It's easier to yell let your kid, to beat them into submission. Instead of spending the time to learn about them. Trying to cultivate good behaviors and to know that their feelings are not invalid.  Being a true supportive figure in their life.

But that takes a person who's worked on themselves. Which too is very hard.. 


**Heres what I wanted to say to 15 year old Me**

-Don't fall into comfortability 

-Don't ever be content 

All the people around you, they never broke out of their fear of the unknown. They got stuck doing something they didn't like, or disliked that they never moved forward from where they were.  Instead of working towards what they wanted. They formed bitterness. They tried to justify the fact they were not doing what they wanted or were where they wanted to be. Feeding themselves with instant gratification due to the lack of it in their lives. 

 That's why I never want you to do what's easy. I don't want you to fall into the same pattern so many people have for so long.  You have so much time, You can shape any skill, into the sharpest blade possible. It just takes 2 things. 

-Find something you want, love, and see yourself doing. Get obsessed, get a smirk on your face when you think about it. 

-Don't the people and things around you that pull you away from that thing distract you too long.


I  can't wait to see all the amazing things when your future


- **End Letter** -









People genuinely do feel the same complex, deep, and heart stabbing emotions. They just never learned how to express it. Ontop of that, being afraid too since it steps outside that realm of safety and familiarity. What you did. Putting it all out there is a great first step. 

Goodluck."

cocktails,fe73ayo,t3_eo1won,1578909419.0,"There's always something comparable and high quality towards the lower end. By that I mean that a very good bourbon doesn't have to be more than 40 to $50. And that's for best. While Rittenhouse is around 27 and an excellent option. 

Same as Tequila. While super high quality rums can be like 30!! ... I've touched and priced and tasted numerous in each category. 

*However if you're comparing just the lower end*.
**IE; Between Absolute and nonstore type** 
**Instead of between Absolute and Belvedere Lake**

Go for the Absolute.
 Use fresh Fruit instead of Sour Mix.
Dont skimp if the difference is a a few bucks. 

Youre going to get turpentine, medicinal, pushed out crap. Due to tbe distilleries praying on you to buy them since theyre slightly cheaper. 

Lower prices doesn't mean bad. However you're going to be sorely disappointed going for the cheap. I keep my costs down by drinking less. Which means my few drinks are always amazing!! 

I guess this could apply to anything. 
Hope this helps somewhat!"

*Same with me* 

I've fallen for and maintained relationships where I considered my partner not as attractive! Funny enough, it made it harder to maintain relationships because I was so focused on the personality and actions. On the flip side, I almost married someone who was absolutely beautiful and spoke eloquently. 
*Made a post about it if you wanted to see*
Yet she treated me abusively.. 

*Off track a bit*.

Anyways, there are people who care about the effort put in rather then looks! It makes it easier because you know someone doesn't just like you secondary to your appeal. Simultaneously it makes it harder because you truly have to stand on your own feet because that person really is looking to know you."

You should look at what I just posted. 

Its fuckin brutal 

 But you know what? It's gonna get easier, you can feel pride that you're not being resentful or cruel in your moment of loss.  Your life is going to get better. You're not going to live it for somebody that didn't want you. this might be your moment to have a literal rise of the Phoenix.

 Get obsessed about something, get to work, find purpose.  Come out stronger and beat the odds. 

And good luck"

offmychest,fe0e1ba,t3_enk4lp,1578811438.0,"That kind of insecurity unfortunately is going to stick with him. Trust me I know. Also I've been in a relationship where that was very prevalent in the other person as well. 

 It's hard because you can't just be reassuring, it has to come from him. The only thing you can really do is drive him to feel fulfilled. It's one of the hardest things anybody can go through though. 

 I could also say that you don't necessarily have to, or that it isn't your job to. But I know it's hard when you wanna help somebody that you love.

 My recommendation is that you push him to do things he likes if he gets depressed, or distract him out of self deprecating thoughts."
