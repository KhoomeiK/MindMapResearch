mildlyinfuriating,fdp9bn7,t3_emff56,1578623028.0,With my luck the coffee bottle would shatter on the way down to the bottom for pickup. All that beautiful caffeine - gone.
GetMotivated,fdoln8w,t3_eklhuz,1578607652.0,I went to my first pole class yesterday and made it to the gym today! Inserting fitness into my life 3x a week or more is my goal!
selflove,fdnff8b,t1_fdne8bd,1578584654.0,"Most of my life was spent as a competitive baton twirler, and since moving from my hometown around 10 years ago, I haven’t done anything like it. For the first time in... probably forever I actually feel like my 2020 goals are attainable and real... and the want to move towards them and not make excuses is there. 

Your kind words mean more than you realize. You are an inspiration to me on this journey!"
selflove,fdnbe5p,t1_fdnb5ov,1578582126.0,"That is so inspiring! I struggle feeling comfortable in my body, and I left my first class feeling so so empowered. I am sore but in such a good way! Thank you, your kind words mean so much! I can’t wait to take my next class! 

Part of my 2020 goals now are to not just feel comfortable in my body, but to improve my flexibility by stretching in the morning and night on my own!"

selflove,fdmwh8e,t1_fdmpd8b,1578568996.0,You can do it!!!!
selflove,fdmgtso,t1_fdmg5ye,1578549423.0,"Oh it’s definitely not easy! There were moves I worked on but by the end of the class, I felt so accomplished and could lift myself on the pole! 

You’re not weak! One of my dear friends was giving me some motivation prior to the class and he said “it won’t be perfect the first time. Just know that. But if you keep it up, you’ll get better. Like anything else.”"
corgi,fdmfptf,t3_em282e,1578548377.0,"I think all corgis are odd, lol! What a cute pup!"
selflove,fdmfnzn,t1_fdmf9zk,1578548330.0,You can do it! The anxiety building up to it was... overwhelming...  but now I’m hooked! Do it for yourself. I know it’s forcing me to be kinder to myself in more ways than one.

poledancing,fdly5a0,t3_em02dt,1578535289.0,"I just went to my first class today! I promise you’ll be much more comfortable once you’re there and warming up! I had an old pair of dance shorts that still fit, and I wore a pair of joggers through the warm up! You’re going to love it!"
poledancing,fdlugoj,t3_elr6k6,1578532769.0,"Thank you all! My first class was fun! Definitely left with a sense of empowerment I didn’t think would be a thing! I can’t wait for my next one! 

Taking the bath advice for sure! Such a good sore!"
