YouShouldKnow,ff5ltxk,t1_ff5e8iv,1579599231.0,"The n is too a soft vowel, plus only one syllable. Not a strong alternative. Quebec works perfectly well."
YouShouldKnow,ff5lqvl,t1_ff511rf,1579599100.0,"Probably because it's a simple word that can be spoken clearly, pronounced ""kaybeck"" typically."
YouShouldKnow,ff5lmj0,t1_ff58cmi,1579598915.0,These words were chosen because they aren't typically confused for other words if the connection is poor. None of them rhyme or otherwise sound like each other. They have open vowels and few stacked consonants that can make things sound muddy.

AskWomenOver30,fdn406a,t1_fdmzdlq,1578576629.0,... it's a bit early. I'm probably getting fired today and now menopause is on the horizon in my thirties? Too much.
AskWomenOver30,fdloaij,t3_em0yuz,1578528577.0,"Not exactly but the past couple times it's like I suddenly have someone else's period. The timing, the symptoms, the duration, the flow. Everything suddenly different. I'm really annoyed because it's much longer."
MaliciousCompliance,fdj6nhq,t3_elhdz8,1578459938.0,"I love those skittles, though they are not that spicy. It's a slow burn that you don't notice for a few minutes. Even with a mouthful I don't think this is plausible. And it's not like I'm some spice hound, flaming hot cheetos are too hot for me but these skittles I could eat the whole bag. I'm dubious."

YouShouldKnow,fdb4x8h,t1_fd9xl6f,1578253878.0,"The lenses are $15 if you barely need glasses in the first place or if you don't mind enormous coke bottle lenses. The highest index lenses (thinnest) are $85 for those of us with heftier prescriptions. They offer four lenses. The second thinnest is $40 so I get those sometimes if I'm buying a thicker frame, but they are heavier."

masseffect,fc1jxhz,t3_efji8e,1577320987.0,That's why I bought two. One to color and one to remain untarnished. You can make copies but the paper quality is hard to replicate.
funny,fbyeanr,t1_fbxiuo4,1577214731.0,It's the opposite for me. In dreams I run for the joy of it because my body is a well oiled machine. Unlike real life.
