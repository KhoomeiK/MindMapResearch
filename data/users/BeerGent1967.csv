getdisciplined,fc6l81l,t1_fc69tcd,1577483213.0,"Full disclosure, I'm 52. This would suck for my social life as a 20 or 30 something. My job allows me to yack all day and we have Beer Fridays at work. I'm pretty much peopled out when I get home. I do meet people for beers sometimes during the week but it's on Thursdays early right after work as Friday is a lighter workout day. Saturdays is usually our social time. I'm not a tight ass, I love the hell out of beer and bourbon."

After a few months or so I felt so much better and more productive in the mornings, staying up wasn't that important to me. A couple other things that happened along the way, my anxiety dramatically decreased (if I miss a few work outs I feel the difference) and I have a new tribe of friends. Setting that stupid alarm an hour earlier and dragging my ass out of bed changed my life."

I set my alarm an hour earlier than I normally would, get my ass right up with no snooze and head to the gym. My clothes are laid out, everything is set. At first it was just to form a habit, not get in shape or get motivated. A few laps around the track we're fine, I was going for the habit. I still get up at 4:30 am (good gawd) and go. It's a habit I can't shake. That was three years ago. I now spend 45 minutes to an hour there. Either by myself or in a class or working out with friends. It helps clear my head and gets me moving. I get back, shower and I'm ready for a killer day. Get the f out of my way, I have shit to do. I'm one motivated MFer. Best morning move ever."

Why cut that awesome time of solitude, singing and self reflection short? Kick on a pod cast if you're feeling weird about it, or better yet replace some real shitty time wasters with your very important me time. Live goddamnit! LIVE!!"
