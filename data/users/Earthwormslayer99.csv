Murray had 69 solo tackles, 102 total, and 2 sacks this year and 7 tackles before going down about halfway through the first quarter. 

Perkins had 28 solo, 38 total, and 6 sacks, and a forced fumble before getting suspended. 

Turner-yell had 60 solo, 75 total, and a forced fumble before getting injured like a few days before the game. 

Radley-Hiles had 33 solo, 46 total, a forced fumble, a fumble recover, and 2 interceptions. 

Between the 4 of them, we're talking 189 solo tackles and 261 total, 8 sacks, and 3 forced fumbles, and 2 interceptions leading up to the game. They were absolutely the workhorses of the defense and without them we never stood chance.

Too many people don't factor time into it. Yeah, I can do a LOT on my weekends. But that's *my* weekends. I want to do things I want to do.

But people look at it being a 10 hour job and applying their free time to it, instead of ""this guy is working a job"" time to it. You want something done while you're at work, you're paying the equivalent salary for that time frame. Want it done on a weekend, you're paying what you would want to be paid to come in on a Saturday. 

If I can sacrifice free time to do it, I'll do it. But if it's time sensitive, I'll just contract it out to the break even point of my pay plus my time off.

I need jack stands for my truck because the suspension travel is significant and I need to lift it 7 or 8 inches before the tire is actually off the ground enough to slide it out. I don't like lifting from the differential or anything like that. Just straight on the tube frame. 

For a tire rotation though you need to do either one side at a time (for directional treads) or the entire thing, since the actual rotation part is moving the ones on the front to the back, and vice versa. For directional tread tires, they can only go on a certain side. So the front driver side gets swapped with the rear driver side, and same for the passenger side. You can just jack up one side for this and then do the other side. 

For non-directional treads, you typically cross a couple of them. I do the simple X, where the tires move from front to back, and swap sides. So front driver gets put on rear passenger and rear passenger on the front drive, and so on for the other two. Crossing them needs the whole thing off the ground at once, because you need one of the front off the ground, the rear on the other side. 

Rear wheel and 4 wheel drives can do the X or a rearward cross, where the rear tires just move straight up (rear driver moves to front driver), and the front tires move to the rear and swap. Front wheel  drives can do the forward cross, where the front move straight back and the rear tires swap going forward, or X.

GP means ""general practitioner"", which is exactly what your Primary care physician is. General practitioner means they focus on general health issues, not specialties like oncology, dermatology, etc. They might have seen something like it before, but for anything outside of the general health realm, they will refer you out to a specialist."

My brother played with the current OU center when they were in school in Shawnee OK, and being ran into the dirt was the norm. In 110 degree heat in the summer in Oklahoma. Trainers and medical staff should have caught it though and done their proper cooling procedures. It's what they're paid to do. The head coach should have intervened if they were not doing what they should have. The buck stops with him.
