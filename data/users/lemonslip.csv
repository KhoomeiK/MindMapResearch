depression,fg31ov9,t1_fg30ajf,1580466211.0,"Hi so your understanding of SSRIs are very flawed.
SSRI - serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Doesn’t increase serotonin, just prevents it from being broken down. That’s why it take at least a weeks prescription to actually start having increased serotonin levels.

I agree that meds on their own don’t work, but a 2014 study shows that taking a holistic approach to mental health disorders (combining meds with therapy) has a marked improvement in mental health.

So yes we don’t know exactly why this is the case, but there is definitely a chemical imbalance aspect to depression. The reason why we have an imbalance can be due a multitude of factors, such as trauma or genetics. Some people even experience psychosomatic symptoms. 

So to say that the association with depression and chemical imbalance is a myth is straight up wrong, and could actually be dangerous since it will stop people seeking proper help.
