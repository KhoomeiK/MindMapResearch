fatlogic,ffotilm,t1_ffl8tlc,1580081590.0,"My uncle had a similar problem after surgery. He was thin as a rail, couldn’t stand for more than a few minutes at a time, ended up with all kinds of recurring infections because his body just didn’t have the energy to fight it off. He passed away from complications of it a few years ago. No one was ever looking at him and going “oh, you look so thin and healthy!”"
Weddingsunder10k,ffis8xl,t3_etsgy4,1579981423.0,"BBQ is a great crowd pleaser and most BBQ joints will be able to cater that kind of crowd cheaply and with no problems. The only downside is it can be hard to cater to vegetarians with a BBQ menu, but it sounds like that’s not a huge issue for you."

NoStupidQuestions,ffin2rq,t1_ffii5y5,1579977822.0,"Water births are an actual thing done by medical professionals, usually in a tub of warm, shallow water. The theory behind it is that it reduces stress on mother and child and reduces possible complications, though there have been no formal studies on it as of yet. There are certainly risks involved and yes, babies have died from the process for a number of reasons."
weddingplanning,ffgag4e,t1_fffwocg,1579901942.0,"For this reason, I plan to do most of my RSPVs online, but send physical cards to the handful of older relatives that don’t have computers or a good grasp on technology. I’d rather send the cards and spend the little extra money than have our older relatives get confused by the website and not RSVP."
fatlogic,fffsppp,t1_fffqtrt,1579890968.0,"So when I was in school, the district changed it so that students had to take a full semester of PE a year, every year. Of course, to accommodate this radical scheduling change, that mean other classes would have to be cut back on. So to add more PE, they cut home ec to a six week course, heath class was integrated into PE as a short course, art and music classes were mostly eliminated, career education removed. But, you know. Gotta keep those test scores up."

fatlogic,ff3jevz,t1_ff3f80a,1579542318.0,"I mean, I can see these people buying into something like Noom (because despite what they say, they really do want to lose weight if it was made easy), try it for a few months but not see the radical 50 pound change they were hoping for, then go hunting for reasons to validate that their failure is not reeeeeally their fault. Find a blog post or two about “starvation mode” and “metabolism” and boom! Their beliefs about all diets are now backed up by “science,” and the fact that they won’t stick with a diet is no longer their fault."

Columbus,fdr7h9x,t3_emsv1x,1578680591.0,"We pretty much just go once a year or so to see the traveling exhibits without kids around, since there isn’t that much of a price difference from going during the day. (The ones that include admission to the traveling exhibits that normally cost extra are definitely worth it.) We always get dinner before hand and don’t get any drinks while we’re there. The extra activities usually aren’t interesting enough to warrant their own trip, though to their credit there have been some that really do enhance the exhibits."

weddingplanning,fdeyt7d,t1_fde77eu,1578349495.0,"She may be young, but that doesn’t mean she doesn’t have the agency to decide whether or not she wants to be in the wedding. This isn’t like eating your green beans or brushing your teeth- it’s not something to push her to get over. She has decided she’s uncomfortable with being a flower girl. She’s not trying to hurt you specifically, she’s just a little person learning how she wants to interact with the world on her own terms. I’d say tell her she doesn’t have to be in the wedding now, but leave the door open if she changes her mind later. It’s possible she’s just testing boundaries, but it’s also possible she’s uncomfortable with it as she grows older."

No siblings and I’ve only met FH’s sisters once. No bridesmaids, no bachelorette, no bridal shower. I went dress shopping by myself. Most of my “friends” are just my fiancé’s friends, and while I’m slowly building up my own friends it’s a very slow process and I’m just not close to anyone. It does make it a very lonely process."
