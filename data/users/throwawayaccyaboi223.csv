My great grandpa was a fighter pilot so never flew the IL-2 but I'm definitely jealous of how he got to see technology developing so rapidly. Like he started out on a biplane, ended the war with a really advanced (for the time) prop plane and then went to fly jets. Heck he even got to appreciate the invention of ejection seats after I (about 10 or 11 at the time) asked how they got out of damaged planes and he explained how he had to climb out and jump. He said he was really glad they invented the ejector seat.

I miss you great grandpa. He passed away in 2013. One of my favourite stories is how he pissed off some generals so supposedly didnt get promoted, instead leaving as a full colonel, not general. I loved all his stories, no matter if he embellished them a little for me."
