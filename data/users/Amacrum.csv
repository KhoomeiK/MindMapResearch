AskReddit,ffacolw,t3_esj7av,1579732429.0,"When I overheard the Doctor say they found an unknown mass on the CT of my toddler's brain.  We were in the ER because he'd fallen and grazed his head on the sidewalk and I was overprotective mom. He was singing and charming everyone in the ER.  The Dr loudly made the call with the news to the nearest pediatric hospital. I think because he couldn't bear to break the news to our face so it would somehow be better if we took the brunt of it overhearing it?? Shit move but he's human. 
 This was a week after my husband had been misdiagnosed with a disorder that would mean he had months to live. So we thought he was dying. 
And we had just lost a pregnancy. 
That kind of fear lives with you. 
But 11 years later, the kiddo is mostly healthy and sprouting peach fuzz mustache and my husband is not dead and properly diagnosed. 
Things are good. That fear though. It just becomes a part of you."

Some had Rx from vet for zofran but we had one poor fella who just was so traumatized he threw up and was miserable if you drive him a half mile. Benadryl dosing at appropriate times and he was ok all the way to New York. I will never forget the misery in his face the first time we discovered he was carsick lol

Don't light this fire in your family. Honestly nobody has a 'right' to know this info except your mom and dad.

That's all this boils down to I think.  Taking him from school without either biological parent knowing is honestly the biggest thing. They didn't really know where their child was. And doing things like scheduling sports and a huge party, the ultimate responsibility for all of that falls on them. You sound like a lovely person but when you're a parent there are a thousand different Dynamics you're thinking of all the time in how to keep your kid happy and balanced and you kinda just swooped in a created a (admittedly awesome) shit show. Be the bigger person here and sit down with both parents and explain your motivations and that you overstepped but explain that you adore him and you want to be able to be the person he can come to. That you just wanted to help him and went overboard and that in future you can all figure out a good way to be there for him together. He has three adults who cares and that's pretty great."

It's about the person you love, not the package they come in.

He deserves a hundred percent of you in the relationship and if you're constantly thinking that you'd maybe rather be with a woman you owe it to the both of you to give it a shot. And bravo on being yourself! However it isn't your duty to tell the world you're bi, that's personal and it's yours to share or not. You do have that choice.

AmItheAsshole,feizayh,t3_epegld,1579151484.0,"Yeah YTA.  It's not your house. Don't treat it like shit. Get your own place and trash it but if someone is letting you stay in their home you respect it. You're an adult, she doesn't have to let you stay.  She is. Out of kindness. And you shat on it. The fact that it's the home of someone you love who loves you makes it worse. If she said she wants it a certain way you do it because it's her house and she's letting you crash for free.  It's the literal least you can do, aside from what you were doing."

AskReddit,feixc2v,t3_epea3t,1579149802.0,He has no idea he makes a grimace when I'm about to fuck up (I really suck at it/not super competitive)  so I know not to do what I'm thinking about doing. He honestly has no idea he does it and it's sweet because he's been doing it for most games for over fifteen years (even though he IS competitive) because he loves me and cares if I flush all my fake money down the toilet. He's a good man.
UnsentLetters,feiwrka,t3_epeb6q,1579149336.0,Magic.  Stay strong.
