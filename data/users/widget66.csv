What you call ""securing the market"" is called monopolizing and is illegal because of anti-competitive practices of the era.

The practice of selling products at a loss in order to starve competition out of the market only to raise prices once a monopoly is achieved is certainly not a myth. It is called predatory pricing. Predatory pricing was outlawed in reaction to Carnegie and other robber barons using the practice to eliminate competition with the goal of eliminating natural price controls of free market which allow the monopolies to dictate prices and quality of goods since there is no longer any alternative.

There is a sense that Atlanta over much of the last 70 years has not been built and designed to be used by Atlantans, but rather built to be accessed by suburbanites who come for work or entertainment.

This suburban first urban development results in urban spaces that are less accessible to people without cars, division between once connected neighborhoods, and ultimately less thriving street life.

In my experience it’s a rivalry that riles up ITP types and that OTP people either don’t take seriously or unaware of altogether. It’s not because ITP people are petty though

If I worked 9-5 inside your home and turned your bedroom into a garage, it’s not unreasonable for me to think I live there since I do spend so much time there so from my perspective, you and I are in the same boat, but it’s also not unreasonable for you to be pissed as hell that I have the audacity to completely redesign your home without consideration to the people who live there and then claim the same cultural identity.

Also OTP areas often don’t have a strong neighborhood identity, which is not uncommon for suburbs in general, and results in many of them primarily identifying as Atlantans, since after all, they do spend much of there time in Atlanta and Atlanta is designed for them. This drives ITP people up the wall and is where lots of the snobbery is introduced.

Add on the fact that there is a defined perimeter around the city really helps solidify the this side that side mentality and give a name to it.



This sort of one way cultural divide is not totally unique to Atlanta. Most people I know in NYC look down on New Jersey, but the people I know who live in New Jersey and commute to NYC more or less consider themselves New Yorkers (which drives New Yorkers up a wall). That’s obviously a famous example, but I was talking to a few people from Seattle and one member of the group kept correcting the other people when they said they were from Seattle and basically made them say the suburb they lived in. Whereas me, having only visited Seattle and not being familiar with the suburbs, am fine with lumping the whole metropolitan area into a single entity."

If anything, I would posit the prevalent 1970's and 1980's architecture of downtown is far more destructive and divisive to the city when compared to the historic turn of the century Atlanta. The predominantly 1970's and 80's architecture of downtown effectively turned the neighborhood into a place for cars to visit from the suburbs rather than anything useful to people living in Atlanta.

Now pedestrians are brutally separated from the suburban commuter. The street is starved of economy as its primary purpose was shifted from storefronts to high speed limit low density streets running between buildings with long empty concrete street facades and parking decks.

The hotels, convention halls, and office buildings are insulated from the pedestrian hostile environment they create by raised air conditioned and heated sky bridges that safely carry their precious suburbanites back to their cars parked in massive block killer parking decks so they can race down one way streets onto the 16 lane highway to whisk them away to their suburban homes without ever setting foot on the street or interacting with the city.

This fails to mention the technicians they had on site in every single death camp to operate the machines and track the mass killings or the fact that the punch cards were specially suited to the task of holocaust tracking or the fact that they used pass through companies to administer the operation from New York.

They didn’t just sell some desktops that got misused by other people. IBM staffed the death camps in order to track the holocaust on behalf of the nazis."

Large fixed wing aircraft are incredibly stable even in adverse conditions. These are statistically one of the safest ways to travel. Lots of regulation helps too. They also have a very high cruising altitude which generally makes a smoother flight.

Small fixed wing (Cessna’s to private jets) are generally small enough where adverse weather poses a real risk. This is one of the reasons you hear about celebrities going down in plane crashes more often. Small aircraft fly lower and get tossed around on the wind more.

Helicopters have all the downsides of small fixed wing and the edged downside of additional mechanical complexity. Engine failure in a helicopter is not quite as dangerous as most people realize though. Many people imagine a helicopter without power simply falling out of the sky when in fact they are able to glide to a landing. Small 2 seat helicopters are still unstable though and are notorious for killing well to do people. This was not one of those helicopters, but I don’t want to join in on the speculation prior to a report coming out."
