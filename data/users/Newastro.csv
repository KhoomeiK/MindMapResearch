SuicideWatch,feopcwq,t1_fenj4el,1579303440.0,"Well, first of all thank you for commenting on my post. It means a lot that you took the time to type out your comment, I found it quite helpful.

I guess I find myself experiencing two ends of the emotional spectrum. Sometimes I feel happy - this is usually when I’m socialising in college. But outside of that when I’m at home I fall into a depressive cycle and I experience the other extreme end of the emotional spectrum.

I fall into a pit of depression at home because I feel so isolated. It’s just me and my thoughts. And this combination doesn’t end well. And it doesn’t help that I have exams to prepare for that are coming up. I therefore find it extremely difficult to revise for those. I can revise fine when I’m not depressed. But it’s rare that I’m not sad when at home.

In general I just struggle getting things done at home, I don’t feel comfortable approaching my parents, I don’t eat that much at all, too anxious to go outside, too depressed to do anything really. I can’t find the willpower to just even force myself to do something which I know that I need to do. Or do something like just go for a walk to get out of the depressive environment.

The depression is worst when I’m off on a break from college. That’s when the depression really kicks in and I don’t do anything except wake up, wait for the day to pass, sleep, etc.

I should also mention that I’m experiencing a bereavement at the moment and I’m really upset about that."
