Cycles too fast... Most episodes last days to weeks, not minutes.  I would put money on drugs.  Probably meth.  Ask yourself how well you actually know her."

The truth is that it takes time.  You just have to learn things as they come up.  Life is 85% suffering.. for me at least.  You never learn everything you want cuz you spend 2/3 of your life doing not what you want (work/sleep).  The rest of the time you have you spend trying to survive.  I sat down and broke everything into categories.  The emphasis, or goal was to maintain independence.  You have finances, health, relationships, transportation, housing, food, career; all these different things you have to worry about.  Do this yourself... stay organized.  Make a budget and stick to it.  Schedule your time wisely. Learn to be comfortable being uncomfortable. Accept the fact that life is a cruel joke and it's not really yours.  Be thankful that you're alive by spend what little free time you have enjoying whatever brings you the most joy.  That's what I've learned in my journeys so far.  Hopefully that helps in some way.  Good luck"
bipolar,fdeocik,t3_ekyns3,1578343239.0,I freaking hate anxiety.  I know how you're feeling cuz I've been that way the last couple days too.
bipolar,fdenvoy,t3_ekxk6u,1578342963.0,"When I'm hypo i get irritable, isolate myself, anxiety, and can't sleep or no appetite.  Its different for everyone and is on a scale of severity if that makes sense.  You can have a light mixed episode and a heavy ass depressed episode followed by normal for 2 weeks.  I still haven't figured mine out completely after a year of honest effort.  If you think you have bipolar you'll go in there and tell them you think you're bipolar and they'll diagnose you bipolar; that's just how it works. Your diagnosis is 100% based on what you tell them."

bipolar,fd2la2n,t1_fczztqh,1578148828.0,"Yeah, coaching, resume building, interview techniques, they gave me money for clothes and gas etc.  Pretty insane.  I'm assuming if they can't place you they'll vouch for you at a disability hearing.  Worth looking into"

bipolar,fcw2utk,t3_ej7meu,1578015864.0,"Flirting and attraction is a high.  We tend to seek out highs when we're having an episode.  Low self esteem, apathy, feeling alone, crying; all sounds like depression.   Being validated, receiving attention, feeling needed, sex etc are all things that alleviate symptoms.  You get all that and more from the dating app.  I'm guilty of doing the same thing... I've dropped money on memberships and everything lol."

Its a great opportunity to be able to witness some of your own behaviors from an outside perspective.  Eg: when she gets depressed and mopes around it's totally obvious to you, but to her it might not be.  My ex would always threaten suicide to get her way and it made me realize how childish that really is.  You'll have fun.  Good luck

Oh, I ended up in the hospital because i found out she was cheating on me and lost my shit.  Some bipolar have a hard time with faithfulness.  Hopefully you found a good one."

I look and then I'm done; no staring.  Eye contact when conversing.  I had to practice eye contact because it was so uncomfortable.  I think you can apply the same principle.  Practice eye contact only.  Limit the amount of time you spend looking at their body.  Keep it in your mind and practice everyday.  Good luck"
bipolar,fcloh7w,t3_ehtyln,1577752616.0,Its a struggle.  Lots of work involved.  Even more self control.  Lots of mistakes.  You'll figure it all out.  Therapy is important because it teaches you all the answers you're looking for.  Meds fix the chemical imbalance.

Slept around a lot; did some drugs.  Got a 3.8gpa in college.. threw it all away for girlfriends.  Only had 3 girlfriends, but I've had at least 20 different homes in my life (32), including homeless.  It was a distaster to say the least.  It didn't present until i was 22 and i went misdiagnosed for 9 years.  They said major depression and put me on anti depressants which made me worse.   Hope that helps
