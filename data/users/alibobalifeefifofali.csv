I don't care if the movie was ""diReCteD TOwARdS oUR Age GRoUp"", it's a friggin animated movie! With a story line kids can enjoy! Made by a family friendly company! Go to a midnight showing if you really want to watch your kids movie in peace."
AskReddit,ffbmyj5,t3_esc8vq,1579773419.0,"We would spend the day playing with my one year old daughter and dog. We'd just sit on the floor, drink Pepsi, and talk, maybe we'd take them both for a walk depending on the weather. I'd introduce her to printmaking a little sooner so she could master it more by the time she gets to be my current age. Then we'd do art while the baby napped and we would talk about how much she's going to love taking every single art class offered in high school, and how amazing her art teachers were going to be. I'd tell her to save her money a little bit better. And to maybe not be so annoying to get attention from her friends. I'd make her dinner when my husband got home from work and we would all eat together. I'd let her ask me all the hard questions and vent about my mom while I just sat and listened. I'd want to show her what every day is like for me, because I feel like I'm living my dream and I'd want her to feel at peace with that. That even though life is kind of hard now, and will get worse for a little bit, someday she will feel the same peace I get to feel every day knowing that I'm doing what I love with the people (and dog) I love most of all."
ScienceParents,ffblgvj,t1_ffbkg91,1579771130.0,"Totally agree. If something is currently going around I would err on the side of caution. You could probably contact your local pediatric office or scower the internet to see if anything is going around. But I agree that if your children are all vaccinated and healthy then it won't hurt to invite them. If there are families with young children that can't be vaccinated yet that will be there as well, you might as well give them a heads up, or just announce that if your child is feeling ill, per common courtesy please keep them home from the party. But not being vaccinated isn't a reason to alienate someone (as much as I agree that you should be cautious and always vaccinate your kids that aren't immunocompromised)."
