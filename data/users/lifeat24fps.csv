politics,ff25ic2,t1_ff257vs,1579494377.0,A universal healthcare system that covers 350 million+ people is absolutely going to need people with the knowledge and experience of managing a massive healthcare provider network and the infrastructure it requires. The people with that experience work for our for-profit insurance companies. They will absolutely have jobs.

science,ff0mwdt,t1_ff0flja,1579470374.0,"Could be. This played out to an extent at the end of the Gilded Age, with luxury housing being broken into smaller units. You see this a lot in NYC with some of the oddball apartment configurations we have. But that also came along with a general decline in the overall living standard that didn’t reverse itself until the last 2 decades."

Economics,fetn0if,t1_fet40sc,1579377026.0,I feel that automated ordering in fast food is only going to increase the need for back of house labor. If a kiosk can take more orders per hour on a human that is.
politics,feljci4,t1_felj4zv,1579223567.0,They don’t care. They’re all getting loaded from this stuff. So what if they’ll never work in government again. They’ll be leeching their way through the right wing mediascape for decades to come.

politics,fdrty3y,t3_emrr3m,1578689613.0,"We’ve heard this for 40 years. In the 80s we heard the same nonsense about Iran while we were also selling them missiles. Wanna guess what AG helped sweep that under the rug?

Meanwhile the only middle eastern country who’s citizens ever attacked us on our own soil remains Our Good Friends The Saudis.

Iran is a scapegoat for Saudi funded terror. Always has been. Always will be."

politics,fd44h2c,t1_fd3whay,1578164355.0,"Highly inappropriate. So let’s build on the MAGA people attacking the Iranian embassy here - a highly unlikely scenario but let’s go with that. What should Iran’s response be to non-state actors attacking its embassy, which is the same thing that’s happened in Iraq. These are non-state actors committing an act of violence and we have no proof that it was ordered by or orchestrated by Iran and it’s military. 

If our military, on the orders of our commander in Chief, attacked the Iranian embassy you might have an act of war on your hands. Should Iran consider it an act of war if the dopey ass Bundy militia guys attacked its embassy? Probably not."

politics,fd3byj5,t1_fd36zt7,1578156792.0,Was the US embassy in a dangerous and unstable country? Is this not one of the inherent risks of operating an embassy in a country that’s still effectively under civil war? Have we ever come to the brink of a hot war over an embassy before? Would you like us to engage in a hot war over a building in an unstable country?
politics,fd3bc1r,t1_fd376hy,1578156573.0,"That’s nice. Let’s not forget that we’ve had embassies attacked in unstable countries and dangerous regions of the worlds before. We have never gone to war over that because it’s understood to be one of the inherent risks of operating an embassy. We had attacks under Carter, Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Obama. We do not go to war over events like this.

This is not a black & white, you crossed my line kind of issue. World diplomacy requires nuance, patience, and a level head - NONE of which is demonstrated by this WH."
politics,fczae97,t1_fcza8lb,1578096924.0,Not even St.  Ronald Reagan started a hot war over embassy attacks.

politics,fca1wnl,t1_fc9yui5,1577561783.0,Because you need to spend your way out of recession. There absolutely no reason for the Republicans to be slashing taxes and blowing up the deficit if we are living in “the greatest economy ever”.
