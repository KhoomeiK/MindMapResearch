Yeah there actually is, I think it lets them move near them every turn or something. It will you tell you when you inspect them, these ones actually make the worst pets because they can't use that ability anymore.

I don't know what point your trying to make here, all the reasoning your giving requires the cops to essentially come in guns blazing. Literally every reason you've given requires reckless use of firearms. 

Missed shot, means they didn't have a clear shot and fired anyways. Over-penetrated means they shot despite not having a clear backstop and didn't know what was behind it. A ricochet or fragment also likely means they were firing off recklessly because they likely didn't have a clear shot but fired anyways.

>No. We don't. It's YOUR OWN BIAS in thinking the police just gunned down a toddler.

Once again I never said gunned down, that's you putting words in my mouth. I said they shot a toddler when they came in guns blazing. Gunning down a toddler means it was intentional which I never asserted was the case. 

I don't think the cops would intentionally shoot a toddler, like you are somehow insisting I am. I'm only saying the cops came in recklessly didn't announce themselves and started firing.

It could be justified but it's unlikely. If the cops didn't announce themselves it doesn't really matter what he had in his hands, or what he was doing with them even if it was a gun.

To explain how this does not matter, let's look at a hypothetical situation of a robber breaking into someone's home, then shooting and killing the person who lived there. But it turns out the homeowner who was shot actually had cancer and only had a week to live. Yes the homeowner was going to die anyway, but the robber who shot him still committed murder. So again, just because the levee was going to break anyway does not mitigate the crime that was committed.

Terrible analogy, absolutely terrible because there is no way to determine if he sabotaged the levee or not. Moving sandbags around isn't sabotage and it was something everyone working on a levee would be doing. 

>Next we go into this whole ""he could not sabotage the levee without dying"". This is a wild leap to make, and no one, not even the person who made this claim, can actually say with any certainty this is true

The water was had so much force that when it did breach it smashed a barge into a gas station causing an explosion. It's an extremely reasonable assumption to make, far more reasonable than he was able to intentionally and perfectly sabotage something he barely understood and escape with his life. 

> A person could weaken a section of the levee that would allow a catastrophic break to happen at a later time. That could be done without the person dying.

A single person couldn't do this, also that is why the levee broke and it was because they thinning out the levee to make it taller. It required large heavy machinery to do as well. You can't make the claim that one person could strategically weaken a small part of the levee enough for it to become completely destroyed, when what they were already doing to the levee was weakening it's entire structure. 

It's extremely unlikely that he had the knowledge and the ability to do that.

>What I honestly believe is that James Scott did not really know what he was doing. He is not an engineer, he did not do any kind of surgical demolition to ensure a levee would break.

This is beyond absurd to believe, moving sand bags literally can't be used as a reason he's guilty unless everyone who was there is also guilty. Unless you can absolutely determine that him moving the sandbags was intentionally planned by him with the goal of breaching the levee. 

You cannot prove that, and there is plenty of reasonable doubt that he didn't do it.

If you are actually on the fence about this, you are objectively a moron. ONE PERSON cannot bring down a levee by moving sandbags around and allegedly cutting a tarp, even if that was his goal he couldn't accomplish it.

This doesn't change anything, if he sabotaged it he would've died Experts said it was going to breach regardless of what happened.

Cops couldn't keep their story straight either throughout this, and their idea of what happened is impossible to do the physical limitations of reality. 

>During those questionings, he admitted to moving sandbags on the levee.

As many people were doing, that's part of working on a levee you still need to prove he moved those sandbags with the purpose of collapsing the levee. This isn't evidence of anything except that he was working on it.

Burglary is way different than sabotaging a levee, this has nothing to do with anything else. Outside of the fact he was a criminal.

>Multiple witnesses testified that James Scott told them he caused the levee break.

It's pretty common to have witnesses show up and lie for cops especially in a case like this, James claims he never met those witnesses. Also fraudulent witnesses almost always are used this way, some guy comes in and claims the accused told him he caused the levee break.

They always frame as he was bragging, except people don't usually admit to crimes they're on trial for just to brag. 

I'm not buying those witnesses

Don't say things that implies there is the potential of a relationship in the future. It doesn't dissuade guys and often ends up backfiring when you end up dating someone else.

You need to tell him you're not attracted to him and not your type.

What you did before was imply you had a temporary problem, and in his mind if that problem doesn't exist you'd date him.

At the end of the day, there's a good chance you won't be able to have a friendship with him regardless of how this goes. You need to understand that there is no way you can avoid hurting his feelings.

You aren't overreacting his comment was way out in left field, and basically implies that he thinks you might cheat on him with those guys. Otherwise why would he say it, like if you were talking to female coworkers solely because you wanted their attention he probably wouldn't have a problem with that.

He's clearly overly concerned about appearances, and values them above even what you think or what you want to wear.

This line here is just straight bullshit to me, I don't know the guy but don't know many straight men who are ""experts"" on women's fashion. At best he's an expert on what he likes girls wearing or seeing you wear. 

He even included a backhanded insult basically saying you don't know to dress yourself properly. 

The difference between helping your partner look better, and nitpicking their appearance is would another person notice it.

For example, the braid thing no one at the tango class is going to care about how you wear your hair, whether it's in a braid or not and you know that.

However to him based on some idea that braids don't look good with tango he doesn't like it.
