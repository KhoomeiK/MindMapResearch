You don't even know what affirmative action is clearly.

All these things were in place to stop systemic racism.

You know tips, tips were invented by white people so they could give black people less than the minimum wage and have white patreons tip them nothing.

These systems are in place to correct things that have been done to destory an entire segment of the population.  While housing prices were jacked up for colored and lowered for whites.  The blacks were left owning very little and the whites taking most or in many cases all of the property in what is called gentrification.  Whites continue to steal black votes by gerrymandering many states.
