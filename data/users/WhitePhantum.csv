college,ff7zrxc,t1_ff7l09o,1579662285.0,"Yes I do, when I look for specific courses, it has the option to check the professor's information as well. There I can see the courses he or she is teaching and syllabus from current to previous semesters. Usually dating back about 2 or 3 years. I check the syllabus in the past semesters, because the professor isn't really going to change the syllabus for the same course, unless it's a new subject they're teaching. Or you can manually look for courses and their professors like the fellow redditor DeathGripsXO mentioned."
college,ff6v0tw,t3_eryxub,1579635455.0,"Like Mark Twain said, Don't let schooling get in the way of your education. That is what I say, I don't like college in general but I do love to learn. I like to take online courses with some on-campus classes so I can reduce the stress. I check ratemyprofessor to see what the professor is like and most importantly, the syllabus beforehand so I can see if the class has presentation, group work, etc. Especially checking professors syllabus from previous semesters to see what they ask of the class."

By the way, Dooku did catch me as very mysterious in M&A, so I definitely want to read more about him."

I'm that type of person who doesn't spend any more time than I need to be on the campus; I'm in and out. I get you, at least I know other people will take long commutes just as I will."

It's unfortunate but it's a lesson learned here; can't afford a prestigious college then don't go, it's only going to put more pressure on you to succeed. What's more important, a scholarship or your mental health? Do what you have to do, doesn't matter if you'll be behind, as long as you move forward with your education."

HPylori,feh1xg9,t3_ep4fgk,1579107439.0,"I did a whole treatment by opening the capsules and putting it in applesauce, which was 8 capsules, 1 tablet.  Honestly, opening 8 capsules a day was a huge pain."

college,fef4gm2,t1_fef0lfl,1579047954.0,"Well it teaches how to formally speak when it comes to speeches and presentations, not everything has to be in front of a crowd. How many students who take an on-campus class actually get rid of their fears of presenting? most are left traumatized and embarrassed."

This info is based on my preference, I do not endorse other people doing the same without a doctors approval."

I'm actually drinking coffee right now, as a test to see how my stomach reacts after diet changes, medication & probiotics. If I don't get stomach symptoms, then I'm healing great slowly. If I do get symptoms, then I stop the coffee and wait to try in a week."
HPylori,fcz9y1x,t1_fcyjxzs,1578096651.0,"Thank you! I will keep eating healthy so I can recover and hopefully drink coffee later on in life haha. Air fried sweet potato fries sound really good, I will need to try them out soon."

college,fcvvtlg,t3_ej3dps,1578011238.0,"I live off-campus and I thought about getting a meal plan, because I thought the cafeteria was a 24/5 hourly type thing, which is unrealistic. Maybe 12/5 hourly but it wasn't. Only opens for certain hours and most were during class hours."

college,fcbte1l,t3_eh06e6,1577590760.0,Worst thing that can happen is you fall asleep from being terribly tired and forget about the exam.
college,fcbszn8,t3_eh069v,1577590631.0,"You don't want to take the exam at all or you want to take it at a later time?

Unfortunately, I don't think your professor will take your word for it; they will just think you're making up excuses to not take the exam. Best thing you can do is go to your college counseling and see what they can do.

But every college is different, you might still have options. Like: Medically withdrawing, letter from a doctor, college counseling, etc. Also, It doesn't hurt to be honest with your professor and tell them about your depression, maybe they'll be lenient."

college,fc7vmem,t3_egmf35,1577519808.0,"He is definitely going to get caught. That's why he's asking all over reddit about it because he is panicking of what will come next.

Professor will notice the fake email address and ask the other professor about it. Other professor will say he didn't send it and the only suspect left is the student ""Cheap-Act"" because the letter is about himself. He says the email is untraceable but the letter is about him so you're caught. Also, making an excuse about a a jealous kid, no college admin would believe such an idiotic excuse.

No jealous kid would go that far to try to get another student arrested or criminally charged. It's possible but too oddly specific to believe. 

All of the evidence points back to himself, everything. He's going to get kicked out of college for sure."
