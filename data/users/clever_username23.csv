This is what I get from your argument: it is okay to leave some people/thoughts/ideologies out because if we split we can't win. Sometimes people in other countries use this to their advantage. We have too many pressing things to worry about, therefore fixing things is not one of the things we are going to worry about right now.

insanepeoplefacebook,fc5ulgz,t1_fc5ttxp,1577466238.0,">Race ≠ gender ≠ religion

Granted, but they all have a ""default."" ""Man"" has been considered the default in western societies for hundreds of years. Only really in the last hundred years have we even considered women to be fully human. So to call someone ""dude"" is still implying that male is the default setting of people. 

The point of my analogies is that we should all do our best to accept that there are many different types of people and we should change our language to reflect that. IMHO

>Race-based terms are generally considered offensive

At one point they weren't considered offensive. Then we as a society realized that was fucked up. That's my point, just because ""Dude is generally considered non-offensive"" right now, doesn't mean that it isn't, it just means we haven't changed that behavior yet.
