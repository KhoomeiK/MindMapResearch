The issue is us, our modern living in developed 1st world countries. Either we develop ultra-green technology and make corporations use them and not mass pollute, or we all have to start subsistence farming."

You can equip one from your satchel/inventory menu, and then you can select it at any time from the weapon wheel, in the same slot as your binoculars and camera and such. It's not worn visibly, nor is it quicker or more convenient or even useful to do it, but you'll pull the watch out of your pocket, and it'll zoom in and you can inspect it, like when you're cleaning your guns.

It's nice for immersion purposes, but I never really use it. It's cool to have if you play no-hud tho!"

I could see how an udder springing a leak would be disconcerting, but this is something every mammal does. 

Like, including us. Every pregnant woman has stuff they do to prevent this from happening. Nearly any pet who has babies will do it too, if their young don't have at em enough. 

Genuine question. Do you just not really ever consider or associate your food and the way it's acquired, then? Or do you just eat ""food products"".
What do you do when you see traces of the reality of it? Milk with flotilla's of fats. Meat with veins & musculature, or that clearly resembles a body part you can place onto an animal. Oblong vegetables with dirt and growths.  -Etc. Etc."

Even then, you try and touch anything wild though, expect at least a nip. That said, foxes that don't have rabies are shit scared of anything human size, (and they also don't hunt anything very big, but I still wouldn't trust them with a cat), so you're not gonna get attacked by anything you don't provoke, startle or corner. Keep dogs away too. 

And if you are attacked? Go get a rabies shot immediately. Rabies is 100% fatal once you show any symptoms (takes a few days)."
aww,fdjj1l4,t1_fdjcmq9,1578473082.0,"Foxes and badgers, or really anything that size, are the meanest sons of bitches around if they decide to hone in on you. Speedy and vicious little things. They can fuck you up, and it's hard to keep em from getting you. 

A fox at least would be long enough to kick or even keep away with a stick with the right surroundings, but I'd rather fight 3 coyotes than 1 pissed off badger. Or even a fucking rat. If something small is charging you, it's bad."

I distinguish only because some people might get overconfident about their backyard friend and try to just up and pet them. Or worse, bring them inside or let their pets to visit unattended or something. They aren't friendly street dogs, they're wild animals that don't see you as a predator and associate you with food. It's a fun lil visit. Nothing more."
RedDeadOnline,fdjgdmw,t1_fc0nqbn,1578469640.0,"I've found and can consistently do nearly every one, and I was planning on doing a tutorial on them all or something soon, but there's a few that I've only done once or only seen on video. But then, even just the other day I did the one where you boot them backwards before executing them (was using a repeater), and I'd never seen that one before. 

I've seen all the others, even the laying-down one, if it's the knife-stab. My favourite is the pistol executions from the right-side (theirs), where you grab their shoulder and spin them to face you before blasting them. The only ones I know of that I haven't done are the window-throw, and apparently now also the table-smash.

I've also seen ONE grainy video where Arthur's finisher in a random fistfight was to jump up, grab onto an overhanging beam, and then kick a dude in the face. Dunno if it was faked, but it was front page for a bit."

The bolt loses SO much damage, that in sniper range it takes like 4-6 body shots. I just assumed the Carcano's benefit would be making up for that by maintaining damage at long long ranges, as well as accuracy. These scopes suggest the opposite, and go wildly against how I've been using the Bolt."

Ok, yeah for sure, I super wish that was an option. Even using the whistle to attract enemies, which you do in singleplayer missions, or things like using the bow to make sounds at a distance, without just alerting everyone or having no effect."
RedDeadOnline,fdje6qo,t1_fcqkrx2,1578467088.0,"Yeah, hard agree on the tackle thing. It was honestly my biggest gripe with the game when I first started. I melee nearly as often as I shoot, so I've gotten very good at NOT tackling, which is more difficult and finicky than it should ever be. 

Basically, if you're pressing or holding the run button while moving towards someone, you'll do the tackle. Full-stop. But, you can run up to someone and then let go of 'A' (run button) so that you slow to the walk just before when you'd press melee or grab. You can't press it immediately after letting go of the run button, or you'll tackle, but it's not long after, basically as soon as you see your running animation transition. If you wanna be sure, and have no delay, I usually let go of all movement so that my dude skids to a brake and Tokyo-drifts right into melee range of the enemy. 

Also you can hit right trigger while sprinting to do a running shove, and if you're crouching and not at fully crouch-run speed, melee will do a special grab n punch move that's real speedy (doesn't work on players anymore tho, I believe)"
RedDeadOnline,fdjdf30,t1_fcqlini,1578466230.0,"You'd definitely have to shoot both guys first, and then stabby stabby. Though I don't know if you'd have time for that either, and you'd have to make sure he doesn't shove or melee you before you get both and stab him."
PoliticalDiscussion,fdjd3lz,t1_fdja36z,1578465890.0,"Ok but wearing or doing things have meanings and intended meanings and communicate things, so you ABSOLUTELY can ""ironically"" be or do something. 

Wearing a band shirt has a very clearly encoded message, but wearing a bad band's shirt because you hate them is an ironic display of fandom.

It doesn't have to be words or statements, or even linguistic. Things have ""literal"" meanings that aren't literature. 

Even a words meaning predates it's being written into a dictionary. You can ironically use a slang word that only people from your small town know, by going against the agreed upon meaning/use, just as you could with a gesture, tantamount to sign-language. This is the basis for every single literal definition of any word that's ever existed, and it can be given to anything that communicates information. 

I could literally go on about this for an entire thesis paper, and tbh I might, but this is literally my area of study.

Also the dude said *un*ironically, and clearly meant it to convey fully and genuinely being something, unabashedly and without dispute over whether it qualifies."
