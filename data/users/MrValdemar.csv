If anything, if a plague broke out in America and we couldn't contain it, we'd GUARANTEE every other country had outbreaks too.  

We're not going out alone."

They massacred their own people, on camera, drove tanks over the bodies, ground the bodies into pulp, washed the pulp into the sewers with firehoses,  rewrote the official history for their people so that AN ENTIRE YEAR doesn't exist, and pretends it never happened when provided with video proof.

I haven't read ALL the comics, but I don't think Lex Luthor, Magneto, or even Doctor fucking Doom did any of that shit.  

I never claimed it was going to be their ""go to"" option, but forgive me if I'm not completely willing to rule out vaporizing their own people, cuz they've already shown they've got ""comic book villain"" in them."
worldnews,ffimwlm,t1_ffikn3z,1579977706.0,"You have your opinion, I have mine.  I think the party of ""fuck those protesters, drive tanks over them, grind them into a pulp and wash it into the sewer, and then pretend it NEVER happened even when presented with video proof"" wouldn't shy away from ""they can't infect anyone when they don't exist"" and ""The Wuhan virus is a fabrication.  As you can clearly see, there IS no Wuhan.  And, quite frankly, there never was."""

At worst, a lazy troll.  Begone with you."
worldnews,ffi7knj,t1_ffi6y8e,1579967166.0,Incorrect.  He IMPLIED nothing.  He merely made a statement.  YOU inferred from his statement.  I stand by my assessment.

worldnews,ffi1tf2,t1_ffhyuyo,1579962556.0,"I think it's entirely possible that China would nuke their own cities to eradicate the virus if they thought that would work.

Come to think of it, that would be the ultimate power move.  What could any other country threaten them with?  ""You'll bomb us?  Fuck you!  WE bombed us."""
