todayilearned,ffzg1k2,t1_ffzcg9b,1580377260.0,"I spoke on this a bit more in-depth in response to another comment so I won't repeat myself here, but I will say that *eliminating HIV* and *curing cancer* are nowhere near the same thing, and it's very disingenuous to conflate a real practical possibility (that will be stymied or outright stopped, ironically, by the very industry that *made it possible in the first place*) with current progress with something that's presently impractical and borderline *mythological*.

Curing cancer would involve somehow transfiguring the human cellular process into a perfect machine, somehow eliminating transcription errors.  Any technology that could do that *could* be marketed as a cancer cure, but just as easily as *immortality*, which it would, if not immediately, be a very large building block towards.  We're about as far from that as we are from globally sustainable zero-emissions energy or stellar travel.

Eliminating HIV is doable, right now, with the tools on-hand, broad adoption/maintenance, and *time*.  Two or three human generations of time.  But the developers and distributors of those tools have a vested interest in making that long process *interminably* long, or ensuring it stumbles and stops during its gestational stages enough that it never gets on track in the first place.

There's no secret HIV cure ""ThAT bIG PhaRMa dOESn't WanT YuO tO KnOw ABOut""^^^TM lurking around somewhere, but there are existing therapies that render it non-transmissible and would, within a generation of its carriers dying off from old age, effectively render it extinct.

But as long as the therapies are priced out of totally universal reach ($8/month is as out of reach in some places as $1700/month is in the USA) and kept from socialized distribution channels (even if you can afford it, no one's waving handfuls of it in your face the moment you test positive for the disease), and discussion of such subjects quashed mercilessly, our chances of achieving that outcome are vanishingly slim."
todayilearned,ffzfity,t1_ffzcjjc,1580376493.0,"I'm not talking about secret hooded conspirators hiding a secret lab with a big jar of HIV cure sitting in a safe surrounded by lasers.  I'm talking about the idea that the profit motivation that inspires development of broader and more effective treatments is *extremely* threatened by anything that will, long-term, render all the work they've done unprofitable.

They aren't hiding a secret cure, they're just going to obstruct the *elimination of the disease*.  The motivations that got us within spitting distance of the finish line will ensure we idle just short of it as long as possible, if not *eternally* then *indefinitely*.

There are therapies *currently* that reduce viral loads to the point where the disease is neither symptomatic nor transmissible.  Widespread adoption of these therapies would, within a few generations, effectively send HIV the way of smallpox - probably even further along that route since HIV lacks ability to survive dormant or outside of a host in the environment for long enough to make a resurgence, compared to other pathogens.

It is entirely counter to the self-interest which guides any profit-driven enterprise to foster such an outcome.  Treatments of that sort will be kept, regionally, to levels of expense that effect an economic exclusion from universal adoption and application.  Attempts to nationalize and otherwise make plans toward such an end will never get past the discussion phase.

And this absolutely *is* a conspiracy, not in the Alex Jones crop-sprayers-are-making-the-fish-gay sense, but in a sense that pharmaceutical producers, legislators, and, in some nations, the insurance industry, are *conspiring* toward this end.  It's an even easier sell than widespread distribution of addictive painkillers, because all they have to do is *nothing*, and promote *doing nothing*.

Even those who consider themselves unimpeachably ethical are easy to keep on board with that, or at least easy to keep from rocking the boat too hard."

wow,ffxc0sk,t1_ffuo97l,1580322052.0,"I'm guessing this was an experiment in promoting but not producing, getting substantial cost reductions by outsourcing the actual game development to a third-party (probably one of those southeast Asian places that make the endless stream of samey-looking mobile games, this has that same look) and hoping that promises they made during its promotion were delivered by that third-party.

Now that the end product has fallen so far short of those promises, they're hoping by dialing back discussion (or actively quashing criticism, there are *way* too many people parroting the ""the 15-year-old original classic was crap, just look at how much prettier this one that only looks 10 years old is, and developers promise things they never deliver all the time anyhow!"" line) they can squeak by on brand recognition.

And the sad part is, if that *works*, then this exercise will have been a success and will become a herald of things to come from Activision-Blizzard with regards to their core properties.

We're talking impossible versus *also impossible*.

It's as impossible when the encryption is done by a bank supercomputer as done by a dude on pen and paper, although I wouldn't like to be that dude.  Talk about a boring job.

That's why a lot of law enforcement entities are pretty scared by it - the amount of processing power to make it strong enough to be essentially unbreakable by all the combined processing power of all current computers working in tandem for thousands or millions of years is available in pretty much any modern phone, tablet, or for that matter *smart appliance*."

Instead they leveraged the same uncrackable nature of key-based encryption to lock up e-Corp's working data while using heist-style activities to physically destroy any backups.

What they use to ""destroy"" the e-Corp data in that show is the same type of encryption (but destroying the one and only key every time they encrypted something), hence why the guy responsible for fixing it went all R. Budd Dwyer when they were interviewing him about their chances of reversing it.

If they had actually destroyed the keys as-intended the reversal they effected at the end of Season 3 wouldn't have been possible.  Thankfully (though I'm sure Mr. Robot would have felt otherwise had he known at the time) Romero altered the hack to secretly *retain* the keys, making it reversible."

explainlikeimfive,ffhqwri,t3_etm9we,1579949158.0,"Layers upon layers ultimately boiling down to something very simple, is the answer - much as with all technology.  Just like a vehicle ultimately amounts to a large combination of levers, wedges, and wheel-and-axels (fundamentally simple machines) computers ultimately amount to a vast array of on/off switches.

How do they layers unfold?

Firstly, underneath the human-understandable code (high-level language) there's an interpreter (if it's a scripting language) or a compiler (if it's a compiled language).  Some languages get a little fuzzy and operate between those two (Java, I'm looking at you) but either way these tools translate the code into something only readable to assemblers, as well as the subhuman monsters who program in assembly languages.

They're called low-level languages.  Because those that understand them are condemned to the low levels of the earth, dark places out of reach of light and hope where they work their unholy sorcery and periodically release new high-level languages, gaining dark power from the pain and frustration of high-level programmers who have to learn entirely new languages to stay current.

Assembly languages are then passed into the assembler, which further translates the code into *machine languages*, which are binary instructions that amount to complex sequences of on/off switches in enormous (like, we're talking *billions of them*) systems of these switches, logic gates.  The computer (or rather, its processing units) being said unfathomably huge system of on-off switches.

Some people understand machine languages and binary too.  You can usually identify them because of the way their rubbery false skin hangs loose on their metal endoskeletons, or how they refer to you as ""fellow organics"" and repeatedly and *suspicously absent of prompting* deny observing you for weaknesses for when the machines eventually rise.

What do these vast arrays of on/off switches actually do?  Tons of stuff.  They are themselves a complex machine built out of simple machines, and while the same simple on/off instructional principles guide them, the results of their actions trigger actual other machines peppered throughout the apparatus.

One set of instructions will direct action to memory and in turn instruct that memory to store or retrieve or simply *forget* some instructions.  The presence of memory engenders persistence (think of a person with no long-term memory trying to do anything but live out a *noir* detective movie written by Christopher Nolan), so that the computer is more than what it's doing from moment to moment.  That ability to persist in turn engenders a lot of what amounts to ""understanding"" on the part of the computer.

The ability to *process* is actually fairly old (machines doing that have existed for hundreds of years) but the ability to *persist* is what's fueled the information age.  Persistence, *memory*, is kind of a rabbit hole - lots of ways it's done.  We're now actually coming full circle where the longest-term persistence media we employ, which was prior consigned to things like magnetic disks and tape, is just more basic electric memory like the computer's RAM - solid state memory.

But beyond memory, there's the human user factor - another set of instructions might make some lights blink, or eject an optical disk drive, or send signals down a cable to (or listen for signals coming from) something external like a display or keyboard or other link to the physical world and the user.  The user will then respond in some way to, and respond *through*, such input-output media and keep the work going, closing the system.

At the end of the day all these machines are simply ways of adapting and interacting with human processes of cognition and work.  They may seem unfathomable, but they are at their core simple machines, and their processes themselves may seem unfathomable, but they are at their end the effort of another human being propagating through a machine medium."
