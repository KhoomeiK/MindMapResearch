books,ffhx8zn,t1_ffhpuwf,1579957914.0,I wasn’t comparing them. I simply said if you read and liked the Shining you should read Dr Sleep because it is a good sequel to that book written in King’s classic style.
books,ffhdr0h,t3_etfp3z,1579931134.0,I feel his short story collections all deserve credit. Skeleton Crew contains The Mist and also an excellent short story called The Jaunt which would make an excellent Black Mirror episode (IMO). His original collection Night Shift is also very good.
books,ffhdfsn,t1_ffgysmt,1579930804.0,If you read The Shining you should try Dr Sleep when your done with Salem’s Lot. I found it to be very good and reads like classic King.
YouShouldKnow,ffhcu13,t3_etb1wx,1579930192.0,Utility industry is another in this category. I don’t believe field work requires a college degree but pays well. You will work hard but can make really good money.
rareinsults,ffcabbf,t1_ffc38ym,1579795113.0,"There are a whole bunch of wealthy companies and individuals out there that invest in new companies. A million here, 20 million there, etc. A lot of these investments end up getting written off but sometimes they become Facebook. So if you are a smart, charismatic individual with what sounds like a good idea you can definitely find someone that will give you a lot of money. It’s like a scam without repercussions. Now eventually the jig will be up but depending on how good of a bullshitter you are you could string this along for years."
todayilearned,ffb0y1x,t3_esj66b,1579749079.0,"Fun Fact. Frank Gorshin is in an episode of original Star Trek called, “Let this be your last Battlefield.” It’s a really great sci-fi story while at the same time doing a great take on the idiocy of racism and political tribalism. I believe it’s on Netflix. Highly recommended."

atheism,ff7ik8q,t3_ery1ay,1579650378.0,I myself believe in God but I don’t believe in the God the way he is portrayed by the Christian church. The God I believe in is inclusive and kind. Due to this I haven’t been inside a church in years although I often pray. I am just kind to my fellow man and figure the rest will work itself out. Most of the church goers I have encountered are big time hypocrites.

PublicFreakout,ff5p17e,t1_ff5hp8w,1579604092.0,Spent a lot of time in both countries. China definitely the safer place for women. The maturity level of men in regards to respect for women is much higher in China. Probably due to all that stupid arranged marriage nonsense in India.

Also all their bananas are locally grown and taste far inferior to beautiful South American bananas. Sorry Australia but stop protecting your banana industry and import bananas from other countries.

AccidentalRenaissance,ff1y53g,t1_ff1x8wh,1579488859.0,"I don’t know where you got your information but this is not correct. My daughter was born in Australia and I had to provide extensive documentation to prove one of the parents was a permanent resident. This is not granted to every child born in Australia. Definitely not.

EDIT: Australia not Austria"
AccidentalRenaissance,ff1qwrc,t1_ff1pnf6,1579484206.0,They changed the law in 2006. Now requires one of your parents to be a citizen or permanent resident.
AccidentalRenaissance,ff1qu1k,t1_ff1pqjo,1579484156.0,"Not correct. This only applies if one of your parents is a citizen or permanent resident. They changed the law in 2006.

“Children born in New Zealand (or on board a ship or aircraft registered in New Zealand) on or after 1 January 2006 will acquire New Zealand citizenship by birth only if at least one parent is a New Zealand citizen or entitled to be indefinitely in New Zealand (e.g. a resident or permanent resident, including Australian citizens). Children born to a parent who is a permanent resident of the Cook Islands, Niue or Tokelau also qualify.”"
AccidentalRenaissance,ff1omg9,t1_ff1a7js,1579482740.0,"No Japan is one of the most protectionist countries in the world. Actually birth right citizenship is not that common. I lived in Australia for awhile and I know they don’t have it. Pretty sure NZ doesn’t either.

EDIT: just checked. NZ used to have it for everyone but changed law in 2006 to require at least one parent to be a permanent resident. So unlike the US a child born to an illegal alien, student, or temporary worker would not be a citizen automatically."

todayilearned,feoy0ra,t1_feouigt,1579307847.0,I believe his Manifesto was actually published in the New York Times and that was what led his family to recognize the writing. So a lot of people certainly had the opportunity to read it.
todayilearned,fen08xr,t1_femvm1n,1579274054.0,He is legitimately a genius. I mean he operated with impunity for years and they weren’t close to catching him until his family turned him in. If that didn’t happen he might still be running around free today. Common Joe Blow is not going to be able to do that.
todayilearned,femzbar,t1_femy2gs,1579273419.0,I mean right? There are some persuasive arguments there that in the hands of a charismatic leader could have been used to form some sort of anti-technology cult. Instead his solution is to blow up innocent folks who aren’t responsible for any of the things he is concerned about.
todayilearned,femyhd4,t1_femtjco,1579272852.0,I thought the only reason they caught him is his brother turned him in.
