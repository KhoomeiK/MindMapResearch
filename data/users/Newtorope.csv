Having my teacher there to coach me through the bad technique was huge. As time went on the technicalities of singing became second nature, which improved my voice and my confidence.

Having my weekly lesson also forced me to sing in front of someone every week. Someone who genuinely knows what good singing sounds like. They knew I was bad, but it's literally their job to teach me how to get better.  Each lesson is not only giving me quality instruction on how to use my voice better, it's also giving me the confidence to sing more. Yes there is hand holding from a teacher, but more importantly there is constructive criticism of my voice. Just singing in front of my teacher has done wonders for my confidence with my voice. Hell I had enough confidence to plan a karaoke event for my birthday.
