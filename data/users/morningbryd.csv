MadeMeSmile,ffb8t76,t1_ffb7efl,1579755378.0,"I have been paid for what I think it‚Äôs worth to make art/to teach, and I‚Äôve seen people bask in thousands of dollars glory playing with symphonies and simultaneously being truly horrible human beings, lying to their families while they slept around (I worked for the music department at a university for four years.) Trust me, there is a HUGE difference. And those people make it seem truly hollow. They wouldn‚Äôt take time to do stuff like this. Why can‚Äôt it be both? Make music professionally and still be humble enough to be involved with projects like this."

MadeMeSmile,ffb6j1m,t3_esnl26,1579753122.0,I think this is the arts at the least pretentious state. As a musician I enjoy playing at nursing homes the most. No one pays. No one hardly acknowledges. But it‚Äôs the most valuable audience.

FemaleDatingStrategy,ff2w83u,t3_erckwp,1579526508.0," A lot of girls haven‚Äôt believed me, and I get in the middle of both parties being really nasty to me. But you shouldn‚Äôt just tell the truth because you‚Äôll be treated kindly, you should tell the truth because it‚Äôs the right thing. I am genuinely happy I told the truth but it broke a lot of friendships. Now I believe truly that if a guy is cheating on me, someone will also let me know, because karma and all that."

Thanks so much for this positive story :) I feel my mind has been changed somewhat."
BreakUps,fd93rvd,t1_fd6kh5c,1578227964.0,"It has to do with how we feel about ourselves, even if we don‚Äôt want to admit it. When we let things get really, really bad, beyond just loving someone through their dark times and despair, it is really a signal that our sense of self-value isn‚Äôt significant enough, that there is nothing to protect from others. I have loved people that were not good for me but at some point, I acclimated myself to be believing I deserved it. On the contrary, if you begin to believe that you deserve respect and kindness for all the respect and kindness you have given then you will be able to draw better boundary lines. You can love someone and realize they are not healthy enough to be in a relationship."

AskReddit,fd92clh,t1_fd8o9y0,1578227317.0,"I have been around a lot of people like this, who push everyone away and then feel a lot of anger over it and it happens with many people. It‚Äôs a really vicious cycle that usually starts with a traumatic event. She could have also just had different brain chemistry and didn‚Äôt understand or maybe she was on the autism spectrum. I think I have a lot of compassion now because I have reached out to many people like this, I‚Äôm still around people like this. It‚Äôs sad because they are alone, and if they keep acting like that they will continue to be alone. They won‚Äôt be able to have fulfilling relationships that last. A lot of people need serious help with their mental health, like therapy or medication. I‚Äôm sorry you felt so hurt by it. I think that in the end, she will remember your kindness, as many will not even put up with it at all. And lastly... I read somewhere once that understanding that most people lash out for reasons that have absolutely nothing to do with you is really refreshing. She probably tried to make it seem like you deserved it in some way, but it‚Äôs kind of a part of the mental health instability I described. Thanks for sharing :)"
BreakUps,fd6c4hr,t1_fcyfkiz,1578188708.0,"I‚Äôm so sorry, it sounds like she needs a therapist possibly. I hope she can admit that she needs help so she can become a more whole person."
BreakUps,fd6bzv8,t1_fcy0mxl,1578188652.0,"No one can fix anyone. If that person doesn‚Äôt want to change it‚Äôs not going to happen, they never will. And waiting for them to change will suck all the soul out of you. Be with someone humble who tries to work on themselves, that‚Äôs my best advice."

BreakUps,fd5y24j,t3_ek3awd,1578182943.0,Yeah that‚Äôs what it feels like. I‚Äôll be doing amazing and then it will just hurt all over again and it will feel like the wind was knocked out of me and all I want to do is sleep. It really sucks.

I personally have faith but have kind of stepped away from going to church so I completely understand, it‚Äôs taken me a long time to work through it. I have been able to separate what I believe from church people/Sunday morning appointments though, I have more peace now. God doesn‚Äôt live in churches or institutions. When/if I go back I only want to be around those who are wholeheartedly genuine and willing to accept me in my humanity. I hope you don‚Äôt mind that I shared this, I am not trying to get you to change your mind, but I just thought since we were being personal :)"
