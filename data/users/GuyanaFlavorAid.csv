I've also had them sit beside me and work through the same task step by step at their computer with me.

sports,fezuett,t1_feyj78c,1579461786.0,"I cant get over the food specials back then. Just Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday is why we are there 3x a week.

Tuesday: $0.20 wings, self-explanatory. Spend three bucks, get fifteen wings. In today's dollars, those are $0.32 wings. 

Wednesday: $0.50 drumsticks, spun the same way and $1.25 23 oz. Bud and Bud Light. So $0.80 chicken legs and less than $2 for a 23 oz beer. 

Thursday: the crowning insanity, $1 burgers. Add $0.25 for cheese. And $1 pints of miller lite. So two cheeseburgers and a pint, $4 back then and $6.40 now. And the burgers were good. Lettuce, red onion, pepperjack cheese and their hot bbq sauce. 

I took my parents out to eat one thursday. We each got two cheeseburgers and soda, dinner cost for three like.....ten bucks. If.i could have one place back it would be that place with that kinda pricing. Just amazing quality food at rock bottom prices. Godspeed, reasonable eatery."

Then they realized it was stupid and dropped it. Now it's Buffalo Wild Wings. And when I hear people say BDUBS it also makes me rage just because I hate how it sounds.

sports,fexycil,t1_fexwrcs,1579438259.0,"They 100% have. Twenty years ago when I was in undergrad, we had a BW3 on campus. Tuesdays, twenty cent wings. They were good, it was cheap. Even regular price wasnt bad. Then they moved into the whole sports bar demographic. Much pricier, but for a lot of years the quality was still good. Then the last three or four years they want me to pay $15 with a tip for two small things of wings. Small wings, mind you. And several times they havent even come out hot. They're just....meh. If someone else is buying I'll eat a free lunch there but I wont pay to go there anymore. To be perfectly honest, the deli at our Meijer (grocery store)  sells ""spicy gameday wings"" for $6/lb. It's a dry hot wing where the breading is hot, no sauce. You can specify drums or flats, and the wings are huge. The drums are borderline actual drumsticks. If I spent $15 on wings there I would literally carry it out in a bucket and couldnt hope to eat it. The decline in quality and cranked prices at Buffalo Wild Wings really crossed them off my list several years ago. And no, I'm not going to eat there FOR THE ATMOSPHERE AND HEY LOOK TVS. Whoopty doo. Bring me some.wings that are actually piping hot for say, ten bucks and I'll consider it."

explainlikeimfive,fcesfp7,t3_eh1zhc,1577623333.0,"They throw around Diversity and Inclusion at my work all the time. I would say that in a superficial way, a diverse workplace has different races, religions, sexual orientations, etc. An inclusive workplace is one where everybody is respected and included, even if the culture is monolithic. 

What bugs me a little about the whole initiative is that the *real* bottom line on diversity and inclusion as it affects the business operating properly is having *diversity of thought* and making sure that you are inclusive of all the stakeholders in design decisions, financial planning etc. Diversity of ""people"", it doesnt hurt but you dont necessarily need it to have a great team with diversity of *thought*. That idea of diversity of thought doesnt get stressed enough imo. It's like HEY LETS THROUGH SOME RANDOM TOKEN MINORITIES IN HERE AND THE WORLD WILL BE MAGIC. No, no matter where people are coming from, respect that diversity of thought and strive for it. And be inclusive, be respectful. A group of people will always outthink one person (assuming at least normal intelligence) so make sure to capture that power by being incisive amd.working to have diversity of thought in your processes.

You might have field personnel, engineering and financial people all as stakeholders. All with slightly different agendas. Bob the Field Guy wants a.couple key design changes that dont mean shit to engineering or the overall budget, but it they save him hours every time he does a yearly inspection. Jane the Engineer is being really picky about a.couple minor features that dont mean shit to field ops or the overall budget, but she has to do them to comply with new standards Bob doesnt know about. And Cthulu the accountant can support their overall budget but not until the third quarter. Making sure they get their diversity of thought represented in the meeting and have enough inclusiveness to try and build a team solution (no, Cthulu, we cant build it for half the price but we CAN wait until September to start) is the real way to use ""diversity and inclusion"" as a path to victory imo. 

Having that kind of superficial ""diversity"" never hurts, imo, but it's the diversity of thought it can potentially drive that is the real benefit imo."

Tuesday: $0.20 wings, self-explanatory. Spend three bucks, get fifteen wings. In today's dollars, those are $0.32 wings. 

Wednesday: $0.50 drumsticks, spun the same way and $1.25 23 oz. Bud and Bud Light. So $0.80 chicken legs and less than $2 for a 23 oz beer. 

Thursday: the crowning insanity, $1 burgers. Add $0.25 for cheese. And $1 pints of miller lite. So two cheeseburgers and a pint, $4 back then and $6.40 now. And the burgers were good. Lettuce, red onion, pepperjack cheese and their hot bbq sauce. 

I took my parents out to eat one thursday. We each got two cheeseburgers and soda, dinner cost for three like.....ten bucks. If.i could have one place back it would be that place with that kinda pricing. Just amazing quality food at rock bottom prices. Godspeed, reasonable eatery."

Even regular price wasnt bad. Then they moved into the whole sports bar demographic. Much pricier, but for a lot of years the quality was still good. Then the last three or four years they want me to pay $15 with a tip for two small things of wings. Small wings, mind you. And several times they havent even come out hot. They're just....meh. If someone else is buying I'll eat a free lunch there but I wont pay to go there anymore. To be perfectly honest, the deli at our Meijer (grocery store)  sells ""spicy gameday wings"" for $6/lb. It's a dry hot wing where the breading is hot, no sauce. You can specify drums or flats, and the wings are huge. The drums are borderline actual drumsticks. If I spent $15 on wings there I would literally carry it out in a bucket and couldnt hope to eat it. The decline in quality and cranked prices at Buffalo Wild Wings really crossed them off my list several years ago. And no, I'm not going to eat there FOR THE ATMOSPHERE AND HEY LOOK TVS. Whoopty doo.

explainlikeimfive,fcesfp7,t3_eh1zhc,1577623333.0,"They throw around Diversity and Inclusion at my work all the time. I would say that in a superficial way, a diverse workplace has different races, religions, sexual orientations, etc. An inclusive workplace is one where everybody is respected and included, even if the culture is monolithic. 

What bugs me a little about the whole initiative is that the *real* bottom line on diversity and inclusion as it affects the business operating properly is having *diversity of thought* and making sure that you are inclusive of all the stakeholders in design decisions, financial planning etc. Diversity of ""people"", it doesnt hurt but you dont necessarily need it to have a great team with diversity of *thought*. That idea of diversity of thought doesnt get stressed enough imo. It's like HEY LETS THROUGH SOME RANDOM TOKEN MINORITIES IN HERE AND THE WORLD WILL BE MAGIC. No, no matter where people are coming from, respect that diversity of thought and strive for it. And be inclusive, be respectful. A group of people will always outthink one person (assuming at least normal intelligence) so make sure to capture that power by being incisive amd.working to have diversity of thought in your processes.

You might have field personnel, engineering and financial people all as stakeholders. All with slightly different agendas. Bob the Field Guy wants a.couple key design changes that dont mean shit to engineering or the overall budget, but it they save him hours every time he does a yearly inspection. Jane the Engineer is being really picky about a.couple minor features that dont mean shit to field ops or the overall budget, but she has to do them to comply with new standards Bob doesnt know about. And Cthulu the accountant can support their overall budget but not until the third quarter. Making sure they get their diversity of thought represented in the meeting and have enough inclusiveness to try and build a team solution (no, Cthulu, we cant build it for half the price but we CAN wait until September to start) is the real way to use ""diversity and inclusion"" as a path to victory imo. 

Having that kind of superficial ""diversity"" never hurts, imo, but it's the diversity of thought it can potentially drive that is the real benefit imo."
