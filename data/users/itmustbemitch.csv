If the bill can't be split, one person will cover it and the rest will pay them back as accurately as they can. But this turns it into a bit of a hassle for the one who paid and for everyone figuring out their own share, and makes it harder for everyone to tip what they would find appropriate. It's no big deal if the bill can't be split, but it's easier for us and I think generally the total tip would probably end up higher"

Algebra,ffi2j98,t3_etozju,1579963190.0,"/r/learnmath would be a good place for this question also.

I don't actually understand your first question but I think I can address your second one. You're looking at factoring something like x^2 + Bxy + Cy^2, where B and C might be negative. Your answer will look like (x + Dy)(x + Ey) where D and E might be negative.

Factoring is hard, and you should be ready to do a little bit of guessing and checking when you do factoring. That said, the most useful tip imo is that B = D + E and C = D * E. So in your example, B is -2 and C is -80. Since C is negative, only one of D and E will be negative, since if neither or both were negative the product would be positive. Since B is negative, whichever of D and E is bigger must be the negative one.

The other thing is that multiplication is commutative (order doesn't matter), so (x + Dy)(x + Ey) is the same as (x + Ey)(x + Dy). That order doesn't matter at all. 

Hopefully that helps"
