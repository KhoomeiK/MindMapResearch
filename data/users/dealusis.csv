piercing,fdlctcv,t1_fdkzk8b,1578521278.0,"That’s such a weird situation, I’ve never heard of an irritation bump that couldn’t be handled. Perhaps the best thing to do is take it out and see if it goes away? If it’s causing you pain your comfort should take priority over your piercing."
piercing,fdkyuip,t3_elxngb,1578513982.0,"Doesn’t look infected, just irritated. Spray it with saline and keep your hands off! No tugging and rubbing at the crusties."

piercing,fdkyjsh,t3_elxruc,1578513804.0,"Did you go to a piercer about it? No cap they’d probably know a little more about how the body reacts to piercings, they could probably offer you some advice as to whether you’ve developed a metal allergy or irritation, and if the best course of action is taking it out."
piercing,fdkybyc,t3_elxsyu,1578513675.0,Absolutely call your doctors office and ask what the procedure is! That’s the best thing to do before going through the measures to take everything out.

piercing,fdhsj5k,t3_elh1wj,1578429343.0,"Might be worth seeing if you can get them switched to a bar. Hoops tend to move and irritate healing piercings, so that might be your issue."
