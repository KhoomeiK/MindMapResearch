Ding ding. Much bigger issue than foreign investment. The scale of the problem is huge, and access to nearly free money from fed monetary policy (QE, fed funds rate, etc) has created insane demand that would be impossible to satisfy with increased supply alone (IMHO)."

I know UK and Australia have recently come out with research suggesting there is little correlation.

Yeah probably. Who knows 

>I also totally agree that cheap loans fuel this mess.  Part of the mess in 2008 was that all the ARM loans reset and people couldn't pay their mortgages and defaulted, flooding the markets with foreclosed homes.  That said, in SF prices fell from their peaks to MAYBE 2002 levels for about 6 months.  And were back above 2006/7 levels by 2011.
>
>But cheap loans are linked to interest rates, not the housing crisis in California.  I imagine if rates rise to 13%+ like they were in 1980 or so, we will kill the housing market.  But that's not happening anytime soon.


I think that's right. More likely is the opposite though, e.g., rates going closer to zero (some parts of the EU are <1%), based on macro economic policy. That will likely increase demand and prices beyond whatever supply side increases can mitigate. Cue more outrage at housing unaffordability, looser lending standards (lower income qualifications, etc) and prices go even higher. Hooray."
urbanplanning,fdrd3u0,t1_fdpmk5i,1578682790.0,Fascinating. Do you have any suggested sources that analyze the Australian market over time like this?
California_Politics,fdrarkp,t1_fdqz3re,1578681832.0,">implying they could be used for the homeless they also imply they aren't being utilized at all

I don't think that was the intent (but who knows, the article is super short on analysis). Instead, I read this as informing the conversation on homelessness and, by extension, housing affordability. There is a lot of chatter around increasing supply, usually with the underlying assumption that it must inherently lower costs/increase affordability. That's really just one part of the equation, even in short-supply bay area cities.  

From a UK perspective, access to cheap loans likely had a much bigger effect on housing prices than supply constraints. (Note there they looked at increasing vacancy rates from 5% to 10% and modeled a 9% decrease in cost. If SF is already at 10% the added benefit of increased vacancy is likely lower, with greater negative impacts.)

California,fdnx5h9,t1_fdnl2ql,1578594643.0,I'm not even sure adding units will alleviate much. People will pay what they can afford. The price of housing seems to be much closer tied to area income than population.

California,fcmiohg,t1_fcmaamh,1577776841.0,">I think residential rents are going to continue to be determined by the market, and we have a choice of letting the property owners keep all of that, or taking some of it in taxes. *Right now* they're leaving units empty because they can afford to, and scarcity makes their product more valuable. Meaningful property taxes would help ensure that habitable units aren't kept off-market to manipulate prices. 

It would be more effective to use a vacancy tax to address that issue

>Same with commercial properties. They charge what they can get, and will leave units empty for months waiting for the ""right"" tenant. Increasing their costs will increase the urgency they have about getting units occupied, and will also remove some of the disincentive to improve (because the increase to their property taxes won't be so large if they're reassessed).
>

Your point about the disincentive to improve is interesting. For the others, it seems that would only affect extreme examples of commercial real estate held for many decades--I'm not convinced it would be a motivating factor for most. (But, I haven't seen any stats on this, so I'm not sure how big of an issue it might be)

>But I would be totally *fine* with making revenue-generating properties pay their taxes partly as a parcel tax, and partly as a percentage of revenue, so that if they charge less, they pay less.

That's the system we have today. Property tax of 1%, income tax 8.84%. I personally think that's a pretty reasonable balance, as it provides flexibility for changes in the business cycle (as opposed to higher, more stable/consistent property tax)."
