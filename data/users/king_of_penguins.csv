Underneath the putative *p* factor, they break symptoms into 3 broad dimensions: internalizing, externalizing, and psychotic:

>In contrast to the prominence of categorical models in the classification of adult psychopathologies, dimensional models had long enjoyed success in research on the classification of childhood psychopathologies, and empirical studies of children had converged on two primary dimensions as a way to characterize childhood disorders: these were labeled internalizing (including anxious and depressive symptoms) and externalizing (including aggressive, delinquent, and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms). [...]
>
>The empirical model of psychopathology was consequently expanded to accommodate a third dimension, psychotic experiences, indicating liability to experience dissociation, disorganized thoughts, unusual beliefs, fantasies, and hallucinations, with some lingering uncertainty about whether mania, obsessions, and compulsions belong on this spectrum too.

Haven't seen other papers on *p*, but a number of other recent papers on the structure of mental disorder genetics. [1] was published last month: A [Psychiatric Genomics Consortium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_Genomics_Consortium) team gathered a large amount of data, then used [exploratory factor analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_factor_analysis) (EFA), among other techniques, to identify 3 factors:

>EFA identified three correlated factors, which together explained 51% of the genetic variation in the eight neuropsychiatric disorders (Table S2.2). The first factor consisted primarily of disorders characterized by compulsive/perfectionistic behaviors, specifically [anorexia], OCD, and, more weakly, [Tourette Syndrome]. The second factor was characterized by mood and psychotic disorders ([major depression], [bipolar disorder], and [schizophrenia]), and the third factor by three early-onset neurodevelopmental disorders ([autism], ADHD, [Tourette Syndrome]) as well as [major depression].

In the discussion, they suggest there exists 1 group of genetic loci which increases the general risk of mental illness, then other groups that influence which illnesses result:

>Taken together, the analyses presented here suggest that genetic influences on psychiatric disorders comprise at least two general classes of loci. The first comprises a set of genes that confer relatively broad liability to psychiatric disorders by acting on early neurodevelopment and the establishment of brain circuitry. These pleiotropic genes, on average, begin to come online by the second trimester of fetal development and exhibit differentially high expression thereafter. The expression and differentiation of this generalized genetic risk into discrete psychiatric syndromes (e.g., ASD, BIP, AN) may then involve direct and/or interactive effects of additional sets of common and rare loci and environmental factors, possibly mediated by epigenetic effects, that shape phenotypic expression via effects on brain structure/function and behavior.

See also [2] for an overview of the state of this type of research. They don't really get into the details of hypothesized structures, but conclude:

>Over the past decade, the success of large-scale genomic studies has confirmed several key principles: (1) psychiatric disorders are highly polygenic, reflecting the contribution of hundreds to thousands of common variants of small effect and rare (often de novo) SNVs and CNVs; (2) genetic influences on psychopathology commonly transcend the diagnostic boundaries of our clinical DSM nosology. At the level of genetic etiology, there are no sharp boundaries between diagnostic categories or between disorder and normal variation.

Source? Think you've got that flipped. From a 2015 review:^[1]

>[F]or intelligence, heritability increases linearly, from (approximately) 20% in infancy to 40% in
adolescence, and to 60% in adulthood. Some evidence suggests that heritability might increase to as much as 80% in later adulthood but then decline to about 60% after age 80.

The big increase in heritability is during childhood -- that's cognitive growth, not decline. During adulthood heritability is either stable, or rises even further before eventually falling.

Some random estimates of heritability I've found in the past: Height, anxiety, and depression show increases in heritability over time.^[2][3] The heritability of other traits, such as ADHD and personality, appear to be stable over time.^[3][4]

todayilearned,ff3sws4,t1_ff2fg63,1579548147.0,">There were hundreds of cases of infection from blood transfusion out of millions of blood transfusions performed.

As someone already pointed out, those numbers are 2 orders of magnitude too low. (The table you linked wasn't a comprehensive summary of transfusion infections, but rather only those infections that happened to be identified and reported in the CDC's *Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report* from June 1981 thru May 1985.)

>Most of the people affected were those who were getting large numbers of transfusions from large pools of donors, most specifically hemophiliacs. But of the people who simply got infected from bad blood during routine transfusions, it was an even smaller number.

Most people infected by transfusions were not hemophiliacs. Your source (*HIV And The Blood Supply: An Analysis Of Crisis Decisionmaking*, published in 1995) says 8,000 hemophiliacs and ""over 12,000 blood transfusion recipients"" were infected in the early 80s. Multiple infusions were not required: The infection rate for a transfusion using HIV-infected blood was about 90%.^[1] (That's from excellent data -- they stored a large amount of blood donated prior to the availability of testing, then tested it and followed up w/ the recipients of the infected blood.) 

Of course, that requires the donated blood to be infected. The fraction of infected donated blood increased from the late 70s until about 1982, when the problem was identified and efforts were made to prevent donations from high-risk individuals. That lowered the infected fraction, until it dropped to near-zero after testing became available in 1985. The fraction of infected blood from Sep 1984 to Feb 1985 across several regions was 0.16%.^[1] In the San Francisco Bay area from July 1 thru Dec 1984, it was 0.23%.^[2]

Overall, the infection rate rate per transfused unit of blood peaked at ~1.1% in late 1982 (San Fran data).^[2] Asimov had triple bypass surgery in Dec 1983 -- the likelihood of him being infected would depend on the blood screening practices in place in the NY area at that time.

TL;DR: Sally Ride applied to NASA after seeing an article in the Stanford newspaper, before NASA signed the contract w/ Nichelle Nichols' company.

The link says:

>From the late 1970's until the late 1980's, NASA employed Nichelle Nichols to recruit new astronaut candidates. Many of her new recruits were women or members of racial and ethnic minorities, including Guion Bluford (the first African-American astronaut), Sally Ride (the first female American astronaut), Judith Resnik (one of the original set of female astronauts, who perished during the launch of the Challenger on January 28, 1986), and Ronald McNair (the second African-American astronaut, and another victim of the Challenger accident).

The claim that Nichelle Nichols recruited Sally Ride is false. Ride was a PhD candidate in astrophysics at Stanford when she saw an article on the front page of *The Stanford Daily* on 12 Jan 1977, [""NASA to recruit women""](https://stanforddailyarchive.com/cgi-bin/stanford?a=d&d=stanford19770112-01&e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-------):

>[NASA] has contacted Margaret Collins, director of the Center for Research on Women here, in its effort to recruit women to become astronauts in its space shuttle program. Collins has not recommended any specific person, but she has forwarded the request to other people and organizations. ""We are using a sex blind selection process,"" said a public information officer at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. NASA is conducting a year-long search ending June 30, 1977 for applicants to its astronaut training program. To date they have received more than 1000 applications. Roughly 10 per cent of these have been from women.

Ride then wrote a [letter](https://www.businessinsider.com/sally-ride-read-letter-nasa-become-first-american-woman-space-2019-6) to NASA asking them to send her ""the forms necessary to apply as a 'mission specialist' candidate"". The letter is stamped w/ the date Jan 27, 1977 -- not sure what that refers to. According to Lynn Sherr's [biography](https://books.google.com/books/about/Sally_Ride.html?id=WmtNAgAAQBAJ) of Ride, after receiving and filling out the application forms, she mailed them on January 30, 1977 (see page 82).

So, NASA was attempting to expand its pool of applicants to include more women and minorities. To assist w/ that, in February 1977 they signed contract NASW-3049 w/ Nichelle Nichols' company, Women In Motion, Inc. There's a new documentary about Nichols' involvement w/ NASA, *Women in Motion*, and they've helpfully made the [final report](http://womaninmotionmovie.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/WIM-Final-NASA-Report-Execitive-Summary.pdf) (pdf) from that contract available.

So if the products are the same, [first sale doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-sale_doctrine) (trademark exhaustion) applies and importing is fine. But if the products differ, the manufacturer can prevent imports."
