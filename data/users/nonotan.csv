Quantity over quality is generally a good approach for beginners, but once you get to a moderate level, it often goes the other way round. Most moderate practitioners are ""good enough"" that they can do their thing on autopilot without really thinking at all, *and* already have a pretty good mastery of all the parts that they are capable of picking up without deeper insights and/or deliberate practice of unfamiliar techniques.

If you want proof, look at your average ""mediocre"" practitioner of something that takes a lot of skill to do well. For example, in competitive games with a large userbase (LoL/Dota/CS/Starcraft/Street Fighter/whatever) you can find vast numbers of players with *ludicrous* playtimes (in the tens of thousands of hours played) who are still average to below average, and often even bottom of the barrel, and have made basically 0 progress in many thousands of hours. You can find similar cases if you e.g. scan sites like deviantart for people who have uploaded almost daily for *decades* and are still, to put it bluntly, not good.

At the end of the day, practice is only worth anything if you're 1) learning something new, and 2) internalizing it so it actually becomes part of your skill set/long term memory. What you have to do to tick these boxes will heavily depend on your current skill set."

Furthermore, the reason I hate the idea that consumers should ""just"" voluntarily spend extra money to be ethical instead of regulating it so everyone has to play along, is that it's a literal tax on being a good person. Why create a monetary incentive to be an asshole? That's the *exact opposite* of what you want to do. You want to incentivize being a good guy, and if outright banning being an asshole is not an option, then at least make it cost more. That's how incentives work -- you design it such that they encourage the action you want people to take, not the other way round.

And if you're worried the tax will affect poor people -- maybe support a more comprehensive welfare system that allows poor people access to a healthy diet that's also not hard on the environment, instead of indirectly subsidizing bad stuff by letting it ignore the hidden costs of its environmental impact."

science,ff5ojdf,t1_ff5m8r2,1579603362.0,"Well, actually, yeah, I'd say that's a fairly likely assessment. We may be able to root out 99%, even 99.99% of typical cancers, but going from that to 100% may well be literally impossible. Keep in mind cancer is more or less equivalent to a buggy program going in an infinite loop, just the source code happens to be DNA-based. 

We've known for almost a century that working out whether a program will run indefinitely or halt at some point is [impossible to calculate in the general case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem). Not ""very hard"", not ""extraordinarily hard"", *provably impossible*. Now, obviously the analogy to cancer isn't exact, and so it would be inappropriate to apply this result as-is. It's possible that something about the physicality of cancer and the fact that it needs to procure its own energy to keep growing makes it fundamentally different from the halting problem in some way that does allow for a general solution. Or whatever. But most people who have dealt with computing theory before know to be wary of the fallacy that anything is possible given sufficiently advanced technology. Sometimes it just isn't. Doesn't mean we should give up before showing that to be the case, obviously. Just, that it would be wise to temper our expectations so as not to be blindsided by disappointment down the road.

(Disclaimer: yes, I am aware that technically the halting problem only applies to Turing-complete paradigms of computation, and so it's possible the problem might theoretically be solved through some superior paradigm that we manage to actually create a computer out of in the physical world -- still, I wouldn't hold my hopes too high for that happening at any point, I'd actually be less surprised if that too was proved impossible, to be honest)"

politics,ff2pdp4,t1_ff2mrv8,1579517757.0,"I'm pretty worried Warren may have just handed either Trump or Biden the presidency with that single move. Before, it seemed like the inevitable result of the primaries was that one of Bernie or Warren (probably Warren, going by the polls) would stand down and give the other their full support, more or less guaranteeing a progressive candidate, given current poll numbers. Instead, far from cooperating, it seems like Warren set it up to become a direct confrontation -- which, to put it bluntly, only helps Biden (and, indirectly, Trump; Biden feels to me like he would be by far the weakest of the big candidates)

The fact that the move makes no sense strategically gives me a very bad vibe. That is to say, while the move could hurt Bernie, it seems hard to envision a future in which it improves Warren's chances of becoming the democratic candidate. So the choices that leaves us is:

1. Warren failed to read the repercussions of this move correctly. I.e. she's incompetent. Not a good look.

2. Warren genuinely felt personally hurt by this supposed exchange, and let her feelings take over instead of being pragmatic and waiting for a more appropriate occasion to deal with it. Again, not a good look for a presidential candidate to be that hot-headed.

3. She has some sort of hidden agenda/is actually working against her supposed progressive agenda. People were speculating on a promise of a VP spot on Biden's campaign, and while that seems a bit too over-the-top to believe without concrete evidence, you can see where they might have got the idea.

Whichever the reason is, my opinion of her took a dip. I would urge anyone genuinely wanting a progressive candidate and currently supporting her to be skeptical going forward. Not saying to drop her like a hot potato, just... be very careful you don't end up going against your best interests."
technology,femoyzm,t1_feltnzw,1579265211.0,"I just want to say that you're right that the problem is harder than banking, but wrong that it's somehow ""impossible even in principle"" to do it securely. In terms of that video, the assumption we need to break is that it's obvious to the layperson that the system is secure and the results haven't been tampered with. 

Frankly, while that's a nice ideal to strive for, it's just a way too high standard, higher than we hold pretty much any part of the currently deployed legislation to. Most people have very little knowledge about the obtusely complicated legislation that nevertheless legally binds them as they go about their lives. Indeed, existing electronic voting machines that are already deployed in various states already wildly violate this principle, so I wouldn't feel too bad letting it go partially. This doesn't mean the system wouldn't be provably robust and the results provably valid -- only that verifying this is the case would require non-trivial effort on the part of any random citizen to be informed, which could be facilitated by a government-sponsored educational opportunity of some kind.

Assuming we're happy to let go of that, the problem of cryptographically-secure voting that is anonymous and verifiable is actually not all that hard in principle. The only real tricky bit is the bridge where real identities (which we need to verify to check the person in question is eligible to vote in this election, and that they haven't already done so) are used as keys to access a single-vote token that needs not to be traceable backwards even at that point in time (i.e. the person/system giving out the tokens shouldn't be able to tell what voting token was assigned to what voter). 

I don't have a 100% rock solid solution for it, but a possible approach is something similar to that used by Tor: you keep track of voters the traditional way, and let each voter submit one encrypted token generated on their side, which is actually a matryoshka-doll-like series of messages signed to a number of independent authority servers (i.e. not all run by the government, but for example other governments or international organizations). The government keeps a database of voter - initial encrypted key pairs. 

The key part is, the messages are kept signed until the registration period is over, at which point the first server shuffles and sends them in bulk to the second server, which again shuffles and send them in bulk to the third, etc. Unless 100% of them have been compromised, it should be impossible to trace the original user. And by ""send to the next server"", I actually mean ""publicly release"", for future verification. As for ""what if they just change the contents to something else"", a list of the public part of all accepted tokens would be openly published before the actual election, and if yours isn't on there, you can raise a complaint, and prove your case by showing the encrypted key in the government's database is actually the result of encrypting a token nowhere to be found on the final list. Furthermore, you could even tell *exactly* where your token ""vanished"", since all intermediate lists of tokens are public, which would be a very bad look for whoever's responsible, and you could just replace them by another actor and try again. Because voting didn't happen yet, the fact that you had to publish your ""secret"" to prove wrongdoing is actually not a breach of anonymity -- if you're right, you'd just redo registration all over again with all new keys. Of course, this would be a significant inconvenience for all involved, but hey, safety isn't free.

Finally, when it comes to the voting itself, you just need to prove you have ownership of one of the valid tokens and what that token counts towards. We don't even need some fancy blockchain shit to do that. Something similar to the registration phase is sufficient -- first, each token is something along the lines of 2 matryoshka-doll hashes, i.e. you have a random sequence, salted hash it, and then salted hash it again. It could be more than 2 in case additional proof of identity ever becomes necessary, but 2 is ""enough"". Now you ""vote"" by submitting in an encrypted form what your choice is *and* what the ""innermost"" hash is, and as ""proof"" give the server the ""outermost"" hash. When the deadline for voting is over, a list of all valid tokens alongside their encrypted votes is published. Critically, a token may have any number of submissions as long as the submitter proves they know the outer hash. Although this hypothetically may create issues with DoS if some crazy person submits terabytes of signatures or something, perhaps that can be fixed somehow. The reason I'm suggesting having any number of submissions is that, even though you could publish a list of submitted unique pairs at this point and 1. prove ownership of a token to a level deeper than anyone else, including any potential eavesdroppers, by releasing the ""inner"" ""password"", 2. at this point, anonymity is not broken... the issue is that there is no way to verify the origin of a ""fake vote"" isn't *the voter*, and there is no way to retroactively change a vote that has been claimed as ""fake"" without breaking anonymity, short of rerunning the entire thing from the beginning -- and clearly, we don't want to give any voter the power to force a rerun by submitting an intentionally bogus vote.

So, by allowing any number of votes, what we do is say ""even if someone hypothetically eavesdropped/MITM'd your outer hash and submitted their own vote, you can still put in yours, and because any attackers shouldn't know the inner hash, only yours will be valid  at the end of the day"". Although the system is technically still prone to ""what if my vote simply doesn't show up regardless"", a key feature is that it literally doesn't matter where you publish this vote. You could have, again, the same authoritative servers from step 1 all accepting votes and hosting their own lists, and if even 1 is honest you'll be fine. Hell, you can publish it on *reddit* (or 4chan, or anywhere else) and at least have something that can be retroactively included in the count if it does come down to that.

So, the final step is publishing the passwords to unlock the encrypted votes. Again, it doesn't really matter where you do it. Given the right password, anyone can verify 1. who the vote is for, 2. that the vote is legitimate (because it includes the inner hash as ""proof"") -- and therefore, at the end of the voting period, anyone can run a count and verify it matches the official one. If it doesn't, well, time for some good ol' protesting. If it does, hypothetically we have a system where each registered voter on the government database has *provably* submitted (at most) one vote, where the results are *provable* (you can check your own vote, and at the very least that the total count adds up), and still anonymous.

As for the ""but how can I trust my hardware"" issue, well, the various stages, limited information reveal at each stage, and verification at each step should make things much harder for any nefarious actor. Basically, the only truly vulnerable step is the initial generation of the hashes. If you can secure that (and the resulting values), then we should be good even in the presence of any type of malware or whatever. While in principle you could even do it all through pen & paper, that would obviously be incredibly inconvenient (and prone to error), so perhaps a hardware key generator that is *provably* (to experts, not laymen) not communicating with anything or storing the data anywhere other than temporarily showing it on screen would be the best approach. You can literally have a bare circuit behind a transparent case, and what a layperson *can* do is verify visually that what they have appears to match the official, ""verified-safe-by-experts"" circuit. I won't claim that's 100%, airtight secure by any means, but it's *way* better than what we currently have for pretty much anything, including banking, *and* including paper ballots (guess what, ""adding 1 fake ballot"" is *a lot* easier than ""replace 1 hardware key with an extremely convincing fake that can get you a voter token"" -- and in the 2nd situation, any victims can at the very least personally know their data was compromised, and provide *strong* evidence to that effect, whereas in the 1st situation the bad guys just got a free vote that won't ever be identified as such)"

Feel free to check how much they're spending per student -- I promise you it is less than the average tuition in the US, whichever country you pick. Same with healthcare. Your issues with tuition and healthcare costs are because you have halfassed systems that it's hard to believe weren't intentionally made shitty on purpose, not because making these things available to all is unfeasible."

By the way, these ""handouts"" would actually cost you less money than your stupidly inefficient healthcare does right now. That's not hypothetical, you can literally look at healthcare costs in any civilized country where they have a single payer system and compare it to yours and see for yourself. 

Although I realize telling you this has virtually zero chance of achieving anything other than perhaps irritating you as you subconsciously realize what you will never have the guts to come to terms with -- you have been brainwashed by the American right-wing narrative pushed by the media to voluntarily go against your own best interests. ""Poor people looking for handouts"" aren't your enemy, and they aren't stealing your money. The rich people funding the right-wing propaganda you have eaten up are in fact the ones sucking you dry."

Third, fossil fuel companies have engaged in very dodgy practices, like keeping findings about climate change that they had *decades* before it became widely known secret, and lying about it for the longest time, all while lobbying and using underhanded tactics to hurt the renewable energy industry. While also getting subsidies from the government for some reason that seems hard to justify as anything other than overt corruption? So yeah, I'm gonna go with ""blaming them is fair game"" here. No, they aren't literally the sole cause of climate change. But they *are* a big factor, perhaps the single biggest one."
