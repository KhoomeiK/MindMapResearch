sure. but only to an extent. 

*everything* has the potential to screw you over. what kind of life do you want to live? that said, everyone is running from something and we *all* have our forms of escape whether its heroin or skydiving.

ill end this comment by saying kratom can be very addictive and carry withdrawal symptoms. do *not* become dependent on it. but, if you're just taking it once in a while to make the odd-shitty-day better, then why not? the only thing i would watch out for in that case is your barometer for what constitutes a ""shitty day"" to make sure you don't keep doing it more often.
