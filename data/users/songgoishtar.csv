Which is what I get all the time"
depression,fen66vy,t3_epvzb0,1579277852.0,Depression is super common and can happen to anyone and stay or go. I think it should be more widely known and treated like we treat the common cold. It is an illness and people need to be cared for during that time.
aww,fen4sjq,t1_feh40o5,1579276966.0,No. My friend who owned the cat did. I think. Is this an older video?
aww,feghfss,t3_eonqox,1579092866.0,I freaked out cause I have a roommate who has a cat named Luna who looks like that and does that
NoStupidQuestions,fegg0x3,t3_eooido,1579091525.0,"I don't do it, but I want to for my anxiety and other mental illness. I struggle day to day and my doctors want me to be on heavy drugs.

That is scary. Thc feels healthier and it helps the shakes I have. (I am an artist) might help with my terrible insomnia in which I have to take meds for anyways, and help the fact I can't eat so I'm underweight. 

I hope it gets legalized here soon, it might help me so much."
furry_irl,fea9tjn,t1_fe8lkco,1578946064.0,"This thread made me feel a little better. I'm ftm and I dunno if I ever will get t or bottom-op . My issues arnt with the lack of a dick... But everything else. Mainly body, voice, and breasts...

I like the normalization of all this. It helps me as a baby trans."
depression,fe9ykcy,t3_eo55m9,1578942607.0,"I struggle with it, but the only thing keeping me going is that I remembered when my best friend took his life. He'd kill me if I did it too... haha.

I hate life, everything about it. How stuck i feel. I think I stay cause I know others will follow... maybe that's why my best friend cut me off before he left..."

.. bf too"
IsItBullshit,fcm9h7k,t3_ehmud6,1577767857.0,"It really does depend. Like a lot of comments are saying.

Once when my cat got out,  I knew where he was because a squirrel was screaming at him. (He was scared...)

And here, now, we have a couple of crows that get loud if I am outside with the dog.

I think though, if things are awfully quiet in the woods, listen to your gut.

Adding to this, it feels like it happens with bad weather. I was outside in my younger years when I felt like something was off. The neighborhood was quiet. No birds. Nothing. 10 minutes later we had a tornado warning and had to go hide. 

I guess your best bet is to know where you are, know the warning signs, be aware, and don't go hiking alone."
