JUSTNOFAMILY,ff6rrsw,t1_ff5g6px,1579633522.0,">>well the way they are is not nice or acceptable anymore!

So true!  I feel this so much.

We were supposed to go visit the ILs over Thanksgiving, but a confluence of events (I ended up getting my gall bladder out and their furnace stopped working) made those plans fall through.  Oh, I was sooooo broken-hearted, let me tell you.

And I've started telling hubby that I want to go to Illinois this summer (where my family are) rather than going down the coast to his family.  We haven't been to Illinois for ten years.  TEN YEARS.  Hubby's always said that it's more involved for us to travel to them and easier if they travel to us, and I guess that's been fair for a good long while?  Except that his parents have had the disposable income to travel but wah wah his dad can't find a hotel that allows smoking wah, so we've always had to go to them.

Well, things have changed.  FIL and MIL's health and age are such that travel is not so easy for them, but the same is true of my parents as well.  My dad is in his 70s and mobility is getting to be a thing for him.  We should still insist that he travel to us?  My mom hasn't been able to visit for a year and a half due to her husband's health.  By kids's summer break, it'll be 2 years.  

And yeah, it's more of a big deal for us to travel, but I'm sick of hearing him talk about how it's harder and talk more about how we're going to make it happen.

Not to mention, not counting our honeymoon, I don't think hubby and I have ever traveled anywhere on a vacation just for us.  EVER.  Our vacations, his vacation time with work, has always been about visiting family, usually visiting his family.  (Because he takes no vacation days when my family has visited us.)

It's just frustrating, and I'm sure he grew up being the peacekeeper and all that and it's easier to go along to get along for him, but it is so frustrating for me.  Only two times in my life that I know of, he has stood up to his family on my behalf.  And only once was spontaneous, without needing to be asked.  It's frustrating.

(And here's me going on and on again and it's not my thread.  So sorry, don't mean to threadjack.)"
JUSTNOFAMILY,ff3v4pr,t1_ff3ffi1,1579549522.0,"Yep, it's a tough spot for folks like us to be in.  Not wanting to make things worse, not knowing how to make things better.  I just think it's worth having the serious talks now, rather than waiting 20 years to have the talk about how not rocking the boat as far as the parents are concerned shouldn't carry more weight than them not rocking the boat with you.  They're not more important than you are.  He should at very least treat you as equally important... at very least.  Don't wait 20 years to have that conversation.

Also, my personal, non-professional opinion?  When parents play favorites with their kids, it absolutely is emotionally abusive toward the kid who is not the favorite.  Your hubby says they think he's stupid?  Where did he form that idea?  I'm guessing he heard them say it.  Or heard them say things that suggested it.  And yeah, that's an insidious sort of abuse, IMO.  Your husband needs to value himself as well as valuing you, and TOTALLY easier said than done.

But you get to decide how much you're willing to put up with, and how much you're willing to try before deciding it's not worth trying anymore."
JUSTNOFAMILY,ff3ega6,t3_erci9i,1579539410.0,"In a similar boat to you.  My ILs are not so completely horrible, like, ALL THE TIME or anything, but there are little comments here and there and stupid bullshit that crosses a line that they will never apologize for.  Hubby takes my side in private, but rarely stands up to his parents in public.  I have stood up to them more than he has and yes, he has asked me to not rock the boat in the past, too, but I just get to a point where I can't deal with their bullshit anymore and snap at them.  Amazingly, their behavior changes (in the short term, anyway).

I am still with him, and yes it has put a strain on our marriage at times.  Fortunately, we don't see his parents that often, but it's still a little too often for my liking.  If they could just manage to be reasonable human beings...

But I have always suspected that things were not that great between hubby and his parents (his father especially, tho his mom is definitely an enabler of dad's behavior).  I don't know how confident I am to declare that he was raised in an emotionally abusive family, but you know what?  I'm also not confident declaring that he wasn't.  His dad has, in the past, disowned each of his sons, sometimes more than once, if they did things that he didn't like.  And this isn't just ""silent treatment, pretend you don't exist because I can't be mature enough to realize that I don't have a right to control your actions,"" but legit disowning.  I can't imagine I understand what my husband dealt with growing up.  I can't presume to know how much of his behavior is just generally keeping the peace.

I do know, however, that hubby and I had a talk last summer because I have straight up hit my limit.  Hubby and I have been together more than half my life.  Been married almost 20 years and dating for 4 years prior to that.  He has asked me to ""be careful"" in my interactions with his parents (specifically his dad), to not cross the line, not rock the boat, etc.  But last summer, I made it very clear that after 20+ years of this bullshit, **their line is NOT more important than my line.  Their boat is NOT more important than my boat.** 

The last two decades have proven to me that they don't care when they cross the line, partly because I've rarely felt comfortable showing them where the line was, and partly because they didn't think my line mattered.  I will never get a genuine apology from them, of the sort where they actually realize and admit what they did wrong and seek to make things right.  (I do sometimes get the placating apology or the semi-sarcastic apology... that's the best I've ever gotten from them.)  And why would I want to be around people who make me feel like that and think it's okay to treat me like that?  Hubby agreed with me and admitted, for the first time in 20+ years, that **his parents make him feel that way, too.**

It does hurt that hubby won't stand up to his parents on my behalf, because god knows if my parents did some bullshit to hurt my husband, I would stand up to them on his behalf.  But I also have some sympathy for my husband because it's somewhat understandable that he can't stand up to them for me when he can't even stand up to them for himself.

What I just can't understand in all of this is, in the face of this, why he insists on visiting them regularly to keep them happy.

This is really long.  I didn't mean to make this about me, and I'm really sorry if it comes out that way.  My husband had his life.  No idea if it's anything the same as what your husband had to deal with in his life.  Stay or go is up to you, I wouldn't presume to know your life well enough to tell you which choice to make.  I would recommend that you have the hard conversations with your husband before any sort of decision gets made.  But I do know what it's like to be in that position.  And it sucks.  It's awful, and no one should ever have to have it happen to them.  You get to decide where you go from here."

As far as what's the right thing to do, you need to determine for yourself what makes your life better and what makes your life worse.  You need to welcome and embrace the things that make your life better, and you need to govern (by which, I mean things like imposing and enforcing boundaries, which he doesn't seem able/willing to understand) or distance yourself from things that make your life worse.

Get help if you think you need it, if it's readily available to you, and you can afford it.  It's time to rebuild yourself.

It's okay to miss your mom, even tho, as you say, she was complicit in the abuse by doing nothing to stop it.  Parents have a duty of care, and either out of fear of her husband or out of apathy, she failed in her responsibility as a parent to protect you.  You don't have to hate her to justify cutting her off.  She doesn't have to be the evil monster or the supervillain, and you can still recognize that her being in your life doesn't make you better in any way.  It doesn't improve anything.

His opinions about mental health are not super surprising.  Taking the stigma off mental health is a fairly recent thing and is still very much in process.  We haven't won that battle yet.  But him being a shithead and saying that if your mom killed herself it would be anyone's fault other than her own is a total dick move.  It's manipulative and it's abusive, meant to do nothing more than control you and put you in your place.  MAAAAYBE her current situation is, in some part, due to having to grow up with HIM for a father!  But I'm sure pride would never let him entertain that notion.  Mental health can be situational, or it can be genetic.  You could be born with it, or you could acquire it over time.  I'm sure I'm not to say, but if he throws some shit at you like that again, I'd certainly consider retaliating in kind.

As for him not bringing them up with you directly, is there any way you can (or do you have any desire to) call him and say, ""Grandpa, I just had a very disturbing conversation with Sister,"" and then lay this shit out?
