Advice,fcxn1bw,t1_fcxd4r5,1578066838.0,"Oh lol, you meant it literally. xD"
Advice,fcxc7hp,t1_fcwassy,1578058919.0,... what did you come from with that?
Advice,fcxc6lp,t1_fcw3grw,1578058897.0,"Its not about people's impression, it's about what you feel when you wear something that you consider 'nice'. It just gives off that glow of happyness and confidence that even the person that waers it, can feel it."
Advice,fcxbur2,t3_ejciai,1578058615.0,"Hmm maybe try to buy him a game with a happy ending. Im gonna turn nerd mode now. 

Does he like any platforming games like Mario Brothers and the kind?"
Advice,fcxbewr,t1_fcx707o,1578058223.0,"Maybe but I know he is just in a dark place. Has been for quite a long time now and unfortunately I cant get him out from there myself. Hes just the kind that wants things to be simple because he hates or maybe he is even afraid of complications.

He would surely call me names if he knew I was making this assumptions about him.

Even if its not me, I just hope that he can find somebody who can brighten his day enough to wish to stay by that person side even if things get complicated. I now just understand that Im not her.

Thanks. You helped me out to feel better : )

And about finding a guy, with my streak of bad luck I dont think I'll find them any time soon. But its ok. I can wait a while longer. (And just now realized that maybe Im putting this presumed future first bf on too high of a pedestal)"
Advice,fcx01da,t1_fcw2t5l,1578045114.0,"Alright than, maybe it was an honest mistake also. But just try to pay more attention to your surroundings, just in case of creeps."
Advice,fcwzlct,t1_fcw6hyx,1578044533.0,"Thanks for the invitation to chat : ) 
And you already have a purpose, Im sure of it.

Also, I was more wandering if my friendship with A can be salvaged... I mean, he has really bad jokes, but he is a great person and Im scared of him just disappearing just because of my mistakes.

You can message me too if you ever really need it ^0^"
Advice,fcwz6m3,t1_fcw7kjd,1578043989.0,"Ok, thanks guys. But that fear is just always there. I take the step to ask someone out but they show even the slightest of hesitation and I just... chicken out of it.

Thanks for the tip but I just wanted more advice on knowing if my friendship with A can be saved or not."
TrueOffMyChest,fcwz15e,t1_fcwaguq,1578043786.0,"Yes, they can but I believe OP needs to take it a bit slow and just test the waters right now"
offmychest,fcwymd4,t3_ej7uhm,1578043253.0,"Well, no to be blunt... but that my internet redditor is a shitty day. Have a good cacao if youre not allergic and just try to keep smiling for him, wherever he is, because he definetely wouldnt wish to see you sad. Its a dog, he would definetely tackle you and lick your face off if he saw you sad."
Advice,fcw26rc,t3_ej7bit,1578015425.0,"Does the theme of trains rings any bell to you? Maybe an old fan, although quite a bit weird to not leave anything else like a card with the present. At least try to pay a little more attention to your surroundings just in case and put some home security. Better be safe than sorry."
Advice,fcw0v3c,t1_fa1hagz,1578014554.0,"Or if they are so paranoid get an emergency button that cant be easily reached. As in you want to push it, not my hand fell over it while sleeping."
TrueOffMyChest,fcvzt5x,t1_fcvq9oy,1578013857.0,Than its the third. And about the other is just what I hear from my own family. Because they comitted and all that shit. But Ive been always wondering if they were truly in love. At least I know for my gramps it wasnt quite so. But they are still married. I think they are more glad they have someone watching their back.
Advice,fcvygnk,t3_e896bo,1578012971.0,"No, you're not. A bad person just wants to hurt people on purpose. And even if you do it is because you, yourself, are hurt."
TrueOffMyChest,fcvy3nd,t3_eilfqn,1578012734.0,"Im sorry for being nosy but I've went to see your posts too. And excuse my language, but what a shitty mothertrucker!
How dare them?! How do they dare?! There is absolutely nothing wrong with you! They must be feeling so freaking petty about their life that they just hate on anybody that just tries to live positive!

What an fd up moron! Ughhh! I would have goddamn snapped on them for this shit and you have a right to! Nobody deserves to say that! Nobody!

Even if it doesnt look like it I believe some people at least actually appreciate what you do! And I swear if I catch any assholes like them, they will have to block me to shut me up!"
TrueOffMyChest,fcvwwgj,t3_eiz6vq,1578011947.0,I actually like your way of thinking dude.
TrueOffMyChest,fcvvhf4,t1_fcvp4uq,1578011025.0,"Sincerily speaking, friends in the physical realm can be even bigger assholes than those online."
TrueOffMyChest,fcvv8dp,t1_fcvetgs,1578010862.0,"With that age I believe your husband can actually do whatever he wants, as long as he doesnt stop searching for something he likes."
TrueOffMyChest,fcvv40e,t3_ej4ixl,1578010786.0,Honestly Im just like your husband minus the fact that Im mediocre in absolutely everything and Im 22 also. My pops even gave me an ultimatum in continuing Computer Engineering and I fell behind my friends and I really dont know if I love this anymore and I want to continue to be with people in an environment that people dont discriminate me just because Im in love with videogames and storytelling.
TrueOffMyChest,fcvttv6,t1_fcv6il6,1578009959.0,"Ok, now it depends on issues, because if its something morally wrong. Than yes, its wrong. But the rest about movements or whos gonna be the next greatest whatver is just bs. There was a great percentage of people who liked to see Miss Universe for all the bad reasons but the #MeToo movement took it all away because it was degrading to woman. They were right (even though those girl that make it in that comp are more fake than plastic personality wise). I never cared about it in the least. What they should have done is to push people to make Mister Universe, not shot down Miss Uni. But that would be morally wrong for women since the majority have been thought they need to look only at their husband or they would be called harlots. The 2000 years long culture is what is wrong, not people jerking off to some hot girls in bikinis and just that. Even women sexually assault men. I sincerilly prefer a person that watches porn than somebody making sexual assaults on random victims just because they are insecure about themselves as a partner.
Anyway sorry about ranting but I wanted to just say that there needs to be a balance. Because otherwise people are just gonna live their lives fighting for something that doesnt even matter.
What you need to do buddy, is trust your gut. If you know, feel or understand that something is wrong or good just follow your gut. And if its not good there's gonna be somebody out there who is going to tell you to stop because it hurts people. You need to live as you see fit among people who share your gut feeling."
TrueOffMyChest,fcvsb7l,t1_fcv8beb,1578008983.0,"Everything was ok until the last part were its sound kind of bad since well, damaged in itself is a bad word by reading the dictionary. How about you use just ""a zipped"" or ""different""? It sounds better, I think?"
TrueOffMyChest,fcvrs9n,t1_fcvh6iz,1578008641.0,Now I remember all the memes about people in their 30's liking MLP
TrueOffMyChest,fcvrmjc,t1_fcus633,1578008536.0,"Its ""pretty"" good... maybe? I mean, its best than others but... idk"
TrueOffMyChest,fcvr75m,t3_eiwul7,1578008261.0,"Its for kids yes, Im not gonna lie even though I like the show myself and Im in my 20s, but Im just gonna say I think people actually like more the content that the own fandom makes over all the filler episodes. For example, some fanfictions are just really better than the show and some series on Netflix (not lying, some series are shit) and if you are a hopeless romantic you are just gonna dig into them, even if they dont make any fucking sense ( One of my favourites is about the protagonists falling in love over emails without all the superhero shit, I tried to explain it and people were like ""but thats impossible"" and I knew it but I still fell in love with the story and how well was written). And 2, its a great way to do money like any other liked show. Artist need to live from something. If not from their original work, from fanart. Also, the creator says that he doesnt need writting advice from kids, but with all the filler episodes and when I also heard they want to make 8 seazons from it... yes, Thomas Astruc, its clear your show turned into a cash grab and you dont care less. 
I only follow the fanbase because of some good memes just like the ones with Marvel or the fanfics but the show itself... I could care less."
TrueOffMyChest,fcvq24x,t1_fcu4rcq,1578007530.0,Well it sounds like you are a coward. Or just too lazy to actually care enough about somebody. Or just too logical about it.
TrueOffMyChest,fcvpvrz,t1_fcu7ac0,1578007416.0,"Wait, wait, wait. Are you actually saying that someone who has issues doesnt deserve to be loved? Because it sounds like that. 
Im not saying she deserves to be by OP's side, because she's not. What she actually needs is the will to change and professional help. Not OP being her lapdog (if you read this OP, from what I read it just sounds like she is using you (cant she, seriously, use public transportation in exchange of you biking? Well, excuse me if I belittle her pain but personally IDC, she would have had to do it anyway if you werent there for her) ) or her children being afraid to be abandoned by their mother. 
I think the guy who said you need to become the bad guy is right but I also believe you need to get your kids to see that you really are there for them and that they are not responsible for the wellbeing of their mother since they are kids and they dont have to deal with that until at least they are legally adults. And for God's sake she is an adult herself with kids. Yes, pain can f you up but you cant act forever like a teenager, even more when you have kids.
I think OP you need to tell her that she needs to change, otherwise it will be up to you to make changes and she will very much dislike it.
Also for the person Im replying to, I dont believe divorcing her is the answer. At least yet. Because OP loves her or at least he did so once. They bought a freaking house. Yes, he had a crush on someone just because they brought him coffee but that just show how unappreciated he feels. It would be a bad move to go searching for someone in such a state because he could find someone worse than his wife. 
Im just trying to say that I find incorrect and cruel what you said, about people with issues or baggage not being worth it. But you do you."

And Im okay with all that, but Ill still eat some pork liver and chicken breast and whatever else I like."
offmychest,fcvl4r7,t1_fcqse9u,1578004432.0,"Alright... sorry dude. At least your kids will read it, I think. I hope you have a better time from now on."
offmychest,fcqr36p,t3_eihmsl,1577890873.0,"Im sorry if I may insult you someway, but I believe she should read this. Write her a letter just like this. If she did love you once... maybe she will tie some loose knots with this."

offmychest,fcqp6jj,t3_eii6yh,1577889920.0,"Dude, let me tell ya. Im in university and I still have no f idea what to do with my life. But I decided to chill. Because its not the end of the world. For now just reasearch and try stuff that actually make you get a bit of a smile.
Also think if there is any course you liked in school and try for that. And if its not for you, no big deal. You will find something. But its important to never give up on trying."

About your little brothers, yes, maybe you acted like a ... whatever around them but you guys are family. This year you can make it up to them.
As for your friends? Ditch them. To not say something worse."
offmychest,fcqnvpx,t1_fcq1f0x,1577889284.0,Than ditch them. Better alone than in a toxic environment.
offmychest,fcqnf44,t3_eigm26,1577889057.0,"That was a bit cold... I only recommend to talk about it with a friend and afterwards decide if you want to talk about it with him or not. Anyway, I wish you a more warmer 2020 full of realizations, hugs and kisses."
