It seems that the only difference is that your union is legitimizing the choice to do an objectively bad job.  Which, to me, is just the shittiest kind of culture.

The whole delivery setup process was pretty third rate, too. It's clear this isn't a well-considered part of their business. They basically feel obligated to even provide it at all.

The pick-up stores were even more perplexing. You have this full-on IKEA branded store with a show-room even. And yet if you show up to buy and pick-up an item, you still have to pay a delivery fee, for them to ship merchandise to their own store.

This is where local government can shine. They are in a position to engage the public, by-law, police, and the schools to come up with sensible solutions.
 
Here's an example hypothetical solution that I haven't tested in any manner:

Problem statements:

1. We want to reduce congestion and keep roads moving.

2. We want to encourage walking.

3. Parents aren't assholes, I don't buy into ""special snowflake"" narrative. They're justifiably nervous about kids walking on their own these days. (The standard for parenting and public judgement has gone way up since I was a kid).

Okay so how about we arrange:

1. by-law will start enforcing no stopping (when I was a kid there was a by-law officer who would literally be out front of WCI every day for a season immediately ready to write ticktes).

2. a police cruiser will hang out at the intersection(s) that make parents the most nervous.

3. push parents to make their kids walk. If by-law and police engagement isn't enough, maybe government can take the lead on promoting a culture of walking. Put up ""school walk meeting site"" signs. Send out newsletters talking about it. Get schools to add it to their culture and newsletters. Get volunteer adult ""walkers"" who collect kids and walk them as a group (maybe as part of the crossing guard program).
