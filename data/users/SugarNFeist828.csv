Remind yourself every single day that you’re a Queen and get out there and own it. Slay 2020 and when it’s about time to move in to 2021, this time next year, you can look back and be like “Damn I did that.” You got this mama and remember that even Queens cry and grieve. It is A-ok to miss your husband and hate your friend or hell hate them both but remember that life is too short to hold on to it. Your precious baby will help you cope and give you strength that you didn’t even know existed. Harness that strength and do good things. We know you’ve got this.
