MonsterHunterWorld,fggzsw8,t1_fggsfwk,1580773309.0,"I tend to go for the kill rather than capture and there’s plenty of tail rewards there, but I’ll try if only to keep from getting swept every time a Diablos whips around!"
MonsterHunterWorld,fggnwdy,t1_fggbfym,1580765773.0,"I love my hammers. They’re surprisingly mobile, they do damage fast, tenderize parts easily, and most of all you get to turn into Sonic whenever there’s a hill. The only downside is not being able to cut tails, but those come along in carves anyway. Favorite weapon hands down. 

Now, if I could learn hunting horn, I’d be truly unstoppable..."
MonsterHunterWorld,fgenwkw,t1_fgenl7p,1580704367.0,"I get that, but I find they take ~5 minutes or less, and the results really will help!"
MonsterHunterWorld,fgen78t,t1_fgda8bc,1580703807.0,"Your ghillie mantle really helps. I’ve never had to fight anything for those fetch quests unless it’s the “destroy ten gajalaka” quest. Even as annoying as they may seem, it’s really worth it."

HobbyDrama,fg8mt59,t3_exhyd6,1580624737.0,"I figured it was kind of like the legends of old fae etc? Salt and iron burn them, so people lined their doorways with it and kept them out. Forgive me, but aren’t Druids kind of tree fairies? I don’t even play DnD, I just thought that would make sense as to why they’d have that rule lore-wise and a restriction for player characters not being able to wear every type of armor ever."
