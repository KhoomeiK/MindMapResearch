worldpolitics,ffntod3,t1_ffkfdts,1580070669.0,"Oh gotcha. I was talking about the original post (image), whereas you were talking about a comment the original poster made. My bad.

I agree that those are two different “they”s  that shouldn’t be confused by OP or anyone else:

foodscam,ffinxiw,t1_ffdz3ik,1579978408.0,Nice! That’s the confirmation OP was looking for
Futurology,ffc9cpn,t3_esqkyd,1579794508.0,"WHHYYYYYY ?

Seriously can anyone explain why this is a good idea to anyone? Is there really that many people that have a lot of shit they want to pour into a stream?"
space,ffc7r2q,t3_esm05l,1579793482.0,"The prospect that something as static as the night sky—something reliable enough to navigate by—can *change* makes me feel a bit uneasy.

Also, I would love to see a supernova, but I would kind of miss Betelgeuse...
