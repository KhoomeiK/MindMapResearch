manga,ffdcvp0,t1_ff60ffn,1579818205.0,"Adachi Mitsuru's works are incredibly nuanced and rich in tonal reflections; however, when compared to a modern work like Ao no Flag, it lacks the relevant introspection that defines this generation's exploration of identity, which includes gender/gender roles, sexuality, societal expectations, mental health, etc. etc. 

Still, Mitsuru-sensei's works still hold an important place in my heart, especially H2, Cross Game, and Touch - H2 being the one that hit me the hardest when I read it back in High school. 

Have you read other works of his?"

Juno imposed her idealistic affection and ambitions onto Legosi without any consideration for his feelings. I'll give credits to her courage and boldness, and thus does not deserve pity, but rather some admiration is due. But that is all she gets. She never tried to get to know Legosi - never tried to see past his grey wolf identity. 

And yet, she saw through Louis just fine, she exposed him even. Clearly, she had been observing him much more closely than she did Legosi."
