There are many followers who are more morally adaptable to the player and don't have any defined moral alignment of their own. Also, some of Lielle's character does tend to speak to her specific moral framework, which is informed by her experiences in her backstory, which factors into some of her reactions to certain factions and characters. 

That said, I have the beginnings of an idea on how a morally-ambiguous, or even fully evil player character could corrupt her. It's not something I plan to implement for a good while, though."

We have a [Discord](https://discord.gg/h4aEZm9)! If you want to talk about Lielle, feel free to stop in.

All patches are considered experimental. Particularly the EFF patch. It does work, but can cause issues with her combat AI changes and targeted healing. If she stops using spells, use EFF to remove any spells she has and then teach her some new ones. 

If you use Nether's Follower Framework, or AFT, she should work within those systems, but I have not thoroughly tested either. If you notice issues with her AI, please let me know.

The Arcane Research quests have been updated and streamlined for hopefully better and more consistent behavior than 0.3.0b. If you experience issues, let me know and try to be specific about which quest is causing the issue.

The new content I've added contains of a heavily-scripted cut scene quest. It is mostly unvoiced, currently, and may get stuck, especially if you don't have Fuz Ro D'oh installed. Please let me know if you have issues with this specific quest. You'll know it when you see it."
skyrimmods,fffxk4t,t1_fffxeik,1579893990.0,"I was planning on holding off for a bit until more of the dialogue was voiced, but I was seeing a lot of reports regarding broken research quests on the old 0.3.0b release, so I decided to do a quick pass on them and then package this release."
skyrimmods,ffaon1c,t1_ff9xib0,1579740871.0,"I think a lot of the misinformation comes from the idea that mod authors, ever fed the fuck up with user complaints of ""ur mod broke mai gaem. u bad!!!"", began giving over-cautious instructions regarding save file maintenance and starting new saves when removing or adding mods to reduce the headache involved when people do it the ""wrong way"".

In my casual observation, cleaning scripts from your save when removing a mod works well for most mods, but isn't a guarantee for all mods. Some very heavy mods will never be fully scrubbed from a save file, which ultimately does entail a new save if you want to completely clean the old crap away. 

That being said, if you're knowledgeable about the game, modding and save maintenance, what you do is your choice. When an individual doesn't know what they're doing and then whines because ""it's broken"" does it cause an issue."
skyrimmods,ff9i8dm,t3_epbhwh,1579713575.0,"ANNOUNCEMENT:

It has since come to my attention that mods developed in SSE CK64 cannot be safely back ported to LE in the manner I had attempted. Per u/Arthmoor, doing so can cause significant errors and potential save corruption. If you have previously installed the Classic Edition version of Lielle on Skyrim Legendary Edition, do yourself a favor and UNINSTALL NOW, and clean your save thoroughly with {FallRim Tools}.   


I cannot, in good conscience, distribute files that may potentially cause corrupted save files. I apologize to those users on LE who wish to continue adventuring with Lielle. I may, at some point in the semi-distant future, release a Classic Edition version of Lielle, but cannot guarantee when or if that will happen."
