WinStupidPrizes,ffbkqfv,t3_eschvo,1579770004.0,Plot twist: The old man actually had Alzheimer’s and assumed the car was his and that he drove it so was sitting inside wondering how to start it. The two armed men were actually the owners of the vehicle and were spooked by the senile old man sitting in their vehicle and decided to forcibly remove him. The rest of the video is as follows........

depression,ff5ja0a,t3_erpy1z,1579595485.0,"It's because depression simply doesn't discriminate. It doesn't give a fuck if all your friends and family love you to bits or if you're all on your own completely alienated from the world. Depression simply doesn't care how rich, powerful, popular, successful, loved, hated, satisfied, confused or lost you are. It can strike literally anyone at any time in their life. And you're kidding yourself if you think more money, wealth, romance, a boyfriend, a girlfriend, drugs, accomplishments etc will keep you safe from the grips of depression. It will ALWAYS be there waiting to strike you at any given moment. That's why we need to constantly work on ourselves physically and emotionally by listening to ourselves and setting reasonable goals in life so that we can all be greater than our own suffering."
depression,ff2uok6,t3_erbiwf,1579524874.0,"Never spend time wishing and wanting to be like someone else because chances are that person you want to look like, they want to look like another person too. So where does that end. Everybody is wanting to look like someone else, you'll end up chasing something your whole life that's not even fucking real. But what's 100% real is not wanting to change anything about yourself because you take the guts to embrace who you are and just roll with it. There couldn't be anything more fake about a person who chases an idea of what they want to look like because everyone else is that way. Yes it may have taken 15 years to truly realise that knowledge but it's something very few will ever learn."

AMA,fefwfov,t3_eomqpy,1579067420.0,Bro 16000 hours is virtually 2 years straight non stop. Stop wasting your life man.
AMA,fe6rug4,t3_enq5nb,1578902421.0,"You can't recognise faces??? That's heaps weird. Why is it only limited to the human face? Shouldn't that mean you can't recognise any part of the human body then, it's all skin after all."
depression,fdqe0ki,t3_emo9c3,1578664194.0,"Every issue you have pointed out in your list of things you are not happy about in life can be 100% fixed, some of them definitely won't be overnight, but in time can absolutely be changed. Do you know what can't be changed though? Death. Well. Unless the universe ends one day, and then starts over again and everything repeats itself exactly the same way; then there's no coming back from that one. It's a matter of working out whether you want something that you CAN change or something you'll never be able to change."
depression,fdghggk,t3_el23c3,1578396960.0,"Do something completely and utterly random then. Just for the LOLS. Do something you normally wouldn't do, dont think about it too much though, just to break up that train of thought and help mix up that ""every day is the same"" feeling."
depression,fddfgp0,t3_eknnr3,1578309888.0,"""Seems like you're pretty much done if you have major depression""?? Not even close! It just makes you ""think"" that you're done, but if you actually challenge it, you would seriously be surprised man. Major depression can be an absolute MASSIVE motivator to achieve seriously impressive life goals man. Fuck being someone who doesn't have depression and strolls aimlessly through life with no real true motivator to reach greater heights. Once you get enough momentum behind you to achieve  a goal you have your heart set on, absolutely nothing on earth will be able to drag you down because you already know to the core what major depression is like and you will keep pushing so you dont ever have to go back there again. Depression is powerful stuff if used correctly."
AMA,fd0dd2y,t3_ejlxr7,1578117222.0,Bro thats fucking insane to win that amount in one hit! It makes me think back to the year 2010 when I bought $50 worth of Bitcoin when one single bitcoin cost 25 cents. So $50 worth got me 200 bitcoins. But boy oh boy if only I could of bought 20 million dollars worth of bitcoin back then. Put it this way Id certainly have alot left over today after buying my apartment in the city.
AMA,fcpacz2,t3_eibfzz,1577856034.0,Well that's not saying very much at all. Considering  its just turned 2020 now and the last decade was only a couple of hours ago. I've known people who have gone months and months without a shower unlike you which might of only been a few days. Big whoop.
depression,fcmfclm,t3_ehvaqw,1577773188.0,"New decade, new dreams. Simple as that. And don't let anyone get between you and your goal. Make it happen!"
depression,fcjwm6l,t3_eh9up7,1577708243.0,"Just try and take it easy man. Dont sweat it, dont stress, just take each day as one single day at a time, dont think too far ahead. Just remember too that nothing in life will ever really end up mattering. The universe will inevitably end one day and everything inside will cease to exist. But unfortunately in this life you're along for the ride whether you like it or not so you might as well just try and make it as fun as possible while you can. Just do your best man, thats all anyone can ever ask. Try not to think too far ahead into 2020 and more just focus on today and little things to help you progress. Just my 2 cents pal. Stay strong bud."
depression,fcbp4rk,t3_eggfff,1577589417.0,Some people will find peace in death that they never could find in life. Simple as that. You weren't asked permission to come into this world so you sure as fucking hell don't need permission to leave it.
AMA,fc45kch,t1_fc3qa5f,1577407207.0,"It's true, unfortunately Boomer. You really should of."
