Because, let’s face it, unless you’re going for a minimum wage job, everything that you apply for is going to require a degree. Maybe you can becoming a freelance writer, but other than that..."

KDRAMA,ffafz1a,t3_esagqr,1579734852.0,I think you should take a break from dramas for a little while.
AskReddit,ff4rd8h,t3_erhu3x,1579570600.0,"It was a nightmare. I saw it two different times. I don’t remember if it was in the same night or two different nights but the both ended differently. 
Here’s how it goes: I’m traveling with some friends to go to a party in the middle of nowhere for some reason. Near the place that is hosting the party, there is a home where one of my friends that is with me lives with his father. We go inside the house. The friend talks to his dad while me and the two other guys just wander around the house. It’s getting darker outside. Our friend rushes towards us saying that we have to leave. We’re like okay, let’s go. But before we can leave, we notice the friend’s dad acting weird. We don’t know what’s going on but the friend seems to. We hesitate for a moment then heads towards the door but the friend is there standing in front of it. We’re like ‘what are you doing?’ He says ‘it’s too late.’ We’re like ‘what?’ And get this, he LOCKS the door. We hear a loud sound behind us and guess what? The guy’s dad is freakin werewolf. Long story short, we all die.
The second time I had this same nightmare, the ending was different. As soon as we notice that something strange is going on with the dad, I’m out the door. I hear the friend lock the door behind me and I hide behind a plant near the house. I can hear the screams as every single one of my friends die. When I feel it’s safe, I run into the woods and stare at the house. It’s quiet. 
Then the nightmare ends. I survived."
amv,feysgh8,t3_eqvhcx,1579450051.0,"To make them smooth, make sure the scenes are consistent. When you’re using two completely different clips, match them up. For example, a person in one scene closing their eyes, then a person in a completely different scene opening their eyes. Also, one scene with a person throwing a punch, then a person in a another scene being blown back. I never really slow down my clips, but I do shorten some, which makes others seem long."

Libertarian,fepbkhb,t1_fepbedf,1579316525.0,"But the same thing happened to many owners of the American flag, such as Veterans and so on. People would take and tear it or burn it. But in that case, it’s called “freedom of speech”."
Christianity,fep38ml,t3_eq58df,1579311140.0,"I don’t give a crap what he says. There will always be good Christians and there will always be bad Christians. The only thing you can do is focus on being the best you that you can be. You can’t change others and you need to be fine with that. If even Jesus didn’t condemn people, what gives you the right? We’re called convict others, not condemn. Because you won’t change their mind if you do."
Libertarian,feomj49,t1_feoma7z,1579302192.0,It is. A man got 16-17 years for burning the rainbow flag. It was called a hate crime. Look it up.

WhitePeopleTwitter,fejmobh,t3_epccmd,1579180042.0,"I support everything but free college. Taxes are already taking a lot out of people’s pockets, so why make it worse? Instead, colleges should lower the cost of tuition. It’s makes no sense that it gets higher every year. Can’t do nothing about private colleges. They’re in their own little world. But public colleges, we can do something about."
Christianity,feiyw09,t1_feiym5q,1579151122.0,"I’ve been suicidal for most of my life due to shame of my sinful life. The issue with the community of Christians is that they rely too much on shame to make people turn away from their sinful lives. But as we can see, it doesn’t work. It drives us further from God and makes life seem hopeless in our eyes. When I talked to my mother about what I was struggling, she led me with understanding and didn’t shame me. That’s how I was able to get so far without giving up on life. If my mom can do it for me, I can only hope that I can do it for my children as well."
Christianity,feixryw,t1_feixbb5,1579150166.0,"If my future children decide for themselves that Christianity is not for them, then there’s not much I can do about that. I won’t force them to see things my way. It’s not my life. But if they decide to continue with Christianity then I have the right to convict, not condemn, their choices. I go by what the Bible says. We don’t get to choose what we like and what we don’t like. In the first few chapters of Romans, it talks about the wrongs of homosexuality. But like I said before, if my children decide to go down that path, it’s their life, not mine. It wouldn’t make me love them any less."
Christianity,feiwm1u,t1_feis3kf,1579149211.0,"Children are a gift from God. To cast them out in the streets for any reason would be like spitting in God’s face. Humans are naturally fallible. If you find that you can’t rely on your parents, know that you can always rely on God. He makes no mistakes, only masterpieces."

Christianity,fehi0ow,t1_fehhto3,1579116943.0,Maybe the woman didn’t fully believe that He could help her and was asking Him in order to see for herself. And it was not until He said what He said did she realize the truth and her heart changed. I don’t really know but maybe that was the case.

Christianity,feh1t1n,t3_ep4557,1579107367.0,Jesus wasn’t racist. Canaanites were Pagans. They didn’t believe in God. So He wanted to see if her faith was real.
Christianity,feh0rkj,t3_ep4imx,1579106735.0,"In order to create a new version of the Bible, it has to be at least 25% different from other ones. That’s why we have so many different versions and thats why they’re all very different. I’d recommend going back to the KJV Bible if you have questions. It may be hard to read but it’s one of the most accurate versions."
Christianity,fefwxhl,t3_eortt0,1579067906.0,"I personally would never do that to my future children. And I know my mom would never do that to me (I asked her). 
You can be gay and a Christian. Just like people can be liars, thieves, murderers and yet still Christian. But to call yourself a gay Christian is what’s wrong. I don’t call myself a lying Christian. People don’t call themselves cheating Christians. While we are all sinners, Christianity is where we let go of those labels and chains that tie us to this world and become new in Christ. I don’t really care if a person is gay or not. It’s not my life to live. But if you’re gonna call yourself a Christian then be a Christian.

Edited: I meant that I would never disown my future children over something like homosexuality or anything else. All sin is the same in the eyes of God. No sin is worse or better. So if you wouldn’t kick your child out for something like lying, why would you do it for anything else?"
