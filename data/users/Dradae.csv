Write down the names of the people you want to keep in touch with, and add a date behind them whenever you contacted them. Makes it easy to see if you've been in touch lately."

In essence it's a way to plan and log your days (plans, tasks, habits, thoughts, anything basically) quickly and efficiently, using ""bullets"" and a technique called ""rapid logging."" It's highly adaptable and flexible, with no specific material requirements, meaning you can change it to fit your needs right now.

Despite the original method being quite minimal, there is a significant part of the bullet journal community that uses their journal as a creative art outlet. Don't get discouraged by the intricate designs you see here, the method is actually simple and quick to pick up and use. If you want to have a highly decorated journal, that's perfectly fine, but it is in no way necessary.

Thus is the big sub that most people post to, and is therefore heavy in the artsy journal department. The other subs are r/bujo (more focus on the productivity aspect, more explanations how people use the system) and r/basicbulletjournals (only minimal journals, no heavily decorated art journals allowed)."
bulletjournal,fejo4p1,t3_ephxj6,1579181341.0,"I make pretty minimal daily logs. These are set up in just a few minutes. (write the header, list the appointments under there, add any priority tasks that need to be done today, and done.) Below that I use the rapid logging technique to note whatever comes up during the day. Some days are just one line, some days are multiple pages, whatever happens happens and that's okay.

Then I also do the monthly logs. These are slightly more decorated (read: use a coloured marker and do some fancy lettering, occasional doodles) whenever I have the time, or just plain pen when I don't. Usually I add a cover page that I can doodle or draw or make pretty whenever I feel like it. This is completely optional though, and some of them just stay empty, but whenever I do want to go all out and be creative, they are there for me to work on.

Besides that I include a monthly mood tracker (for mindfulness purposes, to reflect on my days and pause on the good things that happened), occasionally a habit tracker, and usually a catch all monthly task list to get the to dos out of my head and on paper."
bujo,feg3q8a,t3_eor2ma,1579075565.0,"I would definitely choose ease of use over ease of review. Can't review if you struggle to use it.

What I like to do is review and summarize my trackers during my end of month review. Basically count and score myself, and (very important) reflect on what went well, and how I can improve the habits that didn't go well."
bulletjournal,fe0ygvt,t3_enkyvy,1578820303.0,Something I noticed: you have only one good category and multiple bad ones. This might make you unconsciously choose a negative feeling to sum up your day more often and change your mindset. Just something to be aware of.
bujo,fdjn3rl,t1_fde4xhc,1578478927.0,"Could you elaborate a bit on the things you changed, and why? My notebook will be full in the next month, so I'm looking for great setup ideas at the moment."
BasicBulletJournals,fccupul,t3_eh2ubx,1577602860.0,"I hate to be wasteful too. I have about 40 pages left, so will start 2020 in my old journal. I will however add a 2019 review and a 2020 goals page to ""mark the occasion"" so to speak."
bulletjournal,fbtqjy0,t3_eecznn,1577090506.0,"I have some empty pages left, so I'll definitely add January in my current notebook, maybe even February."
