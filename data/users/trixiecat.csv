Health,ffj20rn,t1_ffhu0vz,1579988403.0,Same in the US. Also insurance coverage is terrible.
suggestmeabook,ffhjluw,t1_ffh2tfb,1579938238.0,Is it still good to read even after watching the show or will I get bored?
Health,ffhj85y,t3_etnmrl,1579937722.0,"I am a doctor and have OCD. They flatly do not train you in medical school how to distinguish suicidal or pedophilic INTRUSIVE thoughts (ego-dystonic) from actual desire to hurt self or have sex with kids (ego-syntonic). I honestly don’t think a lot of counselors know either. IMO I would only talk with someone about pedophilic OCD who is a trained OCD specialist, which I know is terrible because most people don’t have access to that. But I can see the same thing happening in the US very easily."
suggestmeabook,ffhdrdm,t1_ffh3n37,1579931144.0,It gets so brutal at the end. If you’re not into very hardcore BDSM the last one is just too much.
dogs,ffh78ma,t3_etd5f7,1579925072.0,Aww that face under the blanket!!  Hugs and pets to Goose!
puppy101,ffbiral,t3_eso7ti,1579767212.0,Did he get enough exercise?
nutrition,ff2as8x,t1_ff2a9zz,1579498983.0,They’re doing something about vegetarian wrong if that is their outcome. You can do vegan and vegetarian very badly if you don’t do hour research.
vegan,felrh4a,t1_fejta8t,1579229136.0,I’m a doctor. It’s a miracle if I can even get a patient to eat recommended servings of fruits and veg. Throwing a plant based diet at most of them is just asking too much at a time and they will tune me out. There is a rare receptive patient and in that one I do recommend full whole food plant based.
lgbt,feg1u2n,t1_fedv7a7,1579073278.0,That’s why I hate that deadnames are on charts but you have to put the name as it is on the insurance or billing doesn’t work.
lgbt,feg1rcw,t1_feedo4u,1579073193.0,"There is lots of lab monitoring for trans hormones. For testosterone specifically if you get ragingly high cholesterol or very abnormal blood counts form it you sometimes have to stop. If the patient wanted to continue at that point, I would refer to a trans specialist at that point but I don’t know if they’d feel comfortable with that risk either."
dogs,feg164c,t3_eouuar,1579072511.0,Yay Odin! Can we see a picture?
puppy101,fe6ni5w,t3_enyq9y,1578897064.0,My dog really likes the Starmark brand “Bob-a-lot” and “Bumper Body” toys. I put her breakfast in one and dinner in the other. Takes her 30-60 minutes depending on how many breaks she takes. They are the best!
Dogtraining,fe5zogx,t3_enw76v,1578878519.0,"My favorite is the [Wonder Walker](https://www.rover.com/blog/wonder-walker-dog-halter-harness-review/) 

They also make a leash I really like too."
puppy101,fe5yr0z,t1_fe5yil5,1578877932.0,"If refusing treats then it’s still too distracting. Go back one or two steps in distraction training, solidify that, then go to the next step.

Also exercising BEFORE training is good if you have an alternate way. Like drive her to the dog park for an hour, then come back and do the walk/training after she’s got some energy out."
puppy101,fe5wi2l,t3_enudk0,1578876509.0,We never did puppy food. Just puppy serving of adult food. I would just switch when the serving recommendations of the back of the dog food container stop. Most of them are around a year I think.
puppy101,fe5w5un,t3_env1j4,1578876295.0,"It’s SOOOO hard for us too in a similar situation. Almost every walk other than nighttime when less people and dogs are out is a training walk. Gotta work hardcore on stay and leave it. Always have treats on hand. Desensitize to areas walking back and forth a million times until not reacting. You have to notice all the bikes, runners, children, and dogs (those are what my girl runs to get at anyways) ahead of time and be prepped with treats in advance. I have my girl sit and stay if a super distraction like a kid on a scooter or running dog and just leave it with a treat in front of her nose for walking dogs. But I get out the treat when the distraction is 100-20 yards away and am prepared. I treat every 5-10 seconds and am working on increasing the interval. The really hard thing is the bike that comes from behind. If I’m not prepared she will probably lunge at the thing unless she’s busy sniffing something and distracted. Online training videos are really helpful. Also hiring a private trainer is helpful. But god those busy sidewalks on weekend days is really tough. Good luck!

Edit: forgot to add that I also periodically treat her for “good walking” with a loose leash and keeping pace with me. Show her what I like."

dogs,fe0sxdp,t1_fe0jjfg,1578818227.0,Great idea. Too bad my girl would be too scared of it to use it.
transeducate,fdpw9dm,t3_emibjx,1578643121.0,"To me it’s just how to track in my patients chart very easily and accurately what’s going on. FTM says a lot right there in 3 letters what they patient may want, explains why the name does match the gender on the chart, to be careful with my pronouns, and why they are “female” (-again stupid charting systems) on testosterone. I never have to ask them a question about it if not needed it’s all there. And because it’s stuck as a common practice in medicine to abbreviate that way it’s not gonna change anytime soon (at least for that purpose)."

Dogtraining,fdg7m9o,t3_ektmsu,1578383380.0,Also pay attention on a weekday how many dogs are there in how much space. Some I’ve looked at seems like there’s barely room to move let alone play.
aww,fdg6llx,t1_fdfb0wq,1578382121.0,Thank you. I hadn’t heard of an “outdoor only” dog before. This explanation helped.
lgbt,fdg6fk9,t1_fdfnhsx,1578381920.0,I learned the term in chemistry to mean “same sided” for a complex chemical bond. Trans means “opposite sides” or “across”.
orchids,fdg389q,t3_el4gri,1578378346.0,Gorgeous!  The orchid too
medicine,fd7zl2i,t1_fd5anbu,1578212241.0,The whole business model not just billing. Let’s give us all more patients per hour in addition to all this document for billing and CYA. Problem of our times is every business squeezes every employee for the max they can get out of them til they break. It’s not going well with any worker under that model.
vegan,fd7xl56,t1_fd7u55a,1578211525.0,"You can’t wash all produce with soap, esp leafy ones. Just rinsing may not remove all the bacteria. medical knowledge combined with OCD means bags for me"
Dogtraining,fd7x2ra,t3_ek7otb,1578211350.0,Crate training might help with anxiety. My anxious dog likes having her little safe room/crate at night.
labradoodles,fcwbge9,t3_ej3x1q,1578021538.0,My doodle sleeps like that regularly. Such a weird girl
samoyeds,fcwbd9u,t3_ej1pq0,1578021481.0,I think the dog steals the whole photo. Didn’t even look at the humans at first. Lol
puppy101,fbiwior,t3_edkdp4,1576917585.0,I like the Wonder Walker. Made by a local company in Seattle. Holds up really well. Had a ring to clip leash to in front or on back. Front clip makes pulling not as easy but definitely can still be done if the pup is determined. In my opinion harnesses aren’t a cure all for pulling. Got to do training walks for every walk all the time until they get it. Hiring a private dog trainer to teach me this for an hour was the best money I’ve spent.
