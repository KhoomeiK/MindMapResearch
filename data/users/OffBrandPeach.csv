trashy,ff4zsov,t1_ff4yy9v,1579576433.0,"exactly, this person was laughing about ""white people tears"" and stuff, but what if a white person were to say ""oh look at all these black people tears lol"" they'd be burned at the stake? why is it ok for people to make fun of white people because of their RACE which is racism, and it's ""cool"" or ""trendy"" to say that u hate white people, but with any other race it's wrong. i've been made fun of for being mexican countless times, sometimes i've been made fun of by other poc. poc can be racist and honestly this entire thing makes me mad lol. ur right"

trashy,ff1g8bk,t1_ff1520d,1579478734.0,just because he's a man doesn't mean he has to enjoy penetration. rape is rape and the teachers deserve to be in jail
trashy,ff125sf,t1_ff0zv55,1579474463.0,"""make an honest woman out
of her??"" ""starter wife?? "" what century are you living in? i'm not even gonna get into that, but it's statutory rape by law anyways, it's illegal either way. what kind of warped logic are you using? if your daughter gets raped , you'll absolutely resent the offender, but if your son gets raped, it's just ""oh haha congrats on getting laid, way to go!""  

why is it that when a woman gets raped, along with a lifetime of trauma, people are sympathetic and offer help, (as they should, that's the appropriate response) and go after the offender like a witch hunt? but when a man gets raped, along with a lifetime of trauma, people are all like
*""well at least he got some pussy, he should be grateful""*

congratulations! *you're part of the problem*!"

trashy,ff0wguk,t1_ff0tnv2,1579472928.0,"are you 12? this seems what like a 12 year old would argue. and honestly? teachers ""having sex"" with students is something that sounds like it's from a book, shitty fanfic, or porn. if and when it happens in real life? it's disgusting. a school should be a safe place and the teachers should be there to help you, not take advantage of you. and thank you for that story about your friend but nobody asked. even if he ""consented"" (which he legally couldn't if he was 14, minors can't consent) the neighbors wife is a pedophile for having sex with a 14 year old. this thread is giving me a headache"
trashy,ff0v5af,t1_ff0u5a0,1579472580.0,"so a teenage boy loses his virginity to another teenager, sure whatever. but an ADULT having sex with a MINOR is statutory rape *by law*. Teenagers will have sex with each other, I am one so I know how it works. However, a grown ass woman shouldn't even *think* about doing ANYTHING remotely sexual with a minor. end of discussion"
trashy,ff0u9lj,t1_ff0sina,1579472375.0,"even if he DID ""consent"" to it, it's statutory rape by law. damn these comments are making me lose faith in humanity. I'm a girl so i'm no expert on male anatomy but sixth grade sex ed taught me that when stimulated in certain ways, a penis will get hard. It's a natural response. In some cases, females who are raped orgasm when it happens even though they did not give consent. Why? because it's a *natural response* . rape is rape whether it happens to a male or female."
trashy,ff0td9j,t1_ff0pm3w,1579472077.0,"look, i'm no SJW but penetration or not, it's rape. it doesn't matter if his ""manhood is intact"" or if the teachers are ""hot"" they sexually took advantage of him without his consent (which he wouldn't even be able to give because he was a STUDENT and they are teachers- adults who are more than capable to know why this is wrong). Just because rape is different for male and females doesn't mean the damage is any different. trauma knows no gender. rape knows no gender. abuse knows no gender. If you had a son and this happened to him, ask yourself if you would look him in the eyes and ask ""bUt wErE thEY hOt ThoUGh??""

truly sit down for a minute and think about this, your comment is part of the problem"
trashy,ff0rdb5,t1_ff0o1jw,1579471588.0,"rape is rape, regardless of gender, the damage is the same. period. no questions asked."
