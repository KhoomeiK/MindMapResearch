Coming from someone who has bad social anxiety this has helped me immeasurably even buying fucking condoms lol"

FFVIIRemake,fcxu90z,t1_fcx5pmv,1578070582.0,"Agreed, but also...it IS a remake of a game that most of us in the sub (at the very least) have played multiple times and are just overjoyed with seeing our favorite moments in the OG come to life in the new game"

FFVIIRemake,fcuz8rh,t1_fcugq9v,1577991465.0,My thinking exactly. The images arent exactly spoilers they are out of context and fit with the og story. No one really knows the end or what will be happening in the new and expanded midgar
FFVIIRemake,fcuz381,t1_fcu0j3m,1577991379.0,Alot of assumptions here

FFVIIRemake,fcuyloh,t1_fctfxov,1577991116.0,"Yes, also tbese screenshots look like early versions of models. Possible that these classic moments are only a piece of the whole game since they are adding more content."

Berserk,fcuf9c9,t1_fcsvjhh,1577979540.0,I feel thats why the elf island training will be important. I think the only way would be removing griffith from access to his godhand powers or returning him back to his original form prior to transformation
anime,fcu8eze,t1_fcu6nfv,1577974996.0,Haha forreaal. Now its on hiatus just after the thing everyone has been waiting for
anime,fcu8a0n,t1_fcu62dm,1577974914.0,"I mean there are definitely more plot points then just Gon. Kurapika's arc has not ended just yet either, and you can argue Leorio"
anime,fcu85i0,t1_fctwb53,1577974834.0,Fucking Dragon Quest keeps holding him back...game is too good
anime,fcu7z46,t1_fcu28e9,1577974711.0,Yes but its such a slog to get through when there is soo many breaks. I would love to at least see the first big battle thst continues in the manga tho *spoilers*

AskReddit,fc03l83,t1_fbzz3wz,1577276898.0,"However. Diet soda does have more acids present which can actually hasten the rotting of your teeth. I did a science experiment on my own babay teeth as a kid, and found there was more significant damage done by doet diet coke as opposed to regular coke. Ive heard diet coke can actually have more cancer causing agents."
