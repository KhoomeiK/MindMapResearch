AskReddit,fet7zze,t1_feplpid,1579372589.0,"Funny you mention this.  I took my daughter to see them sometime around 2010-11 in Philadelphia.  LMFAO opened, and Ludacris was the middle act.  I enjoyed the BEPs even though I didn't know much of their music, and LMFAO was awesome....(I had never heard of them until that night).

I don't care for rap that much, but I thought I would listen to Ludacris with an open mind and see what it was all about.  Who ever worked his sound board should have been drawn and quartered on the spot.  The worst distortion of the vocals, with painful volume.  Not loud and strong.  Painful.  People were covering their ears.

Maybe where the sound engineer sat it sounded good, but it was horrible everywhere else.  I don't blame the artist or the genre for that, but it sucked.  I was disappointed that I missed a chance to hear a 'legit' rap act."

2.  They forbid the players from gambling, yet they support fantasy football and the injury reports are touted as 'for the fans', but they are for Vegas and the sports books.  I know, fantasy football is always for entertainment only, but still.

and an extra...

 Crap like this hit with Clowney.  They can review everything, but not a hit that results in a head injury?  Wentz should have stayed on the ground...."

Took 40 - 45 minutes between all the beeping and clicking and sensing to get a load done, and over half the time we had to re rinse everything because it did not use enough water to rinse.  Wash twice...not efficient or energy conserving in my book.  Some motor sensor finally died after 5 years and we bought a Speed Queen.  Fills completely with water no matter how little the load, take 20 minutes, and the spin cycle gets everything much drier.  It's a commercial grade, old school type of machine.  Awesome."
