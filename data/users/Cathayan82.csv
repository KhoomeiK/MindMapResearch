JapaneseFood,fdcedv6,t1_fdc9l4d,1578272848.0,"Usually Japanese ramen’s broth is either chicken (tori paitan soup)or pork bones ( tonkotsu soup) or both with addition perhaps dried sardines for more depth and umami.

You could also add miso into the broth for a different kind of flavor profile.
I like adding [pickles bamboo shoots (menma)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menma) 

 And I like adding [narutomaki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narutomaki) 
And bean sprouts too

Also boiling your eggs til it’s runny in the center is nice as well approximately about 6mins or so depending on the size of the egg and just shock it in an ice bath.

Drizzling a spicy sesame oil (rayu ) is nice as well unless you can find [Taberu rayu](https://umamimart.com/products/taberu-rayu) in your Asian grocer, it’s a garlic chili oil with flakes of chili and crunchy garlic bits, it’s great I eat it over with just plain rice and a boiled or fried egg 😁

If your unable to find the chili oil, here’s a [recipe](https://uncutrecipes.com/EN-Recipes-Japanese/Chili-Oil-Taberu-Rayu.html)  that I found that it’s pretty good if you wanna make it yourself 

Finally I usually add [chashu](https://www.justonecookbook.com/homemade-chashu/) as my choice of meat. 

I hope this helps 😁"
