ClickerHeroes,ff2nnl3,t1_ff2j0j4,1579515111.0,"Driej has the highest known HZE. He is currently at about 4.6m. Qubit and Toasty are right behind, although Toasty stopped playing around new years and Qubit has almost everything in the game scripted (ascending, fish clicking, hero leveling, etc). The reason non of them are seen as ""legit"" HZEs are because all of them either use merc listers, have it scripted, and all of them use a script that clicks fish for them. This way, rubies are not a problem, even though rubies are one of two things that can really slow you down in the endgame. LotharBorsh was at about 3.5m, but he doesn't play anymore."

ClickerHeroes,fen8txu,t1_fen8gja,1579279488.0,"How long have you spent in this ascension? And to which zone did you get before transcending? It's probably actually even more efficient to transcend now, take the ancient souls you get from it, and from there invest accordingly to the calc. The way you invested, transcendence power is basically the only thing that makes a difference from pre-trans. 1 pony does give x10 hero souls, but what you could get out of it right now, even if you couldn't transcend for any AS, is much more efficient invested correctly than like that. How long have you been on this transcension?"
ClickerHeroes,fen7vuv,t1_fen72fw,1579278902.0,"That is the zone you would get to if you invested in accordance to the calc. You would have 4 borb, which would speed up progression greatly. You would have 16 times more HS, from the ponyboy levels, and would probably take no more than 1 - 2 days."

ClickerHeroes,feeckzl,t3_eo9nwe,1579030975.0,"I used to think the same. I always leveled all of the super-outsiders enough for 100% chance, but in reality, 2mpz is so much more important.  With longer boss timers and lower boss health, you get max 100 zones further, which is nothing compared to 1. the zones you could get by investing those AS into borb, and 2. the zones you're already going to. For Rhageist, it also barely makes a difference. The only thing that can make a difference here is if you don't get primals for a few hundred zones before you ascend, but this is also not a lot looking at the zone you are at. Also, it doesn't matter how many primals you get in total, you will always get the same amount of HS on the same zone. No matter how many primals you have beat before. As for Sen-Akhan, the same accounts. You get gold depending on zone and nothing else, and, by not getting treasure chests the last few hundred zones, you are also only losing out on 100 zones **Max**. Remember, even if you could get potentially push a bit further through scaling, once you are above 2mpz, you want to transcend anyway. 

Borb is the only outsider that creates realistic progression in the end game."
