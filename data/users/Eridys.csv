aww,felekkv,t1_feldsrt,1579220332.0,"Yeah, the vet who spayed her did, since it was through a trap-neuter-release program, and I don't think the vet knew she was going to a home instead of the wild again. :( I wish they didn't do it, though."
aww,feldaev,t1_felcncb,1579219477.0,"We got her spayed through a trap-neuter-release group, and that's what they do to ferals who have been spayed/neutered. I doubt the vets who did the operation knew or cared that she was going to a home instead of back to the wild. :("
aww,felc0tg,t1_felbq2b,1579218638.0,Oh my gosh they could totally be twins! Super cute Lilly!

aww,felburo,t1_felbd6a,1579218526.0,"Probably the lighting? It looked fine when I took the picture but now that you mention it, yeah, there is a little pink tint on the pic on my computer screen...Whoops!"
aww,felbhvg,t1_felb0zg,1579218290.0,"As far as I know: Cat.

Jokes aside, we're thinking she's at least part Turkish Van, or something similar. I'm not entirely good with cat breeds so I honestly don't know. All I know is she's adorable and sweet and I love her."
aww,felamoo,t1_fel9gne,1579217720.0,"""Oh, this was YOUR seat? Well, not anymore! Purrhaps we could come to a bargain?"""
aww,felaj6e,t1_fel8tcp,1579217658.0,"She was definitely feral when we first saw her. She would SPRINT toward the woods if she even heard our sliding door open or our voices, and even for a while would growl at us if we were outside placing food for her. This took a lot of patience (and delicious treats) to get this far."
aww,fela97j,t1_fel9io5,1579217480.0,"Feral cats are strays, but born and raised in the wild. They're usually difficult to tame and train because they're used to being in the wild without human contact, but some (like Lilly and others) have taken to being pets and are good boys and girls."
aww,fel8apf,t1_fel7uyj,1579216225.0,Yep! We got her spayed through a cat trap-neuter-release program nearby that helped us out a lot.
aww,fel7ydy,t1_fel7807,1579216011.0,"Probably because she's still thin. We're still trying to de-worm her which will help her gain weight once all those leave her system, but it'll still take a while to put on the weight."
aww,fel5w0f,t1_fel4j53,1579214729.0,"Oh yeah, she definitely is enjoying the ""spoiled rich cat"" lifestyle. Especially since it's been freezing up where I live, and she no longer has to compete with 4 other feral cats who are easily 3 times her size/weight (she's 4 pounds, and the other cats we've seen on our outdoor camera were probably around 20 pounds. These guys were huge compared to her.)"
aww,fel4xqf,t1_fekys9i,1579214148.0,"Knowing me I probably did do something dumb before taking the picture, lol, so this is accurate."
aww,fekmw1y,t1_fekj4br,1579203362.0,"Food. We've been feeding her on our back porch for a few months before we brought her in. Dry all day and some very delicious and special food (chicken, fish, etc.) whenever we tried to work with her. Slow movements and soft voices so she didn't startle, and we took our time. Make sure you ONLY give your cat the ""good stuff"" when you're actively working with kitty, so he starts to associate good things with you guys.

Start by putting the food in a doorway or something and sitting off away. When he comes up to eat it, gently talk to him so he knows you're there, careful not to spook him, and over time slowly move the dish closer to you until he's comfortable with that. Then try offering the food out of your hands. Remember, progress takes time, so try not to force him into being petted our anything like that, or you may be set back a few steps!

Wish you all the best, and hope your boy warms up to you quickly! Kitty needs some loves too!"
IncelTears,fe9k0td,t1_fe9gzki,1578938509.0,"You know those little pocket mirrors they make? Yeah, you'd THINK it's so people can check their makeup, etc. in the go.

It's actually so that women can put the mirror under a man's nose. If it fogs up, he is BREATHING, and therefore he is BREATHING AT HER, and it is 100% reliable evidence in court.

aww,fdoseu2,t3_emdzwo,1578611833.0,I thought you meant 1/10 as a rating and was about to get angry. That puppy is at LEAST a 12/10!
aww,fdl7gjb,t1_fdl3jwc,1578518338.0,"I meant de-worming and de-fleaing, she still has her claws, don't worry."
aww,fdkr8f2,t1_fdkq1fu,1578509477.0,"I know. It's a horrible thing to do to poor kitties :(

I remember one of my cats as a kid was declawed, but at the time both my parents and I didn't realize how bad it actually was, it was just ""the thing to do to housecats"". But now we all know better, and I'll be damned if I ever do that to one of my future cats."
aww,fdkil3p,t1_fdkifi7,1578504544.0,Yes. I meant de wormed and de flead. I forgot that declawing was a thing!
aww,fdkifzm,t1_fdki3rd,1578504476.0,"Nope, she's still got them! We have a few scratching posts for her. But so far she's been gentle with her claws with us. Just hoping she's just as gentle with the furniture! XD"
aww,fdkhvk9,t1_fdkhjd0,1578504186.0,She's a shy sweetheart. I love her!
Target,fdcxm9l,t1_fdck0wd,1578287321.0,"It doesn't help that the platform on our wave is crooked, with a (slight) downward slant, so we kind of have to have two people or the larger TV's risk falling or VERY CAREFULLY balance while you get off the wave and pray it doesn't fall, lol."
Target,fdcx9rj,t1_fdcsp9s,1578287016.0,"Jay is another woman, and unfortunately she decided to ignore me when I asked (well, more like grunted, because big TV). I'm pretty sure she just doesn't like me anymore since I kept calling out her own team members (she's OPU, and I've called out a lot of her seasonals for being really untrained and breaking electronics keys, handing security items to guests, etc), but still, that's not really a good reason to not help out.

&#x200B;

And I totally get the whole ""if I ask if she wants help I'm intruding but if I don't I'm an asshole"" aspect, and I'm not one to get upset by that. If anything it's the opposite, and I see it as it's one less heavy thing I have to lift, lol."

Target,fdcdnwd,t1_fdccyp0,1578272354.0,"While I'm not the tallest, I always try to help out my team members whenever possible, even if it's just picking up some boxes that fell or whatever. It just baffles me when people just sit by and do nothing. It takes almost no effort to help someone and make their tasks just a little bit easier."
Target,fdcd17t,t1_fdcacty,1578271935.0,"Well you ARE a ""team"" member, right? Therefore it's a ""team lift"", duh!"

I've had these kinds of guests before and it gets me every time lol."
