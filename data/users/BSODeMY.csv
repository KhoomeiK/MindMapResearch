>Fascism is a far-right authoritarian ideology.

OK, but communism is also a far-right authoritarian ideology; the idea that there is, or ever has been, a large state where the ""people"" owned the means of production is simply a flat out fabrication. In fact, the Nazi system was closer to that ideal by simply being more laissez-faire due to it's short lifespan and the fact that it never did fully consolidate power at any point in it's lifetime than many communist regimes.

I know this doesn't look super credible but I found a picture that shows the relationship clearly (it seems accurate but it is missing a lot of the detail on what makes them different aside from the left vs right aspect, I will admit):

[https://www.quora.com/q/vxmtkioupwhbxefg/The-Left-Right-Political-Spectrum-Updated](https://www.quora.com/q/vxmtkioupwhbxefg/The-Left-Right-Political-Spectrum-Updated)

As you can see, Marxism and communism are actually very far removed from each other. Communism, in practice sits right next to fascism with the other socialist doctrines on the left-right scale.

&#x200B;

>It isn't contingent on the rise of socialism...

No, it is itself socialist and this means exactly that. That is not only philosophically true but also historically true.

Mussolini was a socialist his whole life and he came to reject communism because he rejected egalitarianism and saw it as a failed system. After being kicked out of the Italian Socialist party for trying to incite Italian participation in WWI, he later formed the fascist party which led the charge in WW2.

Look at WHY Mussolini was expelled from the Socialist party and you'll find that it essentially comes down to the fact that he supported the reality of communism while the party supported the communist ideology (which, at that point, meant he wanted them to support going to war). He even wrote a personal letter to Stalin at one point announcing that he had fixed the problems with Communism by inventing Fascism. He went on to say that the biggest flaw with Communism is that, while removing religion was important for authoritarian control of a population, the communist failed by only removing and not replacing religion. His solution was to make worship of the the state the new religion.

>Like, even the USSR had a degree of common ownership by workers.

Ya, the idea was you work all day, every day and give everything you produce to the government. Then you starve waiting for them to distribute enough of it back to you to survive long enough to do it again. You did get representation. Not direct representation or the ability to speak up about your conditions. Your company (that you were a slave to) was allowed to participate in government on your behalf. Which was perfect because that left you more time to work all day, every day. If you caught your brother complaining you'd even get a bonus and he'd get sent of to be re-educated.

Communist Russia, in reality, was managed as oligarchies always have been and so was Nazi Germany....and virtually every other communist or fascist country you can name. Actually, the idea goes all the way back to tribal systems.

&#x200B;

>what you were describing as a socialist state based on Marxist ideology isn't what Marx proposed.

I don't believe that a socialist state based on the philosophy of Marx is actually possible because it is not in any way practical; it is a fantasy. I think when we look at those who have tried we should all immediately see the inherent flaws. Which makes me just like a Nazi, I suppose. One big difference about me is that I don't think some other socialist plan is going to be better (with very few, small scale, exceptions) and that is because I don't see egalitarianism or laissez-faire capitalism as a failure. In fact, I see these as a huge successes that together provide balance to each other.

&#x200B;

>Fascism, socialism, and communism are not all the same thing. Your source also outlines it.

I'm not actually saying that they are *exactly* the same. What I am saying is that they are all very similar and the differences are mostly superficial after one takes power. Communism and fascism are both forms of socialism. Communist claim that they are egalitarians but the fact that communism remains a government of choice for places that otherwise look like modern day monarchies should tell you all you need to know about that.

>studies indicate that authoritarianism is more prevalent among the right wing.

That's axiomatic (see previous image), the problem here is that right wing doesn't mean conservative and it doesn't mean Republican; it means, ""people who lean authoritarian"". If one guy thinks that we should force a bakery to make a gay wedding cake and another guy has a confederate flag flying from his tailgate on one side and a live free or die one on the other (all else being equal) the first guy is more right wing and also likely to be more liberal. That's always a ugly combination in my book."

TheRightCantMeme,ffde10d,t1_ffd9dwf,1579818905.0,"I don't want to knit pick each of these statements again but I do want to make sure that you understand that facism is, in fact, socialism economically speaking. Read the description here:

https://www.thebalance.com/fascism-definition-examples-pros-cons-4145419

Also, a quote from the Wiki page:

  > In general, fascist economies were based on private property and private initiative, but these were contingent upon service to the state.

The fact is that it was essentially socialism where private individuals own property but that property was always ultimately controlled by the state in practice. This is essentially EXACTLY what the Bernie types mean when they use phrases like ""social democracy"". Honestly, Bernie is sometimes more communist and sometimes more facist but that simply goes to show how similar they both ultimately are.

As for Trump, I don't like him as a person and I did not vote for him but I think he is actually crushing it as a president. If he wasn't such a scumbag I would probably be a huge fan. I think he does have a strange love for evil bastards. At the end of the day his support is absolutely based with people who lean against authoritarianism and I highly doubt he's ever going to find another group in this country who would go for it and support him at the same time. 

IDK, what your background is but, take my word for it, the Christian bible is essentially a long diatribe about how authoritarian dictatorships are bad news. Which is why both communists and fascist always get rid of that ASAP once they gain control.

If I saw DT as capable of implementing some sort of authoritarian coop then I would maybe worry but I think that the truth is that DT just doesn't like the inconvenience of answering to others. I think he's already wondering why he gave up a full time country club lifestyle for the White House (even if he's only there part time).

I could provide countless examples of how this worked but, honestly, it's all in the name. The ""Nazi party"" was a shorthand form of a German phrase which translates to, ""National Socialist Party"". They knew exactly what they were saying, this is the birthplace of Karl Marx, after all. 

Also, the government completely controlled all industry in Germany down to individual hiring decisions. That was the wartime economy. Did you not see Schindler's List? That would've been a much shorter movie if it weren't for all of the armed soldiers storming in to make sure he was doing things the way the Nazi party wanted.

I actually did say that the Nazi party (and neo-Nazis) were terrible but your having trouble distinguishing someone who doesn't think everyone who is racist is a Nazi from a Nazi from a neo-Nazi. Think for a second how screwed up that is. 

I also never said Bernie was equivalent to Hitler (or whatever you were saying); I said that equating the Nazi party with everyone you see as racist is no more accurate than calling every socialist a Nazi. If you're going to paint with that broad of a brush then that is a completely accurate statement.

For the record, I don't think Bernie is the next Hitler...but I do think that if he got his way we'd soon meet the next Lenin and after that the next Stalin. Lenin made short work of the Bernie types once he gained power. By taking advantage of a system where idealist already did all of the hard work for him.

TheRightCantMeme,ffcuh1w,t1_ffcrsau,1579807504.0,"Sorry, hitting posting limits. The reason that this is an important distinction is because the same people who don't see the difference are the same people who don't 'get' fascism and exactly what's wrong with it. They don't understand that the real evils of fascism don't stop at racism and they don't begin there either. After all of the Jews were dead it would still be a horrible situation. The problems actually begin at its authoritairian socialist roots. A neo-Nazi is almost never a socialist but a Nazi most definitely is. Despite the revisionist version of history that many leftists would like you to believe, being a socialist makes you more Nazi than being racist. Hitler had at least as much agreement with Bernie Sanders as he does with Stonetoss.
