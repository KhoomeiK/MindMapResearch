Some muggleborn kids didn't even get their Hogwarts letter at all. We see Dean Thomas on the run in the forest and the whole mini-industry of ""snatchers"" trying to find people who should be in school but aren't. Also, several of the teachers were unqualified murderous nutters who only taught them dark spells, and they probably never got around to final exams, OWLs, or NEWTs. Pretty sure the whole next school year was a clusterfuck for the entire community. Either half the school repeated a year, or the ministry did a giant handwave and passed them all."

To see what the writing is going to say.

And if it says 'William', we'll up and be gone,

A couple of soulmates just running away.

Two lovers like us can't be broken apart

By family feuds started decades ago.

I wait in my room with my hand on my heart

To see on my skin what I already know.

And 'William McGee' is the name that appears.

I smile and look down for my enemy's name.

I gasp and turn pale, overwhelmed by my fears,

For 'William' it says, with the surname the same.

Could Old William, Senior, be on to our plan?

I picture his face with a soul full of hate,

The murderous patriarch loved by his clan.

No matter, I think, because he'll be too late.

I run to the window to wave at my love.

I whisper 'I'm coming' and throw down a rope.

Then climb down three stories and land from above

Upon William's horse with a flickering hope.

I turn back to kiss him and show him my wrist.

""It's you!"" I cry out. ""Now let's go catch that boat!""

He touches his lip at the spot I have kissed

Then mutters, ""I'm sorry"" while slitting my throat.

Betrayal and blood stain the snow on the ground.

With tears in his eyes he lets loose with an oath.

Before I can perish, he spins me around.

He shows me his arms and my name is on both."

rant,fewrhxm,t3_eqokti,1579418409.0,"I think there's a difference between an adaptation and a reboot. An adaptation has more of an expectation that they will find actors who fits the description in the source material. Audiences like to see the characters on screen as they imagined them in their heads. But some producers are more detail minded than others. It depends what physical attributes you consider ""iconic"". People don't usually care if a character had blue eyes in the book and brown eyes in the movie, for instance. But the Weasleys in Harry Potter are often mentioned as having fiery red hair, to the point where it's tied to their family identity, a unique feature by which others know them. So it would be really noticeable if they had black hair in the movies. I've never read Deadpool, so I don't know if Domino's pale skin was important to who she was. But a very talented actor will often be able to make up for not fitting the exact physical description of a character by acting the personality so well that fans forget about what they're supposed to look like.

A reboot is not bound by the same rules as an adaptation. In a reboot, you can change whatever details you want. In fact, people might complain if you don't change enough things. So usually there's no reason a character can't be a different race. It's only a problem if it messes up the story in some way. I think The Little Mermaid is in a gray area here because of her relationship with Prince Eric. In the time period when the Disney version took place, it would have been considered unusual for a white prince to be dating a black woman. But in the reboot, it may be a different time period, or Prince Eric might be black, too. There are some reboots that have made a conscious choice to match the aesthetic of the original, to dress the characters similarly and hit some of the same famous shots, and in that case having a protagonist look dramatically different can be jarring. But most reboots are looking for a fresh new take on a character. The Disney live action remakes of Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin were criticized a bit for not adding anything new to the animated version, so I think the people behind The Little Mermaid might be looking to make more modern changes."

Maybe try to have a conversation with her when you are both feeling calm where you explain that you deserve to have a proper college experience just like your classmates, including the right to slack on little stuff. Part of being away from your parents for the first time is staying up late talking to friends and not getting eight hours of sleep every night, not vacuuming, spending a semester's worth of food dollars in half a semester, wearing wrinkly clothes, or whatever other mild acts of rebellion that won't kill you that you'll learn from eventually.

Flatmates originally told me I could travel with them at fall break, but later said they didn't want me to come because I wasn't that close of a friend. Just generally a tough period of life.

I went to protests, libraries, poetry slams, lectures, folk dance classes, film nights, you name it. I dated a nice British guy. My mind grew.

I am moderately interested in what these other Janets could represent. My theories so far:

Plaid Janet: Someone pointed out that her clothing has dogs printed on it. She could be Animal Janet, in charge of a realm of dead animals because of diminished moral responsibility. All dogs go to heaven?

Pink and blue Janet: She kind of looks like a school teacher. Maybe there's a special part of the afterlife for people who died as children or babies, because they can't be held as responsible for their actions. We've never seen any children in the afterlife so far. So: Teacher Janet.

Black and white outfit Janet: They look very serious. Maybe they help the judge out or something.
