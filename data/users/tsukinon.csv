nosleep,fe8u6v3,t3_enxayw,1578930940.0,"So Cage 1 is “Fred” who is claiming hinting that he is Jack the Ripper and the Zodiac killer.  Told OP he would ""make a smoothie from (his) tendons.""  Jack the Ripper claimed to have eaten one of his victim’s kidneys.

Cage 2 is “Cassie” confirmed to be not human and fed human meat.  OP theories a siren or succubus.  u/Whitey0057d also theorized siren.

Cage 3 is “Earl,” who seems to be hinting he’s Samson with the reference to Delilah, but he incorrectly claimed to be from Nazareth, possibly because he confused Nazarene (from Nazareth) with Nazarite (someone who took a sacred vow, which was the source of Samson’s power).  Also not allowed hair balm, but has a large mustache. 

Cage 4 is “Mary” who claims to be a Greek Orthodox nun born in 1883.  No real theories in her identity.  u/OurLadyoftheTree5d pointed out that she’s Hastur, her diety, is Lovecraftian.

Cage 5 is “Chad.”  His information is consistent with Ted Bundy (well-dressed, same birth year and place, and was executed for murdering multiple women, which is definitely “trouble with women.”  (u/KillingMyself-Softly figured that out.)

Cage 6 is “Bob.”  He has coins over his eyes, so possibly a reference to Greek mythology?  (Courtesy of u/Lemmegetahenyai7d)

Cage 7 is Lisa who was probably Abigail Williams (born in 1681).  She and her cousin Elizabeth “Betty” Parris were two of the girls whose accusations started the Salem Witch Trials.  (u/vjdarktm9h made the Salem connection.). An imaginary friend Mr Abba and a teddy bear named Bezel.  Possible references to Abaddon and Beelzebub?

Cage #8 is “Bill,” limited info.

Did I miss anything or forget to credit anyone’s theory? 

It could be a mix of dead murderers (or at least, people who caused the deaths of others, in the case of Samson and Abigail) and supernatural creatures.  Alternatively, could it be that famous murderers in history were either possessed by  supernatural creatures or became supernatural creatures as punishment, like a sensible?"

Not sure about “Mary.”  Prince Phillip’s mother, Princess Alice of Battenburg (a great-granddaughter of Victoria) was born in 1883 (not 1885) and became a Greek Orthodox nun, but she looked after the poor and was even awarded “Righteous Among Nations” for sheltering Jewish refugees during WWII, so she would be the exact opposite of the others.

I would also tell men who are nitpicking her story and poking holes in it they’re being jerks.  

Since this is told from the guy’s perspective and he’s saying he got a racist rather than rude vibe off her, I’m going to also assume that there was more to the situation than just what was said and, as a a POC, he’s more attuned to racist behavior and should be given the benefit of the doubt as opposed to trying to poke holes in his story and add extra facts or speculations.
