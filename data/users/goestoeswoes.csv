AskReddit,ffqthy8,t3_euq3co,1580143282.0,"My neighbor growing up. He overdosed and died. He really was making amazing progress. He was in rehab. His parents were shit. His mother did drugs along side with him. And his father was a lost cause. He got mono and his girlfriend brought him back to his home, where he had access to the drugs. I drove past him that night as I was returning home. He was at his car in the street. I didn’t want to bother him. But my intuition was to stop and talk to him and invite him over to catch up and really talk to him and have him stay over. But I didn’t listen to my intuition. I just pulled into my driveway and kept on keeping on. Next morning I woke up to the sound of ambulances only to walk out of my house and watch them try and fail to revive him. If I had gone through with my intuitive thoughts he probably wouldn’t have died because he wouldn’t have been around the drugs while he was so sick. Definitely weighs on me. He was an ass. But he was a good person. He just didn’t stand a chance with the so called support system he had. I think about it and him all the time."

Letting kids who are already pretty up there is not going to stunt them.

AskReddit,ff4d91j,t1_ff4bnr4,1579560870.0,"Most problems that people have in their lives are their own fault. Whether it be directly or indirectly. And by accountable I am speaking in terms of it being indirectly. A lot of the time people will spend more time blaming the cause of their troubles on the direct cause of it instead of holding themselves accountable for not doing what they needed to do to get away from their troubles. If you aren't taking responsibility for yourself in that way then you aren't getting away from the troubled which means you aren't giving yourself the room to grow and improve yourself. 

For example. My Aunt is a bitter woman because of her childhood. She is mean to people and stirs up drama and doesn't hold herself accountable because she is resentful towards the struggle she had to go through in her teenage years. She's always going to be that way and she never does any work on herself to improve her state of mind. However, she could have done things to get herself out of her situations when she was younger. And instead of saying ""yeah, I could have done this"" all she does is focus on how everyone ""did"" this and that ""to her"". Yes, these people did these things to you. But you could have also done things for yourself. She'll never grow out of that resentful and bitter state of mind because she refuses to hold herself accountable to a certain extent in her own struggles. 

Another example in a smaller form. A coworker has grown bitter, petty and unhappy at work because she is not receiving the hours she needs to be able to pay her bills the way she would like. The reason she is not receiving that many hours I'd because she isn't performing the way her superiors need her to perform to have a swiftly functioning work atmosphere. She still goes out partying. And doesn't want to give that part of her piece up to save money. So instead she grows resentful at work for not receiving the money. She stays at her job and doesn't hold herself accountable for working harder. And doesn't hold herself accountable for partying. She just shows up to work, makes a little money and is bitter and rude to her other coworkers. She could be doing things to help herself, but she's not holding herself responsible. There's no growth. No room for improvement."

Hasn't anyone every taught you the concept behind not worrying about anyone else behavior but your own? If your friend decided to start doing heroin, would you? Just cause she's doing it? You have an opportunity to be a genuine person here. And you aren't taking it. Doesn't matter what she's up to. And I also am still calling bull on it. You are young, I can tell. You don't know much about life yet. You still probably don't even understand the extent of your emotions yet. Just give the damn water bottle back and stop being childish."
AmItheAsshole,fezvotf,t1_fezupuf,1579462263.0,"You're probably lying in that last response. If she were using her things with her new boyfriend you probably would have mentioned it in the post and would have been a main justification from the beginning as to why you feel you shouldn't have to give it back. So I call bullshit on that. It's a lie. Based off of the fact that you would dates your friends ex, someone you've known since you were 4 and that you are being selfish enough to not give it back because you can't afford one on your own and can't find one with the same cover shows that you do not have a strong moral code and don't value your friendship with her. Which means it's highly likely that you will make up a lie to make yourself sound better just so you can feel better about wanting to keep that water bottle. If you even have to mention that you can't afford one or get one with the same cover goes to show what your true intent here really is. Stop being selfish. Be a good friend. Give it back. Get over yourself. And go to a damn thrift store. If you are living off 25 a month off savings and can't afford to buy a new one for yourself that is not your friends problem. That's your problem."
AmItheAsshole,fezu8kr,t1_feztcji,1579461722.0,"You two shouldn't even be friends with each other. You have a highly toxic dynamic. And from the sound of it neither of you have any real respect for each other. You using the water bottle is disrespectful to her as a friend. Her wearing a shirt you gave to her is not disrespectful towards you. You demanding it back would make you an indian giver. No woman leaves something like that behind with her ex so his new girlfriend can use it. 

You opinion in pettiness and jealousy is not valid what so ever because you do not have sound judgement in the matter. At all. Bad, bad bad judgement. Just give it back and stop being like this. Stop defending yourself and justifying. You are being TA here big time. That's why you came here.  If you were looking for people to tell you that you were right you came to the wrong sub. Try r/rant that might be a better place for this kind of thing. But you may get the same responses there as well."

AmItheAsshole,fezs2de,t1_fezrrl9,1579460920.0,Exactly. And not as gross as demanding she give her an item as replacement for compensation. And then go as far as saying that is a fair compromise. WHAT? That's indicative of some kind of Cluster B personality disorder and it's palpable.
AmItheAsshole,fezrhhs,t1_fezr43v,1579460717.0,Little Mog just be a better person. Demanding that she give something back is not a compromise. You are in no position to even expect compromise in this  situation. She owes you absolutely nothing. Stop using her thing and throwing it in her face.

You aren't biased. You're probably more feminist than these women you are talking about are.

Can't blame the kid for his parents not teaching him how to say sorry at that age. Maybe he didn't realize the extent to the situation. He's a child. And your mother is a grown woman. 

There's no reason to give a child the death stare. If it were an adult, sure. And then let the yelling commence. Because adults know better. But whatever age you are you should probably know that you can get better results from a child that age if you reacted differently. It's not like he did it on purpose."

AskReddit,feytyj0,t3_eqxzxu,1579450478.0,"I had this friend who dissapeared off the face of the earth basically. His sister never said much about what he was up to. We were all part of the friend group. The friend group wasn't thr best friend group. It was filled with a bunch of incredibly toxic people. All friends for superficial and self serving reasons. 

One day this friend was at a pre fourth of july party. We were never even close friends, just mutual. But there he was. So I was happy to see him there. Of course I didn't want to pry or anything. But we struck up conversation and hit it off. 

I never asked. Never even mentioned so much as a ""where have you been, what have you been up to"". Because that's rude. It's his life and he can do what he pleases with it. There's more to life then having superficial friendships. And I guess he sensed that. And so he opened up to me and told me that he tried to commit suicide and he's been in recovery trying to rebuild his life again. It was painful for me to hear. But I felt his pain greatly. This was before I was able to hone in on my empathetic side the way I can today. So I knew there was pain in him I just didn't know how to label it as pain or what it leads to. He told me alot that day and I felt it all."
