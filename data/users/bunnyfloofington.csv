aww,ff3tvv7,t3_ercxq7,1579548747.0,My bf claimed he isn’t a dog person and doesn’t like them. He couldn’t say no when he saw a pic of our puppy before we adopted him and he is always cuddling him every chance he gets lol

instantkarma,ff247bg,t1_ff1ticn,1579493343.0,"My little sister was big into hitting and head bashing. I would try to hug her and she’d head butt me in my teeth. So instead of getting mad at me for hitting back eventually, she finally made a rule where You were allowed one free hit if you got hit by the other sibling. My dad took a while to get on board with it, but my sister eventually stopped head butting me lol"
holdmycosmo,ff221dv,t3_eqzzr1,1579491678.0,"One time a friend of a friend I was at a steve aoki show with got us in touch with Borgore and we hung out with him after his set. He took us on stage during steve aoki and Steve’s manager wanted to offer us up to get caked. Being young and in the moment, we definitely agreed to do it, but Borgore stopped us and told us how much it sucks getting caked and convinced them to cake some other people instead. Fun times."
WatchPeopleDieInside,ff1znek,t1_ff1s44j,1579489929.0,"One time in middle school I choked on a mozzarella stick. I was literally in the school cafeteria surrounded by my closest friends all talking to me and each other. Not a single one of them noticed me almost dying 2 feet in front of them. I literally didn’t say anything after tho bc I was too embarrassed. To this day, none of them know (or they knew and didn’t care idk)."

insanepeoplefacebook,ff008xo,t1_fezz5pn,1579463743.0,"Yeah most kids complained but I personally didn’t notice much of a difference in the pizza or fries lol. They did get rid of all the pop and energy drinks though my senior year, which ticked everyone off more than the food changes"

ADHD,fezv730,t3_eqs2j7,1579462081.0,"I have a few problems for job hunting:

1. I don’t have a degree yet and have had to make changes in my career path I was working towards bc of a semi-recent disability that I’ve been battling. So since most jobs post that they need 5 years of experience specifically doing that exact job, I don’t apply to them bc I don’t think they’ll even look at my resume. Ya know since I don’t have that exact amount of experience they want. I get super discouraged.

2. I know I make a lot of little stupid mistakes in anything I do. So I get scared to apply to anything that I’m qualified to do, but I don’t want to fail so I won’t even try.

3. When I do overcome those two obstacles above, I tend to fuck up the interview easily by not always staying on top of myself and saying the wrong things. If I lose focus for even a second, I say the wrong things and ruin the whole impression they have of me."
insanepeoplefacebook,fezu308,t3_eqwyje,1579461667.0,"I graduated HS in 2011. I’m not sure when it became mandatory for all those lunch changes or what exactly they entailed, but we definitely still had pizza and fries. They just used healthier ingredients and got rid of trans fats. I remember we had a snack room with desserts like cookies, ice creams, and healthy chip options. Then the main room that had things like pizza, fries, burgers, and other options I don’t remember bc I didn’t eat them. And the third room was for chicken tenders, fries, more pizza, and a ton of drinks. I lived on pizza and fries all through high school til graduation."

lookatmydog,fel2yvw,t3_epbwtt,1579212933.0,That’s no 10yo! That’s a baby pupper. And you can convince me otherwise
food,feixruq,t1_fehjwh6,1579150163.0,I’ve never lived anywhere but Michigan and can honestly say you are 100% correct about that. I refuse to eat pizza or fries without ranch. And the ratio has to be right. You can’t have just a tiny bit of ranch on a mouthful of fries. You have to diligently dunk those fuckers in to really get the right flavor

Rabbits,fefw34z,t3_eota3u,1579067091.0,"Pro tip: always keep a bag of critical care on hand in the freezer. It lasts a super long time that way and that way if you ever start noticing any early signs of possible stasis, you can give your bun critical care and some baby gas drops until you can get into the vet for the rest of the meds (:"
LushCosmetics,fefsrtd,t3_eosw0g,1579064098.0,I’m about to be making my lush order for vday with my xmas gift cards I got. But I honestly have to say I’m very disappointed they didn’t release the Tender Is The Night scent again this year. That was my all time fave last year and I wish I had stocked up on the shower gel when I could. I also wish they came out with more than a few new things for Valentine’s Day. :/

insanepeoplefacebook,fefl8ke,t1_fef7fdd,1579058710.0,I literally suck at mental math so much that no one ever could get past me. And that’s only bc I wasn’t afraid to admit that I got confused with the extra bit of change added in and would make them wait as I pulled out a calculator to add it all up first. Then do it about 2 or 3 more times. I didn’t give a fuck if there was a line either. Everyone would get irritated at the person throwing in extra change and not me.

buncomfortable,fe97yok,t3_eo4ylh,1578935167.0,My bun is the same way. She doesn’t cuddle the vacuum so much as she cleans it and climbs on it. She likes to play chicken with it when it’s on sometimes too if she’s feeling brave.

service_dogs,fe2f85k,t3_en7c81,1578837733.0,"My girl does NOT appreciate when I need to leave her at home. But there are definitely places that she shouldn’t come with me. Like we went to the zoo one night for the Christmas lights. She was upset she had to stay home, but I didn’t want the animals getting stressed out bc of her there. And some movies I’ll leave her home for if they’re going to be really loud or something."

Awwducational,fds6riy,t1_fdqnwu0,1578695622.0,"I used to help the squirrels out when my puppy would dog them up. Since my puppy can’t be eating those black walnuts, I’d let him dig them up mostly, then I’d pull them out and stick them on the back fence.

AnimalsBeingBros,fds6f6m,t1_fdrnols,1578695402.0,That’s what we told him. No need to just “see how it goes” when you’re feeling like that for so long. It’s not worth it.
AnimalsBeingBros,fdq6sxp,t3_emj7lk,1578657340.0,"Dogs are so intuitive. My mailman at work was sick the last 4 weeks and almost died. He thought it was just the flu and was pushing through it. Apparently one night his new GSD puppy was making these crazy noises from her crate and so he got up to check on her. He made it to her crate and collapsed on the floor. His wife rushed him to the hospital and he had a terrible bacterial infection in his lungs. And the entire time he’s been recovering, his puppy hasn’t been doing the typical play bites that cut up your hands. She’s been the sweetest girl ever since then."
