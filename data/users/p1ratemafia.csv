aww,fedmv31,t1_fedlw65,1579015389.0,"He.  

Inca is a delight and a terror. Most people get pets like this and think they look pretty or fun.... but they are constant work, rewarding work but still work.  Changes your life having a bird that needs as much stimulation and social interaction as a small child.  Also vet bills are expensive.  Inca had an emergency and the trip ended up costing me nearly 2k...

I literally take a million photos of him... but I’ll stop.... after this: https://imgur.com/a/G58OPeP/"

aww,fedf38u,t1_fedejqf,1579009780.0,"Yeah, I generally hate on people like the dude Up above saying birds shouldn’t be pets, but breeders like this give aviculture a bad name.

Here, have some photos of my Birds.  Yesterday was my one year anniversary of getting Inca (Yellow, green, and white burb) from the rescue.https://imgur.com/a/S7pkJIy/

All of those birds are adopted.  I do have a cockatiel that I raised from a chick, but I have made a concerted effort to adopt.  I have experience training and rehabbing so I can give angry bords a better chance."

No /s, you did good."

aww,feddyin,t1_fedda9s,1579008842.0,"Na, this seems to be pretty unethical behavior.  I am a bird guy and have three parrots.  While I think the guy up above is wholly wrong about having birds as pets, basically whomever is doing this is stressing the fuck out of some birds.  Also, this has to be multiple clutches of birds, so if I had to guess, I would think this breeder is way overproducing.  Both Jenday and Sun Conures are way over represented in Rehabbers and rescues (usually because of their noise).  There is no reason to be breeding babies like this."
aww,feddkd6,t1_fedadf6,1579008511.0,"My caique lived in a conure rescue before I got him... every once in a while he paces a little, clears his throat, and belts out a sun conure scream that could destroy gods ear drums...  it’s terrifying."

worldnews,fe8eeyt,t1_fe8d3yb,1578925246.0,"That says “especially”. 

It adds that qualifier because it is NOT required.  A strike targeting, oh, say “cultural sites” or even the threat there of, could be considered terrorism.  

Terrorism is the threat or act of violence in pursuit of political or social aims.  This is often targeted at civilians (soft targets) but does not preclude military targets (see: Fort Hood)."

I am assuming they are with this crew, but even if they don't the training opportunity this fire presents (during our off season) is worth more than any amount we could pay."
peopleofwalmart,fchretk,t1_fc5ddvr,1577653295.0,Which they do because our government subsidizes the cost of milk and cheese production and artificially deflates the cost.  The tariffs protect their farm economy from an artificial price point created by the US.
