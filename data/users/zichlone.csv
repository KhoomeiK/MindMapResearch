There are also always on dash cameras that operate off a built in battery. We also don’t know that this car wasn’t on and the occupant is the one that witnessed the save and decided to upload it."
WTF,ffo68t2,t1_ffnzgd6,1580074524.0,If you want discipline then you’re going to do something that requires discipline like drill and ceremony. Long ass marches are about endurance.

Oh man that would be nice. Instead my job barely pays me enough to get by even though I excel consistently and offers me shit health insurance."
SelfAwarewolves,ffipbjy,t1_ffiimzk,1579979360.0,"I got the data from Zip Recruiter which is a job posting service. According to them that is the national average for a yearly salary.

SelfAwarewolves,ffip4oe,t1_ffiji4l,1579979226.0,On the ground EMTs make like $15 an hour. It’s one big ole profiting scam.
PS4,ffig8fp,t1_ffi9wxi,1579973134.0,"I don’t really feel like that’s entirely the case. I feel Microsoft got things right 30 years ago and has been living off that high ever since. They’ve benefitted greatly from a very apparent lack of competition leading to a de facto monopoly and huge library of software exclusivity. They have also leveraged their position to force some rather unscrupulous deals. 

In the sense of pure capitalism they’re doing great but I would say they’ve had a sizable amount of flops."
PS4,ffhxyxo,t1_ffhxtjw,1579958741.0,Yep. Between patents and manufacturing capabilities and scale there are a surprisingly low number of manufacturers that make most of the parts for all electronics.
SelfAwarewolves,ffhweuj,t1_ffhgvnr,1579956932.0,I know it’s a joke but the average salary for an air ambulance pilot is ~55k so they paid their entire salary with that one flight. In order to be making that kind of money they would have to be an air ambulance exec!
PS4,ffhug4d,t1_ffhtlf2,1579954441.0,Microsoft has a history of completely ignoring their customer base and failing miserably. It doesn’t even feel like innovation but a bunch of half baked schemes equivalent to googles hunt for a chat app.
PS4,ffhu75k,t1_ffhsc3o,1579954102.0,You should hear about how much money Samsung makes from just about anybody using flash memory or lithium batteries. Apple uses tons of Samsung products in their phones.
KitchenConfidential,ffhis7g,t1_ffh8xrl,1579937139.0,"Couldn’t that just be a confirmation bias? Tons of restaurants end up failing every year regardless of their pricing due to a multitude of factors including just bad luck. 60% of new restaurants fail within the first year and 80% before their fifth anniversary. 

A good example of a well known restaurant that pays their employees well is In-N-Out. They could easily hike their prices with zero effect on their business as they offer a great product and fantastic service."

UpliftingNews,ffh6axq,t1_ffh5tq7,1579924304.0,They don’t understand it. They think because the other people are also paying they deserve it too. They don’t realize those same people they don’t want to pay for are already being payed for by tax dollars via Medicaid expansions or tax credits on the marketplace. So they hamstring themselves for some weird principle that doesn’t hold water.
KitchenConfidential,ffh5jk2,t1_ffg72ol,1579923702.0,See I have a problem with this excuse. I don’t not go to a good restaurant because it’s 3% more expensive then the competition. The only way this would apply is if your restaurant didn’t have anything to offer other than its pricing. If you’re offering good food and good service you’re gonna survive a minor price hike.
