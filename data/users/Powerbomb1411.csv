marvelstudios,ff48pso,t1_ff44vgq,1579557982.0,Batman and regular people are two completely different examples. Batman knows they'll escape and can come back to life. Beating them to a pulp and throwing them in a cell and expecting a new result is insanity and makes him the real villain.
dogs,ff1zohs,t3_er09c4,1579489951.0,"Meet the dog and ask them about the policy. No respectable animal shelter will just adopt the dog out. Sure she's 5 now, but you're different than you were. I say this because of the following. 

I just got my first dog. I'm still fostering, she has to have a few things accomplished before I can sign the papers and adopt her. It's not even the dog I wanted. Her personality didn't mesh with what I MIGHT want in the future.

Turns out, she's broken just like me.

*Her hips Hurt. I ache too.
*She needs a knee surgery.
*She needs to lose weight. I need to lose weight. 
*She doesn't care for kids. I don't have any, but I want the option open.
*She's her own dog. I've mastered being single.
*She likes to cuddle. I do to.

After having her about a week and a half. She's the greatest decision I've made. I knew I was ready get a dog once I realized it'd take care of me and not the other way around.

My decision to get her is working as planned. She's taking care of me by forcing me to better my own health. I have to get up, I have to go outside, I have to eat, I need to make safe and smart choices.

I have wyze in my home. She's laying down very quiet most of the time, a few barks when a car is near people are talking. No accidents either, but it's cool if it happens. I have IBD, accidents happen."

dogs,fej5hnu,t1_feiece9,1579157689.0,"She can definitely stand, rarely run and walk without problem. But you can see the struggle getting up and down.

I'm not looking for medical advice. I'm dealing with that. I'm looking for advice on getting her trained. I can't just let her do whatever she wants in the meantime. She needs to learn also. Vets don't necessarily know how to train though. That's what I'm looking for help with. That's what I'm not having success with."
