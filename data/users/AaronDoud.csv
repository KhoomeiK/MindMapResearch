digitalnomad,ffe7lui,t3_et1cg5,1579838866.0,"Iloilo in the Philippines could be a good option if you want someplace more English friendly.   Internet in the Philippines isn't as good as Thailand but the English speakers could make up for it.  Iloilo ranks pretty save as well believe it was top 10 in a recent South East Asia survey.  If you can find a nice condo to rent in newer areas around SM Iloilo that would be great.  

If you want more of a big city feel you could do Nonthaburi in Thailand.  It used to be part of Bangkok but is now it's own city/province.   You can rent a condo right on the purple line (sky train) for under $500 on Airbnb and under $200 if you rent longer term and direct.  Had several friends who lived in D Condo Rattanathibet which is right next to the Sai Ma stop of the purple line.  Great area and easy to use taxis and the sky train to get places.  

There are two not common options that you seldom hear really promoted in Expat and DN circles."

In a different era it would have been a goodish episode to tide me over a week.  In this era it wasn't enough to get me excited for next week.   If that makes sense.  

Instead of a low point it is a weird high point.  Felt like Doctor Who.  Not preachy in a four wall breaking way.  Good plot.  Good guest stars.  Bit of education for those who don't know who and how important Tesla is.  All and all a nice episode but not a great one."

That is amazing.  Shows the model is working great.  Based on your OP I worried you might be dealing with a lot of ""toss money at it"" startups and a few months later have to deal with them leaving when cash flow realities set in.  

With 21 months+ (minus fired or project) for a 3 year old company client retention that shows great matching with service and clients.  I'm used to seeing those kind of numbers in very niche agencies.  When they focus on an established niche and very few competitors are there. 

I did in house for an RV dealer so got to know a few of the agencies that focused on our niche.  Really amazed me at times how ""easy"" they had it.  As long as they were ""ok"", not overpriced, and didn't mess up they had clients for years.  

From the looks of it you have a business for life if you want it. Seems like those numbers should really flux based on client intake and how well you ""qualify"" people.  Nice to have stable clients so you can grow vs maintain."

gallifrey,fekl3cm,t1_fek3rx6,1579202291.0,"> The ideas in the show are just oozing with potential. There's so many great things/people/places that they could write in. Instead, we get poor, unfleshed, vague attempts at storytelling, and that's what frustrates me most.

Compared to other bad eras and episodes I think this is the worst part.  In those so often there was no potential.  It was just bad all around. 

Here and now it is great potential but wasted.  Even the very idea of a female Doctor seems wasted.  It pales in comparison to Missy/Master we already got.  

Everything in this Era is so full of potential.  They are good actors.  Honestly I think all 3 companions on paper should be amazing.  Not to mention all the progressive things that could be used.

Female Doctor: How does the character react to the changes?  Friends?  Enemies?  Random people.  etc etc.   The character is the Doctor.  Each Doctor is different.  And I don't want just a ""female"" Doctor.   But there is story here that could be well explored.  And great messages that could be made within story context by doing so.

Interracial Step ""Parent"":  Graham and Ryan are the best part about this.  But damn do more.  In a an era where they push ""family"" as more than biology let's really see it.   Their relationship should be a way to really get the theme across.  I love watching it grow but at the same time I see how much potential has been lost already.  I'm an American so maybe my views on race are different.  But in my mind I'd have loved to seen Ryan with friends who are black and see them giving him a hard time about Graham.  Because that is real and I've seen it.  And then you can have scenes where it is reverses and no one takes Graham serious when he says Ryan is his Grandson.  Issues that real interracial step/adopted parents face.  Not to mention this is a time travel show and the past is full of places that will be hostile to Ryan but more so to Graham because of the relationship.  

So much wasted potential.  smdh 

Yaz is a police officer, an authority figure, who is also a minority.  Once again American here but so much potential there.  Maybe friends have issues with her joining the ""man"".   Maybe she has to face racism from fellow officers.  etc etc  I get they are in the Tardis but you can use a flashback.  Episode where they land in a multi species civilization.  She has to stop an officer from harming a kid of a different species.  Flash backs to her doing that along race lines back in the UK.  She gets arrested and the drama of the episode is getting her out.  Learning that while one person can't fix society one person can make a difference for others.  etc etc 

I keep going off on these in my head fan fiction stories... in large part because the show isn't giving me anything.  When the write ups for characters in the series bible are more 3 dimensional than the actual episodes this is what you do.   You start playing mentally in the wonderful playground.   If they won't play with their wonderful toys I will.  

Honestly when this era is over I think I will just have my better head canon and forget about the real episodes.  Because honestly when I haven't been bored or tuned out watching I've been mentally fixing it as I go along anyways.  

In my world Graham and Ryan helped the Doctor see how much she wants a family.  And how family isn't about genetics.  Yaz has been a moral compass showing how you can do right even if you are not in a perfect world.  Also would have Yaz help the Doctor get used to issues with being female.  

And now with the Master and Gallifrey we have a Doctor mentally destroyed.  It happened again.  She did it last time... but she fixed it... she saved them all.  OMG what has the Master done... why?   Why didn't she stop him before.  She was so close with Missy.  She blames herself like we saw after the time war.  But also she fixed it once... so that hope is there and it builds... as does the mystery of why the Master did it.  Maybe as it continues she will see hints that it was justified.   Reminding her of her own ""justified"" use of the Moment.  But she's the Doctor... she can't accept that.  There is always another way... a better way...

Please God someone give these characters and these amazing ideas some depth and emotion again."

gallifrey,fejy90o,t1_fejsjpu,1579188577.0,"Honestly the sequels in Star Wars and the 13th Doctor era both feel like Fan Fic to me.  And not very good ones.  In general a lot of entertainment is starting to which worries me. 

Ada Lovelace is a great example here.  I literally had no idea who she was before that episode.  (Im american so that could be part of it).  So after the episode I looked her up and actually read different info on her for about an hour.  

That's the kind of messages and history lessons I love about Doctor Who.  It honestly is an important feminist message when shows point out women who were so important to history, science, and etc who lived at a time when being a woman was a true hindrance to their potential. Done right such stories can have powerful messages that smack sexism right in it's face.  

Back to Ada... she highlights the issue with bad writing.  It should have been Doctor Who that made me love her.  But I felt more emotions from random history articles about her than I did her character in the show.  

A show that seemingly wants to be about female empowerment literally just tossed her name on ""random temp companion"" and that was that.  Replace Ada with any random person and the story doesn't change.  Her character was literally just smartish upper class person taken to the future.

And having read about her it honestly felt like an insult to her.  Ada in real life was arguably one of the smartest people alive in her time.  

Imagine the same story but Ada and the Doctor are dropped off in maybe the 70s.  Ada sees these giant computers and after the Doctor explains a bit what they are she starts to understand.  Maybe it is her that points out how her work led to this.  The Doctor than realizing ""computers"" are the connection.  Ada suggestion maybe that is the key to stopping it... maybe they can program something to stop it.  The Doctor has the ah-ha moment and mentions how she used a ""program"" in a ""computer"" to save her own world once.  (tying back into the Time War and making the revelation of Gallifrey even more powerful once it happens)

The fact I can in my mind write better ""fan fic"" then what they put on the screen is killing me.  And mind you I don't write fan fic and I am not a writer at all.  So I can only imagine what fans with actual skills are feeling.  

Ada is just another example of the lost potential of this Era.  

And that doesn't even touch on the Spy.  Who was so unmemorable that I didn't bother to look her up and like you couldn't name her without searching.  And I am literally the guy who read his whole history textbook as soon as he got it each year.   I literally love history.  I always get history videos suggested on YT.  And I didn't bother to look her up...."

What if it had been the Pet store not the Book store that evolved into internet Walmart?

What if it was Microsoft who created the first consumer (vs business) smart phone that succeeded? 

There is a lot more luck to these stories than either side in this debate wants to admit.  Money, connections, intelligence only takes you so far.  And yes honestly it can and should inspire people to dream and take chances on those dreams.  In the end though it is luck, timing, and just the whims of the market that turns a business owners into billionaires.  

Also in the talk of Gates, Bezos, Zuckerberg and their money and connections many forget Cuban who isn't exactly rags to riches but he didn't have all they did.  He literally got lucky but his hard work got him in a position to be lucky.   Remove some luck and he is likely a fairly successful serial entrepreneur.

gallifrey,fejrdtk,t1_feio1x0,1579183946.0,"Exactly.  While some of us aka fans (and honestly some non-fans) are just pissed at the issues themselves most of us really don't care (whether we agree or disagree).  

It's just being done so badly.  Sci-fi (at least the best of it) has always had messages in it.  Just compare the recent reveal with the classic it could have paid homage to...   Which made you feel more?  The monologue (knowing is half the battle) or...

> Oh my God... I'm back. I'm home. All the time, it was... We finally really did it.  YOU MANIACS! YOU BLEW IT UP! AH, DAMN YOU! GOD DAMN YOU ALL TO HELL!! 

The same reveal... the same message.  (Hell the, ""We"", really drives it home that it is ""We"" who are responsible.) Yet one is among the greatest scenes of all time while the other is what we now get from Doctor Who."
EntrepreneurRideAlong,feixgch,t1_feipjba,1579149901.0,"I agree Sales can be an issue for people including business owners.  

For businesses that fail fast it is likely lack of sales from lack of sales skills or a bad business model and/or product/service.   But those that fail later the lack of sales is often a sign of bad management.  

But even lack of sales is fixed by management knowledge and skill.  As he said in the OP... delegation.  An Entrepreneur that knows he sucks at sales will ASAP hire someone to handle sales.

Also depending on the sale cycle a good product/service can overcome bad sales skills simply with hustle.  Sales is a numbers game.   Yeah closing 1 in 1,000 is going to make life harder than 1 in 20.   But unless it is a huge sales cycle (note to follow) simply talking to more people will fix the problem enough while still in the solo phase and help the business survive till the first hire (of a sales professional) can be done.

Note: Management Knowledge would also help someone know not to start a long sales cycle business without capital to hire people and survive the time it would take for revenue to ""normalize"".  

So in the end as long as the product/service is good hustle combined with management skills will overcome sales issues.  

I've personally done it in stores in my management career.   Took stores that had not been profitable for months and years and within 90 days had them profitable.   In one case had the store in the top 1% in the company for the sales metrics they were tracking within a year.  

Sales including percentage breaks downs is part of your ""numbers"" and a good manager will understand how they work.  A Sales Manager (a slightly different skill in management) would know how to break it down for any sales person including themselves.  At the most basic how many leads/cold calls would be needed to make blank number of sales required to break even.

Example using 1,000:  If someone is dialing for dollars they should be able to easily make 100 cold calls per day.  Maybe more if they are getting shut down fast.   That means 1 sale every 2 weeks based on a 5 day work week and a 1 per 1,000 closing ratio.  If each sale nets $1,000 or more that business likely could survive depending on if the owner needs to take any money out of the business. 

Like i said if you need to talk to 1,000 prospects because you suck at sales it can be done.  But hopefully you would realize you sucked at sales and would not start a boot strapped company without having the ability to pay a sales person.  Or having a co-founder who can sell."
EntrepreneurRideAlong,feiextp,t3_ep3phz,1579136936.0,"These all IMO go to the heart of what I think the real problem with Entrepreneurs is... No Management experience.  

Time Management & Delegation?  Basics of management.

Not charging enough?   Part of the overall problem of Entrepreneurs who not only don't know their numbers but can't read a P&L let alone know how to use one to help their business.

I strongly believe that every Entrepreneur would be better if they spent a year or two in Retail or Restaurant Management.  I know not everyone can do that or get to the Store/General Manager level fast enough to actually learn this stuff.   

Everyone can take the time to learn this stuff indirectly.  Everything from free sources including friends in management.  To paid sources like college classes or online courses (assume these exist but never looked).   

Also everyone can hire a coach or consultant that does know this stuff who can help them.

gallifrey,feie2xu,t3_ep6pa1,1579136355.0,"Yaz has suffered two fold.  First she is the 3rd wheel exposing the problem of 3 companions.   Second she is being written in what is arguably (and for me obviously) the worst era of Nu Who.   It's painful.   

Yaz like all 4 of the main characters is a good character.  Good back story, she even brings in the side characters that make companions feel real and tied into the ""real world"".   Like this whole era Yaz is wasted.  But even in this era it stands out how much she is wasted.  In an era where I am left wishing things would get better and we'd see the true potential of these characters... she stands out among all of them in a bad way.  

Any other era and Id assume the writing team hated her.  In this era I don't know what to think."
gallifrey,feidcym,t3_ep3ryl,1579135870.0,"Honestly hard to say.  In 2005 I could say 9 was my favorite or second favorite doctor (after 4).  Even for a while I held 9 above 10 but was amazed how much I liked 10 more than most classic doctors.  After a while I felt my top 3 were some mix of 4,9, and 10 but with order changing.  

11 became my new favorite quickly.  I still am not sure anyone else has pulled off the age of the Doctor as well as Smith.  

War Doctor story/idea was cool and interesting but looking back I kind of wish it had been 8.  Really think the ""half human"" nature hinted at could have allowed him to be the dark warrior the Time War needed.  Plus would have been nice to see him back on screen.  

With 12 I felt a loss of 11 (who to this day I think was the best Doctor) but also felt him being a hardcore fan allowed a great Doctor.  12 IMO was a classic Doctor but done well and in the modern era.  

My favorite Doctors are 11, (12, 9, 10, 4) with those being so close I change my mind on them.  

So maybe the companions could make a difference?  Well not really....

I loved Rose though I get why some didn't like her.  Martha was good but maybe hurt a bit by the Rose overshadow issue in the writing.  

Donna... originally a throw away guest star turned into what I would argue is the best companion of the show.  Her arc was great and honestly I loved her in nearly episode she was in.  Honestly in many ways she kind of stole the show during her time.  A lot of the best moments including the saddest were hers.  Honestly with all that happens in Silence in the Library and Forest of the Dead it is still that ending scene with her and Lee where he can't call out to her that I remember most.  That was an emotional moment that still hits me any time I think about it.  So much of why I love her is the emotional tragedy around her character arc.  Brilliant writing that made her memorable long after she left the series.

The Ponds?  They were fun and Rory IMO was the better of the two.  But sadly by the nature of the story and their introduction the focus was mainly on Amy.  At least till towards the end of their time as Rory really stood out.  Fun what if is to imagine how different their time had been if Rory was the main companion that brought Amy in.   But in general they were good and not great.  If I didn't love 11 I might not even care about them honestly.  

Clara was a good character and a good idea that was badly executed.  I like her but get why most don't.  Bill is similar in that regard for me.  Liked her but never really loved her.  Ditto for Nardole.

River IMO was never really a companion.  She was like the Master.  A reoccurring character that worked well by not being a companion.  I get her story is over but that makes me sad as having a reoccurring ""equal"" worked for her.

The 9-12 eras had some good non/minor companions as well.   With Wilf being the best.  Of course being part of the Donna tragedy helps.  But he stands out on his own in places like the End of Time where like Donna he outshines the Doctor in my memory due to the emotional scene around the radiation booth. 

I guess I should touch on Captain Jack.  He was good as a companion but really shined in his spinoff.  In many ways he was like the Master or River.  And wish they would bring him (and River) back to use in that way.  The Master is fun but his/her nature as a villain weakens him as just a reoccurring ""equal"" as River and Jack were/could be. 

By now maybe you've noticed something?  Yeah me too.  13 and the ""family"".  As actors and characters I like them.  I truly believe with better writing they would be great.  The Graham and Ryan relationship is in many ways my favorite part of the this era.  

That said it isn't good.  Some complain it is the SJW stuff but that in and of itself isn't the issue.  Doctor Who has done ""message"" and ""issues"" before.  And Trek is known for it and I love those episodes of Trek.  The writing IMO is simply bad.   When you have the Doctor monologue like the ending of a GI Joe (Action Force) episode PSA it just isn't working.  

Sadly this era aka the 13th Doctor is now my least favorite.   I started by saying it was hard to say my favorite era of Nu Who.  Because honestly every era had good and bad episodes.  Yet overall every era was great.  There are things I liked more about this companion or that.  But minus 11 standing out I liked all the Doctors about the same and above most of Classic Who.  

So happily I can say I am not sure which Era of Nu Who is my favorite.  But sadly I know my least favorite and that is now."
ChoosingBeggars,fei69x3,t1_fehv966,1579131219.0,"Sadly I don't think you can just let it go or people will keep doing it and word will get around that they wont get in trouble.  Better to do prevention and good customer service.  Minus the big boxes that will reduce most of it.  And slightly higher prices will cover the little theft that does happen.

Big store not much you can do.  Everyone knows most who go in to steal will get away with it so those that want to do.  Self check outs have increased it a bit.  And increase accidental theft (aka you thought it scanned).  But minus high theft areas the volume for those stores makes up for it. 

Killing people over petty theft is IMO a bit crazy.  Armed robbery?  Yeah pull a gun back on them.  I get defending yourself.  But a kid shoplifting?  Seems overkill to get a gun involved whether it is the owner, employee, or the police.  

Though from my Walmart days we did have a ""shoplifter"" who got real serious.  He would come in early and go to garden center during the morning meetings.  Would toss DVDs (back when they had value) and other small high dollar stuff under the fence.  Later he would drive around to pick it up.

Finally got so bold that he showed up during one of the morning meetings with bolt cutters and sold one (might have been two) riding lawn mowers.   

In the end the police figured out where he lived and it ended in a stand off and shoot out.  Don't remember/know all the details.   I had left the company before the final chapter happened but got told by friends I had in the store.  Can only imagine what would have happened had anyone ever tried to stop him.  Might have ended up with a stand off at Walmart.  

I wonder how much the better modern camera systems prevent that kind of major theft now.  Regionally at least any time there is major theft from a big box store the police plaster that crap on FB. 

Couple times a month I'll see a post like that.  I'm sitting back and thinking... damn why would anyone do it now?  Seems impossible to get away with anything serious or long term minor.  The cameras are just too damn good.  

Even stealing minor crap will add up and with all the evidence that one stop is going to turn into a felony due to all the times they didn't stop you but have you on tape. This isn't like when I was a teen or even 15+ years ago when I was a manager."
ChoosingBeggars,fehtbkp,t1_fehrlx3,1579123455.0,"I like the NJ wording on concealment vs NC.  Concealment isn't the crime but why the concealment is done is. The ones I remember reading over the years were always along those lines.  Or like NE where concealment is a sub part in relation to the theft where it is clear concealment itself isn't the crime. 

I was originally trained in IL and my management career was in the IL/IA border area.  So you can see why past the POS was so big here.  But a lot of the training was national based so likely states like IL plus liability are why national training focusing on passing POS or attempting to leave."

After reading that NC statute I'd be afraid to do it in your state.  Wrong store, asshole manager or owner, and all of a sudden you have a criminal charge that technically you are guilty of.  

Can totally see how that law can be abused.  

Also I agree.  I love back and forth like this where we all learn something and everyone is cool.  These days everything seem to turn into crazy arguments.   Even Baby Yoda meme groups are turning into war zones... Baby Yoda... literally the cutest thing in the last few years... and even those people are finding ways to fight each other...

ChoosingBeggars,feh5zfn,t1_fege7z6,1579109851.0,"Actually the best case for someone who conceals and is stopped is they sue and get a settlement.  Which is a fairly common occurrence.  A lot of LP (Loss Prevention) guys lose their jobs over bad stops because of the liability it opens up for the store.  

I just read NC's law and that has to be one of the most strict I've seen.  In that state it appears that the act of concealment in and of itself (as opposed to intent to steal) is a crime.  I'd be curious how LP and Management training is different in NC.  The law in and of itself does not shield civil liability but when the act of concealment is in and of itself a crime that doesn't leave much room for lawsuits.  

Do you know of other states where concealment itself is a crime.  Most I have seen allow concealment as ""intent to steal"" but don't actually criminalize concealment.

Such a law must be a nightmare in the modern world where people bring their own bags and in stores such as Aldi where sticking items into your bag (even a bagpack) is common.  As written the NC law technically makes that illegal since it is written just about concealment vs concealment as intent to steal.  Unless ""willfully"" somehow is meant to mean ""intent to steal"" but as written that IMO is not clear.   

I see people every time I am in Aldi placing things into personal bags while shopping.  And its fairly common to see people in cold weather pull small items out of their coat pockets at checkouts in all stores.  This is especially true in stores where use of carts is not common (convince stores, dollar stores, Aldi for small trips).  It's insanity to think this law makes ""innocent"" acts like that illegal.

EDIT: I should add that I personally (based on my reading) break that law multiple times a year.  For small shopping trips I never take a cart and will use just a bag or my pockets to hold things.  Glad I am not in NC.  Though I suspect in practice the stores follow similar rules about passing the point of payment."

The more you know the more you can get in their way IMO.  The true genius knows that he knows nothing.  And most people think they know more than they do.  

Trust me you don't need to know how to do this stuff to hire people who do.   The CEO of Walmart has zero idea how their website and app work.  He hires people who do know so they can make his plans for them work.  Make sense?

I wouldn't worry about hiring anyone in Germany.  Focus on outsourcing and even later building a direct hire team in India or the Philippines.  There was a social network (can't think of the name) ran by some kids/teens (believe it was a brother and sister) that really was all outsourced to India for the tech part. (I can't find it from google, but google sucks now for long tail random searches.)  It can be done.

Also don't worry about someone you hiring copying you.  If you have a valid idea it will be copied by others.  That is the nature of business.  Blue oceans turn Red.  But it is unlikely to be some person working for you.  

Good luck.

The last time a Democrat didn't get 50%+ of the Jewish vote for President was in 1980 where an Independent took 15% and still more Jews voted Democrat vs Republican.  The last time a Republican won the Jewish vote was in 1920 where once again a 3rd party (this time socialists) got 38% while 19% went Dem and 43% went Rep.

ChoosingBeggars,fee5ohm,t1_fed801w,1579026920.0,"Yes it is about intent.   And proving intent.  While technically concealment can be considered intent in most states.  Most stores won't do that because until they pass the point of sale or leave they can't prove intent.  Stop them too soon and they will just say they were going to pay for it.  Which opens the store ups to criminal and civil issues due to illegal detainment and harassment. 

Also concealment in and of itself is not a crime.  You can put an item you plan to buy in your pocket, bag, backpack or etc.   The store however can chose to ask you to not do that.  They can even trespass you over it.  But it is not in and of itself a crime.  It simply may be against store policy.   The criminal issue is theft and concealment can show intent to steal.

One of the reasons many stores have a no backpack policy is due to this issue of concealment and intent.  Basically if someone throws something in their backpack you are now stuck following them to make sure they remove it (ditch it) or pay for it.  Just easier to tell people to leave the bags with staff.   

Not sure if you were ever a retail manager but I was and this is all training we go through.  The legal ramifications can be far more costly than the items being taken.  I even worked for one company where literally no store employee including myself as the store manager was allowed to stop anyone.  Nor could I trespass them.  If i had a known shoplifter I was directed to have an employee follow them around to offer ""great customer service"".   Basically make it too hard to steal until the person finally stopped coming in.

Problem with all of that I just said in the context of the original post (and thus this comment thread) is that this person never concealed anything from what info we have.  It was a walk out.  So literally any stop before passing the point of sale or leaving would have been an issue for illegal detainment and harassment.  A cart of groceries is never going to count as intent legally.

Which goes back to my original comment that they have not stolen till they have gone past the point of payment or left the store. 

Final note I don't know any store where shoplifting turns into a higher charge based on leaving the store.  What state does that?  In every state I know of it is about the dollar value stolen that determines the charges they face."
cutthebull,fee38hm,t1_fedbsru,1579025474.0,"Going to just jump around and hit points I can.

**Minimum Viable Product**: In that niche is literally just meal plans.  In fact most people making money in this niche even with ""custom"" meal plans are really just selling the same few meal plans based on basic modification. 

My point here is that you are creating this larger product when you may or may not even be able to sell meal plans.  

**Your App:**  Based on what you said it is basically something like the macro info in MyFitnessPal combined with basic food recommendations.  Not sure if you are aiming niche or more general.  Also not sure how many meals you will have programmed into it.  

**Testing the App vs Testing the Idea:** My whole point was and is that you are putting a lot of effort into something you are not sure anyone wants.  Even worse based on this reply you seem to look down on the stuff that people are using.  Maybe you are right... but what if you are wrong?  

This is where testing the idea and minimum viable products come into play.  Even if you had to do it all manually.   

Example: Set up a site have them sign up for a special custom 1 week meal plan sent to them in 24hrs.  So you get their info.  You run the numbers.  You manually select the meal plans and you send it to them the next day.   Up sell into say a 4,8, or 12 week custom meal plan.  That way you can see if people want it and if those people will pay for it.  

And that is just one possible answer to how it could work to test.  

The problem is right now you have no idea what the market wants and you are overly confident they want what you are building.  Like I said you may be right.  But right now you are putting a lot of time and possibly money into this without testing or branding.  

The worst scenario is actually that you are right but you never get to that point.  That the world never gets what you are creating or waits years for someone else to create it.

You need to Test the Idea(s) vs waiting to Test the App.

**Marketer in your niche:** The one I am talking about is #2 on google for ""macro calculator"".  I don't know him personally just share groups with him.  I'll link his site below but you should have already visited sites like his, MyFitnessPal, and etc that are doing well.  You need to be studying your competitors and that means google searches, social media follows and etc.  

His site: https://www.iifym.com/macro-calculator/

**It's over 13,000!!!:** It is nice to think about the future, to have goals, to believe in yourself.   But unless you plan to get Venture Capital (VC) you need to make this business in steps.  

You don't need to be thinking about how thinks will work at 13,000 users.   You need to be figuring out how to get your first paying client.  Then how to get to a Ramen Business aka one that pays enough that you can survive on the minimums.  While you have your parents supporting you this is easier but don't assume that will last long.  The faster you get to $1-3k in profit a month the less chance you have of them pushing you to get a job. 

Now alternatively you could take the VC path.  But you're going to need to get really good at selling your idea.  And likely will need to get money from family and friends to start.   On the VC path it will be about users not revenue or profit.  Users, even free users, have value.  On the VC path you are Facebook vs Myspace and Myspace for you is MyFitnessPal and they have a much larger head start and  are now owned and branded with one of the largest fitness brands in the world.  

**Amazon:**

> I have read that Amazon pretty much ignores the competition and focuses on customers only.

Amazon is over 20 years old and one of the largest companies in the world.  They also are rolling out/buying/subletting physical locations.  I could assume they are just doing that.  Or I could assume they are watching what Walmart is doing.  

Not to mention when they started they took the Book Store model plus the Sears catalog model and merged they using new tech.  Bezos didn't come up with a random new idea in his head.  Sure he took a calculated risk but one backed up by knowledge and in his case personal wealth.  

**Market Research:**

> It’s not fun to look through the competition, because it takes me time to understand what their website is about. I also find it boring, because I quickly get the suspicion that the website is not providing the service that I would provide.

This is your thoughts and feelings on competitor research.

This on the other hand is the view of the man who would be the richest man in the world if still alive.   Don't reinvent the wheel.   The richest people in the world never do.   They take what is working and make it better.  The first of anything seldom is the market winner.  And minus patents they seldom get ""rich"".   Study and learn from your competitors.

**Who Who Why**

* Who are you?
* Who are they?
* Why should they use this?

My would they use your app vs MyFitnessPal?   Why would they buy meal plans from you vs a fitness ""guru"" like Thomas DeLaurer?  

Who are you?  Really... think about that.  You can brand as yourself or the company or both.  But in this niche why would they trust you?   You don't have a fitness brand.  Do you have a personal fitness story?  You are not a doctor.  You are not a nutritionist. 

None of that is bad but it is reality.  And market research would show you the brands winning in this and related niches have that stuff.  So how do you build a brand worth following?

Who are they?  Who is this for?  Have you built an ideal customer profile?  If so what is their name?  Hair color?  Yeah that sounds silly but companies really do that.  That Customer Avatar (as many call it) is a real thing.  By knowing who they are you know what to say to them.

Like i said originally this isn't Field of Dreams.  If you build it they will not just come.  Also who wants dead customers anyways. ;) 

**Final Thoughts:**

**You can't do it all yourself:** Seriously you need co-founders or freelancers/employees with the skills and knowledge you don't have.  You taught yourself to code.  That's great.  If you want to be a coder.   But you could have just as easily hired someone to do it or even gotten a partner.  In this reply you mention how you will ""learn"" marketing.  You ask about how to ""learn"" market research.  etc etc

You are wasting far too much time learning vs doing/hiring.  So why?  Is it greed?  Often we see that... people think they have million dollar ideas and don't want to give up any equity.   Is it lack of resources?  Sometimes we have to do it ourselves because boot strapping is the only way.  

Boot strapping is fine but it doesn't work to build Facebook.  It works to build thefacebook.  And I hope you understand the difference.  Thefacebook was a simple website for Harvard students to check each other out.  Basically a fancy yearbook. Aka a minimum viable product.  

**You need to be realistic:**

Far too many businesses are lost because they are trying to build Year 10 vs Year 1.  Year 1 Batman gets shot and can barely beat mobsters.  Year 10 Batman is leading the Justice League and can beat any enemy.  What should your Year 1 look like?

Remember if your business is to make the ultimate customized meal plans just as Facebook gives us the ultimate customized social feed that the minimal viable product is going to be similar but different.  A fancy yearbook for Facebook and simple meal plans for yours.  

You can see the Year 1 vs Year 10 for countless businesses and entrepreneurs.  I'm not telling you to give up or change your dreams.  I'm not selling you on society's definition of ""realistic"" aka the 40/40 plan of a job and retirement.   I'm telling you to be realistic on your dream path.  

You have advantages (like your parents) that many entrepreneurs would love to have.  You haven't explained it well but if I am understanding correctly your idea could be pretty amazing in Year 10 or even Year 3 honestly.  You have a Year 10 vision.   You just need a realistic Year 1 vision to go along with it....

Have him buy out your half of the house and move out.  Clearly you can't afford even half the house and living together after would be nearly the same as now.   

He needs to get a new mortgage to pay out your equity plus what is owed.   He can simply get a second mortgage to do that if the first can be put fully in his name.  Or he needs to get one new one.  Make sure you have a home inspection and a realtor give values for the house.   Make sure you are getting your half of the house at market value.

He also may decide to just sell it and move himself as well.  In which case make sure you get your half of the profits.  Also if the down payments were not equal (you are not clear on that) make sure you get your down payments back plus reasonable ""interest"" as well.

What you did tell though could be ""telling"".  Basically that you wake up ""hours"" after he gets up and work freelance.   Yet you never mention working after he gets home.  

Now maybe you make more per hour and work less which I think everyone should do.  But based on some things you say I don't think that is it.  Example being that he doesn't like where you live which sounds to me it is about affordability.

So how is pay split?   Bills?   That is the stuff that matters at the core.  If he is working full time and making way more he could be resentful especially if it appears (to him) you are doing nothing (freelance or cleaning).   

And a final note.  If you want to maximize time with each other wouldn't you want your schedules to match?   If you wake up hours after him you are likely to be going to bed hours after he does.   See the point?   And you having schedule control over your life are the one who can match him.  

Like I said we can't know...  You may be lazy... He may be a jerk.   I suspect it is a little of both and you'd both be better just being honest to each other and actually listening to each other.

simpleliving,fc9os8f,t1_fc8sljw,1577555900.0,"I just read the article the person in question did not have Part B.  Part A covers very little.  Part A is the ""free"" part while B most have to pay a monthly premium on.  (The poor like my mom do not and also get it for free.)  Also the ""supplement"" they are talking about does not sounds like a Medicare Supplement (the ones with letters like F, G, etc).  I'm not sure what it was.   But based on the info it left them paying 20% of billable (vs medicare allowed like part B) which is why it was so high.  

Hard to know exact numbers without having the bill and a Medicare coding list but with Part B (no suppliment and no advantage) I would guess the bill would have been 20-50% of what this person got.  Maybe even less since Medicare Allowed amounts are way lower than ""list"" price.   

This is one of the reasons that Medicare is so much better than insurance in the non-senior market.   With normal insurance your 20% can at times be more than what the insurance company actually paid.  While with Medicare your 20% will always be 1/4th of what Medicare paid.   You are truly paying 20% of the real bill.  And of course with Medicare Supplements you can lower these amounts even more at the cost of network size and/or monthly fees.  Suppliments work with anyone who takes Medicare but you get a monthly fee in exchange for less or even no out of pocket.   Advantage plans can have no to a small monthly fee in exchange for a smaller network and a series of co-pays.   But with an advantage plan out of pocket has a cap.   While normal Medicare does not.   Say you have a max $3,500 out of pocket that could save you in the case of a major illness vs paying the 20% with Medicare Part B.   

As for the $2k assets that is true at a basic level but what is considered an asset for such calculations varies.  One car is not counted no matter the value.  Nor is your home and retirement accounts if planned right (they get treated as income vs assets).   When I sold insurance I had to deal with a situation like this where assets didn't allow Medicaid.  

I am not a tax adviser but as a laymen I think anyone who expects to have low income needs to structure their assets for medicaid planning.   You can look online or this.  Also be aware that Medicaid for dual eligible treats assets different than Medicaid for long term care.  The long term care rules really suck and seemingly you need trusts to fully avoid the asset trap.  

The way you talk about Medicaid rules you sound like someone who has never been on Medicaid.  I have so I am well aware of how it works.  Here is a nice link that highlights what is allowed at a basic level.  It does not go into some of the rules like the income vs asset one for retirement accounts.

No one IMO should be choosing between eating and medicines once they are on Medicare because as I pointed out if you are poor enough you are dual eligible.  If you are having this problem and are not dual eligible that means you need to look at your income and expenses. (you'd be surprised how often you can be better off making less money in situations like this)  Even if not dual eligible there are plans that can help reduce those out of pocket expenses on medicines.  Simply put don't just accept it but figure out how to fix it if you can.   Talk to people who can help you figure out options.  Contact companies directly if it is only one or two meds as they often have unadvertised programs to help people struggling.  Every individual is different but for most there are solutions to lower drug costs.  

And yes I am well aware that dual eligible does not have the same zero costs as Medicaid does due to the fact they are now (past few years) covered by Part D not just Medicaid like they used to.  My mom is in IL and it sounds like in IL her out of pockets may be going away in Jan. (fingers crossed)  She already doesn't have much of them anyways and only for the first few months.   I hope other states follow suit as that change (which I believe was part of Obamacare) really hurt dual eligible people.  The federal law needs to change. 

Food is the easiest thing to get in the US.  First of course is SNAP benefits.  But if you don't get enough that way there are food pantries and meal sites.   Anyone reading this who is having this problem should contact their local senior center or ""township"" (what it is called in IL) and they can help you find pantries and food sites.  You can also use the following website to find many them.  https://foodfinder.us/   And the workers as well as others simply using them can tell you more places as well.  

My mom used to go to food pantries a lot but doesn't much anymore but she used to know dozens of them and which days they were active.  She tends to use meal sites as she likes the socialization.  Plus she doesn't like cooking so normally only eats microwave or stuff like sandwiches that don't require cooking    

Locally (to her) there are ones that serve lunch and dinner most days of the week.  I don't have the schedule she follows memorized.  Locally to me there is a food site I have never been to that I believe serves 7 days a week.  

Do not go hungry!  There is help available.  

You might have to chose between rent and meds but never should you ever go hungry.  The biggest problem is people don't always realize all these food pantries and food sites are available.   Or they think it isn't for them.  If you are going hungry it is for you.  Don't be too proud.  Don't think you are taking from people who need it more.  If you need it... you need it.  

Once again anyone reading this who needs help please use the resources I gave above to get help. 

Also as a reminder there is also likely housing and utility assistance available both government program based and charity.  Resources like the Senior Centers I mentioned above can tell you who to contact.   These can be ways to significantly lower you expenses.  Energy assistance tends to be mainly a winter thing (at least where I'm from) but it can pay several hundred onto your bill and gives you shut off protection till April 1st.  

Finally remember that when all else fails talk to local churches and mosques.  One friend of my mom (younger couple with kids) uses churches and charities to pay their rent a few times a year.  Some like the Salvation Army have regular programs (treat it like black friday and be in line early on the day they do it so you get the help) while others do it as a one off when asked.  

Simply put Help Is Available.  Just takes time to find it if you have never used a food pantry or meal site before.  

I grew up in public housing and ate the government cheese so I learned a lot of this as a child.  And at times when things were bad Ive used a food pantry to get food for myself as an adult.  

Trust me I get it.  It hurts your pride.  Been there... done that.  But please if you are reading this and truly need help... I beg you to go and get it.  And later when you have enough remember to give to the pantries to pay it forward to those who need it next time.

simpleliving,fc7lnpu,t1_fc7i9ti,1577511472.0,"No retirement visa or tourist visa normally allows work.  I mean who wants to work once they can retire?  I get that some have to but often that is due to living somewhere too expensive.   Even if you stay in the US the solution to that is move somewhere cheap. 

If one is capable of work and wants to this gets even easier as finding a native English teaching job is relatively easy.  Being older though (or non-white) can make it harder.   Which is only mainly an issue in larger cities.  Having a ""degree"" tends to be a grey area with teaching as well as often the law says you need it but in practice often you don't.   So for those without a degree don't worry.

In general ""English teacher"" is used by a lot of expats (without digital nomad skills) to live in these countries before they retire.   In Thailand you could expect to make 30-60k baht ($1-2k) a month as a Native English Teacher and have a class load of about 15-25 hours per week (about 40 per week at the school).  Im not sure on other countries because most of the teachers I know do it in Thailand including Filpino OFWs who on average make half of what native speakers do. 

In general I would recommend anyone wanting to do teaching in any country find Filpinos in that country doing it.   They can help you find a job.  And IMO Flipino OFWs are the best expats especially for simple living.

As for stress, risk of not being let back in and border runs.   Any time you live or stay in a country that you do not have citizenship or permanent residency you have that issue.  It is the nature of it.  This is why personal research needs to be done.  The right country or countries for one person might be completely wrong for another. 

That said... lets be honest if you are from a western country in most cases you would return home when you reached that point.   Even the US has a pretty significant safety net for our seniors especially our poor ones.  So for most people being an expat is for their golden years or younger with life ending with a few years (or even just months) back in their home country.  

Also depending on the country you want to go to there are always options.  Opening a business or marriage being two of the most common for longer term stays.   And don't let the idea of opening a business freak you out.  In most cases this isn't like America where it is so often expensive to do it.  Small retail store or restaurant might not make you much money but it gets you the visa and provides jobs for locals.  Bars are very common for expats.

As an American right now I would say the easiest country to retire to is the Philippines.  Even on a tourist visa it is very friendly (3 years no leaving just in country renewals).  And there are multiple ways to stay longer.  Nearly everyone knows English at a level of near fluency or above.  It is however not the most affordable option.  Compared to other places in South East Asia I would even consider it a bit expensive. But it is the easiest and best for a lot of people."

Of course as I mentioned in another reply any American can go into the Philippines and renew a tourist visa for up to 3 years without having a border run.  Which is how most lower income people I know do it.  And most of them end up married before the 3 years is up so they can get a 13a Visa at that point. 

A lot of low income retirees and expats/nomads do methods like this in a variety of countries.  Georgia as I mentioned allows 1 year in the country on a tourist visa.

Any person regardless of their income would need to research countries they were interested in to see what options are available to them.  But lots of people are doing this on a variety of visas including tourist visas.  It is simply knowing the rules (written and unwritten).   

You have no idea how the expat/nomad community works and you seemly don't even know it exists.  South East Asia (including Thailand which I would no longer recommend) is full of older retired expats living on what we would consider lower incomes.  At times that requires visa runs on tourist visa.  Thailand used to be Visa Run friendly but it isn't really anymore.  

Each individual situation will vary but as I said a little research on google and YT can get you most of the answers.  

Vietnam: No retirement Visa but can get 1 year multi-entry visa over and over.  Does require 90 day border runs.

Peru: Need $1k/mo income for retirement visa

minimalism,fc7im3c,t3_egh986,1577508579.0,"Based on your post you will be time poor no matter what happens.  You simply want to do a lot of things that will take up a lot of time.   Plus some of them have significant costs so you will have to work more to pay for them.  Just be careful that you don't end up working to afford to do things you never have time to do.

You should live as minimalist and as simple as it makes sense for you personally.  If I were talking to you one on one I would really get you focusing on what you want (to do) and why.   Figure out if any of that stuff can be pared down either via elimination or scheduling.  Maybe you spend a ""season"" working in a repair shop.  Maybe it becomes an odd job you do while traveling.  Stuff like that.  

Even the business idea needs to be defined beyond ""something like that"" because when you say it that way I think you just want a business to have a business.  Which if you want more time can become a real trap since most people with businesses work more than those without.  But the right ""business"" one can work significantly less than a job.  But it all comes down to skills, knowledge, and passions and how those relate to things people will pay for (directly or indirectly)."
simpleliving,fc7hm1m,t1_fc797co,1577507693.0,"You really need to do research there are loads of places you can retire with incomes like that.  And in most nations that is an above average income.  

Thailand as I mentioned is no longer friendly for such a person unless they have a significant (800k baht which is about $20k) savings they can move into a Thai bank.   The monthly amount needed without that is proven income monthly of 65k baht (about $2k).  

But the Philippines and most of the rest of South East Asia currently would welcome that person.  Georgia which I mention allows any US passport holder into the country for a year at a time.  And last I knew you could simply leave and return a few days later and get another year.  

Anyone wishing to do this on a lower income simply needs to research the rules in any country they might be interested in.  If they plan to be nomadic and change countries every few months it is easier since they can use tourist visas/visa waivers to handle it.  

Off the top of my head I would say the easiest country to stay in long term as an American is the Philippines.   Just on a tourist visa you can extend up to 3 years without leaving the country.  They also have really cheap and affordable retirement visa options."
simpleliving,fc7h0io,t1_fc70vkw,1577507176.0,"You really should look into the expat communities around the world.  Loads of countries want retired westerners.   As I mentioned even our ""social security"" and similar pensions puts us in an income level above most of their populations."
simpleliving,fc7guu1,t1_fc730ax,1577507037.0,"If you are poor in America assisted living is covered for dual eligible people (Medicare and Medicaid). 

As for the woman needing a shoulder replacement.   Medical tourism is a thing because of how much cheaper (even with insurance paying part in the US) it is to get stuff like that done in another country.

As for you medication it could very well be significantly cheaper.  I don't know your income and asset levels but personally (and what I tell people) is I would rather be sick and poor in the US.  Medicaid is really good coverage in most states and that $600/mo would likely turn into $0. 

No one can tell you what is best.  And illnesses complicate life planning.   But in general you really should look into the whole picture.  You may be working hard and costing yourself money.  Even getting on the right Obamacare plan could get your expenses significantly reduced.  

So please take some time to run through scenarios.  You can play around with different income levels on HealthSherpa (shows Obamacare plans easier than Healthcare,gov) and you can google the poverty guidelines online.   Remember in most states the line for Medicaid is 138% of income.  

One final note I forgot to say above most meds available in the US are available in any country.  In fact the US is often the last country to get a med approved.  (which is good and bad)"
simpleliving,fc7g77k,t1_fc733xz,1577506473.0,"It can be complicated but it is pretty good.  It's better than medicaid in some ways and worse in other but if you are dual eligible you get the best of both.  (Among the many reasons I tell people you want to be poor when you are old and sick.  At least IMO)

A lot of the issues with Medicare come down to supplements/Part D and advantage plans.  Especially if you travel and/or need a lot of meds.  

Basic Medicare is pretty cheap and thanks to the way the law is the copays are fairly cheap.   Supplements and/or Advantage plans can help get rid of most of that stuff but cost more per month (or come with restrictive networks).  

No insurance covers everything for free.  Even most of the ""free health care systems"" we hear about in other countries have costs beyond just higher taxes.  Especially for meds.  

If Medicare is getting you with Gotchas you need to talk to an agent who knows it well and can help you figure out the best options for you (vs their commission).  For most who can afford it that will be a G.  For the super healthy it would be just medicare plus the cheapest part D plan (if you want to avoid the penalty later).  For people with limited resources who stay in just a local area it might be an Advantage plan.  

There are so many options that they only real way to figure it out is individual to individual.  Either knowing it all yourself or most likely working with an agent who truly knows it and is focused on what is best for you.
