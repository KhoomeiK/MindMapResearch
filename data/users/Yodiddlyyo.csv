webdev,ffhcssn,t1_ffhc9aa,1579930158.0,"One easy way is to use querySelector. 

So let's say you have an element like this

    <div id=""one"">
         <p class=""inner-element""></p>
     </div>
 
You can chain selectors, like this:

    document.getElementById(""one"").querySelector("".inner-element"")

Though this is extremely basic javascript stuff, as in some of the first stuff you learn, and I highly recommend you actually go and read up on beginner level javascript before asking these questions.

https://www.freecodecamp.org/ is a good resource."

But you don't even have to to know all the things Obama did to pull us out of the recession. It's also funny how the unemployment was still rising as Obama took office.

 The thing is, this thinking is wrong with redux, and it's wrong with this. Is redux overly complicated for a todo app? Yes.

reactjs,fc0pu8i,t1_fc0emvz,1577296759.0,"A lot of people have time for this. Anything extra you do to the code is unrelated to the end user anyway. If that was the case, why not just make your codebase a single gigantic unreadable file? The end user doesn't care what the code looks like. Because it's a pain in the ass to work with. If you're making a website for a client, sure once it's done it's done, but many of us work on apps that are in constant flow of adding features/maintaining/etc. Refactoring is about code quality and longevity. So you change stuff for two main reasons, to make it easier on the next person that needs to touch your code, and to reduce the amount of bugs, either present or future. Also, what about the fact that API's change? React has greatly changed their API in the past two years. Would you rather be working on a version 15.0 React, that you can't update without things breaking, or work on a codebase that has been kept up to date with the latest API changes and best practices? Refactoring is very important, and will be a part of anybody's development if they're working on a project that spans multiple months to multiple years."

UpliftingNews,fcs5wcs,t1_fcrtk0p,1577911881.0,"It actually was 14 million dollars and in today's money its more like 60. You don't need to be that smart to make money if someone hands you 60 million dollars, you have to just be not a total idiot, and hire people to manage money and marketing."
AskReddit,fcrtnn5,t1_fcrtehd,1577906468.0,"How would they know they made a mistake before you point it out? Isn't that the point of reviewing someone's work? I understand that just saying ""I know"" is stupid, it should be followed with them saying that it's just a mistake"
AskReddit,fcrrjs4,t1_fcqmcul,1577905651.0,"Unless they genuinely do know and just made a mistake. I make mistakes, it's more annoying to have a coworker explain something to you that you already know because you just made a little mistake."
menkampf,fcihxl6,t1_fcih1qa,1577662832.0,"I gotcha, sorry for misunderstanding your point!"
menkampf,fcigawx,t1_fciboek,1577662094.0,"Breitbart is one of the most biased websites there is. I don't think there's a single site that's as largely popular as it that has consistently gotten facts wrong, either accidentally, or more likely maliciously. And this isn't a ""trusting fact checkers"" thing, you can cross refernece things yourself and anyone with a brain should realize how biased and factually incorrect breitbart is the majority of the time if you spend a few minutes doing some cross checking."
reactjs,fc0pu8i,t1_fc0emvz,1577296759.0,"A lot of people have time for this. Anything extra you do to the code is unrelated to the end user anyway. If that was the case, why not just make your codebase a single gigantic unreadable file? The end user doesn't care what the code looks like. Because it's a pain in the ass to work with. If you're making a website for a client, sure once it's done it's done, but many of us work on apps that are in constant flow of adding features/maintaining/etc. Refactoring is about code quality and longevity. So you change stuff for two main reasons, to make it easier on the next person that needs to touch your code, and to reduce the amount of bugs, either present or future. Also, what about the fact that API's change? React has greatly changed their API in the past two years. Would you rather be working on a version 15.0 React, that you can't update without things breaking, or work on a codebase that has been kept up to date with the latest API changes and best practices? Refactoring is very important, and will be a part of anybody's development if they're working on a project that spans multiple months to multiple years."
webdev,fbx1vgs,t1_fbwryog,1577166117.0,"Still, if he did all this after 2 months on the, totally understandable, the guy's not cut out for it. If this guy still has no idea what's going on after an entire year, he's still not cut out for the job, but the if your company continues to employ him, the company is partly responsible."
