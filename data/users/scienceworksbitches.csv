aww,fe24tmi,t1_fe1z114,1578834478.0,"which they have to eat tons of cus they are very low in calories.   


thats also why they arent the smartest bois round the bush, the eukalyptus diet made them low powered eating machines with not much energy being ""wasted"" on thinking. thats propably why the guy doesn't know how to drink unless to pour it down its eating hole...  


they are cute though, lucky bastards."
technology,fd26pzu,t1_fd1zkh0,1578142548.0,"but we do benefit, modern technology wouldn't be possible without automation.   
smartphones, tv, internet and so on are not just a privilege for the rich but are affordable to the masses.  


and its also not fair to just look at the successful in society, for every bill gates there a 1000s of ppl that invested their own money and work into comparable research that never paid off and they lost millions of dollars and years of their life."
technology,fd25gzs,t1_fd0d2p6,1578141978.0,"but it would still not mean that your buddy could learn how to become a successful coder if he just worked hard enough. you need a certain level of intelligence and creativity to even be able to hold a job in the US/EU, low level coding work is outsourced to india.  


while the conservatives blame the individual for not working hard enough, the left tends to put the blame on the system and pretends that everybody is equal and its just a question of investing enough time and resources into schooling.  


the cold hard facts are that ppl are not all the same, and while an average intelligent person might be able to get by with hard work, grit and propper resources, a big chunck of the population will never be able to fulfill whats asked of them, no matter how much time and effort they invest themselve or is invested into them by society.   


in manufacturing there are plenty tasks that require repetition and no complex, out of the box thinking, but thats not the case in the area of coding, where all those tasks are automated and basically everything you do requires out of the box thinking, knowledge transfer and creativity."

WTF,fcsrg50,t1_fcsolvg,1577923227.0,"but a gastank doesnt explode, the newer ones are made from plastic and will just melt, resulting in a big flame at worst, not a explosion.   


there was something else in the car, maybe propane cylinder or a faulty LPG tank."
