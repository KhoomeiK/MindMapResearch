AskReddit,ff9h4f7,t3_eseut8,1579712898.0,How sorry everyone (especially on this shit site) feels for themselves and has to make everything into a pity jerk. It's pathetic.

AMA,ff508yo,t1_ff5062s,1579576766.0,Duh. What the fuck else is people asking you questions? I'm bored to hell at the minute.

AMA,ff4wz4n,t1_ff4wdpy,1579574449.0,That's cool. I would have just called them minotaurs to be honest. Uhhh. I guess I don't want to ever get exposed - actually exposed - and get outcasted. Have the whole house of cards come down sort of shit. I can't imagine enjoying picking up the pieces.
AMA,ff4vus9,t1_ff4voin,1579573677.0,"I don't even know what a satyr is, lol. I just know the stor(ies) of good ol' Narcissus. 

I already said gambling, so I'll go for shoplifting. Does that count? There's a lot of skill in it. You'd be surprised."
AMA,ff4vgwt,t1_ff4uzs3,1579573411.0,"Yeah, I know. But - never seemed like a bad way to go to me. You got the story wrong. Narcissus saw his own reflection and fell in love with it. Upon realizing it couldn't reciprocate, he died and became a flower. Sort of nice. Better than most people get, right? I have enough humility to coast by on. Thanks.

I do. I have a lot of hobbies, actually. I like most activities."
AMA,ff4ukxb,t1_ff4ufz9,1579572802.0,"Haha, you're taking the piss but I'm confident just because there's no need not to be. What's the point in hating yourself if you're always going to be yourself?"

I'm a serial cheater anyway. Cat calling isn't something that happens as much to attractive men as attractive women, just cos it's something men do more. I've been Hey Cutied by a group of middle-aged drunk women on the street and that's about it on the cat calling front."
AMA,ff4ruge,t1_ff4rovh,1579570930.0,Thankyou ðŸ’ž Couldn't do it without you.
AMA,ff4rtgo,t1_ff4rdf5,1579570912.0,"Depends on what you mean by harrasment? I have no problem being hit on by strangers the times it's happened. I can see why an attractive woman would, but it's not really the same for me. If I'm not interested - I just tell them I'm with someone. I had one creepy old fuck skeeve me out a bit when I was 14, but it was nothing giving him a filthy look and moving seat didn't fix."

AMA,ff3m3f1,t1_ff3lf0w,1579543959.0,"Pahahaha OH NO, I lost SuperBrax1450's respect. FUCK. Over for me. No - you're not. For a """"socio"""", you're too shit of a liar. You're clearly a braggart, and socios aren't. You aren't diagnosed with shit. And if you are, it was from your low level therapist when you told her this utter shit to feel cool. You'd know that sociopathy doesn't exist as a clinical  label anymore if you were really diagnosed. Also, actual socios don't seek out diagnosis. They're usually assigned to therapy after committing crimes. High functioning socios don't have diagnoses. 

I can't believe you've tried to claim you're a genius or even have an IQ of over 5 with all these fucktarded mistakes in your fucktarded lie. 

No, you aren't. You're just fucking boring. You're saying all this mediocre shit like it makes you different and people are gonna be interested in it. I am indeed disregarding your feelings. And no sociopath would give a fuck about that."
AMA,ff2tzyt,t3_eraoeh,1579524104.0,"Oh shut up already, you boring retard. If you were really smart then you'd realize that this is basically everyone in the world. Get a personality. You are not a sociopath. No one here thinks you're cool, dark, or scary. Stop trying to be like a film character."

You're crying on fucking feemagers (why do you think you're a girl, exactly? You're even lying to yourself) about how much you wanna come out but can't because your friends know the difference between a male and female ;__; It's hilarious. Really. Even me, as someone who steals from people, cheats on my girlfriend, all of that (don't know how much you bothered to scroll) are 1000% happier and more accepted/loved than you. How does that feel?"
u_willowdrakon,fehqxic,t3_ep3y7p,1579122101.0,"Pahaha, this is hilarious. We all know you're too scared to ask for extra sauce at McDonalds, freak. Anyway. In the real world, no normal person will ever see you as a woman. Sure, some of the woke ones will pretend to. But they won't. You'll eventually be a 40-year-old fiveheaded man with a receding hatline in a dress with a necrotic wound seeping pus in place of any genitals and getting cringed at on the street."

So somehow it's YOU who got under my MY skin, but you're the one banging out essays on a few sentences? The embarrassing part isn't the supposed crying. The embarrassing part is attention whoring about it all on REDDIT, then unironically being proud of your fake internet REDDIT points? And bragging about them to me? How pathetic. Genuinely, I could be cutting my wrists onto the keyboard and it still wouldn't be a patch on some of the shit you've typed here. How sad.

Like 2/3 of this is just you justifying your comments to me about your parents. For saying you're just having a good funny time here, that comment really bothered you. Were you just having a giggle as you typed out that paragraph?  You clearly aren't that over it, huh? Sounds like you're crying to me.

Idk about that. I like that kind of shit. The  Comparison Contest. It's fun. Usually people on this site respond with something trying to brag, but it's just some completely average mediocre thing like I Got A Job And 2 Kids and it's hilarious. Who said I was trying to sound intelligent? Also...Do you realize most of your peers wouldn't think you're Mr Well Adjusted yourself? You're arguing with an asshole 16 year old to this extent over basically nothing. Imagine walking into a school or some shit and doing this."
confessions,fdct9il,t1_fdcssfh,1578283676.0,"What about my typing (not talking, dumbass) fucks with you? Is it cos there's not emojis or it's less American or I don't really say lmao or something? Again Dirtsk8r, I'll repeat myself, it's really hard to still try to look like you're some happy-well-adjusted-cool-guy when I've JUST seen you crying about your mommy and daddy fighting in the other thread. My life is clearly substantially better than yours purely cos I don't do that.

How...How have you got under my skin? Are you having a schizophrenic episode? I'm just sort of laughing at you here?"
creepyPMs,fdcnwzw,t1_fdcnl01,1578279606.0,"I'm genuinely sad for you. Please say something new. You literally copy and pasted that other guys shit WORD FOR WORD. This is so sad. I guess I'll just copy and paste what I said to him for you? God, you had to scroll a while down for that.

 Point is: I got out of it. I do/did it. At 16, too. And with a fair helping of that shit to an extent even they'd consider terrible (except paralysis? What did you mean by this?). As did others.

AskReddit,fcvoakc,t1_fcvnv0u,1578006412.0,"Fair enough. Aren't you basically doing that labelling shit too, though? ""No empathy"" is a label of it's own. Well, it's not really being percieved as no empathy that bothers me, cos I get that. There's just something really annoying about someone trying to preach your OWN BRAIN to you, think they're all smarty smug woke for it, and then also collect some nice points for their virtue signalling whilst probably not really giving a fuck about the whole ordeal.

You're not a very empathetic guy yourself - look at you discarding my whole value and views because I don't feel too sorry for people who got themselves where they are. Yeah, I won't lie, I'm not too big on morals. Said it before on here, but that's the failed narcissists, idiots and cowards game.

I don't have one little rat lick of empathy for impoverished people, you're right. Why should I? I think mostly, your position in life is down solely to you as a person. As for that scenario - it's not societies fault you chose to have two kids when you're supposedly impoverished and now have to support them. Should have made better choices. Well, why wouldn't you value a particularly nice object over the life of Homeless Joe you don't know who got hooked on heroin at 19 and now mugs to fund his little habit?
