PublicFreakout,ffvwc4y,t1_ffvlluq,1580275241.0,"Generally speaking (as in not state specific) my understanding is that police don't need probable cause to detain and ask for ID but only need ""reasonable suspicion"" that a crime has been committed.  When I took some arrest authority classes I was told that it required a lower bar than probable cause.  This cop clearly didn't have even that.    
  
I did have a roommate that was sitting on his friend's porch and was approached by police.  They frisked him and found a straight razor (because he's a fucking moron) and arrested him.  According to his lawyer he would have been able to get off if he hadn't later fallen asleep at a stoplight with a bunch of separate bags of weed in the back seat.  A cop pulled up behind him while he was snoozing away.   
  
The point of that story was that even when the cops argued that they searched him because there was a break in in the area recently the lawyer was convinced that the detainment and search were illegal because he was on private property.  Too bad we never got to see that tested in court."

If you want to see a real world example that's already happened just look at the drought/heatwave in Russia in 2010 that drove up food prices in the middle east which in turn contributed to the Arab Spring.  
  
> In a report published last week, researchers from the Center for American Progress, the Center for Climate and Security and the Stimson Center examined the role of climate change in the Middle East's upheaval during 2010 and 2011. Looking at long-term trends in rain, crops, food prices and migration, they were able to determine how these factors contributed to social instability in the region.

> ""The Arab Spring would likely have come one way or another, but the context in which it did is not inconsequential. Global warming may not have caused the Arab Spring, but it may have made it come earlier,"" the report says.

> The Middle East and North Africa region is extremely vulnerable to fluctuations in food supplies and prices. According to the report, with little arable land and scarce water supplies, the region is one of the top food importers in the world.
