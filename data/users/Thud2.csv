You can see a couple of more of them on the stove in the picture. The bottom one is full of vinegar. I just bought the top one for $5.99 and the copper ring around the bottom and has some really stubborn burnt on stuff. I'll make it good as new

virtualreality,fdw9n5q,t1_fdjpk90,1578756484.0,The people who go to China  to negotiate and test the items  they're thinking of buying when buying from China have the best luck. You have to be careful. It's kind of the Wild West buying in China. They don't have the protections for consumers in place that there are in the West. There are great deals to be had there for sure though.

virtualreality,fdc39yj,t1_fdc2542,1578266238.0,Wow thanks for the info. It's interesting to hear how things are done in the other parts of the world. I haven't heard of a system that uses this tech as a built in tracking solution. The XTAL uses some kind of built in system but I'm not sure which technology they use. Your country is making fast progress in VR and soon will have affordable options as good or better than the Rift or quest.
virtualreality,fdb2zo2,t1_fdb2g6h,1578253196.0,"That looks like a fantastic solution for mobile VR headsets but I hope they did a 360°  free movement system for the artisan, maybe added an additional tracking sensor."

virtualreality,fdan9ty,t1_fdakmev,1578247912.0,Looks good! If they make a VR headset as polished and high-end has their phones it could be something special. It would be great if they came out with something on the XR platform
handbalancing,fdafzb9,t3_ejd2p4,1578245586.0,It helps to practice falling forward and rolling onto your back until you're comfortable falling in that direction and not just falling back to your feet. Most people don't trust going that far forward in a handstand and you have to be able to to sustain a handstand. Most people use their head  as a crutch against falling forward when they do a headstand. When you learn how to balance that far forward the handstand easier. And about strength and a handstand. The person who taught me how to do a handstand likened it to balancing  a broomstick on your hand. it's easy to do but try doing it with a hundred pound dumbbell in your hand ;)
