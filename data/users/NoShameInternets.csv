MovieDetails,ffx346z,t1_ffwwlo3,1580316729.0,"I think Sanderson’s climaxes suffer a bit from the fact that he’s a very successful YA author, too. I’ve read a few of his YA books and they’re very good, with developed themes, battles etc. appropriate for that audience. 

The issue is that there’s some bleedover into his adult work.  A lot of his exposition feels a little like we’re being talked down to.  He’s proud of his magic systems, for example, and with good reason as they’re generally awesome and unique. He then proceeds to explain in great detail everything each character is doing magically, repeatedly, as if we’re hearing it for the first time.  “He performed a FULL LASHING, which is different than a PARTIAL LASHING OR THREE QUARTERS LASHING, which allowed him to FLY IN THE AIR TOWARD HIS TARGET, as the LASHING WAS FULL.”  Obviously an exaggeration, but you get the gist. 

The other tendency that bleeds over is the “lightness” of it all, seen most obviously in his choice of language especially during those climactic scenes. 

I’m not concerned with any of it, by the way. I’ve read all of his stuff and I’m going to keep reading it. I love it. Just some observations."

MovieDetails,ffwua0q,t1_ffwsi0f,1580311148.0,"Am I the only person who disagrees?  Don’t get me wrong, I love Sanderson and his other work, but I didn’t enjoy his three concluding books to WoT. To me it read like it was written by someone who read the sparknotes on each of the characters, then wrote three novels including only the main qualities (discounting Rand, who I thought he got well). 

Mat, for example, is my biggest issue which sucks because he was my favorite character. Sanderson’s Mat felt like a caricature of RJ’s Mat.  Sanderson took “lovable trickster with a side of badass” and made a one dimensional character out of someone who had one of the best character arcs and developments in the series. 

He did the same thing to Perrin.

Edit:  I didn't realize it, but Sanderson himself acknowledges that [he got Mat wrong.](https://www.brandonsanderson.com/the-wheel-of-time-retrospective-the-gathering-storm-what-i-learned/)  So that's something.  Again, I still like the guy and his writing, but that's nice to see."

funny,feyxd61,t3_eqvru7,1579451589.0,"Controversial opinion but I don’t think selling a tackle/fall/injury is a bad look for the players themselves; it’s a bad look for the sport.  The players are doing what they have to do to get calls, just like in basketball. The difference is that in basketball you’ve got three refs watching a small court - in soccer there’s really only the center ref watching everything except offsides/out of bounds and the pitch is huge.

When you have one guy watching everything and you feel illegal contact, there’s practically no chance he sees it unless you sell it. Soccer players are just as good at HIDING illegal contact as they are selling it. My buddy used to put his hand on the upper quad of someone he was sprinting next to to stop them from raising their leg all the way and force them to slow down. Completely illegal, impossible to see unless you’re standing in front of them which the ref never is.  So, you fall over when you feel it.

Moral of the story - add another center ref."

memes,fes9nje,t1_fes57y7,1579362948.0,"He just told you how ping affects transfer rates - packet loss. Higher ping generally means more jumps, which means more chances for lost packets during transfer. The more packets you lose, the more correction needs to occur and data needs to be retransmitted which can dominate your bandwidth and prevent much new data from being transferred, thus lowering your overall speed significantly.  If the packet loss is extremely high and bandwidth is weak, the connection may break down and not be able to handle the amount of correction."
