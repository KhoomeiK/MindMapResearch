depression,fekf4bz,t3_epikcs,1579198732.0,"I had a similar experience in my psych doctors office. Said I was feeling unsafe, suicidal thoughts, etc. This later sent me to the hospital not by choice.  They did the whole 9 yards of blood test, urine test, ECK, etc. And playing 20 questions with a psych doctor who thinks me knows me.  After all was said and done? That was it... they only gave me a few papers to other resources that I cant afford and especially it was like fuck all at this point... :("
AskMen,fecytfv,t3_eo6ggw,1578990287.0,"Well, for how I did it, I currently live with my parents so thats an easy way to do it. I put as much into my savings with each paycheck from a $11 an hour job. It took about a year or two but I eventually ended up with 5.5 grand now. My  life tips on being a cheap sake is simple. Dont go out to eat,  dont fill up your as all the way at the pump, if you need to go out sometime do it at least once a month like to the movies on a discount day. That alone will save me about 6 bucks off from the ticket and its something I always take advantage of. Try to limit your grocery shopping to about 40 bucks a week. Healthy food is NOT expensive as I keep hearing... you could literary get a few bags of salad for easily around 5 dollars.  Bags of rice too for the same as much all while keeping that budget nice and tight on the wallet. 

&#x200B;

But anyways, just a few tips here and there. I cant say put in X amount or whatever. Only put in what you can into savings. And if you put into too much, then take some back out while keeping in mind your main goal is to save it as much as you can. Hope this helps."
depression,fdw1l86,t3_en5x2p,1578754137.0,Just move somewhere else where the job market is better. I did and you dont even need a degree for most good jobs anyways.
depression,fdt5xkn,t1_fdt0ia6,1578712341.0,I concur here. Seriously people... please talk with your therapist! They also use a sliding scale to help you financially too. Im paying like 35 bucks a week to talk to my doctor.
depression,fdml6c3,t3_em5w9m,1578554071.0,"Have you thought about going on short term disability? Hopefully it will help some things out so you can process life better maybe. Im currently on it for the long term though and it helps in some ways for me. But yes.. being a wage slave is also something I have no desire to though. The only reason why im on LTD is because its the only way for me to continue to get my insurance because without it, im fucked. And Medicaid is taking me a long ass time to get onto."
depression,fdii9mp,t3_el9plo,1578443522.0,"Oh gawd damn I fucking hate this shit soo much too.... whenever anyone asks me im like, "" Im doing ok...I think"" or ""Today? Or the rest of my life?"" Or how about ""Feeling depressed as always, you?"""
depression,fdigoba,t1_fdgh753,1578442492.0,"Im not trying to sound mean here, and yes... while it is true that if he were dead, obviously his family would be very upset. But generally in saying so, this is about him. Hell, not just him, but each and everyone of us that has to suffer through this shit on a daily basis to prevent those ""tears and pain"" from happening. Being severally depressed is something that I will not even let my worse enemy go through or wish upon anyone...  its not about thinking what kind of pain it would bring, but rather how we can treat that pain in the first place before it becomes another tragedy."
depression,fdig5zq,t3_el7fo7,1578442161.0,"I know how you feel man, it sucks ass to be so depressed to wanna take your life. Ive been dealing with this shit for 10 years now. Im 29. And yeah.. being evaluated after thinking of suicide isn't fun. I hate to break it to you, but I need to be completely honest here as Ive been in this situation before... they honestly cant do shit sadly enough. Because after I was evaluated for even thinking of having suicidal thoughts, I got sent to the hospital, ans then sent home later in about 2 hours. So basically a fuck all, here is some papers to resources you may or may not afford : / What really pisses me off was when a psych doctor asked me ""What can we do to help you?"" Well gee Doc... you think I wouldn't be here having suicidal thoughts if I wasn't? What the hell do you think?"" 

Sorry for the rant... Im just so sick of this back and forth shit right now and I know this is going to sound redundant as all hell, but talk to a psychologist if you need to. I do it about three times a week. Please find a hobby that you are going to enjoy doing. It keeps me mind off of shitty things ans thoughts like how I was raped by my brother when I was 9. And just, shit like that... Anyways, hang in there dude."
nursing,fcx2t5c,t3_ej0leq,1578048725.0,I can understand people abusing the system but how do you even treat people who really are suicidal? If at all can be treated anyways..
SuicideWatch,fc1gvuj,t1_fc18ulg,1577318396.0,"So true man. And thank you so much for the love. I also send a merry Christmas to you as well. But anyways, yeah..it sucks though and it's always a hard battle to get through. The only thing that sort of works is that I still see my psychologist three times a week. And I take meds but...ya know, severe depression just never really goes away especially when you think about death sometimes.  I just wish more can be done. But I do have my boyfriend though and he is the world to me. We are even spending Christmas and New years together for the first time in in our 6 year relationship. I think if there is anyone that pulls me out of this illness, it's my boyfriend. And i thank my lucky stars everyday that I have him even though we live so far apart."
SuicideWatch,fc02bla,t3_eba5m8,1577274974.0,"I know how you feel man.. when I went to the hospital, they honestly didn't do much for me either. Mental health is treated as a joke in this country. And my doctor once said, ""if you feel suicidal, go to the ER"" And here I'm thinking, then what next? Well, not much next. A few hours later they give you some papers to resources you might not be able to afford and off your sent into the cold dark world. Basically their way of saying fuck all and can't do much else to help you here. And here I'm also thinking what was the point in the hospital stay besides time wasted and a bill that's never paid off : /"
AskMen,fbzzgjo,t1_fbxmulo,1577270258.0,"Oh yes indeed! Weve been in a long distance relationship for 6 years now, and this is our first ever Christmas and New years together! My guy really is a heart of gold and I'm just so thankful I have him in my life ðŸ˜Š"
depression,fbz24h0,t3_edrxx5,1577232790.0,"Wow..really? It's a good thing, I wasn't commited back when I had these thoughts. Did they bill you by any chance? But I feel your pain man...it just feels like mental health care is pushed aside, and they all pretend like it'll go away. I hate when my psychologist asks, ""do I  need to call the hospital?"" And I'm like, really? Then what? Hospital would just basically babysit me until they determine what and give you a huge bill for fuck all else. Yeah, they do care all right...:("
depression,fbz1bp9,t1_fbyw8gl,1577232115.0,"Look in the bright side though. Even if he didnt get a death sentence, or a full life sentence. Once he gets out? That fuckers life is still ruined man. He won't be able to get a job, or anything, etc."
AskMen,fbx82kg,t1_fbwtd80,1577173567.0,I concur! But this year however I'm finally being with my boyfriendðŸ˜Š
nursing,fbwfz3x,t1_fbwd221,1577148910.0,"Amazing... not just in general is the overall options and such. But I was quite surprised that in case of an emergency, and you have no choice but to go along with the ambulance and avoid signing anything they wave in your face for a signature and a $500 bill later I dodged though. But I'm just as surprised anyone can go in and almost give next to nothing on health care info they don't even have to avoid something they can't pay. I mean, I honestly don't blame people like this who are really struggling out there like me. It's either doing that or ending up with a collection of bills and bad credit, pilling on more depression too. A never-ending cycle for many. This is exactly why I can't just go into the ER whenever I'm feeling the need to kill myself cause I worry about that sort of thing too."
nursing,fbvkend,t1_fbv20z9,1577132072.0,"Well, what if someone cant afford payments per month? Needless to say im in a situation right now due to my depression that it made me impossible to even work. So therefore, there is no income coming in. And the thing about being suicidal though, from my experience honestly? It just feels like a waste of time... I mean nothing can be done because nothing cant be done. I was in the ER twice within 24 hours and just sent home in a matter of hours after I was there. Sure, they'll play 20 questions with me and refer to resources I cant even afford like an outpatient program. But, yeah.. not just time, but also money too. It was like $1300 for which they did practically nothing for me. I manged to somehow get it waved though just in time for Christmas. Thankfully someone is looking out for me. Anyways, like I said, this is all just based on my own experience."
nursing,fbudvmn,t1_fbu40bj,1577112674.0,"Interesting how much faster that works out when I flat out tell them when in reality I'm still waiting if I were to do it by myself, lol."
nursing,fbtw8a6,t1_fbtw35c,1577099212.0,"Of course..but for some reason, it's taking a long ass time for me to get on it also."
nursing,fbtu6yb,t1_fbtt9ko,1577096086.0,"So basically the only way to get any kind of health care especially if your a severe depressed guy like me, and was in a position to where I didn't have a choice in the matter to go to the hospital, and basically not to say anything to avoid a huge ads medical bill. I personally speak from experience here though. There really isn't much a hospital can do other them recommend resources and such and it kind of makes me even wander why my psychologist would say I should go to the hospital anyways if they can't really do anything... : /"
AMA,fbts9ol,t3_ecdnlk,1577093103.0,"I've got a question for you here. Ok, so if a patient comes in, and they don't provide any information about themselfs because in general they can't even afford to be there, etc. What happens next? The reason I'm asking is cause I was suicidal a few times and I couldn't say anything in the ER registration nurse due to the fact that I didn't even have insurance or any money. It was hell enough at the time to think about a huge hospital bill I could never afford. Along with dealing with my mental illness of severe depression."
AskMen,fb9rdb7,t3_ec67ke,1576647098.0,"Yes, two thing I will always be thankful for. A roof over my head and a warm bed to sleep in. I font know where I would be without these two amazing things despite me going through depression. Your grateful for the little things like that."
AskMen,fb8dg98,t3_eburto,1576611521.0,The fact that you can have a fight with a friend and then two minutes later we are back to being best friends. We only focus on one mood most of the time and generally we just don't give much of a fuck.  Our wardrobe is simple and not an over abundance.  We can pee pretty much just anywhere.  Not worrying about blood coming out of a hole every month. Or something else.
