fandomnatural,ffg5yf8,t1_ffehwhr,1579899167.0,"Thinking about this more I am realizing that I want *both* things, Sam & Dean as the awesome brother team AND ALSO found-family nonetheless helping them out here & there. *I just want it all*, lol. 

I was thinking about Lucifer-the-show that also has a central pair of characters that are very clearly central to the show & special & super-skilled (well, Lucifer is super-skilled anyway), yet there is *also* a found-family thing going on, of a set of 4 other key friends, who they love, & whose help is (occasionally) critical.

Also: increasingly I am feeling really bummed out by the extreme polarization in the SPN fandom, and it feels like it’s ramping up. It was already bad but now it’s going nuclear. There are these dog-whistle phrases and secret litmus tests that are used to peg people as one camp or the other. Opinions on episodes form up into 2 camps almost instantly. I mean I can’t even say something super generic like “I like found-family themes” anymore w/o people instantly assuming I hate the brother bond, hate Sam specifically, also hate Jared IRL, hate all episodes that don’t have Cas, want Destiel to be canon (sure I’m a Destiel fan but actually don’t want it canon), etc etc etc. 

Flip side, say I say I like the brother bond & suddenly people are assuming I hate Castiel *and* Misha IRL and must even hate gish, but must know the Radio Company songs and etc etc etc. Or I say “ya know I kinda think drunken assault isn’t the greatest thing?” and BAM twenty people block me becayse they’ve decided I’m a Jared hater *when actually I really like Jared*. When, c’mon, is there no room for nuance or discussion at all? Twitter is the worst for these btw - a person says 1 dog-whistle and is blocked when that person might actually be totally reasonable & could’ve been a friend.

It’s so absurdly dichotomized & polarized. There’s no room any more for anybody whose opinions don’t slot neatly into one side or the other. :/ Haunty, did I ever tell you that when we were at JIB I was with some Destiel fans one night, who knew I am a Destiel writer, and I mentioned my roommate was a Wincest fan amd they audibly gasped? They couldn’t believe a Wincest fan & Destiel fan could be friends! I was all jfc, seriously?? 

Even in this sub the polarization lines are getting more extreme, to the point that I get discouraged from coming here at all. Anyway it makes me a little sad.... I’m actually getting kind of glad that the show is ending. This is exhausting.

I have another whole thought about vindictiveness of fans toward creators - the desire for actual vengeance against a showrunner who’s let you down (see also Game of Thrones) but I’m too tired to articulate it rn"
fandomnatural,ffflyax,t1_fffkn4k,1579886817.0,"Robert (Bobo) Berens wrote 15x09. He’s consistently one of my favorites.

The CW’s production schedule requires multiple writers btw. They’ve always had SPN on the old-school schedule of 20-22 episodes per year, with only 8 days to film each episode. It is a nonstop treadmill. I met a tv writer once in May who was on that sort of schedule & I remember him saying “May is our only time off all year” - just after the last season ended. They start writing in June, shooting starts August. Since it takes a writer several weeks to write an episode, but there are only 8 days to shoot an ep & then shooting immediately moves to the next ep, writers start very early to get a headstart, but the shooting schedule starts catching up to them really fast. So there have to be many writers working simultaneously on different episodes, & even so they barely get the last script delivered in time. 

Shows like Game of Thrones that have fewer writers are on the cable-style shorter schedule of no more than 12 eps per yr, sometimes just 8 or so, and sometimes take more than 12 mos between season premieres."
fandomnatural,fffkan5,t1_fffj6la,1579885800.0,"If he had just said “coast” instead of “road” I’d be cool with it. It was just such a simple factual error that should’ve been so easy to catch - all you have to do is glance at Google Maps, lol. Or type the two town names in to get a route - Google throws back a “Can’t find a route” error. 

Stuck in my craw a bit because this is such a fundamental thing about Alaska. With a slight tinge of worry about Native culture, since these are both Alaska Native towns (both are Inupiat towns, and all the surrounding land is owned by the Inupiat). It’s a bit like if the writers decided to set something in a Navajo reservation w/o any effort to get the Navajo culture right. (I’ve worked in Barrow a lot - which, also btw, changed its name several years back from the “colonist” name of Barrow to an Inupiat name, Utqiagvik, so SPN also got the name wrong) - anyway it is a cultural minefield to get stuff like this wrong, and I’ve had it drummed into me to be super respectful about doing background research, so I guess I’m a little skittish about it."
fandomnatural,fffj34r,t1_ffex6yd,1579885046.0,"idk, I remember thinking way back in S1 that the show was already starting to assemble a found-family style ensemble. Ash & the gang at the Roadhouse. And Bobby of course. Somewhere around S3 I started wondering if they were taking it to a Grimm-style or Buffy-style thing where though there is clearly a designated “hero” who is super skilled (the Grimm guy, forget his name; Buffy), that hero, while head-and-shoulders in skill level above the others, nonetheless has a gang of friends who help out in critical moments & who are important emotionally to the lead(s). Maybe Lucifer’s a better example since that show is 100% anchored around 2 leads - Lucifer & Chloe are CLEARLY the leads & CLEARLY share a special bond, the entire show is about their bond, but the other characters also do matter and, though less skilled, do chip in now & then in critical ways.

What Supernatural’s ended up doing is having sort of a series of found-family characters who end up dying off & being replaced by new ones.  Sam & Dean are obviously the leads and make *almost* all of the game changing moves, but overall it’s fair to say that other characters do matter emotionally to them, and that those characters occasionally do help in important ways."
fandomnatural,fffhvpw,t1_fffhlu1,1579884311.0,"Yeah, I thought they should be much more bummed out at the thought that their skills were apparently all just fake.

Even if we find out later that that’s not true (which I’m still holding out hope for), they should’ve been really rattled to THINK that might be the case."
fandomnatural,fffhlu1,t1_fffgyy1,1579884139.0,"I had just the same thought when I saw the Hero’s Journey title - thought they were gonna marched through a Campbell-esque cartoon version of fairy-tale hero stories - accepting a Quest from a mysterious old guy on the side of the road, maybe, that sort of thing. 

I had such high hopes & I am generally a fan of Dabb, & generally I LOVE the meta episodes, but this one didn’t land for me."
Cringetopia,fffgy0g,t1_ffffs51,1579883727.0,"Disagree - this is my research specialty (I am a physiologist) and when I run metabolic rate or diet log / exercise log studies on those very students (including those trying to bulk), it is instantly apparent that their ingrained habits are exactly why it’s hard for them to bulk. I’ll be studying a kid who “can’t bulk” and it’ll turn out he’s routinely walking 3 miles a day between classes *and* biking to campus *and* never snacks between meals *and* doesn’t snack watching tv *and* has 3 other hobbies that all involve staying on his feet - a whole bunch of habits & hobbies that all add up to, overall, more activity and less eating (or eating less calorie-dense foods). Invariably the student doesn’t realize that their habits are unusual. Everybody thinks their own daily habits are common & universal, and so tends to overlook those habits as a contributing factor. (I see this both ways btw, with a mirror-image set of other habits in the overweight students). 

I guess I have an unusually detailed view of this because it only becomes apparent if you have everybody filling out exercise & diet logs while also tracking MR in the lab - this is what I do in all the college physiology labs that I teach, and the patterns are quite consistent."
Cringetopia,fff7g93,t1_ffeqo48,1579877626.0,"I was obese and am now thin. I don’t agree with the comments that it’s “willpower and determination”. It always felt like I had plenty of willpower & determination the first ~99 times I tried to lose weight. I mean I was getting my PhD, which is all about willpower. Anyway, on the ~100th time (or whatever it was) I changed my strategy totally and that’s when it finally worked. The thing that finally worked for me was realizing it wasn’t really about “willpower” at all - rather it was about *changing ingrained habits*, which may sound similar but is subtly different. People tend to fall back into familiar routines - go to the store and buy XYZ, cook XYZ, come home at night and do XYZ, go out with friends who do XYZ, on weekends do XYZ. I had to change all those XYZ habits - try going down different aisles in the store, buy foods I’d never tried, find different things to do in the evenings, get different hobbies on the weekends. 

I thought of it in terms of “outwitting myself” and making it as easy as possible to do healthy thing. Adding obstacles to block old habits (can’t binge on cookies if there’s no cookies in the house; can’t buy cookies at work if I don’t have my credit card; can’t overfill my plate if all my plates are small), removing obstacles to healthy habits  (why look here’s some pre-prepped healthy meals all ready to grab; commit to leading a walking tour so that I HAD to go do it) - so that if I was completely lazy I’d still end up doing the right thing. Whenever I messed up, I’d think back on what had led up to when I messed up and try to identify a way to make it *easier* in the future to navigate that situation. (example: tendency to binge at 3pm coffee breaks. Solution: set an alarm to eat some protein just *before* that, at 2:30pm. Then it was suddenly a thousand times easy to sail smoothly through the 3pm coffee break. This worked so much better than just gritting my teeth & trying to get through 3pm by “willpower” alone). 

I had to make it *easier* to eat right, & eat appropriate portion sizes, & get some activity, than to eat badly & lie in front of the tv. 

Anyway I think always-skinny people are those who happen to have all those habits already “burned in”, so to speak, so that they never have to go through the effort of changing habits in quite that same way."
