Yes, exactly! 

>(That being said, he really did do a pretty good job wrapping up the series, and I enjoyed quite a bit of it)

For sure, I'm glad he came along. He did a better job at finishing the series than we had any right to expect; he was flawed in places, but overall I'm generally happy with what he did.

>I think Sanderson's own work does a much better job of helping you understand what his actual weaknesses are. Unlike with WoT, there's not anything you're directly comparing Sanderson to, and he's actually creating his own storytelling/worldbuilding threads instead of riding off of some things set up for him. In general, by reading his other works, my conclusion is that Sanderson is a great author, but he's (to me) only an okay writer.

Thanks for that; it's quite nuanced. Most of what I've seen in terms of recommendations for him has been breathless fanboyism, honestly, so a little more balance is appreciated.
