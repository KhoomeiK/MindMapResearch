The Favorite, imo, is better, but it's way more hit or miss based on people's tastes. I liked A Star is Born for reasons most people don't weigh as heavily (love music).

The Green Book has the highest imdb rating of all the best picture noms as well, which lends credence to it's just generally the most widely liked of all the best pictures noms as well. The message of Green Book is simple I guess, if you want to boil the movie down to that, but that's pretty reductionist.

You can just click invest in vanguard total stock market fund and be done and retire very well and have many extra hours of free time throughout their life. For someone that's middle to upper middle class, real estate is probably the best way to get wealthy though, but a lot of the outsized returns you get is often because of how many extra hours you will be putting in.

Vanguard has low cost for all their options. Fidelity still highlights a bunch of their higher expense ratio bullshit funds that can trick a novice investor.

529 savings only count for a max of 5.64% towards your assets or some small number, so it doesn't reduce grant aid all that much. The first 20k is exempt as well.

Further, because of hedonistic adaptation, I prefer to start with cheaper cars in your earlier years, then get better cars as you get older. It's easier to go from a 20k car to a 45k car than it is to go from a 45k car to a 20k car.

So you're going to be paying a premium to manage your risk. If you can afford the risk of a 5k operation or whatever then you don't need it.

Maybe you feel differently, but I'm not a big fan of doing expensive end of life operations to extend the life of my pet and prefer to just put them down. Obviously this is a case by case basis based on the specific health concern. This is not a financial decision, as I feel like their life won't be better to extend their life when they're very old. So this is something where I wouldn't benefit from having the insurance as I probably spend less than average as well.

If you can take an ap class at school, and it's an extra 100 hours of work compared to a non ap class, that's equivalent to like a $12/hr tax free job, and even better considering you might have to take a 10 year 5% loan to pay it off.

You're still doing the right thing by investing in stocks, imo, as it's much easier and less work, but rental properties is a perfectly valid way to save for retirement as well. It just requires a lot of extra hours of work, which he may be happy to do. He probably will get better returns overall, but it's juiced through lots of sweat equity.

I'm of course not okay with just giving subsidized loans to a select few, but this topic seems complicated, as the nature of the repo market has changed, so the government is allowing more liquidity by having more players directly enter the repo market. The banks that are in the repo market have had new regulations that don't allow them to transact the same way they used to, which is causing the liquidity issue.

This guy's explanation in the comment on the linked, more balanced, wsj article seems to be a fairly reasonable explanation :

>The capital markets rely on the repo markets to fund leverage. Meaning, a bank can buy treasuries and then offer these treasuries at a ""haircut"" less than 100% of market value and receive a 1 day or more loan on this collateral.

>The bottleneck in the system is investment banks no longer really exist and have been replaced by money center banks ""too big to fail"".

>The current repo market is archaic and has been devastated by regulation making it ineffective.

>The reason the Fed does not lend directly to non-dealers is to protect the Fed from undue risk.

>Therefore to solve the repo market volatility, and to ensure all the excess capital is utilized in the US economy, the Fed needs to support an electronic market place where treasuries can be used as collateral for capital.

>The benefits are enormous in achieving a digital marketplace for US treasuries and excess capital. It keeps treasuries in demand and provides capital for those that have collateral while removing risk for the Fed.

>The genius of the futures market is the risk is removed systemically by the market operator, think CME.

>The Fed should not be the operator of a digital repo market but rather the regulator.

>The Fed's tools would not change.

>The Fed could enter this digital repo market either adding reserves or taking them away much like it did before 2008. 

>The challenge for the Fed is the excess supply of capital would drive rates to 0% plus any transaction cost. So if the Fed wanted to continue to artificially raise rates by paying 1.55% interest on excess reserves (IOER) the Fed could not afford to pay globally. 

>I believe that is good because I recognize the value of allowing the Natural Equilibrium of Interest Rates to be 0% to promote growth and reduce inflation expectations to 0%.

>BTW the Fed's 2% goal is a fools errand. 

>Lastly, having a digital repo market that the Fed could monitor in real time helps the Fed understand and manage the capital markets and the economy.

The reason swr (3%) is much lower than expected returns (7%-8%) is that it has to account for inflation and a potential market crash in the beginning. By pushing your start date back, you get an expected 7%-8%, as you don't have to ""withdrawal"" less for fear of a market downturn at the beginning. If you use that  3%, you're essentially starting your withdrawal even though you won't be withdrawaling, which doesn't really make sense.

For example if you worked 1 more year then retired, and your portfolio dropped to 3 million, wouldn't you use the swr based on that 3 million number or would you just use that 4 million from last year?"
