WritingPrompts,fgm748f,t3_ez3afx,1580919213.0,"""I'm sorry, but did you just say that you were immune to--""

""Watering cans, yes."" I turned away and went back to wiping down the table. The last customers who seemed decent enough, right up until I saw that they'd 'forgotten' to leave a tip for their table of two. I sighed. The vase on the table was empty, as well, when I'd just refreshed the flowers this morning. Just another thing to add to my list.

Children played down the street. One, showing off his new bike, HONKed the little horn on the handlebars. I gritted my teeth at the noise and shifted so that I couldn't see the gathering.

""Okay, look, I can understand knives, fire, and even shovels, but how can watering cans kill someone?"" Patsy leaned over her table, resting her chin on her knuckles. Her eyes were bright and eager, just waiting for another story of another death. 

I bit my lip--I didn't usually mind telling stories of my past lives, but the watering can incident had only been forty years ago. It had been my most recent death and the memory of the people I'd lost in that rebirth was still a raw, aching wound. When I lost Pat, I'd feel that way about her for a lifetime or so too. No matter how many years I lived, loss never stopped hurting. 

""Look, it's not the weirdest thing I'm immune to."" I shrugged and tried to act casual, to smile at my sister and friend. ""It's tried to kill me in a lot of ways over the century, eventually it had to start getting creative. Anyways, don't you have a deadline coming up? I thought you came here to whine about that.""

""Ugh, don't get me started!"" She threw her arms up in the air as dramatically as she could, leaping to her feet. ""I still need to get three more paintings done for the gallery next month, but they all turn out terrible!""

I straightened and dusted off my hands, dumping the rag back in my tote of supplies. ""Well, maybe if you spent more time working on them and less time spying on Jason, you'd have already finished them."" 

She scrunched up her nose. When she did that she looked like the dog we'd had as a child, with her big eyes and her tiny button nose surrounded by new creases and lines. ""I'm positive he's been dumping things in my yard. That's the only way his place could possibly stay so clean! And then he complains about me to the HOA, it's ridiculous! And they let him get away with everything because he won that beautification award for his roses last year, while my shrubs and lawn ornaments get ignored!""

""Maybe if you cleaned once in a while, like I'm trying to do *right now*, he wouldn't be able to get away with dumping his trash over the fence."" A flash of white hit the corner of my eye and my heart skipped a beat. I whirled, and--oh. Just Alice, finishing up with the deliveries. I waved at her and took a deep breath, trying to slow my racing heart.

""Look, you'll be fine."" I forced a smile at Pat, and it seemed to work because she smiled back. ""I know the gallery will be a hit. You're incredible and your paintings are, too. A thousand years from now I'll be seeing your art in history books, I just know it!""

Her eyes widened. ""You... you really think so?""

""I know so."" My grin grew a bit wider, and far more genuine. ""If you get them done in time, at least!""

""Right!"" Pat nodded firmly and got to her feet, rushing over to me and wrapping me in one of her wonderful, warm hugs. I leaned into it. She smelled of fresh-cut grass and coffee and acetone, a combination that no one else I'd ever known in my many lives quite matched. ""Thanks, Ginny. I knew I could count on you!""

""Well, of course, what are sisters for?"" I flicked my hands at her. ""Now shoo! I've got to finish cleaning up the pub before the evening rush and you've got paintings to work on.""

""True, true."" She pecked me on the cheek and gathered up her bag, still smiling. ""Just promise me you'll watch out for the next silly thing that could kill you. Watering cans, really? What's next--bells?""

I laughed along with her as she left, and I bent back to my work. It was easy to laugh when I was sure I'd have decades left of safety before it found me again. And even The Goose couldn't find a way to kill me with *bells*, after all."

nintendo,fglrk3q,t1_fglljsn,1580909092.0,"That’s a good point, we never had all of the previous FE reps all together like this before.

Lucina could have been changed to an echo fighter without much difficulty, I think, or had her move set reworked a bit more, but I still can’t wrap my head around Chrom being added to the game. He was added so late to rep Awakening (two FE mainline games later!) and his daughter and ancestor (as well as his potential wife or son-in-law) were already in the game. Was he actually added to represent Tokyo Mirage Sessions or something and they just never mentioned it to us? Chrom should have been an assist trophy if they had to have him.
