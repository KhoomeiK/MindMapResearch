PrequelMemes,ff49q4v,t1_ff3xfku,1579558614.0,Just watch the famous clip from Justice Thomas’s Senate hearing. See the main figure he is speaking to.
StarWarsLeaks,ff48vhk,t1_ff3vnyk,1579558083.0,365 days in a galaxy of billions of planets/stars.. there is plenty of room.
dataisbeautiful,ff487f3,t3_erd4iy,1579557660.0,My gut says this is a weird thing to keep track of... is she your girlfriend or a science experiment?
StarWarsLeaks,fezi54h,t1_feyhkrv,1579457621.0,Like pretty much the entirety of Star Wars (except it really isn’t inaccurate).
StarWarsLeaks,fey2ff3,t1_fexb1ys,1579439827.0,He raises some of the most important questions in the entire franchise. “It’s all a machine partner.”
StarWarsLeaks,fexy3zy,t1_fewc9dc,1579438196.0,"I liked what we got, just wish they took the time to flesh it out."
StarWarsLeaks,feu7gsd,t3_epz5j4,1579383822.0,This annoys the hell out of me honestly. Literally something I’ve wanted to see for years and they actually considered it...
StarWarsLeaks,feu6zep,t1_feo3s7x,1579383752.0,"People ever took that Kenobi stuff seriously? I read the headlines and instantly thought “okay, sure....” can’t wait for next weeks confirmation Rian is still talking to Lucasfilm."
StarWarsLeaks,feu6pbm,t3_eq6ct3,1579383657.0,If I were the Editor I’d this film I would be hiding right now honestly.

space,fenfyhl,t1_fen6zmn,1579283853.0,Seriously. I’d love to take someone from even a few hundred years ago and try to explain this stuff to them.  We were even raised with it for the most part so it  part of it “makes sense” to us. I learned the term “future shock” not too long ago and I personally think our entire species is experiencing it right now. Although most have buried their heads in the sand it seems.
Art,fdzwfsp,t1_fdv3p5f,1578797439.0,Great work though.

Art,fduljzw,t3_emwkzs,1578734843.0,"Not insanity. Maybe realizing too much at once, but insanity isn’t the case."
StarWarsLeaks,fds9omq,t1_fdq4z8u,1578697571.0,"From your point of view, I’m sure that is the case. Hope you are able to appreciate it one day."
StarWarsLeaks,fdpnjzr,t1_fdpcntx,1578633788.0,"I agree, these things need to be explained in the EU and I’m sure they will be. Personally I’d like if it were based on the DNA of Luke’s hand. The saber was found and it was attached to his hand. It would be cool if Snoke was some twisted version of Skywalker DNA, which is something Palpatine would totally do."
StarWarsLeaks,fdpnbx9,t1_fdp2dfs,1578633585.0,"In many ways the theme is more important. 100 years from now that is what people will focus on. 

I didn’t find him scary, but I also didn’t view him as a joke. It is being explained in canon but he had been inside Ben/Kylo’s head since he was a young boy. That is pretty creepy.

Sometimes the most evil people are those who look the most innocuous.  But to be certain, most kids who watched it surely found him creepy."
StarWarsLeaks,fdp22hb,t1_fdnweef,1578618148.0,He might not be a straight clone. Maybe just engineered to be a flesh puppet.
StarWarsLeaks,fdp1xx3,t1_fdoem45,1578618061.0,"I thought it was pretty clear that Snoke wearing a golden robe is a jab at greedy billionaires and corporations. He’s literally a frail old man who drenches himself in wealth and power, like many who exist in the real world."
StarWarsLeaks,fdg5jh8,t1_fde8ad3,1578380872.0,Interesting. It’ll be fun to see what they keep and what they change.
StarWarsLeaks,fdg5gd5,t1_fddit41,1578380771.0,"I stand corrected then. I didn’t realize they ever clarified that. I believe you, but what’s the source? I wanna read up on it."
StarWarsLeaks,fddihru,t1_fd8zyp5,1578313640.0,"In legends you are 100 percent correct. AFAIK, in the current cannon they have never clarified that though. 

Between ep. 6&7 is the “new republic,” so naturally the Clone Wars era republic would be.... 

Like I said, I’m not sure, but I don’t think they have said a definitive title yet and honestly changing the phrasing would make sense and be easier for the general audience to follow anyways."
StarWarsLeaks,fddi757,t1_fd8xu11,1578313311.0,"My point is that I’m not sure they are going to use “old republic” in the old EU sense. The post Return of the Jedi Republic is called the “new republic,” so what does that make the Clone wars era republic?"
StarWarsLeaks,fd7cy5o,t1_fd766e3,1578202540.0,"It really wasn’t though. Every film has had to react to the prior one, but the main themes are consistent throughout unless you are too focused on other things. 

We’d be lucky to have him create a trilogy of his choosing. It doesn’t even matter if you like TLJ, watch any of his other films, the guy is one of the best of his generation."
StarWarsLeaks,fd7c52f,t1_fd6igj2,1578202211.0,Probably yes. This isn’t Legends. That’s what it seems like they are doing at least.
StarWarsLeaks,fd7bydd,t1_fd6gd6l,1578202141.0,"I agree. I expect his idea to be something not connected to previous or current lore at all, or at least I’d be surprised if that were the case."
StarWarsLeaks,fd7bs81,t1_fd6m0g1,1578202076.0,"Hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I kinda doubt they use “old republic” in the Legends sense of the term. This probably will be the “Old Republic” in the new canon. I could be wrong but it certainly seems like that it what they are going to do."
todayilearned,fcpemic,t1_fco2tun,1577860672.0,But they actually did in reality.
todayilearned,fco1qxx,t1_fcnzzvh,1577822502.0,"I did assume you were attacking it because Japan crucified hundreds of Christians. So, you implied that’s the way  to effectively “fight back” against it. I don’t think I have to explain how that reasoning is dangerous."
todayilearned,fcnynlv,t1_fcnqrnp,1577820981.0,"Thinking of Christianity as an ideology that needs to be  fought is pretty ignorant. I understand why people would dislike the organizations that surround it at times, but comments like these kinda make me cringe."
starwarsspeculation,fck7wmw,t1_fchtjgm,1577719042.0,"Agree to disagree. If you think TLJ is bad in that regard,  you must really be bothered by RotJ which has a few moments that come off like a Three Stooges skit along with serious story beats.  (Han and Lando by the Sarlacc pit comes to mind)"
starwarsspeculation,fck7dqm,t1_fck4zj8,1577718644.0,"Baby Yoda obviously didn’t learn it from a Jedi, and we don’t necessarily know where Rey learned it from. It’s just a pointless nitpick. Very amusing the way people react to this kind of stuff though. They’ve been making up and improvising force powers as they went along the entire series. Trying to pretend otherwise is silly."
witcher,fck1fvw,t3_ehlzvv,1577713646.0,Invest in alchemy.
starwarsspeculation,fcgriky,t1_fcfzznx,1577643326.0,"I must say I completely disagree that it is a “literal parody of the saga.” I understand not liking a lot of the jokes, that is almost entirely subjective, but TLJ is darker than most in the series and truly does cover themes that are prominent throughout the series. It deals with themes like the Military Industrial Complex, finding meaning in life, and learning from your greatest mistakes. 

It does follow/emulate a few story beats of episodes 5 and 6 though, but I personally liked how it was handled."
starwarsspeculation,fcgp2bn,t1_fcepb3e,1577642534.0,Actually funny you got downvoted when you are just explaining what the word ‘Saga’ means. Crazy stuff.
starwarsspeculation,fcgna08,t1_fcf5yky,1577641953.0,"I mean that is wrong on a few accounts, but okay. If you use that kind of logic the entire series (all nine) are nonsense and idk why you’d care in the slightest anyways. (Kinda can’t tell if you meant to be sarcastic though, lol)"
sports,fcehgnn,t1_fccetw8,1577620516.0,This is insulting to the Hanson brothers. (Had to google them.)

Showerthoughts,fce0jx6,t3_eh1f3i,1577615691.0,Thousands upon thousands of years of human history and one Bald man can magically fix it? Nah.
starwarsspeculation,fcdwdzx,t1_fcduyv6,1577614507.0,"You could ask the writers straight up what they meant and I’d be shocked if they gave you a definitive answer. It is meant to mean multiple things. I’ve been downvoted for suggesting that, but that 1000% has been the theme of most of the sequel trilogy."
starwarsspeculation,fcdhqfx,t3_eh30ke,1577610144.0,That depends on what point of view you are viewing the movie from.  Simple as that.
starwarsspeculation,fcdhd2r,t1_fcd8v7c,1577610017.0,It is called the “Skywalker saga.”

movies,fc6p301,t3_eg89av,1577485910.0,Whenever I watch a nature/science documentary the soundtrack from Arrival will start playing in my head. Movie is better each time you watch it btw.
StarWarsLeaks,fc4ygja,t3_eg3t1d,1577433923.0,"There is some weird stuff going on in a few sections of this fanbase right now. People who are clearly trying to create and promote narratives to justify their hatred of the sequel trilogy. Pretty bizarre, but to be expected. I just hope that not too many of them catch on, or at the very least people see through it."
PrequelMemes,fc4y3d6,t3_eg39cu,1577433429.0,People like you lack imagination and some basic understanding. I suppose you dislike the idea of baby Yoda as well?
starwarsspeculation,fc4xts5,t1_fc3onk5,1577433070.0,"100% agree with this. I don’t mind them moving Luke and Leia training, but as for the rest I totally agree. The current opening feels rushed, although I get why they did it for the theatrical version. (Also from what I understand there is a whole Lando subplot they cut as well.)"
starwarsspeculation,fc4xq7i,t1_fbw8h4r,1577432940.0,Pretty sure there in no basis in reality for that. Just a fans head canon/hopes.
starwarsspeculation,fc4xog3,t1_fbfx2at,1577432874.0,Nah. Broom boy actually makes an important point. Sith last would be out of place. Just extend it in TRoS. These aren’t marvel movies.
PrequelMemes,fc4ltu3,t3_eg1r9p,1577420483.0,"Thanks Baby Yoda, for preemptively killing this stupid argument/nitpick."
starwarsspeculation,fc4lnvj,t1_fc3zzc4,1577420337.0,"This is funny, I do think it’s been explained in Canon that It takes some time (except for the greatest Jedi Masters) to manifest themselves after death. Luke, Leia, and Anakin are exceptions. Even Qui Gon is just a voice IIRC."
StarWarsLeaks,fc4j4vy,t3_efiagn,1577418163.0,Have seen it multiple times and the beginning of this film still feels “off.”
