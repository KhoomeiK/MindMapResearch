Bum is not an actual verb—it’s a noun—but they used it like a verb; that’s why you’re confused. They literally said “Do not ass—even when empty.” They should’ve said “Don’t stick it up your bum—even when empty.”"
antiassholedesign,fce3f1n,t1_fce1rh9,1577616523.0,"Bum-even is not a word. The dash is a punctuation mark, like a semicolon. It’s used to emphasize the second clause (part) of the sentence.

Examples:

1) I love to run—it keeps me fit.
2) Pete said he didn’t steal my phone—he’s lying.
3) I’m a fan on Jennifer Lawrence—she’s very talented.

They used it like this: Do not bum—even when empty.
