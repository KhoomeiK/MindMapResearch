Objects in ""near Earth orbit,"" at altitudes of a few hundred kilometers, are still in a very thin part of our atmosphere. The friction of the air at that height slows things down, which is why the International Space Station has to be accelerated every few weeks by using a very small rocket motor, to get back up to its normal orbital altitude. When the Space Shuttle was orbiting at its usual altitude, which was lower than the ISS, photographs were taken of a very, very faint glow of the air hitting the shuttle and being ionized."

As if the galaxy was immersed in a blob of invisible matter, extending far beyond the edges of the observable galaxies. Spooky!"
AskReddit,fdu6yc0,t3_en1cjs,1578728661.0,"One of the ways that we can tell when dark matter is present, but it's not accompanied by stars/galaxies, is when we can see large clouds of very hot Hydrogen gas in apparently ""empty"" space.
