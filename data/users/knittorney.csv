What worked for me was swapping out anything with refined sugar with fruit, and now all plants and meats are “free” foods for me (because of the nutrition density). That was my process and it worked for me over the course of about a year; the point I’m making is that it is a PROCESS and you’ll get there. Just keep moving forward. Now I don’t even really miss sweets, but when I do, I skip the low calorie stuff and just eat the richest, creamiest version of whatever. I find that when I do that, I don’t overindulge, and I don’t really miss it in between because my body is so well nourished. 

You’ll get there. Keep going, and more importantly, be kind to yourself."
