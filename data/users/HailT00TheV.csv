CVS,ffdlmuj,t3_esyzqd,1579823501.0,Good for you !! We haven’t had a store manager since the end of August . My DL doesn’t scramble lol .
CVS,feo2wou,t3_eq4vo1,1579294404.0,When I first started working at CVS there was an op supervisor that I caught stealing manufacture coupons every week so I told the manager and he never did anything about it and then a couple months later another cashier notice she was stealing manufacture coupons because we started marking them so we could get proof and she called the ethics line And they sent lost prevention people to our store and they were there for about a week in the office going over footage but they never told anyone why they were there of course the manager already knew because of my previous complaint but they didn’t say anything to anybody until it came time to fire her . Sorry about the poor punctuation I’m using talk to text .

CVS,feebbmx,t1_fee9sjv,1579030238.0,I could but I’m constantly being paged for backup in the pharmacy and paged for customer issues so honestly I’d rather just get them done @ home . I don’t even care about being paid to do them .
