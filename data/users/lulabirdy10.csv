I use vet wrap all the time for Rosie, it’s super helpful to keep cuts and cracks and abrasions clean, and to prevent licking. And interesting about the hair trimming! I might just give that a try. I’ve tried the My Busy Dog boots, and they’re sturdy, but not so good at staying on. I’ll check out Ruffwear. :)"
