singapore,ffpv1ls,t1_ffmlrdr,1580106782.0,I use the LA Gel combined with The Ordinary Hemi Squalane oil. Still on the lookout for a leave in conditioner though.
news,ffnqd0c,t1_ffnq2a7,1580069333.0,It's been confirmed by BBC
fatlogic,ffnab8s,t1_ffn5hxr,1580063634.0,"I don't know if this is a liberal issue or more of an American characteristic, where the 'I' comes before society. ""MY weight, MY guns, MY rights to vaccinate..."" At least, that's my observation. And going by statistics, aren't the red states the ones who have the most obese people? So it seems that they too don't think about how their weight impact others."
singapore,ffmdh0g,t1_fflidjq,1580052905.0,"Wah leave her alone, she's living the dream. If the husband side is ok with it, no issue what."
singapore,ffmcd44,t3_eu6ptv,1580052349.0,"I buy online from iHerb. No luck finding in store in Singapore. Also, do take note that many of the curly approved products might not be suitable in Singapore's climate due to the high humidity! I tend to avoid an ingredient list with lots of humectants in it. And in my personal experience, using too much products in this climate tends to bog down our hair too, so try to simplify your routine if it contains too many products.

fatlogic,ffm9j61,t3_eu4kfq,1580050945.0,"Her poor family... this brainwashing has to stop. People need to learn to take care of themselves and that DOES NOT mean writing cutesy, body-positive affirmations on Instagram. Take care of your health for yourself and your loved ones. It's an utter shame and disgrace to eat yourself to the grave."
singapore,ffm4fbz,t1_ffjbrah,1580048308.0,I want to know if this guy traveled to Sengkang using public transport or had the brains to call the relevant authorities. I may be paranoid since I live in Sengkang but I believe we have the right to know.
singapore,ffm4aee,t1_ffk0rre,1580048211.0,"He traveled here on Wednesday too... I find that inexcusable. At the very least, those travelling from Wuhan should have had the foresight to inform the relevant authorities once they landed to check if they carry the virus.  If they don't carry it, no harm no foul. Carry on."
progresspics,ffk51gz,t1_ffk491x,1580016089.0,"Thank you! Lovely, I can buy it here in Singapore. Happy CNY!"
progresspics,ffjwg0e,t3_etvac5,1580008818.0,"Amazing progress, you've knocked it out of the park! And that's a gorgeous dress too."
BeautyDiagrams,fedw8zc,t3_eof0aa,1579021214.0,"I appreciate how you name the colours used and the exact products. It's kinda silly but often I have a hard time following tutorials if just the products are named, as I don't know what to substitute them with. But when you say to use a terracotta for example, I find it easier to pick a product from my collection and follow along the tutorial. Thanks!"
singapore,fdw9cnz,t1_fdtdhrb,1578756400.0,"Cinnamon and honey, milo, cocoa powder, flavoured protein powder, spreads (jam, lotus, nutella etc)... quite a lot of combinations out there"
singapore,fdw8e30,t1_fdw566i,1578756128.0,Usually gyms offer to measure body fat % when you sign up... I've heard Active Health Lab also have but I haven't tried that out yet.
singapore,fdw7g8v,t1_fdvy3dm,1578755896.0,Season 6 of B99 is out!
singapore,fcvjtw4,t3_eiv6eo,1578003621.0,"I believe this couple... I kena before at GV Yishun. The back of my thighs that had contact with the seat was covered in bites. After that incident, I have a phobia of sitting on those carpet material sort of seats."
WitchesVsPatriarchy,fcup1lp,t1_fcuj0og,1577985642.0,Thank you! It's titled Maelstrom for anyone else looking for it.
WitchesVsPatriarchy,fcuex79,t3_eiu3b2,1577979308.0,"i really like this painting, anyone has a source on it?"
fatlogic,fctu64h,t3_eip08v,1577959700.0,So close yet so far.
antiMLM,fc9dmoc,t3_egr5ra,1577551033.0,"Wait, since when has Body Shop being roped into these schemes? There are plenty of brick-and-mortar stores and they seem to be doing well."
