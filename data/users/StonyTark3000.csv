>""So you're he, are you?"" Sherlock asked, striding up to the man's desk.

>Peralta's brows furrowed. ""I guess I'm *a* he. I don't know if I'm the he you're after. But I might be he. Which he are you?""

>""Holmes. *Sherlock* Holmes."" He offered out a large hand. ""I was requisitioned by your superiors to help with the mysterious death of James Bombadi. You're to be my partner.""

>Peralta got up slowly, cautiously, and shook the man's hand. ""You been to a costume shop?""

>""Excuse me?""

>""My uncle used to dress like that, sometimes."" He lowered his voice. ""*The times he escaped.*""

>""You're hardly one to talk about dress, sir. Even my good friend Watson would be able to see that the faux-leather jacket, untucked shirt, un-ironed jeans, are all part of a façade. A costume of your own to give an impression of something you're quite clearly *not*.""

>""And... what am I not, exactly?""

>Holmes paused, raised an eyebrow and said, ""As stupid as you look. However, you are as greasy and bad breathed as you initially seem.""

>A lady with dark hair breezed by them. ""You give him *way* too much credit.""

>""We are to work together,"" said Holmes.

>""Right. On the murder of James Bo... Bomba...""

>""Bombadi. Thirty-two, single, murdered with an ice-pick on ninth avenue this very morning.""

>This information caught Peralta's attention. His face paled a little as he said, ""Well, it sounds like you've been briefed already. So, I guess this is legit.""

>""Briefed? Hah! No. I got those details from you. Just now.""

>""I don't think so. I didn't tell you anything.""

>""On the contrary. You told me everything, just without moving your lips -- which is kinder for everyone here, frankly.""

>""I don't follow.""

>""There's a wedge of wet brown clay at the front of your left shoe. The color tells me it's from a building site, the tinge of red tells me blood had seeped in to the mud at least an hour before you arrived. Pooled in, if you will. There are broken fragments of oak leaf still stuck in your hair -- the grease, you see, is like glue. It's mid-autumn, so that's quite understandable that leaves might fall on you. But the only street lined with oaks, with clay soil, with building work currently underway, is *ninth*.""

>""Incredible."" He shook his head. ""We could really use a brain like you here.""

>""Elementary.""

>""And the ice pick? How'd you know about that?""

>""Your left knee, where you knelt down near the body, is flecked with blood. That particular pattern of spatter is not likely to have come from a knife or a hammer -- too violent and fine for either. So a pick-axe or an ice-pick it is. And an ice-pick is the more likely of the two, in this town of modern wonders.""

>""You're going to put me out of a job.""

>""It's not hard,"" said Holmes. ""You just need to apply yourself.""

>Peralta nodded. ""Ok. Mind if I try? Figure out a few details about you?""

>Holmes snorted. ""Please, be my guest.""

>Peralta took a deep breath. ""You recently rented that terrible outfit and whoever sold it to you is a real criminal because, ugh, that hat. You yourself have recently been on ninth, and you're quite right about the ice-pick because I can see it sticking out of your left pocket, the tip covered red.""

>Sherlock looked down at the ice-pick and frowned. ""Quite acceptable. You'd make a good Watson, I do think.""

>""Oh, and Sherlock died a hundred years ago, along with his friends Doyle and Watson, so that kind of tipped me off from the start that I'd already caught a murderer. A drunken fly waltzed straight in to the spider's nest, you could say.""

>""Excellent deductions,"" said Holmes.

>A lady yanked Sherlock's arms behind his back and cuffed his wrists. ""He was a fictional character, Jake. *Idiot*. Then to Holmes, ""The clay on his shoe is dog shit. And it's why no one's been talking to you today, Jake. Could be anything in your hair though.""

>Jake shrugged, sat in his seat and leaned back. ""Maybe I stood in it to keep you away, Amy.""

>""Ah,"" said Holmes. ""I don't need to be the world's greatest detective to detect great love.""

>Their faces flushed red. ""World's fakest detective,"" Jake mumbled.

>Amy quickly turned and marched Holmes down the corridor.
