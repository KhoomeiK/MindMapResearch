CasualConversation,ffe4yzz,t1_ffe4ma4,1579836833.0,Guess theres not much reason to look up anymore then eh lol
CasualConversation,ffe48x6,t1_ffe3wz8,1579836288.0,"Lol on a serious note one of the most beautiful sights ive ever seen in my life was at my friends cabin in the upper peninsula of Michigan. There is almost nobody living around him for many miles and if you look up at the sky on a clear summer night its totally breathtaking. You could sit and stare at it for hours. I had never realized just how much of the night sky most people never see because of light pollution, you really have to find a remote place to really experience it. It makes you realize just how small we really are"
CasualConversation,ffe3tsc,t3_et4gbn,1579835978.0,Did you know tree blinds are very effective for hunting deer because they don't have the ability to look up?

CasualConversation,ff5boij,t1_ff5beu5,1579586403.0,How do you think guys feel?
CasualConversation,ff5bl1m,t3_erqbt8,1579586305.0,You need some tough love. Stop being a bitch. A healthy body leads to a healthy mind(the mind and body are very much connected) ive been doing p90x 6 days a week for the past 4 months and i feel amazing. Almost no stress/anxiety and im just happier in general. Your killing yourself slowly with your habits and your lifestyle will change how you feel. If all you ever feed yourself is junk food why would you ever expect to feel good? Your body is trying to tell you something. Listen to it
CasualConversation,ff5b433,t3_erq9t1,1579585836.0,Go approach them then

college,ff4sby1,t1_ff4r2yv,1579571262.0,That does sound tough. Well I wish you the best of luck!
college,ff4pegw,t1_ff4olkc,1579569249.0,Also ziprecruiter is really helpful for finding a job i would recommend getting on there if you aren't already. And if you find a job and your not really feeling it dont be afraid to apply to more places and keep your options open i went thru like 4 jobs in the past year before finally finding a place i enjoyed working at and was happy with.
college,ff4p0na,t1_ff4olkc,1579568980.0,Thank you! Dont worry you will find your way just dont give up and things will come your way. I was also considering going into finance so i took all the pre business classes but like i said i just lost motivation for school im more into learning things on my own thru books and the internet. Maybe you could be a financial advisor or something. How tough is it to find an internship?

They were willing to train me on the job because theres no degree that teaches you how to do that stuff. I got pretty lucky finding them they treat me really well there.

CasualConversation,ff4n6kh,t1_ff4mugf,1579567683.0,The hardest part is just staying consistent in the beginning but eventually it becomes a habit and you get more in shape so its not as hard plus you will begin to enjoy it almost. Ive been doing p90x 6 days a week for the past 4 months now so that would be my biggest advice just stay consistent and force yourself to go even on the days you really dont want too. You always feel the best after those workouts
pics,ff4mxhv,t1_ff4mr95,1579567505.0,I dont know if you remember seeing any of the polls for the 2016 election but almost none were accurate they all were saying 80-90% were for Hillary and you know how that ended up in the end. It seems like polls are almost always skewed and not accurate
college,ff4mrof,t3_ermkpu,1579567391.0,Used to be in your shoes until i just lost motivation and dropped out my 3rd year lol. To be fair i wasnt even sure what i wanted to major in so i was kind of wasting my time there anyways

Dirtbikes,fesofvm,t1_fer3izv,1579367409.0,Good to know! I was actually looking at the new kawasaki 250 i really like how that bike looks i would love to take one out for a ride.
guns,fepn6ys,t1_fepmwb3,1579324998.0,Hell yeah thats one im sure you will probably keep for your lifetime. Things always mean more when you make them yourself!
guns,fepmoa3,t1_fepmanu,1579324577.0,Well hey man if you enjoy it that much and feel its worth that much to you then have at it! I know exactly how you feel. Sometimes its worth it if its for personal satisfaction
Dirtbikes,fepm3ke,t1_fephktf,1579324107.0,Yes! Mine has so much torque! I like it because the throttle has so much travel if that makes sense. If you want to go slow you can no problem but if you want to pop some wheelies you can do it no problem in any gear! Theres always torque whenever you need it. Still tho i prefer the lightweight 2 strokes

Dirtbikes,fep4ex6,t1_fep3j7l,1579311892.0,Yeah it definitely is pretty heavy. Its not a slow bike at all but it probably should be a little quicker for a 525.. i only have the 4 speed but if i had the 6 speed i bet it would be a lot quicker. Either way ive been a 2 stroke guy my whole life so im switching back to most likely a newer 125 next summer. They are just so light and easy to whip around compared to this thing.

juul,fej3mil,t1_feiqi8e,1579155646.0,Same the discontunued ones are $30 for me also. Not worth it at all. Might as well buy a suorin air for that price its much cheaper overall and has tons of different flavors to choose from. The 45 mg nicotine fruit menthol flavor from mr salt e is my favorite its just as good if not better than mango juul pods and its only $15 or $20 to get a small bottle of it

Missing411,fefwi3n,t1_fefvtmo,1579067486.0,"Yes I know exactly what you're talking about. Im much more aware of everything around me and every sound when im out there. Ive felt that feeling a few times where my mind would race and I would feel like someone or something was about to walk over the hill or come out from behind a tree but I usually chalked it up to me overreacting and sat it out. I've only left the woods one time from that feeling, I literally left the woods running with my heart racing for no obvious reason. It feels like a 6th sense almost just telling you you need to get out of there asap. The woods can be a spooky place"

Missing411,fefv93s,t1_fefv6el,1579066304.0,Some of the Missing 411 cases were of hunters carrying guns. He made a movie about it.
Missing411,fefv1qc,t1_fefupp7,1579066114.0,That's a good point lol. I guess the thing that scares me the most about it is that no one has any idea what happens to the people when they go missing. Im probably just overreacting. Hopefully I'll get over it for next season.. gotta stay away from the missing 411 stories from now on haha.

Dirtbikes,fef84iz,t1_fef7hl5,1579050432.0,It definitely took a little while to get it going again maybe 10-15 kicks before it started (usually fires right up when cold starting and runs just fine until deciding to stall) but thats interesting i didnt even think about the stator.
