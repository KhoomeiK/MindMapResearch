Did I say all people who have threesomes have a lack of imagination? Did I give any indication I was talking about everybody who has them? I used generic in this context to imply that it's a common fantasy. Not to slander anybody who takes part in them.

I thought it was clear that we were talking about people who think they can save their relationship with one and the reasons they think it's a good idea (mostly ingrained by pop culture rather than any desire to have one or them simply wanting to fuck somebody else). People who have communication problems or issues with jealousy or subconsciously want the relationship to end. So rather than them doing something to fix it, they try to spice it up with something they know is acceptable because they might not actually have any major kinks.  

Are you seriously going to deny that some people (mostly men) say they want threesomes because it's the socially safe kink. That it isn't the go to male fantasy ingrained into unimaginative people by pop culture. Because the fact you want to watch your gf piss herself then spank her like a child might be a little too embarrassing to mention to a partner. Especially when you have a suspicion the relationship might be coming to an end. 


But what's important is you got to get that outrage fix and get to mention you had a threesome. Well done.

If it was terrible, the video would be allowed. if it was genuinely very good, it would be allowed but the show is in that sweet spot of being decent enough to like but not good enough to deflect criticism. So RLM coming in and reminding them how little like Star Trek it is is going to strike a nerve very hard. 

That and they're probably paid to keep it positive."

Got put on the road to diagnosis because an ambulance driver's wife had it.

The emergency room refused to take her because they thought she was a junkie but this hero was like 'okay I'll do that but, in case she dies, I want it recorded that I did everything I could to save her and it was you who refused her.' The amazing bluff worked and got her into the hospital and he told her to ask about Endometriosis first chance she gets."

Actual Socialism is more about the implementation of social programs which help long term to increase social mobility, generate more tax revenue or save the government money ie free or subsidised  medication means the government spends less on healthcare in the long run. Diabetics for instance won't require a hospital bed if they always get their insulin."

The only reason I argued with you is because you literally just went 'I disagree' and didn't actually and still haven't said anything to make me think you're not a rabid fanboy.

Flat angles, too much light in most shots and the fact they used some of the first digital cameras for them means they just don't look as good as the original trilogy. Which came out two decades before. 

You're using the fact they are old movies to excuse how they look but you only need to compare them to the blockbusters that came out at the same or the previous decade to see that you're full of shit. 

They literally fail at the most basic aspects of filmmaking."
cursedcomments,ffj0agl,t1_ffiyt06,1579987150.0,"Lol. There is only one shot in the entire phantom menace with depth of field. 

You have clearly learned the word 'cinematography' but clearly have no clue what it means. Like every shot that isn't a cartoon is shot, reverse shot which is student level filmmaking. 

You are aware that they came out at the same time as Titanic, Lord of the Rings, Pirates of the Carribbean and The Matrix which still look great, right? Movies in the late 90s/ early 2000s still look great. 

Apart from the bad ones.

cursedcomments,ffixnhg,t1_ffi4y55,1579985234.0,The question of how much CGI isn't important. The movie just looked bad. Too many flat shots and really poor blocking. Same with the lighting. The prequels are really ugly.
cursedcomments,ffix4ln,t1_ffhtd5x,1579984857.0,"Receive too much hate?

Mate, thry had massive budgets, the best technology of the time and a really interesting idea. And what did we get? Cartoon stormtroopers, the flattest camera work ever seen in a blockbuster, jar jar, some of the worst dialogue written and strobe light dance routines for fight scenes. 

Oh they are not that bad people say? Who gives a shit. We know they could have been better. 

People forget they came out at the same time as a B-movie horror director managed to make Lord of the Rings, an incredibly unfilmable book, into a masterpiece. 

Like be nostalgic all you want. Like them all you want. Don't let anybody say you cant. But don't think for a second that they're 'good films' because that's really insulting to the art form."
