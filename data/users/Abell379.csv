college,ffp1um0,t3_eu9gt8,1580084489.0,I think you'll find a much deeper world if you look for those worthwhile human connections. The world is a big place and I know you can find interesting people out there.
college,ffcx3q1,t3_esxumd,1579809084.0,"I think you know the cycle of being tired and doing homework that you wish you had more energy for. You seem really happy with your classes and material and I think that's a wonderful thing. There is a catch though that comes with that earned happiness:

""The pain I feel now is the happiness I had before. That's the deal"" - C.S. Lewis.

Now, I'm sure Lewis wasn't talking about mental exhaustion necessarily from classes, but I think he makes a powerful point on the tradeoffs we make in order to do interesting and cool things in school and life. You will be happy at some points, you will be sad at some points, what matters is you get a choice in designating some of that pain.

Best of luck! I believe in you."
Kenyon,ff8efup,t3_eam9qi,1579675007.0,"Hey, this is pretty late but I wanted to say congrats! I'm a  sophomore Bio major at Kenyon and would love to answer some of your questions. 

The OSE (Office of Student Engagement) has detailed forms for making a club, though I would recommend trying out a bunch of others first. One of many great things at Kenyon is people tend to be pretty involved. Whether it's sports or hiking or singing or dancing or whatever you can think of, there are interesting people working in those areas. 

Personally, I'm involved with a few clubs this semester: Outdoors Club, Ballroom, Stairwells (acapella group), as well as Land Lords, a land conservation group. I also work at Kenyon's Writing Center and joined the fraternity Phi Kappa Tau last semester. Life's been busy!

The Outdoors Club is wonderful and I'm actually working on a spring break trip proposal right now. We can apply for money from Kenyon for trips depending on interest and estimated cost. The BFEC (as another commenter mentioned) is amazing and it is a wonderful reserve for research, hiking, and general exploration, it is open to the public and the trails are quite nice. 

I'm a firm believer that boredom is largely a myth and the cure is usually self-driven, and Kenyon is a great place to find and work on those things you are passionate about. 

PM me if you have any questions! I'm always happy to talk more about Kenyon. It's been a great opportunity and good luck!"

college,ff7ah4n,t3_es1w0m,1579644632.0,"Sometimes we get really engrossed in our own work and lose sight of what makes us begin the work in the first place. Try pulling out a piece of paper and writing down what you value and enjoy in your life, then take a look at what you're aiming for (in this case, a nursing degree). Seeing those two lists can help you see what matters to you, even if it doesn't feel like that right now. 

I think you'll be surprised at your perspective after doing this. I know it helped me when I was feeling lost in Biology last semester."
college,ff7a64p,t3_ertqju,1579644383.0,"I go to a very small university as well, but if anything it encourages me to stay involved with clubs and other social activities. Try going out and meeting people, though it's always hard that first semester."
college,ff7a1f8,t3_es1ex4,1579644274.0,"I would expand your range of questions. First off, professors have office hours not just for the material they cover, they can also provide wonderful advice on how to succeed in their class or if you're interested in how they got to teaching the subject, I would recommend that. 

Be interested in professors. They aren't so different from you or me and I personally think they would enjoy someone taking an interest in their life."

But... this may be naive of me, but I think there's a lot we can find in each day since the world is such a big place. Good luck with the repetition though, it can definitely feel like that sometimes."
DecidingToBeBetter,ff554so,t3_erlpuk,1579580508.0,"Hey man, I feel you. It seems like you have a lot of pressure on yourself right now and that's probably pretty painful.

college,ff4n73a,t1_ff38bz7,1579567693.0,I don't know what your college experience has been like but I've found that doing clubs and activities really improved how I met people and made friends in the first place. Do you have hobbies that would fit that idea?
college,ff4mxyc,t3_er72ir,1579567514.0,"From reading this question and some of the responses, I think that asking about depression before and during college is shortsighted. Some of the answers here just involve general sadness (which everyone has felt) rather than just those depressed people. Maybe add a serious tag next time? 

College is a stressful, formative time for many people and I'm sure being depressed on top of it all would be much harder."

changemyview,fehoyvu,t3_ep5rpy,1579120973.0,"I think you ignore the benefits of a broad and basic cultural education for a healthy society. Teaching some level of facts across a vast range of disciplines allows students to get interested in many different things.

For all the memes about trite phrases like ""the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell"" or ""A^2 + B^2 = C^2"", it shows that our society values instruction regardless of whether the student may use it for a career.

Why can't we trust each other to reflect on our lives and decisions, and try to do good in our own way? The assumption you suppose that keeps needling me is that people can't move past trauma without professional help."
changemyview,fehmivn,t3_ep5v8m,1579119563.0,"I feel like you're asking the wrong question here. I think you're talking about the introspective behavior people engage with on their own or with groups of people they trust. I don't think using therapy as a blanket word for all of those different social interactions is intellectually honest, in terms of looking at human behavior."
changemyview,fefzwi3,t3_eo7dy7,1579071050.0,"Ok, let's follow your argument so far. Right now, you are a thinking, living person looking at a computer or phone screen as I write this. You're in a town or city within a country, and that country makes up a portion of Earth. As we pull back from Earth, where the only life we know of exists, we can see the rest of the Solar system disappear from view.
Pull back even farther and perhaps you can see the whole Milky Way. And beyond that, pulling back and back and back until you hit something. The slowing and expanding edge of the universe. 

My point of this exercise is to show how small our lives are in comparison to the world at large. And given this brief passage of time, is there any other point than to be alive?

You say meaning is a human construct. I disagree. Based on the lifeforms on Earth (and hopefully out in space), I believe the inherent meaning of life is to be alive. You can do what you want after that, what matters is that the universe seems to function around this basic premise."

TopMindsOfReddit,feb0yek,t1_feauw44,1578954348.0,"Again, say why. If you believe it so fervently you've got to have a tangible reason. 

I hope you keep thinking about why you believe what you believe. Instead of turning to the camp of easy hatred and demonizing others, look at the arguments and what those mean in reality. That's closer to the truth."
TopMindsOfReddit,feaswtj,t1_feai6xr,1578951908.0,"Who's they? Again, you haven't addressed my main point. Don't downvote me just because you disagree. Give me some tangible reasons and I'm happy to question and debate.

The definition of a healthy democracy is that private citizens can elect people to be representatives of the nation. We do this in the US by electing people to serve in the House of Representatives. Seizing power while ignoring the opinions and equal votes of other citizens is profoundly anti-democratic and oppresses the very people you wish to protect.

And the US is not fascist (I can't believe I have to make that clear). We are definitely not a totalitarian one-party state and democracy is not dead (Again, stating the obvious). We do not live in North Korea (literally a fascist country). Calling your political enemies with slurs like ""Trumptards"" and ""Nazi"" without any reasoning or historical context is meaningless. 

Voter participation has hovered in the 50% range since 1968, I don't know why you don't know that. 

If you're not willing to even talk to people about why you disagree with them, you will never get anywhere. I'm trying to be rational here. I have good friends who voted for Trump in 2016 but at least I ask them why they voted for Trump. You refuse to even engage. They can give me their honest answers and I can question further and we can both learn from each other rather than just castigate each other without any meaning whatsoever. 

Trump isn't a Nazi either. I won't spend much time on this. It just shows me you don't know what that word means and you don't understand the history behind that word.

I don't think you know what fascism means. I recommend taking a peek at this, you might learn something and use terms with more accurate intent: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism

TopMindsOfReddit,feah5pz,t1_feacdi2,1578948650.0,"You're not the parent comment but I'll reply to you anyway. 

Just because you disagree with their policies does not give you the right to remove their humanity. The US is intentionally a representative democracy which effectually means that we vote for the people we think best fit to lead and make decisions for us. What you describe sounds like straight authoritarianism and being a dictator.

If you're going to spend your life hating other people because they voted for Trump, I think that you won't convince anyone to change their vote and more importantly, I don't think you will be happy about it.

Hatred is not the answer to hatred.

Libertarian,fdzy3u6,t1_fdx0uy6,1578798639.0,"So you think people should be able to drive drunk as long as there aren't reckless? That doesn't make sense. Drinking before driving is reckless behavior. How do you define reckless driving?

Sleepy driving is a crime in a few states, though it's usually called drowsy driving. Source: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/11/04/why/830600001/

Let me say it another way. In general, we trust that people will try to drive safely, proving that they can follow the rules of the road. This is backed up by licenses and insurance agreements. So why on earth would it be okay to let people drive drunk? They are making a conscious decision to drink and drive and risking other people's lives in the process. 

It would be like someone getting drunk and then going to a gun range to shoot a few rounds. That is never a good idea."
Libertarian,fdtsovf,t1_fdsx4gr,1578721589.0,"That's a tougher situation. Thanks for the context. It wouldn't be just for a person with ADD medication to be treated like a drunk driver. I just wanted to emphasize the conscious choice people make when they drive drunk and how that impacts the safety of others around them.

Based on what you've said, there should be stronger protections for those with medications, such as recognizing the prescriptions or doctor's note as you mentioned. That would be much fairer."

Libertarian,fdskx3o,t1_fdseiuc,1578704495.0,"So by your logic, threatening to kill someone isn't a crime? Sending death threats isn't a crime? Precrime is meaningless in this case since drunk driving is a crime.

I can't tell if you're trolling or not. The victims of drunk driving are about 10,000 people per year. Saying it's victimless is just ignoring the facts and frankly ignores the aftershocks of those deaths. 

Given that alcohol slows your reaction time and puts other people in danger, it is not okay to drive drunk. Same with any other drug that affects your ability to operate a vehicle."

> ""I think it's quite simply the best food movie ever made,” Tony wrote today in an email. “The best restaurant movie ever made--the best chef movie. The tiny details are astonishing: The faded burns on the cooks' wrists. The ""personal histories"" of the cooks...the attention paid to the food...And the Anton Ego ratatouille epiphany hit me like a punch in the chest--literally breathtaking. I saw it in a theater entirely full with adults--and the reaction to that moment was what movie making was once--a long time ago--all about: Audible surprise, delight, awe and even a measure of enlightenment. I am hugely and disproportionately proud that my miniscule contribution (if any) early early in the project's development led to a ""thank you"" in the credits. Amazing how much they got ""right.""

I'm assuming that human imagination is infinite and therefore, knowledge and skill are infinite relative to the human lifespan.

Sure, there are diminishing returns and increasing tradeoffs once you get far enough is a skill, but that depends on your ""Why"", the personal motivation and drive towards whatever skill or field you focus on.

Your question is focused on the abstract nature of working hard and the advantages people are born with, either talents or circumstances. There's so much luck in it. There's a quote from Garry Kasparov, the former world chess champion, about his work with improving opportunities for women's chess: ""Talent is universal, but opportunity is not, and talent cannot exist in a vacuum"". I think the question should pivot towards how we find opportunities. The people that generally succeed find and use the most opportunities available at a given time. I think that statement holds true outside of hard work or talent. 

That being said, I like the Pong clip you showed!"
