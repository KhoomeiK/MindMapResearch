Also, people are assuming that the boyfriend's saying that you got to see people you hadn't seen in a while was just a lame excuse.  But maybe he authentically thought that's why he could get away with pulling such a dirty trick, because you actually want to socialize outside of the relationship more, so you'd be happy about that.

The fact is that you chose to go about this the way you did with no regard to your mother's feelings because it was the most convenient option for you.  You wanted to avoid broaching the subject of legacy-izing and avoid the responsibility and fall-out from doing it.  So instead of finding out from a relative that this method of grief was cut off from her, she found out from a computer screen.  And it backfired big-time, with your mom (rightly) blaming you.

You and/or other relatives should have gotten some courage and told her what was going to happen, or maybe even discuss it as a group without taking immediate action.  Because it might have been best, reasonable, and rule-abiding that the account was turned to legacy, but was it really necessary?  If you don't want notifications from a dead person, why not just un-""follow"" that person?  Why does her Facebook account in particular need to be the place for a memorial?  That's not what Facebook was designed for; it's just a side-effect of what many families find best - but not, it seems, your family and your mom.  That's especially true with your family members waiting for a year or two to ""send \[Grandma\] messages"" just so they can do it on a legacy Facebook account.  That's bizarre, honestly.  I'm pretty sure Facebook doesn't have exclusive rights to the afterlife.

Finally, your mother being alcoholic works against your case, not for it.  How does it help an alcoholic for family members to take something (other than alcohol) away from them anonymously?  That's just kicking the vulnerable.  Yes, your mom shouldn't have been using the account, yes alcohol is a bad way to deal with grief, and yes it's probably not healthy for her to cyber-stalk you (though asking to add someone on Facebook is hardly ""stalking,"" and that's the one concrete example you gave).  But it seems like you're piling these things on so that everyone here lands on your side in spite of the crappiness of your actions.  It seems to be working, but your real concern should be how it works on your family, not a bunch of strangers on the Internet.

If I were you, I'd warn your cousin to check out all the ingredients of what she eats.

Punishing your daughter for your husband's sins is far worse than being an inconsiderate oaf, even if the latter would merit AH status in isolation.

Then again, I'm assuming that she was the designated cook on the day in question, he wasn't, and the daughter just decided to make something for herself as an experiment for a future day's family meal.

In fact, I'd guess that, as the closest person to OP's family, the fiancee knew the store's policies best.  Which means that blowing up her life (via a rational or irrational decision process) makes more sense than coincidence or thinking she'd get away with it.

This is the most upvoted post of all time on this sub, so... yeah.

ETA: Hijacking my own comment, because I have a few things I'd like to get off of my, er, chest.

First, as soon as I saw this, I knew what was coming, judgment-wise.  AITA loves braless women.  We're got [an OP judged an AH for broaching the subject of her sister going visibly braless at a *funeral*](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ckvic8/aita_for_fighting_with_my_sister_over_going/), [we've got an OP not being an AH for ignoring her boyfriend's repeated pleas to not show 'em off in public](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/e6d3ig/aita_for_going_braless_in_spite_of_bfs/), and [we've got a woman with 40Is (ETA 3 - oops, originally said ""L"") having a boyfriend being called an AH (and her not) for repeatedly asking her to put on a bra in mixed company (and her ignoring his pleas)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/cnqa5h/aita_for_refusing_to_wear_a_bra_while_my/eweipha/?context=8&depth=9).

So, yeah, I get it.  AITA wants to free the nipple.  I'd guess that it's a combination of people eager to call all gendered dress codes ""sexist"" and people who just want to see more women's nipples.  Woke and wank are certainly two overrepresented communities among those who take time to grace Internet forums in general, and AITA specifically.

But acknowledging gender isn't ""sexist"" (or ""misogynist"" or any other ""-ist"").  There are just certain things in certain communities that are appropriate based on gender for certain sensible - or sometimes just quirky cultural - reasons.

And they don't always cut in favor of men.  A presentation in front of class wearing tight-fitting bicycle shorts?  If you're female, you might raise an eyebrow or two; if you're a guy, maybe a sexual harassment charge or two.  Jeans as ""business casual""?  It's often a ""yes"" for women and a ""no"" for men.  Got a plunging V-neck?  Okay for women in most cases, but no one wants to see your ample chest hair, guys.  Heck, if the aforementioned pajama boy really had worn traditional pajamas (plunging neckline), he might've gotten the first talking-to for similar reasons.  I'd really love to see a photo of the type of ""pajamas"" that ""half the people in \[OP's\] classes"" wear.  I'm guessing they're baggy T-shirts and loose sweatpants, and that women there can get away with the same.  Even from her prof.

Point being, reasonable people understand that there are different standards for a reason.  That said, it's not unusual or terrible to go braless if it's not obvious that's what's happening.  Plenty of women do it without a problem.  But when the professor can single you out from the front of class, then it's very obvious.  And distracting.  And if it's distracting to a professional woman, it's probably distracting to nearby students, too.  Plus, I have no idea why OP would wear something that showed off her assets during a Canadian winter, the type of weather that favors clothes that tend to be non-nipple showing.

Anyway, if OP wants to continue going visibly braless, she can give it a go.  But she's liable to get a worse reception in the real world than she's gotten here.

ETA 2: Since this *is* a judgment sub, I'd say INFO, since we don't know OP's level of obliviousness to the obviousness of her showiness.  But, contrary to almost everyone else, I'm putting it firmly in the N A H to Y T A spectrum, with YWBTA to give a repeat performance for the same professor.

ETA 3: Thanks for the silver; it helps make up for this going from highly upvoted to highly downvoted in no time, er, flat!"

I'm also curious about the interaction itself.

You need to understand that it's not just your *preference* to not be touched, but boundary-setting that everyone should be doing with this kid.  Even if you felt okay being touched, he shouldn't be allowed to do it like that.

You also need to learn (or get a refresher) that often times doing what's right makes us feel like jerks.  If you ever have a kid of your own, there's going to be some point at which you need to decide between doing what's right and not making the kid upset.  It seems to me you're on the path to making that choice correctly (i.e., doing what's right).  (Though there might be a resource out there that gives you more options other than just yelling.)

Your boyfriend needs to learn that he's wrong in so many ways - not telling the kid to stop, saying it's not sexual (because, even if correct, it won't be correct in a few years).  Assuming he's (one of) the kid's (unofficial and/or temporary) guardian(s), he needs to man up and start acting like it.  If he and the kid are living together, this is no longer stuff that he can just ignore, as he no doubt did when just visiting family on holiday.

The OP needs to understand that the family members were using the excuse of an eating disorder to dump all over the host, which is not a cool thing.  Something likely would have happened even without OP, and there was nothing OP could have done better, at least not in the moment.  (See below.)

The SIL needs to understand that ""veganized"" versions of traditional foods are terrible to serve in mixed company.  They don't taste exactly like the originals, and many people feel they fall into the food equivalent of an uncanny valley (or a bad characature).  If she's going to continue throwing dinner parties for non-vegans, she needs to work on dishes that aren't patterned off of non-vegan dishes.  There's plenty in this world that is vegan and good, but making fake cream sauce with whole wheat pasta palatable to the masses would be a major challenge for even the most accomplished chef in the world.

Also, if she's going to ask others to account for her dietary preferences, she needs to try harder to account for theirs.  Warning that you might not eat much seems like a missed communication opportunity as it doesn't indicate what your dietary preference is or even that you have one.  It's unclear to me just what the SIL knew, and what her husband - the one person privy to all these issues - thought would happen.  He's a potential stealth AH for setting up the conditions under which this happened.

AmItheAsshole,fedjwcu,t1_fe9q4pu,1579013382.0,"Agreed, *but* this raises an obvious question: Which do you like more, the sofas or the friend?  You're totally not required to do anything and might even feel that giving in would open you up to more problems, but this seems like a unique situation, so you may have to decide between the two.  ""They're actually mine"" is an annoying thing to go through your while life hearing (though that might be reason to offload the friend rather than the sofas).  At least let them know that their efforts to bully you are making them very uncomfortable to be around, and certainty not working in their favor."
AmItheAsshole,fedhydx,t1_fecwvsi,1579011991.0,"In fact, OP didn't even say that *she* was opposed to this abortion, just that her parents would be hurt if they knew about it, and that she thought there was another option.  Obviously she *preferred* it not to happen, but she didn't indicate anything stronger than that about this abortion or anything about abortion in general.  Honestly, from the comments about her brother, it seems more of a matter of wanting *him* to have progeny than of any problem with abortion.

This assumption to the contrary makes me wonder whether some of the harsher judgments here are colored by politics.  Though, yeah, the ""grandparents"" comment really was too far here.  ""If *you* wanted to carry the child to term, we'd be more than happy to adopt and include you as much or as little as you desire,"" should have been all OP said; anything more was guilting (though it seems even that much would be too far for many here)."

Still, she should establish a premium if it happens again, perhaps the cost of equivalent take-out, with tip, plus 50% to dissuade future theft."
AmItheAsshole,febyui9,t3_eo1hkd,1578964437.0,"NTA (and he is) but consider that Redditors are accusing your boyfriend of:

* ""gaslighting"" you (false: a difference of opinion over the importance of a lie is not ""gaslighting"");
* ""isolating"" you (by encouraging you to go to a movie alone with your friend?);
* showing ""red flags"" (plausible, though always a Reddit fave).

Your friend may have the same reaction, so correcting your boyfriend might have implications you're not considering.  Obviously you don't want to put up with continued mistreatment (and I expect downvotes from those who think I'm implying otherwise), but you should still be prepared for friends to turn against him if you reveal his behavior.  Honestly, either way, you really need to confront him directly, since this isn't healthy.  If he's going to lie, he should do so about his family issues, not yours.  And if he's not going to take your concerns seriously after several attempts at a discussion, *then* get out."

ETA: Not to mention that, with the lock, every time he enters his own bedroom and sees the lock, he'll be reminded of his wife's father.  ""Get a lock"" seems to be Reddit's first answer to every ""keep out of my room"" problem, but, often times, it is *not* the best solution."

A progressive tax would have been a clearer violation of Article I, Section 9, while a proportional (""flat"") tax stood some hope of passing the Supreme Court.  (It was a 5-4 decision.)

ETA: Okay, 24th only means that failure to pay a poll tax won't be grounds for denying a citizen the vote, not that poll taxes are banned all together.  But poll taxes themselves were still constitutional in 1894... as long as they were local or state taxes (and, back then, *could* be grounds for denying the vote - are were used to do precisely that).  Anyway, income taxes aren't poll taxes."

I understand you don't want to let her do anything you wouldn't do otherwise.  However, not letting her (and, if public, Google and Internet Archive and advertisers) see your grief over a friend she didn't like anyway might be something you think is a good idea even if she hadn't said a word.

But, again, it's all about what your preferences are.  Given that this was enough of a headache to post, it seems like you'd want to avoid conflict where reasonable (if such reasonable cases exist).  Even if you don't want any relationship with her, at the end of the day, your brother has to deal with her at home, so that could be a factor in your decision making.  But I'm just suggesting options; you're the one who knows the actual situation best, and thus what to do.  Good luck."
