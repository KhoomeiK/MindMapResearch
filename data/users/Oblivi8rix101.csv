bulletjournal,fcwervw,t3_eiyhwn,1578023775.0,"For small errors I keep a white pen and color in the error. 

For large errors, I usually keep a blank page from the bullet journal and keep it, so when I do make a mistake I can just cut it out and glue it onto the page. 

And when I mess up a whole page I just rip it out. :D"
