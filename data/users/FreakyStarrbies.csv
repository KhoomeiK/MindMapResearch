Wentworthtv,fdl6gel,t1_fdj1lj8,1578517853.0,"Unless I‚Äôve missed them, I can‚Äôt think of one that‚Äôs better. There are a few that has good writing and/or dialogue, like Sopranos.  Actually, Sopranos is the only one that comes to mind, and even that doesn‚Äôt measure up. I can‚Äôt put my finger on it. It seems like American shows take actors who have been trained, and direct a written script with who they have. But Wentworth seems to train their actors as they direct. I‚Äôm not saying that‚Äôs the way it actually is, it just seems that way. There are a lot of similarities in Wentworth‚Äôs actors. For instance, Ferguson, Boomer, Frankie, Vera, and Bea have all seemed to have changed personalities as circumstances changed. When Furg went from Gov to prisoner, when Vera gained confidence as gov, when Frankie got with ‚ÄúGidget‚Äù, etc. it seemed like they were instructed how to act.  In American tv shows, they maintain their personalities, for the most part. Also, I like the sound effects, like when Bea told off the gov at the mattress bonfire, and during heated flirting, that subtitle heavy breathing sound effect. I can‚Äôt explain it, but it‚Äôs better. It‚Äôs just my opinion, though.

Also the times she kept firing Bridgett, then rehiring her when it suited her needs. 

She kept covering for Jake, clueing him in about being investigated, then lying to Will about it when he called her on it. In her defense, she really didn‚Äôt believe he was the dodgy officer, or she probably wouldn‚Äôt have told him. 

But it‚Äôs darn good acting, and overall she‚Äôs one of my favorite characters...if not THE favorite. They are all very good actors and actresses. There are a couple who I believe could use a bit more training, but I couldn‚Äôt do any better, so I‚Äôm not judging."

So she has no clue she is back under Ferg, and is unknowingly manipulated by her all over again. I don‚Äôt think Will would be out, even as badly as he wanted out in the last season.

Wentworthtv,fcugua7,t3_eijmdt,1577980632.0,"My theory was the same, except it was Turk who dug her out, per the instruction of Jake.  Turk would have no problem finding and killing a Ferg look-alike.  Jake can give Turk the teals in advance, so he could swap the two (Ferg and look-alike) out immediately.  She‚Äôs given Turk money before, and would do anything for more of where they came from.  Where would Ferg live?  She could be staying in her own home with Shane, who covers for her while he‚Äôs there. She could have willed everything to Shane in advance, in exchange for living there and keeping the place up; hiding her after the escape, etc.  Ferg was detailed about money trails, so this would be the way to keep her house and have It all in Shane‚Äôs name.  Shane is the type of personality to ride with the waves and allow her to live there after her escape, which would allow him to have a secure place to live, as well. But anything could happen to cause her to become homeless. When Jake had that convo with Brenda, he could‚Äôve shared everything, and that‚Äôs when she started blackmailing Vera. Jake has learned a lot from the freak, including how to frame someone; and since both hated Will, they could‚Äôve had it set up so he would be the one to ‚Äúkill‚Äù her.  Ferg had it all set up for the police to dig up the body to secure her death status, allowing her to move freely without the police always looking for her."
