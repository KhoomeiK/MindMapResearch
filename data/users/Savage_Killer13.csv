delusionalcraigslist,ffpt6gk,t1_ffe6spl,1580104785.0,There’s companies that take vhs tapes and turn them to digital. Also Walmart sells aux cords wired to cassette tapes for old cars with old stereos.
delusionalcraigslist,ffpswg6,t1_ffi0x8n,1580104498.0,Well that’s how it goes usually. Gas in the US means gasoline so it makes sense.
delusionalcraigslist,ffpsukk,t3_etl758,1580104442.0,Definitely seems like a good price. Especially with it being a newer model makes it better. Also good find on the misspell as that shows very few people have come across it. So tip for looking online. Search for common misspelling of items to get better prices or lower searches and views of the item.
delusionalcraigslist,ffps702,t1_ffhyth0,1580103786.0,"Especially one thing is they said 200 dollars for a replacement. You’re paying 450 for a 2 year old basically broken tv, then 200 or more to get get it fixed."
delusionalcraigslist,ffps2m5,t1_ffovq9g,1580103668.0,Technically you could call it dickbutt
delusionalcraigslist,ffprp0m,t1_ffk5d1p,1580103301.0,"If you need something else to clear your mind, here it is. r/eyeblech"
delusionalcraigslist,ffprmpi,t1_ffpmtvv,1580103240.0,Looks like it.
delusionalcraigslist,ffprldq,t1_ffkq1c1,1580103204.0,"If the tv is the right model, when it does the tv can be salvaged and some components can be very useful. If it’s correct there should be a fresnel lense on it which could make a contraption that uses sun for high heat (like up to 1000 degrees Fahrenheit)."
delusionalcraigslist,ffpraob,t1_ffo06je,1580102918.0,That’s too little. Probably 50-75 dollars because of the engine.
delusionalcraigslist,ffpr36f,t1_ffpp437,1580102716.0,"Obviously your comment is a joke. But I have this model office chair and this happens from peeling the fabric. I do it when bored and is satisfying. It’s a good quality chair (squeaks a lot) and is a tilting(?) chair. It’s comfortable too. Have sat in it for maybe 3 hours straight and no major problems.

Edit: removed a sentence about price."

FiftyFifty,ffozv5g,t3_etc0sl,1580083773.0,I got the puppy three times before the crash. You can see I wanted to see the car crash.
FiftyFifty,ffoypnx,t3_eteawd,1580083403.0,Tapping to read comments (yes I know r/foundthemobileuser) I got the thumbnail for the bad one. I clicked it and got the good one though.
FiftyFifty,ffoyehd,t1_ffhhr6k,1580083260.0,Wrong. Toothpick in the area and kick a wall.
FiftyFifty,ffoxkz5,t1_ffi1w2y,1580083069.0,Obligatory r/inclusiveor
FiftyFifty,ffotwd3,t3_etxk9j,1580081766.0,I’m so far lucky today. Two true posts and they both were the SFW ones. I’m going to see the other side now though.
FiftyFifty,ffosbs0,t1_ffkamax,1580081059.0,Glitter being invented is the horrible accident itself.
FiftyFifty,ffos3bx,t3_eu6rjz,1580080961.0,At first I got hammer man. Second time I got hammer woman.
FiftyFifty,ffoqm52,t3_eucgnz,1580080490.0,This is done way too much. And what I mean is arm wrestling with too little room on a table or something.
FiftyFifty,ffopqp2,t3_eudrdx,1580080271.0,I need the whole video now if possible.
FiftyFifty,ffopk0s,t1_ffnnzcv,1580080203.0,You still could count this as nsfw. It’s not bad but I don’t think you want people seeing you in a different perspective.
FiftyFifty,ffop0rm,t3_eudlod,1580080092.0,At first I though it was the nsfw. But then I saw clothing and knew it was the second one.
FiftyFifty,ffooedf,t3_eucmcl,1580079911.0,This is truly two ways.
eyeblech,ffomdsq,t1_ff5x8e0,1580079129.0,Yes it was. F in chat to the man/woman and the car.
eyeblech,ffoh0xu,t3_et5u4p,1580077561.0,Are we going to even question the fact this m&m is a female.
eyeblech,ffogvzw,t1_ffjvmt0,1580077512.0,Looks like the last one.
eyeblech,ffogmms,t3_eudng9,1580077421.0,I don’t know where but see about getting on the black web as there’s worse than this in the deep dark. As a precaution. Don’t tie a row to get yourself back up or you’ll get tracked.
eyeblech,ffofu7g,t3_eu9weh,1580077259.0,So does the person here (possibly op) pee through their balls or dong.
BeAmazed,ffjxnp5,t1_ffjpemp,1580009787.0,Dogs are truly gods. And also truly god bois too.
aww,ffiw0i6,t3_etvzdp,1579984054.0,I have never seen a corgi jump around this much. Especially a puppy.
Minecraft,ffivv8h,t3_etvze6,1579983948.0,See if you can get every sound to be translated. It’d be like that one resource pack that has villager sounds for common sounds.
