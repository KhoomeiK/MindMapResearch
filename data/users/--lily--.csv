take that little brass gear out, its attatched by 2 black grub screws, and clean the teeth

make sure the nozzle isn't way to close to the bed and it's actually pushing plastic out

if plastic is coming out inconsistently or anything, you may have a clog

the black plastic arm its attatched to is shitty, doesn't tension enough, and can crack. so check it for cracks.

ender3,ffauboa,t1_ffapyvs,1579744668.0,"for the ender 3 in general? oh boy so many, i set mine up on christmas day and have been nonstop printing since. prepare for some rambling. 

first of all throw the assembly guide out. it's garbage. literally don't even bother. follow along with this instead https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me8Qrwh907Q

before I forget, the printer comes with a tiny amount of plastic to test it, but not enough to print it. stick to pla at the start, then petg is superior in a lot of ways, but not that much better, and harder to print. i'd stay away from abs if i were you, it's dirt cheap, but stupidly hard to print without a temp controlled enclosure. amazon basics or hatchbox is good if you're in the us and want something that'll arrive quickly. if you can, get something that isn't stupidly bright or dark, makes it easy to spot errors when you're just starting out. 

one thing that's super important to note before you even start printing is that the ender 3 has no thermal runaway out of the box. that means that if something happens to the temperature probe in the hotend, it'll read 0c, think ""hey I need to be at 200c"" and put more power thru the heater. But the probe is broken, so it keeps reading 0, so the printer keeps getting hotter, and so on and so forth. This is known to start fires. you'll need an arduino uno or a raspberry pi to burn a bootloader to flash firmware that has thermal runaway. it seems complicated but if you just follow along with a guide, it's actually quite simple. no matter what you do, the worst thing you can mess up is the bootloader, in which case you'll just have to burn it correctly then flash firmware again for the printer to work. you can't brick the board.   https://howchoo.com/g/mge1mdfkzjv/ender-3-bootloader-firmware-update-marlin

get any cheap arduino uno clone if you don't have one so you can burn the bootloader, plus figure out which cables you'll need for burning the bootloader and get those toohttps://www.aliexpress.com/item/32964588171.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.355f7a41dG2WBt&algo_pvid=1139c062-bf05-429c-916c-c3ae163d8b13&algo_expid=1139c062-bf05-429c-916c-c3ae163d8b13-5&btsid=fe5f7c84-42a0-4a65-8d1f-910fe217b68e&ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_3,searchweb201603_53 

till you have thermal runaway protection, don't leave the printer unattended.

the one other saftey checks you should do are making sure the x60 power connector is crimped, not soldered, and doesn't get warm during use, and that the mobo wires in the green terminals aren't tinned.

**Printed parts**

some sort of filament guide. pretty much essential. I use the first one but i'm gonna get the second going today. if you have a 608 bearing laying around it's way better. they're cheap on aliexpress and really useful, so it might be worth buying 10 for a few bucks anyways. the filament enters at a really steep angle, which makes it harder for the extruder to work and grinds away at the plastic arm, which leads to contaminants and tons of wear.

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3052488

anti vibration feet are pretty important for stopping issues like ringing. I'm gonna figure out making feet from some spare foam, but I use these right now and they definitely help. 

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2913473

some kind of anti snag. cable chain is better, but uses more materials.

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2940855 (if you use the anti vibration feet, you'll need a longer one. I whipped one up in tinkercad, if you ever need that just hit me up)


https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2920060

this knob. holy crap, it made such a huge difference. there's plenty of times where you have to spin the knob like 10 times around, which is horrible with the stock knob. one of the first things I printed and my absolute favorite mod. 

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3090591

this is the level test I use, works nicely. I adjust the knobs as it takes two or 3 loops around then check my results with the circles. comes with an stl and a  .gcode, don't bother slicing the stl, just use the gcode file cuz it's set up for your printer already

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2987803

you should seriously buy the metal extruder, like day one, but until then, printing at least the 0.5mm version of this will help the shitty plastic extruder actually get a grip 

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3066664

the mobo fan is in a horrible location and will get plastic in it unless you print a cover like this. you can find psu fan covers on thingiverse too, they'll help quiet the fan. just search there.

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2935204

exposed pcbs are bad, you should probably print this cover. looks really nice too. there's versions that cover the buzzer if the sound is too loud for you

**Parts to Buy**

 yellow bed springs and a metal extruder are just imo essential. the stock springs are so weak and the bed loosens so quickly, and the plastic extruder will crack on you, it's only a matter of when. the springs are actually 25mm, my bad. get 10, they'll come in handy for a lot more stuff.

the stock bowden couplers on the printer are total shit, but I couldn't tell you off the top of my head which connectors to buy instead. I'm sure you can figure it out googling tho. you should get steel ones, not brass. at some point you'll want to get a new ptfe tube too, just google for the right diameter and buy one off aliexpress. either buy a cutter for ptfe or print this one, do not freehand it  https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3427170

I bought some spare wheels and nozzles, just because they're a consumable and I don't wanna have to wait a month for shipping if mine break.

https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32868193117.html?spm=a2g0o.detail.1000014.9.28523f4biDZ73Z&gps-id=pcDetailBottomMoreOtherSeller&scm=1007.13338.142407.0&scm_id=1007.13338.142407.0&scm-url=1007.13338.142407.0&pvid=38942e5d-1273-4103-ba54-691a53e6f858

for nozzles, 0.4 is stock size, smaller ones print slower but more detailed. i'd say get a 0.2 and a 0.6 to play around with, and another 0.4 or two. they won't wear very quickly, but sometimes it's easier to replace one than clear a really nasty clog, and if you're printing anything with additives like carbon fibre plastic or glow in the dark or metal filled plastic, you'll wear thru brass nozzles stupid fast. you need to make sure the nozzles say mk8, do not buy volcano or v6 nozzles, they won't fit. 

then non printer parts to keep around. buy some 608 bearings, there's so many things that use them, they're super standardized, and dirt cheap. if you get ones with a plastic shield, just remove it with a screwdriver or something, most come shielded but for our applications low resistance is important, not resistance to water and contaminants. 

i'd also hop on amazon or something and get a kit of m3 and m4 screws, washers, and nuts in various lengths. you'll need them for printer upgrades and potentially printed stuff. I consider m3 and m4 screws a must, but they might not be for your stuff. if you do get them, spend a couple bucks for some of these too, so you can screw strongly into your prints. one of those things that's really good to keep around for the day you do need them so you don't have to wait months for china shipping. https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33003887129.html


you should also think about getting some silica gel packets. even pla plastic absorbs water over time, albeit way slower than abs or other stuff, and you should store it in a cardboard box with some silica gel if you're not using it.

but whatever, here, have an article. 

https://www.ewg.org/research/canaries-kitchen/teflon-offgas-studies

>The lowest temperature at which nonstick coatings have been reported to kill birds in a peer-reviewed study is 396°F (202°C) [3]

>In a 1975 study by Waritz, Teflon breakdown products generated at lower temperatures were determined to cause death. Within four hours of exposure to a Teflon-coated pan heated to 536°F (280°C) parakeets died

and here's why the theoretical numbers for ptfe aren't accurate 

>These reports and personal accounts indicate that Teflon offgases toxic substances at temperatures as low as 396°F and 325°F. In 1991, a report by a collaborative team of DuPont and Louisiana State University scientists also addressed this issue. These scientists generated low molecular weight PTFE by heating Teflon to high temperatures and allowing the fumes to age for a few minutes; aging allowed the chemicals in the fumes to react to form small Teflon molecules. The scientists found that when this low molecular weight PTFE was reheated to 464°F two out of three exposed rats died. Evidence indicated that particulate matter was responsible for the rats’ death, and this particulate matter was composed of small molecules of Teflon [5].

>Seidel and coworkers explain that “fumes generated at temperatures below 572°F (300°C) are formed exclusively by sublimation of a low MW (molecular weight) fraction already present in the polymer”[5]. From the Seidel study we can conclude that at low temperatures PTFE offgases particulate matter which is composed of small molecules of PTFE. We can also conclude that this particulate matter, which has been reported to cause bird deaths at temperatures below 500°F (260°C), is the result of the presence of low molecular weight PTFE.

>This low molecular weight PTFE may be present in Teflon at the time of Teflon’s manufacture, or the PTFE may be created when a pan is heated repeatedly and the coating degrades as PTFE bonds break.

there's absolutely no reason to take the risk for a couple bucks extra for an all metal setup. don't be dumb.

>Processing PTFE can be difficult and expensive, because the high melting temperature, 327 °C (621 °F), is above the initial decomposition temperature, 200 °C (392 °F).[28]"

ender3,ff21o2k,t1_ff21ek5,1579491399.0,That's normal. It has to print in discrete layers which means this happens. You can play around with a setting called ironing in your slicer and make your layer height smaller but it'll always be there to some degree.
ender3,ff21boj,t1_ff1zsdz,1579491142.0,"they probably mean infill, which does reduce pancaking. are you talking about the layer lines on the top or what? can you show what the print is supposed to look like? pancaking is when sections kinda collapse because there isn't enough support below them from the infill."

ender3,fev8tz3,t1_fev714e,1579394476.0,"No matter what, this damage is only able to be caused by arcing. Arcing only happens when there's a gap between the terminal and the wire. If it was an electrical fault error sure, check everything, but this literally cannot be anything else and there's no way it could fry the board since it didn't arc anywhere but between the terminal and the wire. If it wasn't a well known and easily diagnosable problem with 0 risk once it's fixed, go ham. But don't mistake caution for paranoia.

There's no reason not to check everything else, but saying there's other causes for this or to buy a new board is just untrue."
