I'm not a Gilet Jaune. /u/Daedriis evokes a ""they"" which I believe represents the opinion of roughly 1% of the protesters. A far stretch of ""not all"" of them. Yet all I'm saying, without disrespect to the victims of any attack, is that Macron's government is being very inconvenienced by the GJ movement and anything ""bigger"" making the news does so in their favor. I'm not sure that a popular movement should be ashamed of suspecting being lied to and the opinion being manipulated. Rest assured that any terrorist attacks impact much more directly and harshly people from the GJ than any officials."

Perhaps focusing on this would help you put ""ugliness"" on the backburner - there are more people than you think who will be taken away by a radiant personality even if the person's looks may seem outside the standards of beauty.

I can deal with the harsher reality, what's tough for me is the boredom. /r/quitdrinking helps a lot also.
