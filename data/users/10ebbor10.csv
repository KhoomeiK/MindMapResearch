Taken from Wikipedia :

>Sexologist John Money introduced the terminological distinction between biological sex and gender as a role in 1955. Before his work, it was uncommon to use the word gender to refer to anything but grammatical categories.[1][2] However, Money's meaning of the word did not become widespread until the 1970s, when feminist theory embraced the concept of a distinction between biological sex and the social construct of gender. Today, the distinction is followed in some contexts, especially the social sciences[5][6] and documents written by the World Health Organization (WHO).[3]

This shows us that the definition of gender in it's current context is neither especially new, nor rare. It is the official term as used by the WHO.

On that note, what do you think you're accomplishing with insisting on utilizing your definition of the word?

>When I disagree with those that claim that ""gender is a spectrum"" I am disagreeing with their redefining of the word. So, what is gender then, according to me? Basically gender is sex. They are interchangeable terms.

By doing this, you haven't actually proven or argued that gender is not a spectrum. All you've done is shown that you utilize a different definition of the word gender."

You're confusing a few elements. 

>The primary risks of pubertal suppression in GD/gender-incongruent adolescents may include adverse effects on bone mineralization (which can theoretically be reversed with sex hormone treatment), compromised fertility if the person subsequently is treated with sex hormones, and unknown effects on brain development. 

The compromised fertility happens when you continue with cross sex hormones (which, you know, is kinda obvious). 

The bone density loss is a risk, but there seems to be some evidence that that resolves itself over time.

>There was incomplete catch-up at age 22 years after sex hormone treatment from age 16.6 (±1.4) years for a median duration of 5.8 years (3.0 to 8.0 years) in transgender females and from age 16.4 (±2.3) years for 5.4 years (2.8 to 7.8 years) in transgender males. Little is known about more prolonged use of GnRH analogs. Researchers reported normal BMD z scores at age 35 years in one individual who used GnRH analogs from age 13.7 years until age 18.6 years before initiating sex hormone treatment.

There is more evidence from other usecases of puberty blockers.

>Additional data are available from individuals with late puberty or GnRH analog treatment of other indications. Some studies reported that men with constitutionally delayed puberty have decreased BMD in adulthood (95). However, other studies reported that these men have normal BMD (96, 97). Treating adults with GnRH analogs results in a decrease of BMD (98). In children with central precocious puberty, treatment with GnRH analogs has been found to result in a decrease of BMD during treatment by some (99) but not others (100). Studies have reported normal BMD after discontinuing therapy (69, 72, 73, 101, 102). In adolescents treated with growth hormone who are small for gestational age and have normal pubertal timing, 2-year GnRH analog treatments did not adversely affect BMD (103).

All in all, a risk factor that warrants monitoring, but not the end of the world.

And we are criminals in that war. We’ve committed more war crimes almost than any nation in the world, and I'm going to continue to say it. And we won't stop it because of our pride and our arrogance as a nation.

And if you don't stop your reckless course, I'll rise up and break the backbone of your power."" (Yes) And that can happen to America.

>But let me rush on to my conclusion, because I want you to see what Jesus was really saying. What was the answer that Jesus gave these men? It's very interesting. One would have thought that Jesus would have condemned them. One would have thought that Jesus would have said, ""You are out of your place. You are selfish. Why would you raise such a question?""

>But that isn't what Jesus did; he did something altogether different. He said in substance, ""Oh, I see, you want to be first. You want to be great. You want to be important. You want to be significant. Well, you ought to be. If you're going to be my disciple, you must be."" But he reordered priorities. And he said, ""Yes, don't give up this instinct. It's a good instinct if you use it right. (Yes) It's a good instinct if you don't distort it and pervert it. Don't give it up. Keep feeling the need for being important. Keep feeling the need for being first. But I want you to be first in love. (Amen) I want you to be first in moral excellence. I want you to be first in generosity. That is what I want you to do.""

>And he transformed the situation by giving a new definition of greatness. And you know how he said it? He said, ""Now brethren, I can't give you greatness. And really, I can't make you first."" This is what Jesus said to James and John. ""You must earn it. True greatness comes not by favoritism, but by fitness. And the right hand and the left are not mine to give, they belong to those who are prepared."" (Amen)

>And so Jesus gave us a new norm of greatness. If you want to be important—wonderful. If you want to be recognized—wonderful. If you want to be great—wonderful. But recognize that he who is greatest among you shall be your servant. (Amen) That's a new definition of greatness.

>And this morning, the thing that I like about it: by giving that definition of greatness, it means that everybody can be great, (Everybody) because everybody can serve. (Amen) You don't have to have a college degree to serve. (All right) You don't have to make your subject and your verb agree to serve. You don't have to know about Plato and Aristotle to serve. You don't have to know Einstein's theory of relativity to serve. You don't have to know the second theory of thermodynamics in physics to serve.

While I agree on most of the other points, I have an alternative perspective on this one. It seems to me that their intention could be to take the same basic character idea (breaking gender norms, figuring out identity, and how society reacts to that) and updating it to modern issues. 

After all, to modern audiences a female dwarf is not exactly that breaking with gender norms. Non-binary people in general are.

They provide no evidence of anyone jumping on board beyond the insistence that it happened.
It's a magazine which is strongly against feminism, as well as the usual Koch brother things (aka, against environmentalism, skeptical of global warming, and so on).

Both you and I know that you didn't believe that, and weren't really interested in that question.

FragileWhiteRedditor,femy2pb,t1_femwjpf,1579272571.0,">But its not a misrepresentation, its a direct quote and an actual representation of the behavior here.

Your ""direct quote"" engages in 2 fallacies.

The first is the fallacy of [affirming the consequent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirming_the_consequent).
Basically, you make the fallacious assumption that because the excerpt ascribes a range of behaviours to a certain group, that that must mean that everyone that shows those behaviours is part of that group. This nonsense.

All horses may have 4 legs, but my table with 4 legs is not a horse.

The second fallacy is that you're basically engaging in a strawman, pitting a single sentence and ignore the context of the surrounding excerpt and in fact the entire article so that you can pretend that the excerpt condems any kind of disagreement, or non-disagreement. 

You're arguing against an interpretation that you yourself invented.

The Federal Funds rate is not the sole factor that determines at what rate people and corporations borrow money.  It's also determined by likelyhood of repayment and stuff like that, which is why interest rates increase during a recession.

Normally, the government can lower the Fed Interest Rate to counteract the fears of the Depression, but Trump has pressured to keep the interest rate low, so that lever is exhausted.

By using the tool now, it can not be used to counter the recession.
