For dating I made it my goal to spend time with 1 new person, 1 person I met within the semester, and 1 long time friend every week. Usually coffee, studying, lunch, or weed if they were into it. This lead to me growing a really large social circle of great friends, as a good portion of the interactions I had with these people brought value to their lives in some way. This leads to you getting access to way more girls that are probably a good fit for you via friends of friends, but honestly that's only an auxiliary benefit; life is really fun when you got people to share it with!

I've always found that I get super awesome conversations with other people when we talk about some show / book / movie / album and we know them super in depth, so a good bit of my commute is going to be pulling out my Kindle and reading, or opening Spotify and listening to some album, while taking notes on what I found impactful / noticed / enjoyed so that I can Anki them later to remember.
