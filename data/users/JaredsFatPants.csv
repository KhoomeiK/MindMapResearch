As much as I like Tulsi I would immediately stop supporting her if this ends up being a lie. She doesn’t strike me as the kind of person to deceive Americans for her own personal gain. She stood up for what she believed (I’m referring to backing Sanders in 2016) knowing full well that it would have extremely negative consequences to her standing in the Democratic Party and her future electability. No banks are going to be giving her $400K to talk for an hour. She did that because she thought it was the right thing for the American people regardless of how it would negatively affect her.

They should be talking about issues instead of blaming everyone else for their faults. They shouldn’t be casually smearing people they don’t like as Russians.

I asked if I could have a canned soda. They said no, which I get. So I just said ok well can I get a free drink next time I come in? They said no, only on thursday. I was seriously flabbergasted. Really? You can’t give me a free soda, that I’m entitled to, on a different day to make up for it? Then they said they don’t have anyway to do that. They could have just wrote “free soda” on a piece of paper and had the manager sign it. I was a little peeved at this point because it was so ridiculous. I said “so there’s no way I can get a free soda even though your huge sign right here says I get a free soda if I make a purchase on Thursday”? And their answer was “You can come back next Thursday and by something else.”  It’s a fountain soda. It probably cost them $.10.

Let’s also assume Liz was being truthful when she said that she and Bernie are good friends.     
    
Then, it’s likely that if Warren heard Bernie say he didn’t think a woman can win (maybe not in those exact words, but that’s how Warren took it) you would expect her to be shocked(!) that Bernie would say such a thing. So did she then just leave it at that and go off thinking Bernie is a dick? Or more likely, she would have immediately asked him for clarification...    
    
So then Bernie either verified that is indeed indeed think a woman can’t win (unlikely), or they discussed it until it she understood what he meant and was satisfied.   
    
So either Bernie is lying now and was (and is) a dick, or Liz is lying and is purposefully misrepresenting Bernie and saved this private meeting in her back pocket to be used now for political gain.  Both of these seem preposterous to me."

If it looks correct (I’m not sure what the specs are, maybe it should be 5v, just a guess) then the motor is probably dead.

If it is then (while the platter is still removed) turn it on and check that the motor is spinning. If it’s not then you are going to need some tech knowledge to diagnose why.
