Coronavirus,fgnfbk6,t1_fgnehhk,1580943649.0,Thank you for clearing this up for me.
Coronavirus,fgndvz0,t1_fgncz8z,1580942790.0,"It’s pretty obvious all over the place. Maybe not making out to be worse, but more so lack of clarification. All I see said is that people are dying, and many more diagnosed, but not the ages/state of people diagnosed. Also, correct me if I’m wrong but, this new virus does not affect you nearly as much as people say (depending on your health of course). Perhaps I’m not paying enough attention, but that’s how I am seeing it at the moment."
Coronavirus,fgndcyo,t1_fgncy17,1580942475.0,Mmm beans

kingdomcome,ffocd1d,t1_ffm9uui,1580076203.0,It’s not incredibly hard to get your lockpicking level up. I also use the drunk luck (I think that’s what it’s called) perk. Makes a very hard lock into a very easy one
kingdomcome,fflwupz,t3_eu04gv,1580045109.0,I just lockpick the Rattay armourers chests and then sell it all back to him. Easy 30k.

AskReddit,fel5q8d,t3_epj100,1579214632.0,"Kingdom Come Deliverance didn’t seem to get *too* much attention at launch. It’s an rpg game set in the 14th century with a great story line. A great game never mind, I’d say it’s worth the buy since the price is going down quite a bit."
aww,fel53h1,t3_epli8t,1579214245.0,I love how it was immediately happy

granturismo,fdnhcbi,t1_fdm2qrp,1578585819.0,"[Firstly because it sounds awesome](https://youtu.be/yqRzbj5hNWY) and there needs to be more spice in gr.3. Not just gr.3, there needs to be more spice in a lot of categories. I’m not saying this is the only car that should be added, there are plenty more cool cars to be added (Espace F1 minivan please)"
