AskReddit,fgbcnao,t1_fg7j1iq,1580660681.0,"Yes! I had an appointment the other day with someone who was going to help me find a job. I have difficulties finding them because I am a minor and deaf on my left ear, so I can't just take any job. Anyways, I am also autistic but I wouldn't say it affects my life THAT much and it has nothing to do with me not getting a job. I told her this first thing. The rest of the hour she then tries to convince into starting in different classes for autistic people with low scores even though she could cleary see that I got above average scores in my old school. It was so frustrating that she couldn't see beyond my autism and just try and help me."
