TooAfraidToAsk,ffy85b9,t3_evlsbg,1580340428.0,"Since about 2000 or so everywhere I've worked there were people who took naps in their cars.

Oddly enough, prior to that I never saw anyone do it."

Note that the cost of an ATM transaction on a machine with moderately heavy use, including amortization and maintenance for the machine itself, is on the order of $0.25 per transaction.

Mind you, the machines are expensive: a cash dispenser is a costly piece of gear.  But a moderately busy machine does 3,000 transactions per month."
boomershumor,ffwrc82,t3_evd8f0,1580309141.0,"Odd thing about ""free speech"" in the US: if one lies to someone in a way that leads to them harming themselves, the courts don't regard that sort of speech as protected.  For example, theft by deception, and the classic ""yelling 'FIRE!' in a crowded theatre"" are not examples of free speech.

Now... I wonder if all the people who told teenagers with little or no experience of adult life, ""Borrow this money!  You'll get a good job.  You'll be able to pay it back in no time,"" will be prosecuted."
AskReddit,ffwpja6,t1_ffvfcxp,1580307849.0,They're studied by set theorists.
SandersForPresident,ffvqbii,t3_ev8c2q,1580270311.0,"Something people seem to be losing track of here:  Sanders' and Cortez's positions wouldn't be seen as the least bit outre in most civilized countries (mostly in Europe, note) and wouldn't surprise or much disturb anyone.

Perhaps their supporters take that for granted, but it doesn't occur to a good many others who might do well to be reminded."

Of all the people running pharma companies, he's probably the least evil.  If they're going to go after him, go after them all."
suspiciouslyspecific,ffruzl5,t3_eum47o,1580166436.0,Yes.  What of it?
suicidebywords,ffrtdma,t3_eurnel,1580165403.0,"Really?  The First Second Bush Recession was just winding down in 2004, leaving the US economy considerably weakened.  In 2004 the Great US Treasury Swindle, also known as the Second War Against Iraq, was getting into full swing.  In 2004 people re-elected George W. Bush, largely on the principle of ""He made this mess, let *him* clean it up.""  (Hint: He didn't clean it up.)

F**k 2004."
TrumpCriticizesTrump,ffrsuc6,t3_eunh4l,1580165058.0,"Wait... what?  They did ask him to testify.

I've met sociopaths who will look you right in the eye and tell you a lie that they know you know is a lie, but this is a whole new level of mendacity.

The Guinness book will have a field day with this guy."
