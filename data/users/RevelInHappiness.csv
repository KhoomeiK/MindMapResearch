AskReddit,feu6j68,t1_feu3ozj,1579383595.0,It's such a beautiful day has a bit of the same feel for me too. One of my favourite movies ever.
AskReddit,feu1l37,t1_fett8zz,1579382177.0,I can imagine. It's a crazy ride and I feel it's a very personal film. Can't put into words why I enjoyed it.

Audiomemes,feq6tgy,t1_feprlsx,1579338344.0,If it works anything like the Reaper tracks it is really helpful. It keeps your session waaay more organized.
protools,feq636n,t1_feh6ofv,1579338105.0,Honestly I feel the people up top just don't give a shit. Maybe they are starting to care when people start switching over.
protools,feq5qt9,t1_feflsqm,1579338031.0,"This. Seriously, fuck Pro Tools. I'm simply stuck with it due to the ""industry standard"" bullshit. I'd fulltime switch to reaper in a second. In a few years we probably can, seeing the functionality of reaper improve by the day.

PT is expensive and is lacking basic functions like track folders to organize."
wholesomememes,fej3h81,t1_fei5lty,1579155488.0,You are saying not a single person ever buys coins. Then why does reddit monetize it?
wholesomememes,fehr5uk,t3_ep706h,1579122235.0,"How much does an award cost? If they're making money of off this, it's kind of bad practice if you ask me.

Soo an award costs 1000 coins. there is an offer on now which gives you 1100 coins for 3,99 (10% bonus, so that would be 1000 coins for 3,99 normally). Reddit is making 1,50 dollars per award. So yeah, bad taste."
GameAudio,fehqq8u,t3_ep7uas,1579121986.0,"Reaper is well known and widely used in game audio. Though not free it is 60 euro/dollars and has unlimited trial mode with full functionality. So use it and if you like it buy. Honestly the most amazing piece of audio software I've used. Has a bit of a learning curve, though when knowing your way around it, it's truly the most powerful."
oddlysatisfying,fehonvt,t1_feho34h,1579120795.0,"I get that's how it works. I don't agree with a huge pay gap. I get being skilled and being trained should give more money. Though a pay gap of a waterboy vs a multimilliondollar footballer is a bit much. 

&#x200B;

And my main point was that you make a film together and that a huge pay gap between an actor and a behind the scenes can be a bit much. Though the point made by /u/averagejoejesse is a fair one."
oddlysatisfying,fehlbu3,t1_fehkfhh,1579118869.0,"Well you're not wrong, I just don't agree with that way of dividing pay. If it's fair to pay everyone equal is a whole other discussion."
oddlysatisfying,fehk2gb,t1_fehj57s,1579118145.0,"Well the cam op also makes the film, as does the editor, director, sound designer, mixer and so on. To place one above the other makes for some shady film making practices"

Well shit. Okay man, hear me out. Check out Alon Mor, I think he's gonna fit up your ally. Easily my favourite artist ever.

socialanxiety,fdn781w,t1_fdmu4b6,1578579184.0,I think it is a victory. I sometimes even ask for directions when I full well know where I am. This works for me because I say to myself I'll never meet these people again. It's a weird trick but it works.

socialanxiety,fdmrux5,t1_fdmek6f,1578562684.0,"I think that really depends on the person, but generally I agree. Putting yourself in situations which make you a bit uncomfortable is good. Trial and error. Begin small though, no speeches in front of a thousand people for some time :)"
socialanxiety,fdmrn14,t1_fdm2qyh,1578562377.0,Well there is a truth in there I think. The way it's handled could be better. School awareness of SA would be a big step. Social training in a safe environment for those who want/need it. We live in a social world and it's good schools recognize and try to teach it. The way it is taught should change.
BeAmazed,fdljfzz,t1_fdl9qje,1578525361.0,But doesn't the chernobyl footage look like that because of the actual film that was getting destroyed? Rosetta probably has a digital camera right?

worldnews,fd5f1cm,t1_fd3rbhl,1578176983.0,Could you provide some evidence?
Reaper,fcxd386,t1_fcxchoz,1578059667.0,"I've got the mini, but the setup is probably the same. In prefs you have to enable ""input"" and ""control"" of the launchpad under midi devices.

Then through action lists, find the shortcut you want to add to the controller. In the left bottom box you can add or delete shortcuts. Hit a key on the launchpad and it'll learn that shortcut. Don't mind the absolute, relative or takeover setting, that's just for knobs. 

&#x200B;

Reaper can also string several commands together. So for example you could have it maximise a track, then solo that track and then minimise all other tracks. Takes some time to figure out what the possibilities are but definitely worth it!

Have fun"

I've mapped all of my screen layouts, window layouts, track heights, track visibility in both mixer and arrangement. And many other things like that. Honestly it saves a lot of time. Though it isn't what you may be looking for."
Reaper,fcx2z8d,t1_fcwvpvq,1578048945.0,"Yes. This. I use rubber band a lot. Tends to keep the character off the sound quite intact.

You can also change the algorithm per item in item settings."
Reaper,fcx2wv7,t1_fcx07ez,1578048859.0,"Well it can stretch ridiculous amount but it definitely changes the character of the sound a lot. Reaper has an algorithm called something like rubber band, which is used for ""extreme stretching"". Not as extreme as Paulstretch though."
AskReddit,fcu2wba,t1_fcttue2,1577970885.0,"Deja vu is basically a little error in the brain. The longer the deja vu the bigger the error.

Reaper,fclmjuc,t3_ehtooy,1577751301.0,I think /r/edmproduction would suit your question better.
