RocketLeague,ff2qqbu,t1_ff1gmkz,1579519764.0,"Also a common thought now that fast = better. Getting TO the ball is important. Once you create that gap, then take your time. Even watch rl pros. They will boost full tilt for a ball going up the wall but they almost stop and reset speed before contact. It's just done so smoothly it's hard to see. If not they'd be chasing balls at supersonic all the time and wouldn't be able to physically catch up."
RocketLeague,ff2qnoy,t1_ff19i56,1579519658.0,"Take him into a private match and show him the difference between a shot off your bumper and shots off other areas of the car so he really understands the boost of power you get from simply aiming your bumper.
