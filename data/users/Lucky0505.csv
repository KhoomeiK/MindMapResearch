https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320233.php

I only make food with ingredients my great grandmother would recognize. 

I track water intake and macros with my fitbit. 

I eat low carb on a 16/8 intermittent fasting cycle. Meaning I eat 3 meals within 8 hours and don't eat for 16 hours. Usually I skip breakfast and eat from 11 till 19.

The pills all costs a bunch so I started making my own herbal pills. This reduced my costs by a factor of 6. Just buy a capsule machine and look for herbal wholesellers in your state. Also try to buy the normal herbs from restaurant suppliers because some herbs are sold at 100 times their value at the supermarket(I'm dutch, no clue what US herbs cost). 

If I were to pick a few as must haves I'd pick Water, salt, garlic, ginger, NAC, Probiotics, cats claw, vit d and magnesium.

Also remember that these are herbs, not pharmaceuticals. So they might knock off a small bit of discomfort. But stack them and and those numbers add up.

AskEurope,ffg5lwf,t3_et8be6,1579898954.0,"The year is 2050 as we look upon what's left of the former European countries. After yet another 30 years of failing to meet the Paris climate goals the temperature has risen by 3 degrees and turned most of the middle and eastern European countries to deserts with frequent lethal heatwaves. 

The seas have risen by 4 meters and reclaimed most of the coastal cities and destroyed all potable watersources near the coast. 

The remaining habitable land and potable water is closely guarded by the megacity states that dott the northern and western sides of Europe. 

But both lands and wells are heavily stressed by the great migrations of '32 and '33. This South to North dyaspora led to widespread civil unrest and raging pandemics that killed allmost a billion people. 

The northern Scandinavian countries have entered into a strategic alliance with Russia to protect their hospitable climate and many watersources.

To protect the Baikal and the 30.000 fresh water lakes of Scandinavia the northern union laid down a radiation border with strategic dirty bombings. And many southern nuclear states are allowed to enter the allegiance in exchange for their arsenal and nuclear waste. 

Life beyond the radiation is centered around mega cities that  are fully self sufficient. Most cities are run by the billionaire class that bought their way into power during the great migrations. The most powerful of which is Nestlé. 

The Nest was the first of the corporate city states that popped up as the continuous attacks on their strategic waterwealth forced them to buy the US army in order to protect their interests and water fields.

Most city states adhere by the peace ever since the Zion Iranian city wars destroyed each other in a full on nuclear death match.

What life is left beyond the radiation is unknown to most people because of the great firewall that the Amazonians enforce to obfuscate the existence of the remaining hospitable lands. 

After a decade of shooting down the recon planes of the south they have given up and accepted the new world order of the middle earth wastelands. 

The UK, having seen this coming ages ago, had no desire to join forces with the northern union as it had all the proper precautions in place by the time brexit was completed in '25. It's happy instead to just eat it's turle 'n chips and just be an island. It does however send a postcard at Christmas saying: told you so."

They used the same lume on the Falcon as on the Neptune. You'll notice your lume daily when walking from one part of your house to another.

The crystal is flatter than the neptune so it distorts light in a different way. This gives it higher legibility but it takes away some of the ""jewel"" light play that the neptune has. Luckily the guilloche/waffle dial picks up the slack by flashing reflections and colourshifting when moving it around.

The cases are the same, ie, brushed surfaces and mirror pollish bevelling that shines with the brightness of a supernova when you're in the sun. 

The neptune will often refuse to slide underneath a sleeve or cuff whereas the Falcon uses its diagonal bezel to slide underneath with ease. So all in all a dressier watch.

Batteries, and the circulair waste managent will become better as the heavy metals become commodities. We already have the means to safely and environmentally recycle heavy metals to reuse in voltaic and battery. And IBM is currently developing a salt based battery with greater potential than HM.
Heck, you can use left over energy during peak sunlight to pump water into an estuary to drive turbines for later demand. 

So there's plenty of solutions that result in circulair ""waste"" commodities. But with nuclear that's not an option. Nuclear waste is forever. 

I've been inside the nuclear waste management facilities of my country several times and the amount of time, effort and money it costs to guard this waste from disaster, war and terrorists is insane. And the guarding of this crap is 24/7 for the next 10.000 years.

Now, normal risk evaluations rely on the formula that risk=chance x effect x exposure. 

And as soon as you enter 10.000 years as exposure into this formula all the bells start ringing. So with nuclear you sorta ignore this and just focus on the chance*effect bit. But there is an ethical rule in risk management where you have to put extreme effects above a low chance resulting in ""low risk"". This is called the Cygnus attratus: ""A once in a lifetime incident culminating in unimaginable damages and health consequences for 10.000 years."" ie, the perfect shit storm. 

But the Nuclear sector hasn't had a ""once in a lifetime"" disaster has it? There have been several the past 50 years that forced over a million people from their land and made it unfit for humans for the next 10.000 years. The latest of which is the Fukushima site which resulted in 160.000 people moving away and nuclear drift out on US shores.

unpopularopinion,feml8ry,t1_felupxl,1579261099.0,"the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant and the V.C. Summer Nuclear Station received approval in 2012 (that's spades in the ground) and are both over budget and far from completing construction.

In the time it took to partially build these reactors, that are a decade away from being finished, the US built 57 solar farms totalling 5700MW.

They are producing twice as much power. They took less time to build and they are cheaper. As a matter of fact, they are generating revenue.

For instance, the 2.430MW Vogtle units 3&4 started construction in 2012. The reactor will cost 25 Billion and is estimated to be finished around 2030.

Meanwhile, the 250 MW Phoebe Solar Project in Texas, is scheduled to cost 397 million dollars and takes less than one year to bring online.

So if you look at the ratios of money VS output you will see that the solar plant is better by a factor of 6.3. And that's before you take into effect that the solar plant will be making money 16 years before the Voglte 3&4 comes online. 

And even if the state repealed the regulations to mimmick the hayday of nuclear power you still lose out because the fastest a nuclear plant has been built is 4 years against 500MW.

So to conclude: if you are a capitalist that likes a short ROI, you will go solar. If however you like slow, state funded projects that use outdated technology, you go nuclear my comrade."

unpopularopinion,fekz4l9,t3_epjsdh,1579210614.0,"The biggest nuclear powerplant in the US is the Palo Verde with a capacity of 3900MW. Building it in the 70s took 10 years. 

In the past 2 years the Netherlands (17million citizens) increased it's solar power capacity with 2200MW. 

The smallest nuclear powerplant in the US is the Ginna @ 500MW. Building it in the 80s took 4 years.

It took us just 2 years to build a 600MW windmill park at sea. Our next 1400 MW build will take 3 years. 

But..but... Why don't you give recent examples for nuclear in the US? Because there are non. They are all delayed, over budget and non functional. The last reactor the US built took 33 years to complete, but they have a couple of 7 year old builds that are a decade away from being finished...

And while they were trying to build those new nuclear reactors the US actually opened 5700MW worth of solar farms.

So to say that nuclear is the way to go is just an outdated concept based on old knowhow."
