Brooklyn,fdwiqc4,t1_fdwidnv,1578759057.0,They would know you don’t have a driver’s license. It’s not a matter of when your exam is. You can’t drive in testing areas with a permit.
Brooklyn,fdw7vh2,t1_fdryq73,1578755969.0,That doesn’t negate what I said. What are you going to do if you get pulled over?
worldnews,fdqubcm,t1_fdqqmpu,1578675013.0,"No, no. We were fully expecting that."
Brooklyn,fdol8re,t3_emdta0,1578607412.0,"I’m a very anxious person, and the person I got was very short with me, which made me even more nervous. I failed. That area is known for mean instructors. Just get plenty of practice, do your best to remain calm, and be attentive. Good luck!"
Brooklyn,fdol0j4,t1_fdoi4vs,1578607276.0,You’re actually not allowed to drive in testing areas before you take the test.
AskReddit,fd2n7mz,t1_fd0hqth,1578149625.0,Cough in his face to assert dominance
AskReddit,fd2mshm,t1_fd1qolv,1578149450.0,I’ve been having gastro-intestinal issues for the past year and it amuses me to write “upset stomach” and when I’m feeling particularly snarky “diarrhea” on the (what I like to call the Explain Yourself!) absence slip when I return to work from a sick day.
AskReddit,fd2mepo,t1_fd1q3bt,1578149293.0,"I hate how much guilt there is around taking a personal day. Honestly, I couldn’t care less what you think of me. I have sick days, and if I’m feeling burned out, or physically exhausted, I’m using them."
tippytaps,fd2cz61,t1_fd04t6c,1578145428.0,"What- um... what was he TRYING to do?? The poor thing is huddled in a corner in his hammock and lunges at him in warning several times! 

Thanks for delivering! I enjoyed the instant karma."
stopdrinking,fczw5ig,t3_ejirri,1578109638.0,I got this same question due to the weight I gained from drinking
tippytaps,fczvwij,t1_fczqehh,1578109513.0,I’m morbidly curious to see this. Do you happen to have a link?
tippytaps,fczvu6i,t1_fcztsw3,1578109480.0,"Well to be honest, the same way I overcame my fear of needles: forced exposure. Also a lot of tequila and I was able to handle a tarantula on two occasions. They’re fuzzy and quite calm.  I think I would still scream bloody murder and run for my life if I startled a wolf spider, but that’s only cause they move so fast. Like, for example, I’m not actually scared that a roach would hurt me but the speed with which they move creeps me out. Still doesn’t stop me from killing em. I used to scream and run out of the room if I saw a spider. I’m calmer now, but I wouldn’t want to live in Australia."
tippytaps,fczrhnp,t1_fcziql6,1578107376.0,"That was a nice, descriptive video. As a former arachnophobe, I appreciated the thorough, non-alarming description - particularly of the defensive behaviors"
stopdrinking,fcv0d9p,t1_fcuzl9m,1577992084.0,"Hey, any day you make it is a victory. Recovery isn’t linear. If you slip up, just get back up and try again. Feeling shame / guilt is counter productive. I’m on day yet again, but I won’t let that stop me.
