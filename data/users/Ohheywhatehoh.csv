""Marriage is an equal association. In Islam, no man has superiority over a woman and no woman has superiority over a man except by piety, righteousness and knowledge. Within the Muslim community many misunderstand the relationship between husbands and wives. Since people are taught that women must be obedient unconditionally, they are convinced of its correctness. There is no such thing in Islam. First of all, obedience is only to Allah.""

Just because she called her ""mother"" does NOT make you any less of her mom too. She's probably curious and hurt and God knows what else, I couldn't imagine being given up by my parents, how much that could hurt. 

Because as you said, you fed her, clothed her, housed her, etc. You were and ARE her Mom. And given that, you need to step up now and actually be her mother in this very difficult part of her life.

Because I can buy a massive bag of rice that will last my husband and I 3-4 months (if not LONGER) for about $80, veggies aren't that expensive compared to a case of pop or a bunch of junk food/ canned crap and buy meat and poultry in bulk and freeze it. Everything else you can buy weekly or... gasp, take the time to home-make it. 

The only canned food I really buy is tomato paste, I tried having a chicken noodle soup and the smell is just disgusting I didn't even warm it up. 

Love for yourself and your body isn't just about ignoring your flaws and continuing to feed into your own bad habits, it's about taking care of yourself to feel good, mentally and physically. I actually enjoy this sub to STOP myself from going back to my own bad habits... I'm not massive, but I'm definitely not where I'd like to be yet!!"

AmItheAsshole,fdob63g,t3_em74cu,1578602024.0,"NAH - this is REALLY complicated... I understand you guys made a deal, but sometimes people's feeling change and after being pregnant the first time, she obviously didn't want it to be her last.... it's hard to make this kind of decision. Maybe try for a certain amount of time and if it just isn't possible or taking to long, then adopt? Or have 2 more kids? One adopted and one biological? Good luck :)"

femalefashionadvice,fdnzien,t3_ema4ly,1578596015.0,My problem areas are my arms and tummys... I pretty much live in loose shirts and baggy sweaters. Whats a better alternative to wear that won't highlight my tummy?
pregnant,fdnx4bg,t3_ekvbv2,1578594625.0,"We have an ultrasound at 6+6 weeks (almost 7) and we're not even entirely sure how far along I am... I have super irregular cycles, but I tracked my ovulation so I know when I ovulated, hence... pregnant! But I don't know how to measure that if it goes by last period if I ovulated on CD30? 

Anyways... is 6/7 weeks too early to have an ultrasound? My doctor told me to get bloodwork done and get the ultrasound done before I go see my OBGYN at the end of the month!"

Can you really live like that for the rest of your life? Is he worth all the drama and anxiety? If its yes, then try to work through it to the best you can, but keep in mind people like that will never change and not to get your hopes up if they ever are nice to you."
