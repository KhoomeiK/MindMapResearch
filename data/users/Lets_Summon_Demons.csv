AskReddit,fdg3akf,t1_fdg2lea,1578378412.0,"Honestly man I agree. The party system won’t go anywhere even though it’s so toxic to us. Like a stingray barb to the lungs. If you pull it out, it’s going to be an open wound. I’m politically aware enough to know the party system promotes group think and team playing that is poisonous and divisive to the whole country and therefore unhealthy and unsound as a system. What to replace it with and how to implement it? It’s hard to say. Everything would need to be gradual. Firstly a sweeping realization throughout the whole country of how the party system is one of our worst enemies and allows corruption to build and team up against us. Unfortunately humans in groups do not work so easily. We follow the path of least resistance while only few strange irregular humans will sense the edge of a waterfall and swim upstream the rest won’t budge until trouble is directly on their doorstep. How do you change that? Movements happen all the time but the party system has its seeds planted so deep it seems almost impossible to ever unite the country under these circumstances for a very long time. I’m not much of a visionary. So all I could do is acknowledge something isn’t working without a solution. Essentially as useless as someone cluelessly vouching for their team. Sometimes self awareness is just realizing you’re in danger and not necessarily that you can stop it."

They always put a looney toons type spin on the voices they do but the Japanese actors take it more serious and add proper drama and purpose to scenes that need them. I can’t get into a good show with all their goofy spins they think just must be in the character voice because they grew up watching Elmer Fudd and Bugs Bunny.

AskReddit,fdg1wjd,t3_el79oj,1578376986.0,"A ton of people will die. One side will see a huge economic boost from the war. The losing sides will be economically crippled for the next century and will probably break down into smaller countries and lose the vast majority of its power and with it all of their freedoms and stake in the world as any chance of being equal again. The risk is great for both sides. It wouldn’t be smart for any of the 3 major powers to fight each other right now. The winner gets way too much power and the losers will become a history lesson. Seems very unlikely there will be a new war involving them all. It’s too much of a gamble for all 3 countries. 

I have strong doubts about nuclear warfare now that we have bombs that could literally wipe out the entire country of France with one drop. I would imagine all 3 sides understand the world wide catastrophe that would result in merely dropping 3 or 4 of those in non-secluded areas. Russia could literally turn all of Europe into glass In a matter of hours. The world economy would suffer so greatly it would impact the same countries dropping the bombs. Like stabbing your own self in the kidney. Most likely result is the strongest Air and space technology will win the war.

AskReddit,fd87hf1,t3_ekale9,1578214794.0,"Probably just personality. Everyone likes varying degrees of attention. Introverts can feel overwhelmed and mentally exhausted by receiving too much, so naturally they want less and may not connect well to the notion of wanting so much. Extroverts thrive off attention and feel energized by it. Generally they might be disliked by either an introvert who doesn’t understand them or an extrovert who is jealous of them. 

The root of it going overboard is probably society. Society is pushing strong for entertainment and being loud and bright all the time. Less introspective. Even magazine articles about relationships mention how to fix an introvert partner and make them open up more but rarely do you see articles on how to get your extrovert partner to be quiet and think more on occasion. Extroverts are the loudest and in a world where communication is easier and their voices can be spread easier it seems natural that hyper attention seeking behavior is both rewarded and highly encouraged. It’s our society that is pushing those personality traits into overdrive. Like giving drugs to an addict."

She treated me very kindly. It actually took me a while to even know she was rich. I never cared about that sort of thing and I always try to handle everything. I left her eventually, but it had nothing to do with her personality at all. She even tried to fix it somehow and keep me in her life. I wasn’t just some other item in her life she could buy like she actually cared and tried to keep me around. Separating from that was painful but I had to do it. All in all though, I had no idea until near the end she was so rich. I picked up that she was successful but the family and the magnitude of her success I didn’t realize until later.
