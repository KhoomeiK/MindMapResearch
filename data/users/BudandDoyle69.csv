WTF,ffopqoq,t1_ffnuuek,1580080271.0,"Also retired Army, and you are wrong.  This same exact thing happened to a guy in my Basic Training unit.  He wore dress socks and didn’t say a word during a 15 k March.  You don’t know the story behind this, so you can’t say “his leadership failed him”."
WTF,ffooz87,t1_ffn96vb,1580080085.0,"It’s because he either wore no socks, dress socks, or soaking wet socks.  This isn’t normal at all."
WTF,ffookvc,t3_eu7zuz,1580079975.0,"I have seen this happen in person.  I was in Basic Training, and we were doing our final (and longest) ruck March.  

Some moron decided to wear the Class A Dress Uniform socks (dress socks) so “his feet wouldn’t sweat as much”.  Bad idea.  He bled massive amounts of blood, just like this.  Fuck, I wonder if this is a photo of him actually, because the camo uniform fits the time frame (2007, so ACU pattern).

Paging Private Locke, is this you?"
