QuittingTianeptine,ffhoe4n,t1_ff8j2p7,1579945265.0,"Great answer. I second the kava suggestion. A good and potent micronized powder of a reputable source can help take the edge off quite a bit. DXM has helped me at that dosage, as well. Unfortunately, vomiting gets so intense while withdrawing for me, I'm often unable to utilize any of those methods while in the thick of it."
QuittingTianeptine,ffhnzph,t1_ffd8n3r,1579944651.0,"Yeah, that is definitely the highest reported dosage I've encountered in the four years I've been active in these subs. There is a ceiling to this compound, so they should absolutely taper down. They're pretty much wasting it at the expense of their health."

JustCause,fcqc1u5,t3_eidwve,1577883035.0,Danger Rising is the only one you want. I just wasted 15 bucks in the PS store and wish I had asked this question first. The other two DLC's are literally some of the worst I've ever played. Whatever logic went behind developing them in the first place for this game is beyond me.

Wtf were they thinking when they made the Los Dominos heap of shit? It's just terrible in literally every way. And if we wanted timed racing game play, we'd sure as hell not be playing Just Cause for it. What a waste"
