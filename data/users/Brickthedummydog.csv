You could also try placing an object there in the way like lawn chairs or your garbage/recycle bin. I know calling a tow company probably won't help as the truck would take too long. Maybe call one of those private companies that installs boots on cars in private lots and see if they will be there at the appointed time.

 The catalyst event for me was taking the keys from a drunk driver and getting charged with assault. When I got to court the judge yelled at the police and reprimanded the officers in open court because it's in the police notes that the driver admitted to drinking the better part of the 26er of rum and admitted to driving.
