aww,fcqhat1,t1_fcq3szi,1577885980.0,Only if your pet is really anxious. But otherwise it is a distraction and making the pet focus on you. When they pet focus on you then you can talk to it in a calm voice and pet it. You shouldn't pet it when it is turned away from you and focus on something else.

I'm sure she picked up daddy from you and your husband. But as a aunt I know children often know what feels right and what feels wrong. Calling your husband daddy feels right for her and maybe it makes her feel closer to her sibling. Let her do it and maybe ask if she feels that her step mom are like a mom.
