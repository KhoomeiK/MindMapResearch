datascience,fd48diz,t1_fd1vlzd,1578165325.0,"Yeah most I've seen are more like 20k. Granted I haven't looked carefully at the top programs, and those are surely where the most money is."

Wow, hot take. I learned about the scientific process in middle school, where were you? I thought this was pretty basic stuff."
worldnews,fcy6zba,t1_fcy5sjf,1578075713.0,"Who did? Without looking it up, I want to see if you know what you're talking about."
AmItheAsshole,fcxarmc,t1_fcxa5j0,1578057638.0,Yeah how long does OP think a ceremony usually lasts?
math,fcwm58x,t1_fcwe2zo,1578029510.0,What do you mean?
AmItheAsshole,fcsepi5,t1_fcsa2ni,1577915480.0,"It's funny, my partner and I have discussed countless times what we would do together if either one of us were to inherit or otherwise come by some large sum of money, large enough to retire specifically. How we would retire and travel the world together. The thought never once crossed my mind to call her a leech, but apparently that's just me."
AmItheAsshole,fcsde1y,t1_fcsd6ij,1577914974.0,Another assumption. We don't know how much money it is.
AmItheAsshole,fcsd69u,t1_fcryueg,1577914883.0,"Maybe, but I'm not really here to discuss that. I think there are more important things to think about. Have a good one."
AmItheAsshole,fcsa5th,t1_fcs69ka,1577913652.0,"You and I are both making assumptions about how much money it is. OP says it's enough to support a comfortable lifestyle without working, to me, that means enough invested to live off for the rest of their lives. So no, it won't ""disappear"" into thin air."
AmItheAsshole,fcs9rfk,t1_fcs0yz6,1577913476.0,If you really think the only two options are work 40 hours a week or sit around and do nothing all day then I feel sorry for you.
AmItheAsshole,fcrw4pf,t1_fcrv2on,1577907433.0,"I think the bigger issue is just the way our society values work and productivity over all else. Is there a stronger social pressure for men to work than there is for women? Sure, but the problem is larger than a single subreddit being biased against men."
AmItheAsshole,fcrutbe,t1_fcrrfa2,1577906904.0,"You're not answering my question. If the entitlement is the only thing you have an issue with, why are you all over this thread calling the guy a lazy moocher? Why are you trying to vilify this guy for being lazy?"
AmItheAsshole,fcrub50,t1_fcrtmku,1577906708.0,"It's because our society is obsessed with work. I've been all over this thread hinting at the fact that wanting to retire and travel with your SO is not a bad thing, and people are getting *pissed.*"
AmItheAsshole,fcru1au,t1_fcrrjyr,1577906609.0,"Spend all of it? She says in her post she has enough money to support a comfortable life for the three of them. Man, if I inherited enough money to comfortably support my family we would be retired and traveling the world so fucking fast. I can't imagine how happy she would be. I guess you're right, everyone is different.

Edit: I also want to say this guy stayed with her for 7 years while he thought they were both struggling, calling him a gold digger is unfair and untrue."
AmItheAsshole,fcrr7u3,t1_fcre96s,1577905524.0,I love this breakdown. Very little empathy in this sub.
AmItheAsshole,fcrqqxt,t1_fcro9xm,1577905352.0,"What's wrong with being a kept man? Why would someone with a disability work if they didn't need to? You're not answering my question. Why are you trying to vilify this guy for being lazy? I'm asking in a general sense, because OP has made it clear she wants a boyfriend with a full-time job, regardless of their finances, I'm just wondering why you guys are all so furiously agreeing."
AmItheAsshole,fcrpjme,t1_fcrmhnd,1577904898.0,"She says in her post it's enough money to fund a comfortable life for the three of them. They're a family, if she doesn't actually want to travel like she says she does in her post that's fine, but it doesn't make her any more responsible. She's not an asshole for withholding her money, she can do whatever she wants with it, but at the same time the guy's not an asshole for suggesting they follow their dreams together."
AmItheAsshole,fcrnn40,t1_fcqnaki,1577904182.0,"So now wanting to retire and travel the world together at 30 because your spouse *inherited* enough money to do so is called leeching? Lose attraction for someone who has no ambition? Oh I'm sorry, I didn't realize that you need to work a shitty job 40 hours per week to be considered attractive."
AmItheAsshole,fcrln0t,t1_fcrjfwh,1577903423.0,"Not sure how that answers my question. You're right, if he hadn't met OP he probably never would have had the means to travel like he wanted to, that would have been unfortunate, but that's not really what we're talking about. If OP doesn't actually want to travel, like she says she does in her post, that's fine, but there's nothing wrong with the boyfriend bringing it up."
AmItheAsshole,fcrk4o6,t1_fcq2zi1,1577902864.0,"What an asshole, living off his wife's *inheritance*, traveling the world together like they always dreamed. Fuck that guy."
AmItheAsshole,fcrj21u,t1_fcrbmiy,1577902468.0,"And if you don't want to work, even if you have the financial stability to retire and travel, you're a worthless piece of shit?"
AmItheAsshole,fcritmm,t1_fcq91wu,1577902382.0,"Thank you! Not to mention it's an inheritance from her wealthy parents, not a fortune that she personally built. Yet the only thing anyone can focus on is how *lazy* he is. Kind of sick."
AmItheAsshole,fcrhkjr,t1_fcras99,1577901912.0,"I agree that his behavior and entitlement are red flags, but I'm just curious, what's wrong with not wanting to work? OP admits in her post that their dream is to travel. Assuming the amount of money is as large as OP suggests, why not travel? Why are you all trying to vilify this guy for being lazy?"
movies,fcrbzg9,t1_fcqa8i3,1577899772.0,Objectively wrong? Really? In a thread about movies?
worldnews,fcny23q,t1_fcn26x7,1577820666.0,"I know it's tempting to put all your blind faith in the power of the free market, but you really don't think that bargaining power is perhaps *slightly* skewed in favor of the employer under the current system? You don't believe in *any* sort of regulation to correct that imbalance? I can tell you didn't pay attention during the industrial revolution section of your history class, or if you did, you always pictured yourself as one of the robber barons instead of the poor child laborer you would have been."
trees,fclm5p8,t1_fck4t2c,1577751030.0,"This is not an issue with Chinese vapes. The ""vaping illness epidemic"" was caused by *black market* manufacturers in the *United States* filling *illegal* vape cartridges with questionable ingredients (specifically vitamin E acetate). Inhaling anything except air isn't exactly healthy, but cartridges sold in recreational dispensaries in legal states are as safe as any other method of consumption. Stop fear mongering."
trees,fcll3e9,t1_fcjt7ey,1577750305.0,Yeah those full service restaurant/bar movie theaters are all the rage right now but imagine the day when you can order like a single use vape pen or a 10mg edible to go with your movie and popcorn.
todayilearned,fchxmwe,t1_fchv7vp,1577655329.0,"Hmm I would've guessed Bozeman but I thought the median income was higher than that. Based on the info I found it looks like the median household income for Gallatin county is about $60k but for the city of Bozeman specifically it's $48k, so you're right. It sure feels like MT is about to experience the same type of growth that people in CO, OR, and WA, have been complaining about for the past 20 years."
todayilearned,fchupdm,t1_fchnhf4,1577654363.0,Hmmm... Whitefish?

worldnews,fc6x8fa,t1_fc5txib,1577491835.0,"I would argue that Amazon only exists because of the thousands of employees who *actually* provided the labor to build it into what it is today. Not because one guy had a good idea years ago. 

I'm not suggesting any particular solution, I'm just saying maybe we should start asking ourselves if we want to support a system that allows one man to accumulate $100 billion (even just in stock) or if we maybe want to change the rules a bit for the greater good. Apparently this is the system that you want, that's fine, but there's nothing that says this is the only way, or even the best way."
worldnews,fc6w953,t1_fc645yy,1577491115.0,I don't think that explanation gives enough credit to the thousands upon thousands of employees who *actually* provided the labor to build Amazon into the company it is today. But now we're just getting into a difference in opinion.
worldnews,fc6vzmd,t1_fc6b1d0,1577490923.0,Can you just copy and paste this reply all over this thread? I don't know why people think the only two options are planned communism or laissez faire capitalism with nothing in between. Thanks for the info.
worldnews,fc62m5w,t1_fc60sph,1577470863.0,I don't think you know what the word society means...
worldnews,fc62i71,t1_fc60pje,1577470791.0,"If we were operating in a truly free market, sure, that would be the case, but we're not. We are operating under regulated capitalism and there's no reason we can't regulate further. Well, except for billionaires lobbying against progress."
worldnews,fc5z2ye,t1_fc5y85l,1577468815.0,"I'm not saying I, or anyone else, should solely dictate anything. But perhaps it's a conversation that we, *as a society*, should start thinking about. If you think that the blind accumulation of wealth is the only thing that matters, fine, your voice will be heard. Other people have different priorities, that's all."

worldnews,fc5wrvr,t1_fc5wjzs,1577467533.0,"I didn't say they don't deserve high levels of compensation, just maybe not *that* high."
worldnews,fc5t546,t1_fc5sfml,1577465293.0,No shit. My question remains. Why does Jeff Bezos deserve $100 billion worth of Amazon stock if he didn't personally create that value?
worldnews,fc5sfof,t1_fc5i5wd,1577464835.0,This is the only reasonable comment I've seen in this whole thread. What sort of fixes or solutions are you hinting at specifically?
worldnews,fc5rxws,t1_fc5joky,1577464537.0,I don't want to stop shopping on Amazon. I want to shop there knowing that a higher percentage of my dollar is going to workers.
worldnews,fc5rjh3,t1_fc5nf0r,1577464324.0,"Right, and that kind of sacrifice is totally worth $100 BILLION. That seems like a fair trade... No one is saying the CEO shouldn't be compensated well, we're just saying that right now, perhaps they don't need to be compensated *that* well."
worldnews,fc5r5td,t1_fc5ox0m,1577464123.0,"Not well enough, according to most of the people in this thread. That's the whole point. I guess it boils down to a difference in opinion. You think that Bezos deserves $110 billion for the work that he's done, I disagree. On the other hand, I think his workers deserve a higher percentage of the value they produce, you disagree. You want to help CEOs, I want to help all the people who actually provide labor and create value. I can't say I understand it, but you're certainly entitled to your opinion."
worldnews,fc5oxjc,t1_fc5mrxi,1577462893.0,Seems reasonable.
worldnews,fc5ohbm,t1_fc5llsc,1577462653.0,"Right, and Jeff wouldn't have a company without 750k people working their asses off. We could do this all day.
