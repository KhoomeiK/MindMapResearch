What kind of shots depends on his age and your region and the dog's lifestyle, but all that can be worked out at the vet. Typically Rabies and Distemper/Parvo are the core vaccines and then we go from there."

The only 'jiggle' they can assign is the type of jiggle you get from the motion of things like earrings in the wind, they can't make a unique motion for it...yet anyway, who knows what the future holds.

AskReddit,fedgbki,t1_fedflm8,1579010758.0,"It still pertains to one’s sex, I don’t understand why you’re inferring otherwise? I’m talking about physical, sexual attraction to other physical humans. You’re inferring cartoons for some reason. My point is it’s that feeling to other humans is more important than the actions taken thereafter. 

A straight man that has sexual feelings for a post op trans woman that no one would be able to identify as trans...is still straight.  Because they are attracted to a female that has all the characteristics of the opposite sex to them. Chromosomes be damned."

AskReddit,fedc3n3,t1_feda4dw,1579007212.0,"So you only define sexuality at sex and relationships? Despite people experimenting and recognizing that as not what they want or abstinent people or virgins? C’mon, you know that’s that not true. So you recognize the role the literal attraction plays. 

I’m still defining sexuality as real life humans btw, but keep using hyperbole. That’s fine."
AskReddit,fedbwyu,t1_fed9pio,1579007042.0,"That is why I said, let me introduce you to one. Lol let’s keep up now."
AskReddit,fed8zo2,t1_fecqx33,1579004147.0,"I think that's where our definitions will permanently differ. I don't define sexuality as who one has sex with, I define at as who one has a sexual attraction for. As people who have never had sex or those abstain or whatever reason still retain that attraction. The 'pop' so to speak. That's why so many people come out before having sex. One does not need a relationship for that, in my opinion. And that's where most things go to shit, as we're relying on what the other person labels themselves as versus really knowing what that attraction is, but that's life.

I understand and respect that you want sexuality to fit in a small, neat little box, but unfortunately it can't. It's messy. It blurs lines sometimes. It changes sometimes. Just like gender and, as you admit the existence of an 'other' category although I think intersex is the proper term, even biological sex."
AskReddit,fecph3y,t1_fecp1co,1578979979.0,"How do you identify intersex individuals? People with Turner's syndrome, Kleinfelters? Those born with ambiguous genitalia? 

Is a straight man who is attracted to a post-op trans woman on feminizing hormones trans woman still straight? Independent of the chromosomes or your assigned biological sex? What if he is attracted independent to knowing her chromosomes? The attraction is an instinctual pop. Not a ""let me look at your chromosomes then I'll know"". 

I think getting hung up on ""biological sex"" is the downfall to your descriptions regarding sexuality."
AskReddit,fecp8vh,t1_fecogut,1578979775.0,"I'd definitely agree with that overall sentiment. I think mostly because I find homosexual/heterosexual seem a bit more clinical. At their base it's an attraction to the same/opposite sex for me. 

But as a person who identifies as a homosexual man, there are so many very manly, masculine sexually attractive trans men. And that attraction is independent and before seeing their genitalia. A ""pop"" or a ""spark"" so to speak. 

Likewise, there are many beautiful, curvy transwomen that I think most men would have trouble identifying from biological women, particular post-op. If a straight man is attracted to a post-op trans woman - are they still straight? Independent of them knowing if she is transgender? I would still support that they are, independent of that person's chromosomes."
