HumansBeingBros,ff5bxn6,t3_erj5sb,1579586663.0,"This reminds me of my own kitties. The older one, Bleach was found by my mom under a car in the parking lot behind our house when she was coming home from work. He meowed until she found him and brought him home. It's been 5 years and we almost lost him in last August when he had bladder stones. I had to be with him 24/7 for almost a month. He is fine now and he usually wakes one of us up by licking our faces and purring.

The younger one, Johnny was brought home by my sister from a shelter. He is fine but when Bleach was sick they couldn't be in the same room because they would've started to play and Bleach couldn't have handled that. Johnny was so worried. He usually sleeps next to my bed on a chair.

They are best buddies and love each other. They often clean the other one and sleep next to the other. I love them both and now I can't imagine my life without them."

My brother attends MIK (faculty of engineering) and he enjoys it but it's not the best quality of education. The university might have a good reputation though bc of the med school so it might look good on your cv.

The city is good and welcoming (if you know which parts you should avoid) but you might struggle with the language barrier because not that many people speak English even in shops and such.

If a kid has bad grades in elementary school they probably have some kind of disorder/difficulty and they need help not scolding.

I don't mean 'I don't care' in a negative way and if I come across something about things that I usually don't care about I don't write it off as something unimportant."

fatlogic,fcty5fx,t3_eiviz5,1577965387.0,"Maybe childhood obesity is caused by unhealthy eating, overeating and a lack of regular exercise? No, the kid won't starve and die if he doesn't get a snack. Nutrious foods like vegetables, low-fat meats and fruits are the best things a child can eat. There's nothing wrong with giving a snack to a kid but making the kid eat only snack-like and processed food is straight up child abuse. No, Karen, oreos are not breakfast nor are pancakes for every morning. An oily hamburger with a full plate of oily fries is not a good lunch and mac'n'cheese is not always good for dinner.

I told this story already but will tell it again. Few years ago I had a surgery where I got screws in my jaw to get teeth on them. In the room I was placed in there was a mentally disabled little girl, around 9 years old. She had to get anesthesia to have tartar removed from her teeth because she didn't wash them nor let anyone help her and because of her disability they couldn't do it while she was awake. Anyway, she was kind of big for her age. When her procedure was done and she was still asleep her doctor came in and told her parents/guardians that the girl is on the verge of obesity and they should do something about it. And the doctor said the best thing someone ever could when talking to the parents of an obese kid. 'You know, she is young and full of energy, she won't have any problems if she skips a meal or doesn't eat for a day. Don't overfeed her and give her less sugar or you can soon come back and we can do this again'."

insanepeoplefacebook,fbxb68c,t3_eexrxp,1577178037.0,"I am not from the U. S. so I just can't possibly understand why would anyone need a military weapon for protection. I mean yeah, if you want to have a gun to protect yourself a pistol is enough, if you hunt a shotgun is enough. But why a weapon that was invented for military use? What could possibly happen that would justify the civilian use of an automatic gun? I agree that it's not guns what kill people, it's people who kill people but if they have limited access to guns it makes it harder to kill.

In the last two days I was looking up mass shootings and I was amazed how many mass shootings happened in the U. S.. In my country there was only one shooting incident and there was only one person who died and another who was injured. Here you can't own a gun if you are not a police officer, part of the military or part of a government approved hunting society. This person purchased a pistol illegally and started shooting in his class at the University. So while I agree that a ban on guns wouldn't eliminate the mass shootings it would certainly make it harder for the shooter. Imagine what would have happened if this person had access to a military weapon."
