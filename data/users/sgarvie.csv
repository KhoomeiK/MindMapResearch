depression,fegfbsn,t3_eoygo4,1579090835.0,Never did that one before. But I definitely ran out of tears. I did however fall asleep crying in a shower once.
NovaScotia,fdqatb1,t3_embdjm,1578661469.0,"Man leave the guy alone. Im pretty sure the Cindy Days of the world are saying the exact same thing as their weather apps. They just have fancy words to throw in with it. They also get cool green screens to point at. So you can either listen to a ""Professional"" or someone saying the same thing but reminding us to get our storm chips. Im also pretty sure this made this guys entire life. If you dont like it dont watch it. 

PS Internet bullying hurts too. He might see this. I bet it doesnt make him feel great."
depression,fcz9trv,t3_ejamne,1578096581.0,Nope. I can cry at the drop of a hat. It’s my super power.
depression,fcn4r5n,t3_ehzrkw,1577803232.0,"Good for you! I did the same thing over a year ago. I realized that social media is so bad for mental health. I don’t have to see other people’s fabulous vacations, or celebrities million dollar cars. I’m not bombarded with negativity and opinions. Giving information that just simply infuriates me. No more group chats about meeting up or doing something. Which causes stress to those who find this stuff mentally taxing. No more requests for donations. Seriously people of earth. We don’t have any money! Stop asking for my breakfast! Did you see that post? No. Did you see those pics? No. Do you see... let me stop you there. No. Well what do you do they ask? I reply. Focus on my own life and the people that actually matter to me. Read books, bond with my dog, clean my house, exercise, plan, relax and have a clear head. Well as much as possible on the clear head front. I do have depression and anxiety pouring out of me like a coke machine at MCDs. But hey now I got a major contributor or escalator of this disease gone. Good luck!"
depression,fcn3yc1,t3_ee58qm,1577802607.0,That’s terrible. “The worst part about having a mental illness is people expect you to behave as if you don’t”
sysadmin,fankzt2,t3_e910i5,1576243811.0,Lets start a North American IT workers Union. Imagine the power we would have!
