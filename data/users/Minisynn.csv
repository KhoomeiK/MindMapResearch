But it's literally the Chinese governments fault lol wtf?? 

If they had made attempts to contain it before it started popping up in the rest of the world this wouldn't even be an issue for countries outside of China. They opted so heavily to cover it up that they literally arrested journalists who reported on it.

Your responses scream Chinese shill but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt - maybe you're just a regular dickhead"
todayilearned,fg0i7qm,t1_fg0grld,1580408319.0,"Right but the guy you originally replied to said that the lie about IRA gunfire sparking Bloody Sunday had been disproven, then you replied talking about how they *did* open fire - which in the context obviously made it look like you were trying to argue that it was IRA gunfire that sparked Bloody Sunday. 

So yeah, you're right that the IRA were in the Bogside when Bloody Sunday happened, but considering the Bog was one of the most IRA-activity heavy areas of the country with literal armed ra checkpoints and patrols the Paras absolutely knew what would happen if they started firing in the Bog - they were always acutely aware of armed IRA presence there. This time they just tried to use it to justify a massacre."

> In his statement to the Inquiry, the Official IRA gunman who fired the two pistol shots at the paratroopers said the Official IRA had been ordered to ""maintain a defensive stance"" during the Bloody Sunday march.

> Meanwhile the Official IRA man who fired a shot from a .303 rifle prior to the Bogside killings, said in his statement that he went to an arms dump in Colmcille Court to retrieve a rifle after he realised that two civilians had just been shot in nearby William Street by a soldier as the Bloody Sunday marchers approached the Bogside.


> ""It was clear to me from the fact that he was aiming that he might fire again. He was pointing his weapon at the crowd and sighting along it. I took a split second decision and fired an aimed shot. When I next looked the guy had gone. I put the rifle in the boot of a car and it stayed there until after the army operation"", his statement says.


While your exact phrasing might be correct, you're being disingenuous as fuck. There was 0 return fire or IRA aggression until the British soldiers had already murdered multiple people. 

The IRA members were also defending the bogside, not William Street which is where the killing began - so trying to use them to justify it is ridiculous."
movies,fg0btmn,t1_fg07gv5,1580404498.0,"I think it's a far more nuanced issue than you and the guy you're responding to make it out to be, and like many social norms which are constanly perpetuated by men and women alike, the fault doesn't lie with just one group."
todayilearned,fg09jiq,t1_fg05sek,1580403125.0,"Lol fuck away off, the entire point of the enquiry/investigation was to ask WHY the soldiers fired, and their own government found that there was no reasonable cause.

I'm from Derry, the paras were originally largely welcomed here with open arms by NI Catholics because of how brutally the RUC police force treated us. It wasn't until repeated atrocities, working with Unionist paramilitary groups and more that they turned the population against them. They have nobody to blame but themselves.

Also, I don't know how much you know about the Paras during the Troubles but they were bloodthirsty cunts. They were making bets about kill counts before the Ballymurphy massacre, as an example. They also used a catholic mans skill as an ashtray. The list goes on and on. Read up on them and the Troubles and you'll never try to defend them with stupid conjecture like this comment again."
