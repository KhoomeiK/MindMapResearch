However, knowing the situation is that she was *playing* on her phone **while you were trying to get her in the mood** definitely makes her the asshole.

Keep reading only if you want actual advice on the situation:  
You shouldn't have simply gotten up and walked away. Confronting her, and letting her know how you felt would likely have ended better (well, it should). By saying: ""hey babe, I don't feel like you're into this. If you're not, that's cool, I can take care of it by myself."" would have gotten your point across in a much less hostile manner. That would have also given her the option to decide if she wanted to get into it and please you, or sit this one out.

Now, since you can't change the way this situation was handled, all you can do is communicate. Take some time to sit down and ***calmly*** discuss what happened. Apologize for walking away, but let her know your feelings were hurt.   
Maybe bring it up in couples counseling, where you'll have someone to keep you both on track. Also, try changing her birth control (or using another method), not all BC kills libido."
