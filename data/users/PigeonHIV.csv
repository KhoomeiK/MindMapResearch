SuicideWatch,feumauz,t3_eqnqcr,1579387899.0,"No one has a “place” in this world, we’re all placed on this earth, without a choice, it’s what you make of your time here is what separates people."

SuicideWatch,fek6487,t3_eplsfy,1579193398.0,"Be a strong shoulder for them to rest on, and help them out of this low point by showing your support. 
Bring them along to fun things, as the other Redditor put it, show them the fun in life."
SuicideWatch,fek5zjc,t3_eplurv,1579193320.0,"Well done! This is the right attitude! Always give life more chances. 

I hope this year goes well for you. Check out some new areas, try new hobbies, experience a bunch of new things, go to theme parks, do it all! Isn’t this exciting!"
SuicideWatch,fee2843,t3_eooqg7,1579024872.0,"If you shoot yourself in the head directly you risk only hitting your neocortex, which would be potentially fatal, for a certain death, it’s better to go from the mouth up. 

Please consider your options, you don’t have to die, it may sound cheesy but I really care about your situation. Life is probabilistic, you can always rise up. 

If you really want to, then the best thing I can say is goodbye."
SuicideWatch,fe9yd58,t3_eo8idg,1578942573.0,"If you want to go, it’s your choice, but I can’t recommend it. 
Thank you for your time on Earth, and even though I never knew you in person, I’m sure you are a great person who has made a true positive impact on those around you. 

You don’t have to go. But if you decide to, I just want to say goodbye."
SuicideWatch,fe9t2y6,t1_fe9i2l3,1578941248.0,"Hey, give it a shot, and don’t worry if you fail, although I bet you’re clever enough to ace them. 
No pressure. Just take it easy."
SuicideWatch,fe9e5qo,t1_fe9cf1b,1578936748.0,"I understand, try your hardest, but always prioritise yourself and your health over others, if your parents are paying this much for your school, they obviously love you and will do anything for you. Just tell them how you feel. If they get angry that school is making their kid depressed, then ignore them, you’re better with other support."
SuicideWatch,fe9bj03,t1_fe9anaa,1578936063.0,"Look, we go through highs and lows in our life, like a wave, currently you’re at a low. The high will come. Don’t give up so easily man, keep going strong, it’s tiring to persevere, believe me, I know. But it’ll eventually work up."
SuicideWatch,fe9abpm,t3_eo6v9i,1578935812.0,"Today may be shit, tomorrow might not, you never know what life has in turn for you. Stick around, sit it through to the end. 

I don’t believe people can inherently be born as failures, you still have boundless opportunities."
SuicideWatch,fe99wmm,t3_eo6wvg,1578935684.0,"I’m 16 too, I get it, life is tough as a teenager. I know the overwhelming stress of exams, and I’ve tried to give up as well. 

I’ve come to the realisation that nothing we do in school really matters so much that it hurts our families, they know you’re a capable person, and that school doesn’t limit success in the future. 

16 is a bit of a young age to die though isn’t it? Let’s give life some more chances, fuck school if it makes us unhappy, let’s just sit it though to the end. Life’s short as it is, no need to end it sooner than it already does. 

Want to talk more? I’m here for you."
SuicideWatch,fd5qlxt,t3_ek4cw6,1578180379.0,What do you mean?
SuicideWatch,fd5qeos,t3_ek3sf0,1578180313.0,"You are in no way inferior, remove that thought completely, many people dread working a lot, you’re not alone on that. But it’s actually not that bad once you get to do it, and if you find the right job for you. You’ll enjoy it, and find the 40 hour week limiting. 

There are more options out there apart from suicide, never let yourself believe that it’s the only way out."
SuicideWatch,fd5pkhq,t3_ek3urb,1578180018.0,"You sound like you’re going through a lot right now, you’ve spilled your thoughts and emotions into this post, which is nice  as we can see where to help you. 

I want to start off by saying that no matter how hard life gets, suicide should never be the answer, and it will never be the only option you have left.

I know school can be hard, believe me, I’m going through it right now. School is not worth taking your life over, and by no means does failing a class mean that you’re going to fail at life (many “failures” become super rich).

Also keep in mind that the teenage years are the most volatile and vulnerable when it comes to mental health. 

From what you’ve described, you seem like a unique and talented person, it’d be a shame to see you go :)"
SuicideWatch,fd5nr5k,t3_ek43w0,1578179462.0,"Happy birthday, you deserve every kind message you get, ok? Never sell yourself short. 
You are not scum, many people want to be wished happy birthday, and are entitled to a kind message. 
I have no doubt you’re an amazing person with capability, and you have a remarkable potential to do whatever you want."
SuicideWatch,fd1ibie,t3_ejupz4,1578131621.0,"Explain, we’re here to talk."
SuicideWatch,fd1i766,t1_fcz6n9t,1578131571.0,"Honestly, my true opinion is that you shouldn’t go to school or take a long break if this is the impact. 

Mental health comes before everything, always. Discuss this with a school counsellor, and/or parents. I know what I say may seem cliché, but consider it because I believe it will help you. 

People really do care how you do, humans are naturally empathetic, but above all, never underestimate the love of your parents and friends. They will go to extreme lengths to help you. 

Aside from that I wish you good luck in your academic career, from what you’ve said, you sound like a thoughtful and intelligent person. 
Stay strong."
SuicideWatch,fcy4qus,t1_fcy3cug,1578074759.0,"You may want to talk to someone about this, it seems quite serious, no matter how insignificant it feels. 
Teenage years are especially delicate when it comes to mental health, and it’s good to keep in check."

SuicideWatch,fcxviof,t1_fcxsejn,1578071109.0,Do you want to list a few of the other reasons? Are your parents putting pressure on you? Is it the humiliation?
SuicideWatch,fcxkg90,t1_fcxfnlq,1578065115.0,"Tell her, and your other family members, don’t worry about what they think for now, the important thing is to tell them. 

I can guarantee that they won’t reject you for it."
SuicideWatch,fcxff53,t1_fcxf8nj,1578061516.0,"No, don’t look at it that way, in no way are you a burden to someone who loves you. Because they genuinely care about you. 

Let your girlfriend help you, then you can become the strong one who can support her. It’s a mutual relationship."
SuicideWatch,fcxf9e1,t3_ejfxpx,1578061393.0,"I know this sounds hard, but take it easy, you need to have faith in yourself. 
You’ll do fine in this job, as long as you relax. 
Also it will be quite healthy for you, it will help you develop your social skills as well as comfort in society."
SuicideWatch,fcxf06j,t1_fcxee6x,1578061196.0,"But there are other ways, it sounds like you have depression, seek counselling, tell people close to you, you will be supported because they love you. You’ve got a lovely girlfriend who will no doubt go to the ends of the earth to make sure you’re happy. 

In life there are always multiple options and probabilities, it’s simply how the universe works. 
You’re also not alone, the fact that you came to this subreddit shows that you’re telling us about your problems, which is a great start!"
SuicideWatch,fcxemjf,t3_ejfsnn,1578060902.0,"Hey there, 
It sounds like after the death of your parents, you got depression, which has probably lead to your suicidal thoughts. 
If I were you I’d tell your friends and family, because they will go to the ends of the earth to support you (if that’s what you want). Of course it’s entirely your choice if you want to die, and you have all right to do so. 

But at least tell people close to you. You are not a burden to them, they love you. 

You can get out of this depression, I used to be severely depressed, you just need the right support."
SuicideWatch,fcxdxmr,t3_ejfrvj,1578060357.0,"Do you want help? 

If you really want to die, then I am not in any place to stop you. But I would advise otherwise, life is beautiful and there are  boundless opportunities. 

If you want to talk anonymously, I’m here for you."
SuicideWatch,fcxdpsu,t3_ejf060,1578060183.0,"Why’d you post this here? Do you want help? Or is this just a statement that you want to die, and that you’re gonna do it no matter what?"
SuicideWatch,fcxdh10,t3_ejfesu,1578059984.0,"Why? I can’t understand why a class is more important than your life. 
I do well in exams, and are stressed out about them a lot. But they aren’t worth taking your life over."
SuicideWatch,fcxdbkk,t3_ejfgkn,1578059859.0,"I don’t believe anyone is inherently terrible or evil. You’re feelings obviously arise from past trauma. I would suggest you look for a counsellor who can help you understand these feelings. 
I do not suggest suicide, there’s more to life than what has happened to you. This is an obstacle. Stick around for some more, ok? 

Stay strong."
SuicideWatch,fcxd3j1,t3_ejfhn5,1578059674.0,"Well, if you’ve decided to do it already, and no one can convince you otherwise. Why would you post it here? 
I seriously don’t advise it btw, you can’t have done everything in life."

SuicideWatch,fcjtzwd,t3_ehknhj,1577704641.0,"Technically but it’s gonna be extremely unpleasant and almost like torture until you finally die. 

It’s not worth it. Stick around for a bit longer. 
Ok?"
SuicideWatch,fcjty00,t3_ehkopp,1577704565.0,"Hypothermia hurts a lot until the final stages where you feel “warm.”
It is not a comfortable way to go, even with Benzo and alcohol. 
You’re worth more than you think you do, you are a talented person, don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. 

Give life a few more chances, well, that’s my take on it anyways. 

But if you want to die, I am no one to stop you, just don’t do it in the way you describe. 

If you want to talk, I’m here, I will listen, and understand. 

Stay strong."

But you have to keep trying, it may seem pointless now, but later on you’re going to thank yourself for persevering through what seems like a growing Hell.

If your girlfriend leaves you instead of helping, then you’re better off without her. 

It is very wise of you to seek professional help.

The world isn’t “mean’t” for anyone, but we all bring our talents to it, and make it a better place.
You said you feel inconsistent, this is a great feature for art, which you said you wanted to do, because you enjoy it. 

Do what you love, there are careers out there which require an artistic talent which I have no doubt you’d thrive in. 

Seek out new opportunities, and make this world your own."
