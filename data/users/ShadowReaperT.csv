The battle pass avoids gambling, but does it promote gaming addiction? You could argue general leveling, which has existed for a long time, would garner the same gaming addiction so battle passes make no difference, but battle passes are usually also limited time, so you have to play a lot in a short period - or pay to get progress faster. And with more games using them, you either feel punished for playing more than one game or for not playing enough.

Don't get me wrong, they're leaps and bounds better than loot boxes, but I am worried of it promoting addiction - and this is from someone who regularly plays video games for hours (1700 hours in GTAV, 700 in Rainbow 6, 400 in Divinity 2..)"

I really wanted a set too. Don't suppose you have a link to the 12 pack?

Edit

[Found em](https://www.krakendice.com/bloodbath-12pc-glow-in-the-dark-kraken-logo-with-red-ink-for-rpgs/). I didn't search before because.. I didn't expect them. The fact they only advertised the D10/D6 packs most clearly seemed an odd choice, but who am I to judge?"
AskReddit,fehs8js,t1_fehozks,1579122844.0,"I know they have different weights, but the recommended is something like 10% of your weight, right? I'd be worried my dog wouldn't be able to get out from under it if s/he (one of each) wanted to get out."

Yeah I'm aware of that, it's fun to make random characters sometimes, but the subscription thing, at least to me, seemed badly worded."

I'm just not very creative in that aspect lol"

Good job otherwise though :)"

IAmA,feh9gjr,t3_ep5pfa,1579111916.0,"- Why is the hand-painted so expensive for a single one? I understand that it's done by professionals, but if we take the cost of a single unpainted miniature into account, with the cost of supplies (which I'm guessing you, or the painter, will buy in bulk at a cheap-ish price) then you're looking at around $100 just to paint it.

- I'm a bit confused about the subscription, and what's included in the service. Do we have to pay a subscription just to be able to create a painted miniature (and then pay again to have it printed/painted)? What exactly does the subscription include vs what you can get without it?"

However, I always make sure they're clean, and if they were ill or whatever they wouldn't be in or on the bed at all."
