Pets,ffwm2n5,t3_evi3ez,1580305192.0,"A lot of people have really good answers here. What my mom did with our family dog is she got him to ring a bell every time he needed to go out. We had a bell hanging off the door and every time we took him outside we could have him boop his nose on the bell and wouldn’t take him back inside until he did his business. When he did, he was rewarded. 

I read somewhere though that puppies have some kind of regression in this kind of thing at around 7 months, I know my dog did, but have patience. You can work through it. If your dog had an accident in the house, please please PLEASE do not “rub the dog’s face in it” as punishment. They won’t understand what they did wrong. If you’re going to discipline your dog at any point it needs to be within like 1 second of the crime or caught in the act. Even so, hitting is definitely not a way to go... dogs understand tone of voice quite well though"
