What works.....

Make yourself a schedule to self-share 4-5 items a day and a daily goal of cross posting 5 items to EBay and Mercari. Consistency is key but don't overwhelm yourself.... progress is awesome.

Search your local thrift stores area (think outside Goodwill) and research their social media. Do they run routine sales? One of my favorite thrift stores benefits a no-kill animal shelter and they hold a $1 clothing sales each month. I'm there in line before they open. Vintage, trendy or classic dresses and skirts are my bread n butter (little black dress and wool skirts). 

Tell your family and friends you're a reseller now. Explain why resellers are important. We save those donated items from ending up in a landfill. Tell em youll take off their hands anything they are considering donating. Both my Mom & sister-in-law. regularly give me pieces and they save their Amazon boxes and shipping materials so I can reuse for orders.
