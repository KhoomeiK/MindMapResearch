conspiracy,fguncwd,t1_fgucfo3,1581125038.0,"Good lord. You are arguing about nothing and not following our conversationat all. You said I get a refund when I dont and I dont know how to do my taxes because I owe at the end of the year (at most $100).  Of course our income determines how much we pay which is why it's automatically deducted from your paycheck in the normal world, most normal people don't wait all year to pay taxes and take two months to pay them off. If you own your own business or are a contractor you could do that but you're still supposed to be paying it quarterly at least but whatever. It's cool you think your version is superior but you are literally trying to say we are somehow different for paying taxes and you are better at it when it sounds like you just go about it weird but still pay....just like I do. 

Not for nothing but at 90k a year if it's taking you two months to ""pay off"" your taxes you really are not doing it right. If you know exactly what you owe and it's not coming out regularly what is stopping you from just saving that exact amount and paying it off in one go?"

He paid us for them. But we had the space available and were just unwilling to move on our budget. 

I'm having a hard time understanding how you know what your capacity is but are struggling to deal with them wanting to invite people. Tell them you are allowed 85 people and have already figured out who those 85 are, there is no negotiating the number as that is what the fire marshal will allow at the venue (just say it even if its not true). If they for some reason come back at you that you need to bump someone to make room for the ones they prefer then ask them if they are willing to give up their spot. Its super easy, you have 85 openings and they are all spoken for, the only ones they can control are their own, if they are not willing to give them up for someone else they need to shut up about it."

AmItheAsshole,ffrqtnj,t3_eurjt5,1580163777.0," NTA So let me speak to you as a first time pregnant woman who has never wanted to be pregnant and is pretty worried I will die due to complications of birth. It's a real fear and you don't have to have complications prior in order to die and if you are in the US we are the only developed country with increasing maternal death rates. Statistically your odds are still very low BUT it's still possible and I think planning for the worst and hoping for the best are super important, especially when it comes to a child you might not get a chance to meet. It's also a coping tool to deal with the things you can control (living will, final arrangements, what you might want the child to know or have) in a situation you can't control.

At any rate you said you are going to counseling and you don't want to solidify plans in the unfortunate event you might actually die and that is your choice. 

There is no way your FIL is getting in that hospital if you say you don't want him, again this is based on my knowledge of the US. Everyone I have spoken to has made it pretty clear I will dictate who will be in the room and who can visit after, it's 100% what I want not what anyone argues. 

I agree with other commenters, you should insist on going to your husbands next appointment to discuss all of this and see if hes been open or if his doctor is just unhelpful. How much do you want to save your marriage because you have to try now or it might reach a point of no return? Right now it's to the point where he's being irrational and not considering what you need support wise. While I'm afraid of death and have made plans, I am fully embracing this pregnancy and going all in as if it will be 100% ok at the end. He needs to get to that point, where he can accept theres a tiny chance he might lose you but odds are you will be a loving wife and mother for many many years. 

I'm concerned about what others have said, that he's got such intense tunnel vision he could be dangerous to you. Please go to a counseling session together and from there determine if you can safely be around him or if you should step away from him to have the baby and rebuild trust.

I'm really sorry you are going through this, pregnancy is stressful enough without this obstacle being thrown at you."
AmItheAsshole,ffprtv1,t1_ffpjtq2,1580103433.0,"Depending on the circumstances and in this circumstance it is wrong. The son is an adult who is not expected to pitch in financially or do any chores, they are not well off to begin with and she's about to be responsible for a new born. The son also has the option to continue living at his mom's, which his dad doesn't want to make him do since he has so many siblings. So the dad is literally only concerned about making the son more comfortable, not in anyway setting boundaries or coming to a financial agreement with his current wife, to whom he is legally and morally required to consider above adult children. 

The obvious compromise here is to let it be a guest room where he is allowed to stay as a guest so many times a week, and if other guests are expected then he would not be able to stay over. His primary home should remain at his moms. If the dad wants him permanently set up he needs to make it very clear what chores he does and what their budget is for food and he absolutely needs his wifes buy in or it can't happen."

You can't tell two equal people that one gets a benefit because they over extended themselves and the other gets nothing because they prioritized their debt. 

Basically you are saying a kid from a wealthy family who took out a bunch of loans and didn't care about paying them back deserves a break while another kid from a poor family, that worked full time in school and tried very hard to payoff the loan to not make it worse, deserves nothing.

Your analogies are terrible. 

If you want to use cancer as an analogy it would be like you just paid a loan of $120k for chemo and life saving treatments to survive cancer by selling your home to make the payment. Your friend  from work who is the same age and makes the same salary was right there with you also battling cancer, and also had a loan for $120k, but they were told not to worry about the loan by the government shortly after you made your final payment. It's really cool they were told that, you should be super happy for them, but if you pretend at all that you wouldn't be upset that you had to sell your house to pay off a debt that HAD YOU KNOWN would have been forgiven if you hadn't paid it, you are full of it. Your life is drastically different being $120k poorer than your peer who did nothing special to deserve a bigger break than you. They were not in a worse financial position, or jobless, or disabled or anything like that, they simply chose to not prioritize the debt the way you did and they still have their house and a clean financial slate.

You are saying that its ok for two twin brothers to be taken care of differently by the government simply based on choice and not circumstances beyond their control, I do not agree with that or you.

Lets pretend there are twin brothers. At the age of 18 all they knew if the only way to pay for school was to take out loans, there was nothing said that anyone would waive a magic government wand and forgive any left over debt. Brother A decides to mitigate that and go to a community college for an accounting degree and work full time while hes in school.

Brother B goes to a private college and  wants the full college experience, fraternity life, college clubs and sports events. He doesn't work while he is in school because it would distract from his school work and social life. He graduates at 24 but has over six figures in debt. He also ended up with an accounting job. Brother B makes a little bit more money, he works at a slightly nicer company because his frat brothers had connections but its not like its double what brother A makes. He never moved back home, went and got his own apartment in the city and makes the bare minimum payments to his student loans.

Both brothers have a child at the age of 27 and their own apartment and their own full time accounting jobs but live fairly different lives. Brother A lives a much more humble life since he had a slower start and wanted to make sure that debt was gone where brother B wants to live his life right now and live it to the max. Brother B gets a letter saying his six figures of debt is forgiven and brother A is told nice work on paying off his loan. Brother B has connections, had a wonderful college life at a prestigious school and now has a free pass to start fresh. Brother A got fucked no matter how bitter you are about that fact. Had brother A been told he could go debt free he would have made different life decisions, had he even known he could have saved most of his income and paid the bare minimum on his loans because it would all disappear he could have put his child in a better daycare and gotten that nicer apartment.

Hopefully that makes sense to you. This isn't about me being upset some people get nice things or some generational bitterness that young kids get something older folks don't. This is about the government punishing people of the exact same generation who are equal in all areas, but  with decision making, for doing a noble thing when they worked hard to pay off a debt. They just taught an entire group of people you get nothing for doing what is right and its ok to be a bit reckless because there's possibility of bail outs. I believe there are better ways to help people financially that are more fair and if that makes me a logical crab then I'll take it.

UpliftingNews,feo9d4x,t1_feo1lw5,1579296864.0,"Because you said to ""help the average citizen"" then you doubled down on why bailing out a minority group of 20 somethings was best for everyone but those 30 somethings can get bent.

UpliftingNews,feo86ii,t1_fenkmcu,1579296385.0,"It does negatively impact the person who altered their entire early adult life to mitigate debt. From going to cheaper schools, to working while in school, to taking longer to finish school, to missing out on social lives and delaying large financial life changes. To do all of that sacrificing to then be told there's no negative consequence to you if someone who didn't have to do any of that had their debt erased is a slap in the face. Your basically saying its ok for them to have struggled and figured out how to pay it since they did they must not have ""needed"" that money, which is absurd and punishes people for doing the right thing. 

Everyone who went to school and had to pay for it without grants or scholarships should be refunded X amount. It's the only way to make it so it's not punishing people who slaved away to make good on their debts prior to this announcement."

AmItheAsshole,fem020x,t3_epnbxq,1579235468.0,"Based on your edit about how they are treating you I think you should go to the wedding. At this point your relationship might be over ecen if you stay. Your girlfriend sounds irrational from emotions and is taking it out on you and her mom is feeding the flames. Sometimes people feel comfort in distractions and hating you might be something they cling too to change their focus on why they are upset. Basically you're screwed and I honestly think you should go to the friends wedding. You wont have as much fun as you would have prior to all this but if you miss it and she leaves you anyway you will forever regret missing it. 

I'm not big on funerals so take what I think how you will. I just feel like you made a commitment already for a life event and it's literally one of the few things that can hold up against another life event, this isn't a sports game you had tickets too. She's not going to be rational but that doesn't mean you're terrible if you don't cater to her not giving a shit about anybody else right now. Good luck with it all."

People definitely had their teenage grandson living with them and many places had an adult child with them. One of the loopholes is to say they are just visiting but there were definitely situations where they were not saying that and the people could stay.

I never understand the mentality of picking out the ""perfect"" location to live only to try and disrupt it. If it's not for you then don't move there. If you are going to live there then assimilate and don't do things that will obviously upset people, like not taking care of your yard or leaving eye sores out in a neighborhood that generally does not have them. It has nothing to do with being a good school district and having kids, it has everything to do with you not vibing with the aesthetic. I can assure you as a home owner I don't give a crap what my neighbors social life or family makeup looks like, I dont care about their political or religious beliefs or their ages or ethnicities, but what I do care about is if they are quiet, respectful of my yard and take care of their stuff. You are actively destroying your own property value and actively lowering theirs, how is that being financially prudent? That is just being cheap in the worst way. Take care of your biggest investment and be a decent human and maybe consider other people are worried about their biggest investment. Don't be the reason the neighborhood trends downward, be the reason it was as nice as it was when you decided it would be a great place to live.
