raisedbynarcissists,ffijcba,t1_ffiasqv,1579975245.0,Thank you. And to you as well. :)
raisedbynarcissists,ffia73s,t1_ffi62hp,1579969020.0,"We are. That part about feeling like you're betraying her, I'm dealing with currently. She just walked in and I almost threw my phone."
raisedbynarcissists,ffia3u7,t1_ffi3tkb,1579968955.0,My goodness. It's a wonder what they've done to us. The anxiety I got from just seeing the title alone. We will get through this. The robbery of self and sense of self.
AnxietyDepression,ffhumvr,t3_etkzlu,1579954693.0,"When I was 13, I had only just entered into what I understood was depression and anxiety. I spoke to a teacher that I trusted and an older sister like mentor of mine. In time, I went to therapy. 

I'm still on what can be a lifelong journey of therapy, but if you need help, talk to someone at your school you trust or any older adult/family member that you really know that you can talk to. If these aren't applicable, forums like these can offer support. 

And please, never think that your problems are small compared to others. They're issues that you need help with. Never be afraid to ask for help. Virtual hugs and love to you OP."
raisedbynarcissists,ffhu8h5,t1_ffhsxg5,1579954153.0,Thank you. I hope you receive the full clarity that you need. Lots of love to you and all the best in your journey of knowledge.
AnxietyDepression,ffhr3mm,t3_etmoiy,1579949461.0,There's a name for this?
CPTSD,ffhqyfa,t3_etjz82,1579949231.0,Colours and soft things. I didn't realise they were comforts until I tried to get rid of them and felt adrift.
raisedbynarcissists,ffhqh4u,t3_etll3q,1579948481.0,"This is going to be an uncomfortable read, but I'm willing. I read one article already and I'm feeling like I've read forbidden information. This is how abuse gets into your head. The instant you try to over come it, it starts trying to beat you back into a corner, even when your abuser isn't physically there. Thank you for your post OP. Thank you so much."
SuicideWatch,ffhq189,t3_etk2kd,1579947797.0,Hi OP. I hope you realise that you aren't alone. Being down often shields our eyes from the support we need or supports that are there. I do hope you feel the love and care you needed today. Lots of love to you. Have a virtual hug from an internet stranger.
raisedbyborderlines,ffgjku5,t1_ffesulk,1579907717.0,"So very true. The excuse is ""I've had a pretty messed up life"". Day after day I have to remind myself that that doesn't mean you should pass that on to your dependents in any way, shape or form."
CongratsLikeImFive,ffgj0n6,t3_etd7jl,1579907349.0,Congratulations OP! To many more great days like these! Lots of love to you!
raisedbyborderlines,ffeqyfh,t3_et60ty,1579861133.0,"The women in my family ghostwrote this. Or something. This is preached until, when you have your own offspring, you say the same. How the hell is this normal?"
narcissisticparents,ffc59in,t3_esppt1,1579791840.0,Sometimes posts like these make me realise that I experience and experienced situations like this. It's disconcerting.
CongratsLikeImFive,ff8medi,t3_es3r8h,1579685735.0,Congratulations! To a bright future and good health!
SuicideWatch,fexivf0,t1_fewzh6l,1579431710.0,"Some aspects of your reply I can understand all too well. I still can't make romantic attachments or even try to date. I just don't understand how to try. 

My mother too has been through hell and back, so she has been hardened by life, and wants me to be the same, but I honestly can't. My sister and I talk as strangers, during my childhood she wasn't ideal for my fragile mental health, so I understand that. 

I went to therapy for a few days and it wasn't all that I needed. I was expected to heal from years worth of trauma in weeks. I understand the concern of not finding the right therapist, but I am desperate to find one that fits. Maybe we can try together?  

Your response sounds so much like my life and it's disconcerting a bit. Sorry to make this a ""me"" response, but I do understand, to a scary degree, what you have endured. 

The part of your response about peace, I feel it. Deeply. But I realised that it was about the scenery I was in. The abandonment from my mom and siblings, even though they're physically here. I started my own version of therapy by trawling reddit subs and its eye opening. 

It may sound shallow, but please, do so as well. Itemise all the hurt that you have and research into it. Sometimes the therapists we need are ourselves. In time, if/when you are ready, go to a therapist. I hope you find the one that you need.

I hope that you can update to suit. I may not be what you need, but I care. Those who have taken time to respond care. We'd like to hear more from you. Lots of love to you OP."
Codependency,fesfft2,t1_fesdt65,1579364585.0,It's all good. At least now I can identify and change. Are you okay though?
SuicideWatch,ferd7vd,t3_eqdd6r,1579352556.0,"Hi OP. I see you are having a deep moment of reflection and not liking your perception of what you are seeing. Can I ask why? Or is it too invasive?

From one internet stranger to another, I understand the despair that you feel, not measuring up to what you believe you should measure up to, but, who gave you that meter stick to measure up to?

What if you freed yourself without having to die? What if opening up helps you find a group of people like you, with similar hopes and hurts? It's okay to feel adrift, but, please, don't set yourself free to the wind. Cry out your despair to the wind, free that hurt to the wind. Let it carry that hurt away, but not you that is seeking so much more. I love you OP. Please be safe. Update when you can."
Codependency,fer3jyr,t3_eqf2qv,1579349381.0,Wow. I'm in this picture and I don't like it.
narcissisticparents,fer34c4,t1_feotlhj,1579349182.0,"Thank you for your comment. I should clarify that the kids aren't mine but those of another sibling. I have no intention of having my own. I have tried to apply to jobs, but to no avail, so the dependency in that respect is draining. 

I know how earth shattering it is, to see the people who are supposed to be your supports turn out to be the exact opposite. I do hope your situation changes for the better and I will take your advice to look for those podcasts. Thanks again."
SuicideWatch,feoj6qw,t3_eq4j3o,1579300840.0,"Hi OP. I understand that things are bleak right now, but what about another sunrise? What about two or three? Or many many more?  I know that right now the hurt is deep, it's driving you to just want to stop it all, but please, stay. I know the words of a random internet person may not be what you need or want in this time, but please, update this post for many more sunrises. I love you and hope that you are here for many more updates."
SuicideWatch,feoeejw,t1_feoebl9,1579299042.0,Please do. I'm looking forward to hearing from you. Lots of love.
narcissisticparents,feoe6s8,t1_feody8m,1579298915.0,:)
narcissisticparents,feodrx2,t1_feod0l7,1579298736.0,I didnt think of that. Thanks so much for your advice.
SuicideWatch,feodin6,t3_epxpjc,1579298698.0,"I can only offer you a warm internet hug. You have endured so much. Reading it was an experience, so I can only imagine the hell you've been through in actuality. I wish you all the best and I love you dearly. Please, I hope you'll be here to update with a drastic positive change."

Anxiety,fegqaa1,t3_ep2lcn,1579100001.0,Congratulations!
CPTSD,fee9o2z,t3_eomjg1,1579029270.0,Are you me?
SuicideWatch,fee9lox,t3_eokb1t,1579029231.0,"It's sometimes not really about care, but worrying about saying the wrong thing or not being able to communicate effectively, at least from my experience. 

I only recently started practicing telling my friends that I love them, something that seems mundane to most folks, but with anxiety, it goes tenfold into ""they won't like this"" or ""they may be offended"" territory. 

People do care, they're afraid to express how. And sometimes, they aren't qualified to help you with certain problems/issues that a professional can."
SuicideWatch,fee8j1i,t3_eokkma,1579028597.0,"I know mine isn't tangible but I'm sending a warm, tight hug. I hope it comforts you."
SuicideWatch,feaykqx,t3_eo9o49,1578953575.0,"Hi OP. Please stay. I understand that right now things are very tumultuous for you, but know that one random stranger on the internet cares for you. I know it may not mean much, but please, stay. The community wants to see your art. Your kitten is giving you a tangible hug because he wants you to stay. I know right now your mind is clouded, but please, let dawn and clear skies grace your mind again. I love you."
CPTSD,fe6wyv3,t3_eo0c6q,1578907062.0,"I am sorry you had to endure this. I understand a bit too well, uncomfortably so. Thank you for posting."
toxicparents,fe6apag,t1_fe68nwh,1578885625.0,"Thanks for your comment and good vibes. I'll look into the solar plexus chakra, because, oddly enough, I was speaking to a friend in passing about chakras and stuff. It's an interesting coincidence."
SuicideWatch,fe5s20t,t3_enqks5,1578873713.0,"Hi OP. I do hope that you are still here. Please, things seem bleakest when we've lost hope. I know that right now your mind is set, but please, don't. Please still be here."
SuicideWatch,fdvfpkn,t1_fdu761o,1578746962.0,Thank you. It would be much appreciated.
