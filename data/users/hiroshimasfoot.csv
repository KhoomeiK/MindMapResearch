depression,ffjjd92,t3_etw3gp,1579999544.0,I felt this hardcore
Thetruthishere,ffh79is,t1_ffgwt4o,1579925093.0,"You'd be surprised. I grew up around Lancaster but not specifically intercourse. Although I don't speak Pennsylvania Dutch, I do speak fluent German (my family is german). The ""Amish"" people that give horse and buggy rides to tourists literally spoke random words in PA dutch. Didn't make any sense."
Thetruthishere,ffg0yg6,t1_fff3jsz,1579896088.0,"Yes! No one ever remembers that except me. They filmed that 20ish minutes out from where I live and that caused a huge deal in the Amish community. If I'm not mistaken, the producers got threatened after airing too much and they shut the show down after a few seasons. It was all hush hush after that and now everyone acts like it never happened. Was really freaky."
Thetruthishere,ffg0k4w,t1_ffen8w0,1579895847.0,Oh my god Intercourse is the worst tourist trap. They have all kinds of fake Amish people and fake Amish attractions. people from New Jersey & new York eat that shit up.
Thetruthishere,ffg0d5m,t3_et5546,1579895728.0,"I live in Lancaster PA and it really makes me mad to see that Amish people are turned into a spectical for NJ and NY people to gawk at. It's really as horrible as you say it is and yet all these people think Amish are incredible. I've seen them horribly mistreat animals constantly. The horses go through so much and there were times that I wanted to so badly take the animals away. 

 I remember when the show Amish Mafia came out lol. That was quite a riot in the community. They shut that show down real quick."
depression,ffe856g,t1_ffca95x,1579839301.0,I know what it's like to feel so broken and empty so I try my best to help anyone who needs it. It makes me happy to see that I at least helped someone out there. Thank you :)
PublicFreakout,ffe5zbm,t1_ffd19fl,1579837595.0,im american and i speak two languages... what even was your point lol
PublicFreakout,ffe5p9v,t1_ffcrnyz,1579837382.0,lol i love this comment with my whole heart. I have no idea why you got so many downvotes but im so sorry
relationship_advice,ffcmn5g,t3_esufvn,1579802689.0,Honestly you sound kinda selfish and a little controlling. He was there for you... You should be there for him when he's going through a rough patch. That is if you actually love him. Not sure if you really seem like you love him
depression,ffaibfm,t1_ffa78rd,1579736404.0,Unfortunately I was forced to by a counselor at my school that thought I was in danger. Otherwise I wouldn't have

depression,ffa72xd,t1_ffa6m6k,1579729151.0,"I understand what you meant, you didn't make me upset. Don't apologize :) I just thought since you brought up the hospital, I should share my experience as a depressed person who went through that. 

However, the issue is that if you go to a hospital and say you are suicidal, they will not let that go. You will either be forced against your will or asked to go willingly. That's what happened to me despite the fact that I'm an adult. It sucked."
depression,ffa59js,t1_ff9vk8p,1579728147.0,"I was put in a hospital for a week for suicidal tendencies  and dear lord it was the worst week of my life. I'm sure other people here will say it really helped them but it didn't help me. 

A lot of mental wards are terribly mismanaged and the patients are treated horribly. Luckily I wasn't because I kept to myself. But I was put in a ward with people that had serious mental issues. Screamed all hours of the night. Treated horribly by hospital staff. Hospital staff verbally complained in front of me that they were assigned to the mental ward without even having proper training for it!

 I got zero sleep. I refused to shower because there was a one way mirror in my bathroom. The food was terrible. There was absolutely nothing to do. I felt like I was in prison. If anything I felt like my mental health was worse after that. It traumatized me. 

As for OP, I seriously recommend seeing an actual therapist. Therapists have helped me a lot more than the time I spent in the hospital. I was released wanting to die more. 

 I also reccomend letting the people who care in your life in. It's hard. I know you don't want to do that. But sometimes spilling it all out to someone helps tremendously.... The day my parents found out I tried to kill myself, was the day that I realized the severity of my actions. I witnessed my rock hard emotionless father collapse and cry right before my eyes. It was the worst feeling in the world to see that. 

 I know my criticism of hospitals won't help with most of the people giving advice here but it's just my personal experience. I don't want to see you even more broken after attempting to find help at the wrong hospital.

Edit: OP, I'm the same age as you! Seriously you are not alone! Life is going absolutely horribly for me as well! The only reason I am holding on is because of the people in my life that I know care. Please take time to breathe. You are okay. You are not alone. You are not at fault."
needadvice,ff9zkv7,t3_esg88i,1579724869.0,"Wow this sounds exactly like my life. I have struggled with this throughout high school and it got to a point in college that I had a mental break and ended up in a psych ward for a week. 

Ive tried almost everything. My OCD tics distract me when I attempt to put my phone away(hair twirling, biting fingers, lip biting, pulling my split ends apart). I can never focus on my homework. My attention span in classes is so poor. If I don't find a way to distract myself, I just end up spacing out and not paying attention to the lesson. 

I envy people who just get their shit done, no questions asked."
relationship_advice,ff9yifu,t1_ff9r6kx,1579724245.0,"This is so insulting. I was sexually assaulted two years ago. I now have a loving boyfriend of a year who knows what happened to me. literally all of this stuff you are saying is not true at all. No lines are accidentally crossed. I was broken from that incident like any normal human being but that does not make me a "" time bomb"". 

There's something called healthy communication in a relationship. If you have that, there's absolutely no reason to make the ridiculous claims that you are."
relationship_advice,ff9y2mk,t1_ff9dr10,1579723987.0,"lol. You asked for something to add to the discussion and u/bellajojo gave you an entire wall of text. All you have to say to that is ""get blocked"". clearly shows how flawed your way of thinking is."
relationship_advice,ff9xg2j,t1_ff99m51,1579723611.0,"you never ask someone what their therapy is for. They will tell you if they feel comfortable. I dont tell my parents what mine is for and obviously, I have known them my entire life. There is a reason why therapists are bound to an ethical practice law of ""confidentiality"", and NO ONE  has the right to know about what goes on except you and the therapist.

You sound incredibly ignorant. Respect boundaries, even if its your partner of 1.5 years. They will tell you when they are ready."
AskDocs,ff74wfg,t3_erxytx,1579641182.0,"I tend to only lurk on this sub since I'm NAD, but this post really intrigues me. 

I've never heard of this phenomena before. It would make a little more sense if this happens to you with any drink pouring, but it only happens with soda? That's quite odd. 

Im really interested on what professionals in this sub/doctors you might seek in the future have to say about this. Definitely update if you get some sort of answers."
religiousfruitcake,ff6ajc6,t1_ff62dvs,1579622947.0,why are you so pressed. Just leave the sub if you have a problem. Ive literally never seen someone so butthurt on reddit that they feel the need to write a comment about blocking someone lmao
relationship_advice,ff64xev,t3_ertq56,1579619221.0,"Someone who loves you would not try to drug you for sex. Someone who loves you would respect that you do not want to have sex. That is ridiculous. It's straight up attempted rape. You need to get out of that relationship and stop making excuses for yourself. The more you make excuses, the more it seems impossible to accomplish leaving. 

Just think about how crazy this is. Read what you just wrote and tell me that its perfectly okay to stay with someone like that. It's not. period. If he's willing to drug you, and lie to you about it to get what he wants, think about what else he could do to you."
Temple,fek8lh1,t1_fek4xjw,1579194871.0,are you okay in the head
college,fejwjdo,t3_epchz8,1579187478.0,"I'm actually in the same boat. I mostly sit in my dorm every chance I get. I end up not eating for hours on end just so I don't have to go to the dining hall and see people. I just go to class. That's it.

The past two nights however, people have reached out to me to hang out and honestly I was feeling quite isolated so I accepted. It felt really good to have just a few hours of conversation and laughter with others. 

Its actually really hard for me to not push people away and isolate myself. I don't really know why. But, it feels good to let yourself be included sometimes."
Thetruthishere,febtmmk,t1_feaysta,1578962585.0,I have the same questions
SiegeAcademy,fe9bjfa,t3_eo2gag,1578936065.0,"In lower ranks, solo queuing will most likely land you people like this, as well as land you a loss of rank. I started off in silver this season and my worst mistake was solo queuing. Try to find at least 3-4 other people to play with until you get into the upper gold ranks. The more you rank up, the more it weeds out the douchebags and game throwers."

badroommates,fdptce9,t3_emfi3k,1578639680.0,"My father told me of a roommate that did stuff exactly like this. In the warmer months, he said the dishes would attract hundreds of ants in their kitchen. 

He ended up getting so fed up that he took *all* the dirty dishes and dumped them on his roommates bed. Ants and all. 

While I do think that's not the *best* way to approach it... He did say the dishes never piled up in the sink ever again after that."
badroommates,fdnke5f,t1_fdnhimf,1578587640.0,You *and* your roommates need to confront her together. You having no life and no friends isn't even a valid argument in a situation like this. That makes no sense.

badroommates,fdnfbxc,t3_emb1tu,1578584598.0,"This would piss me off so much. It's basically excuse after excuse. 

I could never be that calm. I wouldve freaked out, especially if she blocked all of you so there was no way for communication. Communication between roommates is so important. 

All of you should confront her face to face and lay out everything she's done. That behavior isn't acceptable whatsoever."

unpopularopinion,fd7nd8u,t1_fd7ha3r,1578207135.0,"You are absolutely right. I never bring up politics to anyone no matter how delicately I try to put it. Always ends up putting a sour taste in your mouth afterwards, and in the end someone always gets butthurt.

Extreme leftists immediately disown people for being Republican. I've seen people get drinks thrown in their faces and food for wearing Trump hats in public. I've also seen the vice versa of this. 

 I feel like people these days need to calm down a little bit. I can't even scroll through Instagram or Twitter or basically any form of social media without seeing people fighting with each other over some political crap. I think I would be a much more politically passionate and interested person if I didn't see what it turned people into; aggressive, full of hate, and closed minded. 

Politics has become a dangerous game to play and it's really sad that it is that way."

unpopularopinion,fcr1ptz,t3_eii2h4,1577895492.0,"This is unpopular. I don't agree. Take my upvote. 

However, PewDiePie has been on the platform for years. He's just that legendary person that defied all odds and thats why people like him. I have always liked him but I do agree his videos the past couple years haven't really been great and I've stopped watching him."

toxicparents,fcmgbuy,t1_fcm2l6x,1577774197.0,"What do you expect from a kid who has grown up their entire life with a toxic parent? You know,the one that's supposed to *parent* you and *teach* you things? Obviously some of those traits will rub off... That's what happens. 

OP, I understand why you have acted the way you have and I don't really blame you. My mother had toxic parents... She's been toxic to me growing up... And I've learned over the years that unfortunately her habits have rubbed off on me. You're 14 too, god forbid you make mistakes. I'm sure this idiot commenting has done a lot worse than you or equally as bad of things as a kid.

 Take care of yourself. Toxic parents are the absolute worst and it's so hard dealing with this type of stuff. I'm rooting for you. Hopefully you can move in with your dad soon. Much love."
