rarepuppers,ff4d1ui,t1_ff4bq27,1579560740.0,"We went through a breeder for our third dog. We adopted two and one was aggressive towards humans and dogs and one just against dogs. We had to put the aggressive one at humans down and it hurt me so bad. I was and still am upset over the situation. We bought a goldendoodle and he is the most gentle and loving dog. We are training him to be a therapy dog. As long as you shop and find a trusted and reputable breeder, it’s ok"
dogs,fey1gu2,t3_eqohkm,1579439555.0,My dog will eat stuffing out of toys so his poop is just cotton wrapped around poop.
AskWomen,fep86tb,t3_eq2kln,1579314313.0,A hot tub. I freeze at night and that sounds like heaven.
offmychest,feigqeu,t3_ep9t84,1579138143.0,"I’m not saying this will help but I’m a male and chest size does not matter. I fall in love with someone’s personality, not those kind of features. I obviously can’t understand what you feel but it doesn’t matter to everyone."
offmychest,fe3gvwd,t3_enknog,1578849128.0,Hopefully this never happens again but if it does tell the cash register employee. They can call security and the cops who will investigate and keep you safe. Glad you are ok.
aww,fe2ae03,t3_enk42v,1578836261.0,I had one of those for more than 20 years. They haven’t changed much.

I’ve Been in hospitals for two weeks at a time my whole life and I would love it when they came by."
CysticFibrosis,fcvo8ha,t3_ej0x5b,1578006375.0,I used to hate chocolate and some other foods that I now love. I have heard of a woman getting a transplant and after she craved wings and beer but before she never had either. The donor used to go out every weekend for wings and beers.
AnimalsBeingDerps,fcs2jou,t1_fcq0vtk,1577910503.0,Yes but if the other animal doesn’t stop when the dog growls or shows teeth the next step is usually a snap or bite. My dogs may growl if another wants the same toy but my dog walks away. If he didn’t walk away and still try to get the toy he would bite him. If the cat doesn’t learn that growling is a warning and gets closer or keeps coming at it the dog will most like snap or bite.
AnimalsBeingDerps,fcov7gv,t1_fconhxq,1577842471.0,Looks like the dog is resource guarding the hat. As the cat gets closer he shows his teeth. If they don’t address this the dog will bite the cat.
offmychest,fcjwmxb,t1_fciyl6k,1577708270.0,I’m not trying to be an ass because I really don’t know. If he does have a concussion wouldn’t the doctor just say take it easy and don’t do physical activities for awhile? So if he is already relaxing wouldn’t it not matter since there is no treatment for concussions?
AdviceAnimals,fcatp4y,t3_egspen,1577576410.0,I have a Mac. Have you seen the password they suggest? I need a password I can remember when on other devices. I can’t remember jrhfhHir4847jd!??a
aww,fcata1c,t3_egwg31,1577576175.0,"People will yell at you for this photo too. Letting him hug the dog. Every dog is different, some likes hugs and some don’t. Very cute pic by the way."
confession,fcadxkm,t1_fc9jiqq,1577567589.0,At least the school did something about it.
confession,fc1aicr,t1_fc15mgh,1577312967.0,That’s how it should be. What good is therapy if you can’t tell them the true issues because they are sharing it with someone else. Nothing will get resolved as long as that happens
