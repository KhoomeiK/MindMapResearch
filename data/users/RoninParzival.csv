depression,fdih1n5,t3_eleyhh,1578442735.0,"I’m almost 50 and I can tell you all that it does not stop. Meds help. Therapy. Forcing yourself to get up and fight. Major Depression is a real deal and terrifying to boot bc as you all know, most of the time the people we cry out for help usually don’t have the ability to understand. I understand. I know where you’re at. I’ve been there many times so I don’t want anyone taking what I’m about to say out of context...
You can choose to fight. 
Yell. Scream. Break something. (Try not to go jail-I’ve been there too). Dig deep within yourself and find your Monster (he/she is in there) and set that Monster free. 
Find your strength- your courage- all your rage and MOVE. Your disease thrives on complacency. 
MOVE and feel the quiet stir in your chest grow into a nuclear explosion and put yourself into attack mode. 
Take shit from NO ONE!!!
MOVE. 
Keep Moving."
depression,fdcxhsf,t1_fdcqz3q,1578287212.0,Yes. This is textbook Major Depression.
depression,fdcxbdz,t3_ekluv2,1578287056.0,Ya. I’m back on my meds now too. Forcing myself to get up and do stuff. I coming out of this one. This episode actually started weeks ago and I’m coming out of it.
depression,fd7a6q0,t1_fd6lkk7,1578201462.0,Ya....I do.
depression,fd79u5j,t1_fd5n7yn,1578201322.0,I'm in a major depressive episode right now and my mom blamed it on me... On the same day someone (an aquantence) told me I was thinking myself into depression. I told my mom to google Major Depression and read about it and she refused.
depression,fd789cn,t3_ejx4cu,1578200725.0,"I don't even try to explain it to people anymore. Don't even mention when I'm in that kind of pain (which I'm.in now). I've lived with this for a long time I can tough it out a few more decades...then it'll be over. 
Tell em that and watch their reaction."
depression,fd11uu4,t1_fd0x6o1,1578126633.0,"Remember that Major Depression is not normal depression. Major Depression makes depression feel like sunshine and roses. 
Good luck."
depression,fd0w6ly,t1_fczkjf8,1578124585.0,"Sounds like me. Severe depression (actually called Major Depression) and severe anxiety/panic attacks. I go through the same feelings and for me they can be intense and last for weeks. When I'm like that what's going on in my head plus the actual physiological symptoms in my body, stomach aches, headaches, etc. make it actually physically impossible to have a conversation with someone. I really don't even want people around me. But I do appreciate it to know that someone actually cared enough about me too attempt to wanna be around me. 
I suggest you call him. If he's like me he won't answer so leave a message...""Miss you, thinking of you, how are you"". But avoid messages like ""you need help and you need to check into the hospital, etc.""
Eventually he'll call you back and then you just talk. Study up on Major Depression, not to lecture but when he is finally ready to talk about getting help he knows you've been caring enough to inform yourself. 
Major Depression is no joke. I wish someone cared about mine when I was younger."
depression,fczp3ya,t1_fczkv8l,1578106083.0,Actually I’m thinking you got some serious problems of your own. Your comments (and the fact that you take the time even leaving them) are strongly suggestive of severe Anti-Social Personality Disorder and a narcissistic personality disorder.

addiction,fczey2b,t3_eix4t1,1578099723.0,"Alcoholics/addicts absolutely have to come to the conclusion that using/drinking is causing most of the suffering in their lives and that they need help to abstain. It’s hard enough for normal addicts. People that have a depression issue as well (like myself and your husband) have it even harder. AA meetings, rehabs, therapy, meds... I’ve been to all of them myself. They helped only once I admitted that I needed that help. 
This isn’t a one-and-done deal. Recovery is a life long process which often includes relapse and lots of ups and downs. It is possible but not likely that you’re husband will quit drinking and likely back on dope within a month. 
I wish I could give you more positive advice but I’ve been trying to get sober for thirty years. Some success... lots of failure and hardship over the years and LOTS of depression. See... alcohol and drugs relieved my depression (which was so bad I would drink or use knowing full well what the consequences might be. Eventually I would have to quit and at that point the depression became overwhelming. I had to admit that I had issues with depression and now I see a doctor and take antidepressants. I go to meetings. I’m still not feeling “great” but I’m better. Point is I had to make the decision to get help; I had to admit that I needed it. 
If you’re serious about staying with him know this. It will be difficult for him. And for you."
addiction,fcvhaoa,t1_fcvb7e6,1578002075.0,"These forums are usually not very productive. My advice is this There are alcoholics and there are drug addicts. And there are alcoholic/addicts. Your husband drinks like an addict and I’m guessing, like me, he’s drinking and using because of a depressive condition. Get him to a psychiatrist and go with him. Meds helped me a lot but AA helped too. Addiction is a long uphill battle so be ready for lots of drama and yes...more depression."
addiction,fcvdu5l,t1_fcv3pqp,1578000023.0,"Just because it’s a convenient way for your drug addled brain to comprehend depression doesn’t make it correct. Situational depression, the opposite of whatever you call endogenous (what is actually called “Organic” Depression) is very real and the cause of most “depression”.  But is not really all that severe and tends to pass quickly- the situation (addiction) causes the depression. Unlike “organic depression” which has a neuro-chemica-biological origin and does not have an addictive element.  
But if your ground-breaking new depression research proves me wrong post it."
