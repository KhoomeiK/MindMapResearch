TheLeftovers,ffirveq,t1_ffhj3k9,1579981154.0,"Your situation sounds very similar to mine. My wife tried watching the series when it first came out. She quit after 2 episodes saying what other have pointed out, too depressing, etc. A couple months ago, I was curious about all the buzz, especially after listening to some podcasts from the **Bald Move** guys who raved about it so I decided to watch. I power through the first few episodes really not ""getting it"" and saying so to my wife. Finishing episode 5, I told her, ""I think there is something here."" After episode 6, I said to her, ""if the series stays on this trajectory, it's going to be extraordinary (Holy Wayne/Nora scene). Then episodes by episode went by, the acting, writing and directing with scenes like Holy Wayne/Kevin, Matt and Kevin in the diner, Nora waking up to see her ""family"" came rushing at me. I was shaken from what I was experiencing.

Long story short, I finished season 3 and was going to rewatch to catch what I missed. I asked my wife to seriously consider joining me. I told her, ""The Leftovers is an experience unlike any other. I feel changed and deeply moved . . . it is art in its highest form."" She did and we wept. We were shaken and speechless. We're moved by the scenes many of you have described and seem to be universally experienced such as Nora crying in the hotel room in Australia with what seems like rivers of tears being released from her.

The Leftovers is an experience to go through and wonderful to share. It is rare to find something that can communicate on such a personal/human level sometimes using only images and expressions (the scene in Lens). 

Yes, the **Bald Move** guys are terrific. After listening to their Leftovers podcast, I signed up to become **Bald Move** member. These guys are knowledgeable, authentic, nerdy (in a complementary way) and funny. Good chemistry too. On one of their Westworld podcasts, A. Ron out of the blue asked Jim ""if he were at Westworld, would he 'do a prospector' just for the experience?""

The **Bald Move** guys are worth a listen and seem to have a very diverse audience from all around the globe."

My little girl Sophie was a MC tabby and I can totally understand. They seem to be especially in tune with their human parent which makes the bond even more special. Hope your grieving passes soon, replaced by all the good times you’ve shared."
DrugNerds,ff488yv,t1_ff3qwb6,1579557687.0,"Best wishes on getting off Klonopin. I was on it longer and it took me what seemed like forever to get off. Even with itty bitty steps, I could feel the impact of slowly tapering down. I was on timed release morphine and for me, the Klonopin was much harder."
TheLeftovers,fepbhhl,t1_fen89r3,1579316468.0,"I have to agree with your sentiments regarding the Nora/Holy Wayne scene. It was heartbreaking and hopefully, just a very, very human moment with little dialogue just to punctuate the exchange. It’s one of the many, many scenes in The Leftovers that stays with me like Velcro"
cats,fejfg3h,t3_epe6yb,1579171621.0,Congrats. It looks like he made a wise choice.  Enjoy
KingCrimson,fef05ir,t3_eoswo0,1579045080.0,"I don’t know but there seems to be a growing list of KC box sets that have been put out. 

FWIW, I have 2 KC box sets, “Frame by Frame” and “The Great Deceiver.” FbF is a sample of each main version of KC with the last CD consisting of live performances. FbF stops at the Bruford era. “

The Great Deceiver” are 4 CDs of all live performances during the Wetton/Bruford era so there are several versions of Easy Money, Starless, etc. I think Deceiver is out of print, don’t know about FbF."
sports,feddo8l,t1_feabwa8,1579008602.0,"Yeah, I saw thanks. Initially read the headlines and thought the penalty was light. Once I clicked onto the story, I saw the full extent."
sports,feci2gp,t1_feasmne,1578974432.0,"FWIW, I watched on the MLB network former GM Dan O’Dowd comment. He called the loss of draft picks devastating from a front office perspective. I would have like to seen another year of picks tacked on. The MLB panel hinted that Alex Cora is next and the hammer is gonna fall on his head. Cheated/got caught with 2 teams, Houston and Boston."
