In my experience, the Robinson family and their friends retired, the kids went away to college, and there's no one left to run the farm because the kids aren't moving back home. 
No one took them out. I know this isn't as exciting a narrative, but I live in Montana and is exactly what I have observed for 40 years here. The land needs to be worked to produce the crops, so, a handful of young farmers start buying up their neighbors when they sell at auction. Soon, they're running 4 or 5 farms, totaling 10s of thousands of acres of farmland, and they're a ""big corporation.""
