My nickname is Duddy. My middle name is Dustin and a lot of people called me “Dusty” when I was growing up.

I never was a popular kid but I had made friends with one of the “cool kids” in my class in 6th grade. I was late to school because of a doctors appointment. 

When I walked in, that friend tried to say “Hey Dusty’s here!” But accidentally said “Hey Duddy’s here!” And it stuck. From then on, I was Duddy. It made me feel like I belonged which was rare for me so it meant a lot to me.

Hence my username/Steam name/gamer tag"

They purposely did so because she was wearing a t-shirt with the department logo on it.

Turns out that my mom dug a dead new born baby out of a toilet that day. The mom drowned the baby because “she didn’t know she was pregnant and just had to pee really badly”.

A couple days before that, she had to take pictures of a car accident that was incredibly gruesome.

A couple weeks before that, she was shot at by a drug dealer who didn’t want to get caught.
