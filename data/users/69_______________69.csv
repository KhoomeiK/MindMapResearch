Congratulations, you are the talk of the climate-world. You are the new denier, you the pseudo-intellectual. 

The ""Big Brain, I understand Science"" and then throw out statements like:

>""Also if the atmosphere is changing, they can’t predict the future accurately based on past meteorogical results, since their variables are different. They are not even aware of those variables as meteorologists.""

....................................c'mon.......... like this is such a shitty statement in a sea of shit from you lol 

My favorite line of yours though was:

>For example if you’re a geologist, you have to also be a chemist, biologist, meteorologist and physicist to be able to generate anything of value,

ahaha like what? 

Just admit it, you don't get science. Its tough, but the first step is admitting you don't get it"

like this whole paragraph:

>Even if you run your study and it’s correct for example in Australia, then again you have to do the same for all other countries in the world and calculate the global average. It’s pretty much a nightmare to reach a provable conclusion, which is why there are still so many deniers around

its almost too much to unpack. you muddle climate science and climate modeling, while somehow giving an absolutely terrible explanation of them. then you throw out this gem ""its pretty much a nightmare to reach a provable conclusion"" (whaaaaaaaaaaaaat...?) ""which is why there are still so many deniers around"" boy you sure sound like one of 'em"

The emissions are, in economic terms, a social cost. A social cost is an externality pushed onto consumers and not paid by the producer or manufacturer.
