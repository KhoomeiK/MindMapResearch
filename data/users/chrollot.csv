SuicideWatch,fcz5fns,t3_ejjdgq,1578094039.0,Hey bro. Maybe go somewhere else other than usa? There are many countries who arent so competitive and who are very open and friendly! Good luck

SuicideWatch,fcl2odj,t1_fckgdi6,1577738494.0,Dude maybe satisfaction will come to you if you live your life without lying to anyone and hiding anything. Just say your thoughts in a positive manner and say no when you don't want to. That shit will seriously empower you. To live expressing yourself fully at your capacity.
SuicideWatch,fcl2hcn,t1_fck3rle,1577738375.0,I think most of the members of this sub are overthinkers. And if not pushed in the right way it opens the door to depression and anxiety. So guys pls overthink in a healthy way and in not some self degrading ways. Happy new year ya all!
