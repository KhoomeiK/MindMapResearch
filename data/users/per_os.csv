I get some goodies from the gettin' place, and leave for another smallish military place in the south, and aggro some zombies, and then some more, and some more, i must have killed 20 or more, and then i started running out of ammo (though really i just panicked, i still had a couple mags left) but I switched to my shovel, and eventually i was overrun.
