breakingmom,fcsnfwl,t1_fcr6gtn,1577920368.0,"My son has ADHD and we had issues with outbursts when he was 6.  The principle called me at least every week because he punched a kid or threw himself into the bleachers.  Every time I asked “Why?” It was “I don’t know.”  I put off medication for 2 years because the whole world made me feel guilty about the idea.  There is so much stigma to battle!  Finally, we tried medication and it was like a switch was flipped.  I had my boy back.  We did a year of therapy as well and he is such a kind, well adjusted, thoughtful child.  He’s not a zombie or whatever people believe will happen.  We talk with him about his treatment as well.  He’s included in his own mental health management because ultimately it will be his responsibility his whole life.  Anyway...rambling..."

bipolar,fcnye1t,t3_ei6vl4,1577820841.0,"For me personally:

YES!  I have to take my medication.  I may feel fine for a while, but any stable period will not last.  And the come down is debilitating.

And, yes, I think treatment has helped in giving me more direction and purpose, but it didn’t fix everything you know?"
survivinginfidelity,fcnohiw,t3_ehy24e,1577815393.0,"Reading this upset my stomach it’s so awful.  I’m so sorry for all you are going through!  Your feelings are valid, but that doesn’t make it easier to cope with.  Are you seeing a therapist individually?"
quilting,fcluyrh,t3_ehuao9,1577757099.0,So beautiful!  I LOVE this!
survivinginfidelity,fcluuff,t1_fclubux,1577757016.0,"You are very welcome.  It was huge for me.  I felt like I was losing my mind for years and suddenly there was a whole book written about what I was going through with the tone, language, and frankness I needed.  I really hope it helps you as much as it helped me."
quilting,fckvbm2,t1_fcku7z5,1577733976.0,I had a big bag I just threw them in and ironed as I went.
bipolar,fckphxl,t3_ehf1u4,1577730386.0,Ha!  Amazing.  So true.
bipolar,fckpbf1,t3_ehohni,1577730274.0,Wonderful!  It’s progress.  I hope you enjoy it and feel encouraged to do more for yourself.
survivinginfidelity,fckp58b,t3_ehhsg1,1577730169.0,"My husband also tried to blame me and held anger towards me for ridiculous things.  It was so awful.  I’m so sorry for what you’re going through.  I read a great book, “Leave a Cheater, Gain a Life” by Tracy Schon.  It is very validating and helps sort through all the mindf&&king that occurs with infidelity.  I wish you all the best."
