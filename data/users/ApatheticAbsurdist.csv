But there's a few things you can try regarding GPU:

1) In Lightroom under preferences under performance check the GPU settings and make sure it's your Radeon GPU and not the intel one... if it's intel quit LR and then confirm you're set to use the dedicated GPU: [https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202053](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202053) and  [https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202043](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202043) you may want to try forcing the system to only use the higher end GPU back in LR to take advantage of the GPU update, auto might work but it's probably better to set it to set it to custom and check both to use it for display and for processing.

2) Depends on the flight you were on. The flight itself being at 30,000 ft you're in thinner atmosphere and exposed to more high energy rays and a longer flight can be similar to having an extra x-ray, so it is cumulative but not just the xray machines you put it through... a trans atlantic flight adds some extra exposure

3) In the article, this is specifically about CT (computed tomography) scanners which put out a bit more exposure than a regular xray.... a single CT scan scans from multiple angles to create a 3D model, and that leads to extra exposure so Kodak is saying you likely will notice even on lower ISOs"

photography,fftodwi,t3_ev4plu,1580225572.0,"General rule of thumb (and keep in mind a ""rule of thumb"" is not a great thing when dealing with the complexity of copyright, but it's the best we have). Most works prior to 1922-ish usually are not in copyright in most of the world. There are some weird exceptions like if an artist served in the French army in WWI, they might have an extra extension on their copyright. Also sometimes we find out a work was made after the date we initially thought it was. As others have said copyright varies by country, but if the artist who made the work died before 1922, I'm usually pretty confident the work is public domain in nearly all countries. 

Now that said there are layers of copyright. If you're looking at a historical photograph (which I assume is a print on paper or something) on your computer screen... well someone photographed that photo. And that 2nd photo might have a copyright to it self. If yesterday I made a sculpture (which would be under my copyright) and then you photographed it today (the image would be under you copyright)... neither of us could publish or use the image for profit without licensing the other's copyright. You need to have the rights for both the original work and the image.

Now that said... in a decision made by the southern district of New York state court in a case known as ""Bridgeman v Corel"" they found that a photograph of a 2D work (another photograph or painting) is a ""slavish copy"" and not a creative or skilled act that imbues copyright. This is not law, but it set a legal precedent. There are many who disagree with this finding (I have some issue with it myself as no 2D object is truly 2D and having photographed a large number of paintings in my lifetime I assure you it does take skill and creativity to capture the appearance and texture).

Basically you can claim copyright on anything, whether that copyright will hold up in court is another story but you and and someone else will both have to be willing to fight it out in court to find out. Now that said, even if I take a photo and I don't want to claim copyright or the courts say ""that is a 'slavish copy' and has no copyright"" that doesn't mean I have to give it to you. Even without copyright can hold on to the file unless you pay me a fee to deliver the file or something. Of course now if we did work out an agreement that I gave you the file, unless our agreement had some kind of contract that specifically prevented you from sharing it, there's nothing from keeping you from sharing (or even trying to re-sell) that non-copyrighted image.

Why build a new hospital? Well because Wuhan has grown substantially in size over the past 10 years (from 2010 to 2018 they went from 7.3 million to over 11 million and probably even larger today) and they're pretty far behind in terms of building out hospitals. So using an emergency like this is an excuse for the government to claim land and build out a new facility. China is a master in the world of eminent domain."

Even today we're talking about a a 0.027% chance of having it (much less when people were leaving so the chances were even lower). Then there is a less than 100% transmission rate, so even lower chance you'd give it to your grandmother. And the fatality rate is less than 1%.

Where do you draw the line? On any given day you might have caught the flu which could be dangerous. You should never see your grandmother again. Stick to Skype or phone calls. Because there is a 0.00000001% chance you might have something that could kill her"
personalfinance,ffniy0q,t3_eu8brz,1580066522.0,"Is the commute better or worse? How are the benefits? How is the paid time off situation? Have you gotten seniority benefits having worked for a while that you'd loose by switching jobs?

Eg: Lets say you work at a place that gives  week between Christmas and new years off as holidays in addition to the regular 10 for a total 15 holidays and you've worked there for a while and moved up to 5 weeks off a year vacation... that's 40 paid days off a year (not bringing in sick/personal for this example). If the new job starts at 10 holidays and 3 weeks vacation, that's 25 days. Assuming 260 week days a year. You're going from working 220 days to working 235, or a 6.8% increase in work time. Your 10% raise just became a 3.2% raise.

Now that said, switching jobs can lead to future opportunities. If there's better room for advancement. Or there's just an opportunity to work on some interesting projects to add more resume experience for another move 2-5 years down the road... that can be valuable.

In the end it's a complex question and usually a 10% pay is actually the smallest factor in a job switch."

On a holiday that basically fills in for Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years, and Birthdays (yeah in china, once you're not a kid birthdays aren't really celebrated except for like your 64th and 88th).

Happened to me when I was younger. Problem was I didn't realize it at the time, and I continued to put on a little bit more weight than I needed. I probably needed to put on 20 lbs from where I was at 19, but I overshot by about 25lbs. I should have got into better habits of working out or watching what I eat (growing up I could eat anything, not really work out and still looked malnourished).

Something that is 2.5' long is going to use a crap ton of material (and a lot of filling material as most affordable 3D printers cannot print a flat roof over an empty void, so you have to print a lot of fill to have something to print the top on), it's going to weeks (yes, weeks) to print.
