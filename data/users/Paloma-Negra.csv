depression_help,fdhfoed,t3_elbixb,1578421659.0,Hi I understand how you feel. When I first started with Therapy last year and being on medication i was ashamed I thought there was something wrong with me. My therapist told me it's not a sign of weakness to be on medication for clinical depression. She told me if I had another illness like diabetes I will be on medication which is necessary and that doesn't make me weak. It really helped me because although depression cannot be seen and understood by everybody it is real and if medication helps to manage it I will continue taking them. You are not weak because you are on medication you need them it's not your fault don't beat yourself up. You are strong because admitting that you are ill is a sign of strength and not weakness.

depression_help,fdfcm7x,t3_el2gbm,1578358535.0,I am so sorry that you feel that way. And it's normal when you are depressed I felt the same way before starting therapy last year. And I was avoiding every human contact and decided to be lonely but I just couldn't stand it. It's a good thing you are stating therapy next week and I am sure people will be lucky to have you as friends. Don't let your loneliness get to your mind and make you feel worthless you are worthy and your life is not over. You didn't waste time life if not a race and we are different it takes long a way for other people for others it comes so fast. I will like to be your friend
depression,fdcabq6,t3_ekfp0m,1578270246.0,It's not only you. In fact when i first went to therapy they told me that the first sign of clinical depression is sleeping so much. I use to sleep at 7pm and wake up either at 10 or 12. I use to contemplate sleeping that was the only thing that made me feel good. All i wanted to do was to sleep because being awake was torture. Hopefully after a full year of therapy and medication I now enjoy being awake most of the time it's still really hard I go to bed at 10 instead of 7. It's a little victory for me. You are not alone
depression_help,fcue042,t3_eiuywi,1577978728.0,Hello I totally understand what you feel that feeling of drowning under everything. And nobody understands you because they think you are just making excuses. I know nothing i'll tell you  will make you feel better. But hang in there you are strong and you can make it. It's okay to call in sick if you are not feeling good. But depression is something so difficult to explain especially to people who don't feel the same way as you do. Do what makes you feel good help yourself because no one will save yourself do it for you because you are worth it. Stay strong for yourself  and hang in there you will have better days. It's normal to completely shut down it happens especially when you are depressed but you are strong and you will always Bounce back. I will keep you in my prayers.
