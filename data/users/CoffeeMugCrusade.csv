again, why not go for it and potentially hit the car? it's a dream so no one will actually get hurt, perhaps the confrontation is what needs to happen to finally end the dream. maybe there's some symbolism here too. is there perhaps another person you're afraid would be negatively affected if you stopped your metaphorical eternal roundabout?"

maybe next time the dream happens just say fuck it and drive out, even if it feels like there's no way you'll survive. i mean either you'll safely get out or you'll crash and just wake up. either way after you do one of those you'll probably never have the dream again."

fun facts u didn't ask for: lewis carroll (author of Alice in wonderland) liked to eat amanita muscaria mushrooms which, unlike the usual mushrooms people use to get high that cause psychedelic hallucinations, amanitas induce delirium, which causes sizes and distances to distort. this likely inspired some events in Alice in wonderland, if you recall she'd drink potions to make her wildly shrink and grow, she'd be approaching things and they'd get huge the closer she got, or they'd keep getting farther and seem unreachable. interesting that fever dreams seem to induce similar visual effects to delirium."
