Also, getting real tired of being called a ""person of color"" and having white liberals speak for me. Just because I'm not a straight white male, doesn't make me the other, and doesn't mean you should lump me in with people who aren't like me so that you can virtue signal. I'm Haitian. Quite different from a Jamaican, from someone born in Africa, not a latino, not southeast Asian. 

Not sure about how other people feel about the term, but I feel like using it is using me and people like me as a club to beat straight white men over the head, and doing so diminishes my identity as someone other than this generic group of \*not white\* people."
Libertarian,fem8sda,t1_fem0vsw,1579243946.0,"I did NOT lie, unless my purpose is to intentionally mislead someone. If they did something different, the way you claim, then I could have had the wrong information, or a lack of information, but that's not the same as having a set of information and willingly attempting to manipulate someone into believing something I know is untrue. 

I'm more than happy to be proven wrong, because it means I've learned something, which I have in this case. I thought something, and I was mistaken. I know now more than I knew before, and I know now what type of questions to ask or what to look for, and how better to frame it, so I can walk away from this dumpster fire a better man than I was when I walked in.

If you want to label me a liar, that's your opinion, and you're more than welcome to it."
Libertarian,felz0fc,t1_felgy7h,1579234599.0,"Where did I say I thought Biden set public policy? 

I'm simply asking what the difference was that Trump is in the wrong, and why  Biden wasn't. Is that not a fair question to ask? I'm not claiming to have any answers the way people think that I for some reason think I do. 

But you know what? I'm explaining myself to someone putting words in my mouth. What do I even really care about your opinion, when you can't seem to be bothered to get a straight account of what I wrote?"
Libertarian,felxuod,t1_fel9mw7,1579233688.0,"Ok so there wasn't a video where Biden admitted to withholding the money from Ukraine? Because I remember that video. If Trump with holding money is illegal, then all I'm asking for is what the difference was between that situation and what Trump did.

Here's the funny part, I'm trying to get information not using the mainstream media, yet everytime I ask a question, all anyone can say is that I watch Fox news, or cnn, or I'm anti this or that. Spreading fake news is asking a question to educate yourself. Good to know."

Libertarian,feksbde,t1_fekqo78,1579206575.0,"How am I spreading bs? 

I just asked a question. Are you that small that you can't even handle a question being asked with out turning this mad?

Can you explain to me why one situation is propel and the other isn't? 
Nah, you can't because if you could, you'd have typed something more valuable. Does your mommy know you swear online?  Bad person!"
Libertarian,fekn1lw,t1_fejzy6s,1579203457.0,"I don't watch fox or cnn.

I did see a youtube clip where Biden admitted to doing the same thing that Trump was accused of doing, and just wanted to know what the difference was. Now I know, thank you for assuming that I watch Fox, but you don't know much about me, so I'll let that slide."

nba,fd0ob8d,t3_ejq555,1578121564.0,"Why not just take the win? Why the lack of sportsmanship? Especially given that Marcus Smart not too long ago had that eye infection and thought that he was going to end up going blind. You should be thanking God that you even made it back to the basketball court, so what did you have to gain by doing this?"

facepalm,fbzs339,t1_fbznmfe,1577258620.0,"Compared to other countries, yes, we're quite forgiving of obesity, and it's killing people. I see it everywhere, from salons that install chairs capable of supporting women up to nearly 1000 pounds, to models like Tess Holiday walking the runway as a model. There was that fat acceptance activist who died of some weight related health complications not long after giving a TedX talk about fat acceptance. 

I don't study the movement enough to know how widespread it is, I'll give you that, but at the same time I'm not going to bury my head in the sand and pretend that America, the only nation that I can really speak for since I'm a born and raised American, doesn't have an problem at all with obesity, and the fact that we're not really addressing it the way we should be, forming lifelong healthy habits in children that they can mature with into adulthood, I'd say we live in a society that's more than complicit with seeing obese people walk around (or be carted around in scooters since they're too fat to move on their own).

There are far too many people in this country that are obese or bordering on that, and we need to make a change, a myriad of changes, but if you'd rather focus on reddit and twitter, and what you can see online, as if what you being online and can see personally somehow negates the fact that it exists at all and shouldn't, then I don't have much else to say to you."
facepalm,fbz5mmz,t3_ef7seu,1577235809.0,"At some point this whole fat acceptance thing needs to end. I know this is an unpopular opinion, but real talk, we're not doing these fat people any favors by trying to downplay the impact that their weight is having on their lives. No, it isn't healthy. You may not necessarily have any health related complications at the moment, but an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.

Why wait until your weight does develop problems for you, like diabeetus or hypertension, before you decide that now is the time to do something about your weight? How much damage can we prevent to your body, or your very way of life, if we simply encourage you eat right and exercise just a little bit? No one is trying to hurt your feelings, no one is trying to say that they're better than you because they weight less than you, but they're making the effort to look long term down the road and prevent this from being something that keeps you from living your life later on down the road.

If you don't like the word obese, it's because you're obese and you don't like yourself for it. Do something about your weight, because I'm getting real sick of everyone else pretending that you eating yourself to an early grave is something that's so stunning and brave. Unless there's some legit medical complication where it's nearly physically impossible for you to lose any weight, and you've tried absolutely everything, then you're choosing a lifestyle and it's not a healthy one at all. You don't get to dictate what everyone else calls that, purely because you're upset at yourself."
