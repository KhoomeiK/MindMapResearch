BlackDesertMobile,ffcriv6,t1_ffcpx8h,1579805772.0,I would 100% spend 1k coins for all purple +.... I spend 5k coins and get like 5 purples and 0 yellows sometimes 1 yellow
BlackDesertMobile,ffcrddx,t1_ffcgl7x,1579805678.0,I think he means like he doesn’t buy the coins to spend them? Idk cause it’s not really gambling when you get the coins without spending money
2007scape,ffcr9p6,t1_ffcq9w6,1579805616.0,"I am calm, I was more discounting that 150k/hr was correct.. it’s more 150k at the most"
2007scape,ffcjtz4,t1_ffcjgxp,1579800989.0,"I guess it just comes from experience, I’ve spent a lot of time there"
2007scape,ffcjr9w,t1_ffcigjw,1579800943.0,"It is how it works, I’ve gone multiple hours at Ogres without rune drops, and some where I get 3-4 rune drops.

It’s not consistent and to think you can get 150k per hour consistently at Ogres is ridiculous. I’ve gotten up to 150k for sure, but I’ve also gotten 60-80k"
2007scape,ffcif19,t1_ffcggjj,1579800134.0,"Yeah that’s true, even if it’s for 30 minutes to an hour I’d be happy lol"
2007scape,ffcg9nd,t1_ffcg551,1579798814.0,"Yeah exactly, the grind portion of this game can be a little too tedious for me, so if I was passively watching something I could definitely grind out more passive skills like woodcutting or fishing and things like that 

And what do you mean it’s not perfect? Just curious what it looks like"
2007scape,ffcfp4u,t1_ffcds43,1579798466.0,A floating screen? I just want to be able to click both with ease

2007scape,ffcfkn1,t1_ffce21u,1579798389.0,"Well yeah of course you pick up the runes and gems, but if you don’t get any rune drops for that hour it brings down your k/hr by quite a bit"
BlackDesertMobile,ffccrn2,t1_ffcbggy,1579796652.0,Crafting outfits isn’t great because the amount of materials it requires and it takes 3 days to finish. Also 30+ is just days and days of grinding for stones... if he’s not at the wall already I don’t wanna know what 3600 is gonna be like for him
BlackDesertMobile,ffccmhb,t3_esv8z1,1579796563.0,Like the 20 classes :(
2007scape,ffccket,t1_ffcb9bx,1579796527.0,"Unfortunately lol... you get about 100k every few hours... sometimes 100k in 1 hour if you get a few rune drops in a row, but this doesn’t happen a lot"

Gebs is only his ult but that still works I guess

I guess I can’t find the Ares % based damage in his kit? I see he does damage based on his magical power? But that’s not really what I was looking for

I do see KA has percentage based damage in his ult as well...

I guess I was just looking for primary abilities that had this, looks like Serqet might be the best at it"

FortniteCompetitive,fengg1p,t1_feng2ho,1579284150.0,I’m saying the good player will destroy him everytime if he has traps bud
FortniteCompetitive,fen9rde,t1_femodz4,1579280053.0,"Let me give you a good example... 

You get a really bad player, and a really good player. You give the really good player a bunch of traps and the bad player the best guns in the game, the good player will kill that bad player EVERY single time because traps are OP.

Now give them both the same weapons, the good player has to actually focus because as a first person shooter, you have to actually land your shots without them Landon’s their shots... traps are a confirmed hit if they’re in your box AND for 150... shotguns sometimes don’t even hit for that"
BlackDesertMobile,fen9g3s,t1_fem4t0y,1579279860.0,YeH the 25 helps you a lot I’m not even 23

BlackDesertMobile,fekt1xi,t1_fekjh0q,1579207010.0,"I didn’t spend anything on any of my armor or weapons, everything I have is from shakatu or field drops... with a few yellows from the market...

I honestly bought pearls for the cool outfit and the cool staff ( that you can see equipped) so honestly I am still f2p, just I like to buy cosmetics and they really don’t make a difference... because as you can see I have an outfit that gave the same CP bonus as the outfit I have on but it just looks better"

BlackDesertMobile,feksi1p,t1_fekgjjo,1579206683.0,"Well you get bonuses at 23 and 25 and I haven’t hit either of those tiers yet.. I’ll get there soon! Also my gems are all purple rather than yellow so I have ways to go on that too...

And nah my knowledge is pretty good"
BlackDesertMobile,feks6zv,t1_fekeuk6,1579206504.0,I know I’m working towards that now! I keep almost getting there and then I get an orange drop and I have to get that item back up an enhancement level or 2
BlackDesertMobile,feks38m,t1_feko24d,1579206444.0,Yeah because I haven’t maxed and my enhancements are still low
BlackDesertMobile,fekrzub,t1_fekbv01,1579206387.0,I actually haven’t bought any oranges with silver... I’ve gotten them either through ground drops when I log back in from BSM or I got them through shakatu!
