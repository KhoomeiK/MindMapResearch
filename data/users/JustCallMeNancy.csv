insaneparents,fff1gxw,t3_et7hv6,1579873088.0,"Honestly I'm all for judging the stupid antivaxers but in this case tamiflu has limited help, if any, and almost always corresponds with just how quickly you have started tamiflu from onset of symptoms.  The Dr.s office I worked at actually gave us a RX for tamiflu before flu season so we could take it As Soon as we suspected we were sick or else it wouldn't work. If he's in the hospital I'm gonna guess it's been more than a few days since this started.  Now, I'm sure all the comments that result from her text will be full of ""omg poison!"" But in this case it's really questionable if tamiflu would help at that point."

Once a week is great after having a kid.  After I had my kid, we maybe averaged twice a month.  I wont even tell you what it is now, after medical issues etc but it's not great and while I want to fox that I'm not worried about my marriage, or my body (of which, is not back to prebaby weight and I had my daughter 8 years ago!) Please don't enable this behavior. He wants his cake and to eat it too.  Studies show children do better when Healthy relationships are modeled, but they do not do well internalizing one sided relationships.  Please don't make them think a broken marriage is normal.  These things are hard to hear but whatever you do, do it for you and take your power back.  If you do it for him, you'll end up losing more of yourself."
raisingkids,ff7m3wc,t1_ff6fqzi,1579652820.0,"Heck when they are old enough to understand how much they messed up, I havent even given multiple chances, just an appropriate fully thought out warning. I've stated things like  ""during this event/period of time you need to behave in this way. This Is your warning, acting in x manner will not be tolerated and you will lose privilege x for x amount of time if you do these things"". Of course, if they do something else entirely that's outside of those specifics you can't follow it, (I don't believe that would be fair) so you do need to know what you're up against. I've found that when im super clear where boundaries are, there's more care not to do those things because my daughter thinks mom must be really, really upset to have those things spelled out so crystal clearly.  But of course, follow through.  And when you go to enforce and they scream ""I swear I won't anymore!!"" The answer is yes, you won't.  Because now you can remember what happened when you did."

They're 100% horrible comments, and likely why all of her children either ghosted her or turned out really messed up.  To her, people are not people, they're something you mold.  In addition, they're a representation of her, and her own insecurities and how she wishes she did that thing she's judging on.  I can only take so much of her (really, it's hard), but at least I know her stupid, oblivious comments are based on her own issues, not me or mine."

And adorable again. Lol. But when I just want to go on a walk without any bullshit, I fight with myself to bring the younger one because that's how he'll learn.  I can't wait until they're older, it'll be so great.  In the meantime though, I'm teaching him new commands so we can bond and he can be less derpy."

I also decided I'd never lose myself in a relationship again. No more dependency, regarding money or on an emotional level.  I've always been a giving person (as I think we women are raised to be), but there's that limit when you know you're being abused or you're just not the 'you' that started this relationship.  I can, many years later, say I stayed true to that.  I'm married (for 10+ years) with a kid and I'm still me.  Not some form of me."

However, I might be ok with removing her punishment for prom, BUT at a Heavy cost.  Serious volunteer work, etc.  If she doesn't agree, it must not be worth That much to her."
InsanePeopleQuora,fdj02sf,t1_fdiyv27,1578455040.0,"Well! I had a human skull in my attic as a child.  It was actually just the top part, not eye sockets or anything. But a family member found it in a river.  Put their hand in the water while canoeing, water was shallow and came up with a skull!  The person took it to a university to see if it was super old or if it should be turned in.  Found out it was super old and from a native American women.  The law is fuzzy on that, since there's no crime or next of kin.  If it was a skull from the last few decades, or whatever, we would have had to turn it in (or at least that's my understanding)  Eventually it was donated, since having a native American skull sit in your attic isn't really helping anything.

Also I could never understand this argument.  Are people's goals not to raise a healthy, functional adult? And surprise!  Adults have sex.

It wasn't immediately recommended by the CDC for my age group (kids 13-20 I believe?), since they were aiming for a population that hadn't been exposed to the virus yet. 
I still could have gotten the vaccine back then but if I was exposed already the vaccine wasn't going to help, and I married my partner at the time so *shrug*.  Still, my 8 year old daughter will be getting the vaccine when she's old enough because it's the responsible thing to do.  

That vaccine got people all crazy when it came out because ""omg my 13 year old isn't going to have sex!!"" And a lot of stupid bs came with it that made parents super non-trusting.  Obviously, 13 year olds age up, and by the time they want to have sex they're not going to just go ""oh wait no, I gotta get a vaccine before we do this!"" Lol"

breakingmom,fcqzzyo,t3_eih9sk,1577894756.0,"It's because you're exhausted and see the dogs as another task.  I got my first dog when my daughter was 5. I could not have handled them  (we got another 2 years later) at least until she was that old.  And honestly I might have waited but for my husband's insisting, but I do agree it was a good time to get one. 

 So I told my coworker about how awesome my dog is, and she's loved animals all her life.  Then, 2 years later, we get our second dog. My boy doggy, he's so annoyingly sweet it's great.  So I tell her all about him going through puppy stages, etc. A few months later she says F it, I'm finally in a house with a fence I'm going to get a dog!  So goes and gets a St. Bernard.  Adorable puppy.  Only, my friend had Just given birth, had a 3 and a 5 year old and a blended family with two additional older children that lived there half time.  You can guess what happened.  The dog wasn't trained.  He wasn't on a schedule since she could not enforce one on the older kids, both parents worked, it was too much.  Once the dog reached it's full height, they looked to re-home it.  My friend confessed to me that she felt horrible but it wasn't going to work since they were so busy.  And she was right.  She gave the dog to a friend that could train it and live happily.  So, even if you have every good intention, sometimes it's hard to see how much time things take up, and what really matters is how you handle the situation.  I'm not saying to give up your dogs at All. Just wait. It'll be ok. It's not like your having a blast changing diapers and it's not going to destroy you - your dogs can wait too."

 I am in stop and go traffic every day from work on a highway, and I've had more than enough people get ""annoyed"" at the flow of traffic or that I'm leaving a short distance between cars since I've been in Many ""oh shit everyone is stopping Now!"" Situations.  There are those, however that think they suddenly invented how to drive in these situations.  Usually they get more and more pissed off that they can't physically pass me (because, too much traffic, and I know where the cars pile up).  If and when they finally get an opening I usually clap for them and smile.
There have been other times I was living in a not so populated area on a highway with literally no one else on the road.  In those situations I stay in the correct lane unless to pass, but more than once I had some truck or larger vehicle come up on my ass.  I was happy to go 70mph (65 speed limit), but apparently that's not good enough for some.  Usually I just start slowing down, as there is ample opportunity to pass.  Once I hit 60 people get the idea, and it's no hard feelings.  I was amazed when I literally got down to 30mph and the idiot was still following me.  I don't know if he was trying to intimidate me, but I had a 45 minute drive ahead of me so he was only wasting his time.  When he passed I gave him a thumbs up and a smile, lol"

But wow, I think you just described my good friend's situation about 5 years ago. She's doing much better now after they got the meds right.  She also needed to come to terms with what she did and accept it, even if she could not control it at the moment. Her husband did exactly what you are doing, but she was ok with it when they sat down and talked about it during a time she wasn't triggered.  It's healthy to recognize the problem, and find coping strategies for your family, while at the same time seeking out meds or therapy to help.

You having it and her really very clearly understanding it like never before. I fixated on that around that time as well, puberty makes things like that super uncomfortable.

It takes me about 30 minutes from southern Loveland to drive in, and about 45 minutes to go home. That's not mentioning major traffic accidents, but I use GPS and travel roads with the least resistance so it's usually not much difference in time. The stop and go traffic is not for everyone, but honestly I love the area around me and I feel it's worth it.  Also, I feel Loveland is a little more progressive than some of the older towns closer to Cincinnati.  I know several gay/lesbian people that live in this general area that also love it, so I assume it's not too bad on that front."

My husband was in the army before I met him and he thought it was stupid for military members, but what he was doing was sick because you just knew he kept going back to avoid his family and live a double life while soaking up the praise for being an asshole.

She came to me at 4 and said ""it's fun to believe that Santa is real, isn't it, Mom?"". I agreed that it was fun to pretend.  Now she's probably at the final age where she'll 'believe' and this next year I'm preparing her for the let down.  She's shown doubt in the whole thing and if she does it when we're alone I usually just say ""huh, that is strange.."" and let it go.  I'm kinda pissed the grandparents put me in this situation but I could have pushed back so I'm not blaming them really. I just remember being very bothered by the lies when I was a kid.
