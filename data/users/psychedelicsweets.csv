BipolarReddit,ffqcyky,t1_ffq9pvt,1580130755.0,Okay! :)
BipolarReddit,ffq9bbz,t1_ffpvt0r,1580126870.0,"Wow, thanks for sharing! What the hell is with your head of service? That's so unprofessional of them to say to you, and I'm so sorry your other psych wouldn't listen to your concerns over what was happening as well, attributing it to drug use when you hadn't used. I'd be just as annoyed by docs ignoring symptoms and you, and forcing you to go private. 

Were you eventually able to be diagnosed and suggested mood stabilizers in private? That's so frustrating when you know what's likely happening but (most) doctors or heads won't even listen to you."
BipolarReddit,ffq8pw2,t1_ffpzx9h,1580126146.0,"Thank you for responding! I'm not visibly manic right now so it might take a bit to find the appropriate diagnosis...there are some things that are off and things that I notice, but would be hard to notice if you didn't know me, I think."
BipolarReddit,ffpzem2,t1_ffpy8uf,1580112213.0,"Just as yours is as well! It might be less publicized, but you losing your life wouldnt be any less tragic."
BipolarReddit,ffpy4lq,t1_ffpx74b,1580110504.0,"I'm not sure if this is because you're having ideation, or wish you could switch pains with them out of empathy....but I dont know man. I wish none of this was happening at all instead."
BipolarReddit,ffpv838,t1_ffpv37r,1580106988.0,"Thanks for responding, and the well wishes and advice. You're right, I'm gonna try and counter act my rumination by thinking of the good. He was doing a lot of good before....well. yes."
BipolarReddit,ffploo6,t1_ffpli05,1580098145.0,"I just really can't believe it. Like, this shit is actually real. I dont believe it anymore than when I tried to when I first heard it today. Such a terrible tragedy, all around."
bipolar,ffpk9am,t1_ffpizjq,1580097073.0,It's exactly that misdiagnosis piece that I'm concerned about. I might see if I can find a someone who specialized in co-morbid disorders.
bipolar,ffpk22c,t1_ffp01mi,1580096927.0,"Thanks for sharing! Oh wow, so it took some outside observations and then a full episode to diagnose. What was it like, when they diagnosed you?"
bipolar,ffpjxdf,t1_ffoem6g,1580096834.0,"Thanks for sharing! That's so good that you came in with some mood charts already; I'm hoping to do that for my visit and I've started tracking them now. Sounds like a lot of consensus from different opinions, and then a lil trial and error experiment that confirmed things. 

I was hoping to just get a second opinion and keep seeing the psych I've been seeing. I hope I can do that."
bipolar,ffnnx23,t1_ffnn1lr,1580068332.0,"Hmmm...I guess that's a fair place to leave it for now. And, you're right, that does mess a kid up well. Brains ARE weird. I guess, if it ain't broke, for now?"
bipolar,ffnk9c6,t1_ffni671,1580067087.0,"Thanks for sharing! Wow, they took a really extensive approach to it, it seems. I hope things have gotten better since then. And, that's sweet your best friend was so understanding about everything, and y'all have that code word about you!"
bipolar,ffnjawm,t1_ffngao2,1580066680.0,"Thank you for sharing! That is really confusing. I'm dealing with the same thing, where my current psychiatrist believes I'm on the spectrum but doesn't like labelling.

That's strange, did that resident confirm with someone else about the BPD traits thing? Have you brought that experience up to your current psych? It feels weird to diagnose 2 things, out of the blue when you don't meet full diagnostic criteria, meanwhile saying the other thing you didn't exactly meet fully was wrong for that same reason. I'm happy that everything's dormant now you're managing well tho! Sounds like whatever it is, it's working."
bipolar,ffnf35h,t1_ffn93j8,1580065156.0,"Thank you for saying that. I feel like, if this extensive interview checks out, I really will listen. I really just want to feel even after all."
bipolar,ffnex61,t3_etx4g0,1580065084.0,"Currently going through this with trying to get healthy, and trying to finish coursework from the fall. Now that the end is somewhat in sight, it's starting (on the work wise). You're not alone."
bipolar,ffndwfa,t3_eu78ma,1580064651.0,"I'm so sorry you're going through this, and wish I could ease even some of the pain. Like others have said, you WILL get through this. You are strong, but it's okay to acknowledge you're also very vulnerable; that doesn't make you weak. That means you need support. 

I think someone mentioned your SO being the carer for your son while you improve. Can you get on some sort of disability status while you recover? Or paid leave from work? Can they get unemployment benefits? Do you have family that can come by and help with your mom, even just your situation? 

You have to put yourself first, because if you don't, your health will get worse. You need to give yourself the greatest chance of recovery, for your health and peace of mind. Can you set up a time to video chat your son every so often? 

I wish I could say better to improve things. I don't know what to say besides, you are very strong, and I'm really wishing you well through this difficult time. You're in my thoughts."
bipolar,ffncm95,t3_eu6wlr,1580064307.0,"I've been trying to not get down on myself for not being able to work as well lately, since I have some schoolwork from fall to finish. Also been watching some documentaries, easing into the days as lazy days and taking it one step at a time. Big difference from waking up annoyed I didn't get up at 6. (Now, if only I can work once awake...)"
bipolar,ffnc1ri,t1_ffmzjmu,1580064176.0,"Ah, that makes sense. 

That's what I'm hoping to do! I just want a diagnostic really; I don't mind the current person treating me now. Hopefully it works out for the both of us!"
bipolar,ffnbkfc,t1_ffnav3c,1580064013.0,"Right, the workload is a lot too! Oh, no, that's terrible! But, expected, the way things are going. 

I like that exercise! I might try that with my psych next."
BipolarReddit,ffnap05,t1_ffnafvc,1580063778.0,Thank you :)
BipolarReddit,ffnajjk,t1_ffna6z0,1580063726.0,I will! Likewise :)
bipolar,ffna8cf,t1_ffn01yf,1580063600.0,"Thank you so much for sharing, and I'm so sorry you've had such a terrible experience: with the illness, doctors not taking you seriously, just all of it. A theme I notice is doctors not believing their patients (yet if you don't tell them something, then you're wrong and 'withholding info'), and your experience in crisis centers sounds terrible. I'm hoping that things get better from here on out, and that you have good supports (including your current gf?) to tide you over."
bipolar,ffn9bm5,t1_ffn0n57,1580063365.0,"Thank you for responding! That does sound like a lot of classic symptoms, from the little I've read. I'm hoping to get this final say so I can confirm I need my meds once and for all, and figure out which ones would make the most sense."
bipolar,ffn8wbt,t1_ffn3i0x,1580063193.0,"Thanks for responding! That's an interesting national take on things. Treatment is the end goal, so I'm glad that what y'all are doing is working for you, even without a former label. The management/way of life way of going about it is what matters most, at the end of the day. (Somehow, it's hard for me do divorce myself from needing a formal diagnosis still.)"
bipolar,ffn80df,t1_ffn4kj1,1580062984.0,"Haha, I gotta try that, if only I liked going to the gym :( Maybe this year will be the year for me!"
BipolarReddit,ffn7wia,t1_ffn3k21,1580062951.0,"That's fair, some alternative forms of therapy might be a good luck through. I don't really know anything about what forms of therapy help best, but I do know that not everything works for everyone. I'm more asexual on average, but I can't imagine not being able to enjoy sex if that's something you always have. You're speaking facts on these med side effects tho, as if dealing with the mental ain't enough, dealing with very physical side effects that deeply affect how we feel is tough. 

That's good that at least your doc is aware of your body dysmorphia and wants to minimize tipping that as much as possible. Is there anything that can be prescribed to counter act the hunger pangs that accompany the weight gainers? I know it's hard cuz they change us metabolically too. As someone who has metabolic issues and big problems with weight, I deeply feel your pain."
bipolar2,ffn0o9w,t1_ffj5lij,1580060764.0,"Yeah, I feel it's probably hard with bipolar because a) the stigma, b) it is a very serious diagnosis and c) the lines between 'fine' and 'good' and 'too good'...they're hard to calibrate, from person to person. How much energy, is too much energy? Some people naturally get involved in project to project and are just high functioning neurotypicals. It's not a 'high' for them, they're fairly healthy, they don't even deal with extended depressive stints if at all. It's hard to judge.

Yeah, some baseline and perspective does help. And having people (online or otherwise) to share those unknowns with is very helpful.

I agree, work with your doc, going cold turkey on meds is NOT a good idea. I'd work with your doc, maybe voice some of your concerns. See where they've outlined why they think you have the disorder; that can help sometimes in confirming some things, putting at ease, or a light blinking and you saying 'I don't quite agree'. 

I'm wishing you luck, and happy I could help any bit. Cheers!

ETA: rest of comment"
bipolar,ffmzjot,t1_ffmjcng,1580060486.0,"Sorry for that :( cycles are tough to break through. It really is! I'm not sure what's going on really, haha."
bipolar,ffmyvxp,t1_ffmu96m,1580060286.0,"No, I didn't mean to make you feel any way about what you've gone through! If anything, I feel like my experiences are 'less; which is why I'm looking for a firm diagnosis. Though, it sounds like it'd be an engaging read (with some good life lessons as well) ;)"
bipolar,ffmxeds,t1_ffmshnk,1580059876.0,"Thank you for responding! That's so strange that that one doc was prescribing you all this stuff, but shut you down on getting a diagnosis. 

I'm definitely gonna bring my mom now, if I can, to help fill in some blanks. It's hard because I try to internalize as many of my symptoms as possible, so they're more 'privately' experienced than publicly.  That's good she actually responded to you asking about what diagnosis you are this time, I feel that's only right since you're treating a person and they should be as involved in their treatment process as possible. 

I'm hoping it's a structured interview that really goes through a set guide of questions to parse what's happening!"
bipolar,ffmv0pu,t1_ffmrn6q,1580059261.0,"Thank you for sharing! I wonder why your old psychiatrist never investigated more into it. Is there any reason why you don't want to try a different psychiatrist to confirm, or get it diagnosed officially?"
bipolar,ffmu9bn,t1_ffmod5n,1580058980.0,Thank you!
BipolarReddit,ffmu27z,t1_ffmqu87,1580058903.0,"Anyone would be exhausted, going through all of that. You have right to that. I'm sorry things have gotten much harder to manage and things more treatment-resistant; does your doctor have a plan for helping with this?"
BipolarReddit,ffmtnx4,t1_ffmo4p4,1580058751.0,"Thank you for sharing. Wow, I'm so sorry that you went, and are going through this. They're not lying when they say that these episodes cause damage to our brains. I'm wishing you luck on returning eventually to your academic/research career, if you decide you want to. 

I see, that makes sense. Parsing those symptoms, that makes sense."
BipolarReddit,ffmss65,t1_ffmnl6h,1580058536.0,"No, thank you for sharing! I relate very strongly to what you said you went through. 

I'm really trying to see about my family history from my mom, as much as possible behaviors, since I know diagnoses weren't given if there is anything."
bipolar,ffmr37h,t1_ffmkz22,1580058016.0,"Thank you for sharing! Wow, that was quite an episode! I don't think anything I've gone through holds a candle to that. I've just gone into rage moments, though once I did leave my mom (who'd just come back from work, and was out for a quick run to the store) to ride the trains in NYC throughout the night in the middle of winter. Came back in the morning, expecting to just go to school. Walked nearly 2 hours through a severe warning blizzard in New England once in a simple cable knit sweater, cuz I wanted some ice cream. I wasn't thinking I could, ya know, get hypothermia or die or anything. (Why do so many of mine deal with cold, lol). Again, nothing holds a candle."
bipolar,ffmptes,t1_ffmisp4,1580057685.0,"Thank you for sharing! Those are very different outcomes! (Though, I'm understanding, more practicers are believing they're on more of a continuum/spectrum as well). That's good that an actual interview pinpointed what it more likely is."
bipolar,ffmpcev,t1_ffmh1pa,1580057498.0,"Thank you for sharing! Wow, that's interesting how (the director and your later doctor) were both thinking schizoaffective disorder. I see, hour long, lengthy set of questions. I wonder why I never got this sort of test or interview set!"
bipolar,ffmoqx0,t1_ffmgvah,1580057332.0,"Thanks for sharing, and hehe, thank you for the best wishes on this track! Wow, I never thought of that, low lithium as a biomarker for bipolar huh. I wonder if they'll ask about that. I'm trying to prepare some histories so I don't blank on 'question/answer' stuff, since i'm bad about answering questions in the moment."
bipolar,ffmo6ku,t1_ffmgkmh,1580057204.0,"Thank you for sharing! I'm wondering if that's the case for me, since my 'highs' don't seem that bad (to me), but concern some of my friends and family. And my lows have been unbearable in the past."
bipolar,ffmnzjb,t1_ffmgvgl,1580057132.0,"Ahhh, I see, so I mix of what I'm hoping for! 

And yeah, no, it's terrible. And that's another thing, what it communicates to patients struggling, that unimportance (and burdening) doesn't help at all. 

Sounds like psychiatric sector is overburdened everywhere, sadly. I'm lucky enough that my current psychologist I started seeing through an achievement gap program from middle school that had psychiatric services, and then others were through college--even those were long waits. When I tried going in  network, I couldn't cuz of the shitty deductibles. I'm about to try with my home insurance now, so I'll have to get back to you on that!

It varies from city to rural areas too, though even. People have talked on here about how there's only so many psychiatric professionals in rural areas, all with long waiting lists. And hospitalizations depend on if they have enough beds. It's all a mess to me."
bipolar,ffmn65g,t1_ffmlz1i,1580056815.0,"Of course! And she has the right to that, it can be hard on people without mental illness. But that lasting support is the most important thing!"
BipolarReddit,ffmmg0a,t1_ffmep0t,1580056669.0,"Thank you for replying! I'm kinda the reverse, diagnosed depression with some anxiety at age 16ish, ADHD 'round 18. It can be so hard to recognize behavior in ourselves aligning with something, which you exemplify as someone who could also diagnose!

I'm so sorry you went through such a terrible episode. I can't imagine if that doc stayed...makes no sense, NOT listening to your patient like that. I'm glad your second doc listened to you appropriately and is treating you the way you need.

I've wondered about BPD myself because I used to struggle with binge eating (and still have troubles with overeating in general), but I notice my binges accompany particularly bad depressive episodes. They're almost cyclical themselves. I've also never had the dysfunction in relationships; haven't had many romantic to know (not my jam), but have great friendships and good relationships with family too, so I wonder. Also never self-harmed, unless you count the binge eating (sometimes I do, sometimes I don't.)"
BipolarReddit,ffmko3x,t1_ffm08fm,1580055950.0,"No, thank you for responding! No ramble at all. It was inspiring reading you be so 'ahead' of your treatment plan, reaching out for help, and being prepared for the diagnostic. 

I've been trying to read up on bipolar, and watch some documentaries, and though I still do feel I don't know much at all, it's helping me to know how to frame my symptoms so it doesn't come out all garbled. 

That's awesome you talk so freely to your father about this, and have friends and support groups to reach out to. And good public healthcare is EVERYTHING, ugh.

I wasn't hospitalized, but similarly diagnosed with depression and some anxiety around 16,  the anxiety faded by depressive stints stayed, in addition to some 'quite not rights' that I want to uncover. I'm wishing you luck on your journey to recovery and figuring out what works for you! 

Also, that makes sense on the psychiatrist meeting thing. I guess I'm getting tripped up over the 'hourlong' thing I didn't have. Psychologists nor social workers really checked in in between either, just nurses that asked 'how are you feeling today?' and I gave quick answers to. I guess the med reactions and group therapy responses could give a lot away, but I hadn't even realized I could have been manic in hospital since I wasn't eating and wasn't sleeping and just thought the meds 'took away my depression,' but they didn't place me on any anti-depressants either."
bipolar,ffmigzj,t1_ffmeq6z,1580055192.0,"Thank you for sharing! Ugh, the struggle is so hard, truly. I guess since  I haven't gotten any of the questionnaires, or a lengthened visit that focused on diagnosis, I'm doubting it myself. My psychologist who's seen me since I was 16 said the diagnosis makes sense to her, but she's kinda the 'primary' opinion to which I want a second one to. I wanna keep seeing her, cuz she's great honestly, just wanna see what someone else thinks. 

I was also diagnosed ADHD first, so I wonder if there's some comorbidity happening there, or the ADHD is a 'sign' of the bipolar from earlier, if it's that."
BipolarReddit,ffmhw1d,t1_ffm6lhy,1580054890.0,"Thank you for sharing! I see, they took a partially observational approach and got at how you thought as well, which I like. In addition to the behavior. I'm so glad your dad paid attention to how you feel, and scheduled that first therapy appointment. 

I'm trying to write down all the little details I find in the day, and compile them into some short enough doc to bring in with me, since the person won't know me as I'm looking for a second opinion."
BipolarReddit,ffmha4v,t1_fflxo5q,1580054679.0,"Thank you for sharing. Wow, I'm so sorry that your mother contributed to your inability to get stable. I know that diagnosing as a teenager is controversial, but it does prevent these kinds of cases. I'm wishing you well in your journey on getting stabilized. 

I'm gonna keep my (limited) time with antidepressants in mind when I see a diagnostic doctor."
BipolarReddit,ffmgtdx,t1_fflpgwy,1580054460.0,"Thank you for sharing! It can be really difficult to believe different doctors when they say you have something. I'm sort of in a similar boat, but want a more extensive diagnostic evaluation, to really clarify things for me. 

I think I additionally have a lot of shame and misunderstanding of what bipolar is as well, and I've been trying to change/vary the portrayals of bipolar that show up in my media, though media's overall portrayals of only certain extremes doesn't help. I've tried watching Stephen Fry's documentary too. The fear of whatever I'm going through also getting worse with over time, even if I find out what's happening, also scares me. 

That's me! To a tee. Depression first (with some anxiety that magically disappeared), then ADHD. And, get this, they typed it 'impulsive' type. I know it's a synonym for hyperactive for ADHD's case, but I wonder how the docror'll look at that."
bipolar,ffmfsz2,t1_ffmehz4,1580054081.0,"Oh, wow, haha maybe this is a thing! And, that's also true, I've realized I can rationalize anything, to a fault. Wow, that must've been difficult to hear, especially to realize when you don't remember that either :/ Hopefully she understands it wasn't 'you' doing that."
bipolar,ffmfl6d,t1_ffm7txw,1580053947.0,"Thank you so much for sharing, it does! I see family history is a high factor here, in addition to personal history. My father suffered from addiction, though I don't struggle with that, despite having the 'gene.' All of my immediate family has been diagnosed as depressed once, and everyone besides my mother has been diagnosed as suicidal once as well, though we've had some trauma and difficult situations in our lives and shared some of that  as well, so I'm not share if it's situational or actually biochemical. I need to ask about my father's behavior...I remember 'off' times, and my family was always saying he was depressed.

I understand at the very least I have depressive episodes, but not much else. I'm trying to track things and write em down now."
bipolar,ffmey0j,t1_ffm73x7,1580053616.0,"Thank you for sharing! Lol, I can't imagine your face at that exchange, not to make light of the issue. Do you mind if I PM you to ask about those situations? I might be in a similar boat (knowing what's considered 'crazy' and what's not is so hard in mental health). And, would that place you at BP2, if he typed you in the diagnosis?"
bipolar,ffmelum,t1_ffm616h,1580053435.0,"Thank you for sharing! I see that it was brought up to you by your doc, who had the luck of seeing you and observing you for years to come to a conclusion for your symptoms. It seems 'informal,' but like the most involved and sure approach to understanding and diagnosing someone correctly, since they were able to observe you, to an extent. 

My psychologist had noted my 'mood dysregulation' issues for a while before my hospitalization but wasn't sure. She's the closest person, really the only person, whom I could do that kind of diagnostic example with."
bipolar,ffmdwop,t1_ffm43ah,1580053138.0,"Ahh, I see. Thank you for sharing. I can definitely relate to invalidating how I feel; I'm trying to not look at this journey as saying 'I'm fine,' since I know there are things I do that aren't neurotypical, but more so just owing myself a more proper explanation of things, even if it turns out the same thing is true. And keeping my experiences valid that way. 

Excuse me if I'm about to sound ignorant and insensitive, but was he able to distinguish between the BPD and bipolar episodes based on the length of your hypomanic episodes?"
bipolar,ffmdcw1,t1_fflx4yq,1580052833.0,"Thank you for sharing! Wow, that backlog of appointments they got causing wait time sucks. 16 weeks?? Depression is difficult because it can turn 'critical' at any moment, so while I don't think people should escalate a situation to take away the choices of a person, I do think that this response is as negligent as the opposite is too forceful at times.

Ahh, I see, mood chart, some sort of test, and interview. By test vs. interview, do you mean like a narrative-based interview vs. a questionnaire test where you answer questions? Or, was the interview 'questionnaire'-based, and the test some actual kind of test?"
bipolar,ffmcmy7,t1_fflxk4t,1580052423.0,"Thank you for answering! Oh my GOSH, what a weirdo of a doc, saying that kind of stuff to not only someone depressed, but a KID no less! You're so strong and had good esteem and advocacy for yourself to, even in that state, know she was crock full of shit and get a REAL opinion. Ughh, people forget malpractice happens in mental health too, just as cases in physical health rise and payouts from surgery mishaps continue. I'm so sorry you weren't through that. 

Your post gave me the idea to try to bring my mom with me, to fill in some family history sides that I don't know. The REAL person to bring in would be my father, since I believe it stems from him, but he a) wasn't in my life, and b) 's now dead. I'm gonna try to ask her and my bros what he was like, the little that we saw of him. I don't remember much. Also ask my mom what I was like growing up as well, since I can't quite remember myself."
bipolar,ffljsv7,t1_ffkjc6k,1580040444.0,"Wow, I wish I could switch up my lind like that! It's strange because I do have things I need to do every day because I'm finishing school coursework, yet even when I have a plan for the day I get like this, maybe cuz i cant do other things. And some days, I'm perfectly fine just doing nothing and it doesnt bother me."
bipolar,ffliv84,t1_ffkiag7,1580040178.0,"Ahhh, I see, so the anxiety is moreso stemming from guilt over not doing things because you're depressed? Just wanna make sure I understand clearly! I also was having a months long depression before this hypo thing took over on Jan 8th, so I dont know if it could be a mixed episode either still."
BipolarReddit,fflifm8,t1_ffk3zid,1580039992.0,"Thanks for responding! I do feel overstimulated! Like, noises often feel too loud and abrasive, and colors too bright or 'distracting' (have to notice them.) But I dont feel the overstimulation at the same times as the anxiety, if that makes sense? Or maybe I'm not connecting them in my mind and there is a connection. 

It might be that, over the bus. It's weird, because I know I made the better decision by staying and working, but I was itching to just go and explore. Like different parts of my mind are conflicting on confirming it was the right decision, even though a few weeks ago I know itd unilaterally be staying to do my work. Maybe it was anxiety over not getting work done....I'm just wondering why it came up again in the car.

Haha, that's true from the music. I normally love listening to music like that as well! Something felt different about this time, but maybe I'm reading into it. 

No, you're making sense!!, sorry, my post was hard to  understand!"
bipolar,ffjltiu,t1_ffjka8r,1580001206.0,Glad to know I'm not alone in my realization!
BipolarReddit,ffj6iem,t1_ffj5dyw,1579991632.0,"That's true! I like that analogy. You really gotta try to get better. You need those lines. I'm wishing you the best too, and sincerely hoping you get the medical attention that you need as soon as possible. It really is rough out here. All we all need is help, but I believe in all of us in getting to the places where we need to be. Thank you!!"
BipolarReddit,ffhwznb,t1_ffhv30v,1579957611.0,"Ahh, I see. Even then, seems a bit reckless to not consider the patients own words there, actions and functionality can change quickly. I feel you on controlling emotions, I have learned the same (similar motivation from father, who was abusive as well). That very well may be true, the times are behind in those ways a lot."
BipolarReddit,ffhum36,t1_ffhucbb,1579954664.0,"Fuck, I'm so sorry. That's terrifying to go through, but all too real round these parts. As hard as it is, you cant let doctors not treating youn seriously make you stop treating yourself seriously; you are your own first line of defense, and its really good that you recognize that and you're trying to get help. I'm confused by doctors hearing your symptoms, you staying you dont feel safe by yourself, and letting you go with not even a hair of an action plan? It could be overcrowding, which is an issue in itself. I wish I knew other steps to advise :/"
BipolarReddit,ffhsk12,t1_ffhscf2,1579951703.0,"I feel that. It's very confusing, and it's common to feel you don't have bipolar cuz the meds are working, but people dont discuss what you mention enough, where theres almost an 'imposters syndrome' regarding bipolar where you believe you're using it as a crutch when it in fact has interfered with your life. Then again, second opinions are always good, in case things start to feel like they dont register anymore, but I can't imagine how hard it is if you cant afford it :/ theres no one in-network you can try?"

Even before this line, you had me in the first half.

I think it's hard (and I'm saying this as someone who's navigating a re-diagnosis from doubts myself) that as people who have been diagnosed with bipolar, to take ourselves out of the equations and not think of how we feel while doing our actions, but just look at our actions ourselves. And really evaluate the emotions we have while doing them, our energy states. This is not neurotypical behavior, that you've outlined here. The cycles, and the scale of said cycles, align with others' experiences with bipolar as well. Mood lability (the snow) isn't uncommon in bipolar disorder or between episodes.

It can also take years to relapse. It can take years to have your first majorly disruptive depressive episode, and vice versa. For many people, the first majorly disruptive episodes are depression; yours might've been your manias, if they are that.

You might've reached a euthymic state with your therapist, and that doesn't mean EDMR therapy wasn't helpful for you, that just means psychotherapy can be a rightful tool in your treatment plan. But responding positively to that doesn't mean someone doesn't have bipolar anymore.

You might be one of the lucky ones where your meds just really work with your body chemistry, no matter what you do. While I think the goal is holistic health, I think this is what everyone wants. They'd be even more effective if you utilized habits that facilitated them in maintaining your mental state, but ehh. I'd advise you not got off them, though, or talk with your doc first because it's classic bipolar too to, once you feel better, think you no longer need meds or no longer have the illness.

But, all of this is, again, assuming you actually have bipolar. I'm no doctor. None of us are. I'm just saying this, in the off chance you are and are trying to deny, and need to be reassured that these things can't possibly be possible if you have bipolar, because they very much are. If you're really concerned and thinking, I'd say get a second opinion (as always), it really can't hurt. But, you have a family history, and your wife strongly agrees. I don't know what to tell you. Good luck."
BipolarReddit,ffhf7pc,t3_etc59l,1579932732.0,"I feel fatigue in the daytime from hypomania too, it's quite common actually. Especially if you have mixed hypomania (which I suspect I'm having a bout of), where there are either depressive symptoms present or your hypomania is more agitated in expression than elated.

I'm going through it now where, occasionally, I'll sleep from 4PM-12AMish because of meds (I'm a student), but usually in the day I have a shit time sleeping. Tossing and turning just trying to force myself to sleep, almost insomniac but I know it's because my mind wakes up after about 2 hours sleep and decides 'you're good! No need for sleep!'

I also have other symptoms, like anxiety, rough impulses, agitated and tense, mood swings (with some giddiness thrown in there), overstimulation of the senses more classic to mania, and am prone to tantrums (haven't had one in years, but got close on Thursday). Reaction to stimuli all out of whack, screaming at myself. That kinda thing.  But again, that's mixed, and that's just MY experience *in* a probably mixed hypomania, yours can very well be classic hypomania as that happened to me too.

ETA: I just saw you confirmed you're going through a mixed-to-euphoric episode. Sorry for the run-off on the ear! I'm wishing you luck as you figure out what to do. Exercise helps a lot with sleep I heard, also trying to use meditation apps at night, anything to tire yourself out in the day and calm yourself in night to sleep. But sleep hygiene is REALLY important at this time (I say, looking at my clock in shock :O )."
BipolarReddit,ffhepd1,t1_ffguz1i,1579932165.0,"This was exactly my experience. It's been a while since I'd had full blown (if it even was that), but just this hypomanic episode was EXHAUSTING, and my body would feel it eventually as the days went on. Eventually, I crashed, and slept for like 12 hours, 2 days in a row."
BipolarReddit,ffhei4l,t1_ffgqhrf,1579931945.0,"You're right, there's no point giving up without knowing I tried my best. That's why I want to keep going! I NEED things to get better, cuz this right here ain't it. 

Maybe I need to take a similar approach and not take things too seriously...seriously, yes, but acknowledge that it'll take some time. Hehe,  thank you, I sure hope they do! I'm hoping things continue making sense for you :)"
bipolar,ffhe41d,t1_ffe9ctz,1579931525.0,"Wow, thank you so much for responding. I'm so sorry I didn't see this earlier! I would say I am quite removed from my mind/my thoughts, but they still have their difficult hold on me, so beginning to practice mindfulness can be a good place to start (or at least, continue, once I get the super sudden urges under control). I never thought of that, that maybe my mind was thinking of fixing hurtful past solutions or predicting future disasters, cuz there are some very specific situations where that response could be warranted--just not the one I was in, and not in daily life. I'm gonna google ACT and maybe talk to my therapist about it to get some more info, see if she knows some techniques as well.

""This is why bipolars are so busy with art, song, writing, musical instruments, building, crafts, etc. They keep us in the present concentrating on what’s going on in the moment."" -- I've never thought of that, but that's a really good point, what are healthy ways to diffuse and focus in on the present. I sadly don't have a creative bone in my body :( I write some shit poetry is all. It makes me wonder how I got this diagnosis at all sometimes, ha."
BipolarReddit,ffgpzzf,t1_ffgo98h,1579912121.0,"Exactly!! Though I do love my psychologist. Thank you, I will try to keep at it, I hate that it make take awhile to get better or realize what's going on though!"
BipolarReddit,fffruf9,t1_ffe0iyp,1579890431.0,"I was diagnosed May 2018! I've been thinking of getting a second (or fifth, who's counting) opinion at the medical group my moms a part of. I never thought of that, that withdrawal from an antidepressant can trigger mania as well. 

I've definitely had depressive episodes, and I guess some 'revved up' moments. I'm hoping the right diagnosis will come up, cuz I dont know if it's me being in denial but I cant help but feel theres something missing."

BipolarReddit,ffeoaa4,t3_et6s2h,1579857094.0,"I'm in LOVE with this song. It got me through some pretty bad depressions a few years ago; strangely, I never even bothered to check out the band. Just listening to this one, beautiful song, was enough for me as I was going through it.

I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through such a tough time. PLEASE dont give up. It know it doesnt feel like it now, but theres always a way out of this room. Theres always a key, lying around, somewhere. 


Are there people nearby you you can spend time with? Friends nearby, or family? Sometimes, even if we still feel fairly alone 'by' people, just the act of spending time with others minimizes how alone we feel, and activates our sensors against our depressions. 

You might not have the energy to do this, but can you try finding a new pastime? It doesnt have to be something big. It can be learning a new language for 5 minutes, everyday on duolingo. Something new to trigger a different response in your brain. 

Can you try meditation and grounding techniques, to hawk at the stress, if you cant approach your neighbors as well? 

And most of all, are you working with a care team? Do you see a doctor/therapist/psychiatrist? If you can afford to, maybe you can discuss the intrusive thoughts and see if any resulting therapies or medications can help them out. 

I'm wishing you all the best. It may not always be light where we're at, but eventually the clouds do lift."

Thanks for reassuring me that I've got some self-awareness about me; I was really, truly close to doing it on the highway, which wouldn't have been good for anyone involved. Did you 'feel' hypomanic at that time, if you can remember? Because I dont really feel hypomanic at all."
bipolar,ffd42iz,t1_ffcrrpj,1579813018.0,"Ahhh, I see, that explanation of affective lability makes a lot of sense then, as something that can be 'apart' from episodes as well!

Mixed hypomania wasn't even an option that I was thinking could happen, but now that I look back on it, it makes sense. The 'box' descriptor that has mixed hypomania, I also counted a couple things there that feels like what I'm going through. It doesn't feel like regular mania, and I feel it's getting increasingly worse....somehow. I don't know. I lot of it feels like it's in my head. 

That's how i feel! I feel like I'm running on adrenaline and feel like doing things but don't do them, so it's like there's pressure on my head :( No, you're actually so good at describing things, and you're so considerate!

I guess I feel that. I'm not sure which camp I'm in, resisting the diagnosis and not being fine or being kind of fine, or it not being the right diagnosis for me, even. Holding stuff loosely for now might be the right idea. 

That's fair, sometimes it's not all about fitting into a neat box, but a lot of the insights and solutions still apply. No no, I'm so happy you're responding, it gives a lot of perspective :)"
