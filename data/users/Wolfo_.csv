AskReddit,fet1bux,t3_eqjkhf,1579370895.0,"You can do everything right and still lose. My mother split from my stepfather, who is an amazing man. They were perfect for eachother, but everyone has their flaws. My mother is a pushover, and combine that with a manipulative sister, it spells disaster. (for reference, this was when I was 14. my sister would be 22 at the time) She would completely dismiss any rules my stepfather made, and my mother would back her up in fear of losing her. My sister exploited this to do whatever she wanted and my mother developed a ""blood before marriage"" type thing that pissed me off because she wouldnt listen to me. She would only listen to my sister. It got to the point where I told her if she didnt make my sister get another place, I would stop talking to her as I realized my stepfather was getting fed up. I tried everything I could to keep them together but she wouldnt listen to me. I didnt talk to her for 6 months after that."

OopsDidntMeanTo,fdp2zn9,t1_fdol3pe,1578618774.0,It’s not really that funny. It’s gross tbh.
GetMotivated,fdiccv2,t1_fdi0ozs,1578439711.0,"You’re right, my bad. But the odds of winning the lottery are extremely small. According to Lottery USA, the odds of winning the Powerball jackpot are 1 in 292.2 million, with the Mega Millions jackpot even lower at 1 in 302.6 million. Why leave it up to chance when you can do things to better yourself right now?"
GetMotivated,fdhpjn7,t1_fdf9bhh,1578427606.0,"studies show that winning the lottery doesnt really change overall happiness on a day to day basis. if im depressed, and i win the lottery, it will make things easier to get therapy or something like that, but it wont make me happier. its what you do with it to make yourself happier"
