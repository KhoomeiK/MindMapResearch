I'm sorry you went through that dude."
depression,ff5on8u,t3_erqjbv,1579603520.0,"People would take my illness seriously if I was hospitalised. 

At my worst times I've thought about how fuck,  if I was dying of cancer people just might give a damn.  

Obviously no one really wants it but at least someone would have to admit that I'm sick.  I'm sick anyway but at least theyd have to admit it then."
aspiememes,ff2evw1,t3_er1sx8,1579503246.0,Relatable.  I'm still looking into an official diagnosis but there really isn't any doubt there.  Yesterday I felt comfortable enough to tell the person I was with that the layout of the supermarket was making me anxious (it was all wrong!!!) and it was both a relief and kind of awkward.
depression,ff2erno,t1_felnpby,1579503115.0,"I'm sorry you feel unable to reach out at the moment.  Believe me,  I've been there. I hope that you guys are on a road to improvement and that things will look up"

depression,fcqah8p,t3_eidxlt,1577882150.0,"An alternate perspective- I've accomplished heaps,  and it's got me fucking nowhere.  Don't know which is worse, achieving nothing and getting nowhere,  or achieving plenty and be practically going backwards."
bipolar,fc56rk3,t1_fc534rp,1577446101.0,Yup!  It's fantastic. You can log everything you've ever done. Very satisfying
