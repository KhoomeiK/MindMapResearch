When I am going to upgrade the market has to solve some things.

ElectricScooters,ff5njol,t3_er16xl,1579601860.0,"I have a similar one to the y8 and y9 with a different brand that I have been driving around Oslo this summer,  [https://www.bydue.no/collections/all/products/var-toppmodell-bydue-2-0](https://www.bydue.no/collections/all/products/var-toppmodell-bydue-2-0) .

Mine has a 700w motor and can go around a 100km. Overall is ok to drive here in Oslo but will buy at least a 1000w engine next time as there are a lot of hills here as it struggles a bit in the steepest hills. Riding comfort is very good. I was a bit dissapointed by the build quality and will definitely upgrade sometime in the future. There was a lot of adjustements to be made and a lot of Norwegian users have complained about the same problems that I had. If you do get this, make sure that the seller has gone over and adjusted the scooter.

Main stem under handlebars was very loose and needed a lot of adjustments to not feel loose, now it's ok but not perfect. The foldable handlebars have a pretty shitty construction but works good enough after some work. The handlebars creak a lot in the first months due to the screws inside rubbing against the metal but it reduces with time. Those same screws always goes out of adjustment making the handlebars loose (not dangerous but feels shitty), this can be remedied by locktite. Prepare to get looks from pedestrians as the brakes are screaming like crazy in the first two months. Breaks does not feel right. I have tried to adjust them a million times but it seems that all they are capable of is all or nothing, breaking very hard or hardly at all. If anyone know of any good quality brakes that can be slapped on easily with the right dimensions, please let me know!

There is noticable lag from when you hit the gas until the scooter starts moving, really annoying at first but you get used to it. The acceleration is not very smooth which I think is a common problem with e-scooters, it's a bit all or nothing.

It's sold to me as rainproof, not waterproof maybe as a precaution from the seller to save money on people driving through a lot of water. I have been driving it in a massive rain storm without any problem and commute to work even if it rains. 

I dont think the electric scooter market is ""there"" yet with build quality. Most of them are mass produced without quality in mind and the main producers have little insentive to innovate as people are just buying them anyway. The sellers get the parts from the same factories and just slap their own brand on it. There do seem to be some innovators though (never tried a Dualtron but they look ok) so maybe in a few years we can get ""motorbike quality"" e-scooters. 

I have come to peace with the build quality though and it's really fun to ride although a bit wild."

For some people it is very important with ritual and the vomiting etc but other people dont mind. If you are feeling really sick you know how amazing it feels to throw it up? Pretty sweet! Some people like a complete alkaloid profile while other people says it's equal or better with the extracted stuff. Personally I think it's a bit down to placebo and what you are expecting of it but I'm definitely no authority on DMT. A lot of people probably feel it's safer and more ""natural"" to drink a brew from plantmaterial rather than a crystaline powder that might contain solvents or other impurities if the extractor has been sloppy. I would recommend reading more about it at the dmtnexus forum for more information."
depression,feoeuzy,t1_feo64o9,1579299122.0,""" They don't change you they just show you things about yourself which you alone have to change ""

I agree, they are not magically going to turn you into something you are not, it will require work but for me and a lot of people they can you show things about yourself and your behaviour that you didn't know was a problem. Knowing what are your problems is the first step to change.

""  I've done a shit ton of psychedelics, stimulants etc. and self medication is like playing Russian roulette. But you won't understand this if you have not experienced this for yourself. ""

There's a difference in use and abuse. If a person is using drugs every weekend because the person are bored, sad and depressed thinking the change is the imediate pleasure from the drugs you feel, maybe the person is more like a drug abuser. I know several people who have fucked up their lives using drugs recreationally mostly related to opiates, benzos and dopamine stimulants but I think it's more related to how you use drugs as mdma and psychedelics can be abused also. I would never encourage anyone to do a ""shit ton of psychedelics, stimulants etc"" as you said in your first paragraf, if you want a change you are going to have to work for it.

A lot of MDMAs neurotoxicity is unknown but it does not seem to be very strong in recreational doses. This site has good information for anyone who cares. [https://dancesafe.org/drug-information/is-mdma-neurotoxic/](https://dancesafe.org/drug-information/is-mdma-neurotoxic/)  .

LSD can make people throw up though but it's ""fairly"" easy on the body for most people.

I think you misread me or haven't heard of it before as I wasn't talking about ""Pharmaceuticals"" but ""Pharmahuasca"" is the extracted chemicals from ayahusca or similar plants (syrian rue, acacia etc) so you dont have to deal with the tannins and other plant matter that might be hard on the stomach. basically just the active chemicals, variations of dmt and some kind of MAO inhibitor."
depression,feo4xn6,t1_fenu4ut,1579295150.0,"Psychedelics and MDMA might actually change your life after just one use, it's not like being medicated daily using benzos or similar. There's an expression that goes ""travel broadens the mind"". With these kind of drugs the travel goes inward to places you have never gone before and you see things that you have hid from your self. It's extremly rare for people who have bad trips to get any lasting negative effects but it does happen. 

For me they have helped me throughout my life. I remember one time sitting in my apartment feeling like shit, had been for a long time. I shared almost nothing in common with the friends I had other then being from the same home town. I Got a hold of some Acid from a friend and took it just listening to music at home when I heard this song and I'm like ""What's that instrument, I have to learn that instrument!"" Started googling it and realising it costs several thousand dollars but it's a woodwind instrument and I always wanted to learn the saxophone aswell and they are a lot cheaper. Insanely motivated I got a hold of a saxophone, got myself a teacher and started playing for hours every day for over a year (had tendonitis and throat surgery later but that's another story) met new friends and got into the jazz scene going to concerts all the time and still do.

Psychedelics can be like a very strong catalyst for change.

All my close friends (exept one, he got paranoid from mixing with cannabis, not recomended) who I have used mushrooms with say it's one of their best experiences and they have never used them more then twice in their life.

Just be careful and know how they work, start with a low dosage in a safe environment and the risks are minimal."
depression,fenzxra,t1_fengt2d,1579293211.0,""" Risks include: becoming a “hippy” "". That's always something that have bothered me with psychedelics. Rational analytical people tend to become more rational and analytical (right?) while emotinal spiritual people open their mind and it never seems to close. I think Carl Sagan said something like, ""Don't be so open minded that your brain falls out"".

I never tried ayahuasca but I do think it helps to use pharmahuasca instead of a plant brew to mitigate at least brown pants and maybe womit mouth? Kinda how making mushroom tea is easier on the stomach then eating raw mushrooms? Or is it just the sheer force of transitioning that makes you womit? 2Cb makes me nauceous just because of the speed in which it hits me."
depression,fenxnzr,t1_fen05kj,1579292353.0,"I'm 34. Cannabis only makes me depressed and paranoid. I started smoking when I was around 17 and have wasted several years on that poison and it only made me worse, unmotivated and lazy. I't might work for some people though, I know people who go on dates after smoking all day where I get more or less retarded after just a hit. When I first started experimenting with LSD, mushrooms and MDMA in my early twenties (ca 22) my life really changed for the better and I stopped smoking weed (every day, I havent smoked for over a year now but still do ocasionally).

MDMA was the first time that I can remember feeling like a good person and it was the first time ever that I opened up my feelings to someone else as normally there's kind of a defensive brick wall in front of me. This was in conjunction with two good friends in my room listening to music and just talking, not in a party setting. It probably saved my life as I was very suicidal. I had read several books about MDMA before I tried it so I knew that it stimulated Serotonin (google it) and I knew that I could actually feel similar to this by normal life, I just had'nt figured out how.

LSD made me se my own crazy thoughts (believing i knew everyone hates me and similar) from a third perspective realizing that I have no clue what people think of me, I used to be quite delusional. I still do psychedelics about once every two years. For me it can be like going on vacation with a shrink, worst case scenario is that I get no revelations but have a great time being home listening to music so it's a win anyway.

But my earlier realizations is only half the battle though as the drugs wear off and It took many years to retrain my brain to remove the intense self hatred aspect of my depression. As soon as I escaped into a fantasy world in my head where everybody hated me I had to remind myself to get back to reality and remind myself that I didn't know what these people where thinking about me. 

Some disclaimers:

 I would recomend anybody that want to use either psychedelics or MDMA to read as much information as possible regarding ""safe"" use of these drugs. I like the book PIHKAL by Alexander Shulgin but there's a lot of information on the web as well. I found that the dmtnexus forum has good sections on safe drug use, just ignore the spirituality that you might encounter if it doesn't suit you. Start your dosage at the lower end as your physical size might not reflect the dosage that is right for you. A safe environment to mimick is that of a SPA. Turn your phones of, light a candle and listen to some chill music. Imagine that you could meditate comfortably in the environment (even if your not a meditator) without interuptions from the ""outside world"". Buy test kits (at least a Marquis test for MDMA) to see that you probably got what you paid for. You  dont want your ""SPA""-MDMA evening to become some kind of ""Bathsalt"" rampage where you wake up with your neighbors shower curtain stuck in your asshole down at the police station. DO NOT MIX PSYCHEDELICS WITH CANNABIS! Some people swear by it but I have met a lot of people using psychedelics and almost all of them who have experienced bad trips (this is not the same a ""hard trip"") have smoked weed and got super paranoid. If you want to experiment with this, have some trips under your belt beforehand. Personally I find that even smoking cannabis after Psychedelics or MDMA to boost effects takes away all the good after-effects where your mind is really sharp and turning your brain into a stupid caveman-mashed-potato-brain. Better to reflect with a sharp mind.

With psychedelics (very rarely with MDMA but it actually happens!) it's especially important to have a Plan B if somebody starts freaking out so again it's important to know what kind of side effects might occur so nobody gets to worried if they appear. Me, I get all off them. Stomach pains, nausea, joint pains etc but I know it's normal for some people so they dont worry me. When I'm with friends and use drugs I always want to have bin nearby incase someone needs to womit as this is quite normal, especially when ""coming up"" on the drugs. Think about using a trip sitter, especially if everybody is new to the experience.

Sorry if I'm rambling, is a bit drunk, cheers!"

I still ask people if there is any doubt though but most people here are very chill. 

Dogs here are almost exclusively pets and I have never met anyone with a guard dog but it probably exists somewhere. As far as I know it's pretty common for dogs in America to be bred and trained for being agressive and suspicious towards strangers?
