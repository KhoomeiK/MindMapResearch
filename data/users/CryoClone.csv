If you are fine with just going into situations like that and don't notice your surroundings, good luck staying alive.

I'm sure it manifests itself in a variety of awful ways.

What I mean when I say white people are more racism is we, at least I, get to see the racism that some black people never will. They only see the most hateful, the most vocal. The ones that have decided to spread their vitriol to other folks. The ones that are racist and say things like ""oh, it gets ""dark"" on that side of town, if you k ow what I mean"" or ""I don't eat or hang around *them*.

Now, I'm not saying hearing someone's racism as if you agreed is anywhere near the same as being on the receiving end of it. I just mean that, as a white dude who looks like he should be on Duck Dynasty, we get to see way, way more racists than someone who isn't. And they are *everywhere*.  It's little old ladies, that sweet cashier who checked you out, that big Bubba you just met. It's people you would never, ever suspect of being racist. It's them *and* the ones you *know* are racist.

I could never completely settle on if it was just boasting or outright stupidity. 

To give a clear picture of the folk that populated Vidor, Texas about a little over a decade ago, I'll tell you the story of me and my wife's first date. We were originally going to a comedy club in Beaumont, Texas. We were grab some food first, but the interstate was stopped dead still around Vidor. Some large wreck where people were getting Life Flights, so traffic wasn't moving anywhere any time soon. So, we (my wife) decided to stop in Vidor and eat at the Casa Ole (also my wife's - then 1st date's - decision). Now, a little background into my wife and I. At the time, she was a manager at Hot Topic, and looked the part, tattoos and all. I am a bigger guy with giant, long curly hair and a big beard, sort of hipster-esque, as I really enjoy a nice flanel. Now, this is just to allow you to know the visuals. We are also white, like *really* white. Almost painfully white. 

We walked into Casa Ole and got taken to a booth. My date went straight to the menu and was deciding what she wanted to eat. I, however, couldn't help but notice *the entire fucking restaurant* was staring at us with a ""what the fuck are *you* doing here *boy*"" look on their faces. Including the women and the table full of a youth little league team. All the same faces. My wife was oblivious to it. Didn't care. I just didn't want to die, especially in Vidor. 

If you don't look like what you picture a Trump supporter in the Deep South to look like, or dressed like the dude in OP's post, they don't want you there. And they *will* be proactive about it.

I was doing about 50 mph, 20 mph under the speed limit, and as I crested the top I noticed a car in the right hand lane about half way down the bridge with its emergency lights on.  It had stalled , and as this bridge has no shoulder, was just stalled in the middle of the right hand lane. I slowed down to about 35-40 mph and thought to myself ""how the hell does someone stall on the *downside* of a bridge?""  

Then, just about the time I started slowing down more, because people are crazy and you never know what insane shit they will do when their car is stalled (especially when they could have just coasted the last 50 yards and been on the shoulder of the highway instead of in the middle of a bridge with no lights, but whatever).  I was about halfway between the top and the stalled car when I noticed there was *another* car on the left side *without* their emergency lights on.  This lady had stopped *directly across from the first lady* to ask if she needed help. In the dark, with no lights on, directly across on a bridge just wide enough for two cars.  

I slammed on my brakes, going downhill, on a wet-ish bridge, and hoped for the best.  I stopped about a foot an a half from the woman on the left.  She actually yelled at me for almost hitting her car.  It was at this time that I noticed the car on the left was as far left as she could go, the one on the right was as far right as she could go.  There was just *barely* enough room for a small sedan to pass in between these two idiots.  I needed to know that, because now *my* car stalled due to me slamming on the brakes and a slew of cars were cresting the top of the bridge and we now formed a wall of stupid across the bridge.

I put the car in neutral and coasted in front of the idiot on the left, restarted my car, and went about my day.  I have no doubt at least one of those two people that day has directly caused some kind of horrible car wreck.  I still don't know who is dumber, the woman stalled (out of gas I believe) on the downside of the bridge or the woman who decided to help by parking across from her and creating a little gauntlet for other cars on this dark and misty night."

Anything seems possible when walking out for the last time and truly realizing you never have to set one foot in that place again.  I highly, highly recommend it."
mildlyinfuriating,fcwawwb,t1_fcuauoo,1578021180.0,I agree. That is an actual reason to dislike the band. I said that it was stupid to dislike a band just because they got big.

mildlyinfuriating,fcu941w,t1_fcu2r94,1577975485.0,"It's not about giving less popular music a chance. I love bands that are probably never going to be heard by the bulk of people. The part that makes someone an ass is if they *stop* liking a band because they get popular. 

If a band you have liked forever gets some traction and people that would never have given them the time of day start enjoying them, you should be happy people are finding the band not immediately drop them because knowing the band doesn't make you special anymore. 

You should listen to music to enjoy music, not impress others. It's a subjective medium. Like what you like. Life is too short to cater to other people's tastes (if it is even *their* taste to begin with)."
CrappyDesign,fctjfea,t1_fct83zc,1577945377.0,Agreed. I find myself either swiping multiple times or the slightest swipe sends the focus across the screen. No in-between
CrappyDesign,fct6slk,t1_fct05mv,1577934370.0,"I would hate that remote if some apps didn't need it to be so damn sensitive. Like, a fraction of a finger movement, mostly a tilt of the pad of my finger is enough to move it. It is fine 90% of the time, but the 10% when you need it to be less sensitive, it's infuriating."
woahdude,fcps8tr,t3_eifrr7,1577871021.0,I tried to follow the cuts. Don't.
