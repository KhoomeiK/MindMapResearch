I do get WHY the Afghanis/Iraqis are doing this. They don’t have great jobs/economy, their culture/religion forbids extramarital sex or drinking/drugs, so rhey might as well YOLO their life away by shooting at Americans. 

Just imagine if weed and booze were cheap, available and consumed in the Middle East in the quantities present in the West. We’d have peace overnight because the mujahideen will be pacified due to being stoned out of their minds."
