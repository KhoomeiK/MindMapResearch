AngionMethod,ffor8la,t1_ffoqvce,1580080757.0,Much obliged ;). Keep me posted on your progress?
AngionMethod,ffoqjuw,t1_ffopha1,1580080484.0,That is the eventual goal.
AngionMethod,ffoopta,t1_ffom8ll,1580080020.0,"I will be making an anouncement on that here soon. Because YouTube is coming under government sanctions and people are making it a political boxing arena, I will be migrating my platform near entirely over to Reddit."
AngionMethod,ffol7rr,t1_ffoj3mx,1580078840.0,"The best solution? Go for a brisk walk. Moving your legs will open up the blood vessels in your pelvic area and aid in your progression as a whole. Regular aerobic exercise is unquestionably important for growing a larger phallus. In that same line of thought, it will help facilitate a successful workout.

If that doesn't work, get back to me."
AngionMethod,ffoiytd,t1_ffoi4hi,1580078144.0,"Taking an educated guess, I'd say it comes down to abusing your muscles to keep erectile fullness. You, like many newcomers to the Angion Methods, most likely contracted your pelvic floor quite forcefully and many times in a row in an effort to push through a workout session."
AngionMethod,ffohc1h,t1_ffogzte,1580077644.0,Were your abs tense the whole time? As in you were leaning forward?
AngionMethod,ffogx2x,t3_eudlui,1580077523.0,...were you doing the exercise while being seated?
AngionMethod,ffnrxr0,t1_ffn5l84,1580069961.0,Just about anything over a 1000 to 1200 in a day is excessive.
AngionMethod,ffn2yws,t3_eu9bmd,1580061466.0,"Sounds scape goaty. The body quite literally needs sodium. That's because the human body is the equivalent of a bio-engine that runs off electricity. Sodium is needed to generate that electricity. The problem though is that while it has use in our nervous system, it plays hell on the rest of the body. Trying to shove an extra thousand milligrams plus into the body is mostly a great way to kill yourself slowly and painfully. The hypertension destroys your delicate organs first. In most cases your pancreas is first to really get hit. Then your blood sugar crops up and up eventually leading to pre-diabetes. The hypertension that was already slowly strangling your kidneys gets a decisive blow as climbing blood sugar levels further exacerbates poor circulation. Its at this point kidney function drops off and toxins begin accumulating in the body because the filtration system no longer works adequately.

Not even a century ago doctors and the like *knew* humans barely needed 800mgs of salt a day(and could thrive on that amount), but as more and more food giants couldn't keep products on the shelf long enough to be profitable without gobs of salt and presevatives, they did the only thing they could to keep the money flowing. They hired professional politicians to lobby for them and then heavily invested in stopping or changing the flow of research in their favor. Since that day, recommended salt levels have climbed astronomically."

AngionMethod,ffm8y3z,t3_eu4cxn,1580050642.0,I never recommend mixing my methodology with traditional PE techniques.
AngionMethod,ffi5vm0,t1_ffhzlwo,1579965907.0,"The Angion Methods are never meant to be used with any great deal of force. The exercises are inherently very low key. So long as you are not trying to dig your thumbs into the shaft while performing the exercise or applying a lot of unnecessary compression, there should be no issues. To properly perform Angion Method 1.0 you only need to apply enough compression to depress the deep dorsal vein. Also, as I stated prior, if you are still worried, you can always bump up to 2.0, its just that you will struggle a bit at the beginning."
AngionMethod,ffh22tf,t3_etiq5c,1579921025.0,"We don't really worry about working the superficial dorsal vein. 1.0 primarily focuses its stimulation on the Deep Dorsal Vein, so this loop shouldn't be an issue. In the event that it does cause issue though, you could try and skip 1.0 and move up to 2.0. The only thing would be that you'll lose fullness and your erection a lot in the beginning because you'll be constantly fighting that arterial insufficiency nearly all men present with before undertaking targeted vascular network based exercise."
AngionMethod,ffh1rci,t1_ffgimm5,1579920785.0,"Potentially different focus. Potentially. I need to study and observe a bit more to make a conclusive statement one way or the other on that note.

On the topic of using the wheel on the dorsal side of the member...yeah haven't bothered doing that one. Not enough tissue mass work with the wheel. The main reason why the Corpora Spongiosum is such an ideal target is because it exists underneath the Bucks and Dartos fascial layers and not the tunica albuginea. This means it doesn't present with rigidity even with extreme fullness and therefore an ideal target for fluid displacement with an implement like the Angio-Wheel."
AngionMethod,ffg4a52,t1_ffffno9,1579898145.0,Chlorine is not harmless..Its like liquid death for blood vessels.
AngionMethod,ffg480o,t1_ffg2nt2,1579898109.0,Perhaps in the future. For now I may just do some overhauling to the current subreddit.
AngionMethod,ffg43em,t3_etd7uu,1579898029.0,"Having extensively experimented with this concept, I can tell you right off the bat that Angio-Wheel use while heavily erect(hardness with extreme fullness and overlaying softness.) versus heavy engorgement, presents with a peculiar feel that emanates from deep within the groin/pelvic area."
AngionMethod,ffetdhs,t1_ffe3a6y,1579864620.0,"Its not the cholesterol so much that stunts blood flow. Its free radical accumulation and left over synthetic hormones shot or fed into the animals that causes the greatest issues talking about meat. Also, immune responses. Meat basically causes a systemic shock reaction leading to the formation of Anti-bodies that inadvertently attack the body itself. Animals share waaaay too many genetic similarities to humans. Plants do not and therefore are much less likely to cause immuno-based reactions. Also, not always talked about(more like hardcore swept under the rug) bacterial infestation. Cooking kills a lot of bacteria, but in reality it only lowers it to what is considered ""safe levels"". Animals nowadays are put through the equivalent of the goddamn holocaust and come to develop lethal and chronic diseases from living in such tight filthy quarters until they are butchered and people subsequently eat them. Being just open faced about it, eating meat that is produced the way it is today is the equivalent of continually/chronically infecting yourself with softcore plague.

Also, absolutely everyone is salt sensitive. Biochemically salt sensitive. You cannot eat a high salt diet and not impair vascular healing and remodeling. Its literally impossible to do. They put salt in food because it inhibits bacterial growth and movement. It does the exact same thing to your endothelial cells. Salt, especially sodium chloride, is basically a cytotoxin. Yes, sodium is needed since our body is basically complicated electrical equipment and it uses sodium and potassium for charging the ol' batteries so to speak, but common sodium derivatives like NaCl are f-u-c-k-i-n-g t-o-x-i-c."
AngionMethod,ffermnb,t1_ffco6d2,1579862136.0,"Its an effect of properly performing the exercise usually, unless you just switch over from traditional PE. Then it could be something else. Static stretching based exercises don't do nice things to the venous cluster coming off the dorsal side of the penis. Its very common for men who previously did a lot of static stretching to report pain initially."
AngionMethod,fferio3,t1_ffd5wdc,1579861970.0,"Its a lot like bodybuilding where once your muscles have developed to a point where you can lift heavier weights, you'll only lose progress by trying to return to lifting lighter weights. The Vascular networks are similar. Once they are large enough to support a higher amount of flow, they need increasing bouts of stimulation to effectively grow."
AngionMethod,ffer1v5,t3_eswch0,1579861274.0,"Yeah. ThundersPlace banned me and my work. Any posts mentioning my work usually gets attacked by vested interests. Zero joke. Its the same exact story for nearly any major forum. This comes down to the fact that everything I espouse massively calls into question the safety and efficacy of traditionally upheld forms of PE among other things. Also, people constantly ask a slew of similar questions on big forums as well. Excited newbies be excited newbies lol."
AngionMethod,ffcet2g,t1_ffc8u17,1579797921.0,"Prior to the Angion Methods, no such luck. Now though, I'm like the sexual equivalent of the Energizer Bunny."
AngionMethod,ffcen4h,t3_esvfmu,1579797820.0,"Arteries have no internal structures that flow reversal could damage unlike veins that present with valves. So, no worries.

AngionMethod,ffa2txg,t1_ff7q0an,1579726763.0,Tumor growth and healthy angiogenesis are not the same things. Tumors occur due to biological hijacking typically by fungal infections or pathological bacteria. That means they are growing independently of bodily hormonal signaling and are usually producing their own chemical factors. That's why you don't need to be in a caloric surplus or sometimes even be eating at all for that matter for tumors to grow. They live off the sugars and fatty acids in your blood like a parasite.
AngionMethod,ffa2e7k,t1_ff8angc,1579726515.0,"What's changed in the following areas:

AngionMethod,ffa25tg,t1_ff8tyup,1579726379.0,"I've penetrated pussy so good that I came before I could park against the backwall. Sometimes good pussy is good pussy. Its not a problem if you pop fast initially. Just don't stop there. Most partners don't really care so long as you leave em creamy(not cum in them). And by that , I mean you got her off good enough to make her cervix squirt some slime. Get her cervix to start giving you kisses, it don't much matter."
AngionMethod,ffa18xs,t3_escxn9,1579725847.0,Standing huh? I'm really curious how you tilt your pelvis when do the exercise. A few guys have mentioned doing something similar to this in the past.
AngionMethod,ff7d851,t3_es1iho,1579646852.0,"I've also noted similar instances to what you describe, and you are right. They do engage it in different ways. When I was creating them though, my main focus was on escalating the degree of shear stress felt by the local pathways for increased vascular developments.  Still though, I'm happy to see someone putting more thought into the subject. This is one of the ultimate reasons for starting this community. Posts just like this one. Because its posts just like this that lead to further innovations."
AngionMethod,ff6wlrf,t1_femngtd,1579636386.0,"There is some merit to that type of approach, but arteries have a built-in defense mechanism related to shear based mechanics that causes flow reduction in a relatively short period of time. So, the individual instance of constriction can only last for an incredibly short period of time. Like less than 3-5 seconds respectively. After that, there is a constriction period that will continue until vasoactive chemicals react to reduced oxygen levels. By that point though, its serious and considered a last ditch effort to avert tissue death."
AngionMethod,ff6vpt7,t3_ervwt7,1579635858.0,give the sticky at the top of the thread a read.

So, you don't necessarily need to pull back on Angion Method use or doing routine cardio(in fact I strongly recommend continuing the latter). But I do want to curb your expectations in that you most likely won't see any size gains while under eating. You will still most likely see improved fullness, color, sensitivity, etc. But size gains won't really happen until you are in a caloric surplus consistently."
AngionMethod,ff5z8rx,t1_ff5lq1u,1579614956.0,Stomach sleeping is very hard on the penis. It essentially stems blood flow and also reduces tissue perfusion. You'd see a lot of erectile health improvements if you switched to sleeping on your back or sides.

AngionMethod,ff4wb0h,t1_ff4q9y2,1579573988.0,Typically yes. That's how the body normally handles it. The problem though is that if you are eating the same diet that caused the plaque...it will most likely get worse. Good Diet and clean healthy arteries are synonymous. Bad diet and clogged pipes are too. The best diet for clean arteries is a plant based variety.

AJelqForYou,fei3we7,t1_fehv3js,1579129718.0,"I tore the tunica over my left corporal body and experienced a depressurizing event. It left me completely unable to get an erection on my own. I could get some blood flow and very minimal fullness but nothing beyond that point. Had I not done the improvised therapy, I would most likely have never regained function."
AJelqForYou,feh4p41,t1_fegut9m,1579109086.0,"My final word on the topic would be thus:

If I cannot dissuade you from more dangerous means of force application such as you describe with torsion, it becomes unquestionably imperative to be mindful of bodily responses both in the short and long term. This means taking regular and thorough notes in a notebook if possible. I only made it to where I am now by obsessively examining my bodily responses to a myriad of factors.

This was how I came to develop what I call the Fourfold Path:

1. Clean bulking based dietary intakes
2. Systemic vascular network activation/stimulation
3. Localized vascular network activation/stimulation
4. Localized tissue mass based stimulation

Each step must occur in the order I have listed or the cycle of gains comes to a grinding halt. It is perhaps the greatest of the lessons I could teach."
AJelqForYou,feh3ydo,t1_feh3bzy,1579108648.0,"Really concentrating all of my work into a singular phrase, it would be as follows:

""*Chase the pump""*

Meaning, anything that contributes to the reduction of flow into or out of a given area will ultimately contribute to a tissue masses downfall.

While this is simple enough on the surface, it has widespread implications when examined over long periods of time. It is also extremely important to discern what kind of ""pump"" is occurring. This means being aware of discrepancies between mere edema and true vascular network activation."
AJelqForYou,feh3bzy,t1_fefdq6i,1579108281.0,"The concept of stressing a tunica or expanding it really isn't an issue I have. I think that it is indeed an important aspect to stressing a tissue mass to elicit growth. On this point we can surely agree. My main concern, really almost the anathema of my existence, is the widespread misconception of not only how should be gone about, but also the after effects of such an endeavor.

Something that took years to wrap my head around was how vascular networks proliferate, spread, and ultimately contribute to the growth of a tissue mass.

Vascular tissue, both smooth muscle and endothelial phenotypes strongly recognize and subsequently respond to stretch. However, the type in question is a matter of serious consideration.

Whenever I began my journey/descent into all of this, I was strongly in favor of the latter. This being static based applications, but the more I learned about the intricacy of vascular muscle tissue types and how much they share with skeletal muscle based muscle types in terms of their base responses to stretch, that was when I departed from static applications. The final departure was my life altering injury. I tore my tunica so severely as to be forced to come up with an improvised form of therapy to heal myself. This was a crude version of Angio-Pumping that I have described recently in my Angion Methods Complete listing at the top of the Angion Methods forum.

What it made me realize is that in order to break down and remodulate connective tissue layers successfully, we must strongly encourage the vascular components of a tissue mass to seed within their strata and ultimately overtake the tissue mass.

By doing so, I was able to grow at an astounding rate with extremely few negative side effects, if really any worth noting.

Basically, in order to achieve a larger penis/tissue mass, its important to reflect upon not merely the instance of damage, but its after effects. Therein lies a deeper understanding which eventually contributes to a heightened awareness with regards to bodily responses. In otherwords, by using prolonged reflection, we can more appreciably develop an almost intuitive understanding of our body."
AJelqForYou,fegut9m,t1_fefdq6i,1579103021.0,"I think we are hearing each other here, but I still think you are seriously underestimating the kind of harm twisting a tissue and then applying load can do. You get any kind of engorgement going on or god forbid reflexively kegel and the tunica wall could snap like wet Styrofoam. If that happens, you'll almost assuredly get nerve damage in the process. I don't care how many people swear by it, that kind of an injury--there is no coming back. It will haunt you for the rest of your days and probably destroy your sexual function right along with it. First hand experience with tunica trauma here. I got exceedingly lucky in that I didn't snap a nerve during my injury, but the tear/snap that would occur under torsion will be long, nasty, and deep. You'll also get no warning but the sound of a wet crackle when it happens, then blinding pain. It is not worth it."
AngionMethod,fegtlef,t3_eoy5l6,1579102236.0,"Tunica barriers will not prevent gaining. It really doesn't work that way since the growth occurs via endothelial cell migration and subsequent channel musclularization. Basically, your tunica layers will do little to hinder things in the long term."
AngionMethod,feezkdk,t3_eotiye,1579044697.0,My methodology hasn't been out long enough for anyone to have reached that goal. I might be pretty close though to nearly that much gains in about a year-ish.

AJelqForYou,feef7e0,t1_feed5ts,1579032518.0,"I'm not terribly good at TL;DR-ing. Learn. Read.

The motions would be a corporal body based squeeze where palm and finger tips cyclically clamp the chambers whilst avoiding pressure elsewhere, therefore directly targeting the main bodies."
AJelqForYou,fee234p,t3_eoizhz,1579024790.0,"Clamping at lower erection levels...well...Really traditional clamping period is just about a waste of time. The penis is designed to ruthlessly exploit fluid displacement. Every time a compressive force is applied to the penis, blood is made to be exchanged between the arterial and venous networks. More specifically, the arterial networks within the corpora cavernosum and the veins that exist just over top the outer layer directly underneath the Bucks Fascia wrap.

This whole idea of doing bundled stretches is ridiculous and egregiously dangerous(not a personal attack--just my thoughts on the concept as a whole). I'd bitch slap the guy who came up with them just about senseless if I could. Trying to spin or warp the penis and then apply load is just asking(begging) for injury. Please, skip entirely over it. You really really don't want the type of injury those kinds of self abuse can cause. I've seen the aftermath...surgery is just about the only option to fix it, but even that won't do much if you tore a nerve in the process(which tends to happen due to the torsion when the tunica snaps/goes).

Instead...if you want girth gains. Why not just try and apply cyclic squeezes where your fingers and thumb pressed upon the corporal bodies? We cannot stop the fluid displacement since the male member was specifically designed to exploit this principle. Instead, by using a more forceful cyclic squeeze, you encourage the process but still get the pleasant stretch on the main bodies you desire. And to finish, you could do some fullness training like the Angion Methods. While many still do not believe me when I say they work as a stand alone for gaining, just about everywhere can agree its an enormous supplement for aiding in the gaining process. Plus by doing the fullness training after the fact, you can re-open the resistance vessels and see a nice bit of post workout fullness that way.

Just a note at the end, I have experimented with this approach some myself while researching the Macropulse. Heavy engorgement without rigidity works the best. Also, switching up the timing. You can temporarily hold the squeeze for a few seconds and then rapidly pulse the squeezes to control fullness. This is a crude means of controlling flow regulated vasodilation. Also, once you get good enough at the process, you should be able to actually *feel* the internal bodies(the corpora cavernosum) just under the Bucks layer. It feel almost like when you have a glove on over top another with water between the two. You can feel it(though it is subtle) when you come into contact with the underlying layer.

Also, small closing note, discrepancies men notice between flaccid stretched length and erect length is because of separation of the Buck fascia from the Tunica Albuginea. The glans, technically, only loosely connects to the dense underpinning of the Tunica Albuginea. Its more like a densely vascular coupling that passes through the Bucks fascia(and is somewhat susceptible to certain forms of blunt laterally applied force \***Don't ask its fucked up**\*). I mention this because clamping almost always causes this form of separation when statically applied and will therefore almost universally cause EQ issues. Men have contacted me about this wondering whether not it is a form of venous leakage when in reality it fits under fascia based trauma. The blood vessels are working exactly as they should but the hemodynamics of the penis have been damaged to due improperly applied force/poorly designed techniques. Eventually, if the problem gets too far out of hand, they won't be able to get an erection normally anymore without constrictive bands to keep blood from flowing out since the Bucks fascia will no longer fit snugly against the tunica albuginea. They also won't actually get rigid anymore due to the hemodynamic changes caused by the layer separation. There are ways to fix that, but you can't really address the issues with standard PE, instead you've got to use stuff from my side of the fence to basically tone and tighten that layer using cyclically applied stretches."

Meat basically causes a systemic shock reaction leading to the formation of Anti-bodies that inadvertently attack the body itself. Animals share waaaay too many genetic similarities to humans. Plants do not and therefore are much less likely to cause immuno-based reactions. Also, not always talked about(more like hardcore swept under the rug) bacterial infestation. Cooking kills a lot of bacteria, but in reality it only lowers it to what is considered ""safe levels"". Animals nowadays are put through the equivalent of the goddamn holocaust and come to develop lethal and chronic diseases from living in such tight filthy quarters until they are butchered and people subsequently eat them. Being just open faced about it, eating meat that is produced the way it is today is the equivalent of continually/chronically infecting yourself with softcore plague.

Also, absolutely everyone is salt sensitive. Biochemically salt sensitive. You cannot eat a high salt diet and not impair vascular healing and remodeling. Its literally impossible to do. They put salt in food because it inhibits bacterial growth and movement. It does the exact same thing to your endothelial cells. Salt, especially sodium chloride, is basically a cytotoxin.

If I cannot dissuade you from more dangerous means of force application such as you describe with torsion, it becomes unquestionably imperative to be mindful of bodily responses both in the short and long term. This means taking regular and thorough notes in a notebook if possible. I only made it to where I am now by obsessively examining my bodily responses to a myriad of factors.

This was how I came to develop what I call the Fourfold Path:

1. Clean bulking based dietary intakes
2. Systemic vascular network activation/stimulation
3. Localized vascular network activation/stimulation
4. Localized tissue mass based stimulation

Each step must occur in the order I have listed or the cycle of gains comes to a grinding halt. It is perhaps the greatest of the lessons I could teach."

""*Chase the pump""*

Meaning, anything that contributes to the reduction of flow into or out of a given area will ultimately contribute to a tissue masses downfall.

While this is simple enough on the surface, it has widespread implications when examined over long periods of time. It is also extremely important to discern what kind of ""pump"" is occurring. This means being aware of discrepancies between mere edema and true vascular network activation."
AJelqForYou,feh3bzy,t1_fefdq6i,1579108281.0,"The concept of stressing a tunica or expanding it really isn't an issue I have. I think that it is indeed an important aspect to stressing a tissue mass to elicit growth. On this point we can surely agree. My main concern, really almost the anathema of my existence, is the widespread misconception of not only how should be gone about, but also the after effects of such an endeavor.

Something that took years to wrap my head around was how vascular networks proliferate, spread, and ultimately contribute to the growth of a tissue mass.

Vascular tissue, both smooth muscle and endothelial phenotypes strongly recognize and subsequently respond to stretch. However, the type in question is a matter of serious consideration.

Whenever I began my journey/descent into all of this, I was strongly in favor of the latter. This being static based applications, but the more I learned about the intricacy of vascular muscle tissue types and how much they share with skeletal muscle based muscle types in terms of their base responses to stretch, that was when I departed from static applications. The final departure was my life altering injury. I tore my tunica so severely as to be forced to come up with an improvised form of therapy to heal myself. This was a crude version of Angio-Pumping that I have described recently in my Angion Methods Complete listing at the top of the Angion Methods forum.

What it made me realize is that in order to break down and remodulate connective tissue layers successfully, we must strongly encourage the vascular components of a tissue mass to seed within their strata and ultimately overtake the tissue mass.

By doing so, I was able to grow at an astounding rate with extremely few negative side effects, if really any worth noting.

Basically, in order to achieve a larger penis/tissue mass, its important to reflect upon not merely the instance of damage, but its after effects. Therein lies a deeper understanding which eventually contributes to a heightened awareness with regards to bodily responses. In otherwords, by using prolonged reflection, we can more appreciably develop an almost intuitive understanding of our body."

You get any kind of engorgement going on or god forbid reflexively kegel and the tunica wall could snap like wet Styrofoam. If that happens, you'll almost assuredly get nerve damage in the process. I don't care how many people swear by it, that kind of an injury--there is no coming back. It will haunt you for the rest of your days and probably destroy your sexual function right along with it. First hand experience with tunica trauma here. I got exceedingly lucky in that I didn't snap a nerve during my injury, but the tear/snap that would occur under torsion will be long, nasty, and deep.

More specifically, the arterial networks within the corpora cavernosum and the veins that exist just over top the outer layer directly underneath the Bucks Fascia wrap.

This whole idea of doing bundled stretches is ridiculous and egregiously dangerous(not a personal attack--just my thoughts on the concept as a whole). I'd bitch slap the guy who came up with them just about senseless if I could. Trying to spin or warp the penis and then apply load is just asking(begging) for injury. Please, skip entirely over it. You really really don't want the type of injury those kinds of self abuse can cause. I've seen the aftermath...surgery is just about the only option to fix it, but even that won't do much if you tore a nerve in the process(which tends to happen due to the torsion when the tunica snaps/goes).

Instead...if you want girth gains. Why not just try and apply cyclic squeezes where your fingers and thumb pressed upon the corporal bodies? We cannot stop the fluid displacement since the male member was specifically designed to exploit this principle. Instead, by using a more forceful cyclic squeeze, you encourage the process but still get the pleasant stretch on the main bodies you desire. And to finish, you could do some fullness training like the Angion Methods. While many still do not believe me when I say they work as a stand alone for gaining, just about everywhere can agree its an enormous supplement for aiding in the gaining process. Plus by doing the fullness training after the fact, you can re-open the resistance vessels and see a nice bit of post workout fullness that way.

Just a note at the end, I have experimented with this approach some myself while researching the Macropulse. Heavy engorgement without rigidity works the best. Also, switching up the timing. You can temporarily hold the squeeze for a few seconds and then rapidly pulse the squeezes to control fullness. This is a crude means of controlling flow regulated vasodilation. Also, once you get good enough at the process, you should be able to actually *feel* the internal bodies(the corpora cavernosum) just under the Bucks layer. It feel almost like when you have a glove on over top another with water between the two. You can feel it(though it is subtle) when you come into contact with the underlying layer.

Also, small closing note, discrepancies men notice between flaccid stretched length and erect length is because of separation of the Buck fascia from the Tunica Albuginea. The glans, technically, only loosely connects to the dense underpinning of the Tunica Albuginea. Its more like a densely vascular coupling that passes through the Bucks fascia(and is somewhat susceptible to certain forms of blunt laterally applied force \***Don't ask its fucked up**\*). I mention this because clamping almost always causes this form of separation when statically applied and will therefore almost universally cause EQ issues. Men have contacted me about this wondering whether not it is a form of venous leakage when in reality it fits under fascia based trauma. The blood vessels are working exactly as they should but the hemodynamics of the penis have been damaged to due improperly applied force/poorly designed techniques. Eventually, if the problem gets too far out of hand, they won't be able to get an erection normally anymore without constrictive bands to keep blood from flowing out since the Bucks fascia will no longer fit snugly against the tunica albuginea. They also won't actually get rigid anymore due to the hemodynamic changes caused by the layer separation. There are ways to fix that, but you can't really address the issues with standard PE, instead you've got to use stuff from my side of the fence to basically tone and tighten that layer using cyclically applied stretches."

In terms of the process of gaining, nearly all the information needed to accomplish such a feat, is already publicly available or currently for sale. However, I am after a somewhat lofty goal. I'm set to break my lifelong goal of 9by6 here soon. When that happens, I'll be inevitably setting my sights on 10by7 or thereabout. That kind of a goal will eventually require performance enhancers.

AngionMethod,fdmo7kz,t3_em6ojd,1578557713.0,"You can't typically. This arterial insufficiency most men present with would make it literally impossible to utilize the exercise properly. Within reason, the exercises are somewhat idiot proofed as they would say in the engineering world. About the only real exercise that *could* present with issue would be 2.0 if you mistimed your squeezes. You could potentially pop a blood vessel, but that likelihood is very very small given the glans usually does not store nearly enough blood for the squeeze to distend the outgoing venous networks enough for this possibility to be even remotely likely. You would also need to be using a totally different means of gripping the shaft. Say wrapping your fingers entirely around the shaft instead of using the gentle C-clamp hand technique that primarily relies upon gentle squeezes applied with the end of your fingers and thumb on either side of the male member. Basically, the potential for injury is extremely low."
AngionMethod,fdmnse3,t1_fdmng0o,1578557179.0,"If I had to guess, venous trauma. Most likely from either static stretching or jelqing.

AJelqForYou,fdjjoes,t3_elg7gj,1578473961.0,"Mixture of improved EQ as others have mentioned, but also responsiveness..

Truth be told, I think that nearly all PE programs are completely and totally over the top. Professionally, I watch bodybuilders overtrain themselves into a corner all the time. Even with performance enhancing drugs on the take, they expect too much of themselves. Guys with PE fall into an incredibly similar set of circumstances. The average PE routine is done almost compulsively with little to no breaks if we factor in things like masturbation and playing around. Few men have the mental tenacity/fortitude to just put it up and quit playing with it--*or at the very least don't know how to play with it productively.*

Most PE, with extremely few exceptions, needs to be undertaken on a 1on2off to a 1on3off depending. You can do recovery work during that down time, but the real phase of taxation needs long and regular windows between each session.

Basically, I think newbie gains happens in part because men slowly box themselves into a corner with overtraining in time...which only gets worse because they will almost unanimously and quite foolishly believe their penis has somehow ""toughened"", when in reality the repeated over taxation of the tissue has caused relevant receptor counts to plummet or using the incorrect form of stimulus and its subsequent compounding damage can no longer be overlooked or relatively masked by inflammation. Chronic re-injury and blunted inflammatory responses/pathways go hand in hand unfortunately and eventually contribute to debilitating and quite serious injuries.

Just summing everything up, the gains men experience as newbies should be viewed as the baseline in terms of bodily responsiveness. Gain rates should stay relatively stable well into several months worth of training to years depending."
