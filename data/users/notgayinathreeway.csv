gaming,ff3rv0g,t1_ff3o2d2,1579547501.0,"One time on Halo... 4? Reach? Maybe. One of the Halo's, my friend and I were on a team game where our whole team of randoms quit instantly against a full team of like level 50 generals. They refused to get the last point of whatever gametype we were playing where you have to put all of your flags inside of a designated area to capture it and gain a point. We couldn't get a single point, total map control. Like 7 minutes left in the game they just spawn killed us repeatedly with one point remaining to end the game. couldn't touch the flag to get a point if our lives depended on it. Absolute beatdown.

We changed tactics, determined to lose before the clock ran out, refusing to give them the satisfaction, we grabbed *their* flag and started running it to their objective for them.

 They noticed something was wrong right away and coordinated to stop us from losing. The battle raged on savagely, fighting every inch of their flag. They were thrown off a bit, they'd never practiced map control for defending against winning, it gave us an advantage, and a slim hope of losing the game. But then something unexpected happened. They started scoring our flag for us, but we had a lot of points to gain and time was running out quickly.

For almost the entire 7 minutes we pushed that flag, inch by inch, until finally we took control of their flag, planted it in our base and kept them at bay long enough for them to win the game and beat us, thus beating them to losing before they could force us to win, thereby winning the game, just seconds before time ran out.

EDIT: memories aren't perfect just enjoy the story. It was a variant of neutral flag called stockpile"
