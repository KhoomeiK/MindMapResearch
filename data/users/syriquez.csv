And a big focus of it was that it was more effective to just clear the first room in a big pull then immediately leave than to run the rest of the dungeon.

After that, 47-50 had a super awkward MSQ gap. You basically hit 46, had a few quests...then had nothing until 48. Then you would get to 49...and have yet another awkward MSQ gap because the quests didn't give you enough to get to 50.

This accomplishes three things.

1. It gets rid of the dipshits saying ""Abluhbluhbluhbluh, why do anything other than LotA if the rewards are the same, abluhbluhbluhbluh!""  
This was something an old MMO long ago figured out, City of Heroes. Content was put on a basically constant adjustment cycle over patches where the devs changed reward values based on average completion data.
2. It forces people to unlock the content if they want to do the roulette, eliminating the alleged ""more people have [x] unlocked"" excuse.
3. Doesn't let the devs pull the travesty of bullshit they've done to the Crystal Tower content where everything is so boneshittingly easy and boring that it's disgusting.

If Orbonne takes three times longer to complete on average, then I doubt most people are going to give a shit if they get it since they're looking at triple the reward.  
And here's the kicker: Failed instances should count as time lockouts. So now your dipshit playerbase suddenly has a chance at seeing content that is explicitly worth more. Say Orbonne is worth four times as much because of this adjustment... Based on my historical data, this would make it outright superior to LotA and Syrcus for the average time to complete.

The thing that's so fucking dumb about this is that they already scale rewards on a bunch of roulettes. At least for experience, Rathalos coming up in Trial Roulette is a bizarre situation because it's worth like a third of a level at 79 and makes Trial Roulette THE best time expenditure for experience if you luck out on getting it.

Lastly, the devs should publish the completion data. Would never happen but it'd be nice for the sake of proving points openly."

I'm pretty sure that a bunch of random players going in at minimum item level actually could not beat Glasya in one shot. Especially if they didn't have someone calling shots to hold their hands through the raid.

1. The little clockwork drones that pop up everywhere that people normally ignore? They're mandatory if you can't get him to skip phases through sufficient DPS.  
Basically, they charge up his version of Elixir Field, which I think is called something like ""Deathstream"". If it gets to full, it does something like 20,000 damage to the arena. Obviously an instant death at that range.
2. He does the annoying spinning discs of death (Hunter's Moon or whatever it is) that the adds in World of Darkness do during the Atomos fight. Except his deal like 5 times as much damage and are HUGE.
3. Eventually he summons a bunch of clockwork adds on the platforms outside. Clockwork knights on the outer platforms are now charging his Deathstream attack. I don't remember but I believe he goes immune and the main arena electrifies as well.  
Your goal then is to hop onto the platforms and kill the adds on them. By doing so, you unlock the next platform until you can get to the clockwork knights. These guys are building the charge on the Deathstream attack.  
And you're still not done. You have to kill the clockwork knights which unlock ANOTHER platform and then you have to get back off of the outer ring because Deathstream, no matter the charge, explodes all the platforms and will kill anyone still out there.

> Five-Headed Dragon

There aren't a lot of mechanics this boss does that you don't normally see already. The only thing that might throw people off is Heatwave which applies the Pyretic status. Pyretic causes you to take a ton of damage for doing ANYTHING. Moving. Casting. Attacking. *Auto-attacking.*  
This pops up in a handful of other places but Pyretic is probably the most uncommon status effect in the game.

* Purple marker/lightning bolt: ***This is a stack mechanic.*** It predates the modern stack icon which was added for Thordan EX/Void Ark's patch and has been standard ever since.
* The poison puddle will generate slimes unless people eat the puddle by standing in it. Standing next to a small slime that dies will give you a poison resistance buff which greatly reduces the damage of the poison puddle. Slimes will join together and eventually explode dealing a bunch of damage and also silence the entire raid for like 10 seconds (which is easily enough to wipe the raid if you're not at max item level for it).
* Prominence--the big white orbs--will eventually explode if not destroyed, dealing a lot of damage. I think they each deal 5000 which basically means the raid will wipe if both are left alone.

Here's one that people probably have no idea about: The lightning orb pillars in the Scylla fight of Syrcus Tower.  
It's basically the same mechanic as Ancient Flare.

Eventually Scylla starts casting a spell that will petrify the raid for like a minute.

Change how Limit Breaks function: Give every job the ability to use ST, AOE, Heal, and Shield Limit Breaks. Add animations as such.

ST: Triggers by targeting an enemy, still requires melee range.  
AOE: Triggers by having no enemy targeted and produces a reticle like the current caster LBs (subsequently alter the effect shape/area of existing physical ranged LBs).  
Heal: Triggers by targeting a teammate (additional: make the fucking radius 45y).  
Shield: Triggers by targeting self.

I know that what this basically means is that 100% of the time, healers or tanks would be put on task to use Limit Breaks but in casual content, I'd be okay with that. *Simply because it would mean the fucking things would actually get used.*"

At least on Aether, the norm is that about half of the time, none of the tanks want to pull. And when one finally does pull (usually the one that had their stance off initially because the other two had their stances on...assuming they would pull...), it turns into an aggrowank session. Usually with the raid getting cleaved because the boss turns to scowl at the aggrowanker and burps on everyone in that one second.  
Most of the other half of the time, you have all three tanks fighting to pull and MT. Usually resulting in the same situation of the boss puking on the raid in the process while it's spinning like a top.  
And in that infinitely rare situation of the remaining percentage points, everybody does what they're supposed to and nobody aggrowanks and the OTs actually offtank the adds. I've seen it happen, so I know it's possible.

The most offensive thing about the moron tanks is that they'll inevitably die for whatever reasons then immediately Provoke before they've had a single tick of health regen. And then repeat that behavior for the next 2 deaths."

Dude's overall plan was BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION that he would cause a ton of deaths, civil unrest, and probably a total destabilization of Eorzea. But he would *likely* be in prime position to reap the short term rewards on it. He openly did not give a shit about how his actions would negatively impact in the long term. And he was basically *glad* for the opportunity to cause problems since it could ""provide opportunities"". So it's not even necessarily that he had plans for every negative thing but that he assumed he could make shit work even in the most unexpected circumstances. He *knows* what he's doing is evil, acknowledges it, and then openly disregards it.

And his argument for it is that he's simply upholding the ideals of pure capitalism. Which is what makes Lolorito funny in that while he has a patriotic streak to his actions, he's still a superior pragmatist and capitalist. Sure, Teledji's gambling COULD pay off but it's nowhere near low risk. Versus Lolorito's outlook that they can make a point of having an extremely wealthy, safe, strong homeland which is guaranteed to pay off in the long run. Especially if friendly, *very powerful* allies are willing to work with them and provide favors.

Even when this is pointed out, Teledji basically goes ""Eh, I'm twirling my mustache right now so your argument is invalid!""

The closest equivalent would be Unguest. But he's a cowardly small fry by comparison to Teledji's grand schemes.

Most of the really shitty people in the story often have a sympathetic side to their behaviors and actions. Often, it comes down to very scared people acting [for the Greater Good.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUpbOliTHJY)

Thordan and the HW, while on the ultimate goal of conquest, still acted in what they perceived to be the correct course for Ishgard into the future.

Asahi, while an enormous piece of shit, was still put into his situation through the environment of his upbringing. And his motivation was still driven by what he felt was the absolute only correct choice in terms of improving the world. With a healthy serving of deluded hero worship.

Don't even need to go into Yotsuyu's situation.

Varis was hopelessly deluded after learning too many truths in too short of a time. And facing no good answers, his plan of action could still be argued as him trying to find a single answer that leads to a better future.

A MOTHERFUCKING TANK USES THE LIMIT BREAK. And keeps fucking doing it during the first attempt, SOMETIMES THE SECOND ATTEMPT AS WELL. I don't know when and where the fuck this behavior popped up but I've been seeing it goddamn constantly since like April of last year.

I wouldn't consider this a problem normally but because it's fucking Trial Roulette, most of the players there have actually played and lost at Russian Roulette.  
So:

* Casters/Ranged trying to catch meteors and doing zero dps on the Tear that can't be LB3'd because they're fucking dead
* Healers dying because if they're level 80 they have no idea how to heal without 5000 ""i m heelur"" oGCD buttons that make shit too fucking easy

* Melee DPS being bad as per usual but also can't LB3 due to aforementioned moron tank

Wikis are not always updated or correct, sadly, and The Lore Train doesn't always have what I'm looking for.

The Lore boards on the Official Forums is a pretty good option as people there tend to give sources or quotes for things if at all possible. In-game, there's various sources like Erik for the 30-50 Monk questline. Or the Encyclopedia Eorzea volumes.

> Why is aether required for life? We all know that an area being drained of aether is a No Good Very Bad Thing, but what goes on in between a place being fine and being like the Burn, or having no aether at all?

Aether makes up everything in the FF14 world. That includes both physical and non-physical things as a pervasive supernatural energy. It acts on the physical, mental, and spiritual.

The quest chatter for the Ridorana Lighthouse raid talks about this where you can actually *detect* thoughts and emotion by measuring Aether.

> Do we have separate terms for ""primal"" as in the mythical figure being worshipped vs. ""primal"" as in the summoned physical entities that the WoL is perennially called upon to disperse?

The basic summary of FF14 theology up to the current plot is ""man created god in his image"". The inspiration for many Primals can be loosely connected to stories of the Twelve, the pantheon for the humanoid races. And that pantheon is pretty much mocked by the Ascians for being absolutely no different from the beliefs that shape the Primals.

> How exactly is a primal's behavior shaped by its summoners and other worshippers? When followers have conflicting beliefs about what they want a primal to do, who wins?

The idea is that the most fervent and emphasized desire and belief at the moment of summoning while still aligning with the overall shape of the worship drives the formation of the Primal's mental state. So the prisoners that witness the summoning of a Primal don't have much of an effect on its form or mental attributes, even if they obviously are in a high emotional state full of terror at what's happening. They don't worship the Primal, so they aren't praying and thus not offering their thoughts to it.

But if, for instance, a grief-stricken child is in the area of summoning that believes in the god but also has a powerful mental state to drive its formation.........

> Is ""only one manifestation at a time"" indeed a hard rule of primal summoning? (Allagan research into containing primals, and indeed Alexander's story itself, would suggest so, but just to check.) Is that the only rule regarding when a primal can be summoned, given enough prayer and aether?

There isn't a hard answer on it. But the idea seems to be that once ""something"" has arisen to take on the concept it's supposed to represent, it dominates all ideas of that entity and usurps any prayers and Aether directed towards it. And this would be true even if one group's view of the representative god's ""true"" behavior is 100% opposite of what was actually created by the summoning ritual. We have some suggestions of this being the case through the ARR Beast Tribes where they pretty much all make a point that they refuse to worship while the ""false idols"", so to speak, are active. As they know it only aids the monster.  
Tiamat talks about her regret over the creation of Primal Bahamut as she realized immediately that what they had done was merely create a perversion in his image. And this perversion served to basically ""consume"" her grief over the real Bahamut's death. So now she couldn't even mourn Bahamut and was stuck in that state while Calamity Bahamut was still trapped inside Dalamud for thousands of years.

Summoners cheat this limitation by essentially recording the Primal's form by the act of witnessing it and bathing in its Aetherial mist when it dies. After that, they simply ""playback"" the recording by feeding it some of their own Aether to create the Egi."
ffxiv,fcwkwkx,t1_fcvkts6,1578028463.0,"> Cutting through all the “embrace your inner darkedy dark dark emo” flavor

It's less about being full of anger or wallowing in negative emotions than embracing passion or intensity thereof. Losing yourself in the emotion itself is actually a mistake and it's more about directing the energy of that emotion into actionable power through conviction.

Living Dead is the the idea of refusing to back down even when all of the odds are against you. Even when you're doubting yourself.  
Carve & Spit is the idea of acting for those that lack the will or capability to do what needs to be done. Yet still respecting the wishes of those you desire to help.  
TBN is the idea of never allowing another friend to fall in front of you. But also recognizing that you need to stand for yourself just as much as others if you wish to succeed at keeping everyone.

With the role quests, we don't really have a theme for Living Shadow but it's basically a game mechanic version of the events of the Stormblood job quests.

> How does Dark Knight Magic work? 

The basic techniques are based on old Ishgardian martial traditions that became taboo as a result of the original Dark Knight (summary: Temple Knight slays a clergyman in fury for killing an orphan *and then making their crimes worse,* except the establishment doesn't give a shit about orphans or corruption, stripping the knight of his rank and title even after winning a trial by combat). Zephirin of the Heavens' Ward uses the martial techniques and is regarded relatively poorly for it because the taboo is so strong.

After that, the spells and specialty skills are where the ""emotion mage"" stuff comes into play. Knowing what we know now about Darkness-attributed Aether, the idea of it being about embracing the opportunity to act with conviction is amusingly apropos."

1. Most Jobs can be viewed as having a tradeoff between their skill floor and their skill ceiling. It's not so simple as to say low floor/high ceiling and vice versa but generally, the easier it is to learn a Job, the worse tradeoff it will have in optimization. The following observations are made by my personal experience with the Job combined with looking at the CPM charts available on FFLogs. At the end of the day, SMN might feel like you're playing a piano but you're not smashing the keyboard anywhere near as hard as the NIN.
    * Low Floor; High Ceiling: BLM, SAM
        * BLM is not difficult to learn how to play by any stretch. Keep your cast bar going and you're good. The difficulty comes from it being mandatory that you know the shape and structure of fights better than a healer or tank. Mostly because you need to know how to handle curve balls. In order to keep casting, you've gotta know exactly where you can stand and what you can cheese.
        * SAM is similarly pretty easy to learn the basic mechanics on. The problem is that in optimizing SAM, you learn real quick that the Job is a hell of a lot faster than it appears at first glance. And small mistakes take absurdly long to ""correct"" in your performance. A mistake 2 minutes ago will still be annoying the shit out of you and on a chart, it will be hilariously obvious when and where you screwed up.
    * Medium Floor; Low Ceiling: MNK, DRG
        * MNK has a good amount of weird crap happening that gives it a more difficult appearance at a first glance. Its optimized opener has counter-intuitive trash in it (which I'm betting will see yet another revisit as 5.X rolls along) and of all the Jobs, learning its positionals to flawlessness is *absolutely critical.* For some, this can be frustrating. But at the same time, once you've got MNK down, it is by far one of the easiest Jobs to optimize, especially once you realize that the positionals barrier to entry basically vaporizes at high levels. There just isn't that much to improve once you've hit that base.
        * DRG is fairly easy to learn, has many tools for recovery, and its highest optimization includes an opportunity to *sit on* a proc for almost half a minute. It's extremely resilient to mistakes.
    * High Floor; High Ceiling: NIN
        * NIN has a special place of interest. It's difficult to learn AND difficult to optimize. And has the dubious honor of generally topping the charts in terms of casts per minute. While doing this, it doesn't particularly top the charts in terms of personal or raid DPS. Lots of work for not enough payout in my eyes. It's your punishment for that highly-coveted reduced falling damage trait.
    * High Floor; Medium Ceiling: SMN
        * SMN is without a doubt one of the most obnoxious DPS to learn and optimize. The basic concepts of the Job are not complicated but they don't flow together particularly well, which can make the Job feel clunky in weird places where it needs to *not* feel clunky. (Though it's a hell of a lot less ugly than it was a patch or two ago.) The real challenge with SMN is in the execution of all of those clumsy systems.
2. DPS in raids is better done looking at charts on FFLogs. The long and short of it is that the more a Job buffs the team, generally the less that it does in personal DPS or ""aDPS"". Which is offset on FFLogs by the raid DPS or ""rDPS"" value which tries to balance things out a bit more evenly (the MNK pulling 18000 aDPS is probably getting 3000 of that from the DNC, AST, and SCH buffing them).
3. Pick what you like, champ.
4. Flashy animations and big obvious effects, go to BLM and SMN. Flashy hits, go to SAM. Big ugly frog, go to NIN.
5. *Regularly* landing 6 digit hits out of SAM and BLM can be pretty satisfying.

The WoD deliberately chose to abandon their path and follow the Ascians to try and save their world. Ardbert was a half moment away from slaying the newly formed avatar of Hydaelyn in rage over feeling she had misled them into causing the Flood.

A Tempered individual is not going to have the freedom of will to seek the destruction of their god's newly-arisen mouthpiece. Nor are they going to doubt their god's motivations or actions. Are the WoD identical to us? Nope. But they sure do share a lot of our ""special"" traits (especially one in particular).

> What about our interactions with Midgarsormer disproves that we're Tempered, exactly?

The point of Midgardsormr's actions and observations of us is that he initially felt we were just ants relying on the power of Hydaelyn to succeed at anything. He decided during the travels of HW that this was decidedly *not* the case as he had blown away the power of the Crystals we had manifested and watched as we reignited their power *by our own actions.*  
Going further into that plot chain, we have Hraesvelgr: ""No. At the heart of your power is not the Blessing, or the Echo, or the Eye, it was you.""

This is a tenuous argument but the overall point of it is the idea that Midgardsormr would have been unlikely to entertain the ""test"" at all were he just dealing with a mind-controlled adherent. He was more than willing to simply kill us where we stood until it was made clear we were more than that.

> What about our interactions with the Scions disproves that we're Tempered, exactly?

""A primal's servant is betrayed by his aura. If you mean to conduct an investigation, I can identify any others acting under Sri Lakshmi's influence.""

> If the Ascians are Tempered, you have yet to give a good explanation for how it is that they are tempered by Zodiark, but our character miraculously is not?

Emet-Selch's statements are that he and the Ascians *willingly gave themselves* to Zodiark. Because that was explicitly the entire point of summoning him in the first place. They decided that their world was doomed and they needed a ""Will"" to exert control over everything to keep it all from falling apart. It isn't that Zodiark's Tempering is some kind of irresistible force, they literally summoned him with being Tempered as their desired goal. THIS IS WHAT MAKES EMET-SELCH AN UNRELIABLE NARRATOR. By all means, *he is not lying* when he says it was inevitable. But that's *his* understanding of their intended result when in the same discussion, he openly admits that they chose it as an absolute necessity to their goals.

This is the crux of the issue with claiming Hydaelyn has Tempered the WoL. Hydaelyn is the antithesis to the controlling ""Will"" of Zodiark. Rather than Zodiark's mission of all life requiring divine guidance to thrive, Hydaelyn's mandate is that divine guidance is entirely unnecessary and deserves free will. This makes the idea of Tempering explicitly against everything she was intended to stand for. And here's the thing: Hydaelyn is a veritable unknown in the world. We have a described Primal who shows zero drive in spreading worship of herself. The people that acknowledge Hydaelyn in any fashion barely number a handful and they're pretty much all Scions or directly involved with them.

Which once again, you *can* argue that it fits the definition...if you wish to make an incredibly crappy argument while doing so.

A retcon would be players suddenly getting the Garlean race as a player race and being told ""lol, now we're saying that they actually could always manipulate Aether"". THAT would be a retcon."

And besides that, at least get shit right. Solus wasn't even fucking dead at the start of ARR.

---

*ED* And the point I'm getting at is the original whiny git I responded to was treating retcons as dismissive, bad things.

A retcon, by definition, is the act of changing the interpretation of continuity through the act of altering, ignoring, or eliminating existing plot to better suit a new narrative. Could you argue the reveal was ""altering"" the plot? Sure. It doesn't change that it's a hilariously garbage argument to make. The overall interpretation of continuity hasn't changed. The Empire still found its rise through Solus as their veritable messiah of Magitech. Except now, as per the standard way things are handled, yeah, he was able to bring about those revolutions because he was an Ascian. Which honestly makes the whole concept of ceruleum technology and the insanely fast rise of a marginalized, tiny, and insignificant nation *less* silly.

The argument you're making is insane because it basically means you can't write ANYTHING new without it effectively being a dismissive retcon by excessively stretching the definition of the concept."

When ARR launched, Solus zos Galvus *was still alive.* The Garleans suddenly pulling out of Eorzea due to the civil war between Varis and his uncle was because of the sudden death of Solus and the fact that Gaius was out of commission due to our actions."

There is no confirmation even slightly remotely about the WoL being Tempered. And the suggestion of people with the Echo being capable of being Tempered is that they have to willingly suppress their innate immunity for it to happen.

Primals having very specific Aetherial signatures is an explicit plot point and is why the Scions all have those goggles.

And what we've learned of the Echo going into ShB beats the dead horse even further into dust.

*ED* I think one of the silliest things about this whole suggestion (plus the one about us being Tempered that always comes up) is that we have Krile. Krile who is as educated as Y'shtola on the same subjects, has the same tools, AND has the Echo. I think she'd be a pretty reliable reference for our status.

> This explains the losses we had on The First, as the people there didn't know about the WoL yet.

If you're talking about Spooky Scary Antagonist Guy, this is a combination of them desiring a spooky scary antagonist but not portraying what's happening very well. The narrative flow isn't communicated too strongly and is probably the only major weakpoint of ShB's story.

In the first encounter, he uses some kind of sucker punch special attack while we weren't ready. In the second, the idea is that we're not really interested in the fight and mostly stalling for time and dealing with the whole ""everything is blowing up around us"" problem. The last retreat is caused by there being more important things for, specifically us, to be doing.

1. Nissan anythings  
Nissan drivers are without a doubt the most consistently obnoxious fucks on the road. Part of the reason I upgraded my chosen vehicle this year was so that I had the power to blow these clownfucks out of the water when they insist on trying to do stupid fucking maneuvers at my expense. Your base model sedan with 180hp doesn't compare anymore, jackasses.
2. Jeep anythings  
Jeep drivers are people who have significantly more money than sense (or their parents'/partner's are the offenders) and subsequently drive like chucklefucks to support that observation. Also, the more tricked out a Jeep is with offroading gear and hilariously aggressive tire treads, the less likely it has or ever will touch mud in its entire lifetime.
3. Black Dodge Ram trucks  
Black Dodge Ram trucks must be the fleet vehicle of trucks. They're such a common offender that they actually require special mention separate from all other pickups. Because every 20-something year old with a <5 year old shiny and clean ""short bus truck"" (all cab, no bed, likely with no trailer hitch) either wearing a cap with a Fox logo or sporting a decal on their rear window is driving one of these things. I'm curious what percentage of their income remaining after food, rent, and utilities goes towards the payments.
4. The Usual Suspects plus the Newcomer!  
The ""Usual Suspects"" being Audi, BMW, Scion, Infinity, etc. Everybody knows the stories with these brands. The ""Newcomer"", though? That's Tesla. I don't see many Tesla vehicles in Minnesota. But literally every single one of them has drawn my attention simply because they pull some fucking stupid maneuver that I end up noticing the logo as a result.
5. Toy Trucks in general  
I live in a rural neighborhood and have a ~35 minute-ish drive into work. On one side of the ""Toy Truck"" coin, you have the office commuters driving a vehicle with an astounding 12 MPG highway. They drive like assholes, tailgate the fuck out of you, and will FOR WHATEVER FUCKING REASON, consistently pass you at the last fucking moment after riding your bumper for the entire length of a passing zone THEN GO SLOWER THAN YOU WERE ALREADY FUCKING DRIVING BEFORE THEY PASSED.  
On the other side of the ""Toy Truck"" coin, there are a LOT of lifted trucks that are sparkling in how clean they are. And don't have their lights aimed appropriately (and usually, have those fucking LED bars), don't have their bumpers within 6"" of original height, and don't have tire flaps like they're legally required to have because they bought their fucking kit at AutoZone and didn't do anything correct with it. And because the cops are fucking worthless pieces of shit, they'd rather pull the guy doing 60 in a 55 rather than get this shitbag that's tossing rocks and tailgating in a dangerous vehicle he can barely control.

Runner-up: Subaru (saying this as someone with an Outback...)  
Subaru has that status that Volkswagen used to enjoy. The vehicles are just expensive enough that they're not the most popular vehicles but their features lists and build qualities mean they're still highly desired and thus relatively common. This means they run the gamut of normal to enormously moronic. Mostly because I think they're becoming the new ""soccer mom"" car, instead of being the choice of mountain bikers and/or angry lesbians.

A <10 year old Subaru is basically impossible to predict. A >10 year old Subaru will generally drive aggressively but they're not suicidal/homicidal.

Interesting. My store said it was 45 minutes for 3k. And the managers would bitch us out for taking 60 minutes or more. We made our 45 minute unload about 70% of the time. 1.25 hours though? We made that 100% of the time, easily. Biggest delays usually came from uneven loads (tons and tons of HBA shit all in a row, making it awkward for the person on that pallet) or stuff like a solid inch and a half of maple syrup on the floor because 6 cases of Aunt Jemima's turned into pancakes at the bottom of a stack. Or the bleach avalanches. Those were always fun.

I think my favorite was grabbing the little brochure they had in the breakroom that talked about safety in the unload and learning that company policy was to switch out every 30 minutes or something like that. Yeah, we didn't do that.  
To be honest though, when I had that job, I vastly preferred to have a big, loaded truck than a tiny one. We occasionally would get those trucks that were half empty during slow periods and holy shit... I fucking HATED doing ad work. My back would be screaming after my shift if I got stuck doing ad because you're constantly at a bad angle the whole time digging at the stupid shelf label strips. At least in the truck or putting crap on the shelves, you can do proper lifting form and come out of it mostly okay for years.

Had dipshit bigwigs and analysts come through all the time to observe us unloading. Always had the mindset of like...""How the flying fuck are they expecting us to go any faster???"" I suspected but never knew the ACTUAL goal was closer to double what we were being told. Can only shake my head at it now I guess.

Explains a lot about why they put up with my surly, shitty attitude towards management, lol. Customers? Being unload/early mornings, I could find literally anything you wanted in that damn building near instantly. Repeat people would actually hunt me down in the morning to ask if they couldn't find something. Coworkers? Had no problem and the little old semi-retired lady constantly tried to foist baked treats on me. Immediate supervisor? Respected her quite a bit as she was 100% fair at all times. Being one of the ""team leaders"", she was basically dealing with corporate bullshit slightly more directly for like $1 more per hour than the rest of us.

But the actual managers? Haha, no. Never trusted them for a damn second and I let them know it, lol."

You missed the key point. I will highlight it for you.

The social (or formal) contract between an employee and an employer, particularly at the vulnerable level of a service or retail position, is *extremely* one-sided. The idea of forming a society is to try and level out imbalances such as these, if ever so slightly. This was also the point of unions in the absence of societal-granted protections but the average person is so mindlessly indoctrinated in 80 years of propaganda that they can't even conceive of the idea of thinking outside their preconceptions. At the end of the day, if an entrepreneur cannot reconcile their plans with the expectations of the society they reside within (in exchange for having a competent, healthy, baseline-educated workforce provided by that same society), then they were doomed and any other situation was simply providing fuel to an already-burning fire.

I get that this concept of a social contract flies over the head of the average American ""conservative"" but I'll just leave it at this because political discussions will get nowhere worth traversing on this site, *at best.*"

ffxiv,fbxoy2m,t1_fbx19kx,1577196303.0,"> Almost certainly engineered by the Ascians of course, but it seems as though there must be a corresponding calamitous event in the Source that kick-starts the flow of aether and begins a capital C Calamity. 

The entire end goal of Shadowbringers discussing the Calamities was to more or less summarize every Calamity as ""Ascians did it"". There's a reason why each one is focusing on a different elemental aspect each time, ever so conveniently. Each Shard is already slightly weighted towards one aspect and to cause a rejoining, both the Source and that Shard need to be out of balance simultaneously.

> Just as the Garleans don't use light magic, it stands to reason that even though the Mhachi and the Amdapori did not use water magic, some trigger in the middle of the war that likely somehow related to water must have caused the calamity.

The whole point of the WHM questline is basically them discussing how both the Mhachi and Amdapori had fucked up. The Mhachi were using nothing but Fire, Lightning, and Ice Aether while the Amdapori were all in on Earth and Wind. Nobody was using Water.

As an extension to that, after the final major battle between Amdapor and Mhach, both sides had realized something was extremely wrong with the elemental balance of Aether and saw ""holy fuck, Water is waaaaaay out of whack"". Which led to things like the Void Ark and the Grand Companies and blah blah blah.

---

Going back to the original discussion, we have a few key points about the Elementals' behavior. First, the Amdapori wanted to work with the Elementals and make more use of the Black Shroud but were rebuffed...*and chose to do nothing about it.* They weren't held at bay, they *allowed* the interaction to go that way. Second, the only action the Elementals took following the Calamity was to put a giant glamour over the city of Amdapor to make it impossible to find.

The Elementals aren't some unstoppable force. They're literally just Source Pixies. And while they're...problematic on the First, they're certainly not unstoppable. Kungfu Grandpa more or less proved that point. Hell, if you think about their influence on the birth of certain people... You have the Padjal that retain their child forms throughout life.

Nope. The mages of the era from all sides used ZERO Water-aspected Aether in any of their spellcasting. Because, once again, the Ascians engineered that result. The Elementals didn't do shit.

Making the Gridanians behave is a convenient way to keep the forest spirits from being annoying little shits (""angry pixies"" is basically what you should think about with them) and restricting the use of the greater magics is adopted in more than one culture over fear."
