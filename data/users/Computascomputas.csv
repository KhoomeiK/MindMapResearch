>I very specifically didn't say that because I very much do not think it's a wage to give an adult ""an enjoyable life"". It's a wage that lets you get by. **If you aspire to do more than simply get by, then contribute something more to society than bagging groceries.**
>

No changing your mind on that.
I think ALL jobs should provide more than something that ""lets you get by"" considering people have those jobs. Differing worldviews don't change on the internet.

>**Your comment really shows your own education with regards to how businesses are run.** 

Yours as well. Multiple studies (and repeated evidence) have shown increasing wages creates more jobs. Businesses can cut costs elsewhere as has been shown before. In fact, minimum wage was created partly to stabilize the job market. If people have more money, things can be purchased, which leads to growth and jobs.

>How much you're paid isn't about being ""lower humans"" than anyone else. It's about what you can contribute. 

I was specifically referring to the politicizing of lower class citizens as deserving it by the wealthier parts of the Republican party. ""Homeless? Get a job. Can't get a job? Too bad. Got a shitty job? Move. Can't move because you don't have enough money? Should have gotten a better job!""
There are lots of establishment Republicans against raising minimum wage, and against poor people in general.

And no, you don't get paid ""what you contribute."" You really think the average CEO contributes 271 times more than a standard employee making almost $60k a year? 
I certainly don't.

Here's a more relatable example. You and a buddy get a new job working manual labor. Your buddy negotiates a wage significantly larger than yours even though you both have the same experience and job. **Is he contributing more?**

>You act like jobs grow on trees and **everyone is entitled to one.**

Oh wow buddy. Everyone SHOULD be entitled to a job, every one can be made productive somewhere my dude.



>Well, everyone is entitled to something, but the *point* of minimum wage wasn't to make sure every person in the country can live a happy life and buy whatever they want, it was to make sure every person in the country can survive and not starve to death. **And it works.**

If you don't get that, I don't know what to tell you, that simply isn't how inflation works. $11 isn't a ""great"" wage because Walmart employees don't have ""great"" jobs. They do have jobs worth about $11/hour though.

Lmao dude yes I understand how minimum works. I understand it has to be voted on. That's why it hasn't gone up, because politicians are out of touch with their constituents and Republicans think people with ""bad"" jobs deserve it and are lower humans than those with ""good"" jobs.

That's fine dude, if you think $22,000 is livable wage for an adult to have an enjoyable life then okay. What about kids? What about housing? Unexpected medical bills? Death in the family? Minimum wage was supposed to provide a liveable and comfortable wage.

That's great but I work with people with developmental disabilities, they are allowed to be paid less than minimum wage. It's exploitative sometimes. 


Quote from politifact.
>Under [section 14(c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)](https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/statutes/fairlaborstandact.pdf), employers are able to pay a wage below the federal minimum wage to workers whose work is affected by a mental or physical deficiency. (The ADA does not change this provision.) The reduction in wage corresponds to the reduction in productivity as compared with a worker without a disability. This means that some disabled workers can make significantly less than the minimum wage, in some cases even less than a dollar per hour."
