We were having fun and we had started pranking each other.   This took the form of yanking down each other's shorts at inopportune times.  My one buddy was getting a couple drinks and was waiting in line to get some straws and my buddy yanked his shorts down.  My buddy just stood there for what seemed like an eternity as he was mentally calculating how to get his pants pulled back up without spilling his drinks.    He had old tighty whities on as well,  which was hysterical to us.   Well, eventually they came for me.  I had seen this really cute girl who seemed to be with older sister who appears to have a baby and her mother.  We were in the line for a ride and the line snaked around so that you tended to see the same people every 5 minutes or so.   My friends must have noticed me staring at the girl, so they waited until we were in sight of her and they yanked my shorts down.   So, we were going to go to the waterpark that day as well, so I had shorts,  and then underneath that, I had some biker shorts that I was going to use as swim trunks and under that I had a Speedo on as the biker shorts tended to be a little see through (and I was a swimmer back then).   When they yanked my shorts down,  they got the biker shorts as well, so I was standing there with just my Speedo's for a couple seconds.  Also, they mistimed it as the girl I was staring at had already walked by and now here mother was staring directly at me.   The look she gave me, I will never forget.   It was kind of a glare followed by an eye roll and a smirk that seemed to convey disdain, dismissal, and that she was not impressed all in the same motion.
