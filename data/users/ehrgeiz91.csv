thesims,fe57vqk,t1_fe48phf,1578866385.0,"Code the game better and make better graphics settings. If my 8 year old processor and video card can play Battlefront 2 and Red Dead 2 then a sims game should be able to run on the average computer.

Edit: the real reason they limited it is to sell more crap and push the series into being mobile and or entirely online (like the spectacular failure that was SimCity 2013). Mobile gaming = pay to play. When they realized people hated that and public opinion turned on EA finally, they started pushing expansions and stuff packs similar to other entries in the series. But originally TS4 was supposed to be like a fucking Facebook/browser game with shitty photoshop art graphics."
StarWars,fe57c8v,t1_fe492l3,1578866276.0,People didn’t hate it. It was a hugely successful release with some criticism about Jar Jar. The criticism since has intensified and is largely overblown.

I actually feel the opposite. I loved the will they won’t they parts and the beginning of their marriage, but the problem is they waited till the 11th hour to introduce any real faults or conflicts with them. They were too perfect, so the sudden arguments and fighting seemed so so forced to me. If they’d gradually come to that, fine, that’s real life - but all of a sudden having Jim flip cause Pam accidentally didn’t record the thing? I could almost feel his struggle to do that scene because Jim would never be so petty."
