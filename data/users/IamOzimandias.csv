>Prosecutors say the committee also used nonprofit funds to throw a  private party on Jan. 17, 2017, the night off the inauguration, for Mr  Trump’s family — a $300,000 (£228,000) affair. The reception was for  three of Trump’s children — Donald, Jr, Ivanka, and Eric.

So the kids rented a room *at their own hotel* and charged the slush fund 100k each? Literally the day trump takes office and they are already stealing and lining their pockets. What a grubby, thieving bunch of grifters. When trumptards talk about hypocrisy they don't mean this, right? But it's breathtaking. The hypocrisy of the left. It takes their breath away, all they can do is shake their heads. Let's try and pivot to Hunter Biden without any sense of irony."
EarthPorn,ffcz7il,t1_ffc0u64,1579810292.0,"A fractional meter is a decimal. So your silly argument is just shallow puffery and nonsense. Also having a strongly held opinion about whether your ceiling is 2.438 m or 2500 mm is actually fairly batshit. As is deciding what resolution 'most people' need when they use a ruler? Is that your final word on it, as an expert who has considered how everyone uses a tape measure? Why do you even bother, just go away. Your arguments are bad and meaningless and you should feel bad."
EarthPorn,ffby5di,t1_ffbmcdq,1579786501.0,its just easier to work with. Everything in mm and you are mostly working with a 3 digit number instead of inches and fractions.

It was telling her that she could not just tell me what I wanted for my body. Yes, it's a close cousin to sexual abuse in that way. Especially since she also tried to shame me for it and feel like I was a bad person. Yes she tried to convince a six year old that he was a bad person who did not deserve love (''No woman will want to marry you"") because I dared to defy her. So her reaction was to hit me every day until I was big enough to stop her. Now she wonders why I have spoken to her *once* in 30 years."
