If you live in Germany and work under the German system and pay their taxes, you are eligible for their public healthcare, yes. Non dual citizens that live here and work will have a visa, the same way someone in the US would. 

I have public insurance in Germany, and I used to also have US insurance at the same time through my dad until I turned 26. Foreign insurance is considered private in Germany and the doctor will send you a bill and you then have to translate the bill (at least for the US insurance we had, maybe other insurances will do it for you, Idk).

However, if you earn enough (not sure of the exact amount), you are able to choose a private health care provider if you want. But if you do not switch back when you’re older (I think sometime in your 50s), you are not allowed to have public health insurance at all anymore. 

Also, more info on the public healthcare: Germany has several public insurances. You are able to chose a plan with them and if you have certain health issues you may choose a plan offering more cancer screenings or extra dental care, for example. They also vary in price so you get to choose that based on your needs. 

And if you have a visa for here, if you become unemployed you are able to use the unemployment office to help you find work and you are eligible for unemployment money depending on the circumstances of losing your work (the same as for Germans)."

So depending on that almost 50% of that income might be gone to taxes. Germany, where I live, has a progressive tax rate. This means people who don’t earn much don’t pay much tax, but people earning above almost 56k pay 42% income tax. If you earn 100k and then pay 42% income tax to Germany, it might be a lot of money gone if you are also paying the US (I am not sure of the federal US income tax rates).

However, I just found out I need to report my income to the US also, and they have a catch up program for this so I’m just gonna report my very low income to the US lol. 

If you are only a citizen of the US you still have to pay income tax if you have a visa in another country and work abroad. This does *not* apply to US citizens in the military or who are working for the DoD (usually they will have a SOFA stamp, but not always). They only pay US income taxes and are exempt from paying taxes in another country and can get things such as VAT forms to purchase things in other countries and write off the local tax.

edit: and if you have a foreign bank account, if the balance is above 10k, you must also report this to the US. At least that is what I was told but I don’t have that much so it’s whatever lmao.

*Also* (and this is just for Germany, I don’t know about other countries) banks will ask if you are US American because they don’t really like of you are, it’s more hassle for them. You have to check a box on their paperwork when opening an account or taking out a loan stating if you are or aren’t. Literally only for Americans, they don’t ask about any other country."

In World War I, though it’s a different war, on Christmas everyone got together by the trenches to celebrate with each other. And then they were ordered to go back to killing each other after, and some people had to be moved because they couldn’t bear killing the people they celebrated with. People, maybe soldiers in particular, were definitely aware of the fact that the other soldiers they were fighting were just average people overall. It’s why throughout history, people who fought in wars often return with PTSD. Seeing people die and people trying to kill you and killing people takes a toll on you.

I am for weed legalization but yeah, generally both alcohol and weed are not recommended for non adults. 

I guess one could also argue that inhaling the smoke (of anything) isn’t healthy, since smoke irritates your lungs. Most teens trying weed smoke it. 

So those are arguments you could make against it. I do think it’s best to be there for your kids and not condemn them for trying alcohol or weed but to educate them on the risks.

We should really examine the things that have occurred through US influence in the Middle East (and other places). A whole generation has grown up knowing only violence and war there.

Or get health insurance and be financially stable. My dad escaped crippling poverty through the army and so did some of his siblings. I’m talking like not enough food, foster families, the whole nine yards. My dad did not finish school and without the army he would have probably never had the opportunities he did career-wise. He went to college after his enlistment and had near perfect grades. I’m very proud of him, he was the first one in his family with a college degree. The majority of his family is still very poor but he made it. He was also able to help his younger siblings. My husband also was in the army and I think his life would be very different if he hadn’t been stationed outside of the US.  

I have also considered joining to pay for college. Although my dad is doing fine now it still would be essentially impossible for me to pay for college myself without loans. But I don’t know. I am not really in a hurry to be a soldier at the moment, not just because of Iran stuff but also because one of my best friends in the army committed suicide and the way it was handled was terrible. It kind of pushed me away from the military recently. 
  
Most of the soldiers I am friends with joined because it was an economic opportunity. Some want to go to college, some are planning to work in a similar field after their enlistment is done, like logistics or engineering. Some also joined because they had children very young and it is a steady source of income although I guess it is also economic. My husband joined because as a kid he always wanted to and was into military stuff. But for him I think it was also economical to a degree, as he wants to work privately in a similar field now that he is out of the army. There isn’t much opportunity where he is from either. He kind of lowkey hates military stuff now and said he felt trapped having to mold his life around army life all the time so he’s happy to be done now. 

There’s also some soldiers who just really wanted to be soldiers. But I don’t know super many who want to make a career of it, they generally view it as a step in life to get to stuff they really want to do. In my experience the ones that do make a career out of it just kind of wound up doing that. Also, some people wind up completely hating it and have major fuck ups and get thrown out.
