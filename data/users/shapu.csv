Your mother definitely needs help.  If you think your dad might have a hard time paying for it (though he probably won't have to, see below), there are options available.  Contact [NAMI](https://www.nami.org/Find-Support/NAMI-HelpLine).  You can make the call yourself and explore options.  YOU should also consider seeing someone because the way that this is affecting you might not be clear now, or in the near future, but it's definitely not healthy for children to be caring for their parents at such young ages. 

Because your parents are divorced, your dad almost certainly won't have to pay for her.  Shared custody means he might have to help cover for you, his children, but that might require a lot less convincing.  Your sister, who is sixteen (SIXTEEN!) won't be expected to pay at all.

Please, help your mother by helping her find a good professional to talk to and to help her get through this.  She is sick, and she needs a doctor, or she won't get better."

Stepping back for a minute, I'm going to say that I love roller coasters.  LOVE 'em.  I haven't been able to go to any in a long time, not since my kids were born, but the thrill, the climb, the agonizing wait, the kachunkachunkachittachitta of the chain, all of it - fucking fantastic.

But I can't do spinny things.  Never have been able to.  Ever since I was a teenager, going in a circle has made me nauseous.  I can't even do a carousel ride with my kids.  I just give the attendant the money, strap them on, and step right off again.  Otherwise I need to go lie down for a few minutes.

Anyway.  This was back in high school, and my date and I go to this mall parking lot carnival.  I think it was probably an attempt to help save the mall, but joke's on them, it literally got cut in half later and the front half torn down because there were so few tenants.  And my girlfriend says, ""Hey, let's do this [*unholy chittering noise*]"" while she points at this spinning swing contraption.  I believe her utterances may have summoned it from the pits of hell.

But even though I knew better, I wanted a chance to smash, so I said, ""Sure, why not?""  Make a girl happy, get into some pants, everyone wins, right?
