Stop playing video games, watch porn and jerkoff. Only do that on saturdays as a reward."

ADHD,fdeh2xu,t3_ekus1l,1578338877.0,"Hey. Once you catch up, you burn out.
The trick is to accept to go to school for 6 days every week now on.
Meet 1 hour earlier mon-fri and work on catching up. You will be too tired after school.
Every Saturday you catch up as much you can for 4 hours.

Dont spent more time than this. But ve consistent each week until summer."

BDSMpersonals,fdd55qn,t3_ekp4jz,1578295254.0,lol not thinking about the sex but you're a person I'd loved to be friends with based only on your interests haha how rare. I like to wear psychedelic art or visionary art cloth. I like to see dmt inspired art and I've probably listened to over 80% of all Terence Mckenna's audio recordings. wish you find what you're looking for and stay cool

MechanicalKeyboards,fcwf4f8,t3_eiwf8d,1578024022.0,"**HHKB Pro 2, tex yoda ll, tex Shinobi or similar 60% / 40% keyboard you'll recommend?**
Hey.
So I need a new mouse and thought I should get a smaller keyboard since it takes up a lot of space and the mouse Is big too.
So last night I was looking for mechanical keyboards and then found this subreddit.
I don't want a keyboard with a windows key really. I don't know much about the different keyswitches in mechanical keyboards, but I love my keyboard on my Thinkpad W520 so I still use that laptop to type on.
The layouts I've seen I liked the most is HHKB and Tex Yoda II, but I would have loved to have a TEX Shinobi but it takes up so much space on my desk.
I love that the HHKB comes with blank keys, but Tex Shinobi comes in Nordic layout so that's a huge plus.
Honestly I don't know which one to pick and which keyswitches to choose?
I guess I'm just looking for some to clear my mind so I can make a decision or recommend me something I haven't looked at?
Thanks for reading, sorry for the confusion."

NoFap,fcv2qbt,t3_ej2u4v,1577993428.0,"Dopamine building activities. Drawing, audiobook, visualize in your head. Write a story on your computer, clean your room. Try new recipies. Play an instrument. Go winterbathing, do hillsprint. Get a skateboard and practice. 
Really just get into learning a new skill. The best would be brazilian jiu jitsu."

They say it will get better.. a year ago I had bought a one way ticket to a third world country to end my life but I was too depressed to commit to it and now its been a year later. I have nothing to really show for the last 2 years. But now I'm motivated to do something with my life and I'm happy to give it a try. I have so much knowledge to guide me now.

Hang in there. Maybe some eminem can get you through this day?"

bipolar,fcsussi,t1_fcsuayx,1577925648.0,Sex is overrated. Interesting people are important for your own sanity in this society so get out there and be inspired by others to do more for yourself in your life and try new things. - coming  from me who threw 2 years of my life away and just feel motivated to get up and be myself now lol. Do what's best for you :)
