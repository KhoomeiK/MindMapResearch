Competitiveoverwatch,ff51oma,t3_erjzpq,1579577829.0,Fuck that to be honest. I don't really see any positives.
dubstep,feuu4xj,t1_feum1is,1579389932.0,"Thank you

Reminds me a bit of Oliverse and Ray Volpe 

I like the 1st transition from 1:30 to 1:43, makes it feel like 2 different songs"
dubstep,feulvcy,t1_feuktuc,1579387770.0,Uhhh SoundCloud or YouTube like every other post on this subreddit?
aves,feul5y6,t3_eqm05w,1579387608.0,"That's not an unpopular opinion. Everyone who's gone multiple times knows that NOS is bad. San Bernardino has always been trash as a location, but no other LA city aside from Fontana Speedway would take EDM massives after that girl died way back in the day and basically there's no other place to host."

dubstep,feuki94,t3_eplygk,1579387375.0,"I recognize one name, hehe."
aves,fetemou,t3_eqex6e,1579374633.0,"I don't know, I personally loved it. I cried when they played that Eleanor Rigby remix, that made me tear up because it reminded me of a time long ago."
Competitiveoverwatch,fe6d67r,t1_fe66y67,1578887462.0,"Arguing with the fun factor in mind is subjective. Moth once had instant Rez with no counterplay. Live Doom also has no counter play from his uppercut. Both need toning down but saying never design on the fun favor is not entirely true since fun is relative.

For example, it might be fun for the player having lots of power but frustrating for everyone else. I feel like the argument that never nerfing a hero because of fun isn't a strong position considering if that hero makes fun less enjoyable for everyone."
Competitiveoverwatch,fe5y0q1,t1_fe5u0xv,1578877469.0,Replace Doom with Moth Mercy and your take is kinda wack

aves,fcu06pm,t3_eims1t,1577967914.0,Stay away from any events at the NOS. I learned that the hard way last year at Escape and Countdown. I find that the vibes in and out of the place to be terrible and not worth it. Gotta stand clear of San Bernardino in general. Go out of state for better vibes.
EDCJapan,fc7ct2f,t1_fanlsw0,1577503663.0,They had last year's trailer announcement back in November... Hope they didn't cancel it ðŸ˜­
depression,fc2l1nh,t3_efumjb,1577365466.0,"All the damn time friend. I think to myself that Everytime I fail at something, I feel like I'm not worthy. That the solutions I put out were the problems themselves....

But deep down I knew that wasn't always true. I was basically homeless and took outside help to get me back to where I am now. Still not as good as I was before all the shit came crashing down but better than being on the streets. You feel that your self esteem is low, but reaching out has helped me gain mine back, even only if half of it is back. Hope you do friend."
depression,fc2k88o,t3_eful2f,1577364456.0,"I'm sorry that happened fam. The dude sounds like he's not mature  and hurt you bad.

The fact that the relationship was one sided sucks, wish there was a better way to say it."
depression,fc2jp5c,t1_fc2ifrx,1577363747.0,"I feel this way too much.


At least I cried less like a bitch today which I got that going for me"
