politics,fcn4jko,t1_fcn3cxm,1577803068.0,"But here's the problem: companies won't provide an incentive for you to take lower hours. Likely the opposite: If you were making $25 an hour working 2080 hours a year (40 hour weeks), that's an annual salary of $52,000 pre-tax. Now, because of efficiencies, you are down to a 30 hour work week. However, your hourly rate is still $25, so now you are only making $39,000. AND, since you are below full-time hours (32 per week), they do not have to provide you with insurance benefits.

politics,fcn2h16,t1_fcn04jf,1577801405.0,"You DO realize that technological efficiencies won't increase your hourly wage, right? A company isn't going to say, ""Wow, you reduced your hourly workload by 33%, better give you a 33% raise to make up for it!"" They are going to say, ""Thanks for making your job idiot proof, we are going to hire an idiot at half your hourly wage to do it. Go pound sand."" 

That's the problem with relying on stock market as an indicator of financial stability: companies want to provide the best stock dividends, and they can only do that by making more money and having less expenses (i.e. labor)."
