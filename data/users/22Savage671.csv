Saved over $500 in cash due to saving money and making some on the side, used to buy new basketball shoes (for $50 too, steal) and fund part of my parents' vacation (mostly food expenses/cash). My team is currently undefeated in a local basketball league in credit to my teammates for that, especially cause I missed a game, but overall I feel I've improved as a player. Now I feel like a good player instead of scrub, trying to hit great. Recently got accepted to one of those programs where you go to colleges and dorm there and learn stuff, although it probably won't push through since we can't afford to go to America and where I'm planning to go is Asia, so coronavirus. 2 months of lifting and I've hit the milestones I set for myself."
AskReddit,ffw3mov,t3_evixww,1580282871.0,"I was at my home country, back in the day when I was a ""competitive Dark Souls player."" Hopped on using a relative's PS4, and talked to a friend A on the party, explaining the situation. Friend B got on, asked why I said my internet might not be as good, and I jokingly said ""I'm in Iraq."" He actually believed me, then left to go eat, so me and friend A hatched the dumbest plan of all time.






I was to pretend my room was getting attacked by terrorists, and that I was hiding in the bathtub or some shit. My friend would be off his mic, but mics can catch surrounding area, so he would max the volume while shouting shit in Arabic, Urdu, whatever they spoke there, like ""Allahu Akbar."" I would pretend to be really scared and would say my last words, then A gets close to the mic and shouts while I drop the headset while playing loud AK-47 sound effects on my mic.







It worked perfectly and Friend B was screaming and didn't know what to do. He contemplated calling the cops and telling his parents. Friend A ""hopped back on"" and asked what was going on while we had a Friend C who was a bystander. After like 2 minutes of listening to them, I spoke back on the mic and explained the truth while A and C were cracking up.







Kinda offensive, I know, but we were like 12. A and I are still on good terms. B and I had some falling outs (not related to the situation). C dates my ex so we don't talk anymore, not out of mutual dislike but more of like an armistice. We also been through shit."
