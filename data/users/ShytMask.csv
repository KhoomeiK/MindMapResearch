nespresso,ff42u5a,t1_ff3mhvq,1579554326.0,"If I may show an alternate side to the story: sometimes you end up with only one (and the replacement is missing items) - all with no way to fix the problem. 

I have stuck to the boutiques because I got burned not once, but twice. Sucks to not get those online only specials though."
Coffee,ff427qp,t1_ff420tq,1579553940.0,"I just did, I'm an English alphabet writer. I never learned how to read and write in Farsi because...well...I have no use for it. I don't have Farsi installed on my phone, but I'm sure Google translate can handle it.

It'll look like the Arabic but probably (maybe) different characters."
Coffee,ff40c72,t3_erh4pn,1579552772.0,Idk how to spell it but it's like ghaah-veh (farsi).
vinyl,ff27nvy,t3_er6kro,1579496170.0,Hey I'm looking for a table like that. You wouldn't happen to remember where you got it from would you?
tonightsdinner,fet8hx6,t1_fespnlk,1579372751.0,"I hear you - sous vide, then stove top, then bake, then broil. It looks delicious but I'd have to cut those steps like waaay down."
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fdh1rk2,t1_fdfvot3,1578413506.0,Yeah my dog gets tons of face kisses. Gotta keep my little dude fresh and clean.
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fdh1ohj,t1_fdfv8dx,1578413451.0,Lolol it's funny that's why!
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fdfqhlc,t1_fdfa54a,1578367757.0,"Right, this is what I'm thinking! I have a mutt (beagle, but smaller), full tail, nothing different about the guy. He gets comes in from a walk or bathroom break, and he gets his belly and doodle, paws, butt, and face wiped. 

Like...I snuggle the shit out of my dog and I don't want to get sick from that. I don't want to see, smell, sit in, or walk through street germs in my house."
aww,fd6p1ny,t1_fd6nk3b,1578194000.0,Lmaoooooo so perfectly done
YouShouldKnow,fd38eee,t1_fd0nvpw,1578155731.0,"It was called Iran before that - the modern world started calling it Persia and the people Persian because Greek writing called the area Persis.

I think Achaemenid was period specific - but I'm no historian (someone else might know more about this)."
YouShouldKnow,fczxasc,t1_fczqzld,1578110216.0,"Right? I'm thinking...shit it was Iran, Greeks named it Persia, then it returned to Iran. 

Recent??? Psh."
RedditLaqueristas,fct8ier,t3_eimzd7,1577935701.0,No.
ketorecipes,fct6xab,t3_eio0lr,1577934472.0,Why haven't I thought of this....like...am I dumb???
grubhubdrivers,fcnw1uz,t1_fcmq8nw,1577819578.0,".....let's be logical here....there is a building full of apartments.....at least one person is home (the apartment where you just delivered)....the front door has a large window where you can see people walking by....also there is a large amount of foot traffic, and people waiting to be seated at the popular restaurant on the ground floor. 

This was hardly a traumatizing, I feel so alone, everything is silent situation. 

She just hit panic and wouldn't stop - it made me feel bad for no reason, but let's not forget that this person literally forgot how a door operates (it's a standard twist knob door). 

It was far more complicated getting in than it is getting out (because getting in involved finding me in the virtual doorman's address book)."
grubhubdrivers,fclt4s4,t1_fcle3vf,1577755829.0,"It's funny now, but at the time I really thought she would have my number forever since the delivery was completed and she called me."
grubhubdrivers,fcl85mv,t3_ehrvor,1577741886.0,"I had a driver from Caviar call me after delivery (I rated and tipped, and it showed as delivered before I did that). 

She was in the lobby of my building crying because she couldn't figure out how to open the door and was telling me she's trapped forever and scared. 

I buzzed the door open, she kept talking to me after the door buzzed and she wouldn't open it by pushing the door and I'm like....dafuq do I do now?"
nespresso,fcl788w,t3_ehrft6,1577741311.0,Can't you return the pods for the correct ones? No hacking - the vertuo pods don't even have 3rd party pods available.
AmItheAsshole,fc3bkao,t3_efup4p,1577386159.0,"Wow, ESH except the kid. Wow. You abandoned a 3 year old with no plan on how to decouple, just straight vanished and are now surprised that her mom never came clean with her?

I can't believe I'm actually saying this, but whatever happened 10 years ago was also partly your fault. I'm sorry you were cheated on, but when we enter into relationships with people, we are taking a risk. You have to be mature to handle the ups and downs and breakups. 

She cheated, that was wrong. You compounded that wrong with your own wrong by not maturely discussing what was to be done about the THREE YEAR OLD that is part of the relationship. 

So your ex sucked 13 years ago, and then you joined her 10 years ago,and you're both sucking together now. 

You're all awful."
MrRobot,fc1b5ff,t3_efmh0u,1577313509.0,"I think WR represents another mental illness - and she truly believed she was humanity's savior and her machine worked.

She did talk about others universes and other nows, but never about bringing the dead back to life. However, she killed herself to prove that she did believe her machine would work.....so I'm in the same boat as you: I have an idea about WR but I talk myself out of accepting the idea."
