The key here is that true powder skis have reverse camber to help keep the tips up and out the snow. Reverse camber is absolutely atrocious for skiing snow that isn’t powder at least 3-ish inches deep.

He gathered more individual support than the Clintons, the fuckin Clintons, can purchase. So the Clintons *absolutely must* continue to be on the offensive against Sanders or their political legitimacy could unravel very, very quickly. Not only was Hillary a worse candidate than Trump, per the results of 2 Nov 2016, but she also, arguably, destroyed one of Sanders’ best runs at President .... so she could lose the Presidential race at the same time the FBI played cop, prosecutor, and judge to protect her from standing trial for violating ... wait for it

Not really, not like torque’s nose dive.

Lookit TeslaBro, you’re still working thru understanding why wheel speed dyno graphs aren’t useful like crank speed dyno graphs. You want to talk super nerdy about how electric motors are vastly superior to internal combustion engines, but you’re describing fundamentals of the physics here wrongly. I’m done with educating you about what you’re claiming to know. You’re very versed with anecdotal evidence, but can’t speak to the evidence itself. 

Enjoy your hot rodding."
energy,fedsrlw,t1_febx9mi,1579019109.0,".... ok you’re not responding to my comments you’re just repeating your phrases and bleating incessantly about electric motors being superior to internal combustion engines. Specifically, a 60 to 120 kph test is going to favor the internal combustion engine, if both engines are rated at the same output.

>horsepower is horsepower and torque is torque

They’re directly related to one another, you blockhead. Horsepower is torque with respect to time. Acceleration is the first derivative of horsepower. So torque is directly related to acceleration.

>[electric dyno graph]

This proves my point, not yours. Max torque is at standstill, and torque declines as RPM increases. Notice that power is basically linear, it really doesn’t have all that much relation to engine speed. 

That graph is why people who say “electric motors don’t need transmissions”, I want to send to engineering school.

Electric motors are like diesels. The slower they spin, the better they are. Look at that dyno graph again. The faster the engine spins, the worse it performs. Like I said"

energy,feagwlr,t1_fea508i,1578948605.0,"Preciated the DIY knowledge.

You’re not being strictly correct in how you describe torque vs power. Yes, you need to accelerate a load when going uphill to maintain a constant velocity, due to gravity, but this is a minuscule amount of power when comparing to torque. And that’s hugely important when discussing electrical torque when comparing to gasoline torque.

The combustion chamber is sealed, thus we have classical mechanics generating the forces which create torque and, over time, power. 

Magnetism is not a classical force. It is based on electrons, yes; but movement across materiel, not movement between orbital radius (eg, combustion). 

There is nothing physical against which electric motors “push” to develop torque (once it isn’t stopped) . That’s why torque in electrical is so much shittier than gasoline. 

Electrical torque is maximum at 0 rpm, as that’s when the magnets can “push” against each. The faster the motor spins, the less efficient it is at converting e^_ into torque. Thus, the classical formula for power, more RPM, is destroyed.

You’re cherry picking. How many last mile or long haul truckers start at *n* ft, go uphill for half the contract, go downhill for half the contract, and end at *n* ft. 

God help the logic of someone who claims electrical towing is vastly, unarguably superior while simultaneously suggesting a 45% range reduction is immaterial cause you can use a diesel generator to supplement energy.

Honestly, mr engineer. Check your own reasonableness. You’re wearing blinders and gushing about your X-ray vision."
energy,fe9suzq,t1_fe8zu1c,1578941181.0,"My point with battery-based hauling is that electric motors draw power like turbochargers draw fuel - directly related to requested torque level, and higher levels require geometrically more load levels to achieve desired torque.

The more weight you haul in your Tesla, a geometric increase in e^_ you need. You ever ridden one of those electric scooters? It goes slower uphill. The steeper the grade, the slower it goes. But doubling the grade reduces your speed by more than half. 

Those incredible capacity batteries? All that current has to go thru a single wire, physics demands such, even if you run your 4 motors in series, there’s ONE wire out the battery. Which releases an INCREDIBLE amount of thermal energy. I have seen/heard of literally zero literature on how the Tesla truck manages heat. P85D, or whatever their 0-60 monster is, doesn’t have this issue because the motor is at load for seconds. Not entire trips.

You’re following? The most fundamental thing for a truck is on NOBODY’s radar unless they’re OK being labeled MAGA idiot."

You’ve chosen to respond to an issue which speaks to national party platforms with *ad hominem* - your insistence that this has nothing to do with DNC tactics ignores the very words you’re responding to. We’re not important people on TV speaking to millions. So stop using those tactics. I’ll explain. By responding to what I’ve said how you have, you’re dismissing my synthesized argument on high-level issues by speaking to me as if I was unable to grasp very basic issues. Whether or not you realize this, that’s a propaganda tactic pioneered by Eastern versions of socialism (Mao, Ho).  By refusing to directly respond to the conversation, you’re not talking to me, you’re talking to everyone whom is listening, rejecting out-of-hand the conversation to which you’re responding. My presence is entirely cursory to your goal for the conversation.

It is a rather violent conversation for my side of it. Violence against ideas doesn’t cause the same visuals as physical violence, but it’s more invidious to constitutional democracy. It’s absolutely deleterious to civil, respectful, conversation between two people."

Thanks again for y’all’s part in blocking AB gas-oil from getting that Pacific terminal. I’ve ridden the length of the Alyeska pipeline 2x; it’s a net loss for the environment.

You’re not a grasping my issue with electric. It’s much less of an engineering exercise to generate a sub-10 second quarter with electricity as your mechanical motion generator than combustion. You find a motor that spins fast enough and can handle the amperes, then you put together a battery system that will support your juice needs and then you get together controllers to make it all work. This means that electric is vastly superior to gasoline for transportation, moving mass from A to B. 

Your argument against gasoline is based in that you’re goddamn sure you’re smarter than your audience. And, you make a categorical presumption that cars only exist to serve transportation purposes. 

>that new Tesla truck

That is the most atrocious offering for a “truck” I’ve ever seen. It’s a truck for people who have no use for a truck but a massively sized car. It can go 0-60 in 2.9 seconds ... how many times in a row. Tesla recently completed their first lap of Nurburgring, using a non-homogolmated vehicle.

Also, this is an excellent policy for Canada, most especially for Vancouver. Personally, having lived on SW Marine Dr, I’m surprised Van hasn’t started outlawing older engines like Paris."

I FUCKIN LOVE you used cars/combustion engines as your foil. I can tune carbs and convert to megasquirt/EFI. I’ve purchased “dead” cars and revived them, sold em at a loss - because I enjoy it. I remember taking a blow torch to your side of this when Obama floated rules at the EPA which extended “commerce” to the regulate the catalytic converter from intake manifold to exhaust tip, claiming that any modification by consumer was violating environmental laws. Basically backing into TÜV via commerce clause and environmentalism mattering more than people’s ability to pursue life, liberty, happiness. Y’all self-important twats.

You’re digging a deeper and deeper hole for your side of this. I gave you such a massive hint at how stupid it is to not help consumers shoulder the load of the societal changes you want enforced. 

Just roll-back tax schemes for petro companies and use that savings to pay for the infrastructure to support electric vehicles.

I’ll never own one. I actually enjoy the power chemical reactions release, in an emotional way. I understand all the maths and engineering required to convert raw materials to interim pieces which result in an automobile. I simply am not excited by electricity’s motors. Max torque at 0rpm and exigencies of magnetism (how torque is developed in electric motors) does not excite me. It’s pedestrian. 

And your reaction to anyone who doesn’t agree with your reasoning and conclusion is treated as equally as pedestrian. Their humanity doesn’t enter into the equation. Your second sentence dismisses the main thrust of my entire reaction - that the demonization of my passion is an indirect demonization of the expression of my authenticity - and that actually explains why Democrats are so reviled by non-Democrats:

Whenever Democrats are confronted with reasonable opposition to their, self-professed, superior ideals and notions of how to live life, they’re entirely unable to deal.
