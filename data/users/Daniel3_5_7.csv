On 12 August 1915, the 1/5th Battalion suffered heavy losses at Gallipoli when it became isolated during an attack. A myth grew up long after the War that the men had advanced into a mist and simply disappeared. A BBC TV drama, All the King's Men (1999), starring David Jason as Captain Frank Beck, was based upon their story."

The way I read it, if I burn a flag to piss you off and you punch me, I committed a crime. If I burn a flag because I'm upset at America, I'm ok.

Law didn't pass anyway, likely would have been challenged in the courts if it was.
