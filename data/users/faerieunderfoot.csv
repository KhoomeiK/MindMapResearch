You are having a conversation with someone funny and witty and clever then boom sex based joke and you don't know what to do next. Play along and hope that he'll remember to be normal and hope the whole conversation isn't about sex from now on. Or shut it down and risk looking like a prude even though you like sex as much as the next person. But also like having extra intimacy from trust and consideration and knowing each other.....it's a lose lose...  So you just ghost them and hope the next match (if there is one) actually likes you for you and not just the fact you've got a vagina they can try and fuck.

They aren't cries for attention they are simply less violent. suicidal women are typically more likely to consider their bodies being found by loved ones more than men. So attempt what is perceived as _less violent_ methods. So that they don't upset their loved ones by brains being splattered on the walls. 



What you're saying undermines mental health problems in much the same way as telling men to suck it up. ""Ah no she didn't _really_ attempt suicide if she really wanted to die she'd have done it right she just wanted attention."" How many people or women are gonna be taken less seriously and not help the help that they need because their attempts at suicide aren't taken seriously just because they didn't actually die?"
BrandNewSentence,fdh3c00,t3_elcgg0,1578414485.0,"It's horrific. However it's also slightly misinformed  and it's mainly because men choose more violent methods of suicide compared to women (i.e. firearms or jumping from buildings) women are [three times more likely to attempt suicide](https://www.verywellmind.com/gender-differences-in-suicide-methods-1067508) . And/or show non fatal suicidal tendencies.

Toxic patriarchy affects everyone. And by snuffing it out it means everyone is free to feel and be who they are. And that starts at home. Show the men in your life it's okay to share and show what they're feeling. And show the women in your life that they aren't being hysterical of they ask for help."

Romance is Oberyn and ellaria. It's Ned and catlyn, it's Rob stark and jeyne/talisa. And to a (much) lesser extent Jaime and cersei.

Baelish at best is an anti hero. And at worst a straight up villian. He was obsessed with catelyn and Sansa. Not in love with them.
