Normally games render 2 frames ahead and until recently you could only manually set it to render 1 frame ahead, (what used to be the maximum pre-rendered frames option) but now it's possible to render with no buffer frame at all, but there are some performance consequences if it's a newer GPU heavy game.

If anyone you know (to anyone in this thread) is hooked on opiates, make sure they know about this death trap. Too many people have died because they were forced to get clean in jail, got released, and tried to return back to their life only to die due to their lost tolerance.

NintendoSwitch,ff4hgb1,t1_ff3c8yl,1579563703.0,"If you're talking about playing the originals way back when, it's probably because you played them on a CRT TV before and they all had instant response times. A modern day TV has 15-100ms response times added onto your input lag depending on how good it is. Games running at 30fps have 32ms input lag right out of the gate, but when combined with a CRT TV it's not so bad. When combined with modern day TV's you're lucky if you're only doubling the input lag and coming out with 60ish ms total response times on a 30fps game. Technology has progressed a lot in terms of resolution and screen size but has regressed a LOT in every other aspect related to gaming over the years. CRT's also had zero motion blur as well, which is also a big problem with modern day displays in competitive first person shooters. CRT monitors looked crisp at whatever resolution you used them on as well and didn't have ""native resolutions"" needed to look optimal like today's monitors and TV's"

Any book I read I have trouble with names, so fantasy is especially hard when they whip weird name after name at you. I end up with a wiki page opened so I can look up a name each time I see it until I'm finally confident I remember who they are lol. Not even gonna bother with the Silmarillion I don't think"

Our other dog who weighs 25lbs less than him and basically raised him taught him that all bones and good treats belong to her, so he won't touch them if she's anywhere nearby lol. He's 3 now and still has no clue he can whoop her ass"

technology,feoyvol,t1_feoy2h6,1579308385.0,"They need to have a majority, as in 50+% of the total delegates for the superdelegates to not matter, which is likely not going to happen because there's so many people running. It'd be nice if it was just cut and dry like that, but it probably won't be this time around. It's still great that they have to wait though like you were saying, or else it would be plastered all over the news soon that Joe Biden is 300+ delegates ahead of everyone else with the narrative that the race is already over just like last time"
TwoXChromosomes,feonvuq,t1_fend30h,1579302720.0,"Ohio did the same thing with Marijuana. We held a vote to add it to the Constitution but everyone voted no because the law was written as to give monopolies to a few people with the sole power of being allowed to grow and sell it. The people who wanted themselves to have a monopoly wrote the amendment themselves and paid people to go out and get enough signatures so that it could be added to the ballot. They basically funded an attempt to get themselves a ridiculous amount of never-ending money via a constitutional amendment, which is pretty fucked up, and since we voted strongly against it the legislature now has reason to say Ohioans don't want legalized marijuana, citing the vote"
technology,feoiczq,t1_feo1nuz,1579300559.0,"Unless Bernie wins by a lot, the DNC is likely to just overrule the people's vote with superdelegates. If Sanders comes out *just* ahead of Biden, I'd be shocked if they don't make Biden the nominee anyways. I know they've never voted against the people's votes before, but they were created specifically to stop someone like Bernie (a rogue or outsider, as they call it). The only reason superdelegates exist is so the DNC can pick the nominee regardless of what the people want if the people don't choose ""correctly"""

funny,feoa12w,t1_feo39p2,1579297225.0,"Pawn Shops need to hold onto all inventory for at least 90 days and put it in a database accessible by police, that way if it's stolen they can recover it and prosecute the seller. My brother is currently on felony probation for being dumb and stealing jewelry from a person's house and selling it to a pawn shop. All they had to do was look up the description of the jewelry and they caught him. It was estimated at over x$ (dunno if the felony line is 2k like stealing from a store or not) and the charge became felony burglary and now he's facing 2 years in jail if he fails his strict probation conditions. Anyways, pretty much half the store is only available to buy at any given time, because the other half is in the back going through its waiting period"

If it is around awards season, a DVD quality screener of the movie meant for awards purposes ends up leaking, sometimes before the movie itself is even out lol.

Conservative,fekdy90,t1_fejppu5,1579198038.0,"I don't see how you guys can claim that a campaign staffer directly affects what Bernie himself wants and at the same time say that the amount of people from Trump's staff that are now in prison, including his former chief of staff, have nothing to do with him. If your view is that the actions of a ton of people connected to Trump have nothing to do with him him then you should abide by that same logic for your opponents or else you are clearly being biased"

CNN is neglecting to mention that part when they say they have 4 witnesses so the fact that he said it is ""completely verified"". Using that same logic, Bernie could go tell 5 people tell CNN he didn't say it and then it will be disproven :|"

Some guy ended up seeing it and flew out of his vehicle and got the rock off like 10 seconds before the train went by and we thought he saved our lives. Now that I'm older I know that rock would have just been pulverized immediately lol"
