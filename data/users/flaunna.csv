Not to bombard you with questions but, is he polydactyl? and how old is he?"
ADHD,feu9ex3,t3_eqkmj8,1579384418.0,"I'll be straight forward, but I really don't know!? 

I work in a similar job environment, just not in Tech Support. 

The only reason I get away with my ADHD symptoms is because my coworkers and boss are all reasonable. If it weren't for that I'd have been fired a hundred times over. 

Technically, it is like a small business / franchise type place but, I think that makes it easier for my boss to get away with letting me get away. Does that make sense? 

Like it's totally possible but only in very specific circumstances. You just gotta find a company with a boss who is will to talk to you about your ""disability"" (I don't know what else to call it but, it's the best way I can pit it) and work with you. 

It's not always something we can manage ourselves until we slip up, my issue was not coming clean from the very beginning. Like after I got hired on and all that, I just kept it to myself until my tardiness and mistakes added up. It wasn't until she sat me down and we discussed it, was she able to work with me."
cats,fetodbg,t3_eqit29,1579377578.0,"My cat does the same, but if I catch her, she just holds her paw against my nose really still and stares at me with wide eyes. She only does it in the morning though to wake me up."
cats,feothpf,t3_eq2zrv,1579305198.0,"I did the same! While it isn't for everyone...! - my kitty is the only reason I have not acted on my suicidal tendencies. As strange as that seems. But as someone who needs animal companionship to remain stable and has the ability to care for her to her fullest potential (financially and physically), as she is chronically ill from her IBD, it was the best decision I have ever truly made. Even to bring her in at a tough spot right before college started, I'm lucky to have her and I cherish her for her very existence!!"
cats,fds6fnu,t1_fdrys35,1578695411.0,"Same!! My vet always calls my kitty a little princess and gives her kisses. All the tech's love her too, like I can see the relief on their faces when my cat rubs against them. I always feel bad for people with angry cats, my grandma has one for sure, and I saw them a lot while doing volunteer work, so I know how awful it can be... You could be doing everything right to make them feel safe and they'll still suddenly viciously attack you or pee on you. Cats can have such unpredictable personalities, sometimes."
AmItheAsshole,fdf0dxu,t3_ekwwcq,1578350478.0,"NTA. My step-dad is the exact same way, and in addition to being verbally abuse is also physically so. I don't blame you at all for wanting your uncle to walk you down the aisle. Your mom is probably just being selfish and more worried about her and her husband's image/pride than your feelings. At least, that's how it seems. My mom is the same exact way, and I know it's because she knows he's awful but doesn't like other people knowing he's awful? If that makes any sense (it doesn't literally but, in how I'm explaining her logic...) She's just very stubborn and protective of herself and how people view her (she likes to seem perfect and well rounded...) so, if I did something like this, I know she'd have an absolute fit and so would my step-dad. She sees me avoiding him as an attack on her. Anyhow, your feelings are totally valid. I wish you a lovely wedding, and I hope all goes as planned for you!"
TrueOffMyChest,fcll0h0,t3_ehnaam,1577750249.0,"I am the late person. And I absolutely do respect others time. Trust me, I don't like being the late person. It sucks. I have ADHD and with that comes time blindness. Timers, alarms, calendars, schedules, and the like do me no good. People yelling at me to leave does nothing either. Why? Because I'm also fucking hard of hearing. Not deaf, but it's enough that I can miss even the loudest of sounds, that includes shrieking as well as just normal alarms. If you tell me the wrong time just to get me somewhere, that also doesn't work, because as soon as I find out, my brain just begins to fill in the gaps itself. I've tried tricking myself as well but, again, it just doesn't help. I'm going to be doing cognitive behavioral therapy soon, to try and fix this. But, trust me. Not all late people are entitled douchebags, some of us just have executive dysfunction and we are working on it. I'm not saying nothing will ever work for me, but I just haven't found what does yet. I have no intentions of giving up, but I just wanted to put it out there. It's not an excuse nor me trying to justify my lateness, just me trying to give a different perspective. Maybe that chronically late person you know is someone dealing with the issues I've got. And sure, they might not be helping themselves but heck, it only takes one person to recognize an issue and bring it up to them. Not just, ""why are you always late, you idiot!! Don't you care about my feelings?!!"" rather, ""Hey can I ask, what has been preventing you to be timely?"" and their answer might even lead you to realize, oh shit, this person literally is ill. It may not even be ADHD, it could also be OCD! I don't know, just communicate better and be gentler to others is all I'm saying... I get why lateness is seen as so rude and hurtful, and it tears me up when I find out I've hurt someone over something like not being on time. I hate being late, its unenjoyable... Ugh..."
AmItheAsshole,fc31n8z,t3_efup4p,1577379393.0,"As someone who was that kid once, yeah, NTA... I can't imagine the heart break for either of you if you helped raise her. It's a difficult thing and sounds like her mom was even using that against you. Maybe to keep you with her? I'm not sure. And it's not like you legally adopted her so she's not actually your responsibility. I'd just give the daughter a heart felt reply and wish her luck, but state, it's the best for the both of you not to get involved in a father daughter relationship like that: given you and your ex are no longer together and she's not actually your kid. It does more harm than good... Just be gentle with the girl, it's not her fault her mother roped you into this..."
AmItheAsshole,fbvnxfp,t3_eenk1s,1577133538.0,"This is a tough one! 

My brother has learning disabilities and so tasks like this are also a struggle for him. My step dad is extremely aggressive and what I and others consider abusive. As such... the two do struggle a lot in their relationship. My brother struggles to understand while my step dad only gets more and more angry until it all boils over. My brother panics, does his very best to do it for that one moment but, it teaches him nothing. Like, outside of threatening or abusive situations he still cant get it right. But, if you sit down with my brother, while already in a calm mood (he also has behavioral disorders so this is also very important), and step by step explain it, then go and have him do it himself with you, and then practice it on his own, and then repeat this the following day and every day for maybe a week or more - he starts to get it! Maybe some slip ups here and there but he then starts to recognize what he did wrong and then can fix it himself without whining to his mom. 

Anyhow - This is tough because it sounds like OP isn't actually abusive, just made a hotheaded decision which really didn't do either party any good. A hug and a kiss after something a bit scary like that is great and all, but it really doesn't get it solidified into their head what they should be learning. You gotta be more patient and slow, with constant reminders for them until they get it. It was a mistake in thought but, it can be fixed and done better. 

Wife is a total asshole for using abuse in that way, she could have worded it better and not been so dramatic. I don't really appreciate abuse being tossed around like that. It was an abuse of power and control, but that doesn't make OP a consistent abuser. It just makes OP kinda rash and hotheaded. Which I get.

But I also can't say OP isn't an asshole... Like he didn't a pretty dick-ish thing that maybe felt good to get over with in the moment, but in the long run isn't going to benefit his daughter. The wife is an enabler for sure, and that also helps no one! 

I suggest bringing it up to your wife, saying you made a rash decision and don't intent on going about it in that way anymore, but that you just want to help your daughter succeed in life and have better functioning, and that enabling her isn't what you want to do. 

So like, just own up it was a mistake, making your wife feel a bit better, but then explain that you'd like her and yourself to do right by your daughter.

You've got the right idea at heart. Just acted a little bit like an asshole to your kid... 

Learn and grow! You'll do better with time and doing your research, best of luck. 

If your wife can't understand that, then she clearly has issues of her own shes goanna have to address. Well, she clearly already does, but still, you get what I mean..."
