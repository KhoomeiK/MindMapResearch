aww,ffbrxg7,t1_ffbm6rc,1579780406.0,"I heard Master's programs for OT can be very tough. If you plan to get your Master's , you'll have to show up to classes. Just an FYI! It's definitely not for everyone."
halo,fesvbf9,t1_festblx,1579369372.0,"It's a ~~viscous~~ vicious cycle where they get pressured into nude shoots, then pornography. They quickly become irrelevant in that area, and have to start doing even more humiliating things to keep money coming. Very few porn stars find long-term success. So they often become stranded in places like California because they don't have a family to go back to. Things like that. There's numerous documentaries about how girls looking for modeling careers often become targets of these types of predatory industries."
halo,fesrkm5,t1_fesle8j,1579368275.0,"And so many fail at it too thinking it's guaranteed money. I know one girl who got a few thousand followers on instagram, so she quit her job and flew out to California to pursue her ""modeling career."" She was back home in just a few weeks, but broke and without a source of income to fix that.

Edit: I should also add that she deleted/unfollowed/blocked a lot (if not most) people she knew from home when she left, I guess thinking she'd be too good for the people back at home once she started this new life. So she didn't have many friends left after returning home either."

stephenking,fds66oq,t3_emojl7,1578695250.0,Reading IT now. It's my first time reading one of King's books. Got over 30 of them recently. Figured this one would be a good start since I loved the movies. Definitely enjoying it so far!
battlefront,fda7gz2,t1_fd7m8gp,1578242657.0,That's how I feel. I bought the Celebratory edition thinking I would need it for all content. Seems like the only additional content is cosmetics. Now that everything is unlocked I'm not sure what to spend credits on.
aww,fcc1s85,t1_fcb5se5,1577593442.0,"I'm not sure if it's so much that owning a reptile makes you weird, but weird people seem to be attracted to owning reptiles.

Most people that I personally know who own reptiles are kinda weird. But not every weird person I know owns a reptile. Make sense? And this is coming from someone who owns a reptile. I don't mean weird in like a creepy individual way. More of quirky, not so bland or basic kind of person type of way."
aww,fcc0oop,t1_fcb5rbx,1577593089.0,"It is in my grandma's will that I am supposed to take her quaker parrot when she passes away. Fortunately for my sake the state absolutely refuses for me to have a permit (and thus own it) here, which is legal in the state she lives in. While I adore that bird, it would drive me insane having to listen to it squak and scream words out all day long, every single day. Fortunately she's found a good future home for it already."
aww,fcbzode,t1_fcawt0y,1577592765.0,"Same. Years of owning lizards (although just leopard geckos, green iguanas, and an armadillo girdled lizard), and yet I've never experienced nor somehow heard of this. I get bummed when my hermit crabs burrow for a few months in the winter. Would be even more sad if my lizard slept for months on end too."
aww,fcbyht7,t1_fcarl5x,1577592380.0,"I honestly had some ambition to get into real estate and make some cash from renters. I think your point just ruined it for me. On second thought, I think I'll avoid that potential headache in my life. Thank you."
WTF,fcauhko,t1_fc9wfs1,1577576856.0,"Similar thing happened to me once. Had to stop my car, but it was on the decline side of a hill. Car kept slowly sliding down. There was another car at the bottom, so I turned the car to at least slide next to it. They blared their horn at me after it slid in front of them. Thanks dude, it's not like I just saved your car from getting hit or anything..."
AdviceAnimals,fc5r7aa,t1_fc5fxn3,1577464146.0,"A large mass was found in my dad's brain a week before Christmas. I've been spending every single day at hospitals to be there for him and my family. At this very moment, he's currently undergoing a second surgery to remove more mass from his brain. There's no guarantee that the cancer won't eventually take his life. Especially since out of the 4 stages the cancer can be at, his doctor described it as a 3 and a half. 

Unless family members are genuinely abusive, horrible, etc. people, spending time with them isn't the worst thing in the world. People should try to be a little more appreciative that they still have those family members around. I'd give anything to have spent my Christmas with my family at home, even if they're annoying at times. Instead we were crammed in an ICU room to see my dad who couldn't even open his eyes to see us because of irritation sustained to his optic nerves during the removal of a fast-growing tumor on his brain. 

This happened to our family out of the blue. A seemingly healthy man up to this point. This could happen to anyone, and at any time without any warning. Take the time to appreciate loved ones. Life can be cruel, so cherish everything you have while you still can. Might sound harsh, but that's a reality some people have been fortunate to not have faced yet. Always try to look at the bright side of things, and be grateful for the good people in your life, even if they're imperfect at times."
funny,fbzazhq,t1_fby6syk,1577240701.0,"Normally I would dread a family christmas party, but right now I wish I was having one tomorrow. Ours was canceled because my dad is currently in the hospital fighting for his life. My point is not to receive pity, but to remind you that family members won't be around forever. Cherish them for the things you love about them, and just try to enjoy your time with them however you can."
AdviceAnimals,fbwq81e,t1_fbw2s20,1577156539.0,The peace of mind is a big reason why some of my family members favor new cars now. You know the history of the car's life from beginning to whenever you're done with it. There's no repercussions because of how the person before you drove/took care of it. The peace of mind alone is enough for some people to pay a little more.
