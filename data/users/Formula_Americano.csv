france,ffppc2m,t1_ffofsxv,1580101096.0,Only if you call that living!
ak47,ffpp6p7,t3_euimu9,1580100961.0,"What's to say I don't just buy this and put a stock on it? Sam7r for the, maybe, $100 cheaper?"
GYM,ffk82f3,t1_ffk7jv0,1580018498.0,"No. Super wierd.

My forearms are naturally big from doing ranch work when I was younger."
GYM,ffk7fr3,t1_ffk75xi,1580018182.0,Not intensely. Maybe just two exercises. Hammer Curls and farmer's carries.
formula1,ffk5u6i,t1_ffk5na1,1580016843.0,"Bummer, but still sound better than F1TV considering the bundle and access to an array of other sports."
formula1,ffk5ltq,t1_ffk589h,1580016619.0,Do you get access to helmet cams (or driver pov) and pit radio?
GYM,ffk5cyd,t3_eu2lsx,1580016387.0,"I would recommend you do it daily. Forearm residual pump is a thing, but if you want serious forearms you should do a forearm dedicated work out. I recommend farmer's walks."
formula1,ffk55sp,t1_ffk54ed,1580016202.0,"Damn, that's a better deal than F1TV."
formula1,ffk536l,t1_ffk52ju,1580016133.0,Is it a bundle?
formula1,ffk505j,t1_ffk307p,1580016054.0,How much does espn charge?

GYM,ffk0f30,t1_ffk08lx,1580012004.0,As long as you're hanging fun and not hurting yourself I approve.
GYM,ffk047l,t3_eu0vxx,1580011754.0,I can't help but think there must be a more practical way of performing this exercise and achieving the same results other than this being akin to GPP (general physical preparedness). As a GPP exercise I like it.
todayilearned,ffjzm7w,t1_ffjwhf7,1580011338.0,Obviously a ploy by the LGBTQ community. /s
GYM,ffdlkma,t3_et150c,1579823463.0,"This worked wonders for me. Let me know if it helps.
