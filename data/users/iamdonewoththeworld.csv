Nepal,ffpxcy4,t1_ffpvpd8,1580109521.0,Thanks. I wish you well too!
Nepal,ffpqtn4,t1_ffpqdc5,1580102468.0,I don't think one can change their username on reddit
Nepal,ff7xbsf,t1_ff7kb3u,1579660580.0,"Ah now that makes sense. 
DM me then"
Nepal,ff6p46n,t1_ff6opr3,1579631939.0,I need a Robin Williams
Nepal,ff6p3h6,t1_ff6opr3,1579631927.0,Yeah i love that movie. Resonated with me so much that i actually cried when Robin Williams did his trick
Nepal,ff6ozpm,t1_ff6opr3,1579631864.0,"If i need it i will take it. But i will question the doctor that would prescribe me pills by simply listening to my story for 15 mins. 
If he prescribes me after actually assessing my mental state then yes I'd happily oblige."
Nepal,ff5zyge,t1_ff5s9hv,1579615540.0,Like I didn't even mention a motorcycle here. :/ Sorry but I don't see the relevance to answer that
Nepal,ff5q7yo,t1_ff5orfi,1579605758.0,How's this relevant?
offmychest,ff2opta,t3_er71dd,1579516749.0,"Oh man. I'm so sorry. I can imagine how you're feeling.
Your post made me think of my dog and how he passed away. Now i am here crying."
AskReddit,fefil2y,t1_feff8sj,1579057075.0,"Interesting. But o doubt it's about trust. I had some serious issues with my dad. And i have been told that i seek love and approval as i did not get it. And whenever I find one of these in people, i start getting attracted to them (the opposite gender) and start crushing on them. And maybe i get attached? idk. But it's annoying and thus do not want to be that pathetic person who falls for every other person i talk to."
SuicideWatch,fee47m1,t1_fee3jbi,1579026051.0,"It did feel a little less heavy i must admit when i finally shared every bit of it on Reddit. Usually when i felt down I'd play games or play music. But today just felt like giving up. I had no desire to continue. And i still don't. 

I don't see people that would be affected by my disappearance. All I see are my 5 close friends and my immediate relatives being a little sad. But that's all. Their lives would move on and I'd be a memory covered in dust."
SuicideWatch,fee31ts,t1_fee26j4,1579025363.0,"I have talked to my closest of friends about my trauma but not all of it. Today was the first time I talked about them in detail on reddit.

It's just that the place i live in, my hometown, never felt like home, and all my life, i never felt like i was a part of this place. And due to my violent dad, i always felt like the odd one out. And to this day, i feel like i am the odd one out everywhere i go. And I do not really think i matter in this world. I'm just a dead tree carrying my own memories, nothing more. 

And having flashbacks of those horrible times doesn't help either. They trigger this sense of fear and restrain within me. Sometimes makes me physically unable to move. I don't see the point in living with so much pain. I'd rather end it swiftly than deal with it day by day."
offmychest,fecziax,t1_fecze5i,1578991188.0,Thanks a lot. I really appreciate it.
offmychest,fecz5wi,t1_fecz46c,1578990731.0,"Hopefully. If I keep my composure till June. If they accept me, i should be out of here by September"
offmychest,fecz2ed,t1_fecyygp,1578990604.0,"There are a bunch. But I'm not really aware of them. 
I'm about to take IELTS hopefully i do good. And my high school grades are okayish. I'm trying to go to Poland right now tho."
offmychest,fecyxe8,t1_fecyv0w,1578990428.0,I am not. I wish tho. I'd do anything to leave this place where a home never felt like one
offmychest,fecyu1z,t1_fecyrsb,1578990308.0,I dropped out of high school. I'm currently in the process of applying abroad for studies.
offmychest,fecypc5,t1_fecyn9e,1578990136.0,"Again. A third world country, we don't get personal doctors.
I am close to where you guessed. But I'll leave you to guess which country. And I'd appreciate it if you don't mention it. Thanks"
offmychest,fecykw6,t1_fecyfvb,1578989977.0,Thank you so much!
offmychest,fecykiy,t1_fecyfvb,1578989965.0,"No, not in India. 
And no I haven't. There aren't many therapists here. Plus whoever I have found are all super expensive. My family doesn't know i have trouble with my past either, so a therapist would mean opening up and i don't think I'm ready. All my support is a friend I mentioned. 
It's a mess indeed. And I feel the same about my life being like a movie sometimes. Usually when I'm not so down."
offmychest,fecukp1,t3_eohr15,1578985207.0,Public speaking classes might be of a help. I had the same thing with me. I hated my voice. A friend advised me to take singing lessons and public speaking classes. It helped me develop confidence.
