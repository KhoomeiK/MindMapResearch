Parenting,feupy02,t1_feup1fe,1579388897.0,"Yes I am, well at least I think I am..., I'm 23 and I live in a small town so it's hard to find things to do."
Parenting,fes2q9d,t1_fervchg,1579360817.0,"You both have some great points. I take it as ""get the social interaction wherever it comes from"""
AmIBeingTooSensitive,fen3yrt,t3_epx2d6,1579276447.0,"I say do it while you still can. There will be days to come that you don't have the time and actually want to. Then there could be a day where they're gone and it's too late. 

And you have no idea how much it could hurt your parents feelings for rejecting them. They just might not say how much it hurts."
needadvice,fen37mr,t3_epphpu,1579275970.0,Are you thinking about college? I don't know what universities are like where you're from but in the U.S. there is free professional counseling at a lot of universities. I went just once and it was very helpful.
workingmoms,fehs9dv,t1_fehr30d,1579122858.0,"I have to use the pump both at work and at home. My baby was never able to latch on properly :(

I also have a hard time trusting people at work, I work at a college and I'm around all kinds of people."

workingmoms,fehm9x2,t1_fehi66c,1579119419.0,"That would be great if my son didn't go to 3 different people throughout the week.

Good tip though!"
workingmoms,feh9faa,t1_feh1uol,1579111894.0,Thanks!
workingmoms,feh02tg,t1_fegzwie,1579106320.0,"I know right? Now I gotta leave the house with baby, the baby's bag, my purse, a laptop bag, lunch bag, and breast pump bag. It's insane!"

college,fd3d997,t3_ejrq13,1578157144.0,I took a course at a community college separate from the university. It worked out well
Parenting,fcznxcy,t1_fcznpwf,1578105370.0,My son was only good when he had the drops at least twice a day every day. Maybe that is the case.
Parenting,fczbn5l,t3_ejlt47,1578097660.0,"The painful sounding scream is the worst. My son had it every time he had bad gas. Gas drops every day has done wonders. Do you think this might help? Other than that, it's good to just walk away and take a breath. Getting therapy is also good"
TooAfraidToAsk,fcpihmk,t1_fcpgybm,1577865189.0,Sorry but in this situation that's what you should want.
CasualConversation,fcpbzow,t3_eidhdp,1577857699.0,"Congratulations! Pregnancy is not easy at all but it's worth it when it's what you want! I love my 5 month old so much and if you have any questions for someone with recent experience, ask away!"
Dreams,fcpbawo,t3_eidg1w,1577856987.0,I've had very similar dreams to this only the tornado was going to my parents house and went directly over as it got to it and went back down after it left the yard. In other dreams I go all the way to my grandmas house which is 10 miles out of town because there was some magic force field around it.
Mommit,fco5k2l,t3_ehwzn5,1577824496.0,"My dad gave my son a lollipop when he was 3 months old without my permission. He's now 5 months and and my mom just gave him a couple of spoonfuls of ice cream. I see that being fine on special occasions. We're not extremely strict though on food. We already gave him his first bites of food. We gave him a blended soup with butternut squash, sweet potato, apple, leeks, bacon, salt, and pepper. Also we're Mexican so he's definitely already had beans."
Parenting,fcj5rj9,t3_ehfxb8,1577677951.0,"Take care of it right away. There's a cousin in my fiance's family that has that issue and still struggles with it in his 40's. He has special needs and no one really made him stop before. He'll go up to members of the family, usually young children, take off their socks and caress their feet. It is so inappropriate but no one makes him stop. He'll go up to my 5 month old and try to take off his socks. I hate having to stop him and not let him be alone with him. 

Don't let it continue and get outside help right away. This man has even gotten into legal trouble with this issue. Pleade don't let it get to this level."
college,fciq14w,t3_ehb31t,1577667096.0,"I actually had ""self-paced"" courses at a semester-to-semester school. We were given all assignments at the beginning and had until the end of semester to complete everything. I ended up finishing the first two classes in 8 weeks. It was great to complete things early and have time for other classes."

college,fci48pe,t3_eh7a4u,1577657596.0,"Arizona to New Mexico, everything transferred but had to take a couple extra classes that AZ didn't require. But I think it was a good experience to go to a new place and have both CC and university experience. There were a lot more activities and opportunities at the university."
popularopinion,fcb27ty,t3_egyvpf,1577581307.0,Are there people who actually eat them with mayonnaise?
CasualConversation,fc2wah9,t3_efp1nb,1577375741.0,"In the past two months I've had 2 funerals and a wedding. There was even a night that my baby spent in the hospital when he was 4 months old. 

It has definitely been rushed for all of us. My baby isn't even old enough to enjoy it."
