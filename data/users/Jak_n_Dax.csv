First of all, there are actually two levels of dispatch. There are the 911 call takers, and then the ones that actually send out the units. Basically, the 911 taker talks to the person calling, and keeps them on the line until emergency personnel arrive on scene. The actual dispatcher(fire, police) figures out which units are the best response and sends them to the incident.


That being said, dispatchers only get pieces of the puzzle. The 911 call taker is going to be hearing the caller’s perspective, and they will be notified of the response, but they won’t be listening to the responder’s radio transmissions. On the flip side, the dispatcher will be in communication with the responders, but won’t hear anything from the caller, except what the 911 call taker relays to them. 


As far as follow up, it’s like OP said, there’s no real way to get news after an incident, other than the normal channels. It’s just on to the next incident. Most of the time, you won’t even know something was big unless you saw it on the news later."

In the US it’s illegal to deny emergency care. If someone comes in and can’t pay, they get treatment and then the hospital “writes it off”. These expenses are then passed on to the paying customers, since the hospital execs still have to make a profit. 


On top of this, poor people end up in the ER *more* than people with insurance, because they can’t afford regular care, and they end up with a higher percentage of health problems. 


Bottom line; those with insurance are not only paying for those without, but spending more on the poor than themselves in most cases. All so insurance companies can be the “middle man” and take a nice chunk of profit for nothing."
