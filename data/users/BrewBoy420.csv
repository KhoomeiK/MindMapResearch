Also being so soon after the bombs drop, it feels very likely that things might shift more with constant nukes being dropped by vault dwellers. Unmarked minor locations, cabins & structures should definitely be build and scrapable. 

I'm praying that wastelanders will fill out all of these locations and give them life again, super mutants and mole miners are shitty company."
