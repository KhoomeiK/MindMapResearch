aww,ffpqw2c,t3_eu6q0t,1580102531.0,"My old cat used to play fetch with the plastic strips you pull off frozen juice cans. Then one day he came running in the the half inch wide, five foot long plastic strip off of a big box of printer paper. He was so thrilled and proud of himself!"
AmItheAsshole,ffpqfuw,t3_eu7pu2,1580102110.0,"OP is NTA. Damn, people! I am just amazed at how rigid people are about flying and getting their perfect seat and screw everyone else. ""She should have been there earlier and boarded with families. She should have paid extra for priority seating"". Seriously, any AITA regarding flight seating is a foregone conclusion that they are TA. I've seen people behave more pleasantly on the NYC subway than the way people talk about flying here!

The woman is trying to wrangle three kids, one of which is a baby that has to be carried along with, no doubt a diaper bag and various carry-ons filled with stuff to keep her kids occupied so they don't annoy all the people who are desperate to get a seat as far away from the kids as possible. 

Here's a thought. How about we all try to cut each other some slack when flying (which has become a very uncomfortable experience in the last number of years) in the hope of making it just a little more comfortable for our fellow travelers.

And people wonder why kids cry on planes. If I had to fly with a lot of you guys I would probably cry too."

thedawnpatrol,ffpklwq,t3_eu77te,1580097326.0,"Interestingly, I just finished OOTS in my rereading of the books in chronological order and I think your idea would have been great. Anything to lessen the amount of angst expressed by Lionheart, Jayfeather and (to a lesser extent) Hollyleaf. 

This arc has some of my favorite storylines and my two favorite characters, Hollyleaf and Fallen Leaves. I love the details about the Ancients and the Tribe of Rushing Water/Endless Hunting are great but the whinging and moaning by the younger cats (including Dovewing) can be tough to get through. I do think there were missed opportunities for some more interesting scenes and encounters. Afterall, just about everybody who was anybody was there!"

I can't help but but feel there is an element of anti-Semitism in these exchanges between the OP and the barista. 

OP you are NTA, but if you are hesitant in addressing this with the manager it might help to think of the other customers that she is behaving this way to.

It is not your responsibility to preserve this person's job. In fact, it would be a disservice to her to not raise it with the manager. It deprives her of the opportunity to be coached to improve her customer service skills or to peruse a different line of work."

AmItheAsshole,fe073q6,t1_fdz6uf1,1578804784.0,"OP was led to believe (for months and by her FDIL) that she would have a role to play. The sudden change (and the insults) have quite understandably hurt her feeling. This whole MOB runs the show stuff is really outdated, if they were really following tradition, the bride's family should be paying for the wedding, not the groom!

But, it looks like both bride and groom are aquiescing  for whatever reason.

I would advise OP, when she calms down and had a chance to process, have a talk with FDIL to express some of her disappointment (because otherwise it will fester) and then take the high road and back off. She will come off as the sane parent which will go far with her FDIL and likely her son as well. NTA"

I really don't consider them children's books at all. Terrible things happen in these books! Terrible terrible things! Things that will haunt you.

I am currently rereading in chronological order because some things were happening in the later books that made me question my memories of the earlier books. I am currently on the Power of Three arc and I had forgotten how good they are!

I particularly like the spiritual aspects of the series which is kind of odd seeing as I am an atheist and POT focuses a lot on that.

That being said, I completely ignore the manga books and a lot of the fan art as that is just not my thing. Everyone seems to get different things from these books and I see that as a very good thing and suggests that there is a lot to be found."
