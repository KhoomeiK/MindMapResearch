rarepuppers,ff8h0ce,t3_es29jv,1579678092.0,So very true. I had a black lab named Sadie. One of her favorite foods was pickles.  She would eat pretty much anything.  I miss her so very much.
JUSTNOMIL,ff7y14t,t3_erza38,1579661063.0,I am so very sorry for your loss. My heart goes out to you and your DP. Screw Pandora. She needs to shut up and leave you alone. It makes my blood boil just thinking about what she said to you. I've had a miscarriage. And you don't just get over it. Not if you are a normal human.  She shouldn't get anything for her birthday. Not even a call or text.  You are in my thoughts and prayers. I know how hard it is to go through a D & C. Huge hugs to you.
AskReddit,ff4at5p,t3_ergjyj,1579559297.0,I work at the bull's-eye store. The new loyalty program requires you to either put in your phone number or say no thanks on the credit card terminal.  I was working at guest services and this woman came over and said she forgot to put in her phone number and she wanted me to fix it. Normally not an issue but she had received a gift card due to some items she was purchasing and had already used it. I told her that in order to get her 1% credit she could easily scan her receipt and it would be fine. She flat out refused. My co worker came over because the lady was getting angry at me for taking so long. We couldn't just void the payment because of the gift card. My co worker spent 20 minutes with this lady all because she wouldn't scan the receipt. It was really stupid.
disneyemojiblitz,ff3xv65,t3_eri1qw,1579551231.0,"He's my go to guy. I love him.  I haven't hit the 70,000 mark but I've come close."
AskReddit,ff0j0vk,t3_eqvh0p,1579469332.0,I'm surviving. I wish I had a good guy in my life but I don't see it happening anytime soon. Due to pain issues I've gained some weight and don't feel good about myself. I'm working on the pain issue. I just miss having someone special.
disneyemojiblitz,fexz5vx,t3_equzgd,1579438632.0,There is no ethical way to get more gems or coins other than playing your heart out and spinning the wheel. I've been playing since December 2016. And I have my silvers maxed and almost series 1. You just have to play. I honestly have put in a lot of money into the game. But I know other people don't. My money has gone towards gems. I have time hopped in the past but I don't really do that anymore. I just play. You will get there.
TalesFromTheCustomer,few6wks,t1_fevtmrh,1579406165.0,I love that.  It would sure help with mistakes. But I work for Target and with it being such a big corporation it's so much easier for mistakes to be made.
TalesFromTheCustomer,fetgm52,t1_fesu60p,1579375211.0,That's too funny. I've seen the registers make a mistake. Or if the item won't scan and you manually put in the numbers and get something wrong. I did that for a lady in my first week.  Something that should have been a few dollars came up as a piece of furniture for over $400. We both noticed right away and I fixed it before she paid. But mistakes happen.  You apologize and fix it.
TalesFromTheCustomer,fetfqgy,t1_feso43m,1579375022.0,Oh I would have been very upset. Just over her attitude. No one should be like that and work in retail.
TalesFromTheCustomer,fesjkci,t3_eqhcja,1579365861.0,As someone who works as both a cashier and at guest services this who transaction baffles me. Yes it's hard to make a mistake when you scan an item. But I've seen items ring up wrong.  And I have accidently grabbed other people's items because there was no barrier in between the orders and I had no idea it wasn't the persons item. There really should be no questions asked when doing a return like that. You just fix the problem. Even if you think it's not an error you fix it. And the whole tax thing is ridiculous. Our registers ask us if it's taxable if the item was purchased in another state. I live in state with no sales tax but right across the river is another state that does have it. The register makes doing a return like that so much easier. I really hope this person was talked to. Having an attitude like that is not suitable for retail. Everyone makes mistakes. You just fix them and move on.
disneyemojiblitz,fepa45a,t3_eqa3wj,1579315555.0,I have almost the exact same 3 challenges. But my middle one is to use a Moana character. It's very frustrating. But at the end of the day it's just a game. I'm almost half way through map 3 so I'll be able to work on the challenges soon.
TalesFromTheCustomer,fenvjvj,t3_eq15sd,1579291563.0,As someone who works the service desk all the time I can't even fathom talking to someone like that. I would have changed the price to reflect what you saw and give you that money back. It's just that simple. I have a couple of Co workers who probably shouldn't work at the service desk.  But I've never heard anyone be mean or disrespectful to a guest.
doggos,fei710c,t3_ep8u10,1579131704.0,I'm so very sorry for the loss of your sweet fur baby. She looked like she was an amazing dog. My heart goes out to you.
AnimalsBeingDerps,fei6guo,t3_ep95y0,1579131342.0,My heart goes out to you on the loss of your sweet fur baby. I'm so very sorry. He looks like he was the bestest of fur babies.
JUSTNOMIL,fefucn5,t3_eowtvy,1579065472.0,Please stay strong. It hurts my heart that your family has gone to her side. She's more manipulative than I thought she was.  She has them under her thumb. And it's so sad. Keep moving on. If you need us we are all here for you. And if you ever want to talk I am happy to listen. You are so very strong. You deserve happiness.
HumansBeingBros,fe62chz,t1_fe60mxk,1578880220.0,"Oh that's not nice. I'd never get mad at someone for paying me a compliment.  Now I've had people get angry that I have to see their ID. I tell them it's Targets rule. We have to see it for alcohol, some cold medication and some video games."
HumansBeingBros,fe5xfud,t3_ennz8e,1578877101.0,I have to ask for ID to sell alcohol. I always tell the little old ladies they don't look a day over 21 so how do I know that they are of age. I love seeing people smile.
offmychest,fe4304m,t1_fe0ogok,1578855276.0,"I was going to write the same thing. I work at Target too.  We have walkies for multiple reasons. As a woman this post scares me. You should always feel safe grocery shopping.  Men like this need to be stopped. Please go back to the store and talk to them. Trust me, we have cameras. They will hopefully find him and you can press charges. Good luck."
JUSTNOMIL,fe3zsv3,t3_enp4ge,1578854434.0,I'm so immensely happy that you are getting support from most of your family. No one deserves the life that you were forced to lead. To say I'm proud of you is an understatement.  I fled an abusive marriage so I know it's hard to start over. You are so strong and smart and your future is so bright. Keep us updated my dear. You are in all of our hearts.
TalesFromTheCustomer,fdxqqwo,t1_fdxkoom,1578771938.0,I totally agree with you. I lost my job in June (no fault of mine) and could not find anyone willing to give me a chance. I'm older but so experienced. They want someone right out of school who will take minimum wage. I even taught myself how to do medical coding for the eye doctor I worked for. I understand how insurances work and how billing works. You can't learn all of that in a few months. I took a job in retail because I needed to. But my people skills are still used here and very much appreciated.
TalesFromTheCustomer,fdxebmm,t3_en9473,1578767919.0,I've worked as a medical receptionist for over 25 years and have never worked in an office that is this horrible. One doctor I worked for was notorious for running 2 hours behind. But I would have moved heaven and earth to make sure you were seen in a timely manner so your life wasn't turned upside down. I always did anything I could to make the patients life easier. That is how an office should be run. I'd take the time to find a new office that will see you in a timely manner and not take forever to get you test results. Good luck.
JUSTNOMIL,fdribay,t3_emt4c9,1578684938.0,Congratulations. I'm so immensely proud of you.  And happy for you.  After your stuff is out you can really start your life. Good luck.
JUSTNOMIL,fdq2c3p,t3_emle52,1578651417.0,"I'm so immensely proud of you. The world needs more kind,  compassionate,  strong and brilliant vets like you. I'd proudly take my fur baby to you. Congratulations on following your heart and finally realizing your potential. Huge hugs to you. Your future is so bright. Good luck!  And tell your mom. Do not let her spoil this for you.  She should know that you are doing what God meant for you to do."
IDontWorkHereLady,fdnw1pf,t1_fdnnwj5,1578594002.0,I work at Target.  Our management is Very into giving good customer service. We have 4 self checkouts. I have seen women with full carts check out there. A lot of people decide that at the check out is the best time to see if there is anything on sale. We can't hurry them along. We can grab a device and start checking people out who are in line. I believe in giving the best customer service possible. When I'm a customer I do my hardest to make life easier on cashiers.  And I thank them.  A lot. I use the self checkout at my Walmart but I'm so quick that it doesn't matter how many items I have. I just get it done quickly.
IDontWorkHereLady,fdm8ht8,t1_fdm80zr,1578542420.0,I like helping people when they really need it. My state just stopped having plastic bags in the store. So now people have to ask us for one. But I'm proactive and will ask someone if they want one. Especially if they have a lot of stuff. And if we aren't busy I'll bag their things.
IDontWorkHereLady,fdlj2t3,t3_elz64r,1578525124.0,As someone who man's the self checkout lane at my store I thank you. So many people come through and want us to do everything for them. And they have carts full of merchandise.  We can't tell them no they can't use the self checkout but we also can't spend 10 minutes on them alone. We have other machines to watch over. I've had people get angry that I can't give them my undivided attention. That is what a cashier is for. I'm sure the self checkout attendant was very grateful for you standing up for them. You probably made that persons day better.
HumansBeingBros,fdlioj4,t3_elwcr6,1578524873.0,I'm so sorry for the loss of your fur baby. My vet did the same thing when I lost my dog and cat. It was very sweet. Vets and their staff have the best hearts. I'll give my fur baby a big hug when I get home.
TalesFromTheCustomer,fdjf0m0,t1_fdjev1f,1578468034.0,There are enough drama queens in the world so I always appreciate the kind ones. And I do thank them when I can.  I believe in helping people and making their day brighter.
AskReddit,fdjey13,t3_elju40,1578467953.0,I used to be a receptionist at a pediatric office. The worst that I saw was a mom named her little girl Phelony. She was so proud of that name. I wanted to smack her.  I saw a lot of strange ones but that was the worst.
TalesFromTheCustomer,fdjea7o,t3_elmbja,1578467197.0,Thank you for writing this. This was my first year working in retail over the holidays. It wasn't that bad but there were people who made some days awful. And there were people (like you)  who made some days amazing. I'm really good with people (25+ years as a receptionist) so my manager put me at the service desk a lot. You get a lot of crap from people there. I just smile and I'm extra nice to them. You and your buddy are why I love working with so many different people. Thank you!  I have been in the cashiers place so I know he was grateful.  Huge hugs to you for being an awesome human.
TalesFromTheCustomer,fd4ozsz,t3_ejtpyf,1578169583.0,In my store we would have defected it. Now if someone had found it like that and had asked for a discount we would happily give it.  Our managers give us a lot of leeway in situations like this. And it makes the guest happy. That is our primary goal. That set should never have gone back out on the shelf. And in our store there would be no way to break the set up and sell it like that.
JUSTNOMIL,fczzzli,t1_fczgzt1,1578111555.0,Much safer thank you!  That kiddo is now 26 and does not remember the incident.  But I will never forget it. It was really scary to be looking down at a 3 year old holding a loaded gun on me.
JUSTNOMIL,fcz8bdp,t3_ejg5ki,1578095702.0,So my first husband and I had a gun.  I never wanted it loaded but he said it was fine. That our son did not know where it was. Guess what our little one did know where it was. One evening I was on the phone with my mom and my son got mad at me. I went to look for him and he was walking up to me pointing the gun at me. To say I freaked out was an understatement. I knew it was loaded and that my idiot husband did not have the safety on. I took the gun from him and put it away. He went after it again. When I told my husband about it he thought it was funny. Said what a good boy he had to know how to hold a gun. I ended up deciding to move out a few months later. Kids are smart and very curious.
tattoos,fcz3ilp,t3_ejkmdq,1578092926.0,My heart goes out to you on the loss of your son. Your tattoo is a beautiful tribute to him. Huge hugs to you.
JUSTNOMIL,fcwo3pi,t1_fcwd10m,1578031271.0,Judged is exactly how my ex MIL made me feel.  Don't get me wrong we also had really good times. I have fond memories of her. But her and my SIL wanted me to follow the religion even though I wasn't part of it. My nieces had never had a haircut in their lives and they were pre-teens. They also had this rule they wanted me to follow in that I kept my hair up unless my husband was there with me. I was not going to follow all their rules and therec was a lot of them. This was over 20 years ago. I will never forget all their rules.
JUSTNOMIL,fcwap57,t1_fcw9xmr,1578021035.0,I had a lot of issues with things she said and did and the same with my ex sister in law. Her 4 kids never went to school and were very immature in some aspects. The girls cried when I cut my hair and said I now look like a man (I could never look like a man).  There was so much more over the years. Thankfully a year or so after her comments I left my husband and moved out of state.  Thank you for letting me know that it wasn't really her religion talking but just her being a little crazy.
JUSTNOMIL,fcw9gat,t3_ej3zhw,1578020205.0,"Your post makes my heart hurt for you. I can't even begin to tell you how wrong she is about you. You are strong and incredible and you deserve happiness and love. She is so incredibly cruel. I really hope that your DH will keep his word and not have anything to do with her. Please do not let her get to you. You are none of the things she's accused you of. 

Sending you huge hugs."
TalesFromTheCustomer,fctbmpu,t3_eim4iw,1577938237.0,Thank you for posting this. I have worked in the medical field as a receptionist for over 25 years. I lost my job in June and the only place that would hire me was Target. I haven't worked retail in over 30 years. I try to be kind and nice to everyone I deal with. They have me at the service desk most days because I'm good at it. But there are times it's hard. It would make my day if someone would appreciate my service like you just did. I hope the person who helped you sees this and knows they are appreciated.
disneyemojiblitz,fcrar14,t3_eikfih,1577899240.0,Have you time hopped to get more lives?  During the team events you can't do that. It will reset the counter.
AskReddit,fcr92lp,t3_eifsmg,1577898546.0,Search lights. Back when they would be set up to open a movie or store or something. I thought they were aliens coming after me.
JUSTNOMIL,fcpkz5p,t3_eicj00,1577866617.0,Congratulations! So excited for you and your DH.  He sounds amazing and just what you are going to need in the coming months.
IDontWorkHereLady,fco2osm,t3_ei5jm4,1577822945.0,"As a target employee who is sitting in my lunchroom as we speak,  I'm looking at 3 people wearing maroon and 1 wearing a black and white striped shirt. None of us are wearing khaki pants because we can wear jeans.  Even black jeans like I have on.  So I can kinda understand her confusion for a brief minute. But she treated you and the manager horribly. Everyone who works here is supposed to wear a name tag but some don't. I'm sorry she was so awful to you. You should never have to go through that."
ChoosingBeggars,fcleu70,t1_fcksx44,1577746158.0,"I had a customer call and want to do a return over the phone. It was for something she bought online and didn't want to bring it into the store to return. She said she changed her mind and wanted her money back. Nope that is not how it works. You can change your mind but you have to bring the item into the store. 

I work at the bull's-eye store and our policy is usually 90 days. I was taking to someone who worked at Kohls and she said they take back anything. She said someone returned something from 2016. And they don't question it."
offmychest,fcl0bm1,t1_fckzpcl,1577737041.0,I used to work for DHS and was a mandatory reporter. It wasn't until I started working for DHS and went through domestic violence classes that I realized what I went through was domestic violence.  My ex never laid a hand on me.  It was all emotional and psychological. It's hard to see it when you are in it. Your friend needs a lot of love and help.  Your state may even have a domestic violence grant that will help her leave. Thank you for being there. She really needs you.
offmychest,fckysao,t3_ehobx5,1577736092.0,I'm so proud of you for doing the right thing. It is hard to watch someone you love go through that.  I've been in your friends place. It's hard to leave.  But I did and it made my life better. Calling child welfare is what is right in this situation. I hope everything turns out well for your friend. She is going to need you.
disneyemojiblitz,fcawqhv,t1_fcagmql,1577578128.0,Not looking forward to that day. Ten percent is already really low. I miss the days of less new characters and a better chance of getting them.
JUSTNOMIL,fca1thz,t1_fca181v,1577561737.0,She's totally a hero. A very strong one. My ex married me as a smoke shield.  His family wanted him to settle down and he finally found an idiot (me) who believed his lies and promises. I thought he was going to be a great dad to my boys (not).  I found out after he passed away that he tried to molest my oldest son. He didn't do anything but told my son if he told anyone he'd kick us out. The abuse I went through is nothing compared to you and this woman.  I have so much love and respect for both of you.
disneyemojiblitz,fca0s3y,t3_egud8k,1577561131.0,I totally agree with you. I got another Holiday Minnie. I like her but I really wanted one of the two new ones. I do have 2 devices so after awhile I did get them both. But I did buy more gems. It's gotten a little frustrating to have so many new characters per update and the chances of getting one is getting more and more rare.
JUSTNOMIL,fc8mr24,t3_egp0u9,1577538099.0,"I'm so incredibly proud of you. I walked away from an abusive relationship in 2013. He never put his hands on me or my youngest son but it was still abusive. I had my plan in place for awhile so I was able to take more but I had to leave my 4 dogs behind. That broke my heart. My ex and I never divorced and he passed away suddenly 4 years ago. I had to help his family go through his things and we discovered so many secrets.  It broke me all over again. 

I know leaving everything behind was hard but you need to do it. For you and your son. Abusive people rarely change and it sounds like your ex is one of the worst. You and your son are in my thoughts and prayers. I hope everything starts getting better for you. You will find happiness and love someday.  That is my greatest wish for you. Huge hugs to you. If you want to talk please know I'd be here to listen. As one survivor to another."
doggos,fc2bplk,t3_efrrz3,1577350726.0,Sending Bentley lots of healing love and belly rubs. And sending you big hugs.  I have found through the pain of watching my fur baby hurt and not being able to do much about it. I hope Bentley feels better soon. Lots of love to you both.
TalesFromTheCustomer,fc1rm40,t3_efkai3,1577327522.0,"I work at the bull's-eye store and one of my jobs is to get people their in store pickup items. I would have done the same thing for you. Our managers have made it a point to tell us that we need to help make the guests happy. I love being able to make someone's day like this. It makes me feel good. I'm so happy you got a beautiful pair of earrings for a fantastic price. And as someone who also has sensitive ears, a good pair of earrings is hard to find."
MadeMeSmile,fc1qlkr,t3_eflzqr,1577326596.0,Congratulations! And Merry Christmas. Next year will be such a special Christmas with your new bundle of joy. I'm beyond happy for you both.
IDontWorkHereLady,fc0y2lf,t1_fc0xqb6,1577302789.0,"Yeah that's weird. And wrong. But my store is very lax on the dress code. I've only been there since August. I always wear the red shirt and jeans. We were told in training that our shirts can't say anything on them. Well people wear Nike shirts and Trailblazers shirts all the time. And so many people were shirts that aren't red. To me it's weird. Why have the dress code then.  They are supposed to wear a red vest or sweater but they don't. Sorry ranting a bitb lol. 

Merry Christmas to you. I hope if you have to work tomorrow that it's a good day. They didn't put me at the service desk so I'm happy. But they next week or so that is pretty much where I'm at"
IDontWorkHereLady,fc0whku,t3_efioxn,1577301529.0,I am also a Target employee and can confirm we are told not to help anyone off the clock. We are to find an employee to help them but we aren't supposed to help. It doesn't stop me from doing it though. Especially when I am on a break or lunch and I have my name tag on. If it's quick I have no problem helping. If not I'll find someone else. This lady was crazy and horrible. I hope she did go to management and they told her the same thing.
disneyemojiblitz,fbyg115,t1_fbyft58,1577215972.0,I don't have any vices so I can afford to buy gems from time to time. I have been playing for 3 years now. And I have not missed an exclusive character. They may not be over level 1 or 2 but I have them.  Good luck on getting Mickey. I love him.
disneyemojiblitz,fbyeu50,t1_fby5k7s,1577215120.0,I know that there are instructions somewhere but what I do is make sure both my devices are up to date. Then I log into my phone and buy a box. If I don't like what I got I go to my tablet. When you log into the second device it will ask you if you want to keep the server info or that device info.  Keep the device info because that one will have the 200 gems you just spent. Then buy a box.  Hopefully you will get what you want. I know that there are other ways to do it. But this is the only way I have found.  I do spend money on this game. I hope this helps a little bit.
disneyemojiblitz,fbxprcq,t1_fbxp13f,1577197026.0,Well at least he's cute. Lol Happy Holidays to you too. I am heading into work and I'm not looking forward to it. I work at Target and I know it's going to be insane today. Lol
disneyemojiblitz,fbxor88,t1_fbxoap3,1577196129.0,Having a second device makes it a lot easier to get what you want. I have my phone and tablet. I've been playing since December 2016. I have not missed an exclusive character yet. I hope you get him. He's not great for scores or coins but items he's a rockstar.  Good luck my fellow blitzer!
disneyemojiblitz,fbxo0m3,t3_ef17c9,1577195434.0,Holiday Mickey is always worth it. I did buy one box and of course I got another Abominable Snowman.  Lol My Holiday Mickey is a level 4. That is after him coming back numerous times. I use him a lot for item challenges.
AskReddit,fbtzg46,t1_fbtxkad,1577103653.0,Wow I did not hear about that. That is awful. I think for most people they are great.  But some of us out there are not so lucky. I work at the bull's-eye store and we have a hard time keeping them in stock. Even the ones made for children are snatched up very quickly when a new shipment comes in.
