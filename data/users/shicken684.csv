That sounds like a huge bump but they completely eliminated all out of pocket cost.  I can go to the ER, primary doc, specialist, have surgery, etc.  No co-pay, no deductible, no co-insurance.  I get my treatment and never get a bill.  Yet every idiot in my lab wants the old coverage that sucked if you actually got sick.  

We've even had people opt out of the union because of this.  It's times like this that I realize we probably deserve everything shitty coming to us.

personalfinance,ff2el0y,t1_ff2e4d1,1579502913.0,"It certainly can be advantageous to finance through them, so go for it if it's right for you. Just do the homework and spend a lot of time looking everything over.

What almost screwed us (and something we're still fighting over) is our builder charged us $250/day fee for closing after construction was finished since we used an outside lender. The only reason our lender didn't close on time was due to the appraiser not getting access to the house from the builder until the last minute. We're 100% convinced they're just pissed at us for not using their financing.

So just make sure you're aware of fees like that if you go outside for financing. You have to read everything. Both of you. Sometimes multiple times.

Edit : our final penalty  was $750. They charged us over the weekend... Still waiting to here back from the state attorney General and CFPB over the legality of that. There's no financial institution in the world closing mortgages on Sunday."
personalfinance,ff2diak,t3_er8p7z,1579501736.0,"Call around for home owners insurance and ask them what the rate will be when the home no longer qualifies as new construction. You get fairly deep discounts for a new build. Also check with the county auditor to get a good idea of what your property tax liability is. We just built a house, and while our mortgage is lower than what we were paying in rent our property tax is around $6000 a year.


Another word of advice, don't necessarily sign with the builders financing. They will wave a bunch of money in your face but we hired a mortgage broker who got us an awesome deal with Huntington that saved us $3900 in closing cost. We built through Pulte and they offered money off upgrades and $4000 off closing costs and matched interest rates. Sounded great until you pried the final fee structure from them and it was loaded with bullshit. We still got the discounted upgrades after a few days of haggling. Spend the time, look around, and hire a pro if you are feeling lost. Also get a real estate agent that specializes in new construction. It won't cost you (they are paid by the builder) and while ours didn't do a whole bunch during the build process she haggled with our broker and builder and was a key part of getting us the discounts and better rates.

Just wanted to share my experience of building. It's a fun process and I'm glad we did it."

Now  if he was posing an immediate threat that was deserving of assassination is highly suspect.

There are horrific people all over the world. Lots of them planning our demise and looking for ways to kill members of our military. That doesn't mean you can just go around dropping bombs on them. You limit what they can do and protect against the attacks the best you can. Because if you do a direct attack like Trump just did you risk escalating a relatively minor conflict (to the USA) into a full blown war that will cost thousands to millions of people to die and become displaced.

This fucker has been around since the beginning of the Iraqi invasion a decade ago. He was known to the Bush administration and Obama. Regardless of his direct involvement in attacks on American troops they let him be because it would likely escalate attacks rather than stop them.

Oh, and let's not forget that attacks via Iranian backed proxies had mostly, if not entirely, stopped. They started again after Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal with zero fucking plan on what to do next.


Edit: Do the people down voting me really not understand what this guy has been up to for the past decade? He should not have been killed, full stop.

For me I abstained from all bad food for about six months and lost a ton of weight. I felt great, looked great, confidence off the charts. Then I went on vacation and had some crappy food and sweets. I fell off the wagon hardcore and gained all the weight back in six months.

But cutting Nassib last season when we had zero other pass rushers outside Garrett was stupid.  Not saying Nassib is a great talent but 
 he was a better pass rusher than anyone who replaced him. 
 Trading away our blocking TE's was stupid and cost us games this year.  Drafting Corbett was a huge bust.  Callaway Bust, Avery bust, Thomas we'll see about.

TalesFromThePizzaGuy,fcgni5r,t3_eh6gml,1577642062.0,It amazes me how places like this can stay open for years and years. Meanwhile places that are run like a well oiled machine struggle to keep the lights on.
politics,fcg3acz,t1_fcfyl2l,1577636110.0,"And that thought process is exactly why Dems will keep losing senate seats and presidential elections.  It's absolute bullshit that you can't win over those voters.  Progressive policies can, and should be about helping those who are struggling.  There are a lot of people struggling right now but rural communities, and coal country are some of the worst.  That's why they latched onto the bullshit spewed by Fox and Trump.  They're the only ones telling those people their lives matter, even if everything they get told is absolute bullshit that does nothing to help them."
politics,fcft4qz,t1_fcfgku6,1577633459.0,Or here's a fucking thought. Maybe have democrats start appealing to middle America as well as large cities and population hubs. Push hard on the green new deal and have the candidates spend time in rural states explaining how that's going to help small farm communities and areas that are dependent on oil.

politics,fc7kul8,t1_fc7iowh,1577510688.0,It does seem to be happening. Rust belt cities are on the rebound and they're cheap places to live. I've wanted to move away from northeast Ohio my whole life but I just have it too good here. Job that pays top 10% in my field while having low cost of living is just too damn good to pass up. A lot of my friends have moved back or have relocated to Columbus which is in full blown boom territory.
