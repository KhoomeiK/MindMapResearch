Prank: a trick that is intended to be funny but not to cause harm or damage. Drugs can cause harm and damage, especially if you are unaware of it happening. What if it caused Bert to have a heart attack or something? It didn't, thankfully, but the outcome doesn't automatically make it okay."

socialskills,ffi4up4,t3_etrobo,1579965122.0,"To put it simply, counselors or therapists could be considered experts in broad areas, whereas psychologists have additional training and education on certain aspects of mental health. These differences become particularly visible when you see the type of disorders that they treat and the levels of severity in their clients. In some cases, psychologists may be able to treat conditions that a counselor cannot.

So yes, psychologists do have a bit more formal education than counselors but both are licensed to practice within their respective state. If you have anymore questions, feel free to ask."

The chamber itself is just a wide open bowl, super easy to wipe with a cotton bud and some ISO. I've had one for a little over a year now and it still works amazingly for me. [Vapefiend](https://vapefiend.co.uk/products/sapphire-by-storm-vaporizer) it's £59, use code 420 for £10 off. Cheap, durable, reliable, and works GREAT. And no torch necessary to heat it up.

Edit: I recommend buying a pack of like 100 generic stainless steel screens from Amazon or something and cut them to size yourself. They don't have to be perfect. but the replacement screens they sell pre-cut are too costly to keep buying over and over plus paying shipping on top of that. I just roughly cut it to size and it works great."

He was illegally sharing music for years himself then starts the war on Napster because it hurt their sales. A bit hypocritical, imo.

All in all though, they did a good deed donating a LOT of money to help Australia. So good on them for that!"
