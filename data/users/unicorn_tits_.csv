aww,feiwxyi,t1_feiulzn,1579149479.0,Oh neat! Lucky pup. I figured it would be something like that. I work for a swimming pool company and I'm 99.9% sure that is one of the liner pattern choices.

AmItheAsshole,fcyznmh,t1_fcytm9t,1578090635.0,"Agreed. Forcing people to do things they don't want to do in general is a bad idea. They just resent you for it. 

Ever have a friend force you to listen to their new favorite song when you're not in the mood? You tell them no but they crank it up anyway? And then you hate that song, and now you're pissed at your friend...? Kinda like that."
AmItheAsshole,fcyya9k,t3_ejgtib,1578089751.0,"NTA. She knew you were a homebody (as am I) when she met you. Aside from that, she should ask you first. Common courtesy. If you were less pressured/forced into these ""social visits"", you would be more inclined to participate willingly."
aww,fcyxxb0,t3_ejfvpe,1578089519.0,My chinchilla used to hop around the living room with us at play time. Little thieves they are! Always swiped smaller items off of the coffee table when we weren't looking. Knew he wasn't supposed to. I miss Kevin. R.i.p little homie.
