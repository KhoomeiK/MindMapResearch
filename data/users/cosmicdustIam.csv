I would like to add something that may be controversial. I believe that happiness is overrated. What we all should actually be working for is peace and tranquility. Happiness and sadness are both alike in regards that both are excited and unstable states and are bound to pass and settle down to equilibrium state just like the vibrating strings of guitar or swinging pendulum. So, even if you do find happiness, it will eventually pass away just like sadness. That means you don't nee to worry about sadness as well.

Now  that I'm clear about my opinions, I'll tell you that there was a time when I was in a peaceful state and nothing good or bad affected me, I accepted all of it as a part of nature's harmony. I believe it was the philosophy of stoicism that lead me to such a state. It was during this time that I formed my above mentioned opinion about peace, happiness and sadness. I was not intentionally looking for it but I found it.

Now fast forward to present, I have been mostly happy lately and it is because meeting new people and coming to new place. But it is not because of me socializing with people. It is because of me getting to learn new stuff. I think getting to learn new things and getting happiness out of it is common among us. It's not something that I am doing intentionally right now as it is just my nature but we surely can make it intentional. And like you I also do reading, walking, eating tasty(not always healthy) food, mindfulness meditation(works for getting a peaceful state), exercising(I enjoy this not because of the reasons told by people, but because I was learning about my body postures and learning how to do weight training).

I hope my experiences that I have shared here will help you.
