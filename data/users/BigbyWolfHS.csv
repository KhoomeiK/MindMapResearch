On another note, why does the democratic party have so much infighting? No candidate will manage to get every blue voter, I can guarantee you that. Meanwhile, over 90% of the red voters will definitely vote for trump.

You have women vs sanders (you're delusional if you think Hillary and Warren didn't make him lose female voters), bernie vs Warren(a lot of people who would vote for either chose a side after the recent ""feud"") , Biden vs young people(he is status quo personified) and sanders vs centrists(he is called a socialist by them, and that's a bad word in the us)

If Hillary couldn't do it(I know she won by 2% in the popular vote, but she had much better chances than anyone of those nominees) I don't see how anyone can get every single blue voter to vote for whoever gets the nomination. I can't see centrists voting for sanders. I can't see Sanders supporters or young people voting for Biden. I can see a lot of Hillary-Warren voters not vote for any man. I don't know about you but 5 more years of trump look much more likely than any other scenario as far as I'm concerned."

People should prepare themselves for 5 more years of trump. If Biden can't do it(which I seriously doubt he can) sanders doesn't even have a chance. The democratic party has fallen to infighting (women vs sanders, young people vs Biden, sanders supporters vs Warren) that no one will get every blue voter to vote for him. Meanwhile trump has like 95% support of the red voters out there. If Hillary couldn't do it, no way these nominees can. The best hope for the blue side is Biden, and I'm sure trump will make the burisma scandal blow up to discredit him enough. The us is still far too young to elect someone as delusionally progressive as sanders.

Make the best out of a bad situation, because if i was a gambling man I'd definitely bet on 5 more years of trump."

Some people still can't understand that a lot of people preferred trump, and race/gender didn't play any roles. It's like saying Obama only won because of his skin, which doesn't reflect well on anyone.

And before people say that the people who vote for trump are racist and skin color plays a part in elections, you are either claiming 1/2 Americans is racist (which is absurd) or you're generalizing. 

It can work both ways, saying it only works one way is hypocritical. Personally, I've met people who voted for Obama because they shared the same skin color and have no idea about his agenda and what he actually did. How is that not a racist way to vote? Or voting for Hillary because she is a woman. How is that not sexist? Unless only a white man can fall into those categories."

But whatever floats your boat. I don't believe sanders is sexist, but I do believe he said a woman can't win (because the us society isn't ready yet or because it would be used against her in her campaign) which isn't something misogynistic. The fact that you completely ignore these scenarios and jump to the Warren hate train because Bernie can do no wrong proves that you suffer from confirmation bias.

You can just say terrorists were there and boom no harm no foul. Do people have goldfish memories? War crimes are always being committed in wars. It's not like this is a trump thing. Don't make it look like one. It's disrespectful to all the victims of American war crimes. Which are plenty."

You should check the Iranian sub and articles about this man and his approval in the country.

So it's not a divisive issue.

Basically the us did the Iranian people a favor. Will it end up being bad in the long run, and was it for the best of the us interests? Possibly. Time will tell. 

Obama destroyed Libya, I don't see many people blaming him more than Trump. Obama sent more troops in the middle east than Trump has done (SA included as well). He said he'd bring back the troops from Afghanistan and went on to redeploy more than ever before iirc. I don't understand why people make a big deal out of such moves now and praise Obama who did far more damage to the middle east than Trump has done. Not to mention the drone strikes in Pakistan against terrorism that weren't authorized which basically killed civilians. Or the prosecution of the freedom of press in the Snowden and wiki leaks cases.

I don't understand why it's so one sided. People are fanboying politicians and neither side sees that."

Is it bad that the us have such a power and can basically kill anyone anytime they want and gather intelligence about everything? Probably. 

Is the world a better place just by value of humans now that he's no longer with us? Absolutely.

I don't understand the obvious propaganda and the one sided spreading of information that's been reddit for the past 6 or so months. If you disagree with something, don't dv to oblivion, just argue in the comment section. Every thread is the same echo chamber of people praising sanders, bashing trump and occasionally spam about AOC.  

There's no constructive dialogue. You need to hear both sides of the story. It's never as one sided as it is presented here. If you like democracy, you respect the opinions of others even when you don't agree with them. I haven't seen this on reddit ever. Don't use this platform as a sole news source. Imo it's as useless as fox News nowadays. And before people label me a trumpet, I've been to more picket lines and protests than most people here. So don't strawman and actually argue with the points.

Anyone who has been here long and likes democracy should agree with me. It's getting sadder and sadder everyday."
