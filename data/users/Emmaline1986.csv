LifeProTips,fej5nhk,t3_epbo8d,1579157878.0," I'm a koala not a bear  
And I don't think it's fair  
The way that people always add a word that isn't there  
I'm a marsupial and proud of it  
And there can be no doubt of it  
I'm closer to a kangaroo than I am to a bear  


So please dont call me a koala bear  
Coz I'm not a bear at all  
Please don't call me a koala bear  
It's driving me up the wall  
If your name was Tom  
And everyone called you Dick  
Perhaps you'd understand why I'm sick, sick, sick  
I'm simply a koala  
And I want the name to stick  
So please don't call me a koala bear  


I live here in Australia  
In a eucalyptus tree  
I'm as cuddly, cute and charming  
as an animal can be  
I don't understand fair dinkum  
How anyone could think them  
Grizzly bears and polar bears  
Are anything like me  


So please don't call me a koala bear  
Coz I'm not a bear at all  
Please don't call me a koala bear  
It's driving me up the wall  
If your name was Tom  
And everyone called you Dick  
Perhaps you'd understand why I'm sick, sick, sick  
I'm simply a koala  
And I want the name to stick  
So please don't call me a koala bear"

AskReddit,fcl840w,t1_fckubth,1577741857.0,Same happened to me. My dad is extremely religious and we were home schooled in a small country town which meant that I didn't leave the house or go to school until I decided to live with my mother at 14. I basically went crazy and was uncontrollable as a teenager.
