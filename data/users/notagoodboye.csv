CrappyDesign,fel02s5,t1_fekxjol,1579211183.0,"Most times they're not fully enclosed like this, they're open on one side and everything has a *very* slight slope to let it drain out. Or it's indoors.

A big concrete hole in the ground without a drain would have to be pumped out...Seems like a lot of work."
CrappyDesign,fekw59f,t3_epouw9,1579208838.0,It's more likely there *is* a drain and it's just clogged...Making a concrete bowl that doesn't drain will never be dry: the concrete won't cure properly if you don't keep it wet early on.

dndmemes,fekvfpe,t3_eplla8,1579208414.0,"I had a bunch of huge binders. Looked like the most impressive shit ever, but most of it was just random brainstormed crap not connected to each other in any way. I'd flip through that like a random encounter table, and write down the date of the last time I used it on the top, so I didn't repeat too often.

I once did a two year campaign that just consisted of me putting the same bad guy in like 100 different random scenarios."
oddlysatisfying,fekurf0,t3_epknyu,1579208016.0,There used to be a bar in NYC that had like 10 single person stalls in a row with glass doors like this. Was always creepy to go in with a huge line of people outside.
todayilearned,feku5hv,t1_feksxty,1579207660.0,"Yea, they make absolutely no bones about it. Even *Tubthumping* itself opens with a quote from a movie about a bunch of coal miners who lost their jobs (*Brassed Off*)"
