The only reason he got it was because he was the first half black president and ran on a campaign of “hope and change” that never happened. It was a joke that he got it and absolutely didn’t deserve it. He was fucking nominated for the prize 11 days after taking office.

politics,fe5be8q,t1_fe5a6zt,1578867308.0,I completely agree with that to. School doesn’t teach anything about the real world honestly and most people forget the stuff they do teach. It’s a huge and complicated issue that I think needs to be resolved which in my opinion will help the issues we are having for future generations.
politics,fe57y8n,t1_fe514j7,1578866409.0,"That’s what welfare or SNAP are for though. I’m not advocating for the removal of it.  But you won’t ever eliminate poverty. In the US a person in poverty is very well off compared to someone in poverty somewhere like Africa. Poverty is a subjective term. Even if you look at history the impoverished have it way better now than they ever did. A rising tide raises all ships both directly and indirectly. You also can’t have winners without losers but the losers shouldn’t be left to starve which is why I’m in favor of the programs I stated above but when a government tries to force companies to instantly hike up pay it will have the opposite effect for a ton of people. Instead of barely making ends meet they won’t be able to make ends meet. I think companies should pay people more and it’s the smarter thing to do for better quality labor and they are shooting themselves in the foot by using low quality labor with less pay in my opinion. But that will lead to better competitors. Look at chick-fil-a for example, they pay better than most fast food chains, have been voted the best for their service quality, and is overall a better experience when you go to one. Compare that to Taco Bell where the service is terrible, they don’t pay their workers as well, and the food quality isn’t good due to trying to cut costs for profit as much as they can. It’s more competitive to try to get a job at a chick-fil-a because of that but a Taco Bell is easy to get a job at. If Taco Bell was forced to raise wages then those people that work there would lose their jobs for better workers."
ToiletPaperUSA,fe3q8v2,t3_enms2y,1578851815.0,I still think it’s hilarious that the far left and far right hate this guy
politics,fe3n1yr,t3_ennzq1,1578850810.0,The alternative is no job. If you force companies to pay more then those jobs become more competitive and the people who had that job will lose it. Then those people will be out of a job because companies will also cut more unnecessary jobs to cover the pay for others. You’ll never be able to tell companies how many jobs they have to provide. A low paying job is always better than no job.

AskReddit,fdp8fjz,t1_fdp6npr,1578622434.0,"At first that was a huge part and made me not like Bernie because he just took it and didn’t say anything after campaigning against Clinton pointing out her corruption, failures as secretary, etc.. and if he easily bends the knee to that kind of corruption from the DNC then how could I expect him to stand up for me or anyone else against other countries or politicians if he can’t even stand up to politicians in his own party. But that was just the catalyst that made me watch some trump rallies just to hear him out. That when I realized the media was doing nothing but lying and smearing him 24/7 kinda like what they did with Bernie by just not talking about him. Back then I would just take headlines on reddit or the news as truth when it wasn’t. I was less informed about politics back then but considered myself pretty left. Eventually Trump won me over because I realized I didn’t really disagree with him as much as I thought. I still disagree with him on stuff and he is without a doubt an asshole but I tend to agree with him on more things. I still cringe at how much I argued with friends, family, and strangers on Facebook when I was left. It was like a toxic game that I heavily regret. Just calling people racist, sexist, or whatever buzzword was trending at the time and arguing for things I didn’t fully understand. I’m actually grateful for what the DNC did because it really opened me up to others. No one ever believes me on reddit though when I say I was originally a Bernie or Obama supporter and that’s fine because they are probably how I use to be, but that mostly goes to the people who will just say I’m lying, a bot, or some Russian shill because because the only people that really do that are the ones locked in the same echo chamber I use to be in. Of course not everyone on the left is like that but it seems to be more common and the right isn’t clean of that either and there are terrible extremes on both sides. Well that was my rant, you don’t have to believe but it’s the truth and I appreciate you asking me this question instead of just dismissing me."
