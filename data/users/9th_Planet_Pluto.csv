We're alternating lat pushdowns, I told him a few, and he tells me to hurry up and taps/backhand pats my stomach.

... tf, just because you're 40ish and we're skinny college kids doesn't give you the right to disrespect. 

He then proceeded to hog one of the squat racks with some kinda bench exercise, not even using it as he talked to some other gym goer about his military experience and how rude other people in the gym were. Talked for like 15 minutes, used the rack maybe twice.
