dryalcoholics,ffpc2w6,t1_ffp728l,1580091319.0,Honestly they ban people for posting while drunk like somehow that will make people drink so that is their mentality.
dryalcoholics,ffndzn3,t1_ffncw5u,1580064689.0,"In my town there is one huge meeting that has spawned all the other ones. The petty tyrants at the main giant meeting cause people to splinter off and form their own meetings, eventually the people that make those meetings end up going full control freak and the cycle continues. There is one guy on the edge of town in a run down church that gave up on the whole organization and he just runs a happy meeting for anyone and everyone. They all hate him but hell his is the only positive meeting, hes the kindest man I've met."
dryalcoholics,ffn8qr3,t1_ffn67g5,1580063136.0,Hell I agree with whatever mod it was that said tapering and recovery posts should be directed towards DA. I think it should be a high crime and misdemeanor to refer a CA to R\Stopdrinking tho.
dryalcoholics,ffn7m3s,t1_ffn6vz0,1580062852.0,I think what officially did it is when I said that even the mods at CA are more reasonable than the SD ones are.
dryalcoholics,ffn7ey2,t1_ffn6due,1580062782.0,A 3% beer is still sober as far as I'm concerned. Hell they probably would have told you to reset over a kombucha too lol.
dryalcoholics,ffn5m8l,t1_ffmdakm,1580062256.0,Ironically the one that seems to ban people the most over that is probably the one that banned me.
dryalcoholics,ffn43zv,t1_ffn2hdj,1580061858.0,Yup I dont know what mod that is but it sounds like they need to go.

dryalcoholics,ffm9m5f,t1_ffm97d1,1580050952.0,So the way I've seen it described here is that they have a super narrow concept of how things should be. There is good content there sometimes too tho although a good 65% of the posts are people bitching about their bottle of wine a day habit like its end stage alcoholism.

PS4,ffgbvsr,t1_ffg0dek,1579902819.0,a prequel to Death stranding could easily work as a horror game if you make it about the original death stranding that destroyed america. Refugees trying to escape cities and getting killed by timefall and Whole neighborhoods getting destroyed by people turning into BTs would be scary. Kojima would have to get over his fear of NPCs tho to do it.

pics,fffw7pc,t1_fffsf40,1579893151.0,Ya know I always thought it was more sporting to hunt predators with a bow or a spear but when that guy killed a bear with a spear people were outraged and bans happened. The odds are fairly high the bear is gonna take that spear and shove it up your ass tho so at least the animal has a fighting chance. On the other hand tho a big bullet is the most humane death a wild animal is going to get. Hell even as a person I'd prefer a bullet to a lot of other options.

If anything your still probably quitting earlier than average. A lot of those people turn it around, you probably can too. The key is to not drink tho. I know what gets me usually is panicking about my life being ruined and wanting to drink to get away from it which just perpetuates the problem."

JoeRogan,fffamur,t1_fff46ml,1579879752.0,The more fucked up opinion I'm seeing these days is that Joe himself is not alt right but since he has people on his show that some people think are Alt-Right he is enabling hate speech and should be deplatformed. Reddit literally doesn't believe in free speech.
