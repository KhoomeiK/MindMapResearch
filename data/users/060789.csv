The penguins front office signed a bad contract on the arena deal and it was bleeding the team dry.

That's the story of how the penguins almost got relocated. Pittsburgh got a team and set up a business just in time for the actual city the pens are located in to start hemorrhaging people due to manufacturing jobs moving overseas.

Or you can just read a comment from some drunk dude from Camden on reddit explaining his theory about how only like 4 people showed up to the games for two decades and take it as fact, then add some proper punctuation to that incoherent rant and regurgitate it while sniffing your own farts without letting things like ""real world economics"" get in the way of your idea that pittsburgh is some kind of strange anomaly where the people here are somehow genetically incapable of watching hockey unless the number on the left side of the screen is higher than the number on the right, even though these same people have been watching the pirates for the last 50 years"

todayilearned,fdesxjq,t1_fde6lic,1578345938.0,"I'd like to see a source on that claim. Globally, deforestation is happening, but I don't believe Israel is the only country that has increased the number of trees in the last 100 years.

Every Source I've found says America has more trees today than it had in 1920, with some of the more heavily deforested areas consistently doubling the amount of forested areas decade over decade. 

100 years ago is a nice, round number, but also *extremely* cherrypicked, as around 1920 give or take a decade or so was at the ass end of some of the worst deforestation industrialized nations have seen. Move that date up to about 1950 to present and all of a sudden a bunch of countries start looking like they give a fuck. 

Worldwide we are still cutting forests at a rate of 3 chopped down to 1 tree reaching maturity, but it seems to be the same problem as every other environmentally disastrous trend in this day and age- the biggest problem countries, per capita, are developing nations, and telling them to stop what they're doing is basically telling them they're not allowed to catch up to the richest countries with more advanced and diverse economies.

The problem isn't everyone, and the solution isn't simple. I cant speak for other countries, but America is reforesting rapidly (not tree farming- reforesting), and forcing the biggest offenders to stop means neutering their economy in a big way."

therewasanattempt,fcs77al,t1_fcs0z8p,1577912402.0,"That's not true at all, America is a massive country with regional cultures that exist for all different types of folks. 

Love it or hate it, country culture is pretty monoracial. Lifted trucks, hunting, mudding, bonfires, riding dirt bikes in dry lake beds, that kinda shit. There are people of other races who also participate in that culture, but it's predominately a white folk thing. 

That's one example. My wife is a big hippie, she loves getting stoned and going to see government mule then coming home to make jewelry out of crystals and shit. She has a ton of black friends who she hangs out with, but none are interested in hanging out in the living room and listening to widespread panic while putting together a jigsaw puzzle. 

I'm an avid outdoorsman, I like learning about orienteering and bushcraft and shit, my idea of a perfect vacation is taking my daughter out to the woods 50 miles from the nearest town for a week. Again, I've got some friends of different ethnicities, but whenever I go to a class on how to tie knots or whatever, you'll have the occasional Asian in there but not much else. 

There are subcultures outside of the general American culture. Your average country dude from some small Appalachian town can probably relate more with a black dude from the same region than he can with a white dude from Seattle."

todayilearned,fceg7k9,t1_fcd7n0g,1577620157.0,"I used to work with a guy from Guatemala who didn't speak much English. We were a 2 man landscaping crew. His english was about as good as my Spanish, which is like a tier below conversational, so we struggled to communicate for the first month but eventually kinda learned this third-English third-Spanish third-made up sign language based on what words and topics the other person knew in their respective second language. 

I knew enough Spanish to know something was off with his, I chalked it up to guatemalan Spanish just being a different dialect, but he eventually told me that he didn't learn how to speak spanish until he moved to the United States, which was shocking to me. He invited me to dinner one time with his family, and after talking to his wife (who was also guatemalan), I had a much easier time communicating with her, even though she spoke even less english, and I realized his Spanish just wasn't that great lol. 

Side note, this dude was an ugly mf, probably 5'4 and chubby, but his wife could have been a fucking model. I was floored when I saw her. Good cook too. Good for him, he was a salt of the earth guy."
