And I thought being over buying lip shades that I would never wear (like I actually am these days) was the answer to my problem, but apparently it just means I buy the exact same MLBB shade in every single brand now.

Me: reads comments every day, all over the internet, full of misspellings, typos, weird grammar, dialects I don't speak, slang I don't hear often etc. 99% of it makes complete sense. Rarely do I not understand what someone meant.

Also me: spends 20 minutes on a two sentence post getting the *exact* right phrasing and formatting, to make sure everyone can *really* understand what I'm saying. I'll need to read this in my head ten times with fresh eyes to catch how an internet stranger might read it.

*Also Also* me, seeing an extremely minor typo I made: Wow that makes absolutely no sense. What a wasted comment. No one could possibly interpret this gibberish.

muacirclejerk,ff4e3a4,t1_ff32gdv,1579561426.0,"People have covered the part about how it's typically a term reserved for objects, but I think part of the picture is being left out on why that's so. It's not just ""PC"" or whatever people like to complain about. It's literally just using the term incorrectly (in a way that *also* happens to create a caricature and thus be insulting to some people)

The term is typically reserved for objects because ""oriental"" isn't a culture/ethnicity/nationality/identitiy someone can have. It's an *aesthetic*. Colloquially, it's a reference to multiple different asian cultures' art and aesthetics that westerners were fascinated with and mishmashed together starting pre-colonialism silk and spice routes, and ending all the way in the 19th century.

It's like if you called every white person you saw ""Victorian"". Uh... sure that can be a Victorian style *chair* or whatever, but I'm 1) not british, or any sort of subject of queen victoria 2) even if I were british, I'm probably engaging in a completely different 21st century aesthetic, it's not ""Victorian"" just because it's on a person of vaguely European decent. Oh and also ""Victorian"" has turned into a term that means anything to do with ""european"" culture starting with the Renaissance in italy and ending with Jackson Pollock.

So even if you find the term useful (which, why???), only things like architecture can be ""oriental"", art can be ""oriental"" (although I'd still argue that are probably more concise terms for those specific objects within those fields that actually acknowledge a specific country of origin or other actual historical movements). You could even describe a person as *wearing* ""o*riental""* aesthetic clothing or makeup. But a random person of vaguely asian descent is no more *inherently* ""Oriental"" (because again, it's an aesthetic and not a place or culture) than a random white person is inherently ""Victorian"" or ""Rock-a-Billy"".

You see how when applied to breathing, living people (as opposed to objects or whatever that actually *can* fulfill that specific aesthetic) the label becomes an assigned caricature. It's *assigning* someone as an aesthetic no matter what they do, based on some vague understanding of genetic background.

If I'm a white person and you call me, with an ""insta glam"" look, and my other white friend, with a ""goth"" look, both ""little house on the prairie"" ---- not only like that's an actual ethnicity or nationality (and not just a pop culture reference to specific era in american history), but ALSO like that's the only vibe we could *possibly* *have* ***because*** we're of european descent--- that would be annoying, weird, and just plain inaccurate if nothing else."

muacjdiscussion,ff2evn4,t3_er6j9t,1579503238.0,"My mom *wore* makeup, but she wasn't *into* makeup. She was raised to believe that it's how you make yourself presentable for going out in public (old school Southern family), so she wore it, but her excitement for it was about about as much as most people get from putting on their deodorant.

Her look was *incredibly* stable, she probably changed out one product for another in her routine \~every 5 years.

She was really sweet when it came to me though. I loved the stuff from a really early age (like 5th or 6th grade) and she never had a thing to say about. A lot of my friends' mom either outlawed it, allowed but made fun of them and discouraged it, or were controlling about *which* products and application (yes lipstick, no eyeliner, only neutral colors etc.). My mom really let me *play* with it. I'm sure there were times she could have stopped me from looking silly but she really let me do my thing.

We've talked about it recently and she said she was just glad that I actually *liked* it (as opposed to it being a chore like she was raised for it to be) and that she was jealous of how much more normal it is to be experimental with makeup (and how many cooler products there were) than when she was growing up. She said that if she would have been able to be as creative with it like that when she was learning, she'd probably wouldn't feel like it was akin to brushing her teeth routine-wise.

She's branched out a bit too! I introduced her to a creme and liquid blushes (she thought her mature skin was too dry to ever wear some blush again) and she really took to it! Asked if she could keep the one I brought over!

I think a lot of us forget just how different the general culture was when our mother's were learning makeup. We're living in a golden age right now-- with all the interesting products (available all the way down to the drugstore level), online tutorials, and waaaaaay higher diversity in application styles accepted in day to day life."
muacjdiscussion,ff2chnu,t1_ff1zujh,1579500672.0,"Wow this is so sweet. My earliest makeup memories are with my nana too. She let me put curlers in her hair and apply makeup on her almost every time I came over. 

Looking back I can see how kind of her it was to let me mess up her hair and waste her products. She was also an Estee Lauder, Laura Mercier, etc. type of lady. She *never* told me any of it was off limits. I even remember her even letting me spritz spritz spritz her beautiful bottles of perfume everywhere. I'm sure some of it was expired/samples but it couldn't all have been. 

I think playing with someone's clothes or makeup, and getting ready with them, etc. can be really intimate. I think it makes for really powerful memories and connections. In a lot of my close friendships to this day, if I were to look back for a turning point where they usually went from ""casual friends"" or acquaintances to good pals or BFFs--- a lot of them would be getting ready together for something for the first time.

 It's such a distinct form of camaraderie."
cringe,fewjrt1,t1_fewbbiy,1579412074.0,"Yeah in my experience working with middle schoolers, it's *usually* that they *are* probably less out going and ""obnoxious"" (minus the odd who just really is that... out there, and naruto runs through the halls or meows no matter the occasion), and have all the same insecurities and over self awareness as the average kid day-to-day, if not more so

BUT, once they get in a designated place for ""people like them"" (like an anime convention) they feel comfortable enough to be themselves, and the damn breaks from all the repression and they just... really let loose.

A lot of these kids struggle with social cues, and as a result just play it safe in 99% of situations and stay quiet. So, hallelujah (screw ""invisible"" social cues) they just found a place that says *right on the door* that silly and dorky behavior is what's going on there. They're making the absolute most of it and acting the uninhibited way more ""socially dominate"" people do everywhere else--- just minus a lot of practice or natural skill.

I'm pretty confident that a good majority of the video is heavily influenced by where it was shot at. They're at an *anime convention*, this is a ""normie"" kid's huge Saturday night party.

The EXACT same thing happened to me. I've been upset with people before (obviously, haven't we all?) but I've never experienced *needing* to punch someone in the face, *to the point my shoulders were shaking*, until about a week into taking an Ashwagandha supplement. 

I'm a woman and it honestly made me more empathetic to what I imagine having a ton of testosterone or being roided up feels like. *Everything* was a pointed insult at me and the urge to *physically* fight was.. intense. It was insane, I was also sobbing for about 24 hours straight at one point. 

Never felt anything like it before, and haven't since after I stopped the supplement.

AmItheAsshole,fehz1gs,t1_feh1zdv,1579126749.0,">The idea that we can’t let kids be bored as hell anymore is something that really bothers me.

This BAFFLED me about this post. I'm only 24. I'm not some ""back in my day"" kind of person (in fact I hate that person). My childhood was the early and mid aughts. Hardly a bygone era. But I swear *no one,* not even babysitters or teachers, certainly not parents, cared when me and my friends were ""bored"" as children. And my mom had her Masters in childhood special education, so (knowing a lot more about child psychology than the average person) she could be *weird* about things that other families were fine with. But taking us on long errands?Where we'd have to behave and entertain ourselves? *Never* gave it a second thought or acted like it was bad parenting. The amount of hair appointments, doctor's appointments, CHURCH, long boring adult convos started at the grocery store, TV SHOWS, etc. that I sat through as a child, bored and miserable out of my mind is endless.

And it's SO much easier today to not even get ""tantrum-throwing"" bored in the first place. Bring a charged up iPad. Or go old school and bring a book (this was my go-to), bring some homework. I swear I learned most of my time management skills by asking my mom her school for after school that week and making sure I brought homework to do if there was an appointment or other engagement.

This girl is 9. She's in at least 3rd grade. She goes to school every day. She *knows* how to sit quietly while adults are working. She survives doing it every day. They're severely underestimating this girl and halting the natural patience and time management skills that she's building at school everyday.

Also with a second child on the way, they're gonna learn (whether they like it or not) that having multiple children means that some of them have to sit and wait while you go do things for another one. Some of the most boring memories from my childhood was sitting and watching my little sister's kindergarten team (badly) play basketball. There's just no way you can get a babysitter for each and every little thing that doesn't *directly* involve your child. They're gonna come along for the ride on some stuff."

Side note, I think bangs that split in the middle are super if they have cut on the insides that makes it look intentional (think Brigitte Bardot), maybe go back to whoever cut your bangs and tell home they always split in the middle, ask if they can do a bang shape that works with that.

I'm sure some guys can turn the tears on and off (a good friend of mine has an ex that was this manipulative and just straight up nuts), but in my experience the guys who pull this are just losers who have gone to *outlandish* lengths to avoid consequences, as a habit, usually since they were a child.

They're *genuinely* overwhelmed that 1) You confronted them. Oh, they've been caught screwing up before, but for one reason or another, no one in their past (not even parents) were the type to confront them about it. The fact that you're pushing it and you're pushing it *right now* is terrifying to them. They're used to relying on others wanting to avoid confrontations. 2) That you can leave (impose a consequence), and they have absolutely zero control over it. Manipulative people are used to having more influence over situations than average. They're used to talking people out of things, because most people want to be talked out of being upset. The fact that you're not interested in feeling better, only in the truth, so you can decide whether to leave or stay, makes them feel as helpless as regular people.

CPTSD,fe053jp,t3_enggmt,1578803286.0,"I'm kind of like this and it's because I don't naturally think about my emotions as ""emotions"", but as ""situations"". 

Like if you asked me what was wrong one day I'd say ""X and Y is happening at my job, and that screws over because of Z."" And more emotionally connected people (like my therapist) will use context clues and respond something like ""so you're feeling... overwhelmed?"" And it'll take be a second but I'll think ""well, yeah, I guess I am."" And then I'll get advice on how to cope with being overwhelmed. Which makes sense as far as coping and advice go. Neither I nor my therapist can change the important parts of this situation. 

But if they would have never brought it up to me I would have continued ruminating on how to eliminate something I have no control over (the situation), instead of brainstorming on how to reduce my *stress response* which I have a lot more control over. It's like it doesn't occur to me to actually get on with it and ""cope"", just to stay in denial and attempt to eliminate *whatever is forcing me to cope.* 

I think I was under the impression that making what bad thing that was going to happen, not happen, was coping. It's not really. It's getting lucky. It's *handling* a situation, at most. *Coping* is when there's nothing you can do to *handle* it, and surviving the negative emotions that come along with that. 

I think I also thought that endlessly ruminating over past situations, trying to land on some positive understanding of them was coping. That's not it either. That's denial or ""reframing"" at best, and it only works in limited doses for me. Coping would be being able to be happy again *despite* that 100% negative, no silver lining, awful thing that happened to me.

seduction,fdz03d0,t1_fdww8kf,1578785374.0,"Honestly I think this is all wrong. The girls I know that are high status absolutely want the guys they're with to act appropriately and at least slightly care about what people think socially. They will not date the weirdo in an anime shirt just because he's jacked and ""confident"" about it. They'll date the scrawny frat guy who fits in easily with their friends and family and others any day before that.

It's more that girls like guys who don't give a fuck *about bad things happening* because they're strong and capable and have a decent life\*.\* Doesn't give a fuck if his car breaks down. Doesn't give a fuck if plans get canceled. Basically just doesn't give a fuck about the small curveballs life throws. It's masculine, it feels safe. It's emotional stability. It shows that you're a capable adult with a decent life overall, you don't *need* to sweat the small stuff. You're level headed and mature because you have other things going for you.

I think guys see that they get better results when they ""don't give a fuck"" and get this weird idea that women like to be not valued or have their opinion devalued? That doesn't make any sense. Have you ever like someone more because they openly didn't care about your thoughts? No, it's insulting and annoying.

You're getting better results because you're not being needy and you're acting the way someone with a full life and level head does. You're acting like you're capable of handling whatever life throws. That's *way* different than acting like other people's opinions means nothing to you and that you're too cool to care, and it leads to different conclusions about what *other* behaviors the women you interact with will respond well to.

The guy who thinks that the good response he gets from women when he's not needy (""doesn't give a fuck"") is because they like when people don't care about opinions, will go on to do things like OP where he stares at asses ""just because he knows other people think he shouldn't"" and argue with her parents.

The guy who thinks the good response he gets from not being needy is because it shows how great his life must be otherwise and how level headed and capable he is does things like talk about problems he's solved recently, cool ways he spends his free time, skills he learns, and all his other friends.

Women are so, so used to male attraction meaning practically nothing. It's just not flattering to them. We tell them all the time to not get a big head because most guys would fuck anything. And a lot of them have seen that for themselves and/or believed us. The flip side of that narrative and just overall male thirsty-ness, is that until you prove otherwise, women are not excited about every single dude that talks to them. You're just lonely and they're good enough to fix that.

It's not special or flattering and those are things that make the beginning of dating exciting. To counteract that you have to show (either through facts or just by an attitude of not being needy) that you actually have a great life and a lot of things going for you, you're not a lonely dude that would literally take anyone who would have him. Because that's actually *flattering* and *exciting* and actually feels like a real connection, like you really ""chose"" her, and aren't just always just looking to ""date"" regardless of you life circumstances.

Otherwise they're just not going to be excited about dating you and you'll get less stellar results. But I *promise* that any good results you get from ""not giving a fuck"" have to do with seeming like you're mature and have a life, it has absolutely *nothing* to do with being a guy who's ""too cool"" for social graces. In fact, the majority of women are way more socially tuned than the average guy and I think following this OP comment's example is recipe for *less* success. If this guy is getting the women he wants it's in spite of his weird forced ""I'm so alpha I'm going to stare at asses in public"" persona, not because of it."

It could very well have been done by someone in the family, with that non familial DNA on her just from how badly the scene was handled. The case was botched from the get-go."

All Buxom really does is smoke weed, but that makes her the bad seed in that kind of family and Bare Minerals low key acts traumatized when she talks about her. She swears she'll never touch the stuff because of ""what it did to her sister"" (lol)

She gets kind of stuck up after she gets engaged sophomore year (of college), and has a really specific pet cause like ""not saying the R word anymore"" (you agree, but it's just weird how often she brings it up and how militant she is about it)

All her social media posts are ""Life Updates"" on FB, and never less than 500 words at a time. Very emotional Bible verse + intimate picture is always the crown jewel of the whole thing. Gets 80+ likes and comments all from people your parents age and friends from her ""hip"" church"

"" I never wanted anything and / I never got it"" x2, and then later x4.

CPTSD,fdofywm,t1_fdoayf1,1578604365.0,"It sounds similar to the ""golden child and scape goat"" dynamic in some abusive families. If the parent doesn't instate it themselves (how it usually goes), sometimes a child will, as a defense mechanism (less common but definitely not unheard of).

The idea is, just like you said, that by backing up the abuser when they're attacking someone else (instead of just staying out of it or defending the other person), they build a rapport with the abuser and lessen their own abuse, thus dubbing themselves ""the golden child"" and creating that dynamic.

From the outside it just seems like kissing up, but it's actually a pretty natural reaction to the unnatural state of a child having no rapport with their parent or parent(s). Sadly though, it usually ends with that person becoming abusive themselves (outside of childhood, where it was a coping mechanism) and there's a bit of grey area where you wonder ""was it ever a defense mechanism or do they just take after their abusive parent more than the other children?""

While most of the things written about the ""golden child-scapegoat"" dynamic start from the assumption that the parent chose the children's roles, reading about it would probably still have a lot relevant information to your experience. That plus what's written about ""identifying with abusers"" would really cover your bases as far what you've experienced. Because it sounds like a mixture of the two phenomena."

Meditation,fdkvf8l,t1_fdkgxza,1578511966.0,"Yes, to the point where I usually cried as soon as I started.

Let it happen and just observe. Sit with whatever is going on. Focus on the physical sensation of it, don't search for or entertain any abstract thoughts that go along with it.

Example: I start to cry and have a panic attack as soon as I lay down to begin my session.

Do: -Notice the sensation of wetness on your cheeks

\-Experience the sensation of you breath hitching

\-Become aware of the tightness of specific muscles in your neck or back

Don't: -Attach abstract labels to what is going on (""I'm crying""; ""I'm having a panic attack"")

\-Attach an abstract ""why"" to what is going on (""God my job is what makes me this miserable, I can't live like this"";""I hated that offhanded comment my friend made today. I can't let it go."")

\-Assign any short term or long term behavior (""OK breathe, no more crying""; ""Calm down, read the nice text your friend *also* sent you when you're done. She meant well"")

If any of these abstract thoughts do arise (they will), just let them go and you're back to physical sensation. Don't entertain them, or have meta-abstract thoughts about them. 

Unpleasant feelings, like all strong feelings, are simply physical sensations. You can reason through them (label them, explain them, set goals based on them) *at* *any other time,* meditation is not for that. Meditation is *for physically feeling them*. *No abstract thought*, just sensation. You say your mind races. What does that **physically** *feel like?* Are you eyes darting behind your eyelids? Is your jaw muscle engaged? Are you wincing?

You might wonder ""what I can't reason through my emotions? That's why I started meditating in the first place! I want to feel better."" You can't begin to do that until you *physically* feel the range of your emotions in your body. Emotions are terrifying until you realize that (by stripping away all the cluttered labels, explanations, etc.) all they are *by themselves* is just tense neck muscles, wincing, wetness on cheeks, choking breaths, vomiting.

*You'll never live as you should or come to a conclusion on what you should do, until you reduce emotions down to their physical sensations.* Until then, they usually loom far too large or far too small in our minds.

Saying ""I'm struggling to do that because I'll be scared"" is so different from saying ""I can't do that because my hands will shake a little and my voice might crack once at first"". When you understand that's what emotions are, you see how little is *actually* holding you back.

Why is it so hard to do something that will make our hands shake and our voice quiver a little? Because those things used to mean much larger amounts of danger than they do now. Evolution endowed us with emotions to either inhibit or encourage certain physical actions. It really was life or death.

Sitting with these pleasant and unpleasant physical sensations (emotions) lets us acclimate to them and only give them the amount of physical response in our life plan that they deserve. ""Oh that's the feeling of embarrassment again. But this isn't life or death, and I've meditated while embarrassed before and I survived the flushed cheeks and wincing just fine."" -Does embarrassing thing One needs to do, feels embarrassed and, again, survives it-.

Or on the other hand ""I need to get out of bed but god this feels so good"". Meditation gives you the experience of knowing this intense feeling of rest, and that it's not that impressive. And that the cold out of getting out from on the covers isn't that bad. You should get out of bed and go to work on time. It lets you correctly value pleasant sensations too and resist temptation.

It's not about changing or getting rid of certain emotions, it's about becoming so aware of them that you can plan or act *around them.* Think about it, if you can accept and work with the fact that you might feel absolutely awful for a period of time, what can't you do? We can't do things because we're not *willing* to feeling certain awful physical sensations (emotions).

Meditation and mindfulness are the most successful way humans have found to get to that point. The point where you know all the physical sensations of living your body so well that you rarely ever take action (or fail to take action) in ways that will have repercussions *worse* than just an upset stomach or wet cheeks.

GenderCritical,fdfsh7n,t1_fdfbl7q,1578369090.0,"CW: this is rough, sorry. Sexual assault.

As someone who has also been through what *you* (whoever you are) deem serious enough to be called ""assault"" and worse, this type of quibbling is insane and honestly makes me doubt your entire backstory. Either you're lying or you're incredibly dense. Sexual assault is a very broad category of actions legally, let alone how you might use the phrase colloquially. It encompasses an entire group of crimes that are all based on sexual contact lacking consent. If you're taking the word ""contact"" so literally as to only include *physical* contact, then you must not be very well acquainted with the well documented harm other forms of sex abuse (like psychological or ""exhibitionist"" actions) can do to people.

I think anyone who has actually been through these things would agree that the mentally damaging part is the crossing of boundaries, lack of feeling of control, the violation, etc. These all apply to people who have been sexually accosted, physically or otherwise, without their consent. The step father who seems to always ""accidentally"" be masterbating when his little 11 year old step daughter walks in, getting off on her horror and non consent, is sexually abusing her. The guy who flashes his junk at the park because he loves the feeling of disrespecting peoples boundaries, and *forcing* them to be part of his sexual experience, is a sex offender.

It doesn't matter if the contact is physical or mental, *the boundary crossing and lack of consent* is the crime. To imply that the harm that's done during a r\*pe doesn't apply to someone that is continually violated visually or psychologically is asinine. It clearly does. I've experienced r\*pe and I've experience ""exhibitionists"" (as you so cutely called them) and it's the same disgusting feeling of violation that is the harm in *all* sex crimes. To quibble about whether or not someone whose ""only"" experienced psychological sexual abuse can say they were ""assaulted"" or not is so far from common sense and human decency that I wonder what your point even was. Even if you were ""legally"" correct (you weren't) about the use of the word (and I doubt this was what you were getting at because you somehow managed to be gatekeeper-y and stuck up *about sexual assault-* so in some twisted way I think this was your ego and trying to sound ""intellectual"" somehow), that's so far from being relevant to the topic that it's genuinely idiotic. You say yourself *it's still* (""some other type"") *of sex crime*, well, then why even go there? The post is about not wanting to experience a sex crime protected by ""self ID"" dogma. If you yourself admit it's still not okay, then your whole comment was pointless gatekeeping, that was probably activity harmful to people who have gone through such things and were hurt by them.

And before you say ""I was assaulted so I'm not comfortable with other people using the term"", guess what, that's ridiculous (you don't own a word after it's happened to you, I don't get to tell people how to use the word r\*pe, sorry). And the implication is that you don't want them using it because you don't respect what they went through as similar enough to what you did. Not only does psychology disagree, but that's disturbing lack of solidarity with people who would be the most empathetic towards you, and you them. You're losing the forest for the trees if you think *anything* productive comes out of being a gatekeeper (again, I'm going to gag, *of sexual assault).* When you're in activist spaces, idk, maybe try and think through your own thoughts critically and make what you say, i don't know, relevant and logically coherent?"

AskWomen,fdc4c7n,t1_fdbduie,1578266856.0,"I think the media has a lot to do with the phenomena, honestly. Every time a thread like this pops up ""not like other girls"" types chime in that they *can't* make female friends because the women they see ""wear makeup"" or ""do their hair"" or something equally surface level.

Maybe in movies that's supposed to say a lot about someone, but in real life the fact that a girl I know does or doesn't wear makeup tells me practically *nothing* about whether or not I'd get along with them. *Of course* if you buy into every teen movie you've ever seen you think you're ""not like other girls"", those girls are portrayed horribly and exceptionally one dimensionally. Practically no one in real life, not even the Kardashians or Paris Hilton types, are that devoid of depth.

It's funny because usually they're coming at it from the angle of ""I'm not superficial and they are"", but *they're* the ones deciding who they will or won't be friends with based on their style. That's *wayyyyyyyyy* more superficial than slipping on some lipstick or curling your hair.And of course there's no real male equivalent for their guy friends. ""Oh he shaves his stubble daily, he's way too high maintenance we could never be friends""

Smart, capable, cool women style themselves in every single way imaginable. Michelle Obama is gorgeous, always wearing something stylish, does her makeup, etc. *And* has two ivy league degrees, among a laundry list of other accomplishments. Imagine avoiding her as a friend because she's ""too feminine"" or ""basic"" at first glance.

I also hate the idea that comes along with all this, that you can only be successful friends with people who are *exactly like you.* That's so goddamn boring and not true. I'm 24 and have two friends in their 70s. I'm not very athletic and I have friends that might as well be olympic athletes. I have friends that are waaaaay less nerdy than me.

Here's the real kicker: we didn't know about them (despite the existence of that same relative who's very into our family history, and having an X Last Name Association that meets in Germany every few years) because the guy never came back from Brazil, and never spoke to his (our) family again because they disowned him for marrying and having a child with an afro-Brazilian woman. He was basically written out of our family history by his parents, we only knew about his siblings.

They tend to stick to personal attacks and jokes about the appearance of whoever gets posted as opposed to just showing the differences and exposing techniques, and I don't get how making fun of people's appearances, even if they are ""fake"", is in any way *less* superficial.

It's still a huge amount of pressure and either hate or praise for how one looks and I honestly feel *more* insecure every time I read one of those threads. Those people are absolutely savage down to the tiniest details, and they absolutely do not stick to the ""faked"" features either. It's an all out roast top to bottom of whoever is posted (and with barely *any* verification that the person in the picture did that to the photo themselves. If I wanted to send an insulting lynch mob after someone I didn't like, one of the easiest ways would be to take one of their instagram photos, badly edit their body, and then let /r/instagramreality absolutely tear them to shreds). 

They also use body dysmorphic disorder as a punchline and accusation *constantly,* as opposed to discussing it like the mental health issue that it is. If the things they posted about BDD were posted about depression or anxiety or OCD, etc., I think a lot of the same people who are active in that sub would suddenly have a HUGE issue.

There are *so many* resources online that get into these topics and educate young people on the techniques available to celebs and others, that *don't* turn include lynch mobs and joke threads about people's looks, that I really think OP or anyone else with a specific young person in mind would be better off recommending. Countless websites and documentaries (available on youtube!) do the *same thing* in a way more responsible, fact-checked way.

It makes you look like a chill person who can laugh at themselves, which imo makes the other person look pretty pathetic if they keep on dogging you.

As we get closer, I start to see that it's super awkward. Her gait is almost cerelpalsy-esque? and, as you might imagine, running backward on a curved track is kind of bad idea. So her head is a turned kind of far to the side so she can jog backward and stay on the trail and not hit the fence.

It got weirder though. She's not in running clothes AT ALL. She's in jeans, ballet flats, and a short sleeve polo shirt. Her hair is down and basically all in her face. It's giving the heebie jeebies and I don't really know why. Like sure that's not normal running attire, but it's just clothes.

We're getting closer and closer to where we're going to be shoulder to shoulder for a second going separate ways. And if I were a dog the hackles at the back of my neck *would have been huge.* My mental state (""this is weird but not a big deal"") has never been so divorced from my physical state (shaky panic attack breaths, hair on the back on my neck up, adrenaline making my veins feel weird, etc.) IN MY LIFE. Before this I didn't really understand the whole ""my body was mutinying against my brain"" thing that people say. *Everything* except my brain was telling me to turn around rather than cross ways next to this girl, but that would have meant running almost the *entire* track again to get to my car, and fuck that (lol).

Anyway it's too late. I'm like 10 steps away from being shoulder to should with this girl. And keep in mind, she still on has her back to me. I was planning on doing that awkward grin you do when you pass someone on a smallish part of the track. But it comes and we're right next to each other and I CAN'T look at her. And I don't.

It's been like 20 steps and it hits me that if she's still running backward that now *she's staring at the back of my head.* And I don't fucking like it at all. I get these instant intrusive thoughts, of her finishing winding up backward and just ***flinging*** forward at the back of my head. And immediately I stop ""running"" like runner-running and start fucking sprinting to my car.

I get in and lock it but for some reason I just can't bring myself to start it, I just keep scanning around for her, feeling frozen. Finally whatever adrenaline issue I was having wore off and I made the short drive to my house. Barely remember it, I couldn't stop thinking about the freaky girl.

Absolutely nothing happening and it's still the most freaked out and spooked I have ever been in my life. That's what I get for trying to exercise my frustration away instead of drinking like a normal person."
AskReddit,fctgqg8,t1_fcspk2u,1577942734.0,"I do *tons* of deep stretching, all over my body and it feels better than most anything to me. Sometimes I think maybe I'm the weird one because I almost get a euphoria during/afterward.

Because whenever I bring up a good stretch routine as this relaxing thing I do before bed people get all nervous and think it's about how flexible you can be or it being a workout. It's not a workout if you're just in your bedroom doing it until it feels just right. It's a goddamn massage. I hit spots I didn't even know existed.

But I don't get anything out of a lot of the ""usual"" that feels good stuff. I don't like people playing with my hair. Hugs are meh. Hand holding is weird. ""Soft"" rubbing on my skin makes me furious. Q-tips in my ears do nothing and make me uncomfortable. ASMR stuff makes me want to vomit.

Stretching and deep massages, though, have that ideal pain/pleasure ratio. Sex can go either way depending on the partner/position lol."

No. It's not a ""please let me over"" or  ""thank you"" button. It's a ""there are tens of cars around me that I can only hope to account for, so as the person making the movement, I'm letting everyone know so that I'm predictable and easy to avoid"" button.

There are cars exiting business parking lots, watching traffic until they can pull out. Your signal lets them not whip in that lane the exact second you're whipping into that lane. There are cars that would change lanes to avoid getting stuck behind you while you wait to turn into a business. Your signal lets them do that early and keeps the flow of traffic  behind you smoother. And there are just plain cars on the road you miss, but wouldn't *miss you,* if you'd use your blinker.

It's fucking idiotic. I don't care how ""clear"" you think it is, use your blinker. It's so damn easy. And everyone has so much to gain from it.

Side note, my friend got teased using for using his blinker before he turned into his own driveway the other day. Another person in the car piped up ""well for those of us who *actually use it*, it's pretty much just fucking muscle memory"". Which I think is a great point.

AskReddit,fcjn7my,t1_fcj74wp,1577694857.0,"I had a really similar experience once!

I had gone out with a few of my girlfriends and all night the plan was to go a little ""kick back"" at the home of a guy my friend was ""talking to"" (read: sleeping with) at the time. This was a good friend of mine and I actually hadn't gotten the chance to meet the guy yet, and she was pretty excited overall about it actually happening that night.

So we're at the last bar, and suddenly I just feel awful about going. It was such a specific feeling. I didn't want to go home, I just didn't want to go *there.* I even just tried to talk the girls into going to another bar with me instead. They considered it, but eh, they decided to stick to the plans we made (it was the polite thing to do, honestly. I had absolutely no good reason to be so keen on ditching the plans with this guy).

Anyway, I'm getting so nervous that I'm getting *stomach cramps* at the thought of going over there. We eventually walk out to the parking lot, and the *second* I see the DD's car, I stealth panic and order myself an uber. I just stopped walking and didn't even explain until my friends were like ""uh?? Are you not coming?"". It was so awkward but I said no, and that I just couldn't do it. No one wanted to join me so I went home. I think they thought that I made other ""better plans"" and was just ditching.

Not two hours later I get a call from my friend (the one who was dating the guy) SOBBING. The guy who she was dating's brother (apparently) lived with him. While they were there, he had some sort of psychotic break, grabbed a shotgun, and starting shooting at them. Just completely unprovoked and with zero attachment to reality.

No one was hit luckily, but they had to run for their lives, and when she called me they were a mile down the road (house was in the country) waiting with the police to be taken back to grab some belongings from the house and the car.

But they were all *completely* traumatized and I'm so glad I wasn't there. That's not something you just ""get over"", and I have no idea how I would have been able to cope.

I'm not superstitious at all, but I still have no idea what (explainable) thing made me feel that way. I was quite the party animal back then, definitely was never the one to go home first or to go home early. It's very weird (and lucky) that I didn't end up at that house that night.

So I just sit there like an idiot with a towel in my hand staring into space for 15 minutes.

GenderCritical,fcajt6t,t1_fc7wv94,1577570566.0,"Socialization in this context means the way society enforces certain ideas, roles, and behavior for different types of people. An example would be the difference in reaction a black woman and a white woman would get if they were upset in a place of business. Typically, white women would be more likely to be comforted and eventually catered to, while a black woman might be accused of ""causing a scene"". The black woman learns very young that she has to tread *very* carefully when upset upset to avoid being written off as ""an angry black woman"" and actually get helped. While a white woman would be more comfortable expressing her displeasure, and not understand why her black friend doesn't speak up for them self when, say, their order is wrong or they've been overcharged.

This comes up in trans issues because bio-women feel that they face woman specific socialization starting from birth. For example, the push towards dolls and dress up and away from puzzles and games of strategy. To make up for these early life sex-based differences in socialization, things like women specific scholarships have been instituted in certain fields. The issue arises a trans person identifying as a woman begins to apply for scholarships, grants, etc. earmarked ""for women"". Many bio women would say that since the person was identified male until adulthood, they didn't face the socialization since birth that the scholarship is trying to address.

In response, many trans people have put forth the idea that they ""self socialized""--- that they picked up the socialization aimed at women, not at themselves as their birth sex. Gender critical people (myself included) find this absurd for quite a few reasons. To begin, ""self"" socialization is an oxymoron. The whole *definition* is that it's learning you gain from *the reaction of others in society to you.* You can't do this to yourself, the whole point is that it's shoved in your own face *by others* over and over until you've ""swallowed the pill"" and behave in societally approved ways for whatever the world sees you as.

Sure, *you can* notice *some* *parts* of the socialization another group goes through, but that's not the same as living it. As evidenced over and over again by the disconnect between different groups when they try to explain what is going through their head when they do or don't do something publicly. Back to the original example, this would be the white woman not predicting that a fear of being labeled ""angry"" or ""ghetto"" is what is holding her friend back from correcting her order. She may understand once it was explained, and learn *a little bit* about what it's like to be black woman vs a white one, but socialization is so subtle and numerous that she still wouldn't be able to wake up the next morning and feel and behave as someone who received the reactions from society a black woman has *her entire life.* She wouldn't be eligible for a scholarship earmarked for black women to address the social issues facing them just because she was ""paying attention to black women"" and ""self socialized"" as one while growing up. That's not how it works.

You can ""notice"" and ""study"" another group's societal socialization your whole life, but you still won't be an expert and you still did not go through it or *be held back by  it* in any way, shape, or form. Which is all the ways socialization is relevant in the first place. It's not just some hoity toity field of anthropologic study--- it's real, lived experience that has consequences."

I'm just sure the ""woke"" reddit dudes, who are constantly harping on how victimized that bit of socialization makes them feel, would *absolutely love* for some TIF to come to answer one of the female posed questions and say that ""actually it's not a big deal"" (like TIMs do all the time with female issues) or ""it is, but I can, like, totally relate. Listen to me badly explain it instead of an actual dude"" (like your average TIM).

Or if a TIF asked them not to refer to their genitalia when referencing their experience as a man, because they personally don't have one--- again, like TIMs do.
