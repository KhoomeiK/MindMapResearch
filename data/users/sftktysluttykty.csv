ChoosingBeggars,fecxy8w,t1_fec9q7f,1578989167.0,"Transgender is real but “micro aggressions” are not. They’re just another made-up thing for overly sensitive people to throw out in discussion when they feel like they’re losing or people aren’t agreeing with them. Normal trans people understand they’re going to be misgendered by an ignorant public (and when I say “ignorant”, I simply mean ignorant to this person’s specific gender identity) during their day-to-day life. Normal POC don’t see racism in literally every single interaction they have with a stranger. 

See, shit like “micro aggressions” is why the term “snowflake” exists."

AskReddit,fecw2a7,t1_fecm4tf,1578986897.0,"My ex got a girl pregnant, by accident, that he didn’t even fucking *like*. Couldn’t stand the girl. Bitched to me practically 24/7 about her, was *emphatically* only fuck buddies with her. All of his friends and family members bitched to me about this awful girl. She totally fucking hated me for banging him first, and the fact he loved my daughter as his own, even after we broke up. 

Guess who was conveniently too Catholic for an abortion but not Catholic enough to forgo the premarital sex? Poor bloke is still stuck with her, and another kid on top of that mess. A friend of mine happens to live next door to them, says the screaming and banging from arguing is nearly daily. 

Honestly feel bad for the guy. Broke up with him for a reason, but that doesn’t mean I’d wish this kind of torture on him lol"
