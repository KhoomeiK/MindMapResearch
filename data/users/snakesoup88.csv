Depending on the game, purchasing a second copy maybe required for co-op. Our favorite single purchase one house two machine co-op game was burnout Paradise. Haven't found too many games that'll allow us to do that.  It doesn't seem like a popular feature. Considering PS4 hit the sweet spot as an excellent and cost effective Blu-ray player.

You can think of Jeff Bezos is working for them.

With planning and consistent savings, almost anybody can achieve FI/RE (financial independence and retire early). A million today is really not that big a hurdle. Sure, the system is not perfect. But it is also one of the easiest system to get ahead if one learn to navigate it.

Lastly, check out an old book called millionaire next door, when a million was a big deal. Guess what are the majority traits? They are most likely first generation immigrants who shops at jc penny. They are savers and workers. Not the evil slave masters that you are thinking of."

We had a city night photography meetup, we couldn't care less about their shitty little movie. So, we had our camera out, tax payers all, trying to get some night photos. Unfortunately, they try to disguise Boston to look like NYC and put up black tarps to block out landmarks that can identify its NOT NY.

After ruining our outing, their crew had the gall to rudely tell us to put the camera away like they own the city. We weren't even shooting in the direction of their set. What gives them the right to do that? I don't understand this film business where a city give tax incentives to bring a crew in to clog up a crowded city, disguising it so you don't get any publicity value.
