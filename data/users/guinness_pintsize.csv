I've requested to join the Facebook group, hoping the time can work in my favour, but if not there is always the option to have multiple people host different days and times due to the many timezones. I'd be interested in maybe assisting if I familiarise myself with roll and write."
todayilearned,femp01c,t1_femauci,1579265240.0,"I do agree with this statement as well, and I think there are use cases for still owning a vehicle, but society needs to accept that not everyone requires one as it is possible to get about without one."
todayilearned,fem93xi,t1_fem68co,1579244310.0,">However the voters just voted to reduce funding for Mass transit projects because they don't want to pay for it. 


This is the logic from people that really bothers me. What they fail to realise is that the increase in taxes to help pay for the public transit + the annual fee for using said transit would be significantly less than the cost of owning a car, vehicle cost + insurance + fuel + maintenance, yet they refuse to agree to this. If it went ahead each and every person would have more disposable income to use for other things in life they enjoy."
UKPersonalFinance,fejkvlg,t1_fejfnmv,1579178320.0,"Thanks for the reply. I may try a similar amount first to ensure it all goes through correctly, then the remainder. I know I'll be paying a slightly higher fee for these multiple transactions, but it won't be much of a difference."
ynab,fedgszy,t1_fedfory,1579011128.0,"Yeah I do really like the reports, and if you add the toolkit for Chrome or Firefox you can see extra information that can really help make some decisions going forward"
UKPersonalFinance,fed8fy3,t3_eojcu0,1579003582.0,"I'll be doing something similar in a few months time, and have done the research on TransferWise, but there is one question I have about using them. Would it be advisable to transfer a smaller denomination before I decide to transfer a significant amount to ensure it works correctly, and there is no suspicion about the value?

I don't want my first transaction to be stopped due to being too much money, and having to explain my situation. Not sure if they care about these things. Any advice would be appreciated."
ynab,fecz4y2,t3_eofpi2,1578990695.0,"Only been using since mid December, but have already noticed a few things that have benefited me. 

I set up my current budget and watched quite a few videos to understand YNAB as I didn't quite understand it, but once I watched the Nick Tue videos it all clicked for me. Once I had my budget in place I decided to create another one to do some experimenting with different categories and savings methods. While I had this one open I imported a full year of transactions from my spending account. After all this was done I was able to see where I was spending, when looking at the reports. This has helped me rein in where I was taking my savings money to fund this specific category as I always needed extra money just before the next paycheque. 

Due to seeing these expenses I have now been able to replenish my savings, and limit my cash withdrawals, which was my biggest expense outside of the monthly priorities (mortgage/groceries/other usual bills), and have now ordered the budget to be in priority order from top to bottom. 

I've been quite fortunate that I don't have credit card debt, but I could never figure out why I was always taking from the savings. 

Thank you YNAB for solving this problem."
ynab,fdxjfww,t3_enb92n,1578769263.0,"You can set up a monthly goal, ie spend up to $750 for the month, and if you don't spend all that, when you roll into the next month you will only need to budget the remaining value. Nick True(mapped out money) has a good video on goals that I just watched today, and he covers all the goal types."
ynab,fdv9qzm,t1_fduvpsr,1578745064.0,"You would need to import all the transactions, but I've not looked into the possibility of exporting all transactions that already exist in the budget. 

I'm interested in having a copy as well that will update when I add transactions or new categories, but not affect the original. With this copy I can then play about with different scenarios and see what works best for some future things I have planned. Again if these work better for me I would implement them in the original budget."

I could ride all year round, but it is weather dependent as I live in the UK. Flamme Rouge will have to be my winter riding this year."
