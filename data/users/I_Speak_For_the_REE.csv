AskReddit,femhgfw,t1_femglc0,1579255742.0,"I just read about this in class like 15 min ago. Problem is we need 20 million degrees Celcius to initiate the Fusion process. Normaly Fusion only occurs when Stars collapse. Then the unatural way, wich is what a Hydrogen bomb is. Using a nuclear bomb to generate the heat and energy needed to start the Fusion process in the hydrogen bomb. There is a Joint project called ITER in the South of france trying to solve The Fusion power plant problem. Their Idea is to suspend the particles that do the Fusion (Hydrogen and Nitrogen?)
In a magnetic field inside a donut shaped tunnel with heat resistance Light years ahead of that on the Space shuttle. That means that the fusion process never touches anything. So instead of the tunnel (more like a big pipe) walls only sustaining heat nowhere near what it needs to without melting from the fusion, the magnetic field puts distance between the walls and the fusion process, wich in essence multiplies the heat resistance every set distance, wich leads to the effevtive heat resistance being 150 million degrees Celcius. It is apparently gonna be ready to test now in 2020."
