There's a user here quoting talmudic laws that justify any number of awful positions against non-jews, I went to an Orthodox synagogue and literally never heard of those passages nor did and Rabbi push those principles. In fact quite the opposite, we're taught to be extremely charitable to everyone regardless of whether they were Jewish or not."

If you are paying attention to US pollution, somehow you aren’t paying attention to China? Get out of here. I don’t think anyone who cares about US pollution doesn’t think China isn’t worse, they have a billion people and notoriously don’t care about positive rules of any kind.

The US is a global leader and if we lower our emissions while increasing efficiency and profits, everyone will follow because it’s simply better. China is increasing their pollution but they are also becoming more aware of the expense of it, which could legitimately threaten the government. They also are trying to overtake the US in international influence so they have motivation to make some progress where the US is faltering similar to Russia and the US with arms during the Cold War."

JoeRogan,ff4shas,t1_ff4afh1,1579571366.0,"I agree, but it has also made it very hard to just up and leave. While the US is at fault for a lot of the state of the world, were in a different position now and have some obligation to help make things right. Leaving in a rush would mean competing rebel forces would tear apart these countries who are important to international stability. Libya has never recovered, and of course we helped the religious leadership rise to power in the middle East. 

But you won't hear Mike acknowledge our past mistakes as legitimate criticism, he'll just fall back on ""there's bad guys out there who want to do is harm"". Not untrue, but also not the whole story. Heck he barely acknowledges the awful stuff the CIA was involved in that's in the public record."
JoeRogan,ff4rkcu,t1_ff43jmv,1579570736.0,"Yeah, be comes across like a ""Team America"" character by overselling our ability to accomplish military tasks. That said, remember Iraq was toppled very quickly, I think in a matter of months so like most of his points there's a grain of truth but then I think every single war of the 20rh century had someone saying the war would be over in weeks or months but took years. Iran is *very different from Iraq with far more mountains, much bigger size, and a better trained/equipped military (though the shot down passenger jet says a lot about that). 

The truth is somewhere in the middle and that's my issue with him is he can be pretty unwilling to acknowledge things like that in lieu of machismo or pro America stances. It's probably part of his obligation as a former spook to not out our weaknesses to watching foreign eyes but it doesn't come across well on podcasts. PLUS the point is not our ability to topple a government, that's easy, it's re-stabalizing the region in a way that benefits both us and the country we invade. Which is always an afterthought for the DoD. Thus my point about the State Department!"

Justrolledintotheshop,ff0yui4,t1_ff0i96e,1579473629.0,"Someone can correct me but my understanding is this: it's a two piece disk with a spring mechanism that basically acts as a shock absorber between the engine side and the transmission side. So when the clutch engages the spring smooths out the load you're placing on the engine a bit.

So say you dump the clutch (move too quickly through the engagement point), a normal car will lurch forward before dying as the engine takes too much load too quickly. With the dual mass it'll buck back and forth as the spring ossilates but ultimately the engine usually recovers. So say you don't dump it but just aren't quite as smooth as you should be, that spring will smooth it out and make it feel relatively normal."

You'd think that would open him up to the idea that all Trump's bullshit doesn't counterbalance stock market success but the CIA is probably on autopilot right now and is swimming in cash so it's probably worth it for him and his IC network."
JoeRogan,fevkc4y,t1_fev9ot1,1579398403.0,"Jesus man, you need to lighten up. Being jaded is not a good look.

JoeRogan,feus5t8,t1_feu0q86,1579389397.0,"Agreed. He does what a lot of popular right wing speakers do, strawman the criticisms until they are unrecognizable and overplay the supportive arguments. SOLEIMANI BAD MAN, k but is he deploying legions of state department diplomats to rally US support in region needed to back up such a brazen killing or is he just rage tweeting again. 

Oh wait, we don't have a state department anymore."
JoeRogan,feupx7l,t1_feu2dxw,1579388891.0,"The big problem is that killing Soleimani was simply cutting off a Hydra head. Its one of those things that looks great as long as you only take one step into the issue. Did killing Saddam magically make Iraq better? Did killing Gaddafi stabilize Libya? Does killing Soleimani make the Quds force disappear or does it give them justification for further action fuelled by higher recruitment against the US? 

Killing the leader is the easy part, remember we took over Iraq in months (IIRC), but using diplomacy to stabilize the region afterwards is the part we don't do and often leads to even more conflict and far more US and civilian casualties than the original person was responsible for. Trump simply doesn't have the State Department power to justify actions like this since he barely has a State Department at all. There's a reason both Bush and Obama passed on killing Soleimani, and Bush would've had Ironclad support in doing so plus a powerful State Department to rally both allies and local players to back us."
JoeRogan,feulnrf,t1_fetwblo,1579387684.0,"The problem is, Trump's stated policies and what actually happens are almost completely unrelated. There's barely any progress on a border wall, healthcare hasn't gotten any better, our debt has skyrocketed, the swamp has gotten deeper and wider, America is even less respected around the world, has reduced our influence world-wide, he's gutting the state department, North Korea has been undeterred, his trade war has hurt working class farmers and materials manufacturers, (speaking of which) he hasn't done much for manufacturing jobs, hasn't brought coal back (why would you), hasn't helped the opiate crisis....

Basically, all the people who he spoke to during the election are either worse off today no better than they were pre-2016. I won't go so far as to say he hasn't done any good but it's basically been a bunch of monkey's paw wishes."
JoeRogan,feugtmc,t1_feu93z6,1579386439.0,"I don't disagree, he offers a lot of great counterpoints to my own beliefs but he can be pretty insufferable with obvious strawman arguments. Yes there are bad people in the world that make liberal utopianism impossible but that doesn't justify a lot of what American has done with our foreign policy. Baker will talk about how we've taken out all these bad guys, which is great, but he won't talk about just how bad we were at ""nation building"" which has led to the self perpetuating state of war we are in. 

I haven't listened to this podcast yet but I can almost guarantee he's going to go on about how liberals are proclaiming Soleimani was this great guy that shouldn't have been killed and then go on about all the American deaths he was responsible for. This is complete nonsense because liberals know he was a bad guy, we just also know that cutting of the Hydras head has been a stupid strategy since it was first written about by the Greeks (see: Iraq war, Afghanistan war, rise of ISIS).

He'll go on about how killing Soleimani was right because no real retaliation happens (due to dumb luck), he isn't going to talk about the abysmal state of the State department which is far more important to long term stability and cooling of international tensions than any military action we are taking right now, he'll downplay the abandonment of the Kurds, the random recall of troops in Syria, the broken relationships towards our allies, Trump sidling up to dictators, and he'll certainly laugh at liberals for wanting to improve the medical system and education while 165 billion more dollars has been thrown at the military budget.
 
Anyways, sorry about the rant but I will say the best argument he puts forward is that it's better for us to be stationed around the world than Russia or China because neither of them would care half as much as we do about collateral damage and political impact, and the left tends to ignore that fact and focus on the bad things we do, well it'd certainly be worse without us. So there's that."
JoeRogan,feu085d,t1_fetc5hv,1579381812.0,"But it's a very specific type of power and anything else required lockstep backing from your party who also must be in power. The president is very powerful in how he executes laws and how he handles foreign policy but matters of law creation and money handling are out of his hands completely. 

So if Bernie or Yang want to make drugs decriminalized or pull all troops out of the middle East, sure they can do that. But single payer healthcare and UBI are simply out of their hands without congressional support in both houses.

TL;DR the president has a lot of power but is powerless in most of the issues Democrats are pushing."

They're actually safer than skyscrapers because they don't shake back and forth like a whip, they simply shift with the ground. Furthermore, tunnels are designed to shift together if there's a big enough quake to even do that, which is generally not the case. So at worst they'd hinge a few degrees but each joint is meant to do that as would any rail system inside.

Also,Round structures distribute force evenly around the circumference, these aren't rickety mineshafts, so even if an earthquake did act like an impact force they'd still be fine."
JoeRogan,fenm98q,t1_fen8awp,1579287706.0,"Well, remember it's exaggerated, which is what makes it humorous, but there are absolutely people like that who take themselves too seriously.

Sure Hollywood Moguls dont dance like jackasses but it's funny to see that on camera.

I'd almost suggest googling ""Tropic Thunder characters make fun of"" to see lists of similar people in real life and you'll find that each character and situation aside from the Heroin-grower-kidnapping bit has some basis in reality. Even the ""let them kill the main character and we'll buy a G5 with the insurance payout and tax write off"" mentality is pretty in line with how studios deal with an on-set tragedy."

I have a hard time picking out 1 scene in Tropic Thunder that isn't laugh out loud funny. Maybe the scene when Ben's character is in captivity and RDJ is trying to convince him to leave but has an existential crisis, it made sense but I just didn't find it that funny. 

Maybe I'm too close to Hollywood but everything about that move rings true, aside from them not dying the second after they land in Vietnam. But each of the characters, their history, and their personal choices have lots of real world examples (a method actor who goes too far, an aging action star trying to revive his career, a fart comedy actor with a heroin addiction) and the situation they are would be some stupid shit a movie would try to pull to ""make something real happen"" even though the whole thing is complete bullshit. Even the premise that it's based on a veteran's experience but those experiences are complete fabrications rings true.

Anyways, I can see some of the little jokes like calling the heroin ""Jelly beans"" comes off as childish and silly but the core is solid and the acting/delivery/writing is top notch.

Edit: oh yeah, and actors taking their roles so seriously that they think they can actually be commandos in Vietnam just because their characters are commandos, that's some method actor bullshit that is *rampant* in Hollywood."
JoeRogan,fen4kn7,t1_fen2edx,1579276828.0,"Sometimes you have to look deeper than a surface pattern. He's got interviews with those people because he was on the anti-SJW hysteria track for a long time (arguably hasn't gotten off) but that doesn't make him a republican. In fact I think you'd be hard pressed to find a substantial number of right wing policies that he is hard and fast on. He supports abortion, he supports gay rights, he may shit on trans politics but he still supports them being trans freely, he supports UBI, universal healthcare, more taxes on the wealthy (though he is vocal about how throwing more money at a wasteful system isn't going to be helpful), and he's had many environmentalists on to talk about their efforts and support their work.

Even on guns he supports stronger background checks and focuses more on hunting than personal protection, but he's not wrong that hunting brings in substantial money for conservation efforts. 

Also, of course Bernie Sanders is on less than Ben Shapiro, this is Ben's job whole. Bernie is pretty fucking busy at the moment. But notice even on Ben's show its shitting on SJWs or the extreme left but he also got in a decent spat about Ben's wacky religious views and anti-gay beliefs."

Hell, I will often respond with ""Lol"" only when someone is texting me off the deep end and I want them to run out of steam without looking like I'm totally ignoring them (that'll usually direct the crazy at me)"

He makes any typical interview a lot more interesting because of it so people like him as a person regardless of whether or not he's cured cancer or flipped the entertainment industry on its head."

politics,fefog2x,t1_fefklpy,1579060836.0,"But that's a far cry from an assassnation plot by the US president. In fact, I doubt you could even prosecute the bottom rung for conspiracy. By that standard you could prosecute Rudy and Mulvaney for drug deaing because Bolton called it a drug deal.

Don't get me wrong, this is damning for other reasons like having Hyde surveil a US embassador via this presidentially approved private side channel, the idiocy and incompetence of said side channel, and yes the fact that their conversation touched on some goonish mafia bullshit shows how nobody in the administration has any business being in government but nobody is going to even see a courtroom on conspiracy to commit murder. Acting as an unregistered foreign agent maybe, illegal surveillance maybe, more articles of impeachment and a hopefully a load of an election/the Senate... We'll see.

Edit: just read the texts directly. Now I'm not so sure, that guy Hyde was really pushing the issue of acting before they moved her and the texts don't offer any good alternative explanation for what exactly he wanted to do. Still don't think he'll be prosecuted but JFC this needs to be shouted from the ramparts."
todayilearned,fedtl70,t1_fedbak1,1579019610.0,"Maybe it's just shock to the body. Like that episode of The Simpsons where Mr. Burns' doctor says he has all the diseases but they somehow are in total equilibrium. Burns takes it to mean he's invincible but the doctor quickly corrects him and says no, the second something goes out of whack the whole thing will collapse. My grandmother has something of a situation like this where she has COPD, congestive heart failure, either A or V fibrillation, atherosclerosis I think... they are somehow all in equilibrium, like her heart is weaker but the narrowing of her arteries is keeping her blood pressure up and somehow the other elements are in play too 

I had a great great uncle who chain smoked till the day he died at about 95, but I'd be willing to be that had he quit at 80, he'd have probably died sooner. Maybe changing the type of liquor had a similar effect."

College sports makes a lot of money *per capita* but that 15 billion across 70 million kids only means about 200$ per kid, which you can clear with league fees, a pair of cleats, and a baseball glove and you haven't even bought a uniform yet.

unpopularopinion,feckxtv,t1_feaz8u4,1578976454.0,"Look, the reason the US seems insulated from terrorism to a degree that Europe isn't, has a lot to do with assimilation. Look how many immigrants have risen to high places and listen to how the talk about their American pride while still appreciating and acknowledging their heritage. It's because our system was open to that in a way that Europe has resisted or wasn't able to accommodate. France for example holds on tightly to their culture and is pretty resistant to outsiders, which means immigrants go there and get treated like second class citizens, which opens the door for radicalism (though obviously don't garuntee it).

Even here, most non-white terrorists weren't integrated so they had no good reason to resist radicalization against the country. Obviously there are exceptions but the point is, if a person is only here for the benefits but doesn't give a fuck about America there's a higher chance of problems. If you doubt it, look no further than American tourists who fuck up historical sites in other countries because they don't respect that country and it's culture"

I used to work at In N Out and whenever I came home from closing after cleaning the grill, at some point later (judge not) I would itch my balls and could absolutely taste savory but never put 2 and 2 together, figu4ed I was just smelling In N Out that clings to you no matter what you do after an 9 hour shift.
