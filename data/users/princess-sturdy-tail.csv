chemhelp,ff91y35,t3_esc4df,1579702829.0,"When you burn the hydrocarbon in the bomb calorimeter, the heat from the fire causes the water temperature in the calorimeter to rise.   Since the calorimeter is well insulated all of the temperature increase is attributed to the energy released by burning the hydrocarbon.  I would start by looking in your book/notes for the equation that describes the reaction going on in the calorimeter.  I'll give you a hint:  you're looking for heat which has the symbol q"
chemhelp,ff916nj,t1_ff83wrc,1579702255.0,It depends on the direction of the reaction.  When I teach chem II I always include at least a few examples where -x is on the product side not the reactant side.
buffalobills,ff90xvr,t3_es6my6,1579702067.0,This is awesome!  Chemistry professor here and I'd love it if my students took their passions and applied them in some way to science.
AmItheAsshole,ff5us1l,t3_ern6e4,1579610971.0,One of my dad's favorite stories is about how he went on and on to my mom that he HATES sweet potatoes.  So of course she made a dish with them and told him it was pumpkin.  She let him rave about the dish for awhile before she told him the truth.  They're divorced now and he still laughs about it.  Definitely NTA
aww,ff35fl6,t1_ff2uxoe,1579534112.0,I came here to say this but you beat me to it!
chemhelp,ff2ssj8,t3_er9g91,1579522619.0,Your charges are incorrect.  To have a balanced equation the total charges should be equal on both sides of the arrow.  You have a total charge of +1 on the left and zero on the right.  You may want to go back and look at the rules for calculating oxidation states (charges).

dogs,fehvcq4,t3_ep5jpm,1579124606.0,I am so very sorry that you're going through this.  I just went through it in April and I can honestly say it's better to do it a little too soon than too late.  You don't want her to suffer if she doesn't have to.  Again I am so very sorry that you have to go through this.
weightwatchers,fegqwc7,t3_eozloj,1579100422.0,I'm on my first week and I'm still learning about making good choices and budgeting.  I've used a few of my weeklies each day when I need them.  I still have 30 remaining.  I don't intend to keep using them this way but until I learn a better way to eat I'm not going to feel guilty about using them.  I figure that's what they are there for.
AmItheAsshole,fegg0zp,t1_fegfqhw,1579091527.0,"Yes, Pantene is no longer accepting donations.  I found out after I cut 10 inches of my hair off last year.  They told me that most people prefer the synthetic hair, it's cooler and more comfortable."

AmItheAsshole,fck2s26,t1_fcjl6ne,1577714860.0,How is an all vegan menu a compromise on her part?  She has literally made no concessions at all.  That's not a compromise.
AmItheAsshole,fck2mwb,t1_fck1nf2,1577714733.0,"Having an all vegan menu isn't a compromise on her part either.  A true compromise is where each side gives up something.  A true compromise in this situation would be a menu consisting of both vegetarian and vegan options.  He gives up meat, she allows some cheese and dairy."
AmItheAsshole,fcijzfo,t3_eh9xoa,1577663824.0,INFO Has he always done this or did he start when his income increased?  I'm the primary breadwinner for the family and my husband makes jokes like that all the time.  It doesn't bother me because I do it to him when it's my turn to pay.
