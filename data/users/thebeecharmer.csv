popheads,ffgw56x,t1_fffvn3o,1579916581.0,"I honestly kind of wish Halsey hadn't blown up so much, but I think that comes from me latching onto the Badlands era during my very brief ""not like other girls""/emo phase in high school. As much as I cringe at a lot of the lyrics on that album now, I still have a nostalgia for them, and I do still like her newer stuff."
college,ff4zany,t1_ff4ne68,1579576068.0,"I'm bored in class, doing homework, even the more fun events on campus. Even when I'm busy. It all gets a bit repetitive, which means boredom for me."
Knoxville,ff2613m,t1_ff24ow3,1579494797.0,"I worked on the Cumberland strip for a year. Was I yelled at, begged for money, and harassed? Yes. I also met some of the nicest people I've ever known down there who happened to be homeless and just trying to get by. It isn't fair to judge all of them by the actions of a few."
college,ff247cy,t3_er72ir,1579493344.0,"Yeah, from a combo of stress, being overworked, and the sheer boredom that comes from being in college. I genuinely would rather jump off a bridge than go back sometimes."
Knoxville,ff23rzv,t1_ff1s6lx,1579493012.0,Someone didn't learn basic compassion.
actuallesbians,ff20u2n,t3_er46k2,1579490787.0,"I'm in the same boat, like down to the exact age. We've just got to put ourselves out there! A girlfriend won't just fall in our laps (god I wish)."
AskReddit,feohhw2,t1_fennun8,1579300246.0,"Think Thomas Rhett, FGL, and the like. If they just went full pop, I would have no problem with their music (still wouldn't be my taste), but they throw in a fiddle or a line about red dirt roads and call it country."
college,febtadh,t1_fe8ryhr,1578962442.0,"I've done this the past two semesters, and I think it's the best way. I luckily managed to have a shorter day overall by having six back-to-back classes, so my days were from 8 am to 2 pm. Basically like high school with a bit more stress."
AskReddit,fdhfsoq,t1_fdh9wub,1578421728.0,"I am beginning to hate the ""info: what the fuck"" meme that keeps being regurgitated on every slightly popular post."
pics,fd76ymc,t1_fd5bn53,1578200235.0,"My family literally kicked me out at 16 for being a lesbian, and I was homeless for three months. My best friend got his teeth kicked in for being gay by his dad. Do all gay people face the same stuff? No. And I'm sure my two anecdotes mean nothing to someone who has already made up their mind. But to say there is no oppression in the West is definitely incorrect."
starterpacks,fcm17xq,t1_fckmy50,1577761576.0,"It's definitely there at this point, and Knoxville is playing catch-up. I heard a radio ad for an axe-throwing thing just this evening."
popheads,favrha1,t1_fauj0yx,1576361505.0,"Miranda Lambert is also good, but her earlier stuff is very country sounding."
