FreeCompliments,fej8e81,t3_ep810h,1579161313.0,"I feel like you stand out in a crowd of people. And I mean that in a good way, you look fantastic and like a kind person with a heart of gold :) I hope your future days will be much better than today/yesterday."
pkmntcgcollections,feg6xks,t3_eoxx2h,1579079867.0,"Don't mind me OP, I'm just piggybacking on this thread as well because I would like to know it as well. Pokemon Sword/Shield has pulled me back into Pokemon and I would love to start collecting!"
FreeCompliments,fe71j8y,t3_enx6vq,1578908806.0,"You look wonderful and so full of happiness! Please don't settle for anything less for yourself. You deserve to be loved for who you are, and for what you stand for. I share those feelings of wanting to settle for less to get rid of the loneliness, but I believe that if you love yourself enough, especially if you are single, you are never truly alone. You have your friends who are there for you, your family and if not, you have random strangers who smile when they see your picture :)

You've got this OP! With that glorious smile and those happy looking eyes, you will get someone who appreciates you deeply within no time!"

FreeCompliments,fcx221i,t3_ejb8l2,1578047754.0,"You radiate confidence! Keep that pretty smile, and remind yourself that it's also okay to feel low sometimes, it happens to all of us. Take good care of yourself, be proud of yourself for all the good things you've done so far and never let anyone tell you otherwise! I'm ridiculously proud of you for leaving the abusive relationship, I bet that wasn't easy. Have an amazing life :)"
FreeCompliments,fcwvzhe,t3_ejakf0,1578039937.0,I really like your hair and your eyes just stand out! I hope you will start feeling better soon OP. You are great looking and you deserve all the happiness out there
happy,fcmppxy,t1_fcmpiza,1577786101.0,"Ah it's all good. It's just something that will get better eventually (I was the exact same a year ago but this past year I've learnt to not talk down on my milestones and to be proud of the things I do!)

Keep working on it, you've got this OP :)"
happy,fcmpbix,t3_ehslbt,1577785533.0,"It's not silly! Considering there was a series of interviews and assessments, and the fact that it made you happy does not make it any less amazing. I'm really proud of you and happy for you :)"
FreeCompliments,fcmp2xv,t3_ehxt5n,1577785188.0,"You look absolutely amazing! I love your eyes and your smile :) Anyone would be lucky to date you, and just know that everyone has flaws that they worry about. The less you worry about it yourself, the more confident you can be around others. You've got this!"
FreeCompliments,fbu5ipc,t1_fbu558q,1577108112.0,"That's totally okay! Trust me, I have the same struggles (and had them constantly during the summer) but luckily I found someone who made me realize I'm beautiful and worthy.
Have a lovely Holidays and a very happy New Year! 2020 will be your year!"
