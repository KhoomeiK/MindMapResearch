So we all exist, more and more, in our little tiny pockets of like-minded sympathizers seeing ONLY favorable things.  No one REALLY communicates, and so bias and misinformation just run rampant.    


I imagine a staunch antivaxxers FB account, has 70%-80% of people who disagree with their bullshit.  But they're mostly all blocked and hidden and unfollowed, etc.   Posts are rigged on the feed to ONLY show what the user likes (kind of like a Google Search, which shows tailored results of queries).   So does that person learn through conversation- putting their foot in their mouths?  Do they think twice about posting something because they know it'll get disseminated and fact-checked to show they might be wrong?   Nope.    They exist every day, getting that dopamine hit by having the 20%-30% of others (in their same bubbles) validating EVERYTHING.  Creating this false shell of reality that serves no other purpose than to keep the user engaged with the website.  


Then we get those tiny sparks of conflict, when someone presses through and disagrees.  Disagreements turn personal almost every single time.

If it's something that provides social benefit to people, they complain it's SOCIALISM!  If it's something that provides communal benefit to people, they complain it's COMMUNISM!They basically want to pollute and discriminate, and pesky national policies get in the way.  So they complain about ""BIG GOVERNMENT"", hoping that smaller pockets of like-minded assholes can be enabled to implement shit-tier policies instead, to set precedent and normalization.Of course, they think socialism is TERRIFIC if you're paying for the military.  And they think Communism is great if it happens at the behest of a company.   But if communal payments go towards public infrastructure or communal benefit- it's ""theft"" because they'd prefer to benefit from the infrastructure without contributing.

There's a streak of anarchy, that I see Libertarians quickly back-away from when pressed, but all conversations about self sufficiency seem to start off with tough-talk as though they can prosper better without a government (the opinion is that less government is BETTER!).Of course, then when you bring up paying for law enforcement and a legal system so they don't get fucked by people physically stronger than themselves, they tend to be much more ""democratic"" about the need for government protection.

tldr; Libertarians are just a conservatives way of defining their double-standard."
