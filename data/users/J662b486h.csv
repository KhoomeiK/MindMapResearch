Cooking,ffs7pjt,t1_ffrb54o,1580175189.0,I do a lot of cooking and making pasta is one of those things that really does take practice - it's more than just following a recipe. You wouldn't think something with only three or four ingredients would be that way.
Cooking,ffqiiqa,t1_ffqhhcg,1580135551.0,"I've always used a recipe from the NY Times which used 2 cups all-purpose flour to 2 large eggs plus two egg yolks. However it sometimes gets pretty stiff and I've learned to start off with less flour and add more if necessary. I recently found a recipe from Serious Eats that uses ten ounces (about 2 cups) flour to two large eggs (about 4 ounces) plus *four* yolks (about 2.5 ounces), but I haven't tried it yet.     

I also found someone who exhaustively tested flour / egg ratios by weight and came up with 1.64 grams flour per 1gram of egg. I think this is the most logical way to do it since even ""large"" eggs vary in size - you can weigh the eggs first and then multiply that by 1.64 to get the amount of flour needed. Their yolks / whole egg ratio was two yolks per one whole egg. But I haven't tried this method yet either."
Cooking,ffqhp5g,t1_ffpyh8w,1580134898.0,"Sometimes it's just a terminology thing. All grocery stores carry dried ""egg noodles"" usually in the same aisle as traditional dried pasta. It's just not called ""pasta"". I haven't been too impressed with them either. For me it's usually either regular dried pastas like the Barilla brand or homemade pasta when I have the energy."

It's still a crap way to live but maybe not *completely* impossible. You'd probably use a fold-out couch against the wall where I placed the bed, mount your TV on the wall opposite, and put a freestanding chest of drawers / cabinet / closet setup of some kind somewhere along the wall going towards the kitchen. They should also have put a bigger cabinet above the bathroom sink, a cabinet above the toilet, and a cabinet above the refrigerator. It'd end up about the same as a very small hotel room."
EarthPorn,ffpbung,t3_eua16h,1580091158.0,"That'd be great to explore - jump off the edge, press ""X"" to pop up the paraglider and just float on down oh crap I did it *again*. I've been playing *wayyyy* too much Breath of the Wild."
Cooking,ffpaue5,t3_eua59u,1580090457.0,"As others have mentioned, the boxed dried pasta on the grocery store shelf is actually a different product than ""fresh pasta"" - ""fresh pasta"" has eggs and the dried commercial products are just flour and water. Both types of pasta are perfectly fine in recipes appropriate for them.    

However, in my experience the refrigerated ""fresh"" pasta sold in grocery stores isn't particularly good, at least the ones I've tried. Instead I make my *own* fresh pasta and I think it's incredible - I like it much better than store-bought fresh pasta, and in recipes where they're interchangeable, better than the dried pastas. Making pasta at home isn't difficult but it does take a little practice, or at least it did for me.   

You said your Italian friend makes her own pasta and dries it out. Couple comments on that - first of all, homemade pasta that has been dried out is still a *different* product than the ""dried pasta"" on the grocery store shelf, again because the homemade pasta is made with eggs. Basically, fresh pasta that's dried is not the same thing as the ""dried pasta"" sold on store shelves (confusing). OTOH, and I guess this is controversial, but there's no *need* to dry homemade pasta. Cook it as soon as it's been rolled out and cut into noodles (or whatever shape you need)! I *never* dry my homemade pasta and it's absolutely delicious."

The exception was children - for some reason he just *loved* children. Whenever he had a chance to meet one his tail would start whipping back and forth and he'd lick their faces like crazy.

photography,ff1tlk4,t1_ff0rn62,1579485889.0,"That's true for modern cameras but we're talking history here, and it meant quite a bit in the early days. A one-megapixel photo is pretty worthless no matter how high the quality of the accompanying hardware - at the standard print resolution of 300 ppi, a one-megapixel photo would be maybe four inches wide. The pixel count had to get high enough to create useful photos before there was even any point to improving the accompanying hardware, and that's pretty much how it worked out."
photography,ff1syph,t1_ff176zy,1579485488.0,"You're correct, plus there's a pretty basic issue here: a one-megapixel photo simply isn't very *good* for much. At the standard high-quality print resolution of 300ppi, a one-megapixel camera could print maybe a four-inch wide photo. There's not even any point to developing, say, a professional-quality line of lens for a camera that no pro would use. The megapixel count *had* to get high enough to attract pros before the industry would start looking at the entire package."
photography,feyt2us,t3_eqwrai,1579450259.0,"My first digital camera was a one-megapixel Kodak. It cost just under $1000. I took a lot of photos with it, but I've pretty much deleted them all by now.

Modern dishwashers are several orders of magnitude better but the bad reputation they established in their early years lingers on. When my sister-in-law (who is my age) visits me she always rinses and cleans every single item before putting it in the dishwasher. Meanwhile I'm taking plates and stuff off the table and directly loading them into the dishwasher.  Dishwashers these days really are amazing especially for those of us who grew up with the first generation. You really do not need to pre-wash dishes other than scraping off uneaten bits of food - and even that isn't all that necessary because dishwashers have small garbage disposals built into them.
