TrueChristian,fc5n2ji,t3_eg4m0f,1577461874.0,Do some research on the founder of the Jehovahs Witness(he had ties with the freemasons). Jehovahs Witness isn’t the true path.
TrueChristian,fc5mqgk,t3_efzkwq,1577461655.0,"God made you to serve a one purpose and no other. Going on your own path (following your heart) isn’t the right path to take, maybe God is trying to protect you from something ,someone or whatever else that would have happened. I’m not sure what your vocation is but that is where you will be successful and happy because you did Gods will for your life."
