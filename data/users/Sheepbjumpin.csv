Remember, there are no pro-life people, only anti-women people.

Denying women agency over their own bodies (a right granted automatically and inviolably to men) is fundamentally an act of violence against women. It is inexcusable and it is active, deliberate hatred.

You cannot say ""I don't hate women, I just do hateful things to women...""

It's not ""pro-life"", it's just anti-women.

It's foetuses-have-more-rights-to-an-eleven-year-old-girl's-body-than-she-does. It's rapists have more right to her body than she does...

It's women-have-fewer-rights-than-corpses.

Never is a person required to surrender their health, safety, bodily-autonomy or bodily-integriry for the service of another.

People - actual real living people - die for want of transplant organs. We don't force other people to give up theirs, even if they are organs that come in pairs.

We don't even take organs from corpses unless the person made the choice to become an organ donor while they were alive.

Only in this one case do we say that a person has no rights over their own body or life - and not even for the sake of another life. For the sake of a fetus... A thing. A thing with no more life or independence than a tumor.

And the only reason we decide that the person has no rights in this one case, is because the person in question is a woman.

There are no pro-life people, just anti-women people.

No matter how they try to euphemise their actions, they are deliberately withholding from women the right to life, to choice, to bodily integrity and bodily autonomy. We both know they'd never do that to any man. And we both know it's in no sense about 'life'.

But of course forced-birthers don't actually consider abortion to be murder, nor do they consider a foeuts to be a child.

A person who believes that abortion is murder would care about miscarriages. Remember, 40-60% of pregnancies self-terminate. Imagine if all of a sudden, 40% to 60% of babies just started to die of “natural causes”

Seriously, this is a legit thought-experiment. Take a moment to imagine how the world would react if 40-60% of babies just randomly died.

Society would be going crazy. People would be losing their minds. You couldn't walk down the street without passing a weeping parent or a flower memorial. Every resource society had would be dedicated to figuring out what is going on. Nobody would be able to function because of how sad and depressed and upset they were. All the time. Children are dying!

Of course, 40-60% of babies don't just randomly die. But 40-60% of pregnancies do miscarry - usually very early. Usually around the time most abortions happen, in fact.

If forced-birthers truly believe that those bean-sized blastocysts are precious pre-born babies they should, and would be acting like our imagined scenario above... But that isn’t how forced birthers act. They don’t seem to care about miscarriages whatsoever.

Miscarriages are also linked to the environment. Cleaner air, less pollution, healthier food, less stress, better healthcare… All of these things could be researched and we could learn how to reduce the amount of miscarriages. If they actually believed that foetuses are babies they'd be working night and day to address this terrible tidal wave of death... Truly pro-life people would be campaigning and donating for cleaner air and water, for better, freer healthcare. For better working conditions and so on.

Anything to save the poor babies. To reduce these miscarriages which outnumber abortions by thousands.

But they don't.

A person who believes that abortion is murder would advocate for better sex education and freer access to contraceptives. Anti-women people never do that. (Indeed, they are largely against both.)

A person who believes that abortion is murder would advocate for legal abortion, knowing that it always reduces abortion rates in every country. Anti-women people never do that.

A person who believes that abortion is murder would advocate for feminism in society and gender-equality in the workplace - since both reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies. Anti-women people never do that.

A person who believes that abortion is murder would care about all the viable embryos discarded as a by-product of IVF procedures. Anti-women people don't care.

A truly pro-life person would be against capital punishment. Anti-women people never are. (Indeed they seem to glory in it...)

None of the things that anti-women people do show any desire to save 'pre-born lives'. All of their actions show only a desire to punish women for being women.

It has never been about protecting life, any life, only about hurting women.
