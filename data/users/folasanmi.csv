Like you shame people for other reasons like drug addiction and so forth. You can say you don’t shame people at all because some things should be shamed because they are harmful to the victim and the people who love them.

But yes people can be disrespectful, Unempathetic and simply want to see you in a lower state of being. And quite frankly we haven’t learned the best ways to communicate something that shouldn’t be mostly because it’s just innate.

Holding your semen doesn’t inherently make you more attractive, because you still have to put in the work. In the same way that you won’t get a new job or fix all your problems solely for holding your nut. What it does give you is a new found self respect and love that manifests itself in confidence and alpha male behavior, and in turn you don’t overthink approaching a girl or taking risks."

selfhelp,fejtuyn,t3_epikp6,1579185722.0,I think that we have been conditioned from an early age to resist certain feelings and certain emotions. Like maybe your parents shamed you from being angry and now when you feel anger you resist it and try and put on a mask of happiness when you aren’t really happy. I think it’s not the emotions that harm us but the resistance to those emotions that harm us on a daily basis. And this is happening on  a subconscious level. And the only way to “go with the flow” as you propose is to let go of our attachment to being happy and let go of our resistance to feeling angry.

Semenretention,fe8hjcr,t3_eo2y2u,1578926205.0,Mgtow and red pill philosophy is a new and has only been around in contemporary period because of modern day feminsm and things of that nature. Also technological advances that have aided certain tendencies women have that make it harder for us men to connect with and attract women. That why men find different avenues to meet women via redpill or puaism because mainstream advice is not offering those choices to men and is actually failing them in a lot of ways. You have a lot to thank from the redpill and Mgtow because without it you prob hot wouldn’t know about semen retention most likely.
