Terraria,ffa59v9,t1_ffa1twb,1579728152.0,"I think you should try to get the Stormbow, along with holy arrows.  After all, if you can’t defeat a hallowed mimic, you might not be ready for a mech boss yet.  I still think getting the nimbus rod is a good idea, though!"
Terraria,ff4v4he,t3_erk1j4,1579573173.0,I love this house- the bar room and potion room are very cool and creative!
Terraria,ff4ub6o,t3_ermxsw,1579572620.0,"I think you sound pretty ready.  If you have corruption or crimson near your house or the jungle, I would recommend isolating them with hellevators before you start hardmode."
Terraria,ff4u428,t3_ern0fa,1579572488.0,"For me, if I have molten armor and the molture fury with hellfire arrows (my go to for WoF), two stacks of stone long is way more than enough.  However, this may be different based on your equipment!"
LushCosmetics,ff4tosz,t3_ergkdl,1579572198.0,I am so envious of your bubble bar collection- especially polar bear plunge!
