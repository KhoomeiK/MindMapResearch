I find the blue line to be a toxic image of cops standing between good citizens and criminals, not crime. It's us versus them, and if you don't support cops then you support criminals.

IMO cops are public servants to all citizens, especially those that commit crimes.

There are no criminals, just citizens that have been caught committing crimes. That's just my soapbox though. Fuck the ~~police~~ system making bad cops and branding citizens."

A JJ trilogy or Rian trilogy would have both been better than what we got. Same with the Snyder cut or the original Suicide Squad. They're terrified of a mediocre/niche film and are chasing max profit at the same time. They jump on fads, revive the same material, and overcorrect against any negativity.

Fan-sourcing? It's not like JJ or even Spielberg are the greatest out there, they're the best that have managed to succeed. I think the key part is picking a vision and sticking through it so even if it's flawed, you can say it's a decent auteur movie."
