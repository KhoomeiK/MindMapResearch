AskReddit,ffj61o6,t1_ffio7w3,1579991302.0,"It is hard and as someone who just got out of school like almost a year ago, I have almost zero friends from college left. We all pretty much went out separate ways, or realized we didn’t  have anything in common besides being in college and the same classes together. 

On top of that, I’ve also pushed some people out. I’ve been alone for a few months now, but hopefully it’s temporary and new people come along. In the meantime, I’m trying to figure out why I can’t seem to form healthy relationships and why I push people away in the end...with the help of counseling of course."
tifu,ff8tgxa,t3_es489q,1579695471.0,"Don’t be like my parents who displayed their hate for each other in front of us. Fucked me up. I saw some physical abuse and now I really hate my father for it and am mad at my mother for not protecting us from him and admitting there was an issue.

Parents are supposed to make sure their kids have a safe place to grow up in. Not saying you’re physically abusive or anything.

Divorce sounds like it would be good for everyone involved in the long run. She’s also trying to have more babies so stop doing that unless that’s what you want...."

My father and I are estranged at this point due to years of tension and me ultimately beginning to no longer accept the way he treated me.

As for my mother, she seems to be easier to get through to. But, she has crazy expectations and throws a fit when you decide to meet your own. Too bad. 

I’m getting too old for that fuckery. 

I have taken a “ thats your opinion. You won’t be around forever so stop acting like I need to depend on you. I don’t care about other people’s input unless they’re a direct influence on my career ( i.e person(s) training me)” approach.

Funny how people can be so mad when you’re doing well."

depression,fcoaex9,t3_ei19sk,1577827439.0,"I feel like I want to. Except, people are coming over. I’m going to try to enjoy myself because quite personally, I’m tired of being depressed. This is the deepest hole I’ve ever been in, and I’ve been cutting back on efforts to get myself out. 

It’s my only hope. I tried to kill myself over the summer, and finally started opening up about it to people close to me just recently. If I don’t try and change now, I’m gonna be dead before 2021. 

I’m physically, mentally, and emotionally exhausted, but I gotta understand what it means to actually stick with getting better. It’s not always going to be easy and it’s probably gonna be really fucking painful. But I have to.

No fake smiles, but I’m going to attempt to live this time.

My friend, I hope you have an amazing evening in solitude and that your year goes splendid. I wish you nothing but the best. My heart is with you."
