Unless that came directly from human resources with legal CC'd (or vice versa), I'd be suspicious. People get fired over verbal harassment- with or without threats to one's person- every day; tampering with a coworker's food is arguably direct workplace violence. Bare minimum, it's trespass to chattels (interference with your personal property) that ultimately resulted in bodily harm. Whether he intended to make you sick or not is irrelevant. That's why negligence and recklessness are included in tort law. 

In any case, I'm very sorry that happened to you and am glad you no longer have to work with that jerk. Hopefully that different department also has no access to your breakroom or fridges. Absolutely no one deserves that nonsense."
