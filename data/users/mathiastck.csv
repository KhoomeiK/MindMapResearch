My perspective is the opposite, increase transparency in government, and increase the ability of different governmental and NGOs to watchdog each other.

Getting elected on campaign promises he never had any intention of keeping?  Promising to withdraw troops and instead doubling them?  I mean I can understand being a single issue voter misguided enough to support him for that one issue, but what's odiously toxic is not being able to discuss the damage he is self inflicting on so many other fronts."
