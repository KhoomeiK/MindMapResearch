BrandNewSentence,ffclab2,t1_ffc0im0,1579801868.0,"Well well well, look who it is, Dragonofoo's wife's friend from work."
wholesomememes,ff9w1wf,t3_esf08z,1579722756.0,I can still remember the compliment my grandma would give me word for word. She died 12 years ago. That's how important giving others a compliment is.
offmychest,ff6htq0,t3_ervort,1579627509.0,"Honestly I don't think either should exist. We shouldn't celebrate just because the color of a persons skin, we should be celebrating the great people that changed history for the better, not because their skin was black but because their hearts were in the right place. (MLK Jr, Malcolm X, Harriet Tubman, etc.)"
DMAcademy,ff5hu8w,t3_ero46e,1579593544.0,"I mean the only part that was dumb to me was that he was randomly turned into a baby after being killed? I think it was more confusing than dumb actually. I think the rest of it is fine, remember this is a brief backstory, not a multimillionaire story that will be turned into a movie. I would just work with them to make the backstory compatible with the world you are building and is understandable, otherwise they can do whatever they want. Its their PC."
DMAcademy,ff3hp2w,t3_erg2ao,1579541265.0,"A DM I had would do turns when we were in villages. We would each do an action in the town and the DM would move on to the next person til everyone was finished. Though this might be harder in a dungeon. I would give more time to the bigger group since there are more people in it. Have them do a puzzle or something that takes time to think and switch to the lone player in the forest, then switch back and forth as needed. You should also let your players know beforehand that this is happening so they know what to expect. 
If it becomes too much you could always have an enemy in the forest know about something in the dungeon that could kill the PCs, so the lone PC has to make the decision to warn the rest of the party."
DMAcademy,fenutke,t3_eq217u,1579291165.0,Symbols are great tools. Have the symbol on the artifact and somewhere near or on the lich. Hopefully your players will remember where they saw that symbol.
DMAcademy,fenuaa4,t1_fen7rk9,1579290843.0,WHAT... is your favorite color?
dankmemes,fenrn77,t1_fen3qtd,1579289745.0,I think you are supposed to use words. Don't quote me on that though.

offmychest,fdg9pl3,t1_fdem15f,1578386120.0,"You know what the sad part is, I am in America and the only place I have read that Australia is on fire is on Reddit."
offmychest,fdee9w5,t1_fdealpu,1578337132.0,Oh man you are so right I should have known the geography of Australia and the fire and weather patterns so I could formulate how many people are in danger of dying. (This is sarcastic.)
offmychest,fdea7fx,t1_fde2a3i,1578334582.0,"Wait, people are dying? Do they know how many so far?"
mattcolville,fdapzcc,t3_ekdxzx,1578248861.0,"Pull out your phone and find some ye olde crowd murmuring music, it usually doesnt feel like a big town because of how quiet it is without the constant talking. You would be surprised at the difference music and sound makes. Then use some of the other great comments to describe the city itself."
DMAcademy,fd8m37o,t3_ek8axe,1578220023.0," It never works out how you expect it to work out, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Just focus on trying to have fun, if you are enjoying the game, the players are enjoying it too. Good job on filling in for you main DM, they need breaks too!"
offmychest,fd1myx4,t3_ejsfrd,1578133592.0,"After reading this I realized that I have never been kissed, I guess it is something I haven't really put much thought into until now. I would focus on better things, relationahips will come to you if you look out for them, and if they don't you shouldn't worry so much about it."
AskReddit,fcml6tx,t1_fcmfrv6,1577779902.0,"Seriously, I'm a mommas boy, so any woman that will give me the time of day has my full attention."
offmychest,fcjm4ae,t3_ehh0vs,1577693374.0,"People don't like to be reminded of their own faults and weaknesses. So you may be smart but people won't want to hear it, because it reminds them of how they struggled to learn. I think instead of focusing on what other people think, you should be focusing on what to do with this gift that has been given to you."
offmychest,fc3hhwa,t3_efxe7a,1577389910.0,Probably because they haven't spent very much time around women. Was very awkward as a teenager and had no idea what girls did in their free time. Bake cookies? Go shopping? I believed pretty much what was showed in movies.
