intersex,ffbdzx9,t3_eshvby,1579761277.0,"I kinda know what you are going through. But my intersex variance is also totally different. My genital surgery was more minor. I had a urethra that in a different place than many guys. Doctors forced me through surgery to ""fix"" this. All it resulted in is a bunch of scar tissue, a fistula and emotional trauma that made me insecure about my masculine gender identity- it was like doctors were saying I wasn't ""boy enough"" so they put me through surgery.

But so could be said about many choices, and we often don't take the easier path because we know in the end it won't make us happy. I will be with whoever I fall in love with, whoever is a committed partner to me, and I will love regardless of whats going between their legs.

If thats the case, and you think you just discovered your clitoris than its likely you could be intersex.

foreskin_restoration,fdpu9so,t3_emcxqr,1578640734.0,"The only reason I don't like this, is this is the MAIN tactic of cutting culture, and how you keep the system going. Back in the 1800's some uncut religious English upper class father got his son circumcised (probably at 10 no less) because ""boys shouldn't masturbate! It will pollute his body causing all kinds of health problems!! Its a sign of poor moral fiber!"" 

And this was done because people believed for a while in that first generation that it made masturbation IMPOSSIBLE. For the boys whole life. Of course the Dad never got cut because he told the world he could restrain himself! (In private of course he was wanking away at his foreskin, and thinking he stopped his son from every enjoying self pleasure) 

&#x200B;

That boy grew up feeling different, he also knew everything his Dad thought was bullshit. But he still felt wronged, so what did he do? He circumcised his son, because now his son shares his same fate, and he feels less bad. And the cycle continued generation after generation, and it was ok because ""We're all circumcised!"" 

Cutting culture, circumcision makes no fucking sense unless its a cycle of abuse where it becomes normalized. ""We're all circumcised."" 

&#x200B;

I think its more emotionally healthy to take the power and identity of circumcision away from it. Target and identify the emotional and physical trauma you experienced, as its valid. But also remember all the ways you are the SAME to intact men. Don't give circumcision power over your identity, or you are letting circumcision culture win.

But everything you describe about how you feel about your body, and sexual self holds true for me. How being surgically altered made you feel a bit separated from yourself, your gender, and your sexual nature. How you noticed that most when comparing yourself to peers. How you hesitate to even touch yourself there. 

&#x200B;

Talking to your parents, mine also were shocked, didn't really know what the surgery was, and didn't really know what to say. 

&#x200B;

One point I disagree with you on is about moving forward. Everyone is different and you must do whats best for yourself. But so much was taken from us, so often other peoples perspectives were put before our own. I think its important to put yours first. 

&#x200B;

If you think its possible your parents could be lying to you, that seed of doubt is already there. You don't FULLY trust them. And considering everything that happened to you, thats a very natural response. I think whatever the story actually is, if your parents know more or not- the TRUTH is they love you. Even if they made a lot of mistakes, they made those thinking those were the best choices. They weren't, but in terms of your love for them, that shouldn't change things. 

&#x200B;

But in terms of feeling emotionally comfortable in your own skin, to feel self empowered and in control its important you know your own story. You have a fundamental right to it! Also if a doctor altered you, WITHOUT a parents consent there is a good chance he/she did that to other parents and intersex kids, and could STILL be doing that.

&#x200B;

I think something you may try working on is rather than pushing out emotions you don't like, try and embrace them, and understand them. One tactic that has helped with me, is Ill sit in a negative feeling and try to imagine if certain things were different how would I feel about this now? Its a tactic that can help build perspective to your understanding of how you feel, but can also feel empowering. 

A simple example is you have had a bad day and think ""Where could i be right now, or what could I be doing that would make me happy?"" And you imagine instead of being in that parking lot you were on that beach you visited two years ago. 

&#x200B;

With circumcision maybe imagine ""If i was magically intact again, what would that emotionally FEEL like right now?"" What about that situation would make me feel that way? Is there someway I could feel any of those feelings now? What if I got pushed into circumcision as an adult? What if I was cut at 11? In what way would this moment restoring feel differently to me. Why?

foreskin_restoration,fcwryak,t3_ej9f73,1578035206.0,"I think I could say the obvious. Like how most of my inner foreskin was cut off, so most of penis which is suppose to be made up of soft, extremely sensitive skin- and a particular kind of nerve endings were cut off, and instead left with just regular skin stretched over my penis. 

&#x200B;

But beyond that, I have always felt violated. I have really obvious surgical scars from my circ. I always knew someone had done something to my penis, someone had it in their hand and altered it. So I never felt in control of my own body, I never ""virgin"" or ""pure"". It was like my body had a life time's worth of terrible experiences that I couldnt even remember. 

&#x200B;

So I think thats always made me feel like i could never really know myself, its put wall up between me and my most intimate self. And when you cant be TRUELY intimate with yourself you cant be truly relaxed, or ""in"" your own body. And if you cant have those basic things you cant have true intimate sex with someone else. So I have never really had sex that felt like anything other than an ejaculation. Nothing that ever surprised me, or filled me with joy, or sent waves through my body, or made me more connected to a sex partner- even temporarily. I just always felt on the outside, of myself, but also outside the intimacy of sex itself. 

&#x200B;

But I also believe there is a reason to this. Circumcision comes with a cultural purpose to control men, to keep them in their role, and it dismisses the importance of a man having intimate enjoyment of sex. People always say ""yeah he is circumcised, but look he can still cum!"" The cultural construct of sex for men is the duel purpose of boasting a false sense of masculine achievement with the utilitarian purpose of reproduction. The penis is ""romantically"" framed by the hands of toxic masculinity as nothing more than another tool in a mans tool belt. Like a hammer or wrench it has singular function and god help society if a man has a deeper emotional to anything he does. That could make him less of a man!"

restoringdick,fctl2y4,t1_fcpmps1,1577947228.0,"Wow, thank you so much for all the details. I took a screen shot so I can look this more over later. From just a casual read this seems like a really complicated routine, but obviously for you it must come second nature at this point. How did you get to this point? What is your over arching philosophy that structured your routine, and what you enact when you come to situations in life that force you to switch up what you do? 

Just constant low tension, thats as even as possible? 

I doubt you can help with this second question- but since you seem to know your stuff, Ill ask anyway, just in case. I have a fistula- a tube of scar tissue that sits where my frenulum use to be, it connects my urethra tube to the shaft of my penis. Essentially its the same as if I had gotten a prince albert piercing. 

When I have retained constantly over a few weeks I noticed the fistula starting to hurt. And its made me stop restoring, multiple times. I don't really know if that will prevent me from restoring. I am worried it will break, or expand. (not sure if that possible) 

Anyway like I said, not sure if that second question you have an answer for. But throwing it out anyway. Thanks again!"

intersex,fcpi742,t1_fcnbjbb,1577864998.0,"Thank you for the emotion. I still don't fully feel like I have the right to FEEL like my body was violated. That may sound crazy, intellectually I know I have that right, but after a childhood of shame, emotionally I am still getting there, so your anger helps. 

&#x200B;

The problem is that doctors are like plumbers, they know how to fix the pipes according to a strict set of blue prints trained to them in medical school. The difference is a human has an emotional make up, and don't all come in one design. (Lets not even get into all the ways medical science screws over women simply because the male blue print is often used to treat their bodies). 

&#x200B;

There are doctors who learn this, they are Psychologists. Yet amazingly surgeons do not consider medical policy based off the advice from Psychologists. It is divided, they ASSUME that ""fixed"" means better. But they don't understand how much more complicated things are."

restoringdick,fcmjf45,t3_ehv34y,1577777716.0,"See this is a perfect example of how its so much worse to have your frenulum removed too. If you restore CORRECTLY with a frenulum (you can also do it badly) it can almost look EXACTLY like you were always uncut. 

&#x200B;

Thankfully I have heard that circumcisions these days rarely remove the frenulum. Its also a small sign how the tide is changing culturally even in the medical world in terms of body modification of babies. They are not as bold as they use to be."

I had my penis cut apart in surgeries that when looked at online look like a Frankenstein experiment. I have for a while now really wanted to understand what was done to my penis, but just looking at diagrams that explain it churns my stomach. 

&#x200B;

Why? All because I would have peed from a slightly different angle then what was ""normal"". Now I have scars all over my penis, a fistula, and natural looking urethra opening- also had my foreskin cut off. 

&#x200B;

I grew up feeling like a freak, feeling ashamed of my body. All because some group of doctors decided MY body bothered THEM, so decided for ME to cut it up, because that would make me happy. 

&#x200B;

Its sad modern medical science doesn't understand such a basic concept as bodily autonomy, and that they MUST hold it with far greater value and care than they do now!"
