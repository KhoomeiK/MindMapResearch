worldnews,fendmuz,t1_fen4vch,1579282434.0,Plants secrete chemicals to defend themselves through chemical reaction. I thought this was taught in grade 3.
worldnews,femzpxd,t1_femz9c6,1579273701.0,You can get the same nutrition from plants. Birthing something just to kill it is cruel. 70% of cow meat comes from factory farms and 90% of every other commonly consumed meat (pigs chickens etc) come from factory farms. Don’t build a straw man and respond exactly to what I’m saying please.
worldnews,femy1e7,t1_femxt6l,1579272546.0,Or just making sure you get all of your nutrients? I’ve seen you going damage control mode on this whole post so I wouldn’t expect you to argue in good faith. There are thousands of vegans who live without meat and have the same lifespans as meat eaters. I don’t know why people like you defend the cruelty so much.
worldnews,femx654,t1_femtdiz,1579271930.0,"Just like how meat eaters are also deficient in many things! Wow, it’s like having a balanced diet and making sure you get all of your nutrients is important, shockingly!"
worldnews,femx0z3,t1_femth19,1579271826.0,Lol
news,fel327k,t1_fek6yk7,1579212990.0,Yes veganism bad when billions of animals die every year but Reddit only focuses on stuff they can’t control and are hypocrites. Is Reddit a hive mind or something?

“Dude shut the fuck up it’s a personal choice”"
funny,fel2lzh,t1_fek2i4z,1579212710.0,"Or to point out how much suffering animals goes through and how useless of a process it is, but yeah whatever you said. This is a certified Reddit moment"
PoliticalCompassMemes,fekcvp5,t1_fekawz7,1579197399.0,"So it seems like you have the younger generation on your side. You can use it as a point like “Look, all of the younger people agree with us!”."
PoliticalCompassMemes,fejxkf6,t1_fejw0ml,1579188145.0,You could just google what zoomers say online. It’s not hard to pretend you’re someone you aren’t without requiring actual proof.
PoliticalCompassMemes,fejvnnb,t1_fejp7me,1579186905.0,"Bro most of this message is just a assumption towards the other guy. And the reason they would lie is to make it seem like it actually is genz posting on those subs, so people like you can argue that genz agrees with them."
PoliticalCompassMemes,fejiciz,t1_fejd7vv,1579175548.0,You can still be older than a Gen z and post on subs made for Gen z.
JusticeServed,fei1tva,t1_fehxr6u,1579128432.0,Animals can live in factory farms for longer than a year.

dogelore,fegdmru,t1_feg5to4,1579088982.0,Not like they have some of the best tools for war in the world and some of them don’t even require someone to be in danger while using them...
vegancirclejerk,fefl8r3,t3_eot2pq,1579058713.0,Vro just go get some muscle injections it’s not your diet bro please
WTF,feavecu,t1_feahh3f,1578952553.0,Eat plants. No brains or anything and you can get all of your nutrients while being healthier.
PoliticalCompassMemes,fdyv2yk,t1_fdxpqzk,1578783919.0,"It’s not nearly as bad as factory farming but apparently chickens and birds have a hard time lying eggs, so since we bred them to do it constantly it’s pretty painful."
vegan,fdxsv4l,t1_fdxq7tw,1578772530.0,"People who eat meat contribute to a huge amount of suffering in this world, not everyone will bow down to the current quota."
PoliticalCompassMemes,fdt45tu,t1_fdt25bm,1578711679.0,Ok... you’re allowed to do those things and nobody was going to stop you.
PoliticalCompassMemes,fdovfpa,t1_fdocpmy,1578613771.0,"Pitbulllover, why should we hate PETA?"

PoliticalCompassMemes,fdk6g0m,t1_fdk68ul,1578497151.0,Grilling eggs
worldnews,fdj6o3m,t1_fdi64fd,1578459952.0,Why is this always the first response. Like I wonder what causes people like you to tell people to kill themselves when they just try and say something.
facepalm,fdh9z3g,t1_fdh8uab,1578418575.0,It really wouldn’t help? At all? I’m pretty sure it would.
facepalm,fdh9tcb,t1_fdh8ry6,1578418478.0,Much more likely than one would assume. Dogs on the street won’t be taken in if there’s no more space and it’s dangerous for them and us to leave them there. It’s extremely sad.
facepalm,fdh7unz,t1_fdh6mev,1578417267.0,"Stop going in circles. If you read back I said animals are killed in other countries. If we stopped breeding dogs that would help the problem, LIKE I SAID!!!! 

I meant I’m sure these no pets people would help the cause if global trends were changing. They aren’t, so they aren’t doing anything yet."
facepalm,fdh63cj,t1_fdh57u9,1578416174.0,We don’t kill wild cats or dogs now. The end goal is to not have pets but if sacrifices have to be made along the way then I’m sure these people would help these animals. If global trends were changing I’m sure they would help.
facepalm,fdh4urk,t1_fdh47z5,1578415416.0,"1: Humans can interact with other humans? If someone can’t get what they need from that then that’s another whole topic.
 
2: Nobody is chucking them out into the wild nor will there be mass killings of animals. While some countries without the proper resources for roaming packs have to do that, why did you even assume I meant that? You can just stop breeding them so it eventually stops.

3: cats are huge problems to local resources. This reinforces my argument about not making anymore cats. If the problem is happening while we continue to breed cats then it won’t go away after we stop breeding them but it may make it easier."
facepalm,fdh3p7r,t1_fdh385x,1578414706.0,"1: We don’t need pets

2: They are bred for us. They are made for our use now. The cavemen finding them out in the wilderness was different.

3: If the cats are bred they eat meat. Of course the wild ones will continue to do it but there won’t be a larger need for the pets."
facepalm,fdh2k5m,t1_fdh27da,1578414003.0,"Yeah I agree on your first part. It was a terrible act that they committed. I don’t really care about the shitshow that happened afterwards, companies get away with illegal things all the time and just ignore complaints. Of course that does not absolve PETA and it was a terrible action.



What I said applies to pets too. We are human and of course it is nice to have animals around but we are still using them for ourselves. Some people also don’t like that pets like cats require meat to feed."
facepalm,fdh1tnc,t1_fdh1afd,1578413542.0,"That was a specific horrible case. Sometimes huge mistakes like those happen.

Some people believe we should stop using animals for ourselves. Everything animals used to be needed for are replaced with machines now, maybe besides comfort animals. Some people believe we should be humans and only humans and not use other animals for our own use anymore."
facepalm,fdh1lzx,t1_fdh1ddx,1578413407.0,"You can’t just “make” more resources. You take in what you can take in. When the shelter gets filled the options are the street or another shelter. Sometimes the animals end up in a kill shelter due to there being no where else. A true animal lover would adopt and save a animal from death, or wouldn’t have a pet in the first place so that dilemma wouldn’t matter"
facepalm,fdh1cm8,t1_fdh0w9j,1578413244.0,"Most things I’ve read seem to say they can survive well. 

(I don’t know how it is on desktop, I’m on mobile) Just to have a source I’ll use this one: https://vetnutrition.tufts.edu/2016/07/vegan-dogs-a-healthy-lifestyle-or-going-against-nature/"
facepalm,fdh02sl,t1_fdgz3oy,1578412434.0,"So where were the ones who needed to be put down in the “no-kill shelters” sent to? If they’re not able to put them down, who does? What happens when they run out of space?"
facepalm,fdgzrtu,t1_fdgyl22,1578412239.0,"It is a little dumb to say cats can survive on only plants but that doesn’t compromise the whole group. PETA has also said that we shouldn’t own pets in the first place. I can’t find anything saying dogs can’t survive on only plants. 

No I don’t support killing people on food stamps. People on food stamps can get back on their feet, unlike a abundance of dogs who can actually not be supported, or a terminally ill dog. Dying by being put down instead of freezing or starving to death is much better."
facepalm,fdgy39p,t1_fdgxq9o,1578411154.0,"Certain pets can eat plants. Dogs are omnivores, did you know that? Also if they can’t support the animals in their shelters you should give them a dignified death instead of starving or dying on the street due to lack of resources. Some shelters refuse to kill the animals so PETA ends up having to put them down. Redditor moment"
vegancirclejerk,fdgxwh0,t1_fdgkvff,1578411026.0,If something is not bred anymore that version of the sheep will die out. But concepts like suffering and exploitation not being possible when something is not alive is too abstract to redditors.

facepalm,fdgxm8a,t1_fdgov8e,1578410829.0,Facepalm for whole fucking thread.
facepalm,fdgxgbx,t1_fdgvnm2,1578410716.0,How? Seriously show me how and don’t just be on the hate train. I don’t care if you manage to find stuff that goes against your claim if you accept it.
PoliticalCompassMemes,fdgneak,t1_fdgke3l,1578403086.0,I mean them being a vegan in the first place is leaps and bounds ahead of anyone else. I don’t know why they would disagree with you though.
PoliticalCompassMemes,fdfr7g5,t1_fdffmev,1578368232.0,lol of course it would be a centrist
PoliticalCompassMemes,fdfqrkr,t1_fdfmk7r,1578367936.0,Pointing out one spot on the compass and having them disagree with whatever the topic of the meme is. They often disagree because the OP doesn’t like them though.
PoliticalCompassMemes,fdd664a,t1_fdd5wk2,1578296518.0,No... You can listen to the (((bible)) all you want but you really have to dig deeper to find the real story (((Terpomo11)))...
