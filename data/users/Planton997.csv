Commission free trades and possibly fractional shares will let you have at least a tiny amount of cash on the line. Ideally you wouldn’t have to lose $20 or $50 or whatever to learn lessons but on the other hand you won’t learn anything at all if you don’t take it seriously."
YouShouldKnow,ff9rbsv,t1_ff9laui,1579719387.0,You probably had them deduct their fees from your tax refund and then send you what’s left. Also there’s another fee for using that payment option but don’t worry they’ll just deduct that too
YouShouldKnow,ff9qrei,t1_ff9e773,1579718936.0,"I did last year, it was great. Overall spent nothing for federal and like $15 bucks for state taxes which I’m cool with. For reference, I don’t have any investment properties, companies, and no capital gains to report so that made it simpler, though I am above the income cap for free filing. If you’ve been getting scammed by TurboTax and want to ditch them, you’ll need to know your AGI from last year to file this year’s taxes. TurboTax knows this and will try to trick you into paying them to tell you your AGI. You can go to the irs.gov website, fill in some info, and they’ll hook you up with your AGI in about a day or two for free.

I asked TurboTax over the phone how I could get my AGI and surprise surprise they didn’t mention I could just get it from the irs website easily and free."
medizzy,ff3o9os,t3_er5p8z,1579545311.0,"Almost certainly nerve related - probably just pinched/stretched/whatever. I lost the use of my left trapezius following a surgery on my right shoulder. Turns out they use a pretty medieval looking rope and winch to yank your arm while doing the surgery. The surgeons best guess was that however I happened to be strapped to the table must have tweaked a nerve in my neck. It was weird watching the muscle atrophy for the next 4 months or so. 

Basically there isn’t much to do. A nerve conduction test will likely only tell you what you already know. Nerves and the thin layer of super important fat that surround them are sensitive and slow to recover. My issue resolved itself in about 6 months and I’ve heard some reports of even longer. A doctor would most likely say to give it a few months. I’m assuming he can still use his calf so the motor nerves are okay, it’s just a sensory nerve issue which isn’t a huge rush. Obv if he’s like diabetic or otherwise at risk for foot issues he’ll want to be on the lookout since he may not feel a problem"
trashy,fer87i6,t1_fepyrdn,1579351008.0,"That must work both ways then. You should have told the school district that since they have no control over what happens on the bus and apparently no authority there, you’ll just be sending your son to school with a baseball bat to protect himself. They would probably change their tune very quickly."
YouShouldKnow,fenbi3b,t1_fel0yi8,1579281133.0,"I was under the impression that it applies strictly to unsolicited goods, but the goods are no longer technically considered “unsolicited” if you’ve ordered *something* from the company. Maybe my lawyer buddy misinterpreted it or was erring on the side of caution"
YouShouldKnow,fek5jqp,t1_fej8x0t,1579193061.0,"This isn’t true. The federal law at play here was largely created to stop sketchy companies from sending products to random people along with a bill demanding payment. That used to be a thing. If a company sends you a product accidentally, or too many of the product you ordered, you’re legally obligated to make reasonable efforts to return it. Typically the company either doesn’t care and just writes it off.. or if it’s too valuable to write off they’ll arrange for a shipping company to do an at home pick up. Your obligation would be to leave it somewhere accessible to pick up. You wouldn’t have to, for example, drive out of your way to bring it to the post office and certainly you wouldn’t have to cover shipping costs.

This happened to me with a $5,000 piece of equipment. I ordered a power cable and they sent a power cable + a whole new unit. Due to the amount at stake and my dislike of the company, I reached out for legal advice and yeah.. the law unfortunately isn’t as simple as “oh you shipped it to me so it’s mine now”"

LifeProTips,fcue47s,t3_eixzz4,1577978802.0,"If they ask multiple times how fast you think you were going, there’s a chance that their equipment didn’t register your speed. A cop pulled me on my motorcycle for speeding and he kept pressing me to say a number. I never did and after 5 minutes sitting in his car he came back and actually told me his radar or whatever didn’t get me and I was free to go. I’m not sure if me simply saying “I think I was going xx mph” would have been enough to write a ticket but based on how pissy he got I’d guess it is"
LifeProTips,fcn8dl8,t1_fcmqdz2,1577805915.0,"Some are really chill and just give people reminders about certain things (don’t leave trash cans by the road for too long, hey you can’t paint your house bright pink it’s gotta match, your grass hasn’t been cut in weeks you gotta take care of that, etc). My HOA is reasonable about it and if you don’t take care of the issue in like a week or whatever they give you a $25 fine lol. If you ask for more time they’ll almost always give it to you.

Then there are shitty HOAs that go around with cameras on long poles to peer onto your second floor balcony to see if you have any potted plants out there so they can hit you with a ridiculous fine. Or fine you for parking in your own driveway. Yeah definitely do some research on the HOA and go ask the neighbors how it is before moving"

She had apparently already been disarmed so that’s good, and the guard was (successfully) removing her from the premises. Not everything has to be done tactically perfect and up to your iamverybadass standards. If I’m deadlifting at the gym I try to use proper form. But if I’m just bending down to pick up a pen off the ground, I don’t care if I don’t use “proper” form. Perhaps the guard saw her as such a non-threat that he didn’t even need to bother doing things up to your standards. “Control tactics and violence” lmao. Hit me with some Sun Tzu quotes next fam.
