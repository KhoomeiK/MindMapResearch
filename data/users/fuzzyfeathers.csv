AustralianCattleDog,ff1t59m,t3_eqxvqf,1579485601.0,I'm a week in with my new puppy and its weird he doesn't cry or cause issue when I leave for work but if I'm home and he can't get to me that is a whole other issue. I've never had an anxious dog so this the constant whining is very new to me.

dogs,fcw522k,t1_fcvabpa,1578017323.0,Most of these dogs that are free roaming are highly mixed breeds. The mixing waters down all the extreme traits of purebred dogs which means you get an all around good dog. Mine is extremely easy to train and very loving.

veterinaryprofession,fbmkpep,t3_edytdz,1576985242.0,I have no clue about processed hides but scalpels dull quickly so for fresh hides a nice sharp postmortem knife probably would be best for large animals. otherwise a #10  blade for thin skin and scissors for precise cuts.
