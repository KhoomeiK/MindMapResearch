I do think though that friends and husbands are a little different, at least to your friends. To them you are choosing other friends over them, which they see as equivalent to themselves on the social hierarchy, and that’s what they’re upset.

I have oily lids and my skin’s yellow undertone changes a lot of eyeshadow shades (ex. blue shows up as green). The shadows were always under blended or over blended. Or I thought it looked great...and then saw myself in neutral daylight. 

After I started using a pigmented eyeshadow primer, suddenly eyeshadow became so much easier! It soaked up a lot of the oils on my lids and corrected the pigment issues. I got smaller eye brushes that fit my small lids so I’m better able to control where the product goes. I also invested in a smart mirror with magnifying features and led lighting that mimics daylight, and I cannot stress how important lighting is so you can actually see what you’re doing.

AmItheAsshole,ffqp67w,t1_ffqot6y,1580140384.0,Well roommates are different anyway. You’re not expecting to combine your life in the same way two people dating are.

My personal opinion on this is if you need to lower your quality of life in any way to save money for this palette, it’s not worth it. If you have disposable income and just deciding if you want to get one PMG palette or three ABH ones, this would be a good purchase because the quality is there."
AmItheAsshole,ffqllea,t1_ffqk588,1580137879.0,"Well roommates you would expect them to be on similar income levels, but not everyone limits their dating to people from a similar income level. 

It’s about the two people who start dating. Some people will insist on splitting everything equally, even if they’re the one earning less. Some people prefer to pay more even as friends, they’re just more comfortable being the person that gets the bills. Some people will try to take advantage however they can. Some people might want to pay their fair share but have other obligations, such as a sick family member or insane student loans. The important thing is to be compatible; any financial arrangement is ok as long as both people are ok with it. 

For example, it wouldn’t be wrong of my husband to insist on an equal split of expenses, but then I might’ve decided to end the relationship or not move in together so I can have the disposable income to enjoy my 20’s.

My then-bf-now-husband is nine years older than me and we moved in together when I was 25. It would be unreasonable to expect a 25 year old’s income to be the same as a 34 year old’s, regardless of gender. Would it really be fair for me to contribute 80% of my income and him 30% of his so that we would contribute the same amount? I don’t think so.

It’s really about communication. My husband understood that he was dating someone much younger and he would have to contribute more until my income caught up. I understood that I would have to contribute more as my earnings increased. It was what we needed to do to make our relationship work.

AmItheAsshole,ffjn9qc,t1_ffiezsc,1580002185.0,"Another crier here. I can’t help that my eyes well up whenever I get emotional, but I have clearly told my SO that it shouldn’t matter in an argument and to just ignore it. 

Crying every time you don’t get your way is something a child does, not an adult."
Sephora,ffg0d2e,t3_etd6hy,1579895726.0,I got this too! Definitely not signing up...they think we’re stupid and can’t do the math? 2500 pts for the $100 gift card but they’re going to give us $10 “beauty insider cash” for 500 pts???
beauty,ff86hrv,t3_es0j0h,1579667356.0,"In my experience, the people who are against skincare and makeup are the ones who don’t do it themselves...and it shows. The mindset is, if they don’t do it, then it can’t possibly be good.

Ignore her. Not everyone cares about how they look and that’s fine, but nothing gives them the right to tell other people they shouldn’t care either."
MUAontheCheap,ff23a0q,t3_eqybwu,1579492624.0,"Def makes it more likely I’ll buy! It’s never on sale at target, but there’s always tons of deals at ULTA!"
ChoosingBeggars,ff0z8pw,t3_eqs8st,1579473742.0,This is that 12 year old who’s used to saying “I’m only 12 so...” and has continued using it without realizing that at 20 you really should be able to avoid $5 for a profile picture.
Makeup,few2iwv,t1_feu1qi8,1579404578.0,I’ve always liked the Sephora one and it works the same as the beauty blender soap.
Makeup,few1ryx,t3_eqnpt6,1579404269.0,Mac fix plus is a classic! I have oily skin and this is one of the few “glow” mists that I can use without melting off my makeup.
MUAontheCheap,few1l5l,t1_festerl,1579404178.0,"It works, but the cost of the tool isn’t what’s going to set you back, it’s the razors. They’re supposed to be one use; I have used them twice before and it’s nowhere near as good of a shave the second time."
MUAontheCheap,few0pm0,t3_eqq7r2,1579403814.0,It would have to be NARS. I can easily do a full face with all the products I have from them! They have ever few dud products with quite a few cult favorites.
MUAontheCheap,fevy5n4,t3_eqk5mk,1579403026.0,I just bought a bunch of stuff so I’d have 2000 points to use with this!
