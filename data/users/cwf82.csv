Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,ffpbtz2,t1_ffpbf4h,1580091145.0,"The sentence employs three distinct meanings of the word buffalo:

- as a proper noun to refer to a specific place named Buffalo, the city of Buffalo, NY, being the most notable;

- as a verb (uncommon in regular usage) to buffalo, meaning ""to bully, harass, or intimidate"" or ""to baffle""; and

- as a noun to refer to the animal, bison (often called buffalo in North America). The plural is also buffalo.

An expanded form of the sentence which preserves the original word order is: ""**Buffalo bison, that other Buffalo bison bully, also bully Buffalo bison.**"""

There is little to no repetition of characters, that, even maximizing the amount of letters/sounds you stuff into your orthography, there is bound to be repetition, so that rules out abjads, (regular and syllabic) alphabets, and abugidas. Even with logographic systems, there is bound to be some kind of system or repetition.

My guess is this is just someone messing around and making it look cryptic and mysterious. Just kind of letting the pen doodle in the vague shape of letters."

AskReddit,fenm6nf,t1_fen21mu,1579287661.0,"If you don't go to try to be a kid again, you might be surprised! First, don't go during the hot season. I've found the best time to go is October. That's when the weather is bearable (high 70s), not crazy humid, and they have events going on. 

All of the Halloween stuff is going on, and if you grab one of the tickets to a Halloween event, you can do a couple things: go around and trick or treat and get a shit ton of candy (they drop handfuls in at each station) and/or go round robin on several rides, because all the families with kids are trick or treating.

Second, the Food and Wine Fest is going on at Epcot. Get foods and drinks from around the world. Dozens of different countries, each with several dishes and usually booze. Drink your way around the world. Literally. Plus, since there is transportation to and from, you can have as much fun as you want, without having to worry about driving. Just keep up with drinking water, though. Hungover Disney is decidedly less fun.

The secret to Disney is planning. If you just walk around, willy nilly, and just pop in a line whenever, you're gonna wait and have a bad time. If you know what you are doing, though, the magic is just as awesome for adults.
