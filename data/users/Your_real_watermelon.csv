Them forcing that movies release without all parties OKAY would be a terrible PR move. Paul Walker was only in F&F 7 because his family allowed him to be, so they could give his character a proper send off. Hollywood is scum but there’s still legalities and politics involved."

When someone we have a connection too passes a way we feel sad. If people we have no connection to emotionally pass away we don’t care, we will be sympathetic but not sad. I don’t get why people say this like it’s wrong for people to be sad about a celebrity people felt like they knew this person, THATS why they’re sad."

My shovels have wooden handles and I’ve lived in many places in Canada and I can assure you it’s -40 here quite a few times a year. We shovel snow here and clear off our cars the same as always.

Your arguing points are based on your preferences. 65-80 sounds nonsensical to me and 18.333 is to cold for day drinking in my opinion. The Metric system is the superior system, why the fuck would we switch everywhere to Kelvin instead of just switching the United States to Celsius. The only two other countries that don’t use the metric system are Myanmar, and Liberia."

If you’re more interested in Canada though I suggest Northern Alberta cities mostly as Alberta is a great province to live in financially. You’ll get your -40 and the summers are +35."

aww,ffegnm8,t1_ffe8v5x,1579847270.0,People say this without even knowing what they’re talking about. We can’t even get their strain of Chlamydia (easily). They eat there mother’s poop to get there undeveloped digestive system ready as cubs. They eat eucalyptus leaves because they don’t get down from their trees often due to predators so the Eucalyptus leaves act as their source of hydration and nutrients. They can notice the leaves when off the branch after becoming aware of it most of them live their whole lives only getting down from a tree to move to another so they only experience the leaves in that way.
EarthPorn,ffeg5m6,t1_ffef7f6,1579846726.0,"Well none of them are going to give you -40 on the reg. For 10 months out of the year it’s very cold definitely -10 on the reg, but you’ll get plenty of -40 days sprinkled in. As for recommendations any city in Northern British Columbia or Alberta is beautiful but assuming you’re from the US, it would be much easier for you to go to Anchorage Alaska."
