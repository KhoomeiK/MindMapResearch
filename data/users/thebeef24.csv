SubredditDrama,ffgowm8,t1_fffiv0q,1579911351.0,"I know one guy like this in real life. What he leaves out is that he lost touch with his liberal friends when he got married and gradually got pulled into the world of his Bible-thumping, Confederate reenactor family."

We also saw a lot of more casual civilian clothing on both shows, and to a lesser degree on Voyager. Hardly any of it looks characteristically 20th century.

Edit: ENT made a point of bringing in more 20th century clothing, since it was set so much closer to the present day."

startrek,ffe32bv,t3_esyaco,1579835412.0,"My grandfather looked very much like Picard and in many ways he *was* like him. He was a thinker and liked to encourage people to ask why things are, but he also had deeply set views on right and wrong. My grandfather developed Alzheimer's when I was around 12 (I'm 32 now) and over the next 10 years much of him was stripped away. Every time I see Picard, though, I see him. To the point, maybe, that I don't quite always remember where one stops and the other begins.

Picard wore a flat cap in this episode. My grandfather wore one every day."

AskScienceFiction,ff3sssx,t1_ff3r612,1579548078.0,"Star Wars has repulsorlifts (antigravity). They keep the snowspeeder floating and would do same for the cargo, assuming it's also fitted with repulsorlifts.

The real problem is braking. With just a cable and no significant friction, coming to a stop in the speeder is just going to make the cargo slam into you. They'd have to have something to bring the cargo to a stop on command."
MovieDetails,ff0668s,t1_feysqse,1579465642.0,"Of all the areas to fault the prequels, I don't think that's one of them. Obi-Wan's style when he's young is reckless, later it becomes much more reserved and precise. Anakin is reckless and cocky throughout. Dooku shows finesse (although I do think they should have gone with a more obviously fencing-based style) and Windu shows control followed by quick and decisive violence. 

And Yoda shows his deep, abiding love for cocaine. Okay, yeah, they kind of dropped that one."

I'm sure part of why most of us poop so long is we're messing around on our phones, but we also sometimes have industrial-sized poops that take forever. Although maybe that's just me."
