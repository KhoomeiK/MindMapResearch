TrueFilm,ff9ol89,t1_ff6mtia,1579717371.0,"Part of me doubts that Howard would’ve made the payment. He could’ve easily paid back his FIL after KG pays him for the Opal, but he manically bet all the money instead. He was so far gone and hopelessly addicted to gambling, he would’ve fucked Arno over again, somehow. The goons were chasing Howard so long, they were fed up with him and Arno. The only way to ensure they got paid was to loot the store."
bipolar,ff33eb8,t1_ff2xp0w,1579532653.0,"Agreed. It may be a helpful notion for some folks, but it is framed in a pretty negative way. A lot of bipolar folks feel alone enough as it is - it seems a bit nihilist and sad to just resign to “no one cares about me at all.”

That being said, this way of thinking does help me a little bit when it comes to being trans. If I tell myself it’s just my paranoia, not everyone is staring at me/disgusted at me/ most people don’t care - I actually find that very comforting. But sadly it’s not always the case, and they ARE staring and being assholes to me. Not the majority though."
TrueCrime,feit6hf,t1_feidl2r,1579146560.0,I’m convinced it was George Hodel.
bipolar,fe4adsr,t3_enn2xv,1578857313.0,Happy for you! It’s been 4 months since I last punched myself in the head or smashed it against a wall. Yay me
UnresolvedMysteries,fdvtz8s,t1_fdvtar0,1578751474.0,"Hard to forget that, yes :( such a disturbing story. Fucked up what Tamar did to her kids too and the whole cycle of abuse. It’s wild how much he got away with because of his wealth / social standing ugh"
UnresolvedMysteries,fdtbebi,t1_fdsmy7d,1578714382.0,Have you listened to The Root of Evil podcast? I’m convinced that George Hodel was the killer. He killed his secretary and was suspected to have murdered women in the Philippines too. There was a woman found bisected like the Black dahlia in Manila around the time he lived there.
bipolar,fdosp6z,t1_fdnuz0b,1578612012.0,Me too! I eat small amounts all day and it really helps.
AskReddit,fdlpe7r,t3_elssvy,1578529328.0,I thought that the pharmacist was making my medicine behind the counter while I was waiting... I only discovered this was not the case a couple years ago.
careerguidance,fdl49yz,t1_fdl1utr,1578516796.0,"You’re right - they might’ve just been weird isolated situations. I’ve never disclosed mental health stuff in an interview, only to supervisors or HR once employed. Thanks so much for your response."
relationship_advice,fddw71t,t1_fddux3i,1578325477.0,Right? That’s so bizarre to me. A lot of tech start ups I’ve encountered strongly encourage fitness. I know so many programmers who are hardcore cyclists or really into weightlifting or MMA. What a strange assumption to make.
AskReddit,fcrn2jg,t1_fcqmvvi,1577903963.0,"This is why my partner and I work - we’re both kind of flaky (working on that) and really value our alone time. There’s been so many times where one of us has been like “hey babe, I’d love to see you but I think I need to recharge and be alone tonight.” We have never had a single argument about changing plans or “bailing” on each other. It feels really good to not have someone be demanding and entitled to my time. We’re together when we wanna be."
AskReddit,fcmzsva,t1_fcmhdm0,1577799003.0,Wow I never knew other people did this... when I was a kid I had an irrational fear of having my dominant hand chopped off /losing a limb in general. I spent a few summers obsessively training myself to be proficient with my left hand. Now I’m almost completely ambidextrous!
bipolar,fc97a1y,t3_egpvk3,1577548166.0,"Not on abilify, but I’ve been having major sleep issues being on lamotrigine and depo provera ... I’ll jolt awake obscenely early and then have racing thoughts and panic until I’m so exhausted I cry. Makes work unbearable because I’m ALWAYS tired and weak."
FragileWhiteRedditor,fc970hl,t1_fc929jc,1577548040.0,"I don’t think it’s necessarily productive either to blame it on ignorance, lack of intelligence, wealth etc. There are definitely lots of wealthy and educated people that support Trump. Your points on propaganda are absolutely valid - but it’s way too easy to be like “those ignorant, brainwashed lower class folks are to blame!” (I know you didn’t mention class specifically, but it’s relevant here, so I’m mentioning it). Don’t let rich educated people off the hook that easy. They have a BIG hand in this shit too."

serialkillers,fc92ohr,t1_fc6pygc,1577546052.0,"No, it’s a different podcast. The Root of Evil is a shorter series about the Hodel family, and their grandfather /father as the suspected Black Dahlia murderer. Super compelling and disturbing - I’m convinced it was George Hodel now."
serialkillers,fc64hi2,t1_fc5sja2,1577472071.0,I dont mind crime junkie because they cover some interesting cases - I just find Hannah and suruthi/  Mike and Gibby (true crime all the time) are way more engaging and have the best banter. If you haven’t already - I highly recommend you check out “The Root of Evil”. Super interesting
serialkillers,fc5kjns,t1_fc2v0wi,1577460080.0,Me too! That’s why I always make a point to mention it whenever I hear people talking about true crime podcasts. Hannah and suruthi are by far the most charming and nice to listen to imo. More people need to listen to Redhanded!
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fbutj4a,t1_fbusvu1,1577120125.0,"Yes to Janet, hell no to Jen. If she truly loved Bentley her and his dad wouldn’t enable him to be a piece of shit. “Kind of about enabler” is an understatement. Unless you also grew up with a drug addict absentee dad with grandparents who just let it happen - I don’t expect you to get it. I wish my grandparents cut my dad off - maybe it would’ve given him some consequences for his actions instead of getting to be a crackhead that fucked me up."
