If I actually do have an undiscovered haplogroup, I was the science would hurry up. I was more excited to learn about my haplogroup than my actual admixture. 

Thanks for all your help! I was a little lost reading Lick’s results, and you helped a lot!"
23andme,ffe0bnf,t1_ffdzr62,1579833407.0,"If that Scandinavian DNA is accurate, which I’m skeptical about, maybe it your Spanish ancestor contributed it."
23andme,ffdzo7j,t1_ffdzfwq,1579832938.0,"Ohhhh I didn’t know that.

Thanks for that info!"
23andme,ffdzb00,t1_ffdyuhz,1579832670.0,"Thanks! I was kind of wondering if that could explain it. I also know that there results rely on people accurately reporting where their ancestors/grandparents come from, and I can imagine people giving incorrect information because they were mistaken or because NPE."
23andme,ffdyvp7,t1_ffdwpz6,1579832363.0,I hope it gets more accurate as well.
23andme,ffdypf7,t1_ffdy1o0,1579832238.0,That’s an interesting idea!
23andme,ffdynsx,t1_ffdy3fv,1579832204.0,Did you have any Spanish?

My results said:

1) H

... a lot of stuff...

**Imperfect match**. Your results contained differences with this haplogroup.

This one was my closest match, and it only had 3 markers that matched, 3 that were untested, and 16 that were extra. 

2) H100

... a lot of stuff...

**Imperfect match**. Your results contained differences with this haplogroup.

And the results continue like this for the rest of the H subclades.

So I guess my haplogroup hasn’t been identified yet. Is that what it sounds like to you?"
MadeMeSmile,ffduxz6,t1_ffdqz41,1579829559.0,Me too :-|
23andme,ffduj4q,t3_et2mic,1579829265.0,"My next question, how accurate/large is 23andMe’s Scandinavian DNA database?

As far as I know, I have no Scandinavian ancestry aside from some Scottish ancestors who descended from Vikings who invaded Scotland. It seems unlikely that the Vikings are responsible for my Scandinavian results. 

I mentioned in my novel-length post above that my maternal grandfather’s results were a little more difficult to track. The truth is, some of his ancestors just appeared in America. Their names did not appear on any shipping manifests and they never went through the trouble of becoming citizens (though they claimed to be citizens on the census). They had German names and claimed to be from Germany, but one of my cousins paid genealogists in both the US and Germany to help her research them and neither found any evidence of our ancestors having been in Germany or anyone with their names as having sailed to the US or having become citizens. 

I just took it for granted that they actually were German because why would they lie about that? But I suppose it’s possible they were from a Scandinavian country or they were from Germany but ethnically Scandinavian. That still seems... weird and not likely. 

So is it possible that 23andMe has misidentified DNA from another region as Scandinavian?"
23andme,ffdt8y2,t3_et2mic,1579828353.0,"I have actually been researching my family history for a few years now, and I have been able to trace my family back at least 8 generations on every branch except my maternal grandfather’s side (I’ll put a pin in that for now).

I used the same process genealogists used to calculate my ancestry composition (I.e. by going back to each of my 4x great grandparents, of which everyone has 64, and attributing 1.5% of my ancestry to each). From that I estimated that I am:


5/16 English
1/16 Scottish
1/8 Czech
1/16 German from East Prussia
7/16 German

I put my ancestry from East Prussia in a separate category from German, because my ancestors were from Konigsberg, which was right between Poland and Lithuania, so geographically, it’s in Eastern Europe.

Based on my Czech and Prussian ancestry, my results should be about 18.75% Eastern European. I understand that after WWII everyone from Konigsberg was expelled to Germany and that maybe their descendants identified their ancestors as having been from Germany to 23andMe, so I can understand why that DNA might be miscategorised as German. That still leaves roughly 12.5% Eastern European DNA from my Czech ancestors. 

I know how much actual DNA you get from each ancestor can vary, but a result of 3% Eastern European DNA when 12.5% of my ancestors were Czech is a significant drop. So I’m wondering how accurate Eastern European results are from 23andMe and how likely it is that some of that DNA is misattributed to Northwestern Europe or even just categorized as broadly European because 23andMe’s sample from Eastern Europe is so small."
23andme,ffaoy7p,t3_esh3dy,1579741078.0,"Based on my genealogy research, I was expecting to get about 15% Eastern European  with about 9% of that coming from my Czech ancestors. My results only showed about 5% Eastern European, but it didn’t specify the region. I don’t know how extensive 23andMe’s reference group for the Czech Republic/Slovakia/Ukraine is. My results might not point to a specific Eastern European country or city because the percentage in my DNA is so low or it could be because of their reference group. 

I will say that the regions specified in my French/German and UK/Irish results were just about spot on."
politics,ff8yvm6,t1_ff8wlry,1579700432.0,I suspect it would blow your colleagues’ minds to know that reciprocal discovery is a thing and there are circumstances in which defense attorneys have to turn over physical evidence in their possession or risk being charged with obstruction.
AmItheAsshole,ff8uln1,t1_ff8gms0,1579696625.0,"Well, there have been a number of vegans/vegetarians in this thread explaining they either don’t like the taste/smell of meat or they are repulsed by the thought of eating something that is covered in meat grease/juice. Those seem “valid” reasons to me. Or, you know, people get to choose what to put in their body and not wanting to put something in your body for whatever reason is just as “valid” as not wanting to put something in your body because someone from thousands of years ago said it was sinful."
