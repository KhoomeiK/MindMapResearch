Tried all the usual drugs but no joy. Now, over 5 years later, the neuropathy is the same and basically I've been told it will likely never change. But there's actually some positive info I can relay: you learn to adapt and deal with the reality no matter how unpleasant and uncomfortable. I found a hot tub soak will temporarily relieve the discomfort. I've learned some mental tricks help, avoiding too much booze is a good idea and exercise, which I thought would be impossible, is actually the best thing. So, basically, no matter how grim it looks now, you'll find your way and it's one heck of a lot better than the alternative! Good luck friend."

Both are non-running rust buckets on flat tires. But I think they may have a little value as parts cars or even restorations for someone who knows cars (obviously not us.) Questions: how to determine a selling price and where to go/post to sell them? We have absolutely no experience in this type of thing. All suggestions welcome!"
