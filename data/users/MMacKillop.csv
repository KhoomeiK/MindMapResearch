Sallet+Bever. Think Robocop helmet, kinda, but with a separate peice for the neck and lower face. Some of them have really intricate articulation for the neck, and the bever can also have a hinge to drop the topmost section down to open up the mouth area. There are a few different styles and levels of articulation for the visor, too. Unlike the Armet, it isn't a super close fit for the head/neck/face, and the helm part is essentially held on by a chin strap, which both makes it less sturdy than an armet (I suppose a really hard hit could break the strap and knock it off?), but also more versatile since you can take the whole top part off when not in danger. Sallets are my own favorite, over all.

Add to that that you need to run around to the handful of stores trying to find stock of the rare decent strain. Then, you find that it was packaged months, or years, ago. Or, it's at the bottom range of the possible THC range, so not even worth buying. Never mind ordering online; that's a complete crapshoot and there's no way to know what you'll get. 

Or, miracle of miracles, you find a decent strain, relatively freshly packaged, in stock, with a good strong THC level. You get home, pop it open, and...despite the date, it's dry as fuck, little bits and weed dust. Sticks, leaves. Smells like hay, like most LP weed. Tastes like grass smells if vaped, very harsh and fast-burning if smoked.

I do not know what the actual current draw is like, and I don't know if it's a constant draw, or more at the start to get it up to temp. I doubt that it's 30A though, since they would have had to provide batteries that are actually rated for 30A, which the HB2s, or even the HG2s, 25Rs, or VTC5As are not even rated for. They're all 20A constant draw cells.  

Anyways, you can run normal vape batteries in it. I use HG2s, and they're good for about 8-9 ""uses"" at 210C (the included batteries are good for 6-7 uses). An external charger, and a spare set of batteries besides the ones that comes with it are a must. Depending on how frequently you use it, maybe even a 3rd set. I've been curious to get a set of proper 30A batteries just to see if a higher continous A rating gets better battery life, or if the extra amperage would just be wasted.

Did you do 3-4 burn-offs before using weed in it? Also, try the glass versus the plastic. The plastic one does indeed impart a plastic-ish taste, but the glass one is better. The vapour will be a bit hot, regardless, since it's such a short path between the weed and your mouth. Even better would be to get one of the glass stems for the Solo (which fit into the rubbery bit under either mouthpiece), which you then just plug the chamber with. Cools the vapour quite a bit.

The other commenter is correct that a light to medium pack is ideal in the Tera, with a relatively fine grind. You can also remove the bottom screen when using the capsules, which improves airflow to the weed quite a bit. Depending on how fine you grind (and thus how easily weed bits could escape the capsule), you might be able to get away with removing the top screen, too. That's how I roll, anyways, and I couldn't be happier than with the Tera.

Worst case, contact Boundless. Contacting someone like u/Eric_boundlessvapes usually nets better results than their general customer service email.

Maybe it's the ""part"" of the high that you appreciate more comes from some of the compounds you don't get from vaporization. I know that smoking, for me, has a much deeper relaxation/sleepy effect, but in my case the difference isn't significant enough to cancel the advantages of vape vs. smoke. 

With any luck, now that it's legal here, and hopefully everywhere sooner rather than later, some research can go into this sort of thing so that we can get the best from our buds."
CanadianMOMs,ff1zore,t1_ff1yum1,1579489956.0,"Agreed that the Dynavap is a one hitter that might suit OP's need, but I don't know about how efficient it is comparatively, which is why I didn't really consider it as a suggestion. I also don't use one hitters, myself, so it's hard for me to advise on that basis any more than the really general stuff I tried to convey. 

I suppose I was also trying to give the OP a bit of an anchor to base himself on if he does get inundated with Dyna suggestions. Because it's so cheap, it can be easy to just buy one based on so many suggestions without considering exactly what it is and how it works. If OP does go the vaping route, I really just hope he takes his time to get it right. Better that than he go back to smoking!"
CanadianMOMs,ff1szau,t3_er5nom,1579485498.0,"I can't claim that it will be the same for everyone, but vaping dry herb for me has cut my consumption down to about 40% of what it was when I smoked. Instead of waiting for each paycheck to pick up a new oz, I can just buy one a month, and always have tons of leftovers from previous purchases by the time I restock. 

The trick was getting a good vape. I tried starting with a small cheap battery vape, and my consumption hardly dropped at all. I was also not satisfied with the high, and would still smoke some from time to time. I upgraded to an Arizer Extreme Q, and with the bags, got higher than I had in years. I found the vapour harsh, though, and actually less tasty than with the cheapo vape. Turns out the vapour goes stale pretty quickly, and I just wasn't able to take it in fast enough. 

If you're ripping through an oz every 10 days, you might have the lungs to handle those bags. If so, and if a desktop unit (so not portable) suits your needs, the Extreme Q is probably a very good starting point. You can get them relatively cheap, and it's probably the best value-to-money desktop unit out there. If you don't have lungs of steel, or need a portable unit, then you have some research to do. 

Ask a dozen people here, or over on r/vaporents, and you'll get a handful of answers for what's best. Guaranteed the dynavap fans will show up to try to convince you of their device, and it's very unlikely they'll take your needs or requirements into account before telling you all about it. Though that might be said for most recommendations on reddit anyways, I suppose. You'll also get many recommendations for the Mighty, and honestly it's probably one of the best for the quality of vapour and efficiency, but it's expensive. It also doesn't have replaceable batteries, so keep in mind that it's a recurring purchase each time one dies on you. There are easily a dozen other vapes that are more or less adequate, including my personal favorite, the Boundless Tera. 

Whatever you choose, it'll taste better than smoking, and once you get used to the subtle difference (you'll be surprised just how much of your current ""high"" is just oxygen deprivation and smoke inhalation) it *should* cut down the amount you burn through. Also worth noting that, even after you've vaped the weed, the leftovers can be used to make edibles.

In this case, the meat alternative industry will never replace the actual factory meat industry. So, at best, we'll have both operating at the same time, and dealing with the problems of both. Alternative meats (at least as they exist now) are not a solution to factory farming, but ethically farmed real meat certainly can be. 

So it would be possible to replace the factory meat industry with a more ethical, environmentally friendly one. It would be a struggle as I expect the farmers and corporations that benefit from it would fight against it, and we all know how good industries are at convincing people to go against their own best interests. The price of meat would likely be much higher, and we'd probably eat a bit less of it. Cheap garbage food places like McDonalds might find it impossible to compete, which would not be a bad thing despite the job losses. 

It's also possible that maybe one day there will exist meat alternatives that are healthy, provide the same nutrients as meat at the same levels, and do not require farming techniques that are nearly as bad as factory farming animals. We aren't there yet, and any subsidies our government provides them should be limited to R&D, not into building factories so that they can sell their crap product to people. Government should not be in the business of allowing the already wealthy to further enrich themselves at the expense of taxpayers and the environment (and just because they've done it before for other industries, does not justify them doing it again)."

Soy is grown as a monocrop which is absolutely devastating to the local ecosystem. Bad for the local animals, bad for the local bugs, bad for the soil, and probably bad for other reasons that ecological sciency people can probably describe better than I can. The production plants, trucks, trains, and other equipment used to make them are certainly not a net evironmental gain. 

May I humbly suggest that when you feel the need to scratch that itch, look into alternatives for ethical actual meat in your area.

I don't think turning vast tracts of land to soy monoculture, plus all the infrastructure and additives needed to make these meat ""alternatives"" make them any more desireable than meat for anything but the ethical considerations. 

I realize that some people simply do not want to eat animals because they think doing so is morally wrong, and while I do not feel the same way, I also don't think it's necessary to create such a questionable product (I find them to be inedible garbage) to cater to a tiny minority, who could instead just live with the consequences of their ethical choices, and...just not eat burgers. I'm sure there are all sorts of vegetarian meals they could choose instead.
