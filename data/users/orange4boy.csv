Most people could never afford private school so instead of ""bad"", as you characterize public schools, they would get none. In addition, in your free market for education, by the time a student goes through a crap private school and finds out it's crap, at least a year will have gone by, if not more, so now what? Sue the school? Move and do the year over? Who has the resources to do that? You are asking our children to be guinea pigs in an experiment. 

What we need is to get good people into government to reform the school system and eliminate the property tax funding model. Canada and many European countries have far better public school systems and they are far from libertarian. Your theory posits that since they have bigger government, they would be worse.

>For THOUSANDS of years, Jews have lived there

>Prior to dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire, the population of the area comprising modern Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza Strip was not exclusively Muslim. Under the Empire's rule in the mid-16th century, there were no more than 10,000 Jews in Palestine, making up around 5% of the population. **By the mid-19th century, Turkish sources recorded that 80% of the population of 600,000 was identified as Muslim, 10% as Christian Arab and 5–7% as Jewish**

I support Israel's legal boundaries and their right to defend them using legal methods. As for Palestine and the occupied territories, for thousands of years all kinds of people of many different religions have lived there. Follow your logic and what? Everywhere Jews have lived should be considered part of Israel? That makes no sense. 

Jews thrive all over the world. Religions do not have the right to a country.
