ElvisDuranMorningShow,ffekxug,t3_et64mh,1579852398.0,What is the show like in comparison?
Floribama,ffefo5e,t1_ffe9ey9,1579846208.0,"idk the way she talks about leaving isn't like Gus saying he's not coming back to cause drama and upset. She seems genuinely upset by persisting issues of racism in the house, especially with Kortni. She's been super vocal about it on twitter. 

I feel like of all of them she'd be the one to make the decision to leave the house if they had to deal with a situation of this severity. But if Kortni doesn't come back next season I think she will stay."
IAmA,ffdxoq6,t1_ffdqx2h,1579831506.0,"Right leaning is different in Israel than in America obviously. The reigning Israeli government is conservative, but it is run by jews. I don’t think the JP mentioned that because they think his judaism has anything to do with the crime the way right leaning publications in America would. I still don’t think it should have been mentioned though."
IAmA,ffditju,t1_ffd7bt1,1579821774.0,"I agree that his religion is irrelevant and i find it to be really problematic when publications bring up a sex offender’s judaism because there are a lot of underlying implications to that. 

But in the context of this quote it was written by the Jerusalem Post, an Israeli publication so I think his mention of being jewish in this specific instance is merely informational."
rupaulsdragrace,ffdi6yp,t1_ffc0ggj,1579821393.0,Honestly they really should form a union. I know people are making jokes about what that union would advocate for but in all seriousness there needs to be some oversight on how they are paid/treated by companies/promoters/venues.
ElvisDuranMorningShow,ffb4x79,t1_ffb3n4w,1579751892.0,"Yeah i kinda feel like he’s done and ready to retire. Sick of fans/listeners complaining all the time, probably sick of the demands of waking up early every morning (and even earlier when he’s in Santa Fe), and sick of the tight leash the show is likely held on since it’s z100/iheartmedia. I don’t blame him since he’s been doing it so long but I definitely feel like when I do tune in I hear a sense of complacency and frustration in his tone. Especially when they bring up “trolls” (like the ones who complain about gandhi)."
ElvisDuranMorningShow,ffb3juk,t1_ffb2opc,1579750878.0,"Thats exactly it. The show doesn’t have that silliness in it anymore. However brief it may have been, it makes a difference when the majority of the show is just people chatting. I feel like Greg also took a lot of charm with him when he left the show. It feel less endearing now. I’ve been listening pretty solidly for 10+ years and haven’t really listened in weeks at this point. 

Unfortunately I think the charm and fun Greg brought to the show is irreplaceable and any attempt at replacing his role would feel weird and inauthentic/forced."
LoveIslandTV,ffajx3n,t1_ff9u9ap,1579737578.0,I kept waiting for them to bring in the annual ex for S5 but it never happened!
LoveIslandTV,ffajng0,t3_es20nm,1579737387.0,"I feel like it's a combination of plastic surgery/makeup and the TV camera filters (which I heard are quite glowy and strong). Cuz every now and then I get a glimpse of an islander's real age. Was watching an interview with Belle and Anton and it was the first time that it hit me that she is actually younger than me and quite the baby, at that."
LoveIslandTV,ffajaqs,t3_esfunv,1579737123.0,It has it's pros and its cons. I feel like as an islander it feels a lot less entrapping and you're more confident about pulling people for chats because there are more places to have private conversations where less eyes are on you. But as a viewer I cannot comprehend the layout at all. I'm trying to keep track of how everything flows together but it confuses me so much.
LoveIslandTV,ffaj1wy,t1_ffagu8q,1579736941.0,"You hate her because she's insecure and not that great looking? Damn, they're still people. That's quite rude. I feel bad that she's as insecure as she is, but hate's a strong word for someone who has personal flaws. And to say you hate her because of her looks? Ouch. Have some compassion."
LoveIslandTV,ffaipyl,t3_esil1c,1579736695.0,"I don't think he handled the Sophie-Connaugh situation better because he's grown or learned a lesson or gained confidence. I think he just suppressed every instinct to freak out and be outwardly insecure because he knew that it would push her away. I don't think they will last and the cork will burst eventually, if not in the villa then quickly after they leave."
LoveIslandTV,ffaiebr,t1_ff963dt,1579736461.0,"we're really only a week and a half in though for some reason it feels much longer this series. usually by the end they stop wearing makeup in the day, but if you're trying to pick up boys and feeling insecure/still getting used to being on camera i get why they feel compelled to wear it during the day."
LiveFromNewYork,ffaehb8,t1_ffac0rb,1579733747.0,"So he’s not allowed to respond at all? There’s a difference between responding with a gif/a few stern words and trying to ruin someone’s reputation. And Allison’s platform is a lot different than Che’s. People see what you write on the internet, just because he has 20K followers doesn’t mean he can’t even respond. Che is certainly allowed to respond too, but his response has been wholly inappropriate. Allisons response to you barely caused a dent with his words."
LiveFromNewYork,ffac7yx,t3_esdneo,1579732110.0,"I don't think either of them are angels in this situation, but it's frustrating that Che can't see why a clause that says if you so much as link your socials you are signing over all your ideas and thoughts on there (for what seems like an indefinite amount of time) is wrong. That's incredibly exploitative, and I'm sure if he was an up and coming writer now he would not be happy about that clause. Even more so, the tweet that started it all wasn't even an attack on SNL's quality or his own work, it was about the ethics of a contract. I feel like he's the type to call people trolls and snowflakes but he seems like the biggest snowflake of all.

edit: and I admire Jack for saying something, because as new writer myself I wouldn't have the balls to call them out and burn a bridge. It didn't read like Jack was upset for his own work to be exploited, but for other, less powerful writers' work to be exploited."
LiveFromNewYork,ffabwql,t1_ff9mmz8,1579731905.0,"In what world is a *former* EP responding to your criticism (perhaps sternly, at *most*), the same as the co-head writer of a major network television show publicly bashing someone for months on their instagram of over 400K followers to the point of attacking that person on a personal level by accusing them of having a drug addiction and voting for Trump? I wouldn't say Allison is completely in the clear with how he has baited Michael, but in no way is he ""doing the same shit"" to you, as you said below."
harrystyles,ffa9ni3,t1_ffa85ub,1579730591.0,"I think people are assuming he won't do Medicine because it was an unreleased track and he initially added it to the setlist to have more of his own songs to perform, but now that he has the second album there's less of a need for it as opposed to actually released songs. 

But I feel like there maaaay be a chance that he does it because it seems like he listens to fans input on creating the setlist since he moved Kiwi to the encore on the last tour after he saw how popular it was."
Floribama,ff6lzhs,t1_ff6jmz3,1579630045.0,"I agree. And with Mattie and Jeremiah getting together, it’ll be interesting to see how Kortni reacts given she has that unrequited crush on him."
LoveIslandTV,ff5h8wy,t3_erl20b,1579592778.0,The face of a woman who initially came into the villa thinking every boy was going to fall at her feet and eat out of the palm of her hand but just realized she has to deal with even more competition and graft even harder than she was before
harrystyles,ff4047g,t1_fep1lc1,1579552635.0,"It’s a pre-superbowl concert intended to promote the game and build up hype. Pepsi sponsors the superbowl half time show just as they are sponsoring Harrys concert. He’s performing in Miami where the 2020 superbowl is being held, just days before the game. 

I think it’s a reach to say that Harry is supporting blacklisting Kap because he’s performing, but I also think it’s an insensitive choice when he waves BLM flags and puts BLM sticks on his guitar. 

It’s reductive/unnuanced to equate the implications of him performing at this show to you drinking a single pepsi. 

In general I don’t think we should depend on celebrities as heavily as we do to be activists, because you set yourself up to be let down that way, but surely you can understand why people are disappointed in Harry for this concert and connect the dots a bit better than that. It’s not a black and white issue."
Floribama,ff3mjrt,t1_ff3m6xf,1579544243.0,"Yes! Using Gus’s vernacular as well, when I first read it I honestly read it with Gus’s voice in my head."
Floribama,ff3m9xe,t1_ff19lr1,1579544074.0,"I feel like the cast probably signs NDAs in regards to the show so they can only discuss what the producers want them to, which is why she hasn’t been as explicit about the whole thing. Cuz Candace certainly doesn’t seem like someone to hold back if someone used that word against her and I dont think she’s being shy about it because she wants to."
Floribama,ff3lx0s,t3_ergtyq,1579543848.0,"Absolutely hahaha there’s someone that came on here defending Gus with a vitriol and anger toward Jeremiah that felt so personal and much more invested than the average viewer. It didn’t feel like a passionate fan defending Gus cuz he’s their fav, it felt like someone who had been wronged by Jeremiah."
LoveIslandTV,ff1evu7,t3_er3lk8,1579478313.0,"Yes. I feel like everyone says his game is really poor as well but if I were him I could have come in feeling confident, he's a beautiful lad and has a great body and personality, but all the jokes would have knocked me down so much. To hear day in and out that no one is pursuing someone because they are short would hurt anyone's game/confidence."
LoveIslandTV,ff1e3t0,t3_er3fcx,1579478020.0,"I really hope he ends up on the Anton journey and not the Omar journey and eventually finds someone and doesn't stay friendzoned until the moment he leaves the villa. I feel like yeah, he's not the smoothest, but I also feel like everyone is harping on his height as why they don't want to be with him and that's knocked his confidence a lot/accounts for why his game isn't 100 right now. Even when the girls like Jess are much shorter than him."
LoveIslandTV,ff16kyz,t3_eppf0q,1579475723.0,"Yeah I feel like he's exaggerated how many people he's slept with and now he's kicking himself about it because it's backfired and Sophie is turned off by the number. I think people's ""body count"" is irrelevant but I definitely find it funny that equating a high body count with power and masculinity entirely backfired on him."
LoveIslandTV,ff0mtvc,t1_ff0j77r,1579470351.0,"I agree, but can't lie....it was also incredibly satisfying to see her and Connor not get what they wanted in the recoupling."
NoStupidQuestions,ff0lpe7,t1_ff0gh0l,1579470071.0,Yes i also loved polly pockets rubber clothing.
LoveIslandTV,ff0czks,t1_ff086rt,1579467705.0,"A small example that really jumped out to me was when Amber would speak in a perfectly normal and calm tone but Michael kept telling her to stop raising her voice and shouting because he didn’t want to hear what she had to say. 

In general, he painted her as someone who was kicking off at the smallest of things and causing a lot of drama in the villa after Casa Amor when she probably handled the drama in the most level headed way compared to other people involved in post Casa Amor drama there (Amy, Michael, Anna etc.) 

Making someone question their reality and not have faith in their own intuition and beliefs is gaslighting. Making a joke that someone else doesn’t like and hurts their feelings is not gaslighting. It can be rude. But gaslighting is a serious form of abuse and should not be used lightly.

Edit: Also, to add!! I forgot about how he kept trying to paint Amber as some homewrecker when she was trying to rekindle their romance by putting herself out there and telling him she still had feelings for him. Michael kept telling her that whatever chemistry she felt was completely onesided and he made her out to be delusional about feeling a spark between them, only to turn around and say he still actually had feelings for her toward the end and had felt that the whole time but didn't want to admit it. I feel like I didn't realize how severely messed up that was until just now."
AmItheAsshole,feweswp,t3_eqlbl1,1579409394.0,"NTA - not only do you have a right to bodily autonomy and who gets to be with you in the room at any point while you shove 7 pounds out of your body, but it’s perplexing that he doesn’t see the difference between his mother being there to witness her own daughter give birth and her daughter-in-law, who she did not raise and is obviously not as close with, give birth. I don’t know if I would want my own mother in the delivery room, let alone someone elses mother."
LoveIslandTV,fevnn6f,t3_eqmy3g,1579399417.0,"I feel like theyre just not compatible in their senses of humor. Seems like everything is a joke to Sophie and Connor is very sensitive. Both aren’t 100% ideal but if they found partners that were on the same page as them they’d be clashing a lot less.

Edit: also as someone else said in another thread, gaslighting is a serious form of abuse used in situations such as domestic violence and to say that Sophie is gaslighting him because they don’t share the same sense of humor and she tells some insensitive jokes is a serious reach. It also minimizes the serious implications of gaslighting."

AreYouTheOne,fep6qdl,t3_eqa524,1579313380.0,"I think that if the victim has made it clear to the OP that she doesn’t want it brought up it’s wrong to continue rehashing it, especially because it could be retraumatizing it to have to continue addressing it. 

However Remy is claiming there’s misinformation when as he delves into the topic it just seems like he confirms the original accusation in its entirety? So I’m not sure why he thinks he has the right to be annoyed that its brought up when he’s the one who did these things."
Floribama,feozjkn,t1_feon9ba,1579308800.0,Yeah with her ex husband. And that she endured a lot of emotional abuse when she was with him.

Floribama,fenm0yz,t3_eq0sme,1579287565.0,I wonder if theyre trying to get her off because she called Candice the n-word without actually addressing the issues of racism in the cast by making out that it’s a natural pass of the baton from Kortni to Mattie.

Floribama,felt0xx,t3_eps8qw,1579230209.0,"I find her irritating and she reminds me of every woman I’ve had a co-dependent toxic friendship with, but I also feel a weird kinship to her/sympathy for her because I hate the way Gus treats her and how he manages to get away with placing the blame on her for everything. If Gus wasn’t in the picture I’m sure people on the sub would be less likely to rally behind her.

It’s also clear she’s been through a lot with the miscarriage and the death of her friend. With the miscarriage, she was clearly in a toxic relationship which is why she allows Gus to treat her that way - she’s been effectively trained to accept that kind of treatment from people. Wish people on this sub were more understanding of that fact when they expressed their frustration with her going back to him all the time."
instantkarma,felgie2,t3_eppos7,1579221634.0,I never understand when it’s not a suicide attempt and instead people just too impatient to wait for the train to go past. Do you think the barrier and the red lights are there for no reason????
TheCircleTV,fel6b27,t1_feksu1j,1579214984.0,"She didn't say she'd been through more, she said she was taking a bigger risk by revealing herself to be bigger. I think Sean was dramatic about the whole thing but I don't think it's inaccurate to say that it's harder being judged by people and winning them over when you are a tall fat woman than when you are a skinny, white petite woman. You'd be naive to say that Joey would have flirted with Sean and gravitated toward her from the start had she come in with her actual pictures."
TheCircleTV,fel62ld,t3_eppw25,1579214838.0,Yeah I think if Karyn was there long enough she would have revealed herself to Chris or whomever else she was close with at some point.
LoveIslandTV,fekqx06,t1_feji9j4,1579205757.0,Absolutely true. And people were bashing Leanne on social media before it started calling her ugly and shit... so because a few people loudly support her it's a problem/unnecessary?
ElvisDuranMorningShow,fek6fl3,t3_epfqnm,1579193586.0,Did they fire anyone from EDMS aside from elvis?
IsItBullshit,fejzir2,t1_fejmssq,1579189375.0,Because airpods are so easily lost or broken you have to keep buying new ones.  I have a friends who has purchased three different pairs at this point.
LoveIslandTV,feiizz2,t1_fei0kqn,1579139637.0,"Why does the stanning have to be because they’re black? Why can’t people just support Leanne because she IS beautiful. As for comparing her to Sophie, different strokes for different folks. Leanne is OP’s kinda woman. Nothing wrong with that. 

Is this post so deep that you needed to write out an essay response? Or could the racist in you just keep quiet no longer. 

Even more so, if people want to support contestants because they are black, why is that a problem that instills such vitriol and anger in you? Black people are treated like shit in a lot of countries/societies/in the media, so what’s the problem with sending some love to a contestants way? How does this personally affect you to make you so dang angry? Or do you just hate seeing black people being supported."
IsItBullshit,feii3vf,t3_ep9jc1,1579139049.0,That’s why I think they released the airpods and made it difficult to use an iPhone without one - they are lost or damaged incredibly easily.
TheCircleTV,fei5908,t1_fei2w3m,1579130569.0,"By fake persona I mean more like the way Seaburn spoke to people. There was no flavor to his words. It was quite boring/unpersonable, if anything. Just a lot of ""I am so honored,"" ""I respect your choice of words,"" etc etc etc. It felt super fake but it didn't create any drama that would make it worth it."
TheCircleTV,fehmb04,t3_ep2k5h,1579119437.0,"Yeah i completely agree. I feel like it's naive to not understand why people would come in as catfishes, and the obsession with sniffing them out the whole game, especially from Shubham (even though I did like him) rubbed me the wrong way. Instead of it being I like you because you are who you say your picture is, shouldn't it be I like who you are as a person and who you have expressed yourself to be in our conversations? There's a big difference between a catfisher like Seaburn and a catfisher like Mercedez (Karyn) or Sean. That's why I liked Chris's approach - if you gelled well with him you were good in his book."
LoveIslandTV,fehdo4q,t1_fegbfjx,1579114407.0,"Yeah I kind of use the term interchangeably for having sex and kissing. Guess that's quite confusing. I meant mostly kissing, not sex, in this context."
TheCircleTV,fehd1nc,t3_ep1mk0,1579114046.0,Wtf they really should have publicized this better on the show.
TheCircleTV,fehcy7f,t1_feh5u5m,1579113990.0,"I agree. I feel like she was clearly at a disadvantage for being larger and when people say that she isn't because everyone on the show spews ""accepting others"" rhetoric, they're ignoring the nuance of the fact that people have inherent subconsious biases they aren't going to say outloud.

Everyone was complaining last week that Sean clearly didn't love herself if she was catfishing, but she's just being realistic, even if she does love herself, she's seen the world treat her like crap.

Even Sammie saying that it wasn't fair for Sean to say she was taking a risk looks past the fact that it's a lot riskier to come in as a fat woman than it is to come in as a petite white thin woman. 

I feel like a lot of people took the catfishing in there as a black and white issue with no nuance."
TheCircleTV,fehcizm,t1_fehbdf4,1579113749.0,"Why are you gatekeeping this sub? Let people post what they want to post. Whether it's a popular opinion or unpopular opinion, it's not that deep."
TheCircleTV,fehc9hs,t3_eoxzca,1579113593.0,"I really enjoyed the first 3/4s of the season but the last few episodes were so dumb to me. Felt like a circle jerk. Especially with Shubham giving Sean a hard time for revealing herself and coming in as someone different as first, but totally letting Seaburn off the hook for basically being sociopathic the entire season. 

I also didn't like how Seaburn tried to paint himself as trying to advocate for men to show emotions when it was clear that any emotion he showed Rebecca dealing was clearly fake, he was never on the verge of tears because he was upset or happy. Yeah, sometimes he was anxious or freaked out but it was clear he really didn't bring much of himself into Rebecca's persona and that Rebecca's persona was entirely fake. Glad she came in last place, but I think there were other people there more deserving.

Overall just would have loved for things to kick off when they realized Seaburn was fake instead of just hugging him and shit. I don't mind people going in as catfishes cuz I do agree that if you play as yourself the picture is irrelevant, but it was clear Seaburn was playing a game the whole time."

bipolar,feevm2a,t1_feevb4q,1579042172.0,"Ok! I will try that. I don't think it's mean at all and hope that is the case. But my psychiatrist has her own practice, with two secretaries who are on top of everything, so she is very very hands on and over-involved. If I try to cancel an appointment they give me a hard time, and sometimes if my doctor suspects something is off with my mood she will text and call me multiple times a day."
bipolar,feev5p3,t1_feeuq2q,1579041895.0,"It's a solo practice (if that's what it's called). She has two personal secretaries who handle everything so they are really on top of me. If I try to cancel any appointment, they always want a reason. If I'm overdue to be prescribed, which make them realize I must be off my meds/not taking them on schedule, they figure it out and call me out on it. It's too personal honestly. That's been my whole issue. Even though my doctor does have a lot of patients, she is really hands on (especially since I've been seeing her so long) so it's pretty much impossible to slip under the cracks and be forgotten about."

LoveIslandTV,feeu9fn,t1_feesn06,1579041341.0,"I don't think they had full on sex but I do think they did bits. The show made a new policy for S5 that they would only show the islanders having sex/address the islanders having sex if they talked about it with each other the next day, I'm assuming after seeing all the repercussions the islanders have experienced (Zara losing her title in S2, Megan being slutshamed in S4 and so on)

I think Leanne didn't want to admit that she did. If you saw in yesterday's episode, the girls asked her if she did anything with Mike and she dodged the question, but had to hide her smile when they asked. On the first night you see Mike and Leanne go under the covers as well, and it looks like it was more than just talking."

In general though, I feel like Love Island has just brought in people who prefer the Fashion Nova/ISIF kind of look, so maybe that's just not Leanne's taste? 

Who knows, maybe I'm just projecting after exactly 2 episodes lol."
LoveIslandTV,fedrdob,t3_eomo1e,1579018250.0,"I agree. I really don't see the appeal of them and why all the boys are salivating at the mouth over them other than the fact that they're twins. They're beautiful, but certainly no more beautiful than Leanne, and we haven't had a chance to see if they're funny or smart.

 Perhaps they have cracking personalities, but they're attached at the hip too much when talking with the other boys for any of them to substantially get to know each other. I feel like the gimmick of them being twins is the only reason Mike is leaning toward one of them over Leanne, who is utterly stunning."

But you were keeping it to yourself and your sister simply put the clues together. At the same time, it's understandable why once she figured out you were celebrating someone's death, even if the person was a POS, she might be upset. It's dark and not all people are going to be understanding of why someone might react that way. She should be more understanding, but she also isn't an AH."

BeautyGuruChatter,fdwwtrr,t1_fdwvkz5,1578763081.0,"This is really speculative and quite biphobic, people change, a person's sexuality is ever evolving. To say he was straight before and straight the whole time is unfair, not only to Nate but to bisexual people in general. Especially when you know nothing about these people's lives. I'm not a J\* and find him to be quite problematic, so my sympathy for him specifically doesn't go too far, but it's still not right to say about Nate/about people you don't know."
MurderedByWords,fdw093h,t1_fdvigho,1578753614.0,"Maybe kids going to school every day afraid there's going to be a shooting; black and brown people afraid of police brutality; women on college campuses afraid they're going to be raped and will have no protection after Trump's US secretary of education pick removed many protections for women reporting sexual assault to their universities; women afraid they're going to lose their right to choice with abortions and go back to the days of using coat hangers; lower income folks who are afraid of how they're going to put food on the table after Trump removed much of the funding for SNAP (food stamps); lower income people wondering how they're going to put food on the table after Trump and his administration made it easier for millionaires and billionaires to pay less taxes.

Some of those people might be exhibiting PTSD like symptoms.

LoveIslandAus,fdvb1io,t3_en40aj,1578745470.0,"I just started watching S1 this week and am on E6.  My first impression is I think Erin is a bully and it frustrates me because I think I've seen spoilers that she sticks around till the end. I just don't understand why people put up with her being so rude to Millie when Millie's done nothing wrong and seems to just be herself, even if she's goofy. Erin has a problem with everything she does, she sits the wrong way, she works out the wrong way blah blah blah. Erin just comes across as really insecure in who she is and picks on Millie.

I'm curious as to why people who are watching it now dislike Millie/Tayla, because watching it the same way yall are Erin just frustrates me.

As for the other girls, Millie is my favorite in the house, then Tayla. Probably goes Milla>Tayla>Kim>Cass>Tash>Erin. But this is also coming from someone who's not even 1/3rd of the way through yet,."
lgbt,fdusspe,t1_fdu5ho1,1578738253.0,"Because every other space and community is accessible to cishet people. It may seem like the lgbtq community is widely accepted bc its popular in media now but there’s still trans women out there being killed, still people starting debates about beating the gay out of their kids on twitter. The straights have everything, can’t we have our own little community where it’s just about us? It’s not to say that allies don’t have any place in the community, I just don’t think they should be centered/a focal point. 

Allies complaining about not being included in the LGBTQ acronym reminds me of that tweet thats like [“i am feel uncomfortable when we are not about me”](https://twitter.com/probirdrights/status/368542088897372161?s=21)"

popheads,fduq950,t3_en2k9i,1578737250.0,"Absolute fucking madness. Idk if this is a fab way to look at it but I just remember, at least on tumblr and twitter, people arguing alll the time over every little thing - who was in a secret relationship, who had the best voice, who wasn’t given enough singing time on the album (they trended #letniallsing lol), who didn’t deserve the attention and who deserved more attention in the media, who’s girlfriend was using which boy or was a beard etc etc etc. I feel like we were all very passionate as teenage girls and it came out by way of aggression sometimes lol. 

I also remember like 30 year old women with children being obsessed that harry and louis were in a relationship. 

There was truly nothing like being a fan on tumblr in 2011/2012."
ElvisDuranMorningShow,fdunyz5,t3_en5d5y,1578736039.0,"Greg left a huge hole. There’s no more goofballery and I think if they tried to replace his position with someone else who would do all the absurd shit he did it would come off as insincere, unfortunately. I also feel like Uncle Johnny is on a lot less now, maybe because he had some cardiac issues this past year? Idk. But that’s a bummer too because he’s my favorite part of the show. 

The show/Gandhi is not as god awful as this sub might make it seem (and normally departures don’t change the show that much) but the differences due to this years changes are definitely felt. 

Imo it kinda feels like the end is of Elvis’s reign is coming and he’s looking forward to it. Knowing that Elvis will likely retire in the next few years, I’m trying to savor the show while its still on."
lgbt,fdtjg4r,t1_fdskhuu,1578717633.0,"But they don’t? Perhaps an ally experiences gendered or racial discrimination. But they don’t experience discrimination based on being transgender or their sexuality. Pointing that out is not gatekeeping.

This combined with Sammie calling out that he didn’t know Chris was gay in the very beginning, I’m shocked she’s not more suspicious."
