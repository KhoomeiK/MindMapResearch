OCD,ffeh79c,t1_ffebzsn,1579847875.0,Ok thanks I'll give that a go.
OCD,ffeh4cy,t1_ffeeq24,1579847781.0,"I try really hard to be understanding and compassionate but there are times when I've sent him home 3 times, walked him to the door twice and he is violating company police and verging on breaking federal law by working off the clock, that make it difficult. I'll continue to be nice though. I think there may be some options for mental health care that he would have available I'll see if he would be interested. I really do appreciate the insight though!"
OCD,ffeawt8,t1_ffeahxk,1579841635.0,"So just to make sure I understand, when he goes to hand me a gift (trash/paper/whatever) and thank me for allowing him to work for me (standard routine) what should I do? Just ignore him? Politely decline?"
OCD,ffe9yr6,t1_ffe9fj8,1579840808.0,I'll see what I can do. When you say enable his compulsions what do you mean? Should I stop accepting the gifts?
Cooking,ffe9gzx,t1_ffc8u14,1579840388.0,I've been saying this for a while but a blender is vastly overrated for the home cook unless you really like smoothies. An immersion blender and do most everything else far better and is much smaller.
OCD,ffe9b28,t1_ffdst3b,1579840253.0,So there are no strategies I can use to help him work around his compulsions? I really don't know if he is interested in therapy.
OCD,ffdpu7f,t1_ffdp336,1579826090.0,"His hands hands and face are pretty raw from washing. He must run to the end of the parking lot and back before leaving. Constantly quotes laws and regulations. If he has spare time will fill scraps of paper with tiny handwriting the is mostly illegible. At the start of shift he must give me a gift of some kind, this is generally trash that has been tied into a bow. Recently he was given a paperback book and the gifts have been torn scraps from the book. Declining the gift is basically not an option and he will not stop until you take it. He also constantly tells me and any manager how amazing we are and how undeserving his to work there."

Cooking,fegxg4x,t1_fee1w0o,1579104697.0,The better than bouillon mushroom stock is awesome. I rarely use it as a stock but as an additive. Goes great in rice while it's cooking and any kind of vegetable soup if things are tasting a little boring.

books,fdmp0kk,t3_eluaoj,1578558765.0,That's basically what you get on larger subreddits. Reddit was not designed to Foster long form discussions. Content weighting is based on time and votes. A 1 hour post with 10 votes will beat a 10 hour post with 100 votes. Short format easily digestible content is rewarded here. What you are looking for will basically only be found in small to medium communities.

Nootropics,fdjc2f1,t1_fc6khha,1578464828.0,I can not work out in a fasted state. I've tried a couple times but I hit a point (I suspect when my glucose is depleted) where I get incredibly nauseous and can not continue at all without getting sick.

AskReddit,fdhrk50,t3_elbejj,1578428787.0,"This is mostly in books but the phrase ""needless to say..."" Why tell me? You just said it is unnecessary, either you are being overly wordy or you were describing things poorly to begin with."
AskReddit,fdhr9r5,t1_fdhkdwu,1578428620.0,"I think the saying would be a little more accurate if it went ""The customers are always right."""
getdisciplined,fd7o1cl,t1_fcydf8p,1578207432.0,"Try this, get a small cushion or pillow to sit on. Sitting cross-legged on the floor is honestly just not ergonomic. It puts your hip and back into a weird position and can cause joint pain. By elevating your butt you can put your spine in a more upright position and your hips at a better angle."
getdisciplined,fd7nl6p,t1_fcxx17a,1578207231.0,"There is a quote from the Dalai Lama that I love: ""Every day I meditate for 1 hour, except on days when I don't have time, then I meditate for 2""."
Hydroponics,fcz9l2v,t3_ejl6yr,1578096438.0,Tall plants are going to be difficult to grow with that little space. Your lights and and the pots are going to eat up a lot of vertical grow area. But hey give it a shot! I would do a test run with some Deep Water Culture lettuce and see how that works out for you. Honestly you running through a basic setup is probably going to tell you more about your space and environment than we can.
AskReddit,fcwqrdm,t1_fc6agi5,1578033926.0,"So when people say weight loss, what they really mean is fat loss. Eating less calories then you burn causes your body to burn fat to make up the difference. Your body has a natural amount of calories it burns just to keep you alive, for the average guy that's about 2000 calories a day. You eat less than that you lose weight, simple. Now you can also cause your body to burn more energy by exercising. HOWEVER the effort difference between just not downing a 300 calorie cookie or going for a 30 minute jog is enourmous! There is a saying ""you can't outrun a bad diet"". It is not hard to over eat for even a very active lifestyle. So while exercise is great (and you should do it) cutting calories will do way more for weight loss than any ordinary amount of exercise you want to do.  
One more point, weight lifting is a sneaky tool for weight loss. Once your start lifting your start developing lean muscle mass. Muscle takes more energy for your body to maintain than fat so that 2000 calories I said earlier? That will increase so your body will burn more calories just by existing! There is a drawback though, if you add muscle mass the number on the scale is going to stay the same so you may have to have some faith that you are improving. Taking pictures every week or two helps some people, others recomend measuring yourself with calipers and tape.
Good luck man!"
Cooking,fcsohe5,t1_fcpmf7w,1577921105.0,Get your sister to take a b6 vitamin (not in a complex) b6 is hard to get from a veggie diet and helps with energy levels throughout the day.
AmItheAsshole,fcpgkb2,t1_fcobgm3,1577863057.0,The people her age comment makes me think that there is a cultural aspect to this.
AmItheAsshole,fcpg198,t3_ei4xzy,1577862368.0,"YTA  
People have to want this kind of change. If you try to force it on them they will run the other way. If you try to force them to eat healthier they will just eat more junk elsewhere."
AskReddit,fcmifsr,t1_fcmbntk,1577776551.0,"Hmm if you want to try it out you can make granita with basically nothing. Get a baking tray, some grapefruit juice, and a fork. Add a little sugar to the juice if you like. Pour juice into the baking tray and put in freezer. Leave for about an hour (will vary based on freezer) until ice starts to form around the edges. Break up the ice with a fork. Repeat every 15 minutes untill it is totally frozen and a nice even consistency. That's it's. This produces a fantastic granita and is so simple it's nuts. If you want to be fancy about it you can juice your own grapefruit and serve the granita in the rind. However I have found that bottled juice (at least once frozen) has pretty much the same flavor as fresh.  
The sugars in the fruit prevent a super hard freeze and by breaking the crystals you get a consistent texture. You can take this and do it with basically anything. A tart lemonade, pomegranate juice. If you wanted more flavor combos look up Mexican paletas I bet you could do the same thing and turn them into funky granitas."
AskReddit,fclprec,t1_fcl891p,1577753497.0,That's hard to say.
Cooking,fc7d9e3,t1_fbwc8jn,1577504032.0,"I'm of the opinion that most home cooks should buy an immersion blender before a normal one, unless they have a particular attachment to margaritas or smoothies."
AmItheAsshole,fbfsdst,t1_fbd4ty0,1576819399.0,I imagine habitat for humanity would fit d those skills very valuable.
