My comment was more about the here-and-now, but youth from that generation did try to bring about change through heavy protesting and campaigning when they were met with severe adversity. Unfortunately, they had some of the lowest voter turnouts of that age range (though the their voting rights were also pretty new). But I think that could have come from a place of feeling helpless. I think college kids today might feel more empowered, or maybe they're even more desperate for change. They're tuned into the world more than ever.

That said, I think it's important to not let supporters of any candidate color your opinion of that candidate. I see that a lot now and it disappoints me.

She told me that her ex had full custody of her child but that she visited with them every few months. Maybe that should have been a warning sign.

It started out alright, seemed like a normal date. But she soon started hogging the entire conversation, and nearly everything that came out of her mouth was negative. She seemed to really hate men (no, that is *not* the norm for queer women), bashed her ex a lot. Bashed men in general. Then she revealed that she had a *second* child who her parents had full custody of. She went on to bash her parents, said they took her child because they were racist (she was an adopted POC) and Christian (she wasn't). Thaaaat made no sense to me. When I tried to insert anything else into the convo, she somehow made it into a negative. The way she went on and on about her messed up life made me feel like she was using me as a therapist.

But I know different demographics can effect what you get (ex: 2 of my 3 surveys today were about how I parent my young child). That being said, I just hope it keeps a steady pace, I worry it’ll end up like InboxDollars which is almost useless for me."
ProlificAc,felc0dw,t1_felbjey,1579218630.0,"Thanks for the info! I hit 49 yesterday, so that probably explains it...

Funnily enough, I got a survey a few minutes after making this post. I guess that's how it usually goes after you complain about something."
politics,fel7rzy,t1_fel74kh,1579215899.0,"What?! I totally believe the person who posted ""ELI5: Why do women not enjoy sex?"" is an honest user and should be believed without question!"
politics,fekvhtn,t1_fekunsx,1579208450.0,That bot has that list and ones that are similar posted all over their page. They couldn't be more transparent.
beermoney,fekgnm9,t1_fekdo9t,1579199650.0,Ahh. That sounds like more trouble than it's worth. Thanks for the info!
beermoney,feka53n,t3_epikev,1579195783.0,"I'm not sure what games you're referring to, but the only beermoney game I play is KO Trivia and it's been going pretty well for me (I've gotten enough points to earn $10 in the span of a couple weeks and I'm on my way to $20). There's also no cash whatsoever to put in. If you like trivia (it's one of my favorite things), I'd give it a go.

Sorry if this is way off topic, I just saw ""games"" in the title and figured I'd share."
bipolar,feh4pjh,t3_eovgn2,1579109093.0,"As a bibipolar myself, I appreciate this."
beermoney,feh25ez,t1_feglx5i,1579107570.0,"Same here. They feature *a lot* of scammy avenues to get earnings, but if you stick to the basic surveys it's totally possible to meet the $30 minimum within a few months. Not my favorite beermoney app, but it's not bad when you have some time to kill."
politics,feesl0e,t1_feep4ey,1579040313.0,"If only. See: Every post about this, and every post about Warren in general today. Loads of people are still taking it."
beermoney,febubwf,t3_eno69v,1578962772.0,"I've only been on Prolific for a few days, but I've noticed that I get the most surveys (or basically all of my surveys) in the morning (PST). It's pretty much dead when the afternoon/evening hits. I just stay logged in in the morning and grab 'em while the getting is good. I've already made a little over $5, definitely the fastest paying survey site I've tried."
politics,febr68u,t3_eoc18j,1578961775.0,"Most of them don't bother with the ""T"" part though. I've seen instances of trans Trump supporters on T_D, and at best, the sub will say something like, ""I don't care if you're red, purple, or whatever--glad you're on our side."" And that's the *nicest* thing they'll claim. Most of it is met with downvotes and transphobia. They really have a hard time pretending with that demographic."
bipolar,febeyq6,t1_feberr7,1578958171.0,Thanks so much<3
bipolar,febeqk6,t1_febb4h4,1578958109.0,Thank you<3
bipolar,febefgb,t1_febauvp,1578958009.0,"I'm really sorry that you're also having a rough day. It's no fun:(

I'm going to stick it out since I'm down to about an hour and a half at this point. I'm worried I'm also getting sick, so I don't want to use up sick time if I end up feeling worse physically this week.

Here's to a better tomorrow."

AsABlackMan,fdl7tww,t1_fdl6v4m,1578518520.0,"Just want to thank you for sacrificing your karma for these comments. I don't get how seemingly progressive redditors always love the ""lol homophobes r gay"" jokes, along with the ""[Conservative-Going-to-Jail] shouldn't drop the soap!"" jokes, but it doesn't surprise me at this point."
politics,fdkpfa9,t1_fdkle6o,1578508403.0,"I listened to one of his pressers shortly before impeachment proceedings began, and it was just. so. bad. I often read the transcripts, but hearing it was a whole other ballgame. I don't know how anyone can feel any amount of confidence or reassurance after listening to that man."
politics,fdkj1ol,t1_fdkil8k,1578504773.0,"It's part of why I don't watch/listen to the news. I've gotten a little numb to reading the phrase, but hearing it is super jarring."

politics,fd5leda,t1_fd2viv2,1578178714.0,"Thank you for the info, I meant to look that up myself. Good that that protocol exists (even if what he says will be a national embarrassment)."
politics,fczekp4,t3_ejovd1,1578099437.0,"My brain jumbled the letters and I first read the headline as

> Trump endorses tweet to stop comparing Democrat to Iranians

And I was like, ""Wow, for once..."" and then my brain read it correctly and now I hate everything again."
politics,fczcn27,t1_fcz53hd,1578098244.0,"Even before yesterday, I was wondering if he'd actually give one. And now I can see him saying, ""I'm too busy doing war stuff"" all while he spends the day golfing. We shall see... 

And if it does go down, he'll just treat it like another of his rallies (so, batshit craziness will ensue)."
politics,fcz0ik3,t1_fcyzpl3,1578091189.0,"You’re inside the vagina, touching the inside of the vagina. Unless you have a fistful of vagina (which please, don’t attempt that), you’d be doing what I just said.

Neither of us are being smartasses, we’re trying to inform you on how anatomy works. Please just say “your username checks out” and throw in the towel."
politics,fcyxa83,t1_fcyurau,1578089109.0,"Like, I could say that your original comment was a *little* pedantic given the subject at hand, but the ""it can be grabbed!"" responses are just dumb. I highly doubt these folks would downvote you if you pointed out that you can't grab a urethra."
sandiego,fcysrqs,t3_ejkn6a,1578086292.0,Absolutely. I moved here from L.A. in my mid-teens and could tell even then that the military presence/vibe was much different here.

politics,fcygvkh,t3_ejjbhq,1578079900.0,It makes my eyes bleed the grammar of this headline.
beermoney,fco69sd,t1_fcnuk23,1577824880.0,That's a good tip! I have a huge purse and I'm always afraid that I'll lose a receipt in there and find it much later. Might invest in one of those holders...
