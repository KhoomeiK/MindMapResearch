AmItheAsshole,fdyh6ca,t3_en6jau,1578779727.0,"NTA. You may not realize it, but she's trying to bully you into complying. By guilting you and insulting you, alternately, it seems. All the more reason to hold your ground. Maybe there's something you could do to find a way to show her how terrible bullying really is. It isn't harmless and it isn't a joke. It ranges from very harmful to deadly. It affects people for years, or decades. It causes suicide and self harm. Im not even exaggerating. Part of the reason I feel it's important to instill in her how serious it is, aside from the damage she's already done, is that she's nearly a legal adult and after that, sometimes you can't do anything to fix what's started.

Also, I'd go a step further, and make her do something to benefit the girl she's been bullying, and anyone else she may have been bullying. I may even ask her victim if she could be sure to let anyone else who's been bullied by her to come forward with proof. Making her apologize may sound nice, but she won't mean it and both girls will know.

You're NTA. If she's only grounded from parties and dances, that's lenient, actually.
