NFL_Draft,ff6pn73,t1_ff6oqdz,1579632253.0,"That's exactly how I would put it, actually yeah.

I wouldn't say he's quite at Mahome's level (at least not yet) but I feel like what KC and Andy Reid were able to do with Mahomes is part of what makes Love my favorite prospect. Almost like what Russell Wilson was essentially able to do to help Kyler's draft stock as an atypically sized NFL QB.

Mahomes and Love out of college, both raw talents who can make every throw and extend plays.

Mahomes was considered risky because he never really won games whereas Watson won a national championship (though Watson did have injury concerns). And Love would be a ""risky"" pick because he has rarely played against top tier talent and hasn't done well when he has. I just think the dude is far too talented to pass up on. The only college QBs I'd rather have are Joe Burrow (because you can bring him in and immediately have success as he is undoubtedly NFL ready both mentally and physically) and Trevor Lawrence (not eligible for another year)."
NFL_Draft,ff6o10h,t1_ff6ng84,1579631283.0,"Physically, he is just a complete NFL-ready player. His supporting cast is far and away the worst of any QB in the class and because of that, he often tries to do everything himself, resulting in a lot of turnovers.

He isn't perfect but he has a ton of talent and ability that cant possibly be taught and all of his negatives are things that can be coached out. 

Imo, he has the highest ceiling"
NFL_Draft,ff6lm1j,t1_ff6lh4x,1579629814.0,That's probably the best solution. I just dont see him dropping all the way to 18
NFL_Draft,ff6js0y,t1_ff6jo0d,1579628699.0,I'd rather take Love at 5 to be entirely honest. I just dont trust Tua's injury status
NFL_Draft,ff6hewg,t3_erwmuu,1579627258.0,Jordan Love will go on to have the best career of any QB in this draft class.

ravens,fe4gzeq,t1_fe43riu,1578859183.0,"He didnt even really have that bad of a game tbh.

His second interception was a horrible throw and his fumble came from trying to do too much, but other than that, the man gave absolutely everything he had.

A few crucial drops really hurt us and put us in a hole early. And our aggressive approach to 4th downs that won us games all season just happened to go against us this time."
