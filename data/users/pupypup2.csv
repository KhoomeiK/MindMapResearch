And it's just a tiny data file, which yeah being able to convert a file from something that was formatted 24 years ago, to today, is impressive."
NintendoSwitch,ffz9g18,t3_evsecf,1580368324.0,"What does ""premium members only"" mean? Is that for home or bank? Because if I have to pay more than $5 to get my Pokemon into pokemon home (not counting the fee for home which is even more overpriced) well I just won't get sword or shield."
Cringetopia,ffz92in,t1_ffz7jln,1580367878.0,"I don't think it was ABA therapy, no. But I'm not sure. From what I've heard aba is actively abusive, and my therapy definitely wasn't abusive, just felt useless to me at the time. See it was more like playdates than anything, or at least that's how I felt. And actually when I wanted to leave I was thinking the other kids in the therapy sessions where having a negative influence on me and I wanted to get away from that. Not because my parent said anything, in fact I don't think I've ever mentioned that to them, but that was a big reason I stopped wanting to go."
PlayTemtem,ffz8ten,t1_ffz13rm,1580367583.0,"A few things. It seems gf thinks they can get away with things when cloaked in new hardware (as we can see with the switch). Firstly gen 6 toned down the difficulty, a lot. People like to say Pokemon was always easy, it wasn't always *this* easy. Next this was the generation where they started the whole ""friendly rival"" thing. And while wally from gen3 technically was a ""friendly"" rival he clearly still wanted to beat you as much as you want to beat him. Gen 6 onwards this simply isn't the case as they grab the starter weak to yours. Also the animation, it's always looked kind of weak and soulless. It's trying to emulate the older games I suppose but as a 3D model it's just bland, and if you look at it side by side with gen5, gen5 looks a million times better imo. Like we got stuck with them using these models from here on out (a big reason why the dex cut is unacceptable) and I'd prefer it if we just kept the gen5 sprites into the 3ds era. Gen 3 remakes where fine for remakes. And sun and moon was okay, a little overbearing on the story, but fine, just usum was too much of the same, couldn't finish that one. Everything else about Pokemon however has stayed fairly consistent. We get cool new Pokemon each generation, a decent story (lacking in swsh) and the core Pokemon formula that will always be fun."

That clearly isn't the case. I think a big part of a subs content is how the mods filter it, the rules are so vague if a mod has a bias they can take down any post they want.
