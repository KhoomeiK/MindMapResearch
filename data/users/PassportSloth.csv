Only submit when I have a triple and my first triple is submitted a minute after I've paid gems for the boost. I have about 7 pets and a multitude of magical creatures at different stages for feeding/bonding goals and for hitting those ""earn 245 <3 points"" goals when I've run out of energy. I don't do the other quests or further my story line so I just collect from pets 1-2 times a day and save it up for full marks. 

I managed to get 2 triples and a double in before my boost ended and I've got 2070 right now with 2nd place at 590. I also spent 10 gems on flipping 2 tiles during this time. And I don't collect on things if I don't need them. For instance the daily bonus was ""watch an ad for 75 gold"", I'll see if I can finish a board and wait to see the new set of tiles before watching, because 1 tile might be ""earn 300 gold"", etc. I might spend another 5-10 gems flipping tiles but I usually don't boost more than once. It takes until next FM event to gather enough gems again. (Full marks is my favorite thing about this game.)"
