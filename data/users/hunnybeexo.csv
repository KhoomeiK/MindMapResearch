creepyPMs,fenmhl9,t3_eq18mh,1579287849.0,That’s enough reddit for today
AmItheAsshole,fejpce9,t3_epirbk,1579182360.0,"Do you even hear yourself? It wasn’t HER choice. You basically forced her to make a decision she probably wasn’t comfortable with and are now trying to act as if you had nothing to do with her getting an abortion. You threatened to leave, you got parents to call her. Like come on! You put her in a spot that she possibly felt no way out of."
AmItheAsshole,fejnh8x,t3_ep9om0,1579180774.0,"Here, let me tell you something. Last year, my sister in law was getting married outside of the country precisely around the time my daughter was going to be born. My husband made the decision to stay home with me because obviously at that stage I can’t travel anymore. I get that it wasn’t an easy decision to make but at the same time he told me that me and our baby comes first. The way you’re even writing about it is so appalling. As if what your wife is going through is some walk in the park. She’s going to be giving birth to your baby! Show a little more appreciation for that and stop being selfish and thinking about yourself. Sure, there may be other people there to help her but those people are not you! Smarten up 🤦🏽‍♀️"

relationships,fehqo9k,t3_ep4tdd,1579121954.0,You’re not overreacting. Don’t let someone so shallow be a part of your life or your daughters.
AmItheAsshole,fehqgy9,t3_ep5bb6,1579121838.0,I did this to my husband. He didn’t realize how he sounded until I played a recording for him. He took it rather well and changed how he talks when we argue.
insaneparents,fefe0kq,t1_fefdw5n,1579054307.0,You’re welcome!
insaneparents,fefd6h0,t1_fefby5u,1579053776.0,"Hmm yeah I know what you mean. But it all depends on how you view the concept of God. If we think He would constantly judge us then what would be the point. I don’t have all the answers to this because it can be a complex answer but for me, God is like a security blanket. He’s not there to judge or I guess punish us but rather He is there to help and guide us. I can’t say that I can answer everything for you because I am also on a journey of discovering and trying to understand more of what I believe in but if I ever come up with an answer I will let you know :)"
insaneparents,fefbgp0,t1_fef9n25,1579052648.0,"Christianity at its core is the simplest and the one that makes the most sense to me. I think it’s hard especially now to understand the appeal because there are lots of people claiming to be “Christian” but in reality what they proclaim as Christian really isn’t. But yeah, in the most basic way, it’s the simplest concept of God :)"
insaneparents,feew2fh,t3_eopw1t,1579042452.0,I’m Christian and this is wrong on so many levels 😐

AmItheAsshole,fe833hp,t3_enz9oy,1578921941.0,"The fact that her friends told her that she should have heard him out says a lot. If he had hurt OP or done really horrible things, her friends would not have told her to hear him out. Something about this situation seems off and I think things have been omitted (also OPs post history on here doesn’t paint her in a very good light)"

creepyPMs,fdpb94d,t3_emgtrj,1578624317.0,I guess he didn’t blow her away with his message
relationships,fdkdia0,t3_elu954,1578501570.0,"Talk with him one more time but if he states he doesn’t want to be with you anymore, as much as it hurts, you will have to move on. It’s better to know now how he feels then to have to uproot your life, spend even more years together and then realize it was all for nothing. Whatever the outcome, I hope things work out for you."
niceguys,fdhdxim,t3_eld16r,1578420637.0,I wonder why he’s single....
AmItheAsshole,fd9oqey,t3_ek97t6,1578236137.0,"NTA - as a lesson learned in the past, don’t join bank accounts and don’t get anything under both your names unless you’re getting married. It could get messy if a breakup occurs or things don’t work out."

ChoosingBeggars,fcmykzf,t3_ei1tzk,1577797761.0,This person probably goes to the grocery store and demands to get paid for having to buy groceries because it took time and effort to do so
