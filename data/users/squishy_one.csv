I would know I'm the only one there, but I hear tapping on keyboards, papers shuffling, cupboards closing or whispering. It freaks me to the point that I go around to check no one is there, then I get so freaked out that would be my queue to go home... I'm slightly positive we may have a ghost."
offmychest,fel00dt,t3_epndfj,1579211143.0,"You're absolutely right. Life is hard and it's our fault. We push ourselves to limits to live a better life, we work hours on end and stress ourselves to the limit. Yet we do not appreciate nor recognize the simple things in life that are worth nothing yet could make us so happy."
talesfromcallcenters,fe0inb1,t1_fdzibnl,1578813988.0,"Once I had a woman asking me if I was Christian and was forcing me to repeat after her a prayer she was citing. I was on hour 11 of my shift and I seriously did not need this crap.

I told her no and she just kept on insisting that I repeat after her. I just told her "" mam unless there's more business I can help you with today I'm going to terminate this call"" and hung up."

offmychest,fcfyrrv,t1_fcfka4w,1577634945.0,"I totally get it. One thing I've learned is, it's ok to burn bridges if they're not leading anywhere. I had a hard time applying that with my parents but I was so tired trying to engage them in a relationship when it shouldn't be this hard. It wasn't easy but I am starting to feel better about keeping them away from my life. There is no point, it's a one sided relationship. 

I would consider what your relationship with your parents is bringing to you and  make a decision on how much or if you want to factor them in your life."
offmychest,fccxwby,t3_egye58,1577603968.0,"I know exactly how you feel. Same reaction my mother had when I told her that my now husband and I are getting married and that we settled on a house we like.

Her reaction was the equivalent of me telling her I found a good deal on toilet paper at the supermarket.

I'm very happy for you and wish you all the love and happiness in the world."

I mean... eeeewwww! I don't want spare body parts. At least I'm happy she didn't keep his foreskin from his circumcision."
