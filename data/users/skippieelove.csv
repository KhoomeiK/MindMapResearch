“the reviewer than the reviewed” would be the appropriate wording.

We need a mental health force dammit not an effing space force 😭 putting these over worked, stressed, and sometimes downright toxic officers as the mediators in such a delicate situation is 100% bull in a china shop. They just wanna get the job done, even the best ones likely wanna move on to the next call that’s likely a far more pressing issue in their eyes.

Though I do think they meant it with the best possible intentions (maybe they’re trying to understand a better way to reach out to people in these situations even for themselves), it feels a little too clean cut. Almost cold and factually focused. I feel like something like that is increased via text where it’s difficult to portray and pick up on emotion. On top of that, not being a trained professional and understanding they dynamic interpretations but perhaps still trying to sound professional maybe?
 
And then if you have a predisposed idea of the senders intent  it can really affect the conversation. Kinda like that key and peele [skit](https://youtu.be/naleynXS7yo) 😂 and even I feel my interpretation was a little influenced given your first messages context.
