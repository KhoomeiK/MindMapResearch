Still we like it in our family, better than being a solo experience, everyone gets to watch - we really like it in super hot :)"

Your adult kids are suddenly kid-aged kids and they sit behind you on the back of a fat chunky-ass celestial horse that needs a FUCK-TON of road and a downhill slant to get up enough speed to take off then you fly for a couple minutes over a beautiful lake til you get to McDonalds and get a burger and fries which is fucken weird because I’m a vegetarian. Anyway I shit you not last night I dreamed I died and rode that fucken horse to maccas and ate the shit out of a juicy fucken burger.

EDIT didn’t proof read properly but don’t judge me cause I dreamt I died last night rode celestial horse ate burger, still getting over it."

OculusQuest,fewwjog,t3_eqtiy1,1579420594.0,"Note - connected quest and chrome to the range extender. My son Matt is now playing Pavlov with no dropouts off the internet as well, woohoo!

Apparently, you can also adjust router settings so it is 2 discreet wifi’s to connect to as well, this could work. Just connect Chrome and Quest to same wifi from the router. I didn’t look into it, simpler for me to just use my old school tp link on solely 2.4GHz.

Hope this helps someone! 

No more dropouts for over an hour now so happy!!

EDIT : I think the Quest must switch between 2.4 and 5, whatever it thinks is best available, for me this was a bummer."
