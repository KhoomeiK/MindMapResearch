>There are many urban myths out there about what to do when you are caught in an avalanche. For example ‘you need to pee so the avalanche rescue dogs can find you easier’ or ‘you need to spit so you know what is up and down’. Funny, but not very useful in practice. When the avalanche comes to a stop it can feel like concrete. Spitting (let alone digging yourself out once you know up from down) is no longer an option. And if you do not pee in your pants anyway, that is not very useful because it will take a while for the avalanche rescue dog to get to you—if they are even in the area in the first place."
PublicFreakout,fejdetb,t1_feiqbom,1579168546.0,"[Edison had pretty much nothing to do with the execution of Topsy the elephant.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topsy_\(elephant\)#Association_with_Thomas_Edison)

>In popular culture, Topsy is portrayed as the elephant that was electrocuted in a public demonstration organized by Thomas Edison during the War of Currents to show the dangers of alternating current. Examples of this view include a 2008 Wired magazine article titled ""Edison Fries an Elephant to Prove His Point"" and a 2013 episode of the animated comedy series Bob's Burgers titled ""Topsy"". The inventor had been involved with the electrocution of animals 15 years earlier during the War of Currents, trying to demonstrate the dangers of alternating current, but the events surrounding Topsy took place 10 years after the end of the ""War"". **At the time of Topsy's death, Edison was no longer involved in the electric lighting business. He had been forced out of control of his company with its 1892 merger into General Electric and sold all his stock in GE during the 1890s** to finance an iron ore refining venture. The Brooklyn company that still bore his name mentioned in newspaper reports was a privately owned power company no longer associated with his earlier Edison Illuminating Company. **Edison himself was not present at Luna Park, and it is unclear as to the input he had in Topsy's death or even its filming** since the Edison Manufacturing film company made 1200 short films during that period with little guidance from Edison as to what they filmed. Journalist Michael Daly, in his 2013 book on Topsy, surmises how Edison would have been pleased that a proper method of positioning of the copper plates was used and that the elephant was killed by the large Westinghouse AC generators at Bay Ridge, but he shows **no actual contact or communication between the owners of Luna Park and Edison over Topsy**.

>Two things that may have indelibly linked Thomas Edison with Topsy's death were the primary newspaper sources describing it as being carried out by ""electricians of the Edison Company” (leading to an eventual confusing of the unrelated power company with the man), and the fact that the film of the event (like many Edison films from that period) was credited on screen to ""Thomas A. Edison""."
