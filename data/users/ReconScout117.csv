cults,ffjvub4,t3_etunt0,1580008351.0,"I was stationed in South Korea for a couple of years around the time these guys were banned from coming onto our bases. They were encouraging new members to abandon their Oath of Enlistment (See Treason) to push their agenda to other servicemen and women. Once a couple of people were recovered, they underwent extensive deprogramming afterwards, and given psychiatric discharges when it didn’t work. If that doesn’t scare you away, I don’t know what will. Tell them to politely go away, and when they keep pushing, “Fuck off” usually breaks through the mental wall."

TheExpanse,ffjt9bh,t3_eto0u3,1580006327.0,"My fiancée has been irritated with me for the past couple days. I’ve monopolized the Big Television with the super sweet sound system, and she has been sucked into The Witcher 3 for the past month. So was I, until I started watching The Expanse to give my Xbox a break, and try to get my circadian rhythm back under control. I just finished Season 4, and am very happy with Amazon for picking up the series and breathing new life into the series. I hope they continue to give the authors creative control over the show, and we continue to see the crew of the Rocinante continue to put the boot to the booty."

insaneparents,ffi5ppv,t3_etq18v,1579965783.0,"My relationship with my parents is great, but I had a buddy in the Marines that barely survived his “Upbringing.” He joined the Corps on a waiver at 17 and graduated early to fulfill his dream of being a Marine like his grandfather, who wasn’t a piece of shit, and had raised him until he passed away and he was forced into his biological parents house. His sperm donor beat him mercilessly for the smallest infraction, drank heavily, and his mother was totally cowed by the whole situation. There wasn’t any support until he spoke to his recruiter and was worried about becoming medically ineligible before his Ship Date. The recruiter had a “Discussion” with the son of a Bitch and gave him a valuable lesson in the difference between a kid and a very well trained adult. The Marine Corps became his family afterwards, and we became fast friends after Boot. We served all over the world together and he tried to make amends with his father after we got a taste of how dangerous it actually was. I guess he was still smarting from his “Discussion” with the recruiter, and wouldn’t even speak with my friend. I took him home with me over the Holiday Leave Period, and he saw how a real dad treated his family. He took those lessons to heart and his own family has benefited. We still meet up at least once a year and he told me that his father had a post on his Facebook page about being alienated by his kids. We had a good laugh about it and he got a little emotional about what his father had missed out on. Then we had a couple more beers and tied a milk can to a pickup truck."
DadForAMinute,ffgqyxh,t3_ete4ma,1579912822.0,"If you don’t feel like you’re part of a team, you’re not. If you’re the only one pushing for something better, it’ll take far too long to get it, and it’s not worth it to sacrifice your mental and physical well being. If you have to go by yourself, do it. It’s the only way to get on your feet and live for yourself. If you try to hold on to this, those dark thoughts will get worse, and if I hear about an attempt, I’ll put my boot so far up your ass, you’ll be able to floss with the laces. Take care of yourself first, so you can care for those who care for you."

aww,ff87fwk,t3_es1k17,1579668157.0,"This makes me miss my grandparents something fierce. They lived close by a natural lake and would always head there on Friday evening to sit on a beachfront bench and just chat and skip rocks until the sun set. After my grandma passed, my grandpa would go by himself if nobody else would go with, sit on their bench and talk to my grandma about his week and catch up with her. I always went with him when I could, but didn’t know he would speak with her until he started declining and asked me to go tell grandma what was going on. That’s some soulmate life right there."

Iamactuallyverybadass,fevhd8r,t3_eqfxc0,1579397461.0,"Seconds count when an airway is blocked. Especially with infants and toddlers that are just learning to communicate. They’ll panic and try to tell you that they are fine because they think they’re in trouble for making a scene, but any amount of calm observation will make it evident that they are in serious danger. The Heimlich is different for separate age groups, and you have to be very gentle with infants and seniors. They’re more prone to being injured in the process of clearing an obstruction. If you don’t know how, learn. The Red Cross sponsors a class in my area every three months, and the local Fire Department picks up the slack in between. It’s not difficult to learn, but guessing what to do is deadly. They also teach you how to clear an obstruction on yourself, and that could save your life."

AmItheAsshole,felq03m,t3_epmdeh,1579228128.0,"Should be a no-brainer of a decision for you. Your stepdaughter had nothing to do with your daughter, purposely, it sounds.

They’re labeled as aggressive and have a very difficult time being re-homed. Most will adopt the same protective instinct that their owners have after some initial trepidation. They feel some anxiety and react to that at first, but they eventually get it."

AmItheAsshole,fdo7nng,t3_emabvo,1578600311.0,"Document everything. Make sure you are safe, first and foremost. If you believe a reprisal could be incoming, contact your HR department immediately and file a sexual harassment case. That’s what they’re supposed to be for, and nobody should have to put up with this kind of behavior from anyone. Not only is it unprofessional, but as word gets around (as it always does), it will be seen as permissive by the lower echelons, and will get worse. I don’t care if your harasser was drunk or otherwise not in control of his faculties, he should never have been put in a position that would give him any kind of power to do anything like this. Don’t give your boss a chance to cover it up either. If he’s going to permit this kind of stuff, he doesn’t need to be a boss."

I’m guessing that you inherited the business from a deceased relative and know nothing about the work required to bring a vehicle back to standard when the owner has children who can destroy the interior and exterior of a vehicle within hours. Sell the business to someone who won’t bitch at their customers for actually using the business to clean their car. Any backstory to this one OP?"
walkaway,fd9txnq,t3_ekci1f,1578237980.0,"We knew we were fighting Iranian soldiers in Iraq. You can tell the difference between a run of the mill insurgent and a professional because of the appearance between the two. An insurgent is skinny, malnourished, scraggly, and usually on something like PCP or methamphetamine because of the indifference to physical pain or dangerous behavior. The Iranian soldiers had military haircuts, used up to date battle tactics, and had better equipment than the insurgent groups. They would also stand and fight, unlike the irregular Iraqi forces."
