nextfuckinglevel,ffpa10j,t1_ffnfeex,1580089888.0,It would take me about a hundred throws just to get the knife to stick in the wood.
samharris,ffk0f6c,t1_ffj5t89,1580012006.0,The news that breaks on Twitter is usually being reported by journalists who work for “old” media. And people don’t believe the other stuff until it’s confirmed by “old”media unless they’re complete fools.
funny,ffk011o,t3_etz6ym,1580011680.0,The crowd reaction seems a little muted. Maybe it took a bit for what they just witnessed to sink in.

oculus,ff0ztmq,t3_er2rwo,1579473861.0,Is Boneworks actually good? Just got a Rift S and don’t know what games I should be buying.
BillBurr,fezi2km,t1_feypcil,1579457595.0,"Yeah, but successfully keeping billion dollar machines from falling into the ocean is a damn nice thing to have on your resume when you want to step up the ladder."
modernwarfare,fezcaf9,t3_eqrfph,1579455889.0,"I develop acute video game dyslexia the second I take the controls of Wheelson. Best I can do is try to corner camp in a high traffic area and use it as a stationary turret. I think it’s the only killstreak that makes it harder for me to get kills than just normal play. If they had a coop mode where all the players could just beat the crap out of an unpowered Wheelson, like Office Space style, I bet it would be the most popular thing in Modern Warfare."
funny,few7n16,t3_eqnr3v,1579406505.0,"Well, that’s one more thing I’ve been doing wrong my whole life."
NormMacdonald,fevv8l4,t1_fevumn2,1579401925.0,"Agreed. I actually think some of the policies he’s pushing, like UBI, will be seriously considered 15-20 years from now when AI has decimated the workforce, but America is nowhere near ready to start that conversation right now. And Yang ain’t the right salesman."
NormMacdonald,fevu7ii,t1_fevt9ir,1579401561.0,"Yeah, that’s why Norm is doing this. He’s on record saying he likes ridiculous people, and Yang, or at least his candidacy, qualifies. Norm is taking the piss."
holdmyredbull,fevau03,t1_fetych9,1579395246.0,"Yeah, “the danger is where the impressiveness comes from”, which is why I’m never impressed by tricks performed by people wearing helmets."
NormMacdonald,feu2dhf,t3_eqcjif,1579382443.0,I wonder if Yang realizes Norm is only doing this because he thinks he’s absurd.
NormMacdonald,feu1y30,t1_feprdr6,1579382318.0,That is a damn clever comment.
unpopularopinion,feib3a2,t3_ep1lgz,1579134351.0,"I don’t think it’s an attempt to downplay your suffering, but maybe an attempt to put it in perspective and remind you to be grateful for what you do have. Just like being bitter, being grateful is a choice and can lead to a better state of mind and maybe even a better life. Bitterness doesn’t accomplish much."
unpopularopinion,fece3dn,t3_eoadpr,1578971724.0,"It’s also incredibly tedious how, every time a poorly performing, no chance in hell Democratic presidential candidate drops out who isn’t a white male, the media have to announce it with the disclaimer that the field “has become less diverse”. Yes, I can see that CNN. What’s your point? The person didn’t poll well and didn’t raise any money, so they quit. The Democratic Party also nominated the first black man for president and the first woman...recently! 

But now, because Andrew Yang didn’t make the debate or Corey Booker dropped out, we‘re suddenly all racists, including all the black people, women, Asians, Hispanics, gays and lesbians who were polled and said they preferred Warren, Biden or Sanders? 

And I really think nitpicking diversity is much more a media obsession than a general public one. They love it, because it creates the appearance of conflict in an otherwise dull story about an unpopular candidate dropping out, or who got nominated for best director, etc. And I don’t think it’s harmless. It sows division where division need not exist, and reinforces identity politics in an artificial and unhealthy way."
Bass,fdtvu3i,t1_fdtuv9w,1578723040.0,"I can see that. I play guitar, and really enjoy figuring out and playing Peter’s parts, but feel like the real secret weapon of R.E.M. was Mike Mills bass playing."
Bass,fdtup46,t1_fdttipu,1578722502.0,What about “Life and How to Live It”? That song has an amazing bass track.

PoliticalHumor,fdlz1ay,t1_fdlhanr,1578535894.0,Exactly my thoughts. The guy is volatile enough without cable news people saying he’s perceived as weak for doing this and getting him stewing about that. We dodged a serious bullet here. Everyone should be grateful for that and stand down on this one issue.
cats,fdko3k1,t3_elv079,1578507607.0,Sorry for your loss. Eventually the pain will ease and you’ll be left with happy memories.

BlairWitchGame,fcy6u7s,t1_fcxqlif,1578075637.0,"Thanks for the reply! I figured out that the input lag was really a low frame rate problem. I guess my graphics card couldn’t handle running it at 4K. When I scale the resolution down to 1440p it runs fine and the lag disappears. I overestimated the power of my RTX 2070, it seems. In any case, it still looks pretty sharp at 1440p, so I’m satisfied with the trade off."
