RedPillWomen,fdp5zee,t3_emf4ly,1578620792.0,"First of all, am a male, and not precisely liberal. Also, i come from a traditional family, so am pretty familiarized with your situation.

Your husband is wrong, veeery wrong.

The fact that he's so bothered by your refusal of sex is kinda scary, that isn't rational at all, it shows that your wellbeing isn't a priority in his mind, ""if you can't pleasure him then you don't deserve to be happy"" basically, it's pure selfishness. 

Please, speak with him, tell him what happened. If he doesn't bother to understand then you should be careful. I hate doing this crap, reddit is full of ""psychologist"" and ""therapist"" that tell everyone that their partners are, in the best scenario, a time bomb psycho, or that they should get the divorce for some stupid fight, but this is different, you said that you are from a family were violence was thing, so probably you are kinda used to that behavior from the men ""in charge"", but that's not good at all, if he acts like this with something as normal as not being in mood for sex it could be dangerous in the long run. 

As i told you before, my family is very traditional, but this was never a thing. My father was always understanding and always thanked my mother's attitude with care and attention, this seriously bothers me. A woman who gives herself fully to his family, like my mother, deserves nothing but love, i hate the idea of a housewife being treated like a spoiled child, please, speak with him, try to snap him out of that attitude, if that doesn't  work, think of your options, for your well being."

shitpostemblem,fcjevvj,t1_fcjd99k,1577685112.0,"You are trying to avoid the fact that Edelgard was trying actively to conquer Fodlan as a whole. Of course, Edelgard didn't go all out against the alliance because many lords joined her side, attacking would be a waste of time when the lords were doing her dirt work. So yeah, she didn't declare war to the Alliance when she started the war, because she had support, in the moment she saw that, obviously, not all the Alliance was in the mood of giving up she started the military occupation in the borders. The same goes for Faerghus and Cornelia, saying that both the Kingdom and the Alliance entered the war because they wanted is delusional, even though, that's kind of the standard in Edelgard fans when it comes to defend her brutal methods. The end doesn't justify the means.

Ah, i almost forgot.

What you said doesn't change the fact that she indeed was the first to pronounce her intentions of conquest, that's what matters, not who attacked who first, because independently of who was the first aggressor, the one who caused it was Edelgard. Claude didn't attack the ""innocent"" empire for no reason, didn't he?"
