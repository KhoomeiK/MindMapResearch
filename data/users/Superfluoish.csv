There is zero science to back up anti-vaxxers. I understand it seems like you can’t force them to do anything they don’t want to, but it happens all the time for the public good. Seat belts are required by law when driving, you’re not allowed to drive drunk by law because of the potential of endangering others with irresponsible personal behavior. So, I disagree."

SandersForPresident,fcy76by,t3_ejj5ty,1578075799.0,"Holy shit, that sub is full of morons. 

In my mind, there is only one candidate to vote for, and it’s Bernard Sanders. As is so dutifully pointed out by everyone who doesn’t like him, he will have a hard, nearly impossible time passing the things he’s running on, however, the more middle of the road candidates with watered down policies will ALSO have the obstructionist Republican Party to deal with, and they’re going to make it just as hard to pass those shittier policies too. You don’t come to the negotiating table already giving in to the other side. Additionally, you need someone like Sanders who knows the right people to call out, and who will relentlessly go after those people using the bully pulpit. The fact that he cannot be bought by the truly evil puppet masters that run this country (the military/prison industrial complex, big pharma, health care companies, and fossil fuel companies) is THE reason to put him in office. I think a blanket of complacency has fallen over the eyes of the general public, but that people are starting to wake up and see that CLASS/MATERIAL interests are what should be driving politics, in a general sense. And when we start taking care of our citizens, making sure they have a good education, leveling the playing field as it were, you’re going to end up with a population that is hopefully more civically-minded, who can actually focus on the real ins and outs of what government is doing and who aren’t distracted so much by being poor and miserable, who just want to come home and veg out watching Netflix to be distracted from the dystopia that’s starting to occur all around them. 

It’s a matter of priorities. For far too long, the government has worked for the richest among us, because they have the money to influence policy, and also use the media to distract people from the real material issues that they should be concerned about. Bernie wants to change government back to representation for the masses, not the companies who can afford to drive policy. 

I probably left something out but that’s just a nutshell of why I am full-on supporting Bernie. He’s a real disruption to this fucked up system that has been a misery machine for anyone who’s not incredibly wealthy for the last 40 years, and he’s going to bring attention to that."
