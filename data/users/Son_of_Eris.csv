Otherwise, yeah, all we got is Create Bonfire and Hellish Rebuke."

They'll have to go through a lengthy and expensive research process if they actually want to discover and use any of the spells, but I think that'll be part of the fun.

At least until some idiot discovers Karsus' Avatar. But that will be an entirely different story haha."

""Bad fighter, bad!"" as the flames of his Hellish Rebuke sear the flesh of the fighter for 2d10 fire damage due to a failed reflex save.
Aleos the Great facepalms himself for 1d4 damage, as the Warlock's Fiend Patron laughs hysterically.

I'm actually currently writing a sideplot where a powerful magic user, who is absolutely furious that Mystra restricted the use of spells past the 9th lv, goes on a quest to regain his lost power/spells. It should be fun as long as my players don't try to fight any deities.

The working title is ""Welcome to the Wizard's (Hell)ball"""

However, there are few things I enjoy in life more than fucking with beaurocracy, so I'm going to tell you how to do it anyways.

Legally change your first name to ""Lord"". If you're in a state where you need to list a reason and have a judge's approval to grant the name change, read on.

First, find your local Discordian Cabal, Church of Satan, Church of the Subgenius, or any similar religion. 

Second, befriend them by not being a douchebag, if possible.

Lastly, list your recent religious conversion as a reason for the name change. Any minister (priest, etc) worth their salt will happily back you up.

If you want your driver's license to read ""Lord TheBananaHypothesis"" then let's make it happen, goddammit. Life's too short to take yourself seriously. DM me if you are serious (lol) about this and are unable to find a local religious organization to help you out. I can even provide you with a copy of a recently discovered sacred text about how all people should follow the example of the late, great Emperor Norton."

Just some ideas in case something happens to your door. Good luck with the escape!"

dndmemes,fd5c8k2,t3_ejy0u0,1578176170.0,"Ehh as long as house rules are consistant, no worries. But it's important to note when something isn't RAW, so that players aren't confused when things are different in another group.

On the rare occasion I, as a DM, modify a rule (usually after a lengthy discussion with the party), I write it down, number it, note the relevant page of the PHB or DMG and ask the party to pencil in the corresponding number on the relevant page in their PHB. Leads to less arguing, more playing in the future."

dndmemes,fcxiwri,t1_fcv3mhe,1578064058.0,"If we're using the writings of R.A. Salvatore as the primary source: he doesn't know any ranger spells, just the few spells all drow can inherently use. And his companion is the result of a little stone statue he found in... I wanna say somewhere in Menzoberranzan before he left the Underdark. Keep in mind the character was created around the time of ADnD2 (basically dnd 2e but its not quite that simple).

However, in the 5e PHB he is specifically mentioned as a Ranger, and indeed he does worship Mielikki in the books as well. So, the 5e Ranger Drizzt is extremely different from the Drizzt of the novels, which were written well before 5e came out.

In the books it also mentions he has his own ability similar to a barbarian rage, but it appears he can't control it or enter it on command. 

My ultimate point being, in the books, he is definitely a fighter, with several innate magical abilities and quite a few magical artifacts. In 5e, he's listed as a ranger, but that is vastly different from the character as described by his creator."

>The very definition of a Mind Flayer in D&D has a lot of baggage, it's really hard to believe one of them would be nice to people


You could say the same thing about Dark Elves, but Drizzt Do'Urden is probably the most well-known DnD character of all time. It's been a while since I read the books, but in 5e terms he's either a Neutral Good or Chaotic Good Dex based fighter that travels the world with a magical panther (from an artifact, he's not a druid or a ranger) fighting evil.

Some people may argue that he's Lawful Good, but that is in no way the point of my comment.

My point is that, imho, as long as any character/creature has free will (i.e. is not a construct, mind controlled, or extremely low int), you can easily just shift the alignment instead of throwing the baby out with the bathwater."

Maybe the party will get ambushed while they're closely scrutinizing the wall for the umpteenth time.

Maybe the wall will collapse, and fall on the party, dealing 2d12 bludgeon damage if they fail a reflex save.

Adapt and overcome. In my experience, it's better to let the players suffer consequences from doing banal shit than to try and railroad them into doing what you want.

Plus then, they're way more likely to be hesitant about closely examining things in the future.

I feel that the best DMs are able to *gently* steer the party towards advancing the story, without anyone getting pissed if things don't go according to plan."

Sometimes we, as humans, just need to fight it out and get the fuck over it.

If two consenting adults want to fight, it should be legal. We're adults, and as a result, we are theoretically old enough to understand the potential consequences of our actions.

Just stop the fight when one person is unconscious or taps out, and call it good. It's not a case of ""might makes right"", but it does encourage people to put their money where their mouth is, so to speak."
