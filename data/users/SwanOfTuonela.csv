BipolarReddit,ffz1dvs,t3_evxbg7,1580360836.0,"Good for you for getting sober, that’s no small thing. I just made a post about being in a major depressive episode, too. This has also been my worst ever. (Been diagnosed for over 10 years) I wish I had more to say, anything to say, in order to help console you. All I can tell you is, you’re so not alone."
BipolarReddit,ffyvwgv,t1_ffyvpvh,1580356468.0,Oh no ! Well I’m definitely paying attention. How long have you been in this particular episode ?
intj,ffyu20e,t3_eubim2,1580355137.0,"Honestly, I’m glad there are so many women here, as I’ve met only two* other INTJ females in person. It’s nice to actually encounter female INTJs in the wild. But, more generally, who cares ? In my experience, both male and female INTJs present very similarly, I generally note no differences (at least within this particular personality—It’s not particularly true otherwise, in my experience.) And if the women on here are genuinely INTJs, they won’t be offended by your post, because it’s not offensive."
intj,ffytu3u,t3_eutmgo,1580354980.0,"Linguistics, because I have a facility for languages."
intj,ffys17f,t3_evtzl5,1580353720.0,"As a fellow INTJ female who just joined this sub (I’ve taken a professional, official Meyers-Briggs test, I promise) I’m pleased to see that more of us do, in fact, exist. I’m mainly friends with other INTJs or INTPs (men). If they are female, they’re usually INFP, and they’re perfectly fine to deal with. We tend to gravitate towards and find one another based upon interests and professions."
intj,ffyr4f7,t3_eumfz8,1580353095.0,"INTJ-T here as well. I suspect the T has mostly to do with the fact that I am also Bipolar. When depressed or stable, my self-control tends to be excellent. When manic, well, all bets are off. Forgive me if hearing this on this sub is irritating... It’s an interesting existential position to be in, having  INTJ juxtaposed with Bipolar certainly makes life more colorful."
FemaleHairLoss,ffym811,t3_evog1n,1580349757.0,"My hair was super thick, too. I loved it because it was blonde and most blondes I know don’t have thick hair. I used to hate how much shampoo I would go through and how hot I would get underneath [my hair] in the summer. (That was dumb of me!!!) I feel for you extra hard because I think it’s even more devastating when you had more than the majority of humans and now you’ll have less. It’s hella tough. So sorry you have to endure this torture, too. You’re not alone!!!"
