The problem is urban, black culture places literally no value on educating yourself, obeying the law, making responsible choices, etc.  So they make literally no effort in school, and the ones that do are treated like race traitors by the rest.  Then, having pissed away every chance and opportunity given to them, and finding themselves bereft of opportunities and skills, convince themselves its because racism, or the system, or whatever other pathetic trash excuse for making really, really bad choices and now suffering the consequences of it.

Nope, they do this to themselves, and then instead of owning up to their own, personal failures, they cry racism and discrimination.  Fucking trash, they give blacks a very bad name in this country."

A far, far more apt comparison for the US would be India, which is also a multiethnic democracy with historical social issues that fall along lines like race and income.

funny,ff6mwqr,t1_ff6lhp9,1579630607.0,"I mean, if you really want to go there, by design, the votes you cast serve the main purpose of making you feel like a participant in the process.  From there, I suspect you miss the actual point of a republic: stability.  Everything else; rights, elections, constitutions, etc, are nothing more than a means to that end.  They have no inherent value, they are useful only as tools to promote stability.  

To that end, you are correct, there are some genuinely awful , terrible people who get elected.  I truly wish we would elect smarter people as well, but given what we've learned about the average voter, someone like Trump or Sanders or whatever flavor of populist you like will come along and tell those same uninformed people exactly what they want to hear.  Its just not possible, people behave irrationally and appealing to their biases is just too strong.

However, given that our system is about stability, not effective government, this isn't actually the flaw that many see it as.  Lets look at the past election: trump is a mess, I don't think many educated people will dispute that.  Despite being a mess, his election also represented the will of a large portion of the electorate, and that political will was legitimized by the election.  In other words, it was a pressure vent; even if Trump is a train wreck his election shows that the 'flyover states' aren't just the vassals of the coasts.  Its important for the stability of the nation that those people feel they have a voice, and that their voices are heard.  Even if they don't have any real power over anything, they feel like they do, and that will lead to civically productive behavior.

In other words, better a Trump, or Boris, or a AOC, or whoever, and all the mess that follows, than a autocrat that does the job far better but results in a large part of that poorly educated, angry electorate feeling disenfranchised and ultimately rebelling.

Its also why slavery caused a civil war, our system values stability over anything else.  Slavery was, in that framework, a worthwhile price to pay for stability.

Blunty, why should I, who have paid and worked to have the education I have, defer to the ignorant?  Especially given that this issue has been tracked in both media and popular science for over a decade, and there have been no shortage of opportunities to be informed.

I suppose you have to ask yourself: is it worth the time and effort to me to be informed?

Its ok to make that choice, on some level we all do, every day.  You can't know it all.  But when you make that decision, consciously or not, you must also accept then that you don't know, and that you asserting an opinion or having a voice is actively detracting from the discussion, and that intentionally or not you are injecting a set of ideas that are misguided at best and more often not only wrong but actively counterproductive.  I would refer you to the last several years of political dialogue as an example of what happens when the uneducated and uninformed feel to empowered to assert their ideas.  It turns into a populist mess, where the loudest voice is the truest.

Now, if there was a group of unrepentant Nazis that had committed genocide in living memory, were proud of it, declared themselves victims, and took every chance to continue killing minorities, would you, a minority that they have attempted to exterminate, just treat those genocidal nazis as any other group of people who are just victims of history?

Most republicans are by nature suspicious of Islamic societies as whole, and see Israels fight against terrorism as a parallel fight to the american fight on terrorism.  They generally consider Israel a useful and valuable ally for pragmatic reasons.  A small number of republicans are strongly pro israel because they are religious loonies who think the jews need to be in jerusalem for the end of the world to happen, or some such bullshit.

On the left, there is a small core of strong Israel supporters, a slightly larger group that holds their nose but supports Israel anyways, a majority that is antipathetic towards Israel, seeing them as right wingers and bigots, and a small minority of the left that is actively antisemitic and advocates for essentially Islamic expansion.

IRstudies,fd66hme,t1_fd5zpoo,1578186214.0,"Please, what world do you live in.  The JCPOA has been dead for years, and deserved death, as the Iranians took the money they had from the lifted sanctions and used it to finance militias in Iraq and Syria as opposed to domestic economic development.  Why should a deal that is directly enabling the destabilization of the middle east and ethnic cleansing be continued to the detriment of American interests?  Because a bunch of naive Europeans think that Iran can actually be incentivized to play fair?  They are a revolutionary government seeking to spread that revolution, that are acting in good faith about as much as the bolsheviks or maoists did.  To actually advocate for the JCPOA as anything other than a bad aftertaste suggests you aren't very up on all this.  'The internationally agreed upon plan'?  Why ever would the US give half a damn what some European leftist feels about American power being exerted to defend American interests?  They have literally no power over anything, the minute Europe can defend itself will be the minute Europe gets a seat and the grown up table and what they say will actually start mattering.  

Again, this is a soft power message to American allies that the US is actually willing to take risks to defend American allies and interests in the region, no matter why trump personally was motivated to push the button.  That is basically obvious to anyone who studies this stuff.  The only real debate was to the effectiveness; ironically for you the very risk it incurs holds the value; it shows rather well that the US is in fact willing to get messy with things in the ME if push comes to shove, which doubtless comes as a massive reassurance to countries like say Kuwait.  For them it wouldn't even be the first time in living memory.  You don't seem to understand the long term calculus at play here.

IRstudies,fd2s2el,t3_ejqfxd,1578151122.0,"Valid motivations, especially within the academic community there was a lot of discussion surrounding the calculus that a western leaning nation has used to ally themselves with the west; as a more multi-polar world order re-emerges, many nations are starting to re-examine their alliances and interests, looking to see if there is a better deal elsewhere.  Iran is well aware of this, and these strategy for the past several years has been to as much as possible make a mockery of American security assurances in the ME without actually crossing the line that would lead to hard retaliations.  This sends the message to regional American allies that American promises are hollow, and that the Americans are all talk, and don't have the guts to actually fight for their local allies.  The pattern of escalation that lead up to this juncture was one that went largely unresponded to by the US, which while avoiding escalation also erodes the soft power that the western led world order is underpinned by.

All things considered, this was actually a fairly deft move.  Retaliation had to come at some point, its very quickly come to the point of inflection in which avoiding escalation will cost more than escalation will, especially given there is no real desire for war in either country.  Killing Soleimani not only served to send a strong message to Iran, and far more importantly, the gulf states, but also reduced Iran's capacity to respond via proxies; given that Soleimani's whole game was financing and organizing foreign terror organizations to carry out Irans dirty work, it will be harder for Iran to now mobilize those forces to retaliate.  It also was a strategically useful move; Soleimani was a remarkably capable individual, and was quite successful in opposing western interests.  His death will impair that further.

Blunty as well, as someone who has lots of black friends: y'all are racist as fuck towards literally everyone else, especially asians and hispanics.  The shit I hear come out of the mouths of my black students about those other races, were they coming from a white, would be an immediate suspension.  There is a racist rot at the heart of many african american communities, and this spree of black on jewish hate crimes rather neatly proves my point.  Time to wake up and face the music."
