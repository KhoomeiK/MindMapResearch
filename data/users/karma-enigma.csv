dankmemes,feki81l,t1_fekhmbg,1579200581.0,I sure feel bad for the poor soul that gets you as a social worker. Theres something we can all agree on
dankmemes,fekh7cx,t1_fekg94u,1579199974.0,So now im overly sensitive? Do you go straight on the offensive everytime someone disagrees with you? All you're doing is repeating yourself and getting frustrated because nobody agrees. Screaming your opinions over an over arent going to make them any more true. Every comment you posted all had a tinge of hate in them. Maybe you should look in the mirror before judging others.
dankmemes,fekfp0k,t1_fekezye,1579199073.0,I never said it was. I'm being respectful and taking what you're saying on board. The point im making is when you talk the way you did it makes it difficult to take you seriously. What you're saying may or may not be true. But being shitty about it isnt going to get you any fans
dankmemes,feke1d1,t1_fekcpk8,1579198090.0,What you're saying may be true. Or it may not be. Its your opinion and you're entitled to have it. There is just better ways of conducting yourself my friend

Nootropics,fdhdeci,t3_eldytb,1578420365.0,What version do you take? The thing with ashwagandha is after long term use (about 3 weeks for me) it can make you seriously unproductive. Sure it helps with stress and anxiety. But after a while you just stop giving a shit and dont want to do anything. At least thats my experience and the same as a few others on this sub

StackAdvice,fcwqpru,t3_ejbhyx,1578033880.0,"There are many forms of magnesium. Magnesium Oxide is one you need to avoid. Ashwagandha is worth a try. Aswel as rhodiola rosea. There is a wealth of information online and in this sub reddit so you're in good company. I have some Alpha GPC and pinewood extract on its way. A new stack im trailing for anxiety motivation brain fog. So that stack consists of Alpha GPC, Pinewood extract, and rhodiola rosea"
howtonotgiveafuck,fcwp0dw,t1_fcwooj5,1578032156.0,Anger is almost hypnotic. If left unchecked it can take over someones life. People would justify their angry actions on external factors. But I think everyone is in charge of how they should act. What I mean is being angry is still no excuse to be mean to people. Easy to get caught up in it though. Because like I said. Anger is hypnotic
howtonotgiveafuck,fcwodar,t1_fcwibrr,1578031523.0,Sometimes crying is the best medicine. It can be difficult to put how one feels into words. But crying is a more natural way of releasing it. At least thats my take

howtonotgiveafuck,fcvhxyh,t1_fcuwa5u,1578002460.0,Thats a brilliant way to look at it. In that sense you could say there is no such thing as a wholly bad situation. Just different situations which help us to learn an grow in one way or another. Ever notice how some of the most kindest and humble people are the ones who have been through the harshest of hardships. I think difficult periods in life help strip away the ego and help us to grow. To be better. To be more than what we were.

StackAdvice,fcoyj0u,t1_fcoy5n7,1577845127.0,Yea life can get heavy sometimes. Its always good to look for new ways to improve an be better human beings. I have some Alpha gpc and pine wood extract on the way. I seen someone post about an ADHD stack which im going to try. Alpha GPC. Pinewood extract and rhodiola rosea. Might be worth a google or reddit search
StackAdvice,fcoxk5m,t1_fcowb76,1577844341.0,I'm the same. They told me 10 years ago I was just anxious and depressed. Gave me antidepressants which I think have just masked my symptoms. Quit them a year ago and now I'm feeling it fully. Can't concentrate. Restless. Cant sleep. No energy. No motivation. All the signs are there. I cant say whether or not you have ADHD. I dont even know if I have it. But its worth finding out! Because they might miss it and think its something else
