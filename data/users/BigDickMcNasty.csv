What I would do if I were you is wait for stadia base to launch. Which should be soon. Hopefully they have demoes for people to play and test but so far there's no word on that. Worst case, the refund system is very awesome. You can refund a game for any reason as long as you have played less than 2 hours total and within 2 weeks of purchase. So can try on your PC using an Xbox controller or something. Then you'll know for sure if it's for you. People can try stadia at absolutely no cost to them.

Stadia base is literally free. You just have to pay for games.

No console or gaming service is for everyone. But giving people access to a free console or way to play a game is pretty awesome. I'll be broke ass soon so it'll allow me to hold off on ps5 and series x for a few years so that's nice lol"
gaming,fdiidwk,t1_fcyss6x,1578443598.0,"That's literally the only thing holding streaming services like stadia and xcloud back, IMO. Some places don't have them but I do and it sucks 

Not everyone puts in 40+ hour gaming weeks though so it's still very much doable. For me it is anyways but I had to look at how much data I was using vs how much I game. Also keep in mind with stadia you don't have to download games or updates. For some games that could be 100gb+ which equates to a lot of time spent in game. Also stadia allows you to set how much bandwidth you want to use so if you're ok with 720p you can do that. I'm sure xcloud will be the same way hopefully."
