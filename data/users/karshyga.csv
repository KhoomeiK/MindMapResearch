CPTSD,ffapqnf,t3_esg26i,1579741607.0,"I freeze something fierce and man does it fuck with me, but if you have the access and the means, I highly recommend aikido. I'm not particularly good at it, and there have been more than a few classes that I have ended up a dissociated weepy mess, but I always feel better than I came in by the end of class. Most dojos I've been to, people are unfazed by any intense emotions that come up, it's just accepted as part of the learning process, nobody makes a big deal about it. It's more about learning how to deal in situations of conflict with self-discipline, and not so much about beating someone's ass. I love it a lot."
CPTSD,ffaoeda,t1_ff9z2w2,1579740706.0,"I really love this idea as a freeze type. Turtles are tough, resilient badasses that are most worthy of admiration. I work in wildlife rehabilitation, and they are able to survive harsh conditions and heal from injuries that would put most animals out of commission. Sea turtles can be released back into the wild missing a flipper and they can make it out there just fine. They may not be fast, but they've been at this gig a couple hundred million years. They figured this shit out ages ago."

The '97 anime of Berserk is decent as far as getting the main story down, although the animation is pretty rough, the first episode is kind of wtf, and the opening credits are hilariously wtf. The 2016/17 is an unholy melding of 2D and CGI, I would avoid it where at all possible. /end weebrant"

witcher,fdzo8z0,t3_endgt0,1578792381.0,"I was not familiar at all with the Witcher series before watching, and I would agree with you for 2 out of 3. If Netflix's intent was to frustrate new people who want to like the series into picking up the books, then they may have succeeded. 

The timeline is a hopeless clusterfuck, even after watching it through multiple times. A little extra makeup and wardrobe would have gone a long way to reflect the passage of time and the age of non-witcher/non-mage characters. They could have easily gone the 'x y z years from x y z significant event' route, too. It's disappointing for such a significant part of the storytelling to be handled so carelessly, especially since it's a story so many people already love. 

Even more than a timeline, I felt like I needed a map. Names of kingdoms and geographical features were tossed around with little sense of where they were in relation to each other. How large or small are these kingdoms? How powerful or insignificant are their rulers? It was apparent that there were politics between these places, and that mages were somehow key, but there wasn't a clear relationship of how or why any of this was important until omg Nilfgaard is invading Cintra?! Wait, why? I think it has something to do with Ciri...? I'm still not 100% sure.

The relationship between Geralt and Yennefer felt rushed and forced, but to be fair, it felt the same with Renfri (and any other person who had to interact with Geralt for that matter). He seems stoic and not the kind of guy to stick his dick in crazy,  but maybe it made more sense in the books.  

I can tell that the story is going somewhere, even if I'm not sure where that is yet. There's enough to interest me that I want to know, and enough time between now and season 2 that I'm going to check out the books in order to find out.  That said, I did not expect to work this hard to like this series."

If you are in need of brainbleach, there's a great story on there called Earls Just Wanna Have Fun, and another fun one about Ciel attempting to make breakfast by himself. Finny fluff is generally wholesome too if you like cinnamon rolls."
