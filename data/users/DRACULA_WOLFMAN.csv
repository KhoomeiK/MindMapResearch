The GB team has a funny relationship with the series, so seeing Jan nerd out over it while Ben tries not to outright mock it is kind of the selling point.

giantbomb,ffdsaa8,t3_et2g5a,1579827668.0,"I'm not a big FF fan, but I did enjoy FF9 a great deal, so I think I'm with you in wanting to see a return to a proper fantasy setting. I think it's about time they take a step back with the combat too and give turn-based another shot. They tried something different with FFXV's combat and that's admirable I suppose, but at best it was boring and at worst it was outright terrible. I think the franchise needs to return to it's roots in more ways than one. 

But also who knows if we're going to see FFXVI anytime soon, because presumably they're going to be working on the other parts of FFVII for many, many years. They surely have multiple teams, but for a numbered entry you'd think they would put the main team on it and I get the impression that the A-team is on FF7."

I know what you're thinking: ""but why don't you just binge all of the drip-fed content then?""

However, I don't really mind them destroying the Enterprise D for a new one. I get the need for a flashier new set for the films. I just wish they had done it in a better way, because frankly it's absurd that a single bird of prey could take down the Federation flagship. The bridge crew had to actively forget how to fight in order for them to lose, and if you watch that battle again you'll see what I mean. 

The other thing I wished they had done was account for recovering all of the cool things that the Enterprise had collected over the years. I know Picard's flute shows up again and Data finds Spot miraculously, but what about all of the cool archaeological finds? What about Moriarty? Lore's disassembled parts? I guess it'd be weird to call it all out at the end of a movie, but that kind of stuff is important to Trekkies. I dunno how, but I wish all of that legacy had been accounted for."

It really does amaze me that they put so much effort in to that game and made such an incredible RPG in many ways and then completely half-assed it on the UI and shipped it that way. UI design is probably pretty difficult (and I definitely don't know because I don't make games,) but Bethesda is huge. They're bound to be able to find someone who's good at it, right?"

smashbros,fesh4xi,t1_feprn4s,1579365034.0,"Also Super Mario RPG doesn't really hold up compared to it's successors. I just never got the hype for it, it's such a cakewalk and there's very little strategy involved in the combat (which could be said of most Square RPGs, honestly.) All the M&L games are light years ahead of it as well as the first two Paper Marios, but hey, it did come up with the concept of a Mario RPG with timing-based inputs, so kudos for being first at least. I would think Fawful would be a better representative from Mario RPGs. He's been in more than one game at the very least and fans of the series like him quite a bit."

Might be a Street Fighter vs. Smash Bros. issue for me, where I could never really get the hang of the command inputs in normal fighting games but Smash just feels great from the get go and only gets better with time.

Games,feo1wnh,t1_feo0rc6,1579294068.0,"Vermintide 2 is a more melee focused, fantasy Left 4 Dead with some RPG elements. It's not a perfect game - the DLC additions have ranged from lackluster to outright terrible and the developers have a knack for breaking their own game over and over, but at its core it still has probably the most satisfying first person melee combat I've had the pleasure of experiencing. The only issue now is that there aren't a lot of new or low level players because the game has been out for a fair bit, so if you're starting out without a group of friends you might have a difficult time getting in to it. It's definitely the best L4D successor I've played despite it's flaws and I do feel like it improves on Valve's series in a number of ways. Worth checking out if you're really jonesing for some L4D type action."

I think the Castlevania anime is the perfect example of a game that adapts well to television. The series is dripping with style and the backstory is fleshed out, but the games have almost no story themselves. The game's plot is hollow, thus it allows the writers to fill in the plot in a way that works for television without feeling like it's less than it's source material. It's supplemental in the best way without feeling like a poor imitation or adaptation."

[SCP-093](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-093) is my definitive favorite (be sure to read the tests at the bottom.)"
Warframe,fcuemqt,t1_fctyl9p,1577979126.0,"It seems like her abilities were made for a different game. They just don't gel with what you're typically asked to do in Warframe. She isn't completely useless, but compared to the competition she sure feels that way."

giantbomb,fcrz2gv,t3_eikcbu,1577908704.0,"As a fellow person who loves Dragon's Dogma and wants a sequel, I have to say it. Life is just easier if you stop believing and let the dream die. I learned that the hard way with Half-Life 3, so coming to terms with the lack of Dragon's Dogma 2 was a much easier pill to swallow.

Also, I'm pretty surprised that Control didn't make his list. Seems like he'd be way in to the FBC."
startrek,fco0krc,t3_ei6vme,1577821920.0,"I suppose it's like a best case scenario version of communism, but really, I'm not sure any of those qualify since there isn't currency at all within the Federation. People just get what they need and much of what they want, free of charge. Other civilizations do use currency (most notably the Ferengi) and Federation citizens do need to acquire wealth in order to trade with them, but that's only if they're trying to obtain something the Federation cannot provide for free."

startrek,fclm09o,t3_eht6s9,1577750926.0,"Eh, Saru's survival instincts are pretty tame compared to the full-on telepaths that Betazoids are. There are a lot of less powerful telepathic races throughout Trek, too. Magic is *really* common in the Trek universe - Discovery isn't any worse about that. I agree that the red angel stuff turned out to be a mess, but I felt that they did a good job of explaining the spore drive in a way that fits in to the canon."
giantbomb,fckqqgr,t3_ehnxrd,1577731146.0,"That seems like a discussion that would belong in Hottest Mess (which I'm aware didn't happen.) The categories they did discuss were all about the merits of the games themselves, not the controversies surrounding them. So basically, as important as that issue is, it's off topic when they're strictly debating the quality of a game and how that quality stacks up against other games. That's my two cents, anyways."
