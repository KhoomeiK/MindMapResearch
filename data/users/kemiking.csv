AskReddit,feqbigm,t1_fept9j7,1579339803.0,Avicii was my most disappointing show. At the time I was pretty upset and thought the whole thing was total bullshit. He basically just played his album and stood there. No mixing or interaction with the audience. He died a year or so and it was just a kick in the balls.

gaming,fdmg388,t3_em56r8,1578548723.0,"I played it non stop for a few days, then just forgot about it. I loved the dialogue and plot,l and world. 
There were a few major problems that they’ve since fixed, like text size being utterly unreadable. I also really struggled with the fact that there wasn’t a way to set a waypoint on the map. When there were quests with multiple objective points, I found myself accidentally following the wrong one getting more and more lost in buildings. 
I also found myself longing for some of the fallout mechanics like throwables and mines, ability to pick up objects, and for the ability to jump."

AskReddit,fcjn8i5,t1_fcgq1as,1577694889.0,"This is what I was looking for. Smoking weed before bed effects dreaming, which is a huge component of memory consolidation (saving short term memory into long term memory). I’ve never found any studies on this, but I’ve always found it true that I had trouble getting down new materials in school when I smoked before bed. If weed interferes with dreaming, and interferes with memory, then it stands that you’re going to have trouble solidifying those memories in your sleep if you have weed in your system."

educationalgifs,fc4q73l,t1_fc4kx70,1577424464.0,"~26g I believe is the most recent number. But that changes depending on who you ask and how much money sugar companies put into lobbying recently. There isn’t really a good recommended amount, because your body doesn’t require any straight up sugar. You get all your body’s required sugar in the form of carbs, fruits and veggies. Everything else is just empty calories."
