Theres not really a way to avoid helping a  candidate, just like there's not really a way to avoid having a political stance on any issue.

It's kinda like that Elie Wiesel quote:

>Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented.

Not that I think Biden is an oppressor by any means, but you get the gist."

Yep. They will definitely do that."

Just stream whatever you feel interested in streaming.

I imagine it's more than in half vertically and horizontally, ie 2x2, but I also imagine it is a little useless at like 1920x1080 lol. Just curious to kinda get an idea of how you managed. Looks great though, you definitely are great at this"
Twitch,ffbor2c,t1_ffbg8xq,1579776131.0,"I believe the person controlling the bots is attempting to build up normal viewing activity for the accounts, which they then sell their viewbot services to other streamers. That's the only thing that's ever made sense to me, especially since absolutely nobody has ever been banned by being targeted with random twitch botting like this."

comicbooks,fer5qd3,t1_feq35ct,1579350128.0,"and if you want some real fun stuff, fucking famed artist Moebius (Jean Giraud) did a silver surfer story! it's credited as done with Stan Lee, but in true Stan tradition, it was mostly a rough outline and Moebius did all the art, panels, etc and then Stan went back to do the dialogue. Thing wona  fucking Eisner award and is absolutely unlike anything you'd expect from a Stan Lee written comic.

I mean, the surfer is introduced to us as a street bum getting hassled by police, and the cover isn't even a super action shot that'd be typical! 

Silver Surfer: Parable, for anyone interested. it's real short and real good."

So it irks people like me (who has been fighting it for over a decade of medications/therapists/psychologists) to see stuff like this that essentially trivializes it."

A shitty modem+router combo is a bitch to troubleshoot compared to just having a nice wifi router and a nice cable modem, costs about the same, will be easier to troubleshoot, annnnd if one fails (let's be honest, it'll be the modem. I've never seen a router fail without milk involved.) you only have to replace that bit and not have to set EVERYTHING up from scratch.

Anyone who ever had a TV/VCR combo but knows shit all about networks or tech should understand what I'm getting at."
