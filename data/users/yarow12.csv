There's a thing call ""deepfakes"" that are porn videos with celebrity faces replacing the faces of the actual people in them. I've browsed ~10 different clips (for science of course) and only ~3 looked easily noticeable. Some were very believable. JustKiddingNews did a video in the technology itself (not the porn part) a few years ago. A quick Bing has filed me and I'm not scrolling through playlists to find it.

Speaking from experience:  
I *choose* not to speak properly unless I absolutely feel like it or feel like I *have* to, and I've noticed some (~30%) people showing a lack of respect in my direction. It's almost always passive-aggressive (e.g.: deliberately not looking at me during group conversation even when I talk, heavily implying I should speak properly, etc.). Every now and then, it's closer to directly aggressive (e.g.: ""*some* people don't annunciate"" \*looks directly at me*, ""can you annunciate?!"", etc.). Shit's annoying. They're usually European-American. I mentally add them to my ""fuck off"" list.
