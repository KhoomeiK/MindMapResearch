Grades 4-6 i was terrorised by a bully (this was after being emotionally and physically abused by a teacher in Grades 1 & 2--another tale for another time). He was the new kid at school and I had a crush on him. Anyway, terrorised me during breaks, would chase me off the property after school, name calling, ganged up on etc. We lived in an affluent area and our elementary school was surrounded by some private schools so I'd always be able to get away and hide. I saw his mom pick him and his sister up one time and she was driving a Jag and looked like she pole danced. Things toned down in Grade 7. 

In comes high school and I barely saw him. Grade 11 turns out our lockers are right next to each other. I immediately think oh my god, here we go again. One day he came up to me and gently pulled my lips into a smile and said you should smile more, you have a pretty smile in front of his group and then they wandered off. After I made sure I exited the Twilight Zone, I didn't know how to process it. Seriously. I was the chubby girl. I didn't fit into one group because I associated with all of them. Yet he was in the ""bad"" group and nobody messed with them. I was so confused at what had happened. 

I found out the following year through chatter that he and his sister were/had being sexually abused by their dad and their mom was a whole other story. I now know he was lashing out because of that. I often wonder what became of them even 30 years later.

He's done 7 tours and most likely has PTSD. How long ago were you diagnosed with MS? He probably doesn't have any coping mechanisms and is lashing out because he can't deal with the thought of losing you to MS or watch you deteriorate...or losing you at all. All he's known is how to be tough and the military life and he can't get his emotions in check because a lot of the time they're hard to deal with, if that makes sense. The easiest emotion is anger and a lot of people use that as a coping and defense mechanism. Again, does not excuse anything he's  done or said to you and you definitely deserve better.

Growing up we had an old wine barrel that had a slit in the top for coins. Always fascinated me because there was no way to get into it without cutting it open. 

We would toss in loose change occasionally over the years just to lighten the pockets. Fast forward about 15 years. It moved to two houses. Rolled more like it. Final house dad said leave it, I said hell no. Cut the damn thing open and I'll get to sorting. 

I called my nearest bank, explained the situation and they said as long as everything was rolled we could bring it in. A week later I was done rolling, separating, and counting. Called dad. Umm.. dad.. I need some help moving these rolls. It's around 600 dollars. 

It was hilarious going into the bank since I called to let them know ahead of time and the whole story. We were celebrities for 15 minutes."

sewing,fe5bwaz,t3_enmvkb,1578867451.0,"Hi everyone, new to this subreddit. I mostly quilt for others and hand make items. 

What I came to ask is people around the world are sewing and knitting up a storm to make pouches and mittens for animals affected by the wildfire. May I post a link to the organization's Facebook site? I don't know if it's breaking the rules because I'm not self promoting.

Edit: update. They've put a pause on accepting new items while they do inventory."

It's 4:53 am on the West coast and I can't sleep. I have stretched, I have meditated, I have passed gas at both ends, I'm breathing in and out, I'm mentally going to my happy place yet I still can't sleep. Frustrated. Time to suck on some benadryl. 

As for the question, anything to do with my hands. First it was scrapbooking, now it's cards. Unfortunately my friend taught me how to make shaker cards and I have glitter from 2 years ago hanging around my bedroom even though I made the cards in the living room! Glitter is known as the herpes of the craft world. 

Then I got involved with a rabbit rescue and now I'm constantly making things for them to sell. Right now it's felt embroidered rabbits with some beading that I will turn into magnets. I'm waiting for my bunny die cuts to come in so I can start making cards. I just feel good working with my hands and helping others. 

Maybe that's why I'm always late and should stay on the cleanup crew! Lol"
