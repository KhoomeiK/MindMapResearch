We’re creating an environment we simply aren’t fit for. Humans are going to start dying off en masse at the equator as droughts spread towards greater latitudes. 

That will drive those who can afford it towards the poles where we’ll have to brave extreme weather events to continue surviving. 

Climate change is very much a human problem. We aren’t adapted for that harsh of environments."

As in, unless you were also a Congress person, Medal of Honor recipient, Tribal leader (or Inuit in general), or had some other wild background, your career (or lack thereof) as a pro athlete should be your focus. 

I’ve read it can give anywhere from a 5-10 point LSAT boost depending on the sport and what your career looked like. 

I’d be very curious to hear your story so if you want me to review your PS when the time comes, I’d be stoked to."
