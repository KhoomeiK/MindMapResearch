But before even going to accutane I’m going to try and fix certain habits, I’m gonna cut out sugary stuff and sleep more and TRY to stop touching and picking my face. when I did all those 3 things years ago, my skin was completely, perfectly clear haha"

Started it maybe a month ago??? it changes hormone receptors, but it’s not like bc. I just think bc is unnatural and I’d rather not have it, at least not right now. I don’t think there is less physical and mental side effects with bc vs accutane. I’ve heard a lot of negative stuff about bc and I don’t want anything to do with it. I would only go to it after trying everything else"

Keep loading and not saving, eventually it will make something trigger. You can even do this to make the love bubble appear. also, If you see a love bubble on a character you aren’t trying to put in a relationship, close it without saving and reload.

blunderyears,ffaw3y4,t1_ffavntk,1579745850.0,"I completely understand what u mean by perception changing. however, in my personally experience it’s weird. Children 6-14 think I’m 14 or 15 at most. Kids 16-18 think I’m around my age. But when I ask people older than me, they think I’m old. Hell, I was a stranger at a party months back, and although I was the youngest there everyone thought I was older than them. I received 22, 25, 27, when I just turned 17 a month before. Middle age people also I’m in college or already graduated out of college."

Even if I imagine him with a current haircut, he still looks old to me. Comparing him to students in my class, even with the new haircut in mind, he looks a whole 10 years off from them.

Growing up, seniors always looked old to me, I’m talking 25-30. However these past few years nearly everyone is baby faced, no one looks their age. It has always puzzled me."

The scholarship deadline for my #1 college ended December 1st.... I hadn’t even applied at that time, let alone apply for scholarships. kind of hate myself for it but nothing I can change now. 

I am undecided, so that’s why I thought going to community would give me more time to settle on what I might want to do. I’ve been considering an array of fields. A lot of them take 11-13 years of school, and I don’t think I’m capable of commuting to that, so I rly wanted to get my bearings before throwing myself into campus life"
scholarships,fepin0r,t1_feowmjy,1579321468.0,"Around $23k including rooms books and all other fees. if I attended community college it would be around $5k. 

If I went two years to the cc that would save me $10k, but then I’d end up transferring to a university, possibly the one that gave me the scholarship. So I have no clue what is better for me. 

I’m just kind of petrified on attending uni so soon. Lots of stressors in my life atm."

depression,fei5wz8,t3_ep4bw6,1579130988.0,"Same. Ive dodged death so many times, I’m pretty sure I was supposed to die when I was 14 drowning by in the ocean, but I survived. Now I feel like I’m seriously living in a parallel universe, or I’m in a coma and it’s all a dream. I’m waiting for when god descends from heaven above to tell me ‘sike that was all a prank back to your regularly scheduled programming.’  somewhere down the line I opened pandoras box that wasn’t supposed to be opened or tipped over a trash can or said the wrong thing to someone, and that little fluke caused a butterfly effect, so now I’m living in a parallel universe where everything is SHIT that I wasn’t supposed to live in.. 

I mean, I went from so many parties, driving a golf cart along white sands and city lights until 12 am, getting drunk on the beach with my closest friends and living my absolute best life to LIVING MY WORST LIFE E V E R. within the same month filled with the most memorable and exciting time of my existence, my mother was diagnosed with a rigorous, terminal cancer and my best friend of 5 years left me, saying I was the worst person she’s ever known. I went from sky high to rock bottom within 30 days. This all happened in the span of me being 17, which I still am right now. 

Now I have no one to talk to. I no longer leave the house. The months just fly by and there’s nothing I can do. I was thrown into this hell hole and now I only see darkness ahead.... I don’t think this was supposed to happen, but I guess it’s ‘all in gods plan’, right? I even consulted occultists asking if I had a curse on me because this is just so surreal and unbelievable.

depression,feeiloh,t3_eojiuf,1579034491.0,"I am good at hiding how terrified I am of socialization,  I try to constantly make everyone laugh or I just act outright stupid. a lot of the times my jokes make everyone laugh but the ones that fall absolutely flat haunt my dreams...... I just think ‘why did I say that that was the dumbest thing ever’ and it follows me for days. I have severe social anxiety, and A couple years ago I used to plot out everything I would say to my closest friends at the beginning of the day. I would wake up and practice how I would talk because I was so horrified of communicating. It was a pain, and I’d tear myself up when I often delivered things and stumbled on words. I still stumble and jumble my words and a lot of the time I have to keep trying to say a sentence from the beginning over and over again , but by the time I get it out I lose people’s attention. 

I’ll never forget 2 years ago when my anxiety was at its worst and an old friend of mine told me ‘you’ve changed, you’re not the same Sarah I’ve always known. You used to make jokes effortlessly and made everyone laugh and now it’s like you’re emotionless and a completely different person’    And that only made my anxiety worse lol. 

My ex best friend who wasnt all that good of a friend told me the boy I had a crush on said he thought I had aspergers...... then I asked him and he said he didn’t,., still don’t know what to believe. but it hurt my feelings so much lol
