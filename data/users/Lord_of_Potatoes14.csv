You're fighting over the point that ""he will suffocate before he freezes"". 

Cool. That's true. That's also not what i'm fighting you for you mudhead. I'm fighting over the ""you can't freeze if you're buried in snow as long as you're alive and breathing"" mindset of yours.

>I never said he was in a pit

We're speaking about tree wells. It was confirmed by the original commentor. A natural snow pit surrounding a tree trunk and camouflaged by branches. This is literally the comment you originally replied to. You can't be this stupid.

>but I did say if he could breath his clothes will retain his heat well enough to keep him from freezing because the snow around him will protect him from the elements.

Literally the [Second Law of Thermodynamics](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/rocket/thermo2.html). I repeat myself here: Snow can act as an insulator to protect you fron the environment. **SNOW DOES NOT PROTECT YOU FROM SNOW**. No amount of specialized wintergear can prevent melted snow from entering the gaps in your clothes and shoes if you're completely trapped in it. 

Heck, even if we don't take the resulting cold water as a variable by assuming you're completely waterproof, you're a human. Not a nuclear reactor. Your body can't produce enough heat to melt all the snow around you. 

KEEP IN MIND, Mr. Survivalist McWinter, that as long as you're in contact with snow you'll keep losing heat. It's a 37°C squishy body in winter clothes trapped in squared meters of snow at <=0°C. You're not going to win against the nature.

ALSO keep in mind, Dr Expert Physicist, that there's [no perfect insulator in existence](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/269250/is-perfect-thermal-insulation-possible), which is why even the best gears for snow won't keep you from losing heat. 

Slow but steady, you'll freeze to death (assuming you haven't died from asphyxiation but of course you will say ""hAH i WaS rIgHt BeCauSe i SaiD ThIs BeForE!!"". Please don't bring this up because as i said before this is not the topic i'm discussing here. Don't make a fool of yourself here)

>The snow WILL absorb his heat, but since it doesn't conduct it fast enough that he will freeze before he replaces it.

[Here you go](https://curiosity.com/topics/at-the-same-temperatures-why-does-water-feel-colder-than-air-curiosity/). You'll have better chances of getting hypothermia if you're buried in snow than standing in the open air. **This. Is. A. Fact.** No amount of your bullshit can change this.

>. But since he is trapped he is now in danger of starving to death. 

You need to stop watching survival shows. In this scenario, either you suffocate, freeze or escape. There's no scenario where you survive trapped inside a tree well for days.

>If I fell into the pit described by another commenter, as night came I would dig a small cave to get out of the air.

You are skiing/snowboarding, you fall into a tree well. You get immobilized by the snow arround you. You can't move your feet due to the skiis/snowboard and you can't move enough to remove them. Chances are you're upside down, tired and hurt by the time you're finally reach the bottom. You have minutes before the hypothermia/asphyxiation symptoms start to kick in. You need to get OUT of there, not plan how to survive the fucking night you absolute moron.

>In none of those cases is his death caused by the cold. 

I can feel the stupidness emanating from you all the way to where i live.

>If he got himself trapped someplace where he was exposed to elements, he probably will freeze to death. Because the flowing air will take his stored heat away.

The fact that you understand how exposing yourself to the cold takes your heat away yet keep saying you won't lose heat while buried in snow is beyond me.

>You have no idea what you are talking about.

You have the highest chance to get an award for writing the best documentary on bullshit i've ever seen."

Whatcouldgowrong,ff503dm,t1_ff4zo7y,1579576654.0,I read it. It's nonsense. I've read everything you've said here and you sound like the antivaxxer of snow. It's like you read about igloos in 5th grade and considered yourself the greatest meteorologist/physicist/survivalist of all times.
Whatcouldgowrong,ff4yf34,t1_ff3tvn7,1579575450.0,"You do know you can still get cold in an igloo if you're in direct contact with the ice walls or the floor, right?

The term ""trapping the heat"" just means that you increase the air temperature inside the igloo when you breathe, because the snow-sealed ice walls **prevents the cold air from outside in, and prevents the warm air out**. Not having to breathe some chilly air is what helps you keep warm. In no way does this mean the snow itself can keep you warm. Hell, sleeping directly on the ground can kill you from hypothermia if it's under 10°C outside.

Anyone with common sense can tell that literal frozen water particles under 0°C can suck the heat out of you faster than you can say ""popsicles"". Also, the mere thought that the human body can generate enough heat to keep itself warm when surrounded by metric tons of sheer snow is ridiculous. It's like trying to melt an iceberg with a box of matches or trying to cool the sun with some ice cubes."
