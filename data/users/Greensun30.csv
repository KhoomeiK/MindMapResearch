Any Supreme Court precedent that defines what ""try"" means would be binding. The Court may break precedent as they are the Supreme Court and the final interpretators of the Constitution and the laws of the US. A textualist approach would probably work best with the current makeup of the Court. I think the concurring opinion is correct but the issue must be adjudicated to end this sham of a trial by the GOP."

By stage 6 you don’t need a team to take out bosses and you can clear super quick. I like having at least 3 hooves or energy drinks by stage 4 and I’ll prioritize that over damage.

Please and I mean please try to think without interjecting your personal beliefs. Let the facts guide you to the conclusion.

ror2,fep9fj8,t1_feouxiv,1579315110.0,"I probably got carried away but I have nothing else to do so here you go. There’s a “TLDR” at the bottom 



I like to think that I’m pretty good at this game and I would only say that about this game. I have all the skins and an absurd amount of hours on every character. I think most of the Youtubers suck at Risk of Rain bc they lack creativity.  If you want to be good on anyone — push what you believe is possible. That item combo someone else said sucks? Figure out how to make it good and I promise you, you can. 


For Huntress It’s important to remember that her greatest asset is movement speed. She is the only character that can sprint and shoot. The reason that she has aim lock is because your main focus isn’t shooting. Your main focus is positioning. Flowing in between enemy attacks. Trying not to get hit. If you get low, run. 


Her base utility skill is an escape but it’s important to use it in relation to the terrain around you. To better position yourself.  Her second utility skill is, in addition to the previous one (minus the elevation change), is to aid your dodging. Remember your goal is to focus on dodging. Sprinting helps with that but you don’t have long range, you have to stay in that range, and you have to flow. Imagine an anime character strafing in between enemy attacks. That’s what you’re doing with her second utility skill. 


She has great mob control and excels in 1v1’s BUT you have to remember your enemies attacks and use the terrain well. It’s all about your positioning. You want to cover that weakness with CC items like stun grenade. But early on get that movement speed ASAP. I like having at least 3 hooves or energy drinks. I can do without for awhile but unless I get a god run amount of damage I will get one shot at some point. 


By flowing through attacks I mean that you should both keep your distance and know when to be in close. The closer you are the easier it is dodge. But you have to know your enemies attacks. Don’t be afraid to get up close and personal with a titan. Even if he has a laser out. You can out maneuver it. Don’t be afraid to push what you think is possible. The reason why I think most Youtubers suck is, from what I’ve seen, they think a character is meant to be played in a certain way and you must have certain items and without those items you won’t have fun. 


Half of Risk of Rain is playing the cards your dealt. The other half is how you play the character. Stay essential to that but you have to adapt your character on the items you find. That’s why Commando is hard and the first character because the lesson he teaches you is the most important fundamental. And that’s to take risk. Don’t play it safe. Push yourself and the character you play to it’s limits. Be creative with the items you have. Be creative with every ability. 

Reread every ability. Even if you think you know it, sometimes a fresh look will help that creativity. Take what you learned on one character and try it on another. Every character teaches a new fundamental. A mastery of that character is a mastery of that fundamental. 


I hope I didn’t come across as snobby or elitist. I’m confident in my ability, that’s what I wanted to get across. I hope this helped you in any way and if it didn’t please let me know so I can learn from it. I could make a visual guide but idk how to do that stuff. I also wouldn’t mind doing some runs with you if you thought that would help. 



•TLDR•

Your primary focus is movement, you have auto aim, focus on not getting hit, get movement items first, once you’re comfortable stack damage. Bears are only necessary if you plan on getting hit."
