polyadvice,feldwol,t3_ee276r,1579219892.0,"My feeling is that poly is not for sensitive people. And my therapist agrees. Poly is a fancy word for *i can’t bear to be committed to one person because I’m boring, afraid, and dense."

In my experience, a man is brought up unquestionably believing in his male privilege, regardless of whether or not he suffers from the above referenced qualities. 
He could be the type that respects women because he was raised by a caring mom whom he loves.

On the other hand, he could be a *smart man  (who hates his mother), and has figured out that if he fakes having these qualities, he can lure women into having sex. This is the scariest type of man, and sociopathic in a way, so be in the lookout."

FemaleDatingStrategy,fc16dab,t3_efg3cj,1577309542.0,"I agree. Polyamory is for cowards in our current society. (It worked in older cultures (American Indians for example), but that’s because they were obviously socialized quite a bit differently than we are in modern times). 
In 2020 it’s perfect for men who don’t have the balls (quite literally) for intimacy. Instead of facing this, they can conveniently label themselves as polyamorous and  feel cool, justified, and entitled. Women can be the same way. The only good thing about being open to polyamory is that it helps intimacy-avoidant men meet intimacy-avoidant woman, and then they can torture  each other. Leave the rest of us out of it. 
Polyamory is for the men who enjoy sending/posting random dick pics, and for women who need to post pics of their vagina’s. As if they’re being so rebellious and subversive (they’re not). 
In reality this behavior is simply just boring. Hugely B O R I N G. People who do this think that they’re expressing body positivity. They’re expressing the opposite : sexual frustration, and neediness. 
Those aren’t qualities to be ashamed of, but hiding behind the wall of polyamory in order to justify posting your ugly ass dick or vagina is for cowards"
