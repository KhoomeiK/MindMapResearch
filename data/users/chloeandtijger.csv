If you can afford the additional expense then take all three.  And if you choose not to take all three don’t feel bad. After all, the third kitty may go to a house with other pets that love it or perhaps end up alone but loving it even more."

catcare,fe1b067,t3_enipn4,1578824528.0,"Same as previous comments, play with his/her paws daily pushing the cushion softly and touching the claws.  This worked wonders with mine and I can play with their paws, look into their ears, open their mouths and carry them for up to 10 minutes before I get tired (cus they never do).  Wait for a moment or relaxation and not while kitten is active and going bonkers.  When he/she goes to sleep is best."
CatAdvice,fe1a4pv,t3_enk9aq,1578824291.0,"Double sided tape helped me with my previous cat, after a couple of weeks she stopped.  There is a tape specific for training cats (you donâ€™t want the tape to be super sticky either ðŸ˜‰).  For my kittens I used eternal patience, after three weeks of constantly putting them back on the floor and giving them zero attention or praise they learnt to not jump on the table anymore...got bored I guess.   

Please donâ€™t use spray bottles, cats are not so stupid as to not understand that you are the one spraying them, he/she will just learn to jump on the counter when you are not around."
CatAdvice,fe0m7mb,t1_fdzeh8q,1578815941.0,"So far so good.  I have two kittens and wanted to feed them 3 times a day (I feed them myself before and after work).  But in between they eat from the feeder.  The feeder has 3 slots, 1 of them is already open so in reality only 2 can be programmed.  The feeders are digital and open at the same time for both my kittens to eat on their own feeder.  I read the feeders with manual timers are inaccurate and if you have more than one cat it may be that one opens later than the other and possibly not at all.

For the other types of feeders, most of them look like monsters.  In some cases people complained about them being difficult to clean, their pets figuring out how to open them or the feeder dispensing inaccurate feeding amounts and occasionally some not dispensing food at all.  The majority broke after some time even though they were a bit expensive.  

You can call me crazy but I donâ€™t like to spend my money on just anything, so I have a tendency to research it all.  Maybe this is not the right feeder for you so and it would be best for you to do your own research.  This was just my grain of sand."
CatAdvice,fe0ku1k,t1_fdzivag,1578815198.0,"Iâ€™m sorry for your situation.  One cat could be fine in a one room even, provided they have toys and things to climb on.  But based on your responses it almost seems that the best you can do right now is re-home him, for both his and your own sanity.  You can ask people around or perhaps put an add online, possibly ask your friends on Facebook or neighbours..."
CatAdvice,fdyzv8y,t3_enc6gy,1578785303.0,I recently spent like 3 days researching this as I also needed a feeder for my cats.  After loads LOADS of reading I settled for the Cat Mate 300 (3 meals).
CatAdvice,fdyyj4a,t3_enbidt,1578784820.0,"Difficult situation indeed. I think that for me this would be a package deal, that is, me and my cat.  Maybe you can try some Feliway to help calm him down a bit.  If your boyfriend and his mother treat him with love (and give him some space) Iâ€™m sure he will eventually change his attitude towards them.   You can propose that you try this for a few months and if it doesnâ€™t work then you can re-consider the situation. 

I had a cat that loved me but hated everybody else.  I never thought of giving her up, but did worry that if I were to die nobody would have wanted her ðŸ˜¢"
CatAdvice,fdvk1my,t3_emzelz,1578748229.0,"Agree with the others.  I got my cat her favourite snacks and we spent the day together watching tv (she loved curling up next to me). 

Iâ€™m sorry you are having to go through this, itâ€™s been years but this still makes me cry.  Big hug."

AskVet,fdpr1ex,t3_eml46j,1578637236.0,"It would be best to take your kitty to the vet. Of course breed will make a difference but your kitten seems a little underweight.  Dry food at 8 weeks may be a little bit too hard still (you may need to add a bit of water but donâ€™t let it out for long as it will spoil).  The best option would be wet food, and introduce kibble with a bit of water slowly when your kitten is feeling better.  It sounds to me like the kitten was not weened properly which may also be causing the issues (or is younger that 8 weeks old).  Make sure not to drastically change the diet as this will cause diarrhoea.

Best thing to do is to take the kitten to the vet for a check up.  You cannot de-flee the kitten until he/she is 800gr, nor vaccinate until he/she is well.

Good luck with your kitty."

CatAdvice,fcea8pf,t1_fc93fop,1577618481.0,"If she didnâ€™t care she wouldnâ€™t have asked, I think.  

There are pipettes that you can apply.  You bathe the cat and using the right brush try and get as many flees as you can.  You must also wash the cat bed and blankets and try clean you place as much as possible.

Go to the pet store and ask for flee treatment, they can be pipettes which you apply to the back of the catâ€™s neck, or spray that you apply all over (I personally prefer pipettes).  Based on the cats weight and age you may need a different dose which is why you should ask the store for advice.

Good luck ðŸ˜‰"
