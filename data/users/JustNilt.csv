> A long history of abuse of many minorities is not an argument or a justification, what happened in the past is irrelevant when looking for a logical argument on why that difference is relevant.

Give me a break.  You can't possibly be arguing that, for example, African Americans can't be reasonably offended by some racist calling them the N word in public based in large part on the historical use of that word.

You do not have the right to offend others or interfere with a business's business.  Period.  If a business wants to forbid hate speech in their facilities, or on their platform if it's an online one, in order to make it accessible and welcoming to all that's their absolute right.  You or anyone else have no such absolute right to use hateful speech or to be disruptive.

This is no different than the fact that while you're free to physically do what you want, that right stops at the end of my nose and arguably somewhat beyond it inasmuch as you can't make a threat to hit me without actually carrying it through, save in actual jest and only when such jest is appropriate (""it was a prank bro"" is not a valid defense legally or morally)."
truegaming,ffgfg2v,t3_etbhbg,1579905036.0,"My kids are 22 and 16 so my perspective may be a bit different from most who've commented that have younger kids.  Early on, I made the same choice about multiplayer games a lot of others did.  It just wasn't fair to teammates or competitors to have to deal with me maybe getting up and leaving at a moment's notice.  That worked well when I transitioned into self employment later and had days where I'm ""working"" by waiting for client calls, if any, and not much else.

We've been almost purely a PC based gaming household.  Not because we're anti-console.  We've had those off and on, they just aren't where our games have been historically speaking.  While my kids liked FPS games and some of the building games such as Minecraft, I've tended to stick to more soloable content, especially RPGs or sims.

The kids would watch me game early on so most mature games weren't an option, obviously.  Later that became less of an issue.  I have also a disability which limits my mobility so that means I have to be more sedentary than I'd like, especially in more recent years as it's progressed.  Games have worked well to fill the void left from being more active.  Luckily, I was able to be responsibly active with my kids when they were little.

I've sort of sectioned off a part of the main living space for my ""office"" and use it to game as well.  It works nicely since family can hang out and watch a show or movie while I listen in sometimes or I can use a headset when I'm not interested in their stuff.  I tend to alternate wife time and game time every few days.  That lets us binge jointly while also getting our own pursuits in separately also.

The real key is every family is going to be somewhat different so tailor everything to your own household's needs.  It's much easier to be a gaming parent nowadays since it's much more socially acceptable.  This wasn't as much the case 22 years ago, let me tell ya!"

This is where your position falls apart.  The difference matters because there's a long history of abuse of many minorities.

While those of certain religions also have some historical issues, we didn't just up and literally enslave an entire sect.  Since there's a different history and arguably a different scale, depending on the religion in question, the the ""fix"" is going to need to be different as well.

One size fits all solutions are, almost by definition, poor fits as solutions.  While the downsides are sometimes worth the hassle of finding a different tailored solution for each issue, that is not the case when it comes to hate speech in public spaces let alone free speech as a while.

truegaming,ffgddf9,t1_fffkxs3,1579903736.0,"There are definitely solid resources online to help you build your own.  The main thing is attention to detail.  Minor stuff such as [motherboard standoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_case_screws#Motherboard_standoff) sizes and CPU cooling fan mounting can have a huge impact on the system.  Those are literally two of the most common mistakes I've seen first time builders have issues with but which may not present an issue right away.

The standoffs are critical because if they're all the same but too tall, you will have issues with the ports matching the backplane.  If they're all the same but too short you may have the same issue as well as not be able to seat video cards and such properly.  If you have a mixz, you might accidentally warp the motherboard, causing it to fail after a much shorter period of time than otherwise.  CPU fans can be mounted just a little off if you're not careful and while it will function OK for a while you'll usually see either a cooling issue or you'll have the mounting point break off.

It's easy enough to get this stuff right if you pay attention, however.  There are fantastic resources for that now that many of us who've been building our own for many years wish we had back in the day.  One of my favorites is /r/buildapc but you do have to keep in mind a lot of folks there get hyper focused on a single aspect such as ""teh bestest video card possible""."
truegaming,ffgcddd,t1_ffffqx5,1579903115.0,"My wife's a child therapist and coming from that perspective, she feels it's never too early as long as you're limiting it in general so they're doing other unstructured play as well.  Before 2 years the limits tend to be 10-15 minutes a day then 30 minutes after that until 5 or 6 years old when you can bump it to an hour or so.  This is from the perspective of proper brain development, etc, of course.  There can be legitimate concerns about visual development but we don't have hard numbers on that yet, which is why the limits seem so low compared to older kids and adults.

Once the kids get older it's important to recognize a huge amount of socialization now happens purely online.  My 16yo, for example, can spend several hours a day playing games with his school friends.  That's on top of hanging out in person for several hours doing stuff like badminton or the like.

A lot of folks complain about that amount of time spent online but keep in mind this replaces the old phone call time we'd spend in earlier generations.  Nobody used to blink at a kid spending 5 hours a day on the phone, assuming nobody else in the house needed ity.  Heck, there'd often be separate lines because of that!  There is little functional difference except they're usually doing some sort of goal oriented task these days as well as just chatting.

First, and foremost, your wife is unqualified to be adding worksheets for the kids even if it weren't age inappropriate, which it most definitely is at 7 and 9.  If the school is giving them homework, that's plenty.

Continue with the family therapy and supplement it with a parenting class.  Also consider a separate therapist for the kids.  They haven't been able to develop their own communication tools properly so they're almost certainly in need of some help there.

Then, once things settle down and are stable to the point where your therapy team feels adding activity wouldn't be harmful on its own (there's almost certainly some trauma from this which will need to be worked through) a maximum of two activities per child is considered acceptable.  Not two per day, two per *week*.  Even two per week would be marginally excessive for the norm, mind you.

All too often it'd be some older lady who'd get all pissy when I politely said, ""No thanks"" then start talking directly to my kid about how ""Dads are no fun"".  Now, he'd almost always tell folks referring to me as his dad that I am not (I'm stepdad) which is fine.  One day he looked a lady straight in the eye and said something like, ""He's not my dad but he doesn't want me to die because that's a peanut butter cookie"".

Seriously, I could have cried.  People need to keep their opinions to their own selves.  I don't give a shit what they *think* but when they start giving a kid shit about his parents' choices they've crossed a line."

Technically you may well *not* be.

She has sex with her partner because she sees it's important to them.  Personally, I'd find that unsatisfying were I her partner but since I'm not and it doesn't affect me at all, it's just a quirk.

Side note: I'd never have known about this had we not played a game where it came up and then the whole game got derailed.  She was shockingly (to the rest of us) up front about it.  Apparently, for her, sex is just a thing folks do like blowing your nose sometimes.  Her partner was somewhat embarrassed about it but since everything was clearly consensual, nobody really thought it an issue of any kind.  Just an oddity of that particular couple and how their personal views on sex actually worked out OK to make them well matched in that regard.

Edit: Purely anecdotal, mind you.  I would definitely not be pursuing anyone even in a non-creepy manner who happens to be asexual.  I could definitely see it coming up only later on in a relationship, however, and then need to be worked out."

That'd be my guess as well.  I opted not to pursue veterinary school years back after a volunteer steint at a shelter showed me I couldn't handle the emotional downsides well.  Regardless, one of the things a vet told me when asking for advice was to a successful veterinarian always pays as much attention to the needs of the humans as the animals while still putting the needs of the animal first."

My current business doesn't need any but when I had employees I always made sure to pay attention to worker needs on scheduling, among other things.  My employees **loved** that job and it was just a shitty retail/warehouse thing.
