sex,ffa0jy8,t1_ff9tyx8,1579725440.0,"The real difference between your ex and your girlfriend isn't enthusiasm, it's how much they are excited and happy about going down on you. Enthusiasm is just a natural reaction that you get by being genuinely excited, you shouldn't try to control it. If you need to think about being more enthusiastic, you're doing something wrong. 

Personally, as a male, all I want for my girlfriend is to have as much fun as I have in bed. If she's saying something like ""You really want me to do this ?"" and if I notice a lack of enthusiasm, I immediately understand that she doesn't really want to do it.
And therefore I tell her I don't want her to do it, because what arouses me is to know that she's excited, not the blowjob in itself."

trashy,fekalb5,t1_fek969d,1579196048.0,"I study psychology and that is not true. Depression isn't cured by an healthy routine. For some people who got depressed due to a tragic event (loss of someone close, losing your job etc.), maybe it can work. But some people need therapy and sometimes medications to feel better. And sometimes even all these things don't work. 

The cure to depression isn't as simple as having an healthy routine. Of course it can help, in addition to therapy, but it's absolutely not the cure. Not every depressed people are able to have such habits though, for some of them getting out of bed is already an achievement."
trashy,fek74zj,t1_fek4sgc,1579194001.0,Yes but you also have to see this the other way around. People who are depressed (or have another mental disorder) don't always have the motivation and the energy to do simple tasks like cleaning their room. It's a vicious circle because it creates even more demotivation and lower self-esteem.

If you just want to be left alone to read a book/use your computer while still having people around you, a library would be a better place. And if you REALLY want to be left alone and not even see other people, you can stay home too.

That doesn't mean everyone in a coffee shop should want to talk with you, but they should not be too surprised if someone comes to them, because it is kind of a place to socialize. They can always tell you to leave them alone though, and everyone should respect that without further explanations"

australia,fcupu7m,t1_fcumwaa,1577986087.0,"Yes, that's why I didn't suggest you to say ""some people"", but ""some men"". I agree that this behavior is way more linked to men than women, but that doesn't mean you can say ""men treat womens body like they own them"". Maybe the majority of people with this behavior are men, but the majority of men don't act like this (in my experience). But I completely agree with you on everything else you said. 

Here's an example : the big majority of suicide bombers in France (I'm french) are muslims. But it is not a good thing to say ""muslims are suicide bombers"" because the majority of muslims aren't. You would say ""some muslims become suicide bombers"". If you don't do this, all the muslims with normal behaviors might feel implicated in what you're saying and it feels like you are generalizing their entire religion."

That's what I like with kratom, it just relaxes you and make you sleep like a baby. You might feel a little drowsy when you wake up though. 

You can compare it to codeine for example. Codeine makes you feel good but there's no come down beside the effects fading away. No disphoria, no anxiety etc. That's also why it can become so addictive.

There is an opioid crisis going on in America, so it is understandable that kratom becomes more and more known out there. 

I discovered kratom myself because I was addicted to codeine.

Kratom is a plant that contains alkaloids (such as mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine) that bind to the same neurotransmitters than opioids. That's why it can be used to reduce or supress the withdrawal symptoms of harder opioids. It shares some effects with regular opioids such as mood lifting, relaxation etc. but way mildler."
