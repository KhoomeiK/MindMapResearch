OCD,ffdmx8m,t3_esyfx1,1579824293.0,"needed exactly this right now. 

no, brain, i am not going to suddenly lose control while i chop tomatoes and put an 8 inch chef knife through my eyeball. we’ve been over this."
eating_disorders,ffdmm6d,t3_esyq4x,1579824106.0,"the weight gain is definitely just water/food weight. remember, the less you restrict/purge, the less you’ll binge. recovery is scary but you’ll be just fine"
fatlogic,ffctuut,t1_ffbucte,1579807147.0,"just because it doesn’t hurt you doesn’t mean it won’t hurt anybody else. weight is a particularly touchy subject. i mean, you usually wouldn’t go up to somebody and compliment them by saying they’re looking chubby lately without knowing if they were trying to gain."
fatlogic,ffctgjb,t3_esqqw3,1579806914.0,"this is completely reasonable. i used to be severely anorexic, and went from a chubby 150lbs to just 94lbs at 5’6”. all the seemingly harmless comments i got about my weight loss just egged me on to lose even more. if you don’t know for sure somebody is actively trying to lose weight, don’t say anything."
TransAdoption,ffapcq6,t3_erl4rj,1579741346.0,"starbucks has really great employee insurance benefits that cover top surgery and hormones. i don’t know the specifics as i’ve never worked there, but maybe look into applying to one near you?

edit: a lot of other trans guys i know have had success raising money for their surgeries via gofundme, if that’s a route you’d like to take."
TransAdoption,ffap5wp,t3_es9ozv,1579741218.0,"the way i fully figured out that i was trans was to ask some close friends to try out male pronouns with me in private (i’m ftm) to see if i felt like they really “fit.” i also went by a masculine name and pronouns on the internet, and bought myself a cheap binder to see if it alleviated any of my dysphoria. basically just a lot of small, temporary changes to explore my gender without any full commitment either way. 

there’s nothing wrong with a little exploration. if you realize you’re trans, awesome! if you realize you’re non-binary, cool! if you realize that you are simply a feminine cis boy, that’s absolutely 100% valid. no need to put a label on yourself if you’re not comfortable with doing so yet, but i will say that cis people generally don’t ever even question their gender. they especially don’t feel 90% sure about being trans. 

we’re the same age and i’d be totally happy to answer any more questions you might have, or just be a listening ear who gets what you’re going through. i’m only a pm away!"

EDanonymemes,ff01jzv,t3_eqtvr2,1579464183.0,"almost everybody is able to lose weight off 1200 calories. that’s the lowest medically recommended intake, and most normies see 1200 as a CRAZY low number. the average toddler is recommended to eat about 1000-1400 a day. most of these people are pretty active, so that puts them at a pretty significant calorie deficit too.

EatingDisorders,fel7gnq,t3_eppx35,1579215700.0,"i’d stay away from calorie counting entirely if you can, because that’s suuuuch a slippery slope back into disordered habits. try to replace the foods you’d normally eat with lower cal versions (almond milk vs regular milk, nonfat yogurt vs full fat, rice cakes or crunchy veggies vs chips, low cal bread, etc.) and see what works for you. focus on eating more slowly and more mindfully, and avoid emotional eating. 

this is not a race! no need to lose all the weight as fast as possible. focus on trying to make yourself feel healthier and doing what’s best for you as opposed to worrying about the number on the scale."

you are entitled to have private feelings about this, but your daughter is an adult. she is free to change her name to whatever she wants. educate yourself on the trans community, join lgbt parent support groups, go to therapy, etc - whatever you need to learn to properly support her.

calling her by ""they"", refusing to use her chosen name, and saying she simply ""passes as a woman"" will only drive a wedge between you and her. it's reasonable to need some time to adjust to this, but flat out refusing to respect her won't do you any good."

eating_disorders,fcpd5i1,t3_ei5r99,1577858978.0,"one of the things i’ve used to combat my issues with food is actually learning how to cook and bake. it helps me feel more comfortable with eating because i know exactly what’s going in my food and i have more control over what i’m eating. when i’m concentrating on making a meal that takes 2-3 hours to complete it keeps me from mindlessly eating during that time, and when i can appreciate the effort i’ve put into my food i’ve found it’s more satisfying to me and i am less likely to binge on what i make.

There is a huge difference between using it medicinally to calm your anxiety, help chronic pain, etc., and using it to completely numb yourself from all your problems. 

I have seen some of my own friends literally turn their entire house upside down looking for coins to use to buy a gram. I have seen them scream at and threaten their partners if they think they smoked a joint without them. You’d think they’re withdrawing from coke or something with the way they act without it (and I’ve seen that too.) Obviously these are extremes, but it goes to show that, just like any other psychoactive substance, weed can be abused."

AnorexiaNervosa,fbus1w5,t3_eejjd7,1577119457.0,"its a scary process but what helped me through it was remembering how much better i felt physically when i actually ate properly. no more gaining, no more constant thinking about food due to malnutrition, having muscle mass again and no longer being weak, not being cold all the time, getting rid of my lanugo, etc. those things are WELL worth the weight gain. it took me a long time to realize that but now that i do i feel much more at peace with my recovered body. good luck <3"
