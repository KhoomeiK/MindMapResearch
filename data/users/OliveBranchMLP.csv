The confusing headline makes it sound like it’s gonna be about actually writing games themselves, but it’s actually referring to video game journalism. Which... is fine, I guess? Maybe just give it a different title, like “The hard truths about being a video game journalist”.

But even with that title, the article barely says anything meaningful about being a video game journalist or the realities of the discipline. It just talks about this one single journalist, a couple of their opinions, and then drops a bunch of unrelated quotes from articles he’s written. Save for one throwaway paragraph about how you find out that some game devs do bad things, it doesn’t really have anything to do with any “hard truths”.

I don’t know how anyone can sit through the first several lectures— er, sorry, “conversations” with Deadman and think the writing is actually good. He talks slow, talks in circles, and has these long-ass pauses between each line of dialogue where he stands there and stares at Sam like he’s waiting for him to respond, but then Sam just stares back like an idiot, so after like 5 seconds of dead silence and absolutely no emoting, Deadman just keeps going. But then he does it again and _again_ after _every goddamn line_. It’s so completely and utterly fucking awkward.

The Chiral Artist exemplifies everything wrong with Death Stranding’s direction. You’re staring at a woman bouncing around doing god knows what on a hologram for like a minute straight several times, then you actually meet her and she just talks in circles with 5-10 second delays between each line and it’s just like GOD. 

I can’t even imagine what it was like for the mo-cap actors to actually act this shit out. Kojima must have been literally telling everyone to just slow down. Either that or he took the mo-cap performances and slapped a like 0.5x speed modifier to everything.

But then around Chapter 3 when you pick up the nuke, that scene when Fragile confronts you about it actually sounds like a goddamn normal conversation. Same with most of the Fragile and Mama conversations immediately afterwards. No more long pauses, characters talking at a normal clip, a proper to-and-fro instead of a straight-up lecture, it’s like... wow. Hey Kojima, you can actually direct normal scenes! Great! But THATS HOW LOW THE STANDARD IS. That a freaking _normal conversation_ is the best this game can achieve.

Getting errors with your previous comment, so I’ll just reply here:

>> “Beautifully animated” describes movement.

> Which is what you are talking about, no?

No, I’m not talking about motion. I’m talking about framing and composition—the “camera” angle, field size, panning, placement of objects in a scene, etc.

The study of these elements is called “cinematography”, and because there’s no verb form for that word, their actual application is commonly referred to as “shooting”. This is regardless of whether there’s an actual camera involved or not.

* Understand women better simply by spending time with them and learning about their emotional needs

* Have women who are willing to be your wingman and vouch for how chill you are
* Be introduced to their other female friends, one of which may end up being your special someone

GirlGamers,feef6or,t3_eomh0j,1579032506.0,"I’ve been here for nearly two years now. There are a lot of poetic/silly/clever things I could say to joke about why, but when it comes down to it, none of them live up to the truth: it’s the right thing to do, the right place to be, and the right cause to fight for. Our culture, our community, and our world has absolutely no place for misogyny.

I grew up surrounded by girls and women. We all enthusiastically shared and celebrated the things we loved—video games, Sailor Moon, Legos, My Little Pony, Fruits Basket, airsoft, whatever, there were no boundaries and everything was wonderful. But as I’ve grown up, I’ve had to watch these women I love and care for suffer to be accepted in a subculture that has become increasingly hostile to their presence. I’ve had to watch as the slow march of technology and our increasing connectedness has made it easier for toxic men to identify and abuse women. I’ve had to watch women break down crying in streams because the toxicity was too much and no one believed them. I’ve had to watch death threats show up in unmarked envelopes to my best friends’ homes. 

I love video games. They carried me through terrible times in my life, helped discover more about myself and the world, and feel love and camaraderie to a scale as of yet unmatched by anything else in my life. Knowing how much video games have done for me, I feel that to deny any girl that experience simply for being a girl is unforgivable. I feel an indescribable, furious pain each time I hear about some new shitty toxmasc incident that turns a gamer, or especially a game _maker_, away from this hobby I love, for the “crime” of not having a goddamn penis. 

The dev aspect is especially strong for me, because women have been underrepresented in gaming for as long as I can remember, despite bringing such a vivid, colorful, and unjustifiably neglected perspective to our art. I want more women playing games because I WANT MORE GAMES MADE BY WOMEN. And each woman we lose to toxicity is a loss to the evolution of video games’ artistic identity.

The injustice of it all makes my blood boil to no end, and fighting non-stop is exhausting, but no matter how utterly helpless I feel in the face of it all, I will never stop throwing down with misogynists. They are destroying everything and hurting everyone I love, and I am sick and tired of watching my beloved hobby transform into the hellsape it’s become. I will not stand for it anymore.

I ain’t here to impress or mislead or spy on anyone. I’m here to celebrate the things I love with people who share my passions, and to learn how to support the women and girls who have as much right to be a part of the gaming community as I do.

Sci-fi storytelling is very often defined by how technology and space travel influence human culture. While there’s a lot of modern (and even classic) sci-fi elements in Halo, it’s also a lot like Star Wars in that it takes a lot of inspiration from fantasy, which focuses on mythology, religion, legendary heroes (note how Master Chief is often referred to as a Demon by the Covenant), and occasionally biblical allegories.

Calling Halo straight-up fantasy “Lord of the Rings in space” is probably a bit of a stretch on my part, but Halo definitely toes the line between sci-fi and fantasy.

This fantasy influence is much stronger in Destiny, which has almost nothing to do with technology and society, and everything to do with the divine (the Traveler), oblique magic (the Light, the Darkness), mythology (humanity’s past retold through oral tradition, great unexplained myths like the Ahamkara), and fantastical races (especially the Hive, who call their warriors Knights and Wizards).

A lot of people say this (along with the obligatory “rushed game is forever bad” Miyamoto quote) but delaying a game is _ludicrously_ expensive. Only the biggest studios can afford to do it."

“So, in retrospect, while Girlfriend Games’ review of Death Stranding was both heartfelt and critically fair, I’m gonna have to give this year’s Review of the Year Award to none other than videogamedunkey for his wAcKy AnTiCs!!”"

It's like if he was a professional circuit racer but his kids crashed his Ferrari and now you expect him to do the race in a minivan.

An iPad Pro is an order of magnitude more powerful than the iPad Air (like 10-20x more), has a much larger storage, has a much larger screen for large-format design work, has a ton more room has support for the Apple Pencil, and has exclusive industry-standard apps that can't even run on an iPad Air.

This is a $2500 workstation for industry professionals vs a $250 thing you get for your grandma to play Solitaire on.

You cannot do professional design work on an iPad Air, full-stop."

GirlGamers,fc9hld8,t3_egq501,1577552788.0,"I hate matchmaking and voice chat, and how much they've enabled the abuse epidemic that has swept across gaming culture.

* No more dedicated servers with their own local moderator enforcement.
* No more text chat logs that can be pulled up from a database to verify bad behavior.
* No more being able to hide your gender through text-only chat. Everyone expects you to use voice, otherwise you're holding back your team.
* No more MMO realms where your actions carry weight and foster a reputation among all the largest guilds.
* Matchmaking basically guarantees that abusers will never see their victims ever again and thus have no need to empathize with them or fear local/reputational consequences.
* Centralized moderation means it's almost impossible for abusers to face lasting consequences due to the sheer number of abusers and reports compared to the small number of people responsible for handling them.

It’s almost like all the advancements in technology magically aligned to create a perfect storm for abusers to target marginalized groups and face no consequences.

Don't get me wrong, the technology itself is ultimately neutral, and the true fault still lies at the feet of toxic men and other majority-population gamers who refuse to correct their behavior. I just hate how easy it is for them to take advantage of new technology to make it easier to be shitty people."
