puppy101,ffb9b5d,t3_eslcer,1579755918.0,">Recently I've tried to mix and match the commands, but whenever she sees that I have treats/am about to start a training sessions, she'll cycle through all the tricks she knows one after the other to get me to try and feed her, even before I've said any commands.

She is offering behaviors, that's great. She's motivated about training. You can use it to you favor cueing engagement. I use a cue like ""are you ready to go to work?"" (which is no great cause is very long, but I like that it's a question) and expect a particular behavior (spin) from my dog. If he doesn't offer it (hardly happens, only when there are too many distractions), we don't train at that moment.

This is how I cued engagement; when about to start the session, I used my cue and let the dog cycle through his tricks. I praise him for any offered behavior (nice, good) but only use my marker (yes!) and rewarded when he offered the spin. He understood very quickly that when I use the cue, the opportunity for fun is open. 

If when I use a command he knows well, he does something different, I just repeat the command. If your dog keeps cycling, she might be too hyped. You can work on stability using a duration marker."

My boys are 5 months old and 6 months old, very friendly retrievers. One is shy and insecure when introduced to new dogs, the other is extroverted and pushy (currently working to balance them). The new dog is a female Lab, about 6 years old and friendly.

Should I keep them separated most of the time even when I'm around and only allow strictly supervised interactions, even if there are no signs of conflict? 

No doubt the boys are going to push her to play during any interaction, but should I allow them to try to engage her if she is willing?

OpenDogTraining,fc0xg6e,t3_efivc0,1577302292.0,"I was having the same problem with my 3 and 4 months old pups. After a suggestion from my couch, I made a [video](https://www.facebook.com/DosadiestramientoUruguay/videos/450523148889642/) practicing this. ""MUY BIEN"" (very good) was the marker, I hadn't introduced the clicker at that time. I hope you can see it and that I'm not breaking unknown rules."
