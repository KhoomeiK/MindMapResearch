Lol..did you get your donuts from “Glazed and Confused”?  That might explain it! 

If I had been your sister I would have eaten the evil donut and see if I get any super powers."
Humanoidencounters,fevuorn,t1_fet23q3,1579401744.0,Yikes! I think the demon laughter and snarling sounds less scary than dealing with a live-in dysfunctional in-law.  Congrats on the successful exorcism! lol
Humanoidencounters,fess6te,t1_feqldcd,1579368469.0,"From the previous house?  No, I am sure it didn’t.  I still visit the old neighborhood from time to time and it’s still strange.  The very atmosphere feels so dark.  

The neighbors that remained are starting to open up more and when I ask them how things are they give a weird expression and laugh and say things are a bit odd.  But they don’t elaborate.  I know even when I still lived there one of the neighbors who lived in the house where I think the problems originated and spread from left abruptly with her family.  They took their clothes and small items but tried to leave their furniture, which they ended up selling or giving away. 

I don’t see the stuff that happened in my old neighborhood happening here."
Humanoidencounters,fesr6gi,t1_feqm6p4,1579368146.0,"I’ve definitely noticed the shit hit the fan shortly after my daughter was born in 2004.  2005 was when everything got freaking weird.  At first I thought it was post partum stuff so I got treated for that and got my health checked out very thoroughly.  

But no...things were weird and I did a bit of scouting around on the internet and found out I definitely was not the only one noticing reality looking a bit more cracked than usual.  

A friend and I think CERN might have had something to do with it, only due to the timing.  But correlation does not equal causation so I’m not betting even a dollar on it.  It’s just something to consider. 

I did come across something about a Project Gateway that another Redditor posted awhile back.  It’s from the CIA website.  It’s a declassified document and talks about the experiments and studies that have been conducted.  They essentially accept the paranormal as a given and not as something left to be scientifically proven.  

Here’s a link to the document if you’re interested. But it’s long and boring, so be prepared to fall asleep while reading it.  Once you accept that this stuff is real, it’s strangely boring.  Yeah these things are scary, but so is a shark or a pissed off bear.  However, it does seem some people are more vulnerable to suffering greatly from the paranormal and they do deserve respect and consideration and concern.

Humanoidencounters,feso6xz,t1_fepvt9z,1579367334.0,"Lol!  I think they are produced on an assembly line somewhere. I actually have two of them and it’s a tossup which one I’m thinking of when I make an in-law joke.  

However, I do actually get along pretty well with both, though I prefer my husband’s sister over the one who married my husband’s brother. The latter is a bit of a “Karen” and actually does often demand to “speak to the manager” about things.  

But I’m sure they could tell an in-law joke or two about me, too.  Let’s be real here: I’m on Reddit talking about the paranormal and Mandela Effects and pets.  So, who the hell do I think I am, really? I’m kind of the stereotypical weird middle aged sister-in-law.  I know it and I own it!"
Humanoidencounters,fepocze,t1_fepgfim,1579325988.0,"I think they mean the voice was telling her “don’t go” because some big creature was lurking around.  

I’ve heard a demonic voice like that INSIDE of my house before.  My previous house is the one that had all the paranormal stuff going on in it.  But it was in this one I live in now where I heard demonic laughter and a snarling noise come out from under my daughter’s bed.  We had just moved in and I was sleeping on a mattress on the floor by her bed while she got used to the new house sounds.

It was a gorgeous morning, sun was shining in through the window and birds were singing. It was the absolute last time and place I would have expected to hear the voice of something hideously creepy that was not my sister-in-law. 

I sat up and was about to wake my kid and get us some breakfast when the demonic laughter and a growling (or was it the other way around?) came from under her bed.  So basically if there was a monster under the bed, it would have been level to my face if I were still lying down. I made the executive decision to NOT look under the bed.  Some things are better left unseen.  Bad enough I heard it.  

I then heard a slight whoosh sound like it had left.  Or maybe that was wishful thinking.  But I didn’t hear anything else.  

I thought to myself “Well, shit.  I thought we left that crap behind at the last house.” 

Actually I had never heard anything like that at our previous house.  This was pretty flipping scary.  But what can you do?  Most of the time these things are one-offs.  You can’t predict where they will pop up so you can’t really avoid the phenomena.  In order to predict, you’d have to understand why it happened in the first place.   I don’t know how you go about doing that.  

My observation is that these encounters seem to be more common for everyone in the last 15 years or so.  As people get used to telling these stories on the internet, they start talking more in real life and you start to hear things and realize this creepy shit isn’t as rare as one would think. As I’ve gone through life, I’ve personally noticed an uptick in weird paranormal shit. And of course I can’t prove it, but I’ve noticed more wandering spirits or entities that aren’t permanently haunting anything but just seem to be passing through and dropping by to see what trouble they can stir up.  That’s not something I’ve noticed happening at the first two houses I’ve lived in during my married life.  Something changed at some point in the last 15-20 years or so.  At least by my observations.  

I think some government sponsored asshole opened a portal somewhere."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,fep1lii,t1_feoy83h,1579310099.0,"Try not to freak out.  The fatigue thing is hitting everyone I know the last week or so.  We aren’t in Austin, we are more coastal and so are my friends, and that’s all I feel comfortable divulging.  

There’s been some weirdness for one of my friends where there’s fatigue and also she is trying to enter her credit card to do online purchases.  She carefully typed the number and her husband even watched her to confirm what she is typing but the numbers get changed on the screen. My daughter is meticulous about where she puts things and they end up elsewhere.  So whatever it is going on, it’s not just you so just take a deep breath and roll with it."
Thetruthishere,fekctjz,t1_fek8rez,1579197364.0,"Well I really wouldn’t call it interacting.  My mom seemed completely oblivious to her family.  And even though I saw my mom when I was having my experience, I had barely enough functioning intelligence to react to her at all.  It’s NOT a positive experience at all.  Do. Not. Want.  I’m very glad it has never been repeated.  

If I want to visit someplace, I will get in my car or walk to it with my physical body and my mental faculties intact so I can truly interact and enjoy the visit.  Our minds and bodies are such an incredible gift, and I intend to take care of and treasure mine for the time I am blessed to have them.  

The resistance I felt was like pushing through 
super strong wind resistance, but without any sensation or sound of wind.  It’s hard to describe.  My mom never felt anything like that. And in my other suspected OOBE’s I never felt that, either.  It was just that one time.  

Maybe something about being very visible contributed to the feeling of resistance.  I don’t remember if my mom said I looked transparent or solid.  I could ask her again, but the incident happened about 20 years ago and even back then from her perspective, with being taken by surprise by something so astonishing, it happened so fast she didn’t have much time to really take it all in.  

I appreciate that you think the experience sounds cool, but I have to really emphasize how unpleasant and dehumanizing and downright frightening and depressing it is to know what it’s like to have yourself stripped down to the intellectual and emotional capacity of a crawling baby.  It is such a basic level of existence.  It does not bear thinking of actual human beings reduced to this state permanently, IF that is what some ghosts actually represent.  It’s horrifying for a life to end up in that state of being.  If I ever run into such a spirit, I will pray for them to find peace and rest."
Humanoidencounters,fejrzwa,t1_fejbcqr,1579184398.0,"Good lord that’s a level of detail that is mercifully missing from my own experiences!  I can’t ever hear anything.  It is just visual only.  Had it been otherwise, I know my arachnophobia would not have let me take those experiences as calmly as I always did.  It’s been years, so I can’t quite remember how realistic the textures were.  

Also, I’ve been nearsighted for years.  I’m not sure how clearly I was seeing them without my glasses on.  Do you even need glasses to see a fuzzy inter-dimensional spider look less fuzzy? 

Putting on my glasses requires enough waking coordination and purpose to end the experience.  That’s why I would never have suspect any level of “reality” to the experience had my kid not spoken up about seeing the spider, without me having said I was seeing a spider.  I firmly believed they were hallucinations related to the dream state of the mind persisting into wakefulness.  And who knows, maybe they are but my kid was seeing what I saw due to some kind of toddler clairvoyance kids that age are reputed to occasionally display. 

I wonder if the spider we saw together persisted visually long enough for me to try and take a whack at it because another person besides me was seeing or projecting or somehow facilitating its existence."
Thetruthishere,fejqac7,t1_fej9t8w,1579183114.0,"It honestly is not exciting at all. My mom was never aware she was doing that. Her experiences just faded into her dreams. She said she remembered walking around her brother’s house and her mom’s house, which weren’t even in the same country as her and in opposite time zones.  So she would be asleep and they would be awake.  She just thought she was dreaming about being back in those places.  Meanwhile, they would essentially see her “ghost” haunting their house.  Phone calls ensued to ensure she was in fact not dead.  That’s how she learned about it.  

The verifiable time I did it, I was taking a nap in my home.  Next thing I know I am popping out of a wall into my old bedroom at my parents’ house.  My was in the room sitting at her makeup mirror and she looked up and of course was shocked to see me.  I was looking all around and for some reason I was angry but I don’t know why.  I felt a strong resistance to my every movement.  I looked around and made eye contact with my mom and she said my name and basically asked me what I was doing there and if I was okay.  I woke up back in my room and ended up confirming the entire experience with my mom right away in a phone call.  Really it was all over in about a minute or two.  It was not an exciting experience, but it was significant. It confirmed for me that we have the ability to separate some part of ourselves from our bodies. 

What I didn’t like about the experience is that I was definitely operating at a very reduced intelligence level and a very basic level of emotional existence.  It was like being a toddler.  A very stupid toddler.  And I didn’t have any sense of control over my own thought process or emotions. I could recognize my mom and frown at her and that was about it.  I’ve read the sub for people who actually have OOBE’s on purpose and they seem to retain their sense of self and their agency better.  They have a very different experience of it than I did, meeting spirit guides or stuff like that.  

Given my experience, I can understand why “ghosts” in typical haunt stories are such pains in the ass.  They’re not really capable of sophisticated levels of thought and interaction, just basic emotions and reactions and anger is probably the easiest one to access.  

Which is entirely different from contact with loved ones who have passed on and are allowed to visit from time to time.  In that case they have a specific purpose for communicating with the living and seem more themselves.  My mom had a visit from her deceased parents when she was going through breast cancer and they assured her she would be okay.  I’ve had a couple of friends with similar stories. And I had my own similar “ghost story”.   

So I would guess someone who doesn’t know they’re dead and was forced out of their body all of a sudden and didn’t “pass on” isn’t their full self.  That’s very sad and horrifying.

There were a few other experiences I had in my childhood that I’m pretty confident were spontaneous OOBE’s, but without any way to verify them with another person, I can’t take them seriously."
Thetruthishere,fehjm81,t3_ep3cid,1579117882.0,"I would certainly not rule out your theory for some cases.  But I’ve seen it when my mom had a spontaneous astral projection (while napping) and she’s seen it when I had one.  We projected facsimiles of our clothes.   I think normally people who have an OOBE are invisible.  I have no idea why we were visible, at least to each other.  She’s popped out and been seen by other members of her family.  That happened to me and only the one time, thank goodness.  I don’t relish being a ghost before my time and I absolutely can not understand people who actually try to do this on purpose.  

Well the point of that boring anecdote is that I would not rule out ghosts as some form of spiritual remnant just because they’re clothed.  Though you raise a very good question on how and why clothing and other reported accessories are part of ghost sightings."
Humanoidencounters,fehczb3,t1_fegg5y8,1579114007.0,"The movement is realistic. The looks aren’t, because it’s way too big. Which is both i unsettling and reassuring at the same time."
Humanoidencounters,fefppm2,t1_fefj0zg,1579061722.0,"Cool, I never considered that possibility before.  Like I’ve said, I never thought these things were “real” until my kid showed that she was seeing what I was seeing, too.  With kids as small as she was then, I had to be very careful asking her what she saw when we talked in more depth later.  Because the power of suggestion is too strong for little kids.  

Anyway, I’ve gotten into discussions with Muslims who said they might be Djinn.  And that would not necessarily conflict with what you’re saying."
Humanoidencounters,fef87hp,t1_feeaj0f,1579050488.0,"No, they can’t hurt anything. I don’t know what they are.  I am pretty sure they’ve taken other forms besides spiders but I can’t for the life of me remember what.  It’s been about 12 years since I’ve seen them.  I see something now that’s similar but not as defined."
Humanoidencounters,fef7ri4,t1_feeju5c,1579050186.0,"Lol, yeah you know I was fine thinking all my life they were hallucinations. But when my kid indicated she could see it, I thought “Holy shit, how the hell did a huge spider get in the house and how the eff do I kill this thing?”  Because it looked like it was about a foot across!  Like one of those Alaskan crabs at the seafood restaurant.  

I was closing in on it praying it wouldn’t jump at me like a wolf spider and I realized it wasn’t really there.  Mostly because it kind of receded and faded out a little the longer we were awake.  

It wasn’t long afterward I’d come across people on forums talking about these things.  So it’s apparently “a thing”.  

Once you realize it’s not really here in a material sense it is fun to watch.  Even for an arachnophobe.  

I don’t see these things at my new house that I’ve been in for close to 5 years.  I do see blobs that are connected to my forehead.  It’s like a shadow of a big wad of chewing gum that is stuck to me and pulled away.  Weird stuff."

Humanoidencounters,fee4vrx,t1_fede7wt,1579026446.0,"I don’t know what’s worse, seeing people or seeing giant spiders.  I see giant spiders.  Even after I’m awake and sitting up.  I watch them crawl around.  But I only see them in two houses that had other paranormal activity.  And one time when I was sleeping on a mattress on the floor of my toddler’s room because she kept having nightmares, I woke up one morning to see the giant spider on the wall.  My daughter was already awake and she saw my eyes tracking it.  I thought it was a hallucination, I mean I always did.  But she said to me, “So you see the giant spider, too, Mommy?”

I then had a Ron Weasley moment and jumped out of the bed and grabbed a plastic toddler chair and was going to bash it but as I got closer to it I realized it wasn’t really there.  It was like a shadow person, which we had a lot of in that particular house.  

So I grabbed the kid and fled the room and got breakfast.  

We talked about it at breakfast and we figured out we both saw it moving in the same way in the same location of the room.  So it wasn’t a mere hallucination.   

I then shifted through years of memories of these things that I had been absolutely certain had been simple products of the nervous system and saw them in a new light.  I just don’t know anymore.  There is always a weird feeling in my head almost like they’re pulling something from me to manifest.  My daughter says the same.  

Like any other human being I have had legitimate hallucinations due to being dehydrated or sleep deprived or stuff like that. That’s different, it doesn’t feel the same."

When I hit middle age I’ve had a couple of really bad ones that almost seemed like strokes.  I had to get all kinds of tests to confirm my brain is actually healthy, just migraine prone if I’m exposed to certain triggers, mostly stuff that’s easily avoided like soy.  And even then I would have to eat a lot of soy.  I actually found out about my condition when I tried to go vegan.

If you can find out what triggers your migraines you can avoid them and hopefully nothing like this will happen to you again.

But there was the most evil feeling that blew in with that particular one. And we had a lot of electronics act up and car alarms go off even when it wasn’t windy for several days after. There was a nasty feel around us and we had a lot of hypnagogic events:  our names or laughter would be heard as we drifted off to sleep.  I warded the house with salt and a blessing, so we were hearing these sound outside bedroom windows.  

And someone a few miles away had a psychotic break and shot his family members and a neighbor, I don’t remember exactly what happened anymore. But that was a first for a very peaceful community.  

And my daughter’s friend got very nasty and they had a falling out that lasted months. It was just this really nasty atmosphere that blew in with that wind that set everyone on edge for months.

It’s not been a lack of research, but a lack of frank disclosure while the government tried/tries to incorporate/weaponize the knowledge into surveillance and control systems...the usual stereotypical stuff.  

If this is declassified now, it’s either because they couldn’t find a way of making any paranormal research useful and practical, or they’ve advanced to something beyond reckoning.  Or they figure nobody cares one way or the other, as long as we have our distractions."

It’s a long tedious read, considering the subject matter. Leave it to the government to make the paranormal dry and boring.  

At any rate I don’t have a particular opinion on that document, but it goes to show where the interest and funding and supportive environment for paranormal studies is, and it’s not the universities.  

Universities tend to study things they can patent and make money on. The paranormal is something lucrative if you weaponize it or incorporate it into a surveillance and control system, so naturally the government is going to monopolize and classify any research that a university does do.  So we won’t hear about it even if it is taking place.

He recently recommended me for a sleep study but I have to get another unrelated health problem addressed first.  

I sometimes get sleep paralysis as I’m going to sleep and I definitely drift into REM sometimes even as I’m brushing my teeth.   Then I’ll start hearing things and know that I’ve started to dream before properly falling asleep.

You don’t really have any obligation to engage with strangers at all, beyond the courtesy required to do your job. 

I’ve never read it, but a lot of people here recommend a book called “The Gift of Fear” by Gavin De Becker for these stranger danger situations. Perhaps it would contain something helpful for you.  

Alert whomever the manager of your store is to what is going on.  Go with the coworker who experienced his aggressive behavior in asking questions about you.  You can discuss whether or not they can somehow get photos or surveillance video saved on this guy in case he escalates the harassment.  

Start documenting times and dates of any incidents and encounters.  Write down as much detail as you can remember about previous ones. Documentation and hard information is important if you need to escalate this to the police if he escalates his harassment.  You want to go to them organized and very calm and collected with information they can act on when they can, if necessary.

And another thing: stop saying “it’s my fault” in regard to mistakes and missteps you’ve made.  It’s not a “fault”.  It’s just a lesson learned.  Life is challenging and doesn’t come with an instruction manual.  You’re allowed to make mistakes.  Now is not the time to belittle yourself. Now is the time to build yourself up to the formidable adult you’re going to spend the rest of your life as.  

You need to start working to see yourself not as his victim, but as someone he will regret messing with.  I don’t mean get aggressive with him.  Just work on holding a confident demeanor when he’s around and when he tries to engage with you, boldly state that you have work to do and can’t chat.  You don’t owe him any explanations even if it’s clear you don’t have anything to do at the moment.  

You’re a professional getting paid to do your job, not be his entertainment.  If he gets pushy, that will go into your documentation and to the manager on duty.   Give him a firm emotionless look right in the eye and walk away to your manager.   

He is out of line.  He is wrong.  He is the one who is at fault for ignoring your boundaries."

aww,fcul59v,t3_eix7j8,1577983414.0,Catnip Christmas stare? I saw that look on my guys after they got their presents of catnip toys.
AnimalsBeingBros,fcuk6fo,t3_eiz6xc,1577982851.0,"That fast bite to the dog’s eye area isn’t proper play. It’s aggression and the person filming needs to intervene and redirect the kitten to something else, preferably a toy its own size.  The kitten attacking something so much bigger is channeling fear aggression and I’ve seen the outcome of this in a rescued cat when it becomes ingrained due to the behavior being ignored.  It is not a good outcome.

If this behavior isn’t checked by a mother cat or other cats, humans need to step in, otherwise it can continue into adulthood when it becomes dangerous and unpredictable for everyone.  It’s usually the mother cat who usually socializes the kittens out of randomly aggressive behaviors that emerge in play and teaches them to channel their instincts into hunting prey.   Basically, you want the kitten to disassociate hunting behavior from other pets and family members and redirect it onto their toys."

Thetruthishere,fcgppye,t1_fcb9rql,1577642796.0,"The ones my daughter and I saw were purely visual phenomenon and didn’t seem able to interact materially.  Perhaps because they weren’t yet adapted to the more open environment of a typical suburban area.  I’ve seen two that were truly as evil and foreboding as the one you experienced and my poor little girl saw one and woke me from a nap to stop one that was materializing at my bed side.  I feel bad for the kid growing up with these things around.  At least the cat one was interesting. 

Once and only once the bed lifted up a few inches on my side and dropped while I was in it reading. That’s the only time I ever saw anything get moved paranormally in that house.  If it were the shadow beings doing that, they apparently weren’t able to move stuff and be visible at the same time.  

I’ve moved and not seen them here at this house while awake. My daughter and I have seen them a few scattered times over the years in sleep paralysis dreams. They’re annoying in these and seem to be trying to force or trick us into out of body experiences but they scatter when told to get lost. But the nature of sleep paralysis is one of those tricky areas in which it’s hard to say what is “real” and what is just a product of one’s own mind.  So take that part of my experience as I do, with a grain of salt.  Interesting, but nothing to base conclusions on.  

When I sought advice about them in forums before it was Muslims who seemed to have the most detailed lore about them that matched up well to what I was seeing.  Read up on Djinn from Muslim sources.  

I haven’t watched these yet but this video series was recently recommended to me.

A Muslim Redditor says this recitation is the most powerful one that drives these beings away:  

http://www.aquraninstitute.com/ayatul-kursi.html

I’m a Christian, so I’m not sure if using a Muslim recitation is respectful of their faith or might be considered a sort of appropriation.  I just included it here to say that at least someone somewhere knows about these things and has a way of dealing with them.  

I’m not going to ever start a paranormal thread of my own because I joined Reddit initially to enjoy and converse about pets.  I’m afraid people who follow me or look me up based on my posts about those pet topics look at my posts in these stranger topics and think “wtf?”.  Lol.  

Unfortunately once a person has been touched by phenomena like this, it is almost like a form of PTSD and makes it impossible to look at the world the same way again. I find I’m forever drawn to trying to understand my own experiences by reading about the ones other people have had.  That’s one reason I felt compelled to post to you.  I can see you were deeply and profoundly affected by your encounter with this entity and I wanted to let you know there are others of us out here who have seen them. 

I first saw what might possibly have been a form of them in the late 80’s-early 1990’s when my mom was really sick.  My dad and I noticed this flickering at the edge of our vision and little shadows shuffling at our feet.  I’d feel sort of nervous and get goosebumps when that happened.  We did a family prayer and a house blessing and that seemed to work at their house. 

Nothing I tried at my last house ever really fully cleared the place.  Had I known about that Muslim recitation back then I might have tried it out of desperation.  It was really the whole street that was infested.  The houses to either side of me developed severe domestic violence problems and our family was always stuck in the middle calling the police and helping when we could. I do think these things can affect human behavior even among people who can’t see them and don’t believe in such things."
Thetruthishere,fcb4vu0,t3_egxnu1,1577582381.0,"I’m sorry to hear of the passing of the young coal miner.  My respects to his memory and to his friends and family. 

I was reading your stories because I read a very disturbing mine story several days ago about someone who was doing some kind of surveying job in a WV coal mine that was due to be permanently sealed. On their return trip to the exit, they had seen a little girl at one of the side tunnels. I couldn’t understand why they didn’t stop or alert someone to find out who she was or get her out of there. I’m a mom of a daughter myself and all I could think of was all the children on missing kid posters and all those missing 411 stories.

So I saw one of your mine stories to try to better understand why the OP of that thread didn’t think he saw an actual human.  I think I understand now.  

What an environment! I don’t think I’d last ten minutes down there.  Not because of the shadow beings, but the material hazards and just being underground and always under threat of danger and darkness.  That alone would unnerve me. 

As for shadow beings though, I guess I got used to them, at least in a suburban setting where I guess they don’t manifest quite as strongly.  I had lived for 10 years in a house absolutely infested with shadow beings.  I saw them even out in the yard in broad daylight, though not under direct sunlight.  There were quite a variety of them ranging from humanoid and very ominous to small and animal like and seemingly benign.  

There was a little cat shaped one that used to run into walls when my cats would chase it.  It disappeared for a few years and resurfaced to act like a real cat with my daughter when she was little.  She knew it wasn’t a cat because neither of us could look directly at it.  It was like our eyes would be forced to look a little bit to either side of it or it was shifting just too much beyond the center of focus.  All of these shadows were like that. 

They actually infested our whole neighborhood and I think they might have originally been drawn out to the suffering of a homeowner who died of cancer.  Then the next person who bought his house had a wife who was diagnosed with cancer within a year and also died.  The next family remodeled the house and moved very abruptly one year after I saw a massive evil feeling shadow being walk through the exterior wall into their house. 

There’s a lot more I could say about my experiences there and with those creatures but I’ve got to join my family now. 

Again, I’m very sorry for this terrible tragedy at your old mine.  I pray your former coworker will be at peace."
