They're basically baked/cooked cheese. They're crunchy and slightly oily. They have a really potent cheese flavor. 

They tend to be quite pricey. I get them if I see them on sale. You can also make your own and it's not *that* hard but there's a little bit of an art to it. Cooked too long and they burn, too short and you get something like cheese taffy.

What constitutes ""luxury"" is always relative to what the majority have. The poor of today live in luxury compared to the peasants of the Middle Ages. And in the western world, the poor live in luxury compared to around 30% of earth's population. 

In your example, you mention water wells. When does that become a luxury? When you pay someone to carry the buckets for you? When you have pipes run from the well to your home? When you have special filters to clean the water? When you add fluoride to the water to promote healthy teeth? 

Technically, none of us ""needs"" those things. You can find plenty of villages in Africa, South America and Asia where water is still carried to and from the home in buckets. Ask any of those people if magic pipes that bring water to the home are a luxury and every single one would say yes.

Your idea of luxury and necessity are that they're fixed or static, and everyone deserves that basic level. They're not. When the population grows and outstrips those water wells, now that clean water is a luxury. Anyone who can't afford it drinks from the unclean wells."

You can treat it with an OTC anti-fungal spray. Any athlete's foot spray would work since it's the same fungus in both cases. 

If you're already highly irritated, use lotion on it whenever it itches for a day or so because if you go straight to the spray it might burn like hell. If lotion is not enough, look for a hydrocortisone cream.

BudgetAudiophile,fe42zx7,t3_encg5l,1578855274.0,"Yeah, it definitely sounds like the receiver.

Does your receiver have a second set of speaker terminals for multi-room or ""B"" speakers? If so, I'd try those and see if anything changes. But, if it had that I'd assume you probably would have already tried it.

To me it sounds like that right channel output or its amp is dead. I would check the levels, per the manual, to be sure, but a factory reset would have set everything even, so it's unlikely.

The only other thing I can think of is you boneheaded the wiring and your right channel is plugged into a surround channel so all you're getting is back-fill audio. If you're moving cables blind because the receiver is in a cabinet, it might be time to dig it out and verify everything."
BudgetAudiophile,fe3yy70,t3_enfz6b,1578854142.0,"I did that for a long time with my 5.1 home theater. Coax to the receiver and HDMI directly to the projector. 

As your overall system gets more complex, you may start hitting limitations, though. For example, my receiver had one coax input and when my blu ray player died and I replaced it, I realized it had no optical, only coax and RCA. I did some shopping around and it was either upgrade the receiver, upgrade the blu ray player to something that still supported optical, or get a switch box. I ended up doing the latter since it was only $15. But kinda janky and requiring me to manually change the input.

Fortunately for me, my projector is 1080 and there's a TON of cheap, very nicely featured receivers out there that do 1080 just fine, especially assuming you don't need the apps."

It's a PRIVILEGE to openly criticize your own country that many in the world don't enjoy.

Too bad they didn't pay attention in history class because ""When am I ever going to use this?"""

Fucking dumb."

ProRevenge,fdan9ze,t3_ek35m8,1578247914.0,"I did something like this. I was casually dating a woman and paying for everything. I was fine with it as our first couple dates were pretty inexpensive - maybe $50 total for drinks/dinner, but on our 3rd date she suggested double-dating with a friend and her boyfriend. Okay, no problem. 

She picked a stupid expensive restaurant - a high end Brazilian steak house, and immediately I got the spidey sense that she told her girlfriend ""don't worry, he pays for everything"". Went to the ATM and took out $100 and met up with everyone at the restaurant.

I say, ""I'm not too hungry, so I'm not going to get the full service, just something basic. I got a caesar salad and two drinks. Each drink was $15 and the salad was $18. 

Meanwhile, they went full bore: drinks, meal and dessert. 

Bill comes and I motion to the waiter to give it to me. Total bill is around $450. I say aloud, ""Okay, two drinks and a salad so mine is $48. Let me help with the tip. I throw down $80, then push the bill across to them. 

The look was fucking priceless."
unpopularopinion,fd6ycem,t1_fd6hqio,1578197232.0,"In a way, yes, but I don't look at it that way. It was one part coping mechanism and one part feeling like we were drifting apart. But the latter was true - their new ""hobby"" was eating. I still liked to game with them but over time it became less and less about that and more about food. Like I'd say, ""Hey let's head to the gamestore and all go in on <insert new game> and they'd make excuses not to, and then just say, ""Why don't we do that some other day. Lets go grab a bite and keep it mellow."" 8000 calories later..."

financialindependence,fd678sn,t1_fd5rbq8,1578186546.0,"It used to be taught more. It was part of what was called [Home Economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_economics).

Unfortunately, it was seen as a ""girls class"" and pretty much disappeared as women started joining the workforce. They threw out the baby with the bath water in other words."
financialindependence,fd66q3y,t1_fd5rifj,1578186324.0,"I went to a private high school so I don't know about public schools. 

They used to teach basic finance in Home Economics. Basic stuff like budgeting, balancing a check book, what a bank account is for, and all that. Basic stuff, but quite useful to at least get students thinking in that direction. 

Unfortunately, Home Ec was considered a ""girls' class"", because they also taught basic cooking, housework and other ""homemaking"" skills, so by the mid 1990s it disappeared. I assume because it was considered sexist and ""old fashioned"". 

Sometimes the jocks would take Home Ec because that was the only elective that fit in their schedule and it was always sort of a joke. The yearbook always had pics of the jocks in aprons, or showing off their football cakes and stuff."
financialindependence,fd65qe3,t1_fd5fwhw,1578185901.0,"You could say the same about literally any school subject. And yet, we still go to school. 

A huge part of school is being exposed to information that other people worked really hard to work out. That way, when someone talks about, say, a comet making a close pass to Earth, you're not the moron who blurts out ""How the f*** can they possibly know that? That's either magic or they're lying or they made a deal with the great Satan!"" 

Instead, you remember enough about high school physics and math to understand how such a thing is observable, predictable and calculable, even if you don't recall the specific methods. And then you step away from the idiot and move closer to people who are similarly educated, and prosper, while the moron continues to think our physical world is a bunch of mumbo jumbo and luck.

Thanks for the gold my dude/dudette."
