Mean Rachel was violent and gung-ho about fighting yeerks but lacked the mental capacity to think more than a few steps ahead of herself. Nice Rachel didn't have a mean bone in her body but could plan out an entire shopping trip. 

The two Rachels were essentially incompatible without each other, as Nice Rachel refused to fight the yeerks and Mean Rachel simply wanted to plunge herself towards certain death with no strategy and quickly turned against the rest, so the others had to figure out how to merge them while in the middle of yet, another yeerk plot to foil.
