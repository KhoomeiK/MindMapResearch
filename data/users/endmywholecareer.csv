Accutane,ffokyo2,t1_ffoirg6,1580078754.0,"I legit dropped out of college in my freshman's year because of this, brain fog and anxiety. (60mg)"
Accutane,fffvhzu,t3_et5okc,1579892698.0,4 month progress here too (60mg). Look similar to you bro. Keep it up and go get your perfect skin!
learnprogramming,ff7lekd,t1_ff7jxfk,1579652332.0,"It looks good. Yeah you're right there's modulo but I made it with int division (thought it wouldn't be wrong)  but literally thanks for all your help. Syntax is good except return doesn't work in scilab and for loops are written completely different (nearly like while). Nonetheless your tips are very helpful man!
Edit: And also % doesn't work. Need to use modulo as in docs you have sent"
learnprogramming,ff7j6wp,t1_ff7ijaa,1579650806.0,Unfortunately there's not % in scilab. I need to calculate complexity of this program and couple of other things like worst case scenario (it's for my algorithms class and we're just starting to program)
learnprogramming,ff7iczj,t1_ff7hn6i,1579650243.0,"Sorry, it's late and I forgot to write it's scilab. 
if N-2*(N/2)==0  is checking if length of array is even. There's not % in scilab.
And sorry for short variables but they are just for the sum (I'll change that later). The most important thing for me is to optimize the code though."
acne,ff6abeu,t3_erole2,1579622804.0,"Hey. Can I ask about what was your cumulative dose of Accutane? I'm doing 9000mg now. My derm said I better do 150mg per 1kg because of mild bacne. I'm 20 and my face literally exploded before my exams in senior year of high school after I got back from a trip (too much stress). I think it's damn genetics, my dad's family had it in my age too. I'm in college and after bumping up Accutane dosage to 60mg my skin sucks again. Nonetheless you are naturally gorgeous. Even if you don't believe it, it's truth."
Accutane,ff65jdg,t3_erqz26,1579619643.0,"Yeah I kind of regret it. When I change dosage not only face gets worse but also side effects are brutal. I mean eye burning and pressure (eye drops don't help much) , light sensitivity, bone pains, brain fog, fatigue, mood swings and others. I'm in college (engineer in IT) so in just 2 weeks I have exams. Guess it's not enough to ride it out and I have a hard time thinking what to do next. Only B&A photos like yours cheer me up right now."
