With an engorged penis it will be farther from the body and have a larger surface area.

medicalschool,feb47pb,t1_feb2im8,1578955293.0,I'm confused how the schools mandatory activities (besides working with patients and practicing clinical skills) are beneficial to me. I'm learning everything the rest of the students are just in a different way. I've passed my classes better than some of the other students. I just feel the quizzes we have are worthless because they are testing based on what's been taught in class. I do physiology then pathology then pharmacology. The school sets the curriculum based on what professor is available. 4 of our classes for this week still say TBD. I do poorly on the quizzes and other activities because I'm learning in what feels like a much more efficient way that also allows time for my step review

medicalschool,feazimr,t1_feaxsa4,1578953877.0,I should have clarified more of what I meant. I'm just frustrated with my school because they haven't changed anything in years. Our step scores have been well below national average for the last 10 years and instead of making changes we have the same PowerPoints and practice material with very minimal changes. They are trying a new curriculum with the M1s so they don't seem to care about us at all and how they teach. We have one 2 story building that is always occupied and have dedicated hundreds of millions to building facilities in a state 10+ hours away that only 20 of our 160 students will go to. They don't care to make any adjustments for my class and it's making this year feel like a real waste of $70k.
