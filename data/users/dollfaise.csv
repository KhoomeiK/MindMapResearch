relationship_advice,ffch2xs,t1_ffccomr,1579799314.0,">but that may not be the type of relationship that she wants to be in ultimately if it turns out that way, which honestly is probably also ok.

Well, to start, is ""married to doctor"" really a ""type of relationship""? Would this be acceptable for a non-doctor to say/want? It's not really commonplace for spouses to have the exact same careers. 

Second, I think she needs to be more clear about what type of life she wants to begin with. My ex's dad is a doctor. The man was almost never around. I remember him standing in the kitchen making a sandwich one day and his youngest son coming in and saying in genuine surprise, ""Oh, dad's home?"" The kid never knew when he'd be around or for how long, it was more normal for him to be out of the house. If his mom had the same type of schedule, given the age of the grandparents, they'd have needed nannies which obviously some people use but is that what OP envisions? It's great to imagine the things you want but you have to be practical about how the pieces fit in your timeline/budget/etc.

Schedules obviously depend upon field, which we don't presently know. But we do know she wants kids. Maybe she wants them and is okay with them being primarily raised by a non-parent. Maybe she hasn't thought that far ahead though. We just don't know yet. But it seems strange to me to so desperately want to be married to a doctor that you'd be willing to end an 11 year relationship. What if he directed his ambition elsewhere and was really successful? Is that ambition and success not enough? Like what, particularly, does she get from him being a doctor other than status? Like I said, most couples don't share careers. I guess, if that's important to her, okay...just seems weird that out of a list of traits to look for in a spouse, that would be the dealbreaker... /shrug

Note that it might be her obsession that's built up his anxiety so bad that he can't let the ""dream"" go at this point. That's sad to me. She might leave him and he'll have wasted 11 years trying to pursue something someone else wanted for themselves. If she really just wants someone who is passionate about what they do, she might have to stop pushing the MCAT and instead encourage him to try something else, which she didn't mention doing in her OP."

Or maybe it's a lesson in how, what you are born into and with, can give you a leg up. But if someone else was provided with those same privileges, they too could be great. Because that's generally what real life is like - people at the top, who started at the top, telling people at the bottom to just get tf over it already. But some people definitely start ahead and stay ahead by a significant margin; the rest might do just fine but they won't reach the same heights.

Agreed. I just left a position in which communication with the boss was poor. She heard and saw what she wanted and ignored the rest. Her view of her employees was inherently skewed for this reason. If you were to ask her what she thought of her employees, her perception of their attitudes and performance was frequently off the mark. While I was definitely viewed as problematic - for wanting to have the authority to do my own job if you can believe that - the woman who constantly undermined me was one of her best workers. Even though she caused the problems. Which then lead to me becoming disgruntled. The problem, though, was me being disgruntled, not what lead to it...

The workload was imbalanced, treatment wasn't fair, and I felt she didn't really understand what was going on inside her own organization and wasn't listening when I sought help. I got angrier over time until I left for a new opportunity. And I don't mean I went to a neighboring organization, I was so desperate to get out and so angry at my coworkers that I *sold my house and moved across the state.*

Funnily enough, I nailed the next job pretty fast and I'm still catching mistakes that my former employer is making while they cover my workload. So when it comes to boss/worker relations, I always pause and wonder what else might have been going on. Like how long was he with the company? Was he great at first? If he was and that changed over time, why? It's possible he just started to slack, the novelty of the job wore off, but it's also possible other stuff was going on with those coworkers that impacted his behavior and he just decided ""fuck it"". Not that this is okay, personally I would recommend jumping ship for another job as I did, but I can understand the growing anger. And if he did have legitimate complaints - even if he did voice them incorrectly here... - OP might want to consider them. I know I tried to give my boss (polite!) feedback in my exit interview but I could hear the ""whooshing"", it was so disappointing."

They're old enough to drive to school, that means they're pretty close to heading off to college. Is she supposed to wake them up all throughout college, too? As your kids get older, you slowly start handing things off to them and backing away and you *don't* begin this process *after* they've moved out. Expecting your kids to set an alarm isn't absurd. I was doing this by ~14 when I decided I needed more prep time in the morning. And yes, I remember how fucking exhausting it was because the school day conflicts with kids' natural sleep schedules, I totally get it. But I grew up watching my working class parents having to do things they didn't necessarily want to. I didn't think that rolling around in bed yelling at my mother at ~17 years old was an option.

Maybe they just don't find you funny. And maybe talking about your wife like this is something you should reconsider. It's not like she was wrong, when given the chance to pick a middle name you decided to poke fun at your wife instead. Maybe they think you're a jackass. /shrug"

librarians,ff9v7jv,t3_esew7f,1579722200.0,"I would also recommend looking around your area to see who is hiring, how many jobs even exist, filled or not, and how long people have had them (if possible). I am sure there are places that really value school librarians but I wouldn't say my previous locale is one of them, for example. When a previous school librarian retired, they cut the position and now have one librarian overseeing the middle school and the high school. It's not the only school in that area to do it, either. Which means schools aren't even necessarily averaging 1 dedicated librarian per school. Hell, now that I think on it, in elementary school we had 1 librarian for 4 branches. We only saw her once a week. So if moving out of state/county/whatever isn't something you are willing and/or able to do, you're going to want to know what the job outlook is. 

Not only are the school librarians stretched thin where I was, public librarians were also stretched thin - and paid very little with almost no benefits. I had no dental or vision and no state retirement and nowhere better to go unless I moved away. Which I did because fuck that. But if you're someone who is committed to one location, you're definitely going to want to be aware of your prospects because it might be very competitive.

>I don't know what the pocket-money situation is in your house.

Then your judgment should probably be INFO instead because OP does say in her post that the girl has money and is stingy with it. OP doesn't mention having a job - which I'd think she'd bring up if that's how she's getting her spending money - so I'm wondering if they're both spending chore money. But even if OP has a job, it still sounds like the 13 year old has cash of her own for fun purchases.

That aside, I understand being jealous as the younger sibling but this is like being jealous at your sibling's bday and demanding your own separate present. At a certain age, that shit stops and your kid has to understand - not everything is about you, life isn't always fair. So yeah, at some point the older sibling is going to have a job and consequently have some amount of money. That's how being older works, you hit age targets earlier - the good and the shitty. The 13 year old will get there, too. Doesn't mean you gotta ""make it up to them"" that one kid *has a job* and the other can't get one yet. Give it a few years, she'll have her own job and then she'll wonder why she was so eager. lol

>with your sister having to ""earn"" her portion through chores or whatever.

Ehhh, this is an optimistic suggestion. The mother already knows there's an issue, she could try to solve it herself, but she's not interested. It's possible that OP could make this suggestion and the mom would enforce it but I dunno, having had a younger sibling who wasn't disciplined either, I'm not so hopeful. I think sometimes younger siblings are spoiled, at the very least simply because by this point parents don't wanna deal with them. lol My brother got away with so much shit because it was easier for my parents to just say, ""dollfaise, you're the older sibling"". Well, when you're talking 15 and 12 that's not a valid explanation for why I'm supposed to share but he's not, you learn ""sharing is caring"" in kindergarten... -_- But they felt it was easier to convince me that, being older, I had no business wanting to play a video game at all and I should just give it to him when he wanted. Actually teaching him to play nicely with other people took too much effort. So any plan I did propose was shot down. I stopped bothering.

If it were my mom and she knew one of us wanted something the other had like this, a simple food item, she'd be like christ, here's $10 or whatever, go fucking get it, why are you acting like starving animals?

Sure, it would be nice for OP to attempt to problem solve in such a way but I dunno, I remember being 17 and my teen brother (14) having a few annoying qualities. We'd like to pretend 17 is worldly and wise but you're still pretty much a kid and you don't always make the best judgment calls, especially where siblings are involved. You're in this weird age gap where you're old enough to know better not to do X or Y but you're not old enough to be parental in nature.  That's why there should still be an actual parent present. And there is, she just doesn't want to get involved. We're expecting the 17 year old to solve a problem the mom actively wants to ignore herself, I dunno it just seems like a weird expectation to me...at worst, ESH, but I don't think OP can be TA when there's a parent there who should be refereeing. If you don't want to deal with bickering either don't have kids at all or only have 1, once you start adding siblings you have to accept this is going to happen and you have to teach and monitor.

I mean, if we want to talk about age expectations, the 13 year old clearly has her own money. She doesn't want to spend it. She's old enough to have money, she's old enough to know not to steal. By saying YTA you're not holding her to any expectations either, just the 17 year old OP."

You want a fucked up adult? This is how you get a fucked up adult.

You're calling on a kid to show empathy when you can't even do it yourself. I think his hurt and anger are very unhealthy but when you're a kid, and you spend most of your time in school where you are bullied, this is pretty much all you see. You stew in it like a rank gravy. You don't see the stain of it ever coming off and your already unstable emotions just get worse. I think as adults, it's easy to forget this - but I think we need to be more mature and direct the kid to his school counselor, not give in to whatever issues we might have that would lead an adult to attack a teenager on the internet.

I was bullied, actually targeted until I changed schools. I never thought I'd get over it.

He just doesn't matter anymore. Hell, he's a dad, for all I know now that he has kids of his own he looks back on that time and thinks, ""I was a fucking prick"". Who knows? I don't really think of it.

But back then? Christ, the depression was so fucking bad I couldn't eat, I didn't sleep enough, I developed an ED, I cried every day.

No, certainly not if you aren't interested in those fields and are starting from scratch. But I wouldn't classify metadata, HTML, or CSS under graduate studies. Some students start studying HTML and CSS in high school. They, along with metadata, were part of my undergrad and it wasn't even an IT/CS program, it was print/tech/art/etc., pretty multidisciplinary. Some of us loved those classes, some of us hated them, but we all took them between the ages of 18 and 20 because the school felt that you at least needed to be acquainted with them. You don't even need to be good at math or science to do them. I sucked at both.

I tend to agree with /u/YouCanadianEH, it really isn't the hardest science in terms of the degree itself. I actually complained about this early on in my program in the grad sub /u/YouCanadianEH mentioned and I seem to recall them poking fun at the MLIS a bit. Now, certain *specializations* can be harder sure but generally speaking, it's not the roughest path to follow. I don't think that means it isn't worth more though. *My* problem with the pay is that it hasn't lined up with my workload or hours, what is expected of me, and the education required. If you have to get a master's to even enter a field, I don't think you should be getting $15/hour. Back when education was more affordable at least it was workable. But now people are going deep into debt just to get to this point; it's a barrier to entry for people who are less fortunate but there's no clear line for why. I've heard it said that grad school teaches you theory and ethics - but that's proving the other person's point, other master's programs teach a lot more than that, and I actually began picking that up on the job from other librarians. By this point, we could be doing a lot more OTJ training. So why lock theory and ethics behind such a high price tag? And then pay so little?

I also feel like it's sending some mixed signals. My job is so important that I have to get a master's degree, I have to get a state certification, I have to take continuing education classes/webinars/etc. to maintain that certification, but I'm only worth $40k a year? Hell, plenty of the jobs advertised in my system fell under that even. Some were for directors.

>According to data from the U.S. Department of Education, average grad school debt for those who have earned a master's degree is $66,000. [Source](https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/average-graduate-student-loan-debt/)

And that figure is roundabout average for ""other"" master's degrees (""Common master’s degree programs (that are not business programs) include education, Master of Arts, and Master of Science.""). And the PSLF program that was promised in the US? Sounds like it's a total fucking bust.

I've felt like my employer expected me to right all the world's wrongs. I didn't feel like I had support while I tried to do the impossible. I got nothing more than a CoL raise each year (but was told we'd get more if we worked hard...wow, fuck you too), I wasn't part of the state retirement system, I had no dental or vision coverage, and I had no vacation time for the first year. This is already getting really long so I'll just say she burnt me out really damn fast.

Now, you might say this is just the job I was in. I really hope so. I'm starting a new one soon but I've already been lowkey warned that this one is intense, too. It's why I'm also starting work on a second bachelor's just in case. I don't think you can realistically expect someone to work the kind of hours I was working, 5-6 days a week, with that workload and then pay what I was making with my bachelor's degree in 2013. Salary needs to go up or workload needs to be more realistic. I'm not the only librarian I know who is burnt out and fed up. If anyone knows where the fun jobs are, point me that way plz. lol"

librarians,fe9qkie,t1_fe3yelq,1578940593.0,">I was just looking at the overall impression

What do you mean by that? I always found that patrons appreciated having their needs met. I buy enough copies of popular materials, make note of current events, refresh collections/sections, keep my community's interests in mind, etc. but once I've hit those targets and I've got money left, some portion of that does go to requests. A lot of it *is* patron driven because...they patronize the library.

This does mean using a lot of lists, whether it be B&T lists, the NY Times, NPR, etc. I'm not sure how else you'd want books to be purchased.

>the reference librarians will sit behind the desk and wait for patrons to bring questions to them.

If I see someone standing in front of the catalog computer with a ""wtf"" kind of look I'll ask if they need help. But if they're going at it just fine, why would I interrupt? There's a balance. You aren't a college professor teaching a class, you aren't a babysitter, you're supposed to help people to be self-sufficient...so if they're already seemingly self-sufficient, why would you intervene?

>The library also runs programming but we seem to naturally take a more reactionary stance.

I'm not sure what this means. Are you saying they offer programs patrons ask for? Because, again, I'm not sure where the bad is there. The library exists to serve. Feel free to try out new things and offer access to new information but if you have patrons asking you for something, why would you say no?"

The exact same situation only not...details matter, come on man. Most people use kettles to boil water and then let said kettle sit until the next use. Very few people routinely wash them. Pots get washed all the time so it's likely this woman is popping it into the washing machine afterward anyways because she knows she'll be cooking food in it. Because the kettle only ever boils water, it just sits in between uses...and now that it has an additional purpose, not washing it now feels gross.

What's more, in this post the OP lives with his partner so they share these materials. In the other post, the gf lives on her own and it is her pot. The OP was bitching about her using her own pot in her own home because ""I don’t want her cooking me food in that one again"" - even if she throws it in the washing machine afterward, in which case it *is* clean.

He's getting married and instead of focusing on that, he's creating a skit to make fun of traditional women - in this case, two women who love and have supported him. He can do whatever he wants at his wedding obviously but he could probably stand to work through some of that bitterness in therapy.

But I also didn't care much for my wedding anyways and probably shouldn't have had one. If we could go back we'd elope....

But I *have* heard of women choosing styles for their bridesmaids. And it sounds to me like OP has tried a lot of styles as it is. What's the count - 7? 8? What's more, what you learn once you've gone through this process is picking a color is like....1% of the battle. ""Maroon"" has 19,383,728 variances depending on where you buy the dress from. Which is why when I picked mine, I sent out one website and was like here ya go - good reviews, affordable, good selection. Good luck. It was what I'd read I should do - don't just say ""Navy Blue"" because you'll get multiple colors. They probably had 2 dozen styles in that color, most of which Joy would have hated. And I purposely tried to find a site with a range of styles, including something I'd wear myself.

And I say this as someone who is very insecure. I get that. My MoH is the same way. But Joy's demands are so beyond workable that it sounds like something she needs to handle in therapy. Not at someone's wedding. OP probably could have brought it up later but weddings are fucking stressful, even when you're just trying to survive (mine was for family - we're the first-born in both families) so I can see how after probably hours she'd snap.

----

>So is your grudge over your initial complaint of the phone throttling, or the price point, or the transparency, or your perceived value of the product? You’re doing a lot of back and forth here so it’s hard to tell.

Listing multiple complaints isn't ""going back and forth"". Some of us can entertain multiple thoughts at once. Just because my initial post wasn't 4 paragraphs long doesn't mean I didn't have multiple concerns, I'm just not as emotionally invested in Apple as you are. The post I initially replied to was literally one word, come on dude.......

I am going to disabuse you of some false non-Apple ideas you picked up because I *am* invested in pointing out fuckery. I don't expect you to read this, there's just way too much wrong here, but some of what you believe is so baffling I have to point it out.

First - I spend my money how I want. You *do. not.* tell me that I am ""entitled"" because I looked at something - a phone, a house, a shirt, a purse, a tv, *anything* - and deemed it not worth the cost. As you have described it, leaving a company due to dissatisfaction makes a person an entitled asshole. So, as you describe it, our choices are stay and spend thousands for something we don't really want - or leave and be an asshole. Which is describing what I said is a problem - *blind. and total. loyalty.* Funny how you handed it to me in one sentence without noticing.

If I felt like I'd been spending extra for a company because I associated it with beauty, creativity, honesty, and quality, a company that I had previously talked up, and I suddenly felt slighted by that company, and I wanted to take my business elsewhere, yes, that's how ""consumerism"" works. It's funny how ""consumerism"" both drives you to buy a $1000+ phone every 2-3 years without thought and that's fine but when I'm like eehh, nah, now it's a *dirty* word. I think their devices are still beautiful, probably still one of the best on the market in that respect, but I already stated in my op that I haven't been *excited* in years and even though I didn't write an essay, I think they fucked up. They did *just enough* to make me pause before swiping my credit card - that was their mistake. Those of us who aren't in it for the brand pride went, ""Wait, wut?"" That's all it took, and that's all it'll ever take with cars, tvs, phones, laptops, you name it. Are you seriously sitting there telling me I'm *entitled* because of that? Wow. All *I'm* saying is I haven't found a good enough reason to return to paying extra for their products.

Let's talk about how goddamn brainwashed you gotta be to find it *ridiculous* that a company should want to develop a product to meet needs/wants so that people would want to buy it. I mean, christ, I only worked for an entrepreneur who turned out student businesses (at least one of which was making millions before they graduated) and successful startups in a business incubator, a man who taught me about identifying market gaps, creating products and services, writing business plans, finding investors, etc. but wtf would I know when we've got Mr. Apple here to teach us? *Business* is *actually* about creating whatever you want in a vacuum and people buying it for whatever price you set, got it.

What's more, while you're shitting your pants over my *personal choice*, I don't force it on anyone like you are here. Tech support is part of my job and I'm the only one in my group who will work with Apple products. One of my volunteers *hates* Apple and I've had to remove him from an assignment for that reason. I just don't get you fanatics at all. 

And what...""planned obsolescence""? Where did I even mention that? Do you know which post you're replying to? I just think they fucked up which gave me time to pause, reconsider and go, ""Wait, why am I paying for this?""

Second - and yes, we're way down here for #2 - cancel culture? Ugh, I cringed. Could you be any more dramatic? Apple is fine. I'm fine. You're freaking out for nothing. I stopped buying Apple in 2017, you kids created this ""cancel culture"" bullshit last fucking year. Don't include me in that fuckery. For that matter, don't include *Apple* in that fuckery, they aren't ""cancelled"" and anyone who says so is delusional.

Third:

>Also, to suggest someone’s input isn’t valid because they are inherently biased is being hypocritical. You could also argue your input isn’t valid because you are inherently biased because you are upset with Apple over one of the above issues.

I disagree. If Apple's next product were awesome, I'd just as happily go back. Which is why I wrote, ""**I'm only a fan of which company most accurately satisfies my needs for the price point and I don't hesitate to change companies.**"" That you have a problem with this is what's dangerous. It bothers you that someone made a choice that doesn't even impact you, it bothers you that I'd spend my money elsewhere, it's sent you into dramatics about ""cancel culture"" and ""planned obsolescence"" and caused you to set up an impossible scenario. My only point was, at present, I don't think they're worth it. While I'm aggravated by your rhetoric, you're aggravated by my choice in *a phone*...

Ultimately, Androids had the same problem with batteries but ultimately, Androids are far cheaper and multiple makers came out saying they haven't and won't throttle their phones. *Choice*, especially at higher price points, is important to some people. I had high expectations for Apple, I thought highly of them and I felt let down. That doesn't mean they can't come back from it.

Now, I am going to enjoy my weekend. Hope you can do the same."
AskReddit,fdsyi36,t1_fdsjc9p,1578709595.0,"First of all, you're a long-time fan so your input is inherently biased; I'm only a fan of which company most accurately satisfies my needs for the price point and I don't hesitate to change companies. I understand what they did, my not agreeing with you doesn't mean I don't. The 6s was released in September 2015 for $650. Apple announced the problem in November 2016. They didn't admit to throttling for a year after that. For that kind of price, I expected more. You didn't. That's your choice. They sold a $650 phone that, after a year of regular use, began to shut down for a small number of users - so they had to throttle performance to get it to stop.

What's more, they weren't transparent. That's a problem. They weren't upfront and they didn't give users, the people who paid for the damn things, the chance to opt out or even roll back. Personally, I find *that* ridiculous. That you expect to buy increasingly expensive tech with decreasing bang for your buck is a symptom of our times - consumption is at a record high. I just don't live like that, my man.

I don't expect you to respect my choice or my viewpoint but there it is. I think we're paying more for less and Apple is one of the worst for it. I don't think there's much good to be said for blind brand loyalty anymore."
AmItheAsshole,fdronch,t1_fdrkl9j,1578687443.0,"> Reddit as a whole does. Not this sub. It DID until the last six months or so.

I don't think one single thread gets made where someone isn't claiming that the sub is anti-man, anti-woman, anti-mothers, anti-fathers, etc. I think it's far more likely that most people posting here are after karma, which means you post fast and you post stupid. If you say something that goes against the grain, even if it's logical enough to warrant conversation, you get dinged so if you want points, you don't say those things; thus, the echo chamber lives on. And that echo chamber can change depending on who made the initial comments and placed the initial votes.

As for your ""demographic survey"", there were 1.2+ million subscribers on this sub when the survey was conducted. The survey took in replies from 15,000 people.

>Over 15,000 people completed the survey – a significant response, but still only a modest 1.5 percent of the sub's total users.

For starters, they admitted ""however, that some studies have found that women are typically more likely to complete surveys than men. One of AITA's moderators, Marc Beaulac, a 42-year-old photographer from Rhode Island, says he frequently deals with disruptive behaviour from ""angry, disaffected teen boys looking for a forum to be cruel to strangers or spread the beliefs of their radicalising male fringe groups"", and believes these users may have been less likely to take the survey.""

I see where ""77 percent of AITA subscribers are aged between 18 to 34 years old, with over 10 percent aged under 18 and only 3.4 percent aged 45 and over"" and ""(just under 70 percent) have never been married"" but I haven't seen anything about ""young moms"".

Obviously, there are a fair amount of young people present but we don't know their parental status (unless I missed that in the breakdown). I do know, however, that my age group has been charged with having kids later in life:

>Millennial women are waiting longer to become parents than prior generations did. In 2016, for instance, 48% of Millennial women (ages 20 to 35 at the time) were moms. But in 2000, when women from Generation X – those born between 1965 and 1980 – were the same age, 57% were already moms,

[Source](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/05/04/more-than-a-million-millennials-are-becoming-moms-each-year/)

Also, teen pregnancy has been declining:

>In 2017, a total of 194,377 babies were born to women aged 15–19 years, for a birth rate of 18.8 per 1,000 women in this age group. This is another record low for U.S. teens and a drop of 7% from 2016. Birth rates fell 10% for women aged 15–17 years and 6% for women aged 18–19 years.

[Source](https://www.cdc.gov/teenpregnancy/about/index.htm)

So I'm not sure where this particular complaint is coming from. /r/childfree itself has nearly 770k subscribers which I don't think is insignificant.

I highly doubt you'd hear and process if someone said it anyways, you seem a bit hard-headed... You literally acknowledged that you may not find a job, may not want to work where there are jobs anyways, and won't likely earn much if you *do* get hired and you don't care. What else do you want? I doubt personal stories are going to matter, you'll have to figure it out for yourself but it sounds like, to have become this snotty, you probably have parents to fall back on anyways so what does it matter?

This is going to be harsh but eh, this is my take on the matter...

Regarding your ""I go to a bougie school"" comment, no one really cares. I went to a fantastic private school for my undergrad. I know this is the only feather in your cap right now so it's a big deal to you but it's kind of cringey listening to a 20-something brag about this, I must say. And then to actually say you'd go to a *private school* for your *MLIS*, jesus christ... How about this? Before you head off into the sunset towards your *illustrious* research career, figure out how financial aid works for graduate degrees first.

Because I generally think you're too full of yourself to want actual feedback to consider anyways, I'm not going to give you my story in great detail. I'll just say that I work in public libraries but interned in academic. I chose public because academic was too political. I didn't like having to run every project, thought, breath, and bowel movement through a committee of 4+ people. After 3 months, I hadn't even completed a single 1.5 minute instructional video because I had to clear each version with 2+ other librarians, 1-2 teachers, etc. Total waste of time. In public libraries, I can create a concept and follow it through to completion inside of 2-12 months, depending on how big the project is. I can get a lecture scheduled, filmed, edited, and put on tv in 2 months. I can get an entire series of lectures done in 5-6 while working on several other projects at the same time.

I also wasn't sure that I wanted to commit to teaching college classes and I wasn't sure where my career would lead if I also didn't want to commit to writing academic papers to get my university's name out there. It just isn't me, I didn't feel it was useful beyond trying to secure funding for a library that probably isn't as well-funded as it should be anyways. /shrug

As a public librarian, I'm stressed. For the amount of pay I get, the workload is out of control. I just sold my house and moved for a new opportunity, specifically for a chance at a better work/life balance or at least better pay/benefits. But I'm enrolled in classes to pursue a second bachelor's just in case because I may just choose to leave the field entirely. I'm not the only librarian who is worn out. One of my coworkers, who only has a few years on me, is also looking for a shift in her career's angle. And I can't say the academic librarians I worked with were super thrilled either, some of them seemed downright fucking miserable.

Of course, plenty of people do love the job. I just think you're snotty and you think you're going to sail through private universities, both educationally and professionally, so that you never have to deal with the unwashed masses. I think it's probably more likely that you'll trip up and won't know how to react. Librarianship isn't as glamorous as you think and I don't know that you've got the grit for a struggle. But give it a shot. Give us an update in ~4-5 years."

Do you have an idea for what you'd want to do? I'm not exactly sure what I want next title-wise. I know I liked coding even though I had to work at it. I'm open to various options. I kind of just throw myself into whatever I'm doing at the time, my preferences are more environment/workload/stress-based these days.

>but my mental health is too much to handle.

I'm worried about this as well, I understand completely. If I go through with starting classes now, they'll begin as my new job starts which isn't ideal. But if my new job sucks, it's not like my mental health will get better and then I'll get stuck again. So I sort of feel like I just need to get started before it *could* get worse...which is a risk in and of itself so...

>...Is it bad that my first reaction to $10-15K in debt was ""Oh, only that much?"" Because it was. 

Yeah, that was kind of my reaction, too. We've already got a MLIS so I mean...we're already in the hole. lol

>Also, substance abuse, seriously?? Man people did NOT talk about this shit in grad school.

Haha, I know right? Nothing really tipped me off to how stressful the job could be and I was already working in a library as a page. But I was in a specialized location in a public library. I moved to a more mainstream location after that and I still didn't really see the librarians getting shoved around like I did. I was prepared to serve what might be a difficult community, go the extra mile, put in some hard work and long hours. I was not prepared to almost literally sacrifice myself for my job.

>Cheering for you over here. That's impressive.

>If you don't mind talking about it, what's your backup plan?

My undergrad was a mixed bag but I started in IT. I liked it but it didn't come easy to me. Since I was shy, when I got assigned group work and my classmates were slackers, I didn't have enough of a backbone to just say, ""Hey dickhead, could you stop screwing around and do your fucking work?"" So eventually I gave up and switched majors. I came from a working class family so I really just needed to graduate, I couldn't keep dicking around like the rich kids did.

Looking back, I wish I could have found a way to stick with it. My husband has an IT degree. His income outpaces mine by a sickening amount, so do his benefits, and he's far less stressed than I am. I don't think I could ever do his job but I could definitely incorporate my MLIS with an IT degree and change directions, ideally heading back to the for-profit sector. It's sad but I'm overworked and if this next job is the same way, I don't want to work for nonprofits anymore. At least in the for-profit sector you *could* eventually work your way into a good paying job; my chances for that now are very low. It's lose-lose. High work, low pay, dim future.

So I found an affordable school online that would allow me to transfer a ton of credits towards another bachelor's. They require 120 credits but you're allowed to transfer in up to 90 so I did. I think I can get the remaining 30 done in about 2 years. It sounds long but the problem is that while there are fewer classes left, they're all core classes so there are no electives to pad it out. Gotta go slow or I'll get swamped and mess it all up again.

I'm afraid, it'll likely be another $10-$15k but at this point what does it even matter? I'm disappointed, this was meant to be ""the answer"" but it's been hell.

>I'm glad to not be the only one to find librarianship super stressful though I am sorry you're also feeling the anxiety of it.

I talked to a librarian friend of mine about it recently and she expressed a desire to get back into the field - she kind of fell out and couldn't get back in - but said she found it stressful as well. I know 2 librarians who struggled with substance abuse, and that's just that I know of. Wtf is up with our field, man? If you ever wanna bitch about it, don't hesitate to reach out."
AmItheAsshole,fdeyma8,t1_fde8w9j,1578349375.0,">or dad who kept OP on back burner all their life?

See now, this is unfair. OP contradicted herself. She said they were extremely close for *14 years* and then stated that she has pinpointed the elopement as the ""exact incident for my relationship with my dad becoming very icy""; one individual turning point after 14 years. Now she says she's ""always been on the back burner"" and then no other information has been given. Until we get more information, you're really just picking which sentence you like more but the fact is, the two together don't currently tell a cohesive story.

>Between the nice mother they’ve been Raised by and never badmouthed dad

You don't have to openly badmouth your ex to make their life difficult. There are other ways, especially where custody and teenagers are concerned. Plenty goes on behind closed doors. OP wouldn't even necessarily be privy to this information herself, not even at 30 years of age. 

For example, OP says she got icy with her dad after this incident. He tried to apologize, she wasn't having any of it and has blocked all attempts at reconciliation since. Do we know that her mother ever intervened? Did they take her to therapy? Family counseling? She's saying she's super duper fine with it but it really sounds to me like she's still fucked up about it; she's literally using her own wedding, 16 years later, as a means to retaliate. I'm gonna guess the kid never made it to therapy...and it sounds like mom was the primary caregiver.

I'm not saying the mom intentionally allowed the relationship to fester through passivity, I'm only trying to demonstrate that we don't have enough info from OP and even if we got more, we don't have reliable info about the parents' relationship anyways; we could theorize nearly endlessly. Ultimately, do we really think this kind of emotional turmoil makes sense after 16 years? Or is this someone who could use some help? Reddit's need for aggressive retaliation isn't healthy sometimes...and some of you have no experience with the life events you're even commenting on. Christ, my dad's ex let him have visitation, no problem, didn't shit talk him either...but she wouldn't let my dad pick their kid up if my mom was in the car. He had to drop her off at a fucking gas station first or his ex would light into my dad and *she* divorced *him*! Why are internet randos going, ""oh yeah, uh huh, the mom definitely was an angel and the dad was a dirtbag, uh huh, for sure""?

AmItheAsshole,fdew4bw,t1_fddyfp0,1578347828.0,">I always felt put on the backburner in terms of gifts and vacations etc. It's pretty materialistic crap but it builds up.

I really just wish we had more details than this. I still feel confused between the above statement and this:

>I can confidently pinpoint this exact incident for my relationship with my dad becoming very icy. I was extremely close to him before this.

Prior to the elopement you claim you were extremely close and that it was his admittedly very stupid and very shitty decision that ripped you two apart. But when asked to clarify how your relationship could *still* be so icy 16 years later, you only come up with ""materialistic crap"" and ""*always* feeling put on the back burner"" which is vague and pretty flippant. What do you even mean by ""always"" if everything was fine for *14 years* and the wedding was what changed things?

I have a complicated relationship with my own parents - I'll spare you - so if he's been a bad parent I wouldn't even bat an eye at you being angry at or indifferent with him. I just think it's weird that after numerous comments over the course of 5 hours you've been very careful not to give further details demonstrating how he's so terrible as to warrant such indifference, which is really kind of worse than hatred. You can do whatever you want obviously, with your life, your wedding, etc. but how over it are you really if you aren't owning up to what seems to be, at least as presented, the truth? That you're still impacted by having been excluded and you're using your own wedding to retaliate *16 years later*. Which, again, your choice, but I'd say that calls for some soul searching. You went from loving him to accusing him of being a terrible parent overnight and so far have given only this one mistake as your explanation for why.

I feel it's also worth noting that he said he was worried your mother would start a fight if he'd tried to pick you up. That absolutely shouldn't have prevented him from coming for you. But do you, as the child, really know your mother *wouldn't* have gotten into a fight with him? I'm not saying this makes it her fault, I'm just wondering if you aren't privy to the full story and more than just one mistake was made during that time - and your dad is taking the full punishment solo. My dad divorced his first wife, my cousins have all pretty much divorced at least once, and my parents have had their own fights - conflict between parents can get ugly and kids don't always see that, nor should they. But sometimes it means kids walk away from the war zone thinking they know what happened when they don't. When not properly supported through that time, it can mean relationships get ruined exactly like this.

Obviously, I can't know that's what happened, maybe her dad really is a total dirtbag, but OP hasn't given examples of what makes this man a monster. At this point, I imagine his lack of involvement in her life, especially given that she began shutting him out as a teen, is partly due to her insistence - did her mom intervene in any way? Was she in therapy at all? Family counseling? And I think when exes are involved, especially when one is remarrying, it's worth considering that shit could have gotten messy. In which case, OP isn't a credible narrator for who was the ""good parent"", even at 30 because you can't really verify the truth anymore at this point.

I didn't know that the job would be so competitive and aggressive.

AmItheAsshole,fdc8b03,t1_fda2nzg,1578269059.0,">I’m actually surprised it took this far down before I got to a NAH — probably because Reddit skews younger and childless.

Normally I don't agree with this kind of statement and at first I agreed with the top comments that op wasn't the asshole but as I read more commentary and thought on it more, I realized NAH makes the most sense and the people who initially got upvoted probably *don't* have kids and/or by their own admission have shitty familial relationships. Notably, my own initial reaction is actually due to those factors - I don't have kids but if I did, I wouldn't trust my parents or my in-laws to be their primary daycare providers. 

But my coworkers have kids so I know that daycare can be a pain in the ass. I remember my coworker (Sarah) getting snarky af texts from her daycare provider, something to do with her kid not having his binky once and this woman expecting Sarah to drive 30 minutes home to pick it up, X minutes to drop it off, and then back to work because I guess she didn't have a spare binky for the boy for the day. Or anytime he'd get a bit fussy she'd text Sarah but she didn't seem to be just informing Sarah, she seemed to want Sarah to come get him. It got so annoying she had to put her name on a waiting list for a new daycare who she is now much happier with but I think she was with this other daycare for at least the first year. The only thing that alleviated the annoyance and cost was her mom babysitting ~twice a week. I know this is a daycare-specific problem but it happened and that's a consideration - not all daycares are going to be the same.

Plus, when he was legitimately sick, she *did* have to go pick him up. I remember her saying they had a ""3 blowout"" rule. I asked what that meant. If he shat himself so hard it blew out of his diaper 3 times she had to come get him. There were other rules as well, I just can't recall what they were. She had to go pick him up a number of times. And because she worked anywhere between 9am and 9pm, the daycare had to be closer to their home rather than closer to her job. It would have been out of her husband's way to get him on days she worked late. She was the one who had to rush home to get him 9 times out of 10 but it meant a 30 minute trip one way.

If for some reason my coworkers don't come to work sort of last minute (time off for an errand or something), they either took their kid to daycare anyways or paid for the day but kept them home. It wasn't like you paid for X number of days - like I do for my dogs' daycare lol - and you use them whenever. You seem to pay for X number of days/week within like a month. So Sarah paid for 3 days a week each month. If she didn't bring him in one day, that didn't carry over and you didn't get a refund.

But on the flip side, if the daycare closed for weather - which we remained open for 99% of the time - my coworkers either had to rely on family or, if they didn't have family, had to take vacation time to stay home with their kids. So it's not like daycare is more reliable than OP's MiL would be, unless he has reason to think she's a flake which I haven't seen mention of.

What's more, I've had my boss literally blow me off mid-conversation because she has to get to the daycare *RIGHT NOW* to get her kid. If you're late, you get dinged some insane fee. I get it, your employees want to go home and there has to be consequences for keeping employees late. But still, I've been in the middle of a meeting with her with her glancing at the clock because she knows she has to rush to the daycare. And OP works retail-type hours. I don't know how that's going to be more flexible for him.

As far as the MiL herself, paying for the apartment is only a tad different than just paying her cash. He could pay her cash which she could then put into the apartment. He acknowledges that the cost is about the same but hasn't really given much of a reason to prefer the daycare. If he had concerns about the MiL I'd get it but I haven't seen them. Every person who judged ""NTA"" due to their own bad families 1) needs to be in therapy, not projecting on random threads and 2) failed to consider *that he's willing to live with this woman for an entire year*; how bad can she be? The entire thread is so fucking muddy because of all the overemotional storytelling. 

The pros he lists for the daycare are easily covered by MiL. I mean, socialization? What do people think SAHPs do? Professionally certified? Again, are SAHPs chopped liver? Every point people have listed against the MiL either needs to be corroborated by OP (she'll be bossy, she'll be negligent, she'll be flaky, she'll ask for too much, etc.) - and haven't been - or could be countered by knowledge of daycare or just basic reasoning (re: SAHPs functioning just fine - I don't feel I lost out on anything not having been in a daycare). Which makes me wonder if OP either doesn't know what daycare entails or just doesn't want to pay his MiL that kind of money since she's family. Since I can't prove the latter - which would make him the asshole imo~ - the most reasonable judgement so far is NAH.

**~EDIT**: I've revisited the op and his comments to see if I could find info regarding the living arrangement he was proposing. In the op he mentioned her living with them but didn't mention any type of payment which leads me to believe he intends for it to be free. Later, he mentioned remodeling for $12k+ but, again, no mention of paying her for her time, he'd rather just put an addition onto his house that increases the value of his property but, again, puts nothing in his MiL's pocket. It really feels to me like he ultimately doesn't want to pay her, either much or at all. 

*He sees no reason to utilize her services unless the price comes under what a daycare would be* which he calculates to be $1000/month. Since I'm not sure how many days/hours this would get him at a daycare, let's just assume he pays her $1000 a month and see what that would come to hourly for a range of hours:

20 hours/week would be $12.50/hour

30 hours/week would be $8.33/hour

40 hours/week would be $6.25/hour

And remember, he only views her as a viable resource *as long as she costs less than that*. Imo this gets pretty close to OP being the asshole and doing his best not to say too much that makes that obvious...yet I think he slipped up when he mentioned that his MiL's house is larger than theirs. I mean, what does that even matter? Is he asking to move the family into her home? No? Then why say that? I think he figures she's got enough money and should either be super cheap or free. But since I can't prove it with the little he's given... /shrug"

To start, all I can find is that she smoked pot at 13. Pot is not a hard drug.

Second, even if you find info stating she used other drugs around the same age, your entire argument with regards to Carrie Fisher stems from your apparent personal, first-person, in-depth knowledge that of course, being wealthy, she'd have had access to the best doctors, the most prompt care, and the very *second* any symptom appeared she'd be whisked away to a doctor who'd immediately diagnose her. So that she wasn't diagnosed until ~24 means she absolutely wouldn't have had it prior.

The reality of life is that you don't know this. It could have been missed. Growing up around partying, it could have been seen as normal rich girl rebellion, a girl with too much money and too little supervision running around with the big boys and girls while her parents were busy - exactly what you describe, funnily enough - someone who just likes to party. Emotional outbursts, unstable relationships, fear of abandonment, etc....all possible ""symptoms"" of being a spoiled rich teen with divorced parents. She wasn't even diagnosed until she *ODed*. You have no reason to believe BPD didn't manifest earlier than 24. Carrie, herself, stated that her drug use was self-medication. I think it best that we just leave it as it is instead of trying to create a separate narrative from Carrie's to make a point.

changemyview,fcg479e,t1_fcbem77,1577636369.0,">The taxes can be used to help local and federal government agencies.

The idea behind not taxing nonprofits is that we will, in turn, use that saved money to further our social missions. For example, libraries are already providing a service to the public. Including helping said government who you want to have double (triple?) dip. Libraries have already been tapped to help the government with the 2020 census and we've been given very little aid to do it with. We always step in to fill the gaps other organizations leave behind. We already do our part. Additionally, our budgets get slashed almost every year so I'm not sure why you are looking to nonprofits to ""reduce the increasing rate of the American deficit"". Ever hear the phrase, ""You can't squeeze blood from a turnip""? This is what you are doing. And at the cost of public services. It would be like the human body, when hungry, turning to eat its own vital organs when you've still got a muffin top.

You're hitting up the wrong people, perhaps to make a personal case against churches. But we nonprofits are already often running on fumes. If you need us to serve society with little pay, little time, and little staff, take budget cuts, and then pay taxes because you can't think of anywhere else to make cuts...you haven't looked very hard to find the fatty bits.

Admittedly, there are larger nonprofits that I guarantee you are crooked af. But that's not a point for taxing all nonprofits of varying sizes, missions, etc., it's a point for holding everyone accountable.

**EDIT**: Seriously? I had 2 downvotes in under 10 minutes but 0 replies/ops for conversation after 30+...and now I have to leave... I'm just saying that if you want to implement a ""tax all"" initiative you have to remember that you are also taxing social organizations with fewer than 10-20 staff members, who often make very little, and who operate with almost no budget - a budget that gets cut most years anyways, which is what forces them to spend more staff time fundraising to stay open and less on the actual organization's mission. 

You also **must** acknowledge that what started this was OP's original goal to specifically target mega-churches, he only mentioned religious organizations in his OP. He only added *all* nonprofits when asked - he either had to say yes or admit to being biased which is still suspect to me because most of his posts deal with churches specifically, he doesn't have any detailed rants against his local library or pet rescue. Going after all just to go after one out of personal spite is dangerous. I don't agree with mega-churches either but I don't agree with punishing everyone, nor do I think using the little guy to clean up the big guy's debt is fair.

OP then turns to the argument that taxing a little 5 person operation on a ""sliding scale"" could help the country's debt - also not part of his initial argument - when we've got billionaires not paying a cent. I still think he's got a fuzzy kind of argument that is really just meant to target one group, a group that I do agree often misspends. But as I said, taxing *everyone* to make up for someone being crooked isn't a one-to-one solution. It would be like fining all amusement parks every time one ride malfunctions in one park or some weird shit. Just go after the offending party..."
AmItheAsshole,fcfugel,t1_fcfatzp,1577633834.0,">They have a kid together. In most relationships that is the time that they start not having their own bank accounts and paying for each others' stuff, but having a more shared account.

I agree with /u/wanderingdev, you're also usually married by now. I don't mean this like ""for shaammeee"" but rather by the time you are having kids, you're usually already *legally entangled*. Those who are not probably do often still have separate bank accounts. Hell, even married couples sometimes have separate bank accounts. My husband and I personally do not but if it works for someone else, it feels unfair to invalidate how they work their lives.

>gave birth to a child! Not easy, and 100% will slow down or even stop her education. Not her fault, not OP's fault, but that's a sacrifice.

You keep repeating this sentiment but did you see where he wrote:

>**she has just failed to show any interest in work or a career before or after baby**

Why do you keep insisting she has to go back to college, and he has to fund it - because paying for material needs is ""being a sugar daddy"" but paying for college is not? - when she may not even want to go...... 

Also, as has been pointed out elsewhere, while I'm sure pregnant women everywhere appreciate your concern, you are severely downplaying the reality of life for many women. While I was in grad school, one of my project partners (that I knew of) was pregnant and said she could go into labor mid-project. When I go to work conferences - that last for *days* - there are women who attend while heavily pregnant *and* sometimes carting around a small child. Hell, for this last conference my own coworker was heavily pregnant. She has 1 kid and is pregnant with her second. Another woman secured a job as Director, got pregnant, and then wanted to keep working from home even after giving birth. Women *frequently* work to make life what we want, we don't just shut down and hope to be rescued.

Sure, it doesn't always happen this way but you're trying to put him in charge of her life and while you mean well, it's a bit unintentionally condescending. If she wants to do it, she can do it. Mind you, the financial aspect is only one potential hang-up; the reality of life is that sometimes you gotta put plans on hold, he might be able to blow the rest of his inheritance on a degree she doesn't want but she still has to find time for the classes, homework, studying, and her family which is going to be harder than getting a fed loan, imo. But right now, she's his gf, not his wife. In terms of wills and inheritances, marriages are absolutely considered. For example, if someone knows their nephew's spouse is terrible with money, they may leave less or leave it behind in a different manner. Because note that the OP isn't saying he doesn't want to share, he already is. He's afraid of money management which, imo, is the real problem. He just had a baby with a woman who has no interest in work and who he doesn't trust to manage finances. Finances are the biggest problem couples face and I think this is going to be a problem long after the inheritance is gone.

You also seem to think $135k is a fortune. It could be positively life-changing for many people but it isn't going to stretch as far as you think. I have my master's and I can tell you right now my dear, my student debt as it stands would eat riiiight fucking through that. There'd be a nice chunk left but the remainder would not likely fund a 4-year degree, unless 2 years were at a CC and the last 2 were at a state uni. But they've got a kid, she doesn't necessarily want to go back to college anyways...that money would likely be best in a savings account. I don't know why you are so eager to spend spend spend for something no one wants with an infant in the mix.

I agree that lying isn't good but I don't agree with your insistence that he pay for a degree she doesn't seem to want."

You have such low expectations. He picked someone else but because he didn't wanna boink the past day 10 days it's romance? *You. Are. His. Dirty. Secret.* Did it occur to you that maybe he'd already fucked his fiance? Maybe he wasn't in the mood. I wouldn't go dancing around the room singing love songs. 

Even sadder, he probably told her he was hanging with the dudes those days, helping his parents, at work, sick...he doesn't want you and doesn't include you, in his life, with his family, with his real future, with life security, etc. and yet you can't breathe without this person who told you he doesn't actually want to spend his life with you. He wants you to stay hidden, be there how/when he wants, and then disappear. No one will ever know you ""love""/obsess about him, you'll never get married or go on your honeymoon or go to family holidays. 

You're definitely as much of an asshole here as he is. You're just the submissive asshole with no future. And I think you know this which is why, when I asked, you couldn't immediately launch into your brilliant plans for how being an obsessed, adoring secret is going to work long term, after they marry, possibly move away, possibly have kids... In reality, if his life gets busier after marriage you'll be the first thing to go and the last thing he thinks about. You can't even explain why, after being told you are second, that you think that's all you're worth.

He's using you. You're obsessed. He loves that you're his fangirl. Know how I know sex is a major part of it? He ""*loves*"" you so much he's perfectly fine with you marrying and fucking another man, just as long as you'll fuck him too when he calls

I don't understand this. Are you saying that one should not pursue damage done to one's property because it's only a matter of material objects? Or is there a line and where do you draw it? It's only a tablet. It's only a cell phone. It's only a signed copy of a beloved book. It's only a couch. It's only a car. It's only the carpeting in your living room. It's only a priceless action figure.

Or are you drawing a line distinctly different from the law because it's family?

Is it a dollar amount? Your personal perception of worth?

If you're basing this on your own perception of what someone else's belongings are worth, that would be narcissistic. You shouldn't feel welcome to decide that for others. And the law won't agree.

AmItheAsshole,fc3tzw3,t1_fc3miuq,1577398589.0,">Yeah...as usual, the real truth is in the comments:

And of course, the top comment - which will stroke the OP's ego - was made without them and never revisited. Le frustration.

From a practical standpoint, when dealing with children I think having people count off every so often isn't a bad idea; my teachers did it to ""mix the pot"" a bit. But, having been bullied, I can't agree that not being picked to join a group is the same thing. Middle school won't likely be the last time you find yourself solo. And I dunno what the OP thinks is going to happen when she heads off to college, most of the time we picked our partners anyways and yeah, a few times I ended up solo because I was quiet and shy. Life doesn't really get *easier* from here, I'm 31 and still dealing with petty friend-favoritism-at-work shit. By now it's just old hat and kinda pathetic.

It's hard to explain but there are certain aspects of awkwardness, loneliness, and sadness that just need to be learned and dealt with. You can't call every instance of being unhappy ""bullying"". My dad wasn't a coddler, he never would have considered reacting to this sort of thing - I can't say I even talked about it, it was kid politics. But when he found out I was *actually* being bullied? Like hit, tripped, yelled at, etc.? Oh hell yeah, he fucking lunged and had the problem solved inside of a week. 

This kid is so emotionally sensitive that she cries to her mom about being ""bullied"" by being picked last, and mom attacks. The two behaviors are linked; one caused the other. When this shit keeps up and OP keeps tracking after her, it's just going to ruin the kid's life. Or when OP *stops* tracking after her, the kid won't know what to do."
AmItheAsshole,fc3sc72,t1_fc3nokt,1577397383.0,"I agree with the other poster that OP was definitely annoying with the phone calls but I'm perplexed by their notion that, I guess, only dumb people put themselves at risk? So either she was super smart and knew what she was doing *or*, had something gone wrong, she must have been dense.

>OP is being patronizing by implying she can't use her brain to stay safe. [cut] I'm sure she's a grown up who's capable of taking care of herself and won't intentionally put herself in dangerous situations.

Note that the delineation is becoming a victim - as phrased, their argument unintentionally means if you have been victimized you must not have ""used your brain"" or ""been capable of taking care of yourself"". I don't know what you are supposed to learn from this. It may seem like I am nitpicking but consider this: people have been harmed doing absolutely nothing wrong. People have put themselves at risk and had nothing happen. So the lesson really is, or should be, that you can't hide in your house but you should try to be self-aware and aware of your surroundings. Following from this, an 8-months pregnant woman is factually an easy target. Does this mean she should be locked up at home? Absolutely not. Should she be working alone, at night, in a bar when apparently no one else knew she was alone? Prooobably not. OP went overboard with contacting her but is it really crazy to think he was worried?

At the end of the day, while I appreciate the rabid feminism, women *do* have to be mindful. I work at a library (all female staff) and we won't even *open* if there aren't 3 people on. If 1 person is running late, the doors are to remain *locked*. And that is in a pretty safe community in broad daylight. Even then, my boss - who I guess must ""not have used her brain"" - was mugged a few months ago. Shocked everyone.

Perhaps working with the public, as I do, has made me aware of how easily things can go tits up. And I suffer from no delusions regarding my *physical* abilities.
