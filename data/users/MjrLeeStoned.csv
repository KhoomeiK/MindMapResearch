All of these are free for basic filers, and extremely simple.  If it seems like it's too easy, you're probably doing it right.  Tax filing basic returns (just a w-2, for example) is a very simple process.

If you're dealing with various types of insurance policies, dividends, divestitures, IRAs, or pretty much any investment of any kind, you're better off finding an accountant.

Bad_Cop_No_Donut,fehay2n,t1_feh34kf,1579112809.0,"Your father has a mental illness / disorder etc and it causes him to experience adverse physical and psychological distress (depression, suicidal tendencies).

That's the difference.

A person can be autistic and never experience any adverse effects of it their entire life, because being autistic is not a guarantee there will be any debilitation physically or psychologically.

How can you have a mental illness if you will never suffer any negative mental or psychological symptoms or debilities?  That's the difference.  You can be autistic and never have any negative side effects from it whatsoever, but if you have a mental illness, you are inherently suffering negative effects due to the illness.

And people want to point to medical guidelines on autism as if that somehow says a person will have some negative outcome due to autism.  That's not true at all.  They can still have the same outcomes in their life as someone who isn't autistic, even without therapy or medication or anything at all.

Autism doesn't effect the outcome, only the mechanism specific to that person.  You may learn differently.  You may work differently.  You may interact with people differently.  And all these could be considered a deficit, sure, but that doesn't mean you'll experience any negative outcomes because of it.

It's like saying being bald is an illness.  I'm different because I have no hair, but having no hair does not mean I will suffer."

Guess what?  People are different.

Does that mean that autistic people are not ""different"" than neurotypical people?  That's not what I'm saying at all.  Of course they are.

My original comments, and every other comment up to this point, has not once said autistic people are the same as ""normal"" people.  I don't know where people got that I was saying this.

All I've said is there's a stark, medical and academic difference between an illness and a developmental / analytical / behavioral abnormality.  My comments have only been stating that point.  Stop taking cues from other people's comments."

I'm ignoring your follow-up question because if your basis is the above sentiment, then your follow-up question is not going to hold any water.

There is no guarantee a person with autism will behave differently than anyone.  Autism is not inherently a behavioral issue.  There are plenty of people with autism who can behave, learn, and interact the same as everyone else.

You've missed the mark.  Maybe try again."
Bad_Cop_No_Donut,fegv3kt,t1_fegum8e,1579103205.0,"You've missed the point so I'll excuse the outburst.

I'm not sure how you got to the conclusion I was trying to say autism doesn't affect people.  That's a side street only you went down.

The point is to say as a disease or illness has symptoms or side-effects, a person with autism may have no negative symptoms their entire life.  That's why it's not an illness.  There is nothing inherently negative about autism in general, and people who think there is, always, are wrong and uneducated.

Now, so you don't misunderstand again: I am not saying that people with autism have no negative symptoms or problems. I am saying that's why it's not an illness: just because you have autism does not mean you will have negative symptoms or problems because of it."

Bad_Cop_No_Donut,fegrk5w,t1_fegiy3v,1579100878.0,"Because illness means there is something wrong inherently, and something has changed.

Often, you can't even tell the difference between an autistic person and a ""normal"" (non-autistic) person.

An illness changes you; autistic people are not changed.  They weren't ""normal"" up to a certain period and then just changed into something else.

It is a physical state of the body that causes a differing mental process in relation to others, not in relation to ""normal"".  Autistic just means different.  It doesn't mean bad or wrong.  And it's relative to other people, not relative to a specific default human template.

And if that doesn't help explain it, let's look at it this way:

You have a liver.  Your liver is healthy.  You get an illness that causes liver disease.  Your liver changes.

Her friend didn't tell her because she thought it was a new animated filter.  She didn't notice because she was too busy trying to find the right position where she could photoshop herself and not mess with the surroundings in the picture.

No point to this comment other than to say that if you don't own your own compressor, finding somewhere that can do 110 psi is kinda hard."
facepalm,fdnzcg8,t1_fdnkbxn,1578595918.0,"30 psi spread out over the entire surface of the inside of the tire and the pressure against the road.

30 psi (or close too it, not getting too technical in this comment) pushing air through a small slit made by a knife point is kinda different and could definitely launch said knife into someone's body.

You've been warned."

He strikes me as someone who acts larger than life because he's literally larger than life, but in a positive way.  Never heard him say anything negative once in the few hours I've been in his presence (and the two times for work were in a professional setting, no PR / cameras / public etc).

If someone presented him with a negative scenario, he'd always twist it into something funny at the very least.

He definitely has the personality of someone who wasn't wealthy, became wealthy, and is grateful for it."

ShittyLifeProTips,fdni58t,t1_fdl7ed0,1578586300.0,"Cellulose can't be broken down by the human digestive system at all (other than by chewing).

Most cellulose can't even be broken down by, say, cows for the most part, either, even though they primarily eat food that is nothing but cellulose.  Their stomach / gut bacteria facilitates breaking it down for them to a mush that can be absorbed.

And it's not waste, as in a byproduct, it's just undigested material.  It pretty much comes out in a similar fashion it went in, relatively intact.

And nearly all plant (fruit, vegetable, grain etc) cells contain cellulose.  What we can absorb is usually broken down in the mouth by our teeth, releasing other less complex sugars like fiber.  The rest just passes through for the most part.  And you can see it, too.  Things like corn kernel shells, apple skins, certain parts of lettuce and celery etc.  If you can tell what it is when it comes out in the toilet (or wherever), then chances are it contains either extremely compact proteins and fats (like nuts), or cellulose (like corn)."

Until I remember it's a TV show, and not something that actually has an impact on my specific life other than the entertainment I received (or didn't) while I was watching it.

This hyperbole jargon over something as trivial as a video story amazes me.  Not that it hasn't always existed, but it seems that the internet has been turned into a platform for bandwagoning your perceived plights.

Now, I'm no means one to disparage people from enjoying something, but if you get to judge a couple of people for writing something as long-term trivial as a TV show, then I'm sure you're someone who would welcome me judging you for caring enough to put forth months-worth of effort to continue judging someone who wrote a TV show.

And not to mention that people would rather brigade against someone pointing out the triviality than actually admit they've done nothing productive with their effort other than...well...entertain people like me."
