The reason they were made to resemble coins is because there were coinage shortages during various periods (depressions, wars, etc.) and sinkers would issue these and people would end up circulating them as coins, like the US cent or UK Penny. They became known as ""hard times tokens"" etc.

The government actually took some action to try to stop this - early on in the US for example they actually were putting ""1 cent"" as a value on them, making them look like a real coin and were forced to stop doing that.

I'm not expert on UK tokens but it's quite possible that the same reasoning went behind making early tokens resemble coins there too - coinage shortages."
