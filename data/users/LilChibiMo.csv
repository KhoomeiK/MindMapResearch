Red flags I didn’t see:

🚩Would stare at only *me* when we were in a group.

🚩Wouldn’t take “no” for an answer.  I literally had to slap him once to get him to stop what he was doing.

🚩He’d drop something and tell me to get it when it was right there in front of him (I actually snapped at him “it’s right there in front of you, *you* get it!”.  His reply? “But, I’m *sooo* busy!”.  Now, mind you, we were both working on the same project and he couldn’t even stop for five seconds to pick something up?

And before you say anything, he was hitting on my best friend, behind my back (who already HAD a boyfriend), and when I called him out on it, he was like “I don’t know WHAT you’re talking about! I never did any of that!”.
Guess what happened after that.  Go ahead. Guess."
