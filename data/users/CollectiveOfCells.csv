taoism,fdiel4q,t3_eliwwg,1578441140.0,"I'm one of those that appropriate practices from any spiritual path. There is a Buddhist meditation called ""loving-kindness"" or ""metta"" meditation. First you focus on those that are easiest to find compassion for; family or loved ones. Once you feel filled with compassion, move on to random strangers. I used to take the bus to work and I would look around and find someone to develop compassion for. Then finally moving on to absolute monsters/dictators that have caused so much human suffering.   


The first of the three treasures of Taoism is ci (Chinese: 慈) which is usually translated as   'compassion, tenderness, love, mercy, kindness, gentleness, benevolence.' But it is also Classical Chinese for 'mother.'  


A mother doesn't desert a child when they act up, she knows they do it out of ignorance. I have Asperger's and one of the hardest groups of people for me to forgive were the children who made fun of me or picked on me as a child. But eventually I realized I didn't want to spend the rest of my life carrying around that baggage.   


Be like water and take the easiest path. Living with hate or anger is too much work. When you've conquered your animosity towards them, you'll be free."

But I would advise against owning either breed unless you are ready for a big commitment. Chow Chows are very high strung and you may come home to your entire house ripped to shreds. You need to exercise them daily and possibly have a companion when you are away.
