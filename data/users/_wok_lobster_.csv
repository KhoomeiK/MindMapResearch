I looked at the train stuff and it would have taken me about 2 hours (best case, everything on time and the train is there right when I get off the bus). I wish we had better transit here. Never been to NYC or LA. I think I went on BART once, a long time ago."

You can go all over the city getting on and off all day doing touristy shit and spend like less than $15-20 on transit for the entire day. I think they have commuter passes or something with better rates for the locals, but even then they're not getting on and off the trains all day. Couple stops in the morning, couple in the afternoon."

Like good food too, not some dank Subway shop and a combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. I'm sure that the good food is because of the volume of hungry people passing through constantly. Like the Fort Worth Amtrak station has a Subway shop and a vending machine. But its also not a major transit hub the way some of the metro stations in tokyo are.

Also google maps can tell you which entrance to enter or exit from to be closest to where you need to get to, and google maps also maps the station interiors, making it really easy to get around despite the massive labarynthine stations."
