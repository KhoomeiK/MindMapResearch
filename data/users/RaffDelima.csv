EliteDangerous,ffoly6j,t1_fflpls0,1580078978.0,I mean nothing would stop you. Hell a sidewinder is more advanced then anything we have on Earth right now. Imagine coming in a goddamn Corvette prepped for fighting. You’d be unstoppable.
EliteDangerous,ffol7c4,t1_ffokzev,1580078836.0,Same as well. It’s a good ship.
EliteDangerous,ffkcjiu,t1_ffk7g5q,1580020535.0,"Had to clarify I mean right now. You’d have access to a ship capable of traveling off world without a space program, have stronger firepower then most countries militaries and have the most advanced vehicle on the planet."
EliteDangerous,ffkbg27,t1_ffkawz0,1580020036.0,Kind of hard until we get space legs. I keep forgetting that the Anaconda is about the size of a football stadium (that’s what I’ve heard at least).
EliteDangerous,ffkaocf,t1_ffk7l9t,1580019688.0,True. The Python is a beautiful ship. It’s one of my personal favorites.
EliteDangerous,ffk6919,t1_ffk6884,1580017234.0,Fair enough.
EliteDangerous,ffk685h,t1_ffk62bc,1580017211.0,Well good pick in my opinion.
EliteDangerous,ffjs1e0,t1_ffjndll,1580005389.0,Yeah fair enough. Though I still need to “get good” at flying. A trip through an asteroid field with flight assist off and no shields should do the trick. Preferably with a cheap ship.
godtiersuperpowers,ffixdbv,t3_etqno9,1579985033.0,"As cool as  this would be the downside to this is that mistakes can be a good lesson and taking away that chance would deprive you of getting better. 

On the other hand for life’s big mistakes this might help. So I’m a little conflicted."
EliteDangerous,ffh58gl,t1_ffh4fmp,1579923462.0,Well it’s not a bad idea. And it seems other people agree.
EliteDangerous,ffgz239,t3_etesxy,1579918747.0,Seriously you think this is dumb? That’s brilliant! That’d make this game feel a lot less empty.
EliteDangerous,ffgwur4,t1_ffff374,1579917102.0,Yep. According to pretty much everyone here we’ve all had that moment. Why are those damn things so easy to forget?!
EliteDangerous,ffgwq2n,t1_fff1zzy,1579917006.0,Yeah I’m too paranoid with myself to have tried that. I don’t trust my skill enough to fly without rebuy.
EliteDangerous,ffgwngu,t1_ffeq2qq,1579916953.0,"Ouch, I’ve never gotten to the point where that’s happened (although to be honest I’m not prepared for a journey like that yet) thanks for the heads up. Also happy cake day."
EliteDangerous,ffgw9qo,t1_ffgeihg,1579916672.0,Thank you.
EliteDangerous,fffgqb2,t1_ffff9yw,1579883596.0,What’s the process to be a fuel rat? Curious to know about the process. Honestly I’ve never needed to be recused by you guys (I’ve cut it close a few times though).
EliteDangerous,fffeu75,t1_fff3r8d,1579882421.0,"It’s always the damn limpets. #1 thing I’ve seen so far. Glad those stupid things are synthesizable. 

For you though forgetting limpets means both you and your client are in a thought spot, that’s rough. 

Speaking of which thanks for your work. Thanks for going out of your way to help those in need."
EliteDangerous,fffbjod,t1_fffa5k6,1579880337.0,Did that for a while. That sucks.
EliteDangerous,ffenko2,t1_ffemlu4,1579856037.0,I’m relatively new myself (it will be almost a month soon since I started) and I already have an Anaconda (hell I own two). The Anaconda is pretty damn good but without a goal it’s pointless. Which is why I outfited one for mining (which got me my first one) and I’m outfitting my other one for joining the fuel rats and helping to rebuild stations.
EliteDangerous,ffenegu,t1_ffen4sp,1579855782.0,Well I haven’t used a fighter bay yet so I wouldn’t have known (and now I do). No clue why just hasn’t happened yet. And I have ships that can launch ships.
EliteDangerous,ffenan0,t1_ffen75z,1579855624.0,Ouch.
offmychest,ffen8vw,t1_ffen0qt,1579855550.0,"I mean that’s fine. Personally I’m not going to attack you for who you voted for and I won’t attack you because you like some of his policies. Never believed in attacking someone for their political affiliations won’t start now. 

But as an immigrant I do agree it needs to be strict and you need to immigrate in the proper way, but it’s such a pain in the ass, it needs to be simplified. But honestly I feel it’s that way to deter people from coming in."
offmychest,ffembrw,t1_ffekfoa,1579854244.0,"Yep. As an immigrant that took 20+ years to become a citizen (because our first immigrant lawyer was shit and the second had to fix everything). I had so many people on the right say that it’s so easy and that I needed to “site my sources” because it was impossible that it was that hard. Hell I was the damn source, I was talking about my own experiences and I heard “no that’s not true you’re lying it’s impossible to take that long, it takes 2 years, max.” and hearing about how easy it was to come in before Trump. 

No it was never easy, in fact from my own personal experience it’s pretty difficult and my family didn’t shortcut our way through, my parents didn’t pretend to marry someone for the citizenship. We wanted to come in the proper way and we did. And it’s quite fucking difficult."
EliteDangerous,ffelyk4,t1_ffeksyz,1579853739.0,Hell I’ve forgot to drop the damn cargo WHILE I WAS ALREADY AT THE LOCATION. So hey I’ve made dumber mistakes. So don’t feel bad.
EliteDangerous,ffeluk2,t1_ffekjof,1579853591.0,"You know I thought I was the only one. But now I’m seeing that’s been the most common one so far. So glad to know I’m not the only one. 

Also now that you’re bringing that up, why the fuck is something so important so tricky to find? Honestly I never thought about it until you brought it up."
offmychest,ffelops,t3_esswv6,1579853376.0,"The Fuck what? As someone who volunteers with helping take care of kids (family business) and as someone who wants to be a father I cannot understand whatsoever why people would defend that, much less here on Reddit."
EliteMiners,ffejxlf,t3_esyzgp,1579851108.0,Honestly I did the same. I try to aim for 20+. Easy to do when you’re in Borann system  planet A2 has a triple hotspot for LTD. Another user pointed that out and it was Very helpful.
EliteDangerous,ffejsw1,t1_ffejnhw,1579850948.0,Yep. Definitely know that pain.
EliteDangerous,ffejsbt,t1_ffejgm7,1579850929.0,Been there after outfitting an Anaconda for mining (and got tired of constantly having to outfitting it all the time) I forgot to add the damn refinery and thought to myself at the site “How?!”
EliteDangerous,ffejo7k,t1_ffejhv8,1579850786.0,Hence why I put “cheap” in my title and clarified for those that have more expensive ships.
godtiersuperpowers,ffejdui,t3_ess5el,1579850435.0,"As a filmmaking student I’d use that for one of my favorite directors, Steven Spielberg (yes I know some people don’t like him, but he’s why I got into filmmaking)"
EliteDangerous,ffej6mg,t1_ffej2s0,1579850189.0,Oof. That sucks.
EliteDangerous,ffej14j,t1_ffeiwzo,1579850005.0,Yep I know your pain. Almost forgot them again going mining. Had to to turn around to the station before I got too far away.
EliteDangerous,ffeiy2y,t1_ffeipz0,1579849905.0,I’ve cut it close a few times but thankfully I haven’t run out of fuel yet (mostly because I don’t want to want to waste a fuel rats time when they could be helping someone else).
EliteDangerous,ffeiiku,t1_ffeii2y,1579849391.0,Lol.
EliteDangerous,ffeicps,t1_ffei9av,1579849202.0,"For what I had to do to engineer my DBX to be as light as possible I wouldn’t fart in that thing, much less fight in it."
EliteDangerous,ffei9or,t1_ffegyp1,1579849104.0,From what I’ve heard it’s a good fighter.
EliteDangerous,ffei8w6,t1_ffeh6ql,1579849078.0,Never tried a dolphin. Might consider trying one.
EliteDangerous,ffei7fk,t1_ffei3vc,1579849029.0,"Of course I would agree. Great low heat signature, great for bringing to guardian structures second best jump range in the game (if I’m not mistaken). There’s a lot to love about it."
EliteDangerous,ffegvek,t1_ffefxth,1579847507.0,Yes I love that one too. I actually rebought it recently.
EliteDangerous,ffbe371,t3_esf6zc,1579761377.0,"I’d still have hope. Tech is always improving. Who knows it might still be possible one day.

I don’t think we’d reach Elite Dangerous levels (although admittedly that’d be awesome) but something basic might still one day be possible. 

We used to not fly or go into space at all. Look how that changed."
rant,ff8tt5o,t3_es3xb4,1579695829.0,"Yeah I know the feeling. 

One of the most ridiculous requests I saw was from a startup that was establishing themselves. 

Entry level
-No pay
-Wanted 10 years of experience 
-Wanted someone in their 20’s
-Wanted said person to already have all the required software and hardware for the job
-Position required 10+ hours daily work

And my response to that was “How?!!!” I work with video so it’s amazing how many people think that we don’t need to be paid because we do it “for the art” or “will be paid in exposure”. But that was one of the worst job offers I’d ever seen."
EliteDangerous,ff5fs6m,t1_ff5f089,1579590956.0,"Sort of where I am now. Already unlocked some engineering and I’m getting some guardian tech right now. This Anaconda has helped fund those missions. 

Actually I enjoy using that ship (I currently have two for personal reasons), which is interesting I kept hearing so many bad things I was expecting the worse. My uses for that ship have now evolved since I made that post. My original goal was to help people with that ships. Some people have recommended either join the fuel rats or help rebuild stations. 

So this ships is perfect for that. Although I’ve started buying other ships (and rebought some old olds I enjoyed using) and started to build them for specific purposes. 

So for now I’m enjoying doing the other things the game has to offer, without the limitations from a lack of credits. 

Although the credits and ships weren’t an end goal, having to the freedom to play anyway I wanted was. As for now I need to unlock everything else, maybe go visit Sol once I get that permit, maybe get those unlock-able ships. I still have plenty to do thankfully."
rant,ff4qhye,t3_erd0gw,1579570007.0,Yep. I know the feeling.
EliteDangerous,ff40vdb,t1_ff406qx,1579553108.0,"Honestly if they could make the player factions a thing (like the fuel rats comes to mind) it would:
1.Show the community that frontier actually cares and recognizes them. 
2.Would give identification to those who are non violent (again fuel rats because last thing I want is to have a fuel rat be blown up while I’m stuck in the middle of nowhere with no fuel). 
3.Pretty much repeating what you said. Having something created by players would be a thing to keep the game going by itself."
EliteMiners,ff3y9im,t1_ff399j5,1579551479.0,"I have an anaconda and four mining lasers. I should be fine.

Edit: best spot ever. It’s closer then my other one was and finding decent prices to sell nearby was a lot easier and closer. And to top it all off nearly every spot has a good chance to held a lot of diamonds. I spent a lot less time wasting limpets then I do normally."
EliteDangerous,ff3xthj,t1_ff3wtgg,1579551203.0,Well that’s next on my to go list once I get the permit. If I could stay there I would.
Showerthoughts,ff2uako,t3_er5mf7,1579524435.0,"Well I actually had to scan photos for a friend’s family member that passed away and out then in a slideshow. I don’t think at any point when she was taking those pictures l, she would’ve thought that those would’ve been shown in her funeral."
offmychest,ff2tycq,t3_er8boj,1579524051.0,This was so wholesome. I love it.
EliteMiners,ff2tbyz,t1_ff2nuou,1579523304.0,Oooh nice. Thanks for the location.
EliteMiners,ff2t7v1,t3_erawgv,1579523162.0,"Low temperature diamonds are still decent in price. Those have still been consistently profitable to me. Even selling at the same station multiple times or looking at the prices given on inara, they still hold up it seems."
EliteDangerous,ff2t0ab,t1_ff2smpr,1579522898.0,"Yeah. I went there. The price point kind of kills me there. I mean I ended up making a lot more credits thanks to my newly acquired anaconda, I could afford it but I’m not a fan of paying more for something I could get on discount. 

Hell that’s one of the main reasons I have ray gateway in Diaguandri as my main home base. Love the selection of ships and it pretty much has every electronic component (at least to my knowledge) AND everything is on discount. 

But it is useful if you’re in desperate need to find something that station is good."
EliteDangerous,ff2olje,t1_ff2mehk,1579516562.0,"Well. A lot of those seem like good options that I’m definitely considering. Actually I didn’t even consider half the stuff you listed, so hey new goals. 

Thankfully I’m quickly starting to build credits with my Anaconda mining (which honestly the credits needed for that is ridiculous)

The thing is I got a lot of good opinions of what I could do. One I’m definitely considering is building up a fleet and see if I can do some good for the community. Definitely considering either going down the fuel rat path or helping to rebuild broken stations. 

I might consider joining a squadron or go bounty hunting as well but let’s be honest I need to train a lot before I get to there (still new).

The only things I can’t see myself doing is griefing and pirating. I mean, I can’t even bring myself to screw with the NPC’s much less an actual player. 

But yeah I just next on my re-evaluated to do list is:

-Probably half or most of the stuff you’ve mentioned. 

-Join the fuel rats, help rebuild broken space stations (which I didn’t know that was an option), just in general player factions that help. I’ve found out so many just from this post alone. 

-Help fighting Thargoids (of course that won’t be for a while). 

-Rescue people from burning stations (that current event might help. 

-Find our which faction to join, finding out which is lore wise the less shitty of the bunch. Leaning towards is Li Yong-Rui  because at the moment my home station is in Ray Gateway in Diaguandri (so I have some gratitude). And for my understanding of this game I know he’s independent and tech based. 

-Complete Federation and Empire ranks because...ships and locked systems if I’m being honest. Don’t like being denied access to stuff. 

-Getting the Sol permit because hey it’s home. (Also why I’ve started ranking up with the Federation first). Also I want to access Jameson memorial as a potential new base. 

-Visit the John Jameson crash site. 

-(something not in game). Figure out more about the lore and story in this game because I have no goddamn clue what’s going on to be honest. Should have done this first, my bad. 

-Honestly now that I’ve just started to build my foundation I hopefully can do a little more."
self,ff2lbxq,t3_er9gxh,1579511531.0,I mean the thought has come across my mind but I try not to think about that. I honestly don’t need more reasons to be awkward in public.
rant,ff2l8r6,t3_er4q38,1579511401.0,Pretty much all of the machines in my area either need me to do it in advance or work when it’s already in the machine. Makes things go a bit faster for me.
EliteDangerous,ff2l1z7,t1_ff2kklb,1579511121.0,"I already unlocked the engineer for the FSD boost and I am starting to unlock the guardian drive boost (just got the blueprints and most  of the materials). 

As for ships I loved my python (planning on rebuying another one) and I personally love the Kraits as well. Might get a Phantom since it’s better for exploration (hard to pick I like them both). I also have a Diamondback Explorer that I also love using (honestly I didn’t expect to like it that much but was pleasantly surprised). 

Well all in all I like the ships that I’ve used so far. Hopefully I can start building up a fleet of my favorite ships. There’s so many this game has to offer. So at least there’s that."
EliteDangerous,ff2knop,t1_ff2j9pj,1579510549.0,"Yeah well. I think I found a use for it at least. Might as well put that ship to good use. Some people have recommended helping rebuild stations or try helping the fuel rats. 

That I might get into. The whole point of that ship was to get it to help others. I may have found something to do thanks to the community itself."
EliteDangerous,ff1p4ps,t1_ff1oma4,1579483054.0,Honestly I’ve been looking into that as well. And I just read that the anaconda is a good choice. Definitely leaning towards that direction.
EliteDangerous,ff1mjgi,t1_ff1ewu8,1579481652.0,Ooh. This sounds interesting. Let me take a bit more of a look. Any chance this works for PS4 as well?
EliteDangerous,ff19w80,t1_ff0ywyp,1579476673.0,"Actually I had originally a reason for getting an anaconda. I just like helping people. So I looked for the best way to make money to get the Anaconda as a rescue ship. I have no earthly clue on how to do that now. 

I can’t think of any other way then going to the burning stations and loading up passengers in need. I know there’s that event right now, so I could do that. 

Honestly I probably should’ve planned a little better."
EliteDangerous,ff0uxoj,t1_ff0uld7,1579472505.0,Fair point. I like exploring too but I need to engineer this a little better for me to get the most out of it.
EliteDangerous,ff0usy2,t1_ff0ue7p,1579472460.0,I mean I love this ship and I quickly made enough money to buy a second one. I just wish I could do something helpful with this.

However a few years back I lost a friend who killed himself in the military. Seeing everyone around him suffering the way they did was kind of a sobering experience. Kind of made me step back I think about things."
DecidingToBeBetter,fel9aqc,t1_fel7foh,1579216867.0,"It’s not that we’re different exactly. My main issue is that I have some family members that decide to intentionally make themselves another obstacle for me to deal with. 

For example I’ve managed to convince a some of my family members to make better life decisions (although they will never admit it). But my father absolutely refuses to do the the because 
1. He HAS to do the opposite as everyone else 
2. Because he doesn’t do it he tries to force everyone else to quit. In his mind if he doesn’t do it, everyone else has to stop. 

And for the rest of my family they have a problem with HOW I diet and exercise. Problem is they don’t provide me with solutions, just complaints. 

That’s the reason for me to distance myself."
DecidingToBeBetter,fekzcsb,t1_fekyacp,1579210753.0,"Well more specifically making an effort to improve is already difficult don’t need additional obstacles. Negativity is something I’ve lived with my whole life. I can deal with that.

This method is a lot easier and consistent then deep core mining (for me) and didn’t require as much skill or engineering as it is with a lot of other builds I’ve seen. Perfect for a beginner like me. 

Trust me this part didn’t require a lot of work. Also I couldn’t exactly tell you what my build was because I quickly sold my aspx after I finished a few rounds with it. Didn’t use it for too long until I got my python."

Waited until they brought the enemy ships health to 20%, then finished off the ship. Made enough to get about 4 million (doesn’t take as long as you’d think) then bought a Cobra MkIII and modded it for road to riches. 

2. After I earned about 10 +mill (because a got bored of road to riches the way I was doing it) I upgraded to a dbx(love that ship) continued road to riches faster (40lyr Jump was useful) did that until I could get enough for a really well stocked aspx (again road to riches bores me) 

3.Then I went painite mining. Used 3rd party tools to show me where to mine and sell made the rest really quickly. I should’ve done this step sooner I would’ve done this in a day instead if I knew sooner.

self,fdr71mt,t3_emrkdz,1578680354.0,Thank you. Someone address this. BOTH sides have been guilty of this and in my opinion both have been obnoxious about this. So yeah I find it silly when the left is blamed on that but I’m also constantly seeing it with a lot of conservative groups doing it too and if you call them out you get the response”oh it’s not the same”  and then they can’t explain how it’s not the same.
ParisTravelGuide,fdqyp2d,t1_fdqspdy,1578676908.0,"Ok for the Paris pass and euro pass. I honestly have no clue anymore. Never got a chance to use it. (The strikes were happening) all I know is the when your at the metro ticket dispenser it does give you an option for multiple days for transport. We tried to do that day one until a rude station worker kicked us out. 

Personally I went to Disney Paris for 1. Had people that were Disneyland fanatics and were going that day 2. Curious to see if there was any difference. 

Good that you can avoid scams, I managed to get tricked by two guys who faked themselves as security guards at the Louve and stole my ticket to resell. Oh and there will be someone selling art near the Notre Dame street and trying to push selling the bigger art pieces I bought one of the smaller ones. Then found an identical looking piece in one of the shops nearby in Paris for 1/4 the price. Live and learn I guess. 

And yes I visited the Louve. Had to go early because Paris will completely filled with people over December. All the tourists that used to want to visit the US and now can’t (due to tighter restrictions) are going to Paris. You might get there at a better time. Maybe go online and by the tickets for everything in advance. And no I didn’t go to the DaVinci exhibit. That costs extra. I didn’t  research anything involving the museums (someone else in my group had that job and overlooked that part). Again only go to this if you happen to like art. The louve is a great option for that (couldn’t go to musee d'orsay because again Paris was full at the time). And the Mona Lisa is really tiny, a lot less then I expected. 

Good for you with your willingness to eat the street food. All of the foods are just amazing. But again tons of little eateries, like legitimate restaurants that are hidden away from the main streets of Paris. Even saw once  a “normal” restaurant  in that section that had an option three course meal for €30 (if my memory serves me well).  So you’ll find anything there on any budget. This is something I heard before but didn’t realize how true that was. 

Oh and since you live in the states fun fact I learned in Paris they have quite a few English only bookstores (no clue why). That was more then in one place then I’ve ever seen before (live in California). 
 
That’s pretty much all I can say so far (unless if you have more specific questions I might have more). This is most of my general knowledge of what it was like in Paris. A lot of the specific parts of planning didn’t go to me (which annoyed me because I’m usually good at planning that stuff). So I couldn’t tell you those sorts of things."
offmychest,fdq0c6c,t3_eml4h2,1578648563.0,"Been in that situation (in a way). Had a friend commit suicide for being bullied in the military also tried to kill myself around that time when I was around that age. So it became a nasty wake up call. 

Sorry you have to go through with that. I hope you’re ok."
ParisTravelGuide,fdq07l1,t3_emlx14,1578648385.0,"Ok so just went to Paris last week so here’s a few things my family did to save money during the trip and possibly some suggestions from our observation at the time and some pitfalls we fell through so you won’t t make the same mistake. Just a few long ramblings. 

If you plan to save money on eating, a lot of the restaurants aren’t awful in price like €12-30 maybe eat  in one of those restaurants once, don’t get drinks (not even water some places it wasn’t complementary). If that’s not in your price Paris has plenty of street venders in different corners of Paris or little eateries that that sell filling food for cheap. There was one place that sold really good gyros with fries for €5. They’re in more of the hidden sections of the city. Bakeries are everywhere and they’re actually pretty affordable, I’d go to those of you like sweets. And food consistently everywhere is France is amazing. And if you know how to cook and want to forgo some costs making food yourself is a good option because the quality of the food in France is amazing as well. Just avoid eating at the attractions or near them. An €10 crepe with Nutella near the Eiffel tower  is just  as delicious as a €4 somewhere else in the city. 

Transportation is a little tricky. Renting a car yourself is tricky. I don’t exactly know what you’d need to do to get the rent the car yourself or how much it would cost (my family and I didn’t try that so we wouldn’t know). If you do consider it an option, be careful the French are, to put it nicely, CRAZY when it comes to driving, so hopefully you’re confident in your driving skills. Also at the moment gat is really expensive, so much so they cut off the metro last week (on strike because of the gas prices) so my family had to uber through the whole trip (which got pricey). If the metro is open buying a euro pass is a cheap option. You can buy a ticket accordingly to the day’s you’ll be there. Affordable with an unlimited amount of passes for the days you’ve placed. Otherwise you’ll have to go through other methods. You can rent electric scooters (like Byrd and lime) that’s one option. UBER isn’t awful unless the city is full of tourists making everything fuller.  Cabs in France aren’t a bad option,  they’re a lot cheaper then I thought they were (especially if the Uber has rush prices). Avoid getting into a cab where they’ll drive you around if you pay them €150 in advance. It’s a scam

If you have plans to go to Disney Paris, if you’ve been to regular Disneyland, avoid it. It’s pretty much the same, unless if you missed the tower of terror when it was up or want to go on the ratatouille ride which only that park has (to my knowledge). The ticket price was €120. 

Like the food suggestion avoid the tourist spots, avoid buying souvenirs as well. The street vendors near there are a lot pricier then the shops and other street venders a little farther away. Much, much cheaper buying to in a small store or a vender father away from the tourist spots.  And I mean avoid everything. There was a guy nearby the Notra Dame, tricked a family  member made him pay €60 for a two person caricature. 

However if your have €15 to spare and love art that’s an entry ticket to the Louve. Just if there are “police guards” shouting at you to return your tickets at the door don’t. It’s a scam for them to resell your tickets. You can go back inside three times a with the ticket itself. 

That’s I’ll I can think of on the top of my heels. Help it helps."

ParisTravelGuide,fdp50h0,t3_emflo5,1578620139.0,"Just got back from Paris last week. Just a bit off the top of my head. 

Be wary of the people near the landmarks. Nearly got my camera stolen off my neck near the Eiffel Tower and had two guys fake themselves as security guards near the end of the louve yelling at everyone to give them their tickets just to resell them. (Which wasn’t so bad. It’s like $15 so no real loss on my end).

Check if the strikes in the metro are over, it happened the entire time I was there. Had to spend ~€100 every time I had to go to a location by Uber (didn’t help that France was completely filled with tourists so you may be ok). Take the metro  if that’s an option because trust me you don’t want to drive there.  Not unless if you are very confident in your driving abilities. The French are very bold in driving. Besides the euro pass isn’t that expensive from what I’ve heard (Not that I got a chance to use it). 

Don’t worry so much about going to the big restaurants that charge you €12-30 per meal. There are a lot of great tiny eateries that give you something good to and filling for €5. 

DONT buy anything from the landmarks especially if you plan to some some for family members. The €12 mini Eiffel Tower you can buy in the Eiffel Tower are nearly identical to the ones you can buy at just around every corner at the street venders or gift shops in pretty much any direction of Paris. You can get 6 of those mini Eiffel towers for €5. 

Same goes with buying food or pastries from the cafes in the landmarks. There’s no shortage of bakeries in France. It won’t take you longer then 5 minutes to find a handful. 

Another thing you’ll find a lot of is pharmacies (for some reason). And they’re full of incredibly useful products along with any medication you might need. 

Pretty much anywhere you go the food is consistently delicious. Same goes with trying to make food yourself. The quality of the ingredients you can buy in France is just amazing. Hell the milk itself tastes like cream. 

If you plan to go to Disneyland Paris it’s pretty much the same as Disneyland in the US  just smaller. Everything is in English (with French repeated afterwards). A good experience if you missed your chance to go on the Tower of Terror or want to go to the ratatouille ride only in that park (to my knowledge). 

The people of France are also in my opinion very helpful, kind and charming. If you know a little French it helps. Most do speak a bit of English but not everyone."
