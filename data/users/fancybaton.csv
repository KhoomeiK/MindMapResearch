Also, Dr. Phil has over 2,000 episodes. How many families that include mothers and daughters do you think made it onto the air?

I would never break confidentiality, and I certainly haven't done so here. Definitely a valid concern tho--this is something I consider everytime I post work-related anecdotes."
aww,ferz2rz,t1_fepvdmv,1579359842.0,Can minors sign away their right to take civil action? Seems like there's an argument to be made that children shouldn't be bound the same way as adults..

aww,fep4z8d,t1_feoyj29,1579312245.0,"I'm a psych NP. Once treated one of Dr. Phil's former ""guests."" This young girl was portrayed as a hellion, and mom was the victim in the TV narrative.

In reality, mom was emotionally and physically abusive. I ended up treating the daughter when mom dropped her off at the hospital and then went on vacation. Kid ended up in CPS custody cause mom wouldn't pick up her up at discharge.

For the rest of her life, YouTube videos of that TV episode will likely be among the top results when her name is googled. All because mom wanted to make a quick buck pimping out her daughter to Dr. Phil.

Dr. Phil ought to be in jail. Families don't heal during 30-minute TV segments, especially since that environment encourages performance and sensationalism.

How fantastic would it be if all the minors exploited by Dr. Phil got together for a class action lawsuit? The man is without a moral compass--I can't believe he's syndicated through 2023. Ugh."
