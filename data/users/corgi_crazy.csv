Paranormal,ffk4u3p,t3_etrid9,1580015896.0,"Once I saw some kind of a light ball in the woods.
It was shaped like an egg and in the distance that I saw it I think it was so big like 2 or 3 big watermelons.
But I saw some little something in the inside. No human forms,  I just don't know.
I looked at it for several seconds and it ""jumped"" into the bushes.
This is the only post I read here with something similar. I also should like to know more."
