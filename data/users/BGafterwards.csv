BattlefieldV,ff7gl6g,t1_ff7f18z,1579649066.0,"Honestly the state of the game and state of community would be just as poor without CMs, I personally think they should shut up and leave us on ignore until they have something worth while to say instead of trying to meme with us to diffuse tensions. Either tell us to fuck off outright so we can leave this game and subreddit in the dirt where it belongs, or tell us they are actually implementing changes and when to expect them.

No one cares about your Harley or your brisket during these trying times. But I'm just an asshole so maybe I'm wrong."
