First of all, him saying she’s gay sounds like a cop out. Are you sure she isn’t bi? How serious is her relationship with that girl... you’re not wrong for being upset that he lied about going out with her. And you had some drinks so you overreacted... big deal. 

I think you’re being a bit hard on yourself. I’d definitely be jealous if I were in your position. He saw you were uncomfortable with their relationship and his response to that was to sneak out to an art exhibit with her... 

And THEN throw in your face that she’s gay AFTER you reacted to this just to make you feel stupid... How the hell were you supposed to know? Why didn’t he tell you that before suggesting counseling?

You probably won’t find someone who you always feel head over heels for, and you need to keep that in mind when making this decision.

I know you aren’t married but maybe there’s a reason you’re so scared that you don’t feel those feelings anymore. Maybe you desperately want to be in love with him... you may regret it if you leave. 

I heard something a while ago that kind of stuck with me... love is not a feeling, it’s an action. So if you TREAT someone like you’re in love with them, you will start to feel lovingly towards them. You say he does nice things for you all the time. When’s the last time you surprised him with something nice?

Yes she is being ridiculous (as long as it’s not one of those online games where there’s a real girl on the other end). BUT if you give more of your attention to the video game, that could be what’s causing her jealousy. She may have been feeling neglected before she knew about the girlfriend, and when she found out you have a sort of fantasy going on, she started feeling as though you’re not as interested in her anymore. 

This is like when girls get upset about porn. It’s innocent enough, sure... To most people it isn’t an issue, but if it starts to interfere with your relationship and you start neglecting your partner then yes, it’s a problem.

Is having a girlfriend on your games really that important to you? If so, why?

This is actually a technique used to help with OCD (or any anxiety disorder). Suppose your fears are true. Now what? Sit with the idea for a second. You are gay. What would that mean? Absolute worst scenario... 

What you’re doing is accepting the thought. When you stop fighting it, it loses power. You’re not afraid of being gay so it can’t taunt you. 

Everyone has intrusive thoughts. EVERYONE can relate to that. But in OCD we don’t just have a thought and let it pass. We fixate on it. It must have meaning. But we’re giving it meaning, and we can take it away. 

By accepting it and moving on, you’re doing just that. “I’m a sexual creature who sometimes has sexual thoughts of the same sex and that’s ok. It doesn’t mean anything”

therapy,fdkknhh,t1_fdkenq0,1578505568.0,"I want you to know that I don’t intend to offend you in any way or tell you who you are or how you feel. 

But I don’t think you are asexual. It seems you are identifying with that out of fear. Asexual typically means you are born with no sexual desire. In your situation it seems you may have desire, but you are afraid of the consequences that may bring. Which is a legitimate fear. 

I used to be terrified of sex as well. I was afraid of being betrayed, afraid of stds and afraid of childbirth. When I was young my mom was watching a show on teen pregnancy. The girl was giving birth and she was screaming and crying and my mom used that opportunity as a teaching lesson. She constantly told me how bad childbirth hurt. I swore I would never give birth. I wanted kids but I always said I’d adopt. I didn’t want to have sex because it was too risky.

I dated a woman for three years in high school and I think a huge part of that was because she was safe. I couldn’t get pregnant. I couldn’t get stds (that I was aware of, turns out that is false but luckily I never caught anything) and the best part was, I had very little desire to have sex. But I was suppressing myself. And I think you might be too. 

In my case I was sick of feeling that way. I ended up meeting a man who was also a virgin, and I was comfortable with him (for the most part). And we did have sex. And it was fun and I didn’t get a disease. (Though I worried about it often). I was just like you. I was so neurotic and worried and obsessively got tested and took pregnancy tests. But I was fine, aside from all the worrying.

I even got pregnant (on purpose) and had my own child and I didn’t die. And all of that was such a huge accomplishment for me, and I was so proud for allowing myself to experiencing it. 

I am not with my sons father anymore. He did betray me, and that hurt. A lot. But you know what? I’m ok. I’m stronger because of it. I’m not letting that keep me from happiness. I’m dating a new man who is very cautious about pregnancy and protects himself and I feel safe with him. Maybe in the future I’ll have another kid (because it does hurt but it’s so worth it). And there might be risks but that’s ok because in the end everything works out. 

I don’t want you to allow fear to keep you from living your life. If you have no desire to have sex after your experience because it’s just not something you’re in to then that is perfectly fine and I support that. But if you are suppressing yourself because you fear the worst, and I think you’ll agree, that is no way to live. You could be missing out on something amazing when in reality your fear is much greater than the risk."

By saying smoking isn’t the problem you’re suggesting that quitting isn’t really the solution. And it might not be but it is definitely a start."

therapy,fdk8ape,t1_fdk5iyr,1578498354.0,That’s like telling an alcoholic that drinking isn’t the problem.
therapy,fdk4zio,t1_fdk0ir3,1578496179.0,Well you might if it’s coming from someone you have feelings for. They continue to do that stuff because it works. When we’re in ‘love’ we tend to ignore that wise inner voice telling us something is off
therapy,fdk1e7a,t3_elpo2h,1578493650.0,Well you obviously need to stop smoking. Looks like you’re aware of what your issue is. You aren’t in denial. You know where it went wrong. So quit and see where you life goes from there
therapy,fdjxv43,t1_fdjbqif,1578490920.0,Careful. When people are scamming they disappear for a while before saying they’re in danger and need money to escape it.
therapy,fdj9dtp,t1_fdj7n6k,1578462262.0,"Can I ask why you are so disgusted by what you did? I understand you wanted to have control, and feeling like you lost that really sucks, I get that. I imagine people feel the same when they find themselves in a situation that makes them unfaithful to someone they care about. 

But it seems like there’s a deeper reason that you’re so distraught over it"
therapy,fdj6tvl,t1_fdj06js,1578460081.0,"That’s ok. I think you should go see him. Or at the very least text him back. 

Maybe you didn’t care to stop it in the moment because you feel something for him that you haven’t before. Could be something worth exploring, unless you’re against that idea. 

I’m assuming he doesn’t know how you felt about what happened. Is he aware that you are abstinent?"
