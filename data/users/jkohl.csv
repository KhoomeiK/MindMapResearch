AskReddit,ffiipwh,t1_ffihipp,1579974823.0,Demo Ranch is a great YouTuber tbh. He's kinda like mythbusters but just for guns.
AskReddit,ffhtcen,t3_etpfj1,1579952872.0,How many people I've unknowingly helped keep alive and how many more I could have kept alive if I could have done anything about it. I had a really rough time with depression through a lot of my earlier life and because of that I try to be kind to and help everyone I possibly can. I just wanna know if I made a difference to someone.
EscapefromTarkov,fffhm7e,t1_fff5331,1579884146.0,"That would be the only way I'd think it would work. Like you would have to have a helmet on and a camera attached to it and then, if it's insured and comes back to you, you can watch the replay. You could also take other people's cameras or memory cards from the cameras and replay them if you wanted. I think that would be a cool feature to add, but also it's kind of unnecessary to implement."

EscapefromTarkov,ffdefrv,t3_esti4i,1579819148.0,"Rather than going out and dying you should sell some crap. I was doing the same thing until I realized I could simply sell the crap, make money, and then buy slightly better crap. I find myself to be a hoarder of gear, but it's really not all that necessary past the point when you get comfortable with the mechanics, so you're better off selling it and buying better gear or bullets you wouldn't normally use to last longer in a fight."

EscapefromTarkov,ff9hpem,t3_esd8ja,1579713252.0,That happened to me well after I bought the game. I had no idea minefields were a thing. It took my left leg and arm then a scav took my face shortly after.

For example, I'm in the US and have all the US servers checked. I find it seriously helped cut down on my que times. Went from an average of 15 minute ques to about 7."
EscapefromTarkov,fesc2bl,t1_fepsjqg,1579363718.0,"I'm still fairly new to learning Russian, but what you said is pretty much what I got as well. Directly translated it's something like ""you do not really fuck?"" But Russian doesn't exactly translate directly, there's implied words, so a more accurate translation would be like ""you've really got nothing else to fucking do?"" Or something along those lines, like you said."
