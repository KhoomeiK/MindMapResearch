exjw,fedl88u,t1_feddmwv,1579014292.0,"Funny, as soon as you said ""He seemed almost too reasonable under the circumstances"" my very first thought was ""is he an elder?"" Because in my experience, this is how elders tend to react to these sorts of conversations: do not get angry or emotional, and probe the reasons for the change of heart. They try to figure out exactly where you stand and then bring it up to the elder body immediately.

Obviously I don't know your dad or that elder body, but based on my experience, I would expect to hear from another elder in the next couple of days, saying that he and one other elder (not your dad) need to have a discussion with you urgently. One of the reasons there will be two of them is so that if you say anything that constitutes apostasy, there will be two witnesses, who can and will be used against you should this become a judicial matter. My advice is to decline this meeting. They will not respect your refusal, as in their view you don't have the option to decline, and will tell you that you *have to* meet with them, but they don't have any way of enforcing this or punishing you for refusing. They will try to ambush you to have this meeting with you whether you want to or not, and again, my advice if you want to avoid being disfellowshipped, is to say nothing. ""It's personal"", ""I don't wish to discuss it"", ""am I being detained"", ""you are trespassing"", etc. You are under no obligation to explain anything, and your participation in their ""spiritual help"" is voluntary. After maybe a couple of attempts they'll be out of options and lose interest in bothering you.

Maybe none of this will happen, I'm just saying be prepared is all."

exjw,fdqk7ox,t3_emnihw,1578668671.0,"""He was dead and now is alive again"" is an obvious allusion to the parable of the prodigal son, and a wildly inappropriate one. In the parable, the prodigal son dishonors his family and comes crawling back after having wasted everything his father gave him. When he comes back in disgrace, his father welcomes him with great fanfare, and when his older brother wants to turn him away and punish him, the father says these words - He was dead and now is alive again.

The prodigal son wasn't sent away for doing something wrong, he was never denied contact with his family and friends, and his father didn't need anyone's permission to take him back. The only thing in the story that comes close to disfellowshipping is the older brother's attitude, seemingly wanting to deny his brother a relationship with his family because he's not been punished enough, because he hasn't earned it.

You don't get to paint yourself into the role of the merciful father just because you were finally given permission to stop punishing him, and you sure as fuck don't get to act like he hurt you and left you and you welcomed him with open arms when he decided to reach out to you. Figure it out."

What do you do when you're challenged to disprove something which, like Bertrand Russell's illustration of the teapot orbiting the sun somewhere between the earth and mars, is unfalsifiable by design?

In my opinion, what you need is a broader perspective. You've weighed the evidence and concluded that Jehovah's Witnesses are not God's earthly organization, but their beliefs still have power over your life and occupy your mind. I suggest you start learning about other religions similar to Jehovah's Witnesses: the mormon/LDS church, Christadelphians, the Two by Twos (they literally call their religion ""The Truth""), and see that in no way are Jehovah's Witnesses even special or worth so much of your time."
