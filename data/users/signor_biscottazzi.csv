janeausten,ff7fb1h,t3_err52o,1579648224.0,"So, there's this man, mr Henry Dashwood. He was married with a woman (Wife 1) and they had a son together. After some time she died, and he remarried with Wife 2. Now he has three daughters from his new wife.

So: Wife 2 is son's stepmom and the girls are his stepsisters.

Wife 1 was pretty rich and when she died she left all her money to her son but to use it he had to wait until he was a legal adult.

>By his own marriage, likewise, which happened soon afterwards, he added to his wealth.

As soon as he is of age, the son marries a rich woman (Fanny). Now he has both the money inherited by his mother and the money of Fanny.

The son is very rich. His father (mr Henry Dashwood) instead is pretty poor because all the money of Wife 1 belongs to Son, and his new wife (Wife 2) is poor. He is worried for his daughters' future. 

It is very important to mr Henry Dashwood that when his old Uncle (the owner of the mansion where he and his family lives) dies, gives the mansion to him, so he can provide to his daughters.

Son don't really care much about the mansion because he's already rich, but his half sisters (Wife 2's daughters) are very poor, and they need the mansion.

Hope this was useful, let us know if you need more help!

Yeah, you're right, I didn't quote it exactly. My purpose was to make a funny comment to show how (to me) it looked improbable that the original was written by a woman. I did keep ""her"" themes, so I don't think I was much off.

>Sexy underwear and super short shorts like this is not something I would normally wear, but I love seeing drawings of other men wearing them.

I had to add it to make clear I was talking about men's clothes because (unlike skirts and lingerie) shorts and underwear are gender neutral. Besides, I didn't add anything that wasn't already in the original text: the writer is a woman who enjoys skimpy outfits on female characters. I just had her male counterpart state that explicitly.

I think Sansa is great. She is a brave little girl that tries her best to survive, while still  being very obviously a child. She's still a bit naive (former knight Dontos Hollard is so suspicious, I don't think he's trying to help her) but she's also smart and good with her words. She has to be, poor thing, her only defense is her courtesy. I really hope everything will turn out well for her in the end.
She's definitely one of my favourite characters.

In my opinion Sansa is so much more believable than Arya. Arya is generally depicted as a thirty something year old soldier, fearless and experienced in war strategy, that once in a while suddenly remember she's supposed to be eight. She can talk for hours about killing people and skin them with no problem, and then she'll say something like: ""My clothes are dirty! I'm afraid that now mom won't like me anymore"".

Don't tilt your head back when you have a nosebleed! That is the wrongest thing ever:

What happen when you have a runny nose and you sniffle? That's right, the mucus goes down your throat. This happen with blood too. In the worst case, you're choking on your own blood, best case, even if you're not choking you're still ingurgitating a big amount of blood. That can't be good for your health.

badwomensanatomy,fdwraeb,t1_fdvz55p,1578761567.0,"In my opinion childbirth is worse, because i think it lasts longer. In average you have seven/eight hours of labour (in this period of time the *cervix stretches itself until it reach ten centimetres of diameter) then another three - two hours for the effective birth of the baby. This means a total of ten hours of excruciating pain.

Yeah, it's true that in some cases the birth part can lasts less than an hour, but you still have at least three-two hours of labour.

It's also true that sometimes childbirth can last more than a day. 

Though luckily I never gave birth nor I posses a penis. Men, on average, how much time lasts the pain from getting kicked in the balls?
