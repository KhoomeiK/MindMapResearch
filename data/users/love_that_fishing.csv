Futurology,ffph4ur,t1_ffoxhni,1580094917.0,"Has nothing to do with how good VR gets IMHO. There is a certain amount of satisfaction one gets in accomplishing things. I'm going to just work 4 days a week this year as I've turned 60 and want to start to slow down a bit. And I'm thankful to have a bit more free time.  But I'd really miss the people I work with, the feeling of accomplishment of putting new programs out. I may work 3 days a week for many more years. Even if I'm financially independent, I'll do something. We're hard wired to work. Most folks that have unlimited funds don't find happiness. Play is great for awhile but eventually most people find a need to accomplish something. It's just built into our DNA. We've been doing it since humanity was born."

Showerthoughts,ffjfq0b,t1_ffijhh3,1579997289.0,"Had 4 kids thus 4 teenagers. Many teenagers pretty much assume their parents are clueless. Then when they hit about 25 they come back and say... Dad, I now realize you knew what you were talking about. Just took 10 years to figure that out. Now that's not 100% clearly but I certainly saw that play out with my kids more than once. Do parents have it all figured out, course not. But they do often have more life experiences than a 14 year old. But only way a 14 year old can learn this is to live those life experiences. Where parents really f up is when they try too hard to protect their kids from learning on their own. Also faking it when you don't know. If you don't know how to solve an issue it's fine to tell a kid you don't and then they get to see how you overcome whatever it is."

I mean she got it every time and she never caught on until I brought it up when she was like 20. It was self serving because you can only play so many games of Candy Land and not lose your marbles, so I was shortening the game when I got tired of playing. So I wasn't being the best dad at the moment but still.... she did like getting the Queen card."

Also they should have a list of what accounts they have. I have a safety deposit box and right on top is a list of things for my wife or kids to do upon my death and what accounts I havent and approximately how much is there.
AskReddit,ffaqom5,t1_ff940vr,1579742240.0,Thats insulting. Im older (60) and I wasnt privileged.  Went to a state school and paid my way. Worked in the medical field and then when computers really hit in the 80s got a masters in computer sci which again I paid for working nights and school during the day. Just didnt sleep much. Had a great career and still working in IT. Costs have gone up a lot compared to inflation so what I did would be much harder now but dont assume everyone my age had some cushy experience. I averaged 70 hrs a week between school and work and worked my ass off writing code for a long time. First year I was married still finishing my masters. Saw my wife Wed evening and Sunday. Rest of the week I was pegged. Tough way to start a marriage but you can do anything when you know there is an end to it.

I suffer from a rare neurological condition probably brought on by cancer treatment but no one will ever really know. Im not in pain 24x7 but flares cause significant pain most days. My point is I can focus on what sucks in my life and what doesnt. Its my choice and one of the few things that actually is. And Im not stupid. I know were comparing apples and oranges. And rich people should share and they damn sure should pay their taxes. But my point is we can cause ourselves considerable unhappiness by focusing on whats fucked  up instead of whats good in our lives. We should  always fight against injustice. Of all days this is a day to remember that. But Im cautioning you guys to also remember what you do have. I just turned 60 and my life will be over before I know it. And Im not wasting much of the time I have remaining being pissed I cant physically do so many of the activities I loved. Ill focus on the goodness I do have in life. When my dad got cancer and died I noticed something. Not once did he complain. I think he felt everyday he got after the war was a gift. Just another take on life. Im not saying youre wrong. You have every right to fight for justice and should. Just dont lose site of happiness along the way. All the beat to you and yours.

Never had to kill a man just because his leader was a Nazi dick. Things are tough right now. Housing prices are nuts. But Id still take my life over my parents or grand parents any day. Early boomers in many ways got it pretty good with actual pensions, etc... but they also had it pretty damn tough before they were 20. Every generation has its challenges.

worldnews,ff3zuan,t1_ff3m5ct,1579552465.0,Not that simple. Our CEO essentially defined  the SaaS model to cloud computing. Its his stock thats made him a billionaire. People that work here are all extremely well paid for their job class. The extended jobs and economy is over a trillion dollars and a million jobs. These are all jobs people have around the world they pay good salaries and good benefits.  We are required to use our company time to volunteer. We give away our resources as a company and of course he gives his own money. So much good has come from him starting this company. Did he strive to be a billionaire? No he strove to redefine cloud computing. The byproduct has been over a million well paying jobs. Its just not as simple as you want to make it. I guess we can agree to disagree but this is not the equivalent to a slave master when we have over a thousand resumes for every open position. I took a 2 level demotion to come here because I wanted to work for a company that made a difference. It was my choice not that I am a slave. Really poor choice of words imho.
worldnews,ff37jpz,t1_ff2rr6l,1579535559.0,"Did you read what I wrote. I said most rich dont give as they should. Just you have to be careful with generalizations because some do many good things. I agree its not the norm and it should be. I give away about 12% of my pre tax income yet I drive a 15 and 13 year old high mileage cars. I could buy a new car every other year with that money but  my car works and others need it more. And as I said Im not rich but most of us can give more than we do. We just choose our own comfort over others. This isnt just a rich problem its a people problem. And just giving money away doesnt solve the issue. Skills training, child help, elder help, and many other factors. Money helps but only if invested properly."

But at least he's doing good with the money he made. He's not just sitting on all of it like an ass. My company has a 1-1-1 model where we give away 1% or our income, 1% of our employees time, and 1% of our company resources to 503C's. It's a great model that is spreading through silicon valley. In 2018 our CEO gave away 30M of his own money to local causes for homelessness in addition to what the company gives which is quite a bit more. Not all rich people are inherently bad although I'd agree most are. But there are some good ones using their wealth for good. I'm upper middle class but still drive a 15 year old car. Live in a modest house. I could spend a lot more on stupid stuff that doesn't matter, or I can free more money up for giving that has much greater rewards.  I've chosen the ladder.

* It's easier than ever to compare and want what others have. 100 years ago your neighbor might be 5 miles away or the dudes you worked with all kind of did the same thing and lived the same way. This breeds unhappiness when you are bombarded with advertising that says what you have isn't enough. 
* The ever increasing demands to be better. Better than your parents, better than your peers. Not everyone can be above average but somehow we think this ins't true for us
* Just sheer lack of time outdoors
* Decrease in communication. People don't know their neighbors, etc... many have very few real friends. 
* Work outside allows you to think. Getting your hands in the dirt is somehow good for the mental health. Not sure I understand it, but has been very true for me. 
* Total bombardment of our senses as someone else said. Constant interruptions because of tech leads our brains never able to enter serious contemplation on pretty much anything. For me, I have to get out on my boat on the water with no distractions on a regular basis. Best thing I can do for my mental health."

They just use Aetna or whoever to administer the plan. Now what would be wrong is to deny care because its too expensive.

Nobody really had time to worry about whose job some perceived task was. Once you get above 2 you cant play man to man defense anymore. Gotta play zone so if youre giving one kid a bath better make it 2. Bed time stories one takes the older 2 other takes the younger 2,etc.... I never minded diapers. I mean how long does it really take? 1-2 minutes max. We did have some things we were both better at or at least minded less. I didnt mind cleaning so theyd all go to the park and Id clean the whole house. But I hated the picking up so the wife would help the kids get the toys picked up so daddy could clean.  But that was more preference as anything. She stayed home with the kids until they were all in school but to me that didnt give me a free pass to be a lazy butt when I got home from work. I knew how hard she worked being a stay at home mom. My oldest is a father now and hes awesome. My own father probably never changed a diaper but he was the dad that would play with the entire neighborhood. After I was grown and my dad was retired little kids would come to the door and ask my mom  if my 60 year old dad could come out and play. We all laughed about it but hed get out in the front yard and throw footballs to all these kids. He had his faults but he always made family his priority and I guess weve just passed that down from generation to generation. My grandfather was an ass and I think dad wanted to make sure he didnt make the same mistakes his dad did. Dad could have gone to work for his dad and wed have been rich but instead he had a pretty simple job away from all that we never had much money but had a better life. Dads been gone for a decade now and its still tough. He may not have changed my diaper but he always put family first and its been passed down 2 generations now."

You have to put this in context to to Exodus 3:14 where God said to Moses  I am who I am. And he said, Say this to the people of Israel: I am has sent me to you.  The people clearly understood this reference and why they picked up stones to stone him for blasphemy. There are many I am references where he says ""I am the bread of life"", ""I am the light of the world"", ""I am the resurrection and the life"", ""I am the way, the truth, and the life"". There are many other references, this is just one example. I mean, you can say the whole thing is just a fairly tale. Or it was embellished later, etc...  But unless it was embellished later which is impossible to prove at this point he clearly did equate equality with God. John 10:30 is another good reference ""I and the Father are one. You have to really go out of your way and not take these at face value to come to a different conclusion. I was an atheist for much of my formative years. It wasn't until I was a biology major in college and post grad study that it just took more faith to believe that the complexities of life happened without intelligent design. As a very logical thinker, I just couldn't come to grips that everything I studied happened without intelligence behind it. Why I'd disagree with Jefferson. Once you open the door to an intelligent creator that transcends time and space then miracles are certainly possible. But that's me. Everyone has to come to their own conclusion.

I suffer from a rare neurological condition probably brought on by cancer treatment but no one will ever really know. I’m not in pain 24x7 but flares cause significant pain most days. My point is I can focus on what sucks in my life and what doesn’t. It’s my choice and one of the few things that actually is. And I’m not stupid. I know we’re comparing apples and oranges. And rich people should share and they damn sure should pay their taxes. But my point is we can cause ourselves considerable unhappiness by focusing on what’s fucked  up instead of what’s good in our lives. We should  always fight against injustice. Of all days this is a day to remember that. But I’m cautioning you guys to also remember what you do have. I just turned 60 and my life will be over before I know it. And I’m not wasting much of the time I have remaining being pissed I can’t physically do so many of the activities I loved. I’ll focus on the goodness I do have in life. When my dad got cancer and died I noticed something. Not once did he complain. I think he felt everyday he got after the war was a gift. Just another take on life. I’m not saying you’re wrong.

No he strove to redefine cloud computing. The byproduct has been over a million well paying jobs. It’s just not as simple as you want to make it.

* The ever increasing demands to be better. Better than your parents, better than your peers. Not everyone can be above average but somehow we think this ins't true for us
* Just sheer lack of time outdoors
* Decrease in communication. People don't know their neighbors, etc... many have very few real friends. 
* Work outside allows you to think. Getting your hands in the dirt is somehow good for the mental health. Not sure I understand it, but has been very true for me.

In the 90s I don’t remember anyone doing paternity leave. Least there is some progress. California based companies tend to be the best.
todayilearned,fd3eh26,t1_fd2n71x,1578157557.0,"Seems so weird to me. We have 4 kids all in their 20s and it took both the wife and I all hands on deck to keep the ship afloat. Nobody really had time to worry about whose “job” some perceived task was. Once you get above 2 you can’t play man to man defense anymore. Gotta play zone so if you’re giving one kid a bath better make it 2. Bed time stories one takes the older 2 other takes the younger 2,etc.... I never minded diapers. I mean how long does it really take? 1-2 minutes max. We did have some things we were both better at or at least minded less. I didn’t mind cleaning so they’d all go to the park and I’d clean the whole house. But I hated the picking up so the wife would help the kids get the toys picked up so daddy could clean.  But that was more preference as anything. She stayed home with the kids until they were all in school but to me that didn’t give me a free pass to be a lazy butt when I got home from work. I knew how hard she worked being a stay at home mom. My oldest is a father now and he’s awesome. My own father probably never changed a diaper but he was the dad that would play with the entire neighborhood. After I was grown and my dad was retired little kids would come to the door and ask my mom  if my 60 year old dad could come out and play. We all laughed about it but he’d get out in the front yard and throw footballs to all these kids. He had his faults but he always made family his priority and I guess we’ve just passed that down from generation to generation. My grandfather was an ass and I think dad wanted to make sure he didn’t make the same mistakes his dad did. Dad could have gone to work for his dad and we’d have been rich but instead he had a pretty simple job away from all that we never had much money but had a better life. Dads been gone for a decade now and it’s still tough. He may not have changed my diaper but he always put family first and it’s been passed down 2 generations now."

AskReddit,fcmkw6i,t1_fcm6gon,1577779524.0,"At 60, morning wood rarely happens. Doesn't mean you aren't still having sex, just that you don't wake up in a ""I gotta have it"" mentality. I would say at this age sex is better. No fear of pregnancy, kids are out of the house. Just more relaxed in general. In a long term relationship you know exactly what your partner wants."
todayilearned,fckaay8,t1_fcjhy10,1577720749.0,"The reference I gave you was John 8:58  Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, aI am.” You have to put this in context to to Exodus 3:14 where God said to Moses  “I am who I am.” And he said, “Say this to the people of Israel: ‘I am has sent me to you.’ ” The people clearly understood this reference and why they picked up stones to stone him for blasphemy. There are many I am references where he says ""I am the bread of life"", ""I am the light of the world"", ""I am the resurrection and the life"", ""I am the way, the truth, and the life"". There are many other references, this is just one example. I mean, you can say the whole thing is just a fairly tale. Or it was embellished later, etc...  But unless it was embellished later which is impossible to prove at this point he clearly did equate equality with God. John 10:30 is another good reference ""I and the Father are one.” You have to really go out of your way and not take these at face value to come to a different conclusion. I was an atheist for much of my formative years. It wasn't until I was a biology major in college and post grad study that it just took more faith to believe that the complexities of life happened without intelligent design. As a very logical thinker, I just couldn't come to grips that everything I studied happened without intelligence behind it. Why I'd disagree with Jefferson. Once you open the door to an intelligent creator that transcends time and space then miracles are certainly possible. But that's me. Everyone has to come to their own conclusion. Didn't mean to start a long conversation on Reddit. Not really the place for it. If I've offended I apologize."

When he said ""before there was, I am"" he was clearly claiming deity. That's why the Jews around him picked up stones to stone him for blasphemy. They knew what he was saying. It's a pretty big reach to think he would have been coming from a Buddhist perspective when he was raised in a Jewish culture. But I do agree I don't want my inbox blown up either so bowing out. Have a good day."
todayilearned,fcj0enu,t1_fciugia,1577674173.0,Except Jesus claimed to be fully God. So can he be this wonderful moral teacher if the hocus pocus is taken out? Wouldn't he just be a liar at that point? Or deceived at the least?

UpliftingNews,fc3nypt,t1_fc3a2t2,1577394275.0,"There are relative +/- to most generations. My folks lived through the great depression and on my dads 18th birthday he was drafted to go serve in the south pacific during WWII. He was 5'10"" 125lbs and was still a kid fighting a mans war. My generation was one of the 1st to never have to fight a war. Still wars, but I missed the Vietnam draft by a few years. So nobodies ever shot bullets at me at least. To me climate change and debt are the 2 huge issues of our time. Sure there are others, but these 2 will define future generations. Boomers which I am one have completely dropped the ball on both of these. What's worse is most of them just don't care. I feel like I'm one voice crying in the wilderness and the people my age either don't get it or do and don't care. So I don't blame younger generations for being pissed. Debt is completely out of control and unsustainable and it's going to bite us all in the ass. But I do look at my kids and they may not be more successful than I have been, but they had an easier rode to get there. I paid for most of my college and worked multiple jobs to make it happen. They got most of their's funded by me. Now I know that's the exception, but at least for my own, I've put each of them on a path to be successful both in terms of maturity and financially. Best I can do. I did make them all work once they were 16. Wanted each kid to have some skin in the game and learn the value of work."
AskReddit,fc35n6p,t1_fc2qf5n,1577382038.0,Did a 5 day lidocaine infusion but it didn’t help beyond what I get with oral lidocaine. Ketamine acts as a vasodilator which is not good for my condition.

What you said was persecution had nothing to do with the growth of the early church which is not factual. It certainly did. Constantine extended that growth but not the only factor."

My work calls will start pretty early and I can just hop from the shower to working. She does all these little things to make my life easier and I so appreciate it. I work lots of hours, travel almost every week and struggle through chronic pain so her making my life easier is such a blessing. She knows I have to fight through a lot of pain day to day just to put food on the table and does everything she can to make it easier. She'd work and let me stay home, but I can make 5x what she can so it just doesn't make sense. What a marriage needs is 2 people committed to the others happiness. If not, there is always going to be resentment. Love is an action verb and that means getting your ass off the couch."
