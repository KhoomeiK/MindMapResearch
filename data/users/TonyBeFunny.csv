videos,fee43es,t1_fedtw9x,1579025982.0,"You don't know how the comedy scene works. It's a small group of artist and word of mouth is still a really good way to get jobs. One host see's you do good he will tell his buddy that runs a showcase at ""ChuckleFucks"" to give you a 5 minute guest spot for a free drink and some fucking cheese fries. Eventually though if you are good enough that cheese fries turns into a hotel room and a couple hundred bucks if you drive to bum fuck Egypt all for the hope to just make some folks laugh.

Some comedians however.... Are sociopathic monsters that do bad things and will do whatever they want as long as they are on that path to open for one of Joe Rogans lesser friends. When you mix people like that with people that are just struggling artist, bad things tend to happen and people are taken advantage of. I heard one of these guys getting some free shit from a fan and then say when they walked away ""That's the thing I love about pushovers. You can get whatever you want from them.""

Thing about comedians is they are usually so broken down from life shitting on them that when it happens from another comedian they don't forget about that shit. This story has and probably will get around to the point that most big name clubs won't want fuck-all to do with him and he will be maybe able to score a casino gig or headlining some shitty small town open mic... If the local comedians don't absolutely meltdown for having to perform with a self-admitted rapist and freak out on the venue via social media that is.

Music,fe9lfcl,t1_fe92i4f,1578939090.0,When I saw them someone threw a disposable camera (shows you how long ago this was) on stage and Jimmy opened up his pants and took a down the shorts dick pic and threw the camera back at the audience member. Crowd went insane.
