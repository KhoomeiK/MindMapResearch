tarot,ffbmuil,t3_espenq,1579773248.0,Death is moreso change than anything else. Death is a pretty good card if you're single.
tarot,ffblw34,t3_esqbpu,1579771774.0,What was the question and spread?
PhilosophyMemes,felykga,t1_felrj45,1579234246.0,Yes.
PhilosophyMemes,felpftv,t1_feloo54,1579227734.0,It can exist just as much as subjective morality can.
PhilosophyMemes,felodj7,t1_felktek,1579227004.0,"I think that second to last line is the assumption that I take great issue with. I don't believe anything is real, so nothing can be more real than something else."
PhilosophyMemes,felj1md,t1_felhb82,1579223358.0,"Math is so not subjective? Like I can feel that 2 and 2 add up to 6 but that's still not gonna happen. And English as a literary art is subjective, but there have been multiple objective codes of English grammar.

Where/how morality is applicable is a different topic."
PhilosophyMemes,feldkbt,t1_fejm3fe,1579219662.0,"You noted that morality exists as a concept, and seemed to imply that this makes it subjective. Plenty of concepts, like math or English grammar, are often objective. Morality being a concept is a far step from morality being subjective."
PhilosophyMemes,fejiufm,t1_fej40p3,1579176140.0,"Concepts can be objective. Physics, for instance."
PhilosophyMemes,fe1vgcn,t1_fe17a63,1578831324.0,Freedom from the Will wouldn't be removed by marriage nor increased by being single. I don't see the connection between the two.
PhilosophyMemes,fe16tx2,t1_fe15qva,1578823156.0,He thinks freedom is incompatible with happiness
Existentialism,fe09t61,t1_fe097bd,1578807139.0,"I'm an ontological nihilist, I don't think there's really a difference between fiction and reality, other than perspective. I don't think ""entities"" exist, outside of the ones we make. You could be born with a meaning from your parents, and they theirs, but eventually it unravels back to meaninglessness."
Existentialism,fe08dbz,t1_fe0844h,1578805840.0,"Your actions can have meaning, but you as a whole person, do not. Your life is a genetic accident, pure random chance. To assign it any meaning would be like claiming the sun only exists to give sunburns."
Existentialism,fe07c02,t1_fe074rk,1578804971.0,"Rocks (or anything else in nature) can be used, but it still doesn't give them meaning. 
I wouldn't want meaning,honestly. I like getting to just be myself, raw and perfect."
PhilosophyMemes,fe062pw,t3_enem5s,1578803974.0,"I feel like Nietzsche would be ideal for this meme, he was obsessive about Christian morality"
PhilosophyMemes,fe05x7h,t1_fdzcged,1578803856.0,How do you know that they only mean philosophy memes? Perhaps the highest stage is general meme mastery.
Existentialism,fe05sqo,t1_fe05hxc,1578803765.0,"I don't think our lives have meaning because I don't think they were created purposefully. Rocks don't have meaning, they just are. Cars have meaning (transportation) because they were created purposefully."
PhilosophyMemes,fe05o20,t3_enh77n,1578803668.0,"I don't get why Schopenhauer would be upset by his rights being limited, if he thinks that freedom and the Will are both terrible?"
Existentialism,fe057lb,t1_fe04qbl,1578803354.0,"I'm actually more of an optimistic nihilist, myself. But an absurdist would say that if you think your life has meaning, you're the victim of illusion or delusion."
Existentialism,fe030nz,t1_fdxe9ei,1578801805.0,"The fight is against our inability to have or make meaning. We try, knowing that it is futile, because it's better than giving up. This doesn't give our life meaning, but it does make our life more enjoyable."
Existentialism,fdwu17d,t1_fdwrz7x,1578762328.0,"Absurdism definitely aligns somewhat with nihilism, but nihilists either embrace or simply accept meaninglessness. Existentialists try to find meaning as an individual, and absurdists fight back against both meaninglessness and their own yearning for meaning. The theory is largely based on Camus' works, and he specifically addresses what he views as the failures of nihilism and existentialism."
nihilism,fdv88oo,t1_fdv74nu,1578744443.0,"Absolutely. My recommendation? Head in a direction that gives you more will. Even if you ultimately don't like the state, it'll make it easier to change."
nihilism,fdv658c,t1_fduuxtc,1578743758.0,"If you don't know what state you want, simply change in any direction. If you're lost, standing in the same place will never allow you to find your way."
Absurdism,fdv5jn6,t1_fakvuze,1578743439.0,"Camus (or any absurdist) would say that he pushed the rock as a form of rebellion. Sisyphus was dead, but he refused to be defeated, even by the impossible. He finds continued meaning in rolling the boulder precisely because he doesn't have to."
Absurdism,fdv4v54,t3_efcndb,1578743270.0,You could also contribute something... ya know... good? History books aren't the Hall of Infamy
Absurdism,fdv498l,t3_ek37we,1578743043.0,"I'm an optimistic nihilist, so I'm like the absurdist's cousin lol. Feel free to pm me.

Also, I didn't know I had this problem until I started college and met other philospher peers. Now I can't wait for break to be over so I can resume our discussions."
Absurdism,fdv341n,t1_fdbplks,1578742671.0,"You can take one of those nihilistic viewpoints and not the others. I personally believe in metaphysical nihilism, but I find moral nihilism abhorrent. Morals are just as fictitious as anything else, but certainly more useful and productive. 
Also, you can't destroy what never existed."
Existentialism,fdukajf,t1_fdrqwl9,1578734235.0,"Existentialism is about finding meaning, Absurdism is about rebelling against meaninglessness."
nihilism,fdug2sz,t3_emmqnc,1578732461.0,"What's the point in waking up? There isn't one. There's also no point in giving up, no point of staying in bed. If your life and death are meaningless, then you can't possible screw it up. So go out, be crazy and do what feels right."
nihilism,fduf1qv,t3_emx675,1578732155.0,"Honestly? I think nihilism is a SOURCE of happiness. Look at sandbox games (TES, Fallout). Humans naturally enjoy pointlessness. We enjoy the freedom of being our own master, and meaning is simply a self-imposed master."
nihilism,fduelaw,t1_fdpl2sc,1578731954.0,It could be epistemic or ontological nihilism
nihilism,fdudydj,t1_fdteh6r,1578731650.0,"You may need to try more/different antidepressants, honestly. I had no success with them until I tried an SNRI instead of an SSRI"
nihilism,fdudtji,t1_fdt9ets,1578731593.0,"Even as nihilists, we have desires and we should pursue them, simply because it is more comfortable to pursue them. You obviously have a distaste for your current state, so logically you should pursue things that may change your current state."
nihilism,fducw2y,t3_d8l7hp,1578731302.0,"So what you're talking about is existential nihilism, the belief that life is without meaning. This is in conflict with hedonism, which says that pleasure is the meaning of life. Absurdism would probably be a good school of thought for you to explore, believing that life is meaningless but that we cannot simply accept or embrace this meaninglessness, but that we must fight it to carve meaning into our lives."
PhilosophyMemes,fduarlo,t1_fdtmesy,1578730527.0,"Yeah, that's pretty perfect. Kant also argued that everybody lying would make lying useless as well, because lies are only helpful when believed, which couldn't happen in a society of liars."
PhilosophyMemes,fdrrwzd,t3_emvhwa,1578688862.0,"It reminds me of epistemic nihilism. We can't really know anything if we dig too deep into it, so find what makes you happy."
PhilosophyMemes,fdp277w,t3_em6qm9,1578618236.0,"""You mean Nazis Ayn? Then just say Nazis"""
PhilosophyMemes,fdp1n9v,t1_fdp18pr,1578617863.0,"Camus hated suicide, he found it inauthentic. He heavily encouraged living absurdly, not dying for fear of suffering."
PhilosophyMemes,fdmyw1v,t1_fdmyqqj,1578571807.0,"It doesn't, however, require what we typically view as free will. It doesn't require a unscientific point of view, and completely acknowledges deterministic actions while upholding moral responsibility. I didn't say that it was perfect, just that it was an alternative to ""no responsibility"" or ""la la la i can't hear physics"""
PhilosophyMemes,fdmyfzx,t1_fdmt8pf,1578571312.0,"Compatibalism doesn't believe in ""free will"". It simply says that if we're all determined, but can make choices independently of other determined entities, then we have some degree of will, and can be held responsible for its execution"
PhilosophyMemes,fdmmgnm,t1_fdmkat0,1578555571.0,"I dunno, I think compatibalism does a pretty good job of acknowledging science but maintaining moral responsibility"
PhilosophyMemes,fcz6p11,t3_ei6cbm,1578094769.0,"Yeah, putting Nazis as Chads and anti-colonialists as ""virgin cucks"" is uhhh disgusting."
thatHappened,fcnlihv,t1_fcnl61m,1577813810.0,"Yeah, but this isn't an attempt and that's one reason. He said many reasons for thoughts being illegal, which they are not."
