Moviesinthemaking,ffbf24h,t1_ffb9ucc,1579762500.0,"Digital sensor sensitivity is generally better than film in terms of final image quality. Light sensitivity is measured in ISO, typically starting at 100 and going up from there. A ""stop"" of light means about 2x as much light, and ISO reflects this -- stops are 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, etc.

The way digital sensors and actual film handle this light sensitivity is different, but notably with film you get a lot of ""grain"" because of how it's designed. With digital, you get sensor noise that *looks kinda like* grain, but it's a little different.

Now, back to the ""digital sensors are pretty kickass these days"" bit. You can shoot at comparatively high ISOs (1600, 3200, 6400) and still get a pretty decent result, which would enable you to shoot in lower lighting conditions (because more sensitivity means you need less light).

We subconciously pick up on things like color temperature. Older streetlights had a more orange color to them (see this video by Technology Connections about high pressure sodium lamps: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1dMlVwUsrA) whereas more modern LED lights (like you can see towards the end of the frame on the highway in the OP) tend to have cooler (more white/blue) color temperatures. For a period piece like OUATIH, this would stick out like a sore thumb. It *is* possible (and quite easy) to adjust white balance in post to compensate, but it's always nicer if you just plain don't have to.

Even ""night time"" scenes in video are typically very well lit, but they use the aforementioned ""white balance"" trick to make your brain go ""oh, it's night"". This in particular is by using color temperatures that are closer to moonlight (or high pressure sodium lamps, for instance, in a city scene), than they are to daylight. This again plays in to the ""make it look like night time with color temperature"" by using a color temperature for street lighting that's appropriate for night time.

So by introducing their own lighting rigs like this, they get:

1. enough light to fully capture the details they want  
2. enough control over the temperature and style of that light to make it appear period-correct

and anything else they want to do, they can do in post. But it's also generally easier to film with more light, and edit it down (or adjust camera settings appropriately) if you want it darker."

Depending on how and what you're shooting, you may not *want* to blast your flash off at high power if you don't need to. And yes, different color temperatures can be important -- if you have some ambient light in your shot, it can skew the color balance. But then we're getting into really nitpicky technical stuff, so it depends what you're doing.

If I'm shooting, say, [a photo of my dogs jumping during playtime in the house](https://i.imgur.com/4MFpgUN.jpg), I might not bother turning any of the other lights off. If I'm shooting something, say, [a roller derby game where the skaters need to be able to see](https://i.imgur.com/KzvVUtE.jpg), I may not even have the choice. But in both examples, the ""other"" lighting is largely moot, due to *how much more* of the light is coming from my strobes than is coming from the ambient light.

That said, if you can easily toss a blanket over a window or something there's no real reason *not* to, but if you shoot with the right flash settings then you can pretty much all but kill ambient light in it's entirety."

>Or maybe it's just a wealthy person who took a thousand photos on his trip to Italy.

The number of people who this would even apply to is probably terribly, terribly minute. Most average people don't take a thousand photos of anything, and we're back to ""most photographers will edit their own photos themselves"".

>But culling was the main attraction of my service, paired with expert-level editing. You're right, anybody can open up Lightroom and edit photos. But I do it exceptionally well, which is why I was trying to offer it as a service.

Let's say you charge $5/photo for editing. All it takes is two photos for somebody to be able to afford their own Lightroom subscription that month, and when you start getting into quantities above that (like, say, 20 photos?) then it *really* stops  making sense. An amateur is unlikely to spend that kind of money on their amateur photography especially when they can get Lightroom or a free equivalent themselves and teach themselves how to do it for much cheaper. And a professional is unlikely to spend that kind of money because all it serves to do is cut into their margins.

hiphopheads,fewtkre,t3_eq95i2,1579419287.0,"I've been real into Mac since about Blue Slide Park, been to some shows, always kept up with the albums. Mac Miller was (and still is) one of my favorite artists.

I really liked Circles, a lot.

There's definitely an element that feels like I'm giving it more leeway because it's a posthumous album. But like others have said -- it's generally upbeat, it feels intimate, etc... It's not a repetitive project which suits Mac perfectly, since every album has such a distinct feel to it. Where Swimming felt heavy and downtrodden, Circles feels uplifting -- even in it's sad songs, it's lighter and more ""Well, I guess it is what it is"" rather than ""This weight is crushing"", if that makes sense.

I *adore* the production. It feels so much more natural, calming, perhaps personal? Than some of his past projects. Jon Brion did an amazing job with it.

I've never really been a fan of Mac's singing style as I haven't particularly felt like he has a good singing voice, but that works for Circles so well. It feels like you're listening to a friend, somebody who's just riffing about in the living room rather than some big studio production. It's cozy and endearing.

It's sad that this is going to be the last official project, but it feels like a high note. Swimming was so heavy and like others have said, it almost sounds like a suicide note. Swimming feels like that moment the sun starts to come out after a rainstorm -- yeah, it's still cold and wet outside, but things are looking up.

I'm just about the same age as Mac, and his albums have always felt like they followed me through life. I think that's a big part of my connection to his music -- during the BSP era, I was an energetic young kid. By the time WMWTSO came out I was starting to deal with the realities of life and adulthood. GO:OD AM dropped and I was starting to get that feeling like I was on my shit, in my groove and starting to make moves in life. TDF helped encapsulate feelings I had for a (now long-term) partner, and Swimming came at another dark time.

But Circles comes out not that long after my wedding, there's been some real shit going on in my life but pretty much literally this month it's starting to smooth out and calm down and Circles just feels perfect. It's like reaching the other side of a storm. I'm tired, but looking forward to the future for the first time in a while, and Circles feels like that.

I picked up both versions of the album on vinyl, the clear version from the official store and the UO exclusive white record. They're going to be cherished parts of my collection for a long time, getting put on the turntable to spin and enjoy, like reminiscing about an old friend. Hearing Mac's voice again like this is like playing a voicemail from an old friend you can't bring yourself to delete."
IAmA,fewec47,t1_feuqcjn,1579409174.0,"That's not how the negotiation process works.

Let's say a dealership buys a car for $17,500 and lists it for $20,000. That $2,500 difference is how the dealership makes it's money. They're not waiting for somebody to come in so they can say ""Actually, it's $22,500 now."" A dealership will always sell you the car at the price listed on the window sticker (fun fact: It's called a Monroney label!) unless you're just a miserable dick to work with to the point where they don't even want your business. But they'll never go above their listed price.

What the negotiation process is is basically you finding out how much *below* that listed price they'll go. Sometimes they have a fair bit of margin in the car and they don't mind giving some of it up, sometimes they'll take less profit if it means you come back for service regularly, sometimes they've just plain had a car on the lot too long and they want it gone so they can get something more desirable in it's spot."

MacMiller,feme06c,t1_fem4val,1579250616.0,"I'd say it's more than just possible, it's entirely likely.

Rolling out an album takes coordination, and setting a specific date is part of that. Chances are Em had this date planned already. Mac's album got announced like a week ago. That's unlikely to be enough time for Em to have changed the date. 

Even when an artist is quiet about something, there's a lot going on behind the scenes to roll stuff out. It's not like Em himself was sitting at home with a big red button labeled ""DROP"" that he just hit when he saw Mac's album come out."
