fo4,ff5ha1m,t1_ff57y0o,1579592819.0,The exploding submarine gun spray and pray is amazing too...just tears through anything in a few shots I’m hoping to find more exploding legendary weapons those seem pretty rare so far
fo4,ff56opx,t3_erpg41,1579581781.0,I just found it off a legendary death claw I think...The only good weapon I’ve gotten off an enemy so far is the spray and pray so I was just expecting some armor or something...was not expecting this I didn’t even know it existed. Takes down just about any enemy in one shot love it

fo4,fd824oc,t3_ek8c8r,1578213006.0," I found this awesome mod for PS4 that lets you throw a grenade, and instead of exploding it spawns a new settler...so much fun. I forgot I had it equipped and threw it at a ghoul - and she got murdered and I felt horrible.

Anyways this mod is perfect I brought sanctuary up to 35 settlers no issues so far."

So fucking what? He’s alive, has emotions, eats, drinks and plays. He can get injured, get anxiety, feel happy, sad and everything in between.

But because he’s an animal I should what? Give him shit food and make him sleep outside in the dirt?

People that say shit like this don’t get it because they have no empathy and can’t understand why people like animals.

These people are the fucking worst close minded low intelligence idiots on the planet."

thesopranos,fckf1xo,t1_fcejmeg,1577723885.0,"The show has so many little funny moments that are serious and funny at the same time.

My favorite is when Paulie tells Chrissy “mix it with the relish!” And when Chrissy says “maybe it’s him out there hunting us” to which Paulie replies “with what? How cock?”

So funny"
thesopranos,fckeqw4,t3_efr16f,1577723690.0,"Agreed. I think the ending is meant to show how Tony lives and his constant state of fear and paranoia watching people coming and going, if they are an enemy, have a weapon etc.

It’s a glimpse into the point of view of Tony and how even going to a simple family dinner is stressful.

It also leaves the story open for more in the future...which I believe if James Gandolfini was still here, they would have done at some point."

Fallout,fc9g17l,t3_egs1lz,1577552142.0,"On the perk chart, initially the first row is highlighted and everything else is grey. This does NOT mean you can’t upgrade the grey perk items. They are also available. Don’t make same mistake I did and only think row 1 is all the perks available. It does not go in sequential order.

I wasted 20 perks upgrading crap in row 1 I didn’t even want until I realized just now that the perks don’t go in order."
Fallout,fc9fs7f,t3_egs1i7,1577552030.0,Dude...spoiler tag please
Fallout,fc9f2ug,t1_fc93n0y,1577551729.0,"I’m kind of embarrassed but when I started the game a few weeks ago I didn’t realize I could purchase perks outside of the first row since everything was greyed out...I assumed I needed higher levels to acquire them...so I spent all my perks maxing out the first 5 rows (strength, luck, etc) and just recently realized how much other stuff I am able to upgrade....so dumb of me I wasted all my perks on stuff I didn’t even want because I thought I had to max out row 1 to get to row 2

So I set up a big water farm first and just now am getting around to getting scrounged. So far my water farm generates about 200 water a day which I can sell for about 1400 I think. When I scrounge I’m sure it will be huge since I collect absolutely everything. Hopefully this will give me what I need to continue building my elaborate settlements all out of steel and concrete."

Fallout,fc9c30j,t1_fc83qvc,1577550361.0,"Same - sometimes I’ll fast travel back and forth to sanctuary several times to unload in the middle of a mission because I’m at max weight. I get a lot this way but I need a LOT for the building sizes I’ve been doing, for example I used up all the steel from every item I scrapped in sanctuary (cars, kitchens, etc) on a single building and still didn’t have enough steel to finish it.

Of course I built several turrets and generators and other necessities first but when I started doing buildings they’ve gotten out of control a bit and I keep running out of supplies"
Fallout,fc9bsb7,t1_fc7zuni,1577550230.0,I have a few scavenging stations with people assigned...where does the materials they find go? Directly into my workshop or do I have to do something else?
Fallout,fc7x956,t1_fc7v2di,1577521056.0,I just set up my water farm so hopefully this will be a good way I figure I’ll pour everything into my water farm until I’m producing 1000 water and sell off the extra. Then I can use the caps to buy materials. No matter how much I scavenge I never have enough..:especially copper and oil.
Fallout,fc7x40b,t1_fc7v060,1577520955.0,Could you explain to me how the stores work exactly? I thought they were just ways to buy things? How do they help your settlement and material inventory?

This person needs to be fired I’ve have dozens of business accounts over the years at several banks for both retail and internet companies - I’ve never ever heard of a site inspection.
