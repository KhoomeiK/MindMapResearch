As soon as the adults saw me walking towards the horses they stopped me. The first thing I ever learned was to bound with horses with someone else with you, until you got a bound with a horse and you know them. That was the only time you could do something with that horse. I had a great bound with a small pony called Lady, I learned to take care of a horse, bound with a horse, and ride a horse all with her. I miss her so much. May you Rest In Peace Lady. I miss you, and love you. 

So, bound with a horse WITH ANOHTER PERSON THAT KNOWS THAT HORSE AND HAS A BOUND WITH IT and LISTEN to that person AT ALL TIMES!! They say you‚Äôre not ready, you‚Äôre not ready. They say do something/don‚Äôt do something then don‚Äôt or do. It‚Äôs for the safety and well-being of both the horses and you."

I can‚Äôt believe you couldn‚Äôt find a joke... I took it over from ya!! :) 

So, what words can I combine?? I‚Äôll do edit it then. 

The twist was actually meant to the girl being a monster (I Can‚Äôt believe it, my autocorrect turned ‚Äúmonster into ‚Äúlobster‚Äù... it would‚Äôve been awkward if I hadn‚Äôt noticed it and posted it lol) but then I got the idea of making you think she‚Äôs a monster, and then [drumroll] it‚Äôs just a girl that got kidnapped as sort of a plottwist. I read somewhere that some story with someone who went outside for the diet time and didn‚Äôt know what the burning ball in the sky was and why it was hurting him. Then I read a comment that said he thought the twist was too obvious. 

So I actually thought ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna make such a story, but creepier‚Äù 

But then I thought ‚Äúwhat if it WASNT a monster, but they would think that and think it was obvious, but then they had it wrong, so it wasn‚Äôt obvious?!‚Äù"

I broke at The Flash on that one episode Vibes End or Farewell Vibe or something. Cisco was my favo character and I kid you not when I saw the title I freaked out. When the plot started I started freaking out more and more. When *the moment* came I was screaming and crying and when the plottwist came I was *screaming* and I mean *screaming and shouting **hard*** I even ran outside and grabbed the first person I saw (in the garden of my house don‚Äôt worry) and started dancing so hard forgetting about the blessure they had and hurting them running around and screaming and shouting like crazy I was happy out of my mind and eventually my asthma coughs up with me forcing me to stop and sit down to watch the rest of the show while gasping and fighting for breath.

Mom in a hurry, daughter following her. Maybe she has a dentist appointment she‚Äôs late for. 

Nope, she clamps a stranger and begs for help. Daughter has hopefully no clue what‚Äôs going on. Maybe an accident happened in the house? Murder? Dead body in it? 

Nope daughter is dead, man can‚Äôt see her. 

The man *can* see her, he‚Äôs in the pact. 

And oh no, he knows that Mommy is the reason she died 

Did she kill her? 

Did she not pay attention? 

Was she too late to pick her up and she got killed and wouldn‚Äôt have been if she was 5 min earlier? 

Was it an accident, like the mom driving a car and crashing killing the daughter? 

You‚Äôll never know

And then she wants to hug, wich is of course a *very* bad idea

But it does not stop there

I made her say that she ‚Äúwants to hug‚Äù 

Not only the mom

The idea is that she goes on a hugging spree and the mom is the switch. With the mom, she can enact her powers, her gift, our curse. 

Everyone she hugs after her mom is cursed and doomed 

The mom even facing a more horrible fate 

What fate?

There is a little bit of non story text in the post, saying your gonna make a sequel? 

I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre new here, but I thought I‚Äôd let you know before the mods see this. 


You can find the rules of the sub [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/dpc7ky/the_rules_of_the_sub_please_read_before_posting/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) 

The rules state a few things. 

Non story text should not be in the post. If you want to say something aside the story, it should be in the comments. 

You can‚Äôt tag your posts. So if you make a sequel, you can‚Äôt tag to previous post. 

And lastly, but surely, is that you can only can post one stand stories. No sequels, no prequels, just one stand stories. No series. 


Hope I‚Äôm not bossy or pushy, not meaning to be mean, I just thought I‚Äôd let you know, I hope I‚Äôm in time before the mods see it. You better edit it before the mods see it too, because otherwise it will be removed, and that‚Äôd be a true shame."
