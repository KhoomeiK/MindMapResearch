AskReddit,fgsei0j,t1_fgs1h8p,1581082104.0,I work in house construction and these days everyone’s doing en suites as a standard. Here I shared a bathroom with 4 siblings and felt like a king with a jack and jill as a teenager. Now kids rooms are getting their own baths. This is not luxury housing but I suppose if you’re renovating or building you do have some extra cash. Only upside I can think of is that at least these kids will know how to clean their own bathroom when they grow up. That’s still an issue many of my peers struggle with lol.

There are ridiculous amounts of them forced into indentured servitude that’s near impossible to escape in many many countries around the world. Not saying cages are the answer but dropping vulnerable people into precarious situations almost always leads to a worse situation.

Honestly people showed up to party at Area 51 when everyone KNEW the raid was gonna happen because it became a joke.
