socialskills,ff3hx2h,t1_ff3gzzi,1579541401.0,"If you ask an ambiguously stated question, expect an ambiguously stated answer. 


I get a lot of social anxiety and those ambiguous situations end up creating more anxiety because I don’t know what’s expected of me. 


For me, they way I framed the question was intentionally specific (asking her out) without specifying when or where because that’s more than one question that could have different answers. Maybe she wants to go on a date with you but doesn’t want dinner (I dunno, just saying she might prefer drinks or coffee or something more specific to her tastes).


Edit: sorry I forgot to say that I do not think you’d be coming on too strong. Most reasonable people get feel good feelings when they are asked out, even if they are going to say no or are uninterested for whatever reason. If she’s a decent human, and I like assuming people are, then even if she’s not interested, she will appreciate that you are reaching out and being direct enough that she knows what your intent is so that she can directly answer. 


Also, I hope she says yes but this is great practice, even if she says no. Please come back and let me know what she says, I feel invested now. Lol


Edit: not “ambitiously!” Actually now that I look, I’m seeing a few autocorrect errors and imma just fix em all now. Sorry about that."

disability,ff0buqm,t3_eqyv0y,1579467395.0,"My OT got me connected with a wheelchair manufacturer sales rep (I guess that’s what she was). She came to my doctor with me, it was an appointment specifically for this purpose because Medicaid requires it. That sales person had a very neatly organized folder with all her required paperwork (required from Medicaid, so that they will pay for it) already filled out very clearly and specifically, as well as a letter from my OT describing my symptoms and how a wheelchair would benefit me, (because Medicaid requires it). My doctor signed everything that day and 6 long weeks later I had my very own custom made power chair. 


I’m in a different state but I thought I’d give how it worked for me because Medicaid in Maryland May be a similar experience. Now disability- I got nothin there because my case is taking damn near forever.

socialskills,ff09ep7,t3_eqyxa5,1579466621.0,"“Hey there [name], I liked catching up the other day and wonder if you’d be interested in a date?” 


I’m no expert but as a female I think that’s nice and succinct, it leaves a nice opening for a reply either way, it doesn’t sound nervous or overly confident, and it doesn’t put any pressure on her to respond positively. Just have some date ideas ready to go, easy ones or specific ones to what you know about her. That way, when she replies with “yes!” you can respond with your ideas. Don’t put the pressure on her to come up with something after you’re the one who asks her out."

Parenting,fezw6yt,t3_eqyt7x,1579462449.0,"Okay, here’s the deal. When I was 15 I desperately wanted to accidentally fall pregnant. I just wanted to be loved. I had a boyfriend who I thought loved me and he was the closest thing to “supportive family member” I had. My mom *hated* him. For me he was like an oasis and the more she hated him and my relationship with him, the closer it made me feel to him; the more it made me *need* him. You should not forbid their relationship. They will probably break up eventually, but for now she needs him, especially considering she’s pregnant. I agree that she needs you too, but give them a chance to fail naturally with your loving support and guidance. Now that she’s having a baby, whether she keeps the pregnancy and baby or not, they are deeply connected in a forever type of way now. 


Btw, I did not have a great parent. I think my mom hopped on the hate him train because she was trying to make up for being a shitty mom by being a “caring” mom in this easy way, (it’s East to hate people) but she went about it all wrong. Instead of cared for, she just made me feel like a terrible person for needing to be loved by somebody, *anybody* and she certainly did not love me. 


Side note: he was probably the best and nicest guy I ever dated when I was young. I went from that healthy and loving relationship to abusive and violent relationships. They got worse and worse until I figured out how to stop the cycle. That happened because I never witnessed healthy love and I never really experienced it much either."

The methotrexate hurt. I don’t mean hurt like a cyst rupturing, or appendicitis, or even birth. I mean pain that was so real, so fucking deep and intense that it caused almost hallucinations and like a black out state. It was like an out of body experience but also not. The pain made the world seem less real I guess. It’s difficult to explain.
