> Here is a simplified ELI5: The bone sat in the ground with the same forces that create geodes, thus ended up looking like this. 

> Slightly longer explanation: Most soft tissues end up breaking down. Bones themselves are rigid because of the mineral known as ""calcium"", but have loads of soft tissue inside of them that will break down quickly. As they sit in the ground, over millions of years, water flows into and out of them, and different minerals dissolve and form at different rates. After millions of years, so much of the fossils' physical substance has been replaced in stages by minerals that, slowly, flow - as sediment - turns to rock and is buried deep enough in the earth's crust. Every area and layer of the crust is unique, with different long-term conditions creating a wide variety of outcomes.

AskReddit,fcjqbqh,t1_fcj7b69,1577699272.0,"Like the biscuit story, as told by Douglas Adams, known for his Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy:


""This actually did happen to a real person, and the real person is me. I had gone to catch a train, This was April 1976, in Cambridge, U.K. 
I was about twenty minutes early. 
I'd got the time of the train wrong. I suppose it is at least equally possible,""
he added after a moment's reflection, 
""that British Rail had got the time of the train wrong. Hadn't occurred to me before.""

             ""Get on with it."" Fenchurch laughed. 

""So I bought a newspaper, to do the crossword, and went to the buffet to get a cup of coffee.""

 	""You do the crossword?""

 ""Yes.""

 	""Which one?""

 ""The Guardian usually.""

 	""I think it tries to be too cute. I prefer The Times.  Did you solve it?"" 

""What?"" 

	""The crossword in The Guardian.""

 ""I haven't had a chance to look at it yet,"" said Arthur. ""I'm still trying to buy the coffee.""

 	""All right then. Buy the coffee."" 

""I'm buying it. I am also,"" said Arthur, ""buying some biscuits."" 

	""What sort?"" 

""Rich Tea."" 

	""Good choice.""

 ""I like them. Laden with all these new possessions, I go and sit at a table. And don't ask me what the table was like because this was some time ago and I can't remember. It was probably round."" 

	""All right.""

 ""So let me give you the layout. Me sitting at the table, on my left, the newspaper, on my right, the cup of coffee, in the middle of the table, the packet of biscuits."" 

	""I see it perfectly.""

 ""What you don't see,"" said Arthur, ""because I haven't mentioned him yet, is the guy sitting at the table already. He is sitting there opposite me."" 

	""What's he like?""

 ""Perfectly ordinary. Briefcase. Business suit. He didn't look,"" said Arthur, ""as if he was about to do anything weird."" 

	""Ah. I know the type. What did he do?""

 ""He did this. He leaned across the table, picked up the packet of biscuits, tore it open, took one out, and . . .""

 	""What?"" 

""Ate it.""

 	""What??""

 ""He ate it.""

 	Fenchurch looked at him in astonishment. ""What on earth did you do?"" 

""Well, in the circumstances I did what any red-blooded Englishman would do. I was compelled,"" said Arthur, ""to ignore it.""

 	""What? Why?""

 ""Well, it's not the sort of thing you're trained for, is it? I searched my soul, and discovered that there was nothing anywhere in my upbringing, experience, or even primal instincts to tell me how to react to someone who has quite simply, calmly, sitting right there in front of me, stolen one of my biscuits.""

	""Well, you could . . ."" Fenchurch thought about it. ""I must say I'm not sure what I would have done either. So what happened?""

""I stared furiously at the crossword,"" said Arthur, ""couldn't do a single clue, took a sip of coffee, it was too hot to drink, so there was nothing for it. I braced myself. I took a biscuit, trying very hard not to notice,"" he added, ""that the packet was already mysteriously open. . . .""

	 ""But you're fighting back, taking a tough line.""

   ""After my fashion, yes. I ate the biscuit. I ate it very deliberately and visibly, so that he would have no doubt as to what it was I was doing. When I eat a biscuit,"" said Arthur, 
""it stays eaten.""

	""So what did he do?""

""Took another one. Honestly,"" insisted Arthur, ""this is exactly what happened. He took another biscuit, he ate it. Clear as daylight. Certain as we are sitting on the ground.""

 	Fenchurch stirred uncomfortably. 

""And the problem was,"" said Arthur, ""that having not said anything the first time, it was somehow even more difficult to broach the subject the second time around. What do you say? 'Excuse me ...I couldn't help noticing, er . . .' ... Doesn't work. No, I ignored it with, if anything, even more vigor than previously.""

  	""My man .. ."" 

""Stared at the crossword again, still couldn't budge a bit of it, so showing some of the spirit that Henry V did on St. Crispin's Day . ."" 

 	 ""What?"" 

""I went into the breach again. I took,"" said Arthur, ""another biscuit. And for an instant our eyes met.""

 	 ""Like this?"" 

""Yes, well, no, not quite like that. But they met. Just for an instant. And we both looked away. But I am here to tell you,"" said Arthur, 
""that there was a little electricity in the air. There was a little tension building up over the table. At about this time.""

	 ""I can imagine.""

    ""We went through the whole packet like this. Him, me, him, me . . .""

  	""The whole packet?"" 

""Well, it was only eight biscuits, but it seemed like a lifetime of biscuits we were getting through at this point. Gladiators could hardly have had a tougher time.""

   	""Gladiators,"" said Fenchurch, ""would have had to do it in the sun. More physically gruelling."" 

   ""There is that. So. When the empty packet was lying dead between us the man at last got up, having done his worst, and left. I heaved a sigh of relief, of course. 
""As it happened, my train was announced a moment or two later, so I finished my coffee, stood up, picked up the newspaper, and underneath the newspaper . . ."" 

   	""Yes?"" 

""Were my biscuits."" 

   	""What?"" said Fenchurch. ""What?""

""True.""

 	  ""No!""

> Here is a simplified ELI5: The bone sat in the ground with the same forces that create geodes, thus ended up looking like this. 

> Slightly longer explanation: Most soft tissues end up breaking down. Bones themselves are rigid because of the mineral known as ""calcium"", but have loads of soft tissue inside of them that will break down quickly. As they sit in the ground, over millions of years, water flows into and out of them, and different minerals dissolve and form at different rates. After millions of years, so much of the fossils' physical substance has been replaced in stages by minerals that, slowly, flow - as sediment - turns to rock and is buried deep enough in the earth's crust. Every area and layer of the crust is unique, with different long-term conditions creating a wide variety of outcomes.

These three places made the world wars more real, if that makes sense. There's also the concentration camps, but I've never been, and I'm not sure I would include that in a relatively short voyage. Too intense, probably. That was all so fucked up, you can't just visit and then go on your merry way. 

We also visited the D-day beaches, and near Fort Vaux you can see a bit of the trenches and the bomb-ravaged terrain.

As for non-war-related places to visit in France, the pink granite coast in Bretagne et Mont Saint Michel in Normandie; Lake Annecy, Chamonix, Aiguille du Midi, near the Alps, and Geneva if you want to see what money looks like in a city; La Rochelle if you want to see a seafaring town; Tours if you like the medieval thing.

Germany I've visited less often, and I usually go straight to Austria (Badgastein and similar towns in the Alps are just too beautiful to be real, and they're relatively cheap in summer, they make their money from winter skiers) or to the Netherlands (their Delta Works are a feat of engineering and they deserve a visit, if you're into megastructures). But I'm sure others will be able to tell you things to visit in Germany. The Bastion Bridge there is breathtaking:

full of unexploded ordinance. Staying there during the relentless bombings must have been deafening and terrifying. I can't imagine the smell, the noise, the terror. 

I also visited WWII Fort Hackenberg, on the Maginot Line. It was big, modern, well ventilated, comfortable, even welcoming. You kinda felt safe and well there. Yeah, war is war, but at least you could feel human.

""This actually did happen to a real person, and the real person is me. I had gone to catch a train, This was April 1976, in Cambridge, U.K. 
I was about twenty minutes early. 
I'd got the time of the train wrong. I suppose it is at least equally possible,""
he added after a moment's reflection, 
""that British Rail had got the time of the train wrong. Hadn't occurred to me before.""

             ""Get on with it."" Fenchurch laughed. 

""So I bought a newspaper, to do the crossword, and went to the buffet to get a cup of coffee.""

 	""You do the crossword?""

 ""Yes.""

 	""Which one?""

 ""The Guardian usually.""

 	""I think it tries to be too cute. I prefer The Times.  Did you solve it?"" 

""What?"" 

	""The crossword in The Guardian.""

 ""I haven't had a chance to look at it yet,"" said Arthur. ""I'm still trying to buy the coffee.""

 	""All right then. Buy the coffee."" 

""I'm buying it. I am also,"" said Arthur, ""buying some biscuits."" 

	""What sort?"" 

""Rich Tea."" 

	""Good choice.""

 ""I like them. Laden with all these new possessions, I go and sit at a table. And don't ask me what the table was like because this was some time ago and I can't remember. It was probably round."" 

	""All right.""

 ""So let me give you the layout. Me sitting at the table, on my left, the newspaper, on my right, the cup of coffee, in the middle of the table, the packet of biscuits."" 

	""I see it perfectly.""

 ""What you don't see,"" said Arthur, ""because I haven't mentioned him yet, is the guy sitting at the table already. He is sitting there opposite me."" 

	""What's he like?""

 ""Perfectly ordinary. Briefcase. Business suit. He didn't look,"" said Arthur, ""as if he was about to do anything weird."" 

	""Ah. I know the type. What did he do?""

 ""He did this. He leaned across the table, picked up the packet of biscuits, tore it open, took one out, and . . .""

 	""What?"" 

""Ate it.""

 	""What??""

 ""He ate it.""

 	Fenchurch looked at him in astonishment. ""What on earth did you do?"" 

""Well, in the circumstances I did what any red-blooded Englishman would do. I was compelled,"" said Arthur, ""to ignore it.""

 	""What? Why?""

 ""Well, it's not the sort of thing you're trained for, is it? I searched my soul, and discovered that there was nothing anywhere in my upbringing, experience, or even primal instincts to tell me how to react to someone who has quite simply, calmly, sitting right there in front of me, stolen one of my biscuits.""

	""Well, you could . . ."" Fenchurch thought about it. ""I must say I'm not sure what I would have done either. So what happened?""

""I stared furiously at the crossword,"" said Arthur, ""couldn't do a single clue, took a sip of coffee, it was too hot to drink, so there was nothing for it. I braced myself. I took a biscuit, trying very hard not to notice,"" he added, ""that the packet was already mysteriously open. . . .""

	 ""But you're fighting back, taking a tough line.""

   ""After my fashion, yes. I ate the biscuit. I ate it very deliberately and visibly, so that he would have no doubt as to what it was I was doing. When I eat a biscuit,"" said Arthur, 
""it stays eaten.""

	""So what did he do?""

""Took another one. Honestly,"" insisted Arthur, ""this is exactly what happened. He took another biscuit, he ate it. Clear as daylight. Certain as we are sitting on the ground.""

 	Fenchurch stirred uncomfortably. 

""And the problem was,"" said Arthur, ""that having not said anything the first time, it was somehow even more difficult to broach the subject the second time around. What do you say? 'Excuse me ...I couldn't help noticing, er . . .' ... Doesn't work. No, I ignored it with, if anything, even more vigor than previously.""

  	""My man .. ."" 

""Stared at the crossword again, still couldn't budge a bit of it, so showing some of the spirit that Henry V did on St. Crispin's Day . ."" 

 	 ""What?"" 

""I went into the breach again. I took,"" said Arthur, ""another biscuit. And for an instant our eyes met.""

 	 ""Like this?"" 

""Yes, well, no, not quite like that. But they met. Just for an instant. And we both looked away. But I am here to tell you,"" said Arthur, 
""that there was a little electricity in the air. There was a little tension building up over the table. At about this time.""

	 ""I can imagine.""

    ""We went through the whole packet like this. Him, me, him, me . . .""

  	""The whole packet?"" 

""Well, it was only eight biscuits, but it seemed like a lifetime of biscuits we were getting through at this point. Gladiators could hardly have had a tougher time.""

   	""Gladiators,"" said Fenchurch, ""would have had to do it in the sun. More physically gruelling."" 

   ""There is that. So. When the empty packet was lying dead between us the man at last got up, having done his worst, and left. I heaved a sigh of relief, of course. 
""As it happened, my train was announced a moment or two later, so I finished my coffee, stood up, picked up the newspaper, and underneath the newspaper . . ."" 

   	""Yes?"" 

""Were my biscuits."" 

   	""What?"" said Fenchurch. ""What?""

""True.""

 	  ""No!""

In this [clip](https://twitter.com/Inafr_officiel/status/1210154263759990784), from 1990, the Canadian writer, Denise Bombardier, literally accuses Matzneff of sodomizing young girls. The host, Mr. Pivot, even says to Matzneff: ""you are only interested in high-schoolers, not even girls over 20yrs"". Matzneff then says he's never had success with women over 25 or 30; he's arguing that it's not his fault that only teenagers seem interested in him. The host, Pivot, says that Matzneff collects adolescent girls. 

Bombardier, the female Canadian writer, then goes on to say that she feels like she's from a different planet, because in Canada pedophilia is reprehensible, whereas in France, in literature, paedo stuff is allowed. She does explicitly call out Matzneff as an abuser; she says Matzneff's relationships with teenager girls are an abuse of power; she says the girls are only 14-15 years old, too young to know better. She says it's an imbalanced relationship, and that we should protect the young. The other participants in the debate are never as explicit in their condemnation of Matzneff. 

The whole thing is just disgusting. I feel bad that Bombardier even faced backlash for it. The gross part is that a lot of people romanticize paedophilia."
