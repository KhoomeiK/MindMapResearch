PoliticalDiscussion,fffjsn0,t1_fffib1p,1579885483.0,"Ehh, I'd say it was a mix. His first foray into politics wasn't birtherism, he was active before that. In 1989 he took out a full page ad calling for the death penalty for the Central Park 5 (who were later exonerated by DNA evidence, although Trump maintains their guilt). I wouldn't say those things are random, he's just a racist. 

He had a few other things, shown here.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump#Political_activities_up_to_2015

Now, I will agree that he has some political cunning, in that he is good at noticing what his base likes from what he says, and adding it to the ""Greatest Hits"". There's also things I don't think he has an opinion on that he just says whatever his base wants. But I'm also inclined to believe that's in part due to his narcissism, and he loves having rabid fans and haters both, and that he's lucky that that works in today's political landscape."

Of course they wanted him out from day one. But until I see some kind of evidence that there's nothing to this Ukraine thing after all, and the Democrats don't actually believe he did anything wrong, I have no reason to believe they're arguing in bad faith.

But if you have a decent amount of friends and they're all white, you should ask yourself: why? It's not a condemnation, but a call for introspection, a look at yourself and the communities that you are a part of. Maybe there's minorities around that just don't feel comfortable for whatever reason, or maybe minorities have been excluded, even if you weren't aware. Diversity is not about numbers, it's about a mindset of openness, and an awareness that people of different backgrounds can give different perspectives than what you might have experienced. If you and all your friends are 40 year old white males, you will struggle to understand where people who are not like you are coming from. It's a form of echo chamber, just like reddit is. 

Mr. Hancock in the article isn't upset that his friend circle doesn't have the variety of skin tones he wanted, or felt that society expected of him. He realized that Newman was more than what he had limited himself to, and decided to change that.

Also, I'm surprised that you say that social circles are typically established at younger ages.

It's true that you can't spread out minority voters in order to dilute their votes. But that's saying you can't gerrymander in order to do so, not that you must gerrymander to avoid it. There are EXCEPTIONS in which districts can be affirmatively racially gerrymandered, but are extremely rare. No state is going through a ""balancing act"".

Foodforthought,fcvfjuz,t1_fcvcg3n,1578001038.0,"Gates suggested several different ways to tax big money. He didn't say anything about new startups. The problem is that the mega rich already HAVE  the money. There's no other way to solve inequality and fund the government other than some form of tax.

You do of course run the risk of moving money offshore, etc, but I'm guessing Gates has already taken that into account. It doesn't matter if big money leaves the country if there's no taxes off of their billions.

The world (and even cities and states, with the example of Amazon/Google HQs) really needs to come to some kind of agreement on taxes instead of racing to the bottom to draw in large companies. Probably impossible, but who knows."

Not that it would matter for mens rea, because mens rea only applies to intent to commit an act and the consequences thereof, not whether that act was moral or immoral.

As for betraying his oath to the U.S., he regarded it as loyalties conflicting with each other. He regarded his loyalty to the South, Virginia, and his family as more important than his loyalty to the U.S. He did believe that slavery was the best form of race relations available, and that the North was wrong for attacking the institution.  

Again, not saying he's a good man, but he felt regret for the ""necessity"". It's up to your own sense of morality whether that makes it better or worse, as you have."

The premade characters are just too good for custom characters to appeal too much.

And the answer to your question depends heavily on how much you think intent matters versus actions. I imagine the slaves he owned would say it didn't matter. Some might say the hypocrisy makes it worse, while others will say that good intentions (for the ""instruction as a race"") count for something, even if his actions are indistinguishable. I'm inclined with it does make him a better man, but in the same way that Zoolander 2 is a better movie than Jack and Jill. Still horrible."

He was the General of the army of a rebellion against the US which was started because the rebels wanted slaves. He chose state over country, morality, and his personal belief on secession. His honor was never in question, but calling him a good man is questionable.


As far as slavery goes, he was torn, but he owned slaves, never spoke out for abolition (as many ""right-minded peers"" did), and wrote this in a letter to his wife:

>“In this enlightened age, there are few I believe, but what will acknowledge, that slavery as an institution, is a moral & political evil in any Country. It is useless to expatiate on its disadvantages.” But he goes on: “I think it however a greater evil to the white than to the black race, & while my feelings are strongly enlisted in behalf of the latter, my sympathies are more strong for the former. The blacks are immeasurably better off here than in Africa, morally, socially & physically. The painful discipline they are undergoing, is necessary for their instruction as a race, & I hope will prepare & lead them to better things. How long their subjugation may be necessary is known & ordered by a wise Merciful Providence.”

So he believed it was wrong, but it was really bad for white people because it stained their morality; the black people were better off, they needed it to grow as a race. Pretty racist, although not as bad as many contemporaries.

And finally, this is what Frederick Douglass said about many glowing obituaries:

>“We can scarcely take up a newspaper . . . that is not filled with nauseating flatteries” of Lee, from which “it would seem . . . that the soldier who kills the most men in battle, even in a bad cause, is the greatest Christian, and entitled to the highest place in heaven.”

Mr. Rogers was definitely a saint among men, though."

todayilearned,fcoalsy,t1_fco9dd6,1577827571.0,"Not saying Lee was a good person or that he wasn't a face of the Confederacy, but he did believe that seceding was wrong, both morally and Constitutionally. He is widely acknowledged as having joined the Confederacy out of loyalty to Virginia, and its democratic decision.

On slavery, he wrote this passage in a private letter:

> “In this enlightened age, there are few I believe, but what will acknowledge, that slavery as an institution, is a moral & political evil in any Country. It is useless to expatiate on its disadvantages.” But he goes on: “I think it however a greater evil to the white than to the black race, & while my feelings are strongly enlisted in behalf of the latter, my sympathies are more strong for the former.

The painful discipline they are undergoing, is necessary for their instruction as a race, & I hope will prepare & lead them to better things. How long their subjugation may be necessary is known & ordered by a wise Merciful Providence.”

So he didn't want to, it's clearly wrong for white people to do that, and he felt bad for the black people, but it was for their own good. There was nothing he could do. /s"
