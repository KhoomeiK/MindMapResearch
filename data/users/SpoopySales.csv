BPD,ff6vuj1,t3_ersriq,1579635935.0,"I think you just did convey support and I thank you for it.

It helps me a lot to know these emotions I deal with are a part of a real problem that has a real name and that I'm not the only one who feels this way. 

I hope all of you are having a good day, and if not ::hugs::"

The first time I heard it was a bad week for me. My grandmother died suddenly and two days later, my Aunt died from breast cancer. I was driving home and the first line hit me like a gut punch. I pulled over and just ... wept.

At least my cat loves me."
BPD,fe6jcze,t3_enwg6g,1578892780.0,"People with BPD can feel a very strong need to enforce control on what goes on around them and those they interact with. This often leads to the use of manipulation as a defense mechanism. 

This manipulation gives them a false sense of security when, in fact, they are hurting, and often, driving away those they seek to maintain in their lives.

I've seen it happen, and have had it happen to me. I'm more prone to jealousy/feeling of abandonment but I often wonder if what I'm saying or doing is coming from a need to control."

AskReddit,fe0beyn,t3_en7n9i,1578808649.0,"Oprah Winfrey - so.fucking.wooden! Even her narration work is irritating. 

WHY did she have to be in A Wrinkle in Time?! It so disappointed me to see she would be in it. Same with The Inmortal Life of Henrietta Lacks."
TwoXChromosomes,fdi5nsa,t1_fdggdq9,1578436174.0,"A properly handled HR sexual harassment claim is confidential. The harasser in question should be spoken to in private without knowing who made the claim. If the harrassment stops, problem solved. Sometimes people have bad habits they have never been called out on.

Now, if the harrassment escalates, or if you are retaliated against, it must be escalated. An HR Department that is doing it's job must take this seriously and, again, confidentially. 

If not, well then my sister, it is time to lawyer up.

You are NOT starting trouble by speaking up, you are ENDING it."
BPD,fdgrmd5,t1_fdglucz,1578406530.0,"Message her, let her know you're thinking of her and are there if she wants to talk or meet up. Remind her you care and are willing to take things at her pace. Go slow.

It's really hard when you have BPD and care about people. You crave the contact but find it overwhelming. You get horribly lonely but you want to be left alone. You love fiercely but it's overwhelming and terrifying."
aww,fdgqr1v,t1_fdgkvjc,1578405863.0,"It's very dependent on the preference of the cat, but a general rule would be to not as they are sensitive. A kitten would have shorter, softer whiskers so going against the grain like this person is probably feels a bit odd, but not unpleasant, hence the twitchies. My adult wouldn't like it, but slicking them back occasionally as I stroke his cheek is a favorite and is really the only way I fuss with them."

My feelings were REAL. What was wrong with me has a NAME. I wasn't ALONE. 

I'm glad you've found us too."
aww,fch2o2b,t1_fcgxea3,1577646731.0,"Piercing studs lock on pretty tight and it takes a bit more dexterity than an infant has to pull them out. They'll fuss with them a bit but realize quick it hurts to pull and stop. Lots of cultures peirce their girl's ears very young. It's not that big a thing, really. She can always choose later not to wear them."

Every time I see one of these, I get emotional because I can't help think about the ones who return covered by a flag or broken and scarred.

Time to bring them all home and let the world sort out their own arguments."

AskReddit,fc3zx67,t3_efqzp6,1577402975.0,"Went to Christmas dinner at my aunt's house and a bunch of cousins had come up from Tennessee that I hadn't seen in a long time. Everything was great until they started bringing out presents. My dad, his brother and wife, and myself were not included in this exchange so we got to sit in the kitchen for half an hour listening to things being unwrapped. It was horribly awkward for the 4 of us and really hurt my feelings more than I expected.

I've never had a good Christmas, every year something has to happen to knock down my mood. Someone has to be shitty to me or angry at me or remind me of how I'm not really part of my extended family since my mom isolated us from them for so long. 

The only present I got this year was a new hairbrush I bought for myself since I'm rather broke."
Catswhoyell,fc3tvri,t1_fc3nuii,1577398506.0,"Double adoption is an excellent idea! You might even find a pair that is already bonded. It'll give your new friend someone to play and chill with when you're out and about. Also, you'll be giving another kitty a chance at a new life.

Don't think I'm not impressed though. I am absolutely shit at drawing faces. The best I can do is movement sketches and there are a lot of figure studies in my sketchbooks that are faceless for a reason. ;)"

TwoXChromosomes,fbx5028,t3_eeru5w,1577169605.0,"First of all, THANK YOU for doing what you do! Every time I've ever had to be in a hospital or with someone there, it was the nurses who made me feel safe and comfortable, assured me things were going to be taken care of, and went out of their way to be kind and sweet, even when (ESPECIALLY WHEN) everything around them was bedlam. Nurses are incredible people who work their asses off and get tons of respect from me. You're hardcore!

You handled the situation better than many would. You didn't panic, you moved to rapidly take action. Fortunately, it wasn't needed. Anyone would be shook up after, but you were strong when you needed it. You did a great job.

Maybe seeing how upset you were at the thought of something catastrophic happening to your husband is his wake up to better attend his health? Worked for a friend of mine whose collapse wasn't just a fall."
