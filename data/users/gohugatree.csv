But also try to exploit the skills that growing up as a JW gave you. Lots of ex- JWs are amazing sales people and great in public facing roles - years of telling the public about Jehovah has given you skills you might not realise. I talk at conferences and I think the ministry skills I gained as a teenager has given me a real advantage in public speaking. In job interviews I’ve mentioned those skills that I’ve gained from being taught to speak to the public at an early age, and people are fascinated that I’m ex-JW it makes me memorable.

In short- Morn your past, but don’t wallow in it. Celebrate your future, and exploit what you’ve learned and use it to your advantage.

Oh and have awesome birthdays and Christmases!"
