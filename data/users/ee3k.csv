have critical A&E for blood injuries,  serious illness and unconscious patients.

if a non serious patient shows up to hospital, send them to the other one.  have a nurse walking around the waiting room literally taking to everyone getting the basic information and questions asked in advance, give her an ipad and let her see if there are slots in the appropriate departments free in real time.

2 reasons: 

if goods get dropped in Liverpool its kind of on the wrong side of the country and its cheaper to ship it over and reload it.

remember these huge ships are slow moving, and having to circle from scotland's border down to london, might add days after crossing the atlantic. better to pull into the closest available port and use faster, smaller ships that go directly to the intended country even if you have to pay a little to get them sorted.

 with the Uk, they use more of a mix of truck and rail transport, but if the shipment is larger than 3 containers, rail is cheaper.

london/edinbourogh transfers just get stuck on the back of passenger trains, that would run anyway, so its more cost effective.

and the other reason is the channel tunnel.

the chunnel is so much FASTER than shipping its worth the extra cost in many cases. 

so they unload somewhere, load it onto a train that goes directly to the chunnel and there's minimal delay before its in europe. 


you can usually see the freight trains run when theres no passenger runs scheduled for about 40 minutes on a line, so while you can see them during the day, they are WAY more common at night:

as for financial services, frankfurt and Paris have had heavy investment in communications networks, city central housing and offices built to support bankers/brokers moving to those cities, out of national coffers (well, public/private partnerships), whereas we did nothing. 

the french and german governemnts had policies in place to try and ""capture"" some of the UKs business if it needs to relocate, and spent to support that.

Me arse. we could have had NO government in place at all for years, like in the north, and the same thing would have happened.

they dont get credit for ""being too incompetent to actually do anything""

 > Last time FF were in power I had to emigrate

wait, if you are not currently in Ireland , that might explain things. 

The ""full employment"" thing is a lie, huge amounts of people are on contracts that give them 3-5 hours a week work and no protections or benefits.  rents have close to tripled in many areas with no corresponding raise in wages, and even if you move to the middle of no-where, you are paying enough that saving for your own place is hard.

homelessness is through the roof, most middle size towns have 5-10 homeless people with cities having between dozens and a few hundred. 

services have been slashed to give tax breaks to incomes above 70K so most people dont even see the benefit of all these policies. 

Direct provision is shaping up to be the magdaline laundries of our generation, with prison like conditions and 2-3 deaths a week being reported, usually from people killing themselves when told they are being returned to the place they fled from. the center they are closing in limerick was a building with broken windows, bare damp stone walls, build for maybe 30 apartments back in the 1800s but housing over 200 on bunkbeds, 6 to a (small) room, 8 people died from respiratory ailments last year. 

its just bad here right now."

and I'd strongly argue, that with brexit on the cards they fumbled the opportunity in a big way.

we could have replaced the UK shipping ports , english language service industry and commodities markets but they gave NO support whatsoever to making that happen.
