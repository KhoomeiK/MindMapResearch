Fun fact, the definition of sex was changed because of Bill Clinton.  Prior to his impeachment, many definitions of sex required the person to have contact with the other persons genitalia.  Since one receiving a blowjob does not contact the other persons genitalia, the definition would make giving a blowjob counts as sex, but receiving does not.

MP5,fenrjxy,t1_fenmkvc,1579289717.0,">Which locking piece is required for unsuppressed 10mm? Unless you mean that most off the shelf 10mm is underpowered?

The initial loadings of 10mm are extremely hot.  It caused more rapid wear in many pistol designs, as well as the added recoil makes it harder for rapid follow up shots.  As a result the FBI created a less powerful load that was easier to shoot.  Most commercial loads are to the FBI spec and not the original spec.  You need a 60 degree locking piece for the original loads, but a 90 degree locking piece if using the FBI spec loads.  The FBI load also didn't need the case the size that it was, so 40 S&W was the 10mm FBI load without the empty case space so that it could fit in smaller grips.

The added pressure from using a suppressor often makes the 60 degree locking piece needed even with the lower pressure loads."
MP5,feni97d,t1_femtw79,1579285265.0,">“I’m surprised you didn’t get a jam every 5-6 rounds”

If you use the 60 degree locking piece with most 10mm ammo on the shelf it will most certainly do this.  Because using high pressure ammo with a 90 degree locking piece will damage the gun over time, people tend to only use the 60 degree locking piece, which needs the higher pressure 10mm loads to work right (unless running suppressed, in which case use the high pressure (60 degree) locking piece).  

&#x200B;

The MP5/10 is far more reliant on the end user knowing what they are doing than the standard MP5 is.  Funny enough, the ones in 40 are the same wa, requiring an 80 degree locking piece to work right with higher pressure loads.  It is kinda like how running the MP5k suppressed with subs requires a different locking piece, the gun is designed to work with a range of ammo, but once outside of that the locking piece must be changed to keep the amount of pressure applied to the bolt at the right level, as not enough delay causes the bolt to slam into the back of the receiver to hard and damages it, and too little pressure leads to cycling issues."
MP5,femmlue,t3_epsd8x,1579262731.0,"Honest answer, no one knows how accurate the initial complaint was.  It was made after the FBI had already transitioned to 40 S&W for their sidearm, and the rest of the FBI contract was done in 40.  Different 10mm loads require different locking pieces, so that could have also been the issue.  HRT supposedly liked the 10mm version enough to try and order more of them after the FBI had HK switch the contract to 40 and HK supposedly lost their shit over it and refused to make the mp5 in anything other than 9mm after that.  Or that is the story at least.  

If you use the right locking piece it should work fine, but if you use the wrong one the gun will either short cycle or beat itself apart."

Do you have a source for that?  I found a study from [2009 in California ](https://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/publications/Firearms_Report_09.pdf)  that states that it was actually 9mm that was used most often by a good bit.  Another study where some guy on the Internet [tried to track gun deaths](https://www.buckeyefirearms.org/handgun-stopping-power) came to a similar conclusion, though his methods are more apt for error due to a lack of access to the raw data. 

According to the FBI [692 ](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-11.xls) people were killed in 2017 by the assailants hands, feet, fists, etc, while extrapolating from California’s data (I know that it isn’t necessarily the most accurate way to get data) there would have been roughly 2152 deaths from .22 cal guns. So you are roughly 3x more likely to die from being shot by a 22 than being punched to death.  So both of you are wrong and the truth is somewhat in the middle.  .22 might deliver a similar amount of energy as a punch, but the smaller area where that energy is focused makes it more dangerous than a punch."

After 9/11 happened the people who had common allies with us (Saudi Arabia and Pakistan) were friendly with those who we were fighting, and those who were fighting our enemy were allied with someone who we had a rather frosty relationship with (Iran).

The sad thing is, a war with Saudi Arabia would be a far less risky endeavor than a war with Iran,  but these decisions are being made by what is advantageous to those in charge first and foremost.  Like how a war with Iran would likely see gas prices go up, allowing for crude oil that has been stored since the last oil price spike to be sold and used at a profit instead of a loss.

But that only works if everyone else gets the vaccine.  Once a group stops vaccinating, the risk of the disease returning is much higher and the risk of the disease mutating to make the vaccine no longer effective also goes up.  Initially the anti-vaxxers used the high rate of vaccinations as proof that when one person doesn't get vaccinated nothing happens.  Now that it is a movement and we are seeing groups of people not vaccinated, we are seeing a comeback of the diseases, but since there is a delay between the time most are vaccinated and when people start catching the disease, people don't connect the two (kinda like if you find evidence that your dog went through the garbage and hid some trash, punishing them then does no good because the dog won't connect stealing the trash with getting in trouble).
