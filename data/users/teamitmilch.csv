mildlyinteresting,feumuuj,t3_eqm7nr,1579388013.0,Ah. So THIS creepy thing is why dentists think I’m capable of unhinging my jaw and opening my mouth 10 inches wide for hours on end. Now I know who to blame.

berlin,fe1jn56,t1_fdjntvr,1578827357.0,"This is actually really helpful thank you. I didn’t know that I should burn with wood first after an extended absence of use. I was just throwing in coal once the fire was going in an effort to get my flat warm again.... 
could you elaborate on what you mean by closing the doors in the wrong order?"
berlin,fdn9thg,t1_fdeo25x,1578581068.0,No worries. I appreciate the concern! I was concerned as well haha I’ve let my landlord know and bought a CO detector to be safe.

berlin,fddztkz,t3_cfx68h,1578327942.0,"COAL STOVE HEATER: does anyone else have one of these things? A few months ago I moved into an Altbau with a coal stove heating system, and since October that’s how I’ve been heating my flat without any problems. 
However this week, after coming back from a 3 week holiday, I’ve noticed my stove isn’t venting as well as it did before. The air in my flat smells like smoke constantly (even with the window open) and whenever I open the grate to stoke the flames a decent amount of smoke comes spilling into the room (enough to set off the smoke alarm). 
Does anyone have any advice? My landlord is out of town and I’d really like to get my stove checked out ASAP as the smell is making me nervous. Is there a cleaning tool I should purchase? Or someone I could call? Any advice is appreciated."
memes,f9u44gj,t1_f9tyjpn,1575644024.0,"Well when you say it like THAT it sounds gross. But actually they use water to clean after pooping. To them the concept of wiping off shit with a piece of paper is gross. You wouldn’t clean poop off your shoe with just some tissue and then consider it clean, so why do that with your butt? And I see the argument. My bf is Iranian and after living with him for a few months I finally asked why he had some weird kettle thing next to his toilet and he said “to clean my asshole obviously!” Haha"
