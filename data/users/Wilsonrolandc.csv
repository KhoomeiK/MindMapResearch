wholesomememes,fdhxa57,t1_fdhtd4b,1578431830.0,"I'd honestly rather just have a proper sequel or spiritual successor.  After awhile the Kingdom Hearts games started to get on my nerves with how needlessly convoluted the stories were. Couple that with flat occasionally annoying non-disney or final fantasy characters, and not even the genuinely awesome combat mechanics can get me through some of the later games in the series. (Note: I do still love the first two games, as well as chain of memories and birth by sleep.)"
