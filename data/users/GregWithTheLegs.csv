Hatfilms,ffwdpkx,t3_ev96no,1580296933.0,God I fucking love the grand tour.
interestingasfuck,ffwdo5u,t1_ffvleop,1580296883.0,Is it like a freshly unwrapped newspaper? Or a paper fresh out here photocopier?
australia,ffwdjhw,t3_evinct,1580296719.0,Your mailbox looks like a McDonald's garbage bin. It's fantastic.
engineering,ffwd7r3,t3_evgihz,1580296292.0,"No one's perfect. It doesn't matter if you do something wrong as long as you take it as a learning experience. Sometimes things take more than one lesson to learn and that's fine, so long as you recognise that you are improving upon yourself each time."
carporn,ffw9r8s,t1_ffw5l6l,1580291359.0,99% of the time I would agree but it kind of fits the aesthetics of the rest of this car. I reckon they'd look better if they were spinning.
TheMonkeysPaw,ffw9idg,t3_evih36,1580290980.0,I don't like this one. I'm uncomfortable.
ExtremeCarCrashes,ffw9ez9,t1_ffvpmkh,1580290839.0,I feel like standing directly behind a guardrail test is like being a test dummy to see if a bulletproof vest works.
HumansBeingBros,ffw87dp,t1_ffvza3p,1580289033.0,"I'm a swimming teacher for young children. I remember I couldn't get leave on my birthday last year for a Sunday morning shift. Sunday shifts are gruelling, 6 hours in the pool with pretty much no break because you only get half an hour off which you spend wet and cold. After one of my kids (6 yo) found out it was my birthday, she came back with her mum after my shift ended with a slice of birthday cake. Easily the best cake I've ever had."
ATBGE,ffvcudk,t1_ffv7x56,1580261116.0,It would take longer to render this than it would to actually build it.
interestingasfuck,ffvcg4r,t1_ffutztx,1580260852.0,They're a bike with a motor. Motorbike.
AnimalsBeingBros,fftok5l,t1_ffto97q,1580225683.0,"Yes, I'm sure the handler wanted their dog to die. Did you hike 300 miles through the scene of a natural disaster with very limited access to resources while also saving lives and finding bodies?"
AnimalsBeingBros,ffto9h0,t1_fftnnkf,1580225494.0,"Yep. The dog suffered heatstroke and they just left him there on the ground. I'm sure that's how it went. Do you know how valuable those dogs are, not just emotionally but financially? That dog would have received THE BEST medical care possible. They could spend $10,000 on medical treatment and it would still be cheaper than the years of expert handling it takes to train each dog. The picture in the post shows the dog with a breathing apparatus and an IV drip. Those handlers would treat their dog better than they would their own damn kids."
HumansBeingBros,fftnp6q,t1_fftn5gf,1580225127.0,"Each mask comes in a sealed, individual plastic package. Tampering would be noticeable. 

Why is everyone so hellbent on the idea that this guy was out to kill people?"
AnimalsBeingBros,fftnjy5,t1_fftn2fj,1580225028.0,"The dog was there under the intention that it was going to be worked hard. Heat stroke was always going to be something in the mind of the handler. If the dog suffered heatstroke, there was a 95% chance that with some water and rest, the dog would be perfectly fine. That was a risk they had to take with how crucial dogs can be at finding victims in a natural disaster. The handler could never have expected his dog to have a massive heart attack."
HumansBeingBros,fftmzw8,t1_fftml8f,1580224654.0,"I think people generally like to have a good pisstake when uber-Americans unleash their 'greatest country on earth' spiel but the anti-sino hatred surrounding Hong Kong and the Uyghurs has been unreal. People can shit on the Chinese government, that's justified but people who shit on the entire Chinese nationality have been receiving an unfortunate amount of support recently. That's from a Chinese guys perspective at least."
AnimalsBeingBros,fftmni7,t1_fftm4se,1580224419.0,Agreed. You can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink. It's hard to put the entire blame on the handler here. Dogs from K9 units live some of the best lives too.
AnimalsBeingBros,fftmg9o,t1_fftlbr0,1580224280.0,"I imagine everyone gets pushed to the brink in a natural disaster and 95% of the time, collapsing from heat stroke is very survivable. I doubt the handler was doing too much better himself."
HumansBeingBros,fftm1q3,t1_fftlisl,1580223999.0,"With the number of cameras in china, the police could watch him all the way to his front door. Privacy issues aside, there's no getting away with crime in China."
HumansBeingBros,fftl9y5,t1_fftkycf,1580223458.0,"As a Chinese dude, I salute you."
AnimalsBeingBros,fftl0ug,t1_fftjkqv,1580223279.0,I believe this article is (half) incorrect. The dog was suffering from heatstroke when he suffered a massive heart attack and his respiratory system failed. K9 handlers are incredibly attached to their pups and I seriously doubt a handler would just 'work them to death'.
MechanicalKeyboards,fftk8hv,t1_fftdgvr,1580222719.0,That's 3.65 keys per dollar. That's bonkers cheap.
HumansBeingBros,fftk3z3,t1_fftfxp6,1580222629.0,"In a country of 1.4 billion, there's no feasible way of getting higher quality masks to the masses. Those masks do the job in blocking things from getting to your mouth."
HumansBeingBros,fftjywp,t1_fftgpbr,1580222526.0,It's China. There are so many cameras in the streets that the police could track him all the way to his house if it was something sinister.
HumansBeingBros,fftjsea,t1_fftdg2s,1580222396.0,Masks don't weigh much. If it was something sinister it probably would have made more of a thunk when it hit the counter. Plus sharing masks has become a big thing in China. People are really banding together.
HumansBeingBros,fftjl82,t1_ffthgtl,1580222250.0,You are a brave soul to take on the Americans of Reddit.
carporn,fftj81q,t1_ffti0i7,1580221976.0,I think if the roof was a little bit flatter it could look a little bit r35 GTR-esque. And that's a good thing.
OldSchoolCool,fftcprw,t1_fftccv5,1580216596.0,I just got the satisfying image of an officer standing next to this thing trying to work out how to boot it.
mildlyinteresting,fftcmhz,t1_ffsxtaf,1580216510.0,Sounds like a job for after hours.
OldSchoolCool,fftbnec,t1_fftbm4r,1580215590.0,My condolences.
OldSchoolCool,fftb88y,t1_fft8rta,1580215178.0,Thats 1 litre of petrol every 2 kilometres for the non-yeehaw folks.
OldSchoolCool,fft7tje,t1_fft04wf,1580211368.0,You could Austin Powers it on an airport runway.
