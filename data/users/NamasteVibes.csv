AskReddit,ffe68f4,t3_et4i2o,1579837788.0,"First date with a guy I liked a few years ago was at mcdonalds. Such a sweet dude. We broke up over religious differences. He was Muslim and I couldn’t and wouldn’t convert and we needed that for his family to allow us to get serious and get married. We still remain good friends though. About a year after that went on a date with a dude who was older and “rich”. Guy had a driver and spent like about $400 on our meal which was like tiny portions of usual fancy stuff. It was such an uncool date that I didn’t pursue the potential relationship further. 

Money doesn’t make a great date. You do. Also anyone expecting you to pay x amount is probably not something you want to invest in."

TrueOffMyChest,ffe55bm,t3_et4ia8,1579836962.0,"Normal. Im a black female who hated black males after a black male shot my dad. (My dad is fine) It became an issue of “black males are just useless criminals who rather do crime than get a job”. This was irrational because my brothers are all very successful professionals and two of them are entrepreneurs so I had a close group of black males who are not that. But i still felt that. I think it was the anger and fear brought on my that unnamed black man who I didn’t know so every black guy I didn’t know became a potential criminal and id just avoid, close windows when driving past etc etc. 

Thing is you eventually get over the matter and normalize. Then you go one step further and start to feel a type of pity for the person who did something wrong to you and eventually you forget that you used to hate a whole group of people over an incident perpetrated by one individual. 

One thing thats never left me thought is hyper vigilance. Like theres a part of your brain thats hyper vigilant after that and Im mot sure I can turn that off or if its even beneficial. You kinda want to “prevent something like that from happening again”."

She clearly tried to climb something to get to the maple syrup, and dropped or tipped something over. Who hasn’t done this in their lives. I remember I climbed up our semi circle shaped grocery cupboard as a kid but the shelves were adjustable so as i got higher I kicked out the bottom shelf, along with oils, sugars and other stuff... and I was too afraid to come down. I screamed for help and My mum carried me down and I helped her clean it because I mind messed up. She said next time I should try a chair or get an adult to help."

TrueOffMyChest,feoy56j,t1_feovyg5,1579307924.0,"O let me clarify my mum is still alive because she is obviously able to resurrect herself at this point. I don’t even know what to call it. She just defies the odds all the time. 

But on your point I get it and I hope you guys can find a solution because honestly the issue wont take care of itself but your energy can kind of deteriorate over time so maybe talk to your dad and sister and anyone else who can help and just figure out some sort of family understanding on how to deal with these matters. Its easier to do that when everyone is clear minded than to try figure stiff out in the middle of a potential emergency."
TrueOffMyChest,feotyr1,t3_eq7oja,1579305463.0,"I kinda get what you mean but for me it was different. My mum was actually sick and dying and she honestly defied death multiple times. And I mean in ICU flatlined type stuff. One day the doctors called me around 2am telling me my mum probably wont make it to the hospital and I said something like “its ok doctor, Im not coming, Im tired, Il be there in the morning. Lets just leave her in Gods hands.” 

Everyone was taken aback when I arrived later that morning because they said it sounded like I didn’t care. I told them I care and have cared since I was a child and it’s exhausting to carry that weight with you for years and years. I dont want my mum to die, not till she is like 100 or something. But honestly living with a sick parent drains your soul and you need a mental, physical a d spiritual break from time to time. 

I know its not the same as your circumstances but I know how sometimes you just need a minute away to breathe. 

Speak to your father about getting her professional care even if its for a short while. I find its easier to care for others when you don’t feel depleted yourself, otherwise you grow resentful. Thats where you’re headed and its a toxic place that you will regret when your mum is gone so rather find ways to balance the demand placed on you by getting extra help. You really shouldn’t carry this all the time if it’s breaking you in this way."

I love my mum but she is overbearing and even when she see’s you don’t want to discuss something she pushes. I find that rude but because she is the parent calling her pit for being rude is not acceptable. 

Issues like these aren’t about people being “salty” as you say. Its real thing that affect relationships and sometimes end the closeness in otherwise good parent child relationships. My mum is amazing and I love her but I keep private life at arms length because any closeness results in her doing a deep dive.

Eg you can advertise make up to me al day every day, Im super receptive and actually am affected by such ads and make buying decisions based on such ads. 

However I work in the financial services industry and I get a lot of ads for finserv type products. I scroll so quickly because while I work there I don’t buy low level financial products, I create them etc - and given the option I would say sure serve me ads on anything related to beauty, health, movies, spirituality, christianity etc but Id also say block banking, insurance and related ads. I generally ignore those anyway.

rant,fd79gvj,t1_fd5suy9,1578201181.0,"I am black & not American but my experience of other black people is nothing like yours. I also like hiphop but not all the time. I probably have above average intelligence (I’m guessing so please don’t quote me),I speak multiple languages, I try give to different communities, Im well educated and keep on adding new professional qualifications to my name, I mentor a couple people and im still relatively young etc ( full disclosure, I am where and who I am because my parents invested everything they had in their kids when we were young and we got more financially comfortable as time went on so they’ve also funded or enabled alot of my “accomplishments” ). So your points about the majority black people you meet is clearly driven from your interactions within your community. Thats a small group of people. 

If i were to judge black people by looking at some of the people I know from the hood etc id feel like you because of the lack of resources and the socialization that happens in impoverished areas. That’s actually pretty normal. However most of the black people in my circle either escaped the hood or were never even in the hood and that creates a whole other type of african person. Almost all are incredibly accomplished, most are science or finance grads and are financially well off, a couple are already at a board level in large companies and some are self made millionaires in business. Because of that my view of black people is that they are aspirational because they challenge me to be better, they inspire me and most stuck by me when I was suffering from a bout of depression and stopped being social etc. These are people who are beautiful inside and out. But that’s because my circle is specific to my own personal circumstances. So to me black people are intense about their careers and they are mostly good people and they are worldly/well travelled and just overall great. I don’t see a difference between my white/non black friends and my black friends. Its like we chose each other partly because we agree with each others values (ambition, family, excellence). 

So when reading your post I immediately understood that your issue is not black people per se, its your views about your immediate community of black people. Thats why I think you need diversity within your personal community and maybe that means stepping out of your immediate community. You need friends who challenge you and improve you. I also believe you need to be a person like that and then also look to associate and build relationships with people like that. We all struggle in some way and are our own challenges. In principle you are correct when you say black people are their own biggest challenge, thats true for all races though. Once you as a person decides something no one can stop you, so yeah we each kinda need to climb our mountain. 

On the celibacy thing I’d say slow down. You can be celibate but take it one season at a time. Celibacy has its benefits but it also has its drawbacks and the only way to to avoid the drawbacks is to know when to put it away and pursue meaningful relationships. I hope I made some sense. Im incredibly sleepy."
rant,fd5jpzn,t3_ek3q8r,1578178338.0,"Im sorry you have had such traumatizing experiences with black people in your immediate community. Take heart in knowing that black people are a lot more diverse in beliefs, behavior and musical preferences than what you are currently dealing with. Your experiences will improve as your diversity even within the black community improves. 

When you do encounter a black person who embodies the stereotype that you kind of outlined, be kind. Most people are a product of their environment and are conditioned to reflect it so obviously what they reflect isnt always good. Thats just life. 

Try not bunch all black people together even within the context of the African American community at large. Find people who float your boat. They may be within the black community they may be outside. It doesn’t matter. I think being celibate is a great choice and it’s something I did for a long time but for more religious reasons.

On a more philosophical note allow me to leave you with a concept i have found to be true for all races - each one of us is our own biggest challenge. Be the beautiful person you wish you got to interact with. That would be the best gift you can give your community and yourself."

awfuleverything,fd3dthd,t1_fd3cqi3,1578157330.0,Calm down gran. What she did feels unhygienic over and above being gross. I wouldn’t want those germs in my mouth. I don’t mind dogs licking us like thats what they do. Sucking on a dog’s tongue is just begging for some random infection. Why you always gotta jump to the worst possible conclusion. Chill.

AskReddit,fd1f2sd,t3_ejulwt,1578130670.0,"Hopefully zero because anyone who actually believes there will be a ww3 because of this issue with Iran is delusional. Iran cant afford a war, not when they are fighting to maintain the current system and killing protesting citizens in the process. Iran is in a very delicate position internally and a war would almost seal the deal on a national scale political coup. 

If you checked the press release issued by the Iranian President this morning you will notice that he said they will get back at the US in their own way. Its his way of saying not now and definitely not a world war. 

Could they try escalate terrorism in US spaces, yes, other forms of crimes like espionage and cyber crimes and also do the same in neighboring and US allied countries- absolutely. Will there be war, a world war at that... no. 

I understand why US citizens are scared of war but theres no scenario where that is feasible on Irans part and they know it."

Maybe the criteria should not be income but something else. But I do agree that we need to keep private money out of politics."
