suns,ffh8dgw,t1_ffehbv4,1579926033.0,"CP3? I’m not disagreeing with you, but why do you think he should be in it? I checked his stats and he is having a good season but nothing spectacular."
suns,ffh7zlj,t1_ffh73ct,1579925707.0,Tim Donaghy’s reveals are legit. No conspiracy here.
nba,ffc61ga,t1_ffbck3s,1579792362.0,Is this a copy pasta??
Bitcoin,ffbd6vk,t1_ffb7y7o,1579760378.0,"Yeah this is what I’ve learned from this post unfortunately. But also, thank you for not being harsh and giving me some info. (Specifically checking the denomination, I didn’t know that yet.)"

Bitcoin,ffa7z7e,t1_ffa7asa,1579729652.0,I’ll check it out!
Bitcoin,ffa77z7,t1_ffa6yii,1579729230.0,Yeah I’m definitely still going to check but I already gave her a heads up that it’s most likely just a novelty.
Bitcoin,ffa6h3n,t1_ffa5xbd,1579728817.0,"Ooooo this is even more interesting! And wow, I had no idea that ICE owned Bakkt. I had to look this up to confirm this because I couldn’t believe it."
Bitcoin,ffa57zr,t1_ffa50tv,1579728123.0,"Alright this is enough for me to get started at least! I do know some banks and firms have been looking into creating their own currencies, specifically Goldman and BoA."
Bitcoin,ffa4u0v,t1_ffa48yv,1579727905.0,I’m curious enough to look into it. Do you have any sources I can start out with though? I’m specifically referring to the banks secretly already being involved in crypto.
Bitcoin,ffa47t5,t1_ffa43mg,1579727556.0,Yeah I’m thinking you are right. I’m still going to check though!
Bitcoin,ffa3y94,t1_ffa3nvb,1579727407.0,Okay now I’m more curious. Do you have any credible sources on the banks already getting involved but in secret
Bitcoin,ffa3mgv,t1_ffa3j1w,1579727220.0,"Well fuck, really??  If that’s the case then it would just be a novelty coin then?"
Bitcoin,ffa2wv7,t1_ffa2j1y,1579726811.0,"As soon as a large American bank gets onboard with crypto i’ll join the club. Until then my strong bear mentality will hold me back, for better or worse."

Bitcoin,ffa1uh2,t1_ffa1l5f,1579726196.0,"This may be the case unfortunately. I’m still skeptical as well, that’s why I asked her to bring me it with any info she has on it. Maybe I should have waited to make this post. But thank you, now I know what will be the first thing I check!"
Bitcoin,ffa0qd9,t1_ffa0d01,1579725545.0,"This is honestly what I was thinking! But then she 
mentioned she had a wallet already so I thought maybe it’s actually legit. Also she said she bought it in 2012... how she went about it, I have no idea. I’ve asked to bring the physical coin and any information she has including where she has that online wallet and what not. 

I figured it might be worth a shot to at least check, because what if it is real..."
modernwarfare,ffa0cck,t1_ff9wuu9,1579725318.0,"Why not both? They could give us some points just by playing and allow us to spend it on loot boxes. But do not allow lootboxes to be purchased with real money because that’s legitimate gambling which I’m not okay with especially considering you have such a young demographic playing the games. And if people want to spend money on a specific bundle, then allow them."

modernwarfare,ff9gcne,t1_ff93tvc,1579712423.0,"Join the club, no but for reals. The best way I found to decrease my “current skill” is by hip firing a whole match or two. It might just be me but when I spray and pray and hit 1/100 shots I immediately get placed into a lower-skilled lobby. Unlike if I just try to have a really negative K/D."
modernwarfare,ff9fvtq,t3_es9jh7,1579712138.0,Holy reverse boost (intentional or not.) I get into these kinds of lobbies too when I go for the hip-fire challenges. The difference is insane and just reminds how much I dislike SBMM.

suns,ff8i5ds,t3_eruyki,1579679560.0,"KO's defense is better than Gordon's offense IMO. And I feel that we lack offense more than defense, but again, just my opinion."

modernwarfare,ff69ufj,t3_erqraw,1579622497.0,If It wasn’t for the SBMM this call of duty might be tied for my second favorite cod of all time.
modernwarfare,ff4dtd6,t3_erdcjj,1579561243.0,"I experience this in Gunfight on the Atrium map, with some guns. The glare isn’t as bad as in this video, but it’s definitely enough to block visibility and distract the person."
nba,ff4dl8d,t1_ff3k3uv,1579561093.0,"Let me be as clear as possible, I am not making any excuses for the drunk driver and your statement is correct. If you are actually addicted you definitely disregard other people. But a majority of the addicts I’ve met want to quit but don’t have the support they need. 

So yes, I believe that this drunk driver needs to face harsh penalties. But at the same time, I see this as an opportunity to remind people that in the US, addicts are treated like criminals when in reality most of them are suffering from major depression and trying to escape reality. This is one of the most significant health/political issues that has yet to be addressed accordingly. 

Again, I am making zero excuses for that drunk driver. If that was my child instead of Parsons in that car I would be going insane inside."

nba,ff3nwhg,t1_ff3nrvo,1579545079.0,"No, but he is relating his treatment from bball fans to MLK’s treatment."
nba,ff3ktwi,t1_ff3glal,1579543182.0,"I had the opposite reaction, I clicked on this expecting people to be way overblowing this but he really said that. In my opinion, this really shows Kyrie’s lack of understanding to just how insignificant a professional athlete is in the grand scheme of things. You don’t equate your treatment to MLK’s treatment. To me, Kyrie seems like a 13yo girl complaining about gossip in middle school."

suns,ff3i9az,t3_eqzjl4,1579541610.0,What am I supposed to be looking at? Is it not just a standard rendition of a Celtics' court? Or is there a hidden joke in there that I'm missing?

suns,ff3h589,t3_eretg1,1579540923.0,"Hey I really like your website's design! Looks really clean and professional. I also read the article, very solid writing. Now, just a suggestion which you have every right to completely disregard so no worries, but have you considered slightly changing the format of the actual articles? I found it a little difficult to read on PC because of how long the lines were. (I'm not sure if I'm wording myself correctly.) Basically make the word format of the article taller but skinnier so each individual line is not as wide. 

Everything else is great! I especially liked the art/edits made."
suns,ff3g2yv,t1_ff39jwu,1579540322.0,"Magic fans (or at least their sub) have been discussing possible Aaron Gordon trades for a couple years now. They just want something equally as valuable in return. Magic fans aren't dumb, they know Gordon isn't who you want as your #1 player."

suns,feyunj9,t3_eqqh1e,1579450738.0,That fading shot he hit from the side with two guys’ hands in his face was something else. It felt like he was in the air for a solid couple seconds before he even let the ball go.

This does not happen in xbox party chat though - I can still hear my friends in the party even with my mic disconnected. So this issue is clearly on Call of Duty's side.
