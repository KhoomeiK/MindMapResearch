HumansBeingBros,ffamj1k,t3_eshfg8,1579739439.0,Please stop reposting this. This is not how you perform CPR on a dog (or person for that matter.) The video is misleading; please don’t think this type or rate of compressions will actually help in an emergency.

AskDocs,ff704qa,t1_ff5z7by,1579638456.0,One of the possibilities is that your headaches are from eye strain. I’d get your eyes checked if you can afford it. Glasses (for people who need them) make a *world* of difference with headaches.

todayilearned,ff4kpfa,t1_fds7ia5,1579565957.0,"That’s what I was trying to describe, but didn’t have the descriptors for. I wish companies would make the switch. Hour+ boarding is just uncalled for."
Outlander,ff4kg71,t1_ff2ope3,1579565776.0,I’m from NE and only ever heard “ant” from non-new englanders. The fact that she was coached to mispronounce something just breaks the 4th wall for me

ScottishPeopleTwitter,fet97cg,t3_eqiy5o,1579372899.0,We have neither bouncers nor the fancy order boards. You fight to the front of the pack to order at the cashier with your gun and your eagle strapped to your back. Like a real patriot.
HomeschoolRecovery,fesdztk,t3_eqaggi,1579364210.0,"I don’t know if they would consider online public school as it most likely (hopefully) teaches evolution and sex ed, but I used to have a friend who taught at connections and it sounded pretty educationally solid. Maybe it’s an option.

AquaticAsFuck,fca9w1q,t1_fca95qv,1577565342.0,"To add to this, I believe this only applies if you don’t exhale when using the scuba equipment. 

I think what we’re all referring to is the answer to “why don’t free divers get compression sickness” which is- because they inhaled at sea level.

If they begin breathing compressed air, they just need to follow normal surfacing protocol.

But anyone with actual expertise, please weigh in."

AskDocs,fbzhu5y,t1_fbc40wy,1577247188.0,So these are rhythm strips (which only include certain leads [12 are usually obtained] and aren’t technically “diagnostic quality” per where I’ve worked) but what I’m seeing is just massive ischemia - fancy word for heart muscle being irritated and oxygen deprived. You could always re-post the image on this same subreddit and see if any cardiologists can pick up on additional issues.
AskUK,fbzhizw,t1_fbbpxf8,1577246891.0,"That’s so cool! I grew up in New England and watching the fishing/marine activity at the docks was always fascinating.
