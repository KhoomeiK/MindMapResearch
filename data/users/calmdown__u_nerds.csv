Bolivia is an example of a successful socialist country. Bolivia has drastically cut extreme poverty and has the highest GDP growth rate in South America.

Other countries which are not socialist that have adopted and enacted socialist ideas and policies, and have seen success in improving their societies by doing so, are Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Great Britain, Canada, the Netherlands, Spain, Ireland, Belgium, Switzerland,Australia, Japan, and New Zealand.
