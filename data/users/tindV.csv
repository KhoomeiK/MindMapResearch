Pandemic,ffe7wzk,t3_et43tu,1579839116.0,"They're probably trying to ""save face"" with China so China will continue to cooperate. The opposite being they declare an emergency and China gets all butthurt and defensive.

  
Although, just because they haven't declared it a global health emergency doesn't mean that they aren't taking it seriously."
epidemic,ffe5oe7,t1_ffe1okh,1579837363.0,"There's disposable and also reusable. On top of that, there's many types of disposable. Respirators, like vogmasks, are generally ""use them until they get clogged and harder to breath out of"". Vogmasks specifically says to replace it around 5-6 months of heavy use, or when it gets harder to breathe out of.

Of course the risk then becomes handling a possibly infected piece of cloth after a trip to the store. They recommend washing with water and a small amount of liquid soap.  Then wash your hands after handling. There's more to it, but my point is it still doesn't make you invulnerable at all.

I have no idea if any of this works, but it's certainly better than nothing. Generally it comes down to making sure you're washing your hands and but staying around sick people, just like the normal flu. The difference for me is I'd rather not get mucked up in this virus if I can help it, so I'm okay with wearing a mask."
epidemic,ffdkt2c,t3_eszyqb,1579822988.0,This is exactly why I'm not embarrassed to wear a mask out in big public places in a location that has not had a confirmed or suspected case. Who knows what kind of selfish morons are out there putting other people at risk. Yeesh.
singapore,ffddwig,t1_ffd1g2x,1579818830.0,"For me, it read more of ""Surgical masks are BETTER at protecting you from Wuhan, better than N95"". But then WAY later in the article it starts to read ""... because people don't know how to wear N95 properly"".

At first I was thinking ""How could a surgical mask protect better than N95? That contradicts everything from the last 18 years"". It totally makes sense to me that people will probably panic buy them and not wear them correctly, and so I can understand the argument of suggesting surgical masks instead. However the article seems to be trying to trick people into thinking a surgical mask will beat an N95 mask 100 times out of 100 on an even playing field, and I don't think that's very accurate. I may be mistaken, but that's what it read like to me!"
singapore,ffd0m5n,t1_ffcnng1,1579811072.0,"Thanks for your reply, that's what I figured as well. I have never run in to ST before, but it was odd to see an almost immediate article completely contradicting everything else I've seen/read."
singapore,ffcduu3,t3_esksjg,1579797332.0,Is this saying that you shouldn't use n95 masks because they don't protect against the virus? Or are they saying you shouldn't use n95 masks because people are idiots and won't wear it correctly?
nottheonion,ff49ihk,t3_ere6f9,1579558481.0,"To be fair, I know a lot of ways to kill people that I probably would've never known about without video games. Then again, you could say the same thing about movies."
AskReddit,feel00z,t3_eondj6,1579035882.0,"Up until recently, I've been drinking a 12 pack a day for 3-4 years. I work from home so I would drink all day, spaced out. It was fun for a while but definitely not worth it in the long run. The million dollars would be nice though."
aww,fdqku59,t1_fdoz41q,1578669089.0,"I think you're right that you need to be clean shaven to wear them (probably anywhere). I was thinking that it would be a lot less dangerous to not wear one in wildfire fighting as you would outdoors and typically in areas that you aren't battling the main fire. I would HOPE that if you had to bunker down and try to defend a home/property, they would have the gear available.

Maybe it's a lesser of two evils? Not using gear 90% of the time but they probably have it in their bags? Not sure how well it works with the beard though.

Either way, thanks for the reply!"
aww,fdqkjhj,t1_fdpa1vi,1578668894.0,That's so crazy. I was under the impression that wildfire fighting was typically done (as you mentioned) via back burn operations or through digging a line. I thought that this meant they were further away from most of the smoke or would otherwise be surrounded by better airflow by being outside. I'm definitely not an expert though. Thanks for the reply!
aww,fdotrck,t1_fdoq7gh,1578612682.0,"Most of the toxins from fighting fires in an urban area is from all of the burning materials releasing chemicals. That, and being inside of an enclosed space (a building) that's full of smoke.

&#x200B;

Fighting wildfires is usually done outside in an area (at least mostly) devoid of buildings. No need to worry about breathing in burning insulation when it's trees and bushes on fire."
AskReddit,fdk1kqf,t1_fdin49r,1578493780.0,"My girlfriend's parents tried to tell me to ""not allow my girlfriend to drive home at night because it's so dangerous"". We were in a long distance relationship at the time and it was a five hour drive for her to get home. It was also a trip we have both made over 100 times each. My girlfriend's parents are obviously just worried about her, but about normal daily things that people do all the time without issue.

They were pressing me to give them an answer like I was going to be their anxiety enforcer by proxy. I laughed and told them ""I won't let her do anything dumb or dangerous"". Fortunately my barrier of entry for ""dumb and dangerous"" things is way more reasonable than theirs.

Edit: not that she needs my permission anyways, but it made her parents feel better"
IAmA,fcutxz5,t1_fctg1lz,1577988428.0,"Hey, we are the same person! Thank you for asking this question on behalf of us.

edit: also, if you have any tips on steps I should take to help get my anxiety under control, please let me know. I know everyone is different, but my symptoms have appeared recently so everything is new. Waiting on doc appointments which take *so long* to come around."
hoggit,fcurz8l,t1_fcur13s,1577987303.0,"I do not use the foam pad at the back, although I've considered using it. The only thing I've done is set the tightness of the headset snug enough to stay in place, but still loose enough to take on and off without adjusting (as suggested by the instructions). I will put my headset and make sure it is snug, then pull it away from my face, angle it down a little bit, and then set it back. Typically it will stay there just fine, and give me the widest viewing angle I can manage. I'm not sure if it's the perfect way to set it up, but it lets me read everything I need to without having to move around. But I will be readjusting as needed throughout my flying.

Playing Dirt Rally 2.0 though, I put it on and angle it, then never have to touch it (less gauges to look at in weird angles I guess?)."
hoggit,fcupnw3,t1_fcu43x5,1577985992.0,"I did that too at first, but after every VR session I was feeling sick and the world looked really odd to me. Turns out my IPD was too low and I was going crosseyed while playing. Taking the VR headset off my eyes were trying to ""adjust"" for the corrected IPD and trying to go crosseyed slightly.

Remember that the ""sweet spot"" is not only controlled by IPD, it's also the angle of the headset. This is why I have to tilt my index downward while wearing it (further away from my forehead at the top, closer to my cheeks at the bottom) just slightly enough."
hoggit,fcpmhvu,t1_fcpje20,1577867516.0,"Get the ipd set up correctly for your eyes. I just used a cloth measure tape used for sewing since we have one. Measure the distance from pupil to pupil, and adjust it in your car headset. I have the valve index and my ipd is 63.5mm.

For me with the index specifically, I need to angle the headset down when I'm wearing it to make the picture more clear. As in tilt the headset towards the floor just ever so slightly while I'm wearing it. Ymmv"
