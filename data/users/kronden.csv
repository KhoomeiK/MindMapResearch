todayilearned,ff15cxf,t1_ff0wuzy,1579475387.0,It was totally before Wi-Fi. Trust me.
todayilearned,ff147dm,t1_ff006zj,1579475068.0,"So you were working in the Herndon, VA. office at the time? Because it wasn't Ogden, or Tuscon office, let alone the Jacksonville office, because after one year they started to close them down."

politics,fetlaxd,t1_feslus0,1579376523.0,"Funny, if you knew this person over 25 years, you would have known when he was going to be a dick about something. You assume what people think and project yourself onto others. That is why you were pissed off at your friend and how pissed off you are towards others in the world. As for me, I know people couldn't care if I existed, because they have their own issues, problems, and other shit in their life that is consuming them and they are struggling to get through. The difference between you and I, is I acknowledge the fact, and I recognize the flaw in everyone, including myself. 

Your friend was a dick for what he said, but you might tell him how much it really affected you and how you do project what had happened to you and think about others that might go through your same plight. Maybe then he won't be a big of a dick people, because he thinks of you as a friend of 25 years and still reaches out to you. You were friends for over 25 years, not casual acquaintances."
politics,fesidc4,t1_fes4lcx,1579365477.0,"It's one of the reasons why you never talk politics with friends. I have friends who are way out in left or right field, even for myself. I let them say their piece, its what they believe and I respect them for that. Outside of politics, everything else is great for a friendship."
WinStupidPrizes,fdlwcuk,t3_elz1yz,1578534080.0,"""I have singed my asshole closed, forgive my intentions, the surgery will include ripping me a new asshole, and a colostomy bag for being a dumbass.  And for those interested, your first name better be ""colostomy tube"" because giving you access to my ass better be covered by my insurance or I will shit on you. 

Yes I am going to hell with this ironic diatribe, but fuck it, but not this dude's asshole, because its singed shut."
movies,fdlvwj5,t3_cuwgtc,1578533764.0,"Here is the thing, know how he was with Jon Snow during Game of Thrones, now understanding that he will play the Black Knight in the Eternals, and knowing his character will play in Excalibur, because holy shit, if you are a marvel fan boi, he does fit for the part. Considering his acting abilities (there have been some films that have been questionable on his range) this is one of the roles that I feel he would be suitable for, and I hope the script writers nail it, knowing the actors that were hired and how they can work a story line around them."
technology,fdawwyw,t1_fd9aobo,1578251338.0,"Da fuq? But then again, I have seen in hospitals here in the U.S. are still using Windows 7 and Vista and have yet to upgrade due to archaic software programs that may no longer have support."
