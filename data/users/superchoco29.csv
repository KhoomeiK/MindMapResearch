>!At the moment, in the webtoon, I can't say. He's definitely fast enough to leave afterimages, and his skill Dash allows him to increase it even further. Later when he gets the you-know-what and becomes you-know-who his speed increases vastly, so much that he perceives the world as still. We see him see the javelin thrown at him by the Ice elf (which one can assume being way faster than any bullet) as almost completely still, and has the ability to observe everything, and think about stuff, before easily stopping it. So if he is as fast as his sensory percetion, he would be already among the fastest things on Earth. After we see him using his speed, amd still feeling that his senses weren't fast enough, so he relied simply on instinct. So the movement of his hands is faster than what we just thought. Also, if I don't remember wrongly, when he chases the Beast king, he doesn't use his Shadow Exchange, so we see him go in the blink of an eye from Korea to somewhere deep in a forest on the other side of the world. So yeah, pretty fast. I'd say at the very minimum 10 times the speed of sound, without his Dash ability. With that, I can only speculate, but I'd say a maximum of 100 times the speed of sound...!<"

We have seen pur boy resist to many times more than a simple gunshot, from stabs, to slashes, to lightnings, to firebeams, to explosions, to much more. And shit is about to get crazier. So a simple gun wouldn't do anything to him (he probably could take the bullet in mid air). About the other hunters, it depends. Mages are usially weakin defense, so even an A-rank mage could get harmed by a gunshot. Tanks probably wouldn't get a scratch. S-Ranks are basically all safe. Simply, if you want to kill them, you need heavy artillery. They are people magically upgraded to fight monsters capable of tearing buildings apart.
