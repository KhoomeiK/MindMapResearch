powerbuilding,ffgtep2,t3_etamd7,1579914589.0,"I have a couple of chronic lower back injuries (arthritic facet joint at L5/S1 and a compression fractured L2, the first causes more pain) and I wear a belt on things that bother it. For days I work legs (for DL and squat ALWAYS) my warmups are:

10 bird dogs, then hold left arm/right leg out for 10 seconds and then the other sides

30 second plank on the left, rest 5, 30 center, 5, 30 right

30 second glute bridge (static hold at top position) - do a stomach vacuum with this, you'll really feel it in your lower back

This is one to work up to: one legged glute bridges - straighten one leg for a couple seconds then the other for ten reps total (5 each). At the end I do the 10 second holds with each leg like the bird dogs. Don’t do these til you’re strong with the static hold glute bridge. 

I learned these from a good PT and have done them for years. I think anyone could benefit from these, they’ll strengthen your core and lower back which is an area a lot of people are lacking in. I never really tweak my back at the gym anymore, the worst aggravations for me come from stupid shit like soft couches.

I think it’s important to recognize the appetite aspect of weight gain/loss, personally I’d be 150-160 if I just ate when I was hungry (5’9”, 190, 14%BF via dexa). Being seriously hungry clouds the hell out of your judgment so a huge part of weight loss is being able to plan and manage those times."

Documentaries,fcoowx6,t1_fcojhht,1577837698.0,"You keep making the point that they’re scumbags. I’m not denying that they are scumbags, or that they have incentives to do shady shit, but doing shady shit in general doesn’t prove that they are poisoning DN vape carts or somehow committing insurance fraud in the process. I’m not seeing how poisoning illegal products used by a VERY small number of people benefits their interests. The only thing the vitamin E problem has done is sour the public on vaping in general, hurt the nicotine vape industry (at least temporarily), and invite regulations that limit their ability to sell the product to the general public. The tobacco industry is dependent on underage consumers, if they grab them young they have a likely lifetime customer. It’s been made clear that there is a teen vaping problem, and the deaths have intensified public scrutiny.

Unions are great and all but not recognizing that they have downsides is disingenuous. Companies don’t have an endless supply of benefits that they’re withholding from the employees, oftentimes the union will take too much and end up with a bunch of unemployed members.

My biggest beef with the unions I’ve dealt with (primarily the USPS Union) is that they go to bat for the worst of the worst employees. You had to have like 6 formal write ups before they could even think about firing you. Some people deserve to get fired. Unrelated union, but my gf has an employee (city government) that said he’d like nothing better than to get a rifle and start taking out random people on the street. The union went to bat for the piece of shit, he is still employed."
