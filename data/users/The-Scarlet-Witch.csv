vancouver,fg14gzp,t3_ew7uzf,1580420566.0,"Infuriating. Beyond infuriating. It's not enough she destroyed a family, she insists on building her own at the expense of showing any remorse or paying any time for her crimes. She keeps having these extensions, taking advantage of the judicial system."
vancouver,fg148gq,t1_fg0365k,1580420435.0,"If it's any comfort, I think your reasoning and strategy are completely reasonable. :) As a parent with an active, younger child, I would appreciate you as my neighbour telling me (in person or a letter). A traumatic brain injury is certainly something that I would adjust my and my child's behaviour for to try and accommodate you. 

I hope that your neighbour takes your message in the spirit it's intended: you aren't out spiting her child. It's much like someone with PTSD and fireworks. We can be a compassionate society."

relationship_advice,fg0k1s1,t3_ew96sn,1580409369.0,"Many states have protective laws against distribution of this kind of material, especially when it involves breaking a reasonable expectation of privacy (like being in a changing room). You might want to talk to a lawyer to find out what your options are. Don't only rely on the police. Police are great, but they are not the experts on law that lawyers are. I'd call the state bar association (if you're in the US) pronto for some kind of referral.  If you know who recorded the video, it definitely can help. You can also request takedowns on social media if you haven't. 

Mute/gag your social media profile. Definitely lock down anyone you cannot explicitly trust. Start up a new email address for the time being and do not share it with people you do not absolutely trust. Your privacy has been completely violated here, and you're well within your rights to feel horrified about it. 

Talk to a counselor if you have access to one through your school or your job (if you have one). Work through those feelings. As long as someone is harassing you, do *not* delete the emails/texts/etc. If the police (or a lawyer) tell you to forward them on, provide them. Data in messages and texts can be used to determine who is bothering you. If it's one person over and over, they are in prime territory for a restraining order. 

This is not your fault. It's not a precise match to your situation but you might look into Rainn.org and their tremendous library of resources available to people suffering sexual abuse and harassment. A big part of that is handling relationships where trust is broken or you aren't sure of what to do. 

Find your allies and your supporters. Stick to them. Cut any toxic, horrible people out of your life that think this is funny."
relationship_advice,fg0jc1y,t3_ew8ltx,1580408959.0,"From a relationship standpoint, support her. Give her affirmation her concerns are real, and if you can, aid her to find another job. Her workplace sounds absolutely awful. 

From a legal standpoint, sexual harassment claims are the bread and butter of employment lawyers. Contact your state bar association for a referral to an employment lawyer for harassment issues. Use the bar (if in Canada, your legal aid society) because lawyers have to be in good standing and the referral process is usually low cost (free to $50 per visit). If other employees are willing to talk about their cases, make sure a lawyer knows that. Having evidence of dates/times written down is also hugely helpful. 

One point of advice: HR exists to protect the company, **not** the employees. They may try to pressure your gf to leave rather than her getting fired or dealing with the harassment issues. Involving a lawyer is a sit up, take notice moment for a company. It shows she is serious."

Unless you happen to be trapped in a certain concentration camp, no one can force you to donate your organs, blood, skin, or other fluids. Especially while you still you can consent. 

Your relatives demanding this are toxic individuals with no place in your life. Certainly your mother is panicking about a devastating diagnosis and it's on her to talk to her health care team, arrange counseling, and make necessary lifestyle or medical changes for continued health. 

You are no organ farm. Set a very clear boundary here that you love your mom, but you're not participating in a transplant. Don't feel the need to justify yourself. No is a complete sentence."
europe,fg00eiv,t3_ew39rn,1580397406.0,"I struggle to understand how someone abroad for 40 years couldn't shift their mindset to get citizenship. He was born a Scot, he is culturally Scottish, he will always /be/ Scottish even if he has German citizenship. He's spent more of his life abroad than in Scotland, so it's sort of a farcical argument? 

I say that as a person with triple citizenship (and dearly considering how to emigrate to the Continent to live in an EU country). I don't cease to be my birth country's nationality because I live in another nation."

relationship_advice,ffu5kke,t3_ev7v8i,1580234962.0,"Parents asking their adult children to be their grown caregivers don't realize how much care this entails. It's brutally difficult with underfunded resources. Alzheimer's patients and dementia patients are incredibly hard to be caregivers for. It is exhausting, backbreaking work even with a good family support network. 

Have you seen what dementia care involves? I'd contact a support group to get a better picture. It goes beyond bathing and food, but dealing with someone who may be violent, non-communicative, with behaviours dangerous to herself and others. Not to mention the increasing frailty as the decline happens. You'll have a large financial outlay to houseproof your or their home. With your dad non-mobile, /he/ is at significant risk too. What if she falls? What if **he** falls, and she cannot communicate this? 

There's a reason memory care homes exist. You can have a great quality of life with active involvement with your parents, while still having your own life. It might be wiser to have your mom talk to a geriatric therapist or psychologist, as they specialize in these things. Her terrors may be realistic or stem from a totally irrational source. A therapist specialized in this area can help deal with the mental health issues. There are multiple advocacy groups for aging adults who provide exceptional resources for finding a good care home, transitioning, and avoiding the horror stories. 

It's really up to her therapist/care team to identify what the source of distress is. Having that now can impact her quality of life. There's another angle here, your dad. Are you going to be taking care of both of them? What if he wants to transition into assisted care, is her refusal to do so going to stop him? Her outright refusal really worries me. 

Your mother's promise is completely unfair. I would strongly advise you seek therapy of your own to find reasonable boundaries. If you and your husband want children, you very much should talk about having them and how you can make regular visits with Mom and Dad work."
relationship_advice,ffu3mmf,t3_ev7zko,1580233772.0,"This relationship isn't going to get better. Get out. 

Need justification? Flip the narrative. Let's say your sister's boyfriend did any of these things to her like takeout punches or smacking her with an Airsoft pistol. 

And said, ""It wasn't malicious!"" 

Would you want her to be in that relationship? Honour yourself. You're worth more than this. Leave.

Talk to your apartment manager about breaking the lease. The penalty might be waived if you explain she's abusive (or have a police report, just saying). Find a new tenant to sublet if you can."
relationship_advice,ffu3gub,t1_fftty57,1580233674.0,"Completely a predator. She's nearly 30. He started having a sexual relationship 9 months ago, it might have been while he was still a minor. Furthermore, if she's known him for years, she might have been grooming him or flirting hardcore to get him into bed. Most 25+ year olds have little interest in 17/18-year-old partners, much less if they're married. 

Either way, she is so toxic she needs to go."
relationship_advice,ffu3c34,t1_fftsa7x,1580233594.0,"Don't kick her out without talking to your son. Most states and provinces make self-help evictions (the kind where you dump someone out and change the locks) illegal. If she's been living in your home for more than 2+ weeks to a month, she's a tenant even without a lease. 

Don't find out the hard way. At least make sure to find out the requirements for your area before making that decision. Nothing says you can't sweeten the pot for her to get out by offering to pay for a moving truck to the storage unit or something, though."
relationship_advice,ffu36vz,t3_ev7dhv,1580233506.0,"Stop and think of how devastating this will be to your son if you **don't** tell him, and he finds out you knew all along. You will be as guilty as his wife. 

Was your DIL banging your stepson **before** he was 18? If so, she might just be committing a crime. This very much depends on state but many don't have Romeo and Juliet laws for under 18s (and the other partner being much older). 

You absolutely need to tell your son, and not leave this to be found out another way. Second, get your husband involved because your stepson probably will need counseling. The relationship between him and his stepbrother may not be salvageable. Do it to teach him better boundaries and deal with the emotional fallout. 

What your adult son wants to do with DIL is up to him. Have a serious talk about evicting your DIL. There is a good chance the relationship with your stepson could continue with backsliding and he's the one trapped at home. If you go the eviction route, **make sure you do it legally**. Do not lock her out. Find out the law for your area, maybe hire a lawyer to do it. Don't dump her stuff out, do not change the locks. 

I'm so sorry. :("

relationship_advice,ffr87qg,t3_eus7xv,1580152576.0,"Clear communication at the moment and afterward if it keeps happening. Gently push her away and tell her that you don't like it. If she persists, full stop and tell her you aren't enjoying it. Redirect her to what you do enjoy."
relationship_advice,ffr7zj8,t3_euq708,1580152437.0,"All this stress and drama will pass. You are better to face the turbulence *before* marrying someone and going through a contentious divorce. If there is a silver lining, it will be that the baby's father steps up to provide some level of support (almost certainly required by the state if you're in the US) and you can carry on with your life. 

It may not feel like it now, but this phase will soon pass. Make sure to give yourself time to grieve the loss of a relationship, the breakdown of trust, and the change in lifestyle. I wouldn't recommend diving right back into the dating pool but focus on the hobbies you enjoy, self-improvement (working out is huge here, for the endorphins alone), and making a healthy space for yourself. Please also consider a bit of counseling. Many health plans and workplaces offer counseling assistance. Having a therapist can profoundly impact how you move forward, and positive relationships (the romantic and platonic kinds) in the future."
