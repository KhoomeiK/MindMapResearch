You should talk to the police BEFORE it escalates, get a paper trail started. He has already sexually assaulted you whether it’s “minor” or not.

Get an addalock or qicklock (can get these on eBay etc) - these jam the door shut from the inside so you can lock yourself into your room without changing the handle or drilling holes for a separate lock."

JUSTNOMIL,fdkmldy,t3_elnvlx,1578506688.0,"If you have the means to move then do it, and make sure she never finds out where.

At the moment I would get some security cameras and CALL THE COPS when she tries to break into your house."
AmItheAsshole,fdklli0,t3_elpvjj,1578506081.0,"NTA, your asshole husband is the other parent and NEEDS TO PARENT TOO. Switch the WiFi off as soon as he’s in there, don’t even give him 10 minutes to fuck about on the shitter while you do everything else.

Do YOU ever get a break?

> and I need to make sure sleep deprivation isnt makeing me an asshole.

Maybe you’d be able to sleep if he did his share of the work!"
AmItheAsshole,fdjs83v,t3_elgrnc,1578485597.0,"NTA, she shat that kid out and fucked right off.

I'm sorry you're stuck watching a kid that isn't yours while your sister doesn't do shit. Bizarre that she comes home at all when she won't even watch her own kid? She doesn't need to be there as it's benefitting nobody but her. Maybe your parents need to step up their parenting with her. Are they paying for her college?

Who legally has custody of this kid?"
AmItheAsshole,fdjrcap,t3_eljeao,1578484584.0,"NTA, you saved her from needing to have the same talk with tiny dick dude at the very least.


> accusing me of being jealous and sabotaging his relationship so I can get him back 

Yeah, *everyone* just wants a piece of that tiny dick in a plastic shopping bag. Ffs. Just block him, you don't owe him a response. 

Other than maybe ""but your dick IS small"" (I'm petty)"
