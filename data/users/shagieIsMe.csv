>Because of his commitment to backgammon and his interest in this case in particular, Magriel had traveled across the United States to appear as an expert witness at the trial.

>When the prosecutor first saw Magriel’s name on Barr’s witness list he thought it was a bluff. When Barr requested a trial postponement in January to accommodate Magriel’s playing in Nassau, he though “more manuevering.” But when he heard Magriel was actually in Portland to testify for Ted Barr, he was not only surprised, but annoyed.

>Others were also impressed. The courtroom was packed on Friday afternoon with spectators waiting to see and hear X-22. Every prosecutor and lawyer in the courthouse who played backgammon was there to watch. Some even carried copies of Magriel’s Backgammon in hope of getting an autograph on the cover. Even the D.A. himself wandered in and out of the courtroom to hear Magriel’s testimony."

Data structures (only lightly touching on algorithms).  When I took it, it was the first class taught in C++ at the university.  I also remember the professor's complete distain for AVL trees and had us learn 2-3 trees instead (and then explained a bit about B\* trees).

There was a class on numerical methods in there too.  I have... more experience with that class that I would otherwise desire (I took it a few times).  I really regret not understanding office hours the first time I took it because that professor turned out to be excellent (didn't learn until years later).  That was taught in a mixture of Matlab and Fortran - the specific amounts depending on who taught it.  Newtons method, splines, area under the curve with trapezoids...  I've actually used that once or twice.  I wish I understood splines better (that first professor was a master of splines).

Compiler class where we built a compiler for a C like language.  First assignment was a hash table with some special functionality for scope lookups, then a lexer, then a parser, and then the assembler (to machine code... which was MIPS assembly).

Operating systems class.  The assignments that I remember for that one were a scheduler that also did resource allocation and a drawbridge with cars and ships that were an analogy of readers and writers in memory (I remember naming the semaphore for the bridge `troll`).

AI class.  This one varied significantly depending on the professor.  One professor specialized in computer vision.  I took the one who did game theory and had assignments on min max trees, alpha beta pruning, the job shop problem, determining the minimum set of inputs to make a complex logical expression true and a final program for playing gomaku.  This class was taught in a mixture of LISP and C++.  For fun with the gomaku program, I taught myself curses so that I could play with arrow keys (and see the analysis of the board) rather than typing 'b4' to play.

Theory of programming languages.  Write the same program in four different languages that used four different styles of writing code.  Procedural was C (not C++) this was more to familiarize ourselves with the program we'd be writing.  The second was this new language that the prof was quite interested in that had just changed its name from [Oak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_(programming_language)).  The third one was [ML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_(programming_language)) which was I remembered as C without variables.  For the first to programs I could use the same algorithm... the ML one I had to completely change how I thought about the program.  The last was Prolog... and I didn't get that one working.

Then there was the option of either computer science theory or computer science algorithms (lots of big O).  I took the theory class and saw that this was the theoretical side of the compiler class.  We covered the [Chomsky hierarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_hierarchy) of languages.  Regular expressions were the lexer.  Pushdown automata were the parser.  I really liked this class... though it was all pen and paper homework... so for fun I wrote an interpreter for a language that one could write Turing machines in so that I could check my code (I wrote that in lex and yacc using the Oriely book as a guideline).  Talking to the professor about this, I remember a discussion that we had about the merits of fall through within a switch expression.

You had notebooks that you wrote in.  On paper.

Anyways... that's what the CS classes that I took back then were.  When I graduated I was able to write code in pascal, C, C++, Fortran, Lisp, perl and this funky new language named Java.  There wasn't any focus on internships.  I had a few dozen programs of some complexity that I had written for myself for fun and could explain the various merits and design decisions of each.

I'll also point out that back then... of the group of people that I spent time with, about 3/4ths of us went to system administration, tech support and QA out of college.  Some went on to grad school.  Very few went on to be developers at tech companies initially.  Quite a few are still sysadmins (in the ""its a small world"" - one of the sysadmins that I work with now learned under a sysadmin that I worked with in college... and the intern I work with now, his CS high school teacher was a classmate of mine too)."

From [Determining the ice cover of Madison lakes](http://www.aos.wisc.edu/~sco/lakes/msn-lakes_instruc.html):

>Determining the opening and closing dates for Lake Mendota is more of a challenge because the length and shape of the lake would require a sufficiently high vantage point that was not readily available to 19th century observers.  Partly because Lake Mendota has a more irregular shoreline, an important secondary criterion applies for that lake:  whether one can row a boat between Picnic Point and Maple Bluff.  This rule arose from the era of E. A. Birge and Chancey Juday (according to Reid Bryson, founder of the UW Meteorology Dept., now known as the Dept. of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences), because they frequently were out on the lake in a rowboat, and the ***ice along that line determined if they could transport a case of beer over to their friends in Maple Bluff***.

You need something to connect from the echo to the zigbee network.  One approach is the [Echo Plus](https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-2nd-built/dp/B07Z6ZV54B) which has a integrated hub.  The other is to have a [hue hub](https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Hue-Stand-Alone-Bridge/dp/B016H0QZ7I).  For the hub connecting to the echo, this is done by having the hub connect to your hub to the cloud ([instructions](https://www2.meethue.com/en-gb/support/app/top/how-to-create-a-hue-account-and-link-to-your-hue-bridge)) which is then linked from amazon cloud (skill) to the hue, well, cloud.

Consider that other systems (apple home kit, google home, etc...) can connect to the hub hub.  They can't manage the hue system from the echo plus.

There are bluetooth hue bulbs.  They operate on both the zigbee network and the bluetooth network.  It requires a special app to use.  It appears that these will work with Alexa.  From https://www2.meethue.com/en-us/blog/bluetooth-led-lights

> This new collection of smart LED bulbs can be controlled via Bluetooth using your smartphone, tablet, or other mobile device, as well as selected smart home assistants including Google Home and Alexa.

> We are starting to build Bluetooth into our existing Zigbee smart bulbs so that they can be controlled by both types of networks. We aren't switching over to a Bluetooth-only system — Bluetooth compatibility is an added feature to our existing design, geared toward those who are just starting out with smart lighting.

So, no, those don't require a bridge to control them.

Wifi bulbs...

Those depend on the type of bulb.  Each company will have their own alexa skill (and phone app) to control them.

Personally, hue and hub (not the echo plus).  That's a my system thing, and very much a this works *for me*.  I've got many alexa devices.  I'm an iPhone user.

On saturation...

> I'm wiling to work hard and learn, but don't know if the field will be saturated soon. 

No.  It will not be saturated soon.  What *is* saturated is all the people going to the coasts trying to get a high paying job at a fabulous tech company.  There are lots of jobs everywhere else - they just don't pay as well as big technology companies do.

CSCQ tends to be a bit of an echo chamber of ""Big N or bust"" and ""max your TC or go home.""  This may reflect life in a small segment of some major metro areas on a coast, but it doesn't reflect life in CS as a whole.

Give https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes150000.htm a look - click on the various domains.  Note that the mean wages aren't those big numbers people brag about... and somewhere around half will be under that (its harder to get the median, let's just assume they're similar).

There's a lot of jobs out there... just that if you're expecting the big bucks for working at Google, there is indeed [competition for those positions](https://qz.com/285001/heres-why-you-only-have-a-0-2-chance-of-getting-hired-at-google/).

Note also that there are a lot of jobs out there that are *not* computer programming.  A good chunk of those people will pivot to computer support and operations.  I work with some brilliant sysadmins who switched out of a CS degree early on because while they loved the problems of working with computers, they hated the puzzles that programming provide.  Terraform and helm charts rather than Java and Spring.  They get paid just as much as I do and enjoy their job and I enjoy mine.

On passion...

Programming is a puzzle - and its constantly doing those puzzles.  Go try a [killer sudoku puzzle](https://www.killersudokuonline.com/play.html?puzzle=D3544da4720&year=2018) and consider if you have the desire to finish it.

If life were a fantasy role playing game with stats, the prime attribute for a software developer would be 'willpower'.  It is through the expenditure of willpower that you're able to solve those puzzles.  It is also that thing that you'll find at the end of the day is completely exhausted.

When I worked tech support and QA, I'd come home with a bunch of ideas and work on my personal projects for a bit.  I had some neat ones.  Now... I've spent all that willpower in the office and at home I don't have enough to do things that require significant decision making (those are saved for weekends and vacations).

---

CS along with something else...

Sure.  Why not?  Having an understanding of what is going on behind and beneath when you're using some other software is useful.  Not being afraid of writing an excel macro or getting into some gnarly excel expressions - thats useful too.

Much of our world is computer oriented now and a degree of computer literacy is a useful thing.

---

In summary...

If you think you're going to be able to go get a CS degree and are then entitled to getting a high paying job at a fabulous tech company, you're likely going to be disappointed.

Its not so much ""find something you love doing"" but rather ""don't go do something that you end up hating for the money."""
