MurderedByWords,ff9bf6k,t1_ff94eek,1579709131.0,"There is a rare condition called ""congenital leptin deficiency"". It would not let you gain weight when you eat 1200 calories every day, HOWEVER your brain would think all the time that it would starve. That is what leptin basicly does, telling the brain if the body is starving or not. So it's reallllllly hard to just eat your 1200 kcal because your brain will think that you starve all the time.

""Without leptin, the body thinks it has no body fat, and this signals intense, uncontrolled hunger and food intake. This often manifests in severe childhood obesity and delayed puberty. The treatment for leptin deficiency is leptin injections.""

Edit:
""The virus was identified in 1984 by French and American scientists, which meant that companies could begin to develop a test for antibodies produced in response to the virus. The first test used blood and was known as an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or ELISA test. It was approved for use on March 2, 1985. A second test of the same type was approved on March 9.""
