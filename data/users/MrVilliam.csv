todayilearned,fgut66d,t1_fguews0,1581128858.0,"I can't disagree, but this is not a bad router. It's a dual band with a high cap, not just the lowest recommended one. I'm pretty sure I spent $150 to $200 on it. I highly doubt that it's a router issue."
politics,fgtezam,t1_fgt2bma,1581103634.0,"No, if I had to guess, that was much more of a Wario impression. Link is more like *HYAHHHH*"
todayilearned,fgt1t15,t1_fgrd1b0,1581097262.0,Even though it's one of the routers Comcast recommended?
todayilearned,fgqugc6,t3_ezz2og,1581031736.0,"Currently paying for 300Mbps, regularly seeing 15-40. Yes, that's wired speed. Yes, I power cycle the modem and router when I notice it being especially slow. Funny, when service first started, I saw over 200 while the technician was here to fix it when it wasn't working at all.

I'm not savvy enough to do the raspberry pi Twitter thing. What would be a good and effective route? My only other option is Verizon DSL at 1.5 to 3 Mbps for nearly the same cost, so thanks to a regional monopoly, I don't have a competitive option."
AskReddit,fgknb2o,t1_fgj3m4g,1580869442.0,"I think you're right that that's generally not a great question to ask unless you're pretty certain that you're getting the job. My tried and true alternate wording was ""do you have any reason to believe that I'm not the best candidate for this position? Are there any concerns you have that I should be aware of?""

If you get a frank and friendly ""no"" then you're in a good spot. If there's hesitation or some question of whether they should answer, then it's a good thing you didn't ask when you'd be starting."
AskReddit,fgh9gdm,t1_fgg6pg4,1580779787.0,Seriously. How do you make Highlander 2 when it's so clear to anybody familiar with it that *THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE*?
politics,fgg9t1a,t1_fgfw071,1580757327.0,"First video was a little cringey, but I felt like some of those clips were cut around. If I had the option to not work, I'd take that option. Who the hell would choose to give away 40+ hours per week when they could get the same payoff to not do that? And I get that incarceration does make it hard to get a job later, and that's not fair. Jail/prison should be rehabilitating inmates. When they're released, their debt to society is paid. It's horseshit that they're looked upon differently and treated differently. They did their time and have been cleared to return to society.

The second video was horrifying. It's one thing to suffer ones own ignorance, but wholly another to stew in hatred over your own choices. And what's worse is that they couldn't tell you why they hate what they hate. They don't know why they don't like black people. They don't know why ""Obamacare"" is ""retarded"". They don't know why voting the way they vote is good for them. They don't question these things. It doesn't occur to them to self-evaluate or think. They are the way they are because that's the way God wants things, I guess. But things they don't like, God is okay with you changing. MS lost ""the war"" but the South will rise again. It's okay for them to take food stamps and welfare from Washington, but they'll go to war against that provider as soon as they're able to. And for what? What do they disagree with? ""I don't know, I saw it on a bumper sticker. The thought of killing libruls gives me a half chub. Quarter chub on a bad day.""

Why is empathy so impossible for 40% of the country?"
politics,fgg5c5r,t1_fgg1dnr,1580754582.0,"Then respond back with ""they earned it because of a system that allowed and provided them with the opportunity to earn it, so they should pay for that system accordingly.""

Truck drivers and trucking companies make decent money, but they have to pay tolls to maintain the roads that allow them to make that money."
popping,ffs3di9,t1_ffs22wz,1580172133.0,Yes. Name your price.
politics,ffrtz0l,t1_ffrqqxy,1580165775.0,"I understand this, but why on Earth is the bar higher for an article than for the leader of our nation? Journalists can't say he ""lied"" unless they can prove that he knew and understood that his statement was not the truth, but Trump can say whatever the fuck he wants with no consequence if he didn't gather the proof of it? He is falsely accusing Democrats of lying about wanting Bolton to testify, but nobody will accuse Trump of lying.

I'll do it. Trump is a fucking liar. Sue me, broke-ass racist moron. You won't be president much longer so take it in while you can, coward."

AskReddit,ff5wmbw,t1_ff54ztk,1579612705.0,"Dude, I envy you. I played for a local church with great equipment for years, but had to leave because my career is such a drain on my time and energy. I also have been in a few bands that either dissolved or resulted in a split over creative differences. Now I just play by myself once in a blue moon and dream of what could have been.

I'm 31. Not too late to do something, but there's a really good chance that I've missed my shot to even come close to where you are. You're living a good life. Don't worry about people judging you. It's not about that. If it's all you want to do, then you're doing what makes you happy, and it's much more productive than watching TV on the couch like so many judgmental people do."
nononono,ferf5qh,t1_fer2ek0,1579353184.0,"Basic Google skills will reveal to you that yes, self driving cars are better. They don't get drunk, they don't get drowsy, and they don't get distracted.

You're also implying that people shouldn't take their cars home or to businesses. That's a ridiculous knee jerk reaction. The problem here wasn't infrastructure. The problem was a young guy driving while he was at risk of falling asleep, and then he did fall asleep. This is his fault, not society's. It wasn't the design of roads/sidewalks, it wasn't the design of the car, and it wasn't people walking when/where they shouldn't. This guy chose to operate deadly machinery when he wasn't in the proper state to do so. Full stop."

AskReddit,feji0yd,t1_feilz7w,1579175152.0,"Thanks, Dudebrosef. Right back at you. Time and healthy thoughts help. I'm not sure how long it's been for you, but it's about 7 years for me, and it's definitely gotten easier over the years. It still hurts to think about how much my mom didn't get to see or be a part of, but I don't feel lost or helpless like I did at first. When she passed, I absolutely did not have my shit together, and I was a total loser. Now, I just wish I could show her that I'm doing great."

politics,fdizheq,t1_fdiz8us,1578454632.0,No other president would have assassinated a high ranking military official of a sovereign nation immediately after requesting his presence to help negotiate peace. That's what started this. Nice try.
