That's actually not an issue with the Electoral College,  it's an issue with State Laws called ""Unit Rules.""  The way the EC was designed,  each individual _district_ got their own elector,  and they voted with the majority of their **district**.  Well,  48 states decided to pass laws in a  dumb effort to gain an electoral advantage and made is so that your elector has to vote with the majority of the **state**.

Without these rules,  the EC would be a fairly rational thing..  with them,  you get this political fuckery we see now.

So does Utah,  and with their mormon population,  I'd put my money on them for having the most inbreed population."

The people who _reported_ the vulnerabilities..  sure,  but you're completely ignoring how research is done and apparently haven't even bothered to look at the ""references"" section in any white paper on the subject.

Let me put it another way..  do you think the researchers were just trying random stuff?  Or do you suppose they had a _reason_ to target the branch predictor?  If they _knew_ to do this,  why didn't Intel,  or AMD,  or ARM or IBM?

Way to be civil and take a generous reading.  Do I believe that they knew about this,  hid it,  and put the products out anyways?  No.  Do I believe that the high-price and ""engineering excellence"" was a bunch of smoke and mirrors?  Yes.  I mean,  seriously,  look at their initial response to the situation.

I no longer see any reason to pay Intel an inflated price,  they've lost my confidence severely.
