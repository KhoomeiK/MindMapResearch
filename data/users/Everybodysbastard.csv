AskReddit,fdfkg0w,t3_el2az5,1578363782.0,I ainâ€™t fucking no kid.  I just saw The Goldbergs.  Maybe it would cover my attorneys fees by the time my plea bargain was entered.
AskReddit,fdfdjp6,t1_fdfdhde,1578359170.0,I got the sense she cared about his well being but not romantically.

AmItheAsshole,fdelv38,t1_fddej18,1578341773.0,"You're already alone on the family front. You don't NEED these people if they constantly hurt you all of the time.   I quit talking to my brother except for my nephew's birthday and Christmas.  I haven't seen him in four years and it's been great.  No wondering when he'll get drunk and try to ask me why I don't like him.  No looking at him and thinking about the time he threatened to shoot me (no weapon on him when he said it) in front of my Mom and sister.   My emotional health is WAY better after putting contact on my terms, not his.  And I'm sure it'll be the same for you if you cut these people out of your life to the extent to which you are capable."

AskMen,fddtbro,t1_fddp3m5,1578323448.0,Felt that way after a week in MOPP gear when outside for any reason too.  Walking to work after that made you feel like Superman since it was so much easier.
