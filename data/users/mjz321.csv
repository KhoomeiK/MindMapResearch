I think the fact that I was there for 11 years as a csm and never met the store manager is telling."
walmart,ffe4ue5,t1_fes3tpv,1579836735.0,I was at this store for 11 years as an overnight csm and  I had never met the store manager everytime I asked to speak with him even for open door he sent  co manager or assistant. I asked to speak with him to day they fired me he told me and the assistant that he would be in at 7am (minutes after I was.to be fired) and would speak to me then I waited until 7:30 when an assistant came and told me he changed his mind and would not be there until that evening. Really showed me just how much respect store management had for me.
