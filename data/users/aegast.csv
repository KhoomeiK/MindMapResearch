I know you said that electronics are strictly limited before bed but if she wants to see her sister, I think there can be an exception to every rule. Like 20 minutes or so? It may not be the same but it’s giving her something to work with at least."

If ANYTHING you are helping them gain an understanding for those that they may come across later in life who may have the same issue. I applaud you for being open with your children. If you weren’t, they would not understand why you have bad days."
