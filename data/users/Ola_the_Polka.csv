AskReddit,ffbq4mv,t1_ffbcn4v,1579778117.0,What
Narcolepsy,ffb7m06,t3_esmlf5,1579754073.0,"i did the exact same switch as you, but I'm not on BC and it was because modafinil was giving me horrendous headaches and made me crash. Dexies are SOO MUCH SMOOTHER!!! Holy shit dexies are a million times better than modafinil in my experience. I was able to better control the dose (I take 3 x 5mg just before I  wake up and 1-2 x 5mg around midday if I need to do stuff in the evening) and honestly it's so much better.

The come-up is way smoother and I don't get any headaches or that meth-y jittery feeling like I did on modafinil, which surprised me, because I thought dexies were supposed to be stronger. You won't regret it :) 

TLDR less side effects, smoother ""come up"" and no strong ""crash"" after the dex wears off"

australia,ff7tk81,t1_ff26y1u,1579658024.0,"yep, only ANZ i'm pretty sure! FYI just used a dodgy old-looking ANZ atm in a petrol station, and I was able to get money with just tapping my phone"
sailing,ff7tf06,t3_es2cie,1579657922.0,such a beautiful shot! I always get yelled at by our skipper when I try to take the sunset picture of the harbour while we're racing lol. I love our city :)
AskReddit,ff1osoc,t1_feyun6l,1579482849.0,this episode fucked me up. I often think about  summer jerry and beth being stuck in that universe while Rick and Morty are just off living their normal (new) lives lol
australia,ff1h2l4,t1_ff1bqjf,1579479111.0,"Can confirm it works with phones :) it used to only work with cards, but as of 6-9  months ago phones work fine too. I have an iphone. Also, most if not all ANZ ATMs have the contactless withdrawal option (but admittedly, I do live in Sydney city)"
