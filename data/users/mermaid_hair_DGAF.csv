Please continue on this path.  Sorry you haven't felt loved lately, but taking that out on one person would not be right. 

You say you've had the same thing happen multiple times. Have you considered that it might be something you're doing? Maybe you're just not great at communicating via dating apps and you would come across better in person. From the language you've used here, it seems like you could come off a bit forceful. THAT IS EASILY FIXABLE. It isn't a reason to end your life. It will just take some patience and practice.

I hope you can talk with a friend soon about your feelings on this. It seems like you might have gotten lost in that nonsense of dating apps and may a bit out of touch with reality.

*edit: I didn't mean for this to come off sounding harsh on you. Online dating sucks. I've been there, hated it, won't go back. I just don't think you should hang your self worth on that sort of shit, and it seems like you get that, but it is hard to break away from that mentality."

SuicideWatch,fdpd4r7,t3_emb53l,1578625610.0,"Since it seems like your decision has been made, I'm not going to try to persuade you to change your mind or seek mental health. However, since you mentioned that you intend to write a will, I would encourage you to seek professional legal advice depending on  the assets that will be considered a part of your estate and any potential heirs you may have. 

If you are writing a will to bequeath personal belongings to friends, that's something you can certainly do on your own. But if you're talking real estate or anything else of significant value and/or there could be competing heirs to anything in your estate, you might want to speak to a lawyer. 

If you're in the US, speaking as a lawyer in a major city, I'd say that most firms would charge you a few hundred bucks. (Note: I have no interest in being your attorney or helping you draft a will - merely stating for a relative price point for you.) If you don't have the money for a lawyer, you could always consult legal aid in your area. 

You can obviously do whatever you want, and I have no insight into your situation, so I am tossing things out here. But since you plan to write a will, I'm assuming you have specific plans you'd like honored. Just thinking ahead to your family/friends that will be dealing with your estate in the event that you go through with your plan. They will be having a difficult time, so anything you can do to make their situation easier might be nice."
