desmoines,fenqmcy,t3_eq1k67,1579289373.0,I just drove from 86th home to Newton. It's lying.
selfimprovement,feh5m0a,t1_feh4kh2,1579109626.0,"So, because I don't believe and she does, we can't compromise because it's giving in? I can't attend so that I can provide some counterargument to what is being said there? I can't keep my opinion to myself until after the service has ended or it's the easy way out?

Fuck off, troll."
worldpolitics,feh226k,t3_eovz28,1579107517.0,It's almost like we don't have two different words to express this.
selfimprovement,feh1swi,t1_fef275t,1579107365.0,"Consider that I wasn't actually asking for a response to my comment.

What's more sad is people who don't know the full story and think they do, or worse, think they know what's best for me and my family. I'm not ""letting"" my wife ""make"" my daughter go to church. We're a family, not a corporation. And sometimes compromise means doing things you don't like.

Actually, I do speak my mind. You make the assumption that I haven't voiced my opinion to my wife and even my daughter. You make the assumption that I don't talk about my thoughts on the sermons we attend. What I said was that I don't do it in the church. That's their house and I'm a guest. To do so would be childish and rude.

I'm not taking the easy way. I'm taking the adult way."

NoStupidQuestions,fddwv4o,t3_ekvswo,1578325938.0,I took a course at university on spies and spying in the 20th century. They had the capability to read what brand of cigarettes guards were smoking on patrol of the Berlin Wall during the Cold War. Imagine how far they've come since the 80's.

NoStupidQuestions,fcxiwcr,t3_ejdpka,1578064050.0,"Hell no! I hate this idea that a gift can't be resold, returned, or otherwise gotten rid of. A gift is a gift. Once given, it is the property of the person receiving it. What that person chooses to do with something they are given is their own fucking business and nobody else's. You were given a drone by your grandfather. I'm fairly certain he would rather you have something you want and will use than something you're going to put in a closet and never use. But, if he wouldn't, that's on him, not you."
AskMen,fcxghfn,t3_ejg3wv,1578062316.0,"I carry my wallet in my back pocket. The difference is that I don't carry everything I own in it. It's a HuMn wallet, two metal plates with an elastic band. I carry my ID, my debit card, and a little cash. If I need a credit card to pay for something, I put it in long enough to go pay for something. Otherwise, I leave it at home in a lock box. If I need other IDs for something, like the first day paperwork at a job, I put them in for that day. Otherwise, I leave them at home in a lock box. The problem isn't a wallet in the back pocket, it's carrying unnecessary shit every day."

NoStupidQuestions,fcncb1o,t3_ei4qc9,1577808619.0,Probably not. The Reich was still strong in 1943. Heinrich Himmler would probably have taken over.

selfimprovement,fcn6ydc,t1_fcn58ph,1577804881.0,"I try to do it several times a week, but it's best to do daily. You ask yourself three questions:

1. What went well today?
2. What didn't go well today?
3. What could I have done differently?

The idea is to recognize:

1. ...what you're doing right, so you can do more of it
2. ...what you're doing wrong, so you can do less of it
3. ... what you can change, so you're offering solutions and not just beating yourself up."

I do a mixture of Bullet Journaling, long-form journaling, Stoic reflection, and now gratitude journaling. I use an app I found called CustomJournal, for which I made three tutorial videos on YouTube. I also just put out a video about spending the last Sunday of the year as a day of reflection, reading my old journal entries and missing to a new journal."

androidapps,fck3uu3,t3_ehlp0n,1577715798.0,"I love an app called CustomJournal. I use it daily. It allows me to totally customize my journal experience, which is perfect. I use a combination of Bullet Journaling, long-form journaling, Stoic reflection, reviewing, and gratitude journaling. CustomJournal allows me to create templates to handle all of those and more. If you check my post history, you can find my YouTube channel. I do mostly self-improvement stuff, but I did three tutorial videos on CustomJournal and how to use it."

NoStupidQuestions,fc5h6xb,t3_egb0zm,1577457492.0,"Most of this advice is great. It could be sleep deprivation or depression (including seasonal). I suffer from both as well. I would add in something that helped me:  it could also be that you need a purpose, finding a ""why"". Check out a book by Simon Sinek called ""Start With Why"" and look into the philosophy of Ikigai. They both helped me immensely."
LifeProTips,fc5g023,t3_efzgt6,1577456515.0,"I wholeheartedly agree with this LPT. I made a YouTube channel about self-help, self-improvement, and personal growth. One of my early videos is on the importance of journaling to the process and building a custom journal. I eventually switched to using an app I found and made three tutorial videos on how to use and customise the app to create a journal that works best for you. I use a variety of methods, including bullet journaling, Stoic reflection, and long-form journaling. It's been a great asset to me, helping to keep my life in perspective, see the accomplishments, not just the failures, and remember the little things in life. My goal for 12,020 is to add in gratitude journaling to my routine."

Body fat is produced when a person consumes more calories than they burn. The body takes excess calories, whether from consuming fat, protein, or carbs, and concerts it into fat to store for later consumption."

NoStupidQuestions,fc2qges,t3_efusks,1577370985.0,"It depends on if you're talking about a cap or a grill. If it's a cap, a dentist will grind off a bunch of the tooth that's gone rotten and then cap it with a gold crown to cover the exposed tooth. If you're talking about a grill, I don't know."
