AskReddit,ffeprsf,t3_et0asi,1579859348.0,"I was in a FWB type relationship with a female colleague and one time during sex (she was on top) she grabbed my throat and slowly started squeezing.
At first i didn't think much of it I thought she was just being a bit kinky and I was kinda fondling her breasts at the time, then her grip started getting a bit too firm and I looked up at her face and I kind of caught her in this weird dead stare and she seemed to snap out of when she noticed me looking at her.
We had a couple of drinks and the sex was kinda rough that day but that stare just weirded me out and always stuck with me."
