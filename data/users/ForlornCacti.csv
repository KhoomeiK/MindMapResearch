psychology,ffgrkhn,t1_fffykbj,1579913252.0,I followed the depression memes subreddit for about a month and had to unfollow because it made me more depressed. Sometimes it was reassuring and most of the time it made me feel more hopeless.

Eyebleach,ffeddtg,t1_ffe5pvi,1579843913.0,Your life can't be that exciting if you're spending it looking at people's profiles and shaming them. You have a choice to be silent or shitty. Why choose the latter?

Eyebleach,ffdtel6,t1_ffdpue7,1579828467.0,"No. Wild animals in general are not safe to approach. Even though some have done it with no harm, others have paid for it dearly and you never know what you're gonna get when you approach the animal."
Eyebleach,ffdtbye,t1_ffd2lve,1579828414.0,"I know it's me anthropomorphizing the koala, but it looks like that to me too."

quotes,ffd1m5y,t3_est5dn,1579811630.0,"And what makes Frank so qualified that I should listen to him? If I enact the model/advice of others it's because I have actively decided that this is how I want to live my life. If that seems boring to anyone else, well then they are free to think what they want, but it has nothing to do with me."
wholesomememes,ffd15du,t1_ffcryzm,1579811367.0,"I'm about 5 pounds overweight so I may not have room to talk, but not all of us are happy eating junk food. Eating moderately healthy makes some of us happier. I, too, find it hard to relate to being happy eating junk food and that has nothing to do with weight. You just feel physically so much more awful and that, for me, diminishes my happiness. I go through phases where I will backslide, but it never feels like I'm ""living the good life"". All of that said, I really don't care if people choose to be fat. If they ARE fat and happy, more power to them. Whatever works is what should be done as long as it doesn't kill you."

NatureIsFuckingLit,ffcl1ft,t1_ffcfww0,1579801718.0,Sometimes I love the internet and when I learn new things like this is one of those times. I had no idea crows could have different colors.

DoesAnybodyElse,ffc49v2,t3_esstk1,1579791169.0,"I've never believed in fairy tales because they aren't reality. IMO believing in fairy tales is toxic. I do believe in love though. Even so, I struggle to think of it as anything other than a burden sometimes because it just doesn't seem to ever work out. I'm so sorry you've been betrayed. I promise there are people out there who WILL love you and treat you right. It's essental that you don't internalize the behavior of your ex. You are valuable - you deserve to be cared for and respected. Don't let anyone make you believe otherwise. They can take a flying leap."
daddit,ffc3w52,t3_espnxg,1579790906.0,13 years later than what? You're 13 and had a baby? Your child is 13 and having a baby?

NatureIsFuckingLit,ffazqmq,t1_ffa2yuk,1579748261.0,To share it with those who have not seen it. Why else does anyone post anything on Reddit?
