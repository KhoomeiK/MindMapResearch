aquarium,ffxmuf6,t1_ffv96kl,1580328343.0,"Gotcha! thanks for the heads up, they don't tell you these kind of things at petstore."
solotravel,ffx7qti,t3_evjiun,1580319508.0,Wait what? solutions? This isn't a problem. I sure hope not.
shittyaquariums,ffx7cwp,t1_ffx1icg,1580319279.0,"There's this misconception that just cause betta fish live in shallow waters in the wild, that they can survive in bowls. Bowls = low maintenance and easily transportable. Idk about the name tag...."
shittyaquariums,ffx72le,t3_evh1fv,1580319110.0,But did you say something?
drawing,ffst4k8,t3_euvq80,1580191491.0,This look like a photograph! I'm stunned.
pics,ffssw3n,t3_euwix9,1580191249.0,Who else fixed their posture?
aquarium,ffssr5f,t1_ffsqe24,1580191105.0,"Sounds good. I was wondering about that foam, is it bad for the water?"
PlanetZoo,ffp3g4j,t3_eubg1a,1580085521.0,This. Is. Amazing.
aquarium,ffjmgbs,t1_ffipqqh,1580001634.0,"It's not totally looked down on in the US, it's all about personal beliefs, I'm doing a fishless cycle right now, mainly because I simply just don't want the possibility of killing a fish. Call me sensitive idk. Lmao I am impatient though..."
aquarium,ffhypo1,t3_etqrfp,1579959532.0,"You're going to want to cycle it, trust me. I've made the mistake of not cycling and it's not fun. But I love your set up! Simple, natural, and minimalistic."
aquarium,ffhyh4b,t1_ffhs250,1579959283.0,I agree whole heartedly.
aquarium,ffgvpi6,t3_etk1fo,1579916262.0,"I have a decaying plant in there to help with the cycle, is this necessary though?"
PlanetZoo,ffgvaeq,t1_ff8utoh,1579915956.0,"Yes! Thank you for sharing this, super helpful."
solotravel,fff93z0,t3_eta2kh,1579878763.0,"My personal souvenirs are some kind of tattoo that represents the country or a memory I have during my trip. I also started getting magnets from everywhere now, haha but that's pretty cliche. Gifts are hard, it depends on the person too. I would usually get something hand made and authentic as a gift e.g. wallets, clothes, fabrics, paints."
aquarium,ffbe7p4,t1_ff63p71,1579761520.0,"That is exactly what is happening to me right now, I've only found a couple babies so far. Could they help speed up the nitrogen cycle? Will they eventually start eating my plants?"
PlanetZoo,ffa2an3,t1_ff9l7jj,1579726458.0,"So, you're saying the keeper won't feed the animals because we don't have the correct feeder in the habitat? I've tried changing the size and/or adding more feeders, but still, they're oblivious."
PlanetZoo,ffa1y3v,t3_es9317,1579726253.0,"This keeps happening to me too, literally had like 10 peafowls die because the keeper wouldn't feed them! Also, with my mandrills, the keeper will be in their habitat cleaning while the animals are starving, still no feeding. I REALLY wish we could just fill up the feeder manually. This could be a bug??"
bettafish,fezpegm,t1_fezaj8p,1579459998.0,"Wow are the galaxy koi just an outcome of random betta breeding? It looks like some crazy genetic mutation, but beautiful nonetheless."
PlanetZoo,fepwy1j,t3_duhciy,1579333850.0,"Adding animals to the empty exhibits and more drinking shops increased my income from the negatives... not sure if this is why though. One thing that is frustrating is the power periodically keeps getting cut and then powered on? Are you having this happen too?

Edit: Just realized this is an old post. Anyone having this problem during career mode?"
PlanetZoo,feohha7,t3_eq02yv,1579300235.0,"Hahah YES, currently at work now, almost off! :D"
bettafish,femeiuo,t3_eptlxu,1579251355.0,How do I get one of these?!
WTF,feme6c7,t3_eptnsv,1579250858.0,You'd think the realistate agent would have seen this?
aquarium,feme229,t3_epvbmg,1579250689.0,What species is this??
solotravel,felv9gv,t1_fel9xsc,1579231795.0,"Yeah, good point. I was just ready to get out of there by the second day. But don't get me wrong, it is a beautiful city!"
solotravel,felv3xq,t1_fels5pc,1579231686.0,Haha I guess I just wasn't into it. To each their own.
solotravel,fekzc1a,t3_epkfky,1579210740.0,"You will only want to spend 1-2 days in Bangkok, Thailand.  Also, my ultimate travel tip would be to not overly plan ahead - you never know if you'll want to stay longer somewhere cause of an event or meeting cool people. You just never know and most tickets for planes and trains are non-refundable (at least for me and my luck). Lesson learned, go with the flow! (I guess if you're absolutely crunched on time then it is probably necessary to plan)."
pics,fekxzqm,t3_epldx1,1579209934.0,This makes me so happy!
PlanetZoo,fekihh7,t1_fej42w0,1579200737.0,I think this is true. My African elephants have been doing this too due to low social group.
Floof,fek84qa,t1_fek4lzi,1579194596.0,You've got a good looking cat then.
PlanetZoo,fek1gj1,t3_ep2jya,1579190571.0,"This is amazing. Here I am, taking 2 hours to make a short trip shuttle monorail."
PlanetZoo,fek13iq,t3_epasv3,1579190349.0,How'd you get that smoky look?!
PlanetZoo,fek0u2b,t3_epdidv,1579190189.0,"That's hilarious. I haven't seen that one yet, I like how he's not happy about it. XD"
