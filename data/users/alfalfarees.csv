There have been plenty of celeb photographs where their makeup artist had the best products around and yet messed up and made the celeb they were working on actually look bad in certain lightings. They forgot to brush powder off of their cheeks, forgot to blend the nose contour or blend the foundation from the neck down, etc.

Removing the downvote feature forces people to actually back up why they disagree with someone. Or, they can get on with their lives and move on without needing to put a count against someone’s points.

The downvote feature gets abused so easily and has large enough repercussions (bars users from a lot of subreddits if they have a negative count or not a high enough karma) that it doesn’t outweigh the potential benefits that can already be substituted by a simple report button, or having them be pushed down at the bottom without needed a downvote feature.

You’re right, it doesn’t matter that you’re there.

todayilearned,febvrz7,t1_febtdu5,1578963320.0,"I feel it was generous and a large amount also due to the situation. This guy was greatly rewarded for something that to him is a very large amount. When it comes to the Bank of America itself, wouldn’t it never be enough due to their vast wealth? Would they needed to give him a million, or multiple million, or even a billion for it to be “enough” relative to their wealth? It would be a bit illogical, because the means for it which it is being given does not need that much.

Now, when it comes to an issue like with a tragedy, I can understand why people would say that. Yes, better than nothing, but the cause would necessitate more of a loss on the one donating, more going towards the one receiving. I personally feel these two situations, while similar, differ in regards to what the situation calls for, hence why there’s different rules/expectations with how much they should be giving relative to their wealth."

Anything news-related goes to politics and trump. Everywhere. From my family, from their friends, from the media to even just trying to enjoy memes or easy-going articles. It’s like almost every conversation has it, somewhere. It’s on the radio. It’s on the tv. It’s literally everywhere and it’s so over-saturated and tiring and stressful."

It sucks being surrounded by everyone, except some kids my age, that all think in ways I don’t and berate me for my viewpoints. My family will lecture me on *anything* political or religious so I never engage in the topic anymore because I’m tired of having someone else’s ideas be constantly forced upon me hoping I’ll turn into them too. 

I’ve had a guy come into my workplace who wore a shirt that on the back of it said “Vote Democrat if you’re a traitor” or some bs. It’s rather upsetting"

A good amount of adults already act like children anyways, but in a very obnoxious and harmful way.

Some of that is ironically caused by toxic masculinity. Men who think they’re tough shit and belittle other men who have softer habits, only to then be the ones who act the most immature, childish, and insecure out of anyone else out there."

This is much better considering half the adults I ever meet act like children or toddlers anyways, nothing wrong with a stuffed animal if it helps someone sleep at night. Far better than people who go out and can’t take no for an answer and throw a tantrum, especially when the motivation for it for some people is toxic masculinity."
