Like everyone else, after building the first one, I knew it wasn't going to be my last, and rather than measuring out fret spaces every time, I bought a 25"" scale template. So the only reason I'm committed to the scale is because I'm lazy and have invested equipment into it.

The boxes I use are about 7""x10"", and that seems to be the perfect size at that scale for me. On my most recent build, with the bridge 1.25 inches from the back of the box, I have the last [3 of 21 frets on the body](https://imgur.com/8xIehG8), and the pickup poles at the 24th fret location. The last part was unplanned and completely fortuitous (along with its [center of gravity](https://imgur.com/gallery/ySUbYeM)) and only discovered when I was learning about pinch harmonics."

AskReddit,fdr4nrk,t1_fdqj7f5,1578679436.0,"Are you willing to pay more for that option?

When a state deregulates liquor sales, it wouldn't just forgo the profit it was making selling directly to consumers, right? The profit from sales gets converted to taxes and licensing fees charged to private sector retailers who then pass those costs onto their customers. Now you have a new layer of middlemen (retailers) who have to make their margin of profit, and that dictates prices will go up. I'm not saying this is necessarily bad - some people are willing to pay more for easier access - but just know that it doesn't come for free.

Washington State is a perfect example. Costco had a very heavy lobbying hand in Washington State's vote to deregulate liquor sales (makes sense, they are headquartered there), and liquor prices have definitely gone up since then. [But so have sales overall](https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2017/dec/13/5-years-after-privatization-washington-liquor-sale/), so that's a win for the state and retailers, but consumers remain mixed. While some like the greater availability, others complain about easier access to minor. And you have to ask yourself, is a growth in sales (which means a larger consumption) of liquor a good thing?"
