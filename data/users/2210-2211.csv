anime,feu6umt,t1_feu5lm3,1579383707.0,Isn't the whole point that this is grasping at straws to try and save an important hero?? I'm pretty sure she wouldn't mind a rude awakening if she got the chance to maybe save someone's life that helped rescue her. Y'know since the whole reason she went back to overhaul instead of running away with lemillion was because she wanted people to not die for her...

Warhammer40k,fd457a4,t3_ejzx8o,1578164552.0,"Personally even though they looks cool I feel like vox isn't worth the 5 points. Plasma guns are best guns but snipers and grenade launchers are good too. Commander is best to have just Las pistol and chainsword since they don't cost any points and you dont really want them too close to the combat anyhow, just giving orders. Heavy weapons I'd say get 3 extra big bases (£3 from gw and free delivery if done to a local store) with one guy crouching and one standing you can build 6 heavy weapons teams total. I recommend 3 mortars and at least one autocannon and one heavy bolter, you can build 3 missile launchers too with both guys standing and shouldering the launcher getting 9 heavy weapons teams from one box. (Obviously you'll need extra guardsmen bodys to make them though but they are pretty cheap)

Edit: Also add on, las cannon bad performance vs cost unless you use veterans team for the +1"

Warthunder,fcdszke,t1_fcdm3w5,1577613432.0,Having a dead engine and being on the ground should force you out so you can't do what you said. However I still feel like you should be able to stay in until you crash/land to at least have a last attempt to get a kill.
