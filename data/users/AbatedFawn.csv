If you were over confident you may even all cheer together.  Everyone wore bright clothing that was very fashionable and fought in open fields.  Those were mastered reloading and executed orders quickest usually rose on top.  But after the 1850's, killing was too quick.  Too deadly.  Trenches became a thing, artillery was deployed out of sight and cavalry was now useless.  And it only got worse after.  Modern war today is all camouflage and hiding.
