Doesn’t matter.

>Your rental is someone else’s property so they can do whatever the hell they please with it

Legally they can’t, and rentals have to ensure a standard of quality to be rented. Believe it or not, affordability is a part of standard of quality. There is no reason that a landlord should be allowed to gouge his renters. As you’ve pointed out, he already owns the place, he doesn’t have to worry about shit.

>the property just became significantly more valuable, meaning his property taxes just tripled

Oh boo hoo, the poor landlord has to take on extra costs to help the place he lives while not being able to gouge people for the audacity of living someplace that a corporation decided to move to. How terrible. If it’s that bad, maybe he shouldn’t be in the business.

>How many million dollar apartment complexes do you own?

Irrelevant.

>Would you charge 1/3 market value?

If people were already living there, yes. It’s their home just as much as it would be my property. Any rent increases would only come after discussions with the renters to ensure they could afford it without having to stress their funds. Because I have empathy.

>Would you pay thousands of dollars on taxes annually out of altruism?

Yes. It’s literally my duty as an inhabitant of the United States.

>You’re not entitled to prime real estate

You’re not entitled to deprive people of their homes because you’re greedy.

>If you cannot afford your rent, move

You still haven’t answered the question “how.”

>Lol. How much extra in taxes do you pay?

Currently? None. But that’s because I’m a student who works a near minimum wage job. And you know what? I don’t even want a tax refund, nor would I mind paying a 50% tax rate if it meant everybody got affordable healthcare and the poor actually got protection from predators like you. I don’t need it and the money could be better spent on people actually in need.

>You contribute nothing.

I mean, you’re wrong. I’m a tax paying citizen like anyone else. The difference here is I don’t feel entitled to fuck people over because I’m not a greedy fuck.

>Who are you to determine how much people owe to the government?

Oh I’m sorry, I thought this was a democracy. You know, where everybody has a voice. Besides that, I’m a citizen of the United States of America, the greatest damned nation on the face of the planet. That’s what entitles me to a voice in how our government is run. And I can assure you I have a lot more patriotism and love for this country than a greedy dwarf like yourself has for yours. While you’d kick a baby if it meant you’d get an extra penny, I’m willing to give up no less than half my income if it meant everybody could live a comfortable life without fearing unexpected expenditures and bankruptcy.

>You’re just some random propagandized kid

Twenty, actually. And not propagandized, I’ve just chosen to be selfless. Like a good Christian.

>Also, why do you think the government would invest in education or infrastructure?

Oh I don’t. I know that people like you would hate for kids to get a decent education. No, I was pointing out worthwhile things the government *could* invest in if it had all that extra money.

>$20.4 billion would fund the government for about 43 hours.

And if distributed to every school in the US would amount to over $150,000 for each one. That’s $150,000 used to pay teachers bonuses, buy books, upgrade facilities, buy school supplies, subsidize lunches for poor students. That’s a lot of money that could be put to good use. That says more about the sheer size and inefficiency of the government than how little money $20.4 billion is.

>Between then and other giant corporations in the area, things are fantastic.

Obviously not if

>the idiot kids [who live] here think Walmart is awful and the Waltons are evil

And by the way, just because you get some benefit from something doesn’t mean you can’t criticize it. The German populace spent most of WWII in comfort (aside from the occasional bombing raid and casualty reports), yet the Nazis were still evil. Feudalism provided a stable order, yet the peasants still lived in poverty. The PRC has a growing economy, yet they’re still becoming increasingly draconian. The robber barons of the late 1800s may have brought about industrial growth, but they still abused their workers and killed strikers. You are not immune from criticism just because you’ve done something good.

>I do have empathy but only for people who actually try

Unless they’re poor

>and the children of degenerates

At least you’d have empathy for any hypothetical offspring of yours

>Most people like you don’t put forth any effort

Let’s see, I was in band and the debate club in high school and graduated in the top 25% of my class, immediately went off to university where I will admit I didn’t try. I flunked out after two semesters, so I went to a local college and studied for three semesters while improving my grades, paying for it myself as I went along. I worked part time at Marble Slab for about half a year before quitting and got another job a couple months later. There, I also worked part time until summer hit and I went full time. Once school started back up, I still worked in excess of thirty hours a week there, not to mention only taking nine days off the entire year I worked there, and those were to see family. Just three days ago I walked for an hour and 50 minutes to find my class at dark at the university I just started attending. I’m currently paying for an apartment with my own money. So no, I’m pretty sure I trying now. But nice strawman.

>You’re living off your folks

>[blew] all [my] money on frivolities like restaurants, intoxicants, or luxury items.

Free trade is not Jesus, don’t worship it. And yes, I do, if the “free” market results in the harming of people.

>because you won’t get off your ass and work a couple more shifts a week?

I point you back to me working an almost full time job while being a student.

Not that time I committed genocide on Egypt, conquered most of Eurasia in the name of the Soviet Union, invaded the galaxy as Stone Age Primitives, or broke the game and built up the military to crush rebels in the Second American Civil War?

>Those are the two options, right? Live on some of the most valuable few square miles in the world or become homeless. No way they could just move somewhere more affordable.

Where? Where can they move? Where do they have a place to live? Where do they have a job? Where do they get the money to pay for moving services? Where to they get the money to replace any items they can’t take? For new insurance? They should rip up their entire lives just because Amazon decided to move to their city? What kind of fucked up world view is that? Why should Amazon be valued more than hundreds of thousands of people? Why should an employee of Amazon, who likely is going to be moving to the new location rather than already living there, get priority over the people who were there for God knows how long? Why should we deify corporations and demonize the poor? Hell, why should we demonize the middle class? Because they can be renters too. My parents certainly were for nearly half a decade. So tell me, how much money should someone be born with to be considered human to you? Because you obviously don’t care about poor or middle class people. You’ve made your willingness to fuck them over for a company who headquarters for Europe in Luxembourg to minimize taxes, who treats their employees like shit, who drives out people who have much more rights to their homes than Amazon, and who have no regard for the consequences of their actions until people complain, well known.

So what? He dodges taxes like the plague. He refuses to pay an equitable amount to the society he lives and does business in. Let’s say no new government programs are added.

Then in my Austria game they literally didn’t have an army for decades after I PU’d them. Plus their position is just bad. Austria gets claims/a free PU, both the Ottomans and Poland want to kill them (likely Bohemia too), and they start out with Orthodox provinces as a Catholic nation with mainly Orthodox provinces to potentially expand into.
