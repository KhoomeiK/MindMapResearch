no."

when it comes to ""Bomb brown kids y/n?' why the fuck would you collaborate with that choice at all. The answer is no, no no no a thousand times no, all this fucking stupid shit about it being  a 'game' you have to play is ridiculous. 

> Trump's impeachment was only possible because the Democrats actually won. 

His approval is higher than it ever was, its a fucking dog and pony show, it will change absolutely nothing."
SubredditDrama,fgmlkua,t1_fgm06ya,1580927057.0,"She gets cred when she stops funding his bullshit. It's an aesthetic choice, not a moral one. She doesn't fucking care about trump, her life is the same regardless. Meanwhile: she and her other 'resistance' friends fund the horrors happening at the border, his foreign policy ventures (that will, and have, killed innocents, including children). I hate Nancy, and I'll hate her until she dies. She's the exact kind of problem with this country - being nonplussed by the horror we export but being outraged at the aesthetic problems with trump. Despicable."

Yes they do lol. Rush, of all people, certainly fucking does. I'm glad he'll be pumped full of chemo and shrivel and dry like a maggot left out in the sun. Fuck him, no compassion. No mercy."
