exmormon,fffejir,t1_ffe71xm,1579882230.0,"No worries about the rant.  Comrodery is nice.

Glad to hear he is nicer and will listen to you.  That's a few positive moves to build on.  Not paying tithing is huge and do you drink coffee in the home? Like you have a coffee maker on your counter?  

I couldn't imagine. My middle child wanted to buy me a Kurig for my birthday a couple years ago and she said no. It used to be if I had a single drink of alcohol then I didn't get to come home that night.  Eventually it got to I could only drink outside and never in the house. Alcohol was only ok in the house if it was already in my tummy.  I am pretty happy drunk. It just makes me jovial and then sleepy.

It took years to build up to that point. Recently it got to where if she was out and about she could buy me a cup off coffee or bring me home an arnold palmer.  If we are at the local pizza place she didn't care if I had a beer with my pie.  After a tragic life event she came home from sprouts with a six pack for me.  Had to drink and keep it in the garage but it was a nice gesture.  She had already served me with divorce papers before the life event happened."
exmormon,ffdqtwm,t1_ffd230z,1579826714.0,"I think that was meant to be a reply to my question about you not being able to ask him to partner with you until you're not dependent on his income.

I get it completely. Gotta pick your battles.  Somehow my stay at home soon to be ex-wife hold all the cards. She isn't a partner or ally. It's her way or I'm the mean one. I never got to speak openly about church history and operated under a gag order for years to keep the peace.  Peace keeping in a shitty marriage is awful, eggshells all the time.  


It should be a togetherness, progress and partnership. I know now I deserve better, so do you."

mormon,ffa4mvw,t1_ffa2qyp,1579727793.0,">Even though she calls out exmormon men specifically, we all can still learn from some introspection.

This 100%. Of course she's making blanket statements about all exmo men, yet the behaviors that were indoctrinated from youth within the social construct of mormon patriarchy are not so easy to shed.  Sadly what Mette shares has happened and is happening not all, maybe not most but enough times to be a problem. I've been to a few exmo social gatherings and see men huddled together, peacocking their previous leaderships callings or mission roles.  It's dumb.

I can only look inward to my own behaviors and seek to improve and better myself."
