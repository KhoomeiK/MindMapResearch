AmItheAsshole,fesrltv,t3_eqa7n3,1579368286.0,"YTA, for screaming at a stranger on a bus instead of just acting like an adult. Inconveniences happen, you dont need to throw a temper tantrum."
AmItheAsshole,fekh93k,t1_fekh64l,1579200003.0,You're right. I can accept I'm TA for that because I'm setting myself up. Thanks for helping me out :)
AmItheAsshole,fekgiqk,t1_fekgesb,1579199568.0,He always says he wants to reschedule. I stupidly believe him I guess.
AmItheAsshole,fekchss,t1_fekbo6d,1579197173.0,Thank you :)
AmItheAsshole,fekchdk,t1_fekaiog,1579197166.0,Thank you so much for your insight.

AmItheAsshole,feka54b,t1_fek9zac,1579195784.0,"That's what really set me off. I felt like I was being harsh at first but when he mentioned the ""bad situation"" thing I completely lost it and went off. He gave up the fight after that and that's why I felt like I went too far. But thank you for your insight, it helped."
AmItheAsshole,fek9vy9,t1_fek9nit,1579195635.0,"It isn't harsh, really is the truth. I'm getting married in a year and a half and I basically wanted to reconnect so that he could be there. He wont be walking me down the aisle but I still put out the invite."
AmItheAsshole,fek9ez8,t1_fek9aok,1579195353.0,"Thank you, I felt like I was making excuses for him and I really needed to hear that."

PublicFreakout,fdynsu3,t1_fdyndbx,1578781790.0,If you really don't get it right now I cant help you. Sorry.
PublicFreakout,fdykqyq,t1_fdyfidd,1578780820.0,This person literally put on a skirt then went out and starting hitting a woman. Something tells me he's not really a trans woman.
PublicFreakout,fdy63n4,t1_fdy5x8i,1578776505.0,Fair enough
PublicFreakout,fdy38b4,t1_fdy32je,1578775581.0,Okay bye :)
PublicFreakout,fdxkwhv,t1_fdxktu2,1578769948.0,"I've already said it before and I'll say it again. If you are going to portray as a woman and then harass other women for their portrayal as a woman, don't expect respect for how you portray yourself."
PublicFreakout,fdxkqdf,t1_fdxki4r,1578769842.0,"If you are going to identify as a woman and then going around harassing women for the way they portray themselves, then dont expect people to respect how you portray yourself. It's that simple."
PublicFreakout,fdxer6o,t1_fdxelmx,1578768056.0,"Putting on a skirt doesn't make you trans. If you're gonna dress up as a woman then harass women, you've completely disregarded the fact that you want to be a woman. Its counterintuitive."

Scams,fdieeps,t3_elefcu,1578441026.0,Someone did this to me as my grandpa. That I lived with at the time.
AmItheAsshole,fdh4jv2,t1_fdgxhbd,1578415230.0,"As much as the behavior is wrong, the biggest point people are really trying to make is that someone in their 30s knows better than a barely teenage boy/girl and they should act mature."
JUSTNOMIL,fdf6usv,t1_fdek931,1578354664.0,"Not so much, but I try at least."

AmItheAsshole,fdes0fr,t3_ekwwcq,1578345392.0,"NTA- I'm in a similar boat. I have a stepdad I don't want walking me and a biological dad I don't want walking me either. A lot of bad history with both. I wanted my uncle to, and he agreed, but after criticizing my decision to not choose my stepdad. Due to that he won't be either. As of now, no one is, and I'm perfectly okay with that even if my family isn't. This is your day, you make the decisions."
JUSTNOMIL,fdefw67,t1_fdedgcj,1578338143.0,"I really dont know why she did it. She didn't have to and I had gone a couple years without them before. I'm grateful for them of course, but being involved with my family means more than gifts."
JUSTNOMIL,fde9jxi,t1_fde9fm6,1578334170.0,"Things were good for a while. It isn't a mother/daughter relationship, more like an adult/adult acquaintance situation. We at least get along. But just seeing the pictures where she has one specifically just hugging my sister really hit me hard for some reason."
comedyheaven,fde68sx,t3_ekup3x,1578332088.0,I'm gonna go ahead and speak for most women and say that is not more attractive.
relationships,fd5750t,t1_fd3znu8,1578174866.0,I can see your point. I agree things have changed and that could absolutely be the more common thing.
iamverybadass,fd3oy5w,t3_ejrcx7,1578160439.0,What the fuck
awfuleverything,fd3gr4y,t3_ejq4kq,1578158212.0,Oh. I hate this.
relationships,fd3be22,t1_fd33k0u,1578156595.0,"We were 17 and 19 and both had previous sexual history. We just knew there was something different about each other and wanted to create something special before introducing sex. I also was dealing with sexual abuse trauma at the time and he completely understood and waited for me to be ready. When I was ready, he wasn't quite yet so I waited for him too. Now we're 20 and 22 and engaged and I'm happy we waited. I understand your viewpoint as sex is way more important to some than others. I dont judge that at all, it's your body and your choice."
relationships,fd3afv7,t1_fd1aual,1578156360.0,"Thsn they should date women with high sex drives, not women with past sexual issues that he knows could hinder the process.
Edit: spelling"
relationships,fd0txwf,t1_fd0r9ym,1578123716.0,"I literally never said that. I said its dependent on the person and the relationship and JUST said I dont care if you wait 2 years or 2 days. I said I dont think its excessive. I never once tried to tell you you were wrong or you had to do it my way. I didn't get mad at all when you said waiting like I did doesn't work for you. I said, again, that its dependent on the person and the relationship. You took all of this so personally and I was trying to share my experience to give some insight on the other side and have a discussion, not listen to your bullshit. I'm done with this now, so have a great night."
relationships,fd0qkdr,t1_fd0pfk3,1578122418.0,"You dont get to determine at what time and what rate someone should be healing. We have NO IDEA how she feels or the progress that she has made. Also, dont try and make me sound like some creepy asshole just because you took everything I said personally to your life. I don't care whether you want to have sex 2 days in or 2 years in. You put in your opinion and I put in mine just the same. I said that neither of them are wrong in their actions and that it all depends on the person and the relationship. But it's not his place or yours to determine how far she should be in her progress or what sexual acts she should/shouldn't be doing based on her trauma. I've said generalized statements that literally have nothing to do with you personally, so if you felt attacked idk what to tell you."
relationships,fd0n3m1,t1_fd0mrcn,1578121111.0,"But he's known this from the start. He knew she wasn't interested in it and pursued a relationship anyway. Like I said, it's not wrong if he wants to move on. But she's not wrong for wanting to wait. It's not excessive to me or many others. Just depends on who you are and what you expect in a relationship. Dont want to wait? Dont date someone who explicitly stated they dont want to have sex."
AmItheAsshole,fd0klp6,t1_fcz22iy,1578120162.0,It isn't dietary but it can swell up your throat if you drink water in severe cases.
relationships,fd0glyv,t1_fczupg7,1578118496.0,"It really isn't. My fiance and I waited a year and a half to make sure we were ready and it was really one of the best decisions we made. We've been together almost 3 years now and it's nice to know that our bond was there a long time before a sexual bond was introduced. If he doesn't want to wait, that's fine. He can move on if he wants to. But it isn't excessive to not want to have sex for an extended amount of time when you have had bad experiences, speaking from a personal experience."

AmItheAsshole,fcp3eqj,t3_ei9igg,1577849257.0,"ESH. He's the asshole for breaking a super expensive gift and expecting a new one, and you're an asshole for blatantly laughing in his face hysterically. You're an adult, act like one."
relationship_advice,fcnp18d,t1_fcnos6b,1577815712.0,"There's a definite lack of communication on both sides. And you're right, we only have his side. Let's hope she doesn't find this."
relationship_advice,fcnohm2,t1_fcnoav5,1577815395.0,"I can see your point. Her behavior was strange, I agree. But maybe she just had a rough night at work? It's something that should've just been talked out instead of jumping to a nasty conclusion. I hope that she didn't do it and they can work this out. But it's obvious he's got some major insecurity issues and she isn't good at communicating."
relationship_advice,fcno0bl,t1_fcnmpz8,1577815123.0,"I would be a little aggravated where she's at though too. If your boyfriend comes at you and tries to confront you about why your mouth tastes a certain way, he's kinda insinuating that she sucked the guy off. So her saying ""you think I sucked off my boss?"" Isn't too wild since that's kinda what he hinted at with his questioning."
Cringetopia,fcl894g,t3_ehmnp4,1577741946.0,God that's so disgusting looking.
Vent,fckj9a0,t1_fckitc8,1577726542.0,"It makes me so mad. I'm not crazy thin but I dont weigh enough or have a figure to insinuate that im pregnant. Even if you're a heavier set person, it's not okay to ask people that. I dont understand why people think it's okay to come up to others and ask that. My clients I can understand more as they dont really understand the gravity of what they're asking, but I cant say it didn't hurt my feelings a little. It fucks with my self esteem a lot in terms of my weight."
