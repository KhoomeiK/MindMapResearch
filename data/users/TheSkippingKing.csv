jerseycity,ffwlsjc,t1_ffwhrlj,1580304963.0,"Ok. This is based on my best reading of Jersey City Municipal Code, chapter 260. (https://library.municode.com/nj/jersey_city/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=CH260RECO) 

It looks like I got the 4% vs CPI backwards and in fact the landlord must use the smaller number. Is that all, or have I made other mistakes? We’re all here to share info and learn. I am happy to adjust my understanding with new information, but you haven’t shared anything so far, just told a lot of people they are wrong. Can you elaborate and give us better answers?

>A. At the expiration of a lease or at the termination of a lease of a periodic tenant, no landlord may request or receive a percentage increase in rent which is greater than 4% or the percentage difference between the consumer price index three months prior to the expiration or termination of the lease and three months prior to the commencement of the lease term, whichever is less."
shakespeare,ffvc4sw,t1_ffv8n89,1580260641.0,"Fair. 

One thing to try, just as an exercise perhaps, is trust your instinct here. Run through it a few times as if your motivation is that of a poet, to communicate with ease and beauty. Really search for the words. Maybe it’s a form of catharsis, like you have something inside you that *needs* to come out, or maybe you just want interpretation and advice. Either way, you need the listener to really understand the weight of this dream and it’s sublime impact on you, and words are your tool to get there."
technology,ffv9seu,t1_ffv8v48,1580259068.0,"No, they are not talking about anything different than what I have.  The specific company mentioned allows their employees to have the exact same chip, for access to the building and for authentication at their workstations.

There is absolutely no such thing as an implantable tracking microchip. It would need to be charged up regularly. Even regular external tracking is difficult for this reason. That’s why the company Tile works the way it does, instead of just selling tracking chips for your stuff. I *am* very savvy on this technology and keep up with it closely, for obvious reasons. As I said, this tech would be the holy grail for lost pets, lost items, shipping, etc. We don’t even have a separately powered chip in our phones that serves this purpose. It’s just not possible yet.

If I were concerned about tracking, in any case, I could fully rewrite my entire chip with any modern smartphone, and I would be off the grid."
technology,ffv7cns,t1_ffv625h,1580257421.0,"I don’t really understand what you mean about “if anybody has access to it”. It’s not a powered device that someone can just look up my location with a code. I can’t turn it off because it’s never “on”. It’s just an RFID chip. It takes a lot of power to scan one without the user directly engaging, and even then you have to corral them into a fairly tight space. Examples are loss prevention gates at the library, or the gates that track athletes’ split times in a triathlon. There is no meaningful way for anyone to use this chip to “track me”. 

If there were a way to do that, then every lost pet with a microchip could be easily found. That’s not the case though, because the technology simply can’t be used for that purpose. The chip just holds information in the case that it is held very close to a powered partner device."

shakespeare,ffv3x9n,t3_ev7ylx,1580255092.0,"In general when searching for monologues, it’s really best to pick one where the motive clearly jumps out at you immediately. Monologues where we tell stories are often poor audition pieces because they either are a pay-off for what we have already been through (Oh that’s his big secret! No wonder he’s been acting this way!), or like in this one, they have a pay-off later in the play.

May I ask how/why you came to choose this monologue?"

So if you sign a 2 year lease there will not be an increase until you re-sign, but your landlord will be entitled to around an 8% increase. If the CPI (https://www.bls.gov/cpi/) has increased by more than 4% / year, the landlord is entitled to use the higher number, but that has not been the case for some time.

ukulele,fffdnzr,t1_fff7j3e,1579881669.0,"Yes, I think to take jazz seriously on the uke you need to learn all your different inversions and movable shapes. It’s important to remember when working from Real Books that they are giving you the overall idea, not telling you exactly what to play. You don’t *need* to play every extension as it’s written. A G6 can be played as just G, as Gmaj7, as G(add9), etc. It’s a major chord built off the tonic and that’s all that matters. So for an easy arrangement with some movement in it, you could play:

    Gmaj7: 0222
    Em7: 0202
    A9: 0102
    D7: 2025

I like using the A9 chord because it helps support the melody, which includes a B at that point. To be closer to the actual chords given though, my first instinct would probably be try to highlight the descending line E-D-C#-C here by playing:

    G6: 4237
    Em7: 4435
    A7: 2434
    D7: 2223

There are a ton of ways you can do it without repeating voicings. You just need to decide what kind of movement you need/want. The other things to consider when arranging are that if you are singing, you really get 5 notes to play with, so you sometimes want to support the melody but sometimes want to leave the melody note out in lieu of an extra color note. The [Lyle Ritz Ukulele Masters](https://www.halleonard.com/product/695609/jumpin-jims-ukulele-masters-lyle-ritz) arrangements take great advantage of this. Also, you can have movement within the chord, so if you need to you can play 

    G6: 4237 - 4235
    Em7: 0202 - 4435
    A7: 6757 - 2434
    D7: 2223- 3223

Some of those are boring changes with no real extra notes, but they show off the point. You can play the chord twice with a different voicing each time, or just create a little riff on top of it, and sometimes that helps you fill in extra notes or create the movement you want.

And yeah, jumping around the neck is sometimes necessary to get a real stride in the bass. It just takes practice, but a cool thing about the uke is that we are actually all pretty well trained to listen to close harmony with the melody on bottom, or second from the top. It was a standard way of arranging and we hear it in old-timey vocal arrangements all the time. Think “White Christmas” or Barbershop quartet style singers, and you’ll understand why the melody doesn’t always need to be on top and the root doesn’t always need to be on bottom, and in turn it shows off why the uke reminds many people of that type of music.

I don’t mean to say he is right, but it could be how he is *feeling*, since that’s what you asked. 

As for Judgement, that really does seem to be where you are at. Not “judgmental” in a negative sense, but simply weighing both sides and trying to reach the right option. This is not a rational process like I would expect from Justice; You must rely or your intuition and trust your spirit.

The 9 of pentacles tells me that if you choose to keep trying, you’ll need to work hard on the material reality of partnership. It won’t be an easy road, but if this is to continue, it needs to incorporate more than just passion and fun and become a joint project of genuine cultivation.

Caveat of course that reading through a screen is always suboptimal, and if something I said makes no sense at all, ignore it. Hopefully it gives you some ideas or opens some avenues of meditation for you."

For a better explanation of the math:

It will never be option 1 (Assuming your variables are all above 0) because if a set of numbers is multiplied and any one of them is increased, the total will always go up.

For the same reason, you can ignore variable A in the decision, because it never changes. If you maximize B*C, then you maximize the total. 

You are are either adding an extra .1 of B, plus .1 of the 1.0 you already added; or you are adding .25 of C.

B/10 + 1/10 = C/4

B*(4/10) + 4/10 = C

Because we are still working with raw numbers though that haven’t been reduced yet, the extra constant needs to be multiplied by 100. That’s how we get to:

B*(4/10) + 40 = C"

That’s precisely the info you asked for, and combined with the info in the article tells you exactly how much they would have to pay on average for laying off an employee, which in turn shows that your original comment was complete BS. 

The numbers don’t lie. If you can’t read them, that’s not my problem."

The article even says they were motivated by the situation with Toys R Us. Do you suppose Toys R Us had mostly long term employees that were with them for many years? Of course not. It’s exactly the type of retail work that has high turnover.
