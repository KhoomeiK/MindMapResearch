space,ff8by4h,t1_ff7nykl,1579672337.0,"this sub might as well rename itself to spacex. yes they have more testing, crew dragon is not ready ""to be sent to ISS today."" we all want american space companies to succeed but the fanboyism is just ridiculous. both companies have had test failures while getting their vehicles ready

its a conspiracy theory that anyone is going to delay spacex to allow boeing to go first.  there's 2 active investigations into boeing as mentioned in this article. nasa wont let starliner go anywhere until those are resolved"

LSD,feijale,t3_epbx7x,1579139832.0,"whatever person or thing or website told you it’s 160, how do you know? what have they done to earn your trust if anything. how do you even know it’s lsd? the test kits tell you some part of what’s been tested contains lsd but not that it’s what dose is advertised or exclusively lsd. 

take every trip report you read here because they are all so specific on micrograms with a grain of salt"

LSD,fecw5r5,t3_eoby24,1578987008.0,i greatly enjoy drinking alcohol on lsd. it can help ease the come up. wine beer shots i’m not picky. drugs and alcohol are a match made in heaven. but there reaches a point like around the peak where i’m usually unable to drink anything
LSD,fecw29b,t3_eohz60,1578986896.0,no. you may want to see an eye doctor. aside from HPPD once it has left your body you will not be under any effects.

news,fdlgg24,t1_fdksree,1578523485.0,this kind of chicken little messaging that it’s a “world war” isn’t going to convince anyone. especially this guy at work
space,fdj1ngr,t1_fdhpmov,1578456134.0,"there's multiple categories of base stations supported. 5g is supposed to handle high density use cases much better, think football game, music festivals, where you have 50,000 devices in a small area. and 5g handles wide area base stations with many-mile range. 5g also builds on 4g/lte the same way you can fall back to 3g today.

not all towers in the USA are getting adding 5g support before a network is going to say ""we have a 5g network"". even tmobile."

news,fdiu5ts,t1_fdigbyc,1578451107.0,these aren’t the only 2 alternatives and this has nothing to do with scientists. climate activists rarely even have solutions. it’s just “raising awareness.”
technology,fdg7cs9,t1_fdfyk4c,1578383046.0,yea there’s a few ways to look at this. a family farmer is much more efficient today than a peasant farmer 200 years ago. but could a corporate farmer make even more food on less land? what’s the goal here? maintain someone’s way of living or grow food efficiently?

LSD,fco5nt1,t1_fcjwyqh,1577824552.0,like 4-4.5g shrooms. no stereotypical horror / demon visuals. i’ve never really hallucinated things that weren’t there on lsd or shrooms.  i’ve had geometric patterns eclipse my whole vision but mostly it’s visual distortion
LSD,fcijoyv,t1_fchohiw,1577663684.0,"i got emotionally overwhelmed, tried to resist the effects, stuck in a thought loop about “everything at once,” combination of laughing and crying interchangeably, then really lost it for a couple hours. i laid down in a bed, saw myself in the 3rd person from the ceiling, saw myself walking through the room changing into all the different people there at once. a good chunk of that time i don’t even remember. not exactly a great experience, the only real take away i had from that is i didn’t have the emotion stability (i was 18) i could have. it did change me because i was able to work on that and come out better and more grounded on the other side."
LSD,fciiwvp,t1_fchr81m,1577663302.0,really depends on your confidence level. if you have any concerns just do a half. otherwise sounds like the whole 1 will be a great trip
LSD,fcgn98f,t3_eh4dz6,1577641942.0,"all “lsd” is in quotes. someone told you it was lsd, a test may say it contains some amount of it, but it’s all trusting someone else’s words."
LSD,fcgmju5,t3_eh4jkm,1577641756.0,mdma drains your serotonin. lsd operates on serotonin receptors. i would give it some time between serotonin drugs for best effect
LSD,fcghp4r,t1_fcfv1dy,1577640165.0,this is horrible advice. one tab is definitely tripping and pretty much the most common dose people take
LSD,fcghacp,t3_eh7t4v,1577640005.0,i waited a year and took a small dose. it was a major confidence loss to have the bad trip and huge boost to be able to go through it again. i took 5 total trips after the bad one before reaching the dose i had the bad trip on

LSD,fcggt2b,t3_eh80mu,1577639805.0,anything is possible. you’re buying random strips of paper off the internet from someone you’ll never meet. lots of things can pass an erlich test. maybe everything you’ve taken for the last 5 years was some RC and this was your first real LSD. it’s literally all blind faith
LSD,fcgg0k4,t3_eh87gj,1577639586.0,"unless you are producing your own lsd you never have any idea what the strength of any tab or dose is. ever. you are taking this information from an unreliable source. it’s always a leap of faith.

the best way is to buy in bulk one single source of it, hope they are dosed equally, and adjust based on your past experiences. 

keep this in mind when you see trip reports on this site. people saying “i’m on 300ug and doing 600ug next time” it’s all based on complete guesses and trust in an untrustworthy source. don’t measure a trip by the alleged micrograms, measure it in comparison to others you have done"
LSD,fcgfkpe,t3_eh8a44,1577639411.0,stick together. accept what you encounter. don’t lose your keys.

space,fbutp4o,t1_fbtq5r3,1577120197.0,you’re listening to their PR. of course they are going to make as much positivity out of this as possible. this is completely separate from how they internally are going to handle this. i’d say give them time to asses what happened and see how they react
