rant,ffbzxhs,t3_eso302,1579787944.0,"Can relate, my voice is a little low for a girl, so I’ll be playing with some people and once they use the “he/his” pronouns I’ll correct them and they’ll start treating me nicer. Once I was playing free for all, and I killed this one guy and he starting raging and saying “this boy is trash hes so bad” to which I corrected him, and he started treating me nicer.

Also, please, don’t say “you’re good for a girl” to me."

Also, YTA. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes."
unpopularkpopopinions,febo66b,t3_eo6hv2,1578960959.0,"Well I guess as a Mark enthusiast here’s my take..

I completely understand if you don’t like Mark’s personality  (or any idol’s for that matter), but calling him untalented is just wrong? In 127, a group of mostly lead dancers, Mark stands out the most to me. He knows how to fit with the music and that alone is talent. 

Mark is literally the best rapper in SM, and there’s no argument against that lol. Maybe you prefer Taeyong, but he’s overall a better rapper.

You can find a lot of clips of Mark singing, and personally I really like it. Again, you don’t have to like his singing, or him, but you’re kind of coming off as rude by just denying his talent and how hard he works.  He moved from a foreign country, debuted at 17 (he wasn’t even fluent in Korean) and proceeded to debut 3 more times. SM knows how talented and hard working he and thats why he’s debuted 4 times."
offmychest,fe5wu64,t3_enrwa2,1578876721.0,yup. can think of one guy. i love him but like he really doesnt feel the same way
unpopularkpopopinions,fdptfqg,t3_emifig,1578639785.0,"Upvoted for unpopularity.

Like some of the other comments mentioned, I think they all excell at different things. Jungkook, well he’s kinda good at everything, RM  and Suga are good at producing and rapping, like you said, Jhope excells at dancing, is a pretty good vocalist, and a good rapper. V is also good at singing, you can hear his very large range, he can sing really deep or higher if he wants to. He’s also a good dancer as well, and well honestly Jin is good at acting AND singing. I can understand why you wouldnt like his voice, but I don’t like Joy’s voice but I can still acknowledge thats its good.  Jimin is very good at dancing as well, he was at the top of his class in his acadamy iirc. He’s also a pretty solid vocalist."

offmychest,fdcyift,t1_fdcybhi,1578288109.0,"I’m just a person on the internet, but I really do hope you feel better one day. You were put here for a purpose and by killing yourself you can’t fufill that purpose. Phone someone in real life, talk to them, let it all out. If you can’t find anyone, therapy works as well. Don’t let the wrong side win."
offmychest,fdcy584,t1_fdcxzet,1578287782.0,"Maybe find a hobby that takes your mind off of it, something to live for. If it be a pet, a person, or just the sake of doing something."
offmychest,fdcy2gs,t3_ekp4sp,1578287715.0,"Hey, coming from someone of the same age, I know peer pressure and shit is hard to deal with, or the feeling that nothing will get better and this is the only way of dealing with it, but you’ll regret it heavily when you’re older. Just search up the statistics, you’re at a higher risk of lung cancer, and a bunch of other health issues just because you made a few stupid decisions too early on. Please re evaluate yourself, and get the help you need."
offmychest,fdcxv2o,t3_ekp4xd,1578287534.0,"You’re not doing this for attention, this is a real thing with real life consequences. Killing yourself won’t stop the problem, it only makes it worse.

That being said, I think the reaosn why you’ve never experienced something traumatic is because you’ll be pushed over the edge. I’m a huge believer in fate and destiny, and I think nobody will face anything that they’re not strong enough to face. Not implying that you’re not strong, but maybe it’s a sign that, hey, life isn’t that bad. It could be worse, and focus on the positives that you have. Life will get better, it always does."

kpopthoughts,fcxoswc,t3_ejdlf3,1578067980.0,"I think the one thing that bothers me is that Heechul apparently has mentioned he wants to settle down, get married, and have kids soon. Momo is at the peak of her career, so why would she want to settle down? Also it’s not the age gap itself that bothers me, but the fact that he’s 36 while shes in her early 20s. If it was 33 and 46, sure, but it I think 23 and 36 are far away mentally more than anything. But it’s their realtionship, and we have no right to interfere"
