TooAfraidToAsk,ff5riqo,t3_erqw7u,1579607423.0,"A good psychologist is very aware of his/her inner workings. They are, and have to be, very controlled. They of course have feelings too, and having emotions is required for many therapy forms (with emotions come empathy, and empathy is an important prerequisite for this job). If they should struggle themselves with a situation, they have supervision - fellow psychologists they work with. At least in my country this is required by law.

I also believe that good chemistry between patient and therapist is required, and that a good therapist will either not take a patient or stop the treatment at some point if the chemistry is seriously wrong."

I also think fusion cells (was it fusion cells?) we're too plentyful. Very soon I had no reason to ever leave power armor. It felt like an easy game mode. And yes, I could just have played without, but it felt silly. Why would my character not use the best tools available to him?"

relationship_advice,fdxnvfo,t1_fdwv5e4,1578771027.0,"I agree that she should rethink her work Ife, but I also think the motive behind such a move matters a lot. 

As a context, I come from a culture where it was normal and expected from a woman to work. So I have no problem with that at all. On the contrary, I find the inequality in money can lead to problems in the relationship later.

But for me the motive counts. Earn more to relax family finances, take a fair share of the burden and, just maybe, take a bit of weight from the husband so that he in turn can look for a better job - sounds good. Do all that to be on the safe side in case of a divorce - I don't know, it just sounds wrong.

Maybe I am wrong, but the way you think shapes reality. If you start mentally preparing for divorce, you will have one.

As for the boundary crossing - sure that deserves serious talk, but in my eyes nothing more than that. I am together with my wife for twenty years now. She overstepped a number of boundaries of mine, as i did with her, and we had countless talks and fights. If I had started doubting the relationship at each of those points, we would have long separated. Many of the things we did to each other, had we presented to this sub, would have garnered immediate ""red flag break up"" outcries. I am happy that we didn't.
