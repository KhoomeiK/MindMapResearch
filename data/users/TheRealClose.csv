However I think these types of films deserve to be made. A story that actually hasn’t been seen by almost everyone as opposed to everything Disney regurgitates.

It’s charming and great for kids and families. Yes it would be good if the film was even better, but I think it’s hardly bad."

movies,feppfyx,t1_fepovzp,1579326945.0,I think it’s possible to have a movie in the same genre with similar tropes without it being a knockoff. The stories and characters all feel different to me.
