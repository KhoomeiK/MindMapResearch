baltimore,ffgandw,t1_ffebob0,1579902066.0,"Dude, the cops in the city are just insanely shitty at their jobs. I'm not saying all of them, but many of them I've interacted with.

Let me add some person shitty stories.

My car got hit when I was pulling out of an ally. The women accelerated into my car and didn't stop till the end of the block, because she's just a super shitty driver. She had plenty of room to stop but she can't tell the gas from the brake when she's talking on the phone. The cop they send out speaks english with such a terrible accent that it's almost impossible to understand him. He doesn't take any photos of the accident, like the skid marks that show my car was turned about 45 degrees by her hitting me, even though there was a stop sign maybe 25 feet before she got to my car. And he doesn't file the police report for weeks. Which just screws with my insurance a ton. There's a bunch of other details that were missing from the police report as well.

I also had a dual sport motorcycle stolen from my parking pad. The cop came out and took the report (I didn't figure they'd really investigate this). But I get a call like 4 weeks later from my insurance company asking why the vehicle was never put on the stolen vehicles list. Apparently the cop just forgot to do it, so if someone were to get pulled on the bike, the cop that pulled them wouldn't even know it was stolen. I called the cop but he never returned my call. And we wonder why crimes don't get solved in this city.

And my favorite happened a long time ago. I was driving to the tolls right before the tunnel. And a cop car just merges right into me, and I'm slightly ahead of him so I'm not even in his blind spot. I mash my gas and swerve so he doesn't hit me, end up right in front of him in the lane since I couldn't pull over due to people waiting in the other toll lane. The cop pulls me right after the toll booth. He asks me for my ID and yells at me ""THAT'S HOW ACCIDENTS HAPPEN"", and I told him ""Yeah, when you try and drive into people it will cause accidents"". He literally threw my license at me so hard it went past me, bounced off my passenger side window and then landed back in my lap, then he just drove off. Such professionalism.

Also my buddy got rear ended by a cop in an unmarked call. The cop insisted he didn't need to call the cops since he was one. I mean the guy paid for the damage, but he was clearly trying to cover up the fact that he had an accident and used his clout as an officer to do it.

And another guy had his car hit as he was pulling out of a parking spot (not super hard but there was some paint damage and a dent in his bumper). The guy who hit him just drove off. He called the cops, one showed up. The officer said it wasn't a hit and run and refused to file a police report or take the license plate of the guy who hit him."
AskReddit,ffg9abr,t1_ffg8udq,1579901227.0,"And women can't be?

Throughout history men have generally be considered more disposable than women. And there's a reason for that, if you need to rebuild your population, you're limited by women and not by men. The burden of providing has generally been mostly on the shoulder's of men as well.

For this, men are generally seen as having more agency than women (which is a pretty stupid view in modern society, but still extremely common, even by the ""woke"" crowd). So men's failures as a whole are generally see as the result of their choices and actions. Women's failures as a whole are much more prone to being considered the fault of things that happened to them. And children are rarely considered accountable for their failures.

It's not really because ""men are assholes"". And to think any such complex social problem boils down to something so simple is fairly naive."
AskReddit,ffg818a,t1_ffg75qj,1579900457.0,"Yeah, I think this should be remembered. Public mental health in the past meant institutionalizing people so they weren't seen in society. And some really horrific things ended up happening to many people because of this.

Then again, the modern solution is to basically put them in positions where they have no choice to commit a crime (it's illegal to sleep outside, but also we don't let you sleep anywhere else). Then to put them in prison so they are out of the public eye.

I think before we'll ever get any real solutions we as a society will have to start caring more, and caring in a way that's not ""Not in my back yard"". And I don't foresee that happening any time soon."

gadgets,ffg7c5u,t1_ffg6bfx,1579900023.0,"That link doesn't seem to show it was debunked.

However the article originally linked here I believe is a bit deceiving. It doesn't look like they were asking to be paid for the review. They wanted an affiliate link so that anyone who came to their website and clicked the link and purchased it, some amount of money would be paid to TheWireCutter. Amazon does this and lots of websites use them (youtubers tend to create affiliate links to amazon and what not).

This is technically, and I think practically as well, different than paying for a review. A company could be mainly funded by writing reviews and creating affiliate links. Their only bias would be to review things that had affiliate links vs. things that did not. Of affiliate links they may have some bias if one paid much higher than others (but I don't think that's how standard ones like amazon work, but I've never done it).

If you were just buying a review, you'd just negotiate your fee and publish because you got that. Also when some other companies got busted doing that (I feel like Gizmodo did get busted for that, but I could easily be wrong), when you buy the review you get to edit it too to make sure it says stuff you want.

That being said, it's extremely disconcerting that TheWireCutter would change their review for what looks like the lack of affiliate link."
AskReddit,ffg5ovo,t1_fffnruf,1579899005.0,"So this statistics belies another fact. Women attempt suicide more often than men do [source](https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-017-1398-8), men actually commit suicide more often. To be glib, men are better at killing themselves than women are.

This could probably stem from a few things, number one being that men and women tend to commit suicide differently. Women tend to OD on pills to kill themselves. Men are far more likely to shoot themselves. The shooting just tends to be more effective. There are probably tons of other factors as well.

baltimore,fffa2jo,t3_et2tci,1579879390.0,"My understanding, and I'm no expert, is that honest cops in corrupt police stations either get corrupted or get pushed out.

People like [Adrian Schoolcraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Schoolcraft) tried to report corruption and was forcibly institutionalized for it.

Sgt. Michael A. Wood Jr. spoke out against Baltimore Police after he retired, and he speaks to the way that new recruits are conditioned to become bad cops in Baltimore. When he tried to make things better, he got iced out.

And I can't remember the guy's name or find the story, but there was a cop who was trying to report some corruption in his police department, and he's now in jail for having sex with an under age girl who was a suspect in some crime. But there are some things about the case that are at least a little bit suspicious and back up his claim that he was setup to shut down his corruption complaints.

And then in Baltimore I personally still think there's at least some cause to believe Sean Suiter may have been setup to be killed by fellow police officers since he was about to testify about the corrupt Gun Task Force.

What I'm trying to say is starting your career as a police officer in Baltimore City, no matter how good your intentions, probably leads down a bad road. It's fine to want to be a police officer, it's good to want to help the city. But unless the BPD has been significantly reformed (and I don't see any indication that it really has) I don't think you can necessarily be a good cop in Baltimore, maybe the best you can be is a not terrible cop in Baltimore.

I got my car stuck in the snow (I had a shitty Saturn SC1 and was doing okay, until an ambulance came by so I had to pull off the road to let it pass, that was my undoing). A truck came by a few minutes later and had a chain, he pulled me out. Also the time I ran out of gas on the side of the road. Actually I moved to a new state and ran out of gas on the side of a major interstate, no one stopped to help, the high way patrol said they'd tell an officer I was there in case they passed by but they wouldn't dispatch one to me, they carry a few gallons of gas in their trunk (also you can't call an uber from the side of an interstate).

It wasn't until I walked about a quarter of a mile that somebody driving a flatbed pulled over and gave me a ride (he's a former motorcyclists and I was on my motorcycle, he saw me walking with gear). And no I don't make it a habit to run out of gas. The first time I was pretty new to driving and the car didn't has a low fuel light like I was expecting. The second time my gauge cluster was dead and I was on the way to get it repaired, apparently I didn't have as much gas as I thought.

todayilearned,ffck6z8,t1_ffc4t22,1579801205.0,"Assuming the young were harvested nearly immediately, it could never work. The energy expended to birth the young would be greater than the energy gotten from consuming them.

There are a few ways around this. Say they were eggs that took a long time to hatch. If they had some way of taking in energy from the environment, say photosynthesis or something, than they could conceivably get more energy from eating their young than they put into birthing them. Likewise if they don't eat the young immediately and the young feed off something other than their own species you could get more energy from eating them.

It's a fairly wasteful system though. It would probably work best if the young were born by the thousands (think like ants or cockroaches) and went through a parcel stage where they ate something in the environment like moss/fungus/algae where they got nice and fat. Ones that survived went through metamorphosis to become carnivorous animals and part of their diet was the pupal stage versions.

This could be used to explain how a non biodiverse ecosystem that had a lot of microbial life could sustain a large carnivore. Although it still wouldn't be very sensible.

Here's something that would make more cinematic sense. You have a benevolent alien species that comes to earth and offers humans technology and prosperity and medical services. One of these medical services is the ability to be reborn as one of them. They'll implant you with some of their DNA and it will slowly transform you. You'll go through a phase where you are like a baby alien and they have a special care facility where they'll raise you and help you adjust to being a higher life form.

But the protagonist doesn't trust them, he's had a few friends who went through with it. But after his dying uncle who raised him as his own decides to go through with the process to save his life he becomes really suspicious. When people come back from the process they look like aliens, but they know the stuff that the person use to know, but they tend to eschew their old lives and eventually move back to the alien home world saying it has more to offer than earth (and human forms can't go to the alien home world). When his uncle comes back he has all the right memories but doesn't act the way the protagonist remember, and the uncle leaves for the home world which he swore he'd never do as he promised to not abandon the protagonist (and earlier it would be established that he never breaks a promise, he probably did the transformation so he wouldn't die just so he could complete a promise).

Suspicious the protagonist breaks into a care facility, where he realizes the humans are being transformed into the alien's livestock. The ""transformed"" humans that come back are just aliens who have downloaded the memories from the humans they ate and are just there to keep people from being suspicious, which is why they always eventually opt to go back to the home world (and why human bodies are banned from there).

1. Know that love, true deep meaningful love, is not a constant feeling that just stays with you. It waxes and wanes and requires maintenance to keep going. There will be times that someone you love bores you to death, and where you'll see a stranger and think you just really want to fuck them, and there might even be times when you hate them. But that by itself does not necessarily mean the love isn't real. I only tell you this because some people have an unrealistic expectation about love. But you're pretty young and it's perfectly reasonable that you've realized after a year that while this is a nice guy, he's just not the guy for you.

2. Staying in a relationship you don't want to be in won't work. People tend to get more and more unhappy and treat the other person more and more shittier hoping they'll leave, and when they don't you just lose more respect for them.

3. You know what you need to do. You need to break up with him and not let him think that he needs to change or do something different or that you two will eventually get back together. Personally I say go hard break and no contact if it all possible, it's too easy for people to get stuck and think if they wait around long enough they'll get you back. He needs to go through the mourning process so he can rebuild and start to meet new people until he finds the right one. Don't say that you two can still be friends, that just muddies the water for everyone involved. He won't understand it, but say he's a good guy but he's just not the right guy for you, maybe in time he'll get it.

What you need to do, it is a very hard thing to do. If for nothing else, it's hard for most people to hurt someone who has only ever loved them. It's also hard for people to give up the known for the unknown. And it's hard for people to give up someone who does really love them. But just because it's hard does not mean it's not the best thing to do for both of you to be happy. And it will be hard for him, but you are unable to save him, because deep down you're not the right girl for him either.

If you grow up asian in the south you get so much shit hurl at you, that you're forced to confront the fact that most people's opinions and what they say just don't matter that much.

I think people should realize that when people say racist shit to you, it's says a lot about them and very little about you. It's how you react that says things about you.

But at the same time, you can ask that in a way that is meant to be an insult and not a question, and with a bit of context it's pretty easy to tell which way it is meant.

And in this scenario we don't know the context, so I think it's kind of hard to judge the person.

I get the feeling, and this is also something where i think men and women do feel differently about things. But to some degree, I think we just feel this way because of social expectations.

Inmotion came out with the V8F and I'd get that one if you could. But unless you have a problem with lifting the weight I'd go with the V10F personally. The V10F's speed limit of 24.5 MPH before the alarms kick on is something I bump into a fair amount. It's not that the wheel is too slow per say, but the alarm being within the range that I want to ride at, even if at the top of my range, is super annoying.

One last thing, the you don't get the full speed for the whole battery. On the V10F I think the top speed starts getting throttled when you have 60% of your battery left, this is also very annoying. So if you are trying to do 45km, the last bit of that is going to be dog slow."
