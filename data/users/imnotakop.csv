Israel,feov0e6,t1_feczai8,1579306009.0,"lol the funny thing is that some of these online far-left groups have their own dorky online communities; and, they manifest themselves in the real world. So it is kinda like they are LARPing because they act, dress, and talk like caricatures. Yeah, most of those people are real leftists and they are really anti-Semitic."
Israel,feoupwb,t1_feou09b,1579305852.0,"Which, by the way, was another deeply held belief shared among members of the far-left, anti-Zionist types I associated with. I am sure everyone here has seen that before. But it is really just so absurd these things they believe. They get angry if you say Israel has a right to self-defense. They do not believe Israelis have such a right. So I guess they are just supposed to stand there and let themselves be killed?"
Israel,feou09b,t1_feejsy7,1579305488.0,"I do not entirely agree with this analogy because the Holocaust was just so horrific. In such cases, when the moral order has been absolutely overturned, I think it is appropriate to not only kill the leadership of such atrocities but anyone who is actively supporting them. They could have a million good points to make. Would not matter.

However, I agree with the thrust of what you are saying. Simply because the Palestinians have legitimate grievances does not negate Israel's right to self-defense nor the right of the Jewish people to self-determination."
Israel,fed00zx,t1_fecyeq3,1578991890.0,"Oh yeah absolutely. They totally overlook stuff like that and do not care about it even when it is brought to their attention. Like it goes over their heads or they just figure that the brown people will sort it out or something. Too complicated. No ""white"" people to call the bad guy imperialist colonizer, etc. 

Yet the Jews ""ethnically cleansed"" Palestine. I mean give me a break. I understand, what happened was bad, as wars are generally bad, especially wars of that nature, but the Israeli War of Independence, the Naqba, whatever one wants to call it... if that was an ethnic cleansing it was the nicest ethnic cleansing in all of history. And yes I am aware that there were atrocities. But an organized ethnic cleansing? I mean we CAN however look to regimes or leaders that they see as ANTI-IMPERIALIST GODS for that shit."
Israel,feczbd6,t1_fecvzwq,1578990933.0,"Since much of the criticism I see comes from the BDS movement, I would say that I do not think that the majority of the criticism is deserved. BDS, or at least what it is promoting, has become more acceptable but at its core it is something of a cult and pretty deranged. I do not think that the majority of people who consider it as a tactic have really thought through its anti-Semitic nature and I did not while I was supporting it. I stopped supporting it even when I still was on the far-left though because of its weirdness. It will try to sell a certain package to certain groups to make them believe it is all about, say, boycotting stuff from the Occupied Territories or settlements but that always turns out to be a hook. Its leadership is completely dishonest. Sometimes you go to this shit and they will start speaking out favorably about Hamas and rocket attacks on Israel or Jewish politicians like Bernie Sanders because, I don't know, he is a Jew and while he is critical of Israel and - I think unfortunately - has been chummy with certain BDS types he does not believe that Israel should be driven into the sea and says nice things about it sometimes. So how dare he! 

I have been to meetings and groups that are not just loosely affiliated with the idea of putting pressure on Israel to grant statehood to the Palestinians or ending the Occupation but the organizations that are really running the show. They invariably turn to the idea that Israel is 1) equivalent to South African Apartheid (which is absurd considering the population balance and history) and 2) begin to present demands that cannot be fulfilled without essentially destroying Israel as a Jewish state. This includes the Right of Return to not just Palestinians who lost property in Israel proper like back in 1948-1949 as they are mostly dead now but their children and children's children. Also, that Israeli Arabs are ""second class citizens"" who should be made ""equal"" to Jews in Israel. 

This is an alluring demand to Americans because they see Israeli marriage laws and immigration laws as racist - why restrict by ethnicity (many other countries obviously do this when it comes to immigration, but liberals and leftists hate this in the United States). Ultimately the conversation turns to the idea that any Palestinian wherever he or she is currently living should be able to waltz right into Tel Aviv like he owns the place (because of course he does!) based upon Israeli Arabs truly being Palestinians who could invite relatives from anywhere else to come immigrate to any part of Israel and expand the Arab population there. 

Certainly, I think the condition of the Palestinians is miserable in the West Bank and Gaza. I think they have legitimate grievances and there is something to say about disproportionate responses to their attacks. I do not like the idea of settlements and pretty much dividing the West Bank into a bunch of different cantons. That is not right. However, the Palestinian leadership has been fucking horrible throughout its entire existence. Like the far-left seems to fetishize the Palestinian national liberation movement but even Palestinian historians like Rashid Khalidi and others will say that it has been a complete fucking failure - even what they regard as their ""victories"" have been defeats where they just haven't gotten their asses totally handed to them like they usually do. Or doing totally crazed things like the Second Intifada. You cannot justify terrorism and just kill people with no achievable goal. They aren't going to get anything that way and they are now weaker than ever. You can't just keep saying that Israel deserves all of the blame and much of the criticism of Israel I see is extremist like that."
Israel,fecnov8,t3_eoe74k,1578978500.0,"Oh yeah for sure. I was on the American far-left for many years, since I was 16 years old until 33. So I got to know a lot of people in various anti-war, anti-imperialist movements and what not. One thing that has always stood out to me is how frequently I would come across people who believed and would openly say that Israel did not have a right to exist and, more so, that any Israeli is a legitimate target. 

When pressed on this question, ""How could you say that Israel does not have the right to exist? Look at what America has done - we are protesting the invasion of Iraq (later occupation of Iraq... a country we blew to bits in a war that led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people) and you do not say that the United States does not have to right to exist or run around saying 'death to America!'"" Of course, some would say that too lol. But most were just satisfied criticizing American imperialism specifically and maybe if they were some kind of anarchist or communist or revolutionary socialist or some shit they would say that they want all nations to disappear in some far off End Times scenario. It was not something they would say routinely. 

UNTIL you brought up Israel. Then they would say ""But I also think that America does not have the right to exist!"" Yet they would never say this on a regular basis like they would with Israel, a small country and the world's only Jewish state. Sure, suppose you disagree with Israeli policies. Fair enough. Those policies can and have changed. That is up to the Israelis. However, according to their own beliefs, the United States is responsible for so much carnage. Yet they would not dare to say that every American is a legitimate target, that they are legitimate targets, and walk around saying the United States has no right to exist and should be forcibly destroyed the way they would with Israel. 

These views have a decent amount of influence in radical subculture and protest movements yet they are largely seen as weird and marginal - although they have gained much more traction. Still they mainly attract weird and marginal people who are hysterical fanatics. The internet is a more suitable environment for them. And yes, it is anti-Semitic. If you act like a bloodthirsty madman when it comes to ""Jews behaving badly"" as you see it but do not apply the same standard to others then why are you so obsessed with Jews? Isn't that always how anti-Semitism worked? 

I could go further than that: they would say, oh, you cannot silence Black voices, Arab voices, Latinx voices, Muslim voices, Third World voices, whatever. Like if you were just some regular white guy from a Christian background.. they have something to say.. you better ""shut up and listen!"" But Jews? Nah. Fuck 'em. They're just plain ol' white people and Israelis are white European imperialist apartheid genocidal settlers. As I was exiting the far-left and I guess towards social democracy as well as not just believing Israel had a right to exist but having greater sympathy for Israel, I remember questioning a former ""comrade"" about this considering that, what, 40% of the Jewish population of Israel is Mizrahi and the entire birth of Israel, if anyone cared to seriously look at the history, was hardly a ""European colonialist project."" He looked at me all weird, and said something along the lines of how because Israelis ""colonized Palestine like Europeans, they are."" No, the whole thing is crazy. 

Sorry for the rant, I just cannot believe I ran in such circles for so long and bought into a lot of that shit."

It always changed and conveniently supported some right-wing American political agenda.
bipolar2,fdftj8j,t3_el4c48,1578369835.0,"I was diagnosed a little over a month ago and I am also in my mid 30's. I've mostly been learning as much as I can about it and taking therapy and my medication routines very seriously. My life has improved dramatically in this short amount of time, but I realize that I have a long way to go in learning to live with this and with other problems I have always carried with me. I mean I was functioning and in fact could be fairly successful at times. Then there was always some crash. I just thought my life was chaotic and I got depressed sometimes lol. I did not even realize how messed up I got when I would have hypomanic episodes. I feel so different now that I have been a month on a mood stabilizer and seeing a therapist once a week. Like I am myself. 

I don't tell anyone except people I can trust and mental health providers. I certainly do not tell my employer. I don't think it is a good idea to advertise it unless you are in a position to do so and most of us are not. There is a lot of stigma surrounding bipolar disorder and I don't think it is anyone's business really. Unless they need to know or I think there is a valid reason for them to know then I won't bring it up. 

Actually what you are doing now, going on reddit and posting anonymously, has also been helpful to me. I never used this site before I learned about my diagnosis and I just wanted to find a way to talk about it and read what other people had to say. It has been really eye opening to see that other people have had very similar experiences to my own when it comes to bipolar disorder and some other stuff I have going on. 

Anyway... before I keep blathering... I would say the main thing that has helped me has been learning about what this is exactly and reflecting on my life with this new information in mind."

The package being AA is for crotchety gross old men and here is a hip alternative for empowered women. Besides, AA is for the plebs! 

That is really the only thing that upsets me about her shtick. She isn't another independent expert weighing in on the merits of AA. She personally is making money off of this for-profit business and The New York Times gave her a platform for that. 

I am in AA, have a sponsor and I am working the steps. I think there are valid criticisms of AA, but the evidence by and large is in favor of AA: it is free and as effective or more effective than any other recovery model. I mean I know they're out there but I have yet to come across a psychiatrist, psychologist, psychotherapist, addiction counselor,  or general practitioner who has tried to dissuade me from going to AA.

depression,fcibbjc,t1_fchuhlx,1577660062.0,"My brother and I were brought up by a single mom - our dad was an alcoholic/heroin addict and just abandoned us one day when I was 7 and my brother was 5. I will tell you this: it is fair to them. They should not be calling you dad. You're not their dad and they're not your kids. I don't know what their situation might be, but kids like that are often desperate for some kind of father figure and it seems like they have at least temporarily found that in you. Besides, are you going to be there forever? Do you want a family of your own? Let's say you find a different girl whom you really like and who wants a relationship with you. Who is to say that cannot happen? Or is your friend going to take her kids out of your life anyway when she finds a guy that she wants to permanently be involved with? There are a lot of things that you must accept as totally outside of your control. That house you have, them calling you dad, it is built on sand. It can be swept away at any time. So it is better that they not be so attached to you and you not be so attached to them.

Their mom also sounds pretty desperate. She and her kids almost got evicted and she leaned on you for 3k. She knows you like her a lot but she does not want to return that sort of interest and periodically steps out of your life when she starts dating someone. Women don't normally do that unless they are in a bad situation. Generally, it makes them quite vulnerable to abuse. Perhaps she sees that you won't treat her as badly as the next guy to offer her 3k or even less than that. Many if not most would expect a *quid-pro-quo* arrangement, which isn't right, but unfortunately the norm for women who are desperate.

I don't think you necessarily have to even make a big deal about it during New Year's. If you want to just enjoy the night with her, then do that. It might be awkward since people generally want to have a good time that night. I would say afterwards, though, find other things to do and minimize contact with her. Hell, join a bowling league, a civic club, a hobby group, or anything that you think would lead to healthy interactions with people and build self-esteem. If you aren't seeing a therapist, find a guy - perhaps an older guy - who deals with men's issues and depression who can talk to you about these things and provide input on what you are thinking. Or some other kind of *good* male mentor. Be 100% honest about what you are feeling. Just remember that you are important and there are a lot of things you could be doing right now that would make a difference in the lives of other people. As for her, you cannot control how she feels and if you want to take a step back, she should not be blaming herself for it like that. It is unreasonable. But you cannot be beholden to her emotions nor captive to your own. You need to take care of yourself first. I was older than you before I realized that."
depression,fchno4y,t1_fchc7rh,1577652122.0,"Yes. If she gets upset, let her get upset. She doesn't want to be with you and if that bothers you a lot then you should lessen your interactions with her or cut her out entirely. Certainly do not give her any more money. I agree: your mindset is driving you to this. Plus you are just cadging her about it. This well has already been poisoned.

There is a much bigger issue though. You should not be thinking this way about anyone. Sure, it is not good for women when guys get like this. But it is also not good for YOU to say  things like ""I will do anything"" for any romantic interest. People can manipulate you that way. They can take advantage of you. They can abuse you and you won't do anything about it or leave because your mind is so warped about what a relationship is all about. And you can get yourself worked-up and depressed if they do not return your affection.

It is okay to be rejected. It is normal to be rejected. But you have to be able to cope with that and move on. Spend more time working on yourself, man. Make dealing with these emotions a big part of that and look into different approaches to doing that if you have been trying something already. You have value for who you are and regardless of whether someone in particular likes you or not. It will help you and it will help in building meaningful and healthy romantic relationships with women."

And sometimes what I jumped into was just fucking weird and would make people wonder what the hell I was doing. But I also feel like it is an excuse for my bad behavior. I need to make amends to a lot of people, but then there are people who do not want me to communicate with them anymore so I cannot always do that. 

I wish I had gotten help, real help, earlier. Now I'm not sure what to do with myself."

No matter what they say in front of cameras, the movement's goal is the destruction of the only Jewish state in existence. Antisemitism is accepted under the guise of ""anti-Zionism."" But ask a lot of these lunatics to describe Zionism and they will say it is a racist, fascist ideology and in the same vein that racists and fascists deserve to be physically attacked or killed. Oh, but wait! Most Jews today are Zionists... how convenient!"

domesticviolence,fc5rz4l,t3_egaq7b,1577464555.0,"People can change, but it takes a lot of time and work to change. You seem to be mentioning what other people were doing in order to explain why you did it. The first thing you must do is sincerely understand that you alone are responsible for your actions. There was a lot, in your life, that led to this happening. You might not see it that way as you are thinking about what happened at that moment. However, it is true - it is always true. You must completely re-examine yourself and deal with whatever it is that brought you to that point. This might take years. It probably isn't just about slapping your girlfriend and scaring her and her daughter.  De-escalating situations like that, taking deep breaths, etc. are not enough. You might discover that there are many other things about yourself that need to be changed along the way. 

There are psychotherapists that deal with anger, men's issues, domestic violence, and whatever else you might believe you need help with. You should self-enroll in domestic violence classes. You should read books about it. Socially, you should engage in humble service to others as you seem to have a sense of entitlement. If you are a heavy drinker, you should stop drinking, as alcohol does something to the brain even when you are not drunk. It throws it off balance. 

As for salvaging this relationship, that should not be a goal for you anymore. And you should not see this as ""what can I do to get her back?"" If she leaves, she leaves. Her daughter also witnessed this and that can be a traumatizing event for a kid. Perhaps she was being bratty but she is just a 12 year old girl. If they want no contact with you, certainly you should not contact. Regardless, if she left, do not reach out. It is up to her if she ever wants to. All you can do right now is worry about yourself."

Is recording someone over the phone without their consent legal in the UK? If so download a recorder app to your phone and record her whenever she calls. Don't tell her. Pack an emergency bag so when you need to high tail it out the door and away from her to a safe place when she is not around. Tell people about what she is doing. Tell your friends, family, anyone who cares. Take an entirely defensive posture like you are preparing for war because she might totally bring it to you when you do what you must do which is to BREAK THE FUCK UP WITH HER. Dude... break up with her! Yes, she is abusing the shit out of you. She has some kind of mental health issues of her own I bet but so what? You don't have time for her to sort that shit out if she ever will come to terms with it.

cults,fc4ud84,t3_eg39oo,1577428777.0,"Personally I would never belong to one of their churches and my experiences with them have been nothing short of terrible but they are hardly a cult. Just another evangelical, fundamentalist denomination that insists everyone is going to hell except for themselves. They are pretty much Southern Baptists except they don't play instruments (because instruments aren't mentioned in the New Testament or something) and they think baptism by immersion is necessary for salvation. Thus all Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, Lutherans, Methodists, Episcopalians, and most of Christendom not to mention all non-Christians are doomed to eternal damnation because some guy did not dunk them under water.

They grew out of the ""Restoration Movement,"" which sought to reconstruct the early church based entirely off of the readings of the New Testament by a few American Bible thumpers. I think they are kind of strange but I have known several people to leave this denomination without any trouble.  I believe both Ken Starr and Weird Al Yankovic continue to be affiliated with the denomination.

Not trying to cast doubt on OP's experiences though. It did seem like a mean-spirited little sect to me."
bipolar,fc3v50w,t1_fc3pzr1,1577399426.0,"There is a difference between an employer getting sued for violating an employee's rights under the FMLA and being sued for disability discrimination under the ADA, although people will often claim both. In any case, no, if you get a right to sue letter, bring suit in federal court, and then survive summary judgment, no, employers do not like getting sued. Retaliating against someone for taking FML is a bad idea. The burden shifts to the employer to show that they were not taking an adverse employment action due to something the employee did before they took FML.

Most EEOC complaints go nowhere. Or a right to sue letter is obtained t but the employee has a hard time showing that because of the disability that there was an adverse employment action as opposed to some other important factor. If you are missing a lot of work and you are out of FML, for instance, you requested additional unpaid leave as an accommodation (let's suppose you are granted it... this does not always happen and is not necessary for the employer to terminate), and you are still missing work, you raise your disabling condition but it will not matter. Showing up to work is essential to the job and they can fire you whether you have a disability that causes you to miss work or not unless there is some other state/municipal law, a contract, or collective bargaining arrangement preventing them from doing so. That is not discrimination under the ADA and you exhausted FML.

But if they are pissed because you got a note from your doctor stating that you need a few months off and then they suddenly take adverse employment actions causing you harm, especially financial harm, and there is no good explanation aside from your taking FML,  yeah that is retaliation due to you taking FML. It happens all the time and it does not matter what your disability is so long as you are eligible for FML and you don't do anything demonstrating that you made an insincere request for FML (also happens all the time)."
ambien,fc3tgjc,t3_efzaya,1577398196.0,It makes sense to me right now.
bipolar,fc3ceem,t1_fc36mae,1577386699.0,"If you burn through FMLA, additional unpaid leave is also a recognized accommodation under the ADA. However, it must be within reasonable limits - indefinite unpaid leave and paid leave are generally NOT legitimate accommodations because they impose an undue burden on the employer. Be careful about claiming accommodations through a bipolar diagnosis though. There is bad case law suggesting that certain aspects of bipolar disorder, such as manic episodes, irritability, etc cannot be accommodated without imposing an undue burden on the employer as ""getting along with colleagues"" is pretty much always an essential job function. I suggest reading this summary of this case that went before the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, *Darcangelo v. Verizon, Md., Inc.*  [https://corporate.findlaw.com/litigation-disputes/the-ada-does-not-protect-persons-with-bipolar-disorder-in-the.html](https://corporate.findlaw.com/litigation-disputes/the-ada-does-not-protect-persons-with-bipolar-disorder-in-the.html)

The title of the blog post is dumb, but was just looking for a quick summary of this case. HR will not necessarily leave you alone. I work for a union in its legal department and we come across cases where the employee is bipolar and the employer pretty much wants to get rid of them because of symptoms associated with bipolar disorder. Usually they can absolutely do that, they just might take some additional steps to document it and show that the employee's condition runs up against essential job functions and that even with accommodations they cannot perform the job/the requested accommodations constitute an undue burden."

bipolar2,fc2745o,t1_fc1erad,1577343464.0,"I have felt like this a lot. It seemed like my hypomanic episodes were worse when I was in my early to mid 20's and then got really bad after doctors started giving me antidepressants. But they also made me pretty much numb and okay with all the chaos I was creating. By my mid 30's, without antidepressants, they usually were not as bad but I would still do weird shit and it felt like the depressive episodes were worse. Everything was complicated because like a lot of people with bipolar disorder I am prone to substance abuse (it sucks but too many doctors are not competent in dealing with dual diagnoses). I was always thinking, is there something wrong with me or am I just a bad/weak/stressed/reckless/irresponsible/horny/mopey person with addiction issues?"
CPTSD,fc0z0y5,t1_fc0qdlj,1577303560.0,"He brought up CPTSD to me in the same session. I saw a psychologist prior to him who mentioned ""a kind of"" PTSD to me for the first time, but the psychotherapist explained CPTSD a bit more. After I saw your post I thought about my own therapy session and that he probably knew what he was doing by using those same words."
CPTSD,fc0b16i,t3_effqly,1577285505.0,"I relied on marijuana for awhile to help get me through. Prior to that I drank heavily for years, which was far worse, and in my worst moments I was drinking heavily and using hard drugs. From my perspective, no, you should not feel ashamed at all. In fact, I would say from any perspective you should not feel ashamed at all. I think you need to approach it in absolute honesty and ask yourself if it is interfering with getting better. Like for me it was a temporary fix but made it more difficult for me to dedicate much time to developing better coping skills and so forth. Lots of people, however, smoke weed to treat PTSD and there are genuine medicinal benefits to it. It just depends on the person. 

Eventually it started to make me feel too anxious and I felt like it was having a negative affect on my mood. I also have bipolar disorder, it turns out, and most of the time I was using marijuana without serious side effects I was on some kind of antidepressant that was not good for me but I guess lessened the side effects of marijuana. I think I was also using it a crutch while coming off of alcohol and some really bad shit, so I wanted to see how I could do without it, to learn how to manage addiction without the assistance of another substance. I just could not feel like I was really ""sober"" if I was smoking marijuana every day as soon as I got home until I fell asleep. Felt like something was missing. I never felt ashamed for using it though. It was so softcore compared to the heavy drinking and drugging and I started to substitute it for those (it did not help much with relapse though). I mean if I could have been mostly smoking dope instead of drinking beer and liquor, day and night, I  would have avoided a lot of problems. 

But those issues are specific to me and not everyone. A lot of people with CPTSD have major problems with alcohol and drug abuse or they have co-morbid disorders that do not make marijuana a viable option for regular use. Marijuana can be abused and interfere with treatment. I've known plenty of people who do absolutely nothing with their lives but smoke pot and hang out all day on someone else's dime. However, many others encounter positive benefits from it while treating \[C\]PTSD and they do not have severe addiction issues. Or they do not have the negative side effects. In any case, don't be ashamed. You sound like you are functioning and not causing problems for yourself or other people."
