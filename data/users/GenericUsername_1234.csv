The water issues in Oakland so Flint are both attributed to damage before regulations were implemented. Oakland's issue is primarily because of the lead in paint that was finally banned in the 70s yet still [remains in the soil](https://m.eastbayexpress.com/SevenDays/archives/2016/12/29/oaklands-toxic-lead-contamination-isnt-in-the-water-its-in-the-buildings-and-dirt-and-its-bad). Flint's issue had multiple problems, due to inefficient and divisive local government leaders and lack of funds. The pipes themselves were installed, guess what, before regulations banned the use of lead.

Now, you want the president to remove these safeguards, these safeguards that would have prevented these issues. Air and water quality ***has*** decreased in the last 3 years and that is fact.

You got a source for that claim about Oakland? Everything I've read about it says otherwise. Their municipal water system has been updated to keep up with federal regs. The main issue is from the lead paint that was eventually banned due to regulations. Unfortunately, lead just seeps into the ground so it's very difficult to remove. But that's why we have those regulations, to prevent more of its use.

Most of the regulations that Trump has been rolling back are for manufacturing, not in cities. You're comparing very different things.
