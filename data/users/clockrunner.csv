Ignoring that first bit, the heart of your argument is pretty much that modern-day capitalism is exploitive, in which case you didn't make your position very clear at first because this whole thread has been about Amazon, so naturally the specificity to that company is assumed.

Like I said, nothing of substance there.

As for the last part, the employer-employee relationship is based on a right to work, meaning that the employer can fire the employee at any time as long as the reason is not discrimination, and the employee can leave anytime they want. Even so, an imbalance of power does not mean there is exploitation or coercion happening because in a free-market society, and employee can choose to go to another employer or start their own business. Even then, by your explanation, all employee-employer relationships from the dawn of time have been under the so-called threat of ""coercion"" because nothing you say there distinguishes Amazon from any other  place of employment. I still don't see how the employee is in a ""compromised position"", since they have other options of employers or other career routes. I'm not going to pick one of your options because I disagree with that premise. It would actually help if you define your definition of ""exploitation"" and ""coercion""."

Second of all, you missed the whole point about me bringing up you using illegal examples. It wasn't about the morality of legality, it was about you using straw man tactics to illustrate your point. Either way, like it or not, our society and economy is built on legality, not morality.

Third of all, no one is being exploited. They are free to work anywhere they want. If Amazon did not exist, they can go work for a retail store or a fast-food chain. Unfortunately our society is built on supply and demand, and if you are an unskilled worker who doesn't have a specific talent that is more marketable than someone else, then you are going to be paid a smaller wage because there are many many many people out there who can do the same job. This isn't the 60s anymore. If you want to get paid a decent wage a high school education isn't going to cut it."

They could close down the online retail store and fire all the workers tomorrow, and still be in the green by a hefty margin.
