k9sports,fff77g6,t3_escaj4,1579877456.0,Couple of days late to the party- Just nabbed a Silver spot in TEAM 1 for Jackie and myself! Hoping to get some good foundations down since I've now located a good OB club I want to start taking sport lessons in.
dogs,fff4u3q,t3_etaw2f,1579875728.0,"I'm mildly concerned that by the end of our CGC course, Jackie will have a strong hatred of GSDs. 

The female from last time, her parents were sick :(; but we unfortunately were not alone as the dog the trainer and manager did not think would ever show up- showed up. A 1.1 yr old reactive hot mess of a GSD who scared the utter shit out of us twice by lunging at us because the parent let the leash slack and stopped paying attention... :/


Despite this, Jackie was a down stay QUEEN. She got into such a swing with it that we had to go into a stand then loop around to continue our greeting practices. [I mean look at this face](https://imgur.com/a/IC6lN9v). She's no Eleanor in the fact that she's easily distracted but when she refocuses I'm in heaven with how well she just mellows into an excellent pup. 

SO thanks to /u/AlokFluff I let my mind go wild and found an OB club 1.45 hours away that offers EVERYTHING I could ever imagine(agility and trick being two major ones I'm pumped for!). I reached out to them last night to ask a few questions since they are primarily R+ but I did see some language I heavily questioned. They do ask for you to either restart with their OB1 and 2 or take an equivalency test for $45 which isn't bad. Hoping to hear back. Prices are fairly reasonable and it's almost worth burning a tank of gas a week to be able to compete.

I am about to try to grab silver in TEAM 1, because I need more foundations and I'm most likely going to wait until Jackie's spay at 1.5 yr before I try to start any agility work. And we are in Silver TEAM 1 Yay! :)"

This is a good question for the trainer or whom ever is running the social. Some places do because bigger puppies can accidentally harm the little ones or even as they age you can have issues with prey drive/predatory drift and some places may not if all puppies are of similar sizes and play styles. Each place will vary. 

I'd give the facility a call and ask them about how it's run or if you can view a class ahead of time to see how it goes before bringing in your pup. There should not be a reason why not."

Totally forgot about Fenzi until one of our other mods mentioned it and I realized I blew my dog budget already D:. Going to sign up late, still undecided though.

You have an adolescent dog, possibly experiencing some type of [fear period](http://www.drjensdogblog.com/the-dark-side-of-socialization-fear-periods-and-single-event-learning/), who is confused as to his routine (will barking get me attention/what I want or will it not), who is under-exercised and under-stimulated, has had his routine upset, and of course all the [stress and stress stacking]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFGIRPAWcSM)one can jam into a pup. And there  is always the possibility there is a medical cause to all of this so a full work up at the vets can help rule that out- good rule of thumb is rule out medical cause first before you jump to behavioral. 

* [Adolescence](https://www.reddit.com/r/puppy101/wiki/adolescence) is no fun. Basically it can be like their brains have left them entirely, behaviors regress or new unwanted ones crop up such as the barking and restlessness you're experiencing. Best solution for this is extreme consistency (and patience) matched with re-learning or refreshing your foundational behaviors. 

* I brought up fear period because that period right around the year mark is one people tend to forget about. Is there any chance that a noise is occurring during the night that could be scaring him? Wild animals? Neighbors? Other dogs nearby? I've read stories in canine behavior books where dogs were sent into inconsolable frenzies over high frequencies or things like sonic devices installed to deter birds or dogs and only became themselves again when the noises stopped. 

* Routine wise, you have to be consistent no matter what. He either gets a potty break at night or he doesn't. But you can not allow for him to exit his crate when he barking. Doing so is reinforcing the behavior ten fold by showing him that you are rewarding it via freedom and going outside. If you feel he needs to go out he has to show behaviors consistent to what you want meaning nothing besides sitting or laying quietly will be his ticket out. You can reinforce this throughout the day and every morning by waiting on him to sit/lay before opening the door and releasing him. This also reinforces impulse control as well as sit/down stay. 

* Exercise. I read in recent posts he's getting two 30 minute walks per day with a mid day visit but outside of that is crated. He has a lot of pent up energy that needs to be expelled some way some how and right now -barking is doing that for him. Two 30 minutes can be enough if you spend your time wisely. You can wear him out more by walking in new more novel areas, allowing for him to sniff until his heart is content, getting a long line and letting him free roam in acceptable areas and set his own pace and so on. Or if he is a good dog park or dog friendly dog adding that in once or twice a week can help; even a day of daycare a week could be beneficial to him. Outside of that he needs mental stimulation; food dispensers, puzzles, frozen kongs, chews, sporadic trick training sessions when you're home, nose work, find it games, etc. The more you do with him the less likely he is to bark or be unwilling to sleep. 

* Stress. Trazadone is a good medication in the fact it makes dogs sleepy but it's purpose is a situational anxiety medication give to lessen the amount of stress hormones in a dogs system so that you may actively counter condition behaviors and actually see progress because stress hormones are no longer preventing your dog from learning. I would personally only be using it immediately before I work on crating- no matter the time of day. Because that is where the stress is surfacing, the medication brings that hormone down allowing for you to work on crate games, sit stays in crate, closing the door, opening the door, tossing treats in, etc and actually build up some progress. And progress will occur, it's just going to be slow and tedious. It's  only been a bit over a week and of course there is no real tangible progress, but keep working and it'll build up and build up. It's not an overnight thing."
puppy101,ff9acxq,t3_esdsq8,1579708464.0,"Could be:

* [Adolescence kicking in](https://www.reddit.com/r/puppy101/wiki/adolescence)

* Could be from the recent routine upset

* Could be his adult molars settling into his jaw causing the need and want to chew to skyrocket (usually they'll lose some appetite as well which is normal due to growth slow at this time as well)

* Could be the cold weather - we feel pretty active when it's freezing and we also don't have a lot of outlets for that energy- 

* Could be you felt he was doing amazing and relaxed a bit too much before he was truly ready and mature enough to handle it.

* Could just be standard regression. 

No matter what it may be exactly a refresher in the basics and some good ol supervision, puppy proofing and mildly restricting freedoms again can't solve in due time."

We went out to Lowes, Hobby Lobby and Petsmart to practice thresholds, sit stays and down stays with distractions and with duration yesterday. Jackie did okay ish in Lowes- they were moving a lot of stock and also had the floor polish thing going which she did really great with but it make a sudden turn as we passed it and she spooked immediately (recovered though!). Stayed and worked for 15 minutes there. Went to Hobby Lobby.... 

Did excellent, miles better than Lowes, but of course right when a lady asked to pet her Jackie hacked a hunk of undigested treat she had swallowed wrong right at the lady. I nearly died of embarrassment, kept apologizing, moved along as quick as we could. Then to top it off she shoved her face into the Valentines aisle, I got her away from it. At least I thought so, we turned and I see a tag hanging out of her mouth- she had grabbed a tiny plush heart that said HUG ME on it and was carrying it around in her mouth. Fished it out much to her displeasure of losing her new found treasure. 

Petsmart was uneventful, did really good. This morning I used a giant empty Parmesan cheese shaker as a puzzle for her. I don't think she cared at all about her food, only getting every last cheese remnant out. She spend well over 30 minutes playing with it and has now passed out on the floor."
dogs,ff90kc2,t3_es7uj1,1579701770.0,"I would recommend you to read a few of Jean Donaldson's books or even oddly enough 'Canine Enrichment for the Real World by Bender and Strong' as all of those books contain excellent information from studies and personal experience on how canine social hierarchies work and how they do not. 

Personally I feel you are  taking it too literally and rigidly. I've watched Dunbar's seminars (grant it's been a couple of years) and If I am recalling properly he focused in on an artificial 'pack' of dogs versus a typical household, companion dog or a working dog home. Which sorta skews the finding imo. It's extremely fluid and will vary dog to dog and household to household.

A slicker? Those are excellent for a corgi's coat it reaches down to the undercoat and brushes loose coat out. If you're worried about it hurting your pup they make them with the little bristles capped off so they won't poke you or your pup. 

I would avoid anything with a blade (under coat rakes, furminators, etc) as those will cut and damage healthy coat instead of only removing loose coat. Plus undercoat rakes are really for dogs like husky and collies with real thick undercoats that need to be raked through to get possible mats and loose hairs out."

Pits and Boxers are not known for having hardy ear leather (not needed for the breed standards of ear cropping in the US at least with boxers this is the case) which means the likelyhood of hematomas forming off of the slightest injury are rather high.

They aggressively shock and over punish any behavior deemed 'not okay' which forces the dog into a state of learned helplessness-  it doesn't teach the dog anything besides 'Hey if I respond to any stimuli at all I get hurt a lot so I'm not going to respond at all' leading to shut down, fearful, helpless dogs.

Slapping a muzzle on a pup and hitting the dog park is not the way to go about things. Slow careful socialization, with adult dogs you know and trust, with positive reinforcement and planned escape routes if your pup is uncomfortable and wants to be left alone is the way to go.

That in itself is a massive contradiction. 

I have 'off-breed' therapy dogs, I work and have worked with therapy dogs of many different breeds from Mastiffs to Sammys, down to a outlier oddly mellow elderly Aussie and a lovely little Schnauzer and even some therapy cats.

It's ambitious as hell to have gotten your dog for that purpose the way you did, if you can pull it off- kudos that's great. But don't try to fit a square peg into a round hole.

Right there. Yelling, hitting, scolding, etc- does not do anything besides make your dog fear you. It doesn't teach them what you want done nor what they may have done incorrectly, it only teaches them that sometimes you're scary and will harm them. 

The only behavior it'll increase is the likelihood your pup will potty when you are not around or in hiding places to keep you from '*attacking' them (* dog sees it as an attack and has deemed pottying in your presence now a danger).

Stop hitting your dog and yelling at them. Only use praise and rewards to reinforce the behaviors you want, ignore the mistakes when you give the mistakes attention you reinforce it or make things worse.

She has picked up the funniest demand fussing. Last night she hopped up on the ottoman beside my desktop, sat eye level with me and made sad whine/grumbles at me. Apparently ignoring her and laughing was insulting to her so she got up, took her crate bed out and tossed it around for a minute before stomping off to chew on a nylabone. [Here's her fussing again this morning because I'm not letting her out to eat grass all day](https://i.imgur.com/Ru5Aml6.mp4)- click sound on for maximum sad puppy vibes. She does stop when ignored so that's nice, it's more funny/sad to witness because her normal bark is extremely deep and loud and she put on this sad, high pitched grumble for max woe is me."

She was maybe on antibiotics for UTIs about 7 times? in 10 weeks of age as well as feminine wipes every potty break due to juvenile vaginitis. We had antibiotics on reserve at my vets due to how frequently she needed them, it got to the point it was easier for me to call and pick it up than bring her in and redo the urinanalysis every time if we knew what was occurring. 

I have plans to spay at the 18 month mark due to growth plates and per my breeder's contract, but it's very much a waiting game as the heat may fix it or it may not.

* 6 months old and still with littermates - did not have families lined up usually bred for money rather than anything else. 

* Lives on farm - reputable and ethical breeders can live on farms but nearly every time someone says farm it's a mill or the Amish selling poorly bred dogs. 

* Lived in kennel with littermates -probably a bit cramped, messes being made setting back potty training as well as messing with her 'denning' instinct to keep her area clean. 

* Skittish - Missed the entire socialization period by two months, very slim chance she got out and about and introduced to the outside world. 

* Is designer breed - likely hood of BYB or mill goes up by a ton due to lack of OFA health testing and high demand due to looks. 

I would either buckle down HARD and get in contact with an excellent board certified veterinary behaviorist along side some excellent pet insurance or I'd contact a doodle rescue and see if they could take her. Just googling struggles of puppy mill dogs is enough for me to say  no thank you (and that is entirely imo there based off that information) ; but that is your choice. If you want to stick with it, by all means more power to you. It's just going to be an uphill battle because now you need to counter condition her to new situations since that prime window has long closed without her being introduced to the things she'll be seeing her entire life, (new people, vets, grooming, other dogs, and so on) as well as any health issues that could arise due to poor breeding practices (joints, genetic illness/disease, etc). 

I would also look at the two week shutdown protocol for newly adopted dogs since she is out of that prime puppy window and is most likely stressed due to the large amount of change occurring in her life at this moment. 

I will say as someone who brought home a 5.5 month old shelter pup from similar up-bringing (never left littermates, was in a foster home but only as an infant puppy before being moved to the shelter) it's hard. She'll be 5 years this week and while she's a good dog, she's anxious, struggled with reactivity majority of her life, she's abrasive to dogs she doesn't know well, very fear reactive towards people; she missed out on a ton of social skills and it shows.

Yes it does, it's also a lot of stimulation and activity. Probably more than he was used to and he got tired quickly. Here is a quick blurb on overstimulation (the behavior you're describing) from our wiki: https://www.reddit.com/r/puppy101/wiki/managingbehavior

> Puppies can only take so much activity or stimulation before they hit a threshold and cross into what is called overstimulation, overarousal, or more commonly the ""zoomies"". We also use this terminology when referring to human children having tantrums after stressful or exciting experiences. Think of your puppy like that cranky toddler. Typical signs of overstimulation in puppies include reduced bite inhibition, jumping, running in circles, barking, growling, inability to listen to commands - general chaos. This behavior is often mistaken as aggression by those who have never experienced a puppy tantrum before. Particularly timid puppies may freeze or shut down. Sometimes it seems like these episodes come out of nowhere - a helpful concept to understand how these episodes are triggered is trigger stacking.

Basically going forward just baby steps. A short walk here and there then back home, or puppy play time then home to rest it off, and so on. Trying to jam a whole lot of activity into one day or outing can be very overwhelming and result in a more fussy, likely to chomp down on your fingers and ankles kind of puppy."

Typically these dogs thrive on this attention and work with children in small groups and one-on-one in therapy sessions. 

In your situation though, a 7 month old dog is far too young to have been tested by a recognized and reputable therapy dog program and is likely not a true therapy dog which can bring the school into some hot water should the dog ever act out (which is always a risk as dogs are animals and therefore unpredictable at times).

You have a known Asian protection breed, a very aggressive, fearful dog if not socialized and handled properly and you want to board them (for extended periods) during the most important time of their life? 

To be wholly honest this is the type of situation that the dog ends up being rehomed anyways or worse put down due to behavioral issues later on in life. So I'd seriously sit down and think rather than asking if boarding is okay or trying to virtue signal and justify that it's not abuse and he's not left outside."

Not to mention regressions in training, potty behaviors and bond to yourself and other humans/dogs due to rotating staff and lack of socialization/exposure to people/dogs in real life settings which in an Akita can lead to a fearful and aggressive dog. 

If that's your only option I seriously urge you to either find a new job or rehome your dog. If you're responsible enough to take him on you're responsible enough to give him a good life and not one where he's boarded for the formative period of his life setting him up for failure later on."

puppy101,fddiki2,t3_ekte4f,1578313725.0,"Take a deep breath- you are just fine!! I know it can be so so easy to delve into all the nooks and crannys of the dog world and various hobbies then feel the need to immediately do ALL the things. But you're fine just try to breathe and relax for a bit. 

Couple of points I do want to touch on are:

> I worry I might be exposing him to danger.

This is highly area dependent, so a call with you  vet to discuss parvo and other disease risks of your area should calm your mind or tell you that you should avoid certain ones. 

> (yet - we were planning to start socialising him this week)

Socialization =/= playing with or greeting other dogs. That is a misconception. It is about introducing your dog to the world around them and having continued positive interactions in various social settings. In our wiki there is a massive list of socialization- so many you can do without even leaving your home or without him needing to touch the ground outside or other dogs. https://www.reddit.com/r/puppy101/wiki/socialization

For the last topic: Start working on day time crating (or whatever confinement method you've chosen) TODAY multiple times a day in short bursts to get him ready for later in the week.  Again we have a whole blurb on this in our wiki- https://www.reddit.com/r/puppy101/wiki/cratetraining

My fav recommendations for pups starting off in the crate is covering it, putting items that have your scent on it, enrichment toys in the crate (kongs, puzzles), and leaving on music, white noise or the TV."
Boxer,fd8tcjq,t1_fd2ytkt,1578223188.0,"Aww thanks!

Sorry I once nearly failed out of a photoshopped based college course :( no photoshop from me. It was the time of day roughly 6 am combined with the overcast/slightly daybreak that caused that strange no shadow but also vivid color scheme deal."
Boxer,fd8t3c7,t1_fd3fog3,1578223082.0,Thanks! I was having issues with her not paying a lot of attention to me at the moment- busy road even at 6 am when I was out on our walk- but a loud truck caught her attention for a split second!

puppy101,fd1ul2n,t1_fczkc02,1578137049.0,I was so pumped to see Kirby wrecking his box but sadly I don't think the link is working D:
dogs,fcxfrb9,t3_ejfvso,1578061772.0,"I tested out some new enrichment last night, basically I want to work up to taking cardboard boxes and layering them like Russian nesting dolls and putting food in layers. I started out with one small cardboard box last night- just putting about a half cup of kibble in and leaving the box open. The results were hilarious. 

[Jackie](https://imgur.com/a/zK5RNpp)- was attempting to use the box like a wobbler. She gently batted at it for a while without knocking it over. Eventually it did fall and food came out and a light bulb moment occurred for her. She found the best way for her to get food out was to push it and pull it using momentum to knock food out since her nose wouldn't fit in. Took her about 20 solid minutes to weasle the food out. 

[Summer..](https://imgur.com/a/nNg2vMh). Yeah. 5 seconds all food gone and she's looking at me like ""Is there more?!"". 

Star got a 'free' box pass and got her kibble in her treat ball during all of this experimentation. 

Lesson learned here- Jackie is slow with a box and Summer needs something difficult."
puppy101,fcxe1j2,t3_ejfax1,1578060442.0,"Musher's Secret is the paw wax brand I see recommended a ton for people who live up north and deal with paw pad cracks during winter. 

It does not snow where I live but it hits 105F regularly and I use burt's bees paw lotion when my dog's paws get a bit rough during summer time."
puppy101,fcx8y9s,t1_fcx6d1l,1578055878.0,"2 months = roughly 8 weeks so I'm going to guess that you've only had them for maybe a few days or so. 

Excluding any possible illness, your puppy is still settling into their new home and routine which can take about 2 weeks of time. Right now everything is super new and life is kinda scary for them if you think about it - new people, new place, first time away from mom and littermates, new everything and they don't know what's good or bad- so they'll understandably be a bit timid and unmotivated to play, potty, eat much, or learn a whole lot those first couple of weeks. 

Just give it time, she'll adjust and you'll be wishing she wasn't super active."
dogs,fcuuasq,t1_fcuu8fm,1577988647.0,Thanks!
puppy101,fcurgwb,t1_fcuqvjm,1577987000.0,"I do not have areas that would be considered safe to be off leash, too close to rivers with large predators (alligators), busy roads, and plenty of prey animals and mine are far too prey driven to be off leash reliable. 

In fact our lab had to have surgery this past march when she did get off leash decided to chase a deer and crashed and tangled into a barbed wire fence. 

I split them up with the Boxer/Heeler, then the dachshund gets a lighter exercise due to joints, and the Lab gets her own walks because she can't walk nicely with the others let alone herself half the time (recently inherited due to family passing- we have a lot to work on). Long leads are a god send if you can't have your dog off leash (like mine) or you are having issues with LLW or recall still. I picked up a few a couple of years back at a hunting supply store in that safety orange color."
puppy101,fcuprsy,t3_ej0sfi,1577986052.0,"My pup's favs for play with us:

* Rev (lab)- Kong and Westpaw frisbees, Kong ball (rubber not tennis type)- absolutely wants to fetch over anything else. 

* Summer (Heeler) - Tug and Flirt poles. She will run after anything but chances of ever getting a solid retrieve are about .001%. She is more about the chase than the bring back. 

* Jackie (Boxer) - Tug, flirt poles, any plushie she can get you to toss for her or tug around, and any sturdy solid balls like Westpaw's Jive ball. She will retrieve all day long if you let her. Gives the lab a run for her money every time."
puppy101,fcuplsx,t1_fcupbc0,1577985959.0,Yes! Love it! I made it a goal to step out of our comfort zone when walking so we've been picking new paths for the past 3 weeks and so far my pups have been loving it. Shameless fitbit plug if you need goals/badges to help motivate you (love love my charge 3 has survived well over a year of abuse from me)
puppy101,fcupdha,t1_fcup3de,1577985829.0,"Puppy STAR! 

https://www.akc.org/products-services/training-programs/canine-good-citizen/akc-star-puppy/

I absolutely recommend this for any one who is going to go for CGC or any formal training certs. It's sort of a CGC for puppies. It focuses on more puppy obtainable skills than the higher level CGC skills. My pup got hers at 14 weeks of age"
dogs,fcuonrp,t1_fcuiwh4,1577985427.0,"What brand/lead is that if you don't mind?? 

I have been considering at least moving Summer to a waist leash seeing as she is a consistent walker (straight forward, takes turn cues, doesn't start/stop nor tug unless prey). I'd love to add Jackie to it eventually but she's got an interesting  sort of everywhere gait and path so hopefully one day.  Plus having one or two on my waist would free hands up to start walking the third wild child once she starts to catch on to LLW."
dogs,fcucamu,t3_eiynrb,1577977625.0,"I think- *think* the swelling is receding a little on Jackie. I am unsure though as there is still plenty of discharge every now and then. Moods are still wild. She literally opted to nap all day yesterday did not want any chews, play a little, wasn't in the mood to get out of the house so I didn't force it. 

Meanwhile today I have Miss Goofball - https://imgur.com/a/4AIRrpN
As you can see Summer walks with a mission in mind- sniff the smells and locate the squirrels. Jackie is everywhere but even more so today than usual, I laughed so hard when she ran over to the giant pot like OMG MUST EXPLORE IT. I did 100% miss the picture of her intensely sniffing a stores outdoor decor by putting her whole nose directly on it. Probably won't get back out today which sucks but it's forecast to pour down 100% chance at 10 am thru tonight. BUT I do have some fun new enrichment ideas to try out so this ought to be fun! Perfect day to give it a shot too."
puppy101,fcu3073,t1_fcu2hsq,1577970998.0,"> . I’m just wondering if this will change with time as she matures?

Absolutely. Plus you appear to be working with her on this things so that combined with her maturing will make many of these little things disappear as time goes on. 

I know it's hard and sometimes you can get so wrapped up into 'Well 'x' wasn't like this.' Or 'This is terrible it'll never go away!'- I lost my shining star of a Boxer unexpectantly in late 2018. I had some serious expectations for my current one from day one based off of my last one being such an amazing dog who took to training and matured so quickly. Turns out while my current one is smart and picks up on things she's a slow maturer and lacks a brain 80% of the time once excited. I had to readjust my outlook so hard. I was getting frustrated and upset because she was not meeting goals on 'time'. Turns out this Dingy just needs more time to achieve things than I previously considered. Anyways point I was trying to make is try to document your successes and progress. You'll be surprised at what progress you do make and when you get discouraged- take a peek and you'll feel a bit better."
puppy101,fcu1s5t,t3_eixpz1,1577969711.0,"Hey 80/20 ain't bad!! That's a huge success for a puppy of her age! Mine even at 11 months old, yesterday scooped up a random wrapper and did a quick bounce and sprint before spitting it out like 'Ew that wasn't as good as I thought'. I had to chuckle at her antics for thinking it was some strange delicacy she found. 

I think the big thing about walks is figuring out what YOU want from it. Is it a strict 20/30 minute training walk where everything needs to be perfect? Is it a calm and relaxing go and do what you want (within reason) sort of walk where you take along lead and let her roam and sniff with you? It is a walk to clear your mind and let her keep pace as long as it's not at a full tug? Once you know what you're wanting to achieve you can better set her up for success. 

And the thing with others getting wiggles and excitement- you have to recall you're mom/dad. Boring old parent, see them every day, sometimes really fun sometimes not so fun. But that person they just saw- OMG It's like disneyland. New smells, new person- all novel and exciting to most any puppy.  So don't take that personally, I ask my dogs to either look at me or cue them to keep moving if I don't wish to interact. If I am game for it I just make sure to reinforce good greeting manners as well as educate the person on why I'm asking for certain behaviors before they touch."
puppy101,fctz7qf,t1_fcsphqd,1577966757.0,"Congrats! How exciting!!

Word to the wise- don't plan too strictly otherwise you may feel they're not meeting expectations and/or aren't a good fit. I had some serious plans for my youngest and the only reason I stressed over her was because I was imposing my last dog's atypical maturity and success onto her and expecting her to meet every goal by certain ages. Once I realized that and got to know her for her better I set more achievable goals and I think we are on a good track for the most part."
puppy101,fcrza2k,t1_fcryzc5,1577908824.0,"> Got it, so would u say keep repeating under lower distraction? 

Yes, while slowly building up. 

>  And as far a walks go; she gets to a point on walks pretty much every day where she gets to a point where she doesnt want to walk where im going. 

She could be tired, stressed, afraid. How long are you walking her for?

> Do i pop on the martingale or stop wait for her and go the direction she want to go?

Uh no. That's just going to make walks more unpleasant for her than anything. You can either encourage her to continue via incentives (play, food), change direction, or end the walk and return home. Forcing her to continue is not fair."
puppy101,fcrxsoj,t3_eime9a,1577908090.0,"> She purposefully does things that she knows are not right or doesnt do things i KNOW she knows.

Puppies and dogs really don't know a right from a wrong. It takes loads of repetitions and reinforcement to truly get any behaviors down. Just because she does it a few times correctly or maybe for a couple of days doesn't mean it's a solid behavior. Plus being a giant breed they're far slower to mature meaning regression in learned behaviors are going to be much more common as well as it taking longer for her to 'get' things. 

Touching on your comment below:

>  But the problem is wen the distractions get upped and i try to up the level of the reward, she loses all interest in the food

This indicates you went too hard too quickly. Baby-baby steps. If she becomes too distracted or overwhelmed take a few steps back ( lowering distractions, putting space between her and whatever is distracting, blocking view, ,etc) and try again slowly working back up."
