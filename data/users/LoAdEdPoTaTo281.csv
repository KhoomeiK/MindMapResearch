I guess it also depends on what you care about. If you focus too much on her reaction then that wont help you. That's not to say you shouldnt care but everything is good in moderation. It cant get to the point where it keeps you from doing what you want effectively. Working on your confidence which is essentially what hes saying is really important and it should get to the point where faking it isnt necessary as it's just a part of who you are. It's not that you dont care it more like the outcome wont be the end of the world. Of course getting to that point is hard and require a lot of hard work. Just my two cents"

 That's the thing they tell you but like a lot of things it's easier to say than do. Someone described social anxiety well by saying it just doesn't listen to reason. You can think whatever and tell yourself whatever you want but for whatever reason emotion overrides logic.

Howd you even get through the act of photographing people in the first place? I feel like that would require a lot of getting in front of people and bringing a lot of attention to yourself.

Crushes,fe3nvcf,t3_ennkt6,1578851190.0,"I bet you did(accident amirite). You sly dog! 

on a more serious note, this just goes to show how much we are missing out on by not taking action. If it werent for your accident this would have never happened and you would have missed out on a memorable time in your life. Now you've got some evidence if you ever need to convince yourself to ask her out. We cant let doubt stop us from doing things we want to do. Of course that's easier said than done as we all know. 

Anyways,  congradulations! It isnt everyday that something of this magnitude happens. Take it as a sign if good things to come. 

This seems like a great way to start communicating with your crush without confessing to them on the spot. Invite them to play some game like this and if they're down then it's a good sign that they at least want to be friends if not more. Great way to get to know them and feel out who they are. 

Hopefully your success inspires us to get out there and take the first step."

socialanxiety,fe0oz11,t1_fe051vi,1578816935.0,I thought the same. Actually came into play recently. I'm in a class and so me and this other person sit to the side of the room. Since their friend had just transferred out of the class they asked if I wanted to move to some seats in the front. I took one look at all the people behind the seats(most of the people around were girls making it worse)and my brain went nope. The thought of having that many eyes stare at me for the whole class was just too much.

Once you are confident in who you are and know and value your self worth then this will no longer be a problem or at the very least itll be much less harmful to you. Now how you do that is up to you because I am by no means a certified expert. I am just drawing from my own experience and some of the lessons I've learned(and am still learning) so I have no step-by-step process you should take. If you are suffering from low confidence or low self-esteem I would recommend, if you could, to get professional help. If you are unable to get help, then the least you can do(and what I did until I was able to get help) is find out as much as you can about confidence and self-esteem from as many resources as you can. Educating yourself is always a good thing especially if you want to grow as a person. Some examples of ways you can learn could be reddit itself, youtube channels(charisma on command comes to mind), podcasts and books as well as anything else you find helpful. Just remember to take actions whenever these resources call for them. You can learn as much as you want but if you dont put it into practice then you'll see no improvement. Of course this is easier said than done but it's a start and better than nothing. I hope this helps and if you have any other questions then I'll try my best to answer them. Good luck!"
