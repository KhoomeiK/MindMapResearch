explainlikeimfive,ff3puh9,t1_ff3nnyz,1579546269.0,"But there are international standards - eg. Countries that have ratified the Kyoto protocol can trade using the UNFCCCs international carbon trading flexibility measure. And countries inside the EU can trade using the EU EST and these trades ""count"" when calculating national emissions. I just can't figure out how/if voluntary offsets  contribute."
explainlikeimfive,ff3nh4l,t1_ff309bc,1579544820.0,So is it at the discretion of the country or the scheme they are part of?

Awwducational,feko19q,t1_feknb7l,1579204047.0,According to his Facebook page he escapes to go to the pub so you might be able to lure him with beer!
TheCatTrapIsWorking,fekiepn,t3_epk26h,1579200690.0,"I hate to be negative but please, please be careful to always check and never encourage them to go in dryers (not that you do but in case anyone wants a cute picture). I turned my back for a second when emptying the lint filter and my cat got in and was killed. Your cat is beautiful and I just want to protect him and all cats. It is a devastating way to loose a pet."
Awwducational,fej6s2q,t3_epbxez,1579159241.0,The red panda at our local wildlife park keeps escaping and someone has set up a Facebook page as him (Kush the Red Panda) . Last time he escaped the police messaged the page and said if he gave himself up they would send a panda car to collect him! The page is hilarious.

AskReddit,fdpw01b,t3_emnpx7,1578642805.0,"When I was a kid my Dad told me you could eat worms. He took one inside and my mum cooked it. It was pretty good. Until my early 20s I not only thought you could eat worms but as a result didn't really understand famine (why not eat the yummy worms?) Anyway my Dad heard me saying this one day and took me to one side, chuckling, and told me it had been a piece of gammon cooked and cut to look like a worm."

AskReddit,fdolocx,t3_emgtea,1578607670.0,"I decided I couldn't have a baby unless I had a spice rack. I obsessed about it an unreasonable amount and searched for the perfect one. I got really upset that I couldn't find the exact spice rack I needed for our house to be ready for a baby. I eventually BOUGHT two and had my husband splice them together (splice rack).
I also thought someone was hiding in a holiday cottage we stayed in so I hid all the knives in the washing machine."

Scams,fcom6np,t1_fcom2tu,1577835727.0,I've since managed to get PayPal to VERY grudgingly refund me so I'm won't be out of pocket.
Scams,fcom2tu,t1_fcnwukm,1577835648.0,I didn't think of contacting my bank. To be honest I didn't loose a lot of money but it just makes me so mad that they can get away with it because people will write off the money instead of go through the hassle.
Scams,fcolwku,t1_fcollfs,1577835525.0,"They even tried to do this weird guilt trip saying ""Well you have to know this isn't what we would normally do and it's not our responsibility to cover the refund and it will be PayPal paying not the company"" As though I'm going to feel terrible that PayPal (who are benefitting from their relationship with a scam company) are out of pocket. Poor PayPal I hope they can make their rent this month and feed their kids."
Scams,fcollfs,t1_fcnsvst,1577835306.0,"PayPal - lodged a dispute. PayPal said I had been offered a refund by the company so they weren't going to do anything. After about 30 minutes on the phone with PayPal I got them to refund me. It was such a weird conversation - I told them that the situation breached consumer protection law in China and the UK and they said ""Well we are regulated in Luxembourg so its probably different"". Probably!? I asked her to check and she refused. Luxembourg is an EU member so their consumer protection laws are undoubtedly similar to the UK because they will be implementing the same Directives. They were trying so hard to wriggle out of it but they were siding with the scammers and could not give a good response to that so in the end agreed to cover the refund and investigate the company."

DigitalArt,fch2qp5,t1_fch1qz8,1577646749.0,I think there's just a little too much shading - nothing wrong with the shape. But it's so subjective - the picture is gorgeous and I only mention it because you asked for critique

Needlefelting,fc68fst,t1_fc67vai,1577474670.0,It was my favourite bit of Christmas this year. My kids wrote out jokes and made paper hats and we made the crackers from loo roll tubes and the paper the loo rolls come wrapped in (we get Who Gives a Crap loo roll which is wrapped in super pretty paper and is eco friendly). I had even saved the little bits of ribbon from last year's crackers. The only thing I bought were the snappy strip things. It was soooooo satisfying!
TheCatTrapIsWorking,fc5m7xk,t1_fc5grqy,1577461292.0,"My cat died this way. I've never really got over the guilt. I always checked but one day I just opened it for a moment to empty the water and lint things and he jumped in while my back was turned, I didn't check again because I had been right next the the dryer the whole time but he had snuck in. I urge every cat owner to be super vigilant with dryers and washing machines."

brexit,fbzsh4p,t1_fbz0hlu,1577259173.0,"Some are quite prescriptive eg. For animal slaughter relating to TSE BSE controls. There are derogations open to Member States under some regulations which will no longer be available to the UK when it leaves - potentially making the level of regulation required to meet EU standards higher.
Edited for clarity - missing grammar!"
brexit,fbzsdj1,t1_fbz235n,1577259031.0,"I agree - frustratingly I think people will complain about the tariffs when that's what they voted for albeit without really understanding. It will be a nightmare to negotiate - the UK have retained truck loads of EU legislation in order to get named 3rd country status and materially changing any of it will endanger that status (though some statuses are separate so I'm talking about food, feed, agricultural trade, official controls only here as one in particular which covers a wide range of exported products). I just don't think a lot of people understand that they can't bake a cake that doesn't meet EU standards then happily sell it to the EU as they do now - or even produce the flour and eggs to make the cake or package the cake to different standards."
brexit,fbybiaq,t3_ef0a45,1577212769.0,And the irony is that we will still be abiding by those rules after Brexit in order to trade. Any divergence will inhibit trade. The UK have been retaining EU law so it still applies on Exit Day by the skip full.
