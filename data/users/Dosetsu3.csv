hiphopheads,ffcvrwv,t1_ffcty5f,1579808288.0,So was the goal for us to laugh at you and other people for being dumb? Seems like a weird desire.
hiphopheads,ff5gp9p,t1_ff5eqio,1579592090.0,I mean im not really trying to argue the subject. But basically my point was its difficult to be a highly critically acclaimed album without most of those things. And more that i really didn't go into. Other than length this album feels like an ep
hiphopheads,ff51e17,t1_ff4yxdm,1579577610.0,7 from a self admitted massive stan is definitely not going to translate to a great album to your average listener.
hiphopheads,ff519vj,t1_ff4zlx7,1579577522.0,"How? As a studio album it just is subpar. Whats the message? Whats the theme? What brings all the songs together? Why would i want to listen to it again in 6 months?

Personal the lyrics are alright. Nothing too surprising for em, a lot of pointless rhymes. Production overall was pretty generic em aside from a fee moments. I mean i guess if those are your only two metrics for judging an album maybe its great idk."

Showerthoughts,ff3l64h,t1_ff3jeur,1579543388.0,People breaking down harry potter and calling it childish as if it wasnt created for elementary/young junior high kids. Lol wtf. Do we need Pepa going on dates and having descriptive kisses?
Showerthoughts,ff3io8f,t1_ff3i2ja,1579541865.0,Not properly trained if thats the reason for pooping.

funny,ff26rcl,t1_ff22s4e,1579495405.0,Hiphopheads is horribly toxic and has been invaded by...idk what to call them. But its not a good place for the culture now.
funny,ff26pev,t1_ff22zwu,1579495360.0,A lot of rappers. In fact most rappers dont respond to diss tracks from artists below their caliber. Em not responding was status quo.

hiphopheads,fczu8fj,t1_fcysj3m,1578108703.0,This is HHH I really didn't assume at all we were talking exclusively main stream. But with that being said yeah you're pretty much right. But there's a reason for that. Fast rap hasn't really developed in any significant way in over 2 decades.
explainlikeimfive,fcyacjs,t1_fcya1dy,1578077068.0,Get a large hourglass. The bigger it is the easier it will be to observe.
explainlikeimfive,fcy7v5r,t3_ejikcu,1578075996.0,Hourglasses definitely slow as they empty. You can simply visibly notice it. Not sure why you or the podcast host think they don't.
hiphopheads,fcy50q1,t1_fcy371y,1578074901.0,What? You don't listen to much hip hop huh? Do you know any of busta's catalog at all? Any of the choppers? I'm really not going to make a list. But saying busta's look at me now and rap God are the only recent fast rap going back to pun tells a lot.

nottheonion,fclh1un,t1_fcle3d7,1577747611.0,That's why they would still be punished. But our legal system doesn't have set black and white punishments for crimes for this very reason. They obviously don't deserve felonies.
todayilearned,fckvjrb,t1_fckcedf,1577734115.0,Wait. You're implying cutting your head off with a chainsaw because you're being evicted is something a sane rational person would do ever?

todayilearned,fc4ll1t,t1_fc4jik3,1577420271.0,"The argument always is what is love. Is love just chemical? Well than love is not nearly as romantic as we like to believe but other animals definitely could potentially feel it. Is it something more? Does it involve the ""soul"" or ""conscious"" if so do other animals have those? Which ones? To what extent? Don't take this as arguing you but just expanding the thought you brought up."
modernwarfare,fc4kqmd,t1_fc14c5t,1577419536.0,What do you want to bet? Because there's no arguing it. That's not how sbmm works in this game or any game ever
