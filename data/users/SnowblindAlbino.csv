AskProfessors,ffdqkpt,t3_et1nbr,1579826554.0,"So I'm a senior humanities professor at a small liberal arts college. My classes tend to fall between 12-24 students, never any larger. I have clear deadlines stated in my syllabus and a clear policy penalizing late papers-- but I will pretty much *always* approve an extension if a student requests one. However, if they do not ask but simply turn things in late they lose one full grade per day.

Every one of my departmental colleagues has similar policies.  Nobody has ever suggested we must hold any policy, much less a similar one, but that's our culture. I expect the faculty at OP's school simply have developed a different culture.

IMO faculty do students no favors by ignoring deadlines. Choices in life have consequences, and too many high schools do not make that clear. But by the same token I think it's important for faculty to understand that students sometimes have conflicts, get sick, etc. and that's it's also possible to negotiate deadlines in the real world under some conditions."

AskAcademia,ffcg42w,t1_ffbyzff,1579798719.0,"> The bias against interdisciplinarity is logistical, not ideological.

I think it's both actually. I have seen vehement objections to interdisciplinary training (""it's not a real degree!"") from people with traditional backgrounds on hiring committees. It's not always just filling a niche in a department; sometimes it's straight-up bias against anything that isn't identical to what ""they"" imagine the standard to be. That's perhaps declining with time-- it's more common among senior faculty --but it's certainly still present."
AskAcademia,ffcfvor,t3_esruc3,1579798576.0,"I have both interdisciplinary and disciplinary degrees, and have been affiliated professionally with programs on both sides of that divide for the last 20+ years of my professional career. I think you are absolutely right to note that there is a bias against interdisciplinary fields/methods/approaches in many contexts. For example, the bias against American Studies Ph.D.s among American historians is well known; I've seen that play out in many search committees that have simply rejected AS degrees outright.  Since there are relatively few(er) positions in interdisciplinary programs/departments than in traditional ones, earning a Ph.D. in a clearly non-traditional or interdisciplinary field can be a risk.

That said, I've personally found my *combination* of degrees (two master degrees, one disciplinary and one not, plus a Ph.D. with two broadly interdisciplinary subfields) has worked well for me. I have had no problem finding places to publish and my academic career-- intentionally pursued in the SLAC market of teaching-centered institutions --has developed in such a way that I've been able to teach both traditional disciplinary courses and broadly interdisciplinary ones in multiple programs/departments. This ""best of both worlds"" approach has allowed me to play up the disciplinary identity when it has mattered (and it *has* mattered) while also benefiting from the positive attention sometimes given to novel approaches, having access to grants and other resources that are expressly targeting people outside of traditional disciplines, and from the opportunity to serve as a bridge between programs/departments on my campus.

Having two masters degrees opened some doors for me. Having a Ph.D. that was-- on paper --traditional but which also incorporated a broadly range of interdisciplinary course work and research experience was crucial: it is what got me hired and largely how I got tenure/promotion, i.e. by being able to do two (or more) things at once professionally. I'm seeing the desire for such candidates expressed more frequently now (especially by deans) that most of us are dealing with the ""do more with less"" resource paradigm-- for example, we now want that new hire in American history to *also* teach in the Gender Studies department.

The bias against interdisciplinary degrees is real and widespread. I think it's unwise to invest one's entire professional identity in such pursuits. But I also think being able to credibly claim interdisiplinarity *in addition to* a traditional disciplinary credential can be quite valuable. So do both.  It will be harder, and if you end up in a position like mine you'll always be doing more work than your peers, but if it increases the odds of having an academic career then that's what it takes-- assuming that is your goal."

Our eldest is now a film studies (history) major in college so she's always convincing her friends to watch classic films, though they don't always enjoy them. We have a full theater in the basement and have spent many hours watching things like Citizen Kane or Lawrence of Arabia with our kids. Then on weekends they'll have friends over to watch Magic Mike or Avengers as well.

But it's mostly a losing game. Almost none of my college students knows anything at all about movies more than four years old, except Disney cartoons.

Being in high school in the early 1980s was perfect timing for Python films; we rode the VCR wave and got The Meaning of Life in theaters. We were the first generation that could watch the movies over and over any time we wanted, or just keep watching the good parts.

Nah, that's ridiculous. I did it with two teenage girls and my parents (in their 70s) in a quad cab pickup with a camper in the bed. Members of my family have been doing Alaska road trips from the lower 48 for almost 30 years now. We have family in a fairly remote area so usually fly up for visits due to time, but my folks were driving up for fishing trips back in the mid-1980s. It's much easier now because the roads are far better-- all the oil development drove major investments in roads, so the entire route is paved and in pretty good shape now.

What you want to do first is buy a physical copy of the current [Milepost](https://www.themilepost.com/), which will be your planning guide. It is literally a mile-by-mile guide to basically every road in Alaska, as well as all the main routes to/from there from the west coast (Washington) and as far east as Alberta. It offers reliable into on road conditions, campgrounds, gas/diesel, food, and attractions (such as they are) along the entire way. 

With our rig we spent about 1/3 of our nights in public campgrounds (provincial parks, local parks, etc.) and the rest in private ones (mostly RV parks that allowed camping for 1/2 price or in some cases just in the parking lot of a gas station or restaurant that offered a restroom for a few bucks). There are some hotels, though fewer in Yukon, and quite a few businesses have closed/failed in the last five years as the price of oil fell and many of the man camps along the way have been shuttered. But there are still places to get gas every 150 miles or so at least, usually closer.

If you're someone who already drives around the CO mountains or camps or vacations in national parks/forests the drive will be just fine. The only issue is that it can be a long way to services if you break down, so be sure your rig is in good shape and that you have at least one good spare! Some parts of the route, especially on the Casair Highway, were really remote. Once you're in Alaska there is really just one main loop road around the interior and there's lots of traffic, so nothing to worry about there.

We had a wonderful time both up and back (took different routes) and saw some amazing stuff. Lots of woodland bison, dozens of grizzleys, moose, elk, deer beyond count, at least a hundred bald eagles, etc. Had some good food, had some bad. Stopped in Edmunton one day at the world's largest mall, and two days later we were on the border of wilderness. White Horse, Yukon, was the last ""city"" we saw on the way up so we had a good meal there, bought groceries, etc.

Be aware of the border rules of course; they aren't complicated but of course you'll need passports now, can't take guns, can't take a dog without complicated paperwork, etc. But I'd totally recommend it, even if it means having three generations in a pickup for over a month like we did.

That's going to create a pretty different perspective. A few years back I packed my kids and my parents into a truck and drove to Alaska (across Canada) for five weeks. We drove just short of 17,000 miles round trip as we explored a lot each way.

Gas is cheap in the US and everyone has a car. In my 20s I drove coast-to-coast many times while in grad school, which was over 3,000 miles (5,000 km) one-way.  It's nothing for us to drive 500 miles (800km) for a weekend getaway."

If you've been accepted the next step-- immediately --is to find out if your campus will fund your trip and how you get access to those funds.

The problem comes with places that have low-quality dining options, only offer fast food, are dominated by commuters (so there are few/no options on weekends), or are simply corporate...some schools have sold their dining operations out to Taco Bell and Pizza Hut, for example.
