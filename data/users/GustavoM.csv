And I've got to admit that skills are messed up as an attempt to ""find the missing piece of the puzzle"" -- to try to make my build work, per se. By trial and error, and all that -- it shows my inexperience and how I enjoy trying to figuring out things rather than ""getting em done"" from other players. And it's hard to ""find a direction"" since everything feels lacking and I always feel that something is missing -- which makes me try to use ""everything"" instead of something more specific. And as far as my memory goes -- I'm supposed to have at least 6k hp (?) at my current level.
