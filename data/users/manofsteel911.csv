techsupport,ffvxfgy,t3_evie8z,1580276245.0,"Your browser has a thing called as cache and temp files which are stored on your hard disk (for speed and data), when you visit websites or stream data these files get created on hard disk and do take up some space there is a limit on this usage though of course it also uses up ram so basically it's ram + some space on disk. You can tell the browser to clear cache and cookies to free up disk space. Your next browsing for that site would be slower though.

Your mobile service provider gives you some data on plan you bought when you use mobile data this plan is applicable and hence your data gets reduced. When you use wi-fi you access internet thru the router you are connected and not thru your mobile carrier so your mobile data plan remains unused rather you use the service via router which is also paid and has some plan on it. WiFi can be some paid service you take via home or landline or free service in public etc."
