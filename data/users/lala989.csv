gifs,fefgr45,t1_fefg9m4,1579055983.0,That hardly seems like a fair comment based on my understanding of how much of the crown estate revenue goes to the government each year.
Parenting,fe9ngc7,t1_fe9ljsn,1578939739.0,"It is extremely strange. I noticed that sentence too about worrying about molestation at the hospital, who says that? I read a book once called Sickened by a girl who grew up thinking she was sick and unwell and had all these illnesses but it was her mother who was forcing it on her, even to the point of extreme medical procedures. The weird headaches and invisible unnamed illness where the children are allowed mental days off from school etc- I think Mom is crazy and applying it to the children like a sticker lifted from herself. I'm pretty disturbed."
Parenting,fe9lnll,t1_fe92txi,1578939194.0,This is ridiculous this person is a liar. They have a prescription for oxycodone and got ahold of fentanyl and overdosed at home yet no one knows? They traveled to other countries and have allergies that can be triggered from two stories away but can't afford to find a proper pychologist for the daughter? This whole thing reads like sick fantasies.
Parenting,fe9kc4h,t1_fe9fqpw,1578938641.0,I began to hope this is a writing prompt and not some actual person out there running their lives like this...
mildlyinteresting,fe6hwm7,t1_fe63ofo,1578891420.0,ðŸ˜‚ I'm sorry this has happened to you. I'm left to imagine the pic was pretty funny though because that's how I'd be running out!
aww,fe6ho9i,t1_fe6e4md,1578891210.0,"Well one thing is that hitting a wave wrong is like hitting the curb in a car so it can definitely jolt you. I don't have deep ocean experience but I have been out in the Pacific in a lot of weather and my dad has done a lot of ocean crossings. There are handrails EVERywhere for a reason. A storm on a cargo ship tossed him down about seven steps when it lurched suddenly, and although he partially stopped his fall he busted quite a few ribs. He's been at sea for nearly 70 years and I think this is the first time that's happened but still. The predictable waves you are thinking of is a calm day. Otherwise it can be super choppy and rough."
MadeMeSmile,fe5vb9s,t1_fe3gsmc,1578875756.0,"It is definitely a little out of the ordinary, but it made me smile because my kids would definitely take a full year to prove me wrong on some point in life that fully doesn't matter, lol. They had some impressive dedication- but any parent with a strong-willed kid can relate."
AbandonedPorn,fe09su0,t3_encu80,1578807130.0,I think it's prime and given a sunny day and some greener grass it could look really charming. That's what I'm hoping for here.

Then maybe I can focus on the things I wish I were doing."

Also I was just in Moab, Utah at a tiny movie theater and there were posters all over the ceiling of movies filmed there, Con Air was one. We did a 'huh' very cool!"
britishproblems,fdpj4g8,t1_fdp9saw,1578630016.0,"Don't be an idiot although that's obviously too late, I saw ONE COMMERCIAL for it in four years watching a different show on USA network so yeah I've heard of the stupid show. I can't believe over a hundred people think 'no one has heard of the show' is 100% literal, that's moronic to the extreme to get that out of my comments. It's utterly idiotic to me that people are defending this ridiculousness like you actually care. And actually insulting me over it. Wtf are you guys Meghan idolizers??"
britishproblems,fdoysls,t1_fdoygbk,1578615974.0,You assume that I didn't know before I commented but I looked at it anyways. I find it hard to believe that you know more than one person who's heard of the show before Meghan started dating Harry.

TwoXChromosomes,fdm6wip,t3_el8j4x,1578541276.0,"A question, the guy who was her holiday boyfriend who was consensual, has he said she agreed to let all his friends in?  Like deliberate lies all the way around from the guys?
Does she remember that he didn't try to stop anybody then? If so maybe they've done this kind of thing before, it's awfully strange he didn't mind a dozen of his mates barging in. Another question, was she inebriated or drugged so that it was easier to tell themselves they weren't doing anything wrong? It's such a shame they handled her case so poorly, to the extent she now is suffering from extreme ptsd, and we have so few answers to what happened."

WatchPeopleDieInside,fde26cu,t1_fddr1ni,1578329499.0,The Rock is the biggest guy I can think of but he's also Samoan and an ex wrestler so I don't think the steroids joke really would be a shocker- I was wondering who else he might have meant though... Jason Momoa? I really have no idea.
