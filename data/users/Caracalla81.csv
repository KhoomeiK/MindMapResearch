specializedtools,ffgpw90,t1_ffgc1p0,1579912048.0,What?  Are you trying to make a statement about capital investment in automation vs. the value they produce over non-automation?  Did Timmy fall down a well?  What is it boy?
specializedtools,ffg6nd2,t1_ffg0u6r,1579899595.0,"Sure, but probably not in common trades like go into house construction.  It would probably be harder to find people to maintain the robot."
specializedtools,fffzekv,t1_fffu4uy,1579895135.0,I'm pretty sure developing countries have plumbing and electrical work.  Especially if robot brick layers are on the table.
specializedtools,ffftw51,t1_ffftevk,1579891696.0,"Faster, cheaper, more adaptable!  They can even handle different sized bricks without a refit!"
specializedtools,ffftk60,t1_fffm6vk,1579891492.0,I guarantee you that he studied actual brick layers when designing this.  It is still a novel advance in robotics.
specializedtools,ffftfvl,t1_ffflkde,1579891418.0,When we're talking about robots the capital costs can often outweigh the labour costs.  Consider all the things this robot can't do and for which you'd need to have brick layers on-site anyway.  Also the cost of the guys that set it up and break it down and who apparently follow it around cleaning up.  Added to the initial cost of the machine it very may not be worthwhile.
specializedtools,ffft130,t1_fffryto,1579891163.0,"I don't know either - I don't think brick layers get paid so much that it's worth it.  Also, you'd still need to hire a brick layer for all the spots the robot can't go.  People often don't consider the capital outlay that automation has which can often make them impractical.  That's why we don't have automatic trains."
specializedtools,fffss6l,t1_fffr3me,1579891011.0,"The problem with automating this sort of thing is that most construction is very bespoke with each site being a bit different.  If they were as controlled as a warehouse or factory situation we'd see these things much more but in practice there are far too many exceptions for current robots to handle.

Side note:  “There aren’t enough people to build houses fast enough,” says Steve Pierz, chief innovation officer at FBR.  If he's talking about the developing world there is certainly no shortage of labour.  This bot would have to lay a lot of bricks before it paid off it's investment compared to a third world human brick layer."
todayilearned,fff5dp5,t1_fff49tw,1579876128.0,"It's not to say that there isn't a good reason, only that *I* don't know because I mostly just know the North American perspective."
todayilearned,fff3thv,t1_ffez32v,1579874961.0,"Are you American?  The war was actually started as a conflict between the English colonies and New France over control of the Ohio valley.  It was George Washington's first command and he was present at the first major battle.

Britain eventually won, taking control of New France at the behest of the colonists.  When Britain tried to make those colonists actually pay for the war they'd just fought it became one of the factors leading to the war of independence.  

The Seven Years War, or French and Indian War, was super important to the formation of the United States.

Are you not American?  Then I'm not sure why you'd learn about it in high school.  I guess Canadians learn it for similar reasons - it was the start of English Canada."

onguardforthee,ffexq7w,t1_ffe5ii7,1579869676.0,French immersion schools tend to be better than regular public schools. Plus you can learn French. J'ai une baguette!
