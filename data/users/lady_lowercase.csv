just because a person doesn’t want kids doesn’t mean s/he doesn’t want to look out for a loved one’s kids... seriously, think for two seconds about this: the kids’ mother is likely saying not-so-nice things about their dad’s girlfriend, and dad and his girlfriend don’t have much cohesion when it comes to parenting.  the kids aren’t looking to them as figures of authority/respect.  this is bad for o.p., and it’s definitely bad for those kids.  why not work on cohesion and expectations without further allowing yourself to be undermined?  those kinds of impressions are sure to last with the kids a long while, they’ll continue acting out of line, and it won’t be easy at all to change their perspectives... especially not at five or eight.  if o.p. and her boyfriend don’t fix this now in a concrete way, these kids are going to have this attitude through their teen years until they’re hopefully struck by maturity.  there’s already plenty of stories on this site of people who hated their step-mom and learned it was only because of the kind of dumb shit o.p. is trying to work through right now.  there’s no need for the kids to be involved until she and her boyfriend can provide them with a more stable living situation."

(and worse for the kids!) if she and her husband are figuring out the whole parenting thing while the kids are present.  i’m sure the kids’ mother isn’t saying the nicest things about their dad’s girlfriend, and a lack of cohesion between dad and his girlfriend would further undermine their authority as parents, further worsening conditions for the kids..."

zelda,fddwlrz,t1_fddsi89,1578325759.0,"you're on-point with every comment you've made.  unfortunately, people just want to romanticize this game, but no matter what they say ... there's just no real depth to *breath of the wild*.  the memories amount to thirty minutes of story in a game into which you can easily pour hundreds of hours of play.  there's a comment elsewhere saying, ""so many wayd [sic] to have fun in-game without completing anything,"" and all i can think is, if i wanted to play a game without completing anything, i'd stick to games like *overwatch* or *battlefront*."
rva,fdakxro,t1_fdahibp,1578247219.0,"we should have gotten what richmond first established many, many years ago: street railways.  our city's was the first successful electrically-powered street rail system in the entire country, and it would have been way better for the environment and for the city."
MurderedByWords,fdajo5i,t1_fdacqdi,1578246831.0,are you kidding?  the obama administration was riddled with scandals; **it's** no wonder he's considered one of the worst presidents of all time.  we all have to have healthcare now **because** of him.  everyone knows **he's** also a total monster for ordering a burger with dijon mustard.  and do you remember that time he wore a tan suit instead of a **black** or blue one?
WhitePeopleTwitter,fd6sftz,t1_fd6h9w5,1578195145.0,"so what?  he can still advocate for those who aren’t.  it’s not like you have to be a victim ~~or~~ of* sexual assault to be against sexual assault... and millionaires (bernie has a net worth of $2.5 million) are *nowhere* near as wealthy as billionaires.  a million to a billion is the same percent that 10 cents is to a hundred bucks.  a million seconds ago was some time last week, and a billion seconds ago was sometime in the 1980s.  they’re just not comparable."
LivestreamFail,fd2ebjx,t1_fd0ln5s,1578145990.0,"yeah, people used the grid to make all sorts of abominations given that you could also drastically change the size of the mole feature.  ignorant redditors have been downvote-happy lately."
LivestreamFail,fd03eyy,t1_fd03587,1578113049.0,"oh, lol.  you’d be surprised at how long that sort of customization has been possible.  i believe the wii’s mii-maker allowed you to place a mole in a spot of your choosing, and that console released in ‘06.

edit:  wow, you guys... /facepalm

see the [cindy crawford](https://www.miicharacters.com/index.php?t=mole) mii posted here or this [spongebob mii](https://www.miicharacters.com/miis/large/912_spongebob.jpg).  note that they were made on the **wii**, which again, released in 2006.  i can’t believe y’all downvoted legitimate information that could be searched via fucking google.  just wow..."

witcher,fd01vjf,t1_fczc2ho,1578112410.0,probably triss based on complaints i’ve seen elsewhere.
