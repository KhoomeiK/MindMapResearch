free markets are not short term thinkers. government is because politicians only care about the next election and serving their cronies. free markets understand long term consequences. an example would be how the early 20th century logging industry quit clear cutting forests when they realized theyd run out of trees. they started tranch cutting mountains and replanting behind themselves. if they had not, we would have devastated our forests beyond repair."
