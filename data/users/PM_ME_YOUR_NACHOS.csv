AskReddit,ffzad5k,t1_ffz39ff,1580369465.0,"Where I am, some people are convinced that diesel provides better value for money because not only is it cheaper but it's got better mileage per litre. HOWEVER, not only is maintenance more expensive, the price for a diesel engine vehicle over a petrol vehicle more at an amount that it negates those cheaper running cost unless they use it over 10 years or very high mileages.

The only exception being heavy vehicles that exist only as diesels or if someone needs the torque that diesels provide in massive amounts."
