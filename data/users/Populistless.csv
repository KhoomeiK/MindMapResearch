You still don't have enough illumination to ""see everything"", especially at the detail needed for hunting and fine motor skill activities. You could see everything in a macro scale, like the mountain peak across the bay, or a lone tree way above the canopy... But if you tried to look towards vegetation or try to see fine details in even light forest, you just couldn't. The relatively low light and monochromatic hue meant that pretty much anything could have snuck very close without me seeing.

Now if they would just raise the ridiculous $1.25 cost for the streetcar, so that we're not subsidizing tourist trips, and use that extra income to invest in speed and efficiency so that residents can actually use it to commute.

Make the street cars touch-pass only (a staggering amount of the delays are from 10 people every block digging for exact change). Use the Istanbul system where you pay like $10-15 for a card with rides pre-paid for at say $1 a ride, so that regular riders don't have to pay the say $3 trip or $8 day pass. You can then top off the card at select stations. Cards with say $5 prepaid can be distributed to low-income individuals who may have difficulty with the initial cost of the card.

Please do this."
Foodforthought,fcr3ns2,t1_fcqzz27,1577896316.0,"Don't completely disagree, but property taxes, capital gains taxes and estate taxes, along with a progressive income tax--will do more than corporate taxes.

Of course, while economists prefer property taxes, they're rather unpopular and there's no way we will have a national property tax (say with an exemption at a certain dollar mark so that it's not a huge burden on low income homeowners.)

Capital gains though, more doable politically.

With corporate taxes, I think it's more important that we just remove all the loopholes, so that large corporations over mom and pop shops don't get a de facto advantage thanks to better accountants."
AskReddit,fcok1qq,t1_fcnpafq,1577834189.0,The best part about that running gag was that nobody ever acted horrified or disgusted or (except for Squirrely Dan) questioned whether it happened. They just instantly debated the logistics with a lot of confidence.

Regardless I very rarely see Redditors advocating a $15 dollar national minimum wage and benefits during these discussions (I only see this happening in cities like Seattle and New York anyway). They mostly seem pissed off that they have to tip.

I actually like the tipping system. It's an (effectively) tax free distribution from the rich to the poor that allows service industry workers to make ok money. Sure, the wealthy don't pay more tips as a percentage of their income, but since they (or comfortably middle class folks) comprise the majority of customers, and the occasional huge tip means they tip a higher percentage of their bills... the effect is semi-progressive in terms of distribution. But I am willing to back down if you manage to convince Republicans to institute a national living wage, scaled for inflation, with benefits."
starterpacks,fcohnuz,t1_fcm9ho7,1577832461.0,"Also, if we're going to answer the question, they are not the same. Ive worked both. McDonalds will hire anyone. It's actually tough to be a server in fine dining. You have to have strong interpersonal skills and keep track of a lot of different tables while being constantly interrupted with new requests and also learn how to quickly analyze people and know how to manage expectations and resolve crises. I was a national merit scholar but that didn't translate to the short term memory and people skills involved. I could handle diner serving but could never make it in fine dining. Their memory and focus (usually supplemented by adderall) was amazing."
starterpacks,fcoh8d7,t1_fcm9ho7,1577832166.0,"Very American approach. Instead of asking why a McDonalds worker doesnt deserve a living wage, you ask why a server doesnt deserve to make minimum wage. Why do they even have to spend millions on lobbying when we have people like you?"

starterpacks,fclmmyh,t1_fcldlzu,1577751360.0,"Its a valid opinion. But it screws them over just the same. At fine dining restaurants servers can earn a living wage and sometimes even benefits. They often have worked for years to move up and are generally way more skilled and experienced than those at more affordable restaurants. 

Imagine if 90% of your clientele in any job ordered $100-200 of product and gave you $20-$100 for your time (high end tips can often be well over 20%) and then you have a client that requires the same amount of work but orders $25 of your product and gives you $3-5. Not only does your hourly income drop drastically. But you also know you have no chance of getting that occasional Benjamin that a whale leaves after a few bottles of wine.

I agree they should try to be professional and conceal their disappointment. But just know that high end servers live off big tips. A standard set tip of say $5 would turn a waiting job from a decent living wage to a McDonalds type job."
