Intel, especially, has really good resale value because the socket changes mean the new CPUs don't directly compete against the secondhand market.  If you have a Z170, the best you can drop in is a 7700K, so the (eg) 8700K and 9900K don't affect secondhand prices of the 7700K despite being incredibly better processors.

You could literally have used a 6700K or 7700K for two years and then sold it for like a $50 loss and bought an 8700K or whatever.  So you paid $50 to use a flagship tier processor for two years.

in the grand scheme of things it's a solution in search of a problem.  Ammo being cased isn't a problem for the most part.  You have to extract it, but you have to feed a new round anyway, so it's not like it imposes a significant design penalty.

having timed health regeneration meant that even if someone ducked into cover for an instant, you could keep pressuring them and finish the kill.  If you couldn't keep any pressure on them over a 20 second period and let them heal back to full health, well, you got outplayed.

for a community that rails against perceived ""casualness"" of the changes, every single player having a health pack on demand is the casualest thing in a battlefield ever, and devalues the role of medics.  Same for buddy revives, every player can revive now.  Field ammo pickups from dead enemies devalues support (this should be a specialization at best), and squad spawns remove the point of having recons with spawn beacons.  

If you want attrition and meaningful class roles, stop giving mechanics that make every class a portable support, medic, and recon.  And every player having a medpack is one of these.

Stuff like the Garand being 5HK at long range is  stupid but overall the SMGs, SARs, ARs, and MMGs really did need to be broadly rebalanced and I'm glad you're sticking to your guns (heh).  All of the weapon classes should have roles they're good at.

(that said the idea that every weapon needs to have a specific range at which it's magically better than other weapons of its class is kind of stupid, balancing weapons around accuracy, damage, rate of fire, recoil, mag size, and so on worked much better...)

The vehicle balance and interaction with infantry is really bad and unbalanced too, glad you're taking a look at that.  Flieger and AT weapons need to be un-nerfed.

People are butthurt that balance is changing but everyone knows we got betafield, the game was half-baked at launch and it needed drastic reworking.  Not sure the way you're going about it is right, but it did need to be changed, the SAR + MMG meta was fucking terrible and SMGs worked way out of the range they should.  SMG sniping should not really be a thing outside maybe a niche weapon.

BattlefieldV,ffce1y1,t1_ffbtpn4,1579797455.0,"attrition was bad, giving a freshly spawned newb an advantage defending a point just for spawning in, over a more skilled player surviving multiple encounters to try and push a point is bad game design

I recognize the intent to promote teamwork but that's not how it actually played out in practice.

if you want attrition to ""work"" as a game design concept, you need to get rid of buddy revives and squad spawns and put the defenders at the same disadvantage as attackers in having to play cautiously lest they incur another 60 seconds running from a backline to contest the point.  But BF isn't trying to be a hardcore milsim and that doesn't fit the play experience they're trying for.  

You don't need to give players literally unlimited ammo, but toning down attrition was the right move for a battlefield-style game.

""giving other classes a role"" is only a thing because bad game design degraded the normal things those classes should be doing.  buddy revives and everybody having a healthpack removes the point of having a medic, squad spawns remove the point of having a recon with a spawn beacon to group for a push, players spawning right onto the point means there's no ammo or spawn pressure for defenders (in fact leaving any defenders to sit on a point is worse than useless since you can always spawn in if it's contested, it's a waste of a player that could be pushing, which amplifies the whole zerg mentality).

Some motherboards have always had white noise for me though, and it often modulates as the system boosts up/down.

Vehicles/planes were the only fun I was actually having and they fucked that up.

Went back to BF1, Titanfall, Team Fortress 2, Witcher3, and other games that are way more fun than this.

To answer your question though - the people who are still playing are largely the ones who were super attached to the particular TTK, vehicle balance, and class balance of this title.  Which is why there's been such a backlash on social media.  The game was never particularly well balanced to begin with and the TTK is ludicrously short by the standards of past BF titles, but the people who stayed were the ones who liked that.  

The backlash is way over the top though.  This game was half-baked from the start and needs substantial reform in *game design*, which will inevitably involve changes in weapon balancing.  People are literally getting upset that it's not the same game they played in beta... the half-baked game where assault dominates everything, tanks are useless, planes have no real counter except more planes, and 3/4 of the classes are bordering on useless. Things like attrition were intended well, were supposed to encourage teamwork, but ended up actually just advantaging newly-spawned players against people trying to push and cap. Or the terrible vehicle unlock trees and shallow air meta.  Or how removing 3-D spotting and adding back proning destroyed visibility and turn the game into a corner camping fest. There was and is a ton of stuff that didn’t work and rightfully should not have made it past beta.

The ""I'm quitting"" posts and the guy pretending to be a christmas newb (who ""90% hates the game"" but played the equivalent of over 2 hours every day since christmas...) are mega cringe and the backlash is just a tantrum at this point now.  And I’m glad the mods are cracking down on it. Yes, it's a mess, it's been that way since the start, but if you ever want the game to be fixed up to the standards of previous BF titles then the only way out is through.  DICE is going to have to change stuff, it's not going to be the game you played in beta, because that game sucked in a lot of ways.  Hyper low TTK and lots of screen punch (which are the only things people seem to acknowledge as ""good gunplay"") is not enough to sustain a title with overall bad game design, map design, and class design.

A very vocal part of the player base clearly wants a hardcore rule set to be standard - that’s loud and clear imo - and that’s not the core battlefield experience. Many of those “hardcore” elements are themselves the problem and need to be toned down or removed for BFV to succeed. Not saying this TTK is it, but the game that we played in beta kinda sucked and needed to change.

gadgets,ff7hrd9,t1_ff6v3s8,1579649842.0,"yeah, no, AFAIK it's just Polaroid Originals and Instax left in the market - and they aren't compatible with each other's cameras"
gadgets,ff7hcz1,t1_ff6nobr,1579649576.0,"well, they're selling you film, and it ain't cheap. But it’s more or less par for the course for medium format and large format, it's an expensive hobby.

Polaroid Originals 600 film is $19 per pack, and they've reduced it to 8 photos per pack vs 10 per pack in the OG polaroid 600, so there's some shrinkflation going on too.  So $2.38 per shot, plus tax/shipping. Looks like a bit less for the i-series film, not sure why, it's the same image size.

In contrast Instax Wide instant film is about $0.90 per shot in bulk.  That's the next closest thing that's still in production.  But it's slightly smaller, and more or less only works in Fuji cameras too, all of which are kinda goofy.

Polaroid 600 film is basically 3x3 inches.  Instax Wide film is roughly 2x3"".  

You can also get a camera that takes 120 film and shoot slides - they are a positive image like a Polaroid but on a clear base that you can put against a light source and look through.  They are not instant and do need to be developed by a lab though.  These are measured in cm, not inches, but the most common sizes are 6x6cm (2x2"") and 6x9 (2x3"").

for a comparison on Polaroid Original's film pricing of $2-2.40 per shot:

[A roll of Provia 100F 120 format slide film is $8.47 per roll,](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/181498-USA/Fujifilm_15341588_RDP_III_120_Fujichrome_Provia.html) plus I just paid about $7.50 to have a roll developed via supermarket send-out to fuji (about 3 weeks).  So $16 per roll, and that gets you 12 shots in 6x6 format or 8 shots in 6x9 format.  So somewhere between $1.50 and $2 a shot.  That makes Polaroid Original a little more expensive than 2x3 slides, but in the same ballpark.

Or in B+W negative, you can bring that down to about a buck a shot, but you'd have to scan it, or get it done by the lab while you're developing (which is a bit extra).  Check out [Ilford XP2 Super chromogenic 120 film.](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/153927-REG/Ilford_1839649_XP_2_Super_120_Black.html)

Polaroid Originals is also bringing back pack films, 8x10 is back and presumably they're working on the 4x5/2x3 formats?  You can do some cool stuff with pack films - you get both a positive (original print) and if you save the ""cover slip"" that you peel off, [you can clean it and scan it](https://jonhaverstickstudio.com/2018/02/06/recovering-fujifilm-fp100c-negatives-step-step/) and [get a negative from it too.](https://i.imgur.com/9wIjgvW.jpg)  Right now their 8x10 is $18 per shot (believe it or not, that's not terribly far out of line for 8x10 film, ultra-large-formats get nuts quickly).  Really wish they'd get to work on 4x5 and 2x3 though.

Polaroid and Instax ""integral films"" like 600 or i-series or Instax Wide are both basically toy camera fodder. Instax Wide is priced much better per shot, but it's also a bit smaller (and a 3:2 vs a square format, some people prefer one or the other).  With normal 120 film, you can use toy cameras like a Holga or whatever, but you can also get really high-quality cameras that can produce results equal or better to top-of-the-line modern digital cameras.  The advantage is that slides are easier to scan and duplicate and post online, the downside is they're not instant like a Polaroid.

(Polaroid also made some serious-business cameras like the [110 series](http://camera-wiki.org/wiki/Polaroid_Pathfinder) and [SX-70,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polaroid_SX-70) some of these are being brought back by Impossible Project or can be converted to modern film types, but even with a nice lens it's still a lo-fi kind of aesthetic.  You really can't scan polaroids very nicely, so it's still about the instant nature and the inherent physicality of a one-time direct print.)

I realize film that's $2 or $3 a shot is nuts but the physicality of medium and large format instant prints and slides make them very cool to shoot, and you tend to take your time and set up your shots more carefully rather than banging away like you might on a DSLR.  You don't shoot 10 boxes of polaroids or do 10 rolls of 120 film in a day.  That can be good for your process, it forces you to think it through and develop the idea before committing, or it can be a drag on your learning rate and willingness to experiment.

(again, the price of instax wide probably makes it more palatable than Polaroid for people who just want to goof off at parties or whatever.)

The other interesting angle I've seen recently - there are these [""zink cameras""](https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-zero-ink-instant-cameras-and-printers-zink/) that put out a smaller Instax Wide-size picture.  They are actually digital cameras that take the picture and then send it digitally to the printer part of the camera.  That means you get a digital copy as well as the print, and can print more if you want.  Paper happens to be much cheaper than actual film, 2x3 Polaroid Zink paper is $14 for 50 shots on amazon right now (there is also 3x4 for around $0.60 per shot) and there are multiple brands selling it.  Zink is ""zero ink"", it's a thermal paper style thing, except they managed to get it to do full color somehow.  On the downside - it is basically a cellphone camera with instagram filters and a built-in printer.  It doesn't quite have the mystique of watching an instant print develop."
gadgets,ff7f3i7,t1_ff6yapb,1579648087.0,">  Polaroid film doesn't expire, but it chemicals do become less effective over time

Not sure where you got that.  All film expires over time as the emulsion becomes less sensitive and it picks up background radiation.  The general rule of thumb is film loses one stop of sensitivity per decade. 

On top of the emulsion, the chemicals do also make polaroid film rather sensitive to storage conditions.  It ages fairly fast at room temperature, let's say 5 year shelf life at 70F, and gets really destroyed in days/weeks/months by 100-130F, so you want to refrigerate it.  But if you *freeze* it, you'll pop the packets containing the chemicals inside the film and it won't work right, so it has to be *refrigerated* but not *frozen*.  Which also means that it is aging faster than if it were able to be frozen like other films...

Even the last of the FP100C stock is getting to the point where it's starting to be questionable.  Do you really trust that the minifridge it was sitting in for the last 5 years has never cycled too long and started freezing the contents nearest the cooling coils, on a box of 10 shots you're paying $100 for or whatever?  And the OG polaroid branded stuff is pretty much gone bad at this point even if refrigerated.  Even as a film nerd, I can't in good conscience tell you to spend $100 on a box of very expired, delicate and temperature-sensitive film... unless you really really like it and don't mind potentially getting a box of goo.  And FP100C45 goes for several times that.

Unfortunately, if you want new-production instant film, your choices are Impossible Project/Polaroid Originals or Instax."

CS:GO is an example of an edge case, the 3700X is around 50% faster in this game than the 2700X let alone the 1800X.

Not gonna get dragged into an Intel vs AMD slapfight, but ComputerBase's multi-core applications has a stock 9900K as 1% faster than a 3700X on average and TPU has it 3% faster on average (so probably on par with 3800X), so core for core it is *not slower* than Zen2 on average, even in productivity.  In gaming the numbers are 9% faster minimums and 12% faster averages at CB and 11,5% faster averages at TPU, and 6.5% faster averages at 1080p and 12% faster at 720p.    And that's for a stock 9900K, it's not hard to get 5 GHz if you have the cooling for it.

(although specific multimedia tasks do sometimes favor Zen2, a tied average means you win some and lose some, so it's down to your specific workload.  And Zen2 has other advantages like better per-core cost and more cores available at the top end.  But core for core, and ignoring price?  Intel is still tied or a bit ahead.)

----

Zen1, especially, is a dog.  Zen+ is a bit better but it's still not 1:1 on Zen2 or Intel cores by any means,  A 33%
faster multi-core application average means that *on average a 3600 matches a 1800X in productivity*, and if you game at all, ever, you will be very glad to have the faster cores instead of more, much slower cores.  The minimums are just much, much better on Zen2, Zen1 is measurably not as smooth an experience and will never be, even if games start using more threads.

Sorry if this offends Zen1/Zen+ owners who bought the hype, but it's true.  Zen/Zen+ are bad, don't buy them anymore with the exception of the 1600AF and the 200G/3000G which are the absolute minimum cost parts in their various niches."
