cursedcomments,fdlk3uz,t1_fdljl2f,1578525812.0,"Nothing, airplane electronics always used optic fiber and communication with the control tower used other frequencies.
I'm guessing they made everyone turn it off because electronics could create spurious frequencies that could interfere with the airplanes outbound and inbound rf communication."

TumblrInAction,fbczar4,t1_fbcw8sa,1576739446.0,"The logical fallacy in your argument is, even if you accept 1 and 2 3 is not necessarily true and you stem the rest of your argument from there.

You could say it was an adversarial action, or as 4chan has repeatedly done over the years, just something for shits and giggles someone blew out of proportion.

Which is not to say your argument is wrong, it just depends on your own personal belief that the slogan was made so it would be labeled as a neo nazi symbol. IMO that is pretty far fetched, but I'm not even American so what would I know."
