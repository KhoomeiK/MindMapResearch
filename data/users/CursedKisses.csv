AskReddit,fenymlh,t1_fen8x8r,1579292681.0,"So, in an earlier comment you asked “why is it wrong to ask people to change?”
I don’t believe it’s wrong to ask someone to change-as long as it’s for the better.
However, you have to accept the fact that they may NEVER change. And this is what I mean by take them at face value. Don’t view the person with rose colored glasses or with an idea you have about them... view them just as they are-flaws and all. Can you love them for everything that they currently are? If they were to never change?"
