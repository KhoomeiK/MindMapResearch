He lived close to my house and he was moving back to arizona so the church had a big goodbye party for him. Me and my friend brought 'distraction cookies' over. when we came into his house my little bro ran downstairs and hid in his basement. They left for the party and we let ourselves into his house and TP'd the living shit out of the inside of his place. We took pictures and recorded audio of the event and left the evidence on his dining room table to be developed at his leisure. We joined the party and handed him his on wii remote and the light bulbs went off, he knew we had one something. 

Church leader and family got home. His young kids thought the tp everywhere was awesome and he had a great sense of humor about it....Thank god since we straight up broke into his house and left a mountain of evidence behind lol"
