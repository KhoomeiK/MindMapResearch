aww,fen0grp,t3_epyj0v,1579274196.0,"I found out when I was about 9 years old that I am deathly allergic to baby deer. My cousin found a dead mother deer on the side of the road with the baby close by. He decided to take the baby to a rescue reserve and on the way he brought it over to my house so I could see and pet it. About 10 minutes after petting it my eyes closed shut, hives everywhere and my airway was closing off and off to the emergency room I went."
AskReddit,femy9tk,t1_felh0t7,1579272709.0,Back to square one. So my wife was at the grocery store and bought a little for me to smell (I have a great wife) and it's not it but I did like the scent. It's bold.
AskReddit,fel756n,t3_eppn2i,1579215504.0,"I used to carry a backpack with about 100 things that could quickly kill a person and no one ever batted an eye. I was a data-telecom tech and flew out somewhere every Monday and flew home on Fridays. I carried things like an assortment of screwdrivers in all sizes. My favorite one was a Philips that was about 16"" long. Knives, cutters/snips, a small hammer, A cordless drill with paddle bits and other long drill bits. Acetone and other solvents some probably very flammable, mysterious looking test equipment. No one gave 2 shits until 9/11."

Paladins,feeqwe5,t3_eos8gc,1579039298.0,There is a bug that this will happen for the healing challenge if there is a Raum on your team.
Music,fee7enm,t1_fedepzh,1579027938.0,Same here. They opened for Nirvana in one of Nirvana's last shows. We went to see BHS but their set kinda sucked.

AskReddit,fds6oa7,t1_fdr87jw,1578695564.0,I live in a city in the US where there are two KFC's. One is a KFC only store and the other is a KFC/A&W combo. They are 2 miles from each other. The combo store is far superior in quality and service every time. Not sure if the reason is one is a franchise and one is corporate or what.

AskReddit,fdgvk72,t3_el4ev3,1578409397.0,"I am not a dispatcher but my wife is one and this has nothing to do with dispatching but... I used to be a call taker for computer hardware/software tech support and a lady (a regular) called me and asked what she should do for her computer since a tornado was heading her way in about 5 minutes. ""I yelled, get the hell out of there!"" She called me back about a month later and it sounded weird and echoy and I heard sloshing water. I said, where are you right now? She said that she had just quit her job and was in the bath drinking wine thinking of me. Interesting lady!"
