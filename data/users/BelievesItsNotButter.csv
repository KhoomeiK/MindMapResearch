unpopularopinion,fglu6jh,t1_fgltup1,1580911021.0,"I never claimed that genetic factors take away your ability to lose weight. I claimed that it's much easier for some people to lose weight than others.

It's easy for someone who can eat anything they want and never exercise yet still never gain weight to criticize someone else who has to dedicate a massive amount of effort on a daily basis just to stay the same weight."
unpopularopinion,fgkrik4,t3_eyp05t,1580872003.0,"Can we all just be honest with ourselves and admit that this sub isn't ""unpopular opinion"" but rather ""opinions that are very popular but socially inappropriate to say out loud""?"
unpopularopinion,fgkrapg,t1_fgjrwsa,1580871862.0,"Yeah, I've never understood this. So many people on Reddit act as if fat shaming is some kind of public service. If someone wants to be fat as fuck that's their choice - yay freedom. Just deal with your own shit."
unpopularopinion,fgkqyli,t1_fgkq715,1580871653.0,"In some cases it's genetic. I'm a pretty normal weight (5' 11"" and 157lbs) but that's only because I force myself to walk everywhere and exercise hard for at least an hour a day, and I track every single thing I eat. When I don't, I balloon up to 185lbs or more in a few weeks. I also have friends that can eat whatever they want and never gain weight. A lot of it is the luck of the draw."
unpopularopinion,fgkpo2t,t1_fgkm5z6,1580870867.0,"Maybe it's an introvert thing, but if other people are around then I don't want to be interacting with random friends anyway. I can do that in the evenings when I'm home.

I just have no interest in having random useless conversations with friends throughout the day. If a friend wants to talk, they can hang out in person or call me."
unpopularopinion,fgkpbc0,t3_eyu7nu,1580870651.0,"Completely agree. Nothing against people with nipple piercings, but that would be an instant turnoff for me. It's just... not sexy in the slightest."
unpopularopinion,fgkofxm,t1_fgkcrak,1580870129.0,"Eh, I'd disagree with that. The admins have said that over 50% of traffic is mobile. Reddit used to be a website, but it's more of an app that also has a website if you want to use it these days."

unpopularopinion,fgkniy4,t1_fgkmo3y,1580869575.0,"I should have clarified I meant conversations outside of group texts. That's obviously superior to calling a dozen people in sequence or having a huge conference call.

I have friends that don't need me to talk to them more than a few times a week which is great.

Also, persistent group texts are the fucking worst."

entertainment,fgds98w,t1_fgcwn8t,1580686275.0,"Unless you can provide the evidence you keep mentioning, you don’t really have much of a case. The “evidence” from before the truth came out was simply Amber Heard saying it happened and also putting on makeup before a court appearance to look like she had a black eye.

As someone who dated a narcissistic, abusive woman before, it’s certainly not always a two-sided situation."
iPadPro,fg598rt,t1_fem09jn,1580521486.0,I can’t believe profs are still going on about this these days. Back in 2009 I was taking notes on a convertible laptop and was getting pushback from profs. Never had one outright stop me though.

chefknives,fff6n3h,t1_fe68q7x,1579877053.0,"Luxury cars trade off reliability for performance. A truly reliable part is typically one that's heavy, over-engineered, and durable, while a performance part is ultra-light, super precise, made of exotic materials like carbon fibre or ceramic, and requires frequent replacement.

But if you're buying a luxury car then you can afford to maintain it more often. At least you should..."

Futurology,ff97g5q,t1_ff977w8,1579706610.0,"My definition of ""didn't know"" is the engineering definition - they likely assumed with high certainty that there would be a catastrophic failure (explosion) due to the atmospheric effects, but couldn't say absolutely until the actual test was performed.

Just look at the second stage - most people would have assumed that it would have blown up too, but it actually impacted the ocean almost entirely intact. So many variables and unknowns in a failure situation which is why tests like this are so important."
Futurology,ff95s58,t1_ff95iqz,1579705507.0,"They didn't separate though. They shut off the main booster engines mid-flight simulating a total propulsion system failure at which point the capsule detected a critical failure and automatically ejected.

The explosion wasn't actually part of the test. SpaceX didn't even know if it would blow up or just crash into the ocean until the test itself."
Futurology,ff953rf,t1_ff93c9d,1579705053.0,"They didn’t blow up the booster, it blew up from the air pressure tearing it to shreds after the capsule ejected.

The point of the test was to show that the capsule could escape in a failure situation. The situation chosen was an engine-out scenario, and the test was successful.

They likely chose not to blow the rocket up directly as a sudden failure is more rare than one that escalates over a few seconds, and it’s not controllable which is really important in an objective test. In reality, while the system could theoretically escape an instantaneous explosion, it would be incredibly dangerous and might get damaged by stray shrapnel or something like that."

socialanxiety,ff2uqn8,t1_ff2umjg,1579524937.0,"Yeah, but that means spending 45 minutes of intense anxiety over analyzing what the person said and perfecting a response for every single text I receive. At least with the phone you get more context from the person’s tone of voice and it’s over sooner. With text I find I only send a couple messages before I have to say “anyway great talking to you - bye!”"

science,feoazhd,t1_feoas6u,1579297590.0,"If a scientist locked me in a room after several people I'd been working around suddenly died, explained that I'd infected them and need to quit my job to avoid murdering other people, I'd obviously trust them given that I'm not a psychopath.

It concerns me that your first thought would be to ""escape"" and try to kill again."

spacex,felxyhc,t1_felwm1t,1579233767.0,"It’s automated. Bots are programmed to do this since it’s guaranteed karma in the comments section. The creators can then sell high karma accounts for organic-seeming marketing or grassroots political manipulation.
