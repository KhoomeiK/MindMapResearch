The rest, the actual unusual and ""alien"" part of all this has all been created AFTERWARDS, and does not, in any way, match what we're actually seeing.

We have witness accounts, we have reports of a ""tic tac"", we have reports of this or that, but *nothing* of that is shown in any footage, it's all 3rd-hand tellings.

This makes the Navy videos not any better, BY ANY MEANS, than many other relatively credible UFO sightings.

The NAVY didn't ""confirm"" anything. That is, if you can even believe what they're saying. Common sense says they know much more what is going on (eg. classified military tech).

Also...when you, or anyone else for that matter (and this includes me!!) makes statements like ""there is nothing even close"", ie. regarding the footage itself, this would be credible if I'd be an expert in FLIR footage and would be able to say what we see is really extremely unusual...compared to any other FLIR footage.

Problem: The average person doesn't know shit about FLIR footage, they are not in business to look at this and say ""it's really unusual"" what we're seeing. (In the same way as a random witness off the street about 9/11 bringing in their opinion 'this wasn't how a building is collapsing' is meaningless..UNLESS you are an expert in demolitions etc.). I say it again, nothing ""UFO-like"" or whatsoever in this footage. And the odd things we see can easily (!) be explained.

Edit: I am not ""debunking"" this because I have some joy doing it for some reason. I'd be all up for it if this was the smoking gun.

I am sleeping with a fan on always as I have slight tinnitus, and fan noise also helps sleep and covers other noises.  I absolutely ""hear"" talking and music (you'd be surprised, it spawns everything from country, to pop, to rock, to Gregorian chants etc.)...except I KNOW it's simply a trick of the brain which tries to make sense of random, static noise and that the ""music"" or ""talking"" is created by the fan.

Long time ago I read about a case where (again) an elderly person had exactly this happening, and complained to the landlord about ""neighbors playing music at night"". (Turns out he heard the ""music"" when his A/C run....)

There is also a famous (?) case of an elderly lady on a plane which after they landed tells her family how great the flight was and she really liked the music they played. What she heard was the engine noises from the plane...

This is so super-fascinating to me as I also noticed that the quality of the ""voices"" and ""music"" from the fan seems to be linked to how relaxed/tired I am.

migraine,fen1vud,t3_e0tfhx,1579275121.0,"WOW! This my headaches/migraines to the dot! Except I have these headaches essentially as long as I can think...for many, many decades.

It often starts out like an inconvenient pressure, right above the eyes (either one side, or both), some day left, next day same thing, but right. The pressure radiates from the exact position you lined up there, back and ""into the eye socket"", and at some point then can develop into a migraine. Same symptoms like classical migraine, light/sound sensitivity...and need quiet and IBUPROFEN and then only waiting, sometimes 6-7 hours until it gets better.

I did a lot of amateur research on this and I think it's a type of migraine which is intratrochlear neuralgia. As I understand it, this is  an inflamed nerve.

BOTOX shots might help, and there are also surgeries. The idea is that the nerve for some reason is trapped and then gets inflamed, causing migraine.

I am in the same boat, have brightness setting on the PC way down and blue-light filter. I notice being on the PC for long but also in bright sunlight is a MAJOR trigger, which I think is from squinting and straining the eyes.

Pressure with the thumbs on these spots sort of gives relief.

Trust me, I wished for more than one time to just rip out these nerves as these migraines cost me already a good part of my life. I wish I could help, but I found one thing that ""sort of"" can help it...this is when I feel it coming on (say after hours on the PC etc.)....stop immediately being on the PC (because this will 100% make it worse), but sit in the dark, relax the eyes and slightly massage with slight pressure, maybe for an hour or so..this can help."

But in every (!) ""socialist"" country where we have ""socialist"" health insurance, you can (and sometimes should) also simply buy private health insurance. 

I bought private insurance here in Spain, for two people (me, and wife). This covers 100% of medical, top of the line, and includes also a basic dental. The cost for us both is €158,80/month respective €80/m per person. (Only requirements is a valid ID, it's as easy as buying a toaster online.)

It's possible that you have a limited choice of doctors with ""socialist"" health care (at least in Spain), but no so in Germany for example. (I mean there are dozens if not hundreds of docs in any standard city, you can go to any of them)

With private health insurance, there are hundreds of docs to choose from. It is is very unlikely that for a certain test or a screening you would have to wait ""for 3 months"" as you can just choose another doc *IF IT SHOULD BE* that one has a wait for certain appointments. (Highly unlikely, IMO).

So the old tale of ""3 months waiting"" is just another conservative tale they tell to make themselves feel better for paying out of the ass.

Most importantly, no one ""forces"" you to stay in mandatory/gvt healthcare if for some reason you don't want to. Getting preferred treatment and other perks is one reason that people often choose private over gvt."

I think I see what you mean, it's just that someone could interpret it wrongly. So yes, NTSC had to be analog, but so was any other standard back then. We had PAL, which of course was 90000x better than yours :) but it was also analog..."
explainlikeimfive,fei7kou,t1_fehb33t,1579132053.0,"It's not THAT long ago when TV was still all analogue. (Correct me if wrong, but TV back in the states but also still widely in Europe, at least in the early 2000s was analogue, and people still used ""antennae"" and all that BS. They only switched to all-digital in the last some years.)

So with TV having been analogue for such a long time, it's not ""far fetched"" that the signals had also been recorded analogue, just like cassette tape recordings. 

The only ""difference"" (now really spoken ELI5-ish) is that the bandwidth (aka the amount of information that is being recorded and played) of video was much higher than that for audio tape. This is also why VHS had a fast rotating head which ""wrote"" on a much wider magnetic tape. The ""principle"", if you will however is the same."

history,fehsj7m,t1_fehgs2q,1579123013.0,"In all fairness, the implication that there are cities where old bombs are ""still inflicting harm and mayhem"" as in ""many people constantly dying from it"" is sensationalist and simply not true.

Old bombs being found and defused is every-day routine in Germany. I do not know of a single instance where large numbers of civilians got harmed by old ordinance, and according to the article there had been eleven killed bomb defusers since 2000, but this includes all Germany.

Just saying that the article mentioning ""Oranienburg is the most dangerous town in Germany"" to me sounds awfully exaggerated as it implies something which just isn't so in reality. (Not saying that eleven defusers having died should be disregarded, but it's not so that bombs go off left and right in Germany as one might think reading this). (In fact, I couldn't even tell you a case where a bomb actually exploded and caused major damage??)"

The explanation with the volcanoes is idiotic.

Also..why I believe that the hum is real and that some people may hear it...caution as there are MANY fake videos on Youtube etc. about ""strange noises"". So just because it's on YT doesn't mean much.

Also: The ""trumpet sounds"" and ""mechanical sounds"" (where there are 9billion clips on Youtube) have NOTHING to do with the classic hum. Absolutely different. (Personally I think the ""trumpet noises"" clips are mostly fake and were just a social Youtube phenomenon related to the ""2012 end of the world hype""). Again, just because there is some BS on YT doesn't mean it's real.

The hum, as mentioned is..well..a ""hum"", like an idling truck, and people often hear it at night, 2-3am, and as the stories go it drives them insane, they can't sleep, get anxious etc and when they want to check on the source of the noise they never find anything. Very different to ""trumpet sounds"" from the heavens IMO."
