The truth is women don't have as high of standards as these people think, and that nobody wants them because they have mentalities like this."

gaming,feyoonw,t1_fewr71w,1579448418.0,"I used it a lot for Skyrim and Fallout. I spent hours setting it up. The mouse pads were a great idea and amazingly accurate and smooth, but the controller itself was bad execution. It was too bulky (kind of like the original Xbox controllers. I also have small thumbs so reaching the left analog for movement wasn't comfortable at all. If the left analog and pad were switched out I might have loved it, but playing on the Steam controller for months then switching back to an Xbox controller immediately finalized the decision to sticking with the Xbox controller."
