WTF,feagctz,t1_feab3o4,1578948395.0,"I never said if acupuncture is legit or not. I'm just saying you don't know regardless. No, subjective experience doesn't mean placebo effect. It means that all pain is literally subjective."
Android,fe8rpod,t1_fe8ivey,1578929862.0,Well if you drop your phone the camera automatically pulls back in.
AskAnAmerican,fe056r8,t1_fdzqjs6,1578803341.0,I don't think it looks bad at all. It's just that it looks like something you put on a sports jersey.
WTF,fdwumkf,t1_fdv760v,1578762449.0,"I mean it really depends on what site/who you are asking if it works. You can't sit there and act like you know, when it reality nobody really does.

YoungThug,fdnr6jp,t1_fdnm9zi,1578591237.0,"Yeah. Like dont get me wrong I listen to his official songs sometimes, but when i'm in the car its literally all leaks."
AmItheAsshole,fdc2dvh,t1_fdbwcvs,1578265743.0,"That article is very bad, but you can still use it to disprove your point. I'll use the OP to give examples.

1: No invasion of privacy happened. By going on someone else's property (yard), because you are not in a place where you expect privacy (like a bathroom), there is no invasion of privacy done.

2: No defamation. Defamation has multiple requirements to be considered ""defamation"". One of those is passing a false statement as fact. Chances are that if there is video of someone doing something, that means they probably did it. No lying/false statement there.

3: ""Commercial use"". Just posting a video does not mean you are using it for commercial use. Commercial use *usually* includes that you are portraying the person recorded in a manner in which they endorse a product."
AskReddit,fckdinn,t1_fckcxjf,1577722896.0,"Well I was just interested because vortex engines are being made today, and I was wondering if the repulsine engine could be real. I don't know how vortex engines work or if it would be comparable to the repulsine engine if it actually existed."
AskReddit,fckcf3k,t1_fcjzojv,1577722186.0,"What about Viktor Schauberger and his repulsine/vortex engine? Was that part of the hoax too :( ?

This website had me interested when I first heard about it: https://frankgermano.wordpress.com/viktor-schauberger-the-repulsine/"
aww,fc4q2m4,t1_fc4phbh,1577424345.0,"Seems we were both right then lol. The malinois in her would be the the slightly bjgger ears, the black face, and the slightly wider, rounder snout. The Elkhound would be the puffier, rounder neck, most of the coat fluffines and color, and the tail."
howdidtheycodeit,fc4l1ev,t1_fc4apcu,1577419792.0,"He said everytime he applies a force to the character, they apply a opposite force to every other physics object in the world. Doesn't do anything to performance, because they are pretty much already applying forces to objects. Its just another number added on top. When you jump in game, you are pretty much still, and all the planets are being pushed away/below from you."
aww,fc4hkhi,t1_fc4gsx3,1577416863.0,"Yeah, I guess you are right. The more I look at it the more I see it. Ears are much bigger and the snout is a lot different."
aww,fc4fv26,t1_fc4egxf,1577415451.0,"This dog has a curly tail though? I have a elkhound and she does look like this dog more than a malinois. Not gonna say it's a elkhound because I honestly don't know, but that is a better guess than mailinois imo"
dogs,fbwiv2t,t1_fbv5mcx,1577151092.0,"Don't you think it would be better if you are going to get another puppy, to get it when the other dog is a puppy also? That way it can trust and adjust to having another dog easier and less stressfully?"
