Codependency,fdj9n0g,t3_elapzh,1578462489.0,"I have to politely disagree with the idea that love has to become routine as it matures. Yes, there are elements of a relationship that become routine but if you don't let the fire go too dim or go out all together, if you both work the billows 100/100 to keep the flames fanned, then the passion CAN remain for a lifetime.

I do like the poem but it makes me sad too. It makes me sad because I'll likely never find that. Even though that's what I want and that's what the author wants (or her fictional character), to find a partner like that, one that passionately loves me just as much as I would love them, with nothing standing the way, is a very rare thing indeed.  There's so many variables and elements and conditions, etc. etc. that are involved in a romantic relationship in this day and age."
Codependency,fdj82h5,t3_elnunj,1578461113.0,Take some time for yourself and enjoy your freedom.
Codependency,fdj5mxw,t3_elfrux,1578459113.0,That was beautiful. I'm glad you're getting though it and making strides to make the necessary changes in yourself that you need to for your future happiness with yourself and in your future. Hang in there.
depression,fd7uvkw,t1_fd6otic,1578210481.0,I'm sorry that you're being treated that way. Your story makes me sad. I hope he comes out of it and starts appreciating your more and wanting you to be more apart of each others lives if that's what's meant to be.
depression,fd6q5vo,t1_fd6ml9e,1578194371.0,Despite everything she's done to me I still struggle everyday thinking about her. 8 years with her and I've learned that I'm totally codependent with her. I knew I could never quit her or other things I was doing that was killing me physically and emotionally so I moved across the country not knowing anyone here where I'm at and have found a great recovery community here and I've been clean from Sarah and the other things I was addicted to for 51 days now. Thank you for your support and your kind words.
depression,fd64uyi,t3_ek3uky,1578185554.0,"Similar thing happened to me. We were just married too. She started pulling away from me and talking to this younger dude at her work. I found out and over the next three months fell into the worst depression of my life. I went to Vanderbilt's psych hospital for ten days at the end of it because I got to where I was literally at the end of my rope. I found out later on she was fucking that guy as soon as I went to the hospital. I found that out about two months later. Realistically, she was probably fucking around before then even, that's just what she finally admitted to me was when I was in the hospital. Anyway, please don't take her back is she tries to get back with you.  I separated from her immediately after I found out and then she begged me to forgive her and take her back and so I did and five years later, just two months ago, I found out she's been cheating on my again for a while with another younger dude. It's been so hard but I've cut myself off from her completely because apparently she'll never change despite the fact she claims she loves me but 'just has a problem'. Anyway, I'm rambling. It's going to be tough but at the end of the day she didn't care enough about you to keep her legs closed in your time of need and also your 'friend' is an even bigger piece of shit and I'd cut him off too. Eventually you'll forgive them, hopefully, but you'll never forget. I'm sorry you're going through this."
whatsthisbug,fd0g8lc,t1_fd07pna,1578118345.0,That's a good point. Lol
whatsthisbug,fczx37j,t1_fczwzkj,1578110108.0,Lol yeah glad I didn't put them on without noticing him!
whatsthisbug,fcztqfm,t3_ejqv7z,1578108458.0,"This spider was very aggressive. It would rair up every time I would walk past it. It's not a brown recluse, as I have seen plenty of them in my day. It is light brown in color however and it was about an inch and a half in diameter. Location is middle Tennessee."
Drugs,fcavmnn,t1_fcavcc8,1577577498.0,It has the same chemical formula as d-methamp and always looks like prefect shards. Too perfect almost. Just makes you feel weird and even sick is your do too much of it. I've been burnt with it a couple of times then learned what to look for and never again. That's also msm which is easier to get. You have to order n-iso from the internet.

alcoholicsanonymous,fcamec3,t3_egk68h,1577572122.0,"My sponsor tells me to do this and I too struggle with it. I struggle with making friends and connecting with people, especially other men, in general. I think it's just something you have to force yourself to do and eventually it becomes easier. At least I hope that's the case anyway."
depression,fc6w27q,t1_fc6vkp5,1577490976.0,"I'm truly sorry, man. Then you know what you've got to do."
depression,fc6shyu,t1_fc6s616,1577488357.0,"All you can do is try to talk to her about it. Be completely honest and apologize, then if she doesn't accept it or still wants nothing to do with a relationship with you, then you'll just have to accept it and move on as difficult and as painful as that may be. If that's the case then it too shall pass."
depression,fc6qidf,t3_eghyoy,1577486923.0,I'm sorry bro. I know that pain well. Rejection hurts no matter what. Sounds like a little self sabotage to me. Like maybe you feel like you don't deserve to be wanted/loved/liked by someone. When you say meds do you mean illegal substances or prescription psych meds?
Drugs,fc6q6sb,t3_eghou0,1577486696.0,Bruh that sounds like a killer fucking idea!
Drugs,fc6pwr0,t3_egei1p,1577486500.0,I'd take 2g for a mild first trip. 1g just isn't enough. 3.5g if you really want to experience what it's all about. Remember set and setting is very important. Also remember if things get a little too heavy just keep reminding yourself that you will come back to your normal self and thinking in a few hours. Have a good trip.
Codependency,fc6l8fl,t1_fc6hwys,1577483220.0,"That's a perfect analogy and so true. She is definitely like a powerful drug to me and just like a powerfully addictive drug, it's so hard to quit her. But finally after almost 9 years I realize how much more the consequences greatly out way the benefits of being in a relationship with her. I just wish I could've been strong enough to do this so much sooner and saved myself some years and a lot of heartache. Thank you for sharing."
Codependency,fc6bi5a,t3_egfhtj,1577476707.0,Actually this is my second post. Forgot about the one I posted on the AA subreddit a couple of weeks ago.

electronicmusic,fc5zxi6,t1_fc5xxg0,1577469269.0,"Oh and one more album I love albeit very minimalistic and subdued but great none the less is, 'R.I.P.' by Actress. Ok I'll shut up but thank you again and I just get all school boy for some reason when I find someone that has such similar musical tastes as me."
electronicmusic,fc5ywfl,t1_fc5ymcu,1577468713.0,"Same, but Black Sands let me to the remixes and then the rest of his works."
electronicmusic,fc5xxg0,t1_fc5upcf,1577468202.0,"I'll check it out. Did you know he has a PhD in neurobiology? I think that has definitely shaped his music. Two albums I love from this is decade is Nosaj Thing's, 'Home' and Bonobo's  'The North Borders'."
electronicmusic,fc5u7re,t3_egbsy3,1577465991.0,Nice job man. Thank you for compiling this. We have very similar tastes in music. A lot of tunes I love on here and a lot more I apparently need to check out. Radiohead is my all time fav band too btw.
alcoholicsanonymous,fc1k7ur,t3_effec3,1577321236.0,I've got 40 days today. My first sober Christmas in 26 years myself. Thanks for the share!
