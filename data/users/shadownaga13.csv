When he's there we go straight to him with questions, bypassing my MSM, and someone on my team probably calls him at least once a week to get clarification on something my MSM said or with a problem that my MSM can't be bothered to solve. 

For example, when we did the second or third to last curtain reset where we just put new display curtains up but they were too long for the not yet restructured product lay out, my manager said to get a pair of scissors and cut them.

cats,fe2awfi,t3_ennath,1578836396.0,"Most bags of dry food have serving size recommendations. Making sure a food bowl is full 24/7 is excessive, and can lead to overfeeding. Our cats each get 1/3 cup of dry food in the morning, and 1/3 cup in the evening, which means that we put out q total of 2 cups of food per day for three cats. 100g is apparantly equal to about 2/3 a cup, or thw total amount of food each of my cats get per day.
