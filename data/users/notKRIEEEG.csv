3d6,ffg8b5s,t1_fffgtz3,1579900627.0,"I'm almost sure that there is a way to math out the answer. 

With Extra Attack, Hunter's Mark adds 2d6 per round, against 1d12+5 from Frenzy Attack. It averages at 7 and 11.5 respectively. 

If you go Hunter's Mark at the first round, it means that you're delaying one Frenzy Attack  (from round 2 to round 3). 

Round 1 you will deal more damage, Hunter's Mark as bonus action and then attack for 30 damage. Round two frenzy as a bonus, and attack for another 30. Round 3 attack for action and bonus for 45 points of damage. This totals 105 damage over 3 rounds. 

The alternative is to attack and rage for the first  round, dealing 23 damage. Then attacking for action and bonus, dealing 34.5 damage and the second and third round, for a total of 82 damage over 3 rounds.

Even with GWM and all hits, going with Hunter's Mark gives you 175 damage over 3 rounds, against 162 with earlier frenzy. 

TL:DR - If you can afford to go a round without Rage, Hunter's Mark will increase your DPR right from the get go. And there is nothing stopping you from opening with a salvo of shots from a longbow and switching to melee in round 2 when you get that sweet dmg resistance."
3d6,ffey3ta,t1_ffdysp1,1579870047.0,"Also, with Favored Foe, you get Hunter's Mark without concentration to be cast a number of times equal to your Wisdom Mod. This means that in any combat in which you have the luxury of delaying your rage by a round, or to prep a spell to be cast beforehand, you can have it up while raging.

It is one of the few ways for a Barbarian to have a self buff going.

On that note, a Frenzy Barb would probably go poorly for a Hunter's Mark build in the terms of synergy between Frenzy and Hunter's Mark. It would require 1 turn to Activate Hunter's Mark, 1 turn to Rage/Frenzy, 1 Turn to finally get your Bonus Action attack going. 3 turns means that the combat is close to ending already in most cases.

On the other hand, makes for a solid back-up for a Berserker if a short rest is still some ways away, as it boosts his damage without giving him exhaustion."

weightroom,ff5vgbt,t3_erpvkv,1579611623.0,"Currently doing 20 reps for the bench for a single set, Super Squats style. So far, so good. 2 or 3 times a week, one more KG to each side of the bar every workout. Started at 108 lbs, currently at 139. 10RM was 174, so I think I might stall in a week or two (or do 20 reps with my 10RM, which is the goal).

Once I stall, think I might drop to 15 rep sets, then 12, then 10, etc until I'm doing singles and see where it takes me.

So far, I'm pretty sure that I'm at least getting much more proficient with the bench press, if not stronger at it.

Doing the same-ish for rows, only difference is that every other workout I swap the 20 reps for cheating explosive sets of 5 for as much weight I can before the bar starts to slow down too much. It's fun and worth the bruised stomach."

My point was that there was no need for her to be stuck in Hell after the spell was cast simply for the plot hook, as the same could be achieved by the desire to get revenge or to simply do the right thing and stop the cult.

Personally, I tend to not be a dick to relevant NPCs on my characters backgrounds. Off screen murdering of significant others is cheap. 

Wanna use them for drama and higher stakes? Fine, let the players know that an orc band is marching towards the city or village where they live, give the players a chance to save them and make them weight the decision of going there vs following the current quest line.

Don't just say ""she ded, no take bac"" after the player invested in the NPC has gone through so much to try and revive her. What made this cheap IMO was the combination of it all:

Off screen murdering + long quest to correct + denial of reward.

 Each one of those can be fine individually and can contribute to the story. Two of them are annoying together. All three is just stupid."

If the DM needed a hook for the PC to keep pursuing the cult, the wife saying something like ""babe, they've tortured me to no end and are trying to conjure this beast demon from hell, they used me as sacrifice for opening a portal so they could operate from the 9th circle"".

dndnext,fet5g4e,t1_feshkat,1579371989.0,"So, my old campaign, derrailed at session #3:

The 5 Level 2 PCs are coming back from raiding an old Goblin Temple. 3 are the main players who were playing since session 1, the last 2 are just joining the campaign.

They found an Exceptional Longsword (+1 to hit, non magical) and a pack full of Random Effect Flasks ™ (table bellow). On their way back, they stop by a mining camp for rest. The miners are visibly well fed and armed with simple weapons, their barracks are considerably luxurious, upon conversation with the leader of operations, they find out that the miners are pretty well paid and cared for. They are offered a barrack to sleep on their own for the night. The latest shaft expansion has opened the path for an underground goblin temple and while the barricade is holding strong, it has at most a week before it is overcome. They decide to think for the night and talk business in the morning.

They eat with some of the miners. The rogue steals some cutlery with the wizard serving as a distraction, the barbarian dwarf dwarves out, the judgy paladin tries to keep things from spiriling out, and the ranger is busy bringing us food IRL. Talking among themselves at their barracks, they decide that they don't want to fuck the the goblins, it is too dangerous. With that, they go to sleep in wooden barracks.

The 3 original players, lead by the CN rogue decide that a cool prank would be to throw their remaining 6 Random Effect Flasks at the Paladin and Wizard, who are sleeping.

They throw their first 3 as a surprise round, with the Paladin and the Wizard auto failing the Dex Save. They get a Glue, Fire and Poison. Second round the Paladin and Wizard have no movement left, are a second hail of flasks come. Fire, Fire , Cold. The Wizard goes down, Barb, Rogue and Ranger run away. Paladin carries Wizard away, heals him and they give chase.

The first 3 run towards the feeding hall, with the last 2 chasing them about 150ft behind. On their way there, their sleeping barracks erupts on flame, due to the uncontained fire from the flasks. The first 3 decide to change their route towards the main hall and put the blame on the paladin and the wizard.

Once they get there, the whole mining complex is watching and gathering with weapons drawn. They are brought to the leader, while the 2 watch from a window. Negotiations go poorly for the 3, but the leader announces that the 2 are also going to pay. Wizard casts Charm Person on Leader, who fails the Save. The leader agrees that incarceration is too harsh, and they should be free while an investigation is made (wink wink). Wizard decides that this is not enough, so Firebolts the leader.

5 level 2 PCs, divided amongst themselves, two at very low HP against 20 commoners. They lasted 5 rounds before getting TPK'ed.

Next session I'm asked: ""Hey, can we have more dungeons instead of fighting people in cities? And we'd like to have some more balanced fights, that TPK felt really unfair!""

I disagree here. I was someone who consumed massive amounts of RSD content. I was somewhere around 18 yo, virgin, had kissed maybe two chicks and couldn't get myself to even say hi to a girl if I found her attractive. I was pretty much desperate for human contact, like a non-toxic incel. 

I was constantly wondering what the hell was wrong with me, everyone my age that I  knew had had sex, were in relationships or could at the very least makeout with someone in a club. And there was me, not that ugly, kinda charismatic and completely stuck. I had nobody to talk to about it, I would have to admit to my friends or family that I was a virgin after some years of lying, so I went online.

I think I stumbled over the Julien Blanc manifesto on YouTube. He said he had the secret to talk to girls. I was all ears. I watched all there was on YouTube, pirated the paid content and was active on the forum.

In 99% of their videos they actually seem like good people. It's all about making the girls comfortable and willing to go with you. To someone with zero knowledge of how to talk to girls, things like ""pushing through Last Minute Resistance"" doesnt sound all that problematic after an hour or two of mental gymnastics. When you get to that 1% which is really damming, you kinda assume that it's poorly explained and there is a lack of context to it. Afterall, they talk about recognizing the Hard No all the time. 

I think I've followed them for a year or two, made almost no progress whatsoever (aside from going sober and alone to unknown clubs, I got incredibly better at talking to people after that), and forgot about it, but for the whole time they had me hooked hard.

AskGameMasters,fdoei7w,t1_fdndw7r,1578603624.0,"What are you doing for his Assassinate feature? How are your combat encounters laid out? Are the players usually delving inside a dungeon in which he can scout ahead and get a few auto crits in a session?

The Assassin is very comparable to a Berserker. If the DM is not somewhat lenient about encounter design, the class suffers A LOT. If you throw 5+ encounters at a Berserker a day, he becomes just a Barbarian that can't be charmed for 80% of the time. Same with Assassin, his level 3 feature needs a DM who is willing to say ""fair enough, you surprised those guys"".

From the SRD:

>Surprise  
>  
>A band of adventurers sneaks up on a bandit camp, springing from the trees to attack them. A gelatinous cube glides down a dungeon passage, unnoticed by the adventurers until the cube engulfs one of them. In these situations, one side of the battle gains surprise over the other.  
>  
>The GM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the GM compares the [Dexterity](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Dexterity) ([Stealth](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Stealth_Skill)) checks of anyone hiding with the passive [Wisdom](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Wisdom) ([Perception](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Perception_Skill)) score of each creature on the opposing side. Any character or monster that doesn't notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.

To qualify for an Auto Crit, all he needs is to beat the passive perception of his enemies and act before them in combat. Have him take Alert as a feat and max out his DEX asap. Expertise should take care of the Sneak part, so he should never have many problems to beat the passive perceptions of regular mooks. Alert and 20 Dex means a +10 to Initiative, which means that he should be doing great at acting first.

For the One-Shot part, here's what he can do:

**Paladin Multiclass.** Auto Crit and Smite makes min-maxers cream their pants. Maybe throw him a bone with Warlock as well for restoring some Spell Slots on a Short Rest.

**Ranger Multiclass.** Extra Attack at level 5 for more stuff critting. Extra Extra Attack for Gloom Stalker first round, for more burst (with a 1d8 to boost). +WIS to Initiative. *PASS WITHOUT A FUCKING TRACE,* gotta surprise them all! Some nice thematic spells.

**Munchkin Power Build for Assholes!** Half Orc Assassin Rogue 3/Gloomstaker Ranger 3/Fighter Any 11+. Pick GWM. Open with Finesse weapon for Sneak Attack, drop it for a 1d12 weapon after first hit. This means on an Auto Crit:

* 1 attack @ 3d8+4d6+15 - Sneak Attack
* 2 attacks @ 3d12+15 - Extra Attack 
* 1 attack @ 3d12+2d8+15 - Dread Ambusher
* 1 Bonus Action attack @ 3d12+15 - GWM
* 3 Attacks @ 3d12+15 - Action Surge!
* 1 Attack @ 3d12+2d8+15 - Dread Ambusher
* An average of 336,5 Damage on his opening salvo without a magic weapon of any kind

He seems **not** to want to do everything, but rather seems to want to one shot really well from what you've said. Nonetheless, if he just wants to do everything well: Rogue 11/Bard 2

Rogue 11 gets you Reliable. If you got proficiency in something, you can take a 10 if rolled bellow it. Bards 2 gets you Jack of All Trades, which allows you to add half Prof to everything you lack proficiency in.

From what you've said, I don't think the player is *that* wrong. It may just need some encounter building adjustments for him to shine."

Gaze of Two Minds allows you to see and hear through any willing creature as long as they are in the same plane of existence as you, with no duration, as long as you're using your action to extend the duration for as long as you like.

Start with Suggestion to get someone neutral or hostile to follow your commands. Put your command as ""Let me see through your eyes while you interrogate the prisoner wihtout telling anyone. Come back here after you're done"". The spell allows one or two sentences, and unless its something that would actively harm the target, it just works (after a Wis Save, of course).

You can then see and hear everything they do. Once they come back, cast Modify Memory to make them forget you were ever there.

Going for GOOlock also gives you free telepathy right from the get go.

Pack it with whatever kind of CHA caster you want (great arguments for both Sorcerer, Bards and even Wizards on this thread, but the last is MAD) for some resource free flavor and a great offensive cantrip with nothing but a 2 Level Dip."

If they are using inhalatory anesthetics, they can easily, cheaply, and safely extend the duration of the surgery by quite a while. If this happened in any first world country, they should be using inhalatory ones by default, specially at a U$250,00 price.

There is absolutely no valid reason not to attempt to call the client. Extending the procedure by an extra 5 minutes is not a problem. If the client does not answer, the right call for a small procedure such as this one is not to do it.

Dealing with a newly grown teeth while the baby teeth are still in place is not a hard thing to do. Proper cleaning would deal with most problems that could be created by it, despite the small chance for missalignment.

There should have been a warning, even as a safe guard for the vet/hospital. I work at a vet clinic and seen people fired for things like that, as well as the regional vet board getting involved."

DnDHomebrew,fczide3,t1_fcyvay8,1578101909.0,"I feel like a simpler input would be to move it to legendary and keep some extra aspects  of it. 

* The resistance ignoring flame could be explained with lore rather easily    
* Having to use your action for a Shove is already doable and rarely used, so I'd feel that just giving it extra range in exchange for some limitations  (only pull) is a pretty minor effect    

This weapon for me, flavor wise, seems like it's made to have the user grappling and shoving his targets all the time, while keeping the grapple and shove action competitive with the attack action. 

To achieve what this weapon tries to accomplish, I would make it so: 

* Grappling or Shoving takes an action, and it is a contested check as normal. I'd even consider to allow a Dexterity(Athletics) for the grappler, as the Whip is a finesse weapon.   
* While the target is grappled, it takes damage equal to the damage caused by an attack with this weapon at the start of each of its turns.   
* If the grappler is within 10ft of the target, he can't drag it while moving it. Once the grappler is at least 10ft away, his speed is halved and the target can be moved as normal.    
* While grappling a target, the wielder can't attack with this weapon. 

This makes grappling a target a decent compromise between control and damage, it avoids stepping too much on Battlemaster territory  (and can be used by one as a complement) as it still reduces the damage of any martial class.

It also becomes much harder to be abused, as the damage it deals while grappling is not an attack, it can't benefit from Sneak Attack or Blade cantrips, and any buff to the Whip, such as Holy Weapon, would still consume resources.

The main problem I see with it could  be with dual wielding, but I'm quite frankly rusty with its rules and don't remember if a full attack action can be used with the off hand weapon only. But, in any case, it would only bring it on par with PAM in terms of damage."

Edit, just so I don't throw a problem without some attempt at a solution: I don't know shit about MLP or its porn, but a good idea would have been to look for characters that have not been subjects to Rule 34, if there are any, and look for ways to mimic the characteristics that spared them from it when designing the make a wish character.

dndmemes,fcspxjo,t1_fcsmvbg,1577922139.0,"I put down magic item vendors exactly for that, the IC justification is that it actually makes sense. The OOC is that I was annoyed by them and they were getting unsatisfied by the shopkeepers. And I get their view, after they get a good armor set and maybe a pack mule or a cart, there is very little non magical stuff to buy. 

So there you go: magical barracks with everything to satisfy your shopping needs! Select magical items need downtime to find, but buying one out of the collection I made is a non time consuming activity for any adventurer with too much money in their pockets.

Other things I do to make money relevant:   
* Less overall gold thrown around in the world. People deal with silver.    
* Basic weapons have a -1 modifier until the 5th fight with it, but cost their price in one coin kind down  (5gp is 5sp, cp weapons have no downgrades). Reason being the imperfections take some time to get used to.    
* Weapons have Excellent and Masterwork versions. First one carries no modifier and has its price in gold x2. Second one has a +1 and has its price is platinum, can be enchanted enough to get through magical resistances without having any kind of magical effect by itself.  
* A whole wackier table of enchantments for weapons that add utility and battlefield control. Costs a lot and can only be put into Masterwork+ Weapons, so players get even more excited by the weapons itself.   
* Spell like potions and bombs and poisons. Costs 100(spell level) gp and only works for some selective spells.    
* Drugs! Because rules are for the prude! Concentrate on two spells at once, have a Bonus Bonus Action, Con Mod reactions, get Temp HP every round! Whatever you want, you can get if you can pay the price, physically, mentally, and goldly! Adction is expensive, but oh boy! is it fun!
* Aircrafts, stronghold, your personal army or guild   
* Upgrades such as automated ballistas and following scrying orbs to protect the players property   

This kind of stuff makes players quite a bit more powerful, so should take some care to include, especially if in a situation where the DM is running his combat by the official CR calculations. But as I run some heavily homebrewed encounters, I can put some balance to it.

IMO DnD and Skyrim are very much alike, in the fact that the vanilla experience is okay, but you gotta mod it to get the most of the game"
