AmItheAsshole,ffc6f9q,t1_ffbt194,1579792620.0,Well said! I'm mixed (black and Indian) I would much rather have been raised by a loving white couple than my racist abusive black Jamaican and white French mother! Loving parents matter more than colour every time.
AmItheAsshole,ffc5umh,t3_esqoi4,1579792234.0,NTA! I'm mixed (black and Indian) even parents of the same or similar ethnic backgrounds can fail to teach their children about their heritage. As long as you and your wife teach them about their heritage and try your best to understand racism then I see no problem. I am from England but I know 2 white doctors from Texas who have an Indian adopted daughter and a mixed black and Indian adopted son. They've done a wonderful job of bringing them up.

britishproblems,ff8o4je,t1_ff8nomf,1579688385.0,Tell me about it! They all seem to have those horrible vertical blinds which allow everyone to see right into your home when they're open. I have voiles/net curtains and curtains but roller blinds in the kitchen. Curtains and nets allow light in but maximum privacy.
trashy,ff8iyn8,t1_ff7eubq,1579680635.0,Well said. I've know a few men over the years who own several properties to rent out or own a successful business. They way they keep their money is by not spending it. Lots of people struggling over have these new shiny PCP cars. These successful men would have something like a 1996 Volvo estate car.

britishproblems,ff5lou1,t1_ff5ljbw,1579599014.0,"They are rubbish. I remember in the 90s a group of work men were pulling what I am pretty sure was asbestos out of the ceilings to the shed areas along Sackville Close and Woburn Close. I was about 8 at the time and I would hang around these work men for 2 weeks as they used to buy me ice cream. They never tried anything dodgy, I think they just felt sorry for me. Anyway when I was 17 I was diagnosed with this rare autoimmune disease called Sarcoidosis which primarily affects my lungs and eyes. Doctors don't know the cause but interestingly a lot of 9/11 first responders ended up with it as well!"

There was so much publicity about it that I'm not sure the Government would have got away with it so nothing happened. Our 7/7 underground bombings were as fishy as hell.

AmItheAsshole,ff33xnx,t1_ff2yko6,1579533053.0,"Exactly. It's never been a shortening in the UK. You're right, we call people from Pakistan Pakistani. Even though I'm half Indian and half black Jamaican I've been called a  Paki numerous times."

AmItheAsshole,ff30siw,t1_ff2vspd,1579530620.0,"No, it really isn't. Here in the UK it's a pejorative term. I am half Indian and my mother used to beat me up and call me that P word all of the time. I've been called it by other racists as well,"

conspiracy,feu0jh4,t1_fetz259,1579381925.0,I never knew that. That's something for me to research. Yep there's so much more to this than meets the eye. I used to be part of the Madeleine McCann truth groups on Facebook and I remember a few times members stated that Gerry McCann worked at Celtic Football club and there was some abuse going on there as well. That must be the reason why so many high profile UK professionals stepped in to help the McCanns. It was also the only time the royal family got involved to help find a missing child. The case has had millions spent on it. Richard D Hall has some good videos about it on YouTube and a statement analysis.

I asked my endocrinologist for some but they won't give me any. They say the only use it for emergencies like thyroid storms which is rubbish. I will look into magnesium. I know I'm deficient in that anyway due to using proton pump inhibitors.
conspiracy,feq07zv,t1_fep3dh6,1579335455.0,That makes sense. Older people always say to me how alarmed they are now by the shelf life of bread or milk. I can still just about remember the milk that used to be delivered to the doorstep and it would last 3 days max. Now you have milk and bread that lasts well over a week. Just what sort of preservatives are they using to achieve that and what does it do to our bodies? The fruit we get over here in England tastes like crap. Nothing like the fruit I've eaten in other European countries. I try to keep junk food to a minimum but almost every food product nowadays is bad for your health.

She was really nice but one day when she made a racist statement about black people, I called her out on it but she said to me that I wasn't black.

The council wouldn't help me, even though my mother wrote them a letter to say she had kicked me out. I couldn't even get a hostel. Eventually a work colleague took pity on me and let me stay with her. Not before I ended up hospitalised with a serious autoimmune disease and blind in one eye! This was in 2003. It's appalling."
