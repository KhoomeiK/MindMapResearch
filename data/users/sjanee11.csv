Other people were saying they received off the wall things like dish towels, so I guess I should be glad I got pens even if they were counterfeit! I've never been to NYC even though I lived in nY for 7 yrs but a storefront?!? omg."
bulletjournal,fgjaacz,t3_eyrwn1,1580840080.0,Cuteeee!! I have all of these but that second one. Mujis are my faves but I got swindled last time i ordered on Amazon so I'm trying to find a good replacement. I adore the Supertips. Edit: ugh if I could type correctly that would be great
