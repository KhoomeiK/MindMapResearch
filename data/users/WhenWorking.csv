Humans just can't compete with that speed of calculation. The AI's ""strategy"" is just a history of low and high risk options. In DotA, they can take every situation and calculate it at the time, until they have taken enough low risk actions and avoided enough high risk actions that the balance of risk favours them. They *might* be planning far ahead, but I doubt it."

Computers are GREAT at math. It's their best skill. An AI can determine, in a moment, ""given the damage output of this hero (or these heroes), their abilities, and cooldowns, etc, can I (win/escape/sacrifice for another purpose) this fight?""

And their decisions, then, are always perfect. DotA doesn't *need* to plan as far ahead as chess players. They need to kill mobs, and plan the next play until such a point that they're too far ahead to lose in their perfectly calculated next attack.

Their reaction time can be slowed, but they will never be in a position where that matters cause they can calculate whether getting hit or not is a big deal at any given time, by any given ability. They could probably even factor in their reaction time to their decision making.

I doubt the AI is tactical genius, just mathematically superior. In chess, they are tactically superior."

As such, the best choice for a monthly budget (if you think you must purchase a house and don't want to rent, because renting is probably the best for someone struggling to pay bills) is to put a small down on a house and pay the monthly payments. Otherwise, you're paying rent *and* high savings to reach that 20% down, making your budget even tighter. The quicker you can transition your saving from ""saving for a down payment"" to ""saving for emergencies"", the better off you will be on a month to month basis. I am not arguing long term-aggregate gains. That's not the topic at hand. We are talking people who struggle month to month.

Or you can rent and be okay with the fact that you might not own (though I think people deserve to own houses where they work, and the current real estate climate in big cities is unhealthy and bad for society).

This isn't a crazy concept. Yes, sometimes over time X decision is worse in aggregate, but on a monthly or even yearly basis, that decision may provide a number of benefits that you can't exclude from your decision making."

These are both facts.

Your attempt at a strawman racist argument is funny, by the way. People (anyone) who commit violent crime should be isolated from general public until such a time that they are safe to be reintroduced. The current prison system does not allow for that to happen most of the time, and until it does allow that to happen release of violent offenders with a risk of re-offence back into the public is a risk to the safety of the public."

I think the prison system needs to be reformed completely. As it is right now, we have too many people locked up. As it is right now, mentally ill and dangerous people need to be locked up for life because there is a huge risk of them hurting someone else. This is because our current system doesn't do much to rehabilitate.

Now, as a tall guy myself - how much extra weight are you pulling up? Not only that, levers multiply force. So your long limbs, large body sticking out during cramped positions, etc, is adding a ton of force you need to work through.
