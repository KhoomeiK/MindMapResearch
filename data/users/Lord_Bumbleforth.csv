Those who prided themselves in the more raw, territorial style of graffiti (tags, etch, dubs, throwies etc.) disliked the emergence of people who painted arty stuff at legal walls, they were seen as tourists who liked to exploit the culture without being part of the culture because they weren't scurrying up drainpipes at 3AM with a bag full of stolen krylon to put their name in someone else's territory.

YouShouldKnow,ffwj7zx,t3_evgrt1,1580302788.0,"Engine lights do different things for different reasons, some blink as their basic setting, some will just light up whether you're overdue a service or whether you've just sent a piston into low orbit. A misfire can be caused by something as minor as a spark plug/lead failing or it could be something catastrophic like a stuck valve or a hole in the piston/block, your engine light won't tell you what's up so you've got to assess each situation on it's own merits, if it's something serious the engine will generally be making a lot of unexpected noise and probably some smoke.   


The two lights you should really be looking out for are water temperature and oil level, if either of these come on then you should either stop at the next safe opportunity (if you've got water/oil on board), head to the nearest place you can buy coolant/oil (within a few miles) or pull over and call for recovery. If you're severely overheating you'll kill the engine within a few miles, if you run out of oil (oil lights don't tend to function until you're basically empty) you'll kill the engine within a few minutes.
