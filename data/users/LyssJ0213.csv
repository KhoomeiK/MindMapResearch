But yeah, #genetics and such."

fatlogic,fdelp5g,t1_fd1ro1s,1578341674.0,Do you guys have to get weighed there too? Cause itâ€™s normal practice for us. But I feel it does make sense seeing that we are getting bigger and our normal size is now getting closer to being either overweight/obese or that itâ€™s already there. But also we do have to get weighed for their (the doctorâ€™s) knowledge as well as correct medicine dosage so that theyâ€™re not prescribing too much or too little.
