dankmemes,fe5jtiq,t1_fe5irj9,1578870369.0,interesting. apple is for sure an eco system. my father was an executive recruiter for apple back in the 80’s and we’ve just kept apple in the family even after the free stuff stopped coming in. I love the simplicity which seems to be a con according to android users because they like to be able to tinker with the device
dankmemes,fe58w06,t1_fe51jys,1578866628.0,"To each their own. i didn’t get a phone until 2012 and it was a hand-me-down iphone 3GS. i’ve just never had anything different as i’ve continued to upgrade through Apple/At&t and have no problems with the “restrictive” IOS layout. It’s become so embedded into my mind to the point where a new phone feels the same as an old, just faster each time."

PrequelMemes,fcp3x0l,t1_fcolcff,1577849695.0,"He’s too passionate about star wars tho. the reason so many great directors turned down the prequels was because they viewed it as George’s creation only. He sucks at writing dialogue, but he knows his universe better than anyone, and lucasfilms needs a “kevin fiege” over looker who understands the lore and continuity"
