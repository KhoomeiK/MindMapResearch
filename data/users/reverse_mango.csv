While the noblemen don’t abuse Caliban, Prospero is part of the noblemen at the end and the King’s servants, Trinculo and Stephano, definitely abuse him.

It’s a tenuous link, but I found it interesting because The Aeneid would’ve been literature that interested Shakespeare, especially with its comedic undertones of insulting the protagonist who’s meant to be Caesar Augustus.

I think Shakespeare thought of it to put in his play as a reference because he thought it fit (and maybe he had writer’s block because he wasn’t known for being completely original)."
