Impeachment,ffhq1bx,t1_fffv9t5,1579947801.0,"It's simple. The Republicans deny that everything the President *has been proved to do* is not impeachable or criminal. The idea is to present far more damning evidence for the court of the American public. Though it's unlikely for the Senate Republicans to change their tune, it would add pressure to acknowledge the illegal and damaging (to national security and to constitutional law) actions of POTUS. But mostly so that voters can be informed, since this *is* a trial, which is meaningless without the full scope of the ***relevant*** facts."

Meditation,feuketl,t3_eqkk9q,1579387341.0,"You should know that Astral Projection is just an (incorrect) interpretation of your perception. Out of body experiences can be induced by meditation, but that doesn't mean there's a special ethereal world out there. I think it's great that you're interested in cultivating the ability to cause a voluntary OBE, but I would caution you to stay realistic, especially when we know what happens in the brain during such an experience.

Edit: just to provide reasons to stay realistic: one, people will absolutely not respect you if you openly believe you are able to transcend your body. two, holding beliefs like this opens your mind up to some pretty weird beliefs, especially if you take your hallucinations as reality and it affects your behavior IRL.
