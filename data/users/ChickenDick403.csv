nature,ff7u8jr,t1_ff7s11e,1579658491.0,No it's really true. These hunting contests have no long term effects on the populations. They recover extremely quickly via the aforementioned mechanisms. The issue is that this practice is needlessly cruel and has literally no effect. Its killing for the sake of killing which is morally reprehensible.

Without her financial help I would still be completely destitute with little hope of getting ahead. With the little bit of slack I have as a result of our combined financial status, I'm back in school now for wildlife conservation and management, because if I'm going to work really hard and not get paid well at something, it might as well be something I care deeply about."

TwoXChromosomes,feefzye,t3_eoip7f,1579032986.0,"I've volunteered and worked at a few scientific institutions throughout my life and I have found in my experience that most people don't pay any attention to how anyone else dresses, including women. There were more than a few very attractive well dressed women and and many who did hard serious fieldwork often and looked the part. I never once heard anyone comment on them in condescending ways. I've mostly worked in wildlife and zoological sciences so maybe it's less rampant there? Or maybe I've just been lucky to not work with a bunch of assholes. This is not to delegitimize or dismiss or experience or to say it isnt a widespread problem, just that there are places out there where you can just be a smart capable scientist and that will be enough."
