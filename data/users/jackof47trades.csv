exmormon,fft9fyo,t1_ffstix3,1580213304.0,"I appreciate you valuing translation skills. Refreshing to hear. I’m actually a BYU Translation major.

Church translators are paid significantly more than market rates. There’s no good explanation other than their understanding of LDS doctrine and tone, and their willingness to work in the “correlated” system. But it’s many times more per word. It’s not right that they’re sucking up so much tithing money. Especially since I bet volunteers would do it, including bright local people in each area.

Also: what’s different about the people to hang lights or keep flowers fresh? They deserve pay too.

My overall point is that the church pays fair market rates (or higher) for needed services. Honorable workers provide those services for a price plus excellent benefits.

So why did janitorial services not meet that standard? Why did the leadership decide to ask members to do it for free?

Probably just because they could! People have begrudgingly accepted it."
