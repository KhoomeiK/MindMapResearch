And yeah she is a boomer... and she behaves like one"
dogs,ffbnwhq,t1_ffbnrwk,1579774860.0,"Yeah we will from now on only take rescues. The thing is that we are first time dog owners and fell in love the breed and just wanted the full ""puppy samoyed experience"" one. But never again^^"
dogs,ffbnmmg,t1_ffbnkas,1579774443.0,"Yeah that's exactly how ours is. Especially the part where they feel SO amazing. And of course they claim to know everything about dog training (even though they talk a lot of bullshit) 
It's a shame."

dogs,ff8watq,t1_ff8w0hc,1579698216.0,Here in my country its forbidden because its screwing over the dog for ridiculous beauty standards. If you were behaving properly you should have a) wished for her not to be cropped or b) adopt one from a shelter or c) take a different damn breed. You choose not to. You behaved unethical. Done
dogs,ff8rld6,t3_esa0xt,1579693286.0,"You took him to cropping
You are a shitty person. Leave their fckng ears alone"

relationship_advice,ff6c46d,t3_erwm6y,1579623955.0,"I respect you for it. Some girls been to scared at a certain point to still push for a no if a guy kept being persistent. This is not consensual ... it's just her giving up and can leave trauma. 
I'm glad you respect boundaries"
relationship_advice,ff6bt55,t1_ff6bav4,1579623760.0,Means you will no longer tolerate it? In that case- good job. Find someone that respects you- because your culture is a part of you
samoyeds,ff6bi72,t3_erwckc,1579623564.0,Aw what a good boi/girl. Where did you get those cute pineapple things? <3

samoyeds,ff6astk,t3_erw1sk,1579623116.0,He looks like he got his fur shaven off- everything okay with him?
dankmemes,ff64s9e,t3_erux6g,1579619120.0,Have the same. That bitch of a mother always plays the victim card. Says she sacrificed herself for us... like getting nailed and then making the children feel guilty for existing and screaming at them is sacrificing anything...
relationship_advice,ff64btd,t1_ff60c3d,1579618797.0,"Dont blame it on the autism. I'd say he is just scum. I'm autistic, so are a few people I know. They all know not to make comments like that because they are trying to ""fit in""."

Dont date him. Break up. That's not how Americans or any other people are of a certain culture are like- it's what pieces of shit that have no respect are like"
dogs,ff6406m,t1_ff63js0,1579618568.0,"Because you made him addicted to it. Put some yoghurt on his dry food. Even if he doesnt it for a day, sooner or later he will. You made him this way."

Dogtraining,ff5ah9l,t3_erpakk,1579585219.0,"It does not seem like the dog it the problem here. A child and a dog should never be unsupervised. Children often dont understand boundaries. It seems like the dog was clearly communicating that he feels trapped and uncomfortable and the things were kept up anyway.

Letting children spank the dog is even worse. No one should do this because that's not how you communicate to a dog- it's how you make the dog mistrust you. And worst case it wasnt even the first time that happened.

Depending on where you live it would be more ethical to bring the dog to a shelter (here in Germany no dogs are put down and they are really good).

But then please dont get another dog. The ""aggressive"" behaviour comes from fear and a lack of socialisation. The last thing that is needed is you dumping your old dog only to get a new one that your children can overstep boundaries with"

You're your own person"
relationship_advice,fewptnr,t3_eqsua9,1579417688.0,"So she also beliefs that evolution is not real, the earth is 6000 years old, that Noah's flood happended, that you should not do anything outside of marriage, that gays are disgusting and should be killed and all of the other things...?
Ooof. Dude. I can only tell you to dumb her. If you want you can first read up on the topic, maybe even show her evidence but in my experience those people never change. 
I couldn't be with someone that ... well... stupid."
relationship_advice,fepxw87,t1_fepdfsv,1579334402.0,"Way easier. I completely cut her out of my life. No messages, nothing. It's still incredibly hart sometimes because I miss my younger siblings that still live there- but I saw that my mental health is really good without her. And everytime I came into contact with her in the last year it dipped completely to the point that I had crying breakdowns. 
I'm so glad I dont have her in my live anymore"

dogs,fe9bm5i,t3_eo5tdp,1578936087.0,"Same with my parents. Its painfull to watch people get a dog when they are absolutely unfit to have one. But nothing can be done about it. I hate that so much. I feel helpless everytime because at the end of the day it's the dogs that suffer. 
Wish there was some way to prevent people like that from getting dogs... they shouldn't even get a plant"
relationship_advice,fe6ptq2,t3_eo0kj0,1578899796.0,Call the police. This is not okay. You have to completely ill and unstable to shoot a dog

dankmemes,fdqvgvu,t3_ems61y,1578675478.0,"Gonna loose my karma for this- but the series is not good. Ciri her story line is pure garbage, a lot of the interactions are forced in the show. The sorcerers are incredibly weak and plot holes are everywhere. Why the hell do they row in a boat? Why are all of those mages so weak that they can barely kill anyone? Yenn is doable but constantly is on the edge of crying which is not what she is like at all. 
Disappointing."

I'm so glad he did honestly. Not only was it a terrible relationship but despite that...
I know he wouldn't have stopped seeing it like that. He brought up the same arguments.
I would just leave if I was you, but it's your own choice that depends on how good the relationship is otherwise I guess"
