chairsunderwater,feyc9yf,t1_fexuuzj,1579443655.0,Mm yes

AmItheAsshole,femt130,t3_epz3sy,1579268778.0,Definitely NTA I do this a lot and ya do feel bad but it's your money you're spending at the end of the day!
AmItheAsshole,femsafu,t3_epzcgs,1579268174.0,"YTA your girlfriend definitely doesn't owe Kyle anything after what he did. Kyle may have changed, sure but that doesn't mean your girlfriend should just hand over her cash and be best buds. If you wanna pay for his surgery, you do that shit yourself."
bulletjournal,fe4zyqy,t1_fe4pr5o,1578864381.0,"Ooh okay, I'll keep that in mind :)"
bulletjournal,fe4n1vl,t1_fe3e7sp,1578860982.0,"No idea, I guess I'll find out!"
bulletjournal,fe4my3q,t1_fe3rtxw,1578860943.0,"I think this is one of the earlier models so since this has come out there have been more advances in quality, sometimes they come out a little streaky and if the photo isn't in good quality it's gonna turn out a bit blurry (obviously). I'm not picky about the quality because it's just really for my journal because I can't be bothered to manually print everything on my shitty printer.
 I was pleasantly surprised when I got this, it prints out glossy which gives it a professional edge which I like. So I do recommend looking into this or other brand variations of instant printers!"
bulletjournal,fe2lzys,t3_ennd9j,1578840292.0,"If you have access to your phone or device, I've heard of a few people having their journals online so then it's always accessible and reasonably easy to add to? Though I know some find this takes out some of the satisfaction of a physical copy but this could be a possible idea?"

bulletjournal,fd0pxp2,t1_fd0kujk,1578122176.0,"Alrighty, I'll make sure to have a look into it and keep it in mind. I've greatly enjoyed Let's Go so far and I felt it was a good introductory game for me. Just something a bit light and fun, ya know."
bulletjournal,fd0iueu,t1_fd0crnt,1578119430.0,Not too many at the moment as I've only just gotten mine around Christmas time. Mainly just Sword and Let's Go Eevee but I have Minecraft too and really wanna play Untitled Goose Game when I get around to buying it. Do you have any recommendations?

bulletjournal,fczh6uj,t1_fcy8hby,1578101173.0,"Scorbunny, but I am also pretty fond of Sobble so when I get the chance I'm going to trade and get one from my bf lol. Which starter do you prefer?"

bulletjournal,fcvji6b,t1_fcud1kk,1578003421.0,"These ones are the highlighters, I do have some of the brush pens and really the only difference (besides lacking in some of the colour options) is that there's a brush tip instead of a highlighter head (so is better for calligraphy and such). I don't have any of the other markers at the moment but I believe it's just a marker at both ends, and one is finer for writing or detailed colouring and the other is larger? I do really recommend the Mildliners though, I've been super happy with them."
AskReddit,fcteaa5,t3_eio3qj,1577940506.0,The irony
