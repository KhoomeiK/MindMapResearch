fatlogic,ff6ldos,t3_erw5oj,1579629673.0,Grotesque.
fatlogic,ff37cab,t3_erdmq7,1579535420.0,"I want to slap that person. These people are delusional. A morbidly obese person volunteering to lose weight, and subsequently being put on a diet by their doctor is akin to Nazi death camp experiments?!?"
fatlogic,ff0f5ot,t3_eqyanm,1579468272.0,"Literally no doctor will refuse an emergent surgery on a patient because of their weight. However doctors will refuse non emergent surgeries on obese people because adipose tissue is poorly perfused. This means that fat people have a longer healing and recovery time, which increases risks of infection, dehiscence, and such. Also, obese people are at a significantly higher risk of hypoxia during surgery. Doctors are refusing to treat you *because* they don’t want you to die, not because they’re a bunch of meanies who hate fatties. Ragen is nothing but an imbecil spreading fear and lies to her followers."

unpopularopinion,fe5xnqu,t3_ent3cw,1578877238.0,Why do you assume the only situation is which congratulations are in order is when some accomplished something? Congratulations can simply mean “I’m happy for you on this upcoming change to your life.
fatlogic,fe5vuv4,t3_ensyu8,1578876097.0,"They say “fatphobia” like it’s a bad thing. Yes, I am fearful of getting so large my health, ability to participate in athletic activities, ability to do basic tasks such as wipe my own ass, etc... suffers."
fatlogic,fe5vhfh,t3_enpljp,1578875860.0,"I’m a nurse. You’d be surprised how many people have zero qualms with not being able to wipe their own ass. Their was that story about the creepy fat guy who made a flight attendant wipe his ass and how traumatized she was by it. I’m like “damn, that’s just 10 minutes into the average shift for me."
conspiracy,fe0518e,t1_fe03ttm,1578803242.0,Of course they are. This is an invocation. I’ll pray instead.
fatlogic,fd3j0sn,t1_fd38xqj,1578158791.0,Exactly. You can apply this same logic to other addictions: self care is listening to your body when it says “another beer or glass of wine.” Don’t deprive yourself! Feel like you need a drink after being emotionally exhausted? That fifth of vodka is a coping skill showing you how resilient you are!
fatlogic,fcuqsjd,t3_eizw2r,1577986618.0,"These people can’t fathom that there are people who actually enjoy exercise and who socialize through it, too. I’ve met most of my adulthood friends through running clubs and the gym."

entertainment,fct3ud8,t3_eijkxf,1577932175.0,"Just a reminder that Epstein and Spacey are connected, and they are not just two bad apples. This goes super deep."

fatlogic,fcbu84r,t3_egxihb,1577591030.0,"That’s not how anorexia works. Anorexia nervosa is an extreme fear of gaining weight to the point that one’s body weight drops below normal parameters, and the person still isn’t satisfied. This results in severe side effects such as infertility.

The fact of the matter is that the biggest eating disorder facing the Western world is overeating to the point your render yourself obese."
conspiracy,fcayp0t,t3_egtomq,1577579241.0,"In the age of drones, why are so many of you like “omg it’s aliens!” Seriously?"
conspiracy,fcay9e7,t1_fcav0c5,1577578992.0,"Yes, aid the human traffickers and pedophiles by giving them money. Those taxes aren’t going where you think they’re going. Of course pro-life people want children in foster care to be adequately cared for. But the liars get people like you by making you think the only way to take care of foster children is to raise taxes. We don’t have an issue with lack of revenue, we have an issue with how our politicians spend it."
conspiracy,fcaxgao,t1_fcaihir,1577578537.0,"I’m a nurse and in the spring of 2017 our electronic medical records started including the patient’s preferred pronoun in the demographic information. In almost three years we’ve had one patient who identified themselves as something other than their biological sex, which was a woman wanting to be called “he/him.” She was put on my unit because she was faking seizures but before we could call her out on it and ship her out, a full work up had to be done. At one point she set off her bed alarm. I came running into her room and found her in the bathroom, nude, bleeding from where she ripped out her IV, and smearing shit all over the walls. Once we got her cleaned up and back to bed (she was wailing and kicking the whole time), she calmly picks up her phone and calls her bank to discuss a question she had about her account."
conspiracy,fbyru0r,t1_fbyo7pn,1577224639.0,"A few years ago our $1800 rent came out of our account the day before Thanksgiving when it wasn’t due until December 1, which was the day we got paid. This caused our account to overdraft, in addition to anything else we bought that day such as gas, groceries, lunch, coffee, another bill than came out, and a few things that had been purchased the days before but hadn’t been taken out of our account yet. We had like $800 in checking at the time. 

Here’s the bigger issue, though: we had over $5000 in savings at the time, however (and I didn’t know this at the time) there are federal laws that dictate how many times you can move money from you checking to your savings, and vice versa, every year. I had been moving money from our checking to our savings every paycheck, and moving even more when we spent less from checking than we anticipated, and a couple times from savings back to checking. 

If your checking became overdrawn but you had money in savings, they would transfer for you but for a fee of $10 each time. So we got hit with a few of those. Then I guess we exceeded the yearly limit during this time and they started hitting us with overdraft fees and not drawing out of savings. We ended up with almost $400 in overdraft fees. I noticed this during Thanksgiving but wasn’t able to contact anyone about it until they opened again the next day Luckily we explained the situation to the bank and they agreed to take off half the fees, but we still ended up out about $200.

The moral of the story is: these are predatory “gotchas.” Not everyone who overdrafts does so because they’re idiots who frivolously overspend what they don’t have."
