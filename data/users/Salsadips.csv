247 hours is almost 350 clears assuming youre not using more than 45 mins for a clear. Even if we assume youre really bad at the game or have really bad teammates and take hour per run, thats still 247 clears.

Scourge has been out for 1 year and 1 month, so thats what, 56 weekly resets or 168 loot chances, give or take a few. And this is assume you do it every week on all 3 characters from week 1.

So either, youre lying, you play scourge without getting loot a LOT, you are just afking or each run has taken you on average 1 and a half hours, which is just under 3 times as long as most peoples average clear time. 

Either way, youre being disingenuous at best or straight up lying at worst. Nobody has done 247 hours specifically for trying to get the sparrow because its not possible to have spent that much time in the raid without a good chunk of it being lootless runs.
