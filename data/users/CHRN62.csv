lookatmydog,ffav1zv,t3_esjete,1579745157.0,My rescue puppy looks exactly like your brown and white dog in the front.    What is the breed of your dog?  I was thinking my dog is a German shepherd/beagle mix.

KardashianFam,fep6kab,t3_eq9yac,1579313270.0,She looks like a defective mannequin.
dogs,fen3fb2,t3_epza1e,1579276107.0,"I am so sorry for your loss. When you feel up to it, maybe you can write a letter to Lucy, talking about what you loved about her, memories- happy and sad of the times you treasured, things you never said or did not get the chance to.  If you had Lucy cremated,  there are many types af containers, necklaces,  key chains that will hold a tiny bit of her ashes,  so she will always be with you.  I know nothing helps at this point, but know that you were the center of Lucy's world and she loved you dearly."

dogs,fehabjp,t3_ep4mf4,1579112437.0,"My puppy had it done at 4 months when she went to be spayed.  The eye was swollen for a couple of weeks but gradually got better. I had to keep her collar on for about 2 weeks bc she kept trying to get to the suture line on her belly and it opened a little because she would not calm down.  She did get meds for 3 days for pain, and was okay after that.  She also wanted to rub her eye and the collar helped with that. Good luck!"
KardashianFam,fef0r8y,t3_eorsde,1579045476.0,She is a behemoth .

dogs,fdlsrnj,t3_em0198,1578531625.0,"I have a 12 year old Cockapoo who is blind since age 6. While I am at work and my daughter is in school,  she is able to get around the apartment pretty well. I do close bedroom and bathroom doors and make sure there are no obstacles on the floor. She is able to jump on the couch and get off safely. We do have a one year old shepherd mix, but she is crated when we leave. Hope this helps."
lookatmydog,fd3nieb,t3_ejyjls,1578160001.0,He does look so sweet. My thoughts are with you.
dogs,fd2x6mf,t3_ejx1v2,1578152534.0,"This will be an unpopular opinion, but people should stop trying to assert their beliefs on others; e g. mill vs. rescue dogs and shaming dog owners who acquired a mill dog as a pet. Trust me, I know the horrible conditions that mill dogs live under, I am not condoning their existence,  purpose or methodology.   

That is the dog owner's choice and if they are not disclosing where they got their dog, then leave it. If people cannot be supportive, fine, but I wish people would put their condemnation on hold.

I have had 2 mill dogs, Cockapoos,  who have been with me for 11 and 12 years. I also have a rescue, who came to me after one of my Cockapoos died. My next dog may be a Corgi or a blended breed or a rescue and I will do my research to identify the best source from which to obtain my dog."

90dayfianceuncensored,fcqtjt2,t1_fcozbbp,1577891982.0,"Does anyone remember when she first came on the show with dark hair, minimal eyebrows and a very pasty doughy face? That look was bad, but this tops it. I wonder if she had another set of veneers applied?"

Of course, she got her drink and a kiss, but, for once I wanted to read the recap, uninterrupted! Oh, well, there is always next week.   Thank you and Happy New Year."

dogs,fc980c5,t3_egrqbb,1577548496.0,"I was in the same situation as you, my 6 year old Cockapoo had cataracts and I could not afford the surgery. My dog was on eye drops for a couple of years and then developed glaucoma and was totally blind. To relieve her discomfort,  I had her eyes removed. She is 12 now, slowing down a bit, but leads a happy life with me. We have moved a couple of times since then and she has adjusted well, each time. I have learned to be conscious of what her vulnerabilities are and make sure to minimize them as much as possible.  There was never any discussion by the Specialist veterinarians to put her down.  

I hope this helps and all the best to you and your dog."

Dogtraining,fc96579,t3_egrkjb,1577547646.0,"I have had 2 cockapoos.  My older one, Lexie, is 12, I purchased her at a pet store so background information was not available.  All I know is that she was from Missouri. I got her at 4 months old, and she has been the sweetest little dog all these years. When she was about 4, she developed cataracts which then progressed into Glaucoma,  so, long story short,  both eyes were removed as she was already blind and in some discomfort from the glaucoma. She does well moving around,  and we have moved a few times and she has adjusted easily.  

When Lexie was 11 months old, I purchased another Cockapoo,  Penny, from a pet store.  She was 6 months old at the time.   Penny and Lexie got along from the get go, so that made it easy. She was also a sweet little dog, no real behavior issues.  Penny developed congestive heart failure and pulmonary hypertension when she was about 10.  She became very ill a year ago and died in January, 2019. 

Needless to say, I was devastated and still miss her and her sweet little face. We have since adopted a rescue shepard mix. 

I will say Lexie and Penny are/ were affectionate,  well behaved, and fun to be with. I would have no hesitation to have another Cockapoo in my life again. Hope this helps."

She has diminished has swagger, which could happen to anyone in unfamiliar territory,  but her egocentric and callous disregard for him is really abominable."
dogs,fbxklvl,t3_eexn7o,1577191834.0,"I adopted what I think is a GSD/Beagle mix in February.  She was about 3 months old. She has been very reactive to people in our apartment,  barks loudly and incessantly. Even for people that come every week, i.e. my daughter's therapist.  She has never been aggressive but is agitated and jumpy.  And, the barking just goes on and on. What works best for us is putting her in her crate and closing the door on the crate, before anyone enters the apartment.  While the visitor is present, she is there with us and can see that no one is being harmed and soon she lays down and stops barking. I have started to give her a treat in the crate so that she can associate a visitor with something positive."
