MMA,fewmuux,t1_fewjg80,1579415078.0,Yes he fell on the ground. That's what you're asking right?
MMA,fewm1zr,t1_fewjj0f,1579414209.0,"Nope, you just know nothing about fighting"
MMA,fewkrjn,t1_fewjrtx,1579412911.0,A lot of people in here are. Obvious they know almost nothing about how fights work

worldnews,fdbdz2g,t1_fd8cj43,1578256476.0,"Obviously all Muslims are not terrorists and the vast majority of Muslims do not condone their behavior. I'm just saying that I believe at least some people in ISIS genuinely believe they are correctly practicing Islam. Every religion has factions and they all believe they're the correct ones. But If you're saying that ISIS leaders are not sincere in their practice and are only using Islam to manipulate people toward selfish ends, then I understand that might be the case."
worldnews,fdbbsvp,t1_fd98doi,1578255850.0,"If they believed it is the duty of Catholics(""true Christians"") to kill protestants(""false christians"") and that belief is derived from their religious doctrines, then it's not ridiculous. I'm guessing IRA didn't justify their killings with Catholic doctrines though (feel free to correct me). ISIS on the other hand explicitly claims their ideology is the true interpretation of Islam, even if the majority of muslims disagree."
worldnews,fd8c64w,t1_fd875sz,1578216674.0,"Are you claiming that they don't do what they do in service of their interpretation of Islam? Do you think they don't read the Quran? I don't know for sure but I'm betting their leaders are quite well-versed, even if they have a different interpretation than you."
GetMotivated,fc0nh6f,t1_fc025g5,1577295236.0,"Surprisingly they used the correct ""you're"""
AskReddit,fbzaf00,t1_fbz1y2i,1577240172.0,"Serious question, what constitutes ""depth"" in TLJ? (Btw I'm not claiming any of the other movies were deep)"
