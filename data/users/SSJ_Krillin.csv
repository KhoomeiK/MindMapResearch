news,fdivkaj,t1_fdirhx8,1578452010.0,You wouldn’t be able to recognize Reddit liberal bias and censorship if it hit you in the face.
news,fdiomis,t3_elig90,1578447567.0,Fake news and narratives everywhere in r/worldnews subreddit. Typical.
BlackPeopleTwitter,fd7hs5s,t3_ek0r96,1578204729.0,"Did he forget about the middle class? I had a handful of friends who also joined the military voluntarily. The draft does not discriminate based on socioeconomic class.

Reddit hivemind is trash."
facepalm,fc6rome,t1_fc6eor2,1577487759.0,"No ones being ignorant. No ones denying he says stupid stuff. But check the results. Speaks for itself but every outlets seems to 100% negative no matter what he does. That’s the difference. Why else does one side think we have the most retarded President ever when in reality it’s the opposite.

This is a straight hit piece article and title. Pure speculation."
facepalm,fc531xt,t3_efw8c7,1577440560.0,Bet you the person close to the President probably isn't even close to the President to say he has no one close to him.
facepalm,fc52tcz,t1_fc40mse,1577440201.0,Solid glimpse through biased media news outlets that are notorious for hating him? I don't see any misinformation there.
nba,fc52m6o,t3_efvj0s,1577439896.0,"Regardless of what Pierce said. Clippers are going to take a Series 7 against the Lakers, that's for sure."
UpliftingNews,fc0n11g,t3_efbctb,1577294930.0,"That’s the most retarded chart I’ve seen. Look at it more and tell me what’s wrong with it. You can pick that apart and see that Y15 -Y16 we were deep into negative growth and Trump saved our asses from a recession 2.0 within 8 years. Thanks to that Obama temporary spending package it went to 5% but guess what happens when you’re out money? Oh, that’s right. That’s like putting a bandage on a knife wound. Trumps economic policies are permanent which will cause sustainable growth. 

You’re so disconnected from reality. It’s sad. I’m pulling for you."
