Personally, I've found that weed is useful if I'm using it as an aid for sleep and not as a crutch. What this means is that I'm using it to just help correct when I'm going to bed, and then on nights when I feel tired around when I've set my bedtime as I go to sleep without it.

worldnews,ff4hq5t,t1_ff4ddg0,1579563895.0,"It was a simplification. Maybe I should have said ""using Reddit for your science news"".

Outside of a few sources, internet and just general news reporting on science topics is flat out wrong or misrepresentative of what's being reported on -- I'd say the news is actually the worst offender because they often extrapolate from a study and assert that extrapolation as what the scientists found.

One recent example I can think of was a study that made it to the top of /r/science that showed a correlation between cannabis use in adolescents and increased risk of attempted suicide in adulthood. The article and many of the comments seemed to suggest that this could mean that cannabis causes people to be suicidal later in life. Some other commenters claimed that these findings confirm that adolescents who use cannabis do so because they are suicidal in the first place.

These appear to be reasonable jumps to make, but they aren't very scientific. They're hasty and they aren't based on what the researchers found or concluded (i.e. simply that there was a link and that more research would be mecessary to determine why).

It's the same problem that I tried to lightly touch on in my original comment. People want to see the latest developments in science, so they look at the news, but then they get frustrated because all they see is research that will take decades to see real results from. They want results now. They want something they can relate to and draw a conclusion from, and science that's ""in the works"" usually doesn't work that way.

I'm leaving this up to mark my shame, but /u/fat_manAITA I apologize for speaking so soon. I really should have asked you about your height before going on what amounts to such a pointless tirade now that I know you're so fricken tall!

**End of edit. Original comment:**

What I'm saying is that if I was your wife then I would be very concerned for you.

Heart disease is the leading cause of death in your age group and at this point in time you'd probably be considered at high risk for heart disease, heart attack, or stroke because you are 50 and you are currently overweight -- don't believe me? Ask your doctor explicitly.

To put the weight you have gained into perspective: 50 lbs is the weight of an average to lanky husky. At 225 lbs you are also considered to be overweight for any height, obese for any height under 6'3"", or severely obese for any height under 5'3"".

Over the past two years I can also just about guarantee that you have put on a lot more than 50 pounds of *fat*. Why I can guarantee that is because after two years of not exercising you have probably lost much of the original muscle mass you would have accrued from exercising, so the difference *has* to be made up by fat for you to gain weight. I can also say that chances are your muscles have atrophied a lot more than you realize because of your age; when you're older it's harder to keep muscle on even when you try to.

Due to the huge difference in density between muscle and fat, this is also why you say you look like the ""fat one of the family"" -- you've lost a lot of muscle. This also has the ""fun"" side effect where your weight gain could increase in the coming years (if it hasn't already) at your current caloric intake because you aren't losing weight in muscle anymore.

Now let's look at this from your wife's point of view. For the past two years you've totally put off exercising, you've totally put off healthy eating, and you've gained a husky's worth of weight. Now you're telling her ""I'll get down to 180-200"" after you haven't done anything for the past two years that can make her believe that (i.e. watching what you eat, exercising) -- and frankly 180-200 might still be considered overweight or obese depending on your height.

Then there's the plan you have to lose the weight that raises more red flags, but if your wife is vying for exercise and not diet control she's actually doing you a disservice there. In the context of weight loss, your caloric intake is almost the entire battle -- not exercise. Very few exercises can make up for an excess in calories, and the few exceptions that burn tonnes of calories like running don't sound like they'd interest you. Even if you were interested, you factually *would not* be able to do them long enough to reap the benefits of the exercise after two years of not exercising, at 50, at 225 pounds, without injuring yourself.

I'm not saying that to be a dick, but seriously if you think this has any semblance of healthiness then you need to see your doctor. 50 lbs over two years isn't healthy, 50+ lbs of fat is especially unhealthy -- and it is almost entirely from your eating habits and not your lack of exercise, even though exercise is also important."

I can't blame your wife of being skeptical of you when you say you're not going to just keep gaining weight when that's all you've done for the past year.

Besides that, if you're willing to ""stay in shape between 200-180"" then staying in shape at 170 is going to be identical to that once you get the weight off. Your metabolism doesn't drastically change between 200-170.

I live in Ottawa, Canada.. so actually I live in what is perhaps one of the safest cities in the world. The point is that despite that I *still* encounter a lot of crazies, so if you live elsewhere I imagine you're even worse off engaging every rando who comes up to you. e.g. If you live in a big city and if even 1/100 people who approach you are nuts, then if you engage with everyone who solicits you there is a non-negligible risk you'll engage with somebody who can really hurt you. This risk scales up quickly for bigger cities; on a visit to NYC me and my family were easily engaged with by over a hundred soclitors in a week. I'd say more, but I don't want to exaggerate.

>I agree you don't know someone's intent. And from a safety perspective it would make sense if you paid at least enough attention to know what the person around you was up to instead of pretending he wasn't there.

I felt forced to engage with him at the time. I was waiting for a bus and couldn't go anywhere where I was situated. I can also confidently say that for 99% of people I encounter who solicit me, if I ignore them they will go look for somebody else or they'll lose interest.

1. On one hand, this is like.. super mundane. I understand you have social anxiety, but (I'm saying this as somebody else who has pretty bad social anxiety) that's your problem to bear. This could have been solved with a ""no thanks"" or a ""not interested"".
2. On the other hand, nobody is really *owed* your attention. Live in any moderate sized city and there will be people you ignore: panhandlers, aggressive panhandlers, salespeople, people who pretend not to be salespeople, dumbasses on the bus, etc. -- and frankly that's fine. Might it be nicer to say ""no thanks""? I guess, but I also don't understand the expectation that you give your attention to randos.

Here's the rub. You're obviously not *obligated* to take in your SIL, but it doesn't sound like your SIL has any other options. It's been like a month tops since she's gotten out of this long term relationship and she doesn't have a steady source of income. Put yourself in her shoes and I guarantee you wouldn't know what to do either except to rely on family.

Am I saying you need to bend over? Absolutely not! But I do think it would be beneficial to sit down and talk to your SIL face to face about your concerns once more before kicking her out. There are a myriad of options here between ""live here rent free"" and ""get out of my house"", y'know?"

It just boggles my mind because there are so many anglo unis in Ontario, yet these people who care about whether English comes first or not choose this one. Did they not research the university they were applying to? Did they not see the glaring, BLARING signalling from uOttawa that this is a bilingual university? Like some dude that posted awhile ago saying that french profs are essentially ""affirmative action hires""; bruh, why's the assumption that French profs are automatically worse? I've had bad profs of many mother tongues and I've had great profs who speak their third language better than I can speak their first, but I've never assumed their teaching is a result of their first language.

I have a friend in one of the student associations on campus and she's told me that they even get drama over the emails they send out depending on whether English of French comes first -- and bless their hearts for their patience, because they're not even representatives of the university. 

If they send an email with French first, they get complaints because anglos don't want to scroll down or hit a button to change the email to French. If they send with English first, they get (fewer, it sounds like) emails that they aren't being inclusive. The result? We get abominations like what the student union sends out where they switch every paragraph.

The standard rate for a student card is 23%. I'd be much more worried if I was OP about bank fees, which would probably be like $100+ bucks a month. That means in a *best case* scenario OP would need to pay off 110-120 bucks just to say in the same hole, depending on whether his credit limit is $500 or $1000 (that's what my bank allowed me; I sure hope OP's bank didn't allow him more)."

I checked on Credit Karma and the best student credit card I could find has a 23% annual interest rate on cash advances (what I assume you took) and 20% rate for purchases.

If you maxed out, that means you're 500-1000 dollars in the hole right now. Applying monthly interest means 10-20 interest a month, and probably 100+ bucks in bank fees a month. Even if we assume $100 fees per month and that you just maxed out at $500, you need to pay at least $110 a month *just to keep yourself in the same hole*. Even if you qualified for a second credit card at 17% (the best rate I could find for paying down debt) you'd be at $107-$114 a month in fees. That is BAD, my person.
