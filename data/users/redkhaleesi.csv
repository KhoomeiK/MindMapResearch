Dogtraining,ff9zp4v,t3_dow88g,1579724939.0,"Hi, I‚Äôve just come across your post, I‚Äôm going through a similar thing with my Basset Hound and I‚Äôm wondering what you did with your puppy? Has it worked? My puppy is near 5 months, we have had him for 3 weeks and we can leave a room without him crying/barking/scratching. When we leave him he is the same, we have set up a camera to check up. I feel awful although he is in a safe area. I‚Äôve try all sorts but any advice would be greatly appreciated if possible"
