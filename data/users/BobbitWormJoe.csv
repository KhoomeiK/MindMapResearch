Copied from another response:

Most fruit juice is made by filtering out a lot of the good stuff from the fruit's flesh (like fiber and some of the vitamins). Which is why pulpy OJ (or any ""whole fruit"" juice) is slightly better from a nutritional perspective.

But the biggest problem with fruit juice (including pulpy/whole) is how easy it is to consume. Yes, one orange is slightly more calories than an orange's worth of juice. But, that is only about 1/3 cup, or 2.5 fl oz. Most people can (and do) easily drink far more than that. In a couple glasses you've now consumed 6 oranges, which comes with a couple hundred calories and far exceeded the AHA's recommended sugar intake (and no, it doesn't matter that it's ""natural"" sugar, it's still bad for you if you eat too much of it)."
