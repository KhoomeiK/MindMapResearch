dating,ffwt8x3,t1_ffwhcvb,1580310464.0,Thank you. Both women seemed fine with the fact that I lived so far away. Maybe it's a better idea to choose simpler first dates with less commitment. I think I have a lot of reflecting to do.
talesfromtechsupport,ffw3vcj,t1_ffux44i,1580283170.0,"I don't remember exactly how much I invoiced the customer for, but 15 years ago or so I drove a couple hundred miles on overtime to troubleshoot a brand new printer that was constantly jamming. The customer had loaded A4 paper instead of 8½x11. I'm not sure why they even had A4 paper, considering they were in Texas."
AskMen,ffw1nmv,t3_evay0q,1580280551.0,Do you return the favor?
dating,ffw0m1n,t1_ffvxq3i,1580279431.0,At this point I'm having a hard time justifying continuing. I can handle rejection if someone isn't interested or we're not compatible or whatever - but this is a different thing entirely and I don't know how to avoid it.
gaming,ffv4dv5,t1_ffv3xit,1580255400.0,Absolutely! Every time I thought I had those fucking xenomorphs figured out they figured me out too. I genuinely felt like I was being *hunted*. I could feel it in the pit of my stomach.

woodworking,ffstkqw,t1_ffsrxjk,1580191963.0,"Deadblows are good for reducing bounce if you're using a particular dense wood. It would replace a rubber mallet for joining, not a wooden mallet. Chiseling with deadblows is more difficult because they're less predictable."
woodworking,ffssqmg,t1_ffpbhs7,1580191091.0,"Like everything else, you get what you pay for. Their high end workstations are pretty nice. That said, you can almost always build a computer cheaper than buying one and OP gets the added bonus of teaching his son how to build a PC."
woodworking,ffsre29,t3_ev10ch,1580189757.0,"Wooden mallets are for driving tools, such as when carving or chiseling; they excel at transferring a lot of energy into a small point. Rubber mallets are for joining; they excel at evenly transferring energy into a broader area."
videos,ffryyua,t3_euu8z0,1580169123.0,"I looked up what the temperature was in Celsius, and as it turns out -35F and -35C are pretty much the same temperature. That's definitely not t-shirt weather."

AskReddit,ffr9xe7,t1_ffr1tbs,1580153641.0,Well I'll be damned. You must have moxie off the charts or something.

AskReddit,ffqx952,t3_euo3s4,1580145706.0,"I really don't think my motivation is to ""appear manly"", per se. With a few rare exceptions, any time I have shown any sort of anxiety, insecurity, sadness, loneliness, etc. around another person, they distance themselves from me. Keeping my emotions in check is a necessity of existence.

I desperately crave an outlet for my emotions. Lately, that has been Bojack Horseman, A Marriage Story, and Fleabag."
