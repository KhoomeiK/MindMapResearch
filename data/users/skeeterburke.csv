Bible,fe8rnt7,t3_eo3r4b,1578929829.0,"Yehoshua was born on the first day of Sukkot

The moedim (plural of moed) 
1 Pesach (passover)
2 Chag Ha Matzot (feast of unleavened bread)
3 Ha Bikkurim (first fruits)

4 Shavuot (feast of weeks, ""pentecost"")

5 Yom Teruah (day of trumpets)
6 Yom Kippur (day of atonement)
7 Sukkot (feast of tabernacles)

We all know December 25 has its roots in paganism (Mithra worship), and people use that day to celebrate the birth of our Messiah. So of course, other people are quick to point out that Yehovah says ""do not add to or take away from these commandments"" While I don't believe any Christian is trying to celebrate pagan deities on purpose, I think it's important that we understand and teach others about the symbolism of the moedim. Especially when it comes to skeptics and agnostics! Yehoshua fulfilled ALL FOUR of the spring moedim, not just Pesach 🌺🌺🌺 When the dead were seen walking around Jerusalem, that was part of Ha Bikkurim, Yeshua's first fruits offering to the Father 

There is so much rich symbolism in the moedim and in scripture in general. I'm sure we can all think of our favorite examples"

what's really fascinating is that Mary's genealogy goes all the way back to Adam. plenty of other reasons why scriptures say that Adam was the first man, and was our ancestor. Eve was the mother of all living

So, no need for millions of years to explain evolution, also no extraterrestrials to witness to. It's just us y'all

As far as the age of the earth, half lives of radioactive isotopes have been used to support an old earth, and then creationists say, well you have to make certain assumptions, then imo all they do is change the assumptions, eg how much starting material you had to begin with

However, if you get deeper into cosmology, there are plenty of reasons to dismiss the assumption that the earth must be really old. Dr. Russell Humphries and others make a good case for Biblically based cosmology

And then of course, it brings you back full circle, to accepting scripture as it is written. We were taught in middle school that there are different types of literature, there's fiction, history, poetry, etc, and we're expected to make reasonable assumptions about the intentions of the author. So if a story begins with ""once upon a time"", or it's an article written by The Babylon Bee or The Onion, you know it's not intended to be taken as historical fact. On the other hand, the account in Genesis of the creation is imo not intended by the author to be taken as allegory. Whether or not you believe it's true, that's another issue, but the author never intended it to be read as a ""Just-So"" story. Compare that with the epic of Gilgamesh etc"

Bible,fbxf1qp,t1_fbwwdwm,1577184012.0,"The lineage through Joseph is given in Matthew. Of course there's a count, I'm not sure what you mean, I guess

The writer of the book of Hebrews talks about Yeshua being from the line of Melchizedek very beautifully. In contrast with the line of Aaron 

Speaking of the Melek Zadik, the ""last supper"" was not the passover meal. Yehoshua is our spotless passover lamb. The ""last supper"" was the evening before, the 13th of the first month

🌺🌺🌺 I appreciate the patience everyone is having with each other on this subject. Seriously. Hard to find these days 🌺🌺🌺"
Bible,fbwpns3,t1_fbwo8uj,1577156108.0,"One of the reasons for rejecting Yeshua as the messiah, from what I understand, is they don't count 14 generations back to David, but 13 ... I am still learning, but I think it has something to do with ""husband"" and ""father"" being mistranslated. Because Mary's husband and her father were both named Yosef"
Bible,fbwp98z,t3_eesdkd,1577155811.0,"I just think it would behoove us all if we understood what we are all talking about when we say ""fulfill"" - everyone, me included (hey I'm no theologian!)

It reminds me of a george Carlin bit where he's making fun of figures of speech, the last one is ""in your own words"" ... ""hey! I'm using the same ones everyone else is using!"" ... funny bit. But I digress  ....

I just keep thinking, since Yeshua is our spotless lamb, and when he was crucified 2000 years ago, he ""fulfilled"" all 4 of the spring moedim, well then what about the fall moedim?

The 4 moedim I am referring to are Pesach (passover), the Feast of unleavened bread, First Fruits, and Shavuot (pentecost) 

Before the lambs were to be slaughtered, they were brought into the temple for the ""four days of inspection"" as instructed in Leviticus. The beginning of this was to be on the 10th day of the first month, which we now celebrate as palm sunday - the day that Yeshua rode into Jerusalem on a donkey 

So idk. We all have lots to figure out before Yeshua returns. I am grateful that my Creator is so very patient with me so I can continue to practice until Yeshua returns 🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺"
