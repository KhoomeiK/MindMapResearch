Christianity,fehgyxp,t1_feefbdi,1579116331.0,"The fact that we have the capability to sin is a flaw. It's like a car. It has a chance to crash or hurt somebody. That is a flaw. One that we accept but is still a flaw. If we were created perfectly, we would not have a flaw of being able to make sin. Free will in of itself is an invitation to sin. God made it that way. The very fact that free will itself exists is an open temptation to sin. So why would God tempt us to sin with free will?  

An all-knowing and all-powerful being that allows something else to come into existence from his creation is effectively creating the other thing. That's like a chemist who is trying to get a certain element from an experiment but also gets a byproduct in the end. It was always there in the creation itself. God created sin. He wasn't like ""oh no, what is this thing that I had no responsibility in making?""  If he didn't make it, is that admitting someone else has the power to create something God cannot?  That wouldn't make him an all-knowing or all-powerful being anymore. Saying he just chose not to wouldn't make sense either since that's what happened anyways when he created humans. He knew it would happen. He wasn't blindsided by any of it."

Christianity,fedor7b,t1_fe6jzsp,1579016604.0,"If everything he created was perfect, then perfect things would not have the flaw of being susceptible to sin.  

God had the free will to not have sin exist. But he brought it into existence by letting that even be a possibility to happen. That means an all knowing God who knew what he was doing, created sin."

Christianity,fe6g5d8,t1_fe4i0wx,1578889887.0,"So God made beings who could create sin. That's like a video game designer creating a character that can jump up and down. The concept would not have existed had the video game designer not made that action a possibility. Meaning the very concept was created in the mind of God. He also created angels with the ability to defy him and desire to become him. So he also created defiance and jealousy. If he created everything, that means everything. From universes, to dimensions, to thoughts, emotions, motivations... that means he also designed evil. Because something doesn't come from nothing. There was nothing before God.  Everything came from God."
todayilearned,fe52vfq,t1_fe4xir2,1578865170.0,"I think you're just picking a fight just to fight. 

My grandmother is one of many elderly who claim earlier generations are better than present generations these days. I did have a great grandparent who said similar things. My original comment did mention older generations in general. So this is all nit-picking at this point. 

I agree that it's ridiculous to believe older generations were supposedly better behaved and whatnot. I was making fun of it. So what are you getting after?"

I was literally bringing up a grievance about how older generations would deny such a thing because they considered older generations more civilized and well-behaved.

Christianity,fe3vszr,t1_fdsf9el,1578853316.0,"But he DID create a world which was evil and corrupted.  He is all-knowing, meaning he knows the outcomes of everything that will happen. He knew the world would be sinful. He created the very concept. To say an opposite just manifested itself from his decisions that he had nothing to do with, would suggest there is another power at work that created that opposite."

AskReddit,fchdb7i,t1_fce62mz,1577649459.0,"There's a difference though. That is a psychiatrist. If that's what they really said, they were definitely wrong and should have been penalized as a professional for denying that you were overweight. Now with saying that, that is completely irrelevant to the point being made right now. 

Nobody is saying to lie about your BMI not being considered overweight. The argument here is that overweight people can be beautiful in other people's eyes as well as their own. You dont have to lie about that. That is still true praise."
AskReddit,fcgq29l,t1_fcf7dov,1577642904.0,"Oh come on. Your opinion is not fact. That's just delusional to think everyone thinks the same way as you. There are definitely people who think 300 pound people are attractive. So what are you getting irritated over again?  The fact that someone doesn't share the same opinion as you?  That's essentially what it's coming down to. And the fact that someone telling someone else ""You're beautiful"" to someone you dont agree is beautiful... that's a ""you"" problem. Not them. They may genuinely think the woman/man is beautiful. 

What you believe is good for people is irrelevant and will never be true for everyone. So if you actually end up hurting someone's progress because of your tunnel-vision ideas on how things should be, would you actually care?  Do you consider that your negativity and shaming might actually hurt people more than do good?  Are you actually that emotionally invested in someone's health?  Or do you just revel in being angry that overweight people are being called beautiful and you'd rather them get shamed and feel bad about themselves all the time?  Sounds like a bully to me. Or at least someone who is very insecure in their own self."
AskReddit,fccu5ni,t1_fcbknmf,1577602670.0,"The big question here is, why are you so emotionally invested in strangers to the point where you look down on them and feel entitled to shame them because their success story isn't the same method as yours?  

Half of your thoughts on how much people give a shit about their situation is probably your own assumptions without actually knowing the person. It's judgmental and none of our business anyways. It's just looking for someone to hate because they're not as successful as you, or judging them for not thinking of doing the same things as you. Not everyone is at that point that you find acceptable, and that's okay. It's not a race and it's not a comparison contest.

 You dont know what's going on in a person's life that has led to them being overweight and you dont know how far along they are in their weight loss journey.  You could be shaming a 300 pound person who is struggling with depression but has already lost 100 pounds. How would you feel if your words worsened their depression and ruined their progress?  Shaming people is what angry, insecure people do. Building people up despite the state the person is in is a true sign of maturity and goodness."
AskReddit,fcbc59t,t1_fcb2i7y,1577585064.0,"Really now.  So you dont give a shit about people who are depressed/suicidal?  Let me guess.  You're one of those people who think depression and suicide are part of ""natural selection""."

AskReddit,fcb0gnc,t1_fcapjxd,1577580229.0,"Nobody deserves to be treated like shit by others for being overweight. That's bully logic. It costs nothing to be kind to people. Many overweight people have their own struggles as it is, not to mention mental health might be a factor. Saying that they deserve to be shamed like it's your god-given job is just a sad excuse to be mean to someone."
