If someone else dies in your timeline, they jump to a different one. So they are still gone from the one you are in, but they are also still alive in their own timeline.

Food cooks fast from frozen, and the high temp basically sanitizes the hell out of it. They said it's one of the reasons that you see year old burgers that aren't all rotten.
