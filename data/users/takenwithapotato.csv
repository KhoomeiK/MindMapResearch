youseeingthisshit,ffaya8z,t3_eskqit,1579747291.0,"Instagram influencers trigger me to no end. I know one or two ""influencers"", and the distance they go to paint their lives as perfect actually causes them a lot of stress and emotional instability. It's such a toxic way to live life, and you also get to see them doing stupid stuff like this."
worldnews,ff9bamh,t1_ff9axu4,1579709049.0,"That's what I mean though.. Those in poverty are more affected by this problem because fast food is cheap. At the same time it's fatty and unhealthy. This perpetuates the cycle that poorer people will have worse health but at the same time not be able to afford healthcare. 

This links to my point which is that fast food causes a lot of problems. The reason for the success of fast food could stem back to corporate greed like you said."
worldnews,ff9ahfv,t1_ff9a0zh,1579708542.0,"Cheap and high calorie food in large portions is one of the main reasons that obesity is becoming an epidemic. I never said fast food always causes obesity, but before the era of fast food people were more health conscious and therefore these health problems were less prevalent. Same goes for the Pacific Islands where fast food in a traditionally nutrient deprived area caused problems with obesity."

The amount of money that goes towards these diseases which used to only affect the ""rich"" is massive.

Edit: You're all free to go on your fuck China bandwagon but I'm just telling the truth as it is. If you're offended then maybe you should reflect on why you are."
