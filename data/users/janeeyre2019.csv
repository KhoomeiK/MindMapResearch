Mcat,few6iyz,t1_few5794,1579405996.0,"That‚Äôs kind of my situation. I‚Äôm set to graduate in three years, and I‚Äôd like to go straight on to med school. I‚Äôve also had someone tell me the same thing about applying without an MCAT, but I‚Äôm scared that it could be too risky?"
Mcat,few2exc,t1_few1vlv,1579404534.0,That sounds like a really good idea. Would it be very difficult to study for the MCAT while still taking classes?
Mcat,fevktjt,t1_fevk5vr,1579398593.0,How long do you think it would take to self-study these topics? I'm hoping to take the MCAT over my winter break next year which would be roughly a month of uninterrupted studying.
