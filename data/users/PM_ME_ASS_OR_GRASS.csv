But I can't help but be a little upset with Warren playing the victim in that moment. But Bernie also dismissed that moment and said they were talking about the weather.

I asked him what the normal amount was for previous presidents as a comparison, and he had no idea. He hasn't said shit about Trump's golfing trips. He also called Obama hitler because of something about executive orders. He's been silent about trump's abuses of powers. Really sad that he has the mentality of ""it's okay as long as it's a republican doing it"". I'm sick of this party over country bullshit."

AskMen,fdtu1hv,t3_emsn6g,1578722203.0,"I drive an old Jeep, and I've needed to do a lot of repairs on it over the years. When a part fails completely and it's no longer driveable, I have no choice but to fix it. Usually, it's easy to track down the problem and I just replace the part. Simple. Sometimes though, the part doesn't fail completely. It just starts acting up intermittently. Sometimes it works perfectly fine, sometimes it doesn't. But overall, I'm still able to make the Jeep drive and do what it needs to do. When the problem is more intermittent and doesn't prevent me from driving, it's harder for me to a) be confident which part is the actual issue, and b) justify the cost, time, and effort of replacing the part, seeing as I'm able to still drive regardless.

Somewhere in here is an analogy. If the relationship is so bad that it's no longer working at all, we have no choice but to either fix it or get out. But when the problem is not so obvious to us, and more intermittent, and we're still able to get most of what we want out of the relationship like sex and companionship -- well then we have the option to kinda ignore the problem if it's not worth the trouble of fixing."
