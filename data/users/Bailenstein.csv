PhotoshopTutorials,ffde854,t3_esytnt,1579819023.0,"This is essentially a double exposure.  The photographer took two shots, one with the subject looking straight ahead, and another with him looking off to the side.  They then layered the second photo on top of the first and blended them together with a mask of just the face and the hair."
PhotoshopTutorials,ffddn69,t1_ffd7vz8,1579818677.0,"Also, there's actually a text-to-path tool on the sidebar.  You can use that, click directly on a path and type from there.  It should be under the text tool drop-down menu.  If not, click on the elipsis near the color picker and you can add it."

Steam,fezll2i,t1_fezc6gw,1579458652.0,"No, if it came to litigation you'd have to prove that you owned the game during the time you had the ROM, and that you ripped it yourself.  Downloading ROMs is illegal, and your download history could give you away, but they'd have no way of knowing where you got the ROM from just by the file itself.  If it's a legit rip, the file will always be exactly the same, otherwise it's a hack."
Steam,fez4ita,t1_feyw3ox,1579453775.0,"There is no discernable difference between a legit ROM and a non-legit ROM from a technical standpoint, unless it's a hack.  A ROM is legit if you own a copy of said game, which they have no way of knowing one way or the other."

PhotoshopTutorials,fdowm2v,t3_eltdcr,1578614543.0,"This is not an effect that you can easily replicate in photoshop, at least not if you want it to look legit.  Liquify and blur can work, but requires a good deal of patience and craftsmanship for something that is very easy to achieve with a camera.  So long as you have a camera with variable shutter speeds, all you need to do is shoot a model shaking their head back and forth while using a slow shutter speed.  That's essentially how it was done in the movie, anyway.  They just recorded actors shaking their heads back and forth while keeping the rest of their bodies still, then sped up the footage.

If you want it to look realistic just using photoshop, you need to account for the head's trajectory and how the face would look from at least three separate angles(left profile, right profile, head on), although I suppose you could mirror the profile shots.  Theoretically, you could shoot three separate photos of these angles, superimpose them on top of each other, blend layers appropriately, and use liquify and blur to fill in the gaps and touch it up a bit.  But that's seems like a lot of tedious and unnecessary work for something that's really simple with the proper equipment."

beatsaber,fclqckh,t3_ehoqnp,1577753900.0,"My suggestion?  Download a playlist that has at least the 200 top ranked maps, sort them by difficulty and play the easiest ones.  Any of the maps worth 100pp or less are pretty easy to get through if you're good at expert, and most of them are ""expert+"".  If you're on psvr or otherwise can't/won't use custom maps, think of the expert maps you consider the hardest and just keep playing them until you can regularly get SS on them.  Then start with $100 Bills when moving into expert+."
