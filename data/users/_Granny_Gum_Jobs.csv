childfree,fg5tney,t1_fg3bwue,1580538450.0,"""People buy the products ""

I could just stop reading there....lol
But I will go on and explain why your reason is flawed. Without people, there is no purchase to begin with.

""there is no form of capitalism that will not lead to exploitation""
I never disagreed with this. I said that with a low enough population, the consumption of resources will not exceed our and mother natures ability to replenish them. I said you can have exploitation but still have a manageable ecosystem. But you shouldn't act like you can live on this earth without exploding the environment. 


""the love of money is the root of all evil""

What is the root of money then? Money is a tool of trade. Money doesn't exist without people willing to trade with each other. Before money existed, people traded gold. Before gold people traded for other goods. If it is money that is evil, and the purchase of these goods which have been created through exploitation, then why is the purchaser not evil? They are the ones who bought it. Nobody put a gun to their head and forced them to buy their product. Money only facilitates free trade. Money is a tool. Money is not evil, it is an inanimate concept. People are evil. Guns are not evil, people are evil. Nuclear power can be used for good or for evil, but it is people who create that distinction. 

I have bad news for you. You cannot live on this earth without consuming resources. You must eat food and consume water to live. This means farmers must harvest crops. To harvest crops they require machinery and electricity. Machinery requires petroleum products. Petroleum products require oil and gas drilling. The trucks which transport your food require petroleum. Even electric machinery requires oil for lubrication. The packaged containers which hold your food use petroleum products. 

Even if you decide to live off the land and be a hermit, you must plow the land. You must cut down trees to build shelter. And the more you consume, the less there is for other animals and other humans. Money allows you to do what YOU want to do, what you are best at, and trade for what you do not do. It is inefficient to farm AND work construction, AND hunt/gather, AND cook the food, AND build a well/haul water, AND chop firewood, AND built irrigation, AND run plumbing. Basic economics teaches us that it is far more efficient to do one thing and do it well, than do many things and do them poorly. 

Solar power doesn't completely replace petroleum. Petroleum is required for tires, solvents, shampoo, toothpaste, refrigerators, asphalt, detergents, trash bags, plastics, pipes, vitamins, and hundreds of other products you would be surprised about. The worlds energy needs are growing, not shrinking. The world needs more energy than ever, and solar power alone won't work- not at this rate of population growth and energy usage. 

Capitalism is merely an economic system. It is the voluntary exchange of labour for money amongst other private individuals. Nothing more. If  you don't want capitalism, then be a hermit and live off the land. But know that in doing so you are living less efficiently than if you had traded your skilled labour for the products of your skilled fellows. Money is your means of survival. The minute you denounce it is the minute you damn your own existence. The average person eats 35 tons of food in their lifetime. Imagine for a second, you being the only person on earth. The total consumption of food is 35 tons.  Now imagine bringing a child into this world. They consume another 35 tons of food throughout their lifetime. By bringing a child into this world, you have just DOUBLED the amount of food consumption on the planet. We haven't even begun considering the electricity you and your child will need, wood to build your home, fresh water to drink, and so on.

What you seem to be suggesting is that instead of capitalism; instead of trading by barter and free will, people trade through compulsion and by force, or just live off the land, which is very inefficient. Economic growth is a product of increasing populations. If the population stayed the same, we would struggle to take advantage of new technology and new products because there would be limited number of people to build them. Without growth of population, it would mean people must stop what they are currently building, to build something else. But increase in population allows more and more people to branch out and specialize in new roles, allowing new technology and new products to be built."

Fort Riley is origin of the Spanish Flu. They gave it to soliders deliberately knowing they would go off to fight soon. The bacteria spread all over the world through contact in combat during WW1. The deaths were caused by bacterial pneumonia, not the flu. Poor sanitation and bad food preparation, especially in the field didn't help

cscareerquestions,ffpdb9a,t3_euabu2,1580092189.0,"Canada would be a good option as it has huge number of game studios in Montreal, Vancouver, Toronto and Edmonton. I would consider going to a game dev focused university for your CS degree. UBC or Simon Fraser University in Vancouver are good choices. Utah University is another good one but there are many more. 

Practice with unreal and be very proficient with C++ and math. You will struggle ro get into the game industry without a very strong portfolio, a published game, and/or experience at a game company.

Working on game engines is a fun, well paying and interesting job. Working on game design, gameplay, art etc is also fun, but expendable and subject to huge ups and downs. Even if your game does well you can be laid off. There is less stability overall in the game industry, but the work there can be very challenging and easily open doors to other industries. If you can write a 3D game engine from scratch, almost everything else in the software industry will seem easy after that.

It's good you are in high school and already planning your future. Starting early is the best thing you can do. Start today, buy some game development and programming textbooks. Use Udemy and other online  resources"
unrealengine,ffpculr,t3_euer6c,1580091863.0,"It's best to just build things. When you come across a problem, try a few things. If that doesn't work, google how to solve it. Continue to slowly build and try things and you will learn. Copy and pasting from tutorials is okay, but trying on your own is best. 
Understanding programming and computer science definitely helps but not required"

Average software engineer salary is 93k. Tech jobs are in demand and will likely continue to rise in demand in Canada.

Applied math is concerned with solving problems in other fields like science. Pure math is concerned with solving problems in math and its more theoretical. The problems solved in pure math often do not have practical application, at least not yet. It's application may not be of practical use for decades or more, whereas applied math is practical today. Pure math would likely apply to more research based CS jobs"
