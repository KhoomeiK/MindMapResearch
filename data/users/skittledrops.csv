college,ff1rlh8,t1_fetpg9w,1579484627.0,Thank you! :)
college,fepurua,t1_fenngl2,1579332030.0,I see. Well best of luck to the both of us! I still gotta figure out what I should look into (because so far all I know is that I don't like what I'm doing). Hopefully you're doing very much better than I am and sorry that it's late but have a great year ahead!
college,feltadx,t1_fekjs3t,1579230395.0,"Hey, first of all I'm really glad that you're feeling much better now after having gone through so much since you were a kid. I can't really say that I'm different but I guess everyone's got their own issues. I hope I'll be able to move on and like you said, find/give meaning to my life. Depression/anxiety is really a bummer when it comes to figuring life choices out."
college,felsvnc,t1_fek5qn9,1579230105.0,Wow a pro development course? I never thought about it! I've been so fixated on having to redo a second bachelor's degree in order to get into a totally different field but hey that's a great suggestion you've given me!
college,felspao,t1_fek4fye,1579229982.0,"Hey! I think you're amazing to have such resolve (I would've given up halfway, I mean I kinda gave up on having a second degree). Thanks for your advice, I'll try my best to follow and best wishes to the both of us."
college,felsfow,t1_fejwwti,1579229793.0,Hopefully that'll be true for all of us who feel this way :)
college,fejo0dm,t3_epchz8,1579181237.0,"I get what you mean. I'm in my second year now and ever since high school I've just been quite distant from my classmates which I definitely regret. I'm alright with my family I guess but besides that whoever I speak to, I'd either be extremely quiet (nodding and giving monosyllabic responses every now and then) or I'd just be really talkative by imagining myself to be some sort of an extrovert. This works for some reason. Idk about you but the only side effect for me is to feel guilty about speaking to people afterwards."
college,fejnial,t1_fejg94c,1579180800.0,"Hey! Thanks for your time and effort in replying to my post. I wish I had stupid moments to laugh at haha but I had no friends back in high school and I did a lot of things I regret like missing an exam etc I still got into an alright college but of course, it wouldn't have been my first choice. I mean, I'm already 20+, I feel like I have nothing nice to look back at and I don't have high hopes of looking forward. I actually just want to be okay but we'll see I guess haha. Well changing the topic I wish you all the best in your upcoming second year."
college,fejn01n,t1_fejcf82,1579180342.0,"Hi, like the other comments I'd like to thank you for your time to read my post as well. I understand that the best that I could probably do is to just do my best, earn enough for a living and then do whatever I want after that. The thing is just, well, I made a horrible decision regarding my career path before entering college but I guess not much could be done now. I'll try to strive for happiness like you've advised at my very best but we'll see how. :)"
college,fejmn5t,t1_fejcd5j,1579180012.0,Hi! Thanks for sharing (I never thought I'd get a reply haha). It's refreshing to know that there are people like you who can step out of the rut and start making changes to your life. I hope I'll be able to do the same as well. It's just painful to imagine the rest of my life working in a job I hate due to the choice of my degree which definitely narrowed down my options but I guess we could always look at the brighter side.
