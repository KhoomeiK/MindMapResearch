What? Whoever said take a loan on 15k and invest 10k? Then ""all the other money in your account"" doesn't matter.

The only issue is car value and the benefit of taking a low interest loan and keeping the money invested, over paying cash. 

I gave a super simple example earlier. The other Y amount of money in your account doesn't come into play....who cares if you have more in your account.

Cost isn't being used wrong at all, it can be used easily how I am using it and people understand. Obviously it is not a ""bill"" cost, it's obvious what is meant.

This has nothing to do with anything. You're trying to bring other nonsensical stuff into a pretty simple thing.

I don't know where you came up with take a 15k loan and invest 10k when you could pay 15k cash. I never said that.

If the car is 15k, do a 2% loan on 15k and invest the 15k.

The reason you take a payment plan at a lower interest rate is because the 15k will earn a higher rate. It's seriously simple and high school math.

If you don't want to do that, that's fine. The whole point though is *simple basic high school math*. Do a 5 year loan at 2% and earn 7% over the five years while having your money invested obviously means you make 5%. Where if you just pay cash at the door, you make 0.

The point is, ""I pay cash for my vehicles"" is counter intuitive and actually costs you money. If you're gonna throw down 15k car on a car, it is black and white it will cost you more than if you did a loan at a lower rate and invested the 15k.

As for you saying not to finance if you can pay cash, you're wasting money for no good reason. Paying cash **costs you money**. Here, some basic easy numbers. 20k loan vs paying cash.

20k cash out of pocket (vs a 5 year loan). You'll actually lose more than 20k due to TVM and inflation, but we'll leave that out of this. So, boom, paid 20k...gone. have the car.

Now, you get a 5 year 2.5% loan on it and keep the 20k invested. Say you make an average return of 7%.

Over the loan you'd pay out $1,033.31.

Over the loan, your investment of 20k @ 7% return is now worth $28,051.03.

By paying cash, you're **losing $7,017.72.** 

As for insurance not covering car in the event of totalling it and having the ""gap"". Well, 2 things.

One: you have your investment that is making money that you could use part of to pay off difference. You're still ahead because you made money that whole time you have the loan.

Two: gap insurance on a loan is cheap as fuck, generally around 1% of total value...give or take depending on bank. So you could get that and you're covered if insurance totals your car and doesnt pay what you owe. The loaning bank will cover the ""gap"".

So, it is to each their own if they want a 15k car, a year or two old one, or brand new. As long as you can afford it, it is subjective for each person.

But, as for paying cash for a car....it is a fact that is a bad idea. Say we even had a major recession like in 2008....it wont wipe out a diversified account, and say you invested the 20k in 2007, left it throughout the 5 years, by 2012 you still would come out ahead based off how the markets recovered.

There is always the risk of the economy crashing, though low. Plus, if you have the ability, when it crashes you should put more money in investments. The US economy isnt going away anytime soon. You'll gain the sweet gains of buying everything low while it rebounds over next years. I shoved all extra money in after 2008 and by 2013 I had massive returns compared to a normal 5 year investment.

But, you can hedge against a recession too, buy keeping the investment less aggressive. But really, unless you're nearing retirement, I wouldnt recommend that.

Getting off topic. Point is, over a 5 year loan on a 20k new car, you would lose over $7k by paying cash. Even if you bought a 20k used, you'd still be losing money as rates on used are 2-4%, still behind the easy 7% investment gains."

I've never seen someone drive a 4-5k car for 10 years that wasnt a POS and had issues with it. But that's just what I've seen, not saying you're a liar.

I do agree, buying a car brand new can suck because of the hit you take driving it off the lot.

The reason I do it is I can get 0-2% interest rates on brand new, and I keep the cash in investments which return way more than that.

I drive quite a bit and get toyotas because their resale here is stupid high. After 3 to 8 years (depending in driving,  we rate deals, etc.) I sell my toyota for nearly half it's new value.

So that works for me, by keeping my cash in investments I'm making way more than I pay in interest. It would actually cost me money to pay cash.

Everyone's wants/needs are different. I can afford the payment when it's there and a house payment, so it doesnt bother me. It all depends on your situation. Someone isnt automatically stupid for purchasing a new car.

Plus, I rarely ever have to do maintenance issues on my vehicles."
IAmA,feveugt,t1_feufejp,1579396552.0,">If I can’t pay cash (other than a house) I can’t afford it.

This is actually a bad idea, that I hear all too often.

Interest on a car, if you have good credit, is very low. My investment accounts, especially last ten years, return more than double to triple (and more so even) easily in last ten years, though that's not going to always be true obviously. My point is, I just bought a new Rav4 Hybrid, got 1.9% for 60 .months. 

It would cost me money to pay cash. You're betting off keeping the 38k in investments making a bigger return than the car loan interest.

The ""I only pay cash"" idea costs you money actually! Talk to a financial planner and make money by using the low interest loans.

All this goes for anything with low rates. Hell, money for a house and with what rates are still, you're better off taking a mortgage and keeping it invested. Obviously lots of details and life plans come into account, but generally if you have the money, you're better off keeping it invested."

Again, you vaguely stated conspiracy in your original comment and I asked to clarify and was discussing the topic on OPs post. Your original vague statement made it seem like you were calling gerrymandering a conspiracy. 

I dont care about if you view vox as a conspiracy site (it isnt, its just shitty biased videos). 

The topic most were discussing, including myself, was the issue with gerrymandering. You're posting other videos and flipping out about vox, where the video in OP is actually non-conspiracy and fact based. 

I dont really care about your incorrect views on Vox, the point of the post was to discuss the topic in the video and the video itself. You're just trying to make the argument about vox being just a conspiracy site so you dont have to discuss the issue at hand.

Go reread your initial vague posts and see I was trying to get you to clarify. Now that I see you're just trying to bitch about Vox instead of the issue in the video...I dont really care then.

You're making an entirely different argument. I was only speaking to that specific video and the issues brought up within it.
