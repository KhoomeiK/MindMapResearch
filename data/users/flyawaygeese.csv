dogswithjobs,ff6f6cr,t1_ff6euhg,1579625866.0,"Yes there have been people to get giardia and ecoli from geese. It’s not generally drinking the water but kids playing on fields with goose poop putting hands in mouth etc. 
Beaches have been closed due to high levels of E. coli in the water and it being unsafe for humans attributed to geese in the water. 
Town water supplies have been deemed unusable until treatment and retesting of bacteria and algae levels due to geese. As the populations of resident birds increase it is becoming a bigger issue."
dogswithjobs,ff67k7y,t1_ff640em,1579621009.0,Yes a 48” circle webbing
dogswithjobs,ff5zqp4,t1_ff5a1pz,1579615362.0,Thank you and you are correct hazing geese does not require a permit even. It’s humane and PETA and the Humane Society even recommend it. It’s very legal.

dogswithjobs,ff5zgny,t1_ff5u4g6,1579615135.0,"E Coli, giardia, coccidia to name a few. The also are a big culprit in blue green algae outbreaks."
dogswithjobs,ff5oa68,t1_ff58jgv,1579602976.0,We took a climbing loop and just went over the shoulders with it
dogswithjobs,ff5o8o3,t1_ff5cfc3,1579602914.0,"1. Geese spread disease and are over populated. In public areas this is a big issue. This is a business park area where people eat lunch etc. 

2. Having a permit and addling eggs helps slow population increase and spread of disease through the flock. Because of lack of natural predators in cities they are over populating and spreading disease amongst themselves. 

3. Thank you!"

dogswithjobs,ff4dr4a,t1_ff4do5z,1579561202.0,"No the dogs pressure in the right place keeps the ducks together. The ducks in the video are flightless ducks, runner ducks."
dogswithjobs,ff4dlma,t1_ff4dfs8,1579561099.0,He is tethered to the handler on the roof. His harness clips from the strap he’s carried up on to another lead.
dogswithjobs,ff4cvkn,t1_ff4bqe9,1579560626.0,Next video!!
dogswithjobs,ff4cu6c,t1_ff4bj2l,1579560600.0,Thank you!! I felt bad.
dogswithjobs,ff4cr7z,t1_ff4cput,1579560550.0,No he just goes up a couple of times per week.
dogswithjobs,ff4axl8,t1_ff4awjd,1579559375.0,You got it

dogswithjobs,ff49vku,t1_ff49udr,1579558709.0,We tried that. Took too long to get him out to work.
dogswithjobs,ff49u16,t1_ff49q66,1579558680.0,What exactly would I be advertising? Do you see a ton of people looking for a harness to put a dog on a roof with lol. Not really a big ad item.
dogswithjobs,ff49pb7,t1_ff49li8,1579558600.0,I’m sorry you think it is. I have no affiliation with the company.  It won’t let me edit it out but it certainly wasn’t intended as an ad just trying to keep people from flipping out thinking we hadn’t made him safe.
dogswithjobs,ff48c8r,t1_ff486x5,1579557744.0,I apologize. Was not my intent. I didn’t want people thinking the dog wasn’t safe. It won’t let me edit it out but it certainly wasn’t intended as an ad just trying to keep people from flipping out thinking we hadn’t made him safe. I have had people panic before. I was avoiding that so I thought.
dogswithjobs,ff47v62,t1_ff47lil,1579557450.0,There were no geese. I promise as soon as we catch them video to follow.
dogswithjobs,ff472k8,t1_ff46jv5,1579556962.0,I apologize. Was not my intent. I didn’t want people thinking the dog wasn’t safe. It won’t let me edit it out but it certainly wasn’t intended as an ad just trying to keep people from flipping out thinking we hadn’t made him safe.
dogswithjobs,ff46wzb,t1_ff46rj6,1579556865.0,I can’t edit it. As you say the world is crazy. I didn’t want people to freak thinking the dog wasn’t safe. Had I not said it they would have. I can’t remove it but it wasn’t intended as an ad.
dogswithjobs,ff46rls,t1_ff46k6r,1579556771.0,I apologize. Was not my intent. I didn’t want people thinking the dog wasn’t safe. It won’t let me edit it out but it certainly wasn’t intended as an ad just trying to keep people from flipping out thinking we hadn’t made him safe.
dogswithjobs,ff46kid,t1_ff46gfy,1579556649.0,We want for the geese to think there there is a predator in the area and not to come back. Yes we could chase them off with people but they would Cole right back.
dogswithjobs,ff45ylw,t1_ff45vgh,1579556273.0,Firing weapons real or fake in the city limits next to a park wouldn’t go over well.
dogswithjobs,ff45j90,t1_ff45hp6,1579556007.0,No but the geese are picking at the membranes.
dogswithjobs,ff433rr,t1_ff42sgp,1579554491.0,Sorry there were no birds and recording from top and bottom proved harder than I thought. There were no birds on this climb. I promise one is coming.
dogswithjobs,ff42hyi,t1_ff41u0y,1579554116.0,Lol yes that
dogswithjobs,ff3zpxq,t1_ff3yxza,1579552391.0,Nooo. He broke his leg as a puppy before he came to us. It didn’t heal right from what I understand and so the orthopedic vet said amputation was the only option.
dogswithjobs,ff3wwfp,t1_ff3wvax,1579550626.0,Dads lost his mind lol
dogswithjobs,ff3wv96,t1_ff3wd3z,1579550605.0,Honestly I just wanted people to know we weren’t just half hauling him up the ladder. This was his first time in the harness. I have no interest in promoting the harness. I couldn’t video roof and climb at same time but when there are birds on the roof I will get that with the go pro I think. I just thought it was a cool video of a working dog headed to work.
dogswithjobs,ff3uxh2,t1_ff3uwoj,1579549397.0,Amen
dogswithjobs,ff3uw8h,t1_ff3utcn,1579549375.0,Next time there are some. None this climb.

dogswithjobs,ff3txre,t1_ff3ia0b,1579548779.0,That will be part 2 next time there are geese.
dogswithjobs,ff3t5co,t1_ff3t4gn,1579548295.0,That’s what I’m thinking
dogswithjobs,ff3t3i7,t1_ff3t1u1,1579548263.0,They are welcome to them
dogswithjobs,ff3t1jp,t1_ff3sy4i,1579548228.0,Trying to decide if GoPro is my best bet on part 2. I need my handler hands free to manage the dog. Safety first!!
dogswithjobs,ff3svxq,t1_ff3srtz,1579548132.0,There weren’t any geese but next time they are there I promise a video. The climb up was his first.
dogswithjobs,ff3sjiz,t1_ff3qf4h,1579547921.0,We do other things as well but with stubborn birds a perceived predator is the only convincing means.
dogswithjobs,ff3rqo9,t1_ff3rob6,1579547427.0,He does only have 3 legs
dogswithjobs,ff3p270,t1_ff3oyp3,1579545792.0,I will get that next time there are birds. There weren’t any this day.
dogswithjobs,ff3odss,t1_ff3oa6j,1579545378.0,He is for sure!
dogswithjobs,ff3o2lt,t1_ff3nwul,1579545182.0,This was our first climb with this new harness. But to answer your initial question we do have cameras on the roofs that have WiFi.
dogswithjobs,ff3lbau,t1_ff3la21,1579543479.0,Next time we have birds up there!
dogswithjobs,ff3l95k,t1_ff3l7v2,1579543441.0,You got it. There were no birds on this run.
dogswithjobs,ff3iq1j,t1_ff3hwe4,1579541896.0,That’s funny
dogswithjobs,evdqrfp,t1_evddmvf,1564445037.0,They did when her mom got out. She’s not quite fast enough yet she needed a bit of help.
