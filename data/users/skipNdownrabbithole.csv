WatchPeopleDieInside,fejqtrm,t1_fejplxn,1579183539.0,"Thank you for explaining that to me, I really appreciate it. So what do you feel is best to do? Close your boarders and only let people live there who do it the legal way.. send everyone trying to get in illegally back.... how do we help people in other countries learn how to live in a civilized society and make use of what they have when we aren’t doing that great of a job?. How do we get everyone to fight together and go against big companies when we are too busy trying to stay afloat and for some just trying to survive? I feel like I want to help others especially those suffering so much worse than me but I also want to create a good life for my family and enjoy my “privilege” of being born in America. I am just so confused with what to believe and what is best for me and for every human being on earth. How do we stop others from suffering?"

WatchPeopleDieInside,fejp37u,t1_fejn2mz,1579182153.0,"But what about people who refuse to contribute to society? Should they get to live next door to me? A good person and works hard for what I have? (I’m being 100% serious) I agree if someone what’s to come to the country I live in and contribute, but what do we do with all the people living here that don’t? And how do we help the people who want to come here and make a better life? How do we control the bad when there are so many bad people already living here. Sometimes it feels like the bad outweighs the good on earth.... what if it eventually takes over? How do we get everyone on the same page to stop fighting and help everyone become better people and we all live happily ever after, together? The questions I have haunt me."
