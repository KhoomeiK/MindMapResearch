Fibromyalgia,fcowebt,t1_fcove0a,1577843408.0,"ofc! as for doctors being stupid, it’s ok. honestly since i’m gonna be medicated for bipolar disorder soon they’re gonna let me go on a pain medication just in case, so i should be all good!

the funniest thing was when i went to a world renowned children’s hospital when i was like 13 and told them my symptoms, they tested me for RA and Lupus and all those other autoimmune things and came up negative, but i have granuloma annulare (a rash on my ankles and knees) that’s associated with autoimmune disorders so even after testing my tender points and asking me a million questions they told me it couldn’t be fibromyalgia lmao. we love a good doctor (/s)"

here’s a link to one study!
i have bipolar 2 disorder and have had fibro symptoms since i was 11 years old, doctors refuse to diagnose me because they think it’s all in my head due to my bipolar disorder. i found comfort in knowing it’s not uncommon to have both!
