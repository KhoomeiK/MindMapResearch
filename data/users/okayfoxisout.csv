I may even say “I hate this!” when referring to hitting all red lights, spilling coffee on myself, or stubbing my toe. It’s a figure of speech and isn’t meant to imply that I’m a hateful person, or that each small inconvenience or disappointment breaks my heart. 

I can understand the confusion based on my first comment because this is the internet and you don’t know me personally, maybe I should have chosen my words better, but I have explained myself and my true feelings MULTIPLE times and that they weren’t meant to be spiteful or disrespectful, but people seem to want to argue just for the sake of arguing.

Also, it’s impossible for me right now to work at a company that is 100% vegan.  If you look up the definition of vegan, it’s:

 ""A philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude—as far as is possible and practicable—all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of animals, humans and the environment. In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals."" 

By working at a company which actively promotes vegan options, I am doing the best there is possible for me and practical.
