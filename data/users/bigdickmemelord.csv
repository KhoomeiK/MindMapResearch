MMA,fef9rbu,t1_fef7o9k,1579051524.0,"I was actually cheering with my friends when khabib won against conor, staying up late until 7 am to watch it, so yess i am a khabib fan and i dont care if you believe me or not. So dont tell me im not a khabib fan. Im just stating how the fight went. After the first round took place i knew that conor still had a punchers chance because he didnt manage to punish conor enough when he was on top of him. Conor came out of that second round still kind of fresh and i felt conor was still in the fight, untill the overhand happened and he got absolute trashed. Round 3 started and all of a sudden after a complete ass whooping, conor won the third round, which seemed kind of unbelieveable when i was watching it live, conor was stuffing the take downs, and winning the round. When the fourth round happened it seemed to me khabib got second wind after losing that third round and with it, beat conor. But to then say after all of this back and forth that khabib handled conor like a kid (like a person above said and many people upvoted)  is just a straight lie."
MMA,feeyyy6,t1_feeso8s,1579044312.0,"I said conor exceeded my expectations. If you pretend conor got treated like a child, then a child won a round against khabib in the third round. And the first round he actually avoided everything khabib was throwing at him from the top.
 conor showed against khabib an ability that should be more than enough for him to defend anything cowboy throws at him."
MMA,feerr2o,t1_feelncd,1579039807.0,Wellthat was round 2 wasnt it? Never said he won that round
MMA,feeh8iu,t1_feeclfo,1579033704.0,"Im a big khabib fan, and even i thought against khabib conor did way better than i expected. Round 1 khabib did basicly no real damage, other than to drain conorâ€™s stamina. round 2 conor was hit by that overhand giving khabib an easy entry to a very dominant position. Round three conor actually won the round, and round four khabibâ€™s cardio was just ahead of conor. Not to take anything away from khabibs win, but conor grappled against khabib waayyy better than i expected."

Sounds like youâ€™re blowing steam here. And how are you going to murder him after he just punched you multiple times out of nowhere (and made you woble).
If you were in the guyâ€™s shoes there would have been no difference as to how the situation wouldve turned out.
Also, youâ€™re stupid."

MMA,fcobdy8,t1_fco8su4,1577828110.0,"Well you stating yoel romero and jacare just shows how low your understanding is of mma. Yoel romero Is more striker than grappler and even when he grapples, he cant do anything with it, he took bobby down multiple times after he rocked bobby and he couldnt hold him down. jacare is good at bjj aspect but has shitty wrestling and he too tries to strike more than grapple,Thats 2 out of 4 fighters you just mentioned that dont and cant implement their grapling and youâ€™re telling me theyâ€™re better at grapling than the guy that ONLY wins by way of grappling?"
