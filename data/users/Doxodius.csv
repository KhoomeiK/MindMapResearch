3d6,ff59pnf,t3_erkdwp,1579584492.0,"A reassuring word with a comforting hands on the shoulder to bolster their spirits.  (Remember HP doesn't just represent physical injuries)

Another option: flavor it like a ki type ability, revitalize an ally with a touch."
wholesomememes,feywejc,t1_feyrbxo,1579451324.0,"Food for thought: you could spend that same energy looking for the good, instead of the bad, and you slowly retrain your brain, and the world around you becomes just that much more beautiful."
Gloomhaven,fewm93x,t1_fewjfym,1579414420.0,"Just play, and get tons of the rules wrong, play more, figure out the other rules you got wrong, and keep going.  Got to start having fun at some point."
dndmemes,feoztgy,t1_feoqbwd,1579308976.0,"I prefer doing lore checks, keeps it more fun for me as a player.   But to reach their own."
dndnext,felselb,t3_epoorp,1579229772.0,"My FLGS runs pick up games every Saturday, charge $3 to all players, which goes to the DM as store credit.   Advancement is tied to the player based on attendance (unlike Adventure League being tied to a character).  Games are just one shots the rotating group of DMs feel like running.  It is fantastic, and worth every penny.  Makes it easy to try playing all kinds of different classes.   I always know I can play any Saturday, and if I can't make it I'm not letting anyone down.     

TL;DR paying a DM is totally worth it, and I'd definitely pay more than $3 for it."

Gloomhaven,fein3sx,t3_epcluz,1579142399.0,Would gearing up help?
dndnext,fe2oqlo,t3_enjuoj,1578841293.0,"So...  He sounds abusive, and you sound nervous about calling him on that lest he direct his abuse at you.   I could be reading too much into this, but it sounds pretty unhealthy, and should be talked out directly ASAP."
dndmemes,fe2lgzs,t3_ennhks,1578839957.0,"You could tell them you would love to hear their constructive criticism and advice after the end of the session, but to be please save it for then so you can keep the game moving along."
dndmemes,fe2k48b,t3_enmemk,1578839351.0,This is why I like playing dual wielding fighters.   If you roll enough attacks you eventually hit.
DMAcademy,fdwsakc,t3_en9p88,1578761893.0,"Keep them in initiative order whether in combat or not.   Logistically it helps you keep things moving, and know when they can take actions.  Remember a rounds is all of 6 seconds, so that character realistically isn't going to get much done ""out if combat"" anyway."
DMAcademy,fdt2p68,t3_emxas6,1578711140.0,"Does it have to be 1 vs 1?  Can he back off and have some of his elite guard jump in while he runs? Make it a series of chasing rounds, where he pulls in extra units to gum things up.  Lots of options.  Think about how a movie you love might do an epic battle like this, and reflavor until it works."
factorio,fdcxdm8,t3_eknh3v,1578287110.0,Multiple legs is the real winner.  Speed running everywhere is great
factorio,fdcuxwp,t3_ekolj5,1578285037.0,The real end game begins.
wholesomememes,fcucdgt,t1_fcsymcx,1577977673.0,"I feel the same.

I've made a point of teaching and practicing forgiveness a lot.  I also make a point of identifying my mistakes to them(in age appropriate fashion) so they can learn from them, and see that it's ok to be wrong and ask for forgiveness.  

As with all parents I just hope my colossal mistakes are made up for by the things I did get right."
dndmemes,fcuawht,t3_eiti9x,1577976707.0,"For those days when you just can't roll a decent to hit, it is nice to be a caster and pull out some save based spells."
factorio,fca1k1d,t1_fc9v8w9,1577561584.0,"Satisfactory is a lot of fun, but playing it exactly like factorio isn't as fun.  Use foundations, and embrace vertical construction and it is it's own kind of fun.  That said, you do you, nothing wrong with sticking with factorio if that's what you prefer."
wholesomememes,fc4nvap,t1_fc2gvn4,1577422297.0,The tradition is yours to pass on now.
todayilearned,fbwxv3s,t3_eeljqb,1577162418.0,This is what a hero looks like.
TheExpanse,fbwxd3z,t3_eevhbj,1577162002.0,"I was going to savor it.  Just finished watching season 4 10 minutes ago.  It was a good plan, but the show is really, really good."
wholesomememes,fbwx4im,t1_fbw7ihj,1577161807.0,"I see you understand the ""non""-profit hospital business plan."
dndmemes,fbtinyd,t1_fbt873i,1577080280.0,"It's generally those moments when yet another DM is doing something like making elves fall asleep despite their immunity that bugs me.  You have a character, it has features, if the DM is just going to ignore then randomly it will deeply frustrate the players."
