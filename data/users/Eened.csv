unpopularopinion,ffhesn7,t1_ffhei9x,1579932265.0,"I didn’t say it was easy work by any means. My job it’s self doesn’t involve manual labor however it is mentally taxing, but that’s a different story. I was mainly just supporting the point that it is possible to support a family with a blue collar job. Never said the work itself was easy, but the money comes easy if you’re up for the risks."
unpopularopinion,ffhcirj,t1_ffh90tt,1579929879.0,"Just came here to add on to the blue collar wages statement. My dad and brother both make well over 70k per year with zero college education as mechanics and get great benefits. The job I am working now to get through college you don’t need a degree and it starts at 40k a year .75 raise every 6 months, and room to make up to 65k if you volunteer for over time once a week and work holidays. Typically I only work 3-4 days a week on a 12hr shift.If you stay a few years and move up 1 rank the starting pay for the next tier is 28/hr. The maintenance/mechanics/operators at my place easily make 70-120k per year, the higher end being people that work all the over time they can get. The work is hard not going to lie, but it is still possible to support a family with a blue collar job depending on location. I’m in the rural south and the average house hold brings in about 30k per year so the people I work with typically live very well unless they just have a shit ton of debt."
