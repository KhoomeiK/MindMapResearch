The Cell’s flaw was that it only had one general purpose core, the rest were vector units with their own RAM and developers had to manage sending data to and from the RAM of an SPE.

Nope, Ansible has this and calls it `ansible-pull`, which is essentially pulling your ansible playbooks from a git repo and running them locally. I don't know if Salt has a wrapper like that (though you can also use git) but you can force pull a minion with `salt-call state.apply`.

>I also see salt's ""management bus"" capabilities. I don't foresee myself wanting to run remote commands with cmd.run in salt, but I can see how that might be a nice feature to have. 

Not necessarily command blasting, you can have modules or scripts send or listen to events on the Salt bus, so you can do things like auto-scale when a cluster is under load, or running reports and sending the results to elasticsearch for querying and visualization.

>Also, I also looked a bit into salt's agentless feature, where in reality it is more like a ""SSH in and install a lightweight agent"" feature as opposed to ansible's style.

Ansible does the same thing by sftping up and executing a small runtime, but for the most part Salt prefers a minion and you can encounter weird bugs when going the `salt-ssh` route. I've only used salt-ssh for temporary management of machines and to bootstrap minion installation and upgrades."
