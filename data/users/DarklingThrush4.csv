dogs,fff2uuk,t1_ffezqlc,1579874208.0,"A handful is the important thing to note here... it takes a very special, very specific dog to be able to do IGP with R+ only. I can respect the “few corrections as possible” standpoint. I think that should be everyone’s goal, right? Seems common sense, but then you have clubs like the OP posted and I wonder what people are thinking.

Eta: I’m not saying you’re luring the out with cookies... I’m saying when a dog won’t out and they’re in super high drive, a ball, a cookie, a toy likely isn’t going to be enough (dog dependent of course). You have to have a way to communicate with the dog in that moment. For many, it’s a prong and e collar."
dogs,ffe5yoc,t1_ffe58vk,1579837581.0,"I will say that if you want to do positive reinforcement only, you might have a hard time finding clubs that will be totally on board. Most are going to be strong believers in balanced training due to effectiveness and safety. Don’t let it deter you, because you can do whatever you feel is best for you and your dog, but I would guess there are very few (if any) strictly positive reinforcement IGP3 titled dogs out there. This subreddit is very R+ only, along with the dog training subreddit. If you’re only wanting to do positive reinforcement, you can absolutely still dabble in schutzhund, but you might not ever be as competitive as you’d like. People can bitch at me all they want and say it’s not true, but when you’re working with high drive dogs in a state of high defense and high excitement, cookies aren’t going to save the helpers ass if the dog won’t out."
dogs,ffe4vxd,t1_ffe0xvg,1579836768.0,"Muzzle training is always good regardless of the breed or behavior of the dog. My adult female is aggressive, but I would have muzzle trained her regardless. It is an important skill for a dog to have. If your breeder has a history of breeding aggressive dogs, that’s a breeder I would have stayed away from, however, it looks like you got lucky. If your puppy is showing signs of a stable, confident dog, then you’ve done your homework and keep doing what you’re doing! Schutzhund should not make your dog dangerous. I trust even the most “aggressive” and “reactive” schutzhund dog more than a trust someone’s pet. Remember, schutzhund dogs still have to have their microchips checked and walk through groups at trials. I don’t know what your club is doing to their dogs. Like I said, there are some real asshole schutzhund dogs, but for the most part they *should* be stable dogs. 

I would go to a variety of clubs and observe how they train their dogs rather than just asking. Go and actually meet the people and you’ll quickly learn where you fit in best. In the mean time, since you’re new to the sport, I recommend Dave Kroyer’s videos. It’s $9.00 a month and worth it’s weight in gold. He has a whole section on training and raising your competitive working puppy. It will give you lots to work on with your pup that isn’t protection work and you can do on your own without a club."
dogs,ffdwits,t1_ffd1kxq,1579830676.0,"I’m all for balanced training. I’m all for a prong and a good e-collar. But they are tools used to enhance training. In order for it to work, it has to be fair and your dog MUST understand the correction. Otherwise you’re zapping your dog for nothing. When used correctly, these tools don’t make your dog more aggressive. It’s a communication tool. I find that people who ride horses understand this concept well... just like riders use spurs and a crop, it’s a tool to make communication more effective when needed. I personally haven’t seen an e-collar used to enhance aggression in protection. I’ve seen the prong collar popped before but it shouldn’t be violent. 

The “lighting dogs up” for barking at passerbys, whining and whatever is stupid if you’ve never taught your dog to not do the behavior. Again, back to fairness... you wouldn’t introduce the e-collar until you’re certain the dog knows not to bark or whine. It’s just lazy. My favorite thing about dog training is that so much is fixable. For instance, I hate that my puppy has serious FOMO with my adult female when she’s loose in the house. He screams and jumps and throws a tantrum in his pen. I started working on it and watching him learn the correct behavior is awesome. Now he lays quietly. 

 I also can’t imagine bragging about your aggressive dog with a bite history. The whole point of IGP is to have a stable dog. Sure, there are some challenging ones out there that will get pissy and bite the handler, and they might get far in the sport, but IMO those dogs should not be bred because they technically are not the entire package. 

I also can’t imagine doing corrections on a 4 month old... I have a 12 weeks old and that would bite me in the ass. Even when he’s bitten me hard and I’ve swatted at him, he gets riled up and comes right back. Someone below mentioned a leash pop, which doesn’t really bother me but it would have to be with a flat collar and in a situation where the puppy isn’t panicked... more of a way to get his attention back. Not jerking him off the ground. 

If you’re uncomfortable with this club, I would recommend you find a new one. If you post where you’re located, we might be able to help! Your puppy is 16 weeks old. Is he showing fear? You mention correcting him for being unsure of people and that you’re worried he’ll be aggressive. A lot of that is nature and some nurture. If you didn’t spend a lot of time socializing him up until this point, you’ve missed out on a lot, but it’s not too late. Don’t focus on corrections. We had a very under socialized 16 week old at our club who is much much better after we all spent time hand feeding him treats and just letting him hang around. There’s no need to correct anything. If he’s lunging and growling at people, you would need to seek out a vet behaviorist because that’s a much bigger issue and certainly out of most people’s expertise. Especially because that can turn dangerous. 

You can do as little corrections or as much corrections as you want. There are things some handlers at my club do that I would probably not. There are some things I would do that I’m sure others somewhere wouldn’t. It’s up to you as the handler and what you feel comfortable with. Asking yourself “is this fair?” “Does the dog understand what I am asking?” are good guidelines when making corrections. I would find a new club."

puppy101,ff7csbz,t1_ff7akgs,1579646553.0,"yep. Enforced naps in the crate and separating the puppy when he is pestering the dog. It's your job to protect the older dog from the puppy, just as much as you protect your puppy from older dogs. It's not the older dog's job to sit there and take getting bombarded by a rude puppy. That's not fair to him. If he is growling or shows discomfort, you need to take the puppy away from him. My parents have a long haired fluffy dog and my 11 week old LOVES to try to attack him... He's gotten a few good growls from the adult dog. Lately, I have been focusing on having them go for walks together and I reward the puppy for focusing on me and avoiding the dog. This is the kind of interaction I want. I don't want the puppy in the older dog's face. I don't want the puppy biting the older dog. I want them to coexist peacefully."
puppy101,ff7cbde,t3_es16rz,1579646224.0,"I think it really depends on the dog and the owner tactics. I doubt my puppy is housebroken (11 weeks old), but he's never peed in the house. I take him out every hour or so and he holds it 9 hours at night in his crate. I slowly built him up overnight... I have never given him a reason to potty in the house, so it just hasn't happened. If I let him loose, would he run to the door and ask to go out? No idea and I'm not going to find out. He will run from his pen to the door once I put the leash on and then run like a maniac to the grass when he has to go, so I know he knows that grass means potty. Don't give your puppy a chance to have accidents and they won't happen.....I also taught my puppy to pee and poop on command, so that helps."

I know my puppy can sleep through the night. He has slept 8-9 hours without peeing for a few weeks now. I just started sleeping in another room a few days ago and so far, no crying. I know you’re in an apartment, but if you know the puppy can hold it all night I’d let him cry it out..... otherwise he’s going to keep learning. Can you put him in a room that isn’t bordered by another apartment? A closet or a bathroom and shut the door when he’s screaming?? It sounds a little harsh, but truly if they’re capable of sleeping through the night and he’s just wanting attention, you can’t give it to him."
puppy101,ff3b4wn,t3_ercwqt,1579537736.0,"Personally, I would drop the puppy pads and wake up every few hours to take the puppy out. At 9 weeks, I was taking my 11 pound GSD puppy out every 2.5 hours. I slowly increased the time. At 11 weeks, he now sleeps 8-9 hours in the crate in a different room. The reason I say to ditch the potty pads and work on crate training is because if you maintain a consistent schedule then you will know if your puppy is crying in the middle of the night, it’s not because he needs to go out. You are going to need to start ignoring the crying eventually, or it’ll never work. Crying gets my puppy nowhere. It’s like nails in a chalkboard to me, so I wanted to stop that behavior as fast as possible... but you need to make sure all their needs are met if you ignore them (especially the bathroom)"

I was fortunate enough to find an AMAZING club who was incredibly welcoming and willing to teach me. Most clubs might be standoffish at first because a lot of people come and go and aren’t always serious about doing this sport. Regardless, go to training. Go every week if you can. Learn about the sport. Watch people train. Ask questions! I did this for more than 6 months. I never missed a training day. I finally was fortunate enough to be offered a VERY nice puppy from a breeding I would have never gotten a deposit on if it hadn’t been for my club putting in a good word for me.

Look into local clubs and see what’s around you. Some might be harder to find in your area than others. That’ll make the decision easier for you.

That doesn’t mean you can’t go to the club, bring your dog and get your BH with him! You can learn about the sport, watch others train and see if it’s something you want to do.

I have a 10 week old puppy who has never had an accident before. I initially was VERY diligent with him. Outside every 20-40 minutes unless he was napping. 2 hours in the crate, 1 hour in his pen. All. Day. Long. If you crate train them appropriately, they will not have an accident. Now, 3-4.5 hours is way too long for a puppy this age. The max I’ve ever left my puppy alone is 3 hours and he’s 10 weeks old. He also can hold his pee all night, so I know he’s not suffering trying to hold it. 

Are you able to get a pet sitter or dog walker to break that time up a little until he’s older? That will help a lot with potty training. I would also just start potty training him outside if you can. Talk to your vet about the risk of parvo in your area. You definitely need to crate him when you’re gone during the day if he’s escaping. You should also be crating him at night. It will be unpleasant at first (lots of crying), but if you stick with it and ignore the screams, you’ll have a crate trained dog in no time. 2 weeks into crate training and my puppy no longer cries at night or during the day, and I feel like I have a life back."

There are difficult dogs and there are easy dogs. It’s up to the breeder (if they’re a good breeder) to place the puppies in the right homes. If this is a reputable breeder, they will take the puppy back. Heck, my puppy came up with giardia and Coccidia from my breeder and she offered to take him back completely or take him until he was well again. Instead, I allowed her to pay for his treatment.

Also, how old is your puppy? If your puppy is around 11 weeks, I wouldn't really trust him to give you a signal. He's a baby. Take him out to pee every hour when he is awake.

It doesn’t sound like you crate train your dogs. Personally, crate training is my life saver. Our older female lives in a giant playpen due to injuries, but she wouldn’t have potty accidents anyway. The puppy spends the night in a crate. Last night, he would’ve slept through the night, but I woke him up after 4.5 hours to potty. Then right back to bed. The first few nights were hard because of crying, but he was now stopped. He sleeps in even until 7:30/8. This is a working line European German Shepherd. Definitely not a lazy dog. 

He has a very structured life. 2 hours in the crate one hour out of the crate all day every day. In the one hour he’s out, he potties immediately outside, we do training and then he plays in his playpen. That’s his whole day every day.

puppy101,fcw29tq,t1_fcvy92n,1578015480.0,Lol I do schutzhund (a dog sport). This isn’t my first rodeo with dog training. Just my first time starting from the ground up with a puppy.
puppy101,fcvjovq,t1_fcvj7ne,1578003536.0,"Oh man. Sounds like so much work. Fortunately, I work only 4 hours 3x a week, so I don’t have to deal as much with that. I’m just really looking forward to him growing up haha I don’t know if he’ll sleep all night. I try and get him up when he’s not crying. I feel like he can hold it (he held his pee 6 hours on an airplane), but I don’t want to force him. Maybe at 10 weeks I’ll try all night."
puppy101,fcvihrw,t1_fcvhgib,1578002799.0,"Thank you. I find myself wishing the time goes by quickly, but I’m sure I’ll miss the puppy part at some point... or maybe not lol."
puppy101,fcvien7,t1_fcvhn3d,1578002745.0,"Ugh I feel you in so many levels lol. My plan of attack so far is just keeping him from getting into stuff in the first place. Right now we’re doing 2 hours crated, 1 hour out. I do 15-20 min of training during that hour and then he goes in his pen and plays with his toys. If he cries, I ignore him (making sure Hume has pottied of course). I put him away for a nap and he might fuss a bit, but he settles mostly alright. Not much screaming anymore. Whiny baby noises. He didn’t get his full second nap today and is being a pill out getting some socialization."

k9sports,fcuwdfe,t1_fbweakz,1577989877.0,hahaha sorry. Puppy is kicking my butt.... Puppy tax: https://imgur.com/a/CaA859F
puppy101,fcpamvd,t1_fcp089q,1577856317.0,"He started out quiet tonight. Went in the crate at 9:30 and went right to sleep. We kept him up from 7:30 onward, so he was exhausted. Woke up just now and was restless in his crate, so I took him out in case he had to pee. Let him do is thing outside, didn’t talk to him, and then brought him immediately back to bed. I did put some treats in to get him to walk in himself. He fussed for about 7 minutes and is now back to sleep. Got a good 30 minutes of sleep so far. Haha hoping for more tonight! I think he’s having trouble sleeping all night.  Not because he has to go out, but because he’s not comfortable in the crate, so he wakes up easily and fusses"
puppy101,fcozpw1,t1_fcowwn9,1577846091.0,"He seems pretty good in public. Maybe I’m not good at reading him but he sits and observes everyone walking by and seems pretty content. Not super fussy. Takes food. I think it’s the crying and me not knowing how to help him. And the fact that I haven’t slept in days doesn’t help. I’m so stressed about the crate training and creating separation anxiety having to leave him for 4 hours on Tuesday. I’ve never had a problem with crating, so it’s stressing me out. Even though my logical brain knows it’s only been 24 hours."
puppy101,fcoswpq,t1_fcor9mw,1577840658.0,Oh I just carry him. I don’t let him hit the ground. I talked to my vet today at his appointment and he said our area is low risk and is fine to be carried. Thanks for the other suggestions. I’m freaking out.
AskReddit,fc76p0j,t1_fc6ntvt,1577498992.0,I dream in my non-native language as well. It’s wild.
AskReddit,fc6qwaq,t1_fc6notr,1577487193.0,"Actually, this is kind of wild. I don’t consider myself fully bilingual because I don’t practice conversation enough, but part of my job is translating Spanish to English, so I am highly proficient. I catch myself using Spanish words in my head a lot. If I dream about work, it is typically in Spanish."

AskReddit,fc2omlm,t1_fc27hm0,1577369288.0,Yes! And this is why we didn’t go to my wife’s parents for Christmas. I can’t be around the kids because god forbid they have to explain who I am to them... they’ve threatened us and treated my wife like crap for years. It’s the first year we haven’t gone over and spent the entire day with my family instead. My family treats her like their own. I’m very  lucky and I think my wife had a good Christmas :)
