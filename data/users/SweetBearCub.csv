- Their cars.
- Food on the table.
- Clean clothes on their backs.

If at all possible, when I encounter a homeless person that says that they're hungry or something that a social service organization could help them with, I'll put what I'm doing on hold and either bus or walk them over, and connect them to services.

It was quite sobering one day, when I was near my place coming back home (a supportive housing type of place), when I came across one of the previous case managers on the sidewalk, homeless. (High turnover) He looked very different, and was very down and out. I remember that when I saw him ""at work"", that he looked stuff up in books, and didn't know stuff in the area by heart yet, it seemed. Sure enough, in a quiet/embarassed voice he told me that he had no idea where to go, and that he was too embarrassed to really reach out to anyone who might have known him.

I made sure to hook him up with some resources, and gave him my email address (after mentioning that the public libraries all had free PCs that could be reserved for use). As far as I know, he recovered from his own demons eventually."

You are not the first person to feel this way, but under our current system, you effectively have two viable choices and that's it. Voting for neither of them means that you have essentially thrown your vote away.

Remember that elections have no way to indicate a protest vote, and that is by design.

While you are free to throw your vote away, I urge you not to.

People did this by a huge margin in 2016, and what did it get us? Nothing good. While Hillary was far FAR from my choice, I know in my heart that the country would not be nearly as bad off under her leadership as we are now."

Everyone talks about this like it's fucking brain surgery. As a Linux noob when I started, I needed to edit that file to have my SSD be treated a bit more gently. (Necessary around 2014, not now though)

After googling for the default text editor for my distro and how to edit files as an administrator, I had the proper command put together to open the file for editing. This took less than 5 minutes.

Then, I googled for the proper syntax of commands in the fstab file, and the specific options that I needed. That took maybe another 5 minutes.

But NO officers helped the man who had been shot, letting him lay there and bleed for 20 minutes until an ambulance arrived. This is despite all sworn officers also being trained in basic medic training and having first aid kits in their vehicles."
