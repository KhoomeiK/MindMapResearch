I wouldn't want him spouting his misogynistic views around your children and I daresay that's a major concern for you as well. He's not working full time, so he would be hanging around at your home for the majority of the day, probably disrupting your work in your home office. Would you want to work in an office where someone else had been sleeping and probably fapping? (Sorry to be crude, but if he hasn't got a GF it's either gonna be one off the wrist or the occasional wet dream, that's just how men's bits work and keep themselves healthy).

Right now, you're not sexually attractive to women, even if you are good-looking. You have a bad attitude towards women if you see them as commodities to be handed out by the government. Women are people with wants, desires, hopes, dreams, talents, ambitions, opinions, likes and dislikes - just the same as men. Women have agency and can choose for themselves who they are friends with, or who they want to pursue a romantic relationship with - just the same as men. You don't view women in this way if you feel you ""deserve"" a woman, and you believe the government should issue you with one. That is Incel-like thinking, which is toxic and will never make you attractive to women.
