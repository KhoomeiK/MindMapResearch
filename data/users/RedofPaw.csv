worldnews,ffeyuw8,t1_ffevazw,1579870772.0,"We almost did. At one point humans were down to a few thousand, and apparently there is less genetic diversity among every human on earth than between certain troops of chimps that live close to each other (or so is my recollection).

But we have a degree of progress that no other creatures have ever managed to achieve. We can survive in pretty much every environment we have encountered to one degree or another. Indeed if you were to put a well enough prepared human at any stage of history we would be able to survive. 

Runaway greenhouse? Very bad. We'd end up with half the world uninhabitable desert. But there would be sustainable environments towards the poles. It would be devastating, but not so quickly that we would all die off. 

Life has existed on earth for billions of years, and while there have been mass extinctions our ancestors survived them all. They were lucky enough to be able to adapt to those specific conditions at the time. We have the advantage of being able to adapt without the need for natural selection. 

Yes, there are known disasters that could reduce our numbers - but nothing that would wipe us all out. There are no large space rocks that we can see that are likely to cause a worldwide extinction event - and if there was we would have time to perhaps nudge it's path enough to avoid collision. 

Nuclear War would be bad. Really, really bad. It would end our civilisation for sure. But it wouldn't end the species. We would be able to survive. Radiation is bad, but it won't kill everyone. There would be areas that are simply not important enough to bomb and would still have humans remaining.

An engineered virus might have a shot at wiping us out. But as of yet we have not encountered a virus that is both capable of infecting easily, or wide spread enough, that we cannot contain it, nor one that has literally no way to combat. Likely some people would also have an immunity. But even if there was none, we could take drastic measures to ensure quarantine. 

In the future there may well be a rock big enough to wipe us out, or a technology that could destroy the entire planet, or grey goo or whatever that we have no chance against. Which is probably why we need to ensure we have outposts away from earth. Space is really big, and really scary and we are in no way capable of living out there currently. The true risk is that we are not able to do so before the Big One happens."

It sucks to have someone dislike your game for not being something they subjectively would want it to be, or for a seemingly ridiculous reason. Certainly having it listed as a 'hard platformer' and the review criticising it for being as advertised is a bit silly, and frustrating. 

Then again they may be simply poor at communicating what they mean. Maybe they like a challenge and thought they'd try your game, but rather than just 'hard' they found it to be unfair. 

But even if they are just being unreasonable these sorts of reviews are just a reality and you shouldn't take them to heart. Best to take pride in the good ones and seek out constructive criticism in the negative ones, so that it can be fixed, or your next title is better. 

People checking out a game will read a few good reviews as well as poor and will notice when the reviewer is being unfair, or if their comments lack any substance. ""It's crap"" is probably going to be ignored. ""It's got horrible bugs"" won't be. But equally ""This game is great!

relationships,ffcd16a,t1_ffc8xag,1579796816.0,"Money is always difficult with families. But there is really no reason for you to lose out.

You and your mother are going to move out of your home to give your sister a property for her family. That seems very nice of you to be so accommodating. In most families these assets would pass to your mother and not to a child, who them moves in while the rest of the family have to go somewhere else. When the other parent was to pass then it's at that stage assets would get split - and likely require selling of properties to ensure such a split is fair.

It's entirely reasonable for you to feel that the situation is not fair for your sister - for whom you have agreed to leave your home - is getting more than her fair share.

You don't want your mother to feel bad, and you don't want to seem like you are 'greedy'. It can feel like saying to a parent ""when you die I want more cash"", and completely understandable that you would not want to engage with it. You got supported, which is great. But I am sure that support was equally open to your sister.

Your sister has a 'future' family to support? What about YOUR family? You might not even want one right now, but you also might do eventually. Your sister is getting there 'first' - just like she was born 'first' - but there's no reason why that should entitle her to more than she is already getting - which is more than you are.

If your parents were estranged from you and simply felt you didn't have a right to an inheritance then that would be one thing, but it sounds like you are all on great terms. 

You should speak to your mother and explain to her your feelings. Let her know that of COURSE the choice is hers - she can do whatever she likes - but the situation doesn't seem equal. There's absolutely no reason not to discuss it at this time - she's hopefully going to live for a very long time yet. 

But in the future, whenever it is she does pass, you may find you are in financial difficulty which that money could help alleviate. Perhaps you have had a child and could put that money towards their college, or other future costs. You may find it necessary at the time to bring the issue up with your sister and explain that it would only be fair to have more of the share. That conversation would be MUCH harder and more awkward than the one you are considering having with your mother now.

If she is reasonable - even if that means the situation remains the same - then at least you can put it to rest and move on. If she agrees with you and seeks a solution then it can also be put to rest, with added security for the future. 

If you ignore the issue for want of it not being awkward to speak about - or to not look 'greedy' or something - then it will only create potential feelings of animosity. Probably not enough to cause arguments, but enough to cause you discomfort that might not ever pass."

StarWarsLeaks,ffbx9oy,t1_ffbqz68,1579785750.0,"The problem with Finn is that while in the first movie he picks up a lightsaber and tries to fight Kylo he fails to defeat him. Yes, he was heroic, and he contributed, but he failed. 

In Last Jedi he fails at everything he sets out to do. He fails to sneak off the ship. He fails to get to the hacker. He fails to infiltrate Snoke's ship and in a final injustice he fails to sacrifice himself to save the day. At the end he sort of... limps off with the rest of everyone having achieved nothing. He sort of learns that he needs to be more of a team player, rather than just hang out with Rey? I guess?

Rose is more proactive and successful. She had motivation - against inequality and injustice, and even though they fail their mission she seems super happy just to save some horses. Then she comes along and saves finn who most likely would have just got fried by the big laser. 

Poe got more of an arc than Finn. He learns that just flying off and being a hero isn't enough. He needed to be a leader as well. 

Finn needed a win at the end - and all this would have been fine if he'd had any sort of arc in TROS. He had none. He just went after Rey the whole time again. Then some other rebel storm troopers turn up so he hangs around with them until the end of the movie, destroying things he hates. He did get that whole ""Hey Rey, I'm actually force sensitive, but... oh we gotta do something else? Okay, but I'll tell you later? No... you'll be busy then as well? Okay... maybe the next movie?
