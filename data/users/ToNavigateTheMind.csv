I imagine them on the scale of the Divine Beasts, that one climb on, but also inside of, with all kinds of interesting mechanical puzzles on the interior and exterior."

The simplest answer tends to be the right one.  She's an MSNBC anchor from New York.  She clearly uses a long A sound as in Lakers.

Ah, she's probably just a secret white supremacist."

No cap."

BlackPeopleTwitter,ffqmder,t1_ffqllfs,1580138441.0,Let's see you do your job absolutely perfectly 100% of the time in front of cameras broadcasting live while you improvise after an unexpected tragedy.
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffqeno5,t3_eunywv,1580132324.0,This is reasonable.  I can accept this.

BlackPeopleTwitter,ffjifvn,t3_etzbkn,1579998930.0,The government demands you pay all applicable fees at regular intervals for the right to use their picture of you to identify yourself.
StarWars,ffhdrh6,t3_ete8jn,1579931147.0,"Why does this hit you hard?

The prequels don't show Anakin being a great pilot.  Everything he does in The Phantom Menace is presented as a silly accident, and we don't even see Anakin pilot a starfighter or any ship in Attack of The Clones.  In fact, Obi-Wan doesn't witness Anakin pilot a ship at all until the third movie.

Was Anakin a cunning warrior?  In AoTC, Obi-Wan spends the whole first act and climax frustrated with Anakin's rash behavior, questioning his methods and instincts, and basically talking to Anakin like he's a child.

Were they good friends?  I don't know.  We're told about some adventures, but we don't actually see much, do we?

Prequels are pretty bad.

EDIT: Don't downvote if you can't bother to offer any refutation to any of the points I make above."

GetMotivated,ffgtikm,t1_ffgmk20,1579914668.0,"Firstly, this is a false dichotomy.  The notion that a person is either rich (whatever that means) or trying to get rich, or else is a ""being little bitch"" as you so eloquently put it, is nonsense.

Secondly, having monetary wealth is no guarantee of a good life.  Conversely, one does not need to be wealthy to have a happy, healthy, and satisfying life.

Lastly, this sub is not necessarily about getting motivated to acquire resources.  It may be for someone... But someone else may simply need motivation to get out of bed in the morning.  Someone may need motivation to make a major change in their situation.  Someone may need motivation to create something, follow their dream, or connect more deeply with another human being.  Someone may need motivation to stay alive...

It's worth acknowledging that some people, despite being rich themselves, may need that same motivation.  Money cannot buy strength of will.

This sub is about perseverance and making incremental, positive change in the face of doubt and adversity, large or small.

Suggesting that one must possess monetary wealth in order to avoid living like a ""bitch"" is repugnant."
