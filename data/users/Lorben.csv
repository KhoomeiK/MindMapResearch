talesfromtechsupport,fgp8v21,t1_fgotjhu,1580999679.0,"Google's email can be used for medical data, but not by default.  It's not the servers, it's the service.  The encryption that Gmail has is basic TLS which is not HIPPA compliant.  

By paying for G Suite and entering into a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with Google extra protections are put on the data you are storing on Google's servers.

That just protects the information being stored on the server.  That still does not mean you can send protected health information (PHI) through email to another outside organization once you have G Suite and a BAA.  You still need encryption (good encryption, not TLS) put on the message, which does not come with stock G Suite.  Google Apps Message Encryption can be purchased for G Suite at an additional cost or you can use a HIPPA compliant 3rd party encryption service.

Online fax services that can be used to send PHI would also have to have the appropriate encryption and a BAA.  Otherwise it's not legal.  That doesn't help if the fax destination is a regular fax machine since that has to go through the regular telephone system to reach the fax machine and has all the security problems that basic fax machines have.

The medical industry in general is trying to move away from fax for other more secure options, but small clinics and private practices are not able to afford the fancier more secure transmission methods."

patientgamers,fffb9iz,t1_fff70ua,1579880154.0,"I finished my first playthrough of Dark Souls last weekend.

What helped me the most is figuring out that an enemy's giant wind up time is not there to show you when to dodge, but in what direction you should dodge.  If you try to do a reactive dodge when the wind up starts you'll probably get your shit smacked.  If you weren't paying attention and dodged in the wrong direction for the animation being used you'll still get your shit smacked.  Which is the opposite of what most games have taught me about how to react to the start of an attack animation.

Also the weapons you get as you progress though the game are not necessarily better, they're just different.  It's not a linear progression as you would find in most RPGs where weapons get stronger as you progress.  Find a weapon you're comfortable with using, upgrade it, and stick with it.  The ability to correctly gauge the stamina use, range, and swing time is more valuable than any stat.  You'll only gain that through practice.  I ended up using the standard halberd for 90% of the game, up to and including the last boss."

If you assume that Steam's periodic hardware survey's are an accurate reflection of people using it (which I can't confirm but it's still the best I could find), that would put 50-60 million PCs in the range of current gen consoles.
