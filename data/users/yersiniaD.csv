It's ok not to feel sorry for someone whose poor choices caused their own death along with others's suffering. The fact that you're wondering means you may expect to feel something, or that you feel expected by others to feel something: that in itself is empathy. I imagine you'd wish his life had been different, better: that is empathy, too. Perhaps you sympathize with his family, for losing someone dear. Maybe all of it seems small in comparison to the real-world havoc this person created, and that's fine too. He made the world less safe, and though he has probably already been replaced, it's normal for your biggest emotion is to be glad that he can't hurt anyone else."
