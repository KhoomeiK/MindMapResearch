The skin of lamb that you wear, and the silvery surface of what can only be an iced over lake. Beware out there my friend of the cold! Keep that beast safe, and the same she shall do for thee! The laptop... How do you get WiFi upon the snowy steppes?

Sorry, I've been reading a lot of fantasy lately. 

Cute kitty."
headphones,ffaql86,t1_f9h9ymy,1579742177.0,"Yes. They are definitely not for fans of high end. Although, if you equalize them just a bit, it's worth it because everything else sounds great."

headphones,ff4mfcy,t3_erm5bj,1579567147.0,"So these things are CLEAR.  Everything is crystalline. I haven't listened to them for long, just a test run really, with a flat EQ. I tried out some Pink Floyd, Deftones, Wintersleep and Leprous; old prog rock, heavy rock, indie rock and brand new prog rock. I'll definitely tinker with the sound, although Leprous fit perfectly without adjusting the equalizer. 

The highs were amazing. Maybe a bit too strong, but super vibrant. 

The imaging was really good. The soundstage wasn't very large, but they are closed back. 

Comfort level will probably be an issue. They don't clamp too hard, but they sit on my ears. I'm sure they'll begin to hurt after awhile. 

They are beautiful though. I don't normally like brown, but they really look classy. They feel sturdy and light. 

Really though, if I was impressed by one thing, it was the clarity. It's really impressive. Every little thing can be heard, and I've got some tinnitus. 

Me likes!"

Maybe we're an experiment? It's the talk of the town, so to speak. Everyone is a little paranoid. And after hearing that report on NPR, I'm doubly concerned. It makes sense though. FedEx is way more concerned about profit than service these days. The company has gotten sloppy. The guy on the radio even mentioned that.

Snare, tom tom, floor tom, hi hat and one cracked ride cymbal. I had no idea what to do. I asked my older sister's boyfriend, who was really into music, who the best  drummer in the world was.
