Android,fdrkgua,t1_fdosfca,1578685731.0,"Especially since all of the fancy things you could accomplish with Soli, like changing songs or silencing/snoozing alarms without touching your phone, can also be done using the Google Assistant that's already included in the software.

So instead of utilizing proven hardware that has been manufactured for years (and the lower manufacturing costs associated with it) they used a brand new sensor that wasn't proven (which probably had higher manufacturing costs as well) but also which does nothing the phone couldn't already do."
Android,fdrin1y,t1_fdrge3i,1578685099.0,"I've never purchased outside of Google but I can only assume you'd have to deal with wherever you bought it from for warranty claims. Also, it's so much cheaper because Google inflates the MSRP of their flagships and then has aggressive sales and promotions that get the phone down closer to around where its price should've been in the first place. Many reviewers called Pixel 4xl, starting at $900, a hard sell but get that number down below $700 and all of a sudden it seems more worth it."
GooglePixel,fdqqdwo,t1_fdqiz91,1578672636.0,"There was a recent post on r/TIFU about a guy who took a funny engagement announcement photo that was him nude with his fiancee's hand with the ring on it covering his private parts. Apparently the picture was taken right as she placed her hand because the start of the motion photo was a dick pic. And he sent it to family as well. I'll add a link to the post if I can find it.

Edit: [Here's the post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ej2zcz/tifu_by_informing_my_family_i_was_engaged_with_a/) I mixed it up a bit though. The live photo showed what was behind his fiancee's hand after she took the pic and moved her hand away."
GooglePixel,fdni66n,t1_fdnh8ni,1578586315.0,I certainly hope so. I love the Pixel UI and have even gone back to my Pixel 2xl over my newer OnePlus 6t to be able to use those features but even I can't overlook the missteps and cut corners. Any one little misstep is not enough by itself but when you add them all up I can't help but feel like the devices in the Pixel 4 line were upper mid range devices trying to disguise themselves as flagships.
GooglePixel,fdnfwpm,t1_fdn0qfk,1578584950.0,"Yeah I do a lot of backing up of the files on my phone and this is just another corner cut with Pixels that irritated me. Pixel 1 and 2 were sure winners for best pictures but other OEMs have all but caught up with Pixel on that. Between picture/video quality, screen, battery, RAM, storage size and capabilities, SoC, and random other hardware choices etc. the other flagship OEMs have either caught up or surpassed Pixel so the strongest selling point of the Pixel is the UI but that alone isn't enough of a justification for the MSRP in my opinion. I understand that to maximize profit your try to sell something for the highest price you can but there was no justification for the Pixel 4 line to be priced as it was. While I don't like Samsung's UI, at least you feel like you're getting what you paid for when you get one of their flagships at original MSRP and then it just feels like a stall if you get one on sale. The Pixel 4's just felt overpriced from the beginning and only felt worth the price when they were $200 off for Black Friday."
GooglePixel,fdne5kl,t1_fdn6bng,1578583877.0,Yeah I would've bought a Pixel 4 if it had the same Pixel 4 back but the front screen of the 4a. I'd assume it would have an in-screen fingerprint reader because there isn't one on the back of the Pixel 4 line. I do like the reader on the back but in-screen isn't terrible and is undoubtedly less costly than a brand new sensor like Soli that agreed next to no utility because everything you could do with some can be accomplished with the Google Assistant that's already included.
GooglePixel,fdndtpi,t1_fdnbe6c,1578583675.0,"I really don't understand what Google is doing with their flagships relative to their mid range devices. It's like high fashion where everything looks more outlandish than normal clothes and it costs 5x as much.

The design of the 4a with a better and higher refresh rate screen, dual cameras on the back, with better SoC, wireless charging, bigger battery, and better RAM would've been great for the regular Pixel 4 line. Instead they force feed trendy hardware like Soli which added next to no utility while only adding cost or glass backs which are both more expensive and less durable than plastic just because it looks better while also taking away features like the 3.5mm jack.

The 3a and 4a lines show that Google is more than aware of what people want when it comes to a smart phone but for some reason they don't project that onto their flagships, or at least don't project that methodology as much as they do on the ""a"" releases."

WTF,fdl2bwv,t1_fdksdyq,1578515856.0,"Coating? I work in the label industry and this cardstock might be over laminated (it probably is over laminated but I say ""might"" because the companies I've worked for have never had a hand in the manufacturing of these types of boxes) but it's not like that would add much rigidity or durability. If over laminated at all, something like this would probably be only about 1 or 1.5 MIL. Just think of how easy it is to fold a toothpaste box. In order to get a noticeable boost to rigidity and durability you're looking for an over laminate of about 10 MIL or so. In this case the cover weight of the cardstock itself would do tons more for durability and rigidity than if the cardstock was over laminated or not."

RedditWritesTheOffice,fdjy1qi,t1_fdjrnad,1578491067.0,"Agreed. Here's a scene I came up with over morning coffee. 

Scene takes place at Dwight's wedding.

*Dwight walks up to Jim*

Dwight: Thank you for inviting Michael. To express my gratitude I hereby formally forgive you for exactly one of the numerous wrongdoings you have committed against me and instead will do no more than three favors for you dependent upon effort and cost required.

Jim: Well for my first favor could you get some more traditionally themed hors d'oeuvres in here?

Dwight: Hors d'oeuvres? We didn't prepare any hors d'oeuvres. We slaughtered two goats just for today. Why would I want you to spoil that meal?

Jim: All I know is that those whole grain cake pops were incredibly dry and left a lot to be desired. You didn't even give us a stick to hold them with.

*Dwight, confused, looks at Jim as Michael walks up chewing*

Michael: Hey, what is this? Fudge? It's very rustic.

Jim: No, I think those are the whole grain cake pops. I had one earlier. Kinda dry.

Dwight: Those are manure bombs and while we Schrute's have resorted to consuming them in times of drought I would not recommend it.

*Jim looks at camera while Michael spits out the manure bomb*

Dwight: We pack the manure into easy to handle spheres and dry them out. During the spring we place one with every beet seed we plant. This method has allowed the Schrute's to plant only beets for centuries without needing to rotate in any inferior crops to replenish nutrients in the fields.

Jim: And why are there serving plates full of them on that table?

*Jim points to a table full of serving plates of manure bombs while Michael is still shocked with mouth agape*

Dwight: Jim, that table is over 500 years old. I can't just have manure rolling around on top of it. It would ruin the finish and the company who made that varnish went out of business over 200 years ago.

Jim: Why do you need to have them on a table in the first place?

Dwight: The area of that corner of the barn at waist level has the best air flow to dry them out.

*Jim walks away looking at the camera while Michael still just stands there mouth agape and Dwight looks confused that they don't understand his logic*"

Android,fdh8uln,t1_fdg3v45,1578417894.0,"I wish they would throw more things at the wall that follows the ""a"" line of Pixels because this is the second year now that the ""a"" line looked more aesthetically pleasing than it's corresponding regular Pixel. If the Pixel 4 would've nixed Soli completely and followed this design but with the more advanced camera module on the back I would've probably bought it. Soli is borderline useless to me because everything touted as a feature, like switching songs or snoozing alarms without touching your phone, can already be accomplished with the Google Assistant. It's a complete gimmick that only added extra cost to a device that was already a bit overpriced.

Android,fdeo8vs,t1_fdenspo,1578343180.0,"Same here. I had the G-1, Nexus 1, and MyTouch4g from HTC and I've only had a Note 2 and a Note 8 from Samsung.

DestinyTheGame,fden96g,t1_fdemkgd,1578342595.0,"Yeah I didn't think of that. I also keep the weapons on my main character just to run through the bounties quickly but it just makes it seem so chore-like. I think they need to rework the bounties a bit. Maybe make more weekly bounties and only have daily bounties for activities (strikes, gambit, crucible) or locations (different planets) that would rotate every daily reset. And maybe make it so the rotating daily bounties, along with whatever seasonal bounties, are double XP to give them importance but while also giving some variance to them. I have no idea but as I mentioned in a different comment, the bounty system as it currently is already feels way to much like daily chores and little to no day to day variation between the bounties makes it even worse. Something needs to change."
Android,fdefkbe,t1_fde4631,1578337937.0,"This is what irritates me so much about the Pixel 4 release. For the Pixel 1 and 2 it was pretty much no contest that Pixel had the best camera. Now the other major OEMs have caught up and are at least comparable to Pixel's picture taking abilities to the point that it comes down to personal preference more than anything but those same OEMs are light-years ahead of Pixel when it comes to video recording. While it may be enough for some people, the UI alone isn't enough of a justification for the price of the Pixels when so many corners were cut but not reflected in the MSRP.

Edit: autocorrect"
Android,fdef3vs,t1_fde2fqg,1578337651.0,"Yup. The first Android was an HTC (called the G-1 in America and I think the Dream internationally) and they were pretty successful up until the One line. And then you had the Motorola Droid line as well. Both are nowhere near as prominent as they were 8-9 ish years ago, which is a shame. In order to drive innovation you need meaningful competition but no one can compete with Samsung's hardware. If their software was better I'd be all over them but it's too much for me. I actually enjoyed both Motorola's and HTC's UI from back in the day a lot more than Samsung's so it always saddens me a little bit more each time I read an article like this."

AdviceAnimals,fcxbvjt,t1_fcwyzs8,1578058634.0,My favorites are the ones who never consistently follow the posted speed limit.

Where is the logic there? If you constantly drive 5 mph over or under the speed limit then you're at least being consistent but the people who just seem to be randomly following whatever speed limit they want confuse the hell out of me.
politics,fcx6d6m,t1_fcwhpo3,1578053085.0,There is consistency but only in that they have no issue being completely hypocritical in their unwavering support of republican actions and policies.
