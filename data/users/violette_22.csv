Dogs live in the moment, once they get used to something then they easily adjust. Also, it's a survival instinct to duck from things going over one's head, many people do it as well. Don't dwell in the dog's past, just take good care of him now, have a vet look into the injuries. No matter how the injuries camee about, don't neglect their health care."

He taught me how to hold it, with fingers wrapped around in opposite directions to get a good wack in if needed, and the bright light can be blinding too, like the police do when they stop people at night. 

Let your neighbors know to not hesitate to alert the police if they hear you scream. Let your co-workers, friends, classmates and anyone else you know day-to-day of the situation. People are more apt to help if they understand. Don't be embarrassed. Everyone knows someone or about someone that's been hurt in a similar way."
GenderCritical,ffeq1x9,t3_et4r6a,1579859782.0,"I've long suspected that a significant amount of younger people falling into the trans ideology are doing so as a cope. I see a lot of it as trying to avoid being either a victim or a monster, especially when someone claims the non-binary gender status. I once had a patient that had de-transitioned, and out of curiosity, we asked why. They said that it wasn't really a gender issue, it was a spiritual one. That had some profound impact on how I see people identifying with the trans movement. Of course, this would not apply to absolutely everyone, but a vast majority. When I see someone struggle with these things, I too feel sorry for them. It's as if they are suffering, and the support they find is doing more harm than good. Often, people will align with what feels familiar to them, and not as often what actually benefits them."
GenderCritical,ffepbwp,t3_et5oxq,1579858679.0,"I work in healthcare as well, it's not uncommon for some patient populations to ask for female nurses. The one that really stands out in my mind was a homeless man. He had been sexually abused by men while living on the streets and became distraught around male care givers. He did get better, and was able to leave the hospital, but it just goes to show that many different people will have different reasons for their requests. The men on staff were very sympathetic to his requests, none of them insisted on injecting themselves into his care if it was avoidable. I'm thankful for my working environment.

My brother is a male nurse, and I know he's dismissed some of his female colleagues from caring from abusive male patients, and told me about some of the chats he's had with those men about how abusing the female nursing staff will absolutely not be tolerated. I'm so happy I know so many male care givers that follow this practice as well."

GenderCritical,ff5mxaa,t3_erfbtr,1579600921.0,"Yeah.... I'm a doll collector and I'm familiar with these dolls. They are hugely popular in Asian countries. It's more taboo in some regions to speak against sexual abuse of little girls than to be an abuser. 

I'm sure they would never be banned in the US. That will only result in a bunch of men passionately debating what a girl's body looks like verses a grown woman's.

I don't blame countries seizing them in customs. Many things are banned from import. Good, and I hope it gives authorities reason to search for child pornography. They will probably seize a lot."
GenderCritical,ff5k0x7,t3_erq7c5,1579596546.0,"I'm not sure I'm a very good feminist really. I'm not even sure there is a universal definition of romance. Different people need different things to feel loved. On the other side of the coin, different people express love differently. Trust and love change and grow over time as well. 

It's probably best to know yourself and love yourself before anyone can have a healthy relationship. 

So, I don't think there is a cookie cutter approach to being romantically involved as a radical feminist. It's better having healthy relationships and a strong sense of self-worth and self-love."

There's things I need to know and do for the sake of safety, comfort, hygiene and physical wellness that no man should ever need to do, but it's not so much a choice as it is habit and instincts. I wish I didn't need to take these steps, but the risks in neglecting them are too great.
