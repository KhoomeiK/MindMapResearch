""For all the shit the ACC gets, since 2006 the sec has won 9 national championships with 4 different schools. The ACC has won 3 with 2 different schools (both beating sec teams). B1G has won one. Big 12 and pac 12 have zero.""

You literally chose the year AFTER A BIG 12 TEAM WON THE NATTY so that this state would look as bad as possible for the Big 12. Clearly you have an ax to grind.

Also, the OU Georgia Semifinal game was as close as a game can get. Trying to say that the OU team didn't deserve to be in the playoff is just idiotic.

You've made so many terrible points in this post I can't even begin to address them all, so I'm just going to stop here.

Remember when OU beat Bama in the 2014 sugar bowl?

Remember when Texas beat Georgia last year?

Remember when Big 12 teams had a winning bowl record and a winning record against SEC teams in bowls last year?

Also, Florida blows. You are consistently a mediocre SEC team and the only thing you have to hang onto is counting your quality losses each year. Your team consistently puts in mediocre results and the only thing that makes you feel better is talking about how great the teams were that beat you. You scream about how great Bama, LSU and Georgia are like a cuck goes on and on about the bull that fucks his wife. Have fun being 4th or 5th best in your conference year in and out."

CFB,fcoy65m,t1_fcou8ax,1577844836.0,"No, they didn't lol. A lot of people joke about them ""winning"" the natty when they went undefeated and didn't make the playoff and then beat a good AUburn team in a NY6 bowl."

nextfuckinglevel,fcokv5w,t1_fcmqssd,1577834784.0,Are you seriously trying to claim that every defensive gun use was in an attempt to stop a mass shooter?
PoliticalHumor,fcokoww,t1_fcojinn,1577834657.0,"You are being willfully obtuse. He explained how there is lessening upward mobility in the post you replied too. You just missed it.

He presented the fact that ""For children born in the 1940s, more than 90 percent were earning more than their parents. Today, that number has dropped to 50 percent. The figure below documents that decline.""

To which you replied ""half of folks are making more than their parents? Cool?""

With an OUNCE of critical thinking, you would arrive at the conclusion that a shift from 90% earning more than their parents to only 50% is a definitive decline in upward mobility. 

Your second question ""...how is there not upward mobility now? It's, almost, never been easier to find investors/capital/etc. and pursue your own business idea."" is quite silly if you actually even read is his post. 

In reference to upwards mobility, He CLEARLY states ""There's just way less than before"". He never asserted that there isn't ANY upwards mobility so shifting the goalposts and trying to force him to answer ""how there is not upward mobility"" is a cheap tactic.


In summation: A shift from 90% earning more than their parents to 50% shows a clear decrease in upward mobility. He also never said upwards mobility doesn't exist, only that it has significantly declined as shown in the previous statistic. 


Either you didn't clearly read anything he wrote or you word vomited an extremely poor argument."

You really are trying to make a ridiculous argument."

They aren't even remotely the same shape. You really are just looking for anything to latch on to here."
