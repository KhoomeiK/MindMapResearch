The Thai trip was *exactly* what I needed at the time I took it, but it was definitely not a cultural trip as the islands in question were in a national park and were pretty much purely for tourists/residents employed to serve the tourists. That trip was about nature and relaxation. In stark contrast, I had a long weekend in Rome a few years prior, blasting round all of the top cultural sites at quick marching pace.

Then I realized that industry is bad for your soul, so I quit and bought a bar to run instead. I also made the resolution to not lie or cheat people ever again. I had always had this principle in my personal relationships but I'd allowed money/greed/sales training to erode it totally in my professional life, and it felt bad.

Now I'm as honest as I possibly can be, I hate to lie if I can at all avoid it.

Even if the evergreens do as you say (and I'd like a citation/source please), that will only be in the short term i.e. if you're growing evergreens on a piece of land that has never had evergreens grown on it and is naturally very high in carbon, then maybe evergreens will release that in the short term.

If you leave them growing though, they will go through their natural life cycle and die or be burned down by a forest fire. Either way, this is net carbon negative as there is still carbon in the dead wood or ash left behind. That dead wood and ash is broken down to form the humus element of the soil.

You could literally grow any type of forest on any piece of land and just burn it down when it gets mature and, so long as you keep on doing it, it will be a net carbon negative activity.
