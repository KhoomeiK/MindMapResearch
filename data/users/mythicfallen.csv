But quite often on here you see those who didn't have a relationship when they were younger and as they got older it got it get harder to be in a relationship when that person finds out you have never dated anyone before it puts that thought in there mind that there must be something seriously wrong with you. Just my opinion but like I said earlier you do you, and maybe you won't have that problem."
lonely,fej2oyu,t3_epec1f,1579154667.0,"Wow, that is one hell of a coincidence,  I haven't been sleeping for like a week now.  Turning 30 isnt so bad I did so last year. Unless of course the reason you are dreading turning 30 is due to some preconceived notion of where you are supposed to be at this point in your life.  I too had that feeling last year for a little while and it will probably happen every so often for the rest of my life, but I just try to not think about it or focus on doing something I enjoy/distracts me so I can forget it for a while even though there is absolutely nothing I could do in this world to ever has any hope of achieving what i dream of.  So if you are looking for someone to climb in that hole with a stick of dynamite count me in.

Sorry for the long, convoluted, most likely nonsense post"

gaming,fe32zcu,t1_fe304mw,1578845421.0,MxR a youtuber that basically does reaction videos but used to make skyrim mod videos. Has been essentially extorted by a company called Jukin Media saying they are using their copyrighted material and charges 1500 for every use and is threatening to completely shut down his channel.
TheExpanse,fe09aau,t1_fdzy7sp,1578806663.0,"I don't think it really that they doint appeal to many folks.  For me I used to watch the syfy channel all the time but now on cable to have to be able to watch it when its on. Say 7pm on a friday is when the episode airs but you are busy so can't watch it then either you gotta stay up later to watch it that night or wait till next week at 6pm to watch the previous episode and the new episode. Basically syfy would do a hell of a lot better in the viewership department if the viewer didnt have to work their schedule around the show, which is why streaming does so well these days.

Also Happy Cake day"
