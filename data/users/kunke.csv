synthdiy,ffbtcwv,t3_esiv2u,1579782024.0,Other than the wifi ability youre almost better off getting a nice midi->CV/gate adapter and sending midi clock via your DAW. I have a single cable coming from a CV.OCD to a Make Noise Tempi to keep everything synchronized. Though I recommend the Mutant Brain over the CV.OCD
MaxMSP,ff57t1b,t3_dywkev,1579582751.0,"There aren't any for the most recent version unless you torrent live 10.1 and use M4L, which has some limitations that will probably effect what you can do for school. You could use Purr-Data, which is similar and free though.

Should you torrent Live 10 be aware than many torrents have malware.

Max can be purchased for a year with an academic discount at $69 I believe, or $10/month regularly. If you intend to use it for school exclusively, i can see the moral glayness in piracy, otherwise, please pay for what you use if you want to see it grow and get better."
vcvrack,ff3c095,t3_er1jj2,1579538176.0,Was this sequenced externally with another DAW?
synthesizers,fet6uh4,t1_fet40qu,1579372314.0,"Hmm, nifty. I think it's interesting how many methods there are for this- from granular sustain like Plus Pedal to frozen reverb and hardware solutions like yours. While I probably wont buy one (I already own a plus Pedal) I massively appreciate people trying to lower the cost barrier to entry and making new sounds more widly available. I would totally buy a device like what you showed in the video though. That sounds so good!"
synthesizers,fet2lhp,t1_fesqrf4,1579371262.0,"Honestly, the price you have it at is a steal. Assuming most people dont have a all the equipment (soldering iron, probably a scope to check signals are all good) yours is considerably cheaper than what other's could make it for. I did notice yours is hand held instead of mounted near the pickups, which I'm not sure I prefer? Why'd you go that route?"
bulletjournal,fesmg9v,t1_feg0ara,1579366784.0,Very nice. I work out with 10lb barbels so youve lost more than what I use to workout!
synthesizers,fesm1e9,t1_fesippr,1579366660.0,"Of course. I just saw the de-capped piezzo buzzers and assumed it's mostly the same, though I could totally see someone making much better feedback circitcy for driving them. Clearly getting a patent is a super expensive and time consuming process, and not one you take lightly, but I do hope you considered open sourcing your tech first. More often than not open source hardware wont negivitivly impact sales as the people willing to go though the pain of DIY are doing so because they simply couldn't afford it otherwise, so you could still very easily sell your product. That, and your design I can only assume is still based on that common sustainer design I alluded to. Then again, I do see the fear you'll wind up like Mutable Instruments where nobody buys the original.

All of that aside, this project is truly amazing and I may well try my hand at building something similar soon! Thank you for showing this off!"
bulletjournal,fes8xre,t1_fcia5rn,1579362674.0,"So I tried printing the hexagon one and hoboy did my printer warp it, and the hexagons all have a fair bit of rounding. I think Im going to have to have someone print it for me :("
synthesizers,fes8gtg,t1_fcvj1q0,1579362525.0,"Im not trying to be rude, but, how do you have a patent pending? That looks like a guitar sustainer I can find on instructables?"

bulletjournal,fefwk4l,t3_eom21t,1579067541.0,"Logging weight (if that's what i think Im seeing) more than monthly is pretty much irrelevant, as a good poop will skew results, as will eating/drinking. My recommendation is to have an 'ate healthy' and 'worked out' box, and not even bother tracking your weight as a direct stat.

Also, same with the crappy sleep habits. Best of luck in working on that!

Over all love this idea!"
furry,fedkjyd,t1_fed7b6r,1579013830.0,"To be fair, ive used MIDI devices as generic input devices/controllers, so it's not too absurd. I really want to make my MIDI drums trigger autosploit to run or something now though"

""FOUR!""

""O""

'O'

The 'O' of one, more of an 'uh' hung in the air, sustained as if put through an infinite plate reverb, and honestly the 'uh' had to be the perfect sound to accompany the situation as everything froze. A customer-service-y voice in my head asked. ""Would you like to reset to the last checkpoint and keep your progress?""

Needless to say, I asked, or thought rather, as that's all I could do- ""uhh?""

So the question was repeated, and I thought ""sure?""

That was 10 years from now. As it happens, everyone got the same choice, But let me tell my story.

""ONE, Happy New Year!"" I saw as the ball dropped on my parent's CRT TV. It's funny, when dropped into a situation you don't understand, your first instinct is to go along with things, so I said ""Happy New Year"" on an awkward pause, and the sound of my own voice startled me, then after about 15 seconds the screams on the TV sound like confusion more than happiness. The camera tipped over, and the stream cut. I looked at my parents. They looked at me, and again, that sound. 'Uh?'

I spoke first, ""Mom, for lack of a better way to put this, what ball just dropped?""

She laughed hysterically and said ""Not yours, yet.""

Then, my dad, who in will 2014 suffer from cancer, checked to see that he now had a pair as well, and then felt the hair ontop his head.

We'd all made the same decision, and although it seemed like a really weird dream, I think I mostly understood what had happened.

We all instinctively went to check our phones, which was awkward as I didn't even have one, and the two of them had BlackBerry's they had no idea how to use, so our next idea was to check the internet, but clearly it wasn't just us as attempting to access any page gave 503's or 402's or other codes, all major sites were down due to traffic. MSN Messenger was down, and Runescape and Club Penguin too. In desperation we turned on the radio to head the a message playing on repeat on every station.

""Not everyone has chosen to keep their memories, please remain calm. Minors are to report to their schools and adults to their societal role as best their memory at the start of two thousand and ten. Please do not place an emergency call unless you require immediate medical care or there are other life threatening emergencies.""

The next day I waited for the bus to school in clothes, and body, that felt foreign. I felt like a creep looking at my own body in a mirror. 11 years old. 6th grade. I didn't remember my bus drivers name. I decided to sit next to my grade school friend, Kenny, and I struck up conversation, my pre pubescent voice grinding at my ears: ""Hey, been a long time, huh?""

""I'm scared,"" he whimpered in a heavy breathed cry. ""You don't sound like you.""

""Oh, you didn't decide to keep your memories."" I said, before realizing he wouldn't even know what that meant either

""Hey, look, I'm still your friend, but I haven't seen you in, well, 10 years. I know it'll be hard, but at least right now you've got me by your side."" I patted his back with my tiny hands.

\---

When we got to the school some of the adults had formed lines, holding big signs that read '2020' and '2010', and kids, some with parents, got in the lines. School administrators helped coordinate things. I took Kenny to the '2010' line and promised I'd meet up with him later as I left him to get in the back of the '2020' line. At 9:23am, over an hour late, the last bus finally finished dropping off kids and the lines wound around the play yard. The 'youngest' in the '2020' line were 2 year olds with an incredibly creepy ability to talk in full sentences that were really feeling about the same as Kenny was. It was deeply unnerving. Though that though lead to the more uncomfortable thought that a whole generation had just been 'unborn'. I suppose it's best to not think about that. It was cold and although I had the over-protective parent bought 13-layer thick coat on to keep me warm enough, I still shivered as the line moved forward. Some people tried to make conversation, but a line full of kids ranging in mental age from 12 to 26 made conversation all the more awkward, not to mention despite looking distantly familiar, none of us knew each other, so the '2020' line remained mostly silent while the '2010' line roared with voices in a wide range of emotions. We slowly shuffled inside and were seated in the gym, but with all of us in there, many of us had to sit on the gym floor as well.

A man that looked to be no older than 25 years old walked up the podium ""For now, the staff and administration would like to address everyone, as a community,"" his voice was confident, warm, and smooth. He seemed like he must be a public speaking student giving a presentation for a college class, ""I am Bryce Peterson and as strange as this will sound, I was the principal of this school from 2016 to 2020.""

""The circumstances of this situation are bizarre, the facts completely unknown, and the future now, so far as we can tell, has been un-set. For those of you who have not experienced the coming years, it's fair to say you'll be able to read about the future you missed soon, as textbooks are assembled and information dispersed. There's a lot that has happened in our reset decade. Major world events, political shifts, many horrors and many amazing miracles. But now, we as a community must move forward. Babies have been lost, but some loved ones are now back with us. For the kids in the room, their generation has been divided, they've lost many friends over night as strangers now fill their shoes. We can not ignore what we now know, but we can use it to bring about a new decade that is better than the last. But what's most important now is rebuilding the fractured personal lives and understanding how to move forward on a personal basis.""

\---

The speech went on, information was dispersed, some of the most important technicalities were discussed- what to do if you were married, if you have suddenly lost something important (babies, pets, etc.), and what resources are available, what those that have suddenly regained or lost disabilities should do, what personal future events should be reported (births, deaths, weddings, terminal illness acquisitons, etc.), . With each bullet point the forced reset seemed worse and worse. The crisis seemed to be boiling to bigger extremes.

That was all seven years ago. Today in 3017 (For simplicity in conversation we've all began just adding a thousand to the current time, though nobody really knows where the trend started), It's even crazier. Don't get me wrong, some things have changed to be so much better- I didn't need to go to college as I was close enough to graduation that I was given a neoactive-degree, freeing me from intense debt and my dad was able to avoid getting Cancer all together by having a massive life style change; however, being able to go back my mom decided she'd had enough and wanted her thirties back, so she divorced him a year ago. Honestly, I'm glad she did, but it's still crazy. Climate change has been slowed down at least, and the 2016 election was between two real candidates, Thankfully I was able to vote in 3016- all the Groundhogs, those that kept their memory, had their ages averaged at arrival, so while I'm now mentally 28 and physically 18, I'm legally 23, but, of course, bars still don't want to serve me as serving an 18 year old still looks weird. Seems like bars are busier these days.

Another two years, a bit closer to 3020 right? Not that I care anymore. My brother, Mom, dead. Just like that. In an instant. What I'd give to have them back. 243 days until 3020. 243 days, and I wouldn't have all these 'What If?' thoughts running though my mind.

\---

The new years part was tense, but alcohol loosens the mood. It'd been a crazy decade. Twice. But Now ""It's time to move on, to go back a thousand years, and forward one"" is what everyone said. We'd enter 2020.
