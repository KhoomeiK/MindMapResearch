If you actually are going through what you say you are, then you could use the lack of negativity.

If you aren't, then stop descending further in the lies. (I don't subscribe to this theory, but just covering my bases).

Anyway, you have a lovely story and thanks for making me smile and be in aww of how mature both of you are. Keep rocking, my dude! <3"

GooglePixel,fdohjoy,t1_fdo0s8k,1578605277.0,"Some defense of the 'unlocked before you look at it' to follow:

Its not that we save a second; its rather we can more reliably unlock the phone without actively looking at it. So, here's my workflow at times on my Pixel 2 XL:

1. Unlock with the rear FPS.
2. Press home.
3. Double tap anywhere to open phone.
4. Finally look at the phone, and tap from one of my favorites to call.

Off the 4 steps here, I only need to actively look at the phone at the last one. And its kind of like touch typing: you can look at the keyboard and type but its a better workflow to not need to do that.

TLDR: A rear FPS is better for muscle memory."
