A lot of our neighbors do have very large dogs, so it’s completely possible. I stumbled across these tracks near a moose carcass that has been covered with snow, looks unrelated to the wolves. They seemed relatively straight, like the wolf was on a mission. I have seen moose kills by wolves further north from where in currently live in past winters. That is very cool that you used to do wolf tracking for your state, sounds like a fun job. One of my favorite things to do is check for fresh animal tracks in the snow while mushing around the trail systems out here."
mildlyinteresting,ffadj4y,t1_ffaag4i,1579733012.0,Agreed! Wish I had spotted her/him from afar. Such amazing animals.

AskReddit,felzhz7,t1_fejsax3,1579235001.0,Does anyone remember Toy Commander on GameCube? I still think about the in-depth game maps and the little truck with a pencil sharpener in the bed that fired missiles. So good!
dogswithjobs,fcw3rgh,t1_fcsimm6,1578016470.0,I like it!
dogswithjobs,fct84qy,t1_fcpr0jc,1577935397.0,Haha! I’m just glad that we’re finally gaining approximately 6 minutes of sunshine a day now.

dogswithjobs,fcjeius,t1_fcj3veb,1577684769.0,"It’s not lame at all, it was also one of my favorite movies growing up. I grew up in Denver and had no idea what sled dogs were until later in life and I couldn’t be happier that I’ve dedicated my time to teaching and learning from sled dogs. Hopefully I can do an AMA someday and help teach everyone about sled dogs and how truly amazing they are. I couldn’t imagine my life without training dogs every single day, they make life truly phenomenal. Let me know if you have more questions, I always have answers when it comes to sled dogs."

dogswithjobs,fcixbx1,t1_fc94oxb,1577672060.0,"No dumb questions when it comes to Dog Mushing. There are so many variables and possibilities that can happen when training and traveling long distances with so a large group of dogs.
When traveling/training I usually have multiple 40lb bags of dog kibble as additional weight in the sled plus sliced up salmon and/or beef snacks for the pups.
I always have an Arctic sleeping bag and 1 person bivy bag, my bag is rated to -40F/C. Additionally I carry a waterproof backpack full of anything I may personally need, such as extra dry gloves, socks, neck gaiter, base layers and possibly another dry mid layer. I either wear or carry my parka in my sled bag if it’s not too cold. I also have a 1st aid kit with veterinary supplies as well as a small sled repair kit incase I need to fix anything on the go. There are a handful of other things I carry along as well. Snow shoes, an axe, an alcohol-fueled cooker and more gear for the dogs. 
I have never felt that I was going to be in a dire situation where I have to leave any dogs behind, if you’re prepared before you leave before your run then you can usually tackle any challenges you may face on the trail. Not to say dire situations could not occur, there may be times where you may have to sit it out through a tough storm. Perhaps I’ve just been fortunate enough to not experience too many terrible storms.
Most of the trails we travel on are also generally groomed public access trail systems, however sometimes you will use trails that no one ever travels and you may not see a person for days. It just depends on the day.
I really hope this answers your questions, it would be neat to do an AMA from a professional Mushers point of view."

dogswithjobs,fc379lb,t1_fc2x3rr,1577383161.0,"No yelling is ever necessary in my experiences. Dog Mushing is always about keeping calm, collected and having patience. I try not to over communicate with the dogs while they’re working as to not distract them. Mainly I’ll tell them good job when they’re doing just that, or if everyone is working perfectly I will stop occasionally and then run up to the front and give them scratches and snacks starting with the lead dogs."
