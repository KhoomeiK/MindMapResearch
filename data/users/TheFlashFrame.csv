HL1 though starts early in the morning. You start dealing with the snipers on the first night and then you launch the rocket on day 2. You get in the xen portal that afternoon and the game probably ends at what would have been night time on Earth. 

HL2 also starts in the morning and you arrive at Ravenholm on the first night. You fight across the coastline on day 2 and you arrive at Nova Prospekt on night 2. IIRC its sunset when you meet G-man again at the citadel, so maybe that game actually takes place across two and a half days."

I just looked up the scene to see this and [holy shit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH19gKo7W7w) there are four versions and each one just gets fucking worse. I scrubbed through them all frame by frame to actually see who shoots first (use < and >).

In the Disney + version both characters shoot at exactly the same frame. Han's body is completely static for the first few frames before he shoots. When he shoots his head moves in an extremely robotic fashion, along with his arm, indicating he has actually been digitally animated.

In the 2011 blu-ray Han shoots 2 frames after he's shot at. His forearm bends downward beyond what is natural and his face actually becomes narrower on the frame where the first shot hits the wall. And then to make things worse, a SECOND blaster round comes from his gun for ONE frame right before cutting to an entirely new shot of the front side of the instigator.

1977 version seeks to do away with the question of who shot first by removing the 3/4 shot but instead implies that Han does as the last shot before the explosion is Han's face. 

1997 version has apparently been revoiced as Han's voice is different than in any other version (unless the mastering is just really fucked). Here, Han shoots an entire 8 frames after he's shot at. His body is very cartoonishly photoshopped out of the way of the shot, contorting his face in the process, and his trigger finger is notably frozen in place until the exact frame where he fires. At this point his finger snaps into position and pulls the trigger in a single frame. His arm move unnaturally and the rest of his body is frozen in place. He fires ***two*** shots now.

In all of these, the only one that shows the maclunkey shot is the Disney+ version.

TL;DR - There's no version included in this video where Han actually shoots first. At best he shoots at the exact same frame wherein he's shot at. *BUT* even in this case, he's very obviously been hand animated so delay his action, so in the original he almost definitely shot first. Every other example in this video has him shooting second. Regardless, ""maclunkey"" is only said in the one version where he shoots at the same time."

Monsanto sells seeds.
