So why are you wholly writing off their party?

What if they come out and they say ""We are not endorsing Trump for 2020. Our candidate is ____""? Are you still ""fuck the repubs they TEND TO be pieces of shit""?

Hopefully not, because as you know, it's NOT about party. So, let's stop bringing up party when talking about the sheer fuck ups and corruption that happens.

""Both sides"" is an end to a derailment of the actual discussion. It's not the shit you clowns in this reddit hive mind have come to see it as. You want to be personally incensed because when I say ""both sides are shit"" because you align yourself with one of those sides. The fact still remains though, no matter how upset you get at the statement, both sides are SHIT. Don't vote for your side. Don't have a fucking side. Put away the fucking colors and vote for a person and policies. 

Both sides are shit = focus on the person not the party.

You can pretend it's something else. You can pretend it's more and it means a bunch of shit and it's disingenuous because A's crimes out weigh B's crimes. But all it does is keep you from actually discussing the problem and solutions.

If you read ""both sides"" you should upvote and comment back to the POINT with something ON TOPIC.

Instead, you start up the same dumb fucking argument about how one side is clearly better than the other AND IT DOESN'T FUCKING MATTER.

So, like I've been saying this whole fucking time, focus on the PERSON and POLICY and if you see some one bring up ""but they're Z!"" you say ""both sides"" and go back to the fucking point."

AskReddit,ff71upt,t1_ff6v8x5,1579639453.0,"Welcome to the horror comedy that is life. This world is fueled by cruel irony.

The day you leave the womb the pain begins, the air is cold the light is bright and some doctor just slapped your ass and now you're crying! (they don't any more, but you get it) You'll spend your whole life looking to get back to the warm safe comfort of it.

So what's the point? Well that's definitely been pondered for all of humanity. 

Many religions tell you that it is to serve. And if you serve well you will be rewarded. 

Some say you get to play it again.

Others say this is merely a simulation running all possible outcomes to determine the answer to a question we don't know. 

But those don't really help you in your situation now. So, you say the best you can do is to make life worse so it feels better? Not what I was getting at but I've had those thoughts. I don't want to offend but these are the thoughts of some one in pain. You know from your life that when it's shit and it gets better you feel better. So from that logic your statement is spot on. If you make it worse, when it gets better it will feel better and you'll be better prepared for the shittiness next time so maybe it'll be less painful. I get that, and while it's a great outlook and solid logic for temporary shitty situations, it's not at all helpful for more long term and permanent ones.

At least that's what I assume you meant based off my comment, your direct words would imply that if you make your life worse it feels better directly. But no, like I said, remember the diminishing returns. You keep making your life MORE shitty it will feel LESS ""less bad"" and if you remember math two negatives make a positive.

So I'm going back to my assumption you're in some sort of painful situation. If this is a temporary one, dig deep, get through it, the light at the end will burn your eyes cause you haven't been in it for a while but you will adjust.

If it's a long term or permanent shitty painful situation (like motherfucking LIFE) then you must adjust your view. Don't focus on the daily pain, don't ignore it, accept it and deal with it best you can. Then beyond that strive for ""ok"" ""content"" ""alright"" etc. Happiness will come, and go, enjoy it, but let it go.

When you are in pain, and something takes away that pain, you will feel euphoric. You feel happy, good, better, GREAT even!! But that euphoria will wear off. If the cause of the pain is gone you return to ""ok"" if the pain returns you are suffering again. This is the basic mechanism for addiction. A person is suffering, or they're ok, and they feel euphoric from whatever drug or feeling or emotion made them feel that good. Some people get addicted to the high of adrenaline. Some people it's sex. Some people it's money and power. Some it's drugs and alcohol. And it's good, for a little while, then it's less good and less good.

I know it sounds strange but the same applies to the other side. ""Why did that person who has everything, money, fame, fans, etc kill themselves??"" Because those are highs, getting those make them euphoric, for a little while. Then the money the fame, the drugs, the adrenaline, it all wears off. And just like when you're in pain so long you become euphoric when it goes away. If you're euphoric all the time and it goes away you feel pain. You chase that feeling.

So what's the solution? A very simple yet deep and layered phrase: 

Everything in moderation. INCLUDING moderation.

This means, don't party every night. Moderate yourself. But you gotta live too! You gotta go out and party every once in a while! So your moderation need moderated. 

This will keep you from getting burned out on the stuff you love that makes you happy, but it keeps you from being a boring do-nothing.

That little phrase speaks volumes to me. Helps me keep my depression in check. What keeps me from attempting suicide again is basically morbid curiosity and simulation/quantum suicide theory. No point in killing yourself if you just merge into a universe where your attempt failed. To an AI all data is equally good, if you suicide it's logged and analyzed, if you live a full life, logged and analyze. So why bother torturing myself, universe will do that for me.
