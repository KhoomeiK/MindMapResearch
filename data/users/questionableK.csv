AskReddit,fee5fnv,t1_fecu3l6,1579026774.0,I’m fine thank you. It was the 7th time.
dogpictures,fedfuxo,t1_fecpk6c,1579010392.0,Thank you so much for this
AskReddit,feckmei,t3_eodtd1,1578976221.0,Someone ran down the tracks at my train. I was going about 20mph when I hit him. He lived. It was bad.
dogpictures,feckbxp,t3_eo864x,1578976011.0,Thank you but I don’t think it will be. She really was everything to me.
dogpictures,fec9dqk,t1_fec8la4,1578968981.0,I’m sorry to hear about your girl. My Missy was with me almost everyday of the last 15 years. She was my everything.
dogpictures,feby5uw,t1_febujkm,1578964169.0,Her name is Missy. She looks big in pictures but she really wasn’t. Only about 50lbs
dogpictures,feamy3t,t3_eo864x,1578950410.0,The Dr just emailed me the results of the masses they removed during her surgery. She had two different forms of very aggressive cancer. She wouldn’t have had much time left and it was possible it had already spread into her organs.  I miss her so much but it makes me feel a little better that she didn’t suffer for a long time and that I made the right decision with surgery.
dogpictures,feajex8,t3_eo864x,1578949580.0,I stayed home from work today. Wrapped in the blanket she slept in. All of your comments really help. Helping me get the tears out.
dogpictures,feaiab9,t1_feah7nw,1578949115.0,She was 15. I spoiled her in every way possible.
dogpictures,feac400,t1_feab7bh,1578946857.0,She was the best. She was part shar-pei so she was incredibly squishy. The absolute best cuddler.
dogpictures,fe9xra3,t1_fe9vpnm,1578942370.0,She was the sweetest. She gave the best hugs and was always at the door with a present when I got home from work. I don’t want to leave my house because she won’t be there when I get home

dialysis,fcztu2g,t1_fczmk44,1578108508.0,"Alcohol consumption is not a hard no. Alcoholism is.  I’m on two different lists and I told both of them that I occasionally have a drink or two. In April a kidney became available, it didn’t end up working out, there was a problem they discovered with it when I was outside the operating room, but I told them I had a few drinks the week before and they had no issue."

dialysis,fcsqn8a,t3_eipf24,1577922651.0,"I imagine he would feel completely miserable for quite a while before death. Skipping 4 sessions isn’t even two weeks. It depends on a lot of factors. In my case, and I’m on PD, my nephrologist has told me to skip weekends if I want sometimes. Everyone is different but it’s not rare to here about people who are stage 5 that don’t know anything is wrong till they end up at the ER."
lastimages,fcsp7zk,t1_fcprdue,1577921631.0,Keep your head up and push on.  Life sucks and then it gets worse. Then it gets better. Ebbs and flows. I’ve been on dialysis for 3 years. All i do is work and come home and spend 12 hours on a machine. Found out my brother is a match for a kidney transplant yesterday. Suicide has entered my mind almost daily for those 3 years. Just keep going and you’ll find what you’ve been waiting for

lastimages,fcpafq0,t1_fcp550g,1577856113.0,The last guy that ran at my train survived.  It was bad. I was only going 20 mph when I hit him. Multiple crushed bones and his face from the nose down looked like the predator when he takes the mask off
lastimages,fcp6af0,t1_fcojuo8,1577851872.0,"I’ve had 6 suicide attempts in 5 years so far as an engineer. The last one was two weeks ago. I can understand people wanting to kill themselves but involving someone else in it dehumanizes them to me.  I’m much more upset when I hit animals. For them to to stand in front of a train with their dog is infuriating.  

PS 2 of the 6 didn’t die but I guarantee they wish they had. Death by train is not certain and when they don’t die the result is bad."
CatastrophicFailure,fbrcpp8,t1_fbrawgs,1577041660.0,"If the car tips over its not difficult for the axles to come off. The train car really just sits on top of the wheels. The wheel assembly is called a truck. When they are changed out in a facility they roll the truck over a drop table and lower the table, truck goes down with the table and the car stays where it is"
