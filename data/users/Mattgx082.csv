Kava,fgulcba,t3_f0jxe4,1581123679.0,"I haven’t done it yet either. I figured I was gonna do 4 tablespoons, 8oz-12oz water, blend and a strainer bag. Seems like it was the shirt being too thick. I’d probably would have drank it to, so it wouldn’t go to waste! Order a strainer bag for next time"

PS4,fgrtfqj,t1_fgrt809,1581056939.0,"Thought so, looks great. I got it last Christmas and honestly played a few missions  in and side missions. Great game...only at the Halloween mall area part so far. Been busy playing division 2 with a friend and Mk11 battles."

PS4,fgrssyp,t3_ezxzc5,1581056307.0,"So pretty much all the delayed games. Still wondering about what the difference between them will be with the Pro and X versions. As well if other studios will patch ps4 titles at the start for the ps5....like the last of us. How much difference can their be between a ps4 pro late gen game vs a ps5 game? Unless they gimp it on purpose or offer a native 4K kicked 60fps on all their single players. The frames per second are a bigger deal to me. 4K, native 4K, 1440 I don’t care so much."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fgrsazm,t1_fgrrg50,1581055815.0,"Oh wow, yeah that’s a big deal breaker. Why not have an at home game night, a movie and go to the store to pick out some snacks, make your own pizzas or something fun to do together, and get the booze together if anything. Or dinner, drinks and a movie thing. Sounds like a much better night to me. 

Sounds like the dude had FOMO, if he didn’t get out with classic alcoholic tendencies to go from just 2 or 3 to full on shit faced. That’s the worse, especially if that was your only date nights essentially. At least you’re not with them anymore. I wouldn’t want to be after all you’ve described"
trashy,fgrnphf,t3_ezxuy4,1581051722.0,"From the interviews I’ve seen, he seems to be really into cocaine, drinking and like a big kid with money and addictions that sleeps all day and gets his lines through an earpiece for movies these days. He seems rather depressed and bad off. Imo judging from the news and his character they were both probably using and fighting a lot with the money and drugs probably escalating it to bigger heights. But her smear campaign and what she says by pulling that card is bs. If she was hitting him and abusive she should be held accountable.

I haven’t read all the transcripts though yet to really know the entire ordeal. But seems the public is really siding with him."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fgrmb3s,t1_fgqhkwt,1581050571.0,"That’s pretty aggressive. As a guy of course I’ve been in a situation where I had an extra drink or two and my gf at the time would be....I told you so or get on to me for staying out later with friends. Or I’d feel stupid about it the next day when she is not hungover and I am. It was my fault for wanting to party more, or stay out longer. But if she left, I followed her and just settle down for the night, no biggie. 

Nothing like that is worth getting agitated about to physical violence. But with couples when you tell one person they can’t do something it can come off as controlling and confusing. I tend to just say maybe you shouldn’t, or I’m gonna go home soon if you like to come back with me. I try to give them the option and reasons then let it be up to them. Or say maybe another night we can plan something fun, and let loose but maybe tonight is not the night. It took me a bit to not be selfish and consider what’s convenient for me, isn’t always for them and sometimes a compromise is necessary...pretty much like any relationship.

In your case it seems he had some past trauma or aggression issues, that poked out when he was drunk. Or maybe depression/mental issues towards self hate going on, much deeper than the situation. Violence is one of those things I just don’t see acceptable in any form, unless you have to defend yourself."
nextfuckinglevel,fgrk41p,t3_ezvml1,1581048854.0,"Awesome lol. Always shut the fuck up! 

Usually if a crime is potentially committed, say the 5 suspects get brought in. Then all placed in different room with a detective. The detective will lie, and say all your friends said it was you. You better come clean. They do this to everyone till they have an idea off two or three of the 5, and then apply pressure on the target to confess before a lawyer even shows up. They always go after the weak targets that will crack and spill the beans first. Get their emotions going that their life is over till they talk. So everyone just shut the fuck up lol. Simple"
OldSchoolCool,fgrji5o,t3_f0199l,1581048400.0,"90s fashion was always weird. 90s grunge fashion still made it through and so did some of the old hip hop stuff with street wear, Jordan’s and bright colored wind breakers. 

I can’t count the amount of t-shirts with a flannel not buttoned up, and worn blue jeans with vans or converse I see all the time lately. I just had my flannel from 2017 I started wearing again and when I go out I noticed 7 out of 10 guys wearing the same thing. That grunge look is still def a thing, but the preppy 90s look not so much. The skater look is also very relevant still as well to teens and early 20s. 

The 90s rave look stood no chance though, it was just so goofy and everything was big and colorful."
AskReddit,fgriba3,t1_fgprlxf,1581047522.0,"Yeah, but some people think you’re doing it for fun and treat you like a hobby/discounting your talent. It becomes that way, the more over saturated the market gets. Like music recording and production. It’s very over saturated at people making claims to be a pro producer, with no experience because they walked into guitar center and paid $200 for a cheap interface to hook into a cheap laptop. The person paying for the work basis it a lot on that...well the last guy did it for free or $100. Well does the last guy have a 50k studio with professional gear, portfolio and 20 years experience? I’m assuming photography, unless you’re well known, or have a network of a niche you do... is the same in that regard. 

It’s become way more difficult with cheaper tech/amateur skill sets vs pro tech and experienced experts. The person paying sometimes, doesn’t take any of that into account and doesn’t know any difference between the two or cares."

OpiatesRecovery,fgnysho,t1_fgnu5g6,1580955884.0,Thanks for the info. Also remember most walk in clinics and doctors will prescribe clonidine if you tell them what’s going on. I’ve been in a situation and just went to a walk in clinic and they saw no issue. That med is a god sent for w/d and getting a little rest. I saved a lot of it if I ever go through w/d.
benzorecovery,fgnnz4z,t1_fgn4uv6,1580949047.0,"Yeah, even after any detox I always would sweat everything out as much as possible. Also during taper as well. Just a good habit to get into anyway. But that’s some good info to know!"
OpiatesRecovery,fgnmh5c,t3_ezhf86,1580948058.0,"Congrats even with the Kratom! Honestly if Kratom was around back in the day when suboxone was the o my option I would of tapered and then took Kratom 3 days a week for a small amount of time. Subutex is the worse getting off, even after w/d and many months out with PAWS. I got off for 9 months and was put back on 0.25mg-0.5mg, a pretty jumping small dose. Been researching if I jumped to Kratom daily for 3 weeks daily and stopped sub, then just dealt with Kratom w/d for a week or two if it would be easier on me. I just hate long half life meds as they are a double edge sword...given you don’t take as much, and can rebuild your life, but getting off they have such a long build up it takes forever to readjust. My sub withdrawal taper was a long process and never really landed in my feet with paws 9 months out, 100% off. Been back on the small dose now 10 months daily.

6 months is great though, given your using the Kratom responsibly and can’t start skipping days with it here and there."
benzorecovery,fgnls5p,t1_fgneflq,1580947600.0,"Well yeah, your body is going through a lot during a detox for sure. But also detox symptoms usually resemble the flu/sickness in periods, especially the first 2 weeks. After 4 weeks usually should start feeling a lot better and not like the flu hit you. Especially with only 7 weeks use. But very possible if you were very active during your first month. I know when I detoxed off suboxone I stayed home for 30 days and rarely got out. Never let anyone over with even a cold! Was already going through hell and the worse is getting sick during w/d period. 

Plus there seems to be a seasonal flu/cold thing going around in my area in Louisiana, everyone seems to be getting."
benzorecovery,fgnd8s4,t3_ezedwt,1580942405.0,"Yeah daily use at big enough doses for a month or more can cause issues with any benzodiazepines or opiate. I toyed around with 3 times a week with my meds then could get away without taking anything without repercussion. It’s not until you get at least a month of daily use, you’re gonna have some issues. Good news is 7 weeks isn’t long enough to cause massive damage and have to rebuild everything like long term users...who get past it and have 2 years before their brain straightened out. 

You already made it pretty far off. Keep going and just consider it a lesson. But if you really think it may be flu or something else, by all means go get a swab and Checkup. After 30 days it’s odd you feel worse than better with physical symptoms unless you had some really high dosage build up. Most even long length dosage meds like kpin/Valium, you’ll start to feel it pretty bad within the half life of 72-100hrs of last dosing. I’d go to the doctor given how long it’s been. I had a fever once and was sick. Next week found out I had cancer...it was cured with surgery. But you just never know, and always should watch your health."

insomnia,fglgbjk,t1_fgl3abr,1580896291.0,"That stuff does work at 50mg or under. But only large doses for rare times. It helped me out at 25 mg for awhile. I got off it though and take a Klonipin and melatonin at bed now. But it’s very good for times of extreme insomnia or withdrawals. Also is clonidine, which will knock anyone out. I’m had bad depression and serequel was a good option for a bit with insomnia, depression, anxiety and work. Pretty powerful med"
AskReddit,fgldjtf,t3_eyus0a,1580892239.0,"She’s a black out drunk or can’t be trusted, accountable, or can’t just relax. Kinda reaching low, but all those things are red flags. If a girl is all over the place, and can’t have a genuine moment or show interest in one person over random encounters....I’m out. I’ve met plenty ones down just for the party, money, time  or in survival mode. I can’t with that, but I’m pretty humble to see past shortcomings, and people trying to better themselves, that may struggle sometimes."
John_Frusciante,fgl4m17,t3_ex6c7a,1580881850.0,"Johns been seen around and looks good. I saw him in a random YouTube thing with the Jonny Ramone fest at The Hollywood cemetery. Where a bunch of musicians get together and sing songs as a tribute. A random guy  caught him on side camera in Nov 2019, did a double take as he has short hair and said hi. He just looked at the camera. He was there as a guest just hanging out, blending in. But he looked pretty normal and happy. He’s bad with public interviews and dealing with stuff on camera. Not to mention the documentaries in the past, him losing most all his teeth, surgery for it and the wild ride he’s been on. Plus he’s just not into money or band politics it seems. The net worth between the members even with back catalog revenue is staggering. Either he is very poor with money and doesn’t care or touring really pays off huge these days now.

John_Frusciante,fgl325s,t1_fg51lmq,1580880466.0,"Well I mean he has these small bands he can open up with bigger bands for. But he will def not be getting the same paychecks over the last 10 years. He mentioned it a few times, but not directly in the podcast interview and rolling stone. Nor does he have publishing rights/credits, to the biggest hits like John.

He’s by no means broke, compared to most anyone. But you got to imagine the lifestyle, rentals and things he bought in storage ect. He’s probably going to have to sell some stuff. I wouldn’t be surprised to see a guitar warehouse auction to unload some unnecessary guitars, and amps just sitting around. Hope he paid his house in full though, and his touring is enough to keep a moderate but nice life. He’s about my age and net worth 10 million living in LA in a nice place. That’s a lot, but he probably didn’t save like he would of if he got a years notice and a final/tour album. That’s a vibe I got listening to the podcast and interview. He mentioned he didn’t want to look back a year from now at his financials and be “damn those guys a year ago for letting me go!”

It’s like 10 years living the life and then...ok, back to being in obscure bands hustling on tour paychecks, and favors from friends for opening spots. That kind of sucks, but the way life goes. It’s hard to be a new successful rock band, and make that kind of money these days. It’s only the huge acts of the past doing it still. Kinda surprised he wasn’t offered to stay on as a backing guitarist, at a lower rate like he was before."
Arcade1Up,fgkj49o,t1_fgkdflj,1580866751.0,"Same, maybe weight takes into account. I’m 130lb so I’m not really wearing on it too much. I even use it sometimes when I’m in my music studio, or just chilling. So gets plenty of use...No issues at all, but I could see they won’t last forever. Have used mine daily since September. MK edition."
