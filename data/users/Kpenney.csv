photogrammetry,ffcvwrb,t3_esx72w,1579808368.0,"Well camera tips, your going to want good lighting and be wary of reflective surfaces, those are generally better recreated manually or if you must, dust the shiny or reflective surfaces with talcum powder or baby powder. Also when you start shooting, make sure your levels stay pretty consistant and the photos are consistent with exposure or otherwise your textures at the very least get screwed up.

I think you can get away using a flash, also make sure your white balances are consistant and accurate or otherwise you'll be doing more post on your photos before you feed them to the software.

Main question for hardware; does your GPU have CUDA cores? This will dictate what software is available to your machine. If you do have some CUDA cores then you can start with the open source software Meshroom. 

I actually thought about doing this with my bedroom but for my case, I figured a combination of modeling and photogrammetry of more complex shapes and objects may be best as my walls have a single tone of paint on them. Just my thoughts considering consistent lighting in my bedroom is a hard task to accomplish without interfering with the overall scene.

Honestly I'd start small and just start with part of the room and see how your photos are being rendered, and then consider if theres a more efficient way of generating what you need., theres no point trying for the moon right out of the gate if it takes forever to discover *""that didnt work like I thought it would""*"

To be fair to them, it was a very quiet night in the ER and luckily my dads doing better, though they do need to get him out before it starts getting busy mid day tomorrow if they can... I mean that's what we were all thinking when they said they didnt want to keep him if they didnt have to, obviously for volume reasons. But bless that place tonight for once, never thought on my 32nd birthday I'd see this post on this section of reddit and then by midnight be asking for help from the same people the post refers to. That's a weird coincidence.

By the way I saw the closet and kitchen referenced in the post, they're about 5 by 10 or so feet and actually adjacent to one another, right on the other side of the security doors. If it was me calling triage management on a busy winter night in nova Scotia where theres so many broken ankles from falling on ice and kids puking from the flu then yeah I could totally see using these rooms because their physically there and give patients some privacy and the kitchen is a staff break room btw, the supply closet is pretty clean. The hospital was built in the 1990s and I don't think it was ever planned to have that much volume in its life span without renovations which the region cant afford because of the excessive volume would crush the smaller and even more dated but relatively just as freshly renovated health care centers in the area. In short, build another major hospital nearby to accommodate everyone driving up to 3 hours away for overnight triage."

That said theres not enough doctors in the area, yet theres barely any incentive for doctors to set up in this area. We could clearly set up more middle men to try and solve the volume at ERs, perhaps by having community run 'advice points' were theres really not much in terms of medicine done but rather educating patients on what that pain could be.

In short you need to let them catch up to utilize hardware that's either just been released/up and coming and that which has become more consumer affordable such as NVME2 drives, cuda cores have become more widely adopted instead of when I was in college and we only had render aimed cards that had enough cuda cores to deal with our calculations. A lot of arma 3s resources were put into more affordable eye candy and I'm certain that occluded terrain features allowneces were greatly increased over a quantified scenario with more random but less scripted scenarios taking presidents over system resources, where bushes looked kinda poopy in comparison and the terrain didn't have nearly as many vertices, as well as most buildings didn't have interiors.

I did see this link earlier but if anyone else doesn't want to bother reading the meat and potatoes they actually do explain it pretty well, I'm just oblivious and blind;

^(Algorithm description:The Boykov-Kolmogorov max-flow (or often BK max-flow) algorithm is a variety of the augmenting-path algorithm.) **^(Standard augmenting path algorithms find shortest paths from source to sink vertex and augment them by substracting the bottleneck capacity found on that path from the residual capacities of each edge and adding it to the total flow. Additionally the minimum capacity is added to the residual capacity of the reverse edges. If no more paths in the residual-edge tree are found, the algorithm terminates. Instead of finding a new shortest path from source to sink in the graph in each iteration, the Boykov-Kolmogorov algorithm keeps the already found paths as follows:)**

^(The algorithm builds up two search trees, a source-tree and a sink-tree. Each vertex has a label (stored in ColorMap) to which tree it belongs and a status-flag if this vertex is active or passive. In the beginning of the algorithm only the source and the sink are colored (source==black, sink==white) and have active status. All other vertices are colored gray. The algorithm consists of three phases:)

^(grow-phase: In this phase active vertices are allowed to acquire neighbor vertices that are connected through an edge that has a capacity-value greater than zero. Acquiring means that those vertices become active and belong now to the search tree of the current active vertex. If there are no more valid connections to neighbor vertices, the current vertex becomes passive and the grow phase continues with the next active vertex. The grow phase terminates if there are no more active vertices left or a vertex discovers a vertex from the other search tree through an unsaturated edge. In this case a path from source to sink is found.)

^(augment-phase: This phase augments the path that was found in the grow phase. First it finds the bottleneck capacity of the found path, and then it updates the residual-capacity of the edges from this path by substracting the bottleneck capacity from the residual capacity. Furthermore the residual capacity of the reverse edges are updated by adding the bottleneck capacity. This phase can destroy the built up search trees, as it creates at least one saturated edge. That means, that the search trees collapse to forests, because a condition for the search trees is, that each vertex in them has a valid (=non-saturated) connection to a terminal.)

^(adoption-phase: Here the search trees are reconstructed. A simple solution would be to mark all vertices coming after the first orphan in the found path free vertices (gray). A more sophisticated solution is to give those orphans new parents: The neighbor vertices are checked if they have a valid connection to the same terminal like this vertex had (a path with unsaturated edges). If there is one, this vertex becomes the new parent of the current orphan and this forest is re-included into the search tree. If no new valid parent is found, this vertex becomes a free vertex (marked gray), and it's children become orphans. The adoption phase terminates if there are no more orphans.)

[And their nice diagram to go along](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_54_0/libs/graph/doc/figs/bk_max_flow.gif)

I just find this stuff very neat and would love to learn more about what goes on under the hood, even though I'm not a math enthusiast in much sense.
