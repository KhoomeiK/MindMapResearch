todayilearned,ffn3gup,t1_ffk09tv,1580061631.0,"Actually most of Weird Al's songs wouldn't be covered under parody. While they're comedy for sure - parody is pretty specific and since the songs and artists aren't really the subject of the comedy he is doing, but rather a vehicle for unrelated comedy they're not considered parody. That's not to say that none of his songs would be covered but most would not. Further fair use is a typeb of active legal defense and you must specifically demonstrate that your work falls under fair use. It's not the plaintiff's job to show that it's not fair use, so they can still issue a take down notice and you'd have to say ""if you pursue this in court we intend to demonstrate that this is fair use"", it won't just get thrown out automatically because the judge realizes that it is covered by fair use."

EDH,ffef8gi,t1_ffe0ykg,1579845755.0,"Haha, I actually remember that one, and it was part of the inspiration for the reply. I gave mill as an example because it that very article pops into my head every now and again as one of the cooler deck-techs I've seen, but I also want to see similar mechanical twists with other decks, more specifically about messing with the identity of the mechanic itself. Stuff that makes me go ""what is ____ really?"". 

Thanks for the reply. No joke I've thought about that article a lot and it is ultimately the inspiration for a Surrak Dragonclaw list I've been tinkering with for a while, focused around wheels, petitioners, and copying those wheels."

Love epic experiment, but it would be cool to see some experiments that are even more outside the lines than usual. Not just experimenting with different takes on a commander, but different takes on executing concepts, like ""so mill is normally this, but what happens when we turn it on its head with wheels"" or ""can card-draw effectively be replaced with discard and abilities?"" dunno, would just be a fun couple of articles to read."
EDH,ffabvjl,t1_ff9kljh,1579731884.0,"As someone who works at a shop I would like to echo this sentiment. It can be hard for shops to start up new events if their current crowd doesn't have much interest. Having players in a shop for an event draws more players in the next time, and the time after. 

If an event has no players to start with, or only one or two players it can be really hard to get the event going because no one wants to spend their time at a table waiting for others to show up. This makes it VERY hard to get events going if the initial few give up after one or two bad evenings.

However if the shop is doing its job of letting people know about the event, and the players come and sit for a while anyway, eventually after a few weeks the event will grow and you'll start to have more and more players regularly. The whole thing can snowball into success.

So if your shop doesn't have an event that appeals to you, and you can get a few friends together, let the shop know that you want to start an event night for your format. By working together with your shop and being a little patient everyone can get what they want."

gaming,feq58gc,t1_fepn6dw,1579337784.0,For the record pretty much everything in his work that was Nazi-esque was added to his stuff post mortem by his sister who he vehemently disagreed with.

EDH,felyd9f,t3_epnuuh,1579234089.0,"In some colors you take what you can get when you can get it, but generally I take low CMC in most cases.

It's not about efficiency vs power. For example \[\[Harvest Season\]\] and \[\[Traverse the Outlands\]\] both are high impact cards (when played in a deck that cares for them), and both are actually fairly efficient in many cases (traverse can easily be 7 lands for 5 mana, making it way more mana efficient than \[\[rampant growth\]\]. I still take Rampant Growth though over Traverse in most cases. Why? Because when I have little mana to work with is when I need ramp the most. When I have 5 mana I can play most cards in my deck. Sure I'm not able to drop 3-4 cards every single turn but with clever play and a well built deck I can still work within those limitations. However if I'm stuck at 2 mana I'm much more limited in my options, and in fact cant even cast my ramp spell if that spell happens to be Traverse the Outlands.

So what about Harvest Season then? Its only 3 mana, and has the potential to get tons of lands, and can also be used when you only have 3 mana instead of five. Well, problem is that it requires other set-up. Say I have an ideal situation for harvest season: 3 lands in hand, harvest season, a random card and \[\[Raise the Alarm\]\]. We play this out and drop raise the alarm on turn two, then attack on turn 3 and play harvest season in second main so that we now go and get 2 lands. Sure 2 lands into play is better than the outcome of a \[\[Kodama's Reach\]\] but not much, and honestly that required a lot of set-up. Maybe I run this in a deck which has a lot of those kinds of cards because in the meta it might be worth it to do on turn 4 and wind up with 4 lands into play but if I had the ramp I wanted on turn 1 and 2, by turn 3 I could have 5-6 mana and be setting up a draw engine to ensure that my game keeps flowing. Heck with enough of that efficiency and a bit of luck (sol ring+chrome mox into 2 signets) by turn two I could have 6 mana and potentially looking to eliminate a player on turn 3-4. 

The reason ramp is important is NOT because it gives you more resources, its because it gives you more resources THAN YOUR OPPONENTS so you can lay down threats before your opponents are ready to deal with them. If your opponents are laying down turn 5 \[\[Void Winower\]\] or \[\[It That Betrays\]\] or even just an \[\[Eldrazi Conscription\]\] onto a token, and you're still grabbing lands you're in hot water. Doesn't really matter if you're rocking 15 mana on turn 6 if they've already locked you out, or taken the huge tempo lead by making you sacrifice too many permanents."
smashbros,fek65yl,t1_fejx4h8,1579193427.0,"I'm pretty happy with the last few FE characters we've gotten. Robin, Corinthe, and now Byleth. They all have unique mechanics that give them a great feel. But the others are irritating. I loved Roy when he first came out, Marth was never my thing but then we just kept cloning Marth and changing one to two things.

EDH,fehgcv6,t1_fegf2q4,1579115974.0,"While the end result is the same, all triggers are placed on the stack in turn order before priority is passed. This might matter because there is no room between triggers being placed for someone to respond. It would look like this:

Spell Resolves: everyone draw.

State Based Effects

All Triggers are placed on the stack starting with the active player, continuing in turn order. During this step if any player has multiple triggers to place on the stack they may choose the order their own triggers are placed, but they are still placed in order in respect to turns.

The active player recieves priority, and may now respond before triggers resolve."
EDH,fehehpx,t1_fehcss5,1579114881.0,"Ah, sharpie would be fine to read, was picturing pencil and small text."
EDH,fehc42y,t3_ep2jpt,1579113506.0,"I much prefer if someone uses proper tokens. It's about readability from across the board. If your index cards don't have any color and they're just pencil on paper that means that every time I want to know what you have I have to either ask you, or reach over to grab them to check them out.

That said you could get dry erase tokens and dry erase markers so you could draw a very quick cat head in addition to the rules text and that woulfld satisfy my needs 100%. 

Additionally its not something that I would mention in front of others so much as approach you after the game and say ""Hey man, I had fun that game but it was really hard to read your board because I couldn't tell what the tokens were without constantly checking them or trying to remember. If possible I'd really appreciate if you could find a way to represent your tokens that is a little more readable""."

EDH,fe6t7t7,t3_enz7rg,1578904315.0,"I feel like this sits in the low end of focused (which is fine). Honestly it's strange to read all of these ideas about what focused decks supposedly do and don't do. Really not sure I agree.

For example I would consider most of my lists focused, and I run a combo or two in every single one of them. Not all are infinite of course but they all have the power to end the game.

Examples include [[Repercussion]]+[[Blasphemous Act]] or [[Bloodchief Ascension]] and [[Deadly Tempest]]. There are infinite ones too like [[Brudiclad]]+[[Rapacious One]]+[[Quasiduplicate]]+[[Aggravated Assault]]+[[Thermopod]]. Some of these combos have multiple substitute pieces as well so I'm not so vulnerable as to lose a piece and have no way forward.

I would argue that these combos are not for optimized decks though because optimized decks should be focusing more on earlier plays, or more flexible options. [[Yahenni's Expertise]] and [[Toxic Deluge]] over Deadly Tempest, etc. [[Force of Will]]/[[Force of Negation]] over [[Cancel]]. Essentially I think that optimized is just focused taken to its logical extremes: take the same general game plan, cut the fat, get the ideal (or close to) cards for it, focus heavily on making the gameplan happen consistently and faster. Meanwhile competitive takes a completely different approach to building all together because you're no longer building Ayula at all.

I love the idea of Graham's list, and I think it's in the focused category but the piece that your wrote seems to make a lot of claims about what a focused deck looks like, or doesn't do.

Enjoyed the read though."

I take Trazadone, which is fairly mild but works really well for me, basically no side effects too. Only thing is that it will do it's very best to keep you asleep for a good 7-8 hours. It can be taken nightly or as needed, it's non-habit forming, and taking too much usually just makes it to where you can't sleep.

tabletopgamedesign,fcssgn5,t3_eip53d,1577923964.0,"This is not a factor I consider when buying games except when the box is really large. While this would definitely be more convenient for buyers, and as a board game enthusiast I would appreciate it very much, if it requires any considerable amount of resources I would choose not to.

I do think that people associate size of the box with complexity and set up time though. The visual rhetoric of your packaging can be very important. For example I'm inclined to pay a higher price for a game I expect to have more complexity, but also less likely to buy it in general because I just don't have the time to learn or space to play larger more complex games nearly as much. Additionally I'm more likely to buy small games (something the size of forbidden island, or the resistance) because I can more easily transport them to social gatherings.

In summary: I don't think the particular Ikea dimensions are important but the size of your box will influence what kind of audience will bother to look at your game, and those that will buy it. Spend some time really thinking about who your audience is and where/how your game might be played. As a side note make sure your instruction set is written for that audience."
