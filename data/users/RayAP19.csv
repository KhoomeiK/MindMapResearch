AmItheAsshole,fferq13,t1_fferfty,1579862277.0,"I do agree that it's really strange for a bill to jump that high in a week, based on the presence of two people who are out of the house 45 hours a week, but I also don't see how I could have possibly jacked the bill up that high with just my three major appliances.

I haven't changed my usage from the beginning of December until now.

Also, their heater has a huge thingy that displays a moving CG image of a fire. I assume that uses a bit of power in addition to what it does as far as just generating heat."
AmItheAsshole,fferjfo,t1_fferfty,1579862003.0,"> Ok but when did the billing cycle on your statement end?

The last billing cycle ended on January 8. This is why I hate this situation, because there's really no way to officially tell which appliances are increasing an electric bill. If there were, it'd be cut and dry, and we'd know for sure if it's them or if it's me."
AmItheAsshole,ffergm0,t1_ffer7gl,1579861885.0,"The amount of money I have fluctuates significantly from month to month. Working from home is really inconsistent (I'm a freelancer, not a full-time WAH employee).

Also, my dad helps me with bills sometimes, but he's been a little short lately too."
AmItheAsshole,ffercmm,t1_ffer5gr,1579861716.0,"> What exactly more than doubled was the entire bill or your share?

It was the entire bill"
AmItheAsshole,ffer8zi,t1_ffer3wu,1579861562.0,"> You say they moved in on the first so that means they have not even been here for a month. Since you have already received a bill, that means the majority of the usage was likely before they moved in. I don’t doubt some of the increase is from them, but I use my space heater a lot and quite frankly it doesn’t cause that much of an uptick in my electric bill. Are you sure this is really all on the roommates?

I can't imagine what else it would be. I don't use any major appliances besides the three I mentioned-- Xbox, TV, laptop.

> Also, you say they are hard to talk to, but why?

They tend to use a condescending tone when someone says something to them that they disagree with (even though I always try to be cordial with everyone). Plus I have social anxiety. That doesn't help."
AmItheAsshole,ffer47z,t1_ffer2pr,1579861370.0,"I always considered them one... entity, I guess? They're a couple and they're only renting one room. They do bring home two separate paychecks though."
AmItheAsshole,ffer1c1,t1_ffeqzsp,1579861253.0,"The thing is that I honestly can't afford to split a bill that big right down the middle. I work from home, I don't make much money.

If I could afford it, I'd just move past it and pay it, even if I thought it was unfair."
AmItheAsshole,ffeqx7i,t1_ffeqtpy,1579861085.0,"> Have you asked them if they’re cold?

I don't get this part of the question. I assume that all three of us get cold; we live on the US East Coast and it's the dead of winter.

I haven't asked them why they use the space heater. They're not exactly easy to talk to."
