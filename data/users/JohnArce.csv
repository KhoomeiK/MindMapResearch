AskReddit,fgle6o8,t1_fgkwzi9,1580893141.0,"I almost ALWAYS feel the same. Or at the very least think they should have stopped well before the ""after"" picture. It also seems often enough there's even some mention of ""I've still got some ways to go"".

  
One of my (male) acquaintances got divorced and subsequently ""changed his lifestyle"" and had gotten so incredibly thin that people thought he was ill. He looked so thin it was actually frightening. He still boasted about how much more weight he was going to lose.  
He wasn't overweight to begin with.  
While I could be mistaken, I thought it was rather obvious he was struggling to find a way to cope with his new situation and became obsessed.  
(just to indicate some personal experience, rather than just supposition)  


I agree with you that it's great when people become more comfortable with themselves. I'm not the most confident bloke out there either, and can honestly say I'd like to lose my bellyfat on my own account. But there's also a lot to be said for accepting who you áre and being alright with that. That shouldn't negate the possibility of changing.

My fear is just that people might get caught up into a spiral of 'getting healthy' and go too far. Possibly because they're pleased with all the positive attention they're getting."

By now though, I've more than learned that having a fantasy isnt the same as wanting it to actually happen.

Although, conciously posting NSFW images probably has a lot to do with wánting to be seen in that way in the first place. Most probably would prefer it to be safely from a distance, I suppose.

NSFW stuff is tricky anyway. It's not like you see someone's baking or drawing and go ""that looked so cool, you're so talented at the skill you chose to develop, good for you.""  
Watching amateur porn is mostly ""You've won the genetic lottery, I don't know or care about your personality, but your body turns me on, I imagined myself fucking you"".

""Wanting something out of it"" in the first situation is at most some tips or an exchange of favorite rolemodels.

AskReddit,fg7agar,t1_fg6v7i0,1580587796.0,"to be fair, this issue of the rich exploiting the poor has always existed and will always continue to exist. I don't think leaving the EU will change much about that.  
In my personal experience, living in the Netherlands, the first wave of immigrants I noticed were the Turks, mostly invited over to do the menial labour for cheap. I was a kid then, so I'm not exactly sure when this started, but around 1990 I was keenly aware of the Turkish groups. They too were supposed to stay for short terms and return to their homeland.

During my first employment, the default people to employ cheaply were the Poles, around 2000-ish.

So, is this a new issue in the UK/Europe? To me, it doesn't seem so.  
What I do find worrying is that the 'native' people seem to become less tolerant (or just more vocal) about these issues.  
I don't want to blame ""the internet"" for everything, but possibly the relatively recent influx of social media platforms aided in this phenomenon.

Sadly, the people that take the most issue with this, are the menial workers that feel immigrants are 'stealing their jobs'. Without wanting to be disrespectful, these aren't the people with the best insight in socio-economic matters on larger scales.

All they really understand is that they're mistreated and angry. Understandable. But simply getting rid of the current system of rules, isn't going to solve the underlying problem: Rich people want to stay as rich as they can, by spending as little money as possible. Each new law I've seen to attempt to counter that, just gets a new work-around and the machine goes merrily on.

Leaving the EU will simply shift this to other available nationalities/economic groups. Possibly illegally."

And as Riker said, they usually don't bother with the ceremony for a temporary change.
Out of universe, it feels to me like the writers just took an opportunity to show what a chance of command was like, and didnt have all the answers. The trend of the show was back to status quo at the end credits, after all. Seems quite hard to convincingly portray a supposedly permanent replacement in one episode. I know it's a two parter, but still works like óne story.

Jellico cant grow in this story, he stays one dimensional. We knów Riker is great because we've known him só long. Even if he's just being insubordinate for the hell of it, we know he's usually better than that. Maybe Jellico is the same. Just caught up in a sucky situation. He does have some ponderings here and there.


There's more in there that doesn't sit great with me, writing wise. In Picard's prisoner arc he GAINS defiance with the childhood story and ends strongly with ""four lights!"" But afterwards he's talking to Troi like he was at the verge of giving up. If he was, it wasn't portrayed convincingly.


The ""wolf"" metafor between Troi and Jellico, and where she tells Riker Jellico's actually very insecure, seems set up to have the guy take a personal fall, but it doesn't have any big pay-off at all.


I know it's supposed to be a classic, spawning the four lights thing, but it drops to many stitches for it to be a favorite of mine. The change of command plot might have made an interesting (half) season long idea, but crammed in like this, I wasn't a fan.

People probably want to hear an in-universe standpoint, but I can't stand behind one if I smell sloppy writing of details."

pawg,feowk0x,t1_feosysw,1579306945.0,"it's a bit of both as far as I'm concerned. I know slut-shaming is the new hip thing to hate, but at the end of the day, you're posting to a bunch of guys jerking off. Idc that you do, in fact, I welcome it, but that's still what you do. If you're at the point that you have dozens of videos on porn sites, you should know what to expect. These aren't people that think with their head at those times...  
Having said that, most of the comments there are by complete brainless dudes. What sense does it make to call a girl a slut, when you want her to show you videos of her having sex... Be happy with what you're getting and browse along if you're into something else.  
Don't scroll down is the best advice on any platform, probably doubly so for porn sites. These people aren't your friends and only temporary fans. Don't expect them to be."

tifu,fddhaag,t3_ekp1gv,1578312231.0,"an EXTREMELY  watered down version happened to me:  
I fell asleep quite tired and got woken up by loud banging outside. Still half asleep, my brain interpreted this as ""holy shit the entire building is coming down, we need to get the fuck out of here"". Probably the most primal I've ever acted, I rushed to the door. The stumbling because of not being quite awake yet, may have simulated the building shaking. Opening my apartment door, it was simply someone banging on the neighbours door.  
Nobody saw this, but as I live in a small-ish town in a country where it's VERY unlikely any building is simply going to collapse, I felt pretty foolish. Or rather, disconnected.  
The half-asleep brain thinks very differently from the sober one.  
The obvious alternative is to consider all scenarios very thoroughly for ten minutes, as you burn to death.  
Take your pick. safe and foolish, or an epitaph that reads ""at least no-one mocked me"".  


If all else fails: remember, you're still better off than the guy who got caught fucking his dad's couch and/or fucking a maggot invested melon. At least your TIFU was properly motivated.

Some other considerations: change that fucking lightbulb. Unless there's someone allergic to the entire light spectrum except orange, it's an easy fix.  
and: fire-drill. Figure out the best way to exit, and what to do with your uncle, and practice a few times. That'll save on the panic, hopefully."
