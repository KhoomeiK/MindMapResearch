UniUK,ffyb7l9,t1_ffy7qx2,1580342290.0,"I did a year of engineering at Warwick and didn't like it. I also felt lonely, bit thought I might as well finish the year. In August, near to a level results day, I went on the Swansea (local uni) website and filled out a form (called an RPA- record of prior acceptance) and now I do computer science. Nothing was done through UCAS. 

Student finance allows you funding for the course length (original) + 1 year, so I have 5 years of funding since I was on a master's originally (4 years+1) and so now I have 4 years of funding for this degree."

I'm not even sure how serious a thing social anxiety is. My parents know I'm weird and granted I am, but I don't know if they even know I have this. Should I see a therapist or someone or do I just have to stop being a pussy and talk to someone? I really don't know."

Not sure what you mean by 0 value. The dollar is backed by nothing, but trust. I suppose the same argument goes for butcoin, but it is backed by proof of work, a fixed supply of 21M coins (scarcity gives it value) and electricity costs to mine btc."
