news,fdd1j72,t1_fdd18uq,1578291104.0,"It's important to remember context. Soleimani is no hero. Iran knows why he was killed (at least their Govmt does), militia directly under his control sabatoged and killed people involved in Western interests in the Middle East. There was plenty of provacation from Iran and their little militias in the Middle East before he was exploded to death.

I'm not justifying the decision, it was brash and had no sense of mutual understanding, US could've easily ridden the high horse in the whole debacle by warning Iran to back off and stop trying to proxy war against one of the most powerful nations in the world. I don't think many people would take offense to US protecting it's interests democratically but the reality is that Iran has knowingly allowed their ragtag groups to sabotage US interests for a very, very long time before this ever happened.

They're just as guilty in this whole clusterfuck."
news,fdd12ra,t1_fdd0tbg,1578290614.0,"That's a terrible comparison, Iran doesn't want it's people to starve (more than they already are) nor does it want to kill it's tourism business (which makes billions of USD a year) nor does it want even more sanctions than it already has.

gaming,fdcd6dt,t3_ekhlv7,1578272030.0,"It's perspective, we always want the best thing. Back then, those poopy screens were BETTER than the big ones because the big TVs of that time were projection, a bitch to fix and expensive and were blurry as hell with similar resolutions. A 360p screen looks way better on a 15' screen than on a 60' screen.

Now we have 1440p and 4k which is so good it actually looks better on larger displays that can accurately show all those details whereas a smaller display would condense them so much they aren't visible.

A good example is characters, I modded Lara Croft in Shadow of the Tomb Raider to have a scar on her face and arms (she was mauled by a godamn jaguar after all) and those small details would be near-impossible to see in their natural HD form on a screen smaller than 20' 1080p."

Essentially every military force involved in the Middle East since The Crusades. Hell, before that too.

But yeah US calls iran's militia terrorists and in return Iran calls the drone strikes a terrorist attack.

The reality is that terrorism is often fought with terrorism, the only way to not be a terrorist is to stay out of it.

It's also become a platitude to call anyone or any group terrorist, it's basically become a political smear."

Many military and government leaders in many nations (including the US) fall into the description of ""terrorist"" now or at some point in the past. 

It's not as black and white as ""killed a terrorist that's a objective good thing"" when that also causes a nation like Iran to get pissed.
