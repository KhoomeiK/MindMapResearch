He said he came by, was (softly) calling my name (dad) and was getting worried as my car was there and my dogs weren't freaking out about a guest in the house. He peaked in my room and saw my dogs and I sleeping and said he spent the next half hour going up and down the stairs getting some of his things into his car. He said he didn't wake me up so as not to give me a heart attack but when I woke up an hour later as my dogs wanted to pee, I had this very strong and very weird feeling that someone had been there. Like really strong that I looked around the main floor a bit, but saw nothing out of place.
I had forgotten about it until two days ago when he called and told me the story. I probably heard him, incorporated it into my dream and had these feelings when I woke up. I never would have known if he hadn't mentioned being here and he wouldn't have if I hadn't joked about him not visiting his old dad. I'm sure being half awake without realizing it accounts for a lot of these kind of stories.

ChoosingBeggars,fehfzux,t1_fee202d,1579115760.0,So how does it work then? The advice I've seen given is that an employer shouldn't give a reason to fire someone in case it's a protected reason like disability.

I've read numerous people say this but it just seems like a talking point that pretends to give a shit about the working person.

Why would I mention other laws when they can literally fire you for no reason at all? I would hope there's, at least, some protections but when a company can just up and fire a long term employee on a whim, you just get terrified employees who make far too little and need their job to eat or heat their house. Places with actual workers protections can't do this and, if someone does, the employee has some recourse aside from just collecting UI. Which is another thing I don't understand. What does unemployment have to do with their former employee and why do they have a right to ""fight"" it? Again, in other places, they just give you a ROE (record of employment) with what you earned so they can figure out what you get. The only time an employer can affect that or fire you without compensation is if it's with cause or if you quit (not counting constructive dismissal).

I even bought her an automatic one so that if she goes, it will be reasonably cleaned up in my absence. Unfortunately, ""reasonable"" is not something that certain cats understand and she will hoot and howl until I go in and clean it up. In fact, she will hoot and howl before she goes so that I am ready to clean it up when she does decide to go... in 5 minutes or 35 minutes but I MUST be ready for it. Plus she stands up to poop which is kind of weird itself. Her box is by a wall and a cabinet so she stands up and puts her front paws up to steady herself and then lets rip. Makes the cover I bought to give her privacy useless and a big waste of money. When I bought it (separately) I put it on and she was extremely upset and didn't use the box until I took it off. At this point I didn't realize she stood to poop.

I mean, it is kind of cute when she comes in running all around the room like a crazy person while I prepare for the clean and then come by and peek her head over the box to watch me. I think she does this because I adopted her from a store and the employees always made sure the box was clean so it didn't stink up the store for customers.

That's a pretty big assumption. I don't think prosthetic legs are cheap and that 20% would be a lot of money to him. Maybe he can't afford to take a chance that they wouldn't waive that fee and, really, should he have to? America send their people off on endless wars and when they get hurt, people suddenly just have ""thoughts and prayers"" for them and the money to care is limited. Trillions for wars but not for care."

Same type of idiot tried that when I was selling my vinyl collection. I had it listed for $3000 and had went through each and every album to get average prices of Discogs (which is great BTW since they do min/avg/max pricing) and I chose the minimum worth ($4500) as my starting point before I got to a $3000 ask. Most of the albums were max price but it was bulk and I had to take a hit. 

Anyhow, this guy offers $700 and told me ""I was lucky to get that"". Normally, I don't respond to these goofs but wanted to argue and I let him know how much they would be worth individually and I was interested in how in the flying fuck he thought I would be lucky to get $700. Well, even before he responded, I got a guy that wanted to come by and see them right then. I told him we should get the price out of the way as weird people were coming out of the woodwork and I didn't want him to waste his trip based on price. $2300 was the offer and I had cash in hand a few hours later.

I immediately messaged him and told him that they were sold for $2300. I never heard back."
canada,fdnym72,t1_fdnx2g8,1578595496.0,"You don't have to be handcuffed for a *possible* crime. If I called the cops and said you were committing fraud, would you expect the cops to come by and put you in handcuffs? Or, you know, fucking investigate some random bank employee's claim? The article only mentions the employee, not bank management when they ""addressed"" it with the staff. It seems that people are watching too much LivePD and think it's normal to handcuff people while you question them.

A similar situation would have been when I went to Home Depot with my wife's CC (who also had a different last name). The customer service person was actually suspicious and I had to get the manager to approve the transaction. They didn't call the cops and if they had, I wouldn't have expected to be put in cuffs. In fact, I've seen shoplifters get treated better when being interviewed. This is just shameful on the cops and with BMO, but especially the cops. They saw an ""Indian"" trying to access $30 grand and assumed he was guilty."

I just got new carpet put in my living room after years of living in places that had hardwood floors. I was (and am) very excited about this so yesterday before work I was feeling giddy and laid down on the floor to do ""carpet angels"" and the dogs were whooping it up because I was.

Great, my dogs are friendly and I can appreciate loving dogs but not being allowed to have them as a child so I allow the kids to play with them. Well, it took not even 15 minutes before I had to put a stop to that. These kids had been taught that dogs were interactive toys that you could dress up, order around and force them to go places they didn't want to go. At one point, during this, my younger dog looked back at me watching all this with pleading eyes because these kids thought it was funny to stand in their way repeatedly when they tried to walk someplace. I had to firmly tell them that play time was over and that dogs weren't toys and to treat them with respect. ""Would you like it if I blocked your way when you were trying to go somewhere?"". They were good kids though and apologized. Still didn't get to play with the dogs again, but I'm glad they learned their lesson before they got bit by other, less patient, dogs."

The one that crashed in the sea, there was a missile conspiracy that a US destroyer or something shot it down. Turned out to be false. There has been a few where witnesses saw the plane going down in flames and it was either mistaken or they viewed it after the plane broke up. An alternate theory when a plane drops out of the sky is explosive decompression which has killed a lot of people. The OP is right. It's best to take the info in the first couple of days with a grain of salt.

I don't speak to my mother for different reasons but one of them is for the constant guilt trips she would try to do on me. Like she seriously used to say ""If you loved your mother, you would..."" to her child. Who does that shit? It was so bad it altered my personality where, for a long while, I used to get very angry at anyone who would try to use that tactic on me to try to get me to do something. So much so that, even if I had no problem or even wanted to do it before, I would do the exact opposite to prove a point. It became very hard not to go overboard and I, admittedly, wasn't a very nice person when it came to that.
