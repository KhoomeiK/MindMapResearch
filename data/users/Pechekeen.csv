childfree,fgkvo6a,t1_fgkrt6s,1580874678.0,"We all have different views but my personal view is the carbon footprint from every child is too much, even “just” one. Our planet is in bad shape. I don’t think it’s fair to the earth and I don’t think it’s fair to bring children into the world as it is right now. Adopt the ones already here. I worry about our future, about climate change and species dying out. About another war or another disease we have to fear. No time is a “perfect” time to have kids but it sure as heck isn’t right now."

childfree,fgkuw0y,t1_fgkrjky,1580874146.0,"“Nature called” me too! I think more CF people need to keep this in mind that it can happen instead of denying it exists. Just because it exists doesn’t mean we give up. I think if I would’ve known earlier I would’ve been more prepared to deal with it, but I fought like hell too because I knew this isn’t what I want!

There’s very, very few of us on this sub that have even mentioned it."
childfree,fgkuag6,t1_fgkta6t,1580873760.0,That’s how my mom was too with kids so she was really nice and understanding when I told her I’m not having any. I think it’s cool you support your loved ones like that.
childfree,fgkocq7,t3_ez115z,1580870074.0,"I think of children as spiders. I find them unpleasant and it makes me uneasy to be around them. My day is noticeably brighter when I don’t have to see any. 

But they’re a living thing that have just as much right to this world as I do. I would never harm any living thing. I’m not a threat to your children. I’m not some monster just because I dislike children."

I’m not saying it’s impossible, I’m saying compared to literally any wedding planning book out there with timelines, anything under 1yr falls into “rushed” category. The best venues, photographers and cake bakers even fill up much earlier than that."

Frugal,fgki7oh,t1_fgkh6da,1580866154.0,My husband’s almost the same way! He’s an admittedly picky eater so it took a lot of different preparation to show him vegetables taste good. He grew up eating veg from a can so he had a bias. Now one of his favorite snacks are oven roasted carrots! They “taste like chips” haha
Frugal,fgkhvkl,t1_fgkfauh,1580865933.0,I unfortunately don’t live near a store that allows bulk spices. I get those expensive glass bottles of McCormick that never last. I’m thinking about trying to order spices online though!

AmItheAsshole,fgkc6yd,t1_fgkbi5r,1580862169.0,"Your first judgement reply was your personal experience that “NOOBODY” could tell you owned pets. You took OP’s reasons for not wanting a pet and disregarded them because it doesn’t fit your life. Is OP TA simply because her life is different than yours then? Her excuse for not wanting pets is just as valid as you wanting yours, I say this as a pet owner.

I don’t care about your judgement, just remember we’re talking to another person."
AmItheAsshole,fgkbewt,t1_fgkaueq,1580861659.0,"The rules state OP must accept their judgement but us commenters aren’t allowed to bully OP either. Knock it off. Pets are a chore, a chore some people choose to accept because we want pets. You’re taking it personally."
AmItheAsshole,fgk9e8w,t3_eyslcc,1580860348.0,"You’re obviously NTA but they make thermo bloomers to go under skirts to keep your butt and thighs still warm, could be an option. You would have to order them online though because most brands are from Japan. I hate pants too but live in a frigid climate so I wear those and cute knit leg warmers with my boots. Skirts in a sturdier material help as well! My winter skirts are a wool blend. Lace is a no-go for winter, you were right not to let her wear it."

AmItheAsshole,fgjy7hr,t1_fgisxvf,1580853717.0,"Seven months is barely enough time to order a wedding dress, in fact some designers it wouldn’t be possible because the cutoff is 6-8 months in advance. So yes it’s a rushed wedding. Venues get booked a year in advance. Look at any wedding planner, the timeline for a wedding is 1-2 years."

There’s no professionalism and he gets off on being the bully to another bully. I’ve had some bad managers, none were ever this stupid. Yes it’s entirely possible to work your way up from a dishwasher, normally to cook and finally a manager. I just don’t believe the rest of it. There are good managers out there that stand up for the underdog, those people aren’t on here writing justice revenge stories about it."
childfree,fgjjsc8,t1_fgj2o23,1580845505.0,Every example of parenthood he’s giving are those kodak moments everyone posts on Facebook. That’s like the 5% of parenthood. Your examples are more based in reality.

badwomensanatomy,fgiw776,t1_fgie58a,1580832236.0,"Sorry for tmi! Just wanted to address sore or boring part.

Roleplay scenarios keep it fun. The mental stimulation from acting out a fantasy combined with the physical stimulation makes it exciting and entertaining. My husband and I spend 2-4hrs. There’s no tearing or soreness. I’d be bored out of my damn mind if he was just jackhammering away and not engaging me."

I’ve simplified my meals so I don’t have any excuses, they literally take five minutes to prep and get tossed in the oven. My problem was getting off work and being too tired and hungry to cook! It’s a work in progress, going to be experiencing with slow cooker recipes as well. I just want a hot meal after work."
BJD,fghnwmj,t1_fghk2s5,1580789201.0,"Ahh I see. They’re a cute child’s doll. Ok they don’t list their measurements anywhere but from seeing a nude body it appears they’re not very skinny. They should be compatible with the most common size of doll clothes. This is a little tricky to explain because we go by certain dolls when mentioning size and so do clothing sellers. The doll you want to buy looks compatible with Super Dollfie(SD for short) so look for that in the name when the clothing designer mentions dolls the clothes can fit. SD, SD10, SD9 or SD13 are also used when mentioning fit. Some clothing designers will simply say “1/3”, which is the 60cm height your doll is. Just look for clothing that doesn’t feature a very skinny doll as the model.

The clothing for your doll is sweet lolita inspired, fluffy and girly princess clothes. These are popular in BJD so you shouldn’t have trouble finding them at all. There’s even a section for it.

If you want more casual looking clothes there’s plenty of those too! I’ve personally ordered from all four of those sites, zero problems with payment or shipping. They also sell some of the finest wigs. I vouch for Leekeworld brand wigs, they’re beautiful and stay looking nice for years. They sell beautiful Leekeworld shoes too."
