depression,feki9z6,t1_fekhmvm,1579200611.0,Yes... I can tell by your name that you're from Finland...
depression,fekhgvg,t3_epmgz5,1579200130.0,"I live in Helsinki. Have had snow for a couple of days this whole winter thus far. It's been raining a lot past days. The weather forecast doesn't tip the temperature below freezing the coming week, even at nights. 

Around christmas I visited Estonia and we could still gather some frest vedgetables from the field. Driving in the countryside some fields had already started sprouting. 

I'm old enough to remember white christmas, and I have noticed an almost steady decline in the amont of snow each winter."
hoi4,fek9ihr,t3_ephq5f,1579195411.0,"Start with smaller countries and think about trying to play safe countries. Maybe, for example, playing australia or new zealand or canada in a historic game and supporting the allies in the war would help you introduce to different parts of the game. It's easier to learn when you're safe."
MechanicAdvice,fegptii,t3_ep2nvy,1579099678.0,Probably a wiring problem. Did you install the radio or did someone else? Could be a couple of reasons why incorrect wiring would cause this but I couldn't find the cars wiring diagram with 5 minutes of googling and I CBA to look any longer.
KerbalSpaceProgram,feggr6n,t3_ep1gil,1579092229.0,"I would recommend making a savegame checkpoint and try different things. 

I don't remember how and why, but I once got out of my capsule and pushed it by hand. I don't remember how exactly I did it and how useful it was, but I  basically just used the jetpack monopropellant to push the ship. I don't know how much speed you can gain from doing that, but probably something. 

Other idea I have is to see how close you can get to kerbin and at the same time build a rescue ship. If you time things perfectly then you can shoot your rescue ship into space so that it meets your capsule while it's close to kerbin on it's highly elliptical orbit. It wouldn't be easy to dock craft at that speed (depends on how close you can get), but you could do it and transfer the crew. I would assume that the rescue ship would have some morsels of food on board so at that point you wouldn't be having a problem with time."
hoi4,fegbem4,t3_eonscv,1579086190.0,They have basically no AA on their ships
BattlefieldV,feg91hp,t3_eosxtf,1579082876.0,"The assault class can't be too deadly against vehicles because it's already good against infantry and thus very popular. They should have had more classes like in BF2, where there was an AT class that was quite a bit worse against infantry. This meant that those who wanted to go against tanks had a chance, but the world wasn't filled with AT weapons."
BattlefieldV,feg4k83,t3_eoouy5,1579076613.0,"I have recently been burned by bethesda twice even though I forgave them the first time. I promised not to trust them again. This has made it difficult for me to give a game dev company a second chance as easily as I did to bethesda. BFV has damaged my opinion of DICE and it's leadership, just as FO76 damaged my opinion of bethesda and it's leadership. If the leadership and the people making the decisions doesn't change, then I will have trouble regaining my trust.

Right now, I wouldn't pre-order the next BF game, regardless of what they promise it to be or show in the trailers, because we clearly can't expect for any of it to be true.

Dice could salvage all of this, but I feel that their leadership is trying to force them in a specific direction that's not at all aligned with what BF should be. That's why I won't trust DICE until there are major changes in it's organization.

The TTK fiasco has even more shown that DICE either doesn't know or can't be bothered to make a multiplayer FPS. They try to bring balance by just fiddling with numbers. The balance should be adjusted in other ways in a game as complex as this."
hoi4,feeqmv2,t1_feepwjz,1579039144.0,"So what? Exit game to menu (to ensure it's saved). Go to savegame folder in windows explorer. Make a copy of your save file. Rename the copy to something descriptive, like ""AboutToGoToWar"". Continue the game with the original savegame file. 

When you want to revert to an earlier state: Go to main menu. Make a copy of the backup/checkpoint and rename it to whatever, like ""game1"" and then continue the game using that save file.

It's a bit of work but works. I'm not even ashamed of doing this. Quite often I only play because I try to achieve something specific, but if something goes wrong I could suddenly lose hours of work. So I either have to use this ""workaround"" or not play the game at all."
hoi4,fedhyqx,t3_eocrd3,1579011998.0,Did you forget screens?
hoi4,fedhpuc,t3_eodta3,1579011814.0,"Save the game, choose the upper option and see what happens. If you don't like what happens, then revert and try the other option."
BattlefieldV,fedaskq,t3_eok99t,1579005984.0,I would add a rule that it only 1 shots if you're not spotted and the enemy can't see you.
hoi4,fdw21ww,t3_en6ent,1578754200.0,"I'm not surprised. I actually was going to try and see if I can sink the whole japanese navy with a handful of subs, but I guess I don't have to do that now. The starting japanese navy doesn't have a single ship with anti submarine capabilities and only some of the larger ships have AA guns. If they can't fight against subs then the subs can basically do whatever they want."
BattlefieldV,fdvx4hi,t1_fdvn56b,1578752698.0,"Well, one thing is that everyone learned to play the game one way and played it like that for a year and now they have to re-learn the game again. This somewhat has to do with how dice has implemented weapons recoil. They made the weapons perform differently and recoil differently. For best results you would have to learn to control your weapon. Having to shoot at some people longer messes with the learned pattern and those who have already played the game a lot suddenly see that the game doesn't work anymore, and get frustrated because the game isn't doing what they expect. The weapons don't behave as they expect. This sure can all be re-learned in time."
BattlefieldV,fdvmg7f,t1_fdvaz96,1578749026.0,Understandable. I'm not advocating for it. I just brought up an example that might frustrate people and where you can't adjust the TTK.
BattlefieldV,fdvm8n6,t1_fdvbicy,1578748944.0,"Yes, it IS nice to be able to react to being shot at. I just learned to stay near cover and jumped for it as soon as I was being shot at. I ever only didn't have enough time to do that when the death was caused by netcode issues."
BattlefieldV,fdrtkc5,t3_emsj3i,1578689553.0,">They don't go around changing button locations, behaviors, removing stuff, adding stuff just like that. If you log in to Reddit, you know exactly where to go. You don't spend your time re-learning the platform because the designers at Reddit felt like putting your inbox in the bottom left corner. What DICE did is going to the very core of the game and carpet-modifying it in a way that forced users to forget about everything they've learned for an entire year and training themselves to learn it again, not only that, the new experience is terrible. 

This is why people don't like the new ttk. Forcing us to re-learn the game"

MechanicAdvice,fdmzphp,t1_fdmygzm,1578572663.0,The story above is of such a car breaking down a couple of months after purchase. Doesnt sound too reliable.
MechanicAdvice,fdmy6q2,t3_em8efl,1578571026.0,"Maybe Jimmy should get an electric car. No emissions, no cats, no smog tests."
BattlefieldV,fdmsyhd,t3_elw38q,1578564249.0,"Not necessarily. There is a lot of balancing that should be done, but it's not that simple. Besides, DICE want's to reward good players so if you're good you should be rewarded for it. Balancing isn't that simple. You just can't make AT more deadly and you can't make infantry AT work at longer range because then you'll get the fliegerfaust problem where everyone starts sniping tanks. I think I know how to balance a lot of the gameplay and infantry vs vehicle problems, but it'd be a very long post. I think I'll start working on it at some point and call it ""balancing gameplay for dummies(DICE)""."
BattlefieldV,fdkl8hs,t1_fdkbi3d,1578505864.0,They delayed the tank customization because of technical issues too.

hoi4,fdefk4m,t1_fdeenc6,1578337933.0,When facing the problem with guarantees I usually make fake declarations on nations I don't care about until they both have 2-3 guarantees and then it's usually safe to justify. If not then you can load a checkpoint and get them to guarantee an additional country (even in ironman).
MechanicAdvice,fdef4vv,t1_fdeeh5l,1578337668.0,I believe he's talking about coating the underside of the car in some sort of a protective paint/spray/thing that protects the chassis from rusting.
hoi4,fddbcpc,t1_fdc08f9,1578303874.0,"While teh AI is dumb for sure, my comment on the strength of the navy is based on the quality of their starting ships. They have very poor destroyers and basically no AA and literally no anti-sub measures. Their bigger ships are quite ok, but if you destroy the screens the capital ships are lost. As USA I destroy the japanese navy within a month or weeks fromthe start of the war. I would assume that they don't run out of fuel that fast."

MechanicAdvice,fcyfmns,t1_fcyd9j3,1578079392.0,"Are the red circles also indicating damage? Unfortunately I'm not a mechanic by trade but by experience and my experience is from older and simpler cars so I can't identify all those hoses based on a picture.

Technically if it's a vacuum line you could maybe try patch it up with a tape that can handle the heat of an engine and is airtight, but if it's a vacuum line then it's even easier to just replace the line.

How did you notice the damage? Did you try running the car?"
MechanicAdvice,fcye16d,t3_ejh9to,1578078671.0,I think that's just boiling coolant that's turning into gas escaping the hose  and when you place it in water it makes that sound. Checking the thermostat is probably your wisest move next.
MechanicAdvice,fcycram,t1_fcy5owp,1578078152.0,"Maybe. I generally wouldn't recommend used tires, but if you're getting new ones anyway, see if there's a cheap used one somewhere. Just make sure it's not in a too bad state. Also to consider is that having different tires on different sides of the car can affect the handling of the car negatively, especially in poor weather. 

I would also recommend tring to figure out why your tires went flat. Fill them with air and put some soap water on them and see if there are any bubbles anywhere indicating a leak. If you can find the problem in both of the tires you can evaluate whether you just have 2 bad tires or there's some other issue."
MechanicAdvice,fcybptm,t3_ejjiaf,1578077767.0,"The brake bleed valve is the dark out of focus thing on the right. It's a portruding thing and it should have a plastic cap on it to protect it from dirt. If you're quesitoning which direction the bolts go then perhaps you're not qualified to do whatever you want to do with the brake bleed valve. But here's a tip. People these days are used to removing caps from bottles. Imagine that the bolt is a bottle cap on a bottle and try to twist it off. That's the way you should be turning it to remove it. Yes, that's counter clockwise."
MechanicAdvice,fcyb0fs,t3_ejjqew,1578077425.0,Is that a vacuum line? Can't you just pull the piece out and replece with a new piece of hose?
hoi4,fcvndx9,t1_fcvdvuq,1578005840.0,"Based on experience. I played USA with intention of killing japan fast many times. I simply slaughtered their fleet. I had no idea why or how but I didn't even need to build much more ships or anything. I figured I'm just a boss at navys. 

Then I tried doing the same with USA as japan. I built some more ships than before and I got dessemated. I later checked the design of the ships and it was just pitiful.

Excluding submarines you start off with 142 ships. about 20% of them are so poorly designed that I wouldn't trust them with any task at all (1x lvl1 light battery, 1 lvl1 torpedo tubes and that's it), none have sonar, almost all ships are ""early"" designs and carry ""lvl 1"" guns and 17 ships of the 142 have at least 1 AA gun. that means that the rest have none whatsoever.

The ships that I wouldn't trust with anything are destroyers so they have really poor and weak escorts, no AA cover and no submarine screens ( no sonar). Souns like a juicy target for the USA navy."
hoi4,fcvl8sk,t1_fcuzixv,1578004503.0,You should be proud of such an achievment.
MechanicAdvice,fcrongf,t3_eiloes,1577904559.0,I faced a similar issue once. How have you lifted your car? Is one wheel in the air? Sway bars can be installed without much difficulty. The point of the sway bar is to pull down on one side of the other side is much higher. If one wheel is lower than the other then the seat bar will pull down just like its supposed to.

BattlefieldV,fc1zv4f,t1_fc0y0me,1577335038.0,Mmgs do quite a bit of damage already. it's just that compared to bf1 you don't have a lot of time to do much damage.

MechanicAdvice,fbhk7sm,t3_edffng,1576875627.0,"Here's what I would recommend you do: 

Be in 5th gear and start braking with the gear engaged.  
When rpm start getting low, shift to neutral and release the clutch while in neutral (you don't want to stand on the clutch for long time, you can release the clutch while in neutral)  
When you need to start going again, shift into whatever gear you think you should be at in that speed and start driving. So if you've come to a stop then go 1st gear, and if you're still moving then shift to whatever (like 2,3 or 4 depending on your speed).

So just put the car in neutral and come to a stop. Do not go 5-4-3-2-1 because that would mean unneccessarily engaging the gears and the clutch multiple times for no reason other than maybe engine braking."
