AskReddit,ff8l8n9,t3_es1gaf,1579683947.0,"When I first attended college I had no idea of what I wanted to study. College gave me somewhere to be so there I was. However, I often wanted to take classes that weren't required for my program of study. So when I would be refused the classes I wanted I would change programs so I could take that I wanted. This meant that I changed programs every semester. This resulted in my second and third senior years (six years total 189 undergraduate credits (typical graduation is somewhere in the neighborhood of \~125)). During my second senior year I got pulled aside by the Vice President of Academic Affairs.

VP: You need to know that we've change the rule about changing programs. If you change your program you default into the most recent catalog. This means you'll have to meet the new requirements, whatever those are.

Me: I can see how that's going to affect everyone who enrolls from here on out, but that rule isn't in MY catalog and won't apply to me unless I break enrollment.

Turns out I was right. I changed programs that semester, the next semester, and for a final time during the fall of my senior semester where I went back into the teaching program so I could graduate.

Interestingly I eventually returned to the college as the registrar. The person who has to track those programs of study on each student. Needless to say I had a unique viewpoint for the job. And yes that rule was still in affect."

Beat yourself up about raising such a child. Tell said child you are beating yourself up because of him. If none of these things sound reasonable it's because they're not. Let your kid decide how he wants to spend his down time. Maybe actually sit down and play whatever game he's playing and talk to him.

As extraordinary as he was, I guess it wasn't enough because after he died I found out that he lied about a bunch of things. Important things. Unimportant things. 

The thing about lies is that it throws everything into question. I found myself wondering if he really loved me or if that was just another of his lies. I really wish I could give him a universal olly, olly oxen free and have him tell me what was true and what was a lie. Because I want to know him.
