pagan,fevnelf,t1_fergaii,1579399320.0,Thank you! The pagan heart is particularly full of kindness and love. Bright Blessings to you and yours.
pagan,fevn6vl,t1_fesosqw,1579399234.0,"Thank you for your kindness. This is one of the reasons I embrace paganism. Kind words and comfort from a stranger mean just as much as from a loved one. I hope your husband is well now. And wise words about taking care of myself. I’m one of those who will use up all I have for someone or something else. I have fibromyalgia and have lived with that for 17 years now. Can’t work, can’t do a lot I used to, but I can and will do what needs to be done for my mom. They are like 2 halves of a coin. Met in high school, been together now for over 60 years. I’m not just losing a dad, my mom is losing her soulmate. My hubby will take care of me while I take care of my mom. Your magic words have touched me and I am so grateful. Bright Blessing to you and yours, always."

Wicca,fchq2rc,t3_eh13vu,1577652925.0,"First, let me thank you a a mother and a pagan for allowing your daughter her freedom to choose. I have been a practicing pagan for many years, as have a number of my family. You will find that paganism is a very broad subject.  It embraces many cultures and pantheons, and many ways to worship. Like Christianity, it has many branches. To simplify, you do not have to be Wiccan to be a pagan. Wicca is the more traditional form of paganism, one that uses magic and more formalized ritual and study. To be a true practicioner of Wicca requires years of study and training, usually by an experienced mentor.  Being pagan, however, means that you follow the old calendar of the harvest festivals and specific times of worship. You may be drawn to a specific nationality, often based on your ancestry, for instance, I follow a Celtic pantheon as my heritage is anglo Irish.  You may be of Italian ancestry and have heard stories of the Strega Nona, the kitchen witch. Paganism allows both solo and group worship and activities. I am a solo worshiper, meaning I do not practice with a coven, but whenever possible, we celebrate one of the major pagan holidays with our pagan family and friends. Using magic is also not a requirement of paganism. There are some very superficial books out which I would avoid. Good authors to read are, Scott Cunningham, Raymond Buckland, Phyllis Curott, and Eileen Dugan. You can also go to witchvox.com the online worldwide pagan newspaper. They have articles, rituals, lessons, etc from around the world. Local pagan shops and communities post their contact info there. Paganism is any nature based faith. My experience has always been one of love and care and true friendship and willingness to be there for others as one of the best things paganism has to offer. Hope this helps you out. Bright Blessings to you and your family."
