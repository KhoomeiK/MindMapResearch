I highly doubt psychopath since you DO feel empathy as you said you get sad when a fictional character dies. 

&#x200B;

Grief hits people in different ways, I've seen patients family casually talking about their weekend minutes after a family member dies and their body is still in the next room, and I've had patients that have found their spouse dead on the floor when they get home from work and melt down into a hysterical mess than it's impossible for anyone to break them out of. 

&#x200B;

Everyone deals with death in their own way, some don't hit us as hard as others if at all, how the person died is also a big factor, was it expected? long drawn out disease that's allowed people to come to terms with things gradually so it's not like getting hit by a train when you find out.
