I snorted, shot it and took it sublingually, and if you're looking to k hole, my best suggestion (with this one, not any of the others since I haven't done them) is sublingual. Snorting was fun too, but never k holed."

whatsthisbug,ffcp0md,t1_ffco6in,1579804144.0,"I thought it was for a good while, but I've started to doubt if they are because theyre so small. Springtails supposedly are just big enough to see with the naked eye, but these arent. The biggest problem here is that since this is a halfway house type place i cant just call, and the people in the office really dont seem to give a shit. Theres supposed to be someone coming to spray this month, but idk if I'll be able to ask him to inspect or not. I do have one long shot theory that the existing pest control treatment did keep them at bay, but since I never know when the guy is coming the residual wore off. The guy that lived in my room before me had them spray the room once a month or however often they come, and it didnt start until a month or two afrer I moved into the room. I hope it works. Anyway thanks for your input!"

skateboarding,ffch3gc,t3_eqdspp,1579799323.0,"So it's been nearly a decade since I've skated regularly, and I bought a used board the other day cuz I wanna get back into it, and the GRIP on this motherfucker is *insane*. What happened with grip tape while I was gone? I literally skated for 30 minutes and tore a hole through my shoe (Nike SB, not some shitty walmart shoes), then through my sock, and then started tearing skin off my fucking foot. *In thirty minutes.* I wasn't even doing anything crazy, just some ollies, kickflips, heelflips, varial flips, just basic tricks trying to get the feel for the board back. I found out after this sesh that I have a habit of lightly brushing the deck with my fingertips when I'm about to do a trick. I know this because the skin on three of my fucking fingers was being torn off. Anyway I need to get some new shoes now, I tried putting a piece of cardboard in my shoe over the hole but that got shredded in like 10 minutes. Anyone have a recommendation for shoes that will hold up? Also any ideas for how I can like, idk weaken the grip tape or something lol it's way too grippy"

Methadone,ffbr8tp,t1_ffah4sj,1579779574.0,"Yeah just compare the ingredients, vitadone is bullshit.
