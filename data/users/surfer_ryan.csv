Will I say that the sex industry is perfect by any means, fuck no but your notion that all of these people are being mistreated and taken advantage of is a little ridiculous imo. Plenty of women come out of porn with viable incomes other than porn and aren't forced into the life of sex. Now are they steered in that direction yes, but do they have to stay in that industry no... perhaps the problem is that people think so poorly of them that they feel forced into the industry where they can be accepted... perhaps if we lessened the stigma, over being complete ass hats people might not be so scared to come out as an industry worker and become more productive members of society..."

If you just want a basic work station imo you can't really beat these price to performance to form factor. 

They are super quiet, reliable, and they just work. The intel spec ones (released this year) have a usb c on them the AMD ones do not have usb c (at least the 100 or so I've installed this year). However I still prefer the AMD ones for workstations. 

To get back to the fan though, they are pretty dang quiet I'd say quieter than any of the towers I have been replacing. Side note if you can find the monitor that goes with it they are also awesome as it makes it into an all in one and neatly hides the computer on the back of it.

Also you should be able to control the fan via a program. However I completely have forgotten what that program I used was.

Not only that but our shitty president told the Chinese good job thanks, which goes to show that is the status quo so America not so much better... they also wouldnt day one go around spreading panic, probably would be done faster but our emergency response times are pretty shitty on a large scale emergency. 

My entire point isnt that china is glorious, it's that this isn't a fucking bad thing pretty much no matter how you look at it because its better than nothing, and giving hope to the people of china is not about shitting all over them, it's showing them that the world does give a fuck, probably more than thier government.

AnimalsBeingBros,fffywwd,t1_fffnypd,1579894831.0,"Oof man that last line hits home real hard. I'm on the same boat... had a half lab half weimaraner that was my best friend and did literally everything I did that I would allow her. Hikes, skateboards, bike rides, trail rides, boat rides, surfing, paddle boarding, jetsking... doesn't matter what the activity was, if I said let's go she was at my heels, and the soul crushing moments that I took for myself she would wait at the door until I came home. She was my 18th birthday present and was the best thing I ever got myself. 

Dogs teach you a lot, unfortunately one of the things I never was able to learn from her was how to say goodbye."

So not almost everything... hmm it's almost like you got so upset you didn't think about the other stuff like you went on a rant of your own biased on a small part of my comment you read... I'm assuming you won't see the irony in that. Since you know my frustration and main point was not about florida man and it was directed towards the retarded ""tax system"" we have in place."
news,fffbi0r,t1_fff23mj,1579880307.0,"Can confirm... long time ago I was still smoking everyday and an experienced pot head, decided that it would be a good idea to mix up my already vaped bud into some peanut butter before a long flight... probably should not have gone for all of my vaped bud but hey it already was vaped how strong could a half ounce really be... So I finish up getting ready and packed (15minutes after consumption) was fine nothing to see here. Start riding, now it was early as fuck around 6:30am about 15 more minutes and I'm sitting at a light going huh I guess this will work better than I thought... then I get to the airport... ""Fuck what if the drug dogs can smell it and they think I am a drug mule!"" , ""what if I'm the first documented case of marijuana overdose??? I can't let my stoner friends down! I can't die its never happened... but what if it does...""

1 hour of the most paranoid I have ever been, and i get on the plane and I'm fucking ready to propel the plane into space with my mind... I have never been that high and on top of that I have still yet to be that high in public since... probably won't be either..."
AdviceAnimals,fffa4ty,t1_ffewrm6,1579879431.0,What you dont have a separate reddit account for all of your kinks? Maybe having 127 accounts is a bit much but you gotta see the big picture... which is thousands and thousands of pictures of porn.
FloridaMan,fff9onn,t1_fff1o5z,1579879141.0,"Does the government expect you to learn on your own accord the tax structure. Yup. 

Do the rich get massive tax breaks and massive tax returns... yup... 

Has turbo tax been caught up in some weird shit. Yup. 

Does the government teach you the tax system... nope... 

So other than not reading the article and assuming that this dude got a check that was a mistake over falsifying tax records I'm not really sure what you're getting on about... just that I'm wrong and should feel bad... why... care to elaborate? Or are just going to tell me I'm wrong and dont make any sense while not saying why ?"
FloridaMan,fff0y56,t1_ffeznu1,1579872651.0,"Why did the government strike him a check... sure he cheated the system but the billionaires in our country do this every year, I don't feel bad for the government they do not do enough for something that is so expected of us to do. 

Sure it was a ramble but I had just gotten up. I'm not writing a graded essay on reddit... So ""heyy fuck you"". You feel better about belittling someone for reasons..."
FloridaMan,ffezc7n,t3_et69i8,1579871216.0,"Okay... but if I send the government extra money does that mean I get to lock them up...

This is why I fucking hate the American tax system. No one teaches you shit about them, you're just expected to know. Then you're expected to be a fucking tax expert and file all the proper paperwork, or assume that turbotax is being honest and really giving you all the money they can or that they are filing properly. Oh and if you're super rich as fuck you do get this much back because you know (well YOU don't, you fucking plebs -IRS) massive tax breaks and write offs for things us plebs couldn't dream of. 

Then this dude who is below the poverty line, who probably isn't super educated... gets a check from the government, pretty much the only entity that you are told to trust blindly by our own fucking government and they fuck him for thier mistake... fuck you government this is on your dumb ass not this dude. He's not a tax expert and he's going to assume the government wouldn't make a mistake and wouldn't lie to him... (I'm well aware the government would do the above things but my point is that our government tells us it wouldn't.)"
