So I guess we can ask the hustlers for some help, before they start with their hustle. Sure enough they get us some mangoes and an adaptor and take us somewhere to eat local food which is pretty good. I notice the younger one is wearing a watch, make a mental note and wait for the hustle to begin. Sure enough our new best friends insist we go to their souvenir shop. I show him my decoy wallet full of useless Japanese loyalty cards and 20 Egyptian pounds in cash. I buy the cheapest tat in the shop with the filthy paper money, no hard currency in my wallet to be seen.
We promise to come back next day to buy more crappy Pharaoh carved heads.
They insist on following us back to our hotel, when we get inside the lobby I confront him about his lie with the watch, tell him I'm not ever giving him any money ever and I will have security throw him out ( this is the Sheraton Cairo) or worst. They back down and we go to bed.
Fucking amateurs.

Edit: Loved Egypt, loved the history and the culture. Intrigued by Cairo, would definitely go back.
Baksheesh wasn't too bad. Tour guide was a great guy.
I don't mind bit of hustle, people gotta eat and their scummy government doesn't care how they do that.

Edit: Having checked Google maps, Ella do indeed have a shop. It's in Shimo Kitazawa which is a little west of Shibuya. Been looking for vinyl in that part of Tokyo once or twice, the area is noted for record shops, but they tend to be over priced and a bit sniffy ( this is a somewhat pretentious neck of the woods, think East Village/Tribeca).
