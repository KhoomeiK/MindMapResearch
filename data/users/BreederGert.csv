dogpictures,fedy7gs,t1_fec0e64,1579022396.0,Thanks!! :)
dogpictures,fedy6b7,t1_febmjae,1579022376.0,Thank you so much :) my dad wasn’t too fond of them before but before he even officially met Bumi he already started warming up to him and now he loves the little rascal :)
dogpictures,fedy2ke,t1_fecp3rq,1579022314.0,His name was Bone before we adopted him and I wanted to rename him Scooby but my girlfriend suggested Bumi :)
stevenuniverse,fedx0gk,t3_eoe7by,1579021677.0,I made the mistake of drinking water when White yelled “That’s enough!” and almost choked. 10/10 meme
ShinyPokemon,fed6b1t,t1_fecu4sl,1579000978.0,Evolved him into Appletun :)
ShinyPokemon,fed3z20,t1_fecdz25,1578997655.0,Unfortunately no :/ my other one I hatched in a Friend Ball and like 60 eggs before this one hatched I decided to set up for a HA one with an Appletun I just caught the other day in an Ultra Ball...but I forgot to check what ball the new parent and babies were in and when I hatched him I realized he was in an Ultra Ball. Still a decent ball but I really wish it was FB
ShinyPokemon,fecddqn,t1_fecd7tx,1578971268.0,Thanks and I won’t :) he got hidden ability too :)

dogpictures,febmbma,t1_feblb96,1578960339.0,Thank you!!! :)
dogpictures,febm9go,t1_febaz1k,1578960311.0,Thanks and he is! That’s part of the reason I wanted to bring him into the interview office to meet him :) the people at the shelter said they didn’t have many dogs and cats left after the holidays and I was worried he might’ve gotten left behind just because he’s part pitbull so I wanted to give him a chance and instantly fell in love :) so many people think that pitbulls are inherently bad and it breaks my heart. He’s been a total sweetheart and they said at the shelter that he’s done well with kids and even kittens so I’m really hoping to change some peoples’ minds out there by showing them how good of a dog he is :)
dogpictures,feblqa4,t1_feb6k1i,1578960096.0,Thank you!! :) we’re inseparable:)

dogpictures,feav6yi,t1_feav3kf,1578952490.0,Thank you and we will :)
dogpictures,feauqxa,t1_featcvv,1578952353.0,Thanks and we decided that even if we couldn’t adopt him we wanted to sponsor him so he’d have a better chance of finding a forever home :) I still can’t believe that home is us :)
