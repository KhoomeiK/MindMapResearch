navy,ff7ilf9,t3_es3air,1579650400.0,"Okay, hear me out.  First of all, having the toilet like that in the ship would eliminate the need to clean up after shit stackers and piss sprayers.  All we would have to do is just mop and rinse it.  There would be no need for scrubbing, wiping, and all other BS that go along with keeping the conventional toilet sanitary.  Another advantage is that taking shit while you squat is so much easier than doing the deed while sitting on the toilet seat.  When you squat, you can focus all your asshole power to the single spot and squeeze your log out like you would do it through well-lubed anus.
