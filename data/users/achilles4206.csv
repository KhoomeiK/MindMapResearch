Set your alarm for a decent time in the morning with an hour window to walk your dog and eat breakfast. Whether that’s a smoothie or eggs, it sets up your appetite for the rest of the day, trust me.  Next. Walk the dog, starting with 15 mins, working up to 20 mins and now 30 mins a day. Your dog AND yard will thank you.


I wish you the best, it can get better but please give yourself some grace."
