depression,fc404oh,t1_fc3zxdz,1577403133.0,Have you tried a urologist?
depression,fc3wouo,t1_fc3rcz4,1577400564.0,Doctors aways say everything is fine or they say ok it is normal to wake up or they say if you put 2+2+2+2 together you are getting 8 hours of sleep they don't comprehend the damage that unbroken sleep does to you
depression,fc3wkxr,t1_fc3vciu,1577400484.0,Did that help you to stop waking up or you kept waking up?
SuicideWatch,fc3sdw6,t3_efyam6,1577397417.0,Im in the same boat fuck you 2019 🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻 2018 wasn’t this bad  im scared of 2020 i only got two choices live the hell im living or the door to suicide
depression,fc3rrr9,t1_fc3r2vl,1577396984.0,It is like seeing your life being wasted my dream is to be happy to be who i used to be im tired of going to the doctors having a blood test and everything coming out normal it is the same thing repeated my emotions are all gone have you gone to a urologist?
depression,fc3qrmp,t1_fc3qjza,1577396267.0,No matter whatI do I still wake up and I’m not emotionally well
SuicideWatch,f8x7lpc,t3_e2lxsf,1574910459.0,Wow it hit me because I also have the same mentality of making something either an album of music or a book and leave this world I wasn’t lucky either.  I can’t even enjoy music without a migraine destroying me. I’m going to the doctor to see what they can do if nothing changes I don’t think I’ll make it to 30. My teenager years were full of unhappiness i cannot go to 30. Im 20 now and i been suffering since 15.
