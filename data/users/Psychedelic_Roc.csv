AskReddit,ffxs0q6,t1_ffx2ac3,1580331279.0,"Children should be listened to about certain things like how something is affecting them. Especially if you're their parent and don't want them to develop mental problems. Ignoring them when they're telling you something is wrong is an extremely effective way of teaching them learned helplessness and low self esteem. 

Also, sometimes they have useful ideas. Just consider what they're saying for a second instead of immediately shooting it down because a young person said it. If you ignore them when they had what turned out to be the solution and still don't give them credit, they might internalize that attitude toward themselves of ""my thoughts are worthless even if they're useful, because I'm worthless"".

I know you're thinking more like kids just talking random bullshit online, but I wanted to point out the most important exceptions."

(I'm not arguing against people trying to create a strictly singular non-gendered third person pronoun, that would be a nice addition to English but it's hard because you can't force new grammar words. I'm arguing against people making up a pronoun that only applies to themselves and sounds like an internet username because it's just not how pronouns work. Maybe tell people to always use your name instead of pronouns? It would be hard to remember but it makes a lot more grammatical sense.)"

Even before the internet, being famous meant that hundreds or thousands or millions of people that you never personally met will hate you for whatever reason or no reason at all. The internet just makes it that much easier for people to send you hate.

I think the reason they don't talk about it is because that would certainly encourage more people to do it, knowing that it has been noticed and affects them. I also think that the most well-adjusted youtubers have some kind of method to cope with it.
