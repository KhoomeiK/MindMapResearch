AmItheAsshole,ffeevzq,t1_ffea9yg,1579845397.0,"There are accessibility software used such as screen readers for the visually impaired.  How you code your website makes a big difference too.  See a news article with a heading? The reader will read that first, with indications it's a heading, then read left to right on whats below it.   Ever hover over a button and it shows text? thats for the screen reader.    If you want to see an example, disable your css and javascript on a page.  See if the text is incoherent or somewhat readable.

This was a nightmare for these apps during the tech bubble days without any standardizations, css, the popularity of putting everything in flash and the heavy use of those 1x1 gif spacers.  Everything changed when Target got sued and lost BAD over their website accessibility about a decade ago.  Then people started getting serious about the W3C WAI standards (still in it's infancy at the time).
