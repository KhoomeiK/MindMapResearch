Reddit desperately needs to understand what legal precedent is.

Trial court opinions are *not* preferential. They have no binding effect and minimal persuasive sway over any other court or judge or opinion.

Appellate courts have precedential value over the courts over which they have appellate jurisdiction. Depending on the *nature* of the decision, it may be totally binding, such as in constitutional decisions. Or, the court is interpreting statutory law based on the legislature’s words and prior court decisions. They cannot make new law out of whole cloth in that case.

More importantly, they are not *creating* law.

> employers can do a background check and if your parents don’t meet certain criteria they can pay you less.

I don’t even know where to begin on this. First, it wouldn’t happen. Second, the argument from the court is that the plaintiff himself has lower earning capacity because his skills are set for certain jobs and education. An employer is hiring you *based* on your jobs and education."

I’ve got to hand it to ABC: they knew exactly what reaction they’d get from this headline and exactly what readers would think it means.

The lawyers are arguing for restitution for lost wages and compensation for lost earning potential. The calculation for this is dependent on age, how many future years of work would be left, and the potential for income based on education and experience.

A lifelong day laborer with no education or skills will have a vastly lower lost income calculation than a computer programmer, a business owner or a Hollywood celebrity.

Compensation for lost wages and future earnings is *not* punishment for committing a civil wrong."

news,fem244l,t1_fejej50,1579237254.0,"> Here's a direct question: in your jurisdiction, roughly what percentage of cases that involve initial felony charges ever go to trial?

Sorry, I didn't see this before.

Around the national average. Maybe 5-10%.  Possibly increased slightly by the public defender's office pushing cases forward and refusing to waive speedy trial rights (as they should).

But that doesn't really answer the question we've been asking because it doesn't tell us if those 90-95% of cases *should* have pled out or whether they were the product of undue coercion.

The reality is two fold: (1) there are guilty people in the world, and (2) innocent people are in fact coerced into taking deals.

So the questions then become: (1) are plea deals legitimate in theory/the abstract, and (2) are they legitimate in practice?

First, plea deals are legitimate -- academically and in and of themselves -- because a defendant is the master of his case.  If he wants to plead guilty, that is his right.  If he wants to negotiate, that is his right.  If he wants to stand trial, that is his right.  And within the folds of these rights is the right to plead to a specific crime and fight against or reject the rest.

Second, pleas often occur because the defendant did in fact commit *some* crime.  And so, if he has a competent attorney, his attorney will demand and gather all the evidence of his client's case and advise him of his realistic chances on proceeding to trial on the facts as they are known.  Most of the time this results in the defendant offering and pleading to the crime he did commit, with him being entitled to binding contingencies regarding jail time, probation, conditions, and so on.

Third, innocent people are coerced because they're afraid of the system; they are often people who have never been remotely involved in the system; and, they believe that whatever evidence the DA has will be used to falsely convict them, and so they plead to a nothing crime, often for no jail time.

That's a significant problem *in* the system.  Pleas should not be rushed or bullet pointed or treated as irritating hurdles to an early finish line and lunch.  Pleas should be deliberate and slow, with the defendant understanding the entire way that the constitution makes him the master of the courtroom because all procedures, facts, arguments and pronouncements must first bend to his constitutional and god given rights."

news,fel5j78,t1_fejdhfg,1579214512.0,"> What is unusual is a system that circumvents its own right to a fair trial by having 95% of criminal cases resolved by a behind-closed-doors 'negotiation' where justice is not done in daylight

This is fundamentally mistaken.

No one is being denied their right to a fair trial, and no pleas or settlements in criminal cases occur outside of the defendant's consent and understanding.

And a lawyer would never transmit a plea offer without having demanded and received all the evidence in the case.  Under the 6th amendment, lawyers are obligated to provide competent counsel and advice to their clients, which they cannot do without being informed of the factual posture of the case.

And only the defendant has the power to plead, which the court will accept if and only after admonishing him about his rights to trial, compulsory process, etc., and demonstrates he has knowingly and voluntarily entered in to the plea that promises X, Y and Z.

Doesn't need to be.

How?

>The potential for miscarriage of justice and corruption is enormous when things are done in the dark.

They're not being done in the dark.

The potential for miscarriage of justice is in getting scared defendants to plead.  The problem isn't in the plea itself.

>In that sort of environment it isn't hard to lean on an innocent party to take a lesser conviction out of fear, or to construct an outcome where a guilty person is convicted of the wrong crime in order to hurry things along.

This is absolutely true, which is why pleas themselves should not be efficient or quick, and should be done deliberately and slowly so the defendant understands the evidence against him, his rights, his probable chance of winning at trial, his chance of losing, and so on."
news,fel4an0,t1_fejej50,1579213753.0,">it's both 100% correct and 100% misleading.

Except it isn't.

Your argument seems to be that plea deals exist, but they are coercive.  They are coercive because people believe they will go to jail if they do not plead.  This is wrong because innocent persons feel the same coercion.

However, pleas occur on 95% of misdemeanors, just like felonies, where no jail time is contemplated by either the potential sentencing judge or the charging DA.  So it doesn't seem plea deals are the product of wrongful coercion.

The person who feels the pinch the most on a plea deal is the defendant who has committed some crime, and will cop to that crime, in exchange for a dismissal on the other counts.  The DA usually feels the pinch because he knows he likely can't carry his burden of proof at trial on many of the charges.

And, so plea deals are efficient and in everyone's interests."

This also isn't true.  In California, at the very least, prosecutors have qualified immunity when it comes to knowingly suppressing evidence of innocence.  There are also state bar rules regarding ethics in that realm.

news,fei0h62,t1_fehzgfx,1579127615.0,"> Plea deals exist because sentences are so severe.

This isn't true.  Plea deals occur on misdemeanor cases where no jail time is realistically involved.  Plea deals exist because you have a right to plead however you choose, and because people often make the calculus, especially when faced with evidence of proof of their guilt, to plead to one charge for reduced punishment rather than throw the dice with a jury.

Does that mean innocent people are coerced into taking deals?  Of course it does.  But that's a failure to modify and evolve the system related to *Brady* material and exculpatory evidence, not proof that plea deals are wrong in and of themselves.

>Plea to 2 years or get 25 years if convicted.

And why would you fear being convicted unless your lawyer is terrible or the evidence is stacking up against you, and not in your favor?"
news,fehw43g,t1_fehsrz0,1579125037.0,">That is completely fucking insane for a modern democracy.

Why?

You have a constitutional right — in the U.S. — to plead guilty or not guilty.

The DA has the power to bring charges s/he believes are supported by probable cause, even amending the complaint with new charges based on new information. 

The defense is entitled to argue that you are not guilty of the charged crime but of another crime.

Thus, the defendant is entitled to plead guilty to one charge or an amended charge offered by the DA and to reject charges for which he is not guilty.

And that’s why pleas are ethical and constitutional.
