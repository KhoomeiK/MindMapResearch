myfriendwantstoknow,fff77b6,t1_ffcsgmm,1579877454.0,Well this will create curiosity. I would think it'd be better to just lie or say it was a fling.

facepalm,ff3jd57,t1_ff3hm61,1579542289.0,At least you're bold.
TumblrInAction,ff0j2tn,t1_ff02q9s,1579469350.0,You too friend
TumblrInAction,fezpwdm,t1_fez4h3d,1579460172.0,You misinterpreted me and were hostile. You're a walking projection of hypocrisy.
TumblrInAction,fezpp4e,t1_fezdaxq,1579460105.0,Thanks for getting it.
TumblrInAction,fezplr3,t1_fez69ct,1579460071.0,That was the point because I misunderstood the comment.
TumblrInAction,fez1b7w,t1_feyt3a6,1579452992.0,Crazy backwards earth I guess. See edit.
TumblrInAction,fez181r,t1_feyrxva,1579452963.0,"Wow, hot take. First of all, you're in an echo chamber
Secondly I KNOW ITS BAD. See edit"
TumblrInAction,fez1191,t1_feyoguo,1579452910.0,"Yeah that was my point, see edit. I think I misunderstood the person I replied to."
TumblrInAction,fez0su6,t1_feyprsd,1579452864.0,Im a straight man actually and you all got my point of view backwards. See edit.
TumblrInAction,feyh60a,t1_feyf8ox,1579445493.0,"...which is good?

Edit: I know its not good. Which is why the comment is worded with a pause and as a question. Perhaps i misunderstood the comment im replying to,  but it seemed like they were saying it as a good thing.

You all read a question as a statement. Im proud of your ability to collectively not read."
relationship_advice,feastam,t1_fea9l6g,1578951898.0,Yeah what the hell was he thinking? Its so dumb im inclined to agree with other commenters that it's fake. But ya never know...
4chan,fear6rv,t1_fe93xqu,1578951497.0,"Oh that's ideal, but I'll bet you a million dollars it wont happen."
RelationshipAdviceNow,fdry60h,t1_fdrfnrv,1578691429.0,"Yeah I agree. At their age though its not really that obvious. 

And I guess swingers tend to trade as opposed to the whole cuckold thing."
RelationshipAdviceNow,fdresd1,t1_fdqkbrn,1578683565.0,Isn't the swinger community exactly where this belongs?
SubredditDrama,fdosizv,t1_fdokoru,1578611905.0,"It depends on the severity of the crime, intention, and the ability of the person to understand consequences. This kid could have been considered cogent enough to A) know what he was doing and B) Understand at least basically why it was wrong as early as 12, maybe earlier im not sure. But certainly at 15. Well into puberty."

AskReddit,fdit1c5,t1_fdir0ws,1578450395.0,"Well considering we have been talking past each other the whole time, I guess it makes sense that you think you're in a position to troll. I'm not mad really. I think you have said some pretty stupid shit and the fact that you act pretentious and wise like you're teaching me something deserves push back. 

All you've really said is ""you're wrong im right""
You told somebody they didnt know what a straw man is because they called out your straw man.

Frankly, I think you're in over your head. Acting like I want an audience when the only person voting on any of this is you. Downvote away Captain hay."
AskReddit,fdisftv,t1_fdgafot,1578450014.0,Well if it's free to play then it really just depends on how much you're willing to spend. I wasn't really talking about f2p. There is a line though. Ten dollars for one skin? Does it really have to cost that much for them to profit? I dont know. But I sure as hell am not going to drop 80 bucks to look cool
AskReddit,fdiq9s1,t1_fdiosp0,1578448621.0,"Funny how you start an argument only to eject because you're too good for it. ""Oh I didn't notice what you said because im already right""

Yet you still bother to respond. Weird flex but okay."
AskReddit,fdijz3e,t1_fdijqjh,1578444603.0,"I was intentionally mocking you with a straw man, as evidenced by my closing question. Furthermore, IDGAF about people buying shit or liking shit, again very obvious. 

You are intellectually devoid and illiterate."
AskReddit,fdg5uqz,t1_fdg1k77,1578381238.0,">If you only value things by their functional value and not the mental happiness something can bring you

this is not my argument, yet you spend your long nothing comment arguing against it. Do YOU know what a straw man is? If you'd like I can lay out the logic of my value system in this context very clearly. 

I have never said that use is the only metric by which you should value something. If something has a high functional value, then it should have a relative price. Something as mundane as a gun skin should not cost more than 50 cents or a buck maybe, and ideally it's included with the game. You realize gun skins started by being added by developers as part of the game? So now, they just charge money and make profit from image files. Meanwhile you can mod plenty of games, namely cs, to have whatever skin you want for free (only you can see it). 

The fact that we've even reached this point in a tangential argument is entirely your doing. What are YOU defending? people's free will? IDGAF bro, I have bought skins before. I'm not trying to hate on anybody (well maybe you, because you're a white knight) I just wanted to point out the flaw in the initial analogy. a flaw that leads to other people supporting what is imo unethical business practice.

Edit: oh yeah, and about being a shmuck. you reach that level of dis-enlightenment when you defend ""peoples choice to like things"" against somebody who is only trying to address a MINOR issue with somebody's rationalization of their purchase. In your world, people are not only allowed, but ENCOURAGED to think whatever bullshit they want, as long as it makes them happy. hows that for a straw man buddy"
AskReddit,fdg1h9t,t1_fdfbtrj,1578376564.0,"Yes, of course: criticizing analogies and valuing use over vanity is horrible and negative. You're intellectually devoid. Have fun with your strawmen!"
AskReddit,fdf4ic3,t1_fdcmxmx,1578353121.0,"Well im not saying you should feel bad. But would you really spend 200 dollars on a csgo skin? How much money would you spend on loot box keys before you felt bad? If anything is a scam its the fuckin loot boxes. If you pay even 5 or 10 bucks for the skin you want then whatever, but if youre going to hemorrhage money for vanity then yeah you're just getting scammed."
AskReddit,fdf495l,t1_fdct8ls,1578352953.0,"Well I'd make the same argument about overpriced brands. Though, the shirt still has more functional value even if it is overpriced. The shirt may be in vain but it also has real world function. The skin is literally just for vanity. I'm not saying vanity is bad, I'm just making distinctions. But yeah I missed the point because I don't 100 percent agree. You sound like you're deep into the sunken cost fallacy, justifying something to make yourself feel better about supporting sleazy business practice. If you actually enjoy paying for a skin then just do it. I've done it too. My point is that the value placed on something so insignificant to reality is grossly higher than it should be. I'm not saying you're a piece of shit for buying a skin. If anything you're just a schmuck but that depends on the weight you give it and the money you spend."
AskReddit,fdf3igh,t1_fddcvmv,1578352473.0,"Customization is fine and I agree with you. However, paying money for a skin seems a little excessive. And then you have loot boxes, which are not just excessive, they're blatant ploys. You should not have to pay hundreds of dollars to look a certain way in a video game. If that floats your boat then fine, but at a certain point I think you're just being a shmuck."
AskReddit,fdc7b60,t1_fdc1rtw,1578268511.0,"If you look at it that way then you miss the blatant truth that a shirt has functional value in your life. Even fashion has more function than a game skin.

I say this as somebody who also likes game skins. I think they're scams in the end, but you get what you pay for."
confession,fcggo19,t1_fcar7u2,1577639742.0,"Are you a wall? Because you think like a wall. I didn't say I forgave the kid. I'm talking about the nuance between hating a child and recognizing his awful behavior. Yeah he pushed him. The fact that he was paralyzed was the only accident. His intentions weren't good, they were childish. But they were not to ruin the kids body. 

You literally just showed me what i said AND misconstrued it. Are you a wall?"
confession,fcaq12q,t1_fcaoihl,1577574300.0,"You are why we do not tolerate vigilante justice. There's a fine line between acknowledging somebody's wrongdoings and never allowing them to live past them. People change and can often be rehabilitated; so, why are you treating this kid like a murderer? 

The nuance may seem unsympathetic, but it is important to understand. Everybody feels way worse for the kids who was paralyzed. The fact that it was a stupid accident resulting from an ill planned bully-prank just makes it a little more tragic. If the kid goes on to better himself then it's a little bit less tragic. If he goes on to do great things then it's actually both tragic and good, depending on which narrative you are viewing."
