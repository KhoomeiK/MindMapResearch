husky,fe9ktfh,t3_emphdm,1578938758.0,"Next to losing my husband years ago, losing my fur babies since then has been very hard. They hold such a special place in our hearts, because they are more than pets, they are our children. My deepest sympathy to you and your family. They are never forgotten because they will always live in our hearts."
aww,fe9k0cy,t3_emqh05,1578938501.0,"If that isn't the cutest fur baby ever (of course except for mine LOL). Every time I go into the kitchen, my girl thinks she is getting something. She will lay in front of the cabinets and just give you that look. Have to resist, but they are adorable. Have many years of love and happiness with your baby."
corgi,fe9jaz3,t3_enn11w,1578938075.0,So cute
husky,fda1fs9,t3_ejz81c,1578240606.0,"They are gorgeous. They are so loving once they get use to their environment. My girl was aloof at first, but then, look out. She loved to run and the snow (back in the 70's, when it did snow a lot), she was in heaven and loved being outside. Many years of love and happiness."
husky,fda0g6p,t3_ejx0kz,1578240293.0,My little girl was pretty good compared to these two rascals. She liked to dig in the snow instead of dirt.
husky,fcyydi0,t3_eiefyv,1578089810.0,My husky Princess was 16 when she passed away. We gave her lots of love and kisses. She was opinionated too the end. Many happy memories for sure.
corgi,fcyy2a5,t3_eizkqs,1578089609.0,OMG. What a cutie.
husky,fcyxxsp,t3_eixdl7,1578089528.0,Husky overload. It reminds me of when my Doberman had her litter of ten pups. I just wanted to snuggle with them. Yours are precious. ENJOY!!!!
aww,fcywwk1,t3_ejgf12,1578088868.0,It just goes to show how intelligent dogs really are.
husky,fcywn7n,t3_ej5okt,1578088703.0,"What a handsome boy. If people would research the breed they are interested in, they could make a better decision on which breed is best suited for them. Many years of love, happiness and doggie kisses."
aww,fcywax1,t3_eje4ww,1578088489.0,Adorable.
husky,fcr1pxd,t3_ei19za,1577895493.0,4 huskies. Oh boy! They must be a handful and a joy. I had one husky. She was a love with a definite opinion which you have 4 times over.
