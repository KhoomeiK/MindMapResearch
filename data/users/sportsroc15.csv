finance,ffcfuui,t1_ffceqyw,1579798561.0,To make a ‚ÄúGREATER ECONOMY‚Äù.  Duhh  ü§£
college,ffc78l8,t1_ffc6j8h,1579793149.0,Why would you do that to yourself ??
learnpython,ffau8mw,t3_eshuw3,1579744614.0,Good stuff man.  Everyone has given you some good tips and the best way to get better is to practice and that‚Äôs what you are doing.
MapPorn,ff4qcrz,t1_ff3u9gt,1579569906.0,It‚Äôs crazy because a lot of kids play soccer in elementary school
college,ff1zc55,t1_ff1t1tm,1579489701.0,Now THIS is a great idea.  Free college is the best college.  **Says the guy who is finishing his bachelors in computer science for free right now***
college,ff1yw55,t1_fezo2vi,1579489379.0,"Yeah the CC in my town does a test that is math writing reading before you can enroll but it‚Äôs just basically a placement test so they have a idea of what classes you might be ready for.  No big deal, it only takes a few hours and let‚Äôs you and them know where you are at educationally."
csMajors,fep5aox,t1_fenlpdv,1579312450.0,Same here.  I‚Äôve never ever listened to music while seriously studying for something.  I love music too much and can‚Äôt block it out.   I can have the TV on though.
EngineeringStudents,feezbxc,t1_feealnh,1579044545.0,Congrats. You made a great decision but yeah most of those Liberal Arts credits don‚Äôt correlate to an engineering degree.  It‚Äôs basically starting over as you said.
learnpython,fecf22d,t1_fe9pfnn,1578972380.0,Agreed.  For loops did not make sense to me at first.  The for x in x just threw me of.  Until I started saying the loop in clear English to myself like ‚ÄúFor element(x) in list: do something‚Äù.  Pretty simple.  Then I went back and read how to use for loops for different types.  Pretty awesome and things took off from there
learnprogramming,fdq0xud,t1_fdpmc86,1578649411.0,Both.  Ana Bell did most of them though.
college,fdp1qk0,t3_emi48w,1578617925.0,"I work with a couple guys that worked on the railroad for years.  They said it was really cool, paid well, you were able to travel(obviously).  Formal education is not for everyone.  If the career you want does not require a college degree, why get a college degree"
college,fdp06b4,t1_fdoqk6g,1578616879.0,"Data analytics and system administrator are two different careers.  For data analytics through programming (Computer Science would be the better choice). For sys admin.( IT would be the better choice).  You could still be a sys admin with a computer science degree but IT is more in that direction. 

As someone said. You will have to decide what career you want.  Not sure where you are in your degree progress but I would not declare a major at first.  Take some classes in both majors and see what you like better."
learnprogramming,fdcexk4,t1_fdcebut,1578273228.0,Every professor is different for different people. I learned okay from her because I‚Äôm pretty flexible but her delivery was just annoying to me.   Eric Grimson did the last few lectures and he was way better to listen to.
learnprogramming,fdcc98l,t3_ekhouk,1578271433.0,Ana Bell sucks at giving lectures too.  The information is good but her delivery is awful.
learnprogramming,fdcc5co,t3_ekhouk,1578271364.0,I watched all the lectures on YouTube last year.  It‚Äôs pretty good if you are a beginner.
college,fczi5ty,t3_ejor1j,1578101780.0,That‚Äôs crazy that they would put you in that situation being a transfer student.  I would call the transfer student office(whatever that is called).
FitFeetBabes,fcw1ds1,t3_eirugy,1578014896.0,So perfect
learnpython,fcow6vr,t3_eia22b,1577843246.0,Awesome. This is my next read.

learnpython,fclavwe,t1_fckj02m,1577743604.0,"Thank You for this.  It‚Äôs a great starting point.  

Gives a goal and puts a thought process to light."
EngineeringStudents,fbzxdag,t1_fbzwxtn,1577266799.0,This and you have a certain amount of time to drop a class and get all your money back.
