AskEurope,feyshzz,t1_fex8blc,1579450067.0,"Basically, think of Walmart as a giant gun store, that also sells everything else. They have the same licensing(Federal Firearms License) as a standard gun store, you have to go through the same background checks as any other gun store, etc. It's just that they have an entire sporting goods section, which has everything from archery equipment, to mountain bikes, to firearms, to camping equipment, to fishing equipment, etc. As for hunting rifles, we most likely have a lot bigger game than in the Netherlands, so we usually require larger firearms.
