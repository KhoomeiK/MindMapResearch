capetown,ffzh8o7,t1_ffzh0a1,1580379010.0,I tried that. I helped to a point. Then it didn't work. Because if you eat a standard high carb diet and you restricw calories for too long your metabolism slows. You gain weight quick or stall. On keto that doesn't happen because your body gets used to using your body fat for fuel so if you go into a defisit it just takes more body fat.
lmms,ffzgm3p,t3_evx8ne,1580378082.0,Pretty cool bro. Keep at it.

musicproduction,ffz27sn,t1_ffwv6p8,1580361577.0,"Thanx. To be honest, industrial from the 80/ early 90 were far better than what you hear today. I guess im trying to capture that spirit while forming my own style. Who knows, maybe one day I get good enough, do an album. 
I appreciate the good words."

keto,ffwq03b,t3_evldz1,1580308186.0,"What works for me is get good fatty meat, as much as I can at as low a price as I can, usually for the week. I eat about 500gr a day of that. I like pork loin/pork belly...

Butter, one block a week...

Cabbage with mayo, I cut it and fry it for 10 minutes, salt pepper, sometimes I'll add garlic and/ green pepper, 

I eat like this a lot because I'm kinda broke at the moment. So I'll have some fat pork, a piece of butter, about 30gr, and cabbage with mayo (tastes damn good).

I feel great btw. I went from bad diet straight to this and I haven't felt this good, possibly ever. I've lost 10kg since 1 December and got another 11kg to go. I don't work out at all, just walking to work and home every day."

DecidingToBeBetter,ffwnfgl,t1_ffwn8fe,1580306262.0,Me too. When I'm done with my cold shower the sun usually starts coming up just enought so I'll have a cup of strong black coffee and just enjoy those rays.
DecidingToBeBetter,ffwn0bq,t1_ffwmpbs,1580305936.0,"Definitely. The truth is that we can choose to think. And a lot of our problems can be fixed quite quickly, and a lot of what we thought were problems just instantly dissapear. Or we can just let our brain think on its own, which it does all the time. But the brain takes the easy rout, what is good for now, and what it deeps good for now is... What takes the least effort. Thinking consciously takes effort, it's hard, in the beginning it will drain you. But it's totally worth that effort."
DecidingToBeBetter,ffwm1z7,t1_ffwlmx1,1580305176.0,"Yea you know what else I've been finding very helpful is to lie in bed at night and think. Like really consciously think. Like if I did something stupid I'll think about that, how I felt, what I could have done differently etc, or if something bad happened then I'll think about what I can learn from it and just try to resolve it before I forget about it and it slips into my subconscious and starts influencing me. I think everything word for word, intentionally and it's been helping me a lot quite rapidly."
musicproduction,ffwltcd,t1_ffwlfn4,1580304981.0,Thanx. I was going for that. I have a few other songs also on my channel if you wanna check them out
DecidingToBeBetter,ffwkg0o,t3_evjalt,1580303855.0,"Honestly you don't need motivation at all. I used to be depressed and thought about suicide for a long time. Then I realized something... I don't feel good. And I don't want to feel bad. So I knew I wanted to change that. So I started doing things just because I knew they would be good for me to do. 

My phone is on my table so I need to get up in the morning when my alarm goes off. I get up at 7 every morning. First thing I do is drink a big glass of cold water. Doesn't feel good, but it's good for me, then take a piss, make my bed then straight in a cold shower. That is the hardest thing to do, I dread that cold water every morning. That's why I do it. Because I know I dread it and so if I can do that it makes me stronger. Start with the morning routine. It's just a start.

Also remember, you didn't ask to be born. If you don't see a reason for life then say to yourself... Life's meaningless, but I'm here. Might as well do some shit. And as meaningless as it might be, I don't feel good, and I don't want that"

selfimprovement,fewgkn1,t3_eqjlaf,1579410225.0,"Deleting your accounts won't lead to improvement. It's literally just the beginning step. If you want to improve you have to realize that it takes a lot of hard work, a lot of patience, and a lot of courage; and that is why most people stay the same.

I would say get rid of you accounts, keep one or two main ones, and choose a time every day to check them out. And stick to that plan. It's a good place to start if your an addict. And it will be difficult, and your brain will tell you you have to go check it out, it's important. All that BS. 

Next I would say to start journaling. About everything. You thoughts, fears, past experiences and actions that still weigh on you, your day, you future hopes... Do that every day for an hour and do it properly with real interest. You won't recognize yourself after a month.

Those are the first two steps that you need to take. For me it was you tube, I spent like four hours a day on there. I would say to myself but I'm learning new stuff, true, but it's new stuff I aint gonna ever use. Now I go on YouTube if I want to do something and need to figure it out or if I get a notification from the 6 channels I am now subscribed to."
