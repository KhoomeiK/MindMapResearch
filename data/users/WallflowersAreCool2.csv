Mostly, it was small bags of drugs, some found property like purses or wallets, and occasionally larger items like bicycles. Also the blood draws from DUIs that needed to go to the crime lab. Once even dozens of stolen pairs of DC shoes.  

The funniest story is this. The morning was too busy with other stuff, so we waited til around lunchtime to start the logins. The evidence officer was eating his lunch, and had piled in all the bags on his desk, ready for me. I began entering as he called out each item, case #, etc. 

He picked up one item, opened it up, and immediately jumped out of his chair screaming.  I jumped up and ran, too. When an officer runs, run!

He was super angry, and went stomping down the hall to the sergeant's office. I tagged along and learned that item was a large dildo - recovered from inside a male arrestee. That man had apparently been driving along, when he was stopped for an infraction. He was acting nervous, so the arresting officer had him exit the vehicle for a search. This item was discovered protruding from his backside.
