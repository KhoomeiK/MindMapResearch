When you're entangled to your thoughts, it's very hard to see the greater good of the world. This is why people contemplate suicide even when they have everything, because there in a different world than their peers. Whereas the heart knows that getting better and overcoming the fiends within your mind is a better solution for everyone. Overall, these perspectives intertwine together to your emotions. (This is why it is very hard to explain; emotions are complicated.) That's just my opinion on a matter like this, I think it differs for everyone else."

Then those type of people don't really care about you and don't start a relationship until the other person has respected you. Don't disrespect yourself just because certain people don't respect you, have respect for yourself. You're awesome! :)"
depression,fdbem5x,t1_fdbbx5d,1578256618.0,Also please don't undermine me for my lack of experience in relationships. This was just my long ass opinion :))))
depression,fdbbx5d,t3_ekby0j,1578255881.0," He is heartbroken to let you go. I'm sure he still loves you with all of his heart but can't handle your depression for much longer as he believes that no matter what he does, he can't make you happy and kills him to see that you're in immense pain or sadness. This was his attempt to show you just how depression can ruin relationships and make this as a wakeup call for you to get the help and support you need. (I know this is very peculiar but bear with me here.) The reason why he left is because he's a sensitive guy that has his own issues in life whether it be mental illness, academic performance, or even trauma and when he found out his girlfriend has minor or even major depression, he is simply overwhelmed and wants himself and the love of his life to be continously happy however a relationship where one is depressed and one that's sensitive never plans out because the one that's sensitive is afraid that their mental health will start to deteriorate (if you have someone with the same amount of hatred of this world as you do, the darkness becomes irrelevant) and thus this causes a disparity in the relationship which causes the relationship to fall apart. Now of course, this does not mean that your ex is a terrible person or a coward for leaving, he is so worried about you that it stresses him out to an extent where he feels this wasn't the person he fell in love with. But I'll have you know, you can win him back by showing him how hard you are working to better yourself (he also wouldn't have left if he believed you weren't trying to get better with your mental health issues.) But please don't despair, you can better yourself if you just change the way you see everything :)"
