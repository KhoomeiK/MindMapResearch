food,ff7l8z1,t3_erwmyq,1579652223.0,Looks like a sainsburys custard donut to me.
bipolar,ff2mywf,t3_eraq60,1579514042.0,Absolutely fantastic!!

bipolar,feefwai,t3_eoq96r,1579032927.0,That sounds like a really productive day! Congratulations on everything!
bipolar,feefemg,t3_eoqh0h,1579032637.0,Haha! I love/hate when social media reminds me that I’ve said some manic shit long ago.
bipolar,fe3xnx9,t3_enqfli,1578853816.0,Same here. I just don’t feel the same being on meds. My whole mind is an utter blur with no emotions or happiness. Plus I’ve gained like 70lbs
bipolar,fd2ggbo,t3_ejrnu8,1578146862.0,How are you coping being off them ?
bipolar,fd2bgdz,t3_ejnv98,1578144761.0,Manic me: How could any girl resist my good looks and charm!!!
bipolar,fcrfi2h,t1_fcrf2ak,1577901145.0,"Oh yeah it’s a real thing. For me it comes straight after mania subsides. Nothing seems really interesting at all, even talking to people is too much for me. I think when I’m back at work and I’m more active my brain will kick start. Happy new year!"
AmItheAsshole,fcrds3s,t3_eij1on,1577900466.0,"NTA Your house, you’re rules."
bipolar,fcrb170,t1_fcr9eww,1577899359.0,"Oh that sounds absolutely delightful, if there’s one thing I love about America is it’s landscapes! Seems like it will be a nice easy walk with lots to do. Hope you have lots of fun with your daughter and the puppy and in general I hope things get better."
leaves,fcr9wwh,t3_eij455,1577898900.0,"You rock man for not smoking. Parties can get pretty intense especially if you’re known as the stoner, lots of people expect you to smoke and if you don’t they get disappointed."
bipolar,fcr8i3j,t1_fcr7v83,1577898324.0,Still young as hell! Hell that sounds like a really fun day you’ve got yourself for you! Pokemon go is so fun! I play it myself in the warmer climates :) is there plenty of gyms in the park you’re going to? It’s great that you’ve got something to bond over with your kid!
bipolar,fcr6eev,t3_eijr83,1577897455.0,"I loved it when my bipolar put me in hospital for my birthday. I can remember my parents bringing in a cake for me to have and by then the mania subsided and I was depressed as fuck. I put the cake in the kitchen for everyone to eat and by 3 hours passed all the other patients had eaten all of it. For fucks sake.

Anyway happy birthday, how old are you? Got anything nice planned or is it a chilled day?"
bipolar,fcr5sdr,t1_fcr5j3d,1577897193.0,"That’s the thing, I’ve gotten past it a few times myself too but the old brain tries to trick me into thinking that I won’t because life externally and internally seems so hopeless. Thank you and a happy new year."
bipolar,fcr39b1,t1_fcp7t0n,1577896154.0,"I couldn’t face going out last night. All the looking back on the decade got me in a even worse depressive mood than I already was in so I commend you for going out. It’s really tough socialising when you’re not happy at all, for me I just want to be tucked away by myself not having to put on a facade.

That’s why I stayed inside and played Mario kart on my switch with my little sister instead."
CasualUK,fcr2ek1,t1_fcqyymr,1577895794.0,Anything involving heavy machinery. My dad used to work with a young lad when he worked at a steel works and they drug tested him and he was sacked. I know someone else who works on the railways who often gets drug tested too. When I worked at the NHS I never got drug tested.

bipolar,fcn3yst,t3_ehsuo7,1577802617.0,"You should definitely stop through your psychiatrist, like another commenter mentioned it can bring back symptoms, well it did for me, I ended up manic with psychotic features."
bipolar,fcmz6hu,t1_fcm2yu4,1577798388.0,"Oh dude I can remember before I was hospitalised I was posting manically on Facebook about bipolar, I even made a fundraiser for Mind a UK mental health charity. I managed to get £10 raised too and was proper chuffed. I regret it now because I was posting constantly and it was incredibly preachy. I was also making brash statements like ‘my iq is greater than Albert Einstein’s’ I was a hot mess. I may have to delete my Facebook at some point haha"
bipolar,fcmyl7c,t1_fcm0ay6,1577797767.0,"‘ I struggle to believe that new people especially in a romantic way will want to engage with me’

I feel this too. You’re not alone in thinking this. I’ve also been off for a long time too from work. I just feel like I’ve got nothing to bring to a relationship other than strain on the person. I’ve started to be okay just being single but at the same time I feel like I’m missing out on all the good couple things."
bipolar,fcmyb7q,t3_ehxdbt,1577797476.0,Still looking.
bipolar,fcmx14x,t3_ehxgw9,1577796064.0,Stripped off completely naked and put white paint all over myself and tried to camouflage into the wall. Was psychotic too. Pretty crazy.
bipolar,fcmimwd,t1_fcljt8v,1577776791.0,"I ended up just telling him the truth that I was bi polar and he actually was delighted that I told him because he saw potential in me. He thought I was just slacking off at first Cos I was doing my work really slowly, turns out he had some understanding of bipolar and was more than happy to let me recover in my own time."
bipolar,fckt4oz,t3_ehmjxp,1577732619.0,Stability January up until July then a massive manic and psychotic episode that lasted till August now I'm just depressed hoping one day I'll be stable again.
bipolar,fck4m30,t1_fck4hkq,1577716439.0,Feel a lot better!
bipolar,fcjywaa,t1_fcjcq0w,1577711011.0,"Haha thats totally what happened at my last interview. Was hypomanic and i totally seemed like a go getter like asking all the appropriate questions, i even asked for a tour around the shop and met all the workers. Fast forward 2 weeks when i actually start and im a depressed mess and i got called into the office to ask whats up. Still there 4 years later."
bipolar,fcjxdip,t1_fcikmjr,1577709200.0,I think I'm currently stuck in the not happy with existence. Im not depressed because i can do things and life isn't a constant missery but im just not happy at all most of the time.
bipolar,fcjwk03,t3_ehf1u4,1577708169.0,I think i might just do that. Thank you for the up and go!
Boomerhumour,fc9j4lq,t3_egq5dx,1577553419.0,Well what are you guys waiting for?!
BipolarReddit,fc931zj,t3_egb6nj,1577546221.0,Great story. Glad you're doing well!
bipolar,fby63ik,t3_ef3ngw,1577208997.0,"Yup this is totally correct. I thought living in a cold rainy country in a city which is busy made me worse. It turns out even where ever you go either the depression or mania is gonna follow.

Try and not stay inside. Get yourself out seeing the place and know that you don’t have any expectations. Hope you have a good holiday!"
