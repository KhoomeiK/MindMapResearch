I have no idea where I originally found this quote, but it's been on my wall since I started college and serves me well when I need it the most."
entj,ffplk16,t1_ffp9u14,1580098046.0,"We may be using different definitions of cynicism.

Here's wiki's take on cynicism, which aligns with my understanding of the word. I added a bit where it discusses that skepticism and cynicism are not the same thing.

Cynicism is a wasted effort because it seeks no solution. The effort spent being cynical is the effort wasted. Instead, it could have been spent improving the situation, finding a solution, or finding a way out of the situation altogether.

>Cynicism is an attitude characterized by a general distrust of others' motives.[1] A cynic may have a general lack of faith or hope in the human species or people motivated by ambition, desire, greed, gratification, materialism, goals, and opinions that a cynic perceives as vain, unobtainable, or ultimately meaningless and therefore deserving of ridicule or admonishment. The term originally derives from the ancient Greek philosophers, the Cynics, who rejected all conventions, whether of religion, manners, housing, dress, or decency, instead advocating the pursuit of virtue in accordance with a simple and idealistic way of life.

>Cynicism is often confused with skepticism,[2] perhaps due to either inexperience or the belief that man is innately good. Thus, contemporary usage incorporates both a form of jaded prudence (when misapplied) and realistic criticism or skepticism."
entj,ffozueo,t1_ffmhzhu,1580083763.0,"Well, as an entj, I don’t like working with cynical people. They bring the mood down, cynicism can be contagious and slowly eat up moral like a cancer. I keep cynical people at arm’s length, and I play up the Pollyanna as a social cue that I’m not interested in engaging in negativity. Perhaps your entj coworkers are doing something similar in response to your cynicism. I find ENTJs to be rather upbeat and optimistic as a general rule. Realistic, yes. Cynical, not really. It’s a waste of effort."
entj,ffka28m,t3_etp3fk,1580019414.0,"What a great question!

The most permanent way to learn is to engage as many senses as you can. In this way, your brain will create new neural pathways to the learned thing. Some from visual, some from auditory, etc. The more neural pathways you make to the object, the easier it is to access that material when you need it. So I do little tricks like wearing a particular perfume and holding my wrist near my nose in class (and tests) or chewing a particular flavor gum for a subject, explaining the material out loud to people, etc. Another useful tip is to hijack pre-formed normal pathways by thinking about what things the new information is like or dislike and then categorizing those differences or similarities.

As for thinking itself, that’s harder to pinpoint. I have a “generator” in the back of mind that I call my Ni. Sometimes it has an instant solution, and other times it takes awhile. I have to slow down my thinking to pinpoint exactly why I have a solution in mind for a problem. I prefer to let the Ni just work in the background because I trust it to do its thing, but I can stop and slow down if someone needs me to.

For the most part, I have a pretty quiet mind - I don’t think in sentences. Nor do I think in pictures entirely. It’s more like rapid fire flashes of a lot of information at once if I’m actively thinking. I use writing, lists, conversation, and voice memos if I need to slow down and really work through something. It’s rare for me to think conversationally with myself, but this is something other people do a lot. The plus side is that I don’t have a negative internal voice which some people suffer from."

dogs,ffg8yel,t1_fffx045,1579901023.0,"I will say that, in my experience with poodle handlers in classes, I think you guys would be most equipped to handle a terrier.

Poodles and terriers are both highly intelligent in that problem-solving, hunting dog way. They also both seem to have very individual personalities and will make up their own mind about things. If you can channel a poodle to be a great working dog, I think you could certainly do the same with a terrier. But no matter how obedient my terriers have been, I will never trust them off leash in the outdoors. A running squirrel will trigger their prey drive, and they forget themselves and take chase."
dogs,ffg6yax,t1_fffoksk,1579899784.0,"Ha, agreed! The best trainer we ever worked with had a spitz dog, also a think-outside-the-box training breed.

I usually tell people to imagine you’re hosting for Thanksgiving. It’s crunch time, the hour before guests arrive. You’re knee deep in side dishes all needing attention at once. Your dog comes inside, grinning, covered in mud because he decided it was the perfect day to dig a hole. Your freshly cleaned floors are covered in mud as he carelessly trots around the house.

If you respond to that situation by laughing and shaking your head, you have what it takes to own a terrier."
dogs,ffel0nw,t1_ffd6s2d,1579852500.0,"This is such a good point though.

I wouldn’t even really trust anyone in my life to watch her while I’m out of town. If you don’t understand terriers, they will walk all over you and charm you into thinking you’re in control. Mine goes to her kennel where they can appreciate her charm but still provide some rules."

mbti,ffec2b1,t1_ffctjc3,1579842675.0,"Thank you for clarifying this for me! I didn’t mean offense by being so abrupt, and this topic stayed on my mind in the background as I tried to put a finger on what I felt was off about it.

I double checked my mbti results, and I should clarify that they indicate only a mild preference for N over S. Anecdotally, I am as TeNi as you can get, but the results do indicate maybe I have a more developed Sensing function than the stereotypical ENTJ.

I related to the last part about not always knowing what’s going on in my mind. I didn’t relate to not knowing the past. I am future oriented, but my sentimental streak lives the past. I think I have a good memory for things, but it could be that I just believe I am good at that. In truth, I tend to write down a lot of things so that I won’t forget them whether studying or journaling so maybe filtering through Te is the ticket to the long term memory?

Finally, your juxtaposition of Ni and Si was very enlightening. I have zero endurance, first off. I will do things for loyalty and honor, but I would never do something blindly by that criteria. That’s what got Ned Stark killed."
mbti,ffcfk30,t3_esrz6w,1579798379.0,"I couldn’t disagree more as an ENTJ. But recognizing my sense of duty and honor has been revelatory as an adult, so perhaps this wasn’t innate until life experience."

Being attracted to someone based off your interactions is good, but we do tend to see the best (the POTENTIAL) in people. Embrace this quality but do remember to consider that people are not just who they could be with you, they’re also who they are. That guy sounds dumb even if he’s not that way with you.

At this point, I just focus on my career. I have an intimidating resume, and I found myself selling myself short to not “outshadow” men I dated. That’s b.s. But also, I’ve come to see that it’s unlikely I would be able to find a partner who wouldn’t find me intimidating outside of my field. So I focus on my career and if it happens, it happens.

The bad: Some of my emotions manifest physically before I am aware of them cognitively. I am learning to listen to my body since someone pointed this out to me.

When I’m on a roll, I forget to eat even though I logically know food is fuel to burn that midnight oil.
