trashy,ffbi7mc,t3_esh4oy,1579766473.0,"Similarly, we had our boat stored at my in-laws' house in a crappy area of town. Somebody tried to steal the nice Mercury motor and destroyed it in the process. Someone also tried to steal their pool motor and, again, were unsuccessful. It had to be replaced because it was in pieces. Thieves should Google these things before they start dismantling them! /s"
