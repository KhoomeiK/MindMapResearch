aww,fg20k6m,t3_ewbzz6,1580436036.0,"This is so wonderful. I feel so guilty that I didn't get my Smokey cat of 20 years a kitten. We were gone so much for a while there for my parents health that she was just home a lone and I always felt like she should have had a kitten all of her own. When my outside cat had kittens Smokey was so happy. I think she wanted to be a mom, but sadly my outside kitty was a jealous creature and turned them against Smokey. Which then made the kitten we did keep never warm up to her. 

I hope your two kitties have a wonderful life and time together! Your older kitty looks so happy!"

I do like it when my books look pretty, but I also just what them to live a long and happy life. One in which I can reread them many-many times before they start to wear."
CharmedCW,ffythds,t3_eu0qfd,1580354730.0,"Abigail had such potential. Especially with Macy! I thought they could be frenemies who become friends. Especially since they are both half demon and witch. 

Personally I think the overlord and demons have so much potential! But the show isn't pacing or world building right. They're scatter brained. Coming up with cool ideas and then either underdeveloped them, dropping them, or forgetting about them. 

The show needs core writers and a serious OUTLINE. I mean it. I feel like someone should send them some how to write videos from youtube. So that these great ideas can be built up better. 

If anything it feels like this is a season 1. It's being rushed and played around with a lot. Even though I'm pretty sure it's a full season this time and they've been renewed. 

Though looking at Riverdale this weird type of writing style and plotting is working very well for them."
CharmedCW,ffyrv4m,t1_ffhaqux,1580353604.0,I kept wondering where she was as well.
CharmedCW,ffyrttb,t1_ffhdjug,1580353580.0,But it doesn't work. They're their only obstacle. So I think it falls flat.
CharmedCW,ffyrqkm,t1_ffgwfgf,1580353518.0,That's exactly what I was thinking!!! Then when he tells Macy he does want her . . . but everything his character has said about demon sides makes me think the show needs to explore that maybe Macy is holding back because she feels that Harry rejects her because of her demon side.
CharmedCW,ffyrnk5,t1_ffgyi3v,1580353459.0,"The horror touch was really well done. I think Jordan has more chemistry with Maggie because Jordan has had way more time to flesh out. Parker was kind of this dream boat that Maggie liked who let's be honest never got fully developed in season 1. Both men have chemistry, but I think Jordan's character is just more interesting right now."
CharmedCW,ffyrhm6,t3_etb8fd,1580353343.0,"This proves Harry has a type. Or an MO. He thinks he can't have, or Macy won't have him, so he's picky a woman very similar to the last one. So it makes me wonder if he picked his relationship with Elder what's-her-name because he couldn't be with someone else. \*raises eyebrow\* doubt it considering that season 2 is new writers and new focus. But it's funny how his two evil ladies are connected. 

This episode was decent and I know Jordan and Maggie will be hooked up . . . but I still like them as friends. 

I also think Macy's rich dude and her have super chemistry. But he's gonna be the one controlling the dark lighter or something. Which we are being teased with! What's happening with the dark lighter! I give it to the show runners for having 3 solid plot lines and two huge mysteries going on. 

Not to mention keeping us in suspense on what power Macy is going to have. I really like the new powers that Maggie and Mel have. It's been great how the showrunners have hit the reset this season . 

&#x200B;

Oh, and I kind of liked how Abigail was into Macy at the beginning. And to be honest I'm not vibing her and Harry. At the very least I liked the idea of Abigail and Macy being frenemies. I feel like the writers took the Abigail, Macy, and Harry plot to the wrong, read more predictable and boring, place."
CharmedCW,ffyqvjv,t3_elhf7s,1580352927.0,"I've really liked season 2 and I'm up to date. I think season 2 is still going very strong. 

I have watched the OG version, and have to be honest. I never fell in love with it. So this version of Charmed is my chance to enjoy it and become a fan. I am now! I like where the story is going and I don't think this one is any campy/CWer than any of the others. In fact,  I find it odd how much flack the show is getting compared to Riverdale. Which blows my mind socks that it took off and got as big as it has. Especially with the writing . . . which I think Charmed does tighter and cleaner. \*shrugs\* 

Either way I really like it and I'm super happy that their will be a season 3! 

I also agree with everything @ [tigertankthomas](https://www.reddit.com/user/tigertankthomas/) said."

Fantasy,ffw1br3,t3_evfoo5,1580280189.0,"I love good world building. Always have. If a book can take you to a place you've never been and you can fully see it in your head. You're there. It's so powerful you feel the weather, smells, and all: it's magic. The last few YA books I read had almost zero world description. One of my favorite places to read about is New Orleans and I read two books that didn't put any effort into it. My mind pulled from other books. The last one had a great story and characters and I didn't mind it too much that the world was under described. Though at the end of the book I realized that the houses were never described. Like it was an old Victorian and it was blue. Anything. Which was a shame because the author has a way with words that left be highlighting almost he entire book.

I love a great plot, characters, and world building. And if I'm being honest  a character is the place the story is taking place. I just don't feel like a story can be whole if the basics of the world around a character isn't there. 

I'm starting to see a trend in YA that doesn't fully develop world. I noticed it in Aveyard's Red Queen books. This past year almost every YA book that I read that came out in 2020 has lacked world building. It makes me super sad. Either the author doesn't care, it's lazy writing, or they just assume that the reader will fill it in.  Which is odd. Most kids don't even no what a rotary phone is anymore. So if they're reading a historical book it's the author's duty to explain and describe. Let alone if it's a sci/fi or fantasy world."
TheMarvelousMrsMaisel,ff5acuq,t1_ff3fvcq,1579585101.0,While they did have some super funny lines and such. I did find the story for them a let down. It did pick up towards the end and I did like the idea of Rose becoming the match maker.

ChicagoFireNBC,fefosdk,t3_elz6yx,1579061079.0,"Wasn't expecting this much hate for this episode. It's a typical wrap up the cliffhanger and quickly try to establish the new idea. Especially for Fire. But i think it still had plenty of great character moments. 

What I didn't like was Foster and Sylvie's weird drama. It either shouldn't have been there, or needed proper build up. 

The letter story was a very cute Mouch side story, and it was just the type of cheese Fire is known for. 

Also, I found the chase seen really funny. Very fun. 

I mean you kind of always suspend disbelief with the show. It is a soap opera in a fire house."

ChicagoMed,fefj10w,t3_eok7dp,1579057345.0,Exactly. I agreed with her. However. She should have told Will what she found out. I'm pretty sure he would have overcome his guilt to protect the boy.

Sure there's still problems, but I hope this sets up 2020. Because 2019 fell on it's face and the writers just phoned it in. 

So while watching Dev and Joss be super awkward. I had this perfect clarity of how I really dig the idea of Dev liking Cameron . . . then romance! I doubt it will happen. So far Cameron is straight, though the self discovery would make for an intense and beautiful story if handled right. I think were just gonna get a forbidden love. Dev fighting his feelings for Joss until he doesn't.  Which can be good too, but I doubt it. 

Also, I get why Ava needs to marry Nic. But he's still legally married to what's her name. I'm pretty sure that was even brought up multiple times in the show.
