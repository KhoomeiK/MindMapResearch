aviation,fg0h3aw,t1_ffzy6ik,1580407665.0,"Ha!  I flew mostly in Alaska, had a series of different planes.  I have (I think) over 3000 hours in fixed wing and helicopters.  Single and multi engine, Instrument fixed wing and helicopter - commercial pilot.  All my time was in my own aircraft.  Alaska, obviously, is a big place.  Not a lot of roads tho and flying in your own plane is very common.  Important to follow the rules to stay safe.  But the bottom line is you have to make up your own rules - can I land there, and can I take off again, how deep is that snow, what’s the ceiling on the other side of those mountains, etc.

I have a few stories but the worst; Landing at the airstrip by my house.  I’d done it thousands of times with no problems.  The winds were gusty but no big deal.  I was just about to touch down when the airplane became uncontrollable.  In the “blink of an eye” I was over my neighbors garden on the side of the runway.  (I can close my eyes and see the mold spots on the fence posts).  During my “go around” the plane was in a 90 degree bank, not just a steep bank, but a full 90, stall horn screaming.  I’m in this 90 degree bank,  the control yoke is to the stop (in the opposite direction of the roll),  I have full power, and I’m looking at tree branches and retracting my flaps.  It was during this that out of the corner of my eye I see my 4 year old daughter sleeping in her car seat next to me.

I continued my go round and landed at another airport.  This was in a Cessna 172B.  A good plane but with a 145 hp engine no one would call it overpowered.  The only thing that saved me was on short final I turned the carb heat off.  With the heat on there would not have been enough power to avoid crashing."
aviation,ffz3m5z,t3_evsu5l,1580362845.0,A good accomplishment.  I flew for 6-8 years before I really appreciated the depth of knowledge my private pilot license gave me.  I flew for about another 20 years and enjoyed almost all of it.  Have fun!
