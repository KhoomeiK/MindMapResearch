>They're consistently up on the most cancelled/delayed lists, which pretty much renders them useless for business travel. 

Their average delay though is less than 15 minutes.  So yes, while they top the list for *number* of delays, their actual delay time is better than average in terms of delay length.

>Also any savings on fare price are quickly eliminated if you want to bring any sort of baggage with you that's not a backpack.

Okay but what if you only want to bring your two carry on items?  Is that somehow unfathomable to you?

>Point being there are very legitimate complaints for Frontier/Spirit in the US, and if you can't see them, you probably just do not travel that often.

That's the second most common cause of crashes though, only behind pilot error, and comfortably ahead of weather.

If the rear turbine loses a blade that's exactly what happens, and that's about 1 in 5 mechanical failures.  What happens is a small amount of fuel is lost, burns, and sets the hot grease/oil on fire.  Couple that in with blades rotating multiple thousands of times a minute and you have a lot of energy to disperse the flames and fuel."

Unless by for '20 somethings' you actually mean loud, obnoxious, and insufferable clubs for people who need to escape reality, in which case you have to go up to Denver.

If you're seeing a show or something it can be different but for the most part people here are chill and the bars reflect it.  Tejon is as active as it really gets, and that's just fine for the ""20 somethings"" in this town."
