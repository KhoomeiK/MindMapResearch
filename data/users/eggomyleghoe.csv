LongDistance,fdn60p0,t1_fdn5mfz,1578578255.0,Just be careful and make sure you know that how you feel about this is valid! If it’s bothering you still then you should talk to her. If she has an issue with helping you feel better about this kinda thing she isn’t worth the energy anyway. Best of luck!
LongDistance,fdn5d94,t3_em9uaz,1578577740.0,Why would she think that’s okay? And honestly the whole thing is just sketchy... I’m really sorry this is happening to you. Obviously I don’t know her or your relationship but it sounds like she got caught with someone else and is now trying to make it up to you to deal with her own guilt? Even if not it’s inappropriate in my opinion to let someone kiss your cheek and such while in a relationship.
