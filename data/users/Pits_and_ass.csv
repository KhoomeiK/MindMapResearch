You can say the same thing about all the candidates. 

1. Buttigieg is a shameless gentrifier, 
2. Warren was a Republican until the 80s, 
3. and Biden fought against integration. 

There is no perfect candidate, but Bernie isn't just a candidate, he's a movement. A diverse workers' movement that this country hasn't seen in decades. 

I see Bernie's movement as standing on the shoulders of MLKs Poor People's Movement that he tried to launch before he was assassinated.

A lot of black people, especially young black people, are drawn to him. You're not going to tear down the movement with some 30 year old problematic comment he made during some innocuous speech. Because this movement isn't built on his personality, it's built on ideas. 

It's obvious that you have no idea what is actually drawing us to him as a candidate.
