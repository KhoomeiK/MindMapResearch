cats,ffklcxe,t1_ffki6ny,1580024672.0,"It’s absolutely disgusting the way some people treat animals. I don’t understand how these people can live with themselves. I considered becoming a vet but realized that I could handle the abuse cases. Vets have one of the highest suicide rates out of any profession, even the military. It’s heartbreaking. I eventually decided to peruse nursing instead"
cats,ffkl4m4,t1_ffkhy5n,1580024565.0,"I answered this just a second ago so I will copy and paste! Her name is definitely very weird so I’d be extremely shocked if anyone could have figured it out!

You know the Snuffleupagus from Sesame Street? The big furry brown elephant dude? Well my ex was into Sesame Street as it was an inside joke with some friends, and when we brought the Gis home he started calling her Snuffleupagus as a joke because she was so furry and poofy (her original name was Skylar). After a while Snuffleupagus got twisted into Snuffle-fluffagus, which turned into Fluffagis, and now she’s just The Gis! It’s stuck ever since. Every now and then she gets a Fluffagis, and while she has innumerable nicknames the Gis is basically her official name. She responds to every single nickname also!"
cats,ffkkyb5,t1_ffkiw1b,1580024485.0,"I honestly don’t think she ever will be! It would make vet trips much easier because for now we need to sedate her before she even gets inside. Sadly the vet (or any other strangers in strange places that try to grab her) and meeting strange animals are her biggest triggers and they make her aggressive. That’s the only time she’ll hiss or attack. Strangers coming to our house is fine because she can hide in my bedroom, but at the vet she absolutely melts down. We’re working on it! Our vet is very accommodating and we take her when no animals are in the waiting room."

cats,ffkj2sa,t1_ffkfr49,1580023592.0,"It can be a long process but it’s so worth it! I highly suggest looking up Jackson Galaxy. His YouTube videos are amazing, and he’s absolutely the worlds top cat whisperer. He has so much good advice on socializing pets. That’s where I got most of the techniques I used with the Gis!"
cats,ffkiv4t,t1_ffkf1t8,1580023494.0,Thank you! ^^
cats,ffkih54,t1_ffkbxdt,1580023307.0,"Absolutely! It’s best to start with friendly well socialized cats. I’ve owned cats my entire life and didn’t start taking on the harder ones until I had a very firm understanding of cat behavior and body language. It can take a while to learn, but it’s definitely worth it and it’s very rewarding! But all cats need homes! Even pet store cats and friendly kittens!"
cats,ffkiad2,t1_ffk9p6r,1580023221.0,"She got a very thorough petting, don’t worry!

cats,ffki63t,t1_ffk30sy,1580023164.0,"It can be a very long process! My best advice is to try to learn her body language so you can figure out when she feels comfortable with you approaching and when she doesn’t. The next stop would be trying to socialize her. Feed her treats one at a time, and take one step closer to her with each treat. Stop as soon as she shows any sign of fear. Do this until she’ll eventually eat them out of your hands. From there you can try to pet her while she eats treats. 

Here is more awesome advice!

I also HIGHLY suggest looking up Jackson Galaxy! He can socialize even the scariest, most aggressive cats. He is amazing. A lot of the times a cats fear can be cured by introducing more play, but most importantly figuring out the root issue (such as other pets, children, etc)

Don’t give up yet! There is definitely hope!"

cats,ffkgypr,t1_ffk835y,1580022594.0,"At first she was absolutely in shock. She stayed under my bed for a week straight, calling out every once in a while. We had her in my bedroom with her food and litter so she could slowly acclimate to the house (and so she could have a safe space to retreat to) and Dax my male cat would constantly try to get into the room. At first I thought he might attack the Gis, but when we let him in to try to let him get used to her scent they clicked after a very small round of mutual hissing. She followed him around like a little chick! Thankfully she wasn’t afraid of him like she was with humans. Funny enough, she reacts to other cats with intense aggression now. Kittens she can handle. There was just something special about Dax, and he taught her how to be a cat as if he was her mother!

Now that Dax is 8 and lazy and fat while the Gis is still young and playful he gets annoyed with her constant energy, but they still play together nightly and I catch them cuddling and grooming each other at least once a week"
cats,ffkg37n,t1_ffjpmuq,1580022189.0,That happens so often! It’s awful! Facebook is such a sketchy place to find pets. It’s wonderful to be able to take these animals from bad homes/irresponsible people (or uninformed people) so thank you for taking the kitten in!
cats,ffkfll1,t1_ffk4od4,1580021962.0,"Most of the cats I’ve had have kinda found their way to me somehow! Dax, my male cat, lived at my ex’s house which was the home of a hoarder. He was kept in deplorable conditions but thankfully he left unscathed. He’s always been super friendly and outgoing, albeit very rambunctious and a bit of a trouble maker. Before him I had taken in 3 kittens from my backyard who were abandoned. We had a massive feral cat colony who seemed to use our yard as a breeding ground! We rehomed those little guys once they were older and socialized. I have a soft spot for the cats who need some help!"

I’ll frequently fall asleep with him on top of me and when I wake up he’ll still be there! He’s the epitome of lazy, fat cat!"
cats,ffjxa0w,t1_ffjwild,1580009484.0,LOL! Yes! That’s very accurate! Especially since she’s jumpy. Can even shift a little without her flying off the bed. The amount of leg cramps are innumerable
cats,ffjw84m,t1_ffjvlhq,1580008643.0,I will definitely try! She’s been in my lap since I took this video earlier so hopefully I can get her to do it tonight!
cats,ffjsh72,t1_ffjs5xc,1580005730.0,"She knows what she wants and she isn’t afraid to ask for it! She’ll usually politely tap on your arm, but when she gets super excited like this she can’t help but nibble and claw. Those are always the best cuddling sessions though!

cats,ffjpfkl,t1_ffjomtp,1580003647.0,"When I went in to adopt her he was already chosen by someone else! He was a very happy, outgoing, playful kitten and the Gis and her brother were the only available babies at the moment, so he was scooped up immediately. Kittens usually aren’t allowed to leave the shelter the same day they’re adopted, I think usually due to multiple applications coming in and screening possible pet parents, but thankfully I was allowed to take the Gis the same day! We needed to go back about once a week for vet visits for shots, deworming, and due to her digestive issues but they knew she’d cope better in a home than in the shelter once her brother was taken home!

Fun fact! Their estimated birthdays are Valentine’s Day!"
cats,ffjmy1h,t1_ffjlsi5,1580001972.0,"The one down side of living with the Gis! She has learned to poke using her nails and more often than not you’ll get caught by one. I’m usually left with little spots all over my arms after a more intense cuddle session! She really expresses herself through her paws. She picks up her toys and throws them for herself using her claws, begs for attention with her paws, scoops food out of the bowl with her paws... you get used to it! She’s too cute to be mad at!"
cats,ffjmja5,t3_etzqnk,1580001688.0,"(all mentions of abuse will be placed in parenthesis and are only in the first paragraph, there are mentions of animal death)

Full story: 

(A good samaritan found the Gis and her brother tied up in a garbage bag next to a dumpster. They were only a month old and were left with their deceased siblings and mother. We’re unsure if it was a birth gone wrong and the mother and siblings died, or if this sick human being killed them. Due to the ages of the Gis and her brother were assuming it was abuse. The Gis has some digestive issues that could be deadly in kittens, so we sometimes wonder if that’s why her siblings died rather than considering what she may have went through for that first month of her life).

They were taken to a shelter where they were evaluated. Her brother was generally unharmed and acted like any normal baby, but the Gis was traumatized. She was terrified of humans (especially men), and any unexpected noise or movement would leave her cowering in fear. She had severe separation anxiety when her brother was placed in the kitten kennel so she was put in the pen with him. I happened to go in a few days later and as soon as I saw her I knew we were meant to be together.

I was only 18 and the women at the shelter tried to convince me that the Gis was unadoptable, as she thought she’d never be a “normal” cat and would inevitably be returned to the shelter and euthanized. I immediately adopted her and brought her home. Thankfully she got along with my male cat (Dax) who was also abused (rescued from a hoarder) but it was a long, uphill battle. I would have to wrap her up like a burrito to socialize her, and she hadn’t learned how to clean herself yet so I had to wipe her butt when she used the bathroom and gave her sponge baths with a warm, damp cloth. 

She barely ever left my room besides getting food and using the litter box, and any sight of my mom would send her running back to my room and under the bed. She immediately showed some signs of improvement, because while she was still terrified of other people (and of me a lot of the time) she would purr during our socializing sessions.

Within her first year she started to lay in bed with me, at a distance and ready to jump, but this showed she was learning to trust me! Within the next 2-3 years she allowed me to pet her for longer amounts of time on her terms, but she would not allow any handling. At 4-5 she began to sleep next to me and would follow me around the house. She loved to be pet but would easily get frightened. She has changed so much within this past year! She lays in my lap, begs for attention, and purrs basically constantly. I still can’t handle her, but whenever I’m home she’s always right next to me, begging to be pet. I love her more than life itself, and it breaks my heart knowing that so many cats like her aren’t given a chance. She has become the sweetest, cuddliest, most misunderstood cat I’ve ever had the chance to meet. She has special needs and some brain damage, but I wouldn’t change her. She has PICA and digestive issues, her short term memory is awful, and vet visits are super scary because of her fear of humans, but every second with her is worth it.

She had returned the favor and gave me a reason to keep on going through the hardest moments of my life. At times I felt the world would be better off without me, that my mom and boyfriend would be relieved if I was gone, but I knew the Gis wouldn’t be able to cope without me because I’m the only one she knows and trusts. She’s lived with me and my boyfriend for three years now and while she allows him to touch her I know she wouldn’t have any quality of life without me. So too bad for her, she’s stuck with me for the long run!
