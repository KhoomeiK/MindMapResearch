Dogtraining,ff9tpq2,t3_escys1,1579721059.0,Training multiple dogs is very difficult. Training the humans ie yourself is even harder. Start by always saying the dogs name before each command. Always. This is easily taught with catch. Dogs close and fifi  catch. Then Fido catch. Till the other did doesn’t move until he hears his name. For activities where all dogs participate like going out to pee the command is dogs outside.

UpliftingNews,ff7201d,t1_ff70mep,1579639532.0,You are so accurate. The USA journalism is bad. Sadly Very self promoting and politicized. It is nearly impossibly to find bare complete facts on any topic. Instead we get an on slot of opinions by supposed educated actors sports figures and political pawns.  In the media We are repeatedly told what the majority of the people want but in reality it is usually the opposite of the truth. I fear for the young people that are deliberately spoon fed hate and misinformation by the media. It is draining our country.

migraine,feoann5,t1_feo7m2a,1579297403.0,"Is there anything that helps?  I am so sorry for you that we are experiencing the same symptoms. My headaches in the last 6 months have been increasingly disruptive. I had to turn down all the holiday family get togethers including Halloween. Late December it dawned on me that I have been eating a lot of cheeses while dieting since March. I know that fresh milk over the course of a month makes my migraines much worse. So I am 21days now into a no dairy experiment to see if it helps with headache intensity.  So far no change. 
The only thing I have not tried is Botox."
migraine,feo6zx9,t1_fenyuen,1579295915.0,Thanks for the input. I am well over 60 and the stroke risk increases sharply with age so the amitriptyline is no longer on the table for safety. The same is true for many of the meds I have used in the past. I can manage my migraines so so but  I have only had 3 headache free days in 5 years.
migraine,fenxq3z,t1_fenxcf6,1579292384.0,My daily headache s have been horrendous for  a few years I am doing a dietary trial now if that fails I was thinking about asking to go back on topomax. I had no success with it as far as controlling my migraines but I never went above 200 mg daily and I did get a kidney stone at that time.
migraine,fenw95n,t3_eq0ffw,1579291757.0,To answer your question it s against the law to redistribute prescriptions to another person because of potential contamination in that scenario. Many pharmacies and some police stations have an excess Med drop box.

She started a lifelong health and fitness program. She lost the weight walked hiked and skied. Stayed active every day. She lived almost to 90. Her last winter was her first for not skiing lots. Her son died before she did of heart disease. She died from an infection.
service_dogs,fe5veer,t1_fe5tjuv,1578875810.0,I forgot to ask the most important question first. do your migraines raise to the level of a diagnosable disability??  Millions of people have migraines but only a few people have then at a level to qualify as a diagnosable disability. Are you legally disabled by your migraines?
service_dogs,fe5uszw,t1_fe5tjuv,1578875433.0,A natural alert is not considered a task but a but a trained response behavior in response to a natural alert is a task. You sound frustrated and a bit angry. How many times have you tried for work place accommodations regarding this. The fact that the doctor said he couldn’t give you a letter with out violating hipaa is curious. You are having trouble getting what you want from hr And your doctor. Why.
WeightLossAdvice,fe2isw3,t3_enmpo1,1578838821.0,At the very most weigh weekly a fortnight is better. Weigh and measure and record your intake. Out bodies fluctuate for so many reasons.

BariatricSurgery,fdwv1f2,t3_en84li,1578762587.0,After you lose the weight ask for a retest before  stopping using your machine. Lots of apnea is caused by obstruction by fat but some is caused by brain issues. So it depends. My daughter just retested and was told her machine was no longer necessary. She has lost about 50 lb so so far and  is no longer obese per BMI
Dogtraining,fdwsjid,t1_fdwrkmt,1578761970.0,Many dogs bark the first few classes. Most learn when it is time to work and time to play. To The instructors at the AKC classes dogs are their passion. Most are very well educated and experienced in a variety of behaviors. At least go watch a series of classes even  if you don’t take your dog there.
Dogtraining,fdwq0yf,t1_fdwlv7c,1578761277.0,Group obedience classes are so good. You see the successes and mistakes of other handlers. Your dog learns to ignore other dogs and people while working. AKC.org for clubs that have classes in your area. In my experience the classes at big box pet stores don’t have enough participants to help you learn as easily.
