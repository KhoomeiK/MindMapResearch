My mother’s middle name is America too and my father named me that too.

I wouldn’t have issues with this name if I was some sort of celebrity or if I was pretty or something out of the ordinary. This name gets unwanted attention and often negative. It’s strong, yet feminine. I don’t relate to my birth sex which is why this name is also an issue."
