aww,fe6kqy2,t1_fe54e8d,1578894144.0,"Thank you for giving me the perfect example that I can explain why that is hurtful. You can totally hate Nazis but if you go around shouting that you hate German people, you become a racist. Or you can say you don't support communism, but saying you get annoyed when people point out your racism when you yell ""I hate russians!"" is problematic.

I'm just a simple muslim. I go to medicine school, I work in projects that help LGBTQ+ people, I am a feminist. I try to be the best version of myself so that people like you shout ""Islam is bad!"", I can show you that it incorrect.

ISIS killed more muslims than it killed christians. If you want to hate someone, just hate terrorists, pedophiles and rapers.

Also I don't want to ""cancel"" anyone. As you can see, I just want to explain some stuff so that you won't hate just because of my religion. Good day to you."
aww,fe6jyn7,t1_fe61l9m,1578893363.0,"Really? Wikipedia? Please, try again. Or if you do have an open mind, I can explain it to you because I used to hear the same thing and as a feminist muslim, I questioned it a lot. I must admit there were lots of sources claiming that, both Arabic, Turkish and English. Arabic and Turkish ones supported that because they wanted to marry 9 year olds and tried to justify that. English ones just wanted people to think that the prophet was a pedophile.

But then, it just relied on basic math. Aisha's sister, Asma was 10 years older than Aisha. There are documents that show Asma died when she was 100 years old, 73 years after Hijra. Aisha got married after Hijra, this means that she was at least 18 years old.

The whole 9 years nonsense comes from Aisha, saying that she was 9 years old when she was taken as a wife. Arabs used to handle counting ages differently, even Korean people do it weirdly. Before islamic times, Arabic girls were buried alive when they were born, sold and raped. Only a handful of them matured to adulthood. Many of the men died in wars and fights between the clans, making the population of men and women kind of equal. The women who did get to mature were seen as animals, why would you bother counting or celebrating birthdays? After getting their period and becoming ""a woman"", the women used to count their years of living. So when Aisha said she was 9 years old, she meant after she entered puberty. This means she was 9 years old when she got her period, which makes total sense for an Arabic girl.

Each evidence and document support each other. I wish all of you a good day :)"

AskReddit,fe0ugjf,t3_eng8y5,1578818755.0,"Talking about sex beforehand does not kill the mood or the romance. You should talk about your experiences, your diseases or the way of protection you will use.

Knowing the other person in such a way before doing something intimate is so much better than being in doubt about STDs or pregnancy.

Also don't have sex just because you think it's cool or you shouldn't be a virgin anymore. Everyone has a time that is right and yours will come when you are comfortable with it. Just make sure you feel secure and happy with your partner and they feel the same way about you."

Also I'm a med student and been to a few autopsies, I get how seeing a dead body can make someone question some stuff. It's really hard but after some time you can accept it and let it go. I'm sorry I don't have any useful advice but I just want you to know that you're not alone with the stuff you are experiencing.

Wish you the best."

AskReddit,fd8y9hr,t3_ek6lpw,1578225278.0,"When I was a freshman in high school, I was incredibly homophobic. I've once seen Sirius-Remus fanart on Tumblr and I felt disgusted. I was talking to a friend about it and said it was sickening. She simply asked ""Why?"" and I couldn't find a proper answer. I was raised religious and living in Turkey added to the fact that it was a total taboo. I struggled to find an answer to my friend's question.
I couldn't.
I decided to do some research and found many LGBTQ+ support platforms. Today I'm in my 3rd year in college, currently working on a project nationwide about LGBTQ+ people and identify as a bicurious demisexual woman. I have many LGBTQ+ friends. I'm am so glad that my friend decided to make me question myself instead of humiliating me and forcing me to change my belief."

The only context it had was talking shit about a group of teenage girls liking something, better liking a genre of music than drugs. The other part that didn't contain any context was filled with you trying to curse creatively and failing miserably.
