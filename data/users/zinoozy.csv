stocks,ff9w8qf,t3_esen4n,1579722875.0,"I personally know both healthcare systems really well. I have had family members get surgeries in Canada and see specialists as well as ER visits, walk-in and just seeing your primary care doctors. 

Not as extensive experience in the US but from personal experience the wait times have been similar if not longer in the US.  It took me over a month to get an appointment with my primary care doctor, a month for a specialist and 4 hours for urgent care (mix between a ER and walk-in clinic) here in the US. Where the wait times may differ is surgeries. I know that for heart related treatments, if its a high priority, the wait time is within 48 hours in Toronto. This link is a helpful indicator https://www.hqontario.ca/System-Performance/Wait-Times-for-Surgeries-and-Procedures/Wait-Times-for-Cardiac-Surgeries-and-Procedures/Time-from-Decision-to-Having-Cardiac-Surgery-or-Procedure

Canadian healthcare is far from perfect but I hate the healthcare system in the US. They are totally gauging the people here with the costs and you do not get more freedom if you are on hmo or kaiser plans. You are stuck with the doctors in your network. Not to mention how confusing the plans can be. I just had a regular checkup with my doctor but because I happened to briefly discuss something that was not covered by the insurance I had to pay for the whole appointment. If you are rich you can pay for treatments from the best of the best in the US and that is where the  benefits are imo."
dogs,fezxqle,t1_fez0tth,1579463074.0,Can confirm I did this during keto and intermittent fasting and quite enjoyed butter coffee or bulletproof coffee.
dogs,fezxm7x,t1_fewfmty,1579463022.0,Its so yum!
vanderpumprules,fepxuh3,t1_fepxird,1579334360.0,Ya figured that. I just somehow keep thinking max and brett are the same person. When OP said he didn't read Max's tweets my mind just went to OP posted without reading Brett's tweets? It confused me for a minute there.
vanderpumprules,fepqcyu,t1_fepq9ie,1579327766.0,Ya I know but I still had to say my piece about Max. To me they seem like the same person.
vanderpumprules,fepq7xc,t1_fepbyz9,1579327640.0,I can see where you are coming from with regards to Brett's tweets but Max's tweets are hateful.
vanderpumprules,feppmji,t1_feppi4e,1579327109.0,So you read Brett's tweets?
vanderpumprules,feppfqk,t1_fepdehg,1579326939.0,I had the exact same sentiment as you when I read about their very old tweets as a asian woman...this is until I read the actual many MANY tweets. I want them off the show and frankly I'm disgusted by LVP's reaction. I want to punch their uggo smug faces.
stocks,fenut01,t3_eq21oa,1579291155.0,I would go with EL. They own the best brands in the cosmetic/skincare space.
stocks,fenu6ew,t3_eq33xx,1579290779.0,CHWY. Chewy's share of the online market is about 50% and the pet industry is growing. It's currently trading just below $30.
vfx,fem9y24,t3_epstrj,1579245307.0,It should have been done practically imo. It looked weird. I don't get why they don't just do it practically...really? you have to control every splatter? Something about vfx blood just doesn't look right. The consistency looked off. That blood just distracted me while I was watching that scene.
dogs,fejchfu,t3_eosfxa,1579167128.0,Any fireworks or just loud unusual noises recently? That can spook a dog for months. Or is there another animal who put their scent on your dogs usual spots? Maybe get him checked out by a vet.
aww,fea9bhu,t1_fea8ssu,1578945891.0,You can tell when the dog is stressed. Pretty obvious. Must be a well trained dog though since it's not lashing out.
aww,fea6cnw,t1_fe9wcs0,1578944867.0,Yikes if that's the case that makes me sad for the dog.
doggrooming,fdrg246,t1_fdqt6wq,1578684031.0,That is so sad! When I saw the number of deaths my mind went to senior dogs or corporate not training new hires enough or corporate greed of handling too many dogs at once. Also was curious if the equipment petsmart uses was somehow different from the more high end private salons.
doggrooming,fdqsskt,t1_fdqa7v5,1578674109.0,Thank you for your input. This answer was very informative. I really like this sub bc all the groomers here seem so passionate about their work but also love animals which so reassuring.
AmItheAsshole,fdm4erb,t1_fdm3427,1578539531.0,My kid nephew knows winnie the pooh. Pretty sure most kids know winnie the pooh.
stocks,fdkvca6,t1_fdkrvlz,1578511917.0,I'm Canadian living in the States and I can tell you the healthcare is not much different here than in Canada. The wait times are similar.
vanderpumprules,fdkjpf6,t1_fdjsy4p,1578505100.0,You said it perfectly. Sometimes I get so annoyed with Katie and Stassi on how they treat Kristen and then I remember how I was with a friend who was like Kristen and how much of a raging bitch I was with said close friend bc of my sheer frustration.
vanderpumprules,fdjezcq,t1_fdj7bxx,1578467994.0,Ohh I think you are onto something bc I am the exact same way. My husband always says that if I were on a reality show I would be the villain haha
vanderpumprules,fdj9392,t1_fdj3xdq,1578462001.0,Hahaha if they didn't notice and just reposted that would be so much funnier.
stocks,fdhpvqs,t1_fdfti1c,1578427807.0,"Netflix is scrambling right now to create new kids content and paying a boatload to buy kid shows outright bc once their licensing expires for anything under the disney umbrella netflix will be losing a lot of content on their platform. 

Netflix in general is just spending a shit ton right now wooing big names over to create as much netflix originals as possible in preparation to lose a shit ton of content once licensing expires. Not sure how that will pan out given from where I stand it seems they might be just throwing a lot of money at the problem ahead."
vanderpumprules,fdhdgrh,t1_fdhc9l1,1578420399.0,I just want to redo the photoshop work bc it's so bad. It's probably a cheeky joke thing since he is obsessed with the show...let's hope haha
vanderpumprules,fdh2s9k,t3_eld13z,1578414143.0,Was this a joke post? That photoshop is so bad hahaha.
unpopularopinion,fdgzngp,t3_elafyn,1578412161.0,I agree. Game of thrones had lower ratings on episodes with more nudity so there is that.
stocks,fdgx575,t1_fdfsoqj,1578410502.0,Tmobile gives free netflix. Once Netflix starts losing content when the licenses expire the Disney streaming subs might not be so inflated..
Dogtraining,fdgt7ym,t3_elb208,1578407717.0,"I walk my dog which is a lhasa apso (way less energy dog breed) 3 times a day. Morning walk is 1.5 hours, evening walk is 1-1.5 hours and late evening walk is 20-30 minutes. Not to mention my dog is 9 years old so not a 1 year old pup like yours. Even with all the long walks he gets he still sometimes wants more. 

Border collies require a lot more in terms of excercise than a Lhasa Apso. 15-30 minute walks are not nearly enough for a pup."
reactivedogs,fdfuy3z,t3_el4417,1578370890.0,"I just think most people would not get it unless they themselves have experience with owning a reactive dog. I am so proud of myself with regards to how much my dog has progressed but he still has his issues. I have had strangers try to ceasar milan train my dog which was so maddening. 

I might just let them know that you are a trainer and that your dog has improved to a miraculous levels but his training is still in progress as in shut it with your unsolicited advice."
stocks,fdfezc7,t3_ekyslw,1578360135.0," Disney owns starwars, marvel, abc, pixar, blue sky, fox, espn(80%), hulu (80%), a&e (50%), lifetime (50%) and list goes on. I assume once the licensing rights for all the content under that umbrella expires on other streaming platforms it will all eventually end up on the Disney streaming platform. Correct me if I'm wrong on that. I would give them some time to take over."
ChoosingBeggars,fdcrqmd,t3_ekhl4b,1578282436.0,Amy's seriously good stuff...wow
AmItheAsshole,fdcamyb,t1_fdc6uqd,1578270442.0,So OP gets her own bedroom and if she had a normal roommate who would sleep on a cot in the livingroom who cooks and buys groceries should be expected to pay for half the rent???
dogs,fdcafff,t1_fdc43ka,1578270311.0,It is extremely difficult to even export a purebred Jindo out of Korea since they are considered a National Treasure. I think the rescues advertise it as a Jindo to make them more attractive to adopt...or maybe the dogs are Jindo mixed breeds.
dogs,fdbx93x,t1_fdbsyu1,1578263362.0,Jindos were designated as South Korea's 53 National Treasure and are protected under the Cultural Properties Protection Act. They are definitely not mutts. Jindos are highly regarded in Korea.
AmItheAsshole,fdb31tf,t1_fd59d3v,1578253210.0,How do you know he wasn't shoving off the plane. Safe to assume he might have been given how much of a rush he was in. Nobody likes line skippers but most people would have been happy to let him by if he explained his situation which he did not.
AmItheAsshole,fdb2476,t1_fd8xi8j,1578252864.0,Good deal to sleep on the cot in the livingroom?  Also OP's mom buys groceries and cooks for OP. Not to mention that OP goes go moms place every weekend. Lastly OP mentioned rent increased every year so OP was really overcharging mom year 1.
AmItheAsshole,fdb1h77,t1_fd99yuk,1578252615.0,Normal amount for a typical roommate who is there fulltime. In this case it's her mom who also contributes for groceries and cooks and only stays 3 days a week. Not to mention OP mentioned her rent had gone up each year so she really was overcharging her mom year 1. It just seems strange to do that to family especially since OP always goes home every weekend. Why treat your mom like a business transaction?
AmItheAsshole,fd701hw,t3_ek5pfy,1578197820.0,This is such a nice update. Also your wife is awesome.
AmItheAsshole,fd6vahj,t1_fd6tz42,1578196168.0,8k is a lot for what OP is paying in rent herself. Also OP seems to not mind her mom as a roommate as they get along. OP also visits parents home every weekend which leads me to think that she very much enjoys the company of her family. OP's mom also pays for groceries and cooks meals for OP. I know what you mean about privacy and space but to OP that doesn't seem to be an issue (from what I read from her replies)
AmItheAsshole,fd6sfo7,t1_fd6qmdq,1578195143.0,"Seems like it was not a formal lease agreement so it should be open for discussion and the way the mother approached it wasn't great but I assume she was hurt. Does not matter how rich you are, it's never a great feeling to feel like you are over paying. OP's mom is getting a family surcharge not discount."
AmItheAsshole,fd6nr63,t1_fd6mnlw,1578193550.0,OP's mom agreed with resentment. Probably should have discussed it at that point. Why does it matter if the mom is rich? OP's mom feels like she is not being treated like family bc of the over charge of rent.
AmItheAsshole,fd6m1r5,t1_fd6gnce,1578192959.0,It was mentioned several times by other posters and OP did not dispute the 2 nights a week at moms so I assume it's a regular thing.
AmItheAsshole,fd6ltwi,t1_fd6iswu,1578192884.0,"It seems more fair if you had a roommate that was sleeping on the cot full time. As it stands your mom is only there 3 days a week and a great respectful roommate. You also mentioned that she pays for groceries sometimes. Also rent had gone up for the past 3 years so I assume year 1 was even a crappier deal for your mom. And she is your mom so does she not get some family discount? 

I don't have all the details but maybe your mom was ok to overpay when she thought she would retire after a year but now going into year 3 she wants to renegotiate? And perhaps she was waiting for you to bring up giving her a discount...who knows. Probably should talk to your mom about it."
AmItheAsshole,fd5n01r,t3_ejywe6,1578179234.0,"INFO how much was rent and utilities for year 1 and 2? OP mentioned rent had increased over the years. OP's mom is expected to pay 8k for OP's current rent of $2000 a month plus $250-$300 in utilities which seems too high imo so for previous years even more so. 

Maybe OP's mom was ok to be way over charged thinking she will only be working for one more year but since its going on year 3 she is upset about the current 8k a year situation. Maybe have a discussion with your mom about what is fair for you both."
AmItheAsshole,fd51l22,t3_ejyp2w,1578173322.0,NTA. Who doesn't clean up after their dog pee right away? That is disgusting and a total asshole move on your roommate to try and make it a you thing with your OCD. Honestly sounds like your roommate needs help just from how long it takes her to clean up after her dog.
AmItheAsshole,fd4zes9,t1_fd3e2gy,1578172699.0,She sounds like the perfect roommate for the most part haha. Honestly though I think 8k is a bit steep. For the sake of the relationship with your mother I would consider significantly lowering the rent.
AmItheAsshole,fd4z52z,t1_fd3frwl,1578172614.0,Probably because most people think OP is TA considering OP is staying at parents 2 nights a week for free. So OP should probably lower rent.
AmItheAsshole,fd4yy4s,t1_fd45v2i,1578172550.0,But OP stays at parent 2 nights a week so redo your math but for 1 day a week. OP is way overcharging.
AmItheAsshole,fd4yaie,t1_fd3fhsv,1578172326.0,8k is too much. It's greedy. Does the fact you RENT somehow make you not greedy? Maybe drop the price down to 4k or have her just pay for all the groceries and utilities.
AmItheAsshole,fd1x7j7,t1_fd1u24d,1578138233.0,Except OP didn't inform anyone that he was transferring to another flight. So OP is the Karen in other passengers eyes.
unpopularopinion,fd1vors,t1_fczb899,1578137542.0,I mean white people get cast for things blatantly not white. It's only a problem when its the other way around. Not precious witcher. Boo hoo.
AmItheAsshole,fd1reg3,t3_ejuu8i,1578135617.0,"YTA it sounds like you were the Karen. There are basic rules for getting off a plane. Passengers in front followed by those in the back. And aisle seats first, then those in the middle seats and window seat. If you had spoken to the flight attendant before hand about your situation or explained to the other passengers why you were in such a rush then it would have been a NTA. But you didn't and you thought the other lady was a Karen for enforcing etiquette which makes you TA."
vanderpumprules,fcwtjjt,t1_fcvtccl,1578037020.0,That is amazing parenting right there....🙄
vanderpumprules,fcwtin0,t1_fcwbwph,1578036990.0,His mom looked more 50 something to me. But ya very immature herself. She taught James all the wrong values.
doggrooming,fcw7vc4,t3_ej5pli,1578019159.0,That is so sad. What did the owners have to say about the condition of their dog?
AmItheAsshole,fcjcz5t,t3_ehe9x4,1577683394.0,NTA if I was your sister I would want you to tell me about it. I would be so humiliated to be dating someone who made a video like that...especially if I had a brother who was korean...like come on! I'm sure your sister spoke to her bf and however he reacted made her break up with him. I am super protective of my younger sibling and I would have reacted the same way your sister did with no regrets.
AmItheAsshole,fcjcady,t1_fcir17i,1577682814.0,How is it clear that he isn't like that anymore?
relationship_advice,fcj8e1x,t1_fcj0dlo,1577679867.0,So strange that they hid their feelings from you like that. Your ex couldn't just communicate with you and let you know where things are?  She sounds like a big loser tbh. Would you really want to spend the rest of your life with someone who doesn't have your back and is so easily pushed around? Not to mention that she didn't even have the balls to break up with you in a compassionate way...she just distanced herself from you. It is all very cowardly. Imagine that you married someone like her and having to deal with nightmare in laws.
relationship_advice,fcj268w,t3_ehez9f,1577675414.0,Your case is more the exception. Tons of married interracial couples out there. Your ex is just a weak willed human being and you basically dodged a bullet.
Dogtraining,fc4tb2u,t3_eg6pnf,1577427606.0,"My rescue took over 2 years to trust my husband.  I was told he was a shih tzu mix as well but turns out he is a Lhasa Apso (wary breed). Their relationship significantly improved when I was so busy with work I was unable to walk or feed my dog as I normaly would for a couple months. My husband ended up taking over all those duties and that seemed to transform their relationship. Are you more the primary caregiver? If so maybe your boyfriend can take over some of the duties your dog really enjoys like feeding meals, treats or walking."
Dogtraining,fc4s2qc,t1_fc4lwpj,1577426323.0,Agree with everything you said. Most dogs don't enjoy that type if petting.
dogs,fc04ivm,t1_fbc33hq,1577278201.0,If you change the shape of the eyes the artist did to match your dogs better that might help. I think the eyes are what is really making that artwork not look like your dog.
reactivedogs,fbyq1wq,t1_fby39ex,1577223326.0,"Did the hallway somehow trap him where he was? My dog freaks out when there is not a clear escape route and he feels trapped in by people. Even after 4 years, my husband and I still have to make sure not to make him feel cornered."
