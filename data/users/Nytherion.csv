More information on the connections between eldar and orks (ghaz hears eldrad in his head and just thinks its mork/gork)."

Honestly, dunno.  Maybe the giant scorpions? Not played with them since an unfortunate incident on a pve-c server involving clan mates and a group run for city captains months ago.  Fun fact, you can kill clan mates, and their dragged captives, on pve-c if you're carelessly testing living bombs when they come running towards the wheel.

I'm not allowed to play with undead on that server any more."
ConanExiles,feu6z9j,t3_eqkqvq,1579383751.0,"Placing them can be restricted by proximity to claimed land, npc camps, and other ""no build"" areas, just like any other thrall.  It's a fun idea for pve (line up 70+ and pull a world boss down the line), but too restrictive.  Once thrall limits are introduced those limitations get even more noticable"

ConanExiles,fdj3eu6,t3_eld1ga,1578457396.0,It depends on how cold we're talking.  Mounds of the dead and the ice giants near it? basic ass Hyena Fur armor works.  The frozen lake and all points further north?  T4 crafted perfect/flawless armor.
ConanExiles,fdj2pwt,t3_elevd9,1578456900.0,It's... hit or miss.  There are times it regens back to full by the time a roll animation finishes.  Then there are times where i've had to sit in the corner and let thralls do an entire boss fight cause regen turned off on the first big hit.
ConanExiles,fdj1xer,t3_elmixb,1578456329.0,"There is decay, but the timer is based on in-game time for single player.  So if you clock 100+ hours of active playtime without rendering a thrall.. was that thrall really important anyway?"

Only thing i've thrown mine at that they don't solo is the large dragon bosses, due to every thing those dragons do causing knock down."

And yeah... Dafari are the second easiest faction to fight.  Once you get into higher tier stuff you also get people throwing fire bombs at you, archers that actually hurt, and bosses that can't be staggered/interrupted, etc etc.  Reaper queens are a lot of fun for people who only know the stab and roll approach too.  I know, because I was one of you... until that thing sprayed poision further and wider than i could roll."

40kLore,fc7m1q2,t1_fc5lz47,1577511861.0,"Like i said, back in the day they had more depth.  A Champion of Khorne had to prove himself through both strength and tactics.  So a game of chess could still be a death sentence."

He's as excited to see how many solar sytems a new virus can ""colonise"" as he is to see a woman giving birth to triplets.  The more life, from the microbial to the highly evolved, in the universe the happier (and stronger) he gets.

In older lore the chaos gods had way more depth than they do now.  Khorne was the god of war, blood, and honor.  He would view both a Bretonnian knight, and a blood-crazed psychopath like Kharn as his two greatest champions, even if the Bretonnian was sworn to fight against him.   Villages could be spared by someone beating the invaders leader in a game of tic-tac-toe because breaking an agreement and attacking anyway would invite khornes wrath upon his own followers."

Some thralls get different bonuses from different foods.  Something that gives 14% vitality to a beserker gives thugra 14% str.  

I am slowly filling up a notebook with which food gives which stat to which thrall and its getting annoying.  My named bearer thrall gets the same bonuses as my beserkers, but thugra and n'baku are both different.  Half of the food listed under ""diet"" for Legion Soldier pets gives accuracy.  For a melee-only -pet-.  Feral Flesh, the favorite food of hyenas... gives no leveling bonus to my greaters, and accuracy  to my normals.  

Kinda getting annoyed at the lack of uniformity across follower types, despite what the wiki says..."
creepyPMs,fc4kjsz,t1_fc4emn1,1577419371.0,"Fun part about US law is you can file a lawsuit for anything.  Though in this case, OPs friend won't have to say a word, just hand the judge their phone to see the texts.  The psycho will get to pay her own, and his, court fees, and if she mouths off enough maybe a few hours in a cell for wasting the judges time.

So op, let us know when this gets bumped to Judge Judy so we can watch at home!"
