socialanxiety,ffbjqgq,t3_esjykd,1579768564.0,I think it's just lack of confidence because of SA. Your SA might be telling you that you're ugly and fat or something but the truth is that you're over thinking stuff as always. Please be strong and remember that  your outside beauty doesn't matter and what matters is that you're beautiful from the inside.

socialanxiety,fehadf4,t1_feep9jo,1579112468.0,Thanks but I don't act like that guy in the video. I act like a normal social anxious person. I think I mixed up not talking too much with being mysterious.
socialanxiety,feh9w87,t1_feemo7u,1579112180.0,"Looks like I said something wrongly, I act normal like other classmates I just don't talk too much because of SA and there was that person who told me that you look kind and mysterious which I took as a compliment which might've led me to a belief that being mysterious is something that'll make SOME people interested in you. This  is just my opinion about being/being called mysterious and it's based on my own experience. I know that SA is really bad but it saved me from bad friends, bad decisions, low grades and it brought attention to me."
socialanxiety,fee9dpf,t3_eo9ms9,1579029102.0,I can relate to this... A LOT.
socialanxiety,fee863z,t3_eoobsc,1579028384.0,"TBH, I like to be the quiet one not just because of SA  but also because I think about it as I'm a mysterious guy and people would want to talk to me and discover my personality. Sometimes classmates come to me and ask questions like ""Hey, what's your name"" and ""why are you so quiet"". These questions make me feel that people are interested in me and I really love that feeling. Sometimes SA is a bliss."

I'm pretty sure this is not ok, btw they didn't speak to me for months.

Thanks for the helpful post I'll consider it."

So you wait until someone comes and take an apple to go and get one yourself.
