I was reinforcing the single wall from the other side (next to the stairs) and I bugged.   At the end, the unreachable wall behind the white shelf was reinforced...  everybody lost their mind, it was hilarious"

Affinity,feetbup,t1_feesol0,1579040769.0,"You’ll learn a lot more but creating your own lut.  Learn about colors, find an instagram page that you like and try to copy the style.  (Especially those IG that focus on cities and mute a lot of colors)

I bought Peter McKinnon’s LUTs one day...  never used once...  so yeah, lesson learned"
Affinity,feeqzyr,t1_feeq2hy,1579039356.0,"It depends....    a lut only works with a base photo that will be perfectly shot or shot the way the photographer who made the lut expect the RAW to be.

Like let’s say you use a LUT from Brandon Woelfel for “normal day light” photo...  oh god...

So, you have to match the style or use the lut and then go back to see how you can adjust to match your desire."
Affinity,fee1yso,t1_fedmo1x,1579024717.0,"LUTs are usefully if you have a set of X images and you edit the first one or have one of your own edit workflow saved as a lut, you can apply the lut to everything and save yourself some time.

It’s really useful for video editing once you have all your shots matching.   For photos, yeah, those are more like “filters”"
