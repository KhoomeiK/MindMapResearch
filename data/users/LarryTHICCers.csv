ems,fen0rz6,t1_fegt5yz,1579274405.0,Working EMS I've found that the people with the large EKG tats are generally in it for the uniform and hero status and not very good providers. Just my experience.

ems,fcvx6sm,t1_fcuowab,1578012133.0,"Elderly females are the damn worst for the weird STEMI presentation. Had one a week ago, 67 yoF who just felt weak after doing a full day if walking thru the city with her family doing the sightseeing thing. Normal right? No chest pain, nausea, etc, 0 cardiac history. Lil tachy on scene, she was itching to refuse so it was like pulling teeth to get her in the back and get a 12 lead instead of just getting the refusal and going back in service. 12 lead? Elevation in 2, 3 and 4, and as soon as we get it she passes out. Yeah hon, I'm sorry but we're going to the hospital."

Just because their original goal was accomplished doesn't mean they can't find new ones."
