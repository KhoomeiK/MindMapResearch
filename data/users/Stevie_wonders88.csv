Where they said not only are the jokes scripted but the part when the other guy reacts with another joke is 'planned' aswel.

They generally have a ""pre-interview"" between the guest and a producer, where they ask the guest what they want to talk about, if they have any stories they want to tell, etc. Following that, the producer writes out a card with questions, which the host uses in the interview. So it's planned, but not scripted.

The counter argument is that it was not theirs to sell since it is part of their history and belongs to the Chinese people.




I think both sides have valid points, and unlike the Egyptians I have less sympathy for the Chinese cause they used to treat these artifacts like shit.And if Mao had his way all of it would have been destroyed.

In NY. A lot of the Egyptian statues have vague names like' a bronze statue from Egypt"" they on purpose never look up which king the statue actually represents  since then they would have to acknowledge where it came from.

There is a very famous statue of a greek king that has it's head missing(it's still in greece) But it is titled 'headless greek bronze statue' even though everybody knows who the statue actually represent but they can't say it is the king cause then they have to acknowledge it was illegally brought from Greece since greece already has the missing head and it is an exact match.

&#x200B;

There are also a bunch of statues with their legs missing. ( the legs are still in Greece with the names of the kings still on the pedestal in greece ) They were all taken from a temple.So anybody can actually compare the statues and match them and find out the names of the kings for each of these statues. Buy they refuse  to check it."

If I stand infront of a single step and claim I can't come down because I am afraid of heights would you buy it? It seems like you would but I wouldn't.I would probably link it to a fear of cracking your head or twisting your ankle but not heights.

I am not describing my fear I am describing the fear of heights.

It actually involves being frightened at the concept of falling from a height that would probably kill your or hurt you atleast.

Vertigo maybe the result of having said fear-but you need to be frightened of something in the first place.

What are you afraid of when you stand on an incline? Ankle twist?"
