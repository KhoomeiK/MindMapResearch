worldnews,ffcsnwb,t1_ffcrnsz,1579806451.0,There are very few studies in koala cognition. We do not have a real grasp on their cognitive capabilities. And having a smooth brain (lissencephaly) does not necessarily correlate with intelligence. Plenty of smart animals including rats and some monkeys are lissencephalic.

And as for loved ones, I dont have kids but I cannot imagine the pain of losing a child. A child dying, even if theyre an adult, oftentimes ruins the parents lives.

Awwducational,ff66wyf,t1_ff5mx65,1579620578.0,"True domestication does take thousands of years. Again, the only reason to domesticate more animals is for human selfishness and the want to have a cool pet to control. The wildlife pet trade is also extremely cruel, and is pushing many species towards extinction as its driven primarily by poaching. 

Wild animals that live closely with humans (as in pets, not zoos) do not have better lives 99.9% of the time. They are cut off from access to natural social groups, environments, and diets. I have worked with former pet primates and they, like many other pet primates, often develop neuroses from improper social stimulation and habitat. They are not normal, healthy, happy animals. They like all other wild animals still have their wild instincts, and quickly become violent upon reaching puberty. It is cruel to keep them for pleasure."
Awwducational,ff453fj,t1_ff3z445,1579555728.0,Domestication takes thousands of years. We have no need for any more domesticated species. The only reason to start domesticating another species is for selfish reasons with no regards for the animals welfare.

This monkey is being kept as a pet. Monkeys are not pets, they are wild animals. In order to get this monkey, it either had to be taken off the body of its dead mother (so, poached from the wild), or was sourced from a breeding facility where it was stolen from its mother after a few dayskeeping in mind many monkeys spend years with their mom, so it would be traumatizing for both mom and baby. This all of course encourages poaching. 

Most pet monkeys are cute as babies, but the owners try to get rid of them when they grow up and the owner realizes oh fuck I have an adult wild animal in my house. That can mean just releasing them, killing them, giving them to a lab, or ideally a sanctuary, but the last one is unlikely since sanctuaries are at over capacity. 

Even if the owner keeps the monkey, no nonprofessional can provide the type of environment a wild animal like a monkey needshell, even accredited zoos have trouble with it. Most monkey species are very social and live in large groups, and need lots of physical and cognitive exercise. Without that they become neurotic. I have seen former pet monkeys who spend their time rocking themselves in corners and self-mutilating, some to the point of needing amputations. 

Studies show that just watching videos like this make people think its a) ethically okay to own a pet monkey, and b) that primates are less endangered than they actually are. By posting and sharing these videos, we are encouraging abuse and poaching which is fueling extinctionthe majority of primates are facing extinction within the next century.

Documenting novel cases of tool use in wild animals can inform our understanding of the evolutionary drivers of the behaviors emergence in the natural world. We describe a previously unknown tool-use behavior for wild birds, so far only documented in the wild in primates and elephants. We observed 2 Atlantic puffins at their breeding colonies, one in Wales and the other in Iceland (the latter captured on camera), spontaneously using a small wooden stick to scratch their bodies. The importance of these observations is 3-fold. First, while to date only a single form of body-care-related tool use has been recorded in wild birds (anting), our finding shows that the wild avian tool-use repertoire is wider than previously thought and extends to contexts other than food extraction. Second, we expand the taxonomic breadth of tool use to include another group of birds, seabirds, and a different suborder (Lari). Third, our independent observations span a distance of more than 1,700 km, suggesting that occasional tool use may be widespread in this group, and that seabirds physical cognition may have been underestimated."

Wild animals that live closely with humans (as in pets, not zoos) do not have better lives 99.9% of the time. They are cut off from access to natural social groups, environments, and diets. I have worked with former pet primates and they, like many other pet primates, often develop neuroses from improper social stimulation and habitat. They are not normal, healthy, happy animals. They like all other wild animals still have their wild instincts, and quickly become violent upon reaching puberty. It is cruel to keep them for pleasure."

Given how endangered many primates and other wild animals are, one poached animal can make a big difference.

This monkey is being kept as a pet. Monkeys are not pets, they are wild animals. In order to get this monkey, it either had to be taken off the body of its dead mother (so, poached from the wild), or was sourced from a breeding facility where it was stolen from its mother after a few days—keeping in mind many monkeys spend years with their mom, so it would be traumatizing for both mom and baby. This all of course encourages poaching. 

Most pet monkeys are cute as babies, but the owners try to get rid of them when they grow up and the owner realizes “oh fuck I have an adult wild animal in my house.” That can mean just releasing them, killing them, giving them to a lab, or ideally a sanctuary, but the last one is unlikely since sanctuaries are at over capacity. 

Even if the owner keeps the monkey, no nonprofessional can provide the type of environment a wild animal like a monkey needs—hell, even accredited zoos have trouble with it. Most monkey species are very social and live in large groups, and need lots of physical and cognitive exercise. Without that they become neurotic. I have seen former pet monkeys who spend their time rocking themselves in corners and self-mutilating, some to the point of needing amputations. 

Studies show that just watching videos like this make people think it’s a) ethically okay to own a pet monkey, and b) that primates are less endangered than they actually are. By posting and sharing these videos, we are encouraging abuse and poaching which is fueling extinction—the majority of primates are facing extinction within the next century. 

Lastly, I would like to say that I’m a primatologist, and this opinion is held by every single other wildlife biologist and conservationist. If you love animals and the planet, please do not share or support these videos. 

I am happy to answer any questions, or provide links to studies."

Documenting novel cases of tool use in wild animals can inform our understanding of the evolutionary drivers of the behavior’s emergence in the natural world. We describe a previously unknown tool-use behavior for wild birds, so far only documented in the wild in primates and elephants. We observed 2 Atlantic puffins at their breeding colonies, one in Wales and the other in Iceland (the latter captured on camera), spontaneously using a small wooden stick to scratch their bodies. The importance of these observations is 3-fold. First, while to date only a single form of body-care-related tool use has been recorded in wild birds (anting), our finding shows that the wild avian tool-use repertoire is wider than previously thought and extends to contexts other than food extraction. Second, we expand the taxonomic breadth of tool use to include another group of birds, seabirds, and a different suborder (Lari). Third, our independent observations span a distance of more than 1,700 km, suggesting that occasional tool use may be widespread in this group, and that seabirds’ physical cognition may have been underestimated."
