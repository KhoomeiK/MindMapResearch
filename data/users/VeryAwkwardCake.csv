pcmasterrace,ffjhbkd,t1_ffjg6bh,1579998231.0,"Ah yes :D I've heard a lot of bizarre issues about that, I'd be curious to find out how exactly the discovery packets for this are sent and dealt with to see just how far out you could be with a payload"
pcmasterrace,ffi6b3m,t1_ffi5qmr,1579966239.0,Yeah given how readily boot order seems to get fucked accidentally on enterprise PCs I would imagine just sticking something on a switch somewhere might produce results
blender,ffhz7ng,t1_ffhowir,1579960047.0,Tbf this would have to have a seam somewhere I imagine IRL (or at least you can say that *your* one would :D)
videos,ffhr8vy,t1_ffhob5n,1579949690.0,"Look it doesn't make you a fucking bootlicker not to support every single opinion that would make China bad, I mean it's like I'm not going to call you a CCP drone just because you don't think that Xi is also a serial killer or whatever else on top of all the awful things the Chinese government has already done"
videos,ffhr72m,t1_ffhqq8g,1579949611.0,"No, we do, it's Reddit. If you don't believe every single opinion that could possibly be anti-Chinese then you're obviously a bootlicking shill (which is an oxymoron anyway but who cares)"
videos,ffhr5se,t1_ffhpvyq,1579949553.0,this is the standard of fucking evidence you're all using to make decisions?
blender,ffg7iec,t3_etbl5d,1579900130.0,"I would say the macro imperfections, you have surface roughness, scratches etc but you don't have any large scale variations in the tarmac or color of objects (apart from inside the phone booth)"
limericks,ffckdpx,t1_ffas1o8,1579801318.0,"fuck, thank you"
talesfromtechsupport,ffaghq6,t1_ffagd3t,1579735197.0,Reddit mentality of curiousity and weird obsessiveness I guess. Seems like it happens to everyone here including me.
limericks,ffagbj1,t3_esisue,1579735082.0,"On this sub, you normally find yourself using '\*', not fancy glyphs found in your post. A not so ugly symbol, such as 'fuck', 'bitch' or 'cunt' is also an option.

edit i am a fucking idiot and i realise this comment makes me seem like i have had a stroke"
bookscirclejerk,ffafwim,t3_esijq0,1579734803.0,I think it's disgusting that they would jump straight to making the 22nd book (24th if you include the prequels) just because it was the most popular
