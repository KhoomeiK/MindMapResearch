JusticeServed,fd8ohcu,t1_fd7ctki,1578220939.0,"a mentally-ill family friend of ours got killed by the cops — he was schizophrenic, in his late 30s, unarmed. six cops beat the shit out of him as he was literally crying out for his dad and begging for his life. the only reason he got taken to the hospital is cus there was a paramedic attending to one of the cops’ minor injuries and noticed the dude laying in a puddle of his own blood. he was beaten into a coma and never woke up. 

the PD released a statement saying the guy was resisting and refusing to comply w police orders and gave the cops two broken bones. but the whole fucking incident was caught on multiple videos, so later they “corrected” that statement and confirmed that no one suffered any notable injuries aside from the guy they killed. it really shook up the entire city, people were livid."
