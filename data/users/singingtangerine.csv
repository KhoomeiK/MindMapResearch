Essentially all day your body needs a certain amount of energy to live. Functions like breathing, heart beating, even THINKING require calories (fun fact your brain uses up like 25% of the calories in your whole body). People who are smaller need less of those calories b/c their bodies literally just take up less energy. So eating less forces your body to find its energy from other areas, like stored fat, muscles, and bones. That‚Äôs why so many anorexics have health issues - their bodies doesn‚Äôt have enough calories to actually keep bones &  muscles moving, and needs to like ‚Äúeat them up‚Äù to keep basic stuff (digestion, brain function) intact

Fruit decidedly does not have too much sugar or carbs. Fruit is fibrous, so its carbs are digested a little differently.
