For example, I'm 20, but I know happiness won't be here until I'm maybe 30 or 35, stable, big family, calm, and ready to retire at an early age.
That's my definition of happiness, but for you it's going to be there soon, as long as you keep working.

In this thing called life, we take losses and we win. My word of advice is this.

Don't find happiness, let happiness find you. Let the little moments fullfil you, whether it be your favorite food, drink, studying, result of your hard work, anything really. 

That's why they say you have to appreciate the little things in life. And maybe you're one of those folks, nothing wrong with that at all."

Maybe that's your way of relaxation (the small moments), knowing you're working toward your goal. And maybe one day all the sacrifice will make you happy, genuinely, life is very strange.

I'll tell you this though, you have a gift of hard work. You don't procrastinate like most people do, hell even I procrastinate (I never get much done, unless it's something that interests me). You're gonna be a great person in the future, maybe a ceo, boss, or other higher position. You're a damn machine and if that's what makes you feel good, that's all that matters. Even though I think you should take a break, it's not my opinion that matters here. Keep trucking and happiness will await you in the near future."

If I did a crime out in the UK, then came back to America, I'd be sent back to that country for the crime. 

Don't stress about this, there's plenty of people who do way more weird things. I doubt bosses and others care, as long as they keep it professional at the workplace."

When I was in boxing, my trainer would throw punches. But as soon as he saw a flaw in my defense, he would slow down his punch, then give me a warning. Tell your pops to kinda go easy at first when you're warming up. Sparring is training also, but you can never be too safe.

Have a cozy day/night wherever you're at and happy new year."

Just because it's announced, doesn't mean it's ready to be heard yet. The project might be done with tracklisting and so forth. But quality over quantity is what matters. And this goes for any rapper (with some exceptions obviously).

You might say Griselda records for example, drops multiple projects a year. But that's Griselda and their style of being consistent. 

With SB you gotta understand, these guys put in work from early 2014 all the way to 2016. So they got over 20 releases (some being full length) and some of you still bitch and complain? You want these guys to work like slaves? When in reality they're just like you, except they do music as a career.

And I bet some of these ""fans"" haven't even listened to the sagas. I became a fan back in 2016 and I still haven't gotten burnt out from their music. I looked at their older stuff before I even touched their projects from that year.

So go back and listen to those all the way up until recently if you want. I listen to a lot of an artist's old music before they drop something new, you should do the same.

Point I'm trying to make is, be patient cuz they couldn't have said anything at all and made you wait longer. If you disagree, then downvote me, but gosh damn it gets really annoying with the negative comments."
