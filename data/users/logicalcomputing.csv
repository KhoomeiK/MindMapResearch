unpopularopinion,felr3na,t1_fe0dqvk,1579228884.0,You can talk about my taxes going up when you pay as much as I do in taxes. Otherwise shut up about them.
unpopularopinion,felqzyc,t1_felqhv4,1579228814.0,"Cops don't respond because when they do respond it's automatically ""discrimination"" or ""racial profiling."""
unpopularopinion,felpy10,t1_felol7p,1579228087.0,"No, it's building codes and not allowing apartment buildings and sky rises instead of residential single family houses that keep prices high. Not my 1% tax versus 2.5% which is what it would go to if prop 13 were repealed (for residential properties). No, I'm not the reason why housing is in the state it's in. I didn't write the rules."
unpopularopinion,felpsvi,t1_felp0vb,1579227989.0,"It honestly wouldn't surprise me if 20 million people were in bankruptcy. That's what caused 2008 to happen, people buying more house than they could afford. It will eventually happen again."
unpopularopinion,felnrv9,t1_felnj49,1579226594.0,Why would you want to repeal prop 13 for homeowners?? That would just make it more un affordable for people like myself to stay in the same house and I'd be forced to leave and make it harder for you to own a house.
unpopularopinion,felnfm9,t1_feln917,1579226357.0,Low income means not being able to afford. You're literally admitting that the most amount of people are living in poverty and proving what I said as right.
unpopularopinion,felnc5m,t1_felnajl,1579226292.0,I do. Southern California is horrible when it comes to zoning laws. Can't say much about Nor Cal since I've never  lived there.

If so many people want to live here why are more people leaving??"
unpopularopinion,feln6mk,t1_felmx3p,1579226187.0,So what you're really admitting is that most Californians live JUST above the poverty level....

unpopularopinion,fdz8lcx,t1_fdz8hmy,1578787735.0,"Okay, then who does pay for it? The money's gotta come from somewhere. Government takes money from people, so it's your money either way. Dumbass."
unpopularopinion,fdz8jnz,t1_fdz88r9,1578787719.0,"Some taxes and regulations are fine, just not when you exploit your every day Americans and make them pay up the ass to where it's cheaper not to work than it is to go into the office and bust my ass off for ungrateful people."
unpopularopinion,fdz8c7u,t1_fdz7w83,1578787645.0,"Right, 44% of people are not putting their money where their mouth is. That's my point, dude. Talk to me about ""income equality"" when 100% of workers pay their fair share and then we can talk about my taxes."
unpopularopinion,fdz83yh,t1_fdz7jpp,1578787566.0,Is that your definition of socialism? Because there are several different ones. Do you believe in state ownership of private production? If you don't then stop taxing private people like myself at the rates that we currently are taxed at.
unpopularopinion,fdz7a8c,t1_fdz70ym,1578787383.0,"Uh, that's exactly what free college is dude. You pay via taxes for other people's educations. That's LITERALLY what free college is."

Tell me that again dude when 44% of Americans pay ZERO federal income taxes. I have a problem with people telling folks like me to ""pay their fair share"" when they don't pay ANY share at all!"
unpopularopinion,fdz6275,t1_fdz5x8b,1578787079.0,So you ARE paying for other people dude. If I make 100 grand and someone else makes 20 grand I'm paying for someone who makes 20 grand. My spouse and I would be better off working from home and taking care of the kids. And if you're not paying for everyone else why don't you pay for your own way and I pay for my own way? Just stop rationalizing the confiscation of my family's money.
unpopularopinion,fdz5fjz,t1_fdz5ctp,1578786881.0,"Zero, debt that I HAD? About 20 grand in student loans that I worked to pay off. And why does it matter? How much debt do you have?"
unpopularopinion,fd6u1z8,t1_fd6hsgb,1578195711.0,"Yes an econ degree from any random school won't go anywhere. Which a business degree means you NEED a top school for it and it's not the degree that's specialized it's the school name that carried your resume. The problem with degrees like business or economics is that the material is very general and isn't specific towards any set of jobs you can get and it's the most common college major so your competition to get the same jobs is greater than those with a ""harder"" major (IE Nursing, Mechanical engineering, etc)"
unpopularopinion,fd6tsq7,t1_fd6m8nq,1578195616.0,Then don't go into debt for an education and pay cash if it's not about the money and if it's not about the money why are universities charging tens of thousands of dollars per year for general degrees with government lenders guaranteeing shitty loan deals? If it's priceless why do we have 1.5 trillion dollars in student loan debt as a country? Apparently it does have a major pricetag...
unpopularopinion,fd6fore,t1_fd6fm5q,1578190276.0,Business degrees are not specialized and neither is economics.
unpopularopinion,fd6ewjn,t1_fd6end9,1578189934.0,Degrees that aren't in specialized fields are all useless. There are only a few degrees that are really worth a shit in college. It sucks but it's true.
unpopularopinion,fd6egj7,t1_fd6ecas,1578189730.0,"Dude, you didn't even read the first fucking sentence and started judging my post."
unpopularopinion,fd6e5ks,t1_fd6e4bw,1578189598.0,It's literally the fucking first sentence dude.
unpopularopinion,fd6dzf8,t1_fd6dlqg,1578189526.0,"Uh did you not read the entire post where I said "" Obviously I'm not talking about fields where you need your education to actually get into the field ?""

unpopularopinion,fd4fkwt,t1_fa80niy,1578167077.0,"Biased baby boomer teacher.. Of course you're so far detached from reality with your government job leaching off the tax payers (with your pension and overpaid medical benefits and only 9 months worth of ""work"" a year) such as myself and that you bought your house years ago and don't know about how hard it really is in the real world. The average house price in California is 600 grand. Unless you're living in the desert or in Fresno or Bakersfield on 55k you can make it but good luck finding a job there. Do you really think you can buy a 600000 house on 55k? REALLY?? How delusional are you teachers?"

unpopularopinion,fctbpwo,t1_fct7zag,1577938311.0,"Yeah, support them... Until they're an adult at 18. Then you're on your own buddy. You'd support your adult children after 18? Sorry at 18 you need a JOB."
unpopularopinion,fct2gql,t1_fct1vem,1577931146.0,Well they're entitled to do whatever they want with it. If they're jerks they'd be jerks whether or not they had money.  Money just amplifies the qualities you already have.
unpopularopinion,fcszasq,t1_fcsz44g,1577928860.0,Do I really need to explain any of this to you? Have you never had a job? Your responses suggest you've never worked a day in your life before.

There's no reason you can't work as an electrician and get your degree part time in CS or IT which will come in handy when your body becomes weaker in old age (which I'd recommend as a fall back)."
college,fcsx1dk,t3_eip1ux,1577927266.0,Most colleges aren't as selective as you think they are except for the top Ivy league schools. If you have a decent GPA and SAT score you will get into most places. It's only once you get to the top 20-50 where you are actually scrutinized in your application.

Of course the percentage is going to be higher when you compare, but if you look at the raw numbers CA is by far worse. That's like saying if I grew from 50% to 100% and doubled my sales I grew by  50% in a given year. That's nonsense especially if my numbers went from 2 to 4 sales in a year. You should be comparing apples to apples. New York and California, California to Texas, etc."
unpopularopinion,fa6wzvj,t1_fa6wmev,1575829339.0,"Yeah I have. They are very well balanced (compared to other major metros and states). I've spent a lot of time in Texas and Oregon / Washington. Texas is fairly moderate compared to other southern states (again, see Austin) and Oregon / Washington aren't actually as blue as people think they are outside of the major cities. The best places to live are the ones where there are checks and balances - the biggest checks and balances being that they don't have one party majority rule. (Austin is liberal just like Los Angeles is). I've been to Austin, Waco, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and Corpus Christi multiple times and Seattle / Portland (and outside of Portland many times) and neither state is as bad as California - when it comes to extreme politics and extreme wealth / poverty."
