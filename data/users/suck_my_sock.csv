A caviat on the spices- I use a lot of specific things because I grow and dry my own peppers. Use what you like,  just wanted to write out what I used.

For the beef and veggie mixture. 
1)  Beef- make and set aside

I used 1.25 lbs 73% beef. I added:
3/4 tsp dried ground thai chili
3/4 tsp dried ground jalapeno
1/2 tsp dried ground long ceyenne
1/2 green dried ground green chili with a pinch of poblano
1/4 tsp dried ground peppercinni 
1 tsp dried ground assorted bell pepper
Heavy tsp garlic powder
Heavy tsp onion powder
1/2 tsp garlic salt
1/2 tsp black pepper
Dash of mustard powder
Dash of ground sage
2 pinches of oregano
--- combine well by hand, set aside in refrigerator up to 24 hours. Before needed.

2) make your bacon/bread crumbs/cut or shred cheese.set aside
8pcs bacon- crumble

Breadcrumbs - slice up some old baguette style bread into 1 inch cubes. I bought fresh and baked it at 200 until it was what I wanted, nice and dry cubes. Or use stale bread already hard.

1 small package of pepper jack, Monterey jack, and a bit of sharp cheddar.

3) make the veggies/add beef/1 can chopped stewed tomatoes brand of choice.
1 large red onion finely chopped
1/2 yellow onion finely chopped
5 mushrooms cut extra fine
1 green bell pepper chopped

I use bacon grease to grease the pan when I have it. 10/10 would recommend. Tbsp grease of butter in the hot pan. Saute veggies til almost done, add the beef you prepared earlier. Saute til beef is cooked through. Add can of stewed tomatoes. Simmer on low heat while you prepare remaining items. I had to add a half cup of water to keep it the consistency I wanted. 

4) grease casserole dish and dust with parmesan cheese. 

5)Open can of diced green chilis

6) combine all in layers.
I got three layers total.

I baked at 400 F. First 30 minutes lid on casserole dish, last 30 without it. 

Let stand 5 or so minutes. Gorge yourself."
