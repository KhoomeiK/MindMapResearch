worldnews,fffyltv,t1_fffyclf,1579894643.0,"> No, it's not. Or to be precise: positive discrimination is a good thing. It's negative discrimination that is bad.

Okay... so you are contradicting yourself here and saying it is and isn’t discrimination at the same time."
worldnews,fffvlzl,t1_fffsngx,1579892769.0,"> Honestly, by what logic can encouraging diversity be considered discrimination?

When you are picking and choosing who to support and who not to based off of their race/gender/sexuality that is by definition discrimination. 

> It isn't discrimination, because Goldman isn't saying ""No more old white dudes, thanks."" They're saying, ""We make more money off companies with a diverse representation of backgrounds and ideas than we do off the old baby boomer model.""

So if Goldman was refusing to run IPOs for companies with female teams under the assumption that they underperform and wouldn’t make as much money that wouldn’t be discrimination?"

 You seemed to have completely missed the point of my initial and subsequent comment.

I could say that a solution would make use of a combination of social, economic, genetic, cultural, etc factors but to be honest I’m not an expert on complex social problems nor claim to be. What I can tell you however is that the first step to addressing and solving any problem is recognizing there is a problem in the first place. Launching immediately into “well how do you fix this complex problem” while tacitly refusing to accept the premise there is a problem really doesn’t get us anywhere."
SeattleWA,fffh0il,t1_fffd1ya,1579883770.0,"Besides the fact that balancing for income there is a strong racial disparity in crime in the US, that is not even a relevant fact when discussing whether black people commit more violent crime. Poverty is undoubtably a factor, but whenever anyone brings up the stat shouting “whatabout poverty? Whatabout this? Whatabout that?” is a distraction and whether you mean it to or not, has an effect of distraction and derailing of what is really at hand."
SeattleWA,ffe3nin,t1_ffdweon,1579835847.0,"Would not the first step be to acknowledge that these facts are true?

todayilearned,ff3awbm,t1_ff2j8ul,1579537617.0,"Toronto was famously religiously divided (and still is). In those days it was between the English and Ulster Protestant majority and a minority of Irish and (to a lesser extent) Italian catholics. It was bad enough that the police chief had to be cycled between a Catholic and a Protestant each time to keep everyone happy. In the 50s it looked like the protestants had won as the catholic population waned, however division has again been sowed in Toronto in a different axis with the introduction of the multiculturalism laws and mass migration from the 70s onward"

todayilearned,fdrrqyq,t1_fdpzgb1,1578688769.0,"I live in Toronto where a huge proportion of the population is foreign born or have foreign born parents. The effect this has had on the language is interesting to me. A staggering amount of people born here don’t speak English well and often speak it in a very idiosyncratic way to such a degree you can often tell what neighbourhood they’re from. I’m guessing this is from their only real exposure to English being through school, most of their exposure to language was at home and through each other. It is starting to have an influence on how “native” Canadians in the GTA speak, particularly those who stayed in their communities after they were transformed from white working class to immigrant. It is a fascinating thing to watch, if mildly disconcerting."
