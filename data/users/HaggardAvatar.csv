I've received a response from one of the mods saying ""trolls always win"" which may be the most honest point to the argument. By that logic, the mods are trying to save everyone a bunch of effort of defense by just using the ban hammer on their relative opinions. I personally do not agree with it whatsoever. The ""troll wins"" by argument and establishing frustration or other negative feelings in others. If you all would use downvote and not comment respond, they would go away as there is no real attention to be gained. In all caps I will state this clearly - IF THIS WAS THE RESPONSE TO TROLLS ANYWHERE ON THE INTERNET, THEY WOULD REDUCE IN NUMBER GREATLY.

Tronix,fdfn186,t1_fdehtgw,1578365476.0,"I understand where you are coming from. I do not take questions like these as offensive or get mad or anything. There are many in the community that do and I believe it's the psychology behind it if you think about it. These crypto ""assets"" (sometimes currency, sometimes stake in ownership) all represent things that people put their REAL money into. Some people who FOMO'd into their preferred projects went into it very hard with more money than they should have. These are the type of people that see the tweets of people selling BTC for $4 after making 1000x return already, and still missed out by not staying with the BTC for even longer. They are frustrated they have not become millionaires overnight and focus that frustration on anyone who is questioning (even genuinely) the crypto asset they have invested their interest in. Any questioning is generally seen as counter to adoption of the asset, and adoption is what makes the value increase by the simple law of supply and demand. In addition to this, people from all projects get frustrated by others from other projects coming along to shit on their project just to make the other look more favorable to new ""investors"". There, of course, have been many scams (google bitconnect) that exist, so that makes anyone calling any project a scam (without solid proof) another hot topic to touch because it can make new ""investors"" stray away. 

To answer your question about why would you or another average consumer put your money into TRX, we should address why I call the people doing this new ""investors"". The use of quotations on investor is intentional since that's essentially what anyone putting their money into the crypto asset is doing. You're investing in the idea. This is why so many people constantly want to see, or talk about, or better understand the ""white paper"". This represents the general idea around the crpto asset structure and goals for the future. Other reasons to put money into the crypto space besides just essentially betting it will increase in value are things that dictate the supply/demand dynamic. Examples of this would be more like a utility token or coin. Vechain, Golem, and many others try to do this. For a while I was particularly interested in golem because as I understood it at the time, you could allow your PC to use bandwidth for projects that needed computing power and they would pay you in the token. This would also mean people who needed computing power would need to purchase the token to then pay to those with extra computing power.

So short answer that's important to know about anything (including BTC) in the crypto space: No one knows the future, try your best to make sure you're not going into a scam or easily manipulated project, and most importantly DO NOT put in any more real life money into this than you're willing to actually lose."
Tronix,fdegxra,t3_ekxixn,1578338787.0,"Iíll do my best to make a point that will probably not be taken well.

If you replace TRX with BTC and make the same post in a bitcoin sub, what reasons would they give that also donít apply here? The point of blockchain technology applied to most currency based coins (or tokens for that matter) is that it canít be cheated or printed into worthlessness by any one governing body. If the Fed wanted to print US money into nothing in the next year, they definitely could do that. This cannot be done with BTC or TRX and many more examples in the crypto world. 

Now maybe your biggest question should be ìhow do economies based on trade of a central currency develop, work, or become established. This, my friend, is a very tough question to predict the outcome of for any basis to become established.

I agree youíre hinting itís more of a gamble now than anything in the crypto space to be placing bets (so to speak) on TRX or any other ìaltî coin. However, from a casual TRX holders perspective, I have yet to see evidence that the block chain of TRX has any issues with hacking or robbing, or scamming. Iíll add that if you can supply this information to help educate me, Iíll gladly read up on it. I have found none on my own.

This does not mean the electricity headed to your home CAME from renewable power generation.

If people think this list is bad (and it is) it is mainly because of the real image/video attached to it. There are much more disturbing realities of past conquer and conquest with the stories of death/torture and morbid enjoyment. However, this far away from those ìstoriesî makes it more of a cliche or write off of ìearly civilization was so barbaricî. The truth is that shit was insane. After seeing things on your list here, those early stories and facts should be much more in perspective to those newly discovering the knowledge. The holocaust, Khan raids, even shit from the bible, and countless other accounts, all insanely disturbing and inhumane but so far away we feel entitled to be separated from.

Can anyone tell me or link me to a good source for PV efficiency to electricity? 

Last article I saw years ago was about 10%. Worth noting is the ~35% listed for best achievable steam would need to be multiplied by the efficiency of the thermal fluid solar capture efficiency as well. So the capture efficiency to the solar fluid times the .35 for the steam to electric conversation of the ranking cycle."

There are many in the community that do and I believe it's the psychology behind it if you think about it. These crypto ""assets"" (sometimes currency, sometimes stake in ownership) all represent things that people put their REAL money into. Some people who FOMO'd into their preferred projects went into it very hard with more money than they should have. These are the type of people that see the tweets of people selling BTC for $4 after making 1000x return already, and still missed out by not staying with the BTC for even longer. They are frustrated they have not become millionaires overnight and focus that frustration on anyone who is questioning (even genuinely) the crypto asset they have invested their interest in. Any questioning is generally seen as counter to adoption of the asset, and adoption is what makes the value increase by the simple law of supply and demand. In addition to this, people from all projects get frustrated by others from other projects coming along to shit on their project just to make the other look more favorable to new ""investors"". There, of course, have been many scams (google bitconnect) that exist, so that makes anyone calling any project a scam (without solid proof) another hot topic to touch because it can make new ""investors"" stray away. 

To answer your question about why would you or another average consumer put your money into TRX, we should address why I call the people doing this new ""investors"". The use of quotations on investor is intentional since that's essentially what anyone putting their money into the crypto asset is doing. You're investing in the idea. This is why so many people constantly want to see, or talk about, or better understand the ""white paper"". This represents the general idea around the crpto asset structure and goals for the future. Other reasons to put money into the crypto space besides just essentially betting it will increase in value are things that dictate the supply/demand dynamic. Examples of this would be more like a utility token or coin. Vechain, Golem, and many others try to do this. For a while I was particularly interested in golem because as I understood it at the time, you could allow your PC to use bandwidth for projects that needed computing power and they would pay you in the token. This would also mean people who needed computing power would need to purchase the token to then pay to those with extra computing power.

So short answer that's important to know about anything (including BTC) in the crypto space: No one knows the future, try your best to make sure you're not going into a scam or easily manipulated project, and most importantly DO NOT put in any more real life money into this than you're willing to actually lose."
Tronix,fdegxra,t3_ekxixn,1578338787.0,"I‚Äôll do my best to make a point that will probably not be taken well.

If you replace TRX with BTC and make the same post in a bitcoin sub, what reasons would they give that also don‚Äôt apply here? The point of blockchain technology applied to most currency based coins (or tokens for that matter) is that it can‚Äôt be cheated or printed into worthlessness by any one governing body. If the Fed wanted to print US money into nothing in the next year, they definitely could do that. This cannot be done with BTC or TRX and many more examples in the crypto world. 

Now maybe your biggest question should be ‚Äúhow do economies based on trade of a central currency develop, work, or become established. This, my friend, is a very tough question to predict the outcome of for any basis to become established.

I agree you‚Äôre hinting it‚Äôs more of a gamble now than anything in the crypto space to be placing bets (so to speak) on TRX or any other ‚Äúalt‚Äù coin. However, from a casual TRX holders perspective, I have yet to see evidence that the block chain of TRX has any issues with hacking or robbing, or scamming.

AskReddit,fchdi4i,t1_fcgjtm7,1577649516.0,"Knowledge is leveling no matter what side of life it comes from. One is changed by the knowledge gained in unpredictable ways. True ‚Äúbad‚Äù or even what we call true ‚Äúevil‚Äù and the knowledge that it exists in reality and not just in the capability to imagine things is what allows for practical fear or realizations that we do not need to push the needle further into the unknown. The rules we were born into that most take as concrete evidence without question, most may not understand, but were built over centuries of the realities of possibility.

The curse of knowledge in your comment is also a curse of practical understanding of the generic rules to live between. If people think this list is bad (and it is) it is mainly because of the real image/video attached to it. There are much more disturbing realities of past conquer and conquest with the stories of death/torture and morbid enjoyment. However, this far away from those ‚Äústories‚Äù makes it more of a cliche or write off of ‚Äúearly civilization was so barbaric‚Äù. The truth is that shit was insane. After seeing things on your list here, those early stories and facts should be much more in perspective to those newly discovering the knowledge. The holocaust, Khan raids, even shit from the bible, and countless other accounts, all insanely disturbing and inhumane but so far away we feel entitled to be separated from. 

I wish you well in this life. Do good and be good to others. Only give and treat people how they deserve and nothing or or less.

To anyone else reading this rambling line of thoughts in this dark thread, enjoy the bloom of all things worth experiencing. It‚Äôs short. The light never seems as good as when the dark is escaped from. The sunny days would be nothing without the rainy ones."
science,fch1rxv,t3_eh8ijm,1577646434.0,"If this was used for a heat exchanger for a steam plant (assuming energies and thermo prinicpals would allow for high temp conversations at transfer) the total efficiency would be around that of the best achievable operating pressure/temperature of steam plans today (~35% net).

Can anyone tell me or link me to a good source for PV efficiency to electricity? 

Last article I saw years ago was about 10%. Worth noting is the ~35% listed for best achievable steam would need to be multiplied by the efficiency of the thermal fluid solar capture efficiency as well. So the capture efficiency to the solar fluid times the .35 for the steam to electric conversation of the ranking cycle."
