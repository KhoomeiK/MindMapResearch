SeriousConversation,ff5uv6d,t3_erscu0,1579611056.0,"Absolutely. But only you can decide that.

Grief bubbles burble up when they will. Some big. Some small. Some all encompassing with full body heaves to those you can experience with a small sweet tang of loss. They are personal and individual. If they become all encompassing or you feel stuck within the grief and can't function the way you want to in life, then finding help to help process them may be in order. 

Sounds like you were missing your beloved pup a little bit and then when you heard the name, it just hit you in the feels. Nothing wrong with that. 

Grief is a process."
