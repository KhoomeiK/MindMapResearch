AnimalsBeingBros,fegsasg,t1_fegoc0p,1579101376.0,My dad has the same problem. Pack rats have eaten wires in his truck twice these last couple months. They’ve got barn cats for that reason but it sounds like he needs to be keeping a cat around the house too. I don’t think my dad ever would’ve gotten a cat otherwise but now he seems to like them.
videos,feeqzk5,t1_feelrhi,1579039350.0,"Thanks for posting this, that was very educational and neat to see people realizing their mistake and apologizing whilst still preserving their friendship. That’s like the best case scenario of correcting someone in a way that actually reaches them. Really cool."
corgi,fdrx0on,t1_fdrafe1,1578690973.0,"Holy fuck...thank you for saying this..we have HUGE raccoons in my neighborhood. My parents have corgis and I have yorkies but I was never super worried about the raccoons, especially around their not tiny corgis. But now I will definitely be worried and be cautious. Good lord."
actuallesbians,fdndm01,t1_fdn7733,1578583543.0,"Oh my gosh, you’re not kidding. I moved to Oregon from Arkansas and whilst there are a lot of open minded people here, especially compared to the south, it honestly feels like the conservatives up here are worse than the ones I grew up with. It’s like they are bolder and angrier because they know they’re outnumbered here and it infuriates them. I’ve had more assholes comment on my short hair here in the northwest than I ever experienced in the south. Like in Arkansas I might have a gotten a side eye or a whisper or something but up here I’ve had random men blatantly point and laugh or yell some dumb insult at me. It’s wild."
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fdf5iwr,t1_fdesh91,1578353786.0,"I honestly did this as a kid because I didn’t like the overwhelming chocolate taste, felt like it needed something in it like nuts or Rice Krispies. But it came with paper so I tried it and it wasn’t terrible. I came to prefer it with the paper. I don’t do that now but I can’t deny that I am tempted to, every time."

SALEM,fdbk5e1,t1_fdb003v,1578258166.0,There’s a lot of questions that are repeatedly asked and get repeatedly answered. It’s not a huge deal especially because this sub is not super active.
