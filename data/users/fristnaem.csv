NOTE: I'm aware of BCE. I still use BC because it's historic and more people understand it. Deal with it.

I was a funda-gelical growing up (and young-earth creationist). I had to reconcile the fact that I believed that the dinosaurs did not coexist with humans (as well as a lot of other science-based beliefs). To do this, I proposed an ""old earth"" solution: the ""first day"" does not directly follow the creation of the world. (You'll note the text in Genesis 1 says that the world was a pre-existing entity, this means God could have created life then destroyed it and reset it to the point where ""darkness was over the face of the deep and the spirit of God was over the waters.""). This solves the problem of dinosaurs (part of a proto-creation) along with the 6,000 year old world (the first day happened 6,000 years ago.)

Now, why did God do something so convoluted? I have no idea. He's God.

I'm not saying I believe this anymore, but this is a quasi-reasonable approach to the problem which accounts for both the young-earth nonsense as well as allowing for (most of) a scientific approach including things like various forms of radiation-based dating.

Of course, this doesn't deal with the fact that we have clear evidence of human civilization dating back to 10k BC, but I didn't know about that at the time. Though I suppose that could easily be explained by saying that there are generations between Adam and Abraham which have no age listed. If these are in the hundreds (like the earlier generations) instead of in the decades (like those after Moses), then this can push the age of the earth to 11k BC relatively easily.

Alternatively, you could argue that ""son"" in the Biblical sense does not mean immediate descendant. You'll note that Matthew specifically omits generations in his genealogy, you'll also note that Jesus is the son of David. This means there could be scores, even hundreds of generations after Noah and before Abraham. Since two-dozen generations puts my family back into Medieval England, I figure that makes me at most a few hundred from 6000 BC. this means the Bible would only need to omit another few hundred names and we're already back at the scientific consensus surrounding the birth of man.

# OR..... You could believe that the world arose through natural processes. It's a much simpler model after all."

emotionalabuse,fcky1ld,t3_ehqo7c,1577735639.0,"That's normal. I didn't believe my wife was gaslighting even though people around me said she was. I kept thinking, ""But she doesn't really do that."" And what made it worse was that she claimed that conversations happened which couldn't have or that my understanding of her plain words was wrong. But it was always, ""Not that bad."" It wasn't that she hated me it was just.......... that she was abusive, that she behaved in ways I would never dream of, that she wasn't willing to admit that I was right even when faced with irrefutable proof. She gaslights. She gives me mutually contradictory requests and then blames me for the results. She gets angry when I volunteer to do something and angry when I don't. And the list goes on.

This type of behavior went on for years. And over that time, I thought it was me, that I was at fault. I thought that I was defective. And when I finally started looking at things objectively I saw that this was not true. I saw that the way she treated me \*was\* hateful.

Abuse often leads us to believe the worst about ourselves. It often leads to self-hatred. And most often it leads us to believe that ""we deserve it"" or that ""it isn't that bad."""
