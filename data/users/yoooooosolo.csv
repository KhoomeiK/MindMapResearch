backpain,fepi2cr,t3_eq2fig,1579321045.0,"Start with the basic progressions, and doing more repetitions before moving on to a harder progression. 

Bird dogs actually get harder the better you get at doing them. Focus on keeping your shoulders and hips level with the ground, and when you extend, tighten your core without letting hips, shoulders, or lower back sag at all. If a single rep is easy, try holding for ten seconds. 

I always found that trying an exercise for a few reps and sets was important, because I don't always feel the effects of an aggravating exercise until later or the next day. Always stop if it hurts"

backpain,fenkp5q,t1_fenebel,1579286752.0,"Four years ago, at my worst, I developed stomach issues first from taking 1600mg of ibuprofen to get through the day, then switching to naproxen to the same effect. I would say my pain level was at least a 4 (with cracked ribs being around a 7) like 80% of the time. 

Now if I work out hard, my back might get up to a level 2 pain foe a day or two. 

I'd developed a ton of fascia around my sciatic nerve, so it was immobile. ""Nerve flossing"" recommended by a chiro helped a ton in that case. I had to start rebuilding the strength and mobility of my whole posterior chain. 

I'm now still not lifting, but I'm running, jumping, doing pullups and handstands, and I'm relatively pain free. 

I really had to work hard to find the program that worked for me, basically independently. Of course the orthopedic specialist recommended ""exploratory surgery"" after 2 months of physio wasn't successful."

You can add bird dogs, dead bugs, reverse hypers, ido portal's squat program, and if you're worried snot losing strength, do bodyweight exercises one leg at a time. You should be developing those stability muscles anyway (if you're not already) so lunges are the most basic, Bulgarian split squats, shrimp squats, pistol squat progressions being the hardest

Edit: I forgot yoga. Look up YouTube yoga routines, there's some great ones specifically for lower back pain/sciatica. Ease into them if it's your first time, and don't hurt yourself doing something you can't do yet. It's been a huge part of my recovery."

leangains,fee9dib,t1_fee81y5,1579029098.0,"I add olive oil or butter to my rice cooker/one pot meals, and the almonds and ground flax seed have a lot of good fats too. During the summer I make a huge batch of overnight oats that lasts pretty much all week. I don't skimp on full fat yogurt, sour cream, and cheese. Getting a pantry full of spice mixes and seasonings is crucial for being veggie imo. I'm actually flexitarian, as I eat a little bit of meat on special occasions, and sometimes put some good quality stock (chicken or beef) into foods when I cook. ""Better than bouillon"" has delicious concentrated stocks that add a lot of flavor to otherwise vegetarian meals (like beef stock into spaghetti sauce) and because they're made with a lot of bones etc. boiled down, they have a ton of micronutrients from the marrow etc. My mostly meatless diet is for health rather than ethical reasons, so I don't have issue with this, though it means I'm not really vegetarian. Deluxe mixed nuts can be eaten almost like a multivitamin, as thre variety has a lot of micronutrients too, like selenium in Brazil nuts. Just a small handful every day instead of crushing the can in two or three sittings. 

Stop by r/vegetarian, r/veganfitness, and r/ricecookerrecipes sometime for more in depth look at balanced nutrition. It's totally doable on a small budget if you put some effort in."

leangains,fedqeqb,t3_eojrf8,1579017640.0,"If you're trying to bulk, I'd ditch the IF. Eat as much as you can as many times a day as you can. If you want to go veggie, buy a lot of nuts in bulk too. I'm slowly gaining on a veggie diet (coupled with pretty rigorous training) and doing a huge batch of oatmeal every morning with frozen bulk blueberries, oatmeal from the big tube, almonds and ground flax seed with some honey. That winds up weighing about a pound and a half as I do almost equal parts oatmeal, berries and almonds.

I do most of my rice and beans meals in my rice cooker. 3/4cup rice or brown rice, 1/4 cup red quinoa, one rinsed can of beans, a can of rotel (tomatoes and chilies), a hefty spoonful of chili powder, spicy seasoned salt, curry paste/powder etc. Measure the rice quinoa water first for the right ratio then add whatever you want: beans, corn, spinach, tomatoes, shredded carrots from a bag, etc.

Make sure you're getting a ton of veggies. Figure out what day your closest grocery store restocks the produce section and go right before or right after to get the markdowns, mushrooms especially get marked down as they go a little brown and wet after being on the shelf a week but they cook down great in these one-pot type meals. Don't worry about getting stuff that doesn't look like it belongs on the food network, its still packed with nutrients and when you cook it down it's all the same. I get those big plastic boxes of mixed greens on sale all the time and wilt them down with olive oil and seasonings, it's delicious over rice with a couple eggs on top (n/a for vegan obvs). See if you can find trail mix without a bunch of chocolate junk in it: Walmart has 2lb bags of great mixes for like $7. Snack on those after breakfast and after lunch. Dried fruit like apricots and prunes are cheap and stay good foreverish too. 

Aldi has spaghetti made from edamame that's loaded with protien, and goes well underneath any of these mixes too, they're pretty cheap as well. Try to get as many ""colors"" into your diet as you can. Potatoes (washed with skin on), sweet potatoes, kale, collards, bell peppers, lots of different types of beans, vary your diet. You can still keep it cheap and be healthy"

The only exception is a few upscale restaurant/ bars that I've been to that understand the density of flavor necessary for a real mocktail. I had one recently that was like brown sugar and fresh ginger muddled with juice of 2 limes, and a splash of soda or something on top, it was so strong in flavor that I enjoyed sipping something slowly for the first time in almost three years. 

Other than that the chugging is my reminder that it never went away, I just don't let it consume alcohol anymore and for very good reason.

3/4cup of rice

~1/4 cup red quinoa

Add the water proportional to cooking this amount. Should be about 16oz

I like to add a little olive oil and a squirt of veggie stock base too

Then I dump on a can of rotel (tomatoes and chilies), a can of drained and rinsed beans (I like a three bean blend with dark kidney, pinto, and black beans), and finish it off with a bunch of dark/hot chili powder.

You can add a can of corn, or pretty much anything else. Shredded carrots are good too. 

I'm trying to gain weight over the winter, so I eat this as one whole meal, but it could easily be two meals for a light eater. I have no idea how the rice cooker makes the rice and quinoa perfect together at the same time but it consistently does. 

Basically just measure out the rice:water ratio first and then add anything you want."
