YangForPresidentHQ,ffebvgy,t3_et47ck,1579842503.0,"personally i would hate this, but I know some people would like it. I don't think you could argue that people living apart from their families would be good, though. I wouldn't mind it being an option (*really* optional) in the free market, but I wouldn't want the government to encourage it. 

Certain trades like electrician and carpenter already make a lot of money, i think - one of the main reasons being that there aren't many people trained in those areas. Yang wants to encourage more young adults to go to trade schools instead of college and learn these high paying, useful skills. Physical labor (repairing streets etc) is lower paying than those, i think, not to mention more physically demanding, and less socially acceptable (in terms of educational accomplishment - it's still honest work)."

All those unfortunate stereotypes of black people living off welfare would make Americans less likely to accept UBI. But because asians are associated with high work ethic Yang has more of a chance. Only 14% of Americans are black. Even if every single black person voted for a black Yang he'd have a hard time with everyone else. But really it's impossible to know for sure unless Yang loses this year and a black person runs on UBI next cycle.

Besides, Yang is Taiwanese-American. Anyone really worried about Chinese spies could look that up. Not that everyone is so rational. 🤷🏻‍♀️"
YangForPresidentHQ,ff7ov7c,t1_ff6sy58,1579654748.0,if you get less than 15% in a primary you get zero delegates too. A caucus is better for Yang overall because the most passionate people go and you get a chance to convince others.

YangForPresidentHQ,ff7aiwp,t1_ff67vot,1579644673.0,well i disagree with you there. I'm not sure a different race would perform better with his platform. Being asian makes him seem more trustworthy where UBI is concerned. And it's not really something he can change like his group slogan 😆

Of course, I would expect work weeks to naturally have fewer hours soon because of automation. But the great thing about NOT being a slave is being able to choose what jobs are worth the money. I think it's ridiculous to equate a 40 hour work week to slavery. One thing that does make me mad is forcing mothers to work instead of look after their babies, though. That's comparable.

I do think that prostitution will go way down with the Freedom Dividend. Crime in general too. We'll see.

As for me, I haven't been in such a bad situation yet that I had to do anything unpleasant for money. I quite enjoyed my minimum wage jobs, scary as it was to start them. But I have been very, very lucky. And I did have 8 months where I worked 8 hours a day 7 days a week because I thought it was the only way I could keep 2 jobs, and I needed more than 1 job to get by. It gave me a profound appreciate for Sundays. I was so exhausted and got so sick at the end of it...

And yes, it's ridiculous that some dems will reduce all trump supporters to ""racist ignorants"". Immigration panic /= racism - it's usually caused by a lack of resources - and they had reasons for being afraid of Hillary. It's very shortsighted to ignore that."

DreamInterpretation,fef883r,t3_eoucve,1579050499.0,"the first thing to keep in mind is that dreams are testing grounds. Our brains will throw different scenarios at us so we can test them and decide how to react if they ever happen in real life. Sometimes this is more obvious, like when you dream about being with your friend's boyfriend, and sometimes it's more obscure and made up of little parts, like dreaming about gingerbread men stealing your cereal. The point is, having the dream doesn't make you a bad person; it's what you choose to feel about the dream that matters. You can decide not to want your friend's boyfriend, and every time you start dreaming about being with him, try to get rid of him (r/luciddreaming might help). 

You might be longing for a romantic relationship like your friend has. You could try going on some dates, either through people you know or through dating apps. Are you maybe worried because of all the talk about WW III? Or maybe a big change is coming up in your life that you're nervous about?"

YangForPresidentHQ,feds1hs,t3_eomrhz,1579018662.0,"Yang's UBI is to give every American adult citizen not currently in prison $1000 every month. People currently on welfare can choose whether they want welfare or UBI, and it stacks with other programs like Social Security. The point of UBI is to be a better social security net - a new income ""floor"", a minimum income that everyone has. Many people don't even file for welfare or for negative income tax because they don't know how. It is also better for stay at home parents, unpaid caretakers, and young adults still in training for a career. Best of all, you keep it even if you find a job, so there's no disincentive to work. With the rise of automation, it's possible that there won't be as many jobs as there are people in the near future. UBI is meant to provide for that possibility. (Personally I feel there should also be an amount given for children, but I suppose they're trying to curtail population growth. Maybe in the future there will be.)

It's been advocated by Martin Luther King Jr. too!

Here are some numbers about how Yang's planning to pay for it: https://freedom-dividend.com/net-cost/ for the most part it's through a Value Added Tax, a tax that occurs at each stage of the manufacturing process, I believe. He says he won't add the VAT to food."

You see yourself as married and committed and are taking this response from your husband to mean he doesn't. Think of it this way: why do we have legal acknowledgements? With no-fault divorce, legal acknowledgements are only for child custody purposes and financial purposes. Announcing your marriage to friends and family is good social pressure to encourage committment, which you've already done. There's two possibilities here - your husband may simply not want you to get legal acknowledgment then divorce him for alimony (altho he might be wrong depending on common law marriage law in your state); or he doesn't see you as really married and doesn't want to be. Who knows which it really is?

It sounds like you're having other issues with your husband. You don't feel like he's contributing financially or emotionally. This rejection hurts because it feels like another withdrawal of support from him. You want to feel like you can rely on him and that he cares about you, but you haven't lately. Personally I think he's wrong not to legally acknowledge it, but if that was the only issue with him, it'd be forgivable until you were both more secure in the relationship. If he's seeing it as purely a money thing. 

I would recommend reading Becoming Attached by Robert Karen. Your dynamic is classic Avoidant-Ambivalent - one person wanting more from the other, the other pulling away because they feel used or overwhelmed. This is just one more thing that you're asking him for, he doesn't want to give it because he doesn't trust you won't use it against him, and you feel betrayed by. If you two will have a future together, that cycle needs to be broken, either by him being more giving or by you being less demanding. Of course, the things you're demanding are perfectly reasonable and he's [not nice] for not doing it. But it might be better to focus for a little while on the good in the relationship, give him a chance to feel unattacked and like his own concerns are appreciated, then see if he's more understanding of your needs after his own are satisfied. If not, then at least you know you tried.

not combining finances is fine. if you're concerned that he's not contributing fairly, that's a different problem, and ties into everything else. Good luck with your marriage counselling.

selfhelp,fdwzz4u,t3_en8abt,1578763915.0,"you could try getting a book of conversation starters or looking up some news online briefly before conversations. There's usually something new there to talk about. Although try not to make your conversation mostly about murdered people or anything 😆. Also, focusing on what other people want to talk about - their job, their family, their goals, their politics, books/movies they've seen - helps."

YangForPresidentHQ,fdwgsds,t1_fdtvl2t,1578758510.0,"that's his main thing though. It'd be disingenuous not to mention it. But saying his other policies should help too, i guess."
YangForPresidentHQ,fdwg75d,t1_fdtwqou,1578758336.0,"iowa caucuses are releasing first vote information this year, so we'll know who got initially voted for and who got a final vote. No worries.

he still won't get any delegates in new hampshire if he's under 15%. Honestly, I'm glad we have a caucus first. Right now we're hoping Yang will do better than polling because of repubs, independents, and first time voters. If he was actually getting 9% of the vote he wouldn't have much of a chance, but in a caucus 9% gives him a good shot at getting 15% from convincing others, which will make him an ""actual"" candidate to the rest of the nation, and eliminate all the other less-popular candidates from the field. It's his best chance at being taken seriously. Personally I'd still want him to hang around in the race even if he flops in the early states - you never know what can happen - but if he did well in Iowa he'd actually have a decent chance."
Ask_Politics,fdwewpb,t1_fdvn2xs,1578758012.0,"i looked at your link. I still thinked ranked voting is much better. Ther argument for approval voting seems to be ""if your first candidate gets eliminated, other people's second candidate might be your most hated one!"" which is, yeah. It's still more fair for people to get to decide. It doesn't hurt your second candidate to put your first candidate first because you need over 50% of the vote anyway for it to be a final count."
YangForPresidentHQ,fdtrbov,t1_fdszte5,1578720986.0,"new hampshire doesn't let anyone keep delegates if they're under 15% too, i think. And the caucus gives Yang a much better chance of reaching that 15%."
YangForPresidentHQ,fdteooa,t1_fdszte5,1578715681.0,i do find the exploration of caucuses interesting because i'm new to the idea myself. Do you have links to any articles about it?
Ask_Politics,fdtehng,t1_fdt7r3x,1578715604.0,"i never did see a link. i figured it was a mistake.

Ultimately I'm not hurting my first choice by having a second choice in ranked voting; my vote would only apply to my second choice if my first choice lost. I do agree that a fringe candidate is more likely to win with approval voting than ranked choice voting, but that's more of an accident than anything else, that would only happen when the majority of the population still didn't prefer that candidate, just found them tolerable."

AskAnAmerican,fdt9vu5,t3_emw2w3,1578713821.0,Nothing. Went to private and public school in Virginia. Was never mentioned. The teacher just showed us anatomy pictures of female and male genetalia (that didn't even look like anything - it was in black and and white) and said that girls need to wear pads or tampons on their periods. (Never mentioning the excruciating pain possible either)

Ask_Politics,fdt6abc,t1_fcyesez,1578712473.0,"i prefer ranked choice voting to approval voting. I would want to give my candidate the best advantage and only approve of my top candidate. But with ranked voting, I'm not hurting my top candidate by having a backup."

Note the ""still running?"" first column. Everyone's expecting Trump to be the Repub nominee, so then it would come down to Trump and the Dem nominee. So most people are voting in the Dem primaries right now. Also, the signature issue for Bernie is free college and healthcare, and the signature issue for Yang is Universal Basic Income (everybody gets $1000 a month)."
Ask_Politics,fdt2g9w,t3_emkcul,1578711049.0,"he's the only dem candidate who does not love the idea of universal daycare. I prefer enabling a parent to stay at home with a baby than giving them money for daycare, which is why Biden is my second choice after Yang. We'll see who's still around by the time my state votes."
YangForPresidentHQ,fdsz7yu,t1_fdsrdfi,1578709864.0,"by the way, i think iowa's caucus is a lot more beneficial for yang than a primary would be. Caucuses are great when you have passionate supporters (the people who will actually go there for hours), and they get the chance to convince others to join their side. Yang's clear UBI policy males it easy to sway people. And Iowa lets you change parties at the door, so repubs and independents can caucus for Yang too. If Yang can do well in anything, it'd be a caucus. If he can't get to 15% he'd be dead anyway, and if he can, he's suddenly leagues above the candidates who can't - a ""viable"" candidate"
YangForPresidentHQ,fdsxf7p,t1_fdsrdfi,1578709191.0,well some people will still vote for him. But he would lose his momentum and go downhill. Iowa is extremely important. We need to come in at least 4th.
