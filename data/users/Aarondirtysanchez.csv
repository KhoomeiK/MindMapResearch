I think mascots are actually chosen very carefully and screened beforehand for behaviour as they have to work so much with kids.  I mean people hand their ducking babies to mascots sometimes.

That one benefit alone is worth it to anyone reading this if it’s the only takeaway you experience.

As for the social anxiety part that I also thought drinking helped with, it really doesn’t at all.  At the beginning when I drink I don’t talk much, then have a sweet spot where it works for a bit, then get too intoxicated and can barely even talk anyway.  If you just get through the first awkward 15-20 mins of sober hangouts a miraculous thing happens and you start actually communicating way better, are mentally sharp, and regret absolutely nothing."

You’re on a substance, depressed and anxious, and likely sleep deprived, and all of this is intensified if you get to blackout levels.

I don’t think the withdrawal is actually that hard for many though, what’s hard is actually stopping for good.

Your point about it being egocentric and selfish also has next to no relevance in my life.  It is used for a mix of clinical depression and anxiety (which of course I know it makes 4 times worse) and childhood issues.  I need to work on these things through sober living and mental clarity, and likely more therapy.  I think to a part in alcohol explained About analyzing what exact situations trigger you to start drinking, and once you do that you get a pretty clear picture of exactly why you drink.

Fitness,fc7vnvn,t1_fc7snfq,1577519841.0,Training 6 days a week is entirely needless in general.  You’re better off just resting more and incorporating more into your life anyway.  Don’t you guys have other shit in your life to do besides going to the gym everyday?
