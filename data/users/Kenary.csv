webdev,ff2rxgt,t1_ff2r2zq,1579521473.0,"VueJS, SvelteJS, ReactJS, Angular and other more are Javascript User Interface Framework intended to make Website easier. One of more things it solves is the problem you have. Basically on a JS UI framework, you'll write a piece of code each specifically for Header and Footer which will be used across all pages. That piece of code could be on a single file or a file that houses both header, body, and the footer depending on the framework you use. That ""piece"" of code is generally called a component.

That's jus a gist of the benefits of using a JS framework.

For the frameworks itself, React is the most popular and is made by Facebook, its difficulty to learn is just at medium level. Angular is the hardest of them all but also has a lot of features, it is described as an over-engineered framework.
VueJS is on the easy level and is made by a dedicated independent team of developers backed by several major sponsors.
SvelteJS is the easiest of all and is made by someone at VueJS. It is designed to be picked up immediately by anyone who are new to web dev or JS UI frameworks.

My advice to you is to actually learn VueJS first because it has the best documentation of all and is relatively easy to pick up. Although the SvelteJS is the easiest, its community is not mature enough as VueJS, so if you have questions you may have hard time finding one immediately."

shortcuts,femxjim,t1_femwade,1579272198.0,"because if people want to chat, they probably already have a discord?

If people want to chat, they want to use a dedicated chat app, not a sub-standard chat on a non-chat app. That's why Facebook removed ""Messenger"" from their desktop website because of the same logic. 

If they want to talk, they'll focus on just talking hence the dedicated app.


Not to mention that it's not that easy to implement a realtime chat not also to mention the cost, all of that factor to the number of RoutineHub users wanting to chat with each other, very minimal.
