NarcissisticAbuse,fe6nuxg,t1_fe6jhry,1578897455.0,"I have a therapist but they are not well versed in narcissistic abuse. In fact, it doesn't seem like a lot are. 

Any advice on how to go about finding one? Any resources? etc. Thank you"

raisedbynarcissists,fcgwjmy,t1_fcgsq0g,1577644722.0,"Hey if I could do it, you can do it too! 

I'm just saying I got so obsessed with grades that I neglected my social life, and that really affected me. Sure, I have something to be proud of but now that I ve finished school, making friends is much harder. Holidays and birthdays are quiet...

And I got obsessive to top in college because of my Nparent."
WatchPeopleDieInside,fcgphem,t3_egu7ax,1577642709.0,I had this problem growing up but it was the fact I was the only girl amongst 2 boys. They got the cool shit and I would get something dumb like clothes or dolls. Excuse me for liking video games and dinosaurs as a kid.

raisedbynarcissists,fcaiul9,t3_egs13v,1577570001.0,"Yes, I cannot tell people about my Nparent. I get the ""they re still family"" or they think that they are a good person(because they are charismatic). I get told that my abuse is not so bad and someone else had it worse. 

To make matters much much MUCH worse, my Nparent was convicted as a sex offender. I can not  tell ANYONE this, if I do, I have gotten kicked from friend circles or ghosted. As soon as they find out, it's like I am paying for what my Nparent did."

askatherapist,fc436hj,t1_fc3sf2o,1577405423.0,"I did take it as rejection at first but I also had a flurry of emotions and worry. I'll screenshot your post to talk to her about the questions you mentioned. 

I appreciate the time you took to respond. Thank you. This gave me some peace of mind."
askatherapist,fc3s1mh,t1_fc3qlr7,1577397177.0,"I was told that they had meant to let me know about them moving and they apologized. Maybe they don't intend to discontinue therapy but to only have one option open a week(after offering Saturday, which confused me) may not be viable for me since I possibly have a Mon-Fri job starting in January. 

I did tell them that I felt awful to find out about the change so late. I also mentioned that I am not ready to lose them so suddenly. Seeing them every week, even if it was a tiny improvement, helped me a lot. 

I did not know about referrals, and I will definitely ask about that."
askatherapist,fc3ontk,t1_fc3c7c2,1577394783.0,"I ll do my best to answer your questions, thank you for taking the time to read and respond to my post.

She said she would be visiting the old office for a few clients. She offered Wednesdays and Saturdays to make appointments. I was ok with the idea of Saturdays and when we went to make an appointment she suddenly took it back and said that she only had Wednesdays. 

I don't know how long she plans to see me on Wednesdays. I do know I can't see her at her new location because my insurance won't cover that location. 

I have always seen her once a week for about two years now. 

I mentioned my childhood history because that is the reason I see her in the first place. I am trying to work on myself and part of that would be getting help. This is the opposite of getting help, being told after the fact that she moved her office. I literally walked into her office for a scheduled appointment  and all her stuff was gone and there was only two chairs, in an empty room. That's when I was told by them that they moved and they apologized for not telling me. If I was atleast told ahead of time, I could have planned. 

I didn't know you could ask for referrals. Do you use referrals to get another therapist.? Like is it an outline of your history with the previous therapist?"
