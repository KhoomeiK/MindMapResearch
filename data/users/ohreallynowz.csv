SiberianCats,fghrn1i,t1_fghf1xm,1580791925.0,"No. FIP is caused by a coronavirus and it is very prevalent in most multi-cat household, especially catteries. There is no way to pre-test because all kittens don’t develop FIP. Roughly 30% of all household cats and 90% of all cats in catteries have the coronavirus. Only 10-15% of those cats will mutant the virus into FIP. It’s a guessing game and I didn’t know that before getting a kitten. My breeder did kitten shots and genetic testing FYI."
cats,fgg1u0x,t1_fgfz9j3,1580752406.0,Very close! He is a Siberian Forest cat. Maine coons and Siberians look very similar. Thank you for the well wishes.
cats,fgflz1j,t1_fgfdyhy,1580742270.0,"Thank you, it means a lot. He is my world and I tried to give him the best, most exciting life he could have."
cats,fgffnye,t1_fgfe1cd,1580737366.0,Thank you so much.
cats,fgffibr,t1_fgfd1z9,1580737233.0,"Ugh, I hear you. I have to get at least a second opinion though. If there is any chance it might not be FIP, I have to be sure."
cats,fgfb8lt,t1_fgf728v,1580733143.0,"I gave him his second dose of antibiotics but no response yet. He still isn’t eating on his own so I’ve been hand feeding him a mixture of gravy, broth and wet food with a baby syringe every couple hours. He’ll lick it from the syringe slowly. As far as how I am, I’m still a sad blubbering mess, but the outpouring from the community is really nice. I don’t have a lot of friends, and my family isn’t big on animals so they don’t really understand that it’s a big deal. But he’s really my best friend so it is nice to have people be so kind about it."
cats,fgfavys,t1_fgf5s1r,1580732776.0,"Yes, going to another vet today for certain."
cats,fgfaupf,t1_fgf4kzc,1580732741.0,"Thank you so much. I’m going for a second option at another vet today. I just have to be sure before I do anything rash. He’s my first cat so I never knew this disease existed and if what he has is FIP, I just can’t imagine ever getting another cat...You bond with them just to lose them so quickly and there is no way to know beforehand."
cats,fgewyhg,t3_ey0z99,1580713269.0,"Update: I am looking into the FIP treatments you guys mentioned, thank you so much for all your kind words. Unfortunately right now it’s looking like the option might be financially out of reach. My little buddy is fighting so hard; it hurts to think there is something out there that could possibly save him and I don’t have access to it. But I am at least reaching out to the FIP Warriors Facebook and seeing what they can do.

Edit: I created a fundraiser, if anyone would like to help. Honestly, I just couldn't forgive myself if I didn't try. https://www.gofundme.com/f/sxsb2-lifesaving-treatment-for-my-8-month-old-kitten"
cats,fgeoral,t1_fgengg7,1580705068.0,"Currently, he's trying antibiotic now. It's day 1. He does have a fever, weight loss and extreme lethargy. Mostly I'm just trying to get him to eat. He won't eat anything at all and he needs to get his strength. 

Trust me, if there is ANYTHING I can do, I will do it."
cats,fgelw4j,t1_fgelh8m,1580702786.0,"I really don’t think I can handle that. And, I’d hate for him to suffer alone while I wasn’t home. I’m wrestling with the thought of putting him down; it’s just so upsetting."

vegan,fg43sb7,t1_fg42nhw,1580495553.0,"This was nice to hear. I realize there will be things that I think are nonvegan (like killing spiders in your home, agreed) and things that I don’t. I hadn’t considered it to be a spectrum but it certainly is, when you look at it from that perspective. I’m definitely doing the best I can to ensure as little harm as possible."
vegan,fg43fi0,t1_fg41on5,1580495342.0,"Thank you, that’s exactly how I feel. I’ll always do the best for my pets but it’s such a crummy situation, especially after not having bought meat for so long."
