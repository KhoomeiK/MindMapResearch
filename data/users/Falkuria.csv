listentothis,feavus3,t1_feanekj,1578952700.0,"Making music with an instrument you barely know how to play is also talent. That being said, all four of them are more than proficient at their instruments. As a drummer and guitarist, I'm in love with the constant motion from the drummers playstyle. Extremely precise fills, not overplaying, and staying in the pocket of her preferred drum style for the band. The guitarist is doing things that would take most people more than a couple years of daily play to learn how to do it properly every time while playing live music or even harder, making a recording.

Now, as far as not being talented because YOU personally (for some reason) think they aren't, is just flawed logic. Writing music that sounds good, and isn't easy to complain about is a whole lot harder than you think. Surely you've tried being in a band with original music (I've been in 3 by age 28 and multiple projects with multiple instruments played by me) so SURELY you would think first before opening your mouth about how this is talent.

A couple final thoughts:

Here is a very interesting band that used to be popular among instrumental lovers. Nothing is highly technical in this song, but it's still really good and shows high understanding of how to write music with no lyrics to help progress the song.  [Impulse - An Endless Sporadic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSKyN3lG2bE).

Finally, here is a band that was formed by each member selecting an instrument, and learning how to play them as they wrote music. Even their first album, you can hear the stiffness in the drummer and the predictable scales from the guitarists. I remind you, none of them knew what they were doing.  This song is from their second album. [Back Burner - August Burns Red](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHOTzQF_Z-g&list=PLCslpjrb7cYhKjLAUOJA6xqBFYY1yyFjV&index=3)

In conclusion, if you're a musician, which I assume you are since you seem to use a couple proper terms here and there; you shouldn't bash this band because YOU personally think they are unskilled. Honestly, I think your self appointed ""current old-man state"" is causing you bash their talent because you're washed up and salty that 4 girls in cute outfits are straight up rocking it. Get off your pedestal, dude. Go play some music and have a good heckin' day."
