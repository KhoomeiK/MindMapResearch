leaves,fef6kwn,t3_eoq1o6,1579049387.0,"Man, this hit close to home.. 31F and I lost my dad in 2011 and started smoking everyday after that. I got better around the beginning of 2015 and smoked maybe 2-5 times a week but my sister died in mid 2015 out of the blue and I didn't know how to cope (losing a sibling is harder than losing a parent because we kind of expect them to die in our lifetime whereas I was expecting to grow old with my siblings). I saw a therapist back in August (it was a little helpful but she just couldn't remember basic things I had told her numerous times and making sure I paid was of more import than my mental health to them and in the end didn't give me any tools to help cope). But at the very least it made me aware that I haven't actually addressed the grief of their deaths, just used weed to mask the painful feelings thinking of them brought up. I've been slowly decreasing my usage over the past year (I went through an eighth a day at my peak) which has helped but I can't seem to get rid of it entirely... it doesn't feel safe. People like you inspire me that there is hope for people like me. Thank you for sharing your story and congratulations girl - you're awesome! :)"

NEET,fdxna4t,t3_en8mex,1578770900.0,"Hey man, you don't have to go. If you're not getting anything positive out of it, don't subject yourself to that. I was a loser/outcast in HS and when I got the 10 year invite, I just laughed. I still have communication with the two people who turned out to actually be decent people after HS. I personally don't care about seeing all of those other people from my past because it doesn't bring me anything positive or useful in my life right now. If you are on good terms with your old classmate (meaning you actually talk to them 1 on 1 not just like their IG posts), I'd say consider going so you can enjoy time reminiscing with them. If they're no more than an acquaintance, I'd say reconsider going. You can always do something fun and enjoyable with the friends you do like on the day of the reunion.. that's what I did and have no regrets."

FFXV,fdxhcld,t3_en7hdc,1578768732.0,I believe it got patched. I tried something similar (on console) a few months ago and was not able to complete it with Aranea despite seeing a video showing it was possible (it was an older video though). Most websites I looked for seemed to have the same conclusion. I'd love to be proven wrong on this though.

leaves,fdrohsx,t3_emu1z6,1578687350.0,"My parents were huge stoners back in the day when I was growing up. I still buy for my mom (my dad died in 2011). I've been on the fence recently about eliminating it from my life since I started smoking daily after my dad passed away. I've been to therapy, on meds, etc. To treat my depression - always advocating for 420 when I never stopped to think how it could be negatively effecting me (when you're always high, you dont know how not being high all the time feels). 

Stay strong dude - 3 days is terrific! I'm obviously not in a position to give you advice since you've made the leap and I haven't. You're hella smart for realizing it at 22 instead of 31. Better late than never!"
weed,fdohqfo,t3_emc7vi,1578605383.0,"My dad took his life 8 years ago after testing positive for THC during a random drug test at his work. The huge company (in California, mind you) that he worked for didn't have the balls to fire him since his medical doctor approved him for THC usage. They left him in limbo for weeks with no pay check and unable to get unemployment. So he took his own life.

Almost everytime I see something positive or new happen in the cannabis industry, I always say ""I wish dad was alive to see this.""


It sucks that our dads lived in a time where marijuana was so frowned upon. I hope the kids today realize how lucky they are to have the freedoms they do. I'll light up a fatty for both our dads  üå¨üëåüèª  cheers dude"

DecidingToBeBetter,fcyxy26,t3_ejj9lk,1578089533.0,"Work slowly on getting yourself in a better place. 
Keep a journal to write your thoughts down (it sometimes gets them out of your head for a while). Try to eat some light food everyday- yogurt, crackers, toast, some fruit or veggies (I eat them raw cause hey - its food!). DONT FORGET TO EAT. IT WILL MAKE YOUR DEPRESSION WORSE. Also aim for some physical activity - even if you can't leave the house... do some wall squats, lift a bottle of water like weights, or do some light yoga in bed in the morning. Keep active with online support (especially if you lack support from people around you irl) - you can continue to learn coping mechanisms from others out there who are going through similar situations. You can do it! Just try a little bit of self care each day and you'll start to notice a difference.


FWIW,
My dad committed suicide 8 years ago (he left his body for me to find) and he left me with debt, so much doubt, and comepletey defeated. Not many people understand the kind of struggle (4 years if I'm being honest) of hard work and dedication that it took to get me out of that haze I was in. I'm still not perfect (my sister died randomly about 6 months after that 4 year mark in 2015 which significantly set me back) and the depression never goes away but even through that I refuse to be defeated and continue to keep my head up. I know you may not see it now... especially from some random person online... but know that you are alive for a reason. You may change someone's life that you haven't even met yet. You have so much courage for reaching out like this. Please never give up - you ARE amazing!"
