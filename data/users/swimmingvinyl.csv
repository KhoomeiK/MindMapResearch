MacMiller,feuws2d,t3_eq57db,1579390726.0,"it’s such a mature and sincere project. i feel like all of mac’s works have been authentic but circles feels like finding truth and comfort in a place of hopelessness, coming to terms with one’s own mortality and fragility. i just felt like he was saying he knew himself better than anyone else did and he knew he was gonna be alright, even if his version of alright didn’t match everyone else’s expectations and desires for him. like he was the only one who could save him and like he wasn’t asking that anyone did, just looking to say what he had to say while he could say it. i wanna say that yeah, it’s impacted me a lot, specially as a mentally ill person but i think the most important thing about it is it’s his heart and soul all over. that’s really what makes this album unique. 
also my favorite tracks are probably i can see, woods and hand me downs. 🖤"
depression,feej76s,t1_feeigfc,1579034838.0,"of course! it’s always, always easier said than done. i can’t push you through it and i can’t drill that into your head same way i can’t drill it into mine when i’m at my lowest. but what we can do is remind ourselves over and over while we survive each day and each day, we get further away from the bottom and closer to the top, where things are clearer. it’s no easy task but the fact that you’ve done it before and you’re here right now shows you not only that you can get through this but you have. you’re not below it, you’re not smaller or weaker than those feelings right now. the first times tend to be the hardest to make it out of, so when we do, it means we’re strong enough to. i know you are. it’s okay to feel it, it’s okay to hurt, long as you don’t lose sight of yourself in the process. you’re not alone! and how we feel doesn’t reflect reality. feeling like you can’t make it doesn’t make it true."
CasualConversation,feedfe5,t1_feed879,1579031467.0,definitely recommend it (not to watch with kids for sure tho!) when you’ve got some time! it’s out on online platforms already aswell :-)
CasualConversation,feecsf5,t1_feebw5a,1579031094.0,"absolutely! but i believe the starting point for these realizations to come together is developing self awareness. most people don’t know themselves nor where their actions/reactions come from and nowadays especially it’s so much easier to react instantly to everything and never take a moment to question the why’s and how’s, which is how we’re lost to propaganda. it’s like everyone’s just projecting all the time in the most unhealthy ways and they have no idea, either due to straight up ignorance or the inability to come to terms with the fact that one just isn’t above being terrible. it’s the self awareness that stops us from perpetuating those terrible things, otherwise it’s screaming for the sake of screaming and complaining for the sake of complaining. anything that has to do with looking in the mirror is a sensitive subject to people because looking in the mirror just isn’t fun a lot of the time. isn’t it easier to convince yourself you’re not to blame and you’re on the right side because there’s no way i’m this bad if i didn’t hang up a confederate flag in my room or beat a woman up, right? 
a film that i think illustrates the importance of this conversation and a film i’m grateful
for is actually joker. what a take on human hypocrisy and complacency."
CasualConversation,feebc82,t3_eopvwm,1579030248.0,"i think bottom line is we all contribute to an unequal society no matter what. conversations like this are important because they push (or should push) us to question our role in it all and how we can make changes for the better. people just don’t like being at the receiving end of criticism so they find comfort in simplifying it down to “the bad people” vs “the good people” and refusing to admit or accept that they’re just as responsible for what’s shitty in the world as anyone else. it’s not a death sentence, just a way to say maybe we should rethink what we do, say and how we treat each other. think it’s a great topic to bring up for sure! just a lil sensitive"
depression,feeagna,t3_eopwfv,1579029734.0,"down the road, if not sooner you’ll realize this person is better off away from you and there’s nothing they can offer. comments like that don’t say anything about you but it’s very telling of the kind of person he is and honestly, we’ve all been there. eventually that pain and shock is gonna subside and you’ll forget what you even found appealing in him. never ever let another person be the reason for you to take your own life. no one is worth that no matter what role they play in your life. your feelings are valid and real and you’re human so it’s natural that’ll hurt to hear but i promise man, cases like this are a matter of time. don’t give him that satisfaction and don’t give him power over you. cut his ass off and go about your life."
SuicideWatch,fdoyuzb,t1_fdoxyi8,1578616017.0,"How long have you been taking those? If it’s been enough time that by now you should be feeling the effects, I’d definitely tell your doctor! Being honest is a big part of it but I do understand that flat out saying you’re suicidal can be tricky and we don’t always know how it’ll be taken. But saying that your mental health as a whole has gotten worse as opposed to better and that you’re at a loss and don’t know what else to do can give your doctor an idea of what you need right now. I wish I could do more for you. It’s not fucking fair that anybody would be stopped from getting help but I know and I believe you can get through this and come out the other end. I’m in a low place myself and I’m here. I just hope this pain can spark a desire to overcome rather than give in. Saying “I refuse to let this defeat me”. Healthy coping mechanisms can be game changers, you could make a list of things that give you pleasure and aren’t harmful and make it a point to do them everyday. Art, I find, is an incredible outlet. You can paint, you can sing or write, pour all the heavy and negative feelings in there instead of trying to avoid feeling them. Spend time with animals (I find it helps me a lot just being around cats so I help out around shelters), try to spend a bit more time outdoors. There’s always little things. But definitely a talk with your doctor first!"
SuicideWatch,fdoxgrx,t3_emifk2,1578615106.0,"Everything I’m about to say is predictable but firstly, you’re not alone and you won’t be. Asking for help is a big deal on its own because not only is it hard to, it also means there’s something inside of you that doesn’t really wanna die. You’ve gotta listen to that part of you and ask it why it wants to stick around and you’ve got to ask yourself why another part of you doesn’t. Secondly, seeking help is a process with a lot of steps, I’d look into finding a psychiatrist and therapist that works for you (might take a minute but it’s worth it). They’re likely to prescribe you something, you’ll determine whether it’s done more good or bad, etc. Again, it’s a process. But it’s doable and the most difficult thing, especially when we’re already suicidal, is saying you want and need help. You’ve done that so you’re halfway there. I’m rooting for you from here and I genuinely hope things look up. You deserve better than to feel that way."
depression,fca9dai,t3_egvp0y,1577565096.0,"it’s not uncommon to say something in the heat of the moment with the purpose to hurt the other person. it’s not okay but it happens a lot and how we react to things and people is telling of what we’re like, not the other way around. you have a little one that loves you and that’ll be true regardless of whether you’re in a relationship with the mother or not. relationships end, people change, having an entire life shared with someone else is hard but it’s not the only thing you’ve got and your life doesn’t revolve around it. everything you’re feeling is valid and it’s okay to take your time to feel how you’re feeling. if anything i’d recommend being with your baby as much as you can and when things are a little less chaotic, there’s always space and possibility for healthy communication. it sounds like all words, i’m not in your shoes but you aren’t alone by any means. genuinely hope you get to see things start to look up. sometimes that only happens after we hit a low."
