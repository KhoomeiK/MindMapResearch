AmItheAsshole,ffddcj6,t3_eswgm7,1579818497.0,"NAH - It seems like you have good intentions and just went to help your boyfriend. Don't expect your boyfriend to just start spending more money without giving him a good feeling about it though. But once you start increasing you lifestyle expenses, it is really hard to go back on that decision.

I'd suggest to make a budget and decide on a joint goal regarding finances. Meaning, how much money do you need for monthly charges and living. And for the rest, how much do you want to save every month (i.e. 50%, 80%, the rest is for extras/luxury). This way, you will always know how much you already saved per month and spending the rest should feel less of a waste for your boyfriend. 

For saving, get a safety cash reserve of 2-3 months of living and invest the rest in long term funds, ETFs are good for that. You can expect a monthly growth of about 5-8% a year with a solid investment strategy, which means that a million dollar invested will make you about 50k-80k a year. Saving as much money as early as possible helps you get there faster, because their worth grows exponentially."
explainlikeimfive,ffajfoi,t3_esbsyp,1579737226.0,"Sometimes, restarting the game is easier to load the new settings. For every change, a part of the game needs to be changed or restarted. For bigger changes in the settings (and with this in the game), restarting will likely take less time. In newer games, the graphics part of the game is usually restarted without needing a manual reboot for convenience"
GetMotivated,feypnfa,t3_eqvo6v,1579448837.0,"Sleep is important. If you don't sleep after learning, your brain will not save the learned information. Delaying decisions until the effect becomes meaningful means that you have as much information to decide as possible. Mild procrastination leads to higher quality of work in the same time frame. If you don't prepare properly, you most likely will redo some of the work. Those tips will most likely lead to a lot of stress down the line if you follow them for everything."

PathOfExileBuilds,fcxnr4e,t3_ejeifb,1578067305.0,Arc Miner and Skellies are pretty good. They both can potentially clear the phases in less than ten seconds. Skellies is probably more tanky with the same budget
AmItheAsshole,fcowh9j,t3_ei9igg,1577843471.0,"I'm going with YTA. It sounds like your son has deep running problems interacting with others or his anger management or maybe even a gaming addiction if he takes it that serious. On top of that, you ridicule him, and for an extended amount of time, about a thing he currently is in therapy for. This usually leads to trust issues. He can't control his thoughts in anger and you painted a target on your back. This situation will prpbably make his anger problem worse, but definitely not better"
PathOfExileBuilds,fccc4bq,t3_egybro,1577596712.0,"I am enjoying the zombie build this season. After I put in about 20ex, I became nearly immortal with still a lot of room for growth. My zombies only die on the poison conqueror and Sirus fight (and phys reflect). I can face tank 90% of the Metamorphs in T16.

There are also a lot of variations you can play, like having a 5L Zombie and 5L Skellies in the same weapon.

The first build was the first to kill Awakener on level 8 in SSF HC though, if I remember correctly. I don't think that summoning skeletons is more engaging than zombies, but it is more versatile in which map mods it can run."
