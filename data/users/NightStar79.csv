They never encountered it before so their body doesn't have a clue what to do about it. Which is the whole point of vaccines. Introduce a tiny bit into their system and their body develops an immunity to it.

But being hit by the full weight can cause massive problems.

So illegal immigrants who don't get any sort of health check coming over here encountering unvaccinated people causes endemics.

I'm not talking about just measles too. Polio was pretty much eradicated in the US but now it's starting to rearing it's ugly head again.

It's a reasonably logical comparison to make since some of the vaccines are meant to protect against rare to non-existent in the US diseases so they sounded redundant. Illegal immigrant carriers encountering anti-vaxxers would be the logical conclusion to why the diseases are popping up more than once in a blue moon.

Illegal immigrants.

Before anyone goes ""OH GAWD FUCK YOUR CLOSE MINDEDNESS!"" I would like to remind you that everyone coming across the border *legally* undergoes ***mandatory*** health checks.

Meaning diseases that were eradicated in the US but are suddenly popping up again isn't 100% anti-vaxxers faults.

Illegal immigrants who hop the border and meld with society without getting checked ***bring diseases over with them.***


It's like what happened to the Native Americans when Europeans first set foot here centuries ago. While the Europeans were immune to certain diseases and sicknesses, or their bodies at least had adapted so it wasn't fatal, the Native Americans weren't.

So many Native Americans died because their immune system never encountered what the Europeans carried before.

Which is the same now. Anti-vaxxers refused to get vaccinated and were perfectly fine because those illnesses didn't exist here anymore but now they're suddenly catching them again and everyone is like ""OMG IT'S ANTIVAXXERS FAULTS!"" when no, it isn't their fault that diseases that literally did not exist in the US suddenly reappeared."

As in...people ***in the government*** (or at least the ones in the pocket of rich fuckers who wanted war since selling weapons and vehicles like tanks makes them even more money) betrayed him. It has nothing fucking to do with me and I have no clue how you came to that delusional conclusion.

Call me a conspiracy theorist if you will but the circumstances of his death were way too coordinated for just a few people with guns could pull off. Plus it's not exactly inconspicuous that soon after Kennedy died the declaration of war was signed.

 And if your German why the fuck do you give a shit about what happens in the US? Oh and good for you, you googled for 5 seconds and assumed that's where I made my conclusion from...when it isn't.

***JEWS*** were unable to carry weapons of any sort. And guess when that was enforced? Right after Kristallnacht. Y'know, when people rioted and massacred a ton of Jews in one night...while authorities did nothing to stop it. If they had any sort of access to weaponry they would've had a goddamn chance instead of waiting to be slaughtered like pigs.

Oh and my great grandmother survived the holocaust so fuck your ""Scuse me I'm German"" argument.

 Because again, it was to keep the government in check. And guns are more of an insurance policy since if power hungry government officials get any ideas they'd have to literally fight to enforce any of their bullshit instead of us having to roll over and take it.

Plus what really pisses us off is the people demanding we give up our guns don't know jack shit about guns. I forget who it was but one particularly bright moron tried to demand they ban magazines and clips because she thought they were a one use toss type of thing.

I also remember someone talked about banning ""fully semi-automatic"" guns. Just...what?

And *they* are the ones we should hand our guns over to when they don't have a fucking clue what they're talking about?

 The weapons you keep bringing up weapon are ones that most people are willing to ban! Even the pro-gun people. Of course to ***legally*** own any class 3 weapon you have to jump through hoops so again, the vast majority of people who get their hands on them either stole them, ""borrowed"" them, or paid for them in a black market of some sort

And do you not understand what the definition of stealing is? Do you ***really*** think everyone carries around all their weapons everywhere they go? Yes, I'm TOTALLY going to bring hunting rifle and shotgun as well as all ammunition I own when I go grocery shopping.

You leave your house there's a chance it'll be robbed. Even if you have a gun locker people can break into it and clean it out. Which can be said about gun stores too.

 Even if I'm right? I ***AM*** right. I had to go through those checks *myself* to carry a gun at all. Which, by the way, it's even worse for legally owning a class 3 weapon and costs a lot more money. That's not even counting the cost of the weapons themselves.

A small .22 pistol can cost around $300 not including ammo so the argument of easy access is mind boggling to me.

They're trying to take all the ***legal*** guns away but they can't do jack shit about the illegal guns.

The whole situation is akin to ***everyone*** being punished because of some crazies and fucking idiots. 

 I live in the sticks where almost everyone out here has a gun. So no, I'm not scared. I can't really say how scared I would be if I had to use my gun on another person but sitting here not in that situation...no. I'm not.

Why?

Because the ***only*** reason I'd pull my gun on a person is if it was for self-defense or defending others. This was also drilled into my head: Do *not* pull out your gun if you have no intention of firing. 

And again I live in the country. Where we don't have violent gangs and drug houses at every corner. So again, I'm not scared for anyone. Besides, being constantly paranoid is stupid. Unless you were dumb enough to move to or close to an area with high crime there's no need to be constantly checking over your shoulder.

Besides unless you ignore your base instincts you can usually pick out the suspicious people. Meaning as soon as you notice then get away as soon as possible. The common criminal is pretty easy to pick out since they tend to look and act different.

The same can be said in your scenario. I'm a heavy sleeper...unless something feels off. Not sure how to explain it other than I'm still aware of my surroundings when asleep. So three armed people breaking into my house would be a huge wake up call.

Plus I have a dog and with the way my house is I'd have plenty of cover and an escape route. So I'd have a warning long before they got anywhere near me. Not to mention the majority of burglars around here are punk ass teens so the odds would be in my favor from the get go.

 I am touchy on this subject so it will bound to get heated. Mostly because I *know* that their damn graphs and statistics as well as their logic does ***not*** include people living in the sticks who actually have a need for guns. They also exclude self-defense against animals since *obviously* self-against people is the only factor that matters...even though if they actually *did* include animals in their statistics the graphs would look different.

Not to mention the fact that pretty much everything and anything can be used as a weapon. Cars injure and kill people every day and you don't see people rioting to ban those.

Oh and the ""girly guns"" you speak of sounds like water guns. It's just a stupid harmless toy, nothing horrifying about it. Hell it's safer than a Nerf Gun which shoots squishy foam bullets. 

To be honest I kind of want to lea e this here. Not because I'm not sure I can debate you, it's ***because*** I can that I want to stop. We're starting to send essays to each other."

Anyway.

 Automatic weapons are being weeded out as are bump stocks which can essentially turn a weapon into an automatic so that point of yours is moot.

And shotguns are *also* used for hunting. It's pretty difficult hitting animals like birds with a rifle. Plus they're also useful in self defense against wildlife since you're guaranteed a hit if they get too close.

 The point I tried to make is the right to bear arms is there to keep the government in check. Go look through history, a lot of major fucked up dark stains exist in the past of humanity as a whole *because* guns were taken away.

And no, I'm not exaggerating. Go look up the Nazi Gun Control Regiment. I don't care what people try to say about it not mattering because that's complete bullshit. Entire cities could've banded together to create militias to fight back before things grew so out of control multiple countries had to get involved. 

 And of course the constitution can be amended. I'm not that stupid but that's it. *Amended* not take an eraser to one of the core foundations to the United States. 

 Again, they've been trying to weed out automatic weapons so repeating yourself doesn't make sense.

 The majority of those people were dumbass kids or people who stole the weapons in one form or other. Background checks take at least a week before you can legally purchase a gun from a store. That's not even counting the need to go get a license to carry in the first place. So you are essentially ran through the database every single time you buy a gun.

The *only* exception, which they're trying to figure out, is gun shows. Purchasing from a private dealer is where things get dicey. So yes, they need to figure that one out.

I bet you anything that the vast majority of those loons who bought their guns exploited that loophole...but of course the media or government doesn't care about specifics. They *love* taking things out of context to make a story more juicy (I was briefly a journalism major in college so don't even try to argue that with me) and the government wants them flat out *gone* so of course they don't give a shit.

 And of course I'm not afraid. Other than the fact I don't go anywhere without *my* gun (with the exception of buildings that I could get arrested for carrying any weapon into) I'm not scared of them unless they're pointed at me.

Literally one of the first things I learned was that a gun is just an object. I shouldn't be afraid of it since unless I'm a goddamn moron or one is being pointed at me, I'm not going to get hurt. I was also taught that it's not a toy.

I've known how to use a gun since I was in my single digits because my dad taught me. I am personally not concerned or afraid of them and I know better than to treat carrying one lightly. 

Of course that's not to say I'm not angry that irresponsible, murdererous fuckheads keep getting their hands on them but I ***REFUSE*** to let them take guns away. Like I said before, I need the damn thing if I want to keep working outdoors. If you take my stalker out of the equation there are still rabid wildlife, snakes, and bigger dangerous ones like coyotes, mountain lion, and bears!

I don't even have to actually shoot them since the bang alone is sometimes enough to scare them off. If it isn't then I'd like to have a fighting chance as opposed to accepting my fate. 

So once again, ***fuck that.***"
therewasanattempt,fejmdnr,t1_fejlhxx,1579179768.0,"...you've never held a gun in your life let alone owned one have you?

Besides what they've been trying to do is against the constitution. The whole reason our rights to bear arms is there in the first place is so we could fight back if the government got a little too power hungry.

So ***of course*** people are going to be pissed and fight tooth and nail to keep the government from taking them away.

Besides *no one* who demands guns be taken away thinks about the people living in the sticks. Y'know, the ones who use guns to ***protect themselves*** from wildlife and to hunt for food.

Excuse me but I work outdoors in the pitch black and I've bumped into all kinds of wildlife...including rabid ones. Not to mention I have a stalker the cops can't do anything about because he has never approached me, he just ***constantly*** watches me at a distance. He's three times my weight and looks like he has a few feet on me so if he snuck up on me I wouldn't have a chance.

She never actually hurt me outside of my hand and arm turning bright red from her nails and playful gnawing and would ***always*** stop to check on me if I so much as said ""Ow""

Last stray dog my family took in scared the shit out of us and we thought she would bite strangers. It took us a few weeks before we learned she was only bite if you ***really*** pissed her off.

So of course we took advantage of that. I in particular would push my luck in an attempt to get her to trust us more. Like she would immediately start growling if you wrapped your arms around her so I'd sometimes stand over her and hang my arms in front of her. She'd start snarling but I never actually touched her and kept telling her she could move. I'd always back off when she did start sounding serious so I definitely knew her.

She eventually *did* start pushing past my arms whenever I did it and grew more comfortable with us.

Bad idea I know *but* we were lenient with our dogs and she had obviously been abused before. I was just trying to get her to trust me more by letting her figure out when I was just playing and that she *could* leave if she didn't like what I was doing, I wouldn't stop her.

It worked in the end. She'd still grumble if I gave her a hug or a kiss but I would do it so fast and laugh that we think she only growled because she thought it's what we wanted. She had no issue with one arm wrapped around her or even both as long as they weren't confining and were just for petting her with both hands.

I mean, I can pretty much maul my dog and she gets grumpy when I stop. I can also kiss her when she's eating and she has no reaction aside from glancing at me.

This girl...I wonder if she's annoyed this dog in the past. Or just has no observation skills since there's no way that dog just straight up bit her without her ignoring a warning growl."

Frozen,fei5691,t3_eoyppi,1579130521.0," The dark green dress Anna wears is Arendelle's royal colors.

 Elsa dying probably was the original ending but because it's Disney and not DreamWorks, they don't want to risk making the kiddies sad.

 Elsa freezing does make sense if you think about it. Just because she's a spirit whose powers are connected to Ahtohallan's doesn't mean she's exempt from the curse too. From my knowledge of curses, they don't really make exceptions.

The warning was clear and Elsa didn't listen.

 I mean...it was kind of obvious that she was the 5th spirit. During 'Show Yourself' she takes the spot symbolizing the 5th spirit and Elsa isn't stupid so putting two and two together is easy enough.

 Skipping the Earth Giants made sense since logically how tf could Elsa subdue massive mountains made of stone? Bruni, Gale, and the Nokk were small enough that her powers were able to counter and calm them but Ice vs Multile Angry Earth Giants? Yeah...

Besides they were most likely planned from the start to smash the dam so it was simple enough.

Though if you meant they were smiled entirely...well the spirits weren't happy because of the dam screwing up the balance so logically getting rid of it would calm all of them down regardless of actual interactions."
