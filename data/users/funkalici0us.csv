Games,ffdde05,t1_ffd8u6a,1579818522.0,"This is exactly why I spent the last year completely pulling out of the Apple regime. Last thing to go was the goddamn iPhone.

Apple is no longer interested in users. Over the last several years, they have made it increasingly more difficult to use whatever software that you want to use and it's completely ridiculous. They are hellbent on keeping everyone locked inside their little box and while that may (I guess) be feasible for devices like iPhone and iPad, it's a piss poor thing to do on the Mac. Wouldn't surprise me at all if in a few years macOS will only be able to run software downloaded from the App Store and people will have to result to jailbreaking their COMPUTERS in order to run whatever software they want to run. There's no way in hell you could get me to purchase an Apple product at this point, especially not a Mac. I'm very glad that with Nadella at the helm, Microsoft has turned Windows 10 into a powerhouse that is a joy to use because otherwise I don't know what I would do."
LinusTechTips,ffcab1o,t3_espf9u,1579795109.0,"Huge amount of respect for Linus not drinking the celebrity Kool-Aid and recognizing his priorities. I've watched Linus for a long time and over that time I've built a family of my own, so in a way, I feel that I've grown as LTT has grown and I empathize with his feelings about the importance of his family. LTT has been and is one my favorite sources of entertainment and it's hard to not feel a weird personal level of emotion when you feel like you've known someone for a long time, so this really hit me hard. 

Regardless of what Linus ultimately decides to do, I will still watch (almost lol) every video. LTT has done a fantastic job of creating a brand and standing out from the rest thanks to a talented cast of people both now and in the past. James, Riley, Alex, etc. are all very much on brand and carry the videos just fine. No worries that I will remain a viewer for many years to come if Linus decides to take a few steps back to focus on his life outside of LMG."

They're mostly fine. I don't get into it, but it's all about teens and what's coming out now is what teens are into. I have no delusions that albums are being created for me lol"

ToolBand,fe6ocp6,t1_fe6k4nz,1578898020.0,"Hey, I mean, I'm not in the business of trashing the dreams of young artists just because I don't personally care for their music. For me, yeah, it stings a bit that Tool isn't #1 because, again, for *me* Tool is on a whole other planet from the other top 3 musical acts. I might even use #bummer to describe the situation. Truth is, Taylor Swift sucks hard and her entire career was made into a punchline by John Mayer. Billie Eilish on the other hand is difficult to dismiss because she resonates with teens today the same way that our bands resonated with us back when. Does that automatically mean she's creatively on the same level as our bands? No. Not necessarily. I've tried to listen to her album and while it doesn't do anything for me, I respect the fact that she writes her own music and is influencing teenagers to be different. But yeah, fuck Taylor Swift. Tool should've been number 1.

God I'm really starting to feel old."

Especially these guys. They deserve nothing but fanfare because Fear Inoculum has put creative music back on the map. Truth is, if anyone was going to come back and ""save"" rock and roll, it was gonna be Tool."

OldSchoolCool,fc4koh6,t1_fc1gx10,1577419485.0,"It is our turn and it's been our turn ever since John F. Kennedy was sworn into office on 1/20/61. Like I said, he differs quite a bit from what we would consider leftist nowadays, but he was the beginning of us and he was as us as he could get during his time period. Without President Kennedy, there might not be an us. Certainly, those who held office after him did not uphold the principles and the forward thought of the Kennedy office, but it still hangs in the hearts of some Americans every election when we try to put our faith behind someone who presented us with as much promise as John Kennedy did. There are those out there that negate his presidency as ineffective due to his untimely death or because of his own personal matters, but I firmly believe that Kennedy was one of the highest peaks as far as the United States government as concerned."
