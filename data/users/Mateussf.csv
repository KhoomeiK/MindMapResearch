wikipedia,fdhns1c,t1_fdgizmw,1578426552.0,"Scientists read Wikipedia. The words that appear in Wikipedia are used by scientists in their papers. Since they read Wikipedia, it's possible they'll believe what is being said, and it's possible they might not be too vigilant in spotting mistakes, and they might believe those mistakes. That's why its important that Wikipedia has correct information.

>wouldn't anyone who wanted to use it be likely to stick to articles about ""noteable"" things anyway? 

Of course some articles will have more views. But if you're looking for something specific, you're going to specific articles in Wikipedia. If you're going to allow for mistakes on those less read articles, why allow those articles at all?

Notable articles are fine and will be fine. Less notable articles, with less eyes on them, not so much. And eventually, people *will* read those specific articles."

Also, I am not a deletionist, believe me. But I understand their point.

If something is wrong on Wikipedia, it makes a universe of difference. Scientists, judges, doctors, politicians: they all read Wikipedia. And if everyone gets a wiki page, you can be sure there won't be enough people to check all of them.

So if you want to make Wikipedia a better place, my suggestion is: either click the edit button, or get us some more reliable sources (maybe you're a journalist, who knows?)."
