So I looked up and there was this light in the sky and I don't know if it was a reflection from the window or just one of those weird eye flashes but I definitely saw something. So I set my coffee back on the table while I took a closer look and it was still there but as I moved around our gorgeous new kitchen island we had installed last spring I kept my eye on it and you know the damn thing just disappeared.

So let me tell you what a mix of political and socially responsible people in my area have achieved. 

We have a local farmer that now has bees on his farm. We are surrounded with farms and 3 more have committed to housing bees also. 

People from different political leanings have put pressure on the council to install ports for electric cars. We have 17 designated points to date. Residents were asked to complete a survey asking if they would change to electric if they were installed 87% said they would. 

We now have reusable recycling bags instead of plastic. We are aiming to be plastic free by the end of this year. 

We have the council now not cutting some grass areas entirely leaving some areas long for wildlife and biodiversity. 

This year the council is changing some grass areas to plant wild flowers. 

Designated areas have been left for hedgehogs to hibernate in, all pressure from the locals. 

The council has completed 90% change over of street lighting to more economical types. They are white instead of the orange ones. They have also been more diligent with switching them on and off appropriately to save money. 

Over the past decade the council have refurbished all housing stock. They all have super insulation and solar panels. One of the farms has created a solar field on one of his most useless plots of land. 

There is a proposal in the works for all business properties in the town to have their own solar panels. The proposal is the excess funds are to be diverted to help bring down business rates. 

So you sit there and say that people are doing nothing. People are and if you got involved with your own you will probably see there is a lot more going on than you think. 

However, the people can only do so much. Industry is where our politicians let us down because there is only so much people can do themselves. My own town has come to a point where there isn't much more that we can do.
