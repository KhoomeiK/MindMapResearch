NoStupidQuestions,fgs4v59,t3_f023ap,1581071694.0,"IANAL, but the knife idea is a non-starter. If this is a domestic situation, you're likely looking at a TRO and potentially preemptive legal action by the other party. If it's a neighbor, coworker, or family member, same deal. It's an implied threat. You don't want to end up being the defendant here.

If you feel that you absolutely must put your thoughts/feelings/ultimatums into writing, do it the right way: have a lawyer draft a cease and desist order or file a civil complaint against this person (if applicable). If possible,  just block this person from your life by any means necessary.

You can leave a letter, just don't do any property damage. Be careful, too, that the content of the letter cannot be perceived as threatening physical violence, future retaliation, and/or future property damage ... or see first paragraph.

Good luck. Make good choices. The high road is usually the best road.

Before starting my Ph.D. program, I scheduled a meeting with ""the"" leading professor in one of my two fields. Everyone cited this guy, his work was innovative, and all of his grad students for the last 15-20 years went on to successful careers where they also made incredibly important contributions to the field. He was also a named chair/professor in my department, and incredibly influential: he could make or break your career before it even got off the ground.

He also *chose* to be my temporary advisor when I arrived on campus, by the way.

Turns out, he was a total self-centered, sexist prick. At our first meeting, he put his feet up on his desk and proceeded to read his mail (hard copy) while half-listening to me about my research plans for my first year and giving one or two word answers to my questions about coursework and joining his reading group (which was invitation only).

When he did make ""eye contact"", it was to stare at my boobs. I was dressed pretty conservatively/professionally, by the way.

Anyway, I put up with this guy for 6 years because I ""had"" to; I took his courses, but switched to a different and more supportive/badass female advisor who was just as (if not more) influential in my second field. Still, this guy was ""required"" to be on my dissertation committee due to university politics and the interdisciplinary nature of my work.

Three weeks before my scheduled defense, he bailed: he claimed that he had to be out of the country for a conference and couldn't participate. He was trying to force a rescheduled defense, which would have demanded that my 5 other committee members not only accommodate him, but ALSO that I wouldn't file on time or officially graduate on time ... just walk, get hooded, and receive my Ph.D. unceremoniously in August.

I had already accepted a tenure-track position and was in the process of selling a house, finding a new one in a different city, etc. Shit was stressful enough. 

Also, starting the new job at the assistant professor rank and pay grade meant that I had to have ""Ph.D. in hand"" according to HR to start on July 1. This guy's drama was threatening to spiral out and have a pretty negative impact on me and also inconvenience a lot of other people involved in the process.

Thankfully, my badass advisor called him and called him out.

She literally fired him from my committee (which is kind of unheard of/unprecedented) and got an override from the dean and the graduate school for another equally-qualified professor to fill the sixth role. This person was a saint, given the fact that they had less than 3 weeks to read my dissertation and prepare to fully participate in the oral defense process.

I passed 6/6 with flying colors and great recommendations (and rec letters, which are really important).

***Guess who was sitting outside the building smoking a cigarette when my committee and I walked out to celebrate with a round of drinks?***

You guessed it.

He allegedly got back a day early from his trip. He congratulated me and told me that he knew I was going to pass anyway.

I still received an excellent recommendation letter from him, but I'll never forgive him for the games that he *enjoyed playing* with people's lives and careers ... just because he ""could"": total narcissist."

Then ask yourself if it's valid. In most cases, it's not.

In other words, work to figure out where that baggage came from (toxic people, bullying/abuse at home, school, or in the workplace), unrealistic expectations from social media or pop culture, etc. and take the time to think it through ... and as much/frequently as possible, dump it in the garbage where it belongs.

Don't let other people and their negativity occupy free real estate in your head. We're all worthy of love and self-love when it's healthy (i.e. not narcissism).

Do things that bring joy and happiness into your life, take care of your body/health, celebrate your wins (small and large), and reflect on your mistakes/failures so you can grow from them also helps.

First, the Phoenix is a completely mythological bird: corvids get up all the time. Same with owls, seagulls, robins, etc.

The Phoenix also realizes when it's time to self-immolate and rise from the ashes. It has agency. No one sets the Phoenix ablaze, if you catch my drift

Thoughts?"
