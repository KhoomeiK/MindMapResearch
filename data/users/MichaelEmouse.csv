hypomania,ffqiqde,t1_ffqec77,1580135718.0,"Do you mean to decrease addiction to something else?

I'm not sure. The only thing I've ever been addicted to, in a way, was kratom and the compulsive, regular intake lasted a couple of weeks. I weaned myself off using meditation, exercise and edible pot. 

In terms of exercise, running long enough to trigger runner's high can give you a high that might partially replace whatever addiction is there. 

In terms of time-efficiency, eccentric overload is pretty good: You do negative movements with more weight than you can lift over and over again e.g.: If your bicep curl 1 rep max concentrically is 40lbs, you do negative curls with 40-60lbs 10-20 reps, several times throughout the day. It's going to be painful and you're going to be sore. You'll get lifter's high pretty fast though. After 1-3 months, lifter's high will come rather easily. Athlean-x's ""Sore in 6 minutes"" series has some examples but you can make your own. You'd basically be replacing an addictive maladaptive coping mechanism (drugs) with a non-addictive, adaptive coping mechanism (the feeling you get throughout the day after a hard workout). It's best done in the morning because exercise reduces stress for about 12 hours. It makes your whole day one notch better.

Meditation is also useful to learn to be aware of your impulses, take distance and not reflexively act on them."

It's possible that the military may have to engage in some romanticism to get people to risk their lives for what are often cynical or poorly-thought out objectives. In this case, it might be the officer who feels guilt over one of his men dying. His superior isn't interested in indulging that.

It's difficult to tell precisely because with mushrooms, the water content can make a one order of magnitude difference in potency, they're easily perishable food items and the psilocybin concentration likely varies a lot according to the part of the mushroom and the species.

If you're most comfortable at 1g, don't think of it as too little. One way you might consider it to try 1g the first week, 2g the second week, 3g the third week etc until you hit a point that makes you go: ""Oh, that was a little too much."" and then par it down.

I take LSD or ETH-LAD and tear up small pieces of the tab. More precise dosing, longer effects and less nausea. I started with normal and ridiculous dosing before introducing MD so I can't really say how long it will take. 


If I had to bet, I would say that microdosing likely takes about the same amount of time as exercise and meditation: 1 month to start barely noticing long term effects, 3-4 months for significant long term effects and one year for life-changing effects.

Research has been finding that psychedelics and meditation have similar neurological effects.
