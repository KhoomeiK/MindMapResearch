civ,ffg8767,t3_ete3ak,1579900559.0,">-I have pumped out more great writers than I have places for great works of writing. I currently have 5 or 6 cities, do I simply squeeze in low quality cities to build theatre square districts? Is there another method you would suggest?

Yes. You need those theaters and work slots even if they're in crappy 3 pop cities. SPam out the cities and make theaters ASAP. Just make sure you can defend them

>-I have been completing internal trade routes for the production of wonders, should I switch to international trade routes for the purpose of tourism (I don't really understand the how trade routes impact tourism)?

It kind of depends on what you need, but generally I'd say internal early and midgame to build, and then trade with others in the lategame to boost tourism once you have those wonders and theaters up.

>-Norway and Canada are my closest neighbors, but are not necessarily right on top of me. We all still have a little bit of room for growth. However, Brazil is a bit away and I know is competitive culturally. Should I go to war with Brazil?

Unfortunately, the way civ 6 is balanced, killing people is basically always optimal if you can get away with it. 

>-I'm not entirely sure how to transition from focusing on high culture output to tourism. I believe rock bands are the key, but again, unsure of the mechanics/strategy for this victory type.

Rock bands are bought with faith for some reason, but basically, high culture lets you unlock civics faster, which can get you first shot at wonders. It doesn't really directly get you high tourism but it gets you better chances at getting things which can, like wonders"

I heard ""why should I bother learning to use this equation, I can just plug it into wolfram alpha"" a lot, but the point isn't actually finding the answer to the math question, the point is learning the process to get it."
