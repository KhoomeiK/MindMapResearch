MoviesAnywhere,ff7hgkt,t1_ff76v4n,1579649643.0,Makes sense! Thanks!
MoviesAnywhere,ff74z6q,t1_ff6rbjm,1579641226.0,Okay. I typically use the MA app for my purchases but it would be much more convenient to buy from the tv specifically so that’s nice.
movies,ff63wls,t1_ff5rzk0,1579618498.0,Hell yes! The Peanut Butter Falcon was incredible and Honey Boy was amazing.
movies,ff63stb,t3_erpykg,1579618425.0,I’m really excited for Shia. He’s doing amazing work and seems to be genuinely happier.

AnimalsBeingBros,ff62ssh,t1_ff5fk8r,1579617698.0,She is definitely my forever kitten. These two were running around and wrestling this morning. They have too much fun haha
AnimalsBeingBros,ff4h2fa,t1_ff4a8px,1579563436.0,She wasn’t always aggressive so I knew something was seriously wrong and she was extremely lethargic. She’s always been sweet with me but she even attacked me some so I was over the moon when we received a legitimate diagnosis.
AnimalsBeingBros,ff3vmlf,t1_ff3tqib,1579549831.0,Salem is like her grandpa cat lol we adopted him on September because he’s an old love bug of a cat and he took to her immediately and she loves him so much.
AnimalsBeingBros,ff3vihj,t1_ff3jytr,1579549760.0,It was! She’s very healthy and happy now.
