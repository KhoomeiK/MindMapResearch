I hope you can help your fiancé w his anger management/patience issues so that you can all be a happy family together. If not though, I deeply hope you choose your sons safety above trying to be sensitive  to your finance. I know others have said it, but this is definitely abuse."

Done. Period. Talk about the millions of reasons he’s unsuitable for the presidency and this is the brick wall you can enjoy slamming into. As long as the national RtL group endorsed him, anti-choice people (including women) will vote for him."

science,ff93g7b,t1_ff8dc5z,1579703910.0,"Yeah I felt very “connected” to my “friends” until I stopped prioritizing my time and money around festivals, opened a business and stopped taking psychedelics. I didn’t stop because of some problem, I just petered out naturally and once I’d opened my restaurant, the drugs were making me more anxious than anything so I stopped taking them. 

I haven’t seen so many people in so long. The drugs connected me to people in ways that were only going to last if I kept up in the festival scene. I don’t blame the drugs....they were awesome and taught me a bunch of stuff that I don’t think I would have learned without those journeys. But connected? Idk...."

beyondthebump,fezuboi,t1_fezrzar,1579461754.0,"I have a long list of things I’m doing to try to facilitate a stressful, all around healthy eating environment. I posted a couple days go w part of the list. Part of that is not forcing food into his mouth, and not tricking him. But sometimes (truly not often, but sometimes) I cave and sneak in a bite. If he doesn’t want it, he’ll slowly squirt it out of his mouth. Like OP, he plays w his food joyful bit literally none or almost none of it will enter his mouth. He can be covered head to toe w food and his mouth will be almost or actually clean. Sometimes lots of food gets in his mouth, but almost all or actually all of it will come back out. 

This is new. He’s been on purées/oatmeal/yogurt and breastmilk with textured solids “for fun” since six months old and he was a champ until about a month ago he started refusing p/o/y but also isn’t eating the textured solids. Every few meals he decided he’s in love w something and eats a fair amount. Sometimes he’s distracted enough w his Cheerios to let me feed him w a spoon. But those meals feel way too far and few in between given his slower growth. He’s not losing weight, but his weight group keeps dropping. 

His doctor is having him come in for regular weight checks, agrees w the long particular list of things I’m trying, and said we’ll talk about medical intervention if it doesn’t improve. I would like to find a way to prevent that by helping him learn to eat but have been unable to eat consistently. I understand why people tell parents to just relax and let it happen, but sometimes that advice feels like it’s coming from parents whose kids are actually growing in a healthy pattern"
beyondthebump,fezk8py,t1_fezhtv8,1579458226.0,I’ve spoken at length with his pediatrician.

beyondthebump,fezjp1r,t1_fezi3vr,1579458041.0,This is exactly my point.
beyondthebump,fezddei,t1_fez1k5p,1579456178.0,People act like food before one is just for fun automatically leads to babies magically eating enough solids at one. You’re only one month away from one. What do people think is going to happen in just one month?
beyondthebump,fezd3lm,t1_fez20es,1579456081.0,"To me, especially at this point, the advice to just relax is the most wildly infuriating advice from people. Wilding infuriating. My kid is not eating and his growth chart is slowing to a concerning degree and he’s over one. 

“Food before one is just for fun” can suck a dick. My pediatrician says that someone this age absolutely needs to get nutrition from both milk AND solids. People who say that’s not the case are over-simplifying  the situation and minimizing legit concerns."

beyondthebump,fei0kgu,t1_fehhiwe,1579127669.0,"He just played w the Mac n cheese, didn’t eat a bite. He has been refusing his oatmeal and yogurt for days and only takes puréed foods once in a while. He suddenly hates being spoon fed so the only way I’ve been able to get anything in him at all his by helping him use the spoon himself. He seems interested in that about once every third meal. If this keeps up, I’m going to consider the pedisure route. He hates every formula we’ve ever tried with a fiery passion. That’s why I pumped until his doctor said I could use cow milk."

I like the milk w meals suggestion. That one is new, and I like the concept of showing him that milk is part of a meal rather than a meal on its own."
