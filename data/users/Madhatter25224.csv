Hate to break it to you but about ten years ago conservatives figured out they can be all bigoted and ignorant as a group online. Once that happened, social media became a tool for the right as much as for anyone else. For every democratic ad you see on facebook theres 3 by some flavor of conservative stupidity. And take twitter. If twitter followed its own rules, the president would have been banned off it before even getting the republican nomination in 2016. But they roll out the special treatment for trump as he breaks their rules multiple times a day.

Personally he is a miasma of lies and recriminations. In an environment where the media has been effectively neutered, every criticism will roll off his back while every minor success becomes the greatest achievement in human history. And nobody has the power to call him on any of it. He has an entire media apparatus dedicated to his aggrandizement, ready to outright lie on his behalf. He has multiple multibillionaire backers and the total support of big business. Without even being slightly religious there are those who see him as a servant of god.

Bernie Sanders is an aging politician in questionable health trying to pull together a coalition made up of a dozen disparate groups each with their own pet issues, little tolerance for not making their issue number one, and a ready willingness to just not vote if they don’t 100% get their way. Socialism is still an undesirable thing in America, you’ll find many registered democrats who object to the idea. He wants to change so much that people will be scared off because they won’t be able to see what america will be like after his changes.

Worst of all hes an old style politician who still thinks there are rules. Trump will eat him for breakfast on the debate stage and he won’t even have to speak any truths. He can just lie and assert and Sanders will lose badly. Because a win isn’t convincing democrats to vote trump, its convincing independents to vote trump and convincing democrats to stay home.

Bernie Sanders is the better man, the better politician, the better American with better ideas and it COULD NOT POSSIBLY MATTER LESS."

That doesn’t really address my point. In the richest nation on earth, buying your coffee instead of making it at home should not be a significant enough expenditure to matter.

Your premise seems to be that nothing significant has changed in this country financially over the last fifty years and therefore if young people are poor it must be something they are doing wrong. 

However there have been disastrous changes in the last fifty years which have resulted in the majority of the nationals wealth concentrated in a tiny percentage of the population and the explosive growth of an underprivileged poor working class as well as the gutting of the middle class almost down to nothing.

Severe wealth disparity is a proven reality in this country. Before blaming peoples financial struggles on a macchiato, you should first address that.

Jeff Bezos is worth 114 Billion dollars. 

If you worked for 1,000 dollars an hour, 24 hours a day 7 days a week 356 days a year it would take you thirteen thousand years to match his fortune.

Just to drive this completely home, if you worked at 1000 dollars an hour from the exact moment of your birth and never stopped, you would still die of old age before becoming a billionaire.
