Hair,feejf9z,t3_eoiv4m,1579034968.0,"I have hair similar to yours and used Sun-In when I was a teenager. I loved the look of it but when I went to get it dyed my stylist reprimanded me severely, apparently it's very bad for your hair and doesn't come out, so you're pretty much stuck with that damaged hair until it grows out and gets cut off.

Here's my rule of thumb: if you want to go darker, you can do it yourself. If you want to go lighter, get it done professionally. Pay attention, get it done right, and ask them about maintaining it yourself. I had platinum hair for about 5 years and doing root touch ups was fairly easy once I'd learned enough.

If money is an issue, find a school nearby, they will do it for cheaper(since it's a student) but you'll still get quality work."

Like I know it's a terrible movie full of plot holes and romanticizes Harley and Joker's generally abusive relationship, and helicopter crashes should NOT be the standard mode of transportation but man I just love that movie so much, it's just fun to watch and Margot Robbie is my favorite Harley I've seen so far. I'm a big fan of DC though."

AskReddit,fe6o1jk,t1_fe6n9vf,1578897666.0,"I think a big part is to communicate before you get angry to the point of irrationality. Plus, remember exactly why you're angry and what you're angry at. Are you mad that your partner didn't do the dishes like you'd asked, or are you mad that them not listening to you brought up your own insecure feelings of being ignored? Once you do that you can better figure out what the problem is and remember that this person loves you and isn't actively trying to hurt you; they just don't know. Don't get mad at someone for something they don't understand when you can teach them instead."

My dog has allergy issues(we thought it was chicken for a while, now I'm not so sure, he is still red and itchy after switching to a chicken free food) and I have been canceling autoships left and right trying to get it figured out. Once I saw a good dog food on sale from a brand that he'd tried before, but it was beef(my dog LOVES beef) so I ordered it, not checking the ingredients first(because the one I'd tried was chicken free and my idiot brain assumed this one would be too) The day it was supposed to arrive, my brain woke up and I checked the ingredients. Yep, chicken. I sent them a message apologizing for my error and asked if I could return it once it arrived and I would totally pay for shipping. They refunded my card no questions asked, and just told me to donate the dog food to my local shelter. 

They have been so patient with me trying to figure out my dog's allergy problem and I will buy dog food from them probably forever.

Also, if anyone knows of any good chicken free dog foods let me know! The allergen-free one my vet wants me to try is like $90 a bag. I'd go through 2 bags a month with my monster and I can't afford that."

It's a slippery slope though if you do want to try it. You get addicted to that super silky feeling when your shirt sleeve brushes up against your arm. Be warned."
aww,fdk8d1b,t1_fdk4jhw,1578498396.0,"Don't treat train your dog and you won't have this problem. Reward them with excitement and attention and pets instead! They will learn what makes you happy and do those things, not just the things that earn them treats. To clarify, my dog still gets treats, they're just more random instead of a rewarding device. All he has to do is sit patient while I get it out for him. 

The only time my dog will try and shake when I haven't told him to is when I have his ball. I used to make him shake for it, but we've been working on other stuff. Sometimes he'll get fed up and try the ole reliable shake tactic but it doesn't work."

By the way, I had platinum/grey hair for about 5 years and I did it all myself. I would recommend getting your hair to that point by a professional but you absolutely can do root touch ups yourself. I have very golden hair as well, takes me about two hours to bleach and tone it.

Actually, I have a ton of bleach, developer, and toner left over that is just going to sit here unused, as it was sort of a spontaneous decision to go back to my natural. I'd be happy to send it to you! PM me if you want it. No charge. :D"

relationships,fcyjilt,t3_ejh10s,1578081113.0,"Farts are farts. If he farts in front of you that just means he's comfortable. Think about it, if you're home alone you're not going to excuse yourself from yourself to fart. The fact that he lets them loose means he feels at home with you. However, it's weird he didn't do some sort of asking permission first. 

On my third date with my SO he suddenly goes 'okay if this relationship is going to go anywhere, I'm going to need to fart in front of you, I don't want to be in pain all the time from holding them in.' And i said 'let them loose!' And he did, and does, even during serious conversations. I actually think it's nice, lightens the mood to pause and giggle at a fart during a serious conversation. His normally don't stink at all, though sometimes they are BAD. His family is more open than mine, maybe your SO was raised similarly.

I would accept it. Maybe even join in! It's funny to be immature sometimes."
AmItheAsshole,fcy40ef,t3_ejfavh,1578074437.0,"NAH, but I think there's a lot of compromises here that aren't even being considered. Flowy pantsuits seem to be the best option here, as they can look like a dress while you're standing and are very elegant. Are you planning on having feminine hair and makeup for the wedding? Is that something your sister cares about? For example, 'I'll put on makeup and wear earrings if I can wear pants', or 'I'll wear a dress but I won't wear makeup or anything'(if that's something you care about). There's also lots of other roles you could play, including maybe even being a groomsman! There's no need to ruin a relationship with a sibling for something as silly as whether your legs get their own sleeve of fabric or have to share. 

I agree that if it's something you can't compromise on, don't be a bridesmaid. Don't hold it over her head like an ultimatum, but gently say it's something you really don't want to do."
AskReddit,fcpphob,t3_ei9bm3,1577869326.0,"I was starved for touch for years. I'd see people hold hands, hug, etc. And it always awakened this ache in me that I always tried so hard to keep down. Even in movies when there was a touching scene, if I was having a bad depression day it was hard to keep control of my emotions. Sometimes I just felt so alone. 

My SO has changed that. I think he was in a similar situation, starved for touch, and both of our love languages are physical touch. It's like a drug. Any time we are together, we are touching. Not necessarily even in a super touchy way like holding hands or cuddling, but we're touching in any way we can. Maybe just our shoulders next to each other or our feet are crossed over each other, or our knees are touching under the table, or he brushes my arm as he walks past... whatever we can do. If I'm near him, we're fulfilling that starving ache, and after 2 years i still can't get enough. I think back to that lonely time and the dark place I was in and compare it to now and as cheesey as it sounds, he's just my anchor to reality. I can't fall down that dark hole i was in as long as he's touching me."
aww,fcpmtg9,t1_fcpekvz,1577867705.0,"As the owner of a Great Dane I kind of wish mine had his tail docked. I love the look of his tail and obviously love him just the way he is but man is it a pain to deal with! It has knocked over children, put down full grown men with nut shots, left many bruises on many legs, knocked stuff off tables, there's a mystery dent in my wall right at tail height and I'm pretty sure it was him... even when he's just walking, the sway of his hips translates into some serious force behind that whip. he whacks it into something or another multiple times a day and I'm always concerned he's going to break it."
aww,fcpm9ko,t1_fcpfswv,1577867382.0,"Can confirm. I have a Great Dane and a 2 bedroom apartment for the first 2 years of his life. So long as you take them on walks they don't need tons of space, but of course mine loves running free like any other dog. 

They also don't eat as much as you think. A 30lb bag of dog food lasts about 3 weeks, and I'm pretty sure I over feed him. Low energy=low calories."
AskReddit,fcnfsnm,t1_fcly17q,1577810820.0,"My cousins named their kids all weird names, then legally changed them later. Their philosophy is that you have to get to know your child for a few months before you can find the right name, but since you can't leave the hospital without one, they made it a game. Plus it's a cool story for the kids. I can't remember all of them but I believe their last one was named Ultimus."

aww,fcgb89d,t3_eh6v5j,1577638283.0,"When I was training my Great Dane I took extra care to annoy the crap out of him often. Touch his face and whiskers, the hair between his paws, grab his tail, his ears, his cheeks, etc. I felt kind of bad because he hated it so much but I made it a game and eventually he turned around. Now I can trust him with my 1 year old niece and any baby/child and I know they can pull on his face or touch his paws and he won't even react since it's a game. I highly recommend it! I'm still around to supervise any interaction he has with babies of course but that's more because his tail wags and hip checks can accidentally take down an adult. I'm not worried about him snapping."
