Rubbish? Ok, Milo's a childish shock jock, but Murray's an established scientist who's views are within the scientific mainstream and purports himself as such. To cite them in the same sentence suggests you're not acting in good faith."

Long gone are the days when women couldn't hold the same job as a man, or a black person couldn't buy the same house as anyone else.

That's how I see modern SJWs. They want to fight the same good ol fight as their grandparents, but all those problems have been largely solved. So they have to invent new problems that even they don't really care about. Or outright lie about things like racism or the gender pay gap to make it look like the old problems are still around."
samharris,ff64esp,t1_ff1hoar,1579618855.0,"> Is he actually trying to say that affirmative action is racist? That would be incredibly moronic, no?

Racism: treating someone based solely on their race

Affirmative Action: government policy that treats people based solely on their race

Yeah, totally moronic...to anyone who doesn't have a dictionary and basic reading comprehension skills...

This is why conservatives are fucked. The left is the king of propaganda. They've completely fooled almost everyone into thinking racism is not only ok, but a moral good. It's all about re-branding. Who wouldn't like action that's affirmative? It sounds so great! It's [doubleplusgood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspeak)!"
samharris,ff640k7,t1_ff11a1s,1579618576.0,"You mean the totally reasonable and definitely not racist views of Evergreen State protesters like ""white people aren't allowed to come on campus and anyone who disagrees gets a boot in their face""?

samharris,ff63shx,t1_fezxicp,1579618418.0,"Sounds like a pretty accurate term though, especially for the Twitter crowd.

They just yell and scream and call you names."
samharris,ff62gtu,t1_ff2j190,1579617457.0,"Virtually all of them? Are Hollywood celebrites and lefty politicians not prominent leftists? Is AOC not a prominent leftist? She gave a [press conference](https://freebeacon.com/politics/ocasio-cortez-latinos-cant-be-illegals-because-theyre-descendants-of-native-people/
) where she argued that because Hispanics are part native American, they own the US, and therefore should be allowed to ignore immigration law, and therefore ICE is racist for stopping them from retaking what is rightfully theirs.

To a classical liberal, that sounds like racist horseshit. But not only is that her view so uncontroversial among today's leftists and Democrats that not a single mainstream media outlet ran with the story, despite them all having video footage of it.

I'd challenge you to find a leftist who believes racism is simply ""prejudging someone based on the color of their skin"". Ask any Democrat, and they'll tell you only racists believe that's the definition of racism."

Strange statement for him to make, as someone who was attacked for his race by people on the left. There's certainly some segment of left ideology that is obsessed with race. I think he's just misconstruing that idea.

However, racism is neither exclusive to the left or right. The majority of both reject it, but there are still some on both sides who embrace it."

[I don't believe that's true](https://theblog.okcupid.com/why-okcupid-is-changing-how-you-message-f14d492e7853). You don't see messages from people you haven't ""liked"". They made that change in late 2017, although I think most people still aren't aware of it, since it's not really mentioned anywhere in the UI. I think I only noticed it myself until early 2019.

""Messages are now just for the people you like""

""Now all of your messages will be from people you’ve liked. We don’t want to inundate you with messages from people you’ve passed on, or people who’ve messaged you that you haven’t liked yet."""
OkCupid,ff5zf5t,t1_ff4f5zy,1579615102.0,"No, I'm sorry, he's right. Yes, he assumed you were talking about a woman because most people here are men, and most women just message ""hi"", on the rare event when they bother to message anyone. Most profiles I see even explicitly say they won't message anyone. ""Just message me!"" Even Okcupid's blog has talked about this.

He didn't say he hated anyone. Just mentioned a pattern he saw, which science confirms. Women generally (not always) want to be provided for, and usually expect men to initiate everything.

I'm glad you're an outlier, but that doesn't make him a woman hater anymore than your assumptions and comment makes you a man hater. If you jump on someone for such a mild comment, prepare to remain a lonely hampster forever."

OkCupid,ff5yqn3,t1_ff21f5y,1579614547.0,"Yeah, it's a balance. You don't want to just write something low-effort like ""hi"", but you don't want to spend too much time writing anything too high-effort, because 99.99% of both men and women won't message anyone back. Especially now with the site change where they won't even see your message unless they accidentally like your profile, it's even less likely they'll respond, since Okcupid won't even show them your message.

The middle ground I've settled into is to start out with a general greeting, and then a short question about something in their profile. Low-effort, so in the likely event they never even see my message, not much lost, but if they do see it, they know I'm not just spamming profiles."
