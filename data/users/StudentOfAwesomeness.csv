JoeRogan,ffhgp6b,t1_ffhejm0,1579934473.0,I have literally seen this comment almost verbatim on Twitter.
SandersForPresident,ffh71dp,t1_ffh3dq1,1579924907.0,"Okay I skipped the first 5 minutes then watched every second. It's a much more relevant video than the other one so thanks. I'm not entirely sure how (or even if I want) to argue against this video, so instead I'll list a few points swirling in my head:

1. This video still doesn't really refute my point about not shoving trans issues in kids faces and at schools, she only mentions child trans once in passing at minute 8.
2. Watching this video gave me a glimpse on just how many issues that trans people face. Whether it's internal or external, pre or post, there seems to be a huge number of shit they have to go through. Most of which I hadn't considered (for example a ton of hate they get from cis-women, which obviously I wouldn't know as a male). So thanks for showing me that.
3. Leading on from point 2, the way this person in particular reasons her arguments is very appeasing. She tries to reason logically from almost a centrist position, then works her way into how it affects trans people and why it's unwanted. I think if everyone reasoned in that way, the discussion would be a lot more fruitful with less hatred (but as she recognizes, would still mean trans people bear most of the brunt towards equality, instead of rightfully blaming bigotry on those who are actively being dicks).

Based on her arguments, I can reduce my points to the kids thing. I'll take back my belief that the narrative moved too far left and it was only a matter of time before it snapped back to the right (ala Trumpism), even if I may be empirically correct I will admit that it's still the wrong way for things to have gone. I just want everyone to be level headed when approaching discussions and arguments, and if the far-right want to troll, then you either ignore them or debate with them with logic, if you lower yourself to responding with more hatred, you're stooping to their level and letting them win and cement themselves further in their hate. And you'll end up misidentifying many left, progressive folk that just have some concerns as people on the right who are trying to troll.

But yes, it seems unfair for what they go through, so I'll just take a step back from my arguments."
SandersForPresident,ffh5igf,t1_ffh4ka6,1579923678.0,"My main line of inquiry would be:

Are we sure we're not equating ""but you can't teach kids about being gay in school!"" with ""but you can't teach kids about being trans in school!""

There's a nuanced but large difference between ""people can be attracted to the same gender"" and ""people can be trapped inside the wrong body"".

For one thing, we don't even know that the latter is true, just that there is SOME science that is shaky that shows some non-concrete brain variations in trans people (and gay people for that matter, the available science is stupid is my point). The other thing is being attracted to someone, whether it's a man or woman, makes sense. Being ""in the wrong body"" just, absolutely wouldn't equate to the same type of mental hurdles required to reach that conclusion.

It's just not what we should be teaching, but I'm open to other ways of teaching the issue. One way that I would prefer (but willing to compromise on), would be to say ""some people feel that they could be in the wrong body, we don't know why this is yet because we don't understand how the brain works yet. If people decide that they feel this way, we should support them. We should also support them if they are confused and feel this way, but end up realizing that they're not trans. This doesn't mean trans people don't exist, it's just a very sensitive topic, and it's not easy to recognize your identity sometimes. As you develop into adulthood, it's important to develop an identity of your own, and if you do think that you may share some of these concerns about yourself, there is a multitude of information and counselling available to discuss this and how you could approach it."""
SandersForPresident,ffh3m2i,t1_ffh3hsr,1579922196.0,"Nice, you're a gigantic bigot, intolerant of other views, and worse, unable to express yourself in a reasoned discussion or debate other than calling the other person hateful names.

SandersForPresident,ffh316f,t1_ffh232a,1579921749.0,"But the logical premise of the video isn't valid? I literally didn't even consider the trans person's sexual preference before trying to watch this video, which then paraded the above as the primary argument that the video is trying to disprove."
SandersForPresident,ffh2jsp,t1_ffh1wr7,1579921383.0,"I accept where you're coming from. Even though I had an easy time of... not being a homophobe, a lot of my peers were not quite so accepting. So I can absolutely agree that there is a need for better education.

&#x200B;

>Kids **are** dumb because we teach them long division, not useful stuff like emotional regulation, sexuality, and gender relations. Things actually applicable to the entirety of the human race throughout one's lifetime. Even straight sexual education gets stymied by religious nutbars. That's how far behind the curve we are and so long as we stifle discussion these sciences will remain in their infancy.

I can also agree with this. I would then say that the fundamentals need to be taught properly first, and then from the ground up we can work our way into educating kids on the more nuanced issues, such as gay rights and then trans issues. It makes no sense to, as you said, have religious nutbars stifle this type of education but then try and do a 180 and teach kids about trans issues before working out the rest of the issues.

In MY experience, this type of education was not up to standards. I wouldn't feel right if they tried to then inject trans issues without properly vetting the information and training teachers on how to approach the issue without polarising people.

I could be wrong here and education on this issue could be great. I really do feel the conversation around ""should we do this"" and ""how should we implement this"" hasn't been allowed, and people just really rushed into getting this into part of woke culture."
SandersForPresident,ffh1h3m,t1_ffh0zjd,1579920572.0,I don't agree with puberty blockers. Normalising this is wrong. Science will show that even these have lasting ramifications and shouldn't be prescribed to children.

SandersForPresident,ffh0umd,t1_ffh07qd,1579920098.0,"Okay I'll take the time to bring nuance into this because you said please.

Firstly, I said we do not understand the science behind trans, and therefore should not be teaching it in schools. This was my primary argument which you seem to have completely ignored in your ""rewording"".

My **SECONDARY** argument, is that kids don't have a sense of identity yet, and that they may choose to be trans, which has **permanent effects** which you seem to have ignored again, for your preferred reading of my point.

Now, I had a gay experience once because I was unsure of my own identity. When you're a kid and people are talking about how some people are gay but don't know it and you haven't formed your own concrete identity (and sexuality) yet, you can get confused. I don't regret the experience, I don't think it was necessary either at all for my development into adulthood (nor was it damaging). But if I had taken a permanent decision to undergo a transition to the opposite gender, even just using hormone blockers, I think that's a line that should be avoided until after schooling at least.

So yeah, you have reduced my arguments into a one sentence soundbite. This is not the way you want to approach any issue."
SandersForPresident,ffh0fsd,t1_ffh00yi,1579919783.0,"Because you are the side trying to bring about fundamental, societal change.

I fully, completely support that. But to question why you have to try and convince other people is a bit ridiculous, no? There exists a set of rules and societal norms. If you want to shake it up and get people to see your perspective, it is then up to you to offer the peach branch.

I'm sorry, I accept your peace branch, but you're not only trying to offer a peace branch but you're also trying to dictate how, what, when, where, why, and who we should treat you as. We're not allowed to voice our opinion, we're not allowed to show our concerns, we're not allowed any compromise or leeway (ie. schools and kids as I iterated earlier).

SandersForPresident,ffgwn0d,t1_ffgvu78,1579916943.0,"I would think there are many arguments and I won't try and represent arguments that I'm not familiar with, instead I'll use what I personally believe. Remember, people will have arguments of varying degrees of transphobicness. I'm coming from a place more of critical reasoning and a history of human errors.

First off, I really, truly, wholly believe that we as humans do not understand the human psyche or psychological disorders or mental health issues at all. I think we're not even 10% accurate on our diagnoses and the originations of most of our mental health disorders. We had Freud who, at the time, was famous and everyone took his psychoanalyses as fact. With the benefit of hindsight just a hundred years later, we now know that he was full of complete shit. That was just 100 years ago. We barely know any better about the inner mechanisms of the human brain except that there are synapses that fire neurons. That's about what we know about the brain, and that if you take MRI snapshots you can see a bunch of electromagnetic signals, but we have no clue what they are, what they mean, we can only try and interpret meaning by rudimentally comparing snapshots to what we consider ""normal"" or ""healthy"" people.

With that out of the way, my primary argument against teaching kids about trans in schools is that we just don't know enough about it to be teaching kids about the issue as if its fact. Kids don't have the critical reasoning ability to think and reason like I just did. They take what they learn in school and accept it as fact, because schools teach FACTS. I would support teaching it in college or as a compulsory (but not affecting academic scores) sit-in lecture in the later years of high school, with the addendum that it is still a new-ish area of psychology that mostly relies on shaky science.

My secondary argument is that it normalises the issue of trans people to the point where kids will think they are trans, and end up wanting to go through the transition. Kids don't know what they want, kids are dumb. To treat kids as if they're intelligent enough to think about their identity in this way, when they **haven't even formed their own identity** yet, can be incredibly damaging and again, is resting on unproven science. The ramifications are just far too damaging.

I was never taught about gay people in school. I am still very accepting of them. If I was taught about gay people in school, I may have thought I was gay. Even that is okay because worst case scenario: I have a gay experience and then realise I'm not. In the case of trans - if I decide I'm trans and go through a transition, my life is irrevocably changed with so far unknown consequences."
SandersForPresident,ffgvmkg,t1_ffgvg4x,1579916203.0,Sorry I edited my comment because I forgot the original comment I was replying to was about transphobic violence.
SandersForPresident,ffgv68p,t1_ffguww8,1579915872.0,"I will agree with you here. They are not entitled to violence. It's never okay.

But the conversation which leads to people choosing violence can be more open and welcoming. In a way, the people who marginalize these people are contributing to the culture of violence. Have the conversation, let them understand that you can have a difference in opinion, and that all your opinions matter. If you marginalize them and ridicule them, they will choose violence to spite YOU, not the trans people specifically."

It is not these people's faults they're being pushed out of the controlled narrative surrounding issues they don't feel comfortable with. It's not entirely the left's fault either for trying to push them out of the narrative (since they clearly believe in their own side of the debate). It's more a symptom of a two party political system where you get one vote and one say in a field of millions of votes once every 4 years.

My advice would be to stop trying to marginalise people who disagree with you (including Republicans) and stop trying to shoot down their talking points. Engage with them, show them you're willing to listen and understand where they're coming from, then try and refute their points with neutrally sound, logical reasoning.

The business model still works, you just need to be big enough to cut deals and target bonuses with the airlines and suppliers directly.

And I'll tell you what, having worked there for a year. There are flights and tickets that you cannot get as an online customer, the rules for putting together a ticket is pretty archaic and complicated, and you need full access to a specialised booking engine to be able to construct fares in this way. Online platforms only present very standard flights and no way of looking and manipulating the rules for constructing a ticket.

SandersForPresident,fejggpx,t1_fejg7of,1579173089.0,"Yeah the people that have stuck with Warren over the past months arenâ€™t likely to leave her now which may explain why her polling didnâ€™t drop, sheâ€™s already shed the non-hardcore supporters.

And youâ€™re right, the CNN audio didnâ€™t help her case imo BUT as I stated, her supporters are unlikely to leave her now. I just think the 538 article is dumb and they drew way too many conclusions on very small number changes, basically within the margin of error. But nope, theyâ€™ll say â€œWarrenâ€™s campaign played a move which was wildly successfulâ€. What the heck, no it wasnâ€™t lol. 2.5% is nothing and thereâ€™s no reason to believe it will start new momentum considering the backlash.

What we can deduce from this, and no one else is talking about this, is that Warren is unlikely to drop out from the race even if she flunks Super Tuesday. I think this because 1. Womenâ€™s movement 2. Stick it to Bernie, since her supporters would likely move to him and 3. She would be emulating what Bernie did in 2016 which gives them more political capital for next time, and sheâ€™s petty enough to do it to him to kneecap him like many in the establishment think he did to Hillary by continuing."
SandersForPresident,fejfzec,t1_fejcqy3,1579172408.0,"She gained like 2.5% while Bernie stayed more or less stable (actually up <1%). I also believe this is a temporary uptick.

That is absolutely marvellous considering she used the dirtiest trick in the book. The timing, the agenda (sexism), if it was anyone else the numbers could and would have been way higher. But it barely had an impact. I would say the marginal increase for Warren was solely due to her speech about women and some of her answers which, objectively, were quite strong.

I would call that a win for Bernie. The attack happened and failed. All it did was cement Bernieâ€™s supporters, win over some support of the mainstream media (even if itâ€™s temporary) and showed that his campaign is extremely resilient to these baseless attacks."

SandersForPresident,feh1xpv,t1_feh19jj,1579107443.0,"My question is:

Was the Warren campaign trying to propel the feminist movement by ""exposing"" what they legitimately thought was a sexist remark that Bernie said?

Or were they trying to take him down using the feminist narrative, which had the potential to backfire and actually set back the feminist movement if it failed?

Like, can an actual woman weigh in on this one for me? Because if it's the first one I can unequivocally say ""okay what they did, they did because they thought it was the right thing to do"" and leave it at that.

If it's the second one, that is some fucking shady underhanded tactics that in no way represent anything close to feminism. That is **absolutely not** looking out for women and women's rights and the campaign should be ashamed of themselves.

Just different degrees of the same weirdness."
AskReddit,fegxnrj,t1_fegx5p0,1579104828.0,"Iâ€™m defending it because I took the position before I began the argument that itâ€™s possible the reason people do it may be linked to why people feel like theyâ€™re trapped in the opposite gender.

Iâ€™m defending it because itâ€™s literally the title of the thread. If anything Iâ€™m the one sticking to the subject matter. Never said you thought it was a bad thing but the framing of the OPâ€™s question definitely does to some degree.

Anyway how do we know that people that want to use anime pictures donâ€™t have similar physiological abnormalities and chemicals in their brains, just to a much much lesser extent, that causes them to want to do girly shit?

Iâ€™m not being hateful, although youâ€™re right in your suspicion that I donâ€™t (and canâ€™t) understand the whole trans business of thinking youâ€™re stuck in the opposite genderâ€™s body. But again Iâ€™m not hating on it, just drawing equivalences to things like OPâ€™s question. Or are you going to tell me thatâ€™s not allowed."
AskReddit,fegwukr,t1_fegwgnd,1579104316.0,"Right.

So ignoring the hate filled part of your reply, I would suggest that maybe itâ€™s a spectrum, and maybe some people feel slightly girly without feeling like theyâ€™re actually a girl. So maybe these people who are not all the way on that spectrum, would still find it relieving or â€œnaturalâ€ to them to do stuff like put cute anime shit as their profile pictures, which is an anonymous way (or not) of identifying themselves online as the type of character in the picture?

So yeah going back to the hateful part of your reply, itâ€™s weird that you so vigorously attack me for trying to create an equivalence between two similar topics but itâ€™s completely okay for the OP to ask a question like that without being seen as hateful."

That type of thing usually stems from something. If it continues to be an issue maybe you could see a therapist?

I believe the dividing line between normal anxiety and an issue you should get checked out is when it starts impacting your everyday routine/life in a negative way.

Or hell, if you're up for it learn about spirituality. How everyone is connected and when you die you just go back into the earth from whence you came. You're just but a small, tiny piece of the larger picture which is the universe. You are the universe experiencing itself.

I like to say, time has already happened. If you could see the world from a higher dimension, you would see the universe in full, beginning to end. But we just experience it in a way where we can understand time.

Or just ignore this spiritual bullshit and get on with your life."

The infrastructure is built to make life better - easier traffic for roads and in this case, more uptime for the electricity grid. The purpose was never to save people money, it was built as an emergency response to state-wide blackouts if I recall correctly.

So they need to make the money back for the investment into the tollways/batteries, but as a commercial enterprise even once fully paid off they'll keep going to make money from it. Again, unlikely they'll ever pass on the profits to the customer unless the government intervenes."
