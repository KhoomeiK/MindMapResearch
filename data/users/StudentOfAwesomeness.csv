Do you get why a banana duct taped is seen as art now? Because everything is art. But if everything is art, then could even a banana duct taped count as art? Well let’s find out. Boom. It’s almost like meta art.

What do you think art is? A collection of colours? Something that looks pretty to the eye? A painting that tells a story, or has historical significance? Something that takes a lot of practice? Or something that’s mostly raw talent and creativity?

I would say art is anything that is unique. And a banana duct taped is absolutely unique, even if it’s unique in its stupidity. And I’m sure you could make art from something not unique as well."

They make 66% of their profits from corporate customers, while having the vast majority of staff working on the ground in retail.

They are insanely profitable and have a $500 million rainy day fund sitting in a bank.

The business model still works, you just need to be big enough to cut deals and target bonuses with the airlines and suppliers directly.

And I'll tell you what, having worked there for a year. There are flights and tickets that you cannot get as an online customer, the rules for putting together a ticket is pretty archaic and complicated, and you need full access to a specialised booking engine to be able to construct fares in this way. Online platforms only present very standard flights and no way of looking and manipulating the rules for constructing a ticket. This is fine for most personal travel but if you have more complex requirements (ie. corporate travel, round the world flights, complicated multi-journey flights) then having a travel agent to navigate this for you can help a LOT."

So then what the fuck happens after we die? Do we wake up as someone else? But that wouldn't make sense because our consciousness is just a bunch of electrical signals in our brain and when we die those impulses cease to exist. Then we just shut off and experience nothing? Why the fuck are we conscious anyway? How do electrical synapses in our brain equate to what we experience as consciousness? What the fuck?

And you’re right, the CNN audio didn’t help her case imo BUT as I stated, her supporters are unlikely to leave her now. I just think the 538 article is dumb and they drew way too many conclusions on very small number changes, basically within the margin of error. But nope, they’ll say “Warren’s campaign played a move which was wildly successful”. What the heck, no it wasn’t lol. 2.5% is nothing and there’s no reason to believe it will start new momentum considering the backlash.

What we can deduce from this, and no one else is talking about this, is that Warren is unlikely to drop out from the race even if she flunks Super Tuesday. I think this because 1. Women’s movement 2. Stick it to Bernie, since her supporters would likely move to him and 3. She would be emulating what Bernie did in 2016 which gives them more political capital for next time, and she’s petty enough to do it to him to kneecap him like many in the establishment think he did to Hillary by continuing."
SandersForPresident,fejfzec,t1_fejcqy3,1579172408.0,"She gained like 2.5% while Bernie stayed more or less stable (actually up <1%). I also believe this is a temporary uptick.

That is absolutely marvellous considering she used the dirtiest trick in the book. The timing, the agenda (sexism), if it was anyone else the numbers could and would have been way higher. But it barely had an impact. I would say the marginal increase for Warren was solely due to her speech about women and some of her answers which, objectively, were quite strong.

I would call that a win for Bernie. The attack happened and failed. All it did was cement Bernie’s supporters, win over some support of the mainstream media (even if it’s temporary) and showed that his campaign is extremely resilient to these baseless attacks."

Like, can an actual woman weigh in on this one for me? Because if it's the first one I can unequivocally say ""okay what they did, they did because they thought it was the right thing to do"" and leave it at that.

If it's the second one, that is some fucking shady underhanded tactics that in no way represent anything close to feminism. That is **absolutely not** looking out for women and women's rights and the campaign should be ashamed of themselves.

Anyway how do we know that people that want to use anime pictures don’t have similar physiological abnormalities and chemicals in their brains, just to a much much lesser extent, that causes them to want to do girly shit?

I’m not being hateful, although you’re right in your suspicion that I don’t (and can’t) understand the whole trans business of thinking you’re stuck in the opposite gender’s body.

PublicFreakout,fego9w0,t1_fego0gi,1579098588.0,"I once had an acid trip where I thought I was going to die (someone was going to kill me?) and I was okay with it because I thought I understood the world and I guess I was just okay with having it all end because, I mean, I was happy with everything and thought I experienced everything life had to offer.

Then at the last second I had this revelation and I was like ""fuck that! I do NOT want to die"".

So I guess my point is we're all afraid to die at some level.

It's what keeps us on our toes."
PublicFreakout,fegnn3y,t1_fegn9eh,1579098124.0,"I hope it gets better.

That type of thing usually stems from something. If it continues to be an issue maybe you could see a therapist?

I believe the dividing line between normal anxiety and an issue you should get checked out is when it starts impacting your everyday routine/life in a negative way.

Or hell, if you're up for it learn about spirituality. How everyone is connected and when you die you just go back into the earth from whence you came. You're just but a small, tiny piece of the larger picture which is the universe. You are the universe experiencing itself.

I like to say, time has already happened. If you could see the world from a higher dimension, you would see the universe in full, beginning to end. But we just experience it in a way where we can understand time.

Or just ignore this spiritual bullshit and get on with your life."

I'm a bad hombre to an 11 year old and I'm a fucking nerd."

PublicFreakout,fegmyz8,t1_feg6dre,1579097618.0,"How old are you mate?

People their age have been through far worse. Shielding kids from this stuff doesn't help. He didn't rob them of a childhood, although he very well could have. ""It could begin to haunt him"" takes a backrow seat to ""he could have died because he was black with a gun""."
PublicFreakout,fegmsrx,t1_feg57in,1579097483.0,"If anything he made them smarter. Kids are dumb because they haven't learnt stuff yet. This guy taught them a very, very valuable lesson that many people don't get until they're 20+. I would consider them lucky to be taught by someone in a frame that is positive, there are many layers to this lesson, who gave it, who could've given it, what else could've happened, choices and consequences of those choices, a sprinkle about the reality of being black etc.

All of that framed in the right way."
PublicFreakout,fegmlzx,t1_feg18lb,1579097336.0,"He's giving the kids a life lesson.

Yes, they may be young, but who knows if there will ever be another opportunity for this type of lesson to be given to those kids. It's not like he's robbing them of their childhood, kids have gone through far worse especially in the past. Better to give them this lesson now than never."

australia,fegla80,t1_fegiaea,1579096277.0,"Dunno how they'll tackle that in the future (definitely has to be a Labor government intervention on capping prices) but it's kind of like the tollways.

The infrastructure is built to make life better - easier traffic for roads and in this case, more uptime for the electricity grid. The purpose was never to save people money, it was built as an emergency response to state-wide blackouts if I recall correctly.

So they need to make the money back for the investment into the tollways/batteries, but as a commercial enterprise even once fully paid off they'll keep going to make money from it. Again, unlikely they'll ever pass on the profits to the customer unless the government intervenes."
australia,fegkrdb,t1_fefrkh8,1579095808.0,"Yes, and by ""the people who were supposed to take care of it"" we don't mean the government, we mean all the other older folk who keep voting them in.

We know that the government can do stupid shit, but it's the older voters who treat us like dumbasses and keep voting Liberal no matter how much the world falls apart. Christ, they smeared millennials and treated us like second class citizens for over a decade because we tried to speak up about not being able to afford a million dollar house.

As long as they get their negative gearing and franking credits, ey?"
