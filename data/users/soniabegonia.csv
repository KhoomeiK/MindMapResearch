dysautonomia,ff9btec,t3_es868d,1579709387.0,"As others have said, your heart rate is supposed to shoot up and then fall back down over the course of a couple minutes when you stand up. In contrast to what happens with you, what happens with me is that my heart rate will actually keep climbing for a couple minutes after I stand, and then will usually sustain around 120-130 bpm (but has climbed and sustained in the 140s-150s). It drops to around 100 if I start walking around. Standing in line waiting for things makes me really lightheaded.

As another commenter said, if you have symptoms that you want treated, it really helps to keep careful track of them over a period of time and use the data to show what you are talking about. It doesn't sound to me like you have POTS specifically."

soapmaking,ff46wd2,t3_erk5ai,1579556854.0,"Are you looking for basic tutorials about how to make soap from oils and lye, how to incorporate beeswax \*into\* soap recipes, or just how to add beeswax to any old kind of soap?

Beeswax adds hardness to a soap but not much lather, and not all of the wax will be converted to soap, so you can't make a bar of soap that has a high percentage of beeswax.

Brambleberry and Soap Queen have good tutorials for how to make cold process soap from oils and lye. The Spruce Crafts has a good [recipe](https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/beeswax-and-honey-soap-recipe-517166) for beeswax & honey soap, with a lot of commentary about the effect of adding beeswax to soap. But if you just want to put some beeswax in some soap to add another product to your bees' line, and you don't care too much about the soap making process, you might want to just add some beeswax to some melt & pour.

Edit: I looked into adding beeswax to melt & pour and while you can absolutely find recipes for it, professional soapers recommend against it because it can make the melt & pour soap softer and it doesn't like to combine well. So, this short cut might not be such a good idea after all."
socialjustice101,ff3g9km,t3_erfhjp,1579540426.0,"If you're questioning whether it's a good idea I'd generally err on the side of caution and say don't do it. 

If that isn't enough of an answer, here is something else to think about. One of the reasons why it can be a problem is that less-curly hair makes less-neat dreadlocks, which contributes to the perception of dreadlocks as a ""punky"" alternative/unprofessional hairstyle rather than a professional and protective hairstyle. Are you trying to look punky/alternative, or are you protecting your hair? Does your hair have enough curl to look neat in dreads, or will you be contributing to this false perception that harms black people?"

They're trying to call out social media celebrities who seem to be faking diseases (not dysautonomia specifically) for attention and encouraging their followers to go to cash-only doctors who will just prescribe whatever they want. Whether that's an issue you think really exists or not, they're definitely not aiming any ire at everyday people who do really have an illness. 

Right now they have a discussion on their front page about how prevalent dysautonomia is, pointing out that it's common and often misdiagnosed and has many forms which need different types of treatment. The OP says that they posted about prevalence because there was an influencer who was claiming that it was rare and they therefore needed a big medical team to deal with it. (And in response to that person, others were saying that a lack of specialists means that people with common forms do sometimes still have to form teams of doctors to get good treatment.) The sub isn't monolithic, but from my cursory look, the people in this subreddit don't think the illness is fake -- some of them even have dysautonomia or have family members who do. The sub is about people are taking advantage of the existence of a real illness for personal gain."

It sounds like your therapist doesn't really understand what is happening for you physiologically. Have you tried having a direct conversation about that, to try and change how the therapist-patient relationship? Maybe give them some reading material? If they don't change how they are advising you after that, it might be a good idea to try and find a different therapist, or at least a different therapist for the pots stuff if this person is good for other things.

Medical professionals are going to vary a lot. Unfortunately it can take time to find someone who is familiar with your symptoms and takes them seriously, whatever chronic condition you have. Don't give up!"

wikipedia,fdf6nvl,t1_fdf2ik2,1578354534.0,"I'm just a lay person, not an experienced wiki editor, but I imagine just having an ""alternative notability"" assessment option would do a lot. For example, someone could write a wiki page for e.g. a woman who works in artificial intelligence who is well cited but doesn't have many articles written about her and then check a box that says ""alternative notability"" which opens a text field in which they can make their argument about why she is important enough to warrant a page. I especially like this idea because it would also affect entries like the one for the creator of 3blue1brown. That channel is definitely notable enough for Wikipedia in my opinion, but it's never mentioned in the news, so the current article doesn't hit the criteria. I suspect that if we rewarded more types of notability, over time we would find more diversity in Wikipedia -- not just of colors or sexes of people but of types of achievements as well.

It might not be healthy but the reason it's not healthy is because it is the result of a wealth of traumatic experiences.

socialjustice101,fdemrul,t1_fdekt7w,1578342312.0,"So I can start to see why you were feeling rejected on these other subs. Partly I think it is a language barrier.

In circles interested in social justice, ""prejudice"" is generally used to describe disliking someone based on their skin color, religion, sex, sexuality, etc. When you combine a prejudice with systemic power, you get a system of benefits that warrants the ""-ism"" suffix. So for example, Black people can absolutely be prejudiced against white people. I am white and grew up in a majority black city in a mixed neighborhood. I encountered a lot of prejudice from Black folks who were not happy that I was there. But the people who were prejudiced against me didn't have systemic power: they were not police officers, or my teachers, or in any way able to influence any part of my life outside of the small interaction we were having just then on the street or in their shop. In contrast, the people who were prejudiced against them absolutely did. So I experienced prejudice and they experienced racism.

""White fragility"" is a term that was coined by a white woman (Robin DiAngelo) to describe what is happening when white people feel uncomfortable talking about race, and their own race in particular. It isn't racist or, I would argue, even inherently prejudiced, by these definitions. It might be used by someone with prejudice in a hurtful or hateful way, but that is different."

Tl;dr: They say that this scientist probably should have had a page before winning the Nobel based on how notable she was within academia, but scientists in general and women scientists in particular are not covered well by lay media and therefore Wikipedia's notability criteria fall short when assessing them. Furthermore, only one person tried (and didn't try very hard) to write a page for her.

Edit: Also, for what it's worth, I just looked up Donna and one of her co-winners, and even though she's 15 years younger than he is, she's listed as having 6 awards and he's listed as having 8. So I'd say she's doing pretty well and comparatively better than that guy."

socialjustice101,fc8ux34,t3_egq0cb,1577542396.0,"Well, I can only answer for myself, but here goes.

1. I care because I see the effects. I have close friends who are members of marginalized groups and I can see how things in our daily lives affect them. Even when they don't say anything, I can see it on their faces, and it breaks my heart because I love them and I want them to have a good life. More generally, I've heard that learning about social justice is like learning to drive. Before you knew the rules of the road, you could just be in the car with your parents without a care in the world. After you learn to drive, you notice all the ways in which your (e.g.) father is a horrible driver and barely avoiding accidents every day. You can't turn the awareness off. I find this to be true as well.

2. Of course not. I don't support ""us or them"" mentalities. There is always a reason for every right-wing policy, even if that reason is fear.

3. I want the society I live in to give everyone a fair chance at life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. I want everyone to be able to take risks knowing that if their business idea doesn't work out, or they get sick, or they have to take time off to care for a family member, they won't lose their home, their food security, or even their chance to have a career in their field. Basically I want to improve the safety and security of my fellow humans.

4. Yes.
