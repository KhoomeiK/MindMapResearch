MercyMains,ff5j8gx,t3_erpg6w,1579595428.0,"why’s this a rant lol? this isn’t bad imo. i always thought it looked cool and magical, almost angelic (she is an angel after all...)"
AskReddit,fewl91g,t3_eqies2,1579413389.0,"this happened to a friend a few weeks ago:

my friend has a betta fish that she takes care of well, feeds everyday & is in a big enough tank. one day my friend goes to feed her fish and it had literally disappeared. it was the only fish in the tank. there was no dead body and she cleaned out the whole tank to check. it didn’t jump out because there’s a lid on the top. she asked everyone in her family if they knew what happened but nobody did. nobody had touched it, and i doubt they’re lying because her family all get along & would never take or kill a fish. 

i’ve looked up what might’ve happened because i was super curious as to what happened! but i got no real answer other than “it jumped out” or “it died,” neither of which happened. still kinda weirds me out."

Building a Catio is a smart idea if you ever end up adopting another kitty. Much love <3"
AskVet,fdz3wsb,t3_e6ixd3,1578786363.0,"based on the fact that she’s 15 years old, has mostly been indoor, and has been declawed, i would strongly recommend keeping her inside. she’s older, less agile, and has no way of defending herself. plus, her lack of experience outside. maybe take her on walks? there are cat leashes you could buy.

edit: maybe let her in your backyard with supervision? although, this depends on your fence. if it’s low, maybe be more careful. if it’s higher, it’s probably ok, but still be careful and don’t let her jump over the fence!"

do you live in the US or UK? I’ve keep seeing it’s different for indoor/outdoor cats in the US vs UK/europe."

cats,fdygtdt,t1_fdur9am,1578779601.0,"Thank you! Someone said it! My 3 cats cannot he kept inside, so it’s very frustrating when someone says “just make them indoor cats”. it’s pretty much impossible for me & my cats. plus, they’re much happier outside."
cats,fdyfwta,t1_fdwy8h9,1578779380.0,"this happened to my cat, Leo! he’s a very friendly indoor/outdoor cat, and this other man had lost his cat that looked just like Leo, so he took him in. a week or two later, after searching for him practically every day, the vet called saying this other man brought him in. it was sad to hear the man’s story, but i was happy to get Leo back :)"
