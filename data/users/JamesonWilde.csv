Ah, dude. I feel you hard on that one. We were a military family, and even though my Dad got his Masters and the government always provided well for us, money was still tight and my Dad was older as well. His parents had been teens during the Depression so that shaped how they raised him as well. Which, in turn, trickled down to my sister and I. I'm definitely grateful for the childhood he and my mom gave to my sister and I, but (as you know) teenage me did not want to hear that I didn't need whatever the latest thing was. Haha.


At least you were finally able to convince them to get rid of it! I'm sure that once they did they realized how little they actually used it.
