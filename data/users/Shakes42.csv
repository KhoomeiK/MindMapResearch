JoeRogan,ff6pcro,t3_erpuo0,1579632081.0,Lol 5 minutes in and she sez she worships the shit Gwyneth Paltrow sells. No need to continue. This is clearly a moron. She works for the New York Times? I honestly lost some respect for them just thinking someone that dumb is stumbling around the offices and not led out by security asap.

unitedkingdom,fd4p6n8,t1_fd45t8d,1578169657.0,"Yea really and amazing that you are the first person I’ve ever seen mention it. I just can’t work out how people use it to follow chats and discourse in any functioning way. 

Ok i follow people and see what they shout into the void, great. Ok so we see on Reddit reposts all the time of Some ass makes a racist tweet, some smartass comes back with a retort. We see some banter and back and forth like it makes sense. But go to twitter and find the first tweet, then try to find that reply! Nope lost in a bahjillion empty Tweets. Ok try to sort by most liked, most hated, other people i follow? Randomize?  Nope just seems to come as it comes. 

I don’t understand Twitter. Probably a button just to the side I don’t see that sorts everything and gives me options but I’m too stupid to work that out. Luckily i care little. Tho i did write this."

Even after everything i still think its best to let the dull and ignorant speak so all can see and hear for themselves what these people think. Also its been a long day and was looking forward to a laugh and never got to read what more he had to say. 

Also i think we all know at least one of the Toxic subs he came from. Anyone spending time in that sweat lodge always leave the same musty odor as they traverse the hostile(to them) lands that make up all the rest of reddit."
todayilearned,fd1tlhj,t1_fd1i5t6,1578136612.0,"Lol i thought you were being unfairly vilified for just showing jews are in all corners of society good and bad but then you talked more.  Sometimes best to shup the hell up or your dumbass leaks out.  Behold the master race.

Edit* missed a word."
oddlyspecific,f6zjm76,t1_f6zd7j4,1573317549.0,"It is not dumb, joe can be dumb but is not an idiot either, but due to Joe not challenging stupid things his guests say and loving talking about weird things like bigfoot and conspiracy theories while also getting high it is often a podcast full or retarded shit. 

The thing is if you are a balanced and informed listener it’s all in good fun and you should be able to differentiate the good info and chat from the bullshit. Unfortunately there is a whole culture of mostly toxic young dumb men that just do not have this and end up taking it all in like words from the gods and as Joe loves to talk to anyone with a different take on things you end up with a cult of idiots using kettlebels and drinking kambucha and talking about gobekli tepe like they know better than life long historians. 

I love JRE but it is like Rick and Morty or Tool. I love the art but it seems to produce a toxic and retarded fan base."
