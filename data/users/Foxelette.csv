He doesn’t think she’s mature, smart or important enough to share finances with (like, can you ever see him asking her to sit down and go over their budget or something, unless it’s just him telling her what *her* shopping budget is?). He’s basically her father in that he will making ALL the decisions for her and it won’t even cross his mind to include his WIFE these things. I don’t know if I’m explaining this right... basically, you can imagine him and his ex wife sitting down and discussing their mortgage payment, or whether they should refinance their cars to save money or whatever, right? He clearly has no intention of doing that ever with his new wife because he views her like a child who couldn’t possibly understand or have anything meaningful to contribute."

shittyaquariums,fdybxjg,t1_fdw6my2,1578778125.0,"There are also hundreds of videos of young people from poor Asian countries “fishing” for animals using mentos and coke, or just coke, or some other bullshit. Basically, they dig a big hole, stuff a terrified animal inside, and then douse the hole with coke until said terrified animal tries to flee from the hole. Post on YouTube and pretend they just came across a hole and there happened to be an animal inside. Started with things like catfish, crabs and turtles but they’ve also moved on to puppies, cats, rabbits, rats, snakes, baby crocodiles etc. There’s a channel called “technique tools” where some videos have over 13 million views. That’s a LOT of Adsense to these people, more money than some of them would have expected to see in their whole lifetime. Remember, these are dirt poor kids in often third world countries who’ve figured out that they can make a shit ton of money online by abusing animals. They could give a shit about the animals in their videos. I’ve heard in some cases the animals are slaughtered after the video, because they’re of no more use to the channel owner who would have to care for them if they kept them. The worst part is YouTube does NOTHING, not even demonetize them. Just search “coke fishing” on YouTube and thousands of results pop up, each video more disturbing than the last. It’s sad that there are people so naive, gullible or indifferent that they would even give these sick fucks any views"

ChoosingBeggars,fds6bri,t1_fdr8j45,1578695341.0,"Im a stripper. When I lived back home, the club I worked in was close to another city (one province over) that was notorious for their very cheap lap dances. My dances are $40 a song at this club, and the dances at the other club are $5 a song. HOWEVER - my club is full of only the best of the best dancers, nearly all of whom are ex athletes (dance, gymnastics, etc) who put on a PHENOMENAL show, where as the other club hires any girl who walks in the door. My club hires only girls they think are attractive enough to fit in with the club, the other club hires any girl who walks in the door (overweight, covered in stretch marks and track marks and missing your front teeth? They’ll take ya!). My club is in a nice part of town, the other club is in a VERY rough part of town.

Nearly EVERY shift I had this conversation:


-Lets go for a dance 

-OK, it’s $40 a song just so you know 

-WHAT?? It’s $5 a song at *other club*

-Great! Go to *other club* then. 

-no way!! *other club* is ghetto/dangerous/doesn’t have attractive dancers/doesn’t have talented dancers/is always dirty/etc etc



So basically, you want me to be as cheap as my much less talented and attractive competition who also make you feel unsafe and dirty while you’re there? *looks around my stunning high end club* nah. I’ll pass."

aww,fdlejid,t1_fdlbmt3,1578522326.0,"When I overdosed, I had about $600 worth of heroin stuffed in my bra (that the people who took me to the ER didn’t know about, else they would have taken it as junkies themselves) and the doctors took it when they cut open my dress and bra to get to my chest I assume to do compressions and paddles and shit, but didn’t call the police. The conversation basically went as follows (keep in mind i was a VERY sick woman suffering with a crippling addiction, so yeah, my priorities were out of whack):

Doctor: Miss, we need to tell you something very serious. Do you understand what happened here today? You died on this table. You remained dead for 4 minutes before you were revived. 


Me: why the fuck are my brand new dress and bra destroyed and where is my dope?


Doctor: ..... miss, did you hear what I just said? We have resources available to help you


Me: I’ll just take my dope and leave, thanks 


Doctor: Listen, I’m not giving it back. It’s been destroyed. You’re not in trouble, but you’re a young girl, attending a good school, and I don’t want to see you throw it away 


Me: *yells to my boyfriend that I’m ready to leave now* 


So, yeah, by and large, medical staff just want to help. The doctor wasn’t even thinking about getting me in trouble for the drugs, he was *genuinely* looking at me and wondering how a girl like me got myself into such a situation and how he could help. Also it’s important to note that as stupid as the junkie boyfriend who got me hooked on drugs was, he DID tell the doctors I’d overdosed on heroin when he took me in. He said he never hesitated to say anything because my *life* was on the line (and yeah, it REALLY REALLY was). Bottom line: don’t be stupid. Just tell medical professionals what you, your friend or your pets took. It could be life or death.

Sorry for the mini rant ahahaha but your girl is so pretty, I’ve always wanted one!"
BigCatGifs,fdf51k1,t1_fdf1fm1,1578353471.0,"Try explaining that to some of the people on r/exoticpets. I spent an hour one time desperately trying to talk a guy out of buying a tiger from “a woman down the road some” that he intended to keep in a small fenced off area on his backyard somewhere in the US Midwest because “his daughter really wants one”. As desperately as I tried to explain that the animal was CLEARLY a result of illegal poaching, would never be happy, and was a danger to everyone in his family and everyone nearby (by no fault of the animal) if something went wrong. He was not dissuaded. 

Other highlights include people who CONSTANTLY ask about adopting red foxes (who I LOVE, but aren’t suitable pets in 99 percent of cases) and occasionally things like HYENAS, pumas, etc.

People on that sub DO NOT understand that exotic pet does not equal “wild animal that I think is cool and therefore want” and true exotics enthusiasts deeply DEEPLY believe in getting animals RESPONSIBLY and that some animals should ONLY be kept as pets in EXTREME situations and ONLY by someone with a reasonable background in animal care (and no, having owned a lot of “typical” pets doesn’t count. We’re talking people with zoology degrees, a background in animal medicine, people who’ve worked in rescues, etc). 

In short it’s fucked up how many people convince themselves they are absolutely the right person to care for a tiger/fox/etc even when that’s objectively not true, and also who seem to not give a shit whether the animal was illegally poached, illegally bred etc."
