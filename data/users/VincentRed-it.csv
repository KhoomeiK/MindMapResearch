college,fdgforc,t3_ecinnh,1578394665.0,"so im a first year freshman in college in my first semester and i have been sort of average. the experience i got from my college experience threw me on a loop for some reason and i couldnt focus enough to study. now my grades are being released one by one by my professors and i got average grades from some of the subjects (2.00/4.00) and i have a 1.00 from a subject i have absolutely hard time studying on (psychology) and no word from the other grades. i feel more and more nervous for my other subjects because i felt i didnt put enough effort on my part to get higher marks, i got that and im afraid the others will be lower too. i promised myself i would get honors at least just once but i feel that the way this is going, im going to flunk out of class. what should i do?"
