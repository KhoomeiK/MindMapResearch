AskReddit,ffiy4d2,t1_ffin3mc,1579985573.0,"I actually thought her acting was pretty good, and I had dirt low expectations. I found the character pretty convincing,  definitely a highlight of the show."
AskReddit,ffixwyz,t1_ffiopyl,1579985424.0,"I hate it too, but I heard a justification I thought was fair enough.  A lot of people who watch dramas set in high school want a ""high school fantasy"" where they can relive the glory days, and everyone is hot, buff, and legal. They want to fantasize,  and no one wants the painful reminder that high school students are pimply, awkward, still have baby fat, and many haven't even hit puberty yet."
washingtondc,ffa58ql,t1_ff8vpnz,1579728135.0,"A personal favorite: those who walk really slowly, but in the middle so you can't pass them. Like, because their feet are sort of moving they are entitled to both lanes."
FinalFantasyVII,fen1jce,t1_felq2l3,1579274896.0,"That's true, but that doesn't really change the fact that she's officially Aeris in the original game since you'd have to cheat to see anything else!"
FinalFantasyVII,fen1gp6,t1_fem8hz3,1579274847.0,"What s/he means is that characters have a programmed name before you hit the character name screen. For instance ,  Cloud's pre-name is ""EXSoldier"", which is why in the first battle right after the intro, you see this name during the fight instead of ""Cloud"". Once you get to the name screen, the name Cloud will be listed as the default,  which you can either accept or name him something else. If you were to cheat and bypass the naming screen, he'd continue to be ""Ex soldier"". 

It's the same with Aeris. Except you'll never in normal gameplay see that her pre-programmed name was ""Aerith"" since you hit the name screen right after meeting her. Her naming screen will always say ""Aeris"" by default. But if you were to cheat and somehow bypass this, the pre-programmed name would pop up in the character select and battle screen instead. 

If I recall correctly, several characters have different names this way, or at least alternate spellings. I heard Barret's name is spelled Barrett for instance."
FinalFantasyVII,felhxfq,t1_fekjpxy,1579222585.0,The player must've deliberately renamed Aeris to Aerith. She's Aeris in absolutely every English version of the game. Aeris sounds better so I don't know why you'd rename her but whatever haha..
AskReddit,fe2gnzw,t1_fe250oz,1578838132.0,"Why isn't the 5'2 fat balding janitor asking out 5'2 fat balding women? Seriously, ugly ""nice guys"" complain girls are shallow and only care about looks but they also only have their eyes on models. Ask out girls closer to your own level of physical attractiveness."
FinalFantasyVII,fdpf6hu,t1_fdpdy9n,1578627051.0,"Like.. the whole entire game? Remember how she led Cloud around in Wallmarket, navigating easily around brothels, convincing Cloud to dress up like a hooker, and then threatens to, quote, ""rip off"" Don Corneo's balls if he doesn't reveal Shinra's plans? Not to mention trapiezing around Cloud and Tifa's awkwardness in an actual sex dungeon for the lols.

She's constantly flirting with and teasing Cloud and the others. When in the world did Aeris ever act ""innocent"" or naive? She's insecure about her Cetra heritage but literally nothing else. She was independent and confident, and would go off to do whatever she wanted, whenever she wanted - up until her very death when she split from the party."
FinalFantasyVII,fdob9w1,t3_emd35m,1578602076.0,"She could do a solid Aeris cosplay, though isn't what I picture when I imagine a real life Aeris. Then again,  Aeris's remake design doesn't feel like Aeris to me either."
FinalFantasyVII,fdoazg7,t1_fdnwsaf,1578601935.0,Aeris is almost never serious in the game... she's super sassy and outgoing.
FinalFantasyVII,fdoavhu,t1_fdny2an,1578601881.0,"I thought the same! I know original Aeris is basically an anime  character,  but something about her new design just doesn't look right to me. Her features are rounder."
aww,fdnye76,t1_fdnh6n8,1578595368.0,"Lol I'm from Minnesota,  anything *above* 70 and I complain about it being too hot."
aww,fdebmhk,t1_fdeae1s,1578335474.0,"Interesting! This inspired me to google the differences between Maine Coons and Norwegian Forest Cats... and even though the explanations make sense textually,  it's impossible for me to actually tell the difference when trying to apply those rules to real life cats, haha. As far as I can assume, my little dude could have either in his ancestry. But his sweet personality could have just as soon come from his domestic short-hair mom, who apparently has been the biggest sweetheart since being rescued! It'll be interesting to see how big he gets, he's already larger than her."
aww,fde91o4,t1_fde6vgk,1578333844.0,"So far,  that describes him perfectly! He's so sweet and affectionate. I don't know about his heritage,  though the shelter guessed some Norwegian Forest Cat ancestry. Doesn't really matter to me, he's stolen my heart regardless!!"
aww,fde002w,t1_fddmikd,1578328066.0,"I've fostered probably 30 cats in the past few years.  A number of them don't care about food at all - my last foster had to be coaxed to eat. But she wanted to be by me at all times,  snuggling, being pet, purring... ridiculous to think she had any ulterior motives when nothing made her happier than being near me."
FinalFantasyVII,fddzqir,t1_fddsoov,1578327886.0,"Same! I feel like a jerk, just can't do it."
aww,fdcs51k,t1_fd9njs7,1578282743.0,"My most recent foster cat came to me at 18 years old! You'd never guess it, she was fairly active and extraordinarily affectionate.  She really needed lots of love and attention,  and would wake me up in the middle of the night by ""petting"" my face with her paw so I'd pet her,  too.  She's with another foster now since my schedule got too busy,  but I think of her every day hoping to hear someone out there will give her a chance and adopt. All she wants is to be loved and she deserves to live the rest of her years at a real home. Bless those folks who adopt senior cats!"
aww,fcvew3v,t1_fcv3d94,1578000647.0,"Could be a Norwegian Forest Cat, too?"
BananaFish,fcn3ke8,t3_ehpkoj,1577802299.0,"I think it's pretty obvious that's how we're supposed to interpret the ending. But that doesn't mean people have to like it, or that it was a satisfying way to end the series. 

For me, it's a disappointing and unsatisfying conclusion,  and I actually like tragedies if they fit the story. But after seeing Ash suffer the entire story,  you want him to catch a break at the end.  Not to mention, the whole emotional narrative is Eiji teaching Ash his life has value and there's someone who loves him. So it's weirdly disjointed that these lessons are disregarded in the end, and Ash sacrifices himself to ""save"" Eiji - something he was willing to do since like episode 2, so there's no growth. 

I don't hate the ending if it leaves a modicum of ambiguity like in the anime, though it still feels lacking as a real conclusion - but it sure is visually striking, so it's hard to hate too much."
FinalFantasyVII,fclq3fj,t3_ehrs2u,1577753727.0,Aeris looks awesome.  Wish Tifa had her red eyes but it looks like they went for the Advent Children look.
deathnote,fcg9wwh,t1_fc5vhqb,1577637941.0,"Rem, the female Shinigami who literally fell in love with Misa and sacrificed her life for her?

Why in the world do you think she's straight?"
deathnote,fcg9oxo,t1_fc4pbay,1577637873.0,"Lol what.  Where is your evidence that all the characters are straight? Light, who hates women and specifically only uses them, and only gets annoyed when they try to seduce him - you think he's *straight*? Dude,  gay and bisexual people exist no matter how much that bothers you personally."
AskReddit,fb2pnke,t1_fb1wre0,1576455386.0,"This reeks of incel, honestly. This weird fantasy where all women are hot or, if they're ugly, that means at least Hollywood plain. Get to know women who actually aren't conventionally attractive - fat, bad skin, stringy hair, rough faces,  and shy,  whatever - and ask them about the flocks of Nice Guys(tm) just trying to marry them."
