DestinyMemes,fd5qd4f,t3_ejzvqf,1578180298.0,"Sometimes (not all the time and not for everyone) there people who wish to learn and experience a raid firsthand. For example, a person learning the last wish raid first hand will still be surprised and see the awe of Riven after dropping down the hole where if they watched a video, they already know what’s going to happen. While a video or website will teach someone the raid, it will also show spoilers. This is a situation that I have encountered before. Some people just prefer to see it first hand. But they should only do so if they join a group that says they are willing to teach or make their own post stating that they need to be taught."

Now maybe they don’t have to drop pinnacle gear multiple time a week but then it could be replaced by still providing powerful rewards after each encounter completion."
