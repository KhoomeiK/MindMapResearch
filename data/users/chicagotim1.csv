It's certainly not the healthiest thing in the world, but I actually find 16/8 fasting to be pretty easy when you routinely consume \~1000 calories a night.

It was the first of the 6 movies to come after the original trilogy and I think it was destined to bear the brunt of everyone's nostalgia. Strip away impossible expectations and I think its a much better movie than people give it credit for."

options,fcz1d8i,t3_ejn2tm,1578091732.0,"No, the spread you receive is the difference between the cost of the two options at the time you traded them, NOT their strike prices. A put spread involves selling a put option out of the money and buying one deeper out of the money. Since you sold an option that's more valuable than the one you bought, you receive some money up front (your credit). From there you hope the options expire out of the money and you keep the credit as profit."
