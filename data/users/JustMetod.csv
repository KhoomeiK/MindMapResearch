videos,ffhtapr,t3_etnc0l,1579952804.0,"So this is completely unverifiable and the outfit this person is wearing looks different than the ones you see the nurses in Wuhan actually wearing.

But reddit will eat it up because China = Bad."
MorbidReality,ffht5x5,t1_fffmwsy,1579952609.0,I wonder if you would be saying the same thing if this happened in the US and you would be in the midst of widespread hysteria the media would he stirring up for profit.
MorbidReality,ffht03a,t3_etc1bl,1579952366.0,"Oh god forbid they prevent opportunistic greedy journalists from profiting of of this tragedy and spreading panic.

Its really interesting to see how pervasive the liberal capitalist mindsest is in the west."
teenagers,ffhsw7z,t3_etkdm2,1579952206.0,It really puts into perspective how out if touch some people are. On one side of the world you have thousands of people suffering and on the other priviliged little kids are making racist jokes about it.
worldnews,ffhss7a,t1_ffhdbdt,1579952044.0,And shitting on China when they are literally responding to this in the best way possible. If this happened in any other country the situation would be a lot worse.
worldnews,ffhss04,t1_ffhdbdt,1579952035.0,And shitting on China when they are literally responding to this in the best way possible. If this happened in any other country the situation would be a lot worse.
worldnews,ffhspsc,t1_ffh962a,1579951945.0,"According to you. Maybe they are just taking huge precautions to make sure it doesnt get any worse.

I really dont understand how anyone can be upset that China is cracking down hard on it. They might literally be saving thousands of live and yall are just giving them shit."
neoliberal,ffhrcge,t1_ffgilji,1579949845.0,Nah Guaido is not the legitimate president of Venezuela. I AM because I said so and apparently that is enough these days.
neoliberal,ffhr9yx,t3_etj3yg,1579949738.0,Where was all this outrage when Hillary went on Howard Stern?
neoliberal,ffhr6bx,t3_etddnp,1579949578.0,Lets just ignore the fact that all the main dem candidates asked to go on and would be doing the same.
neoliberal,ffhr4a1,t3_etddnp,1579949489.0,So what about Hillary going on Howard Stern? You know the guy that asked every female guest to ride the sybian.
politics,ffgnt7r,t1_ffgnn44,1579910577.0,I mean I cant disagree with that.
politics,ffgnjaw,t1_ffgndcc,1579910385.0,So what percentage of Rogan fans do you think will vote Bernie because of this?
politics,ffgmzwb,t3_etdpbo,1579910014.0,"You guys really need to get in touch with reality. I hate to break it to you but this wont affect the broad electorate in the slightest. 

You might get a few more ""I hate shill dems but Bernie is cool"" or ""I am not a leftist but I respect Sanders for his integrity"" youtube comments and tweets but that is all."
politics,ffgmot0,t1_fffnoa1,1579909804.0,"Sorry what? Most Rogan fans are propably apolitical or not eligible to vote. Of those that are most are propably either republican or libertarian. And the ""democrats"" watching him are almost certainly already Bernie supporters.

I sincerely doupt there is anyone that was going to vote for Biden/Warren/... in the primary but changed his minded because Joe Rogan endorsed him."
nba,ffgljo3,t1_ffgldti,1579909032.0,Because I dont understand how anyone can take a guy that is 11-34 seriously. You can say he is very talented and is exceeding expectations as a second year player but lets not get ahead of ourselfs. He is not relevant at all.
nba,ffglaah,t1_ffgl0dg,1579908855.0,"They werent 11-34 at this point of the season. And Trae is still playing with NBA players. They dont even need to be in the playoffs, just dont literally be a worthless trash team that doesnt compete if you want anyone to take your best player and leader seriously."
nba,ffgkz1d,t1_ffgjp0e,1579908641.0,I dont care if he were a 10 year vet. If your team is garbage you are irrelevant and shouldnt be starting in an all-star game.
nba,ffgkwbf,t1_ffgjl39,1579908589.0,Wait are you joking hahaha? So you have seen how his game contributes literally 0 to winning and you still think he should be an all-star starter?
nba,ffgkpaf,t3_etic9x,1579908458.0,"Because if you are 11-34 you dont matter. Like it or not basketball is still about winning games. I dont care if you are averaging 40 and the rest of your team are complete scrubs, you still dont matter if you are 11-34. 

This trend of giving players huge praise for averaging good numbers on awful teams is really weird. Like by this logic KAT is a top 10 player in the league."
nba,ffgk88t,t3_etiezu,1579908143.0,Not bad. He will be great with Luka in the pick n roll.
stupidpol,ffgjb9d,t3_etehpx,1579907544.0,"Wow I am shoked that woke people support humane treatment of prisoners, oppose zionism and acknowledge very basic economic and political facts. Nice one Ben!"
trashy,ffghoo6,t1_fffndhb,1579906470.0,Maybe just ignore it?
moviescirclejerk,ffg9t0o,t3_etak06,1579901546.0,I mean Return of the Jedi is universally considered the worst of the OG trilogy.
worldnews,ffg72uh,t3_etbwl6,1579899862.0,I dont really understand what people are upset about? Shouldnt we be glad China is cracking down on it hard so that it doesnt spread? I mean if this shit happened in India it would be game over.

stupidpol,ffetsml,t3_et4x50,1579865184.0,"Imagine if Warren or Buttigieg went on.

""Heres why Warren and Mayor Pete doing a podcast with Joe Rogan spreads the voice of marginalized peoples and helps deradicalize young Trump fans."""
