AmItheAsshole,ffjdp27,t3_etwwyi,1579996099.0,"YTA. I had to move back home at one point. Couldn't move into my old bedroom because my parents were using it as storage, as is their right in their house, so I stayed in my sister's old room. It had the nicer furniture so they decided THAT would be the guest room.   
I have disabilities too, ones that made it difficult to find employment, so I understand. However, when actual guests came to visit, I willingly and happily gave up the room I was using because that's the considerate thing to do.

The other commenters saying Windows Defender is the way to go are absolutely right. It's free and optimized to suit your operating system. 

Norton is computer death. It is constantly running, using resources and internet connection, and will destroy your hard drive through it's normal operations. If you absolutely feel like you must pay for an antivirus, I recommend Webroot. It doesn't store the database on your computer, which means no frequent updates and more space for your favorite games and pictures. Instead of being always connected to the database, like Norton is, it checks once a day and when you tell it to. It ignores unchanged files, where Norton scans everything over and over, multiple times a day. If you are using Norton, I suggest you quit and try to get as much of your money back as you can."

I actually had to switch to a super cheap brand for awhile but it ended up costing me more in the long run. They were shedding more, their waste was smellier, and they'd throw up often, which meant I was vacuuming more, cleaning litter boxes more frequently, and they were eating more to replace what they were voiding.

Frugal,ffikrqx,t3_etqf02,1579976233.0,"Shoes, all the time shoes! I buy a good, expensive pair when I get my tax returns and they last me all year.   
I like to walk. I walk recreationally. A 20 dollar pair from WalMart is fine in a pinch but I wear them out in a matter of weeks. However, a more expensive, 80-100 dollar pair of well made sneakers will last me the year, saving me money in the long run.   
A good pair of inserts is a good investment, too. They sell the 10 dollar ones, but those kind of suck, they get flat and wear out and really only seem to be good for making a cheap pair of shoes last a tiny bit longer, and I understand very well that is the only choice for a lot of people. But if you can spring for a more expensive pair, designed to suit your foot shape (or hell, see a podiatrist for custom ones if your insurance will cover it!) not only will they last longer, but they will extend the life of your shoes and make standing, walking, and life in general more comfortable. A good pair of shoes/inserts will relieve back and hip pain too."

If it's not, and they're genuinely trying to give you a break they think you need, they're just pushing different angles 'okay, if she won't do it for herself maybe she'll do it for us' but they're still pushing, which isn't cool, and should stop.   
I kept my babies super close until they were a year or older. My son (firstborn) had some overnight stays with my mom and my daughter(second born) had none at all, because I simply didn't need the help. Baby, at this age, needs mama. That's it.

AskReddit,ffcw62k,t3_espxtw,1579808526.0,"My housemate had a pretty big meltdown one day.   
I messaged all of our mutuals on FB, asking them to send a message of support. He had posted a status alluding to how he felt, so he just assumed all his friends just decided to support him. He was floored, and it really helped boost his mood for the next couple months.

I also (and I am far less proud of this) got his boss to stop emotionally fucking with him. She was engaged to be married but kept leading him on, calling him her work spouse and basically entering an emotional relationship with him. He would come home, elated because he got to go shopping for their work together, and it felt like a date. He would gush over how perfect she was and how she kept saying her relationship was unstable/she was probably going to leave him, followed by weeks of devastation after she achieved a milestone with her fiance (bought a wedding dress, bought a HOUSE). Turned out, a friend of mine had another friend who knew the boss's fiance's parents. I orchestrated her spilling the beans to them, which lead to an ultimatum and eventually the boss leaving him be and then quitting to be a stay at home wife. It crushed him, but not nearly as badly as the constant torment she put him through. He moved on and formed a relationship with someone who actually wanted to be in a relationship with him, something he wouldn't have done if his boss had still been stringing him along."

As much as it sucks to hear, smoking doesn't just affect you. It affects the environment and other people, even after that cigarette is put out. I'm not going to preach, but it does seem like a lot of smokers don't care or don't want to care that their feel-good habit really only hurts."
AskReddit,ffay7et,t3_eskc2n,1579747240.0,"Okay, I MARRIED my overweight gamer. And now we're both a lil overweight and game together.

  
And, because I never turn down an excuse to tell people how great he is...

  
We met at a job. We were both new hires in the same scuzzy call center and did our training together. The way he tells it, he had his eye on me from the moment I held the door for him. Through our training class, he was super sweet and helpful. Anything I needed help with, he made sure he was right there, guiding me through it, and I never really noticed it was him the entire time. One day they had the AC CRANKED. I was shivering and he offered to go to his house a few blocks away and get me a hoodie to borrow. I accepted, as I had no other option. So he took his lunch to get me that hoodie. I still have it, btw. The zipper is broken but I refuse to get rid of it and wear it still. 

Anyways. He sacrifices the chance to have a real lunch (half hour lunches are the worst) to make me not cold. And then he ran off at the end of the day so I couldn't return it and I had to take it home and ensure I talked to him the next day. (He confirmed that was his nefarious plan.) 

Next day comes, I wash and return his hoodie, and he tells me he's new to town and would I care to see a movie with him because he doesn't really have anyone to go with. (6 months isn't exactly new, but I bit.) So off we go to see Star Trek: Into Darkness, both of us really hoping the other thinks it's a date but not really confirming or anything. He turned it into ice cream and dinner, too, which was awesome. 

Next came the over nights. The job was from 3pm-11pm, which sucked, and he started offering to take me home so my dad would be able to go to sleep at a reasonable hour. (I was living at home after an abusive relationship left me destitute.) That turned to 'hey, let's stop by my house' which turned to us talking for hours. Weeks on end, I wasn't getting back home til 6 AM.

He still hadn't made a move or anything. He was just so sweet. He was there for me, listening to me, putting up with me. I had fallen head over heels before we even kissed. One night he broke out the drunken Mariocart, a favorite of ours. I returned from the bathroom and he says ""I'm sorry for this"" and leans over and kisses me. 

""What are you sorry for?"" Was the only thing on my mind. It was the best. We took the relationship part slow for a few months, waiting to have sex.  
May 13 will be 7 years since we met, June 1st will be 6 years married and 7 years dating (we decided, in hindsight, that Star Trek was our first date).  
TL;DR- be there for her without being overbearing, highlight the things you have in common, don't rush the intimacy, and aim for a relationship that is built on building each other up and supporting each other."
AskReddit,ff9zoby,t3_esc8vq,1579724926.0,"I'd show  her that she is worthy of love and always has been, despite the assholes who hurt her.

I'd show her it's gonna be okay, and despite what she thinks, we do make it past 18 and she shouldn't give up.

In the second house, I got my own bed and the frame was tall enough that I could fit comfortably under there. The bed skirt hid me and the room's heating vent was under there too. I spent a lot of time under there, reading or playing with little toys. 

In the third house, there was a tree in the back yard as well as an old barn/shed type deal. My sister was 'too old' for stuff like that at that point. I spent hours in the tree, making friends with birds and reading, or in the shed just dicking around and trying to 'build' stuff. There was a bunch of cool, old stuff that had been left in there by the past owner.

Weddings happen, if you're lucky, just the once. And they should be 100% what the bride and groom want.

Do you have any metal trash? Scrappers will pick that stuff up for free and you may even be able to get their help with some of the other stuff.  
I'm in a similar boat. I have several chronic conditions that make physical labor very difficult for me. I have a mountain of  organic matter in my yard from yard work that did not get completed all the way, and a storage shed full of dry trash that I was unable to toss because I lost trash service for some time.

She wanted to walk my husband down the aisle before my dad walked me down to give me away. She wanted to make my bridal jewelry, and got mad when I said no, I had other plans, because she 'just wanted to help'. She burst into tears on multiple occasions, drying up FAST when she realized no one was paying attention to her, watching the ceremony instead. She demanded she be in all the photos... thank goodness we had a good photographer who put her foot down. She even wore white.

Furthermore, you are a guest. No matter what, you are a guest. You are not the bride. You are not the groom. It is not your wedding. If your goal was to plan weddings, there is an entire career path built around doing such.   
I wouldn't say you're evil for getting her the dress, but you are insinuating that you want to be a much bigger part of this wedding than they want you to be, which is why you are hurt.   
Here is my advice. Apologize. Suggest maybe you guys get the dress anyways, and then sell it online. You still have your fun weekend, provided that is what the bride wants, and she gets money to freely spend on her wedding (provided the contest rules don't have stipulations about that!) And back down. If she wants your input in the wedding, she will ask, I promise."

I have a very similar boundary stomping MIL. The two weeks before our first was born, she posted every day or two that he was on his way when he wasn't... because I made the mistake of updating her on my frequent appointments and hospitalizations. We were not the first to deliver the news at all. She also refused to get the flu shot (had no real health reasons, said it gave her pneumonia when there is not a single documented case of that) and refused to change her jacket to hold him as a newborn (heavy, heavy smoker)
With my daughter, she attempted to emotionally manipulate us because we did not name her after MIL's miscarriage. 
Then, this fall, she told us she had stage 4 cancer and we needed to come say goodbye immediately. We dropped everything and ran, accruing debt and almost costing my husband his job, only to find out she had grossly exaggerated the severity of the illness and is cancer free after a round of chemo and removal of a lung. Still serious, but her behavior was manipulative.
This isn't everything that has happened, but a quick highlight of the nastiest bits.
