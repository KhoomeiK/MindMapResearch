AmItheAsshole,fggeol3,t1_fggbz0n,1580760293.0,Just because some people come to a conclusion you don't agree with it doesn't mean they are disconnected from reality. This is a common game for bridal showers and stag n does in my area and people use math wrong and still lose or because there's a golf ball or something inside the jar messing it up. Just because OP's family doesn't use math for it or isn't used to that way of playing the game doesn't make those that do  disconnected from reality.

I know I don't know you but I can relate to your story and when I moved out my life and self esteem changed completely. I believe that you can get to that place too, you deserve to love yourself."
todayilearned,fgg68yj,t1_fgg5amz,1580755137.0,Oh! Thank you for sharing your knowledge and saving me the Google trip I was about to take. The original sounds awesome! I will choose to ignore the reimagined version's existance. I was worried there was some real historical tale that was really tragic like Pocahontas so this is a relief.
todayilearned,fgg5kv4,t1_fgg3pbm,1580754729.0,"Ah, shit. I'd heard about Pocahontas but not Mulan. Its weird how sad that makes me. I'll go google anyways I guess."

ChoosingBeggars,fgg2okm,t1_fgg1nca,1580752951.0,I haven't been a server for several years so if that's the system then you are teaching me something new. Does this mean you don't declare anything when tipping out at the end of the day but the restaurant declares it's sales and the gov't assumes you made 8% in tips on that?
ChoosingBeggars,fgg28km,t1_fgfptvq,1580752668.0,"There's an interesting psychological concept called the Belief in a Just World. It's essentially ones tendency to believe that people get what they deserve in life and everyone could better their situation if they just tried. There is a positive correlation between one's own success in life (measured through variables such as SES, level education and profession) and their tendency to believe in a just world. This has been interpreted as a result of one's innate desire to feel like they earned the good things that happened to them and ignore/downplay the influence of luck. On the other side though of course this means one who has had a bad lot in life is statistically more likely to not believe in a just world and attribute things to chance (such as where they were born, illness) for which there is a wealth of literature. 

I'm not projecting this onto you because you are an individual I have no way of knowing. I simply mean to bring to the table one of the reasons why many people have this attitude towards people with less than ideal jobs and why it is typically associated with higher income conservatives and they have been observed to hold this perspective more often."
ChoosingBeggars,fgg14kh,t1_fgfl1p5,1580751975.0,"That's awful, at the last restaurant I worked at the server's didn't have to tip anything at all out to the kitchen and it made me mad. These two extremes show the need for a standard practice. The restaurant owners get to much leeway."
ChoosingBeggars,fgg0wqf,t1_fgfjeke,1580751844.0,Yeah but here in Canadian service staff get paid minimum wage unlike in U.S. so tips are just bonus. In the U.S. from what I've learned it seems like they rely on tips in most states to even meet minimum wage amounts which is tragic.
ChoosingBeggars,fgg0mxm,t1_fgfztn6,1580751680.0,In every restaurant and cafe I've worked in the front of house has only declared about a third of their tips on taxes and they make more than a typical retail worker after taxes (in various cities in Ontario). In my experience it's a much better job than most minimum wage positions like grocery stores and fast food (in my experience). I think we just benefited from our better labour laws and U.S. tipping standards.
femalefashionadvice,fgfsr28,t1_fget0jn,1580746782.0,"A lot of us get the idea (judging from comment chain higher up). I'm in my 20s and totally get the need to figure out what key words or staple pieces to search up in order to find the inspo I want. Perhaps some people are so Welle established in their style they forgot what it was like to be in full explore phase or they prefer to go with the flow on their style and can't get that others prefer to find inspo and styles that capture their vibe. Both are valid. You go find your intellectual style and look great, girl."
Instagramreality,fgdi4nl,t1_fgdf40s,1580682707.0,I understand what you're saying. There definitely is a cookie cutter ideal image on insta that's exactly as you described. I was moreso reacting to the comment as it seemed to imply outside of the insta bubble that her body was flawed by having no/narrow hips when that doesn't seem like something someone should be critiqued on as your bone structure is genetic. I think we are on the same page and I agree with you but I just interpreted the original comment differently.
Embroidery,fgd8d8t,t1_fgd7pus,1580679931.0,Makes perfect sense! I would have never thought of using interfacing to provide structure for a piece on stretchy fabric and had been impressed right away by how nice your fabric looked. Nice!!

brocku,ffxyf0t,t3_evrlyy,1580334873.0,I went here because of the unique blended focus on undergrad experience and research/academia (usually big schools focus on research and small school focus on experience but Brock is mid-sized) and the pretty campus. No regrets.

nextfuckinglevel,ffiwz5i,t1_ffiompx,1579984745.0,"Exactly! It takes advantage of the fact that we process faces holistically (with low spatial frequency) unless they are upside down. 
Flipping the reference photo over allows us to focus on the lines and shapes of the image accurately while correcting for our tendency to allow our interpretation of the face to influence our rendition."
nextfuckinglevel,ffiwh8q,t1_ffiv9x6,1579984388.0,"Yeah it is easier, especially with faces which are known for being quite difficult to do. The psychological phenomenon behind this is our tendency to process faces holistically (as a single unit) as opposed to systematically (looking at eyes, then nose, then jaw). This is an adaptive skill developed since we all need to be experts at quickly identifying faces. 

As a result of this, when drawing a face, we have trouble when it comes to breaking the face down into components or shapes/lines. One may focus in on the eye to produce a lovely eye but it is either out of place or doesn't perfectly resemble the subjects' shaoe/angle. 

Interestingly, scientific research has provided evidence in support of the fact than when faces are upside-down we no longer process them holistically and can instead capture individual lines and shapes. For some, this allows them to truly copy down what they see before their eyes without getting distracted by our desire to view the image as a whole without grasping the details. 

This technique commonly involves turning your reference photo upside down and drawing the lines and shapes you see so that is most likely (though I don't know for a fact) what he is using. It is also used for things other than faces but I find it's effectiveness particularly interesting given the empirical evidence that supports its effectiveness."
Embroidery,feynwuy,t3_eqv9e5,1579448084.0,"This is stunning! I love how you followed the brush/pallett knife strokes of the original with your thread. It really gives the whole piece a pleasing effect on the eye. It can be hard to take an image original on a rectangular canvas and give it a nice composition in a circular frame! Don't sell yourself short, this is a wonderful work of art and you are talented. I'm so happy you've found such a beautiful creative outlet for your anxiety and I hope it helps calm your soul."
MurderedByWords,fe5nkej,t1_fe54i3w,1578871845.0,"That's your perogative and I'm not going to call you a nazi for it. I understand the emotional drive to protect and grow America's economy. A different opinion is that trumps  rhetoric and policies inflate the Economy in an unsustainable way given that the rise in market value hasn't actually reflected a rise in quality of life for the lower middle class and the poor who make up the vast majority of America's population so increased spending isn't viable. Another opinion is that morally, Trumps actions and attitudes have soured global relations and ruined America's reputation and the trade war with China and American tax payers footing the tarrif bill is just one example of how his lack of political intelligence will affect the country. Another opinion is that who he is an a person is an embarrassment to the country.  There are a lot of opinions (on both sides, I know) and I wouldn't call you a nazi for yours so please don't assume the worst in those who don't share your opinion."
MurderedByWords,fe46qh0,t1_fe3f1bw,1578856282.0,That's ludacris.  The vast majority of rational people aren't calling Trump supporters Nazis their calling them ignorant and blinded by bias.

MurderedByWords,fe44v5a,t1_fe3uit7,1578855790.0,"The standard here is to refer to the west coast what's along the western edge down to the border so all of BC including that which borders the states would be referred to as the west. Meanwhile the same applies to the east, so even though Nova Scotia is just as low as Ontario its refered to as part of the east coast. Im from southern Ontario (where the vast majority of the population of Canada is clustered) and we refer to the north as northern Ontario and up. I guess we don't see moose or whales so ... we are the south? Haha"

Food is good, new restaurants opening up all the time downtown. Not as much variety as Hamilton though. Bussing is the same. Rent is usually a bit cheaper. Gas is cheaper. Groceries as same I think (I don't pay enough attention when I shop). Ive lived in both and have friends at both and like them equally tbh."
