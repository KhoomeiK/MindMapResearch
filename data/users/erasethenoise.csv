pokemon,ffb332i,t1_ffas1ss,1579750549.0,Shit got complex during gen 4 or 5. I’ve got the basics drilled into my head but I run into a steel or fairy type and I get totally lost.

I mean, you’ve resorted to name calling what like 6 times now already?"
videos,ff90l5t,t1_ff902fs,1579701788.0,You know nothing and seem very desperate for some type of validation on why this game is somehow good now.
videos,ff8sloo,t1_ff86gjd,1579694490.0,Yes my opinion must not be valid because it’s a popular one. I’d love to know your stance on water being wet and the sky being blue.
NintendoSwitchDeals,ff82zd7,t1_ff82bwr,1579664620.0,The $10 reward will show up in your account after you get the game. I just looked at the terms at the bottom of the page [here](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/my-best-buy-offers/my-best-buy-gaming-offers/pcmcat308100050002.c?id=pcmcat308100050002) and it’s 15-20 days after street date.
Frugal,ff7zcyr,t3_es1ziy,1579661992.0,"Literally same situation for me with Comcast a few years ago. Like exact same prices. I just called and said I didn’t want to pay that much and if that’s the best they could do I would be cancelling. The lady on the phone was very nice about it (the key is to just be polite and stick to you just can’t/don’t want to pay that much) and while she wasn’t able to get me back to $50 she had a different promo she was able to put me on for $65. 

YMMV but best you can do is ask."
NintendoSwitchDeals,ff7ykbf,t1_ff7sljc,1579661432.0,You won’t get it until after the game comes out. Think they make you wait 30 days and then it’s added to your account.
NintendoSwitchDeals,ff7yi6e,t1_ff7uauq,1579661390.0,May not be convenient for you but I always do in store pickup with Best Buy and that way I don’t have to worry about screw ups with delivery companies or something shipping late.
videos,ff7s2m6,t1_ff7rq1m,1579656986.0,"lol love the bold. Yeah that’s pretty low especially looking at some of the games that rank above it. I mean Ark? Really? 

Sticking within the genre though it’s basically last place compared to all of the other multiplayer shooters on the list. I guess it beat Battlefield V though but, well, you know."
personalfinance,ff7rp1b,t1_ff6wqpy,1579656729.0,"Not only did they take all of our info and were careless with it, but there was virtually no consent involved on our side as consumers. Like if you want to exist in society Equifax is basically going to need access to your personal information."
personalfinance,ff7rlba,t1_ff73z3y,1579656658.0,There’s more stuff to claim if you’ve spent money or time recovering from identity theft. You’re probably eligible for more.
videos,ff7odsg,t1_ff7ni15,1579654406.0,Happy for you man. I mean I did do research that’s how I knew it was so far down on Xbox’s list. But it’s cool I’m glad you’ve got good evidence for why your choices are justified.
videos,ff7lqs3,t1_ff7ll2g,1579652566.0,"I’m typing calmly buddy no tantrum here. Just speaking facts about the terrible practices in this industry and the companies that perpetuate them. 

Still waiting on a link to this top downloads list."
videos,ff7l9bg,t1_ff7jse0,1579652229.0,"Now you’ve got me curious where does this supposed top downloads list reside? I can see on Xbox it’s less popular than basically every other shooter out there including Destiny, Black Ops 4, Overwatch, and even PUBG. I’m sure it’s a “top download” on Origin but you do realize that doesn’t mean anything at all right? That’s like basing Overwatch’s popularity on it being a top download on the Blizzard store. 

My argument is based on history, and pretty recent history at that. EA and DICE have put more effort in the last 5 years into bleeding their fan base dry than putting out an actual quality game. It was only when shit hit the fan in a major way for them and they were at risk of losing the biggest IP they had that they decided to dial back their shitty behavior just enough so the typical rube would feel they’d been listened to. 

You can keep defending the game all you want but the Battlefront 2 fiasco was only second to the No Mans Sky clusterfuck and anyone that’s paying attention would know not to even bother with anything DICE decides to shit out."
funny,ff7jtwm,t1_ff7492n,1579651239.0,If you wanna get high tech with it they make bowls that will only open for a specific cat. Not sure how expensive they are but could save you in the long run when the chubby ones heart doesn’t have to explode.

pokemon,ff67q92,t1_ff4e0i7,1579621120.0,"I’m only just now making my way through Shield and I find Team Yell more interesting the more I think about them. 

>!When their full motivation/origin is revealed it makes a lot more sense why this random girl had such a following. Also, in a region where the entire culture revolves around the Champions Cup what better villains than a bunch of fans trying to get their favored trainer an advantage in an unsportsmanlike way. I am conflicted though because even though I dislike the idea of 10 year olds taking down organized crime rings I feel like the main plot of the story is zooming by with only the mild inconveniences Team Yell provide and found myself missing the parts like exploring the Power Plant or Silph building and busting heads.!<"

NintendoSwitch,ff3kygt,t1_ff1z87y,1579543260.0,Microsoft did make the entire thing open source though and publicly encouraged anyone else to make it work with their platforms. Nintendo and Sony could develop their own branded versions if they wanted to.

AskReddit,ff0q0sk,t1_ff0964b,1579471229.0,"You can def rent like a days inn room or something at 18 but I remember at like 22 we all needed someone’s mom to make the reservation for a beach house in the outer banks because whoever signed the agreement needed to be over 25. She didn’t come with us and I remember we were all nervous if the rental agency would find out but no one ever bothered to check. 

Weird rule but I think it may be a private policy for those types of businesses and not an actual law."
AskReddit,ff0l0g6,t1_ff07e1t,1579469813.0,If this is the play I’m gonna walk in and start managing. Or actually just go to a few stores in the area and start checking inventory and tracking sales numbers. I’ll be regional manager by weeks end.

NintendoSwitch,feo2n58,t1_fenymsv,1579294246.0,I’ll probably share your sentiment. Some of my favorite memories from the games are the caves or team rocket hideouts. We’ll see though.
raidsecrets,fenxc6t,t1_fenmf8p,1579292165.0,"I actually like puzzles and your first statement is exactly why I don’t really care for this one. By the time I was home from work on the second day the whole thing became another “submit your stuff so us streamers can figure it out”. 

The large scale puzzles are attention grabbing but I would rather them scale this stuff down so that solutions only requires a team of 3 and some time/puzzle solving skills."

nintendo,fejyj9o,t3_epjsqp,1579188758.0,Really thought it would be something super epic and unexpected after the whole “hardly anyone at Nintendo even knows about this” intro. Then they announce a new Three Houses DLC like 15 min after this and the whole thing seems like a set up.
