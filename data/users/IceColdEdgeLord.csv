NarutoShinobiStriker,ff670dr,t1_ff5ijs4,1579620639.0,"Jesus this sounds like the next storyline of the anime lol. I mean I used to Roleplay when I was younger, and I do it sometimes when I’m bored and with friends. But damn this is taking things to a WHOLE new level. 

My small group of four does a family roleplay, but we just pretend to be 3 Uchiha brothers with our rogue ninja friend who rolls with us"
NarutoShinobiStriker,ff66nw3,t1_ff66f00,1579620412.0,"Shikamaru should’ve been a ranged type for shadow stitching, but in the anime itself he did have some healing moments so I guess I could see why they would make him a healer. Even though he does fit better as ranged.

As for Ino, I never bothered to buy her pack. She has mind transfer jutsu but in the case of combat it’s just not useful. It’s a beneficial jutsu in the anime for comedic reasons or strategic reasons. The best use you’ll get out of it is the healer paralyzing enemies for the attack and ranged types to get a better target for attacking"
NarutoShinobiStriker,ff6687g,t1_ff663g8,1579620117.0,"Sakura is Tsunade’s student so I get why her abilities would be similar to hers, but yeah it is kind of boring not making Sakura’s more unique. 

As for Hinata and Shikamaru, those healers are actually powerful and cool to use."
NarutoShinobiStriker,ff65x25,t1_ff65td9,1579619907.0,Yeah my friends and I think her jutsu is pretty over powered honestly. But the healer for our squad loves to use it and it helps the rest of us keep from dying in boss fights. It also helps for my friends and I to recharge our attack and ranged jutsus
NarutoShinobiStriker,ff65nll,t3_erv7jd,1579619723.0,"You can recharge your jutsu faster by holding down the bumper your jutsu is set to

You can also have a teammate use Sarada’s healing circle to recharge your jutsu faster as well in PvP or team combat"

It sounds like he is looking more for a side girl to fool around with behind his girlfriend’s back rather than a friend. Dropping contact is smart, he sounds like a jerk"

And the rules we tell you before you enter the park include “do not climb on the pads” which the young girl was doing. Not saying the park isn’t at fault, just saying that the area she was at is supposed to be restricted. The place she fell through is where staff like me go when we need to re-spring the trampolines and stuff like that.

But we’re trying to find a way to seal the net to the wall to keep kids from pushing on it and making a gap like that again. But I agree we should’ve done that in the first place. I’m just glad the girl is okay"

redditoryt,fe6ido9,t3_envs0e,1578891852.0,"When I was younger, my parents had gone through a nasty divorce. My dad was extremely entitled and still is to this day. He likes to think the world revolves around him and he can get anything he wants with the right manipulation. And I got to give him credit on his skills to manipulate.

And manipulate he did, as when he moved out he had stolen my dog from me in order to get me to visit him for visitations. He knew I’d go where my dog goes, since I loved her more than life itself.

My dad had no care for the dog though, always fed her table food, never walked her, even HIT her whenever she misbehaved!

Because of this she was very frightened and aggressive with everyone except me. Since I had raised her and trained her our bond was very strong. It sounds cheesy but I even felt I could read her mind  and know exactly what she wanted.

Anyway, one night I had noticed a bumpy rash on my dog’s nose and ears. I had asked my father about it and he said she had gotten into some poison ivy and he had taken her to the vet. Looking back I should’ve known he was lying but like I said, master manipulator.

Later that night, the rash got worse and I knew it wasn’t poison ivy. I called my mom and she agreed to help me smuggle the dog out to the vet. First thing the next morning we did just that. She picked me up and we drove to the vet we went to for my previous dogs (R.I.P Prue and Junie you’re forever missed). 

I explained to the vet the situation and asked if there was something she possibly overlooked. She looked at me confused, explaining that my father never brought my dog into the vet. 

As she looked my dog over, she told me the blood circulation to my dog’s ears and nose had been cut off. And that if I had brought her in even three days later her ears would’ve most likely died and fallen off due to lack of blood flow. I. was. p*****!

I called my dad and screamed at him in a way I never thought I could. Calling him all sorts of profanities and saying he was not only an animal abuser, but a child abuser as well. It wasn’t until I hung up that I realized my mistake.

When my mother and I got home (to my house not my father’s) my father’s truck skids in front of our driveway blocking us from leaving. My father said “If you don’t give the dog back I’ll call the police!” To which I responded “if you call the police I’ll never forgive you!” And ran inside with the dog.

Not long after the police arrive, and after my parents discussed the situation with them (in more of a screaming match) the police said that I needed to return the dog seeing as it was under my father’s name. At first I was confused since my mom and dad bought the dog together. 

My dad had gone to the SPCA (The Pound for my State) and had the dog legally signed over to only his name, making the dog legally his. I showed the cop the now bleeding rash on my dog’s nose (she had scratched open her scabs in the house). And my mother yelled “can’t you see he is abusing this poor animal?!” The cop actually had the nerve to tell my mother “Ma’am I am not a vet. He has the legal documentation and you are required to give the dog back”

In the end I had no choice but to give the dog back to my father. I grabbed the cream the doctor gave me for her rash to make it go away and asked if he would at least take it. But he sped away without even talking to me. 

I learned later that he had went back to the vet and bought another $75 (€67.38) worth of the ointment. I continued to visit him until I knew my dog was fully recovered.

Eventually I went no contact with him, but never got my dog back. I tried to fight for custody of the dog in court, but the judge told my mother and I that if we couldn’t come to an agreement on the dog with my father, that they would give my dog to the pound. Since she has never been in the pound before (we bought her as a newborn pup) I pulled out of the case and let my dad keep her. 

I miss her everyday and just hope she is as healthy as she can be in that environment. And I still hate that cop and judge for letting my dog stay with that animal abuser. The entire incident left black scars on my dog’s ears and nose. 

So yeah, that’s my story of how my entitled dad managed to use the legal system to steal my dog from me. [Here’s what she looks like in case anyone is curious.](https://www.instagram.com/p/BDHBgvQn_FQ/?igshid=1dm6zo140pwta)"

Especially since my co-workers and I are all so close and treat each other like family. We always hang out outside of work and we pass on that family-like kindness to our customers.

EntitledPeople,fddukm6,t1_fddk7h4,1578324344.0,"Yeah, that I can agree with. We had never had this situation before. Like another comment on this post in a different subreddit said, I say the location should just take it as a loss. It was our mistake and it was our fault. This woman's reaction wasn't necessary, but we did mess up so now we are out the 4 or 5 bucks she was undercharged"
entitledparents,fdd2dhr,t1_fdd2bux,1578292019.0,At least my Boss is super chill about it and just lets it go. We get rude and entitled people coming in all the time so we’re all kind of immune to it. I have a bunch of other stories other than this one lol
entitledparents,fdd0j8m,t1_fdd0e7g,1578290021.0,"That’s a very valid argument, and it would’ve been a better way to deal with it. However I say she is entitled because she was really rude and her attitude was very harsh. But you are absolutely right that I didn’t handle everything perfectly. At the same time however, this situation had never happened before so I needed my manager’s assistance. So being told two different things by two different managers tripped me up a bit.

But I will agree with you that asking her how much time she had left would’ve solved the issue. Good thing my manager did and we left it at that."

entitledparents,fdcxp5z,t1_fdcxapx,1578287390.0,"The title was meant to encourage people to read yes, but if you read what I said I clearly described that he was in fact just trying to de-escalate the situation and I do not blame him for his actions. In fact we are even friends now, it’s just his choice of de-escalating the situation did leave me embarrassed and I would’ve preferred he used a different way to calm her down. But overall it is not a big deal and I can look back and laugh now. Just thought I’d share.

And yeah I get the title is kind of clickbait, but it would’ve been a boring title if I just said “Entitled Mom yells at me and Manager uses embarrassing excuse to get her to leave” doesn’t really provoke wanting to read it"
entitledparents,fdcxhzn,t1_fdcxb7p,1578287217.0,"I actually did talk with him after the fact, he is a really cool guy. He is even thinking about changing over to our location to work there full time. He is also a fan of anime just like me, so we bonded over that. It was just an embarrassing moment that I laugh at now looking back"
entitledparents,fdcxf9w,t1_fdcxbri,1578287151.0,"Fair enough opinion, except I have worked as a casher before and knew what to do. This particular situation had not come up before so my shift lead gave me orders and i tried to follow them while another one gave me different orders. Like I said no one did anything wrong, it was just a lack of communication. The mother was very rude however

Edit: I forgot to mention that if you read all the way down you would see how I mentioned that I’ve worked at this location ever since it opened and have been a cashier for quite some time now. That day just happened to be a busy day so we didn’t focus on exact heights and that’s where someone made the mistake. In addition the mistake wasn’t even made by me, and it was also something that had never happened before in the short time our location has been opened. Any other employee would’ve handled it the same way, and my boss even told me herself I did the right thing."
NarutoShinobiStriker,fdcu0fr,t3_eknbsg,1578284280.0,"If you’re talking money purchased DLC characters:

Attack Type- Minato Namikaze
He has the ability of flying Raijin which is very affective in battle. Not to mention he also has the Rasengan I believe

Defense Type- Obito Uchiha (personal opinion probably not the BEST)
Obito has really strong defenses and even great offenses too so you can play both sides

Heal Type- I rarely play as a heal type so I couldn’t give you the perfect advice, honestly some of the non-purchase heal types are even better

Ranged Type- SASUKE! SASUKE! SASUKE!
With Sasuke you have the chance of a perfect Susano unlock which is extremely powerful. You can also master the chidori with Boruto style Sasuke which is very helpful

I have a list of the non-purchased characters too if you want those instead to save irl cash"
