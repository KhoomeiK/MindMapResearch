The UK and Canada declared war on Japan mainly because UK/Canadians troops were attacked in Hong Kong and were mainly due to the timezone differences distance between the UK, Hong Kong, Hawaii, and North America. Even so, the UK and Canada didn't lose thousands of citizens on their own soil to Japan as much as the thousands of American citizens who died at Pearl Harbor in a sneak attack by a nation the size of California.

Speaking of ""cowards"", Canada chose to divert resources to fight in Europe and as a result, was entirely absent throughout the entire Pacific theater. The only time Canada [massively engaged an ""enemy""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Cottage) in the Pacific was during the landings in Kiska when one Canadian soldier shot at U.S. troops and the wholesale slaughter on both sides led to 28 American dead and four Canadian dead."
