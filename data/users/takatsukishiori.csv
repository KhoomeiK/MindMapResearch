bipolar,fecmk9y,t3_eogf49,1578977635.0,Maybe look up mindfulness activities and exercises. If your brain is in the moment it‚Äôs not freaking out and panicking and overthinking.
declutter,fe67ee1,t1_fe65pwy,1578883459.0,"I literally lost my whole house (minus my laptop and 2 cats) to a tornado in 2011. I luckily had renters insurance so I was able to buy a bunch of stuff immediately after, but wow, the joy of having everything pared down was dimmed by losing so many beloved childhood and adolescent artifacts‚Äînot to mention my whole damn book collection! It was my first place that I considered MY home and it was a new beginning for me‚Äîthen that happened. It was a LOT to deal with!"
Anticonsumption,fdrjgls,t1_fdnou7i,1578685351.0,"Probably a lot harder to open, especially for people with cerebral palsy or similar conditions."
Anticonsumption,fdnnrj4,t3_emc6yj,1578589605.0,"Seems to me like this product and similar products might be useful for a subset of the population, namely disabled people who might not be able to measure and handle all the individual ingredients. This, and products like it, do make their lives easier and help them be more independent..."

SkincareAddiction,fdlx40h,t1_fdlwrn4,1578534591.0,Everyone can use a little more hydration!
BipolarReddit,fdlwc7n,t3_em20h6,1578534069.0,You ARE you. You change over the years and so does your bipolar. My bipolar has gotten worse but I‚Äôve also gotten more confident and more protective of myself as a result. Can you think of it in those terms?
sailormoon,fdlw7oo,t3_em220p,1578533984.0,My local library has manga!
SkincareAddiction,fdlw5za,t3_em243d,1578533953.0,LOVE the hydrating cleanser. I also like the skin-renewing night cream but haven‚Äôt been using it that long. The little bumps/texture on my forehead are gone. I just got the hydrating body wash today.
bulletjournal,fcp2x09,t3_eid6pa,1577848827.0,Something I would do. üòÇüíõ
SkincareAddiction,fcl9nti,t1_fcl743g,1577742828.0,Not familiar with those brands but they sound right. At nighttime use an oil like sweet almond oil or rosehip seed oil as the final step to lock in the other products and protect your skin overnight! And of course‚Äîalways use sunscreen during the day! I use an Ulta brand setting spray that is also 50 spf!
SkincareAddiction,fckzedg,t1_fckj9t0,1577736471.0,How recently? And in what order? What are the products?
SkincareAddiction,fck5we6,t1_fck5eym,1577717487.0,"Maybe it isn‚Äôt extreme exactly, but seems like OP could be better served to get a basic hydration routine in place before resorting to any kind of additional treatment."
SkincareAddiction,fck5sn2,t1_fck54o7,1577717404.0,"I saw, and was seconding you. :)"
SkincareAddiction,fck4w5r,t1_fck4qn4,1577716674.0,Always a good idea to give a basic well-rounded routine a chance before splurging for fancy spa treatments! Why put the cart before the horse? Then once you‚Äôve adjusted to your new routine you can see what fancy treatments would be appropriate!
SkincareAddiction,fck4hmj,t1_fck4dou,1577716334.0,"Yeah! A good routine has four basic steps: cleanser, hydrator, moisturizer, and either occlusive (evening) or sunscreen (morning). I‚Äôm currently using ELF Water Essence for my hydrator."
SkincareAddiction,fck4b0o,t3_ehmje0,1577716179.0,"Don‚Äôt look like wrinkles to me. Rather, dehydration lines! Do you use both a hydrator AND a moisturizer in your routine?"
writing,fc6o5y3,t1_fc6kchp,1577485256.0,I think if it‚Äôs really important to the plot that something is being done to someone it‚Äôs okay‚Äîlike to emphasize vulnerability. But overall it‚Äôs just really clunky and detracts from the action.
writing,fc6byzk,t3_egfcvx,1577477013.0,"I think it‚Äôs totally okay to have passive voice in a first draft. That‚Äôs what first drafts are for: getting the words out of your head and into the paper. When you start revising and editing, keep an eagle eye out for passive voice so it doesn‚Äôt make it into your final draft. Voila!"
bipolar,fc2tvak,t1_fc2ts0u,1577373891.0,I suggest talking with her. Ask her during her manic phases how she feels and what she needs and how you can help her.
bipolar,fc2tfps,t3_efwgsc,1577373535.0,"I don‚Äôt think ‚Äúslutting around‚Äù is a good or fair descriptor here. Anyway, nobody‚Äôs bipolar cycles are dependent on other people. Everyone has their own rhythm. The question is, are you prepared to support her and be there for her when it comes?"
beauty,fc2sedq,t3_efwcvf,1577372662.0,"Anybody trying to sell you products like creams and serums to treat dark circles is wasting your money and time. They‚Äôre usually genetic and besides using concealer the only thing you can really do is get under-eye injections to plump up the skin in that area, which will fill out the hollowness and decrease the dark circles. I am hoping to do this someday as I can‚Äôt stand my dark circles!"
bipolar,fc0xrqw,t3_efko58,1577302547.0,Sometimes you can‚Äôt tell. That‚Äôs why mania and hypomania to a degree can quickly become delusional and even dangerous. I‚Äôm no expert on ADHD behavior but I know with mania and hypomania there‚Äôs an element of irritability and restlessness that can come with it.
MakeupAddiction,fc0ttsz,t3_efk0f4,1577299515.0,Red!
Journaling,fbzdtxm,t3_efan93,1577243401.0,"I have definitely felt that paranoia before. But at some point either you gotta commit to writing 100% honestly in your journal or not. And if not, what‚Äôs the point in it?"
Makeup,fbzdpmr,t3_efarze,1577243288.0,I think peachy blushes look good on all skin tones and are so natural and fresh!
MakeupAddiction,fbvh6bx,t3_eeo20h,1577130739.0,"What about some nice skincare? A natural look needs amazing glowing skin, after all!"
