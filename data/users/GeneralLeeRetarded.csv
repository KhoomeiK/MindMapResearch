Obviously theres more as the US probably has blacksites too(we know they do). What's your point? Still dont stop the fact you have more ""reported prisoners"" of your own countrymen than any other country lol"

You just made me spit out my milk. I've always thought buying silver and gold to give to comments was dumb, but I'd open my wallet right now to give this a ""dumbest post of the week."" award.""


The us literally holds the title for most imprisoned at the moment so idk why you think its stupid.

One: United States
Prisoners: 2, 217,000

Prison population rate (per 100,000 of national population): 698

Two: China
Prisoners: 1,657,812

Prison population rate (per 100,000 of national population): 119

Like fuck me, ya even got china beat and they are wrongfully imprisoning hundreds of thousands at the moment..I can see your dumbass backpedaling your statement later so edited in what you said for posterity."
