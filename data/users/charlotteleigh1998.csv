relationship_advice,ff8m8sw,t1_ff8ki2r,1579685491.0,"Honestly as hard as it is i would just try and move on, if you find it hard to do having him on all social media then send him a message saying that until you are in a better head space you will be blocking him so you can try and move on and when and if you are ready unblock him in the future. From past experience, its hard to move on when you can see everything they are doing on social media.
I hope you're okay"

I know plenty of people who have been with someone they say is perfect and they just dont understand why those feelings aren't there and they feel horrible about it.
He has told you how he feels and as heart breaking as it is you need to accept it and try and move on. Try not to keep checking if hes online all the time."
relationship_advice,ff8gozf,t3_es8j1r,1579677682.0,"I know its hard but you really need to leave while you can. The fact that not only did he hit you but he is shocked by the fact you dont just accept his apology straight away and is trying to emotionally manipulate you into forgiving him is disgusting. Huge red flags
You are completely right by how you feel."
