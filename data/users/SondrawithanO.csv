It was one of those ""Out of control teens"" episodes, and their family situation wasn't great, but she said that they told her and her mom to act it up and she and her mom felt used after it aired, because they both broke down crying and wanting to be better to each other, but that part never aired.

2 guys came and refinished the tub. It looked great... until I was taking a shower and dirty water started bubbling out of the drain.

Apparently, they had busted the drain pipe when they removed the drain, then just stuffed the hole with sandpaper and a bunch of caulking. We had to rip out the adjoining wall to get under the tub and replace the pipe. The company wouldn't answer my calls until I posted reviews all over the internet about it, then they offered a refund only if I would remove the reviews. I told them I'd rather warn others than get my money back.

About the water, we live in the desert (10% humidity at the most usually) and the lid of the tank is a screen, so I figured any water spilled would dry up quickly.
