offmychest,fdf0kpe,t3_ekuf7y,1578350595.0,I stopped saying “sending my prayers” I used to say it because I KNEW I couldn’t do anything so the least I could do was give hope... maybe false hope... I know it’s not doing anything but it just sucks and I agree

offmychest,fca04gr,t1_fc9zjay,1577560811.0,"So a lot of people feel like they would also kill someone? That’s. Hard to believe. I think most people would hate him and that’s how I FELT when I started watching the show.

I don’t relate to him in a small level like a shit ton of people, I truly feel like I’d do the exact same shit he did. I’m serious I really do feel like I’d hurt someone. I don’t even know if I should be saying this. 

That If I was in that situation I most definitely would’ve also killed someone. Wow. Smart move on the internet kiddo."
YouOnLifetime,fc9zr8c,t3_egns8g,1577560655.0,"I’d say I love Beck. Her whole life and friends just taken in an instant. Of course not good friends but she didn’t deserve it.

When I started season 2 I loved Love more than Beck
But I guess I’m kinda biased since beck was first. Later on I got annoyed at Love because I could see she was sort of... fake. She killed Delilah which made me hate her



At first I hated Forthy. But then I got so sad when he died, and when Delilah died."
