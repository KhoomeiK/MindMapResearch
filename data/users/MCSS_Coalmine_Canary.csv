Ghostbc,fffhssf,t1_ffa39od,1579884260.0,You're very welcome! This is some top notch work. üëçüèª
ADHD,fffhq1m,t3_et6er4,1579884212.0,Going through this exact same shit due to my doc adjusting meds trying to find a substitute for a stimulant. Except I hate every second of doing nothing and I cannot find the willpower to move. I move for my dogs and for when my body tells me I can't ignore it anymore. :/ I hope both of us get through this shit soon. It fucking sucks.
Ghostbc,ff9uye8,t3_es7px0,1579722012.0,Dude!! That is amazing. Nice work!
armoredwomen,fen8bf3,t1_fem02gw,1579279172.0,"Yes and no. I see it as embracing the fact that, yes, Germany has done awful things. They aren't trying to hide or deny it. Instead, they are revealing the ugly truth of their country's past. Claiming *and* condemning it.  ""[I] want to love and damn you."" It also sends a clear message that they've no truck with pro-nazis, which is something that has always irritated them.

That they are well known for shock rock just plays well with this. IMO

ETA: The teaser was 100% meant to shock and grab people's attention, I should add. It was very effective."
armoredwomen,fejvc0y,t1_fejjogu,1579186696.0,You are correct! She is pretty much always wearing the colors of Germany for whichever era she's depicting. Her skin tone was often the black. She has on red contacts and gold teeth in other shots.
armoredwomen,fejv7sp,t1_fejir18,1579186616.0,"IKR?

LOL I was literally thinking earlier that she actually made smoking look sexy. It's disgusting as hell and I'm allergic to the shit but the movements were oddly appealing."
PublicFreakout,fejv3jm,t1_fejhhfp,1579186538.0,Same here. I didn't expect to like the 60's vibe but here we are. I shouldn't be surprised; they're such a talented group.
PublicFreakout,fejguup,t1_fejdzm8,1579173631.0,You're welcome! Nice start to the morning to have that song playing in my head. :)
armoredwomen,fejgtqt,t1_fej0rda,1579173590.0,So I've heard!
armoredwomen,fejgtb0,t1_feipay9,1579173573.0,Masterful indeed.
WoT,fejgp81,t3_ep3nts,1579173417.0,"About 15 years ago, I made an offhand comment that I'd never read any fantasy books, despite being totally into it gaming-wise. (OG EverQuest players, where y'at?) The next time I saw him, he shoved the first book for both Wheel of Time and A Song of Ice and Fire into my hands and insisted I read them. I've since re-read the series countless times (although I'm overdue for another) and delight in finding things I somehow missed previously."
PublicFreakout,fejdyra,t1_fejbr6q,1579169379.0,Off topic but I love your user name!
AskReddit,feikjcp,t1_fehupez,1579140670.0,"[Hello

YouShouldKnow,feiiq0j,t1_feih8l0,1579139455.0,"Very true. And some likely get so caught up in something (in this case negative) that it becomes part of their identity. Lookin at you, pit haters.

The on/off leash thing can be a trigger for some dogs. That said, I don't believe you should have your dogs unleashed in public spaces unless you're specifically in a dog park intended for that. That dude just reinforces the negative stereotype, which also irks me. I hope the other owner and their dog were ok."
armoredwomen,feii5mg,t1_feieqyb,1579139081.0,"That was undoubtedly one of, if not **the** reason for it."
armoredwomen,feihz18,t1_feib8v0,1579138961.0,"Ah, ok. Thank you for clarifying. I wondered if that might have explained your choice of terminology there. Rammstein does love thumbing their nose. It's part of why so many love them."
armoredwomen,fei9ow9,t1_fei09i4,1579133417.0,VERY well said; thank you. Although should we even obfuscate to something as (comparatively) harmless sounding as fetishism? Or does that descriptor cover more than just Nazi sympathizers and their ilk in this instance?
YouShouldKnow,fei8lbs,t1_fei0d2a,1579132701.0,"That is so disturbing. What kind of psychopath does shit like that? Why?? There was someone (may still be, I don't live there anymore) in Baton Rouge that was beheading cats. My two cats have always been indoors but I feared for my friends cats. Hell, anyone's cats. No animal deserves that.

Same re: violent dogs/terrible owners. We had a family come into the dog park with the largest pit types I'd ever seen. They were obviously aggressive and agitated before even coming in. Within moments of entering, one attacked the other and drew blood. Three adults and two small children in that party and not a single one of them had any control over their animals. This was before they even took off their leashes! Meanwhile, my girl has crawled under the bench beneath us and is shaking. We packed it up right then and left, but not before the largest slipped out of his collar and took off across the park. WHY would you bring them to a park to begin with??"
armoredwomen,fei6x1e,t1_fei0484,1579131632.0,"I don't doubt they based it upon something historically significant. Every\* minute detail in the video is there for a reason. If so, I'm sure that looks weren't as important as functionality for the original wearer."
armoredwomen,fei6lwb,t1_fei05af,1579131433.0,I haven't been fortunate enough to go to one but I have seen videos. It looks absolutely insane. I envy you!
armoredwomen,fei6hvi,t1_fehnqi4,1579131361.0,Same here; they hooked me as a teenager when they first hit the scene with Du Hast. Sonne taught me to count from one to ten! LOL
armoredwomen,fei6etw,t1_fehk9eq,1579131306.0,Agreed!! The costume designer for that video was on point.
armoredwomen,fei6cg8,t1_fehx0pp,1579131263.0,She is German.
armoredwomen,fehguv3,t1_fehgd0d,1579116264.0,Same. The video is incredibly well done; probably their best work yet. Ruby's performance was spectacular. I've almost developed a girl-crush on her for it. LOL
armoredwomen,feheif5,t3_ep6m9w,1579114892.0,"[Source Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeQM1c-XCDc)

&#x200B;

ETA: Video may be disturbing for some, as it is a very in-depth depiction of Germany's extensive history. Good and bad (mostly bad). Every scene is full of symbolism. It's captivating and educational, but could still be upsetting to some."
Ghostbc,fegzm96,t3_eoa25q,1579106040.0,How can I \*not\* want these?
trashy,fegx4eo,t1_fegw7d1,1579104492.0,ikr? How else do we learn? By listening to our elders? Pfffft. Lame.
trashy,fegw0ck,t1_fefg71e,1579103783.0,"Crabs in a bucket, I tell ya. I am very much so, thank you! That guy was a bunch of lessons I learned the hard way, which allowed me to truly appreciate the man I am now married to. I hope you live an equally enjoyable life, r/fckwrinkle. ;)"
YouShouldKnow,fegvrb3,t1_fefqybk,1579103625.0,"Oh no!! That is so sad. Things like that (and my state being one of the worst for dog theft/fighting) are what keeps me from letting mine out without supervision. Our blind girl has that square pitty head, so she's automatically a target, too."
trashy,fegvgwd,t1_feg05w6,1579103440.0,"Sorry for being snippy. You were the second one to say that so I was already annoyed, which means my brain read it in a negative tone instead of a humorous one. Thanks for the explanation and kind reply, I appreciate it."
xmen,fefah9z,t1_fef9eiy,1579052000.0,ü§£ Nice.

trashy,fef4x7o,t1_fef3azt,1579048264.0,"Makes sense when you put it like that. Everyone wants* to feel like they belong. I just try to remember that A. There is a person on the other end, and B. You never know who is hanging by a thread. Be kind, first and foremost. Making someone smile or laugh is even better.  A small, unexpected kindness could potentially push someone back from a ledge. You never know. If ya gotta be a judgmental douche canoe, keep that shit in your head or vent it privately. Like I do. LOL

And that got *waaaay* more serious than I ever expected with my first comment. I was more confused and mildly annoyed than upset, but your comment snapped me out of the latter. So thanks for that. You're good people. :)"
YouShouldKnow,fef3nrn,t1_fef26rc,1579047414.0,"The reason my brain leapt to food poisoning so quickly is that I have found chunks of meat thrown into our yard before. It's scary. I'm a helicopter parent thankfully, so I always investigate what they fixate on. Had I not caught it, or my husband not found a second attempt, our girls would likely be dead for the crime of existing. People are just sick."
YouShouldKnow,fef3boa,t1_fef26rc,1579047190.0,"True. I work for a rescue, so we don't have security of any sort. Everything is run out of the adoption coordinators home. People leave stuff on her porch or drop it next to our table during adoption events all the time. She's so busy and strapped for time that she wouldn't even remember a face, I bet."
trashy,fef30kl,t1_fef203s,1579046983.0,"Weird, eh? Trying to tear others down to make themselves look virtuous. I don't understand the mindset. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø Just be good to each other, folks! As long as someone isn't being a dick, it ain't hard."
trashy,fef1he3,t1_feeweg4,1579045955.0,"His whole family came across as trash, so it may have simply been the circles they ran in."
trashy,fef14ng,t1_feewfjk,1579045718.0,"LOL Thank you for that laugh. I'm just sitting here wondering how that became the takeaway from my comment. I've done plenty of shit I now regret, but at least I learned from it."
xmen,feewdtt,t1_fedz1sp,1579042648.0,"Well, shit. I was fixated on how Wolverine looks like he doesn't have a nose. Didn't even catch the tumor boob."

dogs,feer1oe,t3_eomrod,1579039384.0,It's amazing how many people are completely unprepared for everything that goes into raising a puppy. It's not common (thankfully) but our rescue has had returns within* a week or two because it was just too much.
YouShouldKnow,feeq7ig,t1_feept3k,1579038897.0,Good point!
YouShouldKnow,feeq522,t1_feepsp4,1579038857.0,"Same!! I may or may not have cried happy tears over similar things. Like a big ass food donation. Or someone who adopts, then hands us extra money for a donation. I want to hug them."

YouShouldKnow,feepndi,t1_feeicd4,1579038578.0,For real. We got a supply of brand new DC themed beds a while back and it was so awesome. I'm thankful there are people with the means and kindness in their heart to do such things.

trashy,feeged2,t1_feedif3,1579033218.0,"Seriously. My ex-husband was from KCMO and moved to the Gulf area, where I'm from. You know, the states that are more widely known to be racist? Yeah, I had never heard someone freely using racial slurs (other than my estranged grandfather) until him. I was stunned. Dude did not seem to understand that is not OK. He said it was the norm up there. Major WTF moment."

fosterdogs,fcl6bmx,t1_fcl0fkv,1577740748.0,"We do, and are registered. As I'm the foster, I'm doing what I can while CHS handles their end. They had an issue with a recent FB fundraiser, so I think they're leery of it, and opted for GoFundMe, instead.

I don't know if it's ok or not to post a link here to the FB post in question, but I can try if you'd like to look at and see if there is something I can do to help draw more attention to it.

He is home now, surprisingly. Got a last minute request from our adoption lead to come get him. My husband picked him up a while ago but we haven't actually been updated on what all they did just yet. He's still gagging, so I don't think the issue is resolved."
future_fight,fcl5h1c,t1_fckxon3,1577740229.0,They did not. First thing I checked!
fosterdogs,fckvrzq,t1_fcknod8,1577734255.0,"I appreciate that, but I don't know if they allow non-pitties. He's an American Bulldog. Most likely purebred, given his story. You're not the first to say he looks like a pit, though!"

Within a month she was bumping into stuff and hated going outside. It took another month or so, but once she adjusted, she moved on like nothing was ever wrong."
