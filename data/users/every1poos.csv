If you’re not ready for hugging, kissing, cuddling, that’s OK. And you never have to be a big hugger, cuddler, kisser. My bf of 4 years doesn’t like it either so I don’t force him to. I love him and think he’s wonderful so I want him to be comfortable and happy. We’ve worked out a decent compromise. 

If you’re just starting daring, don’t worry about whether you’re enough for them, don’t worry about if you’re doing everything they want. You worry about if they’re enough for you! You worry about if they’re doing everything YOU want and satisfying YOU. Eventually, you’ll find someone that you care enough about that it’s automatic that you care what they want and you won’t feel obligated to be or act a certain way."

AmItheAsshole,fc6pbki,t1_fc5uwpu,1577486080.0,"Agree OP is NTA and bio-dad shouldn’t have assumed OP is encouraging daughter to call stepdad daddy. However, I think the bio-dad was not TA for bringing it up and saying it bothered him, he just went about it in the exact way he shouldn’t have which made him the biggest A.

Parental alienation is a real thing and a real concern for a lot of people. I’ve seen and know women insisting children call the SO dad/mom when the child’s real parent is still in the picture. So I don’t blame the dad for thinking this, but he could have handled it 100 times better. Just from the way OP described how it progressed to daddy, I do not think she encouraged it and I agree she should let her daughter call her stepdad whatever she wants. 

I also think it’s unfair to bash the bio-dad for only getting his kid 4 days a week, like so many have in this post. it does sound like he doesn’t deserve more, leaving mom at 2 months pregnant, and mom does sound extremely reasonable and mentally mature, but I also know courts still tend to side with “kids should be with their mother” and gives full custody to moms. 

Overall, I think OP is handling things well, she is NTA, and I hope bio-dad doesn’t try to take things out on the daughter and make her stop calling her step-dad daddy. People should be happy that their kids are getting so much love from so many places instead of getting jealous."
