news,fffhlgq,t1_ffemsgl,1579884133.0,"Is your 1st point regarding people who get pay daily ? 

Because ive been paid weekly and also monthly with an agreed payment frequency. So I know when my money comes in and can budget accordingly. 

Forgot US love their checks. Seems like the payment system in US is incredibly behind some other 1st world countries. I didnt consider that. Its very strange when u have two biggest contactless payment giants Apple and Google who were founded in US but use of their system is so restricted in their own country.

On the other hand France also sucks when it comes to contactless payments.

Im just spoiled with how easy its to pay in UK."

“There were concerns from elected officials that such stores and eateries discriminated against poorer customers who don't have access to bank accounts”

How is this a thing ? 
Are employers refusing to pay wages using bank transfers ? 
Do US banks have ridiculous requirements for creating an account ?"
