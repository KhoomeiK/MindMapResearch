Obviously Trea plays a more valuable position, plays much better defense, and has speed that Nick never had.  

So Besides Soto, I can’t think of anyone else the Nats should try harder to lock up for the next decade.  With Rendon gone, Trea is the obvious choice to carry the torch that Zimmerman has held for so long(and hopefully does for another year)
