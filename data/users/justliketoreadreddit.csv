AskMen,fcu816q,t3_eimia6,1577974750.0,"Honestly there are a TON of body weight exercises that should be more then enough to start you off. 

Do a good mix of cardio and strength to start, and then tailor your workouts to what you need! 

For cardio you can do stuff as simple as running up and down the stairs, jumping jacks, jump rope, running, jogging, biking, even a brisk walk if you aren‚Äôt up for a run! 

For strength exercises, squats, lunges, pushups, sit-ups, planks, tons of core exercises, and much more that you can look up online with ‚Äúbody weight strength exercise‚Äù. A lot of these you can ramp up the intensity by adding weights (and honestly, you don‚Äôt always need to pay for dumbbells, a gallon of water can help you with squats etc until you build up your strength!) 

Don‚Äôt feel like you need to spend a ton of money to start- if you are out of shape, doing the above should challenge you enough to start!"

dogs,fctene2,t1_fct5cn7,1577940832.0,Thank you! I definitely will. All 5 of my dogs were rescues :)
dogs,fct358e,t1_fct2nmq,1577931656.0,Thank you!! I truly love rescue dogs (I‚Äôve had 5 dogs in my life and every single one has been a rescue!) but I am looking for a good breeder this time around!
dogs,fct1rfi,t1_fct1l5n,1577930631.0,Actually a sheltie might be even better because the ~70 pounds for rough collie is a bit bigger than i would like! I would love a dog around 35-45 pounds
dogs,fct1l5n,t1_fct0zw1,1577930505.0,"This is an awesome suggestion! I had not thought of a collie but when looking at their temperament and needs it seems like it
Good be a great fit. One of the biggest things I LOVE to do with my dogs is long runs in the woods/outdoors. Do you think a collie would enjoy this? My husky mix and husky LOVE this but my rottie mix is bored after a few minutes and not at all interested in running."
dogs,fct0n59,t1_fcsteoy,1577929815.0,Thank you so much! This is exactly what I‚Äôm looking for- the pups of the litter that aren‚Äôt going to fit the mold for a sports star but would make a good active companion!
dogs,fct0l62,t1_fcsrf4n,1577929774.0,Thank you!! Most people suggested some bully breeds and other large but I‚Äôm afraid those dogs are a bit bigger than I‚Äôm looking for!

dogs,fcso044,t1_fcsdflb,1577920769.0,Yes! The dog will work with my everyday on obedience training to do tasks- and of course lots and lots of exercise! The end goal is to take the dog on hikes and do some finding tasks for fun when she is off leash trained!!

dogs,fcga54w,t1_fcg9l1g,1577638011.0,Thanks so much! You‚Äôre so right- I‚Äôm thinking a rescue mix is right for me because I‚Äôm not sure the health issues of a purebred Labrador are anything I‚Äôm trying to get into. I would love to have a golden retriever but I am afraid it might be too big for me- going to explore some shelters and rescues near me for the time being!

casualiama,fcbwpre,t1_fcbrgyv,1577591814.0,"Hi! I stayed in student-housing-in-the-school-year-hostel-in-the-summer type of situation as sort of a ‚ÄúBase‚Äù for a few weeks. They charged a flat rate for a certain number of nights that was very affordable (I roomed with two other people). It was in a cheaper part of Austria that was pretty central to travel from. 

Before I went, I had planned a lot of my travel trips with a few friends to different cities. We did this by using google flights and choosing ‚Äúflexible‚Äù dates, and then finding the dirt-cheapest housing possible. Usually this was either a hostel or surprisingly, small Airbnb‚Äôs. 

I walked a LOT. Took a lot of trains. 

Biggest thing I learned was DO NOT BE AFRAID TO WALK. As long as you are with friends and in a generally safe location, you can walk considerable distances and not be tired, especially if the weather is good. So book your rooms away from city centers, and walk in to a train station or bus station and get to the city center of wherever you are going that way. 


Way too much for one post but 

TLDR: google flights, walking, Airbnb, book stuff WAY in advance"
