depression,ffbi6sd,t1_ffbbm1o,1579766442.0,"The problem is not that people don't earn enough money, the problem is that they don't save or even spend it properly. 

Make your own food. Don't shop unless your clothes are torn, and even then you can get them repaired. Don't drink. Don't blow away your money on things that aren't crucial to your survival. If you can't afford rent, live in a hostel or share a room with a friend. Use the bus or if you can't help it, get a bike to commute to work. Don't marry or get yourself into a relationship if you don't have any money.  Buy generic antidepressants if you're too broke. Don't go for therapy. Cut down on social media.

Take a look at poor immigrants who are just starting out in a new country. They live way worse than most people on this subreddit, yet they are happier as well.

I agree money is important, but it only is important as far as your basic survival is concerned. If you are not starving or out on the road homeless, money won't change your life. Cut your expenses and you'll be fine, money-wise. 

I practice what I preach. I work from home, make my own food. My only indulgence is a fast Internet connection. I don't go out very much. It's bland and boring, but I don't need to work myself too hard and I don't need to worry about money. To me, financial freedom is more important than going to 'discover' myself. 

Maybe I'll die depressed, but I hope not to die broke.

depression,feywbyw,t3_eqsxda,1579451285.0,"Too many of these 'You matter', 'You are loved' posts on this subreddit, man. 

Some of them are just too self-masturbatory. Some guy posts them and another one replies with 'Thanks, it made my day better!'. As if saying 'You are loved' made your day better. Fuck off. Nobody's day has been made better. 

Nobody means it when they say 'You matter' 'You are loved'. A more apt translation of what they would be saying is 'Look mate, I know you're in pain, but it would be mighty inconvenient for me and others if you offed yourself. So don't alright? Lemme use some feel goody words and promise you help even though I will lose interest and ghost you within 5 minutes if you actually told me how you're dying on the inside'

Existentialism,fdpnb12,t3_emdarn,1578633562.0,"Depressive realism is quite real. Normies usually have enough going on in their lives that stop them from falling into nihilism or existentialism, and so, you're unlikely to find them here.

Optimistic nihilists or existentialists are quite rare, I'd say. It has more to do with brain chemistry than will power or motivation to 'make your own meaning'."
