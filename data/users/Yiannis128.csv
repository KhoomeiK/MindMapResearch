Pengwin is good since it comes preconfigured with packages in such a way that it adds more compatibility and ease with windows."

The WSL team did say that they are working on making it so that Windows and WSL use the same network interface but that's probably not coming for a few more months. After that the X-Server stuff should work automatically.

They also \*hinted\* that they are working on enabling the graphics card to work with WSL so once that comes, WSL should be able to display stuff on its own without a separate X-Server."
