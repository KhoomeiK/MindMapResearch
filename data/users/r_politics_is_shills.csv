bostonceltics,ffie9wi,t3_etrczr,1579971794.0,"[This thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/sixers/comments/eso5tp/al_horford_has_been_struggling_from_3/) was on the first page of /r/sixers yesterday. There was actually some intelligent discussion for those who truly care. Here are some highlights:

Horford 3s were backbreakers when they were unexpected on the Celtics and the Sixers were worried about the other shooting threats. He was often wide open and could shoot in rhythm with his slow awkward release. On this team it’s been hammered into him “stretch the floor. Create space for Ben and Jojo”. His shot looks rushed and that’s just not the kind of shooter he is...

The main reason is Horford always popped wither after a pick or a DHO. IT and Kyrie were such threats from the 3 that they always commanded the attention of both defenders which left Al wide open. Can’t do that with Ben because defenders simply go under screens.

The reason first and foremost was Embiid insurance, followed by backup center, and then defense.

The stretch 4 thing was something everyone was hoping and praying for.

> Elton Brand definitely said that him being able to play the stretch 4 next to Embiid was a big part of the decision.

>> If he did, then he's either being an optimist or an idiot.



Al Horford game is not all about shooting 3's and that's a problem. he's out here looking like a spot up 3 point shooter because in a way he needs to be. i was watching his highlights in boston and i didn't see him jacking up 3's over there like that he does not fit here.

I see this argument all the time ""Brett isn't using him right!"" How exactly is he supposed to be used when the point guard passes the ball off in the half court, and immediately runs into the paint? How would you coach Horford, knowing that the point guard won't do anything out of his comfort zone in order to make his teammates more comfortable on the court?"

Patriots,fdoplb4,t3_emhfrd,1578610023.0,"The passages I find most intriguing: 

Now, because of salary cap machinations the team engaged in last off-season, there’s an extra $13.5M hanging out there that needs to be accounted for with Brady’s deal. 

The team has until free agency begins on March 18 to give Brady a new contract; otherwise, the $13.5M will count against their 2020 salary cap. And that’s regardless of whether or not he re-signs here after free agency begins.For Brady to remain a Patriot and not take up an unacceptable amount of cap room he first HAS to re-sign before March 18 to avoid the $13.5M cap charge. 

So the idea I’ve bandied about that Brady will go take a free agent tour then come back to the Patriots is faulty."

He will not win any more super bowls whether i'ts staged or not, and he is much better off somewhere else. Here, let me tell you a story that will sum up this entire thing. Once apon a time, in the land of the NFL, there were many tribes, who were constantly competin g with each other. One day, a corrupt, and powerful empire by the name of the new england patriots rose up, and spread fear thourghout the land. Their Emporer, was Robert Kraft, who had money for schemes, big mansions, and 2 prostitutes in Flordia. His advisor, Bill Bellicheck, was not as bad, though still schemed and scandeled his way to power. And finaly, the tyrant-general known as Tom Brady, who commanded an army of powerful soldiers. Together, these 3 were almost unstopable. Many tried, and failed, to throw them out of power. Every year, there was a great war. 6 of these years they won. But in 2020, they had to go through a few rival tribes to go to the war. The first was the titans. The patriots lost to the titans, and were finaly dethroned, and so the twisted, turned, corrupt sad sack of horse-shit that was splattered on the history of the NFL was cleaned up by the honorable titans, using the cloth of their pure awesomeness to clean up the smelly, awful, corrupt, cheating, lying, scheming empire that the new england patriots had set their so called legacy to."
