I'm giggling my way through a miserable,slow and lonely death as a coping mechanism while my exhuasted gf I never see is passed out after working a double and has to work a ""clopen"" where you close one shift, but in a couple hours are the opener."

Occasionally I flounder and go on Reddit while she snores and try to flush out this philosophy that life is inherently miserable, but life doesnt get to double down on me.

Her mom's four cats and two dogs eat better than us, and that's just funny. That shit comes out of our paychecks. 

I think this sub lacks a defeatist sense of humor. Bukowski came close with ""what matters most is how you walk through the fire.""

ABoringDystopia,ffbfrmm,t1_ffazrqz,1579763343.0,"I'm 30 and I finally own a house. But it's doesn't sound so great. My 40 year old GF found a loophole where we can live in an elderly facility with her disabled mother, and the mobile housing is affordable. 

But she works two jobs, and I work a full time job and intern with no pay. 

So she's asleep in bed right now, 11:03pm, after working two eight hour shifts. She gets up at 4:09, we cuddle for one snooze, then her friend and her carpool to job#1. 

She takes a trolly after job #1 for 1.5 hours to work job #2, where sometimes she has to work overtime, coming home at 1am sometimes. That's three days in a row sometimes. It's breaking her physically, and I can only bring in one income. 

But we're taking care of her disabled mother who is draining us financially. This sub both reminds and depresses me that I only see my GF depressed for a couple hours, she smokes a bowl, then passes out on my shoulder. 

My job is physically taxing, but the internship is a rest period for me, really. I keep reminding her that this is life. This is what we didn't sign up for, but have to put our John Handcocks under.

And the cruel silver lining is we have a tax return to look forward to.. so we can get at-home care for her mom. But it doesn't depress me, or bring me down. Its so hilariously stacked against us, that it's like a joyful, slow and sorrowful suicide. 

We'll live long lives, go to bingo night in this crummy mobile home community. It's just life. It should always be painful, miserable, bleak, unrewarding, difficult and lonely. She's snoring right now and I miss her."
videos,ffbf06q,t1_ffbap1k,1579762436.0,"She has a ""mommy blog,"" which sounds cringey. But she has dope recipes, personal finance tips. She got a lot of followers from that, hosts  at workshops for social media stuff, she's really smart. Then, I think, a third party came to her and said ""you have X amount of followers, can you take cuts videos with your kids while showing off Swisher products?"" And the like. 

She has six year old twins, a four year old and sixteen years old boy, so money is always a little tight. She found a way to spend more time with her kids by just investing in camera tech and going to the park.

Edit: I'm assuming it's a third party ad agency because she does so many different products. I haven't asked her about those specifics."

But the gift card thing haha my gf's pastry shop gets that all the time at the mall she works at. There was a ring of guys pulling that, and her shop and a Starbucks helped bust.

PublicFreakout,ffav0zy,t1_ffacy5g,1579745138.0,"I used to work at Aaron Brothers, and we were really understaffed. And it was in a super wealthy part of Encinitas (built frames for Tony Hawk, heyy).

Customers were so confused that we would have 2-3 people to stock, design frames (this could take an hour sometimes), build frames, register (""would you like to donate $1 to our bullshit charity that's really a tax deduction?). 

And the stores are pretty good sized. So if an old person spent to long asking about adult coloring books, you'd get written up for not ""shopping"" (following) with someone who was clearly going to steal something, and would just walk away with expensive art supplies. One guy just grabbed all the expensive markers and walked out."
PublicFreakout,ffaukbf,t1_ffabt7s,1579744826.0,"I live in Chula Vista, and we have security fucking everywhere. Walmart is like a prison. Underwear is locked up, reflective vests and work boots are locked up. 

CVS has giant black dudes as security. The 24/7 weed dispensaries have, usually, a huge black guy with a handgun, or a tiny white kid with full camo and an AR 15. 

If you walk past the ""please wait here"" sign at the register at CVS, a loud buzz and a loud ""please step back,"" on the intercom.

But the best part - my favorite part - is there is some return scam at CVS that old ladies pull. I haven't figured it out. But they'll buy and return stuff from different stores? And then walk away with like one item and a bunch of cash? It's confusing, but I see it all the time. One lady brought a foldable chair for this hour long process."

Edit: sorry again for being pedantic and crass. Lots of child abuse at the mega church I went to (North Coast Church). There was this one time when I was 11 and we played Kings Cup, where we went around and had to chug a glass of water if we pulled a face card. We weren't allowed to pee. Totally forgot about this story, holy (pardon) shit. 

Kids pissed themselves. Then there was the game where youth leaders would twist our nipples and yell ""NAME TEN CAR COMPANIES!"" oh oh oh! Then the game where if you said the word ""mine"" you had to do ten push ups. 

Ohhhh I forgot about the Ultimate Sit Up game where a group leader would blind fold us, and make us do a sit up, but would rip their pants off and stick their bare ass in our face.

Hol up, I'm remembering more shit..

The Whiplash tournaments, where nine year olds (I never did any of this shit as a group leader, this is when I was nine) would twist wet towels and whip each other until the other bled. We hated it, but it was encouraged by college youth leaders. 

So maybe not religion. Maybe. But religion has a terrible track record and is why I left Bible college ten years ago. But going on a tangent with someone who has a cute username like yours seems like I'm barking at a blank wall, so I'll count my losses.

I brought it up to the youth pastor at the camp and he said ""oh yeah, that happens."" Not sure if it was influenced by religion, but there was a discussion about the psychological effects of shaming a child for doing number one or two. 

some parents didn't want us to take their kids to the bathroom at church, so the kids waited for their parents. But at camps, where the kids were separated from their parents for 8 days, some kids would try to hold in their bowel movements for as long as possible."

So she's asleep in bed right now, 11:03pm, after working two eight hour shifts. She gets up at 4:09, we cuddle for one snooze, then her friend and her carpool to job#1. 

She takes a trolly after job #1 for 1.5 hours to work job #2, where sometimes she has to work overtime, coming home at 1am sometimes. That's three days in a row sometimes. It's breaking her physically, and I can only bring in one income. 

But we're taking care of her disabled mother who is draining us financially. This sub both reminds and depresses me that I only see my GF depressed for a couple hours, she smokes a bowl, then passes out on my shoulder. 

My job is physically taxing, but the internship is a rest period for me, really. I keep reminding her that this is life. This is what we didn't sign up for, but have to put our John Handcocks under.

And the cruel silver lining is we have a tax return to look forward to.. so we can get at-home care for her mom. But it doesn't depress me, or bring me down. Its so hilariously stacked against us, that it's like a joyful, slow and sorrowful suicide.

Edit: and how surreal that 1) we can do this via science, 2) that people have an urge to do this for a family that isn't theirs. Yes, OP was.compemsated, but she went through birth knowing that the end result was a child going to a family eager to have another child in their life."

I think I gamed the system fairly well. I took a lot of culinary and graphic/web design courses, did web design out if high school, and now I work in a kitchen.

I got to take a bunch of electives because I graduated early, so junior year to senior year I just walked around a giant hs campus with an expensive camera when I wasn't in English/gov.

Edit: I also had my own website where I sold t shirts, and Livestrong bands for my site (the joke was, and I'm sorry I was an edgy teen 'this donation will literally go no where, but it's sort of yellow')."

Nothing. I don't have any. My GF is passed out next to me from working two doubles three days in a row, and I just got home from work and will literally enjoy zero time with my GF. I work. I pop on Reddit, imgur, YouTube, get high, and go to bed. And I wrestled in high school.
