greysanatomy,ffso3eb,t3_euur50,1580186779.0,Alex will always be my favorite
TwoXSex,ffsezw2,t3_eu9vs9,1580180094.0,"Not uncommon. I’m in a LDR too, international. We only get to see each other every other month or so, but regardless I need my alone time, just like he needs his. I also deal with people all day at work and sometimes don’t want to talk to anyone at all. So you’re definitely not alone!"

relationship_advice,fffxun1,t1_ff406zy,1579894171.0,"Do it girl! I started again at 28 and all I can say it has been so worth it. At least you found out now while you’re still young, rather than later on."
relationships,fevnc50,t3_eqlkev,1579399292.0,I would end it ASAP. This sounds toxic and you’d be much better off without her
relationships,felghrs,t3_eppo5s,1579221622.0,"It seems like you’re being responsible and thinking about this financially, while she’s approaching the situation with her emotions. I think if she gets pregnant these emotions will subside for the moment, but at some point these insecurities will return just in a different form. I’d really think about it before you try to get pregnant again and make sure you want this too and you’re not just doing it to satisfy her."
aww,feduvcy,t3_eokyfc,1579020393.0,Absolutely beautiful!!
confidence,fe8mmso,t3_eo4ewt,1578927994.0,"I have the same exact problem, even when I lose weight. For me I’ve noticed it’s all about what I’m eating and the ingredients. Any added sugar or sugar replacement, sodium, etc. Another thing that has helped me in the past is taking a water pill because you might be retaining water specifically to your face. There’s no easy fix, but hopefully some of these things help."
relationships,fe6igd9,t1_fe6e5pc,1578891920.0,Yay that’s so exciting!! Happy for you
relationships,fe697da,t3_entrp8,1578884563.0,"Did you go!? I really hope you did. My now boyfriend almost didn’t show up to our first date, similar situation and he always says how happy he is that he did."
relationships,fe68ukr,t3_enwli2,1578884326.0,"My (28f) parents don’t get along and stayed together for the kids and they’re still together. Nothing has gotten better, only worse. I’m not saying it can’t get better, but it would take a lot of work on both ends and it doesn’t seem like he wants to try at this point. If you’re this unhappy I would definitely go to counseling even if it’s alone and maybe even start to find a way out of that marriage. I’m so sorry you’re going through this"
relationships,fe68g2t,t3_envqc0,1578884071.0,If you think you could potentially get more comfortable with her work and you really want to be with her then I’d continue the relationship. But if you’re feeling this upset and you don’t think you’ll ever be okay with it then I’d end things now before your feelings develop even more
relationships,fe67hkt,t3_enitdh,1578883515.0,It sounds like she isn’t going to be pleased either way. She needs to choose if she wants you away or she wants less income. I feel like even if you do get another job with more money she’ll find something else to be upset about too.
relationships,fe64kys,t3_emsq8x,1578881651.0,"My boyfriend and I met on Reddit. Yes, on Reddit and on a depression thread. We started talking casually and helping eachother talk through their problems. Then it became more and more and it just so happened that I was traveling to his hometown for work and we met up. We had such a great time that we spent both nights together when I visited and we’ve been together ever since! We’re traveling back and forth to see each other and now planning our move so we can live together and not have to jump on a plane every time. He’s Canadian and I’m American, he’s Jewish and I’m Catholic. On paper we don’t make much sense, but I’ve never been so in love. I never thought I’d find the one, yet here I am and I have this app to thank for it. It really is true, you’ll meet the right person when you least expect it. I haven’t been this happy in so long and I feel incredibly lucky!!"
food,fdsyxbo,t3_emvq9f,1578709757.0,Omg I just came my pants
introvert,fdrma0a,t3_ems3u0,1578686490.0,"You sound like a very caring person to be seeking advice and worrying for her. All I can say is that once you two are apart, it’s going to be out of your control. Maybe you can discuss with her beforehand your concerns, but hopefully at her next base she’s able to meet someone she can confide in or just talk to. Wishing you both luck"
introvert,fdrlmli,t3_eml0gx,1578686334.0,"For me as an introvert I need my alone time and can’t socialize with friends every 2 days like you mentioned. I think you might need to offer to let him go out and spend time with his friends when he wants, but to let you stay behind if you need your space. Or express to him that you would like to spend more time just you two together. Good luck!"
introvert,fdrlf20,t3_emq0tt,1578686248.0,"My boyfriend is an introvert too, but we honestly clicked so well from the beginning. At times we could be shy or a little hesitant to discuss certain topics, but it has been perfect. I say keep going and see what happens, it might just take some more time for you two to be comfortable together since you’re both introverted!"
depression,fdrl7aw,t3_emo7hq,1578686131.0,"I personally wouldn’t want to put my trust in someone like this. It could be an off day for her, but that doesn’t sound like someone who I would want as my therapist."
depression,fdrkv6f,t3_emnbdm,1578685925.0,"I’ve never been in your position with a divorce, but I know how broken you can feel after someone cheating. Is it worth being with someone who wants an open relationship so you don’t have to get a divorce? I know you don’t want to lose your daughter, but I think that this will continue to weigh you down if you stay with her. I feel like eventually you’ll have to divorce and fight for joint custody. Your happiness is important and if you’re feeling this way now, I’m afraid it will only get worse."
blunderyears,fdrju0u,t3_emhjdu,1578685564.0,Great transformation!
TwoXSex,fdriirn,t3_emh8ii,1578685058.0,"Girl here, I agree it’s not the easiest, but I think it’s pleasurable for both if you can make it work!"
TwoXSex,fdkg2v5,t1_fdk268r,1578503122.0,"Exactly what I was going to suggest! I bet sometimes he’ll get in the mood too. Maybe not always, but definitely worth the try."
TwoXSex,fdfwd46,t3_eko3oa,1578371993.0,I love this. Thank you
depression,fd5zbnr,t3_ejw74l,1578183405.0,"I (28f) can say you have so much to live for. Yes I work a 9-5 to pay the bills but I have so much freedom and live a much better life than I did in high school. I felt the same as you but I can truly say there’s so much of your life to still live, so don’t be scared or dreadful of the future. Sending good vibes your way"
