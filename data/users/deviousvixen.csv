Twitch,fffqexj,t1_ffetvc6,1579889548.0,You could have even gained followers by this complaint filled post.
Twitch,ffflls3,t3_etctf3,1579886607.0,Are you referring to that twitch girl who was losing her shit cause no one subbed or donated for an hour. That was sad and I honestly hope she loses viewers for it.
Twitch,fffk8cl,t1_ffffi2f,1579885760.0,I think you gotta be up and up on the release date. I wanted stream tem tem but now it's already saturated. Top streamer getting 2k viewers etc.
DestinyTheGame,fffhf9y,t1_fff6bfn,1579884024.0,Oh for sure. They sure change when I say hey just so you know I am streaming and would appreciate no racism.
DestinyTheGame,fffgs1g,t1_ffeth6e,1579883625.0,"I love the last part.. people always flipping out about how many times so and so killed them. I dont even pay attention to who's killed me or with what, I know that's a little detrimental to my game play... but it isnt to my mental health"
DestinyTheGame,fffgii7,t1_ffeudaa,1579883460.0,"Omg yes! So much while I'm streaming I come across people like this. They just complain and blame the fact that they are on console. But I dunno my bf playing on console or pc he still carries the team. Dont get me wrong tho, hes bad for blaming them for his losses too, but hes getting better and realizing it's not the game. You really just have to get better or let it go. 

I choose to let it go and keep playing, cant get better if I dont play"
Twitch,fffbxw1,t3_etasya,1579880586.0,What about fitbit versa

NintendoSwitch,ffdi81p,t1_ffd5oks,1579821412.0,I played on my laptop in bed.. pretty dang comfortable. I've got 400 hours on lap top and about 100 on my switch. Love that game.
Twitch,ffc46mp,t1_ffb9hha,1579791106.0,Just bring rude for the sake of it. I bet you're gonna tell me you're a good person. You're not.
aww,ffao8le,t1_ffac3e0,1579740597.0,I do. Is that bad?
Twitch,ffa5tzm,t1_ff9qf23,1579728463.0,Well you're getting all offended for no reason. OP answered the question. With out being offended
Twitch,ff7m0jv,t1_ff75509,1579652754.0,It's a question. There was no assuming anything.
Twitch,ff6r721,t1_ff6n1ma,1579633176.0,Well then. Sucks when you're given the shite end of the stick.
DestinyTheGame,ff66nb7,t1_ff66129,1579620401.0,Nope. I got banned from a sub for saying not all girls who play cod are bitches... they disagreed in mass numbers... so I guess all girls who play are ...

Twitch,ff64tkn,t1_ff5vann,1579619147.0,No this is the same as working but not collecting pay. Twitch will still produce a tax form at the end of the year.
Twitch,ff64okr,t1_ff5ti7m,1579619048.0,"That's not how life works.

ChoosingBeggars,ff3b1nq,t1_ff2vfoc,1579537690.0,"That and where I work we bag up about 30 pounds of wings or whatever the par is for the day, all at once. Not to order. That would take too long. So to ask for separated wings would mean getting the giant 80 pound bin out and a scale to pick out specific wings."
ChoosingBeggars,ff3anl4,t1_ff285gc,1579537495.0,I work in a kitchen. And it is a big deal to have to grab the 80 pound bin of wings out of the cooler and a scale in the back. All for one order. Normally you'd just reach down into the cooler below you and grab a pound of wings that were portioned this morning and drop in the fryer taking all of 2 mins. With separating them it takes a good 10 mins to set up the wing station mid shift.
ChoosingBeggars,ff3a86v,t1_ff2ajf5,1579537263.0,Ah my bf likes the drums and I like the flats. It's perfect.
ChoosingBeggars,ff39t6x,t1_ff1yagl,1579537044.0,Lol if you do just order it and pay eventually they just give you free drinks anyways.

Twitch,ff348kp,t3_erdzog,1579533274.0,I use the zoom and pan function on the logitech program on my stream. I can also change the flicker and turn off auto focus.
pokemon,ff33njx,t1_ff308dz,1579532848.0,I didn't buy the base game either.. but it was gifted to me.
Twitch,ff32v02,t1_ff2p25t,1579532245.0,Yep I used epoc cam and the quality was good using an iPhone se. But now I use a logitech c920
Twitch,ff32iby,t1_ff1pi6z,1579531976.0,I am really getting fed up with it. Reddit jumps to conclusions. If anyone has half a brain they would have seen my channel isnt even affiliated
Twitch,ff1mst9,t1_feyksfs,1579481771.0,Yep.
Twitch,ff1mrot,t1_feyvwa0,1579481756.0,That's not my mind set. Jesus reddit assuming so much.
Twitch,ff1mmy4,t1_fezrkue,1579481695.0,Yea. I really think everyone took what I said the wrong way. I have a job and work for a living. Streaming is a hobby for me.

mixer,fewe43a,t1_fevv13v,1579409063.0,Could be a cool stream to watch.
mixer,fewe0gt,t3_eqowko,1579409011.0,"I spend an hour every stream setting it up. I have a couch stream set up so there is only so much i can leave set up. Sound always seems to need to be adjusted, if I'm playing a different game then everything needs to be adjusted and checked. 

I haven't even touched on using bots yet. If I change my overlay its hours of me tinkering with it before I say to myself just stream already.

So yes! I feel you on the time spent off stream to stream is getting longer and longer."
mixer,fewdaqt,t3_eqr8zi,1579408697.0,How long did it take to get there. I am just about at affiliate but thinking I'll make the jump to mixer. The thing that worries me is the 2000 follower step. It took me a month and a half to get 46 on twitch. I haven't done as much marketing as I'd like. So I dont feel bad about 46 in a month and a half.
GirlGamers,fevoyzr,t1_fetur68,1579399817.0,"I would just stop with the generalization, I play these games and I've  never been rude to other girls just because I expect them to be rude. Just be nice to everyone, it's really not that difficult. If they are jerks, most games you can block them."
GirlGamers,fevoalb,t1_feserm3,1579399664.0,If it didnt have anything to do with the game you wouldn't have brought it up.

Dont think op knows what defensive means"
GirlGamers,fevnyj9,t1_fesgxpx,1579399544.0,"It's all about how you interpret the comment. If you come in here thinking everyone is attacking you that's how you'll read it. 

You're upset that I am not 100 percent agreeing with you. That's unfortunate.

 I just dont come across toxic people. Sorry that offends you some how. But I'm also not a sensitive leaf.

Also I am happy as a clam over here. You're the one who is bothered.

OP if you really think it matter what anyone on here thinks about me you're mistaken."
GirlGamers,fevmmwg,t1_feu1wod,1579399152.0,"Meh I'd just block and move on. Why stress about them, they probably dont even think about you anymore. Try and let it go and move on, no amount of sinking to their level is going to change them.

Edit and it really isnt."
GirlGamers,fevmd7l,t1_feum7ns,1579399065.0,It goes both ways. I've heard guys give each other shit. I haven't played with enough women to see that happen.
GirlGamers,fevm79p,t1_feup1cl,1579399001.0,"Did I say she was lying? No. I said when you come across assholes everywhere you go, maybe you're the asshole. Obviously in different words, but I guess it wasnt clear enough for you."
Twitch,fetrvu1,t1_fet04a4,1579379222.0,Playing with other people is what got me talking more during game play. Even when I'm not streaming I still try to be chatty. Lol unfortunately a lot of good content ends up happening off cam.
aww,fetrnc9,t1_fesx8j3,1579379057.0,The camera kinda flashed her in the face so she wasnt too happy to look my way after that. Oops

Sorry for your loss. But rules are rules."

GirlGamers,fesbpfm,t1_fes2nc2,1579363590.0,You're setting yourself up for failure by assuming that it's anything to do with the game.
GirlGamers,fesbjmt,t1_feqb54r,1579363536.0,... a pattern for her. Meaning shes the problem? I must have really good luck and haven't experienced toxicity in game.
GirlGamers,fesb0ha,t1_fes2hpz,1579363401.0,"It's going to seem like an attack, but its gotta be your attitude. If all the women you meet are mean.. there's gotta be a reason and no it's not because they are on CoD. I meet nice women on there sometimes. Yet to meet a toxic lady."
GirlGamers,fesahyz,t1_fepqbe5,1579363242.0,"Totally agree. I play cod and haven't come across toxic ladies or guys... but I also play with a streamer, so the crew he runs with are good people.
