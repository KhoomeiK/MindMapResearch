HVAC,fffa1gi,t3_etbinj,1579879370.0,"Sounds like a wiring fault, could also be the transformer is bad.  The 1v is current finding its way back to the source.  I would check to make sure all the wiring is visibly not compromised and also might take a meter while everything is powered off, check the cabling for continuity to ground.  Look close to any motors or other things that move/vibrate.  Intermittent problems are generally associated with moving parts."

whatisthisthing,ffdz2ea,t1_ffdxzbc,1579832500.0,"This is a 400 MHz antenna, for sure.  It being on the ground will make it not work because it cannot reflect off the ground.   It probably was mounted at some point If it was actually functional.

Edit: technically is 300-1300 MHz but I say 400 because that is a common band."
whatisthisthing,ffduaba,t1_ffds8wg,1579829093.0,"Yeah, I believe it’s missing 2 radials, should have 4.

Edit: maybe not.  It’s strange for sure.  I still wonder if it’s utility related!"
whatisthisthing,ffdrfo6,t3_et22ub,1579827099.0,400mhz antenna.  What it’s attached to could be a few things.  The previous owner may have had an fcc license and used it for radio.  It could also be for gas/water/electric metering if the meter is inside and gets poor RF.
