It's a very simplified mediation and it's a bit that explains how emotions add energy work through the body in a way that's not exaggerative yet approachable. 

The steps involve facing a fear ,  acknowledging actual negative aspects and forgiving yourself and letting go of attachment. It may help change the mindset.

3. Every night before sleep right before you pass out , tell yourself it was a good day and tomorrow will be great do it aldo when you wake up. Right as you do. 
It reframes how you face each one, try it for 3 days. 

Lookup CBT  as well , and or self exercises."

IWantToLearn,feznrep,t1_fexf8jt,1579459432.0,"Indeed , I'm in an area that devalues intelligent work and fair/living wages. I am avoiding unregulated debt or any debt. 
I've done those things and lack access to anyone with real ambition or drive that have ethics that are in tune with myself or have tact, i met 1 person that was just flat an arse with money no tact no diplomacy or people skills and devalued an entire gender and my job.  So insert expletive about him. 

My local CC is useless jobs sit on their website for years and I've tried consulting without any results they're tied into the low wage labor businesses.

My goals are not based sales/service/  , instead tech/arts/ other.

 It's a nice idea , though if i had access to that capital I'd make a movie in my attempt to transition out of poverty or into a better industry or at least an ethical one that pays a reasonable living wage even at entry level."

Check your Groupon for deals (found Florida ones for 127$ plus 25$ deposit). 
Don't stress , it's a thing sure but a bit of self reflection  isn't bad , self educate , be in the now not the past , let go of grievances and petty emotional baggage. 
Start preparing for the life you want and retirement."

AskReddit,fdlo3u9,t1_fdlmrs2,1578528450.0,"I see sales as unreliable , low wage driven or otherwise exploitative in some fashion. It can be exploitative on the employees and customers with unscrupulous practices however my limited experience is primarily car sales reps or southern good olboys that use nepotism to maintain. 
 
I can appreciate that a plan is need , it'd be easier to make a plan if basic jobs afforded the ability to make plans. I'm not persistently stressed but i never have the means to really plot."

IWantToLearn,fdll382,t1_fdljlkw,1578526450.0,"Context is king , this is Reddit and i was being quick verses worrying about every grammatical aspect in occurrence. 
There is a difference between personal and professional communications. 

Trust me i would not be asking for information on Reddit if i had other avenues. I'm almost comically not skilled enough for a ""real"" job and over qualified for basics. 

If i had resources like a living wage I'd be right to be knocked for complaining.  

I am annoyed moderately by that presumption on the promotions  aspect understandably i have a different view. In smaller more rural communities , promotions far and few between , nepotism keeps it this way likely by intent. 

I chose to not pursue more  within this company because they're unethical. They pay a less than living wage and complain if someone isn't 100% to uniform. Then the employees get ragged about them being a multimillion dollar company.  It's like Scrooge complaining about bad signatures even though the ink is frozen becausehe won't use coal to heat it up."

I've been in poverty my entire life so my question begs that how can i know what i want if I've only experienced negative/toxic work environments and the relationship with the construct of employment ?

I have ideas 1. Must be ethical at all levels 2. Must pay a living wage or better 3. Technical/technology related 4. Arts related 5. No selling at all 6. 0 customer interaction
 

At the moment my most immediate next job must be something I'll learn a profitable skill at , must pay a living wage and no sales/customer service at all. 

Is it selfish - kinda but I'm treating it the way I've been treated. 
Can it be framed differently sure but I'm being quick here."

That's not even an option only labor gets full-time and even then when I'm already working 22-35hrs max it's barely a 6k increase for more of my day , that's not a good deal at all and still can't afford an apartment.

selfimprovement,fcly55r,t3_ehlumt,1577759332.0,"Step 1  each day is an opportunity for a new start.
  
Start producing content weekly/daily as able
 Practice will increase quality

Maybe start a workout Regime even basics even if it's only 5 reps every day or 5 pushups 

Then find/follow producers/production comps via twitter/YouTube 
Engage them on their platform.

Research local business that uses video maybe they'll benefit from a music person on staff in a different position

Listen to Audiobooks on self development but be attentive to the ones that get scheme like
How to win friends and influence people is old and kinda a con but it's a good place to start

Get help 
Find a counselor or something to help on the path.

The fight is hard not because you're weak but because it's rigged that way for the benefit of the connected few and corporate greed"
AskReddit,fclxm2z,t1_fcluubn,1577758956.0,"The challenge is finding the right person and having the right question and fighting to figure out what the question is, yet being aware 98% of the challenge isn't motivation or any other fad blame like fear but our economy and low wages and getting out from underneath poverty unaware of how to hunt for real jobs that pay a living wage and i could wax on for a bit on that. Then getting the usual fodder responses like trades  or military both can be valid for some but not all. Be for what ever reason like ethics/age or cost association."
