Anxiety,ff4azau,t1_feiidfz,1579559406.0,"I read that you expanded a bit on how you feel about your job, fiancé, the incident where you passed out and the wedding planning.  I think it's very good that you identify these feelings and I think they all make sense.  I think it's normal to feel confused after passing out especially as the doctors didn't say anything was wrong and I definitely think that wanting the wedding to go well and having to plan everything can be a tremendous workload.  I think it's good that you recognize the wedding planner is helping.

>Therapy terrifies me. I don’t really know why. Maybe it’s because I don’t like opening up to people

I think that is very curious!  I would be interested in expanding on this, but it might be a bit too late for a reply (not sure if you'll end up seeing this).  I'm curious because I think you have been very honest in the past couple of posts and I think you genuinely want to be better.  So you seem to genuinely want to find some way to get better.

I'm curious if this is how you felt when replying and as such made the conscious effort to describe your situation even if you didn't feel comfortable doing it, or if you feel that somehow therapy would be different?

>Pretty much all of my friends and family think of me as a really happy and bubbly person \[....\]

It sounds from your description almost like you feel there is a slight difference between how others see you (happy and bubbly) and how you actually feel (at least at the current time, you seem to be feeling anxious and lacking the energy for social interaction).  I'm thinking then, are you worried that others might think negatively of you if they saw that to a certain degree there was this mismatch between how you appear to them and how you feel in reality?  Would you be worried then they would label you something like a ""fake""?  (I'm worried that you might find this slightly offensive, so I just want to emphasize that I definitely don't mean to have any hidden meaning to what I'm saying - I'm trying to be as honest and open about what I'm thinking as I can, so please feel free to correct me if I'm not understanding you correctly)

Or is it perhaps that you enjoy being the outgoing, happy, goofy person and now you feel that by having these negative emotions you won't be able to describe yourself in that way? So basically you like being happy and would much rather you were constantly in that state?

>It takes me a long time and even then I’m still really guarded about a lot.

I'm wondering if you've thought about why this might be the case?  I'm wondering if you feel like the other person will judge you or make a negative impression of you?  Sometimes I'm thinking this type of anxiety can happen from past relationships / childhood - if we were emotionally abused by people who used our own words and honesty against us, we learn (unfortunately) to not be open: it's very painful to be honest and truthful with someone (i.e. trusting them), only for that person to use that honesty against us.

> How can a therapist even help me if I’m too scared to tell them  anything. It’s so expensive and I feel like I’ll just be wasting my  money and their time because I won’t be able to say much.

I think you're perfectly right here!  I think it makes a lot of sense for you to not want to go to a therapist if you're afraid to tell them anything.  I think going to a therapist involves trust in that person and from what you are saying, it sounds like you might not feel comfortable trusting a therapist.

>Or how I go days without sleeping more than a few hours a night

I'm sorry to hear that, that must make you very tired and, as I'm sure you are aware, not getting enough sleep can affect one's mental health.  Basically I'm thinking it sounds like a spiral where your stress is preventing you from resting properly and by not resting properly you become more stressed and anxious.

>He wants me to go get help so I feel like I have to for him. And for me I guess.

I think that sounds reasonable, I would even encourage you to consider doing this more because of your own mental health rather than because of him wanting you to get help - of course, wanting to help our loved ones is also a perfectly valid reason.

I'm sorry for the late reply.  I hope you'll end up reading this.  If you do, I'm wondering how are you feeling now after a few days after the incident where you passed out?  Have you given more thought regarding speaking with a therapist?

Best Wishes!"
Anxiety,fei7sxv,t3_ep6wob,1579132197.0,"TLDR, I think the best advice is to go with the doctor's recommendation.

However, from reading your post, it sounds like you are very scared about what happened.  It also sounds like there are a number of factors at play - please bear in mind this is my understanding of what you wrote, please do correct me if there's anything wrong/not accurate:

first there's your fiancé loss of his job which it seems has put you under a lot of pressure to keep your own job, even though you seem to not like it.

second there was the incident where you passed out and had to be rushed to the hospital which sounds like a very scary situation because you might've had a concussion, but also nerve racking because the passing out might've been caused by something more serious?

third, there's the wedding planning which I'm guessing puts additional stress on both of you: both financially because your income currently is halved, but also I'm guessing emotionally as it is an important event and presumably you want to go as well as possible?

fourth, it sounds like you are scared about what the outcome of seeing the psychotherapist might be?

You say that ""I think they will think I’m crazy.""  I'm curious why do you think that?

>I don’t want to talk to someone about me

I'm curious why you think that?  Are you worried that by talking to someone, they misunderstand you and essentially (for lack of better words) write you off as an insane person which lost her grip on reality?  - I know it sounds harsh, but please believe me when I say I'm not trying to exaggerate or imply absolutely anything!   It's simply asking the question literally since you definitely seem stressed and I think would be nice to offer some form of support.  I think it would be helpful if people here can understand your thoughts better, hence the questions.

Finally it sounds like you don't want to be a burden on others and hence you are taking responsibility for improving your mental health, hence why you are here?  I'm wondering if you feel pressured to do this?  Do you think your loved ones will not be able to share the burden with you?  Or are you simply trying to take part of the burden away from them?

Regarding advice, from my own experience, it's honesty and openness.  I've been speaking with a counselor for about a year and the main thing I like about it is that I can say anything!  I can say anything without fear of being judged or that my counselor will think I'm crazy.  In fact, pretty much I've been proved the opposite: the counselor is supportive and tries to understand things from my point of view.  This understanding has helped me realise that actually I'm not crazy (I hope!),  that my emotions are sometimes justified and that other times they are not.  But even when they're not, I realise that, and I realise why they aren't justified.

Hope this helps & do feel free to reply if you want with your thoughts"
socialanxiety,fcjv2js,t3_ehir4w,1577706164.0,"I think as others have said, the existence of this community is a good step towards a solution. For me I think it was (and still is) speaking with a counsellor. It is a very relaxing and encouraging feeling when I can tell somebody how I feel without fear of being judged or experiencing repercussions at a later date - this is something I have noticed with at least a couple of people close to me: I say something when I'm angry or emotional and only after some time (days, weeks, months) they bring it up, usually through something mean that they do. This creates fear and anxiety because I never know how people will react in the long run.

Having a supportive community such as this one, the discord server or a counsellor is the main requirement. The second one is be open and share your thoughts & feelings. Hopefully somebody will genuinely listen or will try to understand you. It might not happen with the first post, it might not happen for some time. However what's important is never blame yourself for other peoples' behaviour / answers. The only thing you can do is be honest.

Books have also helped. Some of the ones I've read (and are by no means complete guide):

\- Coparenting with a Toxic ex by Paul R. Fine (for unhealthy behaviour of parents)

\- The Emotionally Abusive Relationship by Beverly Engel (for unhealthy behaviours in a relationship)

\- Should I Stay or Should I Go by Ramani Durvasula (same as above)

\- Principles by Ray Dalio (regarding radical honesty and general life principles)

\- Where Should We Begin by Ester Perell (for examples of healthy & unhealthy communication)

Hope this helps!"
socialanxiety,fca27fw,t1_fc6us6z,1577561943.0,">Yeah I'm not able to talk about sensitive topics with any of my friend or family member except my mother but sometimes it's difficult with her for other stuff.

I'm thinking this sounds like there's a limitation in the communication between you and the ones closest to you.  This kind of limitation I'm thinking can make you anxious when becoming close with others because from this view, it's essentially ""uncharted territory"".  This can make it even more difficult to actually *find* somebody to talk about anything.  I.e. limited communication with friends & family -> unfamiliarity with very close relationships -> difficulty in forming a close / strong / loving connection with someone because lack of experience.  Would this make sense?

>I don't think it's really their fault maybe it's just difficult for me \[to\] find someone with which I'm able to open myself

I think this is a very healthy insight.  It sounds like you are taking responsibility for your situation, but in a constructive way.  I say this because you recognise that you might be the one having difficulty, which I think is definitely a step in the right direction.  Note that this is different from blaming yourself, which you don't seem to be doing (which again, I think is great)

> It is difficult to find someone that really listen to you and not make you feel annoying, so someone who understand you.

Indeed it is, so I'm thinking it would be good to unpack this: you say someone that would not make you feel annoying.  It sounds like you are worried / get the feeling of being annoying when speaking with others?  Does this happen with everybody or only with certain people?

Regarding others understanding us, we need to be aware that many times people are really bad at understanding others.  This doesn't mean that they don't want to.  Because we're social creatures, people like to form bonds, so ideally they would like to understand us.  What happens usually I'm thinking is that one or both parties aren't skilled enough in communication which causes the other party to not understand them.  Would this make sense?  In this case, it might be very difficult to find somebody which such great listening skills that they understand you without any effort, however you can minimise that risk by improving your own communication."
socialanxiety,fc9yt23,t3_egry6m,1577560242.0,">I wanna be able to enjoy hanging out with people, connect with them,

I think that's a good introspection.  It sounds like you know what you would like the desired outcome to be, which is to get rid of the feeling that socialising is a chore.  I think this is helpful because you can start considering how you can progress towards that goal.

>A shitty day can turn into a not so shitty day just by seeing a person you're close with, go for a cup of coffee or a beer and chat...

I think you are absolutely right.  It sounds like you actually value socialising and consider it very important.  So it sounds like the only obstacle in your way is this annoying feeling that it is a chore.  As cheesy as this may sound, I'm thinking let's work on that!  I'm wondering if you've given any thought on why you might be feeling this way?  Clearly you hold social interaction in high regard, so I'm wondering what is preventing you from feeling happy when socialising because you are doing something healthy?

>I hate myself for being like this. I feel broken

From your message it sounds like you would like to go out if only it weren't for the negative feelings you get.  Would it be fair to say that this causes frustration (hence why you say that you hate yourself)?  I'm also thinking it also makes sense for you to feel that there's something wrong with you (broken) because from your own description, socialising is good for the mind / spirit, so probably you are wondering ""why would the same mind consider it a chore?"".  So almost like ""why would the mind be sabotaging itself""?"

socialanxiety,fc6tbah,t3_egherd,1577488951.0,"Hey there!  Would you like to expand a bit please?  It sounds like you feel bad when your friends are having fun with their friends.  Is this because you feel like you are lacking other friends so interact with?

>I just hope someday I will find a group of friend that love me or even a special person who I can spoke to about everything

From this is sounds like you don't feel particularly close to anybody.  I'm wondering what do you think about your current friends or maybe even family?  Do you feel like they don't love you / it is difficult to speak with them about more sensitive topics?"
socialanxiety,fc6ry56,t3_egdwhz,1577487953.0,">I do not understand how people can do stuff like this all the time.

So do you mean that, from your point of view, these kinds of activities are difficult and require a lot of mental effort and you don't understand how other do this on a regular basis without being anxious / worrying / thinking about it?

I think people don't worry about this.  I don't know what others think, but it might be that for other people social interaction doesn't cause a lot of mental effort.  Also, I'm thinking there are people that might've found socialising difficult initially, but with maybe with things like lots of practice now they might make it appear easy.

>How do I act when she gets in the car? Do I get out to give her a hug? What do i say after ""Hi How are you?"" What else is there to talk about?

I think those are valid questions.  Just to make sure it's clear, it sounds like you are wondering what you *should* do in those situations right?  If that's the case, I'm wondering if you have given any thought regarding what would you *like* to do in those situations.  e.g. what would you like to do after she gets in the car?  or whether you would like to hug her, etc.

>I am the driver and the reason we are all going so i have to make conversation.

It sounds like you are thinking it is your responsibility to make conversation, right?  It also sounds like you believe you have that responsibility because you are the driver and the reason you are going to see your friends.  I'm having trouble seeing how these mean that you are the one responsible for making conversation, could you expand please?

>This is why I never invite people to hang out. It is a lot easier to stay home.

Indeed, it does sound like this is fairly difficult for you because it sounds like it's mentally draining and causes you a lot of anxiety.

socialanxiety,fc0etdc,t3_efh3lq,1577288941.0,"It sounds like you are going through something super difficult.  Like it sounds almost like a vicious circle?  social anxiety -> less social interaction -> less social life -> social anxiety because you feel like somebody on the fringe of society.

I think what you said is a good starting point and I think it would be helpful if you could expand so that myself and others can have a better understanding of what you are going through.

Also from your description ""I feel like an outcast,as if I am on the fringe of society"", it sounds like you view society as one big (for lack of better word) ""blob"", with most people inside society and others like yourself outside of it.  Is my understanding correct? (please do correct me if this is inaccurate: I'm only making assumptions here based on how I interpret your words)"
