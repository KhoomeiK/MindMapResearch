To be clear, I do think it reflects on the person's character that they'd even want to do this, so the 2 women that tried this with me didn't last very long, for different, yet not unrelated reasons.

To be clear my current GF does know my passcode, and I hers; but I trust she has never ever gone through my texts, and the few times I grab her phone is either out of browsing convenience, or to set something up for her."
AskMen,ffwd07a,t3_evay0q,1580296007.0,"Do you not have an acced code on your phone?

How does the usual conversation go when a new GFasks for the passcode for the first time?

I haven't been in new relationships for a while,but the few times this came up it was something like:

- hey babe, what's your passcode?

- why do you want my passcode?

- silence"
