aww,fecxzcu,t3_eocfa7,1578989205.0,Or is this a low key pic of your dad playing the fingers game and we all just lost?

wow,fdk7vqg,t1_fdk44mq,1578498089.0,"So basically in Warhammer 40k, to get around they use gateways. These gateways are basically are to a hellish realm. The only reason they are able to 'safely' use these is due to pyshcers able to put up sheilds to block out the demonic stuff. I dont know a huge amount just sort of the basics.

So it could be said this was the first time in the 40k universe they used this tech. Because they didnt have the pyschers to rely on, everyone goes crazy/possesed and kill each other. More blood for the blood god!(Khorne)"
wow,fdhzr9o,t3_elaeql,1578433141.0,I still love the idea that Event Horizon is the lore about how the universe of Warhammer 40k got started.

politics,fco2jxp,t1_fco1bim,1577822878.0,actually oligarchs developing from capitalism is a failed capitalistic system. Smith warned that an unregulated free market with no controls would lead to it. Especially if you just look to the benefit of owners/shareholders and ignore the stake holders.
aww,fcmgch0,t1_fcm620v,1577774216.0,"Yes I am sure, youtube lost a lawsuit because they were 'advertising' to kids 'without them knowing they were advertised to or what it meant.' is the basic of what I understand. So anything that is aimed or youtube feels will be mainly for the young kid crowd, no monies or comments.

Comment part is from I am pretty sure when people were putting links in comments either about the vid or a similar one that usually had a time stamp with questionable content at those times."
gout,fcmek0h,t3_ehyfc9,1577772391.0,"I am currently trying to apply for disability for my gout. Usually it is not able, however I have it extensively in my ankles/arches of my feet, wrist, and elbows. AKA 'load bearing joints' one of the few ways that any type of arthritis can qualify you for disability as far as I have been able to find out.

But I dont see how I can work, I can't stand for any period of time, can hardly walk far. Cant grip/hold things very well cause where it is in my wrist its like a really bad version of carpal tunnel. So this is a very important thing to try, however im going in with the mindset first couple times I might get declined.  


Got to remember, most people have very little to no actual knowledge of gout."
aww,fclxzgt,t1_fclwckf,1577759222.0,could have been tagged as a kid friendly stream. Those I think aren't able to be monetized and comments are automatically disabled.
