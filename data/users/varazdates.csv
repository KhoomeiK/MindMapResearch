Unexpected,ffemb9j,t3_et27tz,1579854225.0,Need context! These two must have grown up together. No one would be filming so calmly. Panthers aren't social. And they have natural fear of humans. There's gotta be more to this.

science,ffd7cmt,t3_eswz5j,1579814840.0,Fact is....banning guns won't stop murders because criminals don't care about the law. They'll get illegal black market firearms and use those. And there will be PLENTY illegal gun dealers if guns get banned because there will be a demand. This isn't even a topic to be discussing. We are bordered with Mexico. It's out of the question. The only thing that will happen is law abiding citizens won't have a means to protect themselves with. Like the Texas church shooting.

facepalm,ff42taq,t3_epaonn,1579554311.0,"""So in wwii you would....""whoop, nope. Not playing your little game. You grab an example of your choosing that makes my statement ridiculous and try to use that to counter argue. No, we're not doing that. What I am saying, and this is exactly what it was in reference to, was that I'd rather have someone be somewhat passive about both tragedies than have someone extremely passionate and sincere about one tragedy and completely disrespect and undermine a very similar tragedy just because the country in question is different. That's dirty. Because on one hand you have just a kind of shitty person, on the other hand you have a shitty person who is also sneaky and snake like. Because in the end it means he truly doesn't care about either and he's just faking it.

You find offense to Trump but not Obama when Obama also did not recognize the genocide. Why the double standard on the same issue?

If we truly don't need Turkey, USA didn't get the memo. Every time we do something slightly offensive they threaten to remove our bases. And every time they do something slightly offensive we threaten them with recognizing the Armenian genocide as an ace in the hole in a completely disrespectful and trivial manner for political gain. Completely spitting on the graves of over a million souls and millions more descendants by dangling this tragedy like a toy. And it's been going on for over a century."

facepalm,feo3zpz,t1_fenl066,1579294815.0,"I don't see a difference in open praise versus praise behind closed doors. Matter of fact I'd rather have a sincere enemy over a deceitful friend. Obama praised Erdogan plenty. If you ask my honest opinion, I don't think Obama nor Trump actually like Turkey or Erdogan. We just need them. But there's a big difference in denying Genocide on one hand, and showing so much sympathy for another Genocide on the other."

Again liberal reddit doesn't fail to disappoint lol. I state a blatant fact that any one with half a brain can acknowledge, and get downvoted. Simple to understand the fact that it's not about caring, it's about politics. Israel is an ally, so we recognize and give them respect and sympathy for their tragedy. Turkey is also an ally, so we shit on Armenia and say screw their pain and suffering and disrespect over a million dead souls along with the whole nation. Good job reddit."

Adelaide Byrd was complete bullshit, have all gotten over it and left. And the Canelo fans are all in here having a party with themselves jerking each other off lol. You guys are fuckin morons honestly. Ur boy juices. Golden boy promo is a mafia. How far do you guys have ur heads up your ass? Next you’re gna tell me that the kovalev fight wasn’t rigged hahahaha. All kovalev did was jab for 12 rounds and touch gloves 2 times every round. Why? Cuz he wanted to expose. Because even if he fought a hard fight and it was close or he was winning...HE WOULDNT GET IT ANYWAY. Russians not winning in the USA. I’m worried for Loma. Oh you thought we lived in a fairy tale world where there’s no corruption? Awww how cute.

Don’t correct me on Loma being Ukrainian and ggg being a Kazakh. Ggg is half Russian and part Korean, not even a real Kazakh. Loma doesn’t speak Ukrainian, he speaks Russian."

baduk,fcovdac,t3_ei7e8k,1577842600.0,"Having stones on the board does not give you territory if said stones can be captured. All your stones can be captured. You guys just ended the game because you can foresee the result. If you continued to play, the entire board would be white. You have zero stones that would actually remain on the board if you played the game all the way through. It’s just pointless to play it. And so as a result you have stones on the board but they are not viable."
Boxing,fcouxcg,t3_ei42pa,1577842248.0,"Pretty good with some key points missed and mistakes. First of all one of the main key points is the fact that the rib cage does not entirely protect the liver like it does with other organs. For some odd reason, the rib cage did not develop far down enough and so about 1 inch or so of the liver is actually completely exposed and not protected by the ribs. This is usually the sweet spot and the “button” for the liver shot. [liver under rib cage](https://images.app.goo.gl/Yrr48PMHge4xwzgy7) 

The mistake being that in all the years of boxing I have never seen a liver shot result in passing out. What happens is that your body causes you to become so immobilized that you involuntarily fall to the floor in order to be as leveled and flat on the ground as possible for the circulation of blood to the brain, as was pointed out in the video."
