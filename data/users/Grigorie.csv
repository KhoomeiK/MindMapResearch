If you TRULY cannot afford the $11 to pay for a month of membership, then spending 12+ hours grinding for 14 days of membership via bond is not good time management at all. That’s no bash to people who are struggling financially/underage. Just that grinding out millions of GP in F2P is an easy way to get burned the hell out and not want to play anyway."

2007scape,feqkhtq,t1_feqk96q,1579342928.0,"Yeah, for the majority of things you progress into in Members, there's usually still *some* F2P quest requirement for it. Or, at the very least, you'll want the easy quest points from F2P quests to progress toward RFD."

Just get members, my guy. If you're even slightly enjoying the game, just do it. It makes life so much easier, I will never understand why people think they need to ""be ready"" for members."

gaming,fejgdzz,t1_fejg7um,1579172983.0,"I never saw anything from the creator saying that the shell is Caucasian. But the creator additionally said that even if it was unquestionable that the character was Japanese, he wouldn't see an issue with Scarlett playing her.

That obviously becomes a conflict of ""creator's intent"" vs. peoples' feelings, but that's a different discussion to be had."
gaming,fejfe5y,t1_fejf3sd,1579171541.0,"Without a doubt, she *could* have been. But, as far as my relatively limited understanding was, at the point of the show taking place, with locale involved and context, she was Japanese.

In the film, she **is** Motoko Kusanagi. She **is** a shell represented as Japanese in Japan. Explicit origin aside, as far as I've been able to find, everything involving her history, whether it's flashbacks or talking about any memories, were either ambiguous, or still being Japanese/in Japan.

Again, it's *relatively* nitpicky, because the entire 2017 film is an American film, but honestly, had they just used Ghost in the Shell as a reference point of the world and made a new story for a new Jane Doe to go off of, it would've gone over better with people who were upset. It's just silly to me to put a wig on Scarlett Johansson and tell me she's a Motoko Kusanagi."

But I don't think it was weeaboos, or at least strictly. I thought it was a dumb decision because it was a very unquestionably Japanese character, in Japan, which means it's a job lost to an otherwise unrepresented demographic in cinema; an Asian lead female actress.

It was a great opportunity for someone to (potentially) have a break-out role that would fit with the source material, and instead it gets given to Scarlett Johansson for unknown reasons that ultimately equate to ""big name to promote film,"" which isn't a bad tactic at all. But it sucks for the hundreds of female Japanese actors that could've had a chance to play a ""representative"" character as a lead role."

The fact that there are tens of thousands of people who don't know the difference is *absolutely* goofy. Toxicity is never something to be proud of. Even *if* most people are brain-dead, being toxic about it just screams emotional immaturity, and I'd rather deal with a stupid person than a raging one.

Being toxic to give advice will 9 times out of 10 cause the person you're saying it to to either become defensive and explicitly not take that advice, or be toxic back. It's actually never the solution. And obviously, none of this is directed at **you,** I don't know your gaming past. Just speaking in general."

I do the usual (probably low tier tactics) sweeping-but-crossing the map, trying to get to the other side relatively fast while checking the gens with sound as I pass them.

JUST before I get to the gen roughly opposite of me, boom. It's done. Just two people on it, while two others were somewhere else getting a gen to half. I *get* why it happens, but it just **feels** bad to lose a gen or 1.5 gens with next to no counterplay options, besides like.. bee-lining for the opposite end of the map every time? It's probably just me being bad, but it just *feels* bad to just lose a gen with nothing I can do about it unless they're slowed down in some way."
