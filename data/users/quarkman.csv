taiwan,ff6a2mx,t1_ff60kjq,1579622647.0,I think it's probably good etiquette to wear a mask everywhere. Nobody likes a person coughing on them in the MRT.
SpaceXLounge,ff586ts,t1_ff3tnnb,1579583091.0,Those panels aren't digital. They're for monitoring and controlling air pressure and contain analog guages and valves.
spacex,ff55wlq,t3_erhvuf,1579581130.0,Too bad you weren't able to get a shot of the big explosion in the sky. Your shot of it would truly have been epic.
SpaceXLounge,feyudpb,t3_eqy7l1,1579450637.0,What did you expect? It's the Independent.

taiwan,fevy1i8,t1_fevbn4e,1579402976.0,"How does that make any sense? It doesn't make me think that at all. This makes me think you don't understand democratic elections.

A not insignificant number of people will vote for the party or against a party. If anything, 38% is a small number for a party vote.

Furthermore, this was a three-way election. I'm surprised nobody ever brings up the third party, but that's probably due to most comments trying to downplay the election.

The third party would draw votes away from the most ideologically similar candidate as a vote for the third party is an indication of dislike for the main candidates. In this case, the orange party is more similar to the KMT than the DPP. This means most of the votes for the Orange party would have gone Blue and not Green. Even then, the DPP wins, so it isn't all a protest vote against Han.

If anything, the large percentage is a vote against China. The KMT tries to be close to China and in this case it worked against them pretty badly. The people of Taiwan really are afraid the One Country, Two Systems idea is untenable in the long run. The disinformation blitz and Hong Kong have shown them China are unable to handle it when somebody opposes their ideology."

spacex,feqyuq1,t1_feqqayn,1579347648.0,Is this some of the first peeps we've heard about the fate of the Starliner schedule? I know a lot of people are curious if there will be any serious delays.

SpaceXLounge,fek7jfi,t3_epj3pr,1579194243.0,Interesting to see them build the factory around the rocket as they're building it. just gives a sense of the parallelism of the effort.
spacex,feg0k3s,t1_fef6fj7,1579071798.0,"At that point, there will likely be massive telescope platforms constantly scanning the sky. Scientists will get the data and look for interesting signals from that instead of ground based telescopes.

This will all be funded by the government in self defense to scan for signs of the life that we detected on a nearby star."
California,fecrjuh,t3_eodue0,1578981924.0,"When I first arrived in CA from OR, I wondered where in the store I return bottles.

taiwan,fecqt90,t1_fecgn2k,1578981198.0,"Generally by choosing to recognize the government in exile in Taiwan as a valid government. They may also choose to recognize China as a valid government, but much more likely China would break off diplomatic relations and try to exert economic pressure."
taiwan,fe9i2hf,t1_fe917fh,1578937718.0,"China is Trump's strongest position. For everything else, he has been terrible. He uses fear and demagoguery to divide the country and has an us vs them approach to everything. He also makes decisions irrationally and doesn't try to think about the legal framework to get done what he wants. Only after doing something does he try to come up with a legal argument."

taiwan,fe6fs0u,t1_fe6727z,1578889572.0,"China claims any land which can been seen as a part of the Chinese empire from the Qing dynasty. It's why they lay claim to so much, including a large portion of the South China Sea.

In reality, it's just an easy excuse to be expansionist without appearing to be imperialist, at least internally."
California,fe0ak73,t1_fdxyu3t,1578807830.0,"It needs to be made less easy to abuse. It shouldn't make a project significantly more expensive when a group decides they don't like a project and use CEQA to sue to stop a project.

Sure, we need to do the analysis, but once the analysis is done, we shouldn't spend years in court just to determine if it was done enough."
California,fe0a92j,t1_fdz2zu2,1578807542.0,"Trump voters are conservative. They believe it's better to do what they already know and understand than to try something new. They know gas works. They know having a green lawn will keep them in good social standing. They know owning a single family home is the best way to offer a good life for their kids. They know not changing habits is safe and comfortable.

Liberals are telling them they must change which is scary and uncertain. This is especially true for the older generation."
teslamotors,fdvx1ge,t3_en4nbb,1578752664.0,I bought Tesla stock with the money I would have spent on FSD. My growth is much more than the increase in price.
bayarea,fdu2epz,t1_fdti5v9,1578726311.0,I bought a Zume pizza once just to try it out and they gave out coupons. I found it subpar and not very good. Never would order it again. I'm not surprised they exited the pizza business.
SpaceXLounge,fdpppbz,t3_emep8t,1578635859.0,It would be great to see the exhaust plume in a high speed footage. The way it jumps around in this video shows some very intense interactions. Also the way the sound is impacting the exhaust is interesting to watch.
SpaceXLounge,fdfbs1k,t1_fdehhnz,1578357967.0,"It's a pretty good metric when it comes to complexity of the constellation. Each satellite must be tracked, reported, and controlled individually. This means that a satellite operator with a single massive satellite has an easier job than SpaceX."
SpaceXLounge,fddheux,t1_fddg3s6,1578312390.0,"It is really hard. A common way to render exhaust is by particles. If the particles move too fast, they become separated and you get that weird effect where you see individual cloud particles unless an obscene number of particles is used. This slows down the simulation.

To get it correct requires a fluid dynamics simulation with voxel rendering. With the speed of the exhaust, I'd imagine inaccuracies would creep in quickly."
SelfDrivingCars,fczlsme,t1_fcz5oz0,1578104021.0,"The Bay Area has a congestion tax, but they don't call it that. As a single occupant vehicle, it's possible to use the carpool lane if you have a FasTrak transponder. You get charged a rate based upon current traffic conditions. In many areas, you have to pay a toll to use a freeway. There, too, it's common to use transponders with an adjustable rate."

electricvehicles,fcsy9ep,t1_fcsm9xx,1577928130.0,Nah. Watch the video. They added tacky acceleration sounds and in one scene even added a roar sound very reminiscent of an ICE engine starting.

programming,fcp214v,t1_fcoora4,1577848054.0,C++ has mostly swallowed the C market share. Stuff that was written in TurboPascal would more likely be done in Java or Python with some C++. C has mostly been relegated to small SOC applications.
todayilearned,fcmdnx9,t1_fcl1ggz,1577771544.0,My nose isn't very good (accident when I was young). I've drunk old curdy milk doing that. The expiration date gives me a better sense of when things may be bad.

dataisbeautiful,fbiez6q,t1_fbicd4v,1576899080.0,"Depends on which cars you're comparing. The cheapest Model 3 is just under $40k. This means that it would cost the same as a $20k car to buy.

Once you account for the savings in gas and maintenance, the savings add up very quickly. On Model 3, I've spent less than $100 on maintenance over 1.5 years."
