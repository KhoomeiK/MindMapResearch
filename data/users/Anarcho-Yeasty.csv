How about we stop worrying about the GOP and what they are going to do.

Also fuck your last paragraph. Disingenuous piece of shit that is right there. Where is Warren's healthcare law she passed? Oh right she also hasn't passed anything through the Senate for it. Meanwhile she expects to pass not 1 but 2 comprehensive healthcare laws. And that will off course pass easier than 1 law. Because..... No wait it won't be any easier. At all."
