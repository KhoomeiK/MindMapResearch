politics,fglmpde,t1_fgll4ti,1580904625.0,"Exactly.  Even the GDP is rather tepid given the cost.  All that money ended up doing was inflating stock prices and the stock market is what many people equate with a “good economy”.

We’re screwed if we ever want to decrease the deficit because it’s going to tank the stock market.  We’re also screwed if we don’t."

PurplePillDebate,fgiccd2,t1_fgibca6,1580816535.0,So you’re suggesting that OKCs results were due to differences in men’s and women’s definitions of average?  Men consider only women in their distribution whereas women consider both men and women?
PurplePillDebate,fgibwce,t1_fgibbd4,1580815982.0,"And again it comes back to being my fault because it’s a result of my misogyny, not the fact that I’m worthless and that NOBODY cares about my issues.  

Perhaps in your case it felt like an isolated incident because it was an isolated incident for you and you had people around who supported you."
PurplePillDebate,fgias9b,t1_fgi80b7,1580814501.0,"Aren’t you proving OPs point?  Your not addressing how women treat men’s grievances, your just excusing them and blaming it on the man again.  My ex-wife did this to me all the time.  Whenever I mentioned any grievance, she would always come up with a reason why it was my fault.  I eventually learned to just keep quiet.

As a man, I’ve come to learn that nobody cares about me and my problems.  If I have issues, I’m the one who needs to “man up” and get over it.  I go through life constantly feeling like a worthless piece of shit."

TwoXChromosomes,ffbymvs,t3_esqyid,1579786911.0,"Understandable.  In my marriage, my wife was the messy one (like hoarders messy) and I did all the housework despite both of us working full time jobs.
