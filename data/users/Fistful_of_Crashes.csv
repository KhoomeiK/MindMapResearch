If the purpose is to eventually specialize, more effort needs to be put into finding the child’s forte. As it stands (at least in my district) you’re required to meet with your advisor once a semester in high school, every semester. That’s simply not enough, and the students were never encouraged to branch out and experiment with subjects they truly enjoy or are at least competent at.

We test and test, but we don’t think about what they want. And at the end of the day, is that not the purpose of a free society?

Idk, I don’t have all the answers, our system is barely passable in its current state, but we need to pour more resources into education instead of building thousands of tanks and fighter jets we’ll never use. We’re the most powerful nation, but certainly the dumbest given our resources, and that is dangerous."

Kids don’t have a choice, really, when it comes to schooling. So they act out *literally* to keep sane because of how monotonous “education” can be. At least here in the states.

Ideally, we’d be able to find out what the child enjoys AND is good at, and streamline their learning experience to optimize a life around that subject/field.

But setting people up to fail is faaaaaaaaaaaaaar more profitable, so we make getting to this point unnecessarily difficult, leading to the high drop-out rates that inevitably end with a low-paying job, and hope that they bullshit their way into something they’re ok at.

The recoil reduction, accuracy up and other stats would be the real draw to keeping your character competitive.

Cycle, run, and swim to be able to sprint faster.

Play sports, workout at the gym, and get into fights to have super strength, and take highly reduced damage to melee attacks.

Go to the range with a friend to get faster reloads, less kick on weapons, etc.

Right now, you just grind till its 100 and forget its even a mechanic in the game to begin with. Interesting, but since they never decay, they might as well give you perfect stats to begin with :/"
