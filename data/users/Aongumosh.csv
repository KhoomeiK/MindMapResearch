OP stated her dog was freaking out. Bringing *any* dog on public transport is already iffy behavior at best. They are unbelievably stressful for dogs, because they weren’t designed with dogs in mind. They are loud, there are lots of strangers, and they lurch and move suddenly. 


And the fact that it’s a Pit only makes it worse. Of course dog behavior is a result of breed and training. Nature and nurture.

From the ASPCA:

> Today’s pit bull is a descendant of the original English bull-baiting dog—a dog that was bred to bite and hold bulls, bears and other large animals around the face and head.  When baiting large animals was outlawed in the 1800s, people turned instead to fighting their dogs against each other. These larger, slower bull-baiting dogs were crossed with smaller, quicker terriers to produce a more agile and athletic dog for fighting other dogs."
