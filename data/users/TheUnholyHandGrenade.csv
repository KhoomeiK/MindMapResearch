The fact is, in any kind of small-group fights (let's define that as a fight between two or so groups with between 2 or more combatants on each group), a fight between two combatants will boil down to skill, while a situation where a third member is added on the side that has less skill or history can make a battle swing in favor of the less skilled simply because of numerical advantage. And we see that in the fights in this episode; in each one, the fight was immediately turned the second they added a second member into a certain fight.

As for the skill aspect, I don't know if they really are that much more skilled, especially in person to person combat. They're amazing at Grimm, yes, but Grimm and humans--especially Huntsmen--are different kettles of fish."

Imagine a half-sentient, extra-galactic alien race with bug features and an insatiable appetite for organic matter, with a habit of quickly and frequently evolving to fight whatever opponent they are dealing with--superhuman demigods of war hundreds of years old, their traitorous, demonically-infused cousins, normal humans who come at you in the millions and die by the thousands, millennia-old space elves, orcs made of fungus and able to turn a cardboard box and some cans into a superweapon just on belief, alien robots that existed before the dinosaurs even evolved and eat stars, beings made of Hell made physically manifest--all of that and more they can evolve to combat, coming in swarms of hive-minded creatures from as small as the bullets their bioguns use to the size of skyscrapers.

RWBY,fdplvm0,t3_emcw4g,1578632288.0,"There was a stillness over the city as the gleaming tower rose up into the sky. Most couldn't believe it, having seen it's destruction. Armies of rivals seethed furiously at its return, a defiance that they believed must be corrected. The gold spire slipped up into the sky like a great dagger of sunlight beaming as its twin reformed, baring the Two Lovers aloft in their stony gaze into the bright morning sky. The city seemed to light up with terror, anger, hope and joy as the Pillar rose into the air.


The Inferno Wardens stared up from their evacuation point on the far side of the city, their number depleted to just under 30 Astartes as civilians they had saved, all of them noble souls who swore allegiance to the God Emperor of Mankind and wished to depart this pagan place. But the sudden arrival of the spire sent shivers down many of their spines; was it Chaos cultists conjuring the dead with Warp-powered necromancy? Was it a trick of the eyes created by some deceptive cur to lure people into a trap?



From across the city, many could see a fleet of strange ships descending around the pillar, deploying even more of the superhuman soldiers around the fortress, an array of of markings of different colors against the metallic red, black and silver. Many of them bore trophy racks adorned with alien skulls freshly scalped and cleaned, while others wore cloaks and talismans made of the bones of monstrous creatures; the fight with the Grimm-like Tyranids had been a wash, the splinter fleet destroyed. The Reclusiarch had sent out a message to the Chapter, requesting more aid; he had been answered with the entire crusade of 300 additional Astartes descending on the fortress to hold the line.


The comms buzzed, the message that followed echoed across the airwaves, reaching the ears of many; u/BlueWhaleKing, u/Vaniellis, u/StrikeFreedomX2, any and all who could hear, and even some of the enemy heard the triumphant roar that echoed across the airwaves:

RWBY,fden0dm,t3_ekx8da,1578342451.0,"The rumors reached far and wide in the wake of Arkos' destruction. Few eyes didn't see the wake of fire that burned in the night like a second sun the last few nights. Every one of the sites it was seen at was a fortress that was quickly destroyed, its smoking ruins and charred, terrified corpses leaving a dark story. Men had been blown to smithereens by munitions too bulky for normal humans, fires burning longer and hotter than all, save the flames cast by Cinder Fall's acolytes. Most who saw the culprits were frightened by what they saw, and urged those who could to run for the wildlands, to flee the city and never return.

They spoke of just around fifty men--though whether they were truly human or not was up to debate purely from their size that matched Hazel, if not were larger--clad in armor of metallic crimson, ebon back pauldrons and bright silver markings. They were each as loud as artillery, thunderous voices calling for war in a tongue so foreign it matched none on records. They were steely in their demeanor until they were within range to charge, in which their voices turned the night into a cacophony of screams. Knives as long as shortswords were brandished, several recovered by members of factions that had also fought in the area; each one was as long as a man's arm and of a fine edge that seemed deceptively decorative with the amount of etchings revealed after scrubbing free caked mud and blood. A few pieces of armor were retrieved as well, deceptively light despite some pieces being the size and toughness of tank armor. Markings found on them confirmed their allegiance to Arkos, but even more were found in strange tongues, written on parchment, etched on pauldrons; eagles with two heads, swords engulfed in fire, things that were disconcerting in their nature, or to some laughably edgy. The markings of the Inferno Wardens, one of the Astartes chapters summoned to Arkos' defense alongside Captain u/Vaniellis and his Arc Knights.

The reports trickled on as some began to hunt this force down, though in the day they seemed to be unusually inactive for something so clearly bombastic.

Sergeant Thel stared at the map from the Inferno Wardens' temporary base with the Arkos survivors in Renora's citadel. Lines of activity crisscrossed the map, deceptively mobile.

""Where are you, Reclusiarch,"" he muttered as he pinched the bridge of his nose. ""What is your plan now...""

The Sergeant of the Second Company's 3rd Squadron, an Astartes named Franz, walked up to him. **""Lieuten-- 
er, *Captain* Bataar wishes to inform you that Captain Adresta has been successfully interrred into his sarcophagus. The Contemptor chassis is being readied as we speak.""**

Thel nodded. ""Noted. Any word from u/PuzzarianIdeal?""

**""None. His attention has been on the religious conflict.""**

""What about u/BlueWhaleKing?""

**""Silent.""**

Another nod, this time deep in contemplation. ""Reclusiarch u/TheUnholyHandGrenade would not lead an Inferno Protocol like this unless he had a plan... unless the fires were for another reason... scare tactics?""

**""Perhaps. Intimidate the opposition into keeping clear of Renora?""**

""He would mark the kill sites with the iconography of Renora then, not Arkos. Has he broken radio silence?""

**""No. None in the Second Brotherhood have,""** Franz replied, using the Chapter's term for a 50-man Demi-Company.

Thel grimaced as he turned back to stare at the board.

He dared not breathe in the fumes, lest he sour his stomach; where most promethium flames burned with the usual angry reds and yellows, the Inferno Wardens had long since synthesized a hotter, more dangerous breed of the chemical, mixed with the volcanic dust of their homeworld's obsidian spires. No water could put out the blaze save for a Category 4 hurricane, and even attempting to snuff it out would do nothing but burn yourself in the process. He realized he had gone overboard when hundreds of Freezerburn acolytes ran screaming from the burning fortress, wreathed in azure flames. Still, the missiles rained down, turning the citadel of ice and fire into a scorching pyre of cold-blue flames that turned steel soft as rubber.

No hymn was sung that night as the fire burned, casting the crimson red and bright silver of the Chapter's armorial in icy blues. No one had the heart for a hymn save mourning prayers. Something about this all seemed... off.

The Reclusiarch sat quietly in his tent, staring at the reports. The Pillar of Autumn was taking more and more attacks each day.

**Fool of a humanioid,""** he cursed as he glanced at u/BlueWhaleKing's letters. **""Bastard was too aggressive... now he has brought all of the other cults against us.""**

He grimaced as he stood up, beginning to pace. As Reclusiarch, rage and focus were his primary tools of rhetoric, but it was compassion that he had to keep as the spiritual leader and councilor of his Brothers. Already he had spoken with several who were of the mind to leave this battle and join the fight against the new Tyranid threat, this ""Salem's Brood"" as Inquisitor Andronicus had dubbed it on account of its Grimm-like color scheme. He didn't deny he could sympathize with their want. Still, they were here now, and they would at least remain as long as they could.

Now, however, he remained at a loss for what to do, his urge now to reinforce the defenses. And yet he wondered if the time for that was past.

**""Perhaps an alliance is in order,""** he muttered to himself as he turned his eye to the map of the city, zeroing in on Renora.

He didn't deny the existence of a soft spot in him for it as well.

And there are trillions--probably reaching quadrillions with the implied size of the main body of the Great Devourer--of these things bearing down on the galaxy of Warhammer 40k.

RWBY,fdplvm0,t3_emcw4g,1578632288.0,"There was a stillness over the city as the gleaming tower rose up into the sky. Most couldn't believe it, having seen it's destruction. Armies of rivals seethed furiously at its return, a defiance that they believed must be corrected. The gold spire slipped up into the sky like a great dagger of sunlight beaming as its twin reformed, baring the Two Lovers aloft in their stony gaze into the bright morning sky. The city seemed to light up with terror, anger, hope and joy as the Pillar rose into the air.


The Inferno Wardens stared up from their evacuation point on the far side of the city, their number depleted to just under 30 Astartes as civilians they had saved, all of them noble souls who swore allegiance to the God Emperor of Mankind and wished to depart this pagan place. But the sudden arrival of the spire sent shivers down many of their spines; was it Chaos cultists conjuring the dead with Warp-powered necromancy? Was it a trick of the eyes created by some deceptive cur to lure people into a trap?



From across the city, many could see a fleet of strange ships descending around the pillar, deploying even more of the superhuman soldiers around the fortress, an array of of markings of different colors against the metallic red, black and silver. Many of them bore trophy racks adorned with alien skulls freshly scalped and cleaned, while others wore cloaks and talismans made of the bones of monstrous creatures; the fight with the Grimm-like Tyranids had been a wash, the splinter fleet destroyed. The Reclusiarch had sent out a message to the Chapter, requesting more aid; he had been answered with the entire crusade of 300 additional Astartes descending on the fortress to hold the line.


The comms buzzed, the message that followed echoed across the airwaves, reaching the ears of many; u/BlueWhaleKing, u/Vaniellis, u/StrikeFreedomX2, any and all who could hear, and even some of the enemy heard the triumphant roar that echoed across the airwaves:


***""REJOICE, MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS! REJOICE AND BASK IN THE LIGHT OF THE NEWLY ANNOINTED SAINTS OF THE EMPEROR! LET THE LIGHT OF HER RESURRECTION GUIDE YOU TO SALVATION!

RWBY,fden0dm,t3_ekx8da,1578342451.0,"The rumors reached far and wide in the wake of Arkos' destruction. Few eyes didn't see the wake of fire that burned in the night like a second sun the last few nights. Every one of the sites it was seen at was a fortress that was quickly destroyed, its smoking ruins and charred, terrified corpses leaving a dark story. Men had been blown to smithereens by munitions too bulky for normal humans, fires burning longer and hotter than all, save the flames cast by Cinder Fall's acolytes. Most who saw the culprits were frightened by what they saw, and urged those who could to run for the wildlands, to flee the city and never return.

They spoke of just around fifty men--though whether they were truly human or not was up to debate purely from their size that matched Hazel, if not were larger--clad in armor of metallic crimson, ebon back pauldrons and bright silver markings. They were each as loud as artillery, thunderous voices calling for war in a tongue so foreign it matched none on records. They were steely in their demeanor until they were within range to charge, in which their voices turned the night into a cacophony of screams. Knives as long as shortswords were brandished, several recovered by members of factions that had also fought in the area; each one was as long as a man's arm and of a fine edge that seemed deceptively decorative with the amount of etchings revealed after scrubbing free caked mud and blood. A few pieces of armor were retrieved as well, deceptively light despite some pieces being the size and toughness of tank armor. Markings found on them confirmed their allegiance to Arkos, but even more were found in strange tongues, written on parchment, etched on pauldrons; eagles with two heads, swords engulfed in fire, things that were disconcerting in their nature, or to some laughably edgy. The markings of the Inferno Wardens, one of the Astartes chapters summoned to Arkos' defense alongside Captain u/Vaniellis and his Arc Knights.

The reports trickled on as some began to hunt this force down, though in the day they seemed to be unusually inactive for something so clearly bombastic.

Sergeant Thel stared at the map from the Inferno Wardens' temporary base with the Arkos survivors in Renora's citadel. Lines of activity crisscrossed the map, deceptively mobile.

""Where are you, Reclusiarch,"" he muttered as he pinched the bridge of his nose. ""What is your plan now...""

The Sergeant of the Second Company's 3rd Squadron, an Astartes named Franz, walked up to him. **""Lieuten-- 
er, *Captain* Bataar wishes to inform you that Captain Adresta has been successfully interrred into his sarcophagus. The Contemptor chassis is being readied as we speak.""**

Thel nodded. ""Noted. Any word from u/PuzzarianIdeal?""

**""None. His attention has been on the religious conflict.""**

""What about u/BlueWhaleKing?""

**""Silent.""**

Another nod, this time deep in contemplation. ""Reclusiarch u/TheUnholyHandGrenade would not lead an Inferno Protocol like this unless he had a plan... unless the fires were for another reason... scare tactics?""

**""Perhaps. Intimidate the opposition into keeping clear of Renora?""**

""He would mark the kill sites with the iconography of Renora then, not Arkos. Has he broken radio silence?""

**""No. None in the Second Brotherhood have,""** Franz replied, using the Chapter's term for a 50-man Demi-Company.

Thel grimaced as he turned back to stare at the board.

Figuring you and the original commenter above me are left of center (call it a hunch that might also be wrong, but I've spent enough time talking politics that I've learned to spot ideological ticks among parties), imagine a bizzaro world where in the 2016 Presidential Race Donald Trump somehow swayed the hearts of both the Greater New York Metropolitan, Greater Chicago Metropolitan and the Greater Los Angeles Metropolitan Area without ever setting foot in the rest of the nation, saying ""fuck them, they can go pound sand"" and somehow still winning the Presidency even when Hillary reached out to a far greater variety of walks of life over a much larger are of the nation.

He dared not breathe in the fumes, lest he sour his stomach; where most promethium flames burned with the usual angry reds and yellows, the Inferno Wardens had long since synthesized a hotter, more dangerous breed of the chemical, mixed with the volcanic dust of their homeworld's obsidian spires. No water could put out the blaze save for a Category 4 hurricane, and even attempting to snuff it out would do nothing but burn yourself in the process. He realized he had gone overboard when hundreds of Freezerburn acolytes ran screaming from the burning fortress, wreathed in azure flames. Still, the missiles rained down, turning the citadel of ice and fire into a scorching pyre of cold-blue flames that turned steel soft as rubber.

No hymn was sung that night as the fire burned, casting the crimson red and bright silver of the Chapter's armorial in icy blues. No one had the heart for a hymn save mourning prayers. Something about this all seemed... off.

The Reclusiarch sat quietly in his tent, staring at the reports. The Pillar of Autumn was taking more and more attacks each day.

**Fool of a humanioid,""** he cursed as he glanced at u/BlueWhaleKing's letters. **""Bastard was too aggressive... now he has brought all of the other cults against us.""**

He grimaced as he stood up, beginning to pace. As Reclusiarch, rage and focus were his primary tools of rhetoric, but it was compassion that he had to keep as the spiritual leader and councilor of his Brothers. Already he had spoken with several who were of the mind to leave this battle and join the fight against the new Tyranid threat, this ""Salem's Brood"" as Inquisitor Andronicus had dubbed it on account of its Grimm-like color scheme. He didn't deny he could sympathize with their want. Still, they were here now, and they would at least remain as long as they could.

Now, however, he remained at a loss for what to do, his urge now to reinforce the defenses. And yet he wondered if the time for that was past.

**""Perhaps an alliance is in order,""** he muttered to himself as he turned his eye to the map of the city, zeroing in on Renora. Few touched it in the wake of its ascension into canon, several Imperial subjects within the city declaring it the faith chosen by The Emperor Himself. He didn't deny the existence of a soft spot in him for it as well.
