selfharm,fdj93nb,t3_elizck,1578462010.0,I cut with old craft scissors usually. I barely bleed and it doesn’t scar super badly so I always feel insecure because they aren’t “deep”. I have a friend who has fairly bad scarring and I have never shown her mine because they’re like scratches compared to hers

Like, whenever my friends are sad, I have no clue what to say to make them feel better"
selfharm,fd89jth,t3_ek92xd,1578215497.0,"Be careful. Cutting slowly manifests itself into your life and it’s damn hard to stop. I’ve been selfharming for probably about a year now and I would take it all back in a heartbeat. Just because it makes you feel better right now doesn’t mean that you should do it. Please, please, please get help. It’s not worth the headache trying to sneak around and hide it. People *will* find out eventually. Stay safe"

selfharm,fd5sr4j,t3_ejtb8y,1578181084.0,"You could try downloading the app Calm Harm. It’s really helped me. Also, I text a crisis line when I’m really not feeling okay. When it’s really bad, I have to completely remove myself from areas any sharp objects. Usually that just means I go on a walk until I feel better. If you don’t like any of these options, I HIGHLY recommend journaling. It serves as a distraction. If your parents go through your thinks or you have a nosy partner, you could put it in a locked note on your phone. That’s what I did when I still lived with my mom.

**There are people out there who care about you and want the best for you.** You could always reach out to them when the urges are too strong.

One thing that’s helped me a lot is imagining myself as a little kid again. My four year old self would never want me to be in pain or hurt myself. And I would never do anything to hurt her. I just try to remember that I *am* her, just a bit older"
