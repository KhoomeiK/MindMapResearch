Set boundaries. By all means chat but if she’s just annoyed you didn’t ‘fight for her’ and is feeling sore you are so okay with not seeing her again she could be manipulating for an ego boost to get more of a reaction from you.  

I wouldn’t even meet her in person. A chat over the phone is all that is required.  Your cards are already on the table so just ask her to explain/propose a solution and either accept it or don’t."

AmItheAsshole,fdq1299,t3_emimf3,1578649583.0,"NTA.  Sounds like your partner is just embarrassed.  Some people like to keep things (sometimes unnecessarily) very private.  It would fall in the same category as someone who went for number 2 but then spent tons of time airing bathroom, lighting candle, etc to pretend like they hadn’t.  Bit weird that that’s where the relationship is after so long though.

NTA, you were being considerate but can leave her to it in future if she prefers. She needs to let this go."
