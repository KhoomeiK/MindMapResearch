His family and friends were at the lodge drinking some hot cocoa and he decided to go down by himself. He said he fell and landed sideways and could still see light. Passer bys saw his skis and got him out. So terrifying. Ugh.

Pay attention to what you hated the most that alcoholism contributed to. For me it was ache and I was always so angry at everything and everyone when I was sober. When I quit drinking, I journaled how I felt. Right now I'm 6 days Ina  row without being raging pissed off. 7 days ago I was livid about something at work but I dropped it within an hour instead of holding a grudge for over 24 hours. Things like that. Watch yourself changed its amazing. And my face is so god damn clear.

I saw this post on r/askreddit and felt sad. I've had alot of lows when drinking. I'm a recovering alcoholic but I would drink 12 to 16 16 oz'ers a night every night for 12 years.

On the 23rd I'm 5 months sober. I've saved just over 2 grand alone. I've fixed my teeth, almost done. I moved out of my parents house and I finally got the check engine light off my dashboard. Good feels man."

Me and my friend were in the trunk, Eddie was on the roof, the rest in the car except me and my buddy in the trunk. We drove like 5 miles, one block from our destination and a cop hiding in the shadows gets us. They call my parents. My dad wasn't mad, he did stupid things at my age. But I was grounded.

Another, I was at my girlfriend's. We were so quiet we were texting messages on her phone but not sending them. Handing it back and forth. Her mom walks in and just wanted to talk to her daughter because she had a bad dream about her."
