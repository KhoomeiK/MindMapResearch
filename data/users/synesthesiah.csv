AmItheAsshole,ffyn9x9,t3_evx287,1580350472.0,"NAH. Mental illness in a relationship is *hard*. I’m currently experiencing that now, so I get it. It’s impossible to be endlessly patient, especially when you have so many of your own responsibilities. 

You know how they tell you to put your mask on first on an airplane emergency? You need to put on your mask first. Your mental health is your priority, and it’s clear you can’t lean on your partner for support the way he leans on you. If your partner can’t understand that, then you should move on. You can’t fix him if he’s refusing to put in the work after you’ve set him up for success in every way you can."

After two years, and getting *engaged*, you shouldn’t have let him believe that you took out a mortgage. That’s dishonest. When you got the house, you should’ve mentioned it was from your parents. At least then you can say that you don’t like to talk about your wealthy parents because it had nothing to do with your career or personal life. Honesty is just the best policy. 

On his end, I don’t get why your parents being wealthy affects his idea of “wealth disparity”. It’s not your money yet, so it’s not your business or his. It sounds like he’s got a big ego and the fact that on paper, you’ll always be richer than him destabilizes his sense of masculinity. Makes me laugh. My husband’s grandma won double digit millions in the lottery a few years back, and I’m a teen single mom’s welfare baby. The wealth disparity is *huuuuuuge*, and I’m 100% shut out of participating or having any official say in the money my husband received. I made $12k the year he bought our house, and spent more money anyone in my family has ever made in a year on a truck. I was hurt at first, thought I was going to get dumped because sudden money can change people. At the end of the day, it didn’t matter. I ride on the coattails and benefit from having the best wedding any of my guests ever attended, beyond my wildest dreams, I’ve visited places I never thought I’d see, and I never have to worry about my future child having to go without like I did."
AmItheAsshole,ffyh1pd,t3_evv4m7,1580346240.0,"YTA. What other people eat or don’t eat isn’t your business. What other people’s bodies look like isn’t your business. Especially when it’s your *boss*. It’s not your business to discuss *anyone’s* weight or lifestyle choice unless you’re their dietician, doctor,  therapist, or very very close loved one. You don’t know if your boss has mental health problems, and often diets can really affect someone who is susceptible to mental illness. 

As a subordinate who has only been at this place for *three months*, do you really want to be pegged as not only disrespectful, but a nosy busybody who nobody trusts? What a great way to have a fantastic **professional relationship.**


On another note...

Are you aware that 95% of diets fail? Are you aware that Keto is meant for *epileptic people* who don’t respond to medication??? Not fat people. Atkins is just as bad, frankly. Diets are normalizing compulsive eating habits that are categorized as eating disorders. It’s more risky to be underweight than overweight, and now calorie counting and macronutrients are things that people stress and obsess over, leading to anorexia, bulimia, binge eating disorder. Even worse, considering your boss is diabetic, is diabulimia. That’s when type 1 diabetics purposefully underuse insulin as a way to lose weight. 

Of course you’re not thinking about that. The whole idea is self serving. You’re not planning to make breakfast to be nice, you’re doing it with the intent on trying to be holier than thou."

Teen mom on never ending carousel of shitty abusive boyfriends. One of them *beats someone to death* and she goes down with him. My sibling’s dad takes us on a trip to a cabin by the lake. We are told mom won a trip. I find out *six weeks later* when my mom calls from prison while I’m visiting my grandma. 

She spends 5 years in jail while I go to live with the baby daddy of my younger 2 siblings. They kept me from my blood family for over two years while the government pays them. Instead of treating me like my lil sibs, they abused me. Their dad did things to me I haven’t even told my husband about. Child protective services didn’t believe me. 

By the time I got back to my grandparents, I was a husk of my former self. Once smart and outgoing, I struggled in school, was isolated and bullied. I first threatened to kill myself in fifth grade. That’s when I realized I was broken. 

Even though my mom was acquitted a few years later, things didn’t get better. She didn’t even believe in mental health, or bisexuality. She was not prepared to handle a tween/teen. She treated me like I was 7 until I was 17 and decided I’d rather be homeless than deal with her shit."

Also take a Tylenol for the pain, as I’m sure your sphincter is at least a bit strained and you’ll want to bring any inflammation down. 

Next thing you’re gonna want to do is sit down and discuss what happened last night. Set your boundaries and make sure he knows that wasn’t okay, that you need and *deserve* communication, and he needs verbal consent from you if he wants to try something new. 

Coming from a kink background, this is a lot of red flag behaviour for an unsafe partner. Something I always do with my husband when we want to try something new is to discuss it in a non sexual setting (often over dessert or while hanging out at home).

AmItheAsshole,ffgq85v,t3_eti13j,1579912281.0,"NAH, but you do have to consider that women have to literally alter their hormones when they take birth control, and condoms are not a sure thing. (And tbh as a woman, even the non latex ones irritate my vagina to no end). 

Improper usage is the reason condoms are only 85% effective! I don’t blame her for wanting you to get the snip. Why should it always be the woman’s job in a relationship to ensure there are no pregnancies? It takes two to make a baby. How *fair* is that? Have you even looked at options? Not far from me, you can get a no scalpel no needle vasectomy in a *6 minute procedure* with a tool that leaves a line literally like this:>>> | <<< 

That... compared having endless periods, pain, depression, weight gain, acne, fatigue because of a pill, playing whack a mole with your body. Compared to hours of labour, pushing a football out of of your body or having your abdominal muscles sliced open to extract a baby. Is a vasectomy really the worst thing that can possibly happen to you? 

If she doesn’t want to inflict hell on her body(and mental health) by not using birth control, she’s welcome to refuse to have sex with you and you have *zero* reason to complain. She gave you the option. You refused. You make your bed and lay in it. 

Frankly, my husband and I are jazzed as fuck about the trials in India for the injection into the vas deferens that can be dissolved at any time."

Poor guy had a terrible first grooming experience, then TPLO surgery which included lots of shaving, and ever since, he hides from *anything* that vibrates. Including cell phone under his butt, toothbrushes, dad doing repairs with power tools. There isn’t any “getting used to” when he’s been traumatized for life lol"
