todayilearned,fe7t1g1,t1_fe6gqf6,1578918952.0,Good point. I definitely wouldn't feel safe commuting to work via air.

todayilearned,fe68s0z,t1_fe66feg,1578884280.0,I know you're not being serious but trains are waaaay safer than automobiles. But not as safe as planes!  https://injuryfacts.nsc.org/home-and-community/safety-topics/deaths-by-transportation-mode/
Greyhounds,fe3hic6,t1_fdqwzez,1578849325.0,"I take mine to the dog park once or twice the week for the past month because I don't have yard to let him run in. 

Try to go during off peak hours. If it's too crowded mine will literally trample over other dogs at full speed (sorry other pups).

Also find one that has separated pens for large and small dogs. Even then keep an eye out for small dogs in the large dog pen. My guy will chase all running dogs (and of course catch them). But with small dogs he'll put his mouth on their neck when he does. He doesn't actually bite them but it freaks out the other owners and other greys might actually bite. 

I've been taking him to one with turf as well, But last week he hurt his paw and I think it was from running on the turf, so I'm going to find some place with grass. 

I personally wouldn't muzzle because I think there's more of chance he gives someone a concussion with that thing than him nipping someone. I'm interested to hear other peoples experience with dog parks too."

SandersForPresident,fcwb5tn,t1_fcwa4jp,1578021345.0,This 17 mil figure is a week old. It will be higher. Maybe her goal of 20 mil on the high side? But the other 3 in this graphic include the entirety of Q4. https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/27/elizabeth-warren-campaign-sounds-alarm-as-fundraising-slows-down.html

childfree,fc8duj6,t1_fc792kf,1577532683.0,That's crazy. What state? The place I'm going to is $600 without insurance. $400 if you use a training doc.

FLMedicalTrees,fc2rbtc,t1_f08k0pv,1577371750.0,"I know I'm crazy late to this thread, but AARP is actually pretty progressive. Conservatives have started their own elder advocacy groups to compete with AARP because they don't like their liberal leanings."
antiMLM,fbzkb9q,t1_fbzgbp8,1577249581.0,"I drink it too. Yes, i feel as energized and full as if I had an equivalent amount of food calorie wise.  It tastes okay too. It just gets repetitive so I have to take breaks and mix up the flavors / mixings"
