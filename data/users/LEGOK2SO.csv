wholesomememes,fel0il8,t1_feke6p3,1579211445.0,r/rareinsults ?
wholesomememes,fel0azk,t1_fekplwe,1579211319.0,Well. I’m not offended by what you are saying. But it did say “in the gym” I am pretty sure the over weight people there know they are fat and are trying to loose weight. And I don’t recommend fat shaming at all. If you want to help a heavier friend find a nice way to tell them it would be smart to loose some weight. There is a difference between fat shaming and telling someone in a kind and nice way that it’s smart to. Take it from a slightly larger person I would rather just be talked to by a friend then be called names or something like that by a random person. I understand how you meant it but fat shaming normally makes people hate their bodies. That’s something that’s already too common in our world. We need some more positive people and hopefully a more positive ways to help over weight people.
wholesomememes,fekzi1s,t1_fekkpqp,1579210840.0,You seem like a good friend for trying to get a rude friend to try to see the other way around the situation. Mind if I ask has your friend been any nicer about her opinion? Or at least kept them to herself?

guro,feey8d0,t1_f9qfanq,1579043833.0,Edgy anon edit. I’ve been told there is a lot of wholesome versions because it’s just the first two clips. You can see the artists signature on the second of the first two and I think it’s different on the bottom one.
