AskReddit,ffb2pd6,t1_ffat5sv,1579750284.0,"Goddamn, the Peppermint Mocha holiday drink! I can taste it just thinking about it. It had this weird, almost acrid smell and taste to it. But damn, it was weirdly good and I'd make a million of them for myself over Christmas."
AskReddit,ffb2jfz,t1_ffaghwz,1579750171.0,"It was just such an antiquated model when I was there 09-10. You were paid minimum wage + commission on some items, but the older sales associates would act like it was some get rich scheme. They would actively steal customers from you, or worse, offload wrongful employee discounts for cell phone plans (e.g. Sprint and Home Depot, 30%) to all their friends and family. Every one of those guys in their 40s and 50s was a complete fucking loser, but they acted like RS was their kingdom. Everything was overpriced. You were forced to jam cell phones and RS branded stuff down peoples throats. Managers would yell at you for not selling enough phones each month. People were constantly fired. We'd have weeks with zero customers through the door on a shift.

The whole thing was bizarre, but it was chill enough when the manager wasn't in. But the sales aspect of it made people do some shitty stuff, like steal the microSD cards out of the phone just to sell the customer another one for a tack on accessory."
AskReddit,ffb229p,t1_ffatuh9,1579749835.0,"This is an excellent read, and to call it an ""ol' boys club"" really hit it on the head. I was there for a year while in college. It was a fucking bizarre culture. Half of us were high-school or college kids just looking for some cash. The rest were guys in their 40s and 50s chasing I have no idea, acting like they made some windfall from that job. One guy drove an Audi A3 and wouldn't shut up about it. Another guy owned a Mercedes... which he couldn't drive because his license was suspended for a DUI. All of us were making the standard minimum wage + shit commission. The guy with the Mercedes was the ""district top salesman"" for pushing Sprint plans out the ass. They'd go to all the stores and talk about ""Andre"" being a fuckiing rainmaker. 

... Until Andre got caught pushing fraudulent Home Depot employee discounts through for the whole regions Hispanic population.

It was such a weird bygone era. There was zero money to be made on the sales floor. I had **weeks** without customers walking into the store. Most of my time was spent jumping the RC cars off the curb out front or getting yelled at for not selling enough cell phones to the non-existent customers."
AskReddit,ffb1ksr,t1_ffarh6f,1579749503.0,"I worked in the cafe for a year up until they closed. It was ridiculous how much they tried to crack down on free drinks. I still laugh at the ""Rewards"" incentive where if you hit over 90% of rewards card swipes you'd get a free drink that month.

... bitch I'm the only one in the cafe. I make myself free drinks all day."

phillycycling,ffalr4w,t3_esdati,1579738914.0,"Maintenance, yes typically. Buying bikes? Maybe if you're going very entry level. Their Co-op in-house brand isn't too bad. But they're not a replacement for a LBS that can properly fit you. They're a nice step in between your Walmart and your higher tiers. The Marlton one does some of my maintenance and I will buy parts there on occasion.

I really recommend Cadence, Bikesport, Bikesmith, Riverbend and Kezwick of you're in PA. If you're in SJ, I highly recommend Astreu and Mt. Holly Bikes. I do not recommend Wheelies."
MapPorn,ff9fp5f,t1_ff8awxa,1579712025.0,I love going to different cities and town on Google maps and searching their bar scene. Just did a search on Rexberg... that one Applebee's has to be bumping.
