You don't just look at the dog but you have to look at the human psychological aspects as well. Sometimes taking a break can be a very healing process and allow the person to recoup and start again to work towards finding that positive experience."
dogs,fdfi9ha,t1_fdfgcnl,1578362328.0,"Good! Rustling your jimmies means you are thinking. 

It is NOT ABOUT THE DOG it is about the LIVESTOCK. Inappropriate breeds dogs interacting directly with stock can cause great amounts of stress, decrease body score/QOL, and can even cause loss of life. 

It isn't JUST about ""appropriate behavior"" around stock but how the dog (appropriately behaved or not) interacts with the stock. This is a bit nuanced but very true and it is largely based upon instinct that has been selectively bred for. They have a very specific look and feel for their livestock that non-herding breeds just don't. A ""well behaved"" dog can still cause a sheep to fret to death without ever having been ""misbehaved"" (have certainly seen and had this happen). 

It is okay if you don't get it or feel somewhat put out. To take the words of someone else: Herding isn't an equal access ""sport""... nor should it be.

Edit: Landrace dogs - totally different ball game. And if they are bred for herding capabilities they are considered a herding breed dog. Most land races are no longer used for herding or bred for that purpose but for others - in that case they would not be considered herding bred."
reactivedogs,fdfg5w7,t3_el3tio,1578360929.0,"Take some time for yourself. Take a nice long bath, treat yourself to some of your favorite foods. Its okay to be stressed and its okay to cry. 

Do you think you'd be more comfortable if you muzzle trained your dog? It may allow you to be a bit less scared and worried about possible interaction. 

But for real, take some time for yourself, you deserve it."
dogs,fdfewbg,t1_fdfcgg0,1578360077.0,"The AHBA allows any breed dog. 

From their rules and titles guidelines: 

""HCT titles are limited to the listed breeds. JHD and trial titles may be earned by all breeds and mixes.""

"" Events may be open to all breeds or limited to a specific breed """
dogs,fdfeiz4,t1_fdfcjr3,1578359827.0,"With response to your assertion about stress - That is not necessarily true! There are many types of dogs and many ways that they can cause stress. Especially depending on the type of ""freak out"". 

As for training young dogs, there are people who do not practice good stockmanship or dog training and will throw dogs on stock and go into full training when not ready. A modicum of stress is always a part of/present during training on sheep. It is something that is very intentionally balanced. This is why most stock people will put a dog on stock for a few moments to see where they are at and then put them up and see where they are at again in a few months. If the dog doesn't ever seem to appropriately turn on to their livestock or show interested - they are petted out.

A Fun Aside: German Shepherds are a different type of herding breed and what you see Border Collies doing is not what a GSD was originally bred to do. They are a tending dog - a much different type of herder used to keep sheep within a certain boundary."
dogs,fdfcaqj,t1_fdfbfb1,1578358317.0,"Yeah, they do. From the AHBA rules: ""   1.   Events may be open to all breeds or limited to a specific breed.""  


And while AKC does restrict it somewhat... Boxers? Really? :: sigh ::"
dogs,fdfc928,t1_fdfbsr7,1578358285.0,"This is why instinct is so important. Border Collies with no instinct should also not be attempting to herd livestock. The fact is, instinct is first and foremost when it comes to herding dogs. You can not instill instinct through training. 

Non-herding breeds are not bred for the work - they do not have the appropriate tools necessary to be able to handle livestock in an appropriate manner. It is much more likely a herding breed and herding bred dog will have the appropriate instinct to work the livestock vs a non-herding bred dog. 

This whole post was sparked off of someone ""working"" their afghan and standard poodle on livestock. Totally inappropriate."

reactivedogs,fcts56z,t3_eitqtg,1577956666.0,"I would highly recommend you find a trainer local to you that has their CPDT-KA or CABC or ABMA. They will be able to help you in person a lot more than we are online. We can provide you with some resources but that doesn't really replace an in person trainer.   


You can look up trainers here:

* CPDT

* IAABC
   *  [https://iaabc.org/consultants](https://iaabc.org/consultants)"
reactivedogs,fcts04o,t3_eitm2w,1577956460.0,"Generally how you would want to deal with this is as follows:

* Pick a high value treat for your cousin to give Duke that he doesn't get at any other time. 
* Have your cousin TOSS the treat to Duke - DO NOT make Duke come out of his comfort zone to take it from him 
* If position changes are an issue, have your cousin toss a treat before the transition and then right after the position change 
* This will take time and it is annoying and tiring but you should see progress

If you do not see progress and Duke is still incredibly stressed, you may wish to speak with your Veterinarian and come up with a Behavioral Adjustment plan that also makes short term use of anxiety medication. When working in conjunction this can really help make an impact when it comes to BAT."
reactivedogs,fctrqx3,t3_eis0zc,1577956085.0,"First, lets start with what type of growl and nipping is it? There is a difference between play and not play.   
How was your older dog approaching her when she started to growl?   

Has your puppy seen a Vet yet? (Rule out pain and not feeling well) 

&#x200B;

That being said, every time you see this behavior from her - instant time out into a very boring place - be it a covered crate or a bathroom - for about 10 seconds. Then let back out - if she acts like this again, repeat. If she does it again right away, add 5 seconds to the time.  

&#x200B;

I would also recommend feeding separately and giving toys/chews separately for now."
reactivedogs,fctredf,t1_fctqoco,1577955585.0,"No, Millan's books will not work with a dog like you are describing.  I think one of the best take aways you can get from Cesar is that your stress and reaction can affect your dog. By staying calm you can better help your dog get over their fear/issues.   


Sounds like your dog is giving you a lot of signals before anything happens - **THAT'S GREAT!** 

&#x200B;

This just means you have to learn what to do once you see those signals.   


When your dog lays down and gets low, Immediately do a light 'Hey \_\_\_\_name\_\_\_\_\_' and move off to the side and give a treat. As the dog gets closer and you are off to the side (hopefully more than 3ft away) - keep rewarding the dog for having its attention on you and not the other dog. Keep different types of treats at different values - normal treat (other dog far away), cheese (other dog is closer), hot dog (as the other dog is passing you).... then 'Good Job!' and just start walking off and away from the other dog happily with praise. 

&#x200B;

If that basis does not work you can also try a targeting version. Here is a step by step walk through that I've sent to others previously. This starts inside the house and then moves outdoors. 

* Target Games
   * Targeting means teaching your dog to touch a designated body part to a designated target such as the palm of your hand. That description doesn’t do it justice; targeting is tons of fun! Many dogs love targeting, partly because it’s easy to do, and partly because it pays off well – “push the button (the target spot), get a treat.”
   * Hold out your hand in front of your dog, at nose level or below. When she sniffs it, click your clicker (or use a verbal marker, such as a mouth click or a word ""YES!"" ""GOOD!"") and feed her a treat. Remove your hand, then offer it again. Each time she sniffs, click and treat. If she stops sniffing (boring – I’ve already sniffed that!), rub a little tasty treat on your palm, to make your hand smell intriguing, and try again.
   * You’re looking for that wonderful “light bulb” moment – when she realizes she can make you reward by bumping her nose into your hand. Her “touch” behavior becomes deliberate, rather than incidental to sniffing your hand. When you see her deliberately bumping her nose into your hand, add the “Touch!” cue as you offer your hand to her. Encourage her with praise and high-value treats. Make it a game, so she thinks it’s the most fun in the world. You want to see her eyes light up when you say “Touch,” and you want him to “bonk” her nose into your hand, hard! Start offering your hand in different places so she has to move to touch it, climb on something to touch it, jump up to touch it.
   * When she loves the touch game, occasionally ask her to touch twice; tell her she’s a good dog after the first one, and click and treat only the second one. Gradually decrease your rate of reinforcement, until she’ll touch several times before she gets his click and treat. Then click and treat several in a row. Mix it up, so she never knows when the reward will happen – but reward will always happen eventually!
   * Now try playing touch when your dog is a little bit nervous about something. Another dog passing by on the sidewalk? Hold out your hand and say “Touch!” so that your dog takes her eyes – and her brain – away from the scary thing and happily bonks her nose into your hand. Reward!!! She can’t be afraid of the dog and happy about touching your hand at the same time. She also can’t look at the target and stare at the scary dog at the same time.
   * Ask her to touch several more times, until the dog has passed, and then continue on your walk. If you do this every time she sees a scary dog, she’ll decide that other dogs is okay because they make the touch game happen! By changing your dog’s behavior – having her do something she loves rather than acting fearful – you can manage a scary encounter, and eventually change her emotional response to and association with something previously scary to her.

It MAY be possible to work with him along with the use of medications. But that is a HUGE ask of someone living in down town in an apartment. And it is hardly living for either you or your dog to be walking on eggshells all the time.

One of the hardest decisions is Euthanasia. In this case it is the most Humane choice and the right choice for you to do. For more than one reason: 1) Your dog is not happy living in constant fear and stress, 2) If you give a dog like this to a shelter or rescue, they will euth the dog but will be without his owner... it'll be much kinder if you are there with him."

I'm sorry to hear about what you are going through. Reactivity in dogs can be tough to handle but it is not always insurmountable with knowledge, training, and management!   


First, please describe what you mean by aggressive? Is she lunging and barking at them? Snapping?   


Second, At what point when she sees another dog does she start to tense? To react?
