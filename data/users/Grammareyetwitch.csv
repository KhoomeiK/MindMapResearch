LifeProTips,ffg9a9p,t1_ffg0or4,1579901226.0,Gertrude would have been Trudy or Gertie when little.  She would have fit in with Tilly and Trixie and Lottie and Maybel.  I expect the next 15 years to be full of such names as younger people become parents who aren't old enough to have met someone born before 1940.

Piracy,ff94qbb,t1_ff93pxb,1579704797.0,For kids movies they used to have portable dvd players for your car.  I imagine it's still good if you can't stream because of gaps in the network.  We just download things to a tablet though.
askscience,ff8bt0e,t1_ff6rdcq,1579672193.0,"I have something called Reynaud's phenomenon.  When I put my hands or feet in cold water it hurts so much worse than elsewhere on my body.  I'd much rather put an ice cube in my armpit than have to hold one, and this entire thread baffles me.

My hands become bloodless and white, then when they warm up they get splotchy and red, then purple. Why doesn't my body work the way it should?"
science,fev1c4m,t1_feuswkq,1579392012.0,Did you have to call and argue when they deny every last charge after the deductible is met?
lotrmemes,feipjmt,t3_ep6ysp,1579144026.0,What I want is a kids version I can show my 3 year old that's better than the 70s cartoon.  Pixar could remake the Hobbit right now and it'd be great.
papertowns,fegoh1q,t3_eor4o3,1579098732.0,"Fun fact: The old bridge had rapids under the arches, and a lot of people would drown trying to ""shoot"" the bridge by running the boat under the arches instead of unloading the boat and walking around the bridge to reload."
papertowns,fego43u,t1_fegd983,1579098473.0,"It wouldn't be monthly, perhaps twice a century would suffice."
papertowns,fegnztx,t1_feeuae0,1579098386.0,Yes. Don't be a traitor.
TwoXChromosomes,fegmovb,t1_fefffii,1579097399.0,It's just like the fire department.  They don't ask you how you're paying for it because it's paid out of taxes. Nobody is forced to give you labor (fire department workers) or property (the water) because it's already compensated or performed by volunteers.
todayilearned,fdw2quf,t1_fdvqw5x,1578754449.0,More likely you were breastfed so long because you were a picky eater.  My daughter used to have violent diarrhea every time she tried cow milk. I breastfed for 2 years.
todayilearned,fdw128p,t1_fdvk0u0,1578753952.0,"They don't want to be sued for giving people harmful bacteria, and also bacteria laden foods rot faster and they have less time to make money from it.  It's not that they randomly refuse to give healthy food, it's capitalism."
todayilearned,fdvyyfr,t1_fdvodtk,1578753260.0,"I would 100% blame this on having to work and pump.  It's very common for pumps not to remove all the milk, then your supply decreases in response to the ""lower"" demand.  If we all got 6 months of leave, it would go a long way towards making breastfeeding possible for more parents. 

It was not your fault! You're expected to work like you're not a mom and be a mom like you don't have to work."
TwoXChromosomes,fdvs6dg,t1_fdtqnl4,1578750956.0,Your # 2 applies to pets more than kids and is why I don't want a dog.  My 3 year old can use the potty by herself but that dog would have me picking up poop for 8 to 15 years.

ZeroWaste,fckbxm0,t1_fck9us4,1577721863.0,"Yes, trash. If you live out in the country, you can find a spot to leave it outside if its a lot, though it will attract animals. Just don't put it in a creek or stream or anywhere there's water."
knitting,fb4c8gj,t1_fb3xpjp,1576506119.0,I'm pregnant with my second and most likely last baby.  I'm scrambling to knit ALL the newborn things I can because it's my last opportunity to knit for my own infant.
