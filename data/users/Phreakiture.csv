Making it even slower, it had a 70% duty cycle on that 1 MHz core, because the remaining 30% of the time the video chip was tugging on the DMA line.  It could communicate at 300 bits per second.

You can pay cash fare when you board, exact change only, no transfers.  You can get a fare card if you want, and that's good for various discounts, but I am an infrequent user, and I don't know all of the discounts.

No trains, just buses.  Cleanliness depends on the route.  They also don't run as frequently as MTA.  If you miss a subway, another one comes by in five minutes; CDTA, by comparison is usually 15-30 minutes.  However, they stop running after a certain hour, so be sure to check the schedule so you don't become stranded (my son was notorious for this).

Route numbers tell you something about the route.  1-2 digits is an old route that hasn't been changed yet, will be local service in most cases.  100-499 are local, the first digit tells you what county (Albany, Rensselaer, Schenectady, Saratoga are 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively).  500's are express, 600's are shuttles, 700's are commuter specials, 800's are rural service or trolleys, 900's are limited stop.  For express, shuttle and rural, the second digit tells you the county, so, for example, 530 is an express that has an endpoint in Schenectady County."

So for mp3, the birrate step is 16, so 193 doesn't happen nor does 191.  The next steps down and up are 176  and 208, respectively. If the file is monaural, you need only half of the bandwidth you need for stereo,so if we were to say that 160 is good for stereo, then 80 would suffice for mono.

However, the most correct answer is that you want VBR. this is because a fixed birrate serving a variable need will absolutely cause variability in the quality of the encoded audio. To keep the quality consistent, you need to allow the bitrate to change dynamically."

I had a mentor (shout out to DJ Wispa, wherever they hell you disappeared to!) who really pounded the hell out of this one point:  Not every crowd is a dancing crowd.  What you have to do is get a feel for the crowd, and just lay down the best groove you can that matches that feel.

He said watch for things like bobbing heads, tapping feet, air guitars, etc.  Even if they're not up and on the dance floor, if you see these kinds of things, you've got them.  

Now, maybe this part is a little controversial, because I guess a lot of DJ's hate taking requests?  I fucking love taking requests.  As long as I don't see the same drunk girl swing by the booth for the thirtieth time in ten minutes, I take requests and I use them to gauge the crowd.

To lubricate the request process, I have a printed catalog of the music I think will fit the event after my consultations with the bride and groom.  I hand it to people and let them peruse it, pass it around, mark it up, whatever.  When it gets back to me, it's dog-eared, roughed up, and full of good ideas."
