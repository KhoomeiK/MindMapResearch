depression,feci8f5,t1_fe8t4ur,1578974546.0,I don't wanna be mean or anything but everyone is selfish. You just need to look at the right angle. They're mad calling you selfish because they don't want to be sad. It's just because of them. It's a weird way to see things I know and its depressing. I think it's one of the reason I'm so depressed and lonely
depression,feae20j,t3_eo55m9,1578947451.0,"It's not easy for sure but its always there. The thought of doing it. It's like the only way out, the easiest. I'm 18 and I don't feel like I'm gonna live old. Imma die young, I'm pretty sure. Everytime I got these panic attacks I feel dike the only way to feel better is to stab my heart. Sometimes It hurts but its not physical. I can't take it anymore"
