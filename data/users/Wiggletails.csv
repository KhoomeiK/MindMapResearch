goldenretrievers,fft0nqu,t1_ffstfix,1580200786.0,Belly rubs are his favorite form of payment.
goldenretrievers,ffs73za,t1_ffr74uk,1580174763.0,Go to our website www.chescoseardogs.org and you can contact us there.
goldenretrievers,ffs6up0,t1_ffs6pn9,1580174585.0,They were very curious why Hunter was running up to them with his vest and bells on. A good training session.
goldenretrievers,ffs6qg1,t1_ffs6krg,1580174506.0,Contact your local k9 search team. You can start trading the day you take your pup home.
goldenretrievers,ffs6nj2,t1_ffrxtcl,1580174450.0,We end all training sessions and actual call outs with a find. It’s good practice to end every session with a positive find. Every training session is set up as hard or harder than an actual call out so he doesn’t know the difference. He only does live find and no cadaver searches.
goldenretrievers,ffs6fnq,t1_ffrr7s5,1580174296.0,They are used in all types of SAR roles. He is a wilderness air scent live find. He loves the woods and the wetter and the colder the better. Not so good in the summer heat though.
goldenretrievers,ffs6af3,t1_ffrgrzm,1580174195.0,Let him know if you are lost and he will be happy to find you.
goldenretrievers,ffs68wm,t1_ffrg6zx,1580174165.0,He is our third Golden for our family. Such special dogs.
goldenretrievers,ffr54yu,t1_ffr4euc,1580150667.0,I think they were wonder why there was a dog with a search and rescue vest on coming up to them. I wish I had a video camera.
goldenretrievers,ffr51sa,t1_ffr3vze,1580150612.0,He is supposed to find any live human so we had to reward him as he did his job. He doesn’t know who he is looking for as he is not a scent specific search dog.
goldenretrievers,ffr1idl,t1_ffr1flk,1580148406.0,"Just call him if you are lost, he loves finding people."
goldenretrievers,ffr1a78,t1_ffr0ypf,1580148262.0,Thanks. Always train for anything to occur as it could happen in an actual search.
goldenretrievers,ffqzsz1,t1_ffqzko1,1580147326.0,Agreed. We always hope not to run into a meth lab and so far we have been in luck. Stay safe.
goldenretrievers,ffqzpph,t1_ffqzjmz,1580147268.0,They were surprised as they just wanted to go fishing. They ended up in our training area which made it fun for Hunter as usually he finds people hiding near or under trees.
dogswithjobs,ffqzlph,t1_ffqz95g,1580147198.0,Seems like we picked the right name or he decided he wanted to do something with the name after we gave it to him.
dogswithjobs,ffqzigs,t1_ffqx4w0,1580147141.0,"I always think that you should introduce yourself to the local team. You will be spending a lot of them together.  Form there, they can guide you to your goals."
dogswithjobs,ffqzeby,t1_ffqwvi0,1580147066.0,Best to connect with your local team and see if you are a fit and if Bailey has potential. It’s a big commitment for both of you as your local team will have specific requirements for you and Bailey to be deployable.  They will give you exercises for training and as always good obedience is necessary as well. Good luck.
goldenretrievers,ffqwrfh,t3_euo6gu,1580145394.0,Go to www.chescosearchdogs.org and you will see the teams contact info.
goldenretrievers,ffqwnkt,t3_euo6gu,1580145326.0,Thanks. He acts like a super hero when he puts his vest and bells on
dogswithjobs,ffqwls8,t1_ffqunq2,1580145295.0,"We give them an area and hope they stay in it. When Hunter was a puppy, I knew where they were hiding but I didn’t tell him."
goldenretrievers,ffqwim5,t1_ffqttvg,1580145239.0,The two guys were very confused by the whole situation
dogswithjobs,ffqwgum,t1_ffqrsgq,1580145207.0,Thanks. I think it was Hunters.
dogswithjobs,ffqwf6k,t1_ffqr3gf,1580145175.0,You mean a Handler or a hider?  We are part of an all volunteer team. Best way is to join your local team.
goldenretrievers,ffqwcq6,t1_ffqqrg6,1580145132.0,He loves training days.
goldenretrievers,ffqwbqu,t1_ffqohiq,1580145114.0,They looked liked they were ready to go fishing and were very confused why Hunter was so happy to find them.
goldenretrievers,ffqnf5k,t1_ffqn9ed,1580139179.0,Let us know when you are in Philly. He is always looking for someone new to hide.
dogswithjobs,ffqmpf9,t1_ffqlyf3,1580138677.0,"I wouldn’t consider myself his master, we are definitely a team."
goldenretrievers,ffqmmx7,t1_ffqhvyy,1580138627.0,Hopefully you don’t get lost but he is always happy to find you.
goldenretrievers,ffqmkdu,t1_ffqh6vx,1580138578.0,Thanks
dogswithjobs,ffqmjra,t1_ffqh59b,1580138566.0,Absolutely.
dogswithjobs,ffqlzha,t1_ffqgtpt,1580138163.0,"Anytime you are in Philly, let him know."
Zoomies,ffqfytf,t3_eud12b,1580133459.0,He probably did 10 miles.
