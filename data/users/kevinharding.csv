ImmigrationCanada,ffg61w1,t1_ffg3eyz,1579899226.0,Just honestly trying help. Like you were.
ImmigrationCanada,ffg2soc,t1_ffg2crv,1579897227.0,"If you don't add the second ""to"" in  ""come down around"" you're suggesting that the tech draw will come down around 458, as if that is a location and the tech draw is a crashing airplane. Down ""to"" indicates a score.

The comma is still superfluous. It's not an independent clause because of the use of ""that"" - it's dependent on the first clause. Your sentence about commas has too many commas... ""The comma could be missing in that sentence, but it's an independent clause separated with a conjunction, so grammatically it should be there, as in this sentence."" Holy run on!"
ImmigrationCanada,ffg1xlg,t1_fffyx7v,1579896692.0,"I'd also remove the ""even"" in the ""even the Ontario PNP"" - Indian English seems to have a fascination with using ""even"" to mean ""also"" - such as ""Even I was rejected,"" or ""Even I got a procedural fairness letter when I submitted false documents.""

When read in a forum such as this, a Canadian English ear would hear ""Even I"" to be a reflection on exception - such as ""I can't believe that even \*I\* was caught with fraudulent documents!"" - as if it was not expected that they would be.

You also need to an a ""to"" in ""Is there any chance that the tech draw is going to come down **to** around 458.""  The comma that you added in the sentence about so many people applying right now causing worry is superfluous because it's not a list and they aren't independent clauses, ""and"" is the correct coordinating conjunction.  The state of being worried flows from too many people applying."
ImmigrationCanada,fffbtq3,t3_et8lxy,1579880512.0,They cannot land before you if you are the primary applicant. You will need to go to Canada at least once - with them - to even get the card.
ImmigrationCanada,ffe905f,t3_et42i7,1579840003.0,"Sometimes they just ask for it again. For safety's sake, I'd re-scan it, not just upload the same file.

It's entirely possible the file corrupted on upload - not on your end."
ImmigrationCanada,ffd1jgt,t3_esytli,1579811588.0,"If the TRV is still valid, she should be able to get on a plane to come back to Canada, even if it was a TRV issued at first with a study permit.

If she is truly trying to fly without a TRV on the passport, then she'll have issues."
