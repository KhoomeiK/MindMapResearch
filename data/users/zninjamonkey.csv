Well, you should say what math classes you have taken and describe their content (your course number and title alone is meaningless).

How many CS courses do you need more? I am assuming this will be a CS advanced elective, so if not AI course, what are the options.

And what is your end goal after graduating?

For me, I would like to study NLP or work in NLP specific domain in the future, so I am taking statistics classes in addition to lingusitics class.

I have also taken linear algebra (a staple in most cs undergrad program) + an intro stats course + a more advanced probability course. I will probably take some more specific advanced stats courses.
