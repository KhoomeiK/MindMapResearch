changemyview,feoymfj,t3_eq5jkp,1579308224.0,"Adapting to a new culture is not letting go of your own culture. You travel to another country to experience  that country's culture and to learn more about the world lmao I can't believe people think this is racist. Also is impossible to learn a language if you are not interested in the culture, in some cases you need to understand a bit of the culture so that slangs make sense or certain behaviors. You don't have to like everything or be obssesed just be interested and you will meet many people who are also interested in your culture and that wants a cultural exchange . Nothing wrong with that. Live your life and don't care about other people's opnion."
AskReddit,feoycpe,t3_eq1wzh,1579308052.0,"100 %? I don't know if that is possible but Just to be happy i would like to stop being negative and to be more confident on myself. My anxiety is already controlled, Social anxiety is 60% controlled. I would like to make new Friends, Nice connections and to finish personal work Projects because i think i am procrastinating a bit and not progressing at all. I really need to let go of negativity as you can see lol"
Instagramreality,fef7dzc,t1_fef6o4f,1579049932.0,"Yes I've watched a video before where the doctor had to cut the woman's ""private area"" to let the baby out . Not to mention 3 people staring at it she wanted to have a natural birth and I've heard that is common for some women to poop ... I don't know either I agree. All this comment section is making more traumatized good night guys."
Instagramreality,feeuwvv,t1_feesx9g,1579041744.0,I also feel that because i am petite I could die from it ??? Like my body wouldn't be able to carry a kid ?? I don't know I just strongly believe that
Instagramreality,feeg4hk,t1_feeeez6,1579033059.0,"My mom was the one who started a conversation with her lol , saying I looked like someone about to give birth because I was sweating so much and holding my belly when I entered the hospital and i guess she was just trying to be nice saying that contractions are a bit similar to cramps. I just wish they didn't start talking about things that happen in birth cause that made me more scared and the lady on my side seemed young and she was pregnant and seemed scared too. Of course cramps and contractions are not the same , contractions are probably worse. Well I'm just more traumatized now but I've made up my mind. If I ever want a human kid I will adopt lol"
Instagramreality,feecu9i,t1_fee9x38,1579031126.0,"Oh I already fear ðŸ˜‚ the peeing was Just one more thing for me to become more scared. I think i am developing tokophobia ( phobia of giving birth). I've had a few nightmares recently, in the dream I was pregnant and a guy was using scissors to cut me and it was so painful that made me wake up in the middle of the night screaming because I thought I was actually giving birth lmao then the other day I went to the hospital for taking a medication that made my cramps hurt so bad I almost passed out and when I calmed down and stopped crying the nurse told me ""what you felt today was just a bit of what is like when you are in the process of giving birth"" now I am scared af. You guys have my respect, mothers are amazing I will continue being a mother to my cat only."

offmychest,fds0bg5,t1_fdryzdi,1578692370.0,"That's so true but that got me thinking when we fall in love we want that person to ourselves , we want to be their only one, we want to be special, some feel the desire to monopolize the other person even if they don't do it, they feel it. I just realized love can be so selfish , it makes us blind, the other person can be trashy af but we keep denying it, we feel the need to be close to that person all the time. Our brain makes us do weird shit because we are in love and the only difference between being creepy and in love is the reciprocation omg and then everything is over and everything you felt dissapear so in the end it was not real omg I need to stop lmao I am just laying on my bed writing nonsense"

Anxiety,fdrxnie,t3_ems2q3,1578691305.0,"Is not everyone who will get it because i think with mental illness you can't say is the same for everyone. Everyone has a different story. When I was at my worse, insomnia, overthinking, panic attacks, anxiety and social anxiety I was scared of everything, I was scared of talking to others on the phone or buy groceries but I would do it anyway. I would force myself to do things I was scared because I knew that's how you overcome things. For some people that might seem impossible, they might break down and cry, this method might not work for them but it did for me I was desperate and I knew what caused my anxiety I new I had to start over and fight. Now my anxiety and social anxiety is controlled with no meds and I had no help . For some people just trying and doing things to overcome anxiety is not enough they might need medication , therapy, etc and there's nothing wrong with that. Everyone is different."
offmychest,fdrvxao,t1_fdr612j,1578690549.0,Now I'm starting to question the world what if love is not real and just an obssession? What if we are used to things like that and think that is normal but in reality is obsessive and we don't even realize it because our brain makes us feel good doing it ? I'm not high everyone I'm gonna stop it doesn't make sense ... idk
relationships,fdjjvdb,t3_ell68c,1578474232.0,"Girl please please have self love and respect and leave. There's so many red flags and he even said himself he plans to have sex with other people, he doesn't think of you as longterm. Put yourself first and your feelings first. If you stay you will keep getting hurt . Why do some girls do this to themselves? Date jerks ? Spend time alone, work on yourself, on your insecurities, meet new friends, change your life, you have the power to do that. You deserve better than him. He is humiliating and making fun of you, his friends that laughed are just like him. This was unnecessary, childish and disrespectful to you and your relationship. End things and Save yourself from more insecurities, more humiliation and pain."
offmychest,fdjjf5d,t3_elcxll,1578473599.0,I used to have insomnia too and anxiety . I was so unhappy that on days I was able to fall asleep I would wake up laughing nonstop . My brain would make me have happy colorful dreams so I would wake up laughing. Is so funny and sad lmao. My brain missed the dopamine.
tretinoin,fchoa5p,t3_eh05aj,1577652359.0,Tretinoin is a long term commitment. You could break out badly from it and go through a purge like most people do which makes your skin worse. Is definetly worth when you think about anti aging but when it comes to acne it can take some months to show improvement. Have you consider it could be pityrosporum folliculites / fungal ance? Check the symptoms on skincare science website or maybe your hair products are cause you have acne. Try a benzoyl peroxide gel or cream that you can leave on.
SkincareAddiction,fchnqq9,t3_eh2vmi,1577652151.0,"Same thing happened to me after I finished accutane but I was glad because I finally found out found out what my problem was. I felt so dumb because for many years I thought it was only acne.  If you didn't read skincarescience blog post about it yet I recommend you to read it , he has many products recommendations, treatments etc. You should also have a skincare routine with products that are FA Safe. Hair products are FA safe too. Makeup too and avoid sweating. Avoid overexfoliating your skin. If you are drying out your skin with the ketaconazole shampoo maybe you need a moisturizer or to reduce the amount of time you do your mask with ketaconazole . Also can take a few weeks to see results. You can also try raw honey, sulfur or BHA."
SkincareAddiction,fchl8d9,t3_eh81hm,1577651524.0,"Simples products are so gentle bit the best micellar water to be is bioderma sensibio h20. Removes everything, cleanses well, feels refreshing and you don't need too much. Is FA safe too."
Instagramreality,fchid18,t1_fche673,1577650710.0,"To me he doesn't look different except for makeup and filter, his face features look the same like it doesn't seem like he altered the shape of nose, in the first pic he is laughing and our nose usually stretches when we do that, his face has a nice symmetry but I agree about the posting a no makeup photo when it comes to showing an improvement of your skin."
Instagramreality,fchbtql,t3_eh88ya,1577649081.0,The products he recommended for skincare are actually really good and people on skincare addiction talk about them a lot. Skincare and weight loss can definetly change a person a lot but he is definetly using makeup and some filter to make skin look poreless. He was already cute before though.
threekings,fcfrwp3,t3_e7nkp7,1577633179.0,"First of all sorry if this is too long. I know this Clairvoyance  that talks about the spiritual world and religion on his youtube channel, is mostly to educate people, he also films house cleansings and video analysis , unfortunately his videos are not in english, he speaks  portuguese, my language, but in one of his videos he mentioned the shadows you keep seeing .

According to him they are the spirit of people who are transitioning from ""lost spirits still attached to the material world "" to "" spirits of obssession, who can't let go of the material world . They follow or get attached to energies that match their obssessions or that resemble their privious life. Let's say you smoke, this shadow you keep seeing could be the spirit of someone who is attracted by the energy of addiction, which is common for people that smoke, he is going to make you want to smoke to the point where you really become addicted and start trying other drugs, he is going to make your energy weak and ilness will appear because our body and our energy and some organs are connected, i don't know much about it but he explained in one of his videos about chinese medicine , however they are always so long like 30 minutes or 50 minutes so i don't remember everything.

This guy also says that everyone is sensitive and nobody is special, some just choose to ignore things, some don't know and don't want to , you can choose to ignore this and say no to the spiritual world but you will attract things to you if you keep looking for more . Also we all have spirits in our houses, they cannot move anything, they can't interact with the material world , a lot of them just observe you for a long period of time and get closer to you once you are asleep. I had a weird experience with what could possibly be one of them when i had a sleepy paralysis . There are others spirits who are agressive he says they are a mix of humans and animals, really tall , he never says in detail what it looks like or showed a drawing because if we think about it we can attract things to us and kids, there are many irresponsible kids watching his channel lmao they ask funny stuff in the comments.

I totally understand if you don't believe me or what this guy said, i didn't believe at first either but after i experienced some stuff i started to believe. This guy  is different from other channels that talks about spirituality because he studied many different religions for many years, has proofs and documents of what he studied, insteand of bringing creepy stories or speculations he teaches about religion, meditation, what beings exist in the spiritual world etc. He also visited many countries  in order to learn about religion from all over the world and became a monk, nowadays he is a buddhist. He also has many videos cleasing houses, testimonies from people, is not a TV show like the hollywood medium or anything like that, he deslikes hollywood a lot because of all this ""ghosts can move stuff, possessions"" bla bla bla this is all very rare stuff. What i am trying to say is that he seems genuine and explain things well. There are many books he recommends about spirituality too.

Also if the one you keep hearing screams a lot be careful , this spirit can make you mad. She is a woman dressed in white so if you see something ""white "" insteand of a shadow on the ceiling run,pray, listen to music, good energies. Tell me if you want the name or link to his channel or if you have any more questions. He would be able to explain things better than me but i tried my best and probably made some mistakes writing this because english is not my first language."
SkincareAddiction,fce07n1,t3_egvjih,1577615559.0,Everyone that got their picture stolen should sue this person. He / She is being a jerk in the comments when people call him out for stealing pictures. He has no intention of deleting the videos . I whonder how this person would feel if someone made a video retouching his / her face and transforming him into a little shit. Which is what he is.
SkincareAddiction,fcdytvw,t3_egvjih,1577615166.0,Lawsuits coming. Sue her.

AskWomen,fbp4zvj,t3_edxpmn,1577017626.0,"Being a mom is hard and people romanticize being a mom a lot, is not something you must do to become a complete and happy person, you don't have to have kids just because you have an uterus."
