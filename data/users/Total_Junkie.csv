Edit: And in your analogy, that's like someone selling you a brand new car (for a shit ton of money) and presenting it, promising ""this is *absolutely* guaranteed perfect!"" Then you find something small that is obviously put together wrong. Are you now a total asshole for wondering what else may be wrong? What else flew under the radar.

Especially when you are dealing with complicated items with lots of pieces that need everything to work together right, to work, and which are really expensive. Laptops run thousands of dollars. My current laptop cost more than my first car. And they, like cars, depreciate in value immediately and laptops are even harder to fix. 

This has also depreciated its value even more. It may not be noticed by every potential buyer, but a keen eye will easily catch it. It's a blight on the product and any second hand buyer would be wise to be suspicious."

It's amazing to be able to have my body and not be sexual. Not always fucking always be on the hook for making a dude horny. I had to always be thinking about it. That's why this comic kinda made me sad. I know for others it's happy, but the fact this fucking lady can't undress for one minute half asleep without getting ogled is depressing me even though I'm glad she's happy. It's just all the implications. It says a lot. Obviously with my issues. The only reason it can be framed positively is because it's implied she ""should"" NOT be ogled, cuz she's old and ugly and clearly depressed about that. (can't make her too old or ugly tho lol just a tad, make her ""tired"" that's the code word for ugly haha don't ever tell a woman they look tired!)

I appreciate your comment (genuinely). Although I wouldn't say male gaze as much as the ""gaze"" of a dog on a meat chop. Gaze is kinda too passive of a word. Although I'm sure that term was chosen in part to avoid triggering people (not by you, I mean the people who defined it).

It is a compliment though, especially all you disgusting, old, useless to society meat chops out there, it's a compliment a dog can still salivate after you. We definitely are NOT selling you a cure to a problem we created lol so continue to be undyingly grateful for every day you are still determined to be edible by some animal out there (especially if you're pregnant or had kids, ew). 

Welp there is no way this is going to be positively received on this subreddit especially. It's okay. I'm not actually saying it's wrong for anyone to react positively to that, like all the lovely stories in the comments. You can see the common threads though.

news,feg694m,t1_feg5wzw,1579078910.0,"Yes, exactly, but when a non-white would buy a house it drove all of the property values down. 

If you owned a house, your neighbor house was bought by a black person, OOPS! You want to sell your house? Well now you can't sell it for as much because who wants to live next to a *colored person.* Even worse, Who wants to live in a *colored neighborhood.* If there are black children in that house, then they might go to the SAME school down the street with *my* children! Everyone in the neighborhood has a vested interest in keeping it all white, in their pocket. 

It sucks, because the fear was even kinda ""legit"" in the sense that the value of your house WOULD literally go down if a black person bought a house in your neighborhood. You would likely lose money. Not saying any of it is justified or not rooted in pure hate, just pointing out that it's the system too and people had monetary motivations and money matters. Consider this: a black person would *also* suffer if yet another black person moved in (maybe they could get away with being the only one?). Or a family of another non-white ethnicity would suffer. Maybe they were just eeking by as ""white enough"" (aka not toooo black). A black person moving in to their neighborhood could legitimately fuck up their lives. 

This is (one of) THE reason African Americans are still so fucked. Trapped in the vicious cycle of poverty. Yes, """"slavery is over,"""" but we restricted their recovery every step of the way and the BIG step is property ownership. Wealth IS property. Read up on how black people got fucked out of obtaining property since the beginning and a lot will start to make sense.

Why did the headline not list the number of people who actually died, then? That's pretty standard, list the injury AND death count.

That's why ""injuries"" is usually separated into categories including ""life threatening injuries"" so we get a sense of how many people *would* have died, further helping us conceptualiize the scope of the accident. 

The number of deaths is what matters. It's always in the title for that reason and anyone claiming this bullshit is somehow okay is stupid. The fact that so many of us had the identical reaction is evidence enough *because that's how language works.* *Especially* in the context of a news headline/post title.

How customizable do you think I could get? What Pokemon resource (like a game or program) gives you the maximum control over the narrator? 

 The end result I want is a clip that says (roughly): ""A WILD *[name 1]* APPEARED! *[Name 2]* USES *[name 3]*...etc."" If I could get at least some of the new names spoken, that would be great. The more words replaced, the better. There's so many of them so close to each other, that just recording the names separately and playing them over the clip I fear would be too disjointed.

JUSTNOMIL,fdcrzz6,t1_fdadp3w,1578282634.0,"It IS gross. Literally. Your feelings are 100% valid. Don't let anyone try to rugsweep that or tell you you should not feel disgusted and a little violated (especially since your daughter witnessed it!)

Your MIL knows what she did. If she wants to play dumb and your SO wants to play dumb...then does he know that that kind of behavior is a symptom of old age decay? Various illnesses - whether they be dementia, mental illness, brain tumor, etc. Because that shit is inappropriate and it definitely ain't normal. Either she has forgotten what a vibrator is for OR she has forgotten that it's not acceptable in polite society to do what she did...or she actually has serious trauma making her act out in sexually inappropriate ways. It's time for a check up for ole' MIL. SO can either demand that...or tell her what a vibrator is ðŸ˜‚

And I'm no prude, I used to escort for Christ's sake (not literally tho, LOL). I just have my normal meter set straight!"
JUSTNOMIL,fdckkvn,t1_fd79170,1578277216.0,"Yeah I'm assuming/hoping that OP is well off but even still, that doesn't mean MIL should be any less grateful. She was literally paid to fly out to come to an all you can eat buffet and accepted by a family she's not even related to! And she can't even say thank you for the free money and resources she has gobbled up? 
So many people would kill to be in her position, what an entitled ass. She does not deserve this.

She does not deserve to be there for your last Christmas with your parents either, OP. Realise that, that your last memories of your parents could likely have her sulking in the background. If that doesn't matter, more power to you (literally, that takes a lot of strength and I admire it). There are just too many people here who have had precious memories and experiences ruined by some witch that they aren't even fucking related to! Births, firsts, lasts, and deaths. It's a travesty. Those are the posts that stick with me the most. We can't change the past. A lot of work this sub does I see as ""future regret prevention"" lol. 

It honestly makes me ill...imagining your last moments with your parents spent enjoying each other...including someone who you paid to fly out just so they could sulk because they could not **abuse** you as much as they wanted. Eating your food you made with love, breathing up your and your parents' oxygen, and taking up space in your vision and your brain. Without even a thank you. She does not deserve an ounce of your energy. Especially not when there are so many other genuinely important, crucial, things in your life that do! (I get the sense that you aren't going to let that happen haha but it could happen and it's fucked up, the whole situation.)"
JUSTNOMIL,fdcenfi,t1_fdalf5y,1578273032.0,No no no that's a step too far uh uh.
JUSTNOMIL,fda0pte,t1_fd8yprg,1578240363.0,"This just screams so much about her values and worldview!

So short sighted, like so many shitty parents. Only can think about what will happen when he's a teenager? You know, a tiny fraction of your child's life and their relationship with their parents in the grand scheme of things? 

What about the rest of his life? What's the likelihood of him actually coming back and continuing a relationship with his adoptive parents if they refused to tell him the truth. Most kids who ""run away"" with their biological parents maaaybe don't have the best adoptive parents...?

She sounds like so many other parents, who think a relationship after their child turns 18 is automatic and all that matters is keeping the tightest grip on them the whole way. Only cares about the kid staying with her, not their happiness. And if the kid runs away? Well, it can't be anything I did to them!"
JUSTNOMIL,fd5stp3,t1_fd2l0i7,1578181108.0,"Yeah I am curious if MIL was approved to be there...and if so, how on earth that came about??

I will never stop being baffled over MILs feeling entitled to experiencing the birth of...a complete stranger, basically? If I was going to have my MIL there then she would have to be like my mom.

I honestly can't decide which is worse in this case. I mean, in one situation she snuck in and her son rewarded that behavior. Or in the other, poor OP got pressured into letting MIL there only for this to happen."

I am so sorry. Thank you for pointing out what a *""when people tell you who they are, listen""* moment it ended up being. I think it's the same for OP's MIL (and husband). A lot of characters and colors are revealed when awful shit like this goes down."
JUSTNOMIL,fd5qazp,t1_fcznf0j,1578180278.0,"Jesus Christ, I am so sorry."
JUSTNOMIL,fd5orxi,t1_fczdywr,1578179779.0,"Yeah the details of the exact physical actions in those moments (the couple seconds of handing the baby to MIL)  are not the primary issue because...shit happens. Especially in a situation as crazy, high tension, and emotion filled as a childbirth. (I mean, why should MILs get to be at births in the first place?) It's everyone's reactions after the fact that really matter. (I mean, in deciding future relationships, not in OP's pain. Regardless OP has every reason to be in pain even if it was 100% accidental. I'm only speaking on judging them, not OP.)

If husband and MIL had immediately apologized or shown SOME kind of shame over it, but no...she's fucking bragging about it?? How DARE she. It may sound like a small detail, but that's truly fucked up and tells you *everything* you need to know about her character. Where she's at. And you can base where other people are at based on where they are at with her!"
JUSTNOMIL,fd5jnm4,t1_fcz64sw,1578178328.0,"Yeah she should never get to touch that child again. She is a threat and not trustworthy. She blatantly showed she cares about herself more than the child and its mother AKA **dangerous**. 

Those are her priorities, fine, but she does not get any contact with the child. Children are the priority and children are reliant on adults, and MIL is not reliable to give a shit about anything nor anyone except herself: not the feelings of the mother nor the feelings of the baby (who wants to be safe with their mom immediately, not  some stranger; you'd have to be truly delusional to think the baby benefits in any way from being grabbed by MIL right away) nor does she give a shit about polite decorum and basic human decency. 

She feels no shame, another thing that makes her dangerous. Her bragging about this is why I'm writing this comment. Shame is how we control other people. She doesn't give a shit about how other people feel and how her actions affect them, how she hurts them...and she doesn't care how she's viewed for those actions that only benefit herself. All of us here would feel pretty fucking ashamed after doing something like that. We wouldn't brag about it. What people do and do not feel ashamed about is what truly reveals their character, in my opinion.  

She's a threat, plain and simple, let your mama bear come out and fuck anyone else. I'm not saying she will do anything bad, let me be clear (I'm not trying to fear monger). I'm saying that she has 100% earned to be firmly in the ""not safe"" camp. A baby is the most vulnerable being on the planet. There are people and things that are safe and MIL does not belong on that list and that's important. Be wary of anyone who says otherwise. This event will get to tell you a lot about the character of others as well, based on their reactions."
JUSTNOMIL,fd5h4wv,t1_fd1o0vs,1578177591.0,"It's crazy how there are two realities, one in which this does not sound so unbelievably cringey to people. Like, I would cringe sooo bad if I heard some lady bragging about stealing a baby like that. 

You didn't earn it, you cretin. So you can move fast and your son is ~~an idiot~~ loving son...those are the only things you can brag about."

JUSTNOMIL,fd59gfh,t1_fd4i53t,1578175387.0,Yesss when she said this was happening all over text I was happy. Not only because she did she not have to see her in person...now she has even more proof of everything!

I blame religion. But that applies to most things lol. (The shitty women like this are usually very religious though.)
Hell, a lot of the awful shit like genital mutilation is physically done by the women (same with foot wrapping from the past and similar things). 

I am not trying to be one of those people that whenever someone responds surprised is like *everything is horrible don't you know that stupid* though I'm just angry ranting. I fucking hate people who do that. 

It is always ridiculous when someone does something like that, but like others have said maybe she had an easy childbirth...or she is so brainwashed to forget it? or she just saw the opportunity to make money and gain clout? Capitalism babbyyy! No matter what her actual experience, she saw the opportunity to get money and attention and went for it. 

No matter what, fuck. her."

We should all be in power then...right? I mean, we are literally smarter and better than God and can trick all men. All they talk about is how smart women are. I take it as their admission that we are better rulers than they are! How much clearer can these guys state it?? Maybe since they are too scared to admit it outright and lose their cred, this has been how they've been trying to communicate it...

I hear you MGTOW, loud and clear. Mommy's here. I know, I know, women are smarter than you.  ðŸ˜‚"

If after every birth, you just jumped up and were immediately back to how you were before, there's your baby now you are in tip top shape, and all discomfort was 100% contained in those hours....Well, that wouldn't make labor suddenly painless or better, but the fact that it isn't actually over is what truly freaks me out. I do think I could head into a painful childbirth better if I knew the pain would actually end at some point soon? 

The pain isn't one and done, there's a recovery process. You have to heal. Shit hurts and it hurts to pee and shit. 

That's why the whole being kicked in the balls comparison is laughable. Time matters more than everything. Labor not only covers time much beyond that, but when it's over the pain isn't over either! 

I also bring this up because the recovery process is not common knowledge enough, paid maternity leave is not taken as seriously, men are asking their wives for sex the next day, etc."
