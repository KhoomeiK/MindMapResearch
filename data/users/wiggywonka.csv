Just checked your post history and seems like you are one of those fragile white people who thinks whites are victimized. Nice explains how you cant see this post is racist"
apexlegends,ffq4v7n,t1_ffq0sh9,1580120598.0,"Except people saying ""asians all look the same"" has been a racist stereotype said in the west for decades. No matter if they are wearing makeup or have similar outfits. Saying kpop idols ""all look the same"" has an obvious racist connotation to it. I dont know why your vehemently defending racist point of views. 

Them being in a group doesnt justify people saying they all look the same. People wouldn't say that to a soloist because obviously they have no one else to compare them to, while you can compare group members looks to each other. 

People have similar hairstyles in every single country depending on what's currently trending on that specific country. Also really? You really gonna say that choreography makes them all look the same? What the hell do you mean by ""sameyness"" anyways? That's like saying everyone on a movie set looks the same because they are all wearing costumes and hair styles designed to fit the movies setting. Which makes no sense because they all have their own unique facial features."

apexlegends,ffpyxf1,t1_ffpw7qz,1580111563.0,"This is clearly false. It has more to do with the fact that white people here arent used to seeing asians, making it hard for them to see the subtle differences within their face.
