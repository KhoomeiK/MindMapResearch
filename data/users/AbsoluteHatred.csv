wwiipics,ffd2937,t1_ffd1t6e,1579811986.0,"Victims of circumstance? They were the army of a genocidal fascist regime, who committed atrocities in every country they set foot in. Their actions were institutionalized across their entire military. Neither the Wehrmacht or the SS were clean, as a whole they were guilty. There is a huge difference between saying fuck the US because trump is an idiot and fuck nazis because they murdered millions. That is a false equivalency and no where near accurate to the situation or discussion at hand."
wwiipics,ffd17ix,t1_ffcshqv,1579811401.0,Nah fuck Nazis and the horse they rode in on. They murdered their way across the majority of Europe and need no sympathy. People in my family tree are dead due to their actions.
todayilearned,ffcyunr,t1_ffcsuc4,1579810094.0,"For your point about tanks being rare, early in the island hopping campaigns they were. But in the Philippines and Okinawa they were used pretty extensively. Even LVTs were converted into essentially light tanks with the LVT(A) 1 and 4. Tank vs tank battles however were almost unheard of."

Many of them including Obama were against gay marriage for years, many voted for wars when now they regret it. A politician changing their views for the better should be welcomed, not ridiculed."

wwiipics,ff9a17i,t1_ff997tr,1579708259.0,"The SS was a literal criminal organization as a whole, they committed war crimes on every front. The SS even sent out a unit made of convicted murderers, rapists, etc during the Warsaw uprising.  While even the Wehrmacht committed war crimes, the SS was institutionally a Nazi organization from the start."
TankPorn,ff96dcy,t1_ff8hfw0,1579705907.0,"I've always preferred the more elongated front glacis of the later T series tanks, compared to the much steeper looking T-55."

CombatFootage,ff46113,t1_ff45c56,1579556315.0,"Some islands were bypassed, but others were taken due to their strategic positioning. Iwo Jima was taken to be used an an emergency airfield for B29 bombers coming from Japan."

todayilearned,fekpy1a,t1_fekjjnr,1579205182.0,More Soviet POWs in German hands died than German POWs in Soviet hands.
todayilearned,fekoua3,t1_fekmwfo,1579204524.0,"The Wehrmacht committed just as much, if not more war crimes than the SS did. Especially on the eastern front, they complied with Generalplan Ost and the Commissar Order. The Heer was especially complicit, burning, raping, and murdering their way through the Soviet Union. The clean Wehrmacht myth mostly stems from W. Germany becoming a West ally during the Cold War, along with surviving generals writing their own testimonies about the war. Suspiciously these testimonies put all blame for them losing the war on Hitler, or the false idea SU just used human wave attacks."
todayilearned,fekoj1l,t1_feklpfi,1579204341.0,"I was never taught an exaggerated story of WW2, the Soviet GPW was gone into great detail by my high school history teacher. Especially with the Soviet dominance in Op Bagration."
todayilearned,fekocn7,t1_fekis6u,1579204233.0,"The Germans may have gotten close to Moscow, but they did not come close to defeating the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union had already won the border war against the Japanese. Their factories were moved to the Urals, the Germans did not have enough supplies to take the Soviet Union. Their only chance of being able to continue mainly consisted of needing to take the Caucus oil fields, which is doubtful the allies would have left unharmed if lost. Russia was great at destroying anything useful to the Germans before retreating, the US/British would have been able to still send supplies and bombing raids. Germany had lost the war from the outset of Operation Barbarossa and Generalplan Ost. If they're strategic goals weren't based on genocidal racism, then maybe they would've had more help from 'liberating' the Soviet border states. German production was horrendous, they were never near finishing an atomic bomb either due to it being 'jewish' science."

todayilearned,fek3fzd,t1_fek2dac,1579191793.0,"I like how people blame Churchill for the famine and you know, not the Imperial Japanese Military. For invading Burma and sinking countless ships, both of these leaving less and less options for food for India. People also point out he denied Canadian grain shipments, but he approved larger shipments from Australia."

HistoryPorn,fe6kxsa,t1_fe6i736,1578894333.0,"Russian Deep Battle and German Bewegungskrieg* are different philosophies, you can also not forget Svechin. There were multiple people who helped pioneer this style of warfare. 
Only 3.7-7.7% of Red Army officers were purged, with 30% of those allowed to return. Many purged were not even killed either, just expelled from the party and their position. 

*Blitzkrieg was never used as an official Wehrmacht term."
USMC,fdyeixj,t1_fdybs6v,1578778902.0,"Lol nice passive aggressive as fuck comment. I'm sorry the entire Marine Corps is a bunch of retards, I'll bow before the all knowing Corpsman. Cause no ones ever met a Corpsman who didn't know the fuck what they were doing. None of this has to do with OPSEC, a random account messaging you on instagram is not the end of the world. Everyone is spammed by either follow requests or message requests by bots on IG. If that was true, they'd just outright ban social media for service members. I've seen SNCO/Officers and their dependas have worse OPSEC breaches than any lower enlisted. Usually cause the lower enlisted don't know jack shit, but keep being elitist that's cool bro."
USMC,fdyb28v,t1_fdy8ahe,1578777910.0,"SMS messages are sent via phone numbers tied to a sim card, the IMEI has nothing to do with that. Doubt some random kid on IG is capable of stealing my IMEI number that easily."
