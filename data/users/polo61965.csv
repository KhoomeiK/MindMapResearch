DotA2,ff38mcp,t1_ff371ws,1579536274.0,"Good players can win any lane, but slark can win against any solo off str hero in any bracket pretty much. Slark forces you to farm the large camps and leech xp in lane. You step up to the lane he pounces and takes your str and hp, and since he takes your str you're pretty much guaranteed to lose the trade, and that's still not accounting for the support. The play is usually to either pick a nonstr offlaner like DS, and cripple him midgame when he's still easy to kill and has no means of teamfighting."

Had to file a police report or else amazon wasn't going to reimburse me, even when I had video proof that the delivery didn't arrive at the time it was supposedly delivered. I thought UPS was bad, but the new amazon delivery service forces them to place faith in their own guys, which falls on us to prove they can steal stuff just as any other mailman could, which unfortunately has happened to me way too often without proper resolution. Meanwhile I still get a call and sometimes get required to sign when they drop off small packages costing less than $10. Must be slim pickings for them to hire those people."
