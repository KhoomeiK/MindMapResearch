I also understand that getting a fake number sucks if you are not a potentially dangerous people. You told them so they would know right away if it is fake but you also told them not to say anything and just delete the fake number. This way the women get the security of not giving out their number and your friends have the knowledge that it's fake and not to waste their time.
