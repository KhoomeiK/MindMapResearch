WeightLossAdvice,fewxg3g,t3_eqpr30,1579420975.0,"Make sure you’re getting a solid amount of movement in when you’re not in the gym. Luckily for me, I burn just as many calories in a work week (I bus tables) as I do in a week’s worth of workouts, and it made cutting weight a hell of a lot easier than it would have been working a not so active job. Also, I know you want this to be a quick process, I get that, but I’m going to kindly ask you to not set a hard deadline to be jacked. It’s stressful, hurts your self image thinking “I should look like this right now but I don’t,” and it just isn’t a good mental mindset to put yourself on a timer like that. Also when you start bulking, try your best to make sure you have 1 gram of protein for every pound you weigh each day"
AmItheAsshole,fewhtb8,t3_eqi79c,1579410831.0,"NTA - Massive bruh moment here. They offered $500 for finding their cat, and then had the balls to call you a dick for taking a lesser amount of money than what THEY chose to offer to whenever found the cat. This is my inner pettiness coming out but I would totally mail an invoice for the remaining $180 just so the husband can ~have his way~ when it comes to you being a “dick.” Fuck that guy man. He shouldn’t be offering that kind of cash if he’s going to be as snobby as every other Benz driver in existence"
loseit,few2sfm,t1_feucj4h,1579404666.0,"Good for you my friend!! I actually think that reasoning makes a lot of sense. I’ve been a bigger dude pretty much ever since middle school and my close friends know that self-image is something I’ve had an issue with my entire life, so some of them just wait to talk about it until I bring it up, which I genuinely don’t mind at all if that’s the thought process that goes through their heads"

personalfinance,fery0lz,t3_eqfly3,1579359477.0,"I went to my normal drive thru chase ATM yesterday to deposit my $600 of tips from Sunday-Wednesday night (it was 50s and 20s so it didn’t go over the 30 bill limit), and it ate all of it. After that, it gave me a screen that said to call a 1-800 number to “be sure your deposit went through” and printed a receipt that said the same thing. I called and had to be put through to claims where (disclaimer: I’ve been banking with chase ever since I got my first debit card 6 years ago and this is the first problem I’ve ever had with them) the man i was talking to tried to hurry me off the call and wasn’t being attentive at all. I very clearly stated what I did and what happened and he still asked me at least three times “how much cash were you trying to withdraw?”

Long story short, call that number ( 1 (800) 935-9935 ) and just explain what happened to whoever takes your call, and they should do pretty much what they did with me. Connect you to someone in claims (I’m sorry if a what should be 5 minute call turns into a 45 minute ordeal like my situation) who will file a report and give you a temporary account credit (they gave me $300, only half of the amount I put in the ATM) and then let you know that you’ll get a letter regarding the details of your call in the next ten days"

StudentLoans,feo91sc,t3_epzwuo,1579296734.0,"If you know 100% that you can get a better return rate than your remaining loans’ interest rates by investing (whether it be mutual funds, a 401k, IRA, etc.), put your money where it’ll grow while you make that low monthly payment. I know it’d be nice to be completely student debt-free, but long term, you’ll be able to spend more flexibly if need be. On top of it, you’ll have your money working for you opposed to dumping another large chunk of it at once and never seeing a cent of that again

CasualConversation,fdc2zyv,t1_fbtp0ds,1578266079.0,"Sorry for not getting back to you, haven't been on Reddit in a while. Thanks so much for your kind words as well!  Funny enough, my weight loss wasn't extremely consistent the whole time.  There were some weeks where I would lose 2-4 pounds, others where I'd only lose 1 or 2, multiple times where I plateaued, and a few oddball weeks also in the mix.  I had immediately changed up my diet right after the semester ended, and (I went down to FL to visit my grandparents for a week) also got right in the gym 5 days that first week, dropped my first 7 pounds really quickly.  I was down to 215 in the middle of August, and that was my first plateau.  I was stuck between 215 and 220 for probably three weeks until I finally broke under 215, and then I slowly but surely made my way down to 205 while putting some muscle on my body, and that was where I had my next and definitely longest plateau.  I wasn't working my job bussing tables for pretty much all of November (travel, family, all that good stuff), and then when I got back to it at the start of December, everything was back in control.  I hit a small 5-7 day stretch where I was 202.4 every single time I stepped on the scale, and as soon as I dropped to 201.8, I kinda knew it would all work out for my end of year goal.

Luckily where I live (Ohio) there’s a lot of general sports talk, mainly pertaining to letdowns (Go Browns, Go Cavs!), so I get along with Bengals fans really well even though I know next to nothing about the team. I don’t really care all that much about hockey, which Columbus Blue Jackets fans don’t seem to mind, and they’re actually really understanding on how hockey isn’t the most popular. In terms of fitting in, I just stress the most recent year i kept up with news in that specific sport (eg: “I haven’t really followed the Bengals all that closely since Carson Palmer left”). I’ve just learned that keeping it general keeps conversation going and that as long as you’re in a group, you don’t really need to get into specifics"
AmItheAsshole,fc690yx,t3_egbnex,1577475058.0,"NTA - and I don’t blame you for feeling the way you do. I’m the oldest of 4 kids (19m, 16m, 13m, 11f), and all four of us have iPads. My 16 year old brother and I don’t even touch ours at this point because we got them so long ago (7-8 years if I had to guess), but my youngest brother and sister have a real problem with theirs. When I first saw your post I kinda thought you were my mom or dad until the context gave away that your kids are younger than my brother and me. My youngest two siblings got their iPads at age like 5 or 6 (as an alternative to a Nintendo gameboy, which my brother and I got at that same age), and it’s developed into an awful problem. My 13y/o brother puts up a fight with my parents whenever they ask him to give it back or tell him to go to bed. My sister is no better since she was never properly taught how to behave, and she’ll end up screaming and crying after being on it for hours on end. Neither of them can do a single thing without their iPads. They sit and play on them while our family is eating, and only don’t do that when my dad is home to actually put a foot down. Quick 5 minute trip with mom to Walgreens? “Let me grab my iPad first.”

All in all, I don’t blame you at all for how you feel given I’ve seen what technology does to kids who are too young to understand that they can’t spend all their time on them. In addition, your in-laws are just dumb for not running that by you. NTA"
