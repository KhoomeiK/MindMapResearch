no, I stated a fact as represented in a medical paper and cited the source."
AskReddit,ffyxmiq,t1_ffyupmc,1580357747.0,"fair enough, I'll chew on that for a bit.  

initial reaction would be that it's a similar situation, but not precisely the same.  I've only got a layman's understanding of it, so couple questions if you're up for it (assuming you're more knowledgeable than me here).

1) under what conditions would these cells need to fully develop into a human?  shining if you plop them into a petri dish, they're just going to expire, would they thrive and develop in a different environment?

2) again, layman here, my understanding is stem cells are ""triggered"" into becoming other types of cells, and embryonic stem cells are essentially a precursor to that.  Is that a decent understanding?

one other thing, because it kind of bothered me and would like to be clear for anyone reading.  you mentioned the word murder, I do not view abortion as murder.  I view it as ending a life.  similar to, but not the same as soldiers at war, cows to slaughter, or slapping a mosquito on your arm... the latter two being much less consequential than the former."
AskReddit,ffyukhh,t1_ffysblz,1580355510.0,"a couple points, and then we can put it to bed, because I'm not trying to change your mind here.

stem cells, again by themselves will never turn into a human, they'll turn into other human cell types.  working with them isn't murder.

second, a fertilized egg is not cancerous by definition.. it is not uncontrolled growth and will not spread to other areas of a woman's body, in fact it will try to leave her body.

AskReddit,ffyruyz,t1_ffyoqh1,1580353601.0,">Science does not define when life begins though

almost, science does not have a true definition of *life* itself, let alone when it begins.  admittedly my above post is ambiguous to what I was trying to convey.

> that's a philosophical question that will only have subjective answers.

this is exactly what I was trying to avoid, so to clarify further if I can.  while there isn't a catch all science based definition of life in general, there are a list of characteristics of life that can be applied to a lot of types of life, but what is pertinent is specially mammals.  

these are the things we learned in middle school biology.. cellular organization, reproduction, metabolism, response to stimuli, growth, etc.

sperm and eggs individually do not meet all these characteristics, but left in it's natural environment (a healthy womb), a healthy fertilized egg will meet all of these characteristics.  to me, that's a pretty objective way of defining life (again specially mammalian).  

is that a human life?  maybe, maybe not.. that's where it becomes a grey area, but personally, I think it is.. simply because if nothing changes but time, it will, under healthy normal circumstances, become something everyone can agree is a human at some point.  furthermore, there is no rational point in fetal development where you can point to it and say, X condition has been met, now it's a human.  it's DNA is human, and it's technically alive, therefore, it should be human life, no?

what do you think?  do you have other objective ways of thinking about this?

AskReddit,ffyjc14,t1_ffyeyjf,1580347796.0,">For clarification, in what situations do you find it morally wrong? 

honestly I try not to think of it in terms of right or wrong, passing judgement on other's personal decisions is something I'm working hard on to avoid.  that being said I'm a human and it bubbles up regardless sometimes.  

to answer your question though, I feel like there's a giant difference between a rape victim getting an abortion vs someone who is consistently irresponsible when it comes to sex.

on the very fringe, there are folks that take a very flippant attitude to the matter as well.  as mentioned earlier, Michelle Wolf has a joke basically says abortions should be handed out like candy.  the vibe being ""it's no big deal because it's the equivalent of getting a random growth removed"".  to be clear, I love her and think the joke is funny as hell, but I don't like the sentiment.  

tangentially, I think that sentiment is a direct result from years of abuse from hardcore anti-abortionists.  I understand it, just strongly disagree with it.

> but if you understand the choice they are making in those examples, does that not mean you would remain in the pro-choice camp?
 
perhaps you misread?  I'm still pro-choice, but do believe that it is a decision to end a life.  

the simplest way I can sum up my position is ""try your damnedest to not get yourself into that position because you'll be responsible for ending a life""

AskReddit,ffyciil,t1_ffy85pl,1580343162.0,">You don't concede to a personal belief.

well, I realised I couldn't be objective in coming up with a definitive answer to the question, so I turned to the scientific definition of life and went with that.

my concession was moving from ""is this a human"" to ""is this life"".  the latter is most definitely not a personal belief, while the former is.

the hardest part of that is reconciling the fact that the ""pro-choice"" is choosing to end a life, which ultimately means there should be just cause for it.  

morally that means situations like rape, medical pregnancy problems, or even birth control failing are all very justifiable, but I have trouble with the idea of it the way Michelle Wolf jokes about it.

legally speaking, I don't think there should be any requirements around it however, and that's simply because any laws will eventually be manipulated to keep control over people."

>This is dumb, why do we make it so if you lose your job and get sick you don’t get the same care.
>
>Your employer should not be involved in your healthcare.

I get what your intention is, but this is a misrepresentation of how it actually works.

For those that don't know, Americans use private health insurance plans mostly to cover their healthcare.  Employers typically offer their employees access to a group plan that the company negotiates on behalf of said employees.  In addition, most employers will cover some or all of the premiums due to the insurance company (the latter being fairly rare) as an additional benefit for being an employee there.

This model has become so ubiquitous that many folks confuse the process and simply think you have to have a job to have health coverage, which is untrue, as you can buy insurance yourself, or pay medical bills directly.

All this to say, it's a dumb system that needs to go away."

> Personal finance may be simpler than math taught in school, but how do you know to seek it out if you've never been exposed to it, or had to deal with finances?
