Parkinsons,fftma9n,t1_fftg3r0,1580224166.0,That’s amazing! I’m going to check into this. Thank you
Parkinsons,fftlo45,t1_ffqvzj2,1580223735.0,Yes I like that it’s natural. He’s already on so many meds
Parkinsons,ffsfhst,t1_ffqzlxv,1580180428.0,He’s 78. I doubt I’d be able to get him involved in that. He hates leaving the house now due to the mental side effects. Paranoid states especially
Parkinsons,ffsf5qu,t1_ffs61dl,1580180203.0,That does suck. I wish my grandfather would try the real stuff. I’ll try approaching it again. The main symptom above all else is probably the horrible moods and paranoid states he goes into. It’s so hard to see him that way.
AskReddit,ffsef9v,t1_ffscyrp,1580179706.0,"Oh my gosh, my heart breaks for you and your Mom. I’m so very sorry. You’re very sweet for being concerned and trying to help!
I’d say one thing that helps is keeping up on chores and picking up. If her living space is cleaned up than that can help make her feel more relaxed instead of running around doing chores. Make sure you are keeping up on your school work. Keep her informed on what’s going on with your grades. If you get a good grade, tell her! As a parent, she will feel proud and knowing you are doing well will make her relieved. Little things go a long way too. If you sense that she’s down, give her a big hug and tell her you love her! Also, plan at in home movie night. Make or buy some of her favorite snacks and watch a funny movie together. I hope some of this helps. Bless your beautiful little soul for caring so much."
Parkinsons,ffscy2h,t1_ffs6v5g,1580178726.0,"Great, thank you so much! I’m going to search for some high quality oil online and have him take it with him to the next doctors appointment to consult with them first."
