GetMotivated,fegtu6c,t1_fegswew,1579102394.0,"I am already very educated on narcissism and sharing a personal story, or simply talking about one self, is not NPD. But, looking for someones buttons, then proceding to pressing them continously in hopes of agetating someone for your own amusement, however, is a very comon way for narcissists to get supply. Claiming to 'not care' with words, while simultaneously making the opposite very obvious with your actions, is comon narcissist behaviour. Yes, I have diagnosed you. You are welcome."

Even if it lead to wrath, the silent treatment or punishment on his part. I would ask 'what is it that makes you think that is acceptable behaviour' etc. He hated it and that is very likely why things got worse quickly, but probably also why it ended quicker. (We only lasted 10 hellish months. Lived together that whole time.) He got very little satisfying supply from me, and he wasn't able to the play victim role in the end, like with his ex. Which I know he was ***yearning*** for.  Getting all his friends to rally up behind their ''wounded'' friend, while also turning them all against me. That would give him a high to last him for weeks. No one turned on me, he made a fool of himself and I was clearly both stronger and better without him after. I was his worst Narc nightmare, and I am somewhat proud."

NarcissisticAbuse,fdmvxt1,t3_em6gsa,1578568316.0,interesting. This would explain why I sometimes act out of character and do/say things that I don't mean in front of some people. It's scary if you don't understand it.
LifeAfterNarcissism,fdgr1mj,t3_elal4j,1578406095.0,"I am so sorry to hear that, it is very strong that you do all of this while dealing with it. I have not worked, I do not have kids, and I had great support from new boyfriend. But the rage was surprising. The trauma drove me crazy before I got better, just recently. Anger is not just understandable, it is to be expected after a narc. Don't blame yourself for being angry, that is the last thing you need now. Therapy can help. There is also a lot of psychiatrists and other victims that talk about it on youtube. Maby that can give you something. Writing letters to him that you throw away or burn can also help. The gym is a good idea, get all that negative energy out."

Because trans men and women are REAL men and women according to BASIC LGBT+ standards. Saying that they are not is to make them in to a third gender, and that is transphobic no matter how you turn it. Any kind of phobia (trans-, bi- etc) is never welcomed in the LGBTQ community. So even if you YOU are a bisexual that isn't attrackted to trans people, doesn't mean that trans people aren't included in to the sexuality as a whole. YOUR preference does not make the sexuality. Trans men and women have always AND WILL ALWAYS be included in bisexuality. Because anything else is phobic."

I had my make-up in it, I don't know why I didn't take it off the bed before sleeping. Anyway, I fell right back to sleep. It's like I blink and it's morning again, dad is at my door and tell me to come out of my room to see something. My parents and siblings stand outside my room and everything about this is so bizarr, I just woke up, everyone is gathered, I have no idea what is going on haha. Anyway, dad point to the floor and there is small black spots, drawn on the ground, with an even distance from each other. Leading from my room, through the kitchen and to the hallway. Ending at the door. Dad measures the distance between the dots and there is almost EXACTLY the same distance between all of them. My sister is starting to freak out assuming aliens or demons. Then I found my eye-liner, it's all smudged and it's clear that the dots were made by this pen. Then my dad ask me to put my foot in front of the other, heel to toe. Turns out my feet was the exact distance as between the dots. So apparently, I'm guessing after I woke up by the box falling. I fell back asleep, got up, picked up my eye-liner, then took these heel to toe steps, making dots every step of the way, through the kitchen, to the hallway."

adhdwomen,fctydry,t3_eire15,1577965690.0,"I have been disgnosed with both, but I am starting doubt my ADD diagnosis. Autism is over sensetivity to input (touch, smell, hearing, seeing.) A nerutypical can walk down the street and their brain cancle out anything that isn't life threatening. So they will pay attention to moving cars, other people, bikes etc. But kind of ignore anything else that isn't 'necessary.' But an autistic brain does not do that, so we **see** ***everything all the time***. Which can be exhausting and overwhelming. An overload of input can lead to elopment and panic attacks, depending on how sensetive you are. Autism is also being socially confused, input such as conversation come in differently, it's harder to process a conversation with several people and we are likely to misunderstand the message in the conversation. Autists usually have unusual interest that they become experts of, while lacking in other areas that seem like normal information to others. Like they will know everything there is to know about all kinds of seaturtles, but don't have any idea how to deal with their taxes. Autists exist in their own time and space. We flow differently. ADD/ADHD is a problem with focus. Thoughts come and go quickly. They are chronically forgetfull. Struggle to read any long text. Get chores done etc. There is a difference, but I think all ADD/ADHD/borderline etc is related to autism and saying 'I am on the spectrum' work more as an over all term. I have learned recently how comon it is for people (specially women) with PTSD and CPTSD to get misdiagnosed with 'mental illness' when it is not, and medicating yourself for it can actually worsen the PTSD symptoms. This is what I thnk happened to me. I think I have autism becuse I clearly have this sensetivity to input. But I think my CPTSD was confused as ADD and the medication only exacerbated the CPTSD symptoms (such as flashbacks and anger.)"

problems,fc2ie38,t3_efqae7,1577361870.0,"I know how you feel, the double standards are very prominent when skinny. It's an insult to point out someones fat, but pointing out someones small size is acceptable. It's also okay to say shit like 'men like curves, not bones.' but say anything similair about someone fat and you're an asshole. It sucks watching all the women with curves complaining about being fat and ugly, when in reality they just have the womanly shapes another dream to have, and are not fat in the least. Then you never have the same right to hate yourself for being skinny, because that is everyones goal. You're supposed to support your friends through their self-hating rants, but don't get the same support back. A lot of girl also do that thing, where they stand and look at you and go 'urgh, should we just hate her for fitting in to a size4?' even if they are totally joking, it's annoying as fuck.  You're stuck in some wierd place where everyone get to 'hate you' for being skinny, but you don't get to hate yourself for being skinny.
