ufl,ff1t0ye,t3_er3hdg,1579485526.0,Were the only lesbians in our middle school --> actually really liked each other --> went to the same high school --> both gained interest in engineering --> both got into UF --> seven year anniversary in May.
college,fee10bs,t3_eomjwv,1579024139.0,"I study fairly consistently throughout the week (like half an hour a day per subject), and then if I have a big test coming up I go into crunch mode and up that to several hours per day but only in the subject the test is in."
ufl,fdsch1u,t3_emvgie,1578699455.0,"Hey I'm in the same boat as you! I've been doing all of the daily readings to understand the lectures better, as well as going to office hours if I have questions. Once the homework ramps up, I'm probably gonna be in Broward Hall for tutoring or studying with my friend group, if you wanna join. LMK if you wanna meet up in Marston/LibWest/anywhere really to study for a quiz or something :D"

childfree,fd6qs0d,t3_ehnv5y,1578194576.0,Just moved back into my dorm for spring semester! Hopefully the number of bingos and amount of general breeder fuckery goes down.
ufl,fd613pe,t3_ek0zd3,1578184062.0,"I found CHM2046 to be obnoxiously hard, but IDS1161 is a cake walk. One discussion board post + two replies a week, a final essay and audio recording, and two books that you can BS your way through."
college,fd5z5ak,t3_ek1amd,1578183341.0,"It depends! For me, I barely see mine. Her family lives relatively close to the college (about an hour away) so she goes home to see them every weekend. I'm six hours away from mine, so I get the dorm to myself on weekends and short breaks. I also have a pretty active extracurricular life, plus a demanding academic schedule that means long hours in the library, and we don't have more than a couple of friends in common, so I don't usually hang out with her. We're very cordial with each other and we check in on each other a lot, but in general whenever I think about her it's on the neutral-to-positive side. Hope this helps :D"
childfree,fcijtlv,t1_fcij2lb,1577663744.0,"H kind of did; she said that she doesn't work for free and that they were the ones that need practice watching kids on a night out. We left shortly after that. She said that that was her most badass moment of 2019, and I'm inclined to agree."
childfree,fcie8hy,t3_eh5eub,1577661228.0,"I remember that project. I did it for a week in 8th grade and the first night I had it I was so stressed out that I planned on talking to the teacher and asking for an alternative assignment. It was hell, and definitely contributed to my childfree stance."
college,fbyvh43,t3_eesx1h,1577227429.0,That’s how it worked for my friend who dual enrolled and for my AP and IB credits. I think it’s normal.
