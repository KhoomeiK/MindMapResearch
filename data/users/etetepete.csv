This is just a corporation pandering to naive kids to buy their product. This corporation is a soul-less behemoth that would sell your organs if it made a reasonable margin of profit with it.

It's one of those cancer organisms that keep on growing and killing the planet earth, and eating all the wealth away from the middle class.

Don't spread their viral propaganda please."

Today our squad is  more balanced and generally better, but for a long time he was the only true star and the backbone of our team. Other mentionable players where Arnautovic, Junuzovic and Dragovic. Very good players and well respected. We have other good players too, but this just shows how slavic surnames are very common and normal in Austria.

The biggest reason was the wage gap, and where eastern european businesses would tax their income. Its not racism you ignoramus.
