I’m a huge fan of a super heavy, low-end double floor tom setup. I’ve played around with unconventional kit arrangements, but I’ve struggled to get comfortable with anything except for the standard 4-piece jazz kit w/ 1 crash, 1 ride, and 1 set of hats. Playing shows around town for a decade-plus gave me a newfound respect for smaller kits. Independent touring drummers with massive kits must have the patience of a saint. 

Ever listen to [Deerhoof](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6KwzgIePF4CZ2JXLYMw_kp2iWCVP2aPI)? Legendary noise rock band from the Bay Area. Their drummer, Greg Saunier, who is a mad genius and a classically trained musician, typically performs live with nothing more than a kick, snare, and hi-hats. He is one of the most talented, inventive drummers I’ve ever seen."

Since we’re pointing stuff out — “the human eye can distinguish between **millions of different colours**,” not merely 10,000. If we could only see 10,000 colors, the color complexity of our world, for lack of a better analogy, would look much better than a Nintendo game, but slightly worse than a Super Nintendo game (256 vs. 65,356 colors) 

Also, it doesn’t explicitly state that mantis shrimp can’t see more than 20 colors, just that they don’t appear to be able to tell the difference between light at extremely short wavelengths. Is that the same thing?"

The cinematography was fantastic. It really feels like a relic from the ‘80s. Would love to see more horror explore the Satanic Panic phenomenon. The lunar eclipse as an omen had potential as a cool plot idea, but it felt very superficial and ultimately served no purpose beyond “it’s creepy.” While excruciatingly suspenseful, the pacing felt a little lopsided and the ending was unsatisfying and abrupt — character development for 40 minutes, getting sorta creepy, holyfuckheblewherheadoff, putz around spooky house for 30 minutes, ahhhhsatanicdemonritual, I escaped somehow, killkillkill, am Satan’s mom now, end."

This looks more complicated than it really is. Basically, you make 2 different balls of seitan dough — a red “meaty” batch and a white “fatty” batch — which are layered and par-baked to create one fat slab of bacon. Then you slice off rashers and pan fry them to order. The layers replicate the fat marbling of piggie bacon. You can also go the lazy route and skip the white batch altogether. I like the novelty of marbling though. It’s worth the extra effort.

I also add 1/4 tsp of MSG to the white batch since it’s a little bland on its own. MSG has an unfair (and historically racist) reputation, but I love cooking with it.  Enjoy!"
