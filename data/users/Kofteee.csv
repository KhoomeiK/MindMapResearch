AstralProjection,felcejw,t1_fel9h9w,1579218888.0,"From what I’ve read death of toddlers and babies are usually a lesson for the parents, if we are all hear to experience and learn a lesson u could also be here to teach others a lesson and once that purpose is done u can go back to source/die (which makes it sound much more grim), and I can’t really say much about serial killers but I’m sure there’s an explanation behind it just have to read around.

I personally haven’t gone looking for an explanation of such behaviors so I don’t want to misinform anyone on that. But I will look into it because it’s a very interesting point, lmk if u decide to look into it and learn any reasoning behind it too"

AstralProjection,fekyijy,t1_feklsp9,1579210245.0,"If you think about it by having cold parents, and an unstable home you have learned to appreciate having a warm welcoming home... maybe thats why u chose this life and this lesson for urself originally?  I mean no offense I had a very similar life growing up, still I have crumbs of a relationship with my father and thinking of it as something planned makes it more comforting in a way, for me at least."
AstralProjection,fekxxzd,t1_fekwg0l,1579209905.0,"Im glad it makes sense even tho its only \~kinda, its quite difficult to articulate thoughts to describe something metaphysical, since we all experience and see these things in our minds eye."

AstralProjection,fekrmb3,t1_feklhni,1579206168.0,"It’s very fascinating to think of this world as a simulation and to put it in perspective if that was the case I imagine it would be something similar to the way the matrix worked..

Like how they would plug into a machine, that could be like connecting to source. 

For the first question u could be right that it was created, but for me source is just the universe it’s not something that exists it is existence it’s self. Does that make sense?"

AstralProjection,fekpyac,t1_fekbul2,1579205186.0,"Thank u for responding so kindly and I've noticed growing up my two closest friends one was catholic, other jewish, and I  muslim yet every time we discussed our religions with each other we only noticed how similar they are. Its like in our nature to treat each other well, and all those behaviors considered ""sins"" are usually just acts from a lower vibration, which limits us from being close to source. 

An example would be like drinking, it is accepted in forms such as wine or small portions, but if its excessive some organized religions consider it a sin. Which is because it inhabits us from being conscious, we have less control over ourselves, and our mindset when drunk, not to mention it is damaging to our organs, therefore we are vibrationally at a lower state of being. 

And on the flip side of the coin when we meditate, or pray we raise our vibrations to higher frequency and become closer to ""god"" or source."
AstralProjection,fekgw46,t1_fek9x2t,1579199792.0,"YES EXACTLY THIS. I love that you experienced such a beautiful journey I had a similar ""welcoming"" experience while meditating on shrooms, and I also believe we are all ""god"" and that we chose the life we are living. This ideology even makes sense with reincarnation and that belief system, as in we choose to live however many times we want, and why some people remember their past lives."
AstralProjection,fek818k,t3_epkxs9,1579194538.0,"I believe we are all part of collective consciousness, we are all part of a ""source"" that our energy will return to once we die. Because of the fact that energy cant be destroyed only transformed.

 I hope my explanation is making sense, so our soul is just an independent manifestation of something that broke apart from a bigger whole to experience life on earth and learn its lessons. 

Therefore the whole idea of enlightenment is just connecting back to source in a way to draw power or knowledge from it, when we meditate and go into a deep trance that is a form of connection, or when u trip or have an out of body experience, you name it.

 If there is any question ask away I'd love to answer, or if anyone wants book recommendations that talks about a similar belief. I was raised Muslim and a lot of my core morals of - dont steal, be kind, etc.- is a result of my growing up, and for a long time I believed that source was Allah, but then I just realized thats just a name to describe source, for example u can call source god or the universe, whatever pleases ur heart. Religion and spirituality is better when its personal, once you subscribe to organized religion it more often than not becomes judgmental in the community. 

But if its just between u and source (god) no one can tell u ur doing something wrong or right, because u make the rules and u make the connection."

Im sorry but she threw your happiness out the window the moment she laid down with another guy.  You know what they say once a cheater always a cheater.

Poetry,fcxfakz,t1_fcwkhyb,1578061419.0,"I was just learning how to read, I remember her helping me read some simpler poetry at first and she would explain to me their meanings, but she would also read me short stories by Oscar Wilde for bed time and named me after the Iliad (so she wanted me to eventually work my way up to reading that at a young age I think) I love my mom for her introducing me to such great literature from early on because by the time I got to high school books that seemed like a chore to read to my friends was fascinating to me. You should definitely introduce poetry to your children I dont think it matters how old they are as long as its not like dark I think they will enjoy it, at the end of the day even nursery rhymes and songs are form of poetry if you think about it."
