AskReddit,ff9khoq,t1_ff9jsvq,1579714919.0,"Ah I see what you're saying. I can understand this pressure, it must be annoying.  As just one outgoing person of many I love introverts! When I get to sit down and have a one on one conversation with someone who I don't talk to much it's really fun. Getting to know them all at once in a big conversation like that isn't as possible in a group setting with lots of talkative people!  I like both. :) I married the biggest introvert I know!"
AskReddit,ff9inm5,t1_ff8mvz9,1579713826.0,"As someone who is quite confident and a people person, I wouldn't at all say it's a competition or trying to ""prove"" anything. I just want the people around me to feel free to relax and have fun, and being more myself and unafraid of how people see *me* can help to make people around me feel a little less worried about looking silly in comparison. Being outgoing is literally just my personality, I'm not trying to be anything. Being reserved would feel ""wrong"" to my personality like doing karaoke would feel ""wrong"" to yours, if that makes sense?"
AskReddit,ff9hp2y,t1_ff8qpom,1579713247.0,I thought I was the only one! Like caring about how the conversation flows and thinking about how to best respond somehow makes me manipulative or something. But now I'm realizing it's just actively trying to have decent social skills and that's a good thing!

sanfrancisco,fesu2jq,t1_feq7wie,1579368979.0,"I'm here now but from England, and I remember when I was little we had a neighbor who was a bit off her rocker. She stole all the rhubarb my mum planted in the backyard (which we would pick together and made rhubarb crumble with). 

Then one day we came home and the same woman had broken into our house and stolen the new cabinet doors that we just got installed. Fun times."

holdmyjuicebox,fek851w,t1_fejxluo,1579194601.0,I tried shaving my legs (when I definitely didn't need to) dry the first time and took a nice big chunk of my shin off with it. Still just barely have the scar at 26. 😂 I also sneezed once when curling my eyelashes and had to go to school missing my eyelashes on one eye. It actually didn't hurt that bad but embarrassment was the real pain.

aww,fee4qvd,t1_fee4cc3,1579026365.0,"I'm not talking about molding people, I'm talking about growing with your child as a parent. Learning the basics first like how to feed and clothe and soothe, then moving on to teaching etc. etc. Different people have different capabilities and some have to grow into learning these skills. I personally am the oldest of 4 so these things come naturally to me, but I have many friends without younger siblings or babysitting experience who were glad they could learn slowly."
aww,fee3zg0,t1_fee00eq,1579025916.0,"I can understand it. Those are two very different things to tackle. I think one of the reasons people want a baby rather than an older child is because they get to grow and learn as parents along with them. It might not be ""right"" but I'm sure you could understand how taking in a kid who is already walking, taking,  etc. might be a bit daunting for new parents. 

On the other hand, for some parents I'm sure getting to explore their childs' already existent personality and getting to know them as more fully fledged people so early on is amazing! People have different challenges they're willing to take on and I don't think we can judge anyone who knows their own capabilities and wants to be able to do the best for their child."

I know sometimes it's impossible to get a foot on the door, but I wouldn't start a new job by lying. I'd rather be honest and say  ""I have some familiarity with blah blah blah program but would love to learn even more and am a quick learner"".

StrongCurves,fddyoi1,t1_fdbz9jc,1578327178.0,"Me too! I always drop back down around 95 lbs (5 ft 2). My family has always been very small as well, and my 23 and me report said I'm predisposed to weigh less so I'm guessing it's just my body's natural eight for the most part. This is dark but I sometimes worry about getting badly sick because my body seems like it can't afford to lose more weight. 😬"
StrongCurves,fddydxc,t3_ei7svy,1578326979.0,"Me too! I just recently moved so I haven't unpacked my scale yet but my anxiety problems (lots of panic attacks which means throwing up and lack of appetite), and lack of movement had me down to 95 lbs (at 5ft 2) a month ago. But since I've lived in SF for over a month now I've really noticed more muscle and I've been eating much muuuch more. (And no panic attacks for 3 weeks!!!!) I have a feeling I'm 105-ish but I can't wait (weight) to check. We're in this together, you are totally capable of this I know it!"

AskPhotography,fcuuq6v,t3_ei7m3a,1577988914.0,"Sorry but I don't think these are salvageable. It seems like your photographer didn't even try to expose correctly or look down to check their images at all. 😬 It can happen if you're nervous, at most I've had 10-20 overexposed images as a nervous beginner in the past, but a whole set! Eek! I'm sure that's so disappointing especially when you went to all the effort to dress nice, get the family together, etc."
AskPhotography,fcurego,t1_fcsi2fm,1577986961.0,"I always, always, always have some kind of contract. I don't do tfp much anymore but when I did I had a contract which stated if the model didn't show up or cancelled the day of the shoot they owed me $100 for my time and materials. Otherwise the shoot was free of course. 

Before I made that contract people would cancel on me all the time, and because I do fashion that would often mean lots of time and even money spent buying things or sourcing a team for the shoot just going down the drain. Ever since I made that contract I never had anyone cancel. 

Honestly I wouldn't ask for the money anyway unless I did spend a lot myself, but I've found the threat of having to pay is good enough. 

You should also include things like a no edit clause, TAT and number of pics you'll send, etc.


Edit: would like to add, as others have said, it's less about the model and more about what you do with it (although some models are downright terrible). I personally take a ton of self portraits just at home, and have even gotten to do entire campaigns of myself which is crazy. [Here's my Instagram which is almost 100% self portraits, tried to use imgur but it marked them as NSFW even though they weren't. 🙄 As you can see I even do self portrait videos sometimes! ](https://www.instagram.com/falterphoto/)"
AskPhotography,fcuq61d,t1_fcuh0ym,1577986267.0,"When doing fashion I always try to make sure all the skin looks glowy. Olive oil spray is the best, however it's best for swimsuit because it's bad for garments. The MUA on set should carry some glowy body makeup or you could get some yourself but I'd really make sure it won't ruin the clothes if you have a designer you're borrowing from."

One day I collapsed and broke down crying in the grocery store after an 8am to 3am shift because I literally couldn't move my legs anymore without searing pain running up them. My husband had to carry me back to the car and my ankles were swollen for days, during which I still had to work. And I'm a healthy, slim woman who was 19 at the time.

The theater was the only time all day that we'd get to sit down in the back room because no could could see you. It was a chance to relax our feet and play on our phones a bit,  the part of the day everyone looked forward to.  

We got a new manager and he tried to get us to stand back there. In the dark. With a machine and no human life around. He took the stool away repeatedly, and within a day someone would always find it and put it back. Eventually one of my coworkers yelled at him about the fact that he has an office where he sits for half the day and we get maaaaybe1/4 of the time to sit in shifts at the theater and we're gonna get it. The stool stayed."
