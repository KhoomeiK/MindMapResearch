Feminism,ffcbxa0,t1_ffca62o,1579796126.0,"Yes, it is considered an insult to them. People have said to me, “oh you must be a feminist” as a way to disregard my opinion as just “some crazy lady being ridiculous and annoying.” That line of thinking definitely hasn’t gone by the wayside. 

Instead of looking at feminism as common sense, people look at it as absurdity. They’re ignorant and feel there is no point to it. They wrongly believe that women are equal and shouldn’t be complaining or protesting."

TheVampireDiaries,ffbqvx1,t1_ffbne4n,1579779122.0,"I wasn’t saying she was one-dimensional, you said due to her being a side character that explained why she wasn’t as complex as Elena or Stefan or Damon. I was simply stating that just because a character isn’t a lead, doesn’t mean they should be one-dimensional. Caroline had a lot of depth and complexity and she was also a side character, like Bonnie. 

When did Bonnie do anything for herself? She made it clear to say, Damon or Klaus, that she would help them if it meant her friends wouldn’t die. That’s still putting her life on the line for others don’t you see? She sacrificed herself for Jeremy so Elena wouldn’t lose her brother and then told him to lie about her death so Elena and Caroline could be happy in college, as if she didn’t deserve to go to college and have a future like them. 

Yes, she’s a loyal and caring friend but Bonnie became pretty strong after awhile, she didn’t always have to do what they said. She does have a big heart but always putting your friends and family before yourself at some point is not about having a big heart, it’s sad. To me that shows, she didn’t even deem herself as important as them. 

Being a sacrificial lamb, doesn’t mean you have a big heart, it just means your character is disposable and less important in the eyes of the writers

And that’s that on that"
TheVampireDiaries,ffbn2zb,t1_ffbkzfk,1579773609.0,"No she didn’t actually. She always ended up making the decision to sacrifice herself for everyone else regardless. And what do you mean she was never a protagonist? Caroline was a side character as well and had more depth than Bonnie ever did. Being a side character doesn’t mean you you should be one dimensional. That doesn’t even make sense for a show. 

“She is valuable to the plot” yeah she’s valuable in the sense that all the characters will always be safe because she will always give herself up for them. She’s valuable because she’s a sacrificial lamb and that’s all the writers wanted her to be"

I don’t see how her changing her mind about her future career is the writers “doing her dirty.” 

But other than that, I agree? Elena became less of a person her when they put her with Damon. It’s also funny how both Damon and Bonnie “died” and yet it was Damon that devastated her the most, not her best friend of like 12 years."

She has a video called “Dear Stephanie Meyer” where she talks about how bad movies like Twilight, movies targeted towards girls, get a vicious amount of hate but dumb movies like Transfromers or Fast and The Furious, which are also fantasy fulfillment films, targeted towards boys are brushed off as good fun. 

She talks about how we just hate teenage girls and everything that they like. I even hate the way teenage girls are portrayed and even little girls. 

Gravity Falls is a great example. A great show but Mable is portrayed as the stereotypical annoying little sister. Her interests in girly things like Boy Bands are treated as stupid and shameful and ridiculous. 

Even this whole Visco girl thing. Anything girls like and engage with is going to get made fun of and receive shame."
