If it’s making fun of mothers then it isn’t gatekeeping and doesn’t belong here. If it’s making fun of child free women, then it’s saying that you can’t be tired unless you’re a mother - which is gatekeeping - in which case it does belong here. 

But if you’d like to tell me how I’m wrong other than Onion = Satire = Not Gatekeeping I’d love to hear it."
gatekeeping,fff6q9y,t3_et8rtb,1579877117.0,"This IS satire but I think this is still gatekeeping because the butt of the joke in the article is clearly the child free woman. The “friend and mum-of-two” in the 2nd to last paragraph comes across in this as very level headed and cautious. Meanwhile, the child free woman is a whiney caricature who can’t even operate a microwave.

But I could be wrong. The whole article could be written on a meta level that I’m not getting. I don’t think so though.

>A WOMAN with no child-rearing responsibilities believes she is physically exhausted, it has emerged.

>Emma Bradford, 32, gets an average of seven hours sleep every night, not a minute of which is interrupted by a bawling child, but still claims to be shattered in the morning.

> Bradford said: “About a fortnight ago I only grabbed five hours of sleep after a big night out with the girls. I think I can safely say I know exactly how mums must feel.

>“To be honest I think I’m still catching up on the sleep I lost. And now I come to think about it, I’m always tired.

>“If I’ve had a busy day at work I might only feel up to a few drinks with friends that evening or a meal and a trip to the cinema. If only I could shake off this terrible exhaustion.”

>Friend and mum-of-two Donna Sheridan said: “I’d like to get Emma to babysit my kids for a month then ask how she’s feeling, but she still tries to cook unopened tins of food in the microwave so they probably wouldn’t survive a week.

>“Mind you, letting Emma starve them or blow them up would give me the chance to finally get some shuteye so it’s tempting.”"

I also want to clarify that I wasn’t talking about “hobbies” specifically like the kinds of things I just listed. Your passion could be as simple as just who you are as a person. My girlfriend really thought she wanted to go into graphic design but found out very quickly she didn’t like having to be creative on a deadline. Once she figured that out she realized that the thing she’s actually both good at and enjoys doing is just organization. She’s great at it so she found a job as a project manager and she loves it."
