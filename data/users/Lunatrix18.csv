CrossStitch,ff1nsx8,t1_ff0k67m,1579482264.0,Thank you!
CrossStitch,fezsiq7,t1_fezg1hk,1579461089.0,Thank you! There are a couple knots that are in there from when the floss got tangled but I figured my first project would have flaws. I felt like I was to tight because of the Aida showing through with the black but maybe I should have just used 3 instead of 2.
oklahoma,feydj4e,t1_feyd7vn,1579444146.0,"Also! Mustang is another great school system. I have also heard Tuttle south of Mustang is a smaller growing town. Only bad thing about Edmond, Norman, and Moore is they are on the bigger side and have more traffic and such but not nearly as bad as the DFW area I am assuming."
oklahoma,feyd7vn,t3_eqw7he,1579444026.0,"If you want proximity to OKC there are a lot of suburbs with excellent schools. I live in Yukon on the west side of OKC. One of the best school systems is Edmond which is on the north side. Houses seem to be priced higher in Edmond but I do love that side of town with the cross timbers. Norman and Moore are a couple other good school systems on the south side. As for outdoors there is lots of trails, hunting, and fishing you can get to on a day trip around OKC and Tulsa. My family and I love the Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge outside of Lawton (but we do not like the actual city of Lawton) there is a really fast growing town by there called Elgin though. Oklahoma is beautiful and has a lot to offer an outdoor family! Hope I helped."

Has an awesome map of the routes and where brick town and automobile alley are!! I don’t think it’s free anymore sorry."
okc,fefciif,t1_fefbywk,1579053341.0,Brick town is right next to downtown. It’s just an area with old brick buildings that have been restored. There are some places now in automobile alley as well which is on the other side of downtown. We have a streetcar (train on tracks in the streets) that goes around downtown so should be easy to hop on and off. I believe it’s free in January but I am not 100% sure.
