fatlogic,fez5o56,t1_fez16gr,1579454020.0,"I suppose it matters how much of an impact a factor has before you consider it to be important.  In this study they found walking used ~30% fewer calories than running-


https://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/fulltext/2004/12000/Energy_Expenditure_of_Walking_and_Running_.20.aspx

This is one of the higher estimates I’ve seen for the difference, but still, my point is that it’s significant.

Keep in mind the running involves a rather significant vertical component, where each stride is lifting one’s entire body off the ground and having to fight against 9.8m/s^2.  That takes a fair bit of energy.  In another post I linked a chart that showed energy expenditure for running actually tended to decrease with increased speed, presumably because faster runners are able to cover more distance with each stride so the vertical component is less of a factor."
fatlogic,feyyj05,t1_feymi6x,1579452027.0,"Yeah I remember a cutoff around there (in the 12-13 min/mi area) for when running becomes more efficient.  I should look up that stuff.  

There are also issues of running (or walking) economy- if you have built up your musculature in the right way you can beat the equations a bit and burn fewer calories over the same distance.  I THINK you can actually get that measured in a lab.

EDIT: Handy chart showing the transition where walking becomes less energy efficient than running-


https://fellrnr.com/mediawiki/images/7/7b/Energy_cost_and_transition_Distance.jpg

Another similar chart- note how energy cost per mile actually goes down slightly with increased running speed.

fatlogic,feymmtg,t1_feyjdvn,1579447642.0,"For cars it’s a bit different because you’re going fast enough for aerodynamic effects to really have a major impact.  For most people running slow and running fast burn about the same number of calories per mile.  At least, assuming you don’t factor in your BMR.

As I mentioned in another comment, walking is more efficient than running, but if memory serves that’s mostly because there is a significant vertical oscillation component to running that isn’t really part of walking.  

Now that I am talking about this I really should look up the equations.  I remember the main factors are just distance and weight, but there’s also some way to include elevation gain in there."
fatlogic,feylomy,t1_feygji6,1579447269.0,This is incorrect information.  Walking is more energy efficient than running.  There are entire marathon racing strategies based around this fact.  If you want I can look up the equations for you.

https://www.angusparkerphoto.com/blog/2017/2/how-to-put-a-barrel-lens-in-a-shutter

As for holding the film, I got a bunch of film holders on eBay when I bought my view camera.  Varying quality of construction but they all work.  I don't know if this camera is so old that it used a different method for holding the film, but they've been standardized for a pretty long time."

I have an app on my phone that does a decent job at metering, and can go down to ISO 0.8.  Does apertures up to f/512 also, so it should be usable for pinhole stuff, although I haven't tried.  For $5 it seems better than a DSLR, and in the scheme of large format photography $5 is nothing."

I could critique your post by saying you seem to be putting words onto TFVooDoo's mouth- he (or she) didn't actually present this argument:

All TFVooDoo did was take issue with MavenACTG's statement about ""lowered tax revenue.""  And since he linked sources, others have been able to point out potential biases with those sources.  That's good, right?

I'll grant the bit of sarcasm at the end was a bit overboard for my taste, though. Not bad enough for -50 comment karma but still. :)

And also, there's still a shutter involved in the gopro, so every frame is going to be capturing image data for some amount of time rather than it being instantaneous.  The slowest that could possibly by is 1/30th of a second per frame, which would mean that you'd just see a total blur when the camera was spinning at 1800RPM.  Every exposure would be an entire revolution.  BUT, if you had a faster shutter speed for each frame, say 1/120th of a second, then the camera would only be capturing data for about 1/4th of a revolution.  If it was a 1/1200th of a second exposure then you'd only see 1/40th of a revolution with each frame.

I am guessing the shutter speed was probably close to that 1/1200th number, but there were some weird effects from the rolling shutter and from the lathe being not-exactly a perfect multiple of the frame rate."
