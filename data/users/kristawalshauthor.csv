ottawa,fedggu4,t1_fedcbe3,1579010872.0,Sounds perfect! I look forward to it ^.^
ottawa,fedat3t,t1_fechlic,1579005999.0,"A fantastic mentality! No one can write in a vacuum if they want to improve, and as much as it can seriously suck getting honest feedback sometimes, it's 120% worth it.

My personal system involves an alpha reader (an author friend of mine in my case; we've been sharing each other's projects for years), then my editor, then a collection of beta readers before the end. The system is always evolving, growing as I do, and I like to watch it change.

I'm juggling a few deadlines at the moment, so wouldn't have too much time to offer for anything in depth, I'm afraid, but if you feel you have it to a point where you can't take it any further, I'd be happy to take a look at the first couple of chapters and do a 3&3 (3 strengths I see and 3 areas that might need work).

If you think you would find that helpful, please let me know!"

So far, I haven't actually. To be honest, I haven't been good about staying up to date on what goes on in this city as far as genre fiction is concerned. I've done a few online courses (mostly on the marketing side) and do most of my learning through writers craft books (Oh have a long list of recs if ever you need a few).

The Ottawa library has workshops, I think.

Oh! And check out CanCon! It's the SFF convention that happens every year for Canadian authors. Good resources through Marie Bilodeau."
ottawa,feb3jjn,t1_feb20dl,1578955103.0,"Some great advice already here!

There's the Ottawa Independent Writers group on Facebook (it's more of a union, but I'm not part of it so I think anyone can join), there's the Canadian Author's Association that's another paid group, but might not be necessary for entry into the FB group.

As suggested, there's the NaNoOttawa group, which is a fantastic resource. 

And then there's always the one-of-one! Fellow epic/urban fantasy author here - nice to connect with you!"
bulletjournal,fcui8tt,t3_eiwmrf,1577981586.0,Ha!! Omg I love this!!
