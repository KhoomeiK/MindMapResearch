beetle,fereka0,t3_eqfgk1,1579352991.0,Well I'm not a mechanic or an expert but I've been using my family's bug for 4 years and it sounds fine to me. It sounds like a normal bug engine.
Vaping,femvegx,t1_femsu6z,1579270631.0,"Those coils and the cotton is a month old? Fuck me. My siren makes my wicking completely dark orange/black after 2 days of DinnerLady Sweet Fusion. Other juices go around a week tho. But still, a month is nowhere near for me."

Vaping,fdq65nr,t3_emmhqv,1578656575.0,"I will never use a mech mod. I can't trust myself enough with it. I can always miss something, even yesterday when I was building, I didn't realize the coil was touching the deck. I was like ""wtf this is supposed to be 0.80 ohms, not 0.11"". Then I opened it back up and saw what I did wrong. Regulated all the way. Stay safe brother."
offmychest,fdjn8ll,t1_fdjlwui,1578479123.0,"Please let him know, not everyone treats or perceives him this way. And update us when you release this documentary so we can share it and help him clear his image."
offmychest,fdjjr9s,t3_elpxn8,1578474071.0,"Please either include all of this in your documentary or make a new one completely about him. Telling his story, what he went through would be a great documentary (if this isn't what you are already making of course)"

JohnMayer,fd3tkqo,t3_ejvm12,1578161522.0,Releasing its you that I miss.
offmychest,fcxpsms,t3_ejhk8p,1578068602.0,"Well, as long as it is mutual and you two don't have kids, it is okay in my opinion. Is it normal? Certainly not, but there are much much worse relationships out there. You guys do no harm to anyone, you just love eachother."
Tay_5,fcdkytt,t3_eh3g0z,1577611002.0,Same here
offmychest,fc2o9eb,t3_eftza0,1577368935.0,"What a bullshit. I had a girl who did exactly this to me. First of all, no, he'll never see what you did ""for him"" because there is nothing there. If you really love someone, you open up yourself. You share your problems, you try to solve them together, help eachother you know? He seems to be a really undestanding nice guy, so why did you break up instead of trying to fix yourself? You want to  do something **for him? Then change.** Taking the easy way out and breaking up is something everyone can do. But changing, fixing themselves for the person they love? Now that is rare and special. I don't even think he was complaining about anything you did. You created this whole scenario in your head, and went with it. If you care and love him, go back to him and fix yourself. If you don't, well good luck with acting like a fallen angel just to fool yourself."
offmychest,fc2nfke,t3_efssvi,1577368096.0,"Tell her to give it a shot. Tell that if you guys try it and it doesn't work out you'll be perfectly fine and continue like it never happened before, you'll know for a fact it didn't work and you guys tried. But right now it is eating you away and you can't control that feeling, thinking about ""what ifs""."
