Hopefully they’re a decent person and you could potentially ask them to pass on the correct number."

AskReddit,ffdc8pc,t3_et0bvf,1579817802.0,"Sometimes I like to speak to the manager if I think a member of staff has given me really great service. I always try to pass on my gratitude if someone has gone out of their way to help or has just been a genuinely nice person and made me smile. I never stick around to see the outcome, but I’d like to think that I can make someone’s day a bit brighter by showing some appreciation for their service."
AskReddit,ffdbjgw,t3_esyian,1579817345.0,"Finally move into my own place. I’m staying with some friends following a bad breakup, but I still have to pay rent on the flat that I shared with my ex until the end of March. I’m just trying to save up to get a deposit sorted so I can settle down and start to get myself back on track. I’m getting there and luckily my friends are happy for me to stay with them for as long as I need, but I just can’t wait until I have a proper place to call my own again."
AskReddit,ffd7fwp,t3_esyj09,1579814889.0,"Kind of shit. Got told that my contract at work is ending on March 31st. I don’t really care because I’ve been looking for other roles anyway and my manager is really supportive of helping me find something new, but March 31st is also the day I’m moving out of the flat that me and my ex boyfriend still share. It’s going to be a rough time as it’s been a messy breakup. I also got officially diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety yesterday after months of struggling, but at least I’m being pointed in the direction of help and support. Roll on April 1st."

Meditation,fdap5zd,t3_ekgfjz,1578248579.0,"This happened to me (25 f) last month. Due to feeling depressed for a good few months, I suggested opening up my relationship of 4 years so that I wouldn’t feel as bad about not wanting sex with my boyfriend (24). He slept with people in our bed and didn’t use protection even though I had asked him to. After a couple of weeks of it, he broke up with me. He’s now “seeing” one of the people he slept with and is justifying it by calling it self care and not letting himself feel sad about the breakup. I understand how you feel, and you’re not alone in this. Here for you buddy, we’ll get there."

offmychest,fcxmwez,t1_fcxl3x8,1578066750.0,"Yeah, it was a real mistake to suggest. He could be quite persistent in asking for sex and I couldn’t always deal with it as I was really struggling with my mental health. I guess at least I know what he’s like now and won’t have to waste too much more time on him."
offmychest,fcx7s9a,t3_ejabak,1578054661.0,"You definitely deserve better than this. Stick to your guns OP - your current situation is making you unhappy and you need to put your happiness first and do what you need to do to fix that. Do not forget that maintaining their happiness at the expense of your own is not healthy (and also not your responsibility). Having been in a similar relationship recently where I felt like I’d become more of a mother to my boyfriend (paying rent and bills, cooking and making sure that our flat was clean when he didn’t have a job/wasn’t looking for one) I can completely understand your frustration. You are making a positive step, best of luck and wishing you a happier 2020."

KindVoice,fconjjo,t3_ei6kp0,1577836693.0,"Very similar situation here for me (25f) - boyfriend of four years broke up with me at the beginning of December and he has been seeing people both before and straight after we broke up. There’s one he’s been seeing much more than the others and I’m pretty certain he’s with her tonight. We still rent a flat together and whenever I go back there, I find her underwear and other possessions. It hurts so much, and I completely understand your pain because I’m feeling it too. You are not alone, we’re all with you tonight. It’s going to be shit for a bit, but we’ll get there. Remember that you’re allowed to take the time to feel things and get over it at your own pace. Wishing you the best new year, hoping that 2020 brings you a happier and more peaceful time. Look after yourself, feel free to message me if you need."
