TerminallyStupid,ff4l72m,t1_ff4aite,1579566298.0,"I mean I agree with you in some sense, but I think its different from person to person. I'm deathly afraid of sharks, I will not go in the water at the beach (live near cape cod MA) so I'm gonna try and go swimming with sharks one day when I can, more so to say ""fuck you, sharks."" Because I'm a stubborn woman and refuse to go out of this world with something that controls my ability to enjoy my time at the beach.

IdiotsInCars,ff3bqm0,t1_ff1u9ix,1579538041.0,"I mean to be fair, if you were on the bike and some guy is swinging his camera around and very clearly recording to you while driving a little bit more obscurely than usual, you may not really be expecting a sudden stop as the outcome. The guy was waving the camera in and out of the car and the bicyclist was staring at the camera in confusion."

MentalHealthSupport,fekap7o,t3_epg0le,1579196111.0,"All the time. The worst intrusive thoughts are when I'm driving on the highway and a big tractor trailer is driving next to me. Always hear ""I could just cut this wheel sharp and be done.""

I also found her vibrator. She told me it was a finger massager.
 

Gotta love moms. 

May they rest in peace."
