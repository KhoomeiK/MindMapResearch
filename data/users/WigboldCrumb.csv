## Glendale

Aldi bought a building on the southwest corner of 59th Avenue and Bell Road in Glendale, city spokesman Jay Crandall said.

Aldi officials are revising their plans and will resubmit them, though it's not clear when, he said.

## Phoenix

Aldi hasn't pulled  any building permits for a planned location on 59th Avenue and Baseline  Road. The Phoenix Planning and Development Department preliminarily  approved the site in September 2018, city spokeswoman Angie Holdsworth  said. That approval lasts for two years, she said.

The  chain has submitted plans for its other planned Phoenix location, at  14th Street and Bell Road. Planning and Development officials denied  that plan, though, so the company will have to resubmit its plans."

In October 2013 the NFL announced that, in the absence of a team volunteering to participate in *Hard Knocks*,  the league could force a team to participate. Teams are exempt from  being forced to participate in three circumstances: (1) they have  appeared in the past ten years, (2) they have a first-year head coach,  or (3) they reached the playoffs in *either* of the two preceding seasons.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Knocks_(TV_series)#cite_note-8)"
