dndnext,ffaox8u,t1_ff97vmu,1579741060.0,Especially since they played the game for like a year before they ataryed streaming. Weren’t they at like lvl 7-9 when they started streaming in Kraghammer?
dndnext,ff8siiq,t1_ff8qq6p,1579694388.0,Why do you think it’s scripted?
nottheonion,ff3hlsm,t1_ff35f8s,1579541208.0,I’m glad you said this. I agree most of his beliefs are bullshit but he hit the nail on the head with the employment aspect. They make a shit ton of money but have less employees.
insanepeoplefacebook,fe60gqf,t1_fe5m9j7,1578879027.0,I don’t know about all that but I know G.I. Joe was looking really good growing up.
todayilearned,fe2wfjj,t1_fe26aet,1578843621.0,It depends on the state but it generally has to be agreed upon by both parties.
todayilearned,fe2pepe,t1_fdysap2,1578841447.0,"I heard a rumor about that. Is that true? Because if so that is super shitty. I really like TI because he does a whole lot of good for his community. Virginity tests are awful and not even accurate. Damn... that fucking sucks, TI!"
insanepeoplefacebook,fe0hvza,t1_fe0bhqv,1578813686.0,The fact you left him means you’re doing better. Good job and keep it up! I’m proud of you!
todayilearned,fdynrph,t1_fdykw5z,1578781787.0,"He never killed anyone. He was driving the car and his bodyguard killed someone. They don’t even deny that happened. What is in question is whether it was self-defense as they claimed. The other guy was a rival gang member and they got into a verbal altercation. Both parties had guns and there was an argument that it was in self-defense. Throw in police negligence on the part of the LAPD and you have a case for throwing out the charges which is what happened. If you’re going to try to make him seem like a bad person, at least get the facts straight."
todayilearned,fdylw6c,t1_fdykkst,1578781236.0,My brother played in his football league when he was a kid. Snoop really does like to give back to the community. I would say he’s up there with TI but he does a lot of stuff. He just doesn’t advertise it which makes me appreciate him even more.
dndnext,fdub7yv,t1_fdt0lkt,1578730745.0,Was he back in time for the harvest?
dndnext,fduazrw,t1_fds22tj,1578730641.0,"I’d imagine what the threat is, too. Goblins and wolves? Send anyone who wants the job. Orcs, giants, monsters? Probably get the more experienced ones. Demons, devils, necromancers, evil gods, etc...? Get the PC’s. Kobolds? Close shop and move to another continent. You’re fucked!"
thanksihateit,fdu3wqq,t1_fdpbsjv,1578727096.0,Get something called a dancer belt. It’s similar to a jockstrap but instead of protection it keeps your dick from sticking out through your spandex.
HistoryPorn,fdtzdul,t1_fdtvt6c,1578724763.0,Mrs. Doubtfire was actually a bio-pic about his childhood.

insanepeoplefacebook,fdqefw5,t1_fdpumh0,1578664527.0,There are 28 categories in the Oscars and only 2 are women specific. Everything else is even harder to win because you’re going against more people in the non-gender specific awards. You just reinforced my statement.
insanepeoplefacebook,fdqdvln,t1_fdpxvo6,1578664086.0,Not all women are trying to get pregnant. That is an irrelevant part of the conversation. I said statistically it’s harder to win an Oscar than to get pregnant.
insanepeoplefacebook,fdppzs1,t1_fdpo5lc,1578636153.0,"Statistically, it’s harder to win an Oscar. 7 billion+ people on the planet and only one best actress winner at the oscars every year. Not too mention only a fraction of a percent can even qualify for being nominated for an Oscar. Most women can get pregnant. Most women can not win an Oscar."
todayilearned,fdm4db0,t1_fdm09kh,1578539504.0,"I thought the London Underground was amazing. It was easily navigable and got me wherever I wanted to go, or at the very least a short taxi/bus/walk away. When I was younger I thought the Los Angeles metro trains were nice in the early 2000’s. I was so pissed whenever I went to London and rose the train. Fuck that Judge!"
dndnext,fdknj65,t1_fdk4kdp,1578507264.0,"I’ll say this, was it unnecessary? Probably! But it was used as a way to show how wrong goblins are. It drives a point that they are truly despicable being, not only because the killings, but they do other acts that we all see as despicable and unforgivable. It makes you hate them even more. It wasn’t edgy for edge sake. I’m not saying it was the best way to get the point across but it is a plot device not just some senseless, irrelevant scene.

Edit: I will say if a dm dropped that on a party I would get up and walk away. In a game you can tell players it happens without showing and being descriptive."
nottheonion,fdk5jpv,t1_fdk4acx,1578496555.0,and they didn’t do it? I think it’s safe to say they disappointed him for the last time.
ancestors,fdeykju,t1_fdef40h,1578349344.0,"Make sure to have a baby or two with you. You need them to get points for doing stuff because you’re essentially “teaching” them. Also, if you have 2 babies you’ll get twice the points but it’s also double the risk if something bad happens."
Showerthoughts,fdey9os,t1_fdetnj7,1578349157.0,I was at work and had some people from the UK stop in. This is exactly what they asked if I thought was happening and I was a little taken back. It worries me that he has such a history of smokescreening that foreigners immediately thought of that too.
ancestors,fdexbo2,t1_fdew8uc,1578348571.0,"It is not an easy game. There is a learning curve and, to be quite honest, it’s not for everyone. That’s not to see it’s not a good game. It just does not seem to be your kind of game which is fine."

HistoryPorn,fcyfeg3,t1_fcy5srm,1578079252.0,"There was absolutely nothing “honorable” about Vietnam. Were there honorable men? Absolutely! I would even dare say there were probably honorable men on both sides. But the war itself was a dishonest and dishonorable war. The fighting, treatment of pow’s, killing of civilians... it was a disgusting fucking war. Those jungles held no glory. The worst part was it happened because of French and US interference in the region and could have been avoided. You’d have thought we’d have learned our lesson but 50+ years later, here we are still putting our dicks in places it doesn’t belong."
insanepeoplefacebook,fcxft3x,t1_fcx08zn,1578061809.0,"She’s obviously not smart. That being said, according to the transcripts and what led up to the event, he showed her a hardcover book with a bullet in it. He said he’d been testing books that worked and that it did. So it was a combination of manipulation and naïveté."
insanepeoplefacebook,fcubryn,t1_fctsa1v,1577977284.0,It’s sad too because her son was diagnosed with autism and she put him through so many different treatments to “cure” him. When you look at the list so things it makes me wonder how she still has a kid? Rubbing spoons on his body... that was a medical “procedure” she did. Fucking bonkers!

todayilearned,fckba64,t1_fckavns,1577721425.0,Dark humor is a normal coping mechanism humans have developed as a way to deal with our own mortality. So it’s actually a normal thing to do.
Showerthoughts,fc1d2ol,t1_fc1az1x,1577315142.0,That was actually the inside of a creature. When they are flying out you can see them flying out of the jaws before they close.
