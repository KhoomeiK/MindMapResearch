We were all walking up the road to the fair and that fucking friend goes running past us doing the Naruto run, my mom just watches him go by and then turns to me and says “is [grandson’s] friend retarded?” 

She’s never even heard of Naruto or seen the run or anything. My son bust a gut laughing and I informed mom that we don’t call people that anymore. What a time to be alive"

offmychest,fenyj9c,t1_fenkyag,1579292627.0,"For me it really depended on where I was applying and the type of job because it’s not like I stopped applying for the regular jobs like dishwasher, fast food etc. I did take into account the jobs I had done before and if I knew I’d be miserable at a place I just didn’t apply. 

My government job, I seen the posting and then I had to create an account and post my resume and cover letter and there was a questionnaire. So I spent a few hours changing it up to fit the type of job they were posting. I pay attention to things like “our company prides itself on our customer service skills” so then I’ll write something to that effect on my cover letter. 

So I typically prep the night before and then save all my stuff without sending and the next day I’ll look at it again. I do have a friend that I would send my stuff to and ask them to look it over as well for anything that stands out but I was doing a lot of apps so I didn’t for all of them. If everything looked good then I sent it out the next day. For my government one, I sent it out in the evening after dinner just because I worked fulltime for this one. If I’m not working then it goes out first thing in the morning. 

The world is really changing in the sense of online/offline applications. It’s not really a “hit the pavement” type of world anymore, A LOT of companies want it sent over a program or e-mailed etc. It’s not so black and white so if I’m managing multiple applications I write them down on separate papers and make my notes on what I’m doing with that application, what’re my thoughts, etc. I’ll check out their website and write notes (what I was saying before about what the company states they pride themselves on etc) look at the company mission statement, that is a big one for information. 

So even though you’re aiming to put out multiple applications in a day, it may not necessarily be ones that you were looking at that morning, it could be ones that you’ve been working on for however long and you’re finally ready to submit. 

Also, if it was just a basic job, I would spend minimal time tailoring my resume the night before then get some printed off, I can’t tell you how many times I went to hand one in and I had gotten a stain on it so I started carrying multiples. I also tried to carry my references if they asked while I was handing in my resume. For the most part, I found most places asked for them when I was there interviewing and not before (unless they specifically asked.) 

I personally found that if I went into all these applications with the mindset of “I’m not going to get this job but I’ll apply so I don’t have disappointment for myself for not trying” so when I was rejected, it wasn’t such a big deal. Of course a part of you will always hurt when you receive that but it’s a part of life, very little is easy, it all hurts so I think realizing that is a part of maturing and you learn to not take it so personally. It’s just a business doing a transaction and it’s very similar to you going to the supermarket and picking out an apple. You’re going to pass over the vast majority of what’s in there. 

The mindset I use is fairly negative but I found I didn’t get my hopes up so much, the emotional impact was less and when I did get a job, I was craaazzzzyy happy. 

Sorry, I’m just on my lunch break and have to head back, I can write more if you like after I’m done work. 

Career courses offered at employment centres help a lot as well!"
offmychest,fen9tbd,t1_fen74fh,1579280086.0,"😂 I hear ya, I don’t think I ever hit 20 in a day (I live in a small town) but it gives you a goal to move towards."
offmychest,fen5hoo,t3_eq0mo8,1579277412.0,"I’ve only ever been qualified for entry level jobs but a career counsellor told me to apply for any job that looks like I can do (so don’t be applying to be a NASA scientist but go for an office job, etc) even if I don’t have the qualifications they list. They said make it your goal to get 20 no’s a day because that’s what you’re aiming for and if you get 20 no’s that was a goal. Even if you get 20 no’s before lunch, then you call it a day knowing you did what you set out to do. 

So I seriously did that, I went from making 7-8/hr and I applied for office jobs, I had none of the qualifications but I could type fast (so that’s why I chose office jobs) and I got a job at a family-owned business starting out at $12/hr and was there for 8 years than I took that experience and applied for a government job and shit myself when I got that one. I applied for that job thinking there’s no way in hell I would get it, fancy jobs are for other more successful people and I was surprised when I got an e-mail asking me to carry on to the next stage of the application (there ended up being several stages.) I didn’t even bother telling people I was applying because I truly believed I wouldn’t get it. I only told a supervisor co-worker who I could trust because I ended up reaching the stage where they need to call my references. 

When they called me that I had the job she said my application was successful and I was like “....that’s great, you’re saying I got it? Sorry, I just didn’t expect to make it! Thank you!” 

I’m at a pay level right now where I’m getting $25/hr and will be going up to the next pay step in April. 

This was all done by applying for jobs I wasn’t qualified for. I’m not saying to lie on your application, be truthful but yeah, it all depends on who else is applying and you might just end up looking like the better candidate in the end."

netflix,fdtip53,t3_emdkvl,1578717324.0,I love Ryan Reynolds and I really wanted to love this movie but I dropped it about 20 mins in because there wasn’t any story or anything to keep me captivated. I came back to it about a week later and watched another 20 mins or so but I realized that it lost my attention very shortly after starting it and I was just looking at my phone surfing so I just turned it off.

I found myself rooting for her in the end though. I liked how they set up the interview of Jonathan Harker with the writing surprise they have there. I liked how she was a nun but had a more practical head on her than just some mindless person of the faith."
