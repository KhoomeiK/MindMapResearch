But the guy never got tired even when he ran non-stop as a kid. So that's probably not it.

Edit: A more probably thing is that it was indeed a technique he made only after staying with the Kamado family, and it is something meant specifically for use against Muzan.

Every Demon Hunter he trained in breathing techniques were killed, and his brother's bloodlike would be hunted as well. Entrusting everything to the Kamados, who were nobodies, would have been his only hope.

> There was a clear, bell-like voice, followed by the sound of something moving swiftly. The silver-haired girl frowned, while Aura, standing beside her, pretended to act dumb.

> Although Jircniv’s dynamic vision was not good enough to see what had happened, it looked like the dark elf had just kicked the silver-haired girl in the leg.

> “…Oi, you―”

> “―You’re making too much noise. Quiet down.”

> Like a demon king, Ainz majestically waved his left hand to motion for silence.

> Such regal movements could only have been born of long years of ruling over this domain.

> Jircniv’s alertness level went through the roof.

> *I see, he has presided over this land for a long time. To think he had such a dignified bearing…*


**In the carriage**

> “It is fine. That is a fact. The frightening thing is that he said just one sentence, and from that sentence I could feel the immense pressure of a tyrant.”

> “‘You’re making too much noise. Quiet down.’ Was that it?”

> Jircniv nodded lightly to the scribe.

> That was without doubt the attitude which Ainz Ooal Gown adopted as the king of the Great Tomb of Nazarick."

I really don't care about not being on the priority list.

Not doing so is literally a lose-lose for me and everyone else."

This isn't a flip like what happened in the past; it's just everything going more right.

I honestly don't know what the America's GOP actually is politically. In many other places, and it'd be far right.  
But it's somehow normal there."
