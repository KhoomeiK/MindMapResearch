NoStupidQuestions,ff061h8,t1_ff03wrq,1579465588.0,"I actually love talking about them. They are a threatened species, and babies have a 1% rate of survival to adulthood in the wild. The adults also don’t care for their young, when they hatch they dig their way out from underground. So, every year around late July through September (hatching season) I would search for baby tortoises. We’d have about 4-12 a year (sometimes Isadora, that was the mom, would lay two “clutches,” a group of eggs usually between 4 and 7ish). Whoever found the baby got to name it. They were so small, maybe 2 inches in diameter. We had multiple enclosures inside and my dad built bigger ones outside with netting over them to keep birds out (their shells are relatively soft until they are maybe 5-7 years old). Most we adopted out to good homes.
