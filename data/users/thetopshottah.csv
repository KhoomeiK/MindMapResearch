webdev,ffls66m,t3_eu5fbo,1580043406.0,Computer science will be more about theory and algorithms. You will have to take up to DE as well as physics 2 before even getting into computer related classes so a bunch of filler classes that won't give you practical knowledge in the field. Bootcamps capitalize on lazy people who can't create a curriculum for themselves. They allow you to work on projects to put on your resume you and the other few thousands that do it. If school has taught me anything it has taught me that I can learn on my own. If you want to work with A.I or Machine Learning computer science degree will help with getting a job in respected field however the knowledge is freely out there to learn but if you don't have the paper your looked over because you haven't put enough $$$ into the system.
