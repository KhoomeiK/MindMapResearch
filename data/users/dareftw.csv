summonerschool,ffpegjv,t1_ffoh2qk,1580093014.0,"Pickup Talon. With the current existence of so many lethality items he is in a great place in almost any matchup, and you’re hard pressed to find someone who can out roam him so he always has the ability to try and gain a lead outside of lane if you find yourself with no real way to win the 1v1 with your current matchup."
summonerschool,ffpe82j,t1_ffpbfol,1580092844.0,"This is true, but for most of the part bottom lane trading and early game is more reliant on your support being able to exert pressure and control the lane than any other single factor. Of course ADCs have pretty rough counters directly, but bot lane is similar to jungle in that your play is reliant on your teammates play and you outclassing your direct lane opponent doesn’t always decide the matchups outcome."

patientgamers,ffjqqjd,t1_ffhu4q9,1580004512.0,Yea it’s one of the good examples of why you don’t give an IP to a writer who’s a fan of it. Chris Avellone actually really disliked the Star Wars universe and as a result he wasn’t to cautious with the subject matter and made decisions that people who were fan boys of the series may have been to cautious to make.

leagueoflegends,fewn6r5,t1_fes44qa,1579415438.0,"Yep a few years ago I decided to do ranked on my smurf account I finally got all the ADCs, and got high play, diamond MMR in maybe a week or. 

It took me a month to get their on my main account, while my alt went 8-2 in promos and then proceeded to go 15-4 and rapidly out paced my rank. Even after going 8-2 in promos I think I got placed into Solver 2. Granted after playing more I quickly got to gold 1 as I think I skipped both gold 2 and 3. Didn’t hurt that I lost my gold IV promos thanks to DCs, so my MMR kept going up while my rank got stalled thanks to promo system.

worldnews,fdzfdps,t1_fdz06ka,1578789662.0,"Eh in undergrad Econ I took a decent amount of American Economic history in the South, and they likely would have been fine if they had won considering that they would have likely seized their debt from the war from the North, in a way similar to how the North largely made the South pay for it self and dismantled its economic system. The original plan for ending slavery from all parties involved was to pay for the cost of slaves, this way southern institutions would still have all of their collateral (capital in the form of slaves was the main way to secure financing from banks which collapsed leading to a following collapse of Expansion type growth and the rise of country stores and share croppers and its famous debt servitude). This didn’t happen and almost everyone involved was worse off for it.

Now the original plans were something along the lines of financially compensate all the slave owners for their slaves and then ship them back to Africa or something. And even then the total cost of doing so was cheaper than the cost of the civil war so lost of estimations and mistakes were made, but then again had Gettysburg gone a different way the South may have very well at least won their independence, but who knows.  To say they would have folded within decades is unlikely though, they would have been faced with needing to make drastic changes, but that’s likely it honestly. 

At least from a perspective on the war at some point it would be inevitable for Germany and the USSR to come to blows, their was just to many issues present there."

Not saying that you can’t get positive returns on a QA team, but in most instances with more devices and hardware to test bringing total time to properly troubleshoot everything higher than ever, a lot of companies find it now being better to just go over everything again after release and try to hit fix most things than delay the development cycle and create a log jam in production in the process.

The only place where this isn’t true is in finance apps and the like, Robinhood is a good example, let the end user QA that and it leads to loops that break SEC regulations regarding margin and leaves the company responsible for tons of debt that is cheaper to have a properly staffed QA team to manage."

Multiple decades of mismanagement and dumb moves doesn’t change that. Fans who have only ever followed esports likely won’t be able to relate. Esports orgs are all younger than they are and come and go regularly so most likely exclusive e-sports fans have likely had multiple teams come and go that they root for and it’s less for teams and more for players because a lot of the time some players easily outlast organizations.

So idk why you’re responding to me what I said still holds true which is from a purely ratings perspective this stretch is the roughest in its history doesn’t meant compared to other shows it isn’t doing well but compared to its history is still on the decline. winning an Emmy for continuous running show by basically default is about on par with South Park winning an Oscar for best musical by default because it was the only one produced that year with anywhere decent production values."
