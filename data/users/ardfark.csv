Pretty cool card. I feel polymorphs might work in reds favor moreso than Blue's. Blue can just draw a ton of cards, no max hand size, and play them and protect them.

If his escape was cheaper, either in the actual cost or the card at 2 or 3... 5 Cards isn't nothing, and Escape isn't Delve.

If the lifeloss was automatic like that UG Titan was. 

If he had some evasion. Trample, Menace, Haste? And I am not a fan of Haste.

If the Discard effect was just a smidge beefier. 2 or 3 cards? Even just 2 would be awesome. 

Basically any one of those alone would just make him leagues more useable.

Really all he has going for him is a cheap casting cost. Negated from dying without escaping. His P/T being high doesn't even matter since he's in reality a 6/6 no evasion for ""RRBB-exile 5 from the yard"" And sadly the things he'll have to contend with are of a generally higher caliber.
