AskReddit,fcnto81,t3_ei21zo,1577818202.0,"So, similar to the situations of some other posters here, I, too, have one of those ""Talk To Me"" neon signs flashing on my forehead.  Random people from all walks just unload on me.  It gets interesting when its by people I will have to interact with again.

So there I was, in college, new semester, new university, new student housing.  I was learning about my roommates, and vice versa.  One had already made friends with a girl, who he invited over to the apartment.  She brought a friend with her; let's call her Coral, because that was her name, and who the hell cares if she reads this?  

Coral, if you read this: Hi.  You're weird.  Hope you're doing well.  

So my roommate and his new galpal promptly bail, and leave me with Coral, whom I've known all of about ten minutes.  Great.  She asks where I'm from.  I'm from a tiny-ass town in Texas, far, far from the island we were on.  She says she knows it.  Really?  How?  She says she dated a guy from there.  I ask who, as it's small, there's a chance I know the guy.  Poleaxed, she tells me her ex is a guy I graduated high school with.  Damn- small world after all!  

I reckon she felt we had a connection there, because then she tells me about her first boyfriend.  Ok.  And how he took her virginity at 14.  That's... that's great.  Thanks for sharing.  And then how he like violent sex.  And she did, then she didn't.  Then she got away because he was controlling.   

All the while I'm thinking that what I thought was going to be a pleasant ten minutes meeting an attractive woman was turning into a marathon of me trying to keep my shit together.  I mean, was she coming on to me?  Did she see me as a therapist?  Why tell me these things?  I'm so lost.  

We weren't done.  Oh no.  So, I tried to steer the conversation towards support and maybe something more normal, and she decides she needs to tell me that despite her sexual desires, she's not at all weird compared to her friends.  One friend in particular, who got off on riding horses.  

I mentioned that wasn't abnormal, really.  A lot of women enjoy having control over all that coursing muscle, some in a very intense way.  No, she corrected me, her friend got off on teaching her male horse to lay down, roll over, and let her ride him sexually.  

Why?!  Why do you lay this shit on me, whom you've known for like, a half-hour at this point?  

So, after an hour of this roller-coaster of a conversation (bestiality was the furthest thing from my mind going in), my traitorous roommate and his friend show back up.  When the ladies left, he asked how I got along with Coral.  My answer was something along the lines of, ""Great.  We talked a lot, she was nice.""  He pushed more, asking me if I thought she was interested.  I said, sure, I guess.  She was pretty, I'll give her that.  I didn't have much experience with women telling me about how they liked to bump uglies upon first meeting.  For all I knew, this was her way of telling me she was available.  All aboard the weird train?  This is what comes of having no game, ever.

Fast forward to next day, when Coral and her friend return.  Coral tells me, ""We need to talk"" in serious tones.  Then she takes me out on the lanai and proceeds to jump my shit for spreading rumors we made out the previous day.  I tried to interrupt, but she wasn't having it.  Furthermore, she wouldn't make out with me because she already had a boyfriend.  I let her rant until she was done, but when she made to storm off, I stood in front of the door and told her that she needed to listen to me in return.  To her credit, she did.  My response was to relate the conversation between me and my roommate as closely as I remembered, and then to remind her that we both came from tiny towns.  As such, she should know as well as I not to trust rumors from anyone, and instead of getting pissed at them, squash the rumors.  And should she feel the need to get pissed at me for other people's asshattery, she should take it up with them.  

God, what a gloriously hot mess she was.  There was also an incident with a hooker she knew from high school.  Hanging out with her was never dull.  

*TL/DR: Met a woman, and within ten minutes found out all about her sexual history, preferences, and her friend's penchant for bestiality.*"

No, they really don't.  Many tend to eat it as soon as it is still enough to eat, not when it's dead.  That's why they go for soft bits, first.  It really all depends on the mode of predation (e.g. swift bite to the neck versus exhaustion and just ripping its guts out)

The only thing to really wait for their prey to die are constrictor snakes, because they need the prey to quit moving so they can work on the slow process of swallowing.  

Nature eats, and eats quickly because if you fuck around, something else will come along and steal your food or eat you."
