That was... fast. Wow, thank you!"

depression,fefm1f6,t3_eowov6,1579059223.0,"There are a lot of layers to your problems here, and probably a lot more than you wrote down or even know about. If you are depressed, your GP would have told you courses of action you could take. If you haven't been diagnosed - go do that. If this is more just you being unsure wtf you're doing in life, try looking into some philosophies (read some books, watch some online lectures, talk to people)."

depression,fdvityf,t3_en6iib,1578747883.0,"The tiredness is just the depression. No way to beat it other than sucking it up and just doing it anyway. Choose some small improvement, take it slow, but consistent. Let's say going for a walk once a day around the block. If you can do that for a week or so, make it two blocks, or maybe a light jog. You get the idea, it can work for anything. Doesn't matter what it is or how well you do it - only thing that matters is that it becomes a long-term routine."
depression,fdvi2zy,t3_en6jtd,1578747605.0,"I feel this. I made a pledge that this year I would do my best to be myself as much as I can. No faking it anymore. Because faking it became the norm, and it was so draining. Only thing is, no one can teach you how to be yourself..... Good luck with it!"

depression,fdvgoxa,t3_en6y4u,1578747205.0,"You sound nihilistic. I'm sorry about that. It can be hard to see the good when the bad just seems to overwhelmingly outweigh it. I will agree that from what I've read/seen from before the world wars, that life was simpler, people living for decent reasons, almost naively. But then again, there has always been war, and there always will be war. People are selfish, and will fight for what they think they deserve. That's how we got here in the first place. 

My suggestion to you is to stop looking at the big picture of humanity, and focus on your life. Not your neighbourhood, maybe not even your family. Just you. Are you a good person? Could you be better? If the world around you seems to be fallign apart, what small effort can you provide to fight against that? (Sorry if you're not looking for advice and were just venting, but maybe this will help someone)."

facepalm,fcpjcsd,t1_fcpiezq,1577865676.0,Actually evolution goes both vertically and horizontally. Vertical evolution is the usual gene makeup changing from parents to children. Horizontal evolution is genes changing over time from factors like other animals/plants/features of the environment (good example being resistance to bacteria).

depression,fcogcqz,t3_ei96by,1577831565.0,"Depressed or not, that is a really shitty thing to do. I hesitate to say they don't deserve to be better, but if they show no gratitude towards you... They're at the very least a very selfish individual. Take this as a lesson, take the time to recover, but don't let this one bad experience effect any more than it needs to. You did the right thing, for the wrong person. Please don't stop being one of the good people."

depression,fcjrr15,t3_ehkc7f,1577701352.0,"If people don't understand what depression can do to a person, why not inform them? If you start spreading lies, they'll eventually come out or become out of hand... I'd recommend telling the truth. If they don't get it, screw em"
depression,fcjrmv5,t3_ehkcg9,1577701180.0,"Medication is definitely not for everyone. Doesn't make it a crutch by any means. Some people have actual deficiencies that can be fixed through taking the right pills, and it works. Others, not so much. Good that you realised this for yourself anyway. Super great to hear you've come out the other end of your own free will. Just don't drink too much on New Years!!"
depression,fcjrec8,t3_ehjkgg,1577700833.0,"If you don't like your therapist (they don't sound crash hot), go get another one. Screw em.

About the uselessness, you've got a lot of time to find something you're good at still. It might not seem like it, but you've got way more time than you think. Just don't waste any more wallowing in yuor own sadness if you can. If you're on a low this will sound stupid, but wait out the bad times until you're feeling okay again, then go find out what it is that you can do."
depression,fcjr5bf,t3_ehjx5z,1577700466.0,"Honestly, just keep doing you. If someone comes into your life naturally and you both click, it'll work out much better than if you're actively seeking someone. Go live your life my dude"

Bad things have always happened and people will always continue to do bad things no matter the decade. I'm going to focus on being a good person above everything else. Maybe as some sort of rebellion against the idea that the world is bad, I don't know. But I've spent so long in bad thoughts, 2020 is going to be the year that I rebel against them.

depression,fcjpn8d,t3_ehjy7d,1577698297.0,"You might have high-functioning depression. Talk to your GP.

Also if bad past memories still haunt you, a good therapist may be able to help you come to terms with them in ways you may not have realised. 

Or you could spend the next few years going through the motions seemingly fine until you realise that these thigns don't just go away on their own. Up to you really, but I would recommend taking some action!"
