Minecraft,ffoofu5,t3_euczzb,1580079924.0,That’s unpossible
utopiatv,ffkyfqf,t3_eu0i5r,1580031302.0,"As soon as I hear about the virus outbreak and the possible vaccines, I think of Utopia. Then I mention it to people, and they’re like, “what the hell is Utopia.”"

leafs,ffadqg3,t1_ffa78fo,1579733162.0,Calling it a “circle jerk of a subreddit” is the most honest thing anyone’s ever said on here. You’re better off talking Leafs on Twitter. At least you’ll find some people who aren’t Dubas Dick riders
funny,ff50708,t3_erfz99,1579576727.0,He gone
Missing411,ff3qtsx,t1_ff20ugl,1579546869.0,Why didn’t the 600 searchers find him or canines or cadaver dogs? Why were there no buzzards circling the body? How did they notice his bones from the drone if he was wearing clothes?
leafs,ff3o9zz,t1_feyjbnj,1579545314.0,"I think I finally get it. The Leafs destroy the hopes of the fans on the right. But ya, I saw it like you where the Leafs dominate their opponent but that doesn’t happen...probably should never use any mma fighters for a Leafs analogy...soccer players would make more sense"

leafs,fezmcq1,t1_fexg3lt,1579458960.0,He lost 3 of his last 5 fights and hadn’t won since 2016. To say that it was crazy to bet against him is a massive stretch.
leafs,fezjprn,t1_fexd7cr,1579458049.0,And Al was way more dominant against Khabib than Conor. MMA math I guess.
leafs,fexcrjb,t1_fex7ggy,1579428780.0,Cerrone just fucked up Al Iaquinta in May. Conor hadn’t won since 2016. You don’t know what you’re talking about.

copywriting,feohiry,t1_fenfr4n,1579300258.0,Like others said. If you’re getting your traffic from paid ads (FB etc.) or even TradeShow sign ups then probably not.

Ya, he was pretty old."
leafs,fe6wsyy,t1_fe6rmqk,1578906916.0,Why do you get downvoted for this? It’s crazy. I don’t even think people in this sub are actual fans. I think they’re trolling.
leafs,fe6wqyu,t1_fe6tpd8,1578906853.0,"I totally agree. You can’t use stats to measure team chemistry. You can’t use stats to tell whether a player is a prick in the room. This isn’t baseball...there are intangibles in hockey. 

I don’t have the capacity, but someone could surely compare all teams’ possession + hits to wins ratio."
leafs,fe6vu9t,t1_fe6rhkm,1578906400.0,"Tom Wilson, Nazem Kadri, Darcy Tucker ... they aren’t grunts. If JT made a hit tonight, there would have been at least one less goal"
