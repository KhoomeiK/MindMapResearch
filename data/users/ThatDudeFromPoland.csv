Other thing was bulletsponge enemies: sure, they were a problem in Doomsday heists, but in Casino heist you can do a mission that makes enemies have weaker armor and weapons, making them far less of a threat.

&#x200B;

He's right about the mission design based on travellin A->B->A and long loading times tho. Although the grind isn't that much based around it. Nowadays, with both ative and passive businesses one can still have fun grinding in online by mixing up the stuff you do. after buying supplies for the passive ones you can fill up the active ones such as cargo warehouse and I/E warehouse, do some business battles, prepare a heist alone or with help of a friend, race, play a deathmatch etc. (and I'd like to mention here that playing adversary modes, especially on double money, can cover th costs of buying supplies) Even if you're not doing anything that makes a lot of money, you can still make a lot with the passive businesses alone while you simply have fun with the vehicles you grinded for before or in adversary modes, After that all u gotta do is get 2 or 3 friends or helpful randoms to help you sell and you're making the big bucks. In sales you just deliver from A to B, but it can be varied too. Some sales are awful *\*cough post op cough\** but other missions like the phantom wedge sale for the bunker is fun.

I thought not. 
Whether we wanted it or not, It's not a story the Vanguard would tell you.
It’s a Rockets McDickface legend.
Valus Ta'aurc was a Dark Lord of the Cabal, so powerful and so wise he could command the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon. 
He had such a knowledge of the Cabal side that he could even keep the command he cared about from being taken out one by one. 

The dark side of the Cabal is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be a bullet sponge. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his grip on Freehold, which eventually, of course, he did.

Unfortunately, many Guardians used cheese spots to kill him without taking damage. 

Ironic, he could save others from being cheesed, but not himself."
