AdviceAnimals,ff8xnq3,t3_es5r6j,1579699423.0,"I wish i could send this to my old bosses but theyd know it was me because im the one who loudly quit over it. I have an immune system disorder along with some other health issues and no insurance. Going to the doctor for me isnt a simple $200 check up. They have to do all sorts of tests and it really adds up. Plus the search for a doctor who can actually treat me is hell, because the main issue i have is rare (took over a decade to get diagnosed) so lots of doctors arent sure or want to first confirm my diagnoses. 

Basically, the price of a dr note for a single day off because of something i know how to treat at home becomes completely not worth keeping the job. 

So i quit. They fought me tooth and nail over it, and tried to guilt me into thinking me needing a day off was wrong. But its like.. ive had these health issues for 15 years. I know if i go in im gonna just get worse and end up in the hospital. Im also not going to spend $8k on tests to make sure im not gonna die just so that you get a doctors note. So bye. 

They had the nerve to hit me up a week later, not asking but DEMANDING that i go back to work because it was rude of me to leave them short staffed. Like nah bitch you underpaid and never gave me a raise once for years despite me opening and closing your store for you every day, then told me if i wanted to keep my job id have to spend like 4 months pay in order to take one necessary sick day?"

But burrito was my good little girl. Whenever taquito would escape (it happened often and i never knew how. She was stealthy) burrito would smile up at me all smugly like “im still here”.

Also, when i first quit 10 years ago, i would always switch right over to drinking. So i know what you mean and relate. I often come off as condescending or sarcastic so i didnt want you to think thats what i was doing with what i said. 

Idk if youve ever heard the expression “you can switch rooms on the titanic but it’s still gonna sink,” but it applies here. Dont switch to drinking.
