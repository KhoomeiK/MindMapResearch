GetMotivated,fcogt6w,t3_ei8198,1577831881.0,"This is going to be MY year. I got out of the toxic ass restaurant industry, cut out toxic people, learned to stop helping those that won’t help themselves, learned it’s ok to say NO, learned it is time for me to help me, I set myself goals both small and large and I’m changing the person I was.... I repeat THIS IS GOING TO BE MY YEAR! Maybe this year I’ll stop faking the smiles and have some real ones! 

My New Years resolutions started 3 months ago. Going strong on them. I also want to do something to better myself. I want to learn a new language or learn to play the fiddle."
