homestead,ffepofp,t1_ffeo3pe,1579859209.0,"actually B12 is synthesized by bacteria in the ground. in the old times we used to get bacteria from vegetables thar grew onto/into soil (just like animals did by eating grass ) but now, since humans are using antibiotics in every single animal raised for 'food', not to mention every pesticide and stuff, we can't get it from the original source anymore. but so do cows, so they get supplements in their food, that's how meat eaters and vegetarians get their b12. vegans simply get the supplement pills or eat fortified foods.


about the ""food chain"" thing.. there are so many things to say. for instance the most important thing is that humans cannot be considered part of the natural food chain anymore. food chain is -small animal eaten by bigger animal, bigger animal eaten by even bigger animal- for SURVIVAL. this is the key word here. humans are not in a survival condition at least since after the Middle Ages. survival means you're struggling to find resources not to die. I don't think going to the supermarket and filling your cart of animal products (raised, processed and produced ad hoc by humans for humans) qualifies as struggling. 
Also instinct. think about a cat or a dog: their instinct is to hunt and catch prey. because they are natural predators. our instinct is the opposite: either running away if it's a scary animal or cuddling and petting it if it's cute. Other farmers said that in comments above. How difficult it is to not get attached to your cute animals bc then you have to slaughter them."

veganfitness,fd1o1nx,t1_fcz6o8z,1578134081.0,"not op, but the sore muscles definitely need at least a one day break. if you want to go everyday to the gym, splitting groups of muscles in different days is the best, so if monday is leg day, on Tuesday your legs will be sore but you can work your upper body. Hope this helps!"

gerbil,fclw2wg,t3_ehw0rb,1577757879.0,"I forgot to add that unfortunately he doesn't get much time out of the cage like free roaming around but I often pick him up and let him run on me. he doesnt like being handled and he squeaks when I try to pick him up (I believe due to his traumatic past). 
Next things I'm gonna do (tomorrow): buy a mesh wired panel to put on top of the cage, buy a couple more toys, let him out for a good half hour or more. 

Finally I wanted to buy a new tank to put under his current one filled just with bedding. what do you think?"
