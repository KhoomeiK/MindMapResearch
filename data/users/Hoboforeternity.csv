Falcom,fed1st4,t3_eog0vk,1578994416.0,"as for music, music in Ys are generally more ""compact"" that it have less tracks in a single game but most of them are more memorable. trails is slower series and it have lots of ambient soundtrack that don't really make for good listening on its own like ys. 

also what i like with ys is that there is also a very strong worldbuilding happening but if you really pay attention to it. it's not groundbreaking or anything like trails' but there is sort of consistency and bits of continuity like the war between romun and altago that is mentioned in some of the game, and we (indirectly) see the conclusion in Ys7 et cetera."
