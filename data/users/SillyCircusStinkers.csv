bipolar,fe9bro4,t1_fe9a41l,1578936133.0,"I went to an outpatient this past fall. It was all based on Marsha Linehan’s dbt skills. If you can get your hands on her book, it’s really helpful. Good luck on your journey!"
bipolar,fe9atx9,t1_fe94ku8,1578935966.0,"That’s awesome, congrats! I really hope you’re right. It’s been a tough six months. Take good care!"
bipolar,fe8w45s,t1_fe7zcr8,1578931679.0,It’s r/bipolarsos but I would recommend actual therapy. You should check it out before showing your so.
bipolar,fe8qu5r,t1_fe64yej,1578929525.0,So sorry to hear that. Hang in there!
bipolar,fe5vda7,t1_fe5dhsb,1578875790.0,"I'm here for you, I know exactly what you're going through and it sucks. We will get through it. I hope things get better for you."
bipolar,fe5qdb5,t1_fe5erpb,1578873093.0,"I feel for you and I understand what you had to go through. I cant imagine the pain my husband has had to experience and I'm suprised that he's willing to try and make things work out after what happened this past summer. My last manic episode lasted about six months. I literally threw away everything- leaving my husband to care for our daughter, run our business,  and also sell/buy our home. I went back to my home town and insisted that we get a divorce. I had no idea that I was unwell. I had no clue what bipolar really was. My husband read tons of thick books about bipolar, spoke with several therapists, and tried to get me to help. I refused for a very long time. When I got back it wasn't what I expected. He was incredibly hurt and has been questioning if he wants to be a care giver for the rest of his life. He's unsure if he wants to go though another episode. It's so hard because it's not my fault that I have this sickness but he also cares for me a whole lot. Being armed with knowledge, having a support system, and having an action plan in place is key. I also think making serious life style changes is crucial to managing symptoms.  I'm not sure what's going to happen, but for now we are together. And no matter what we will both be OK."
bipolar,fe49jkp,t1_fe47q1b,1578857051.0,"My husband and I have been together for 10 years. He’s seen me through 3 manic episodes & this past episode was the one that almost ended it all. It’s very scary...but as long as you stay on your meds and take the best care of yourself, everything will be just fine. I’m super hopeful for you both!"
bipolar,fe3vzhr,t1_fe3vpg1,1578853375.0,It’s been quite the journey.
TrueOffMyChest,fdfi18z,t3_el4361,1578362173.0,Can I interest tyou in a private investigator?
TrueOffMyChest,fdfg91n,t3_el3ylp,1578360988.0,Sounds like you could use a hug.. nothing sexual.
SandersForPresident,fdffppq,t3_el3ymq,1578360625.0,Because he isn't Joe Biden.
bipolar,fdeg095,t1_fdebiws,1578338214.0,Thanks so much for taking the time to watch. The best way for me to get this stuff out is by making videos. I think you’re right about not blaming myself. I’ve been trying to forgive but it’s just so hard right now... especially since my #1 support has had enough.
bipolar,fdefhh9,t1_fdecbdx,1578337888.0,"Thanks so much for your kind words. It means the world, especially with everything that’s going on over here. It hurts all over and the thing I’m most afraid of with the divorce part coming up is it triggering another episode. I really don’t want to lose my family but he’s been telling me all day it’s not something he wants to go through again. Love back to you."
bipolar,f9kr5m1,t3_e5ef97,1575406209.0,Helllpppp. Will sleep really curve the mania? It’s coming on fast & I’m afraid of what I’m about to get into next.
