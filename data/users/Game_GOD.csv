Wearing that shit isn't wrong but yeah 99.99% of people would call you strange for it because it isn't normal, at least not for a straight Male that is sound of mind, but to each their own. I think most women would straight up laugh at it but I suspect you don't have enough of a pool of willing test subjects to test that theory

The fact that when faced with the option to either totally get naked in front of your cousin, show people your weirdo drawers, or *just tell everyone you don't feel like getting in,* you chose the most socially awkward of the three. Maybe that confidence in yourself is poorly placed and this is a sign you should step back and reevaluate what you think is ""normal"""

I don't think you put much thought into this. The whole plot centers around his father still being alive and Roy trying to find him. Besides, it would be a suicide mission, as Roy would die of old age before getting back."

personalfinance,fe7xlso,t1_fds5320,1578920289.0,"That's fine then. That's perfect but I was making sure your E fund wasn't for 3 months or less or something. You didn't mention it so I thought I'd throw it in there because it's important that you're ready for anything. 3-6 months is nice, but the size of the E fund should be proportional to income. If you've worked 10+ years, it doesn't make sense at all to only have 3-6 months worth of savings. Say you've made $50k a year for 10 years with just 5% going to savings. That should be $25k in case you find yourself in hard times and that should support you for a bit.

I personally keep at least a year in an emergency fund, but I come from a family where myself and my family have gone through hard times after being laid off without warning."

worldpolitics,fd5cj9i,t3_ejxv81,1578176267.0,"Okay so here's the deal. Hi. Infantryman here.

A draft? Not happening. None of you volunteered for service to your country, but that's fine, because virtually none of you could handle any bit of it anyway. Physically or emotionally. We don't want people whose biggest daily problem include things like their printer not working, or their shoes not being as comfortable as they thought they would be when they bought them. Sorry for the truth bomb, but seriously, you couldn't even begin to imagine what we go through, so don't try to project your opinions as ours.

We chose to be out here so that you didn't have to be, and even though we're not at fault for any of this, we're blamed and villainized. If you knew how our jobs worked you wouldn't give us so much shit for being in the military. All of you think we choose what the outcome of a war is, when in reality, all we ever have been are placeholders. The reason you don't get drafted? Simple. Enough of the people who CAN do the job have already volunteered to do it that you don't have to be selected at random and forced to do it. Somebody has to. I'll say it again. There HAVE to be people in the military. You think North Korea, Russia, Iran, etc. wouldn't invade us or other helpless countries and cause worldwide mayhem and suffering if US didn't have the military power it has?

You don't know the half of what war is. Please don't even try to act like you have an idea."
