Baking,fe0581q,t1_fe04xk3,1578803362.0,It’s a two piece set. So you first use the cutter to get the outline of the dino. Then use the second piece to stamp the design. As long as the stamp is well floured it comes right off. I’ve never had an issue all the times I’ve made them. I use a sturdy cookie dough that’s made for cutting out shapes. And make sure it’s cold when cutting/stamping.
