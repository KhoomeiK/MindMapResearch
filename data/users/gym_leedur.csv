orthotropics,fgepwrm,t3_ey1dto,1580706051.0,"I think it's a bunch of different things happening. Maybe you are mewing wrong. Maybe you're mewing right but the results aren't flattering for you. Just do whatever makes you feel healthy and better. 

For me, mewing is doing it's thing but I do notice my jaw is getting a bit wider with me chewing more and eating more hard foods and this isn't really flattering for me as I'm a small girl with a small face. I also noticed my tongue got bigger which took some getting used to. But still I continue to mew as it's really helped me with my breathing problems and I could now care less about the astheatics.

I think it's a good thing you're seeing changes. It proves that mewing and mouth posture in general does affect our face. I would suggest to continue mewing as it is supposed to be the healthy way of breathing, eating, swallowing, etc. But if it's not for you, then it's not for you. Don't keep mewing of you find the changes aren't worth it. 

Or you can keep assessing your method of mewing, what other people are doing, and adjust your ways accordingly. You've sorta proven that it does make a difference. Now you just need to figure out how to make the right difference."
getdisciplined,fg6mrun,t3_ex1p95,1580572012.0,"I would do this a lot but I find I do it less not that I know why I do things. Before I would romanticize being this person that's studying what my parents want me to study and doing well in it; eating, exercising, dressing so that I look the way an attractive woman my age looks; talking to people like an extremely extroverted person with many friends and connections: etc. I would ""work"" towards these goals by watching videos, listening to audiobooks, making decisions based whether or not it helps me get to these goals. But things would always fall through.

 I'll never finish the book. I'll use maybe just one thing I learned from the video and only once. It was sooooo boring to work towards these things.

Then I started reading a bit of Simon Sinek's start with why, and I realize why actually doing these things sucked. And it's because they didn't have a why behind them. They were purposeless. The only real why these goals kinda have is that it's what I think success is based on what other people seem to say. However, if I don't wholely believe in this then there's no motivation behind these tasks whatsoever.


I've started really thinking about why I want things, what my overall why is in life, and this has made things so much easier. 

I study just enough now in what my parents want me to do because why? Because I want to simply make my parents happy with a degree. Because as soon as I'm done studying I can do what I want to do guilt free from my parents etc. I don't aim to be this perfect student they wanted anymore because I didn't care about that or about working in the field I'm studying. But I do care about making my parents happy to some extent. And I care about proving to myself that I can finish a degree.

I exercise now and eat healthier why? Because I want to be stronger and I inherently like weightlifting. Is it the best path to looking hot? Maybe not for me and not according to the ideal body, but that's not what I care about anymore. I care about having an hour to get strong while getting to listen to one of my favourite horror podcasts. 

I talk to more people now, is it because I want more friends and I want to be extroverted? Not really. It's because I realize that some people just like having a person to talk to. And I like sometimes having a person to talk to. I also realized the value in connections (not friendships). Some people are good at things I'm not. I don't have to be this perfect human when there's someone who's even more amazing at something who might actually be interested in helping me if I just ask. This to me is more valuable than being popular and having lots of friends. Knowing what people are good at, what they inherently enjoy doing, what they're working on. It's so much more meaningful and it gives a purpose to my goal of ""talking more""


Sorry for the long read.
TLDR:
I think romantacizing of tasks and stuff happen because we don't really know the purpose behind something, so instead we look to someone else doing the things we want to be doing because it seems like they have a clearer purpose than we do, therefore they work harder and that's so much better than what we're doing.

Defining the why behind everything you do will help you do thing more and with a lot less resistance. So long as the why is something you ACTUALLY believe in and care about, you'll find doing things will naturally happen because they align with you, your actual needs and your actual beliefs. 

This takes time and it can be somewhat uncomfortable because you might realize that there's no why behind the things you do and trying to find a why can be hard. The way I did it is that in the end I want to be happy, and I focus my why's on what is it that makes me happy."

getdisciplined,fg42u4w,t1_fg2w12d,1580494990.0,"Totally agree, once I started figuring out the real why behind the things I do, it's become so much easier to do things. 

Something that really helped me with chores is the goal of moving out. I know I can't move out unless I'm actually able to sustain myself and do things like clean the bathroom, laundry, cook etc. Now chores are inherently something I want to do because of my goal of moving out.

No clue how different things will be when I actually do move out though. But for now, this method is working!"

getdisciplined,fehesjx,t3_ep0q9u,1579115057.0,"Love this. This is what I do to reset my brain every now and then. This is also the purpose of meditation. I hate meditation though as I either end up falling asleep, or I have a dibilitating anxiety attack. 

Anyways. I second this method, HARD. I also find this works best when I choose to focus on something that I really like. That way I practice complete focus even longer. For me, this is tending to my plants. Spending half an hour to a whole hour just focusing on watering, fertilizing my plants and absolutely nothing else has kept my mind so clear it's honestly amazing. 

I don't get the foggy feeling of days melting together nearly as much anymore. When I'm feeling lost or stuck in a pattern I just have a brain resetting session with my plants.

Having a physical embodiment of the output that my focus produces is really nice too. It's great being surrounded by healthy plants. Their well being is like the perfect representation of my mental clarity"
