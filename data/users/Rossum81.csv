Let me preface this with two caveats.  Those Trump haters, yes, I get it.  He's uncouth and acts like the proverbial bull in a china shop.  He doesn't give a damn about the proprieties and his rhetoric can be vicious.  Even a number of his supporters wish he'd stop Twitter.  You disagree with his policies and he revels in your discomfort.  He attacks those who should be courting.  His populist shtick is creepy AF for the historically minded.  I get it all.  

I did not vote for Clinton in 2016 (no Stein for that matter).  I have watched her career since she said she was part of a 2 for one deal in the early 90s.  Her career had been a horror show: Whitewater; the cattle futures scam; the shabby treatment of the staff of the White House Travel Office; her bullying Juanita Broderick and other victims of her husband; the secrecy of the Clinton Health plan; the Clinton Foundation; Haiti aid; Benghazi; the illegal, insecure server used to dodge FOIA requests;  and the spoliation of tens of thousands of emails THAT SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ON A PRIVATE SERVER; the Marie Antoinette style 'Deplorables' crack; the rigging of the 2016 primaries; getting questions ahead of time from the press; and more scandals, screwups and sleaze that I may have forgotten.  Hilary Clinton is corrupt and incompetent.  I can live with one, but not both.

However, I was not a Trumpkin in 2016.  I joined my local GOP to work against him in the primaries.  (I was for Walker, then Cruz).  I was appalled by his antics and his penchant for attacking fellow Republicans.  He did win the nomination fairly, albeit helped by the inordinate press attention lavished on him.  That was partially understandable, but I wonder how much was because the press thought he was the weakest and most divisive candidate.

As I joked, I didn't hold my nose and pull the lever for Trump, I wore a gas mask.  And what happens?  The same people who wrote hand-wringing pieces abut Trump refusing to guarantee he would not contest the election results and who fretted how he would act if he won the popular vote, but lost the electoral college LOST THEIR FUCKING SHIT!  We had the attempts to create faithless electors and the bashing of the EC since.  From the word go there was the impeachment attempt from the word go.  The corruption and incompetence of the DOJ (especially the FBI) and Foggy Bottom should no longer shock.  The FISA abuses are straight out of the Church Committee nightmares.

All that screaming about Trump crushing civil liberties and becoming a dictator- how much was projection?  The masks of his opponents are off and it's not pretty.

Nevertheless Trump is succeeding.  After years of underemployment I have a job that literally is because of the policies that is directly because of his lowering interest rates.  We have a manufacturing and energy boom.  The 'stay in Mexico' policy means fewer illegal immigrants AND fewer kids in cages, which started under Obama.  He is treating the Iranian regime as the vicious adversary it is and not paying the Danegeld.  His diplomacy with North Korea is making that region more stable.  Moving the embassy to Jerusalem sent a needed 'FU' message to the PA they're not wise enough to heed, but needed to hear.  Our NATO allies are being put on notice to carry their share.  And his trade and energy policies put us on better footing to confront Russia and China. 

TLDR: Didn't want him in 2016, Hill would have been worse.  2020, he's better than I hoped and his opponents were dumber and crookeder than I imagined.  End result, I will crawl over the metaphorical broken glass to vote them man back into office."

I have Devin Singletary.  If I keeper him it will impact my draft position.  Our league has a rule that lets the owners choose where they are in the draft by being picked from a hat.
