Your girlfriend hasn't been okay at all, no exception for bad behaviour, but let's be real she isn't in her usual state of mind. Everybody grieves differently.

Is there a way you can do both ceremonies in the same day?

When my ex didn't come to my close loved one's funeral it absolutely tore me apart he is all I needed to get me through. I totally understand your predicament with the wedding and the preparation you've taken for this.

This is a horrible and twisted case of ""shit happens"", I'm so sorry."

You have no proof that your mother set her up, but we don't know her or what she's like. Your grandma may have written it wrong due to age/forgetfulness and genuinely made a mistake, perhaps? Again, we don't know her to judge. 

Best thing to do? Go speak to your grandma, explain that you don't want the rest of the money/another cheque - if she's like every grandma I know she'll force you to have it in which I think you should humbly and gratefully take. Mostly because I've always known the elderly to be greatly offended when rejected gifts (in my culture). And then have dinner with her or just do something nice with her. Don't press your mother too much as it may cause a rift through the family.

His daughter is a grown damn woman. Your daughter put her own paychecks forward to help herself and she was clearly a lot younger - so why can't his daughter cater for herself?

This woman wants help for nothing but her own selfishness. One thing I am unclear on is, does she live with you both? Or does she have her own place? If she lives with you I sort of understand why she'd want her own place now you are married to her dad. But, if she lives in a place already she will have to make do and quite frankly grow the fuck up and put her life in her own hands.
