Alternatively if the kids are his offspring it would still be the same familial pool of alleles that are involved in the selection process. As per the definition you gave groups can also be the target of NS. The environment to which they are ""unfit"" for is the area they live in having sometimes dangerous algea blooms and having to trust in warnings. If they don't comply they are unfit for their environment and are less likely to pass on their genes to the subsequent generations. Both ways there is an argument there for natural selection."
facepalm,ffg476k,t1_ffg13rc,1579898095.0,"It's still natural selection even if it is by some external force. A volcano erupting and killing them is also natural selection. 

As long as nature does the selecting, it counts. The opposite of ""natural selection"" would be ""artificial selection"" aka ""selection"". Breeding programs (for wheat or for dogs for example) or eugenics programs are examples of artificial selection. But a person dieing (more or less) randomly, and not **by design** counts as natural selection. It would actually be pretty darwinistic if a parent accidentally kills his own offspring, which has the same effect as if he had killed himself before having had children from a population standpoint.

And just to be clear, yes it would be manslaughter, negligence, etc. Not disagreeing with you there"

science,fff1ndi,t1_ffenlsc,1579873235.0,"There is never a guarantee that anything that works or doesn't work in mice will end up working in humans or being more helpful than harmful for humans (both of which are required for approval). But mice are very useful for studying the way a drug works. 

We can test drugs in a test tube, on tissue culture, on small animals, or on humans. Test tubes and tissue cultures have their limitations regarding the effect of the drug on the rest of the body, and whether or not the active ingredient even reaches the place it needs to go. Using small animals can tell us something about how it affects the metabolism, and how the drug is broken down. Also mice are specifically bred for being test animals. There are different types of lab mice for different purposes. Lastly in mice we can have replicable results since we can get more mice with the exact same genetic makeup, which is unethical and hard to get in humans. Also you can rear the mice in specific conditions to study the environmental interaction of the drug within the body."

gaming,ffa8kil,t1_ff9ps6z,1579729983.0,"I understand what it is that you (or the other guy) want. Having the most prized unlockables be free and locked behind a skill barrier is a good move. That is unless you are trying to continue to actively develop the game. In the previous example, Overwatch is still getting more heros and more maps, etc.  So, they require a revenue stream to support this. Hence micro-transactions. You can't realistically have *no* MTX unless you finance the development through other means, so they let impatient people get those coins by paying real money and unlocking that one legendary they care most about.

TBH the thing I love most about OW compared to other modern shooters is that every character has everything unlocked straight out of the box. I don't have to grind 40 levels until I can finally use all the weapons or use the crazier characters. As somebody with less and less freetime I appreciate that."

I was just playing GB over the weekend and got involved in a war in the HRE and constantly had to pause and check which stacks were hostile and which were friendly because I don't know Ansbach's or Salzburg's flags by heart. If any of these even change suddenly... woooo boi 

Also how would this work? Which flag of the two nations that formed the union would be the new flag? In the case of Spain inheriting Burgundy the smaller nation would impose its flag upon the larger nation? I would be upset if I secure a union over East Frisia as England and promptly get the East Frisian flag lol"

facepalm,femsjdr,t1_femm12n,1579268378.0,"Just speaking for myself here, but I quite like that there are rigorous testing standards for medicines. The unfortunate side effect in this hypercapitalist society we built is that getting a new product through testing and to market is that you have to invest a boatload of money into the trials. So, of course the pharmacy companies protect their investments with patents.

MapPorn,fdgxsj0,t1_fdgvnsu,1578410949.0,"FWIW the game-mechanic changes going from Civ4 to Civ5 were far greater than from 5 to 6. There is a lot of people who prefer the older mechanics. On the other hand civ 5 reached the largest audience and is still competing with Civ 6 in terms of player numbers.

In my personal opinion they are all good games. Hard to compare because they are so different, so it ends up being personal preference. Civ 6 has a bit of a problem with having too many game-breaking exploits, though"
IAmA,fcxmk6g,t1_fcwmnbt,1578066528.0,"The reluctance to show flags and to be ""proud of being a German"" is mostly because German society is wary of being overly patriotic. Nationalism can very quickly turn sour, as we learned. So, Germans kind of “check” each other. It’s not that it is taboo to be proud of our country or an athletic performance (for example) but that we have a lot of bad memories associated with people yelling “Germany is the best!” and flags everywhere. 

The other thing about hiding your nationality to obtain work is a very real issue. I am quite young but have lived in a few different countries around the world. And my experience as a German in South America was wildly different than it was in the USA. I would even avoid telling people that I was German in the states because I was tired of the typical reactions."

JurassicPark,fcu6x92,t1_fctomqf,1577974013.0,"I recently reread (listened to, actually) the book. I didn't quite remember just how obsessed Hammond was. He does not see the Dinos as ""wild animals"" that could ever have a mind of their own and possibly cause a problem. Everytime something goes wrong he quickly goes into denial. Even until the very end, he is sure that it is all just a little hick-up and his people just need to fix things and they will be back on track in no time. He doesn't perceive even the slightest bit of danger until he gets trapped in a ravine by himself with a twisted ankle and nobody hears his shouting. That is the only time Hammond realizes that the situation is serious, and instead of realizing he made mistakes he just gets angry at his employees for messing it all up.

That is also why Ian Malcolm is constantly talking about the chaos theory. Hammond and Malcolm are just butting against each other. One is convinced that since he is the creator of the park he naturally has full control over the park and there is nothing to be concerned with (despite all of his employees constantly warning Hammond) and the other is convinced that any complex system is is destined to collapse. 

I remember specifically about the raptors, Hammond is trying to convince Wu that they need to change the raptors to be more entertaining for the park. He wants to engineer them to be less scary and violent, not because he thinks they are dangerous but because they are frightening to potential park-visitors. 

TL;DR - Hammond in the books is a shitty, greedy businessman who lives in the delusion that since he ""made"" the park he is in full control over everything in the park. As soon as things go wrong it is clearly the fault of his employees."
