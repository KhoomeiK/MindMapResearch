iPhoneX,ffot7v0,t1_ffoneg2,1580081458.0,I might give this a try on the next couple of days ...
iPhoneX,ffn92n9,t1_ffn7rwf,1580063260.0,Thing is - I want to be logged in. I enter my credentials but the pop ups keep coming.
GetMotivated,fflvn0l,t3_eu3lmu,1580044717.0,Well eventually there’ll be a time that we can live enjoying live in balance and holding a certain weight right? Until then I’ll try and stick with it ...
youseeingthisshit,ffltgnu,t3_eu47t2,1580043897.0,Yeah that’s not creepy at all /s (hide under bed)
GetMotivated,fflsond,t1_ffllwyr,1580043670.0,You may not be able to see it now but there’s a lot of good shit happening on this dirt rock in space. Please talk to someone: http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/hotlines?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
GetMotivated,ffls6kb,t1_ffl1i70,1580043411.0,Well that sucks. But you’ll get better after however long that takes and start then. Still a lot of days to turn it around! Good luck!
GetMotivated,fflrvh7,t1_fflmmwr,1580043287.0,Yeah you can - it’s all a mind game. You know the drill; just do it! I believe the turnaround for me was the 7 minute app to workout (my main excuse is that I don’t have time) ...
GetMotivated,fflre0i,t1_fflemeh,1580043195.0,At 5.8 down and yeah the no drinking  part sucks. Though I do seem to have a clearer mind during daytime. You go stranger - we’ll get to the goal in time :)
pics,ff6d2ds,t3_erssvv,1579624555.0,That looks rad
CasualConversation,ff2tv09,t3_er6mzh,1579523941.0,This DOES sound like the beginning of something beautiful. Enjoy the moment and good luck!
Tiguan,fesk72h,t1_fese5dk,1579366084.0,Wish mine would have seat position memory and the mirror memory ... still a happy camper though. I’ll have to try the steering on sport
tifu,fep71mu,t3_eq59kp,1579313580.0,"I can relate, luckily it didn’t take 16 years to find out though. Wow. That’s a long time! Glad to hear that you found the right tool for the job though :)"
recovertogether,fep6t06,t3_eqa0i1,1579313426.0,Glad to hear it works for you!

DnB,fel9sm6,t1_fekw4yl,1579217186.0,Love the username! I’m a transplant and live in New England now ... sadly no electronic music venue to be found anywhere close :(
Tiguan,fegmmjk,t1_fegmjsy,1579097349.0,Got it - can’t wait to try it out :P
Tiguan,fegj1ce,t3_eot8di,1579094278.0,"Wow that is pretty awesome. Will try launch control next (mumbling Lightning McQueens ‘I am speeed) - seriously though thanks for the tips! When using lunch control, so you floor the throttle or hover between 3-4K before releasing the brakes?"
Tiguan,fef9d4h,t1_feewg0z,1579051262.0,I started out in eco all the time but for some reason seem to have better mileage with regular drive. Plus I am lazy and don’t get why I have to select eco every time I get in the car. So now I drove in regular (or snow since in New England) and am happy with that :)
Tiguan,feen053,t3_eor59f,1579037047.0,"If you are in a pinch or at a very busy street, you can always go into ‘speed mode’ by tapping the gear shift backwards once. It will leave the engine on running."
macgaming,feciffz,t1_febde8g,1578974682.0,Boot camp will work well for you
food,fdz04kz,t1_fdsapu8,1578785386.0,"Yes. And as always, the Saran Wrap is applied to the surface of the product, so that there is no moisture buildup. Also: this is not to get the ganache to 4C, this is just to get it to cool in a reasonable amount of time. Moisture can also happen due to condensation when taking it out of the fridge (especially in humid environments). 

Ideally ganache is let to crystallize on a marble table with air conditioning running ... but often that environment isn’t there ..."
food,fdqxpv9,t1_fdqsp43,1578676314.0,"If you let the ganache crystallize in a bowl, a little refrigeration won’t be so bad. When firming up chocolate generates heat and you may want to counter that with refrigeration. Depending on the size of batch it can just be 30 minutes or so."
CasualConversation,fcw7eja,t1_fcvvx7p,1578018856.0,Great post dude. I’m the same height and the heaviest ever today at 224. Going to loose some weight a well. Go get em!
DnB,fct8g1u,t3_eiizeg,1577935649.0,Happy New Year Mate! Is there any club playing DnB or Jungle in that area? We are staying for a few nights in Christchurch in August ... and I might be able to sneak out of the house at night :)

tifu,fcka4uv,t3_ehhhh5,1577720633.0,Your last sentence is the important one. Don’t think it can’t be done better with anything. Question stuff. Glad it eventually worked out :) enjoy crafting!
