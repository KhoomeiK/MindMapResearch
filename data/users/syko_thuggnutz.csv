That is beside the point, however.  Also, abortion rights aren’t explicitly covered in the US Constitution."
PoliticalHumor,ff57cqs,t1_ff56vpa,1579582354.0,"Ok OP, slow down and think about how some of these people may feel.

The original proposal literally stated that if a person did not turn in a semi-automatic rifle with a pistol grip, that person was to be charged with a class 3 felony.

It comes down to what many feel is a violation of a constitutional right compounded with the forced seizure of private personal property."
PoliticalHumor,ff56mnk,t3_erojpd,1579581731.0,There was a stipulation where certain weapons were to be turned in immediately lest the owner be guilty of a felony.  No grandfathering or anything.  That was the one that really pissed people off.

news,fewnc48,t1_fewmi05,1579415603.0,"Medical history of the *biological parent*.

Edit:
To clarify, I was thinking more along the lines of having official documentation so a person knows with certainty where their genes come from.

I was unaware that birth certificates currently list people who biologically are not connected to the live birth (as it’s often called a Certificate of Live Birth).

Now brace yourselves for another unpopular opinion:  adoptive parents should never have their names on a Certificate of Live Birth unless it is distinguished who is biological and who is not.

No anger here, people, so relax the insults please."

This physique is 100% only attainable via steroids (and training, of course).  Steroids don’t give just some trivial advantage to muscle gain.

If you juiced up 100 guys and put them on the same training program, some would probably be buffer and look better aesthetically than Mr. Johnson here."
