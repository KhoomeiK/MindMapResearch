The people we root for do bad things, the people we like get killed/beaten down, it's not enjoyable. It just mentally drags the viewer down and there's never any pay off for the suffering.

When you were a child did you ever go away to cry but secretly wish your mom would come in? That's self harm. They're scared and embarrassed but they want the help. So yes, they ""want attention"", but it's not as clear cut as it seems and you should have empathy.

These kind of comments are actually really dangerous because it implies an acceptable way to self harm. You've praised and sympathized with a secret cutter and shamed open ones, which is the opposite of what you should want. Self harm needs to be identified, helped, and recovered from. Not hidden.

The reason people argue we live in a rape culture is because of the quantity of assaults committed, and the underlying attitudes around sexuality which they believe encourage an override of consent. I'm not saying you're wrong, but your logic is coming from the wrong place. Plus, a lot of people have had things that may not be legally considered assault but still traumatized them because of the ambiguity of consent in certain situations.
