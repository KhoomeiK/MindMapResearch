They have also spent close to a billion in signing players this year. The problem is so many of those have turned out to be flops. It's not like they are squeezing the club dry. There are very strong laws out there to prevent that.

FantasyPL,ff5o56t,t3_erhf8j,1579602769.0,"There is a video of Dr. Hannah Fry on the Numberphile channel that explains this better without mentioning toilets. 

The problem with this technique is that it is supposed to be used AFTER we have gained complete information about the thing we are going to make a decision on, and it works one door at a time. It does not apply to our FPL Triple Captain choice situation. When you open the toilet door you know exactly how good or bad it is. You make the decision to use the toilet after you have seen it. At the same time, you do not know absolutely nothing about the next toilet.   
 In FPL, we get full information about our choices after the matches are done, at which point we can't use the TC chip. Beforehand we can only get expected values for what our players will score. We can anyways have these expected values for all fixtures upto matchday 38, although the farther away they are, the less accurate they'll be. If expected values are all that you're basing your decision after then you should be going for the fixture that has the highest expected points score instead of just the first expected points score that is higher than the first 14 matches."
