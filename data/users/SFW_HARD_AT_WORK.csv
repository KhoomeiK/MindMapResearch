St louis is only a midwest city because it's in Missouri imo.  They share a lot with the south.  Food, music,  civil war history, etc.  Even their accent, while not southern,  is more southern than ours (in Canada people thought I was from tx or Alabama I heard a few times).  A good example of a true midwesterner city would be Lincoln, ne, or Davenport, ia, Joplin mo, or even Kansas city.  While KC is an outlier,  the cities aren't very diverse.  Overwhelmingly middle and working class but low cost of living allows most people to live in reasonable houses.  Also, culturally you can tell agriculture and trades still play huge roles in the economies.  It's more traditional and conservative values rule but its slightly different than the south in a way that's hard to explain unless you see it.  Midwesterners are like southerners minus the sweet tea, but swap out a casserole or reginal dish or something.   We dont wave and talk to random people walking by in cincy and the pace is definitely faster.  Fashion, fancy cars, etc you'll see more here.  Also, the midwest is pretty flat and not super architecturally significant imo.  All the cities are like Columbus with the demographics/style as reading/batavia/blue ash.  Also, I don't think were rust belt not because we didn't have the industry but that it didn't crash as hard here, in comparison to the areas directly around us like Hamilton,  Middletown or Dayton which very much look like rust belt cities."

I agree to an extent.  As someone posted above, figuring out your childhood trauma as an adult is really hard on a person.  Going through now and this is one thing that really fucked me up and I came to realize it.  Disciplining your child is necessary,  but flipping a switch between tv mom and angry lunatic, yelling at and beating your kid with the metal end of belts, extension cords or clothes hangers for something like not saying ""yes ma'am "" in a tone you like then saying that you did that out of ""love"" is completely fucked up.  Not a parent,  but if I ever become one I'll never do that to a child. I'd been asked if I was abused as a child a few times before and was so taken aback at how someone could just ask that,  but as I've gotten older I see it and its really hard to reverse some things at 32"

nfl,feegrr1,t1_feeg45p,1579033435.0,Even before then we weren't bad.  In the 70s we had some decent seasons.  We never really sucked until the 90s and never recovered. The Steelers on the other hand were fucking terrible from 1933-1970
nfl,feef1h1,t1_feeb2yv,1579032420.0,"No, I'm arguing that our historical woes are a little overblown."
nfl,fee0gcg,t1_fedvz84,1579023783.0,With the 27th pick... but you're still right. I should clarify that he doesn't value guards enough to draft one in the top 15
nfl,fedva3v,t1_fedljtf,1579020638.0,"Before mike brown we were a pretty successful organization.   Outside if the 70s and 90s and recent years, the stealers have been pretty terrible. Dont let the recency bias of reddit misguide us

For the downvoters, look at the Steelers record from their inception to 1970... Lots of last place finishes"
nfl,fedv22k,t1_fedndpl,1579020505.0,We already have 2 legit guys next to aj
nfl,feduulh,t1_fedffk5,1579020380.0,I think andy goes to the Patriots.. I think he's a perfect bellichick qb and bill really likes Marvin's players.  Gio  bernard is a matter of time too
nfl,fedul7l,t1_fedn1ny,1579020219.0,Honestly taylor looked a little in over his head a lot last year.  Hopefully he calms down this year
nfl,fedug6e,t1_fedfe9k,1579020133.0,"I know we joke, but you obviously dont know mike brown.  He doesn't. Value guards.   He'd never draft one first round even if they were the highest graded player in the draft.  He convert them to tackle a la andrew whitworth.if we bungle this thing its gonna be chase young or an olineman for sure"
CFB,fecakt1,t3_eoehbi,1578969640.0,This coaches film room analysis is absolutely amazing.   Gundy/patterson calling plays they run against each other and shit.
CFB,fec3k58,t1_fec3717,1578966137.0,Best insight I've seen
CFB,fec3gvf,t1_fec314o,1578966098.0,Best thing ESPN has done in a long time
CFB,fec3fe1,t1_fec34qy,1578966080.0,Its fucking awesome.   Football with actual coach insights.  Patterson and Hafley come off really smart and Gundy probably has a career in broadcasting if he ever leaves okst.   Derrick Masons record at Vanderbilt kinda shows...
