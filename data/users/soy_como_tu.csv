Teachers,ff01n8a,t3_eqr56p,1579464223.0,Haha this reminds me of a time I saw a rat get rolled over super slowly while on carpool duty and I lost my shit in front of like 20 kindergarteners.
Teachers,fetogul,t3_eqea0y,1579377617.0,We should be friends! This is exactly how I feel. I think I always look like such an asshole to other teachers at meetings because I am so checked out after 10 minutes ... but I am so happy and animated in my classroom!

bulletjournal,fc5dipe,t3_egb8ek,1577454288.0,"Top 3 Books:
1. Talking to Strangers by Malcolm Gladwell 
2. Born a Crime by Trevor Noah
3. Room by Emma Donognue

Bottom 3:
1.  One Day in December by Josie Silver (this was terrible, but I refused to quit so that's why it is my #1 worst book of the year)
2. The Water Dancer by Ta-Nehisi Coates (only made it 75% so it's not on the list, but it did not live up to the hype for me)
3. Crazy Rich Asians by Kevin Kwan (only made it 50% and returned it to the library because I also didn't get the hype for this story)"
