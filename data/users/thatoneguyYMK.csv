This assuming you have a credit history at all. Essentially its a loan agreement between you and a stranger, usually worked through a 3rd party program or site.

You may also try a loan from friends or family that's been legally documented and notarized, making it an official loan. [Here a site with some documents that can be used](https://www.ilrg.com/forms/promnote/us/)

Getting into the shady side, or grey area, you can look into Crypto loans, which require no credit checks. Idk much about these, but I've seen them floating around. You'd need a general understanding of crypto and how to access it to turn it into FIAT. Nexo.io is one of the bigger names I've seen."

I'd say if you noticed him grabbing a knife, you'd be better off dropping the choke and trying to control the arm the weapon is in or going to be in, and attempt to disarm.

If you don't think that's possible, you'd be better off dropping the choke and building distance, then if given no choice, attempt a disarm. Use anything that may aid in disarming or blocking a knife. Control the knife by controlling the arm and hand that wields it. Don't stand directly in front, but to a side, as this will cause the knife wielder to have to move more to get to you, making his moves more telegraphed.

If you have a knife and are in a choke hold, you'd actually be better off cutting into the inner portion of the assailant's elbow that is choking you.

When the monocular fields of view are stitched together, our binocular FOV gives us around 114 degrees of view horizontally and is necessary for depth perception. Our peripheral vision makes up the remaining 60–70 degrees and has only monocular vision because only one eye can see those sections of the visual field. These measurements are based on the FOV during steady fixation of the eyes.

I don't sob cry, but my eyes water heavily when confronted in a personal situation that's highly stressful. Typically yelling or when you get the feeling that you may have to fight.
The best explanation I've found is that its part of the bodies natural reaction when faced with a situation that triggers a ""fight or flight"" response, with reactions being kind of groomed into you at a young age (violence, submission, emotional shutdown). From the sounds of it, your body associates verbal conflict with inevitable physical punishment, so it reacts with crying as a flight or fight response, due to your upbringing (not a professional btw).

The long short, is its kind of... natural I guess, and hard wired. You can change it with some work and professional help.

Also, I don't mind parents who TASTEFULLY spank their children, but what is going on with you sounds like straight abuse. Get help.
