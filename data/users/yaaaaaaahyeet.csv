selfhelp,fedtc3x,t3_elya94,1579019455.0,"Yeah this is great. Similar thing is to think imagine you’re talking to someone you love or your best friend whatever. If your friend messes up you wouldn’t bash them, you would positively reassure them it’s ok no big deal whatever (unless ur a ********) so for the same to yourself.
I am trying to learn this too."
selfimprovement,fe9695e,t3_enrbpi,1578934733.0,Hang in there man. Like I’ve had said to me before during serious rough times. In time things will change for the better. It may take a while but keep working on it and you’ll see the light

Is this like manifesting?

Mindfulness,fdefnnq,t1_fdeemxw,1578337995.0,Thank you for all your help today. I have become more wise on the subject.
Mindfulness,fdedcuj,t1_fdearcx,1578336558.0,"Thanks I’m going to check those out.

What I mention in my previous comment though, sorry I might have communicated it poorly.

My question was is it as simple as going down the noticing route I mentioned? 

And then the way you don’t want to go is the judging route I mentioned afterwards?"
Mindfulness,fde94e4,t1_fde8bis,1578333893.0,As a side note how do I learn to love myself more during all this ?
Mindfulness,fde2b8i,t1_fde0ff6,1578329586.0,"Also “just notice, don’t judge”

Does thag work like this for example:

Noticing: 

1. Thought comes into my mind of me doing something bad a year ago 

2. I see it, as just that thought, don’t look into it, focus staying present then it’ll move on


Then if I was to be Judging:


1. Thought comes into my mind of me doing something bad a year ago 

2. I think about what stemmed from it

3. I think about that day

And so on?"
Mindfulness,fde1w3v,t1_fde17mv,1578329316.0,"So being mindful, is practically being present, your just there doing whatever you’re doing. Like right now I’m watching Netflix. I looked at this comment and realised I was just focused on the show, no thoughts. In a way is that being mindful?

And is that me quieting those thoughts as I’m being mindful as there’s no inside dialogue then? 

And then when you say “your thoughts can be a opportunity to use mindfulness” is that saying when you realise you’re off down the trail of thinking, you become aware of that and stop yourself. That’s you practicing being mindful?"
Mindfulness,fde061y,t1_fddppg0,1578328178.0,So you’re saying - I’ll always think. My mind will always have this inside dialogue. But it’s learning that it’s my friend not my enemy. Let it chill?
Mindfulness,fddloyh,t1_fddg43a,1578317008.0,"The thought of it just existing resonates with me.

So it’s not good or bad. It’s just there. When it appears I can observe that it is exactly that - just there. Then maybe focus on the sound of the fan blowing and my feet on the floor then I’m present again and the thought disappears. That would be a good outcome?

If I start talking to the thought, or responding to it, feeling emotion towards it then I’ve identified with it and “failed” in a way?"
Mindfulness,fddgee7,t1_fddfjz4,1578311122.0,How do I feel it? How do I make it physical?
Mindfulness,fdddiem,t1_fddceod,1578307130.0,"I’ve thought about the alternative route - as soon as I think of a negative thought / past thought whatever if I just instantly become aware I’ve drifted into it to then think of positive things. But not sure if that’s just temporarily hiding it. Instead of becoming better at living with them.

Also to your first part,how exactly do I accept a thought? I don’t like what I think so how do I accept em?"
Mindfulness,fdd9a0y,t1_fdd7r5u,1578300769.0,"So say recurring thoughts happen, if I practice just focusing on the breath/present when I fall into the trap of thinking negative eventually it’ll be like I don’t fall into the thoughts because I’m training not too?"
