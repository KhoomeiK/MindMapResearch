Rainbow_Babies,feag46p,t1_fe7zkdb,1578948255.0,I waited until 7 months to move LO to his room and then it only happened because DH and I were clearly disrupting his sleep in the morning as we were getting up and getting ready. And I cried and cried and cried because he was so far away from me. I 100% think it is loss-related. I also have had a very hard time separating from LO when he goes to daycare (this has gotten much easier with time but was tremendously hard in the beginning) and know in my heart it has a lot to do with the babies that came before him.

We just use a large wet bag hanging from a door knob and we occasionally get a wet diaper smell. Could rinse overnight diaps out of the smell was worse/bothered us and I bet that would be gone.
