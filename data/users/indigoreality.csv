I have a computer science undergrad background so I can't really speak with impartiality. I took a Datacamp source on Python since my company paid for it and got through all the basics within a week. The tutorials are very easy to follow and try out. I think sites like Datacamp make it easy for all levels to learn, regardless of experience."

Also you mentioned:

so I'm not sure if using Reddit as a benchmark would be a good idea then. There is a hive-mind like quality on Reddit (it's unavoidable really, but not necessarily a bad thing), so I'd take precaution."

CFA,fdedqru,t1_fdeci9z,1578336799.0,"I went to University of Maryland. The program was called Master of Finance. Just a couple years ago they created a new program called Master of Quantitative Finance which is more programming focused. If this was available when I first started, I would've taken it. But we were able to mix and match classes for electives.

I have a computer science undergrad background so I can't really speak with impartiality. I took a Datacamp source on Python since my company paid for it and got through all the basics within a week. The tutorials are very easy to follow and try out. I think sites like Datacamp make it easy for all levels to learn, regardless of experience."

The overlap helps with studying some of the material but the benefits of the MFin (depending on the school) was the networking and the career services.

Level 3 was very portfolio/asset management heavy. My current job is doing financial engineering and econometric modeling which draws from both CFA and MFIn, but if I were to choose one, I'd say the MFin helped me more with my job because of all the hands-on Python and R modeling we did in class."

MensLib,fcu6qk1,t3_eitulq,1577973885.0,"I also have tiger (Asian) parents too. Their expectation of me was to become a doctor because that's what Asian parents like to do at gatherings, brag about their children. It's always about bragging and status in our community. Part of this resulted in my sisters and I being sent to learn instruments at a young age so that we would entertain our relatives with our musical talent at Thanksgiving or relative's death anniversaries.  

I stopped comparing myself to others (it really is on your own to willingly choose to do this because it's hard to not compete with others) during my mid-twenties. Given that it's the new year now, I learned to start comparing myself to where I was a year ago. Did I improve? Am I able to run further/longer than last year? Can I lift more? 

At the end of the day, it's what you can do with your body. Not ""what you can do with your body versus what other people can do with their bodies"". I have a chronic back condition so in order for an apples to apples comparison in any sort of competitive space, my opponents will also have to have the exact same back conditions as I do to be fair. That's where I learned that it's futile to compare because it will always be apples to oranges."

The majority go by 2010-2019. Itâ€™s a majority by numbers thing at this point. People will argue against you just because they believe majority by numbers should win but I donâ€™t agree with that.
