nfl,fdhp870,t1_fdhofuv,1578427413.0,"Like I said, a rule change is fine, but currently it’s within the rules. As to the sliding, why do you think Wilson isn’t tripped up like that? He’s not trying to go out and juke the whole team and run/cut around like wentz was. He only runs when he knows he has it in the open field and then slides. He really never takes hits in the open field as a runner. It’s not just wentz, RG3 did the same shit, among others. As of now, getting hit comes with the territory when you run. You could argue that defenders would be doing their team a disservice NOT hitting the qb and making him think twice about running again, as long as it’s within the rules. Defenses are already hamstrung, this is one of a few things they can still do to instill fear in the offense. Again, it’s a contact sport, shit happens. I would suggest not dying for a few yards on 1st (2nd?) down early in a game. Live to see another play. Dive when you have to"
nfl,fdhm3df,t1_fdhlqda,1578425542.0,"Contact isn’t NEEDED but it’s LEGAL. What I’m saying is qbs shouldn’t be running guns blazing because shit happens like this all the time. Rbs get hit like this all the time, but because it’s a qb now everyone notices. It’s a contact sport, put yourself in harms way don’t be surprised when you get hit. Wentz tore his acl and now was knocked out of a game from the same type of play. Wilson hasn’t missed a single game in his career. They both run. What’s the one difference?"
nfl,fdhk1vp,t1_fdhjttb,1578424302.0,That qbs should slide? Lol yea I am. Do you think players shouldn’t hit each other? We playin flag football? Why do you think Wilson slides every time? Why do you think this is the second injury wentz has gotten NOT sliding?
nfl,fdhhth3,t1_fdhhg8e,1578422945.0,"Ok but that’s literally always been apart of the game. Remember when nfl live used to have “jacked up”? It was literally a five minute highlight segment about these exact hits- and that was ~7 years ago. So if you are arguing there should be a rule change then sure. But as of now, when the qb is running he takes a hard hit, just like any other player. Defenders will do anything to get a hit on the qb especially. Shake em up and make them think twice about running. It’s always been in the game and why qbs historically don’t run. Why do you think Wilson stopped running for the past 5 years and when he does he slides every time?"
nfl,fdhgm1x,t1_fdhgedt,1578422216.0,"That’s what I’m saying. The qb was a runner in this scenario, which is why a guy like Wilson slides every single time, unless it’s a super high stakes situation. So it’s legal to hit him (wentz) just like any other player. Wentz also tore his acl 2 years ago diving just like this. Qbs need to slide to try and avoid injury"
nfl,fdhf5hb,t1_fdhf15i,1578421342.0,"Word, yea I see it most with younger ppl. I’m 25 but it seems like everyone <22 or so has auto cap off. Didn’t know it was a thing till I started texting this girl (22) and she has it off. Now I notice it everywhere"
nfl,fdhex6k,t1_fdheq75,1578421202.0,"It looks like you had auto capitalize off on your original comment (for iPhone). I’ve been seeing it a lot around social media and this girl I’ve been texting has it off, too. I’ve never seen it before about three months ago.

nfl,fdhchvg,t1_fdgxyqu,1578419919.0,"Yeah I mean we can get in to a debate on whether that should be legal or not, but right now wentz was diving forward and if a defender can get a hit on anyone, especially a qb, they will. It’s part of the sport, shake up the offensive players so they think twice about going into the defense. If it wasn’t a qb we probably don’t care as much. It probably should be illegal but at some point you have to just let physicality stay in the game."
nfl,fdhbw8u,t1_fdgs2jf,1578419619.0,Off topic question: why do I see auto cap off everywhere all of the sudden? Gen z thing?
nfl,fdhbser,t1_fdh2nue,1578419562.0,"Yeah I mean this is why qbs need to slide. If a defender can get a hit in a qb legally (or at least close) he does it 10/10 times. It’s a contact sport, and  part of the game is being rough. Is what it is."
