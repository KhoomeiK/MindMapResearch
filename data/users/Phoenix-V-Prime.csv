AskReddit,ffdj7zq,t3_esps5n,1579822020.0,"Loneliness. I went through this period of my life where I just ghosted practically everyone in my life outside of work because I obviously still needed to make money. It worked, everyone stopped texting/calling me and for 2 months I got exactly what I wanted.

I got sent on a business trip a few weeks in and I don’t know what happened but for some reason, I longed for social interaction. Maybe it was because I was in an area where I had no one I knew around me but wow it hit me. I just sat there and was scared that this is what my life could be, having no one watching your back or having no one to go to. 

At that point I started talking to everyone again and I was being the best version of myself that I could be. Those two months made me grateful for having the luxury of having such good people in my life because some people don’t have anyone. I also told myself to make more friends in the process because you never know if that person you pass by in the office or if that familiar face you saw on Twitter is going through something or just need someone to talk to."

I don’t know if sensory deprivation tanks are in your area but I’d highly recommend looking into it if you’re looking for a true clear space. It can be a bit off putting at first but going in with a good energy and clear visualization of what you want from you’re high then you’ll be in good hands. Personally I’ve been meaning to do it again because the idea of “love being a powerful weapon” struck me as interesting. I didn’t think love could be interpreted as a weapon let alone a powerful one. But I’m glad to see someone as had similar experiences.
StonerThoughts,fdlqld1,t3_em02sj,1578530140.0,I want to say I’ve gotten close. I took 7Omg of some gummies(I’m lightweight as fuck lul) and went into a sensory deprivation tank(hello freak bitches) for about an hour and a half. Being in that environment helps you zero in on thoughts better so it really compliments the high nicely. But I saw literal purple tears in the fabric of reality and I heard a voice speaking to me through those tears the voice was telling me about how love is a powerful weapon or that’s what I got from it at least.
