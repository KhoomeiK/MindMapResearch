TrueReddit,ff39c13,t1_ff38jr6,1579536739.0,"Yeah I sort of agree. I think he'll flee to Russia if the heat really comes on. Funny my much more level-headed coworker I discuss all this with doesn't think that will happen either. His prediction is someone will take the fall for trump, but I don't see why anyone would."
TrueReddit,ff37osg,t1_ff36ujm,1579535654.0,"I've brought this up a couple times to my coworkers and they have just kind of shrugged those off too. I think that's the best a lot of us can hope for but god knows how he can cloud and convolute those trials as well. If you know more on the subject and really think he's going to be indicted and imprisoned over, please share."

TrueReddit,fezrgvj,t1_feyrkr8,1579460711.0,"I have also read that sexual abuse was a systemic part of Native American life. The book Empire of The Summer Moon asserts as much. It discusses how despite newspapers of the time never reporting it because it being considered too horrifying, settlers being captured by indians invariably meant the women would be raped. Do you really think a culture so foundationally based on warfare wouldn't involve sexual violence as well? That person posted the link in good faith and probably isn't advancing any agenda. I agree with your last point it doesn't exactly look good, do you have any links to post yourself on the topic?"
ABoringDystopia,fezqfkr,t3_eqxc55,1579460349.0,"Someone posted a meme on insta the other day talking about how if your friends truly care they would make time to see you. I commented that it's more a construct of our outdated 40 hour work week and declining economy that people don't have time/energy to see each other anymore, a couple people commented to the effect that I was fucking crazy for pointing it out."

They'll call [Lonny Horiuchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lon_Horiuchi) back out of retirement and it'll be like a real life version of The Shooter, except he'll be glad to waste your ass and not be prosecuted for it. All that shit you listed is just a can of bean on the other end of Marky Mark's Cheytac."

Doomers,feftz9t,t3_eopke6,1579065135.0,"While in some ways I can identify with the nostalgia for the past, in a lot of other ways and instances I find it starts to bleed over into feelings that today's society is in terms of morality or ethics inferior or some might say ""degenerate"" and these calls for a return to the past start to sound an awful lot like one of the tenets of Ur-Fascism as defined by Umberto Eco. For a lot of people and a lot of times in the past life was full of fear and repression. Is life depressing and dystopian these days? Yes. But the constant talk of ""redpilling"" here and other doomer places creeps me the fuck out. Racism and antisemitism are not the answers to your problems. They are scapegoats presented by the real cause of societal ills, the rich and powerful who have stripped our culture of meaning beyond what is profitable in their drive to commodify everything."

perfectlycutscreams,fcwqifo,t1_fcuxf39,1578033667.0,Japan has offered to build high speed rail lines in the U.S. multiple times with help financing them plus I think pretty low interest loans. We've turned them down every time.

I don't know man, I guess its just a crass world we live in."
ABoringDystopia,fcrhsi7,t1_fcqy9be,1577901994.0,I don't care what anyone says about the merits of violent vs. nonviolent resistance. That man is a hero.
ABoringDystopia,fcrg7y9,t1_fcq37wn,1577901409.0,"Amen man. If anyone wants further evidence of this, I'd recommend the book America: The Farewell Tour by Chris Hedges. Its pretty brutally bleak but its important to look these things in the face and understand the insidiousness of them. Especially when so many people find it so easy to dismiss these things as outlandish conspiracy theories. Just because we live in a country that for many has a high standard of living doesn't mean it isn't still a dystopia."
Foodforthought,fcra6r3,t3_eibpop,1577899012.0,To me this is a really poignant example of what people are talking about when describe how the police are there to protect private property and state assets and absolutely not to keep communities safe. Otherwise this would be straight up dereliction of duty.
ANormalDayInAmerica,fco07ir,t3_ehvkb2,1577821729.0,The ending of this post reminded me of a scene from South Park where after the guy is shot dead everybody just goes back to the church service like nothing happened. I don't mean its from an actual episode but it just feels like it could be so hard you know?
news,fcnzjvn,t1_fcnqzgp,1577821407.0,"Coming from someone who just did an internship at a couple small-scale organic farms, it is a shitload of hard work and stress and that's just to break even. To me it seems like subsistence is pretty much the way to go. Having a few acres out somewhere that you can grow at least your own food on is a possibility. Trying to make money from farming these days seems discouraging, good luck to any who try, god knows we need them. Anyway, there's a book called Five Acres and Independence you might want to check out that goes over some ways to make it work. But it might only be practical in the U.S., maybe everywhere in your country is already crowded and expensive. :/"
Foodforthought,fcnwnth,t1_fcng2y3,1577819936.0,"I don't feel like we'll ever really know how much people with that much wealth and influence really buy into any of that shit and how much is just them understanding that's how you gain more power. I guess over time some do buy into their own insane worldviews but there's always a level of cynicism to it too, like most of the rules are for everybody else, just like always. Shilling and charlatanry go hand in hand with conservatism."

Even if it is available it doesn't mean people aren't excluded from it for a variety of reasons, societal stigma being an invisible and potentially hard to recognize one."
