I can’t imagine your heartbreak, we have two pups and I know how much I love them so I now your heart hurts. You’ll always miss him, but when you’re ready, opening up your heart again to another bundle of love will help with the healing"

PersonalFinanceCanada,fgy2f9b,t3_f0njjb,1581178834.0,Go look at postings for Accenture or another consulting firm to boost your experience - don’t work for free unless it’s in a field you are passionate about and is a very very limited term. Unpaid internships aren’t unheard of but aren’t good practice. Startup culture can be toxic - but depends on what you want to do!

NoStupidQuestions,fgxrcb3,t3_f0r2vi,1581175863.0,"As a Canadian, I cannot imagine the nightmare hellscape of paying to see a doctor. Had a baby last year that cost me $60 in parking. That was it. I had a gallbladder attack and took an ambulance to the hospital, cost me nothing. I go see my doctor when I don’t feel well, I don’t pay anything. 

To think that some Americans have to question even going to a doctor because of insurance, or co-pays or whatever is insanity and infuriates me on your behalf.

I don’t care that my taxes help my fellow Canadians get cancer treatment, or MRIs, or heart surgery or a hip replacement. Healthcare belongs to all humans."
keto,fgxnyly,t1_fgxk9nt,1581174817.0,Dang now I want to know what the hullabaloo was about! Keto causes autism or something equally stupid?
