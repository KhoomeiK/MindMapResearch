Eragon,fd8e0b5,t1_fd4ff9p,1578217295.0,"I can tell you're the argumentative sort who cannot admit themselves at fault. Arguing with you is a massive waste of time - not only do you repeat things 'tHiS iS caNnOn aNd cAnnOt bE deNieD' but I have read the books - all of them - and you use meaningless blabber to enforce your argument. Your whole argument rests on the assumption that the true name of a species would give you power over all members of that species. You are very wrong. If that was the case, the elves are so much more magically gifted than humans that they would've found the human true name and used it against Galbatorix. Just because Eragon knows the true name of dolphins does not give him power over all dolphins. You actually have changed your theory, I have not refused to engage in your words, if that were true then what have I been doing all this time? You insult me multiple times, an ad hominum fallacy which indicates not only that you feel frustrated that you cannot sway my beliefs, but also that you are ill-tempered and arrogant.

Funnily enough, I'm not surprised. I was born in England, it's my first language. While you are probably older and more knowledgeable than me, I think you've yet to find that argumentative annoyances such as yourself who resort to insulting the opposition in what could otherwise be a civilised argument are not very well liked. Insulting is not the way to make someone understand something, if I do not understand then it's your duty as and elder to make the younger ones understand in a way that shows patience and control. You have done neither of those things, been rude to a complete stranger for no reason other than they have a differing view and have forever tainted the subject. For this I am sorry.

I hope you learn from this experience as I have; if you ever have kids then maybe you'll understand one day that anger and insult is not the way to help someone achieve understanding.

Please try and be a little more civil in the future, especially when debating about a topic both you and the opposition love so much..."

Eragon,fd4727m,t1_fd3mo3g,1578164950.0,"You are arguing with me about the cause of the accident. True names didn't hold any power before they were tied to magic, they were just ways of perfectly describing yourself. You have diverged from the actual argument. Since true names didn't hold any power, they couldn't have been the cause of the accident. You're now saying that there were two accidents. Could you please get your story straight so I can actually analyse it and reply; at the moment you have no argument because everytime you change your story I have to disregard everything you've previously said."

Eragon,fcnfdy0,t1_fcnebiy,1577810583.0,"Kinda, it was more like a great accident happened and to make sure it didn't happen again they *created* the Ancient Language. These guys are the original energy benders, the first magicians. They used magic without words for an untold number of years, the majority of such a learned race would not be afraid of their true names...

As for the FWW, I've only just started it but it's really good, I'm trying to savour it lol"
Eragon,fcndm6j,t1_fcl5vy0,1577809480.0,"Actually, I've just started the Fork, the Witch and the Worm. '' At times he dreamed of strapping in his sword, Brisingr, getting on Saphira, and setting out to see what adventure they could find. '' ""They couldn't leave the dragons or the Riders to fend for themselves, **not for a long while yet**. This implies that he will go on to leave his post. Canon. Right there.

It's actually canon that more than one of the Grey Folk survived the magical accident, and it certainly didn't involve true names as the Ancient Language hadn't even been created at that point. I do, however, like the the thermory that Angela is a member of the Grey Folk or maybe a descendant of one, which would explain her long lifespan and her reluctance to use magic.

As for the Elven Queen, she is not nearly as old as the oldest dragons. She had a purpose that she had not actually occupied for long - her mate was their leader until he was struck down by Galbatorix at the Battle of Ilirea. She had a purpose she maybe felt obligated to fill. She was old enough when she came to the post to be able to say that she had lived a long life doing as she pleased. Eragon can say no such thing, and this would drive him to spend some time doing what he loves: having adventures.

Vrail was not old nor powerful enough to attain a Godlike status, much like Oromis. We know this because his Dragon, Umaroth was still communicative to Eragon and was the spokesperson of the last Eldunarí, meaning that he would have to have good relations to both the younger and older dragons.

No wild jumps
Just deduction

Also, I thought it was interesting that the soothsayer that Galbatorix mentioned was at least part Grey Folk too, I think. What else is not human, elf, dwarf nor urgal?"

Eragon,fckpiwx,t1_fbqnw5z,1577730403.0,"Elves don't just die out - they dissappear from stories and the known world. It's called fading. We don't know of any elves specifically in the series, but surely you can't believe that the entirety of the elven race died of unnatural causes? Rhunön found something she's happy to devote eternity to, so she has a purpose to live, something binding her to the world. While Murtagh may not have been forgiven immediately, I believe that the truth would come out and be accepted as the truth by the masses, and even those who don't wouldn't pose a threat to him, especially if Nasuada and Murtagh were a couple, as he would technically be King and therefore have many security measures. As for the dragons, he would stay long enough to train a few generations of Riders - it's his duty. While there he would most definitely experiment and learn, don't forget that the remaining elves have much knowledge to give him, he's also got Galbatorix's library at his disposal. After finding out that the world is round and after meeting a literal God, he would probably want some answers, and in his quest for knowledge he would learn many things along the way, but there is only a limited amount of exploring you can do when you have duties, so he would eventually retire from them and leave them to the new Riders, and some of the older dragons would want to accompany him. I picture his kind eventually becoming like the minds of the oldest dragons, working in ways we don't quite understand..."
