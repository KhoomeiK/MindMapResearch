AskReddit,ffu66ny,t3_ev5gkp,1580235329.0,"I grew up Christian. My belief in god was that he was a magic man in the sky who watched over and guided us, created a heaven for us when we die, made rainbows to show he wouldnt flood the earth, and made babies.  


 But then I went to school and learned the sky is atmosphere and bundles of water vapor, beyond that is empty space that stretches for millions of miles before you see anything of note.   


I learned that our brains and nervous system run off of electrical and chemical signals which create our consciousness, and us as people completely cease to exist, and we become merely rotting flesh bags once our brain function stops.  


 I learned that rainbows are actually just light being refracted through water molecules in the sky..   


I learned that creatures possess DNA, and have the ability to reproduce with members of the opposite sex, and pass on their DNA, which contains the very instructions on how to form another creature.  


I learned that our bodies and so inefficient and terribly structured that we are lucky we can even function as well as we do.  


I learned that our bodily functions can just randomly decide to shut down, or our bodies can develop auto-immune diseases that makes it eat itself, and of cancers that no one can defend against.  


I learned that so many civilizations believed in so many gods, and were sure theirs was the right one.  


I learned that over thousands of years, armies of men traveled around slaughtering innocent people because they thought their god was the right one, and everyone else was an animal.  


I learned that innocent children are being enslaved, tortured, and raped on a daily basis all over the planet.  


There is no god"
