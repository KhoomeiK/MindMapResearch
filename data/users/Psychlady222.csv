getdisciplined,fet4wpx,t3_eqc3qd,1579371812.0,"Same here!! I realized my procrastination has that exact same purpose. 

From a psychological standpoint it is happening because your brain associates the stimuli with an anxious response. We want extinction in this case to occur. Is there a particular environment in which this happens most often? Where do you work on stuff?

I too get elevated heart rate when working on assignments for my graduate program (at one point it was 120 bpm). I highly recommend therapy as it will help rewire the neural pathways leading to the anxious response. 

Focus on accepting and sitting with the anxious response. Doing a little bit of work at a time (even just getting through a paragraph). Consider beta blockers. I also highly suggest working with a therapist trained in exposure therapy so she can help you learn to not be afraid of the anxiety, which kind of adds fuel to it. They may also suggest temporary anti-anxiety medication (optional).

Also for me personally in person therapy personally helps me a lot more than any other form. Typically you want to do online Skype/ phone session after you have been established with a clinician for awhile.

Honestly you should try to tell them everything on your mind. Vocalize you’re fears: “I am scared to speak in therapy because of X Reason”

socialwork,fdzzd8l,t3_ekmoqy,1578799418.0,"My therapist wants me to switch from being a full-time MSW student to part-time.

I have been seeing this therapist for 6 years. She has helped me immensely with my two clinical diagnoses, one of which is severe anxiety which I have been medicated and given therapy for. She recently gave me an ultimatum, that she would no longer be able to support me unless I dropped to part-time because she thinks I am suffering from too much stress and anxiety due to the program.

I'm not sure what to do. I see where she is coming from. It is not possible to relax during the semester and I am generally miserable but that is common with any grad school program. I am working towards being a mental health professional in this field.

Everyone in my life is against me going part-time and I have immense pressure to complete the program in 2 years. From a professional standpoint, would it be more ideal to complete this program in 2 years and just deal with the immense anxiety from completing this program, or would it be better to take my time?
