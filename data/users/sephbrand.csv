Male_Feet,fe9iadp,t3_eo2z81,1578937788.0,You have the most beautiful feet I've ever seen on this sub. Love them!
MrRobot,fe9fn5d,t1_fe8n7xe,1578937136.0,I didn't know that. It's a pity if she left Mr Robot to accept other job offers
MrRobot,fe80aq1,t1_fe7rbji,1578921002.0,">When Elliot feels like she can him talking to us and can see Mr Robot it gives me goosebumps everytime.

Yes! The dynamic between them was absolutely genius. I expected that scene with her talking in Danish to him to have some pay off though"
MrRobot,fe6gexy,t3_enuh50,1578890117.0,I missed her in the last season. She was such an interesting character

MandelaEffect,fe2riu5,t1_fe1s43v,1578842036.0,"I second you. Lot of people come here craving to share their experiences and make some sense but all they find is other people discouraging them and calling them crazy. I think people on this sub should be more open-minded and less negative towards others experiences, otherwise why are they here in the first place?"
MandelaEffect,fe2pz29,t1_fe13ic9,1578841643.0,"Now this is a quite good explanation. Maybe we don't feel things off because this is our timeline, but OP and his wife could be from another timeline in which things went truly bad"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,fe2lr1i,t1_fe1gpmb,1578840125.0,"This is creepy, in a fascinating way, though. The fact that the photo has a coloured frame is also weird, I mean it looks like it's a photo of an old photo which would mean someone took this photograph recently, now the question is who was that person and why did he/she take this photo and post it on OP's Facebook? Now I'm truly intrigued."

PrequelMemes,fdw8fom,t3_en61pf,1578756144.0,"""It's universally agreed"". These people are really bigots trying to diminish other people's opinions"
PrequelMemes,fdtfr9j,t1_fdt2jcg,1578716118.0,"I knew it. Your ""critique"" about the prequels is not objectively based on artistic or technical factors. Your opinion is biased by the mindset that a film is meant to just be ""entertaining"" and has to have lots of flashy VFX on it to be good. Objectively, there are no character development nor good arcs in those movies, the pacing is horrible, and the exposition is poor, which means the writing sucks. In terms of creativity, they don't do anything new or ""risky"", for they are just appealing to the casual movie-goer who only likes to have a good time without having to think too much about what he is watching. The Disney Trilogy doesn't contain any evocative or revolutionary ideas, they are just fanfics poorly crafted which only invite the viewer to consume and not question what he is watching. Saying that these movies —which are clearly ""worse"" than the prequels— are good just takes away all your credibility, so go back to your reylo fanfics and let us enjoy what we love and don't come here pretending you're better than all of us for not liking the prequels"
PrequelMemes,fdt15v4,t1_fdsyk7s,1578710573.0,"I noticed you mentioned the word ""filmmaking"" and mentioned some elements of storytelling, so I'm a little curious: what's your standpoint on the sequels?"
PrequelMemes,fdszwlh,t1_fdsutki,1578710114.0,"Dude, I've been watching the making of videos and I'm utterly amazed about how many craft and art the creation of these films implied. The whole team was so passionate that they put attention to every tiny detail without any fear of reinventing the film-making process in the matter of special effects.  George Lucas is just a visionary and a risk-taker who truly believe in what he does.  Hollywood has always pushed an agenda in trying to make GL and the prequels look bad because they are people with zero creativity or imagination who feel intimidated by him, and yet most of their stupid movies owe the prequels a lot of their technicals."
PrequelMemes,fdsvm7z,t1_fdsojgx,1578708518.0,"They came to that ""realisation"" because they were previously influenced to think that. When I watched these films the internet wasn't a thing yet and I never thought there was so much hate for these films that I loved so much. That fact didn't change my opinion over time, even though it is an unpopular opinion, for I have a conviction for the things I love and for the things in which I believe. You said, ""they aren't good movies"" as if you are the owner of the objective truth, assuming other people's opinions about these subject are invalid or less true than your ""truth"" whereas your ""truth"" is only true for you because it is indeed an opinion. The fact that you changed your mind shows how easily you can exchange your opinions about things, not by external influences but because of a lack of conviction and confidence about your own opinions."
PrequelMemes,fdsqf3c,t1_fdslwfk,1578706603.0,"That sounds familiar. I'm wondering if Rey wasn't a Zoomer. Don't get me wrong, I love Zoomers, they are super cool, but sometimes it feels like they are just taking the things we had to fight for"
PrequelMemes,fdspk9l,t1_fdsklmm,1578706288.0,"In terms of storytelling, the prequels did a great job by setting up all the necessary story arcs in the first two films and wrapping everything up in the last. RoTS was the perfect denouement for the trilogy. I can't say that about the sequels"
PrequelMemes,fdsoho8,t1_fdsjrng,1578705901.0,"A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one"
PrequelMemes,fdsnmmh,t1_fdslhv0,1578705565.0,"And that's clearly thanks to the internet, the pseudo-critics, and mass media. Most of the people just repeat what they are told and are not interested in forming their own opinions."
PrequelMemes,fdsi1f3,t1_fdsenwb,1578703135.0,"Those were good times, when you could enjoy something without the prejudices of what other people were saying on the Internet. I remember that my feeling after watching the film was one of pure joy, despite the tragedy at the end of it. And Anakin getting his mask is one of the scenes I clearly remember. It was terrific. I like the 6 movies, but my favourites will always be the prequels besides they are not perfect"
PrequelMemes,fdsh8dp,t1_fdsb25e,1578702698.0,"Yeah, actually, the part that made me happy was seeing that the prequels are finally getting the attention they deserve, the article is dumb, though"
PrequelMemes,fdsgzrq,t1_fdsbf41,1578702558.0,"Dude, I don't understand why people say AoTC is the worst SW movie, I mean the romance part is cheesy but that is just like 20% of the movie, the rest is the Obi-wan's adventure in Kamino and the battle of Geonosis which IMO is the more epic battle in all SW"
PrequelMemes,fdsg74l,t1_fdsf1zo,1578702074.0,"I've felt like a vocal minority all my life trying to convince other people that they have great things, just like the OT. None of these movies are perfect, but you can see that they were made with a vision in mind and great passion"
PrequelMemes,fdsfhqe,t1_fdsemlv,1578701567.0,"I'm a proud George Lucas love child. I never said the prequels are perfect but they have a great and original vision that Lucas stand for in spite of pathetic people like you who cannot feel authentic joy for anything more than hating what other people love. Yes, that's the only thing you do, ruining other people's fun and that's a pity, for you'll never create anything remotely valuable in your life. The almighty Lucas has more talent in one single hair than you have in your whole body, mate"

PrequelMemes,fdrhhqf,t1_fdrfu4x,1578684573.0,"Yeah, they also say it as if it's wrong to like the prequels, but I guess it's a good thing these are gaining more recognition"
