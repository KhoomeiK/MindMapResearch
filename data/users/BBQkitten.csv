changemyview,fe80z3s,t1_fe6mbju,1578921153.0,"This wouldn't be just *culture*. Babies growing up in very stressful situations end up with high loads of stress experience specific synaptic pruning, that is called ""stress brain"".    This can be, and is very often, permanent. This will affect relationships, behaviour, cognitive ability, impulse control etc.  This is not too say that it makes babies dumb, there are very smart people who grew up in war torn countries, abusive families. But it does irrevocably change how their brain works, detrimentally."
