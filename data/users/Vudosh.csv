SWGalaxyOfHeroes,ffdskn7,t1_ffdse4t,1579827862.0,I’m really out relic’d as well and I’m beating full R7 squads. You need your GAS dealing high damage rather than standing up for longer(personal opinion) as soon as you kill GK it’s normally over
SWGalaxyOfHeroes,ffds5l0,t1_ffdrz8j,1579827580.0,I’ve faced GAS a few times now. With my Padme team. It’s the ones dealing huge damage that make me lose not heavy protection

facepalm,ffcxafb,t1_ffcw90x,1579809193.0,"Lol what I said and what he said are exactly the same meaning you’re just being a pedantic arse.

And I didn’t know I could quote on my phone otherwise I would’ve quoted what I put in punctuation marks because shock it literally means the same thing.
