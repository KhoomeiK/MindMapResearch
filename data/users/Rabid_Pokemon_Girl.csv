AskReddit,ff43ich,t3_erc1ft,1579554740.0,"My ex boyfriend was like this. I was always supportive and listened, gave my word here and there since I see a therapist and psychologist for my depression and anxiety. (I'm doing much better). 

I tried to tell him that I can't give him the answers and help he needs, his coping mechanisms are not that healthy, and I believe he should see someone like a councilor that could help more than me. 

I was as polite and honest as I could, but I never pressured him. I only gave it as my worried opinion about his mental state and mentioned the councilor whenever he would talk to me about something I couldn't understand emotionally or mentally. 

You should suggest it as well as you can, but ***do not ever*** *pressure* someone into it. It could make them not go at all or even think of it. 

In the end, it is their choice if they seek help and it isn't healthy to pressure them into it. The way I see it, pressuring someone about this subject (cause it can be touchy for a few) will only make them resist and may feel hurt. Remind them you are there, but be truthful that you feel hurt by not being able to help in a way a doctor can. 

I wish you luck. Depression sucks"

WritingPrompts,fdsen81,t3_emz892,1578700959.0,"I sleep on my hammock peacefully, imagining this vacation would be better with a smoothie from my favorite Korean cafe. When I start to hear Mrs. Chun yelling at me again, I open my eyes to see her standing over me and glaring. 

""You need to control yourself!"" She shouts. 

""Sorry!"" I say hurriedly. I pat for my wallet and sigh sadly. I thought since I am here I may as well have my smoothie. 

""Your usual?"" Asks Vicky. I nod with a comical pout. Rolling her eyes, Vicky smiles. ""Pay me back when you can.""

Within fifteen minutes, I sit back on my hammock and yawn, sipping the honeydew smoothie contently. Then, I sneezed. I stand in the center of Times Square in my bikini, with my drink, with the world staring at me. 

""Ugh."" I think back to my vacation and return there, determined to stay put. Though, it is hard when you are imagining what the world in ""Lord of the Rings"" looks like. 

With another sneeze, I appear in Bilbo Baggins' house, his face bewildered just as Gandalf appears at the door. Cursing, I teleport back to the beach only to see Loki eating my fruit platter. 

""Having troubles, friend?"" He asked coyly. 

""I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP!!!"" I scream."

Of course, the zombies do not understand, so they fall into the tiger trap and shriek as they die for the final time. I wag my tail happily, knowing I did what I know is right and didn't care if I got hurt. We are safe to have another meal and sleep with a cozy fire. 

Turning around, I bound after my family and lick their faces until they are wet and laughing, holding me close and telling me what a good boy I am.

Also, have rules and talk to the players about your game rules: homebrew race/classes/background (yes or no), switching characters in the middle of the campaign, and sometimes how long a backstory is for a character. Those are just examples of what you can talk to them about if you have those concerns.
