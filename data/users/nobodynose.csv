I got one recently and they come every now and then.  Not very often but when they come they have a ton of things."
YangForPresidentHQ,ffz8mlk,t1_ffyygsj,1580367402.0,It was just released today!
KeanuBeingAwesome,ffy8d3u,t1_ffxnj4l,1580340549.0,I would think they would have to come in sometimes to renew their license because the picture on the license needs updating.  You can look pretty different 15 years later.
YangForPresidentHQ,ffy7glr,t1_ffxj2i2,1580340040.0,"My coworker who I've been talking about Yang with constantly told me that he was probably going to vote for Warren or Biden because Bernie was too left and he thought the US was too racist for Yang.

I mentioned it to him again not too long ago and he admitted he donated to Yang."
Advice,ffxb35f,t1_ffx8gsa,1580321503.0,"There's no way someone will ""set this up"" in order to trap you unless you have some serious problems with trust and you have been constantly bothering her by accusing her of cheating and snooping through her stuff.  

If you haven't accused her of cheating in the past and haven't been snooping through her stuff in the past, she's cheating on you. That's a really terrible excuse because no one ""sets it up"" without a good reason to want to set it up.  Break up with her unless you've given her a great reason why she would think you're going to snoop on her.

Otherwise, you got to get your shit together.  If you can't trust someone who has given you no indications not to trust them, then there's some issues you need to deal with.  You might need to see a therapist to get over the issues.  Honestly if you treat your SO as if she was cheating on you all the time, it can be self fulfilling.  ""Wtf, he's constantly accusing me of cheating?  FINE I'LL CHEAT BECAUSE HE THINKS I AM ANYWAYS!"""
