Especially this one! It's awesome!"
asexuality,fe1d83i,t3_enls9l,1578825201.0,"I know how you feel. I tried to date a guy who knew I was ace but I suspect that he didn't really understand it at all (i broke up with him). However, my current boyfriend knows that I probably am ace and 100% supports it and constantly reminds me. It really is amazing to have someone that understands you."

offmychest,fdmwivl,t3_ekok81,1578569052.0,"My mother also has bipolar disorder, in my experience arguing back or talking to her about issues has always resulted in childish, selfish and delusional reactions. So I just let her yell until she tires herself out or gets bored.

If your mother isn't on medication, maybe talk to her about it when she's in a good mood. If she is on medication maybe talk tell her that it might be time to increase it.(I am in no way qualified to give advice for medication)

Please stay safe, I know this isn't an easy thing to deal with."

offmychest,fcauqcx,t3_egt2z1,1577576994.0,So true.
offmychest,fcauin0,t1_fc8kauq,1577576873.0,"You are right, I just have to wait a year until I'm old enough to leave. I just want to get out of this situation, it's so draining. Glad you got out though."
offmychest,fc8i0qx,t1_fc8gxaa,1577535342.0,"I know what you mean by the holidays starting to feel so fake after a certain age, (I'm also 17) and I think the older we get the more aware we are of it, and maybe the older my parents get the less they seem to care. I hope next year is better for you too. 

Hang in there!"
offmychest,fc8hcsi,t3_egonzt,1577534929.0,"That's such a terrible situation to be in, I've also been sexually assualted by my own mother, so I can relate.

Seriously though, I hope all victims everywhere, are supported. It's super important."

Good Luck with that haha."

But there are many more people in the world who are."
