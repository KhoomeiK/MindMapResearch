modeltrains,ffbff4m,t1_ffak80y,1579762926.0,"Same. My son loves trains. But it helps that we have a miniature railway in the local park and a preservation line about half hour drive away. 

Yeah i wouldnt have had this as a kid either. But even if my family could have afforded it it would have no where to go"
modeltrains,ffbf3qn,t1_ffax45l,1579762553.0,All of it is hornby track. The outside is r609s and the inside 607s if that makes any sense
modeltrains,ff9x05c,t1_ff9sovk,1579723339.0,Honestly soldering is easy. I found its better to have a gas soldering iron when your doing small fiddley jobs so the electric cable doesnt get in the way
modeltrains,ff9v76m,t1_ff9usei,1579722193.0,Just DC. If i want to make them DCC i will have to hard wire the chips into them. And i think id be to scared of breaking them to do that just yet
modeltrains,ff9ub52,t1_ff9sn4j,1579721498.0,Completely forgot bachmann did building's as well as the Thomas trains. Little one has been asking for spencer since he got this layout. Bit gutted as gordon is my favourite
modeltrains,ff9u86s,t1_ff9ta64,1579721433.0,It is yes. I tried setting it up earlier and i just couldnt get them to fit the track. I will try again when i get somemore time
modeltrains,ff9tmqn,t1_ff9sjdl,1579721004.0,"Its aprox 4ft by 6ft. And it just sits on the sofa bed when he wants to play with it. I had to change the plans a little as i originally had the siding that crosses over on the outside and it was too wide for the board.

And i wanted to give him a decent layout otherwise he'd just get board of a simple oval"
modeltrains,ff9sn4j,t3_esgdfj,1579720367.0,"Inside and outside loop are independent so can run two trains at a time. 

Now just need to add some things to it for him to play. Any suggestions?"
AdviceAnimals,ff8okw6,t1_ff8kth9,1579689074.0,You're right its not free. I pay tax and national insurance. Which funds the NHS. The NHS isnt perfect and some treatments just aren't available on it. But give me the NHS over the US health care system any day
FantasyPL,ff5kafj,t3_ernb3z,1579596930.0,I started out brilliant. First few weeks i was top on the league. Then had a fucking awful run of games and dropped to second bottom. Dragged my way back to second. Cut down 1st from a 200 lead to now just 30. Hopfully will retake 1st this GW
worldnews,ff456pk,t3_erdr1j,1579555786.0,And while i was in the British army for 10+ years we used to train at invading russia alongside NATO allies. And the Russians used to train at invading Europe at the same time just across the border. Its the norm

modeltrains,fe0vuaz,t3_ena5ak,1578819241.0,"So ive played warhammer 40k and fantasy. You can spend upwards to Â£1000 just building your army buying the main rule book and then your armys codex (its own personal rules) you also then want to find someone to play with which means either joining a gaming club or going to the local games workshop. Which in the UK isnt an issue but US is a bit of a task. 

At least with a railroad you dont need rule books or a club to join. But it can be just as expensive. I enjoy both and would still play warhammer if i had time but then i decided to have children so spare time went out the window."
britishproblems,fduh54b,t1_fdrb3no,1578732902.0,"That is true. But most smart motorways are 4 lanes. And id like to think you would know thats a motorway. Im talking about places like Doncaster bypass which is a glorified A road but with motorway rules. 

I also hate smart motorways they cause more traffic than they help as far as im concerned"

britishproblems,fdpyynt,t1_fdpxio0,1578646649.0,I drove past a police bike once at 70. He proceeded to blue light me. Pull me over and bollock me for speeding in my van. I was on the A1(M) i argued that on a motorway i can do 70. He argued it was a A road and i should only do 60. He let me off with a warning. More like he realised he'd cocked up

britishproblems,fdhr2dm,t3_elanrx,1578428501.0,1 million people cutting down on eating meat is much much better for the environment than 100k full vegans. Guilt tripping people and shouting abuse at people wont bring them to your cause and the sooner the radical vegans realise that the better

britishproblems,fdhmwcp,t1_fdhk1dp,1578426027.0,HS2 should relieve some pressure on the ECML and WCML so better services should be able to run on them once the congestion has eased up. But for it to be fully effective it really should be extended all the way to Edinburgh on the east cost and Glasgow on the west coast. Otherwise everything north of Birmingham will still be shite

She hated it because to her it ment having to change the bedding before we could go to sleep. I on the other hand was quite chuffed with myself.
