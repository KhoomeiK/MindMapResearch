AskReddit,fehrkw2,t1_fdio0u2,1579122474.0,"That counts, sure. I thought of my own experience and what cost a lot but was worth every penny was saving my two cats who I adopted with a fungal disease called Cryptococcus. Most cats usually die from it. I didn't know they had it when I adopted them. It cost thousands of dollars to save their lives. One of them went permanently blind because of it and she was the most amazing creature to ever grace my life. They both were. They're both gone now, after going on to live happy lives post cryptococcus. It was the best money I ever spent. They brought so much love and joy to my life. But you're right. Many people think pets are there for their pleasure alone and that they don't come down with issues just like humans. I also adopted a diabetic cat just to rescue her from a life in a cage. She cost thousands too though it was more spread out over the 10 years she was with me. Worth every single penny and insulin needle."

The biscuits we make here are buttery sweet heaven and simply adding a sausage gravy just takes it to the next level. omg! It's amazing. You can't even compare it to a scone with jam because they're so completely different from each other. One is a meal, the other is dessert."

cats,fdnj1pw,t3_ema20o,1578586841.0,I had a cat that had her eye removed. Max will be fine...better even! I could tell once the eye healed my cat Pandora felt so much better. She was 15 at the time and when her eye socket was all healed it was like she had that spark of youth again! Good luck Max!

Every living being knows when it's home has been compromised. There's no way they don't know. Swimming from predators is part of their life and it's just the natural order of things. You're not really doing some noble act. You're simply justifying kidnapping so you can make a living without guilt. Hey, do what you gotta do. But don't pretend you're rescuing these fish. I'd be much happier for a fish living it's natural life with the threat of predators over a fake environment with no stimulation or purpose while being entertainment for humans."
cats,fcxm4m6,t3_ej8yr4,1578066240.0,One of my cats went through the same thing. I think I was more worried about it than she was. Once everything was done and she was healing she seemed to feel much better. Can't be comfortable having a bad eyeball. I wish him all the best!! He's adorable.
