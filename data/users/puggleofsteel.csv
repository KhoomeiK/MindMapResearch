writing,ff8pop4,t1_ff8kwjb,1579690705.0,"I agree that this kind of inaccessibility can happen, but despite what some (looking at the literary snobs) may think, that doesn't make it good. Quite the opposite IMO. I'm sure that kind of thing is out there, but no one's buying it; not the publishers, because they want to make money, and not the readers who might buy self-subbed work because they haven't yet learned to be that kind of pretentious, bless them."
writing,ff4xr7w,t1_ff3l44l,1579574988.0,I didn't say anything about literary books (YA or otherwise) being inaccessible. Genuinely curious if that's your measure of literary quality.
writing,fevhbgs,t1_femo7op,1579397437.0,"I'm some cases, sure, just like commercial fiction for adults. But there are wonderful, lyrical YA books that are beautifully written and explore complex issues and characters out there too, they just don't get as much attention, just like in adult fiction."
writing,fem97ef,t1_fek9fhu,1579244421.0,"Saying ""even YA"" demonstrates another common form of literary snobbery that goes on a lot. YA is a marketing demographic that encompasses all the other genres, and contains many titles with strong literary merit. I'm not saying you meant it that way, but there are plenty of people who see it as lesser just because it's written for young people."

wholesomememes,fcx658u,t1_fcwynf9,1578052831.0,Me too. I'm back home in Australia visiting family right now and I can smell the smoke outside. This got me right in the feels.
Norway,fb9sepg,t1_fb8c2rb,1576648134.0,"As an Australian who has lived through 14 Norwegian winters, I agree with your strong disagree. As pretty as the snow is when it comes, I hate all the layering, the black ice that broke my tailbone, the darkness, and how hard it is to get the energy to ever do anything. 

I'm heading back to Aus for three weeks in January, and I can't freaking wait."
