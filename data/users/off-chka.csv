AskReddit,ffje7l3,t1_ffipos3,1579996394.0,What’s his name? Googling the story didn’t help.
AskReddit,ffjdje7,t1_ffil3s2,1579996008.0,"That’s a mean thing to say. Addiction is a horrible, horrible thing and trust me, no one enjoys being addicted to drugs. It might not be the boyfriend’s responsibility to help her, but saying she doesn’t wanna be saved is terrible."
UnresolvedMysteries,ffhj27x,t1_ffgmt4y,1579937506.0,"You’re making very big accusations. Yes people can have a bad reaction to weed, but u less you’re obviously dying, people just let the high wear off. It says the stepmom slept in her room to make sure she was ok. I’ve done that with my drunk sister multiple times (nor an alcoholic, just too social). I don’t take her to the hospital every time she comes home drunk and pale. And I have actually told her multiple times “next time I’m going to videotape you so you see how stupid you look,” but I’ve never actually done it."
UnresolvedMysteries,ffhhc0w,t1_ffgr3x3,1579935254.0,They are being accused of murder or covering up their daughter’s OD. So obviously they’re not happy about it
UnresolvedMysteries,ffhgosg,t1_ffhal71,1579934460.0,"Who’s the source of that comment? Though it might mean something, it also sounds a little dramatized."

insaneparents,ff2gl09,t3_er0jyt,1579505234.0,"I’d normally say the grandpa already got the worst punishment and it was an accident, so he shouldn’t go to jail. But this family insanely trying to blame it on the ship and make profit is disgusting and makes me want to see them punished for ending the poor child’s life."
MadeMeSmile,fex7819,t3_eq3vnx,1579425826.0,"Even before he opened it, he was so genuinely surprised and flattered when they gave him a gift. What a nice man, and what amazing teenagers."
todayilearned,fex675t,t3_eqhx5n,1579425165.0,"When I was very young, my mom took the trash out and the door locked behind her. We lived on the second floor of an apartment building. And while my mom was knocking on a neighbor’s door to use their phone to call my dad at work, our other neighbor (who was a burglar, per the neighborhood gossip), told my mom not to worry and he could climb into our apartment through the balcony. Which he did."
Cringetopia,feumvfi,t1_fer5zzs,1579388020.0,"So if it’s not a dog or a cat or a bee, it’s fine to grill them? Yes, this post is stupid and not really helping anyone, but the fact that we still murder and eat animals in the 21st century is truly baffling."

gifs,feg387a,t1_feewuzk,1579074946.0,"No offense, but i’s about 3 gestures which he could’ve learned a minute or two. So him doing this while wavering like he’s solving some astrophysics problem isn’t that admirable. Nice thought though."
AskReddit,feck1ag,t1_fecf29n,1578975800.0,"With his 10 years of med school there was nothing medical related he could do to at least cover his debt faster? I understand medicine wasn’t for him, but I wouldn’t think 7/11 is, is ir?"
TwoSentenceHorror,fe6pitx,t1_fe6olo5,1578899423.0,"I think the “I”, the narrator, is the unborn baby in the womb. So he tries everything he can to tell his mom about the killer, but all he can really do is kick, and the mom finds it adorable 

However, the unborn baby is always in the mom’s belly. So how could he have heard something that the mom didn’t?"
sports,fe6kfai,t3_enwxrj,1578893819.0,This is so wholesome. Thanks for posting.
todayilearned,fe6k8u4,t1_fe617lv,1578893640.0,"It was definitely on purpose to get more readers. I thought deaths as well.

Edit: it also says the man survived, implying he survived the crash, but in reality he left his car before the crash. Freaking internet points, man."

todayilearned,fduy14y,t1_fdutt56,1578740838.0,"But you don’t think it’s AMAZING advertising for the artist when youtube can make their song reachable to billions of people? Millions of people become fans when they see/hear music on youtube, which is how those artists make money. So looks like a win win situation for everyone involved."
todayilearned,fdtjrqd,t1_fdtibt9,1578717769.0,Nothing in my reply painted anyone as the victim. But cool
todayilearned,fdti6r1,t3_en07vr,1578717109.0,"I wouldn’t paint Youtube as the evil. Youtube is not the artists’ employer, so you can’t demand fair wages. Youtube is a platform where musicians get to make extra money, and youtube takes a portion of it."

AskReddit,fdjfku8,t1_fdgxcw0,1578468684.0,"I had a coworker that would eat with her mouth widely open (educated, 24-26 year old young woman, not some weirdo), and I kid you not, you could hear her spit hitting her teeth and that moist saliva/food combo moving in her mouth. I always put headphones when when it was her lunchtime (she ate at her desk)."
