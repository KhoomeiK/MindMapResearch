> The OK Cupid founder is referring to the findings of the OK Cupid survey which found that women rated only 20% of men's profiles as attractive.

> I have no doubt that most women find only 20% men physically attractive

This oft-quoted statistic means a LOT less than it seems, due to another gender difference that isn't mentioned.

Men apply a numeric scale to women's attractiveness because there is a broad consensus about what it means to be a conventionally attractive woman.  (Those of us who have an eccentric scale are well aware that our standards are not widely shared among other men.)

There is NO such consensus about the attractiveness of men, as seen by women.  Women's view of men's attractiveness is highly individual and idiosyncratic.

Many men imagine that there must be such a consensus, that they themselves can be rated on the same numeric scale, but that is really meaningless.

Two random women could both say, ""I'm only interested in the 20% most attractive men,"" and be referring to COMPLETELY non-overlapping sets of men.

Two random men who speak of the ""20% most attractive women"" are speaking of mostly the same women.  Maybe not an identical group, from different men's standpoints, but with substantial overlap."

dataisbeautiful,fcwdpeu,t3_ej999q,1578023034.0,"(2) Brief analysis:

It is understood among election specialists that ballot layout can make a difference to the results.  Specifically, the candidate listed first gains more votes, just from having his or her name ahead of the others.  To ameliorate this, in many jurisdictions, candidate names are rotated, so as to spread around and equalize that benefit among all the candidates.

This data shows why ballot rotation is important.  Had the candidates been listed in a fixed order, the outcome could well have been different.

Nine of the ten candidates got more votes when listed first than when listed second.  In general, from 1st  to 8th place, the lower the listing, the lower the percentage of votes.

Being last, or second-to-last, apparently offers a little bit of prominence.  It appears that the WORST place to be is third from last in a list of ten names..  

This is the type if race where ballot order would be expected to play the greatest role.

* It's nonpartisan, so voters couldn't just use party labels to pick out candidates.

* It's a long list of names, and probably very few voters were familiar with all of them 

* In the context of a presidential election, the race for community college trustee gets very little attention.

Probably few voters showed up at the polls knowing in advance which two people they planned to vote for in this race.  Presumably, each voter read down the list of names, starting with the first, and chose to vote or not vote for each candidate.  Once they had distributed their two votes, the rest of the list was irrelevant.

Washtenaw County (county seat: Ann Arbor) is one of the nation's most highly educated counties.  This demonstrates that ballot order effects happen even in a relatively sophisticated electorate."
dataisbeautiful,fcwbhrh,t3_ej999q,1578021563.0,"(1) Data source and explanation:

These graphs reflect the votes cast for 10 candidates for community college trustee in Washtenaw County, Michigan, at the November 8, 2016 election.  The raw data of votes for each candidate in each precinct is here: https://electionresults.ewashtenaw.org/electionreporting/nov2016/canvassreport543.html 

In Michigan nonpartisan races and primaries, the list of candidates is displayed on the ballot in alphabetical order in the first precinct.  For each successive precinct, the top name shifts to the bottom.  So if there are four candidates, they would be listed ABCD in the first precinct, BCDA in the second precinct, CDAB in the third precinct, and so on.

So in this case, in a 10-way race for trustee, the first candidate alphabetically (Casey), was listed first on the ballot in every 10th precinct, which is to say, the first, the eleventh, the 21st, etc.  He was listed second in the second precinct, the 12th, the 22nd, etc.  And so on for all the candidates.

Using Excel, I dis-aggregated the precincts into the ten rotations of names for community college trustee, and calculated for each candidate the percentage of the votes in each of those ten sets of precincts.  Each of the sets of precincts had around 20,000 votes.
