AskReddit,ffgg9yi,t1_fffn53s,1579905560.0,"I came here to say this. 

Also, the other branch of suicides from men I think are ones that are in the military. They feel like they can't escape and don't have an out and that the only way to be ""out"" is to kill themselves. It's sad, but I read a lot about how new recruits especially are the most at risk because it's not what they thought and they literally can't talk to anyone about how they're feeling without having some kind of stigma attached to them.

I feel like if there was a way to implement a therapy program at military bases for those in active duty, it would be really helpful. Everyone would be required to do an hour two days a week, that way that one person doesn't have to worry about being labeled negatively."

dating,ffay6vv,t1_ffaqpjz,1579747231.0,"I’ve had it happen a couple times too. 

A particular instance: I matched with a sophomore (I’m a senior in college). I asked her for her number and snapchat. She gave it to me immediately. We talked and stuff. I asked her to “verify” it’s her on Snapchat and she did no problem. I did the same. I asked her if she wanted to meet and just walk around on campus and talk and she said “Yes!”... We set a place and time on a Friday or something and before I leave, I randomly check my Snapchat and her story. I find out she’s not even in town. 

Her excuse “I had a family emergency and I had to go back home.” I said “Uh huh. Ok”. Then she, herself, asked for a different time and stuff and I decide to give her the benefit of the doubt.

However, I tell her that now we should just meet in the parking lot of my residence campus apartment and she says “ok, that works”.. (I was thinking she was gonna stand me up again so I didn’t want to waste energy going anywhere then having to walk back). 

And guess what happens? She doesn’t show up. So I remove her from Snapchat and a couple hours later, she has the balls to re-add me, but I don’t allow it. She sent me a text saying “hey?” before I blocked her. 

I was in the correct place and she knew where it was but didn’t show up."

AskReddit,ff6sp58,t1_ff6bsct,1579634080.0,"I remember this weird massage show I watched on Netflix cause I was bored. It was super cringey...

Anyways, a line from that show came to when you asked that question.... I’ll have to paraphrase it cause I don’t remember it word-for-word. 

“Never offer clients happy endings. You have to wait for them to ask for it.” 

I think it had something to do with deniability in case they get in trouble with the law... 

They need to be able to have proof and say “The client asked for the happy ending, we didn’t offer.” 

Cause if they offered, then suddenly they’re not a massage place, but a prostitution service and prostitution is illegal. 

Tl:DR - Watched a weird massage show on Netflix. Biggest thing I learned is that massage places will never offer you happy endings because offering is against the law and it removes deniability immediately."

I always encourage those who want to save themselves for marriage, to at least explore a little bit with the right person (or people) to understand what is normal and what you like or don’t like. 

You don’t have to have sex often... But having done it once or twice with someone you trust will put you in a far better position for when you marry and you will have an easier time identifying abusive partners and stuff like that.

family,fdoh2nq,t3_emf5x9,1578605004.0,"I don't mean to bash your mom, but it sounds like she's trying to take advantage of your dad's death to come into whatever money is left.

It was her decision to destroy the relationship over money. This shows her true character, someone who is selfish.

If you appease her, you have to be prepared to only ever see that $7k and nothing else until she's dead, if there is any left. However, if you take it, then there will be some very rough waters ahead and comments like ""Don't you love me?"" or other snide guilt tripping comments like that.

My gut reaction is that your mom re-married your dad after she found out (if he told her) that he was going to die soon and just wanted an easy-in for money. Of course, I don't know the whole story and I realize how insensitive my comment is -- I don't really know how else to phrase it at the moment.

I'm thinking while your dad did actually love her, if he told her was dying very soon, then maybe she figured she could just take advantage of him and try to get that money.

Don't let her get it. It's not hers. It is yours and your siblings. She has zero right to it."

I felt like I was watching from someone else's point of view and that I was just along for the ride. It's bits and pieces really, but the feelings remained very clearly. 

I remember the feeling of losing someone you relied on. Then, when it registers, the shaking and the tears and the bottomless pit that makes you feel nauseous to where you feel sick. The exhaustion from crying. Laying in bed and not having the strength to go on your day without the person you love next to you. The weakness in your body when you realize you're alone, again. Not having anything or anyone to hold onto until you hit rock bottom.

It's one of the worst feelings I've experienced when I woke up. I was like ""holy fucking shit"".
