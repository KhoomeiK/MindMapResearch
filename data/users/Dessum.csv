internetparents,fgc0h1z,t3_exb5ct,1580667810.0,"I know I'm not the only one to say this, but I've literally never heard of anyone doing an ""at-home dissection."" Are you supposed to just go find a dead animal, or kill one? Do they provide you the dead animal? 

Honestly I think just the fact that it raises those questions is enough reason to object even without the answers to them. I know I'm not really providing much of an alternate solution, but at least know that you're not alone in your thinking - we're looking at this and going ""what the fuck?"" as well!"

space,fftzd9x,t1_fftexwg,1580231042.0,"So we all say ""your anus,"" right? Like, that's how we pronounce it?

In 8th grade, my teacher tried telling us it's ""YER-ann-iss,"" not ""your-AYY-nus."" I always thought it was just to get us to stop saying ""anus,"" though we immediately turned to ""urine-us"" and ""you're-in-us.""

Regardless, the name ""Uranós"" looks like it could be ""YER-ann-oss,"" and I was just curious if anyone knew what I'm actually supposed to call this goddamn thing."
DestinyTheGame,ffsg10e,t1_ffrgdyn,1580180805.0,"From my layman's perspective, Destiny's season pass more closely resembling ""bad"" systems rather than ""good"" systems seems to be an indicator that they went with money over user experience."
DestinyTheGame,ffqr4vj,t3_eufgqj,1580141715.0,"It kind of hurts looking at all of the sweet-ass ghost shells this season and knowing I can't have any unless I shell out more money. I have 700 Silver left that I'm just sitting on and I won't be buying more. 

I keep comparing this to Warframe, and I don't know if that pisses people off but I feel they have an astronomically better system. Platinum can be directly purchased, but it can also be traded for. You earn items to craft, mods, pet blueprints, etc. You can trade those and there is a player-run market for it all. They also have a random login bonus, which usually gives a few random items that doesn't affect much but will occasionally grant coupons for Platinum up to 75% off. 

I realize there's no trading system in Destiny, so this doesn't apply, but my point is that they built this system into their game to be supported by other systems already in their game. There isn't a separate store entity with a separate economy, the economy is part of the game.

Warframe and Destiny are very different games, but my point is that this can be figured out. It just takes effort and planning, which cost money and time. It's much easier to just follow the graphs and price things for whales."

todayilearned,ffnhm0w,t1_ffk1axb,1580066094.0,"While I love all of the artists I listen to daily, this won't change without action on their part. At the end of the day, who is going to make a change? Are we going to opt to pay more? Is Spotify going to have a change of heart and start paying more money per play? No, because we are the spenders and are trying to spend as little as we can while still getting the best benefit. 

If artists want to make more money, they need to come up with the way. Things like Taylor Swift taking action against Spotify or new competitive streaming services like Tidal are good ideas, just not as impactful in practice as one would hope. 

They have the supply, we have the demand. If they want more money, they have to come up with the solution. 

Of course, all of my music/industry knowledge is backed purely by observation and the same ECON101 everyone else takes, so as always take this with a reddit-sized grain of salt."

I actually didn't even know he wasn't really retiring until I read this post, so I'm one of those clickbait fools. I still hold to my post though, I hope his happiness is sincere."
pcmasterrace,ffhw2bb,t1_ffhgo81,1579956512.0,"Yeah as much as I want to keep watching these videos that make me happy, I really hope he's truly happy. Feeling like you're being forced into one thing and that's all you can do is draining in every sense of the word. 

The world is topsy-turvy and I just want good things to stay in my life. Star Wars is bad now, Destiny isn't doing so hot, Pokemon is getting worse and worse, my job is exhausting and don't even get me started on politics. I think I speak for everyone when I say I just really don't want to see Linus go for that entirely selfish reason. Still, I hope I speak for a majority of us when I say that he deserves at least as much joy in his life as he's added to ours, and I hope he always has that."
