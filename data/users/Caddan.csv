WRONG

They *are* getting abused.  Emotionally abused.

They are seeing their dad getting screamed at every time they go over to the grandparents house.  Their foundation, their bedrock, the person who takes care of them, is getting beat down by his own father.  That molds the children, and shapes how they will think.

Potential possibilities here:  
1) Your kids will see that you are abused, and that this is ok.  You will lose any moral authority you have over them. They may start doing it themselves.  
2) They are seeing that it's ""normal"" for parents to scream at their kids.  They start thinking, ""how long before daddy starts screaming at me?""
