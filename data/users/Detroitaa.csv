AmItheAsshole,ff8bfx5,t3_erwpm1,1579671827.0,"NTA. They’re jerks. Food can be a huge bonding experience for a family, if they let it. When my late husband & I married, his mother was against it. We were an interracial couple (70’s) . She was Sicilian & I’m African American. Things got a lot less frosty when we started having kids. She loved to babysit our eldest son. He loved her food & often asked for it at home. I’m a good cook ( soul food / creole), but I knew little about Italian cooking, so I asked her for recipes . Funny, but like me, she didn’t use exact recipes. She said the only way I’d learn, was to watch her. Every Saturday afternoon, I’d go over her house & learn different dishes. As time went by we grew to like each other. She even learned how to cook jambalaya, crawfish etouffee, rice & beans , collard greens and corn bread. By then I’d learn to make pasta all’s norma, swordfish dishes, lasagna & many different kinds of gravy (sauces) . When my husband & I married she refused to say my name. I was holding her hand when she died . We grew to love each other . It all started in the kitchen. Even if the brother uses cheaper food, he can perhaps experiment, with doing some dishes from scratch (  they might taste better ) & learn to appreciate his brothers expanding his kids culinary experience , with new things. Explain to their daughter that everyone cooks differently, & learn to cook some of her healthier choices from scratch ( that always tastes better). Just a tbought."

I told her, that I knew of a lot of false rape claims, that resulted in people getting lynched ( the Scottsboro Boys, the Rosewood Massacre, etc.). She still refused to budge, even though she admitted those were false allegations. I tried to reason with her, that if women would make false allegations when they knew the men would most likely be lynched, it stands to reason, many other women would make false allegations, when a lesser punishment was involved ( a mans reputation, incarceration, possible beating, etc.,), just to get back at some man they were angry about. Surely, those men deserved a chance to defend themselves! She ( who was not only an author, but a prosecutor in ny), unfriended me. It’s crazy. Women don’t live in a perpetual state of perfection & all men aren’t rapists & women beaters. I don’t understand how anyone with sons (or daughters) could believe such nonsense."
