SeattleWA,ffyqidc,t1_ffyfk9p,1580352675.0,It was cold coffee actually
AskReddit,ffyirre,t1_ffy2vvk,1580347411.0,"> Men always have to accept their part of the responsibility for every consequence that befalls them.  Women are the only ones who get a pass and never have to accept any responsibility for anything they do.  They have the built in “victim shaming” and “slut shaming” card that men don’t have.


Alrighty then.... I see that you have totally normal views on women and society"
loseit,ffxsgru,t1_ffwkprp,1580331522.0,"Yeah ‘built like a linebacker’ is basically part of the bullshit society-wide conspiracy to define attractiveness as weakness for women. 

I see posts about women bulking up and it’s like “god forbid you look like you can pick up a suitcase”. I briefly started lifting and was shocked at the actual muscles in my forearms - and then that morphed into being disturbed that my forearms were useless straight little sticks before. And now... need to go back to the gym."
AskReddit,ffxmhwc,t1_ffxct62,1580328136.0,"So, thinking more about this:
I would agree that people have some basic moral obligation to take reasonable safety precautions. It also tracks that both the moral obligation and the required safety precautions increase risk as risk grows. So following that logic, if women are at a greater risk of violence than men, then they have an increased moral obligation to protect themselves. 

But now we are disproportionately penalizing women for making the same decisions men do, because they are more likely to be victimized (by men). So in practice, if I (a woman) have a third beer then I have committed a moral transgression than a man, all else equal. This seems wrong - it puts a burden on women to keep themselves safe that men don’t have, and the burden grows as violent against women grows. The more dangerous it is, the more it is a woman’s fault for being harmed. 

In addition, there tends to be a simultaneous shift away from talking about the criminal. It’s tends to be “but why was she that drunk?” and not “that guy needs to go to prison and stay there. This is why it’s so important for young women to watch for each other and so important to aggressively prosecute sex crimes. She might have taken more safety precautions but these guys will just find other victims if they aren’t held responsible.”

Much of time those comments are associated with his ‘bright future’ - which is a phenomenon specific to sexual violence. It’s never suggested that the thief get a lighter sentence because they could see the wallet and we don’t talk about their bright futures. 

Also, why single out _girls_ in your comment? Why not just teens? Because excessive drinking and not paying attention to your surroundings and entering into compromising situations are not exclusive to girls. There are heightened risks from fights, dangerous stunts, drunk driving, trying drugs, and alcohol dependence for boys to disproportionately worry about but we still single out women for risky behavior - despite the fact that the risks are imposed by other people."
AskReddit,ffsfjsu,t1_ffs6zje,1580180466.0,Shiver...
TwoXChromosomes,ffmslgx,t3_eu361s,1580058469.0,"I know it’s hard to be direct and firm in those situations - we are trained by society to be polite and it’s difficult to overcome that training in the moment. 

What you can do is practice - practice saying “I’m busy working and I do not have time to talk. I hope you have a great day” in a firm voice. Say it to yourself and ask a friend to role play with you. You can counter-train yourself to be able to respond in the moment. One thing I tend to say is “No, thank you.” Homeless person asks me for money - “No thank you!” Weirdo asks my name on a bar - “No thank you.” It’s kind of a non sequitur and puts them off balance.  

Also, remember that this guy is rudely interrupting you and doesn’t deserve your politeness. Personally, I think of myself as respectable lady Jane Austen-style; my mantra is “I will not be spoken to on the street (bar/coffee shop/bus)!” Ask yourself, are you a lady or some common strumpet who owes her time to every man? 

I do try to look around first and make sure there isn’t a good reason for someone to talk to me - like I dropped a credit card, or my backpack is open, or I’m on fire. But if none those things are going on then I’m back to my “I will not be spoken to in public!” mindset. 

Caveat: I live in Seattle and spend a lot of time walking or on the bus. The Seattle social norm is to mind your own business in all public settings - normal people typically do not strike up conversations in public and it’s slightly rude to chat up a stranger. I am friendlier in other cities and adapt to local social norms."

careerguidance,ffjugwd,t3_ettk32,1580007273.0,"How do they talk to each other and other employees? Is this a leadership style or just abusive? 

I had a boss like this and what he ultimately wanted was for me to yell back at him. It was my first professional job and I was always trying to be tactful and professional. Also, I was understandably not confident because I didn’t know anything. 

After a miserable year or so, I gained the experience to have insight and judgement on small issues. So while I didn’t understand shit about the business, I had learned what would infuriate the client - and I started asserting myself in that area. I also stopped taking responsibility for his bad behavior - if I made a mistake, it didn’t mean that I deserved to me treated that way. 

Eventually I started standing up to him when he was telling me the wrong thing or giving me crap instructions - and he was satisfied that I was thinking for myself and not screwing up. He was also a new manager whose manager modeled awful behavior for him. 

In the end, we became super close friends and we still scream at each other. I still don’t agree with his original management style but I did learn to think on my own, 

So here’s my advice if you want to stay: 
1. Stand up for yourself - don’t immediately fold if you are right about something. You can make your point and then ‘disagree and commit’. 
2. Consider reading “Multipliers” which advocates for a challenging leadership style. Also read a criticism of it. It might be worthwhile to confront this directly - “I understand that you want a high pressure environment to foster creativity, but there is a trade off with quality and thinking things through...” 
3. Be mindful of their failings and don’t take it own yourself. They aren’t yelling because you made a mistake, they are pretending to be Jeff Bezos and thinking this will magically confer success. 
4. Give honest feedback on their ideas and plans. Look for an opportunity to say “I think this approach doesn’t account for the risk” (or whatever) and make a direct case for it. If they freak out, then you should quit. 

I think you can adapt to an overly aggressive leadership style and learn to communicate aggressively. But if they are just being abusive (singling you out, using insults, refusing to admit fault/doubt, getting pissed if you disagree) then you should just leave."
badassanimals,ffh0ds3,t1_fffqteu,1579919742.0,"I did exposure therapy for my spider phobia a couple years back and the therapists definitely had me handle the tarantula. 

They were like, “it’s totally fine and normal!” It’s only years later that I learned its controversial to handle at all. 

However it was a Chilean rose hair and very calm. We even had a slight throwing incident where I panicked and accidentally hurled Benji onto the therapists chest. She scooped him up and handed him back to me - he wasn’t even mad. Also uninjured, he was lucky. 

Anyway, this guy should definitely not be handling that thing."
YAlit,ffgtvsb,t3_et7ee0,1579914936.0,"‘Spinning Silver’ has normal looking (or somewhat ugly) female protagonists and definitely addressed beauty in a straightforward way. There are a few beautiful characters and it’s described as a double edged sword. 

‘Sabriel’ and ‘Lirael’ (the Old Kingdom series) are also regular looking protagonists. I think they are both pretty but no one is falling all over themselves. Lirael is definitely prettier than she gives herself credit for but she’s internalized a beauty standard she can’t live up to. 

The protagonist in “Dread Nation” considers herself nothing special and no one else is too excited about her. 

I am definitely underwhelmed by amazingly beautiful protagonists, unless it is very central to the story. “Kushiel’s Dart” (_not YA!!!_) for example - Phedre is super beautiful but that’s why she’s an extremely high-priced courtesan/spy. She’s basically a super model and everyone is like “yeah, she’s insanely beautiful but that’s why she’s a super model”. There’s no false modesty or makeover montage."

Seattle,ffft83f,t1_fffmslr,1579891285.0,"It’s not at all hard to make friends if you put in the effort. People who are bitching about this are either completely lazy and passive, or have terrible social skills. 

Just join Meetup and go to events - you need to go to the same event about 3 times to make a friend probably. Repetition is key. Take up an active social hobby, like Pokémon Go or Wizards Unite or some type of adult group sport. Join a social group or ERG at the office. Try BumbleBFF.

If you set out to intentionally make friends (with people who also want to make friends) then you’ll be fine. Notice that all my suggestions revolve around people who have opted in to meet new people. You shouldn’t expect anyone to chat you up in line at the grocery store and exchange numbers - generally only crazy people try to chat in public here. 

I moved here in 2018 and made regular friends pretty quickly. I’m hating meeting new people and I’m not exactly smooth. Just put in effort."

And why doesn’t the audible app integrate with goodreads and/or amazon - they should be offering you ebook copies and posters. I don’t really want the advertising but it just seems weird they don’t have it. 

I think audible has really been investing in content, especially the exclusives - Skyward was an exclusive which disturbs me.

ADHD,fdr3rrr,t1_fdqtlkg,1578679130.0,"I went to CBT for this exact feeling and it was super helpful. Clearly you are doing many good things and it outweighs the time your spend frozen in terror, otherwise you wouldn’t be where you are. 

CBT helped me recognize my totally nuts disordered thoughts and make them more realistic."
ADHD,fdr3dns,t1_fdqv3ns,1578678919.0,"The meds help but I also recommend doing CBT. The cycle of procrastination becoming guilt/terror is different than just the ability to focus, in my experience.

For me, the paralysis is due to a ton of negative feelings around being unproductive - if you were just distracted then you could accomplish 4% of like 50 things. It wouldn’t be efficient but you’d be humming along doing random crap and it would build up to some stuff finished eventually. 

Distraction and lack of focus produces uncoordinated action, not just staring at your computer hating yourself for 45 minutes straight."
ADHD,fdr2du5,t1_fdqv62e,1578678561.0,Yep. I used to really beat myself up but I’m doing better at recognizing that I have good days too.
ADHD,fdr2836,t1_fdqvqf6,1578678466.0,"I hate when this happens. Have you tried using the 5 Ws? Who what when where why and how? 
 Just get out a piece of paper and kind of answer those questions. 

Who: Jennifer & Jason, and a ton of other people - I don’t fucking even know. 
What: this loan application 
When: Started before Christmas probably
Etc...

Now you’ve started to outline the problem and you can choose a gap to fill in. 

What are all the things you don’t know? Make a list and then search your email or google one. 

Also, good emails filled with info take an _eternity_ to write. It’s a mark of real professionalism to break things down for people so they can grasp what is going on. Taking the time to write a nice email is a huge benefit to the people who receive it and you should feel proud of yourself."
ADHD,fdr0t84,t1_fdqwk6i,1578677923.0,"I just a similar trick and it works great. Partially because it gets awkward to stop. It just feels odd to read 2 sentences and stop mid-paragraph. Also, most things are nowhere near as terrible as you think they will be. 

And the more you succeed at becoming unfrozen, the more confident you can become. “Like, I have been frozen before and broken out of it, I might be able to do it this time too.”"
ADHD,fdr01au,t3_emsgc8,1578677711.0,"I hate this feeling - it is THE WORST. My method is to make a tiny 5-item list of things that take 5 seconds or less each and then cross them off. 
For example: 
1. Move 3 things off desk
2. Close 3 windows 
3. Flip coin to pick between phyisical or email inbox 
4. Shuffle papers / pull up email window (don’t look it them!)
5. Read 2 subject lines

Cross each one off as you go. Writing the list will take longer than doing the activity. Most of the time, I end up abandoning the list after 15 items or so. I just focus on a task and become unfrozen. 

However, if you are too paralyzed and use the list all day, you’ll still end accomplishing like 45 minutes of work.

I did CBT and it helped me recognize that if I can just get started, I will feel better. What I start on or how it goes doesn’t matter - just that I do something."

TwoXChromosomes,fdo1f70,t1_fdno0kc,1578597115.0,"I don’t have a problem saying ‘no’ - it is a natural and unfortunate part of life that sometimes romantic interest doesn’t match up. Hell, even friendship interests don’t always match up - sometimes I’m not what someone is looking for. 

I think being kind but direct is the way to go, assuming someone has approached me nicely - something like “that is very flattering but no thank you. It is was very nice talking with you but I’m not interested.” 

As for the guy who tries to argue with me about it... well, no one has. If they were lucky I would freeze and if not, possibly fly into a rage. When someone disrespects my boundaries and is rude, I get pissed.

Almost daily player looking to send and receive gifts. I’d rather not get regular spell energy - I have a soft policy of deleting those.

ADHD,fd1j0rf,t1_fd0fwcs,1578131906.0,"Everyone is different, but I generally like to hang out with someone for roughly 4 hours once a week, occasionally twice in the same week. I  an get tired and annoyed with them after that point. It does depend on what we we do, like watch a movie and then take off or talk the whole time. 

I would not want to see my closest lifelong friends for more than about 8 hours of quality time in a week. 

So I would maybe think about how much friend time you want per week (in hours), how long you like to hangout for, and how often you want to see the same person. Then take a look at your friends and see if you need a couple more."
