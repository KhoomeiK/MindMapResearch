iPadPro,ff8qojo,t3_es7f19,1579692104.0,"I have 3 kinds of macs (Mac mini, MacBook pro, MacBook Air), two iPad mini’s and an original iPad Pro from 2015.  I love the iPad Pro and it’s the one device (other than my iPhone 8) that I use every day. I really want to upgrade to the latest one, but can’t justify it, because it’s still going strong! 

The last Mac I bought was the MacBook Pro and I almost instantly regretted it; it’s really (compared to the Air) heavy, was expensive and just doesn’t feel as good to use. My uses for Macs are really just browsing and the occasional word doc, as I have to use a PC for work. The iPad Pro is my work companion, where I write notes, review docs, type notes during meetings (on an external keyboard/case), so that my typing doesn’t drown out others on Skype calls (I work from home). 

Unless there are apps you really can’t run on the iPad Pro, get one. They are awesome. Actually, get one anyway; you’ll find yourself making ‘excuses’ to use it. 😆"

keyboards,fe5polj,t3_eh0792,1578872705.0,"Update: I ended up buying a TKL keyboard by Havit from Amazon; it was on sale for $59 and I used some points to pay less than that. It’s totally not what I was going for (it has keilh clicky switches; can’t remember exactly what kind), although it does have the low profile keys I was looking for. It only has one color backlight (ice blue), but I’m fine with that. I’m enjoying it and not bothered by the click at all. 

What I will say is that it has this slightly annoying ‘musical’ ping after the click and I’m wondering if that is evidence of lesser quality metal components somewhere. Maybe if I had spent more, I would get that?  Anyway, I’m getting used to it now and find myself typing a little faster. The feel of it is just what I was looking for!

Thanks to those who gave me advice, even if I didn’t exactly follow it!"

Try to be gentle on yourself; treat yourself as you would your most treasured friend. You sound very caring to me and maybe you did a very aspergic thing by reaching out a second time, but that makes you special (in a good way!). You reached out after being rejected. You are much stronger than you think."
