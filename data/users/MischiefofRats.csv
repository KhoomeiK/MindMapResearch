Get something less generic and more mid-century modern, in a nice wood or an interesting modern texture, and finish the space with a simple, clean-line bench with some low-key bins for shoe storage. I like the mirror but the shelf definitely seems ripe to trip someone or get kicked, so if you leave it there you might want to fill the floor space underneath it with something."
AskReddit,ff9oulf,t1_ff9mprg,1579717556.0,"I understand that. Ritual is meaningful in grief. It's never for the dead person. My problem with funerals is the same problem I have with weddings and diamonds--there's an entire industrial complex that has sprung up around very human needs for ritual, celebration, and remembrance that exists only to convince you that to do things 'right' you need to spend a lot of money on 'traditions', many of which have been invented wholecloth or modified by the industry to perpetuate itself. It's wildly out of control. Funerals do not need to cost as much as a down payment on a house.

And also, I hate the cultural idea that a body is meaningful. I get that it's been the case more often than not on a global and historical scale, but it's a corpse. It's dead flesh. The person is gone."

It's not about safe distance, man. You don't have to be tailgating for this to be annoying. You can be four+ car lengths back and still get your dark vision fucked up by hazard lights. And for fuck's sake, it's a single lane road, I'm the only person behind that car, we're going 5-10 MPH max in the fog, they have their headlights on so opposing traffic can DEFINITELY see them--the lights serve NO purpose except to tell me the driver isn't local, doesn't know the road, and doesn't know the traffic laws."

selfimprovement,ff70i2a,t3_erzss8,1579638670.0,"I dunno the answer but I'm curious to see what others say. 

My take is that there's currently a cult of forced positivity in our lives which leads to further and further separation of people in a culture that's already separating us very well. No matter how good your attitude is, life can't be sunshine and rainbows all the time. It's just that nobody seems willing at this point to deal with anyone who's having anything less than a great time. It's so much easier to just toss out some platitudes--chin up, stiff upper lip, attitude is everything, don't be so negative, etc--and throw responsibility back on the person who might be reaching out for help or attention, than it is to actually listen and empathize and help. I think it's killing us, literally and metaphorically. We need each other, we all need help sometimes, and we can smell placation. It's fake. It's performative, to make the speaker feel better about themselves. ""Ladies, you're all beautiful!"" ""You're so strong!"" ""Find your tribe!"" ""Live, laugh, love!"" 

It's all performative. It's fake. It's to everyone and no one, and the only person it means anything to is the person putting it out there. 

I know there's an issue with a bitter angry wallowing attitude that makes nothing better, but treating everyone who's not currently Disney on ice like they're wallowing pointlessly is just cruel. But doing anything else requires effort, honesty, and emotional intelligence, and all of those things are much easier said than done. It's simplest to gloss-coat everything and hope that the darkness passes, which is what people do."

LuLaNo,feufya6,t1_fe2ipaf,1579386130.0,"I think there's a slight sweet spot when you start making really nice shit. When you're just starting out and making a lot of basics like tops and pants, it's pretty much going to be 30-250% cheaper to just go buy a ready to wear garment, doubly so if you thrift. But when you start making nice things that are fitted and well-made in nice fabrics, with quality embellishment, linings, pattern matching, etc, that's where you start to win. Yeah, the fabrics are ridiculously more expensive and you put a lot of time in, but if you're not counting your hours as a dollar amount, you can easily start getting $500+ garments made for much, much less, particularly if you can find the fabrics on sale.  For someone who might be interested in designer garments but isn't interested in the thousands of dollars they cost, that's where you can start to win, in the sense of making those types of garments somewhat affordable and attainable. You still lose in the lack of resale though, since actual designer garments in good condition can almost always be resold to recoup some, all, or more than the original price. 

All that said, you can't beat the single biggest benefit of sewing, though, which is the fact that your sewn garments are made for you specifically and fit you like a glove. By you, for you, precisely to your taste. It's worth it."

BlackPeopleTwitter,fdpk41b,t1_fdpcrlm,1578630811.0,"I don't think there's anything I'd love for very long if I had to do it for work. Everything I love to do is creative, and clients in creative work are literally the worst people. I can't stand the thought of slowly coming to hate the things I loved the most because I have to do them 40-80 hours a week for other people, to their specifications and satisfaction. Plus, creative work doesn't pay shit. If the job is something people do for a hobby, it won't ever pay shit but for the few life lotto winners, because everyone wants to do it. There's a glut of supply and little demand. Hell, there are even lots of people who'll work for free, and that poisons the well even further.

My thinking is more that the vast majority just have to find something we can tolerate, and eke our satisfaction out of more generic successes. Work no one wants to do pays well and funds hobbies. And I'm sorry, but there's no fucking way in hell I'm sacrificing the majority of my waking life every single week doing work for other people just to make a pittance and scrape by.

fatlogic,fdmel31,t1_fdlgftg,1578547344.0,"Exactly. All of this, exactly. My family is a love-through-food family too, only literally all of us are overweight. My mom pushes food like it's her job. My aunt looks like I kicked a puppy if I refuse to take 30 cookies when I leave because I don't need that shit around me. My grandparents eat out like fifteen times a week. Most of them are allegedly baffled as to why they can never lose weight, but none of them are interested in the real reason, and it's *so easy* to get sucked in.

That environment is so important--when I lost all the weight last time, I was living by myself and walking/hiking all the time. I had complete control of my food environment and worked in an office without a lot of lunch options near enough--I had to bring my lunch every day. It was easier, but it still wasn't *easy,* because I can't just not want food, pretty much ever. I dearly wish I could, but I can't. I can overeat on healthy food like chicken and broccoli just as easily as overeating garbage like pizza. It's always been hard and it's going to be hard for the rest of my life. I'm not accusing naturally-thin folk of having magic metabolisms or trying to claim I defy thermodynamics; I eat too much, every day.

fatlogic,fdl3jr7,t1_fdkqf32,1578516452.0,"My experience matches yours. The only difference for me is that I've had to admit calorie counting can't be the permanent answer for me, because it's only a matter of time before I fall off the wagon. It requires a consistency of routine and extremely strong habits, which were not my best qualities. 

I'm currently trying OMAD fasting (or variations of it) to see if I can find a simple balance in just not eating so often. Finite periods of active hunger are less mentally stressful to me than habitually weighing chicken or measuring veggie slices for snack bags I won't want to eat anyway."
fatlogic,fdl2ijr,t1_fdkon1y,1578515954.0,"I dearly wish I could do that. Like, my life would be a thousand times easier. Intuitive eating requires reservoirs of mindfulness and willpower I *simply don't have* on a consistent basis. Like.... Okay, here's my best swing at explanation.

You may look at a box of donuts in the conference room and think, ""hmmmm... nah, I'll just eat lunch later,"" but I look, and then I think about how delicious it would be and which flavor is the best one left and how long I'm going to have to sit in this meeting and how much I don't want to be here and how bored I am already and how tired I am and everyone around me is eating and then I just go, ""fuck it,"" and have a donut. Even if I ultimately say no to the donut, it's a good minute or two of mental struggle and multiple instances of thinking about it *again and again* as long as I know the food is there, or it's in my sight. How many times a day do I have to fight this battle, you know? It's never-ending. And plus, so much socialization revolves around food. Say I'm not hungry but friends invite me out for drinks. I think, okay, two light beers is maybe 300 calories, that's not catastrophic, I'll limit myself... and then two hours later I'm twenty chips w/ hummus deep without even thinking about it, and I'm on my fourth beer, all to the tune of 700-900 calories.

I'm not defending this, but it's the reality of what I'm dealing with in my brain and body on an average day, which is most of my days as an average person. This happens multiple times a day with all kinds of food. Even if I exercised every day, which I don't because I hate it and I've always hated it, I could never out-exercise the crap I shovel in my mouth. The solution has to come from restricted eating.

My problem is that I don't have a normal off-switch, or a normal idle-system. Once in a while I can be on my game, a few months at a time maybe. I can keep an apple on my desk, look at a donut, ask myself if I'm really hungry or just bored, look at the apple, decide I'm bored, then just drink some water and move on with my day. Other days I've got six snack size chip bags in my office trash and I'm working through a sleeve of thin mints by 10am because I got a little stressed out. It doesn't work for me to just listen to my body because my instincts are *not healthy,* and the part of me that wants to be healthy is not in the driver's seat all the time.

At this point, I'm trying to find some sort of solution that works for me without calorie counting because even though it works, it's just not sustainable for me. It's too involved and requires too much consistency of routine. I lost 80 pounds counting calories a couple years ago, but as soon as something major happened in my life I spun out of control and lost all will to carry on. I gained a lot of that weight back. I personally am doomed to fall off the bandwagon and fail *eventually* when it comes to calorie counting. Intuitive eating definitely isn't the answer for me either, because I don't *have* intuition about food and my body, only constant cravings and weakness. 

My current approach is OMAD (one meal a day) fasting. I've done fasting in the past to a lesser degree. It works for me, but until now I've never tried it without calorie counting at the same time. And I mean, I'm not diabetic, I don't have any major health problems, it's fine, I'm not going to collapse or die. Ultimately it's mentally and physically easier for me just not to break the seal on eating at all. Being actively hungry for a finite period but not worrying about the *precise* content of my meals later (while still hitting a calorie deficit because I can only eat so much at one time) is less stressful for me than trying to make conscious, measured healthy choices all the time, every hour, every day, constantly. 

With OMAD, the rules are stupid-simple. 
1) It's either eat'o'clock or it's not. Dilemma solved.
2) Don't eat like a human trash fire. Done deal."

I want that. I do. I *desperately* want that, and I want to be that for someone else too. I just can't seem to convince myself that it's possible, and I'm having a hard time finding the balance between taking responsibility for fixing my own shit so that it doesn't destroy all my relationships, and feeling like I have no right to ask for help because that's an unfair, codependent imposition on my friends. I dunno man. I don't understand it. I can't even fathom how dating would work. The idea of dating seems like trying to sail a boat without a hull right now--I'd just sink immediately, because I've got so many emotional deficiencies and problems, but I don't even know the full scope of what I'm trying to fix, let alone how long it will take. I'm letting so many years go by without even trying, and I know it's so stupid and the right answer is to just try but... it feels so doomed, so much like I'm going to end up in a relationship that's actively bad for me right now, or the failures will get to me.

And in some ways I just wish it were clean cut and she (current friend abandoning me for SO) were like, a terrible person, but she's not. She's a great person and we've been best bros for ten years but literally everything about the last year has me questioning whether it's been this lopsided and unhealthy the whole damn time. I was genuinely excited for her at first, because this is a great thing for her, but six months in my friend seemed like she was no longer her own person, only Girlfriend™. I thought it would wear off with the novelty, but it hasn't. She talks about nothing but him, what they did, where they went, what they're planning, what he said, how their relationship is going. Every time I invite her somewhere, she wants to know if she can bring him. She doesn't invite me to hang out unless he's out of town or otherwise unavailable. I'm never her first choice anymore. She even, without telling me what the hangout plans were, took me on a retread of one of their dates--same restaurant, same food, same hangout spot. Normally, that wouldn't be a big deal, found a new spot and want to share, and ngl it was definitely tasty food, but in context, goddamn, please stop. Please, please stop. I've only met the guy a couple times and I'm starting to hate him just because I have to hear about him so much. I feel like I have to join her relationship just to have my friend back, and I don't want to. I've started leaving her on read or just ignoring her texts because she hasn't texted me with anything that's not about him in so long. I'm so tired, I know I'm letting the friendship die, and this hasn't even the first time I've lost my closest friend this exact way. Same thing happened in high school. I feel like it's got to be something in my approach or how I'm dealing with it--if you smell shit everywhere you go, check your shoes--but I don't know what. I can't stand the instant and enormous demotion in importance and prioritization. She's happy and I'm not and I don't feel like she even has the capacity to care in the middle of all her bliss."

I absolutely fold my arms while I'm talking to people I like about interesting things I agree with. I'm listening closely and following conversations while scrolling reddit, and I can and will respond promptly because I am not ignoring you even if it looks exactly like I am. I cross my legs all the time and it has nothing to do with anyone talking to me and more to do with my lower back fucking hating every single chair ever created. I will move away and deliberately avoid contact with anyone, even people I like, because I do not like being touched. It's got nothing to do with anyone.

shoppingaddiction,fdgyhdt,t3_elcb67,1578411415.0,"Therapy is the answer. It's worth every penny and more. You can do a lot of work on this problem on your own, but please talk to someone who can help you work into the issues that are actually causing your need for this. 

In the meantime you need to cope and try to force healthier habits, so try some blocker apps, like StayFocused and Blocksite, and put them on strict mode because your willpower is not going to be enough. Block the apps, block the sites, stay off. Avoid triggers, like Instagram. My thing is if I don't see it I can't want it, so avoiding looking altogether is by far the easiest strategy. But seriously, therapy, and if you like to read, there are a few books on the topic that might help. Also, try to pick up some other things to fill your time. Set a goal of reading for an hour a day, or do yoga with some videos off YouTube, or do 10-20 minutes of meditation every day. Keeping busy with productive self-care activities will help you keep your mind off the compulsion. 

And if you absolutely need to engage with the urges, try shopping in your own closet. Pull things out, try them on, create new outfits, work on finding interesting substitutions ornew combinations instead of just thinking ""I need something new to complete this"", photograph your outfits and accessories, log them in an online closet photo album, get rid of things you hate; in other words, work on creation and appreciation of what you have instead of mindless acquisition. It'll hit some of the same buttons, and can tide you through the urges to shop. It will also bring you face to face with what you've already acquired, and that may be stressful, but *don't try to dodge the stress.* Sit with it. Think about it. Put it in context. Add things up. Don't beat yourself up about it. Don't be cruel or abusive to yourself, don't tell yourself you're fucking up, because you're not. What's done is done and you are not a fuck-up; you're just working through shit, and realizing you need to focus in other directions is a very good thing. Mindfulness will help. Don't dodge your feelings. Feel them. Let yourself ease into the complexities and learn about yourself.

And go to therapy."

dating_advice,fd3bg6a,t1_fd2obzr,1578156617.0,"I'm not OP but I feel the same as them. Here's the thing: for me, it isn't about being upset that there's no instant spark. At all. That has nothing to do with it. That's fanciful fiction, I well know it. The problem is that in modern dating, like dating *right now,* there's this huge, heavy expectation that you have to be willing to engage in substantial emotional and physical intimacy with someone who's essentially a stranger, *very* VERY quickly. That expectation is wild and nauseating to me. The culture of modern dating is so fast-paced. Half the shit I hear 90% of currently-dating people talk about feels like drinking out of a fire hose. I don't want to kiss on the first date. I don't want to tell a stranger deep secrets within hours of meeting them. I don't want to be touched by someone I've only met twice. I don't want to have sex with a person within three dates, or maybe even three months. I don't work that way. I want to get to know a person on a deeper level without the constant and immediate pressure of sexual and romantic expectations, because I literally don't and CAN'T feel those urges at that point, at all. Only when I feel pretty good about someone, like I have a solid grasp on who they are as a person, and how they work, and what their values are and how they act, and I feel with some certainty that I can actually trust this individual to some significant degree, ONLY THEN am I going to be interested in kindling specifically romantic and sexual connections. 

It feels like swimming upstream to be this way. That's the problem. When there's a never-ending series of posts from people freaking out because ""omg we went on two dates and she left me on read for a few hours does she hate me????"" or ""I met him in a bathroom at a concert and we fucked, it's six months later and we're getting married tomorrow"" and that shit gets treated and addressed as being fairly normal, or at least *understandable,* I'm just left bewildered and feeling incredibly alienated by the culture.

Like.... Jesus fucking Christ. I can't *do* that. I can't spend twelve hours with someone over three dates and then hop in bed. I don't want to, no matter how attractive they are. They're still a stranger. I have no idea who that person REALLY is. I only know who they want me to think they are."

shoppingaddiction,fczd3qj,t3_ejlrta,1578098519.0,"This might be a shot in the dark, but one important thing to help with clothes/cosmetics/accessory spending in particular is to consider the concept of the Fantasy Self. Often when I'm overspending in these areas, the reason is that I'm envisioning a version of myself which suits that item and I am fantasizing about being that version. For example, I recently saw a really glamorous burnt orange wool cloche hat, which I told myself would look amazing with a certain aesthetic I've been starting to cultivate for myself. I could see it going with a lot of outfits, so I considered buying it because it matches that version of myself-- *which doesn't currently exist*. Shopping (buying the hat) is leaning in to that fantasy of me, letting me believe for a moment that I am her. Whether I use/wear it or not (and often, I don't) I didn't need it and never did. 

The reality is that I nearly never wear hats, let alone a burnt orange wool cloche hat. No part of me that actually exists right now, or is likely to exist in the future, needs a burnt orange wool cloche hat. That goes for so many items--a new purse, a fifth pair of jeans, those great heels. Asking myself whether I need the item or whether it's an item for my fantasy self? That's what often stops me from spending the money fairly often. It might be something that applies to you as well. You most likely don't NEED a thousand dollars worth of clothes in a month, so what's the real reason you're buying that much? Is it boredom? Is it stress relief? Both of those, if you can teach yourself to recognize them, can be redirected into other activities or outlets. Is it because of FOMO (fear of missing out, as with a limited release or a unique/vintage item), which creates a false sense of urgency to buy something you didn't want or need before you saw it? Or is it because you're trying to adhere to a fantasy version of yourself that's happier? For that, only mindfulness and working on your current self can fix it, not buying a new dress."
dating_advice,fcyw4t1,t1_fcyhnnx,1578088381.0,"Any waiting list is worth it. And of course it's not perfect; it's just extremely fucking helpful if you're willing to actually work to extract value from it instead of dismissing it as an imperfect solution.  

Therapy is like signing up for a personalized class with an educated professional to get lessons on how to improve your emotional/social/interpersonal problems. It's not and never will be a magic wand, ever, anywhere. It's helpful time with someone who knows (usually) what the fuck they're on about, who can ask you good questions to try to help you dig up the roots of your problems, and who can point you to helpful resources and strategies to help YOU do the work to fix yourself. If you're just going to sneer at it you probably shouldn't bother with it because you're not ready for it, but if you're willing to give it an earnest effort it's going to help you.

Life doesn't have a finish line until you're dead. You'll never just suddenly be ""the perfect person you always wanted to be,"" ever, because your goals will always evolve and change as you grow, and that's a good thing."

datingoverthirty,fcyd5jp,t3_ejh9ni,1578078355.0,"I can tell you right now (not trying to create false intimacy w/ you for sexy purposes, esp. b/c I'm on to you and strongly suspect you may actually be a seagull) you're funny as fuck and your displayed personality traits would immediately cause me to attempt befriending you so that I can at least keep listening to your bird jokes. 

But in all seriousness, I struggle with the same shit--why r u complimenting, attractive stranger??? WHAT DO U WANT FROM ME???? However, in my case, it's partly yes, many people do find compliments a successful ingratiating trick (especially the fuckers using my name in every sentence, yes I too know the contents of the book ""How to Make Friends and Influence People"" and you are NOT Dale Carnegie, buddy), and it's partly my own damage from being a socially dysfunctional reject child with no friends. Any extra attention puts me on high alert, because the only time other kids talked to me when I was young was when they wanted to make fun of me or antagonize me. Also, having been an unattractive lady my entire life, I'm well aware of the 'easy' stereotype my kind has. Compliment-laced approaches are about as trustworthy as a mystery drink at a party. Compliments are 100% free of cost or difficulty to the giver, yet are rare enough for the attention-starved that they have an outsized impact, even on me, and I'm constantly sniffing for manipulative tactics. 

THAT SAID, I do tend to give out compliments fairly regularly. I do mean them. Mine tend to focus on choices though--I love that dress, did you get your hair cut? It looks great!--because I'm also trying to remain in neutral-positive social territory and people love compliments on their taste because it's something they control (also what I would prefer to be complimented on for the same reason). I don't just find shit to say for the sake of saying shit, or for kissing ass, but it's something nice and easy to do for people to brighten their day. Notice, compliment, boom, they feel a little better, the air is a little lighter, I feel less anxious. And that's the thing too--it's a little bit selfish from me, too. Mutual benefit, really."

sewing,fcom6xf,t1_fcokkrl,1577835733.0,"All good info. I personally buy almost all my fabric from Fabric Mart Fabrics.

To contrast, wool is usually like $30-$40/yard at somewhere like Mood fabrics, fabrics.com., or Joanne's. 

100% on rayon bemberg lining, too. I don't even bother with synthetic fabrics; the static and fuss is too frustrating to work with and wear, plus they don't breathe. I haven't found rayon bemberg for much less than $12/yard at this point, but god it's worth it. Perfect lining fabric."
sewing,fco0whk,t1_fcmwm73,1577822092.0,"I'll be real with you: this dress ain't that complicated. If you're reasonably good at making things in general/competently crafty, you'll take to sewing pretty quick, but there's an ocean of hidden difficulty and skill in making garments. That's where the real uphill battle is going to be. 

I just started sewing this year. I am generally able to pick up new making-skills quickly, but there's a lot more than I expected to sewing garments. Patterns are sort of like cooking recipes--they'll give you general guidelines, ingredients, amounts, step by steps. If you follow them carefully you'll consistently come out with something reasonably like the package, but unlike cooking, sewing is pretty unforgiving to mistakes, and not friendly to alterations for the beginner. If you sub in oil for butter in your non-baked recipe, you'll probably be fine. If you sub in cotton jersey for cotton ponte knit, the whole garment will hang and lay differently, although they're super similar. Even the same fiber and weave  can be made into pretty drastically different fabrics, depending on weight. Using the wrong types or size of needle or thread can cause puckering or snags. Construction techniques can make a big difference too. Will it matter if you make your stir fry with a spoon or a spatula? Probably not. Will it make a difference if you sew your shirt with a universal or a ballpoint needle? Depending on the fabric, yes. The right tools and fabrics can make the difference between a visibly flawed garment and a professional-looking job. 

Sewing clothes is like 20% actual sewing. The bulk of the rest is fabric selection, washing, ironing, layout, cutting, preparation (like stay-stitching, basting, starching, interfacing), pinning, etc. Then, once you actually start sewing the garment, there's a whole new realm of skills required in identifying and resolving fitting issues and pattern alterations.

All of this is to say, you can do this, and it is rewarding, but just don't make the mistake of thinking the hard part is sitting at the machine. Pay attention to details and choose fabric carefully.

And honestly, this isn't a cheap hobby. 85% of the time, it'll be cheaper and take less time to buy something RTW and have it altered, but that's not the point of sewing."
