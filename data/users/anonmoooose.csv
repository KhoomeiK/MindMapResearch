Can you imagine there actually being people like this living in today’s world with ZERO clue about what rape really is?

Does he think a vagina has a zipper? I wish, maybe when he tries to force himself on someone he’d get his dingaling caught. 

Also I like how in your comment he says he beat up his “brother” for sending that. Does that show an awareness of how bad his mentality was that he couldn’t even own up to his own thoughts? Was he just playing the game like a psycho?? Or was he apologizing just for suggesting sex on a second date, like that was the worst part

unpopularopinion,ffcfct5,t3_essq09,1579798255.0,"This is the most frustrating thing, as someone who got kicked out a month after my 18th birthday. Life is unnecessarily hard at this age with everything running on the assumption that you have a good relationship with your parents. I couldn’t even access my bank account because my parents name was on it too and they needed to give me permission, even though I was over 18? And then I started vaping, which got yanked, and then I started smoking, which got bumped up to 21. I can’t go to parties at a lot of clubs, I most definitely can’t go to school because I can’t get my parents info for financial aide and I’m not considered “independent” until 26 for some ridiculous reason. My whole life I felt like 18 would unlock the rest of the world for me, I would legally be a free adult with so many options before me. Now I know 18 is just the age where you have to start paying taxes and the rest of adulthood is still locked away. 


Get this one, in some areas you can legally be kicked out of your home at 16. But did you know you can’t even check into a lot of hotels until you’re 21?? Why are the laws like this. I was godsmacked when I tried to get a room for a night and gave the clerk my ID (I’m now 19) and she asked “is there an adult with you?” WHAT?? And I only chose that hotel because several others listed specifically said on their site you had to be 21 but this one didn’t. I’m old enough to have a job and be on a business trip actually. I’m so so sick of always hearing about parent/guardians now holy shit, no wonder kids are so unsatisfied these days, nobody considers us adults until we’re at least 30.

Your school sacrificed MANY women’s health, wellbeing, and education for a stupid ignorant rule that absolutely didn’t effect the boys. Yes, we have the right to go to school now, but we shouldn’t be on our knees thanking all the kind gods for such generosity. As long as women have to deal with bottomless pits of issues that men are not affected by or don’t even know about, but often are the cause of, just for the sake of what body part they were born with, we will still need feminism to make our society equal.

The only time I’ve spoken up was when a man in a parking lot tried to ask me for money and made a big story about how him and his girl were stuck and just needed gas money (like that would get them to the gas station miles away) and he pointed at a car and said “that’s her over there, we just need your money, I’ve didn’t want to ask you in the store so I followed you out here.” I firmly told him I “don’t carry cash”, asked him why the hell he was following me, and then told him “sir your girlfriend seems to have just driven away.

unpopularopinion,fdg1pry,t1_fdehsk9,1578376796.0,"I’m glad you can rationally discuss this. Many men do have a lot of pressures and different thoughts during sex, and some of them can’t even get hard due to performance anxiety, which is understandable! But again, I think porn has a pretty big negative effect on all that religiously watch it. I can point out a lotttt if pornstars making pain noises instead of pleasure ones, their eyes look bored, they make fake oh yesssss, they only focus on the dick, they bend into positions that most people wouldn’t do for their own enjoyment.... it teaches women to be uninterested objects, and it teaches men to be selfish and boring. That leaves both sides unsatisfied, because men don’t get the connection and diversity in bed, and women expect men to be over confident and use them for only physical pleasure. My boyfriend tells me the sexiest part to him is watching me get pleasure, tell him what I like, and genuinely enjoy it. When I first started exploring sexually, that was actually a confusing request. What did I like? I didn’t know how to tell anyone what to do for me, because I though putting my ass up and just saying oooh yessss over and over is what pleases someone. I can confirm my sex is muchhhh better now, because we’ve become confident to try things that we have NOT seen in porn. This included unlearning on both sides. My bf never thought to use his hands, because in the videos guys don’t sensually roam their hands everywhere. I love that. I never thought I could choose to change positions, and tell him where to go and how I want the pace, but he loves that. 

Porn is artificial and it cheats both partners out of a lot of pleasure unless they’re both willing and able to communicate well with each other. If they even see what the problem is in the first place."

unpopularopinion,fdczi87,t3_ekm2ze,1578289020.0,"Porn indoctrinates our society from a very young age. It doesn’t just effect men, but the women too. I, and I’m not the only one, grew up thinking the way to have sex is to splay over something and let the man do whatever he wanted to me. Good sex does not look like porn, but where are we to learn that? Furthermore, who opens the discussion when men believe they should be dominate bordering on violent and always be in control, yet both partners are dissatisfied? 

Foreplay is more important for women than men, biologically speaking. However in my and most of the women I know, foreplay is usually just a blowjob. That gives me nothing. It actually makes me dry up because I’m focusing on the task so much. I have to speak up and ask for attention, which is again not something we’re taught is okay and I still struggle with it, and by the time my body has been prepared, his dick needs more sucking to get back in the game. Can’t tell you how many blowjobs I’ve given as the only course before sex. Luckily, my body gets wet very easily so while it isn’t always the best, sometimes I’m just able to completely skip everything and go to penetration. Which for women, doesn’t feel as good as you might imagine. Those screaming pornstars are lying again. Most of the sensation and pleasure of sex stuff comes from the clit, and internal stimulation can range from good, to weird, to not much at all. Lastly, I have a huge dislike of semen. But I “mMMmm” and swallow it and rub it all around anyway, because I’m supposed to. It’s not unnatural to not want sticky, gross tasting globs of goo all over your face, stinging your eyes, making your throat feel raw, cooling on your stomach, sliding off your back. In fact, if you want to talk “natural” that stuff should only go in the vagina, but women are expected to gleefully roll around it in and eat it for breakfast. Guys don’t ever kiss me after a blowjob, only they’re allowed to be repulsed by their own fluids?


Everyone’s different, but I’m included in the huge group of women that are stuck in the “sex is for male pleasure” mentality. It’s hard to break out of, and not well received every time. But as I’m always told that everything’s my fault and I just have to communicate, so shall I leave you with the same advice if you want your partner to consider something they didn’t think of doing on their own.

Think of it this way. It’s not you. It’s the state of men. And since women are blamed for not taking enough precautions as it is, big fat duh that they’re not going to take chances and play with the possibility that someone isn’t a good person. Majority of rapes happen by someone closer, like a friend or relative, that you trust and think could never do that to you - until they do. Do you have any idea what that does to someone’s head?

There shouldn’t be so much pushback, to basically defending rapists here - the more we pretend every guy is in danger of being falsely accused for politely holding a door and being thrown in the slammer for years, the more we let actual rapes that don’t see justice just get higher and higher. Believe victims. If there can be full evidence of a woman getting drugged, dragged, beaten, and raped behind a dumpster and the man can still walk free because the judge doesn’t want to harm his “promising career”, why on earth do people pretend it’s so easy or profitable to just point a finger and get an innocent man convicted?
