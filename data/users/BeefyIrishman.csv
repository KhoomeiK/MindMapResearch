Then, two paragraphs later:

>...

>She then walked away to a back area to ""call in the checks,"" but before leaving, she asked Thomas: ""How did you get this money?""

Sounds like the bank can't even keep their story straight. Maybe they should rehearse it some before getting in front of a judge so they can pay this guy more money.

>Thomas closed his TCF account that day and left the premises. Within an hour, he deposited the checks into a new account at a Chase bank in Detroit. 

You would think if a computer system had actually flagged it at one bank, other banks would also flag it.

Also, the quote under the photo of Thomas said this happened Jan 22, 2019. Since the article was updated 1 hour ago, I'm guessing that was a typo, just like the than/then typo in that first quote I have."

Now we all carry a computer more powerful than supercomputer of the 1970's. The Cray-1 had 160 MFLOPS of processing power, smartphones now have 100's of GFLOPS. That literally >1000 times greater.

My company has a bad case of this. As a result, I'm get literally hundreds of emails every day, 98% of which have nothing to do with anything related to my job. Only like maybe 5 a day are actually relevant to me. So I have to spend, on average, ~1.5-2 hours a day reading/ keeping up with the inflow of emails.

I have tons of rules to automatically sort and mark as read a lot of them (200-500/ day), but still end up having to manually go through at least 100-150/ day. Last time I added up the totals from each folder, there was just shy of 100,000 emails in my inbox. That's with deleting things older than ~2 years every few months, otherwise Outlook will lock up and crash.
