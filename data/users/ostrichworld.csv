college,fdhlrlu,t1_fdhdmpe,1578425345.0,"I’m going back as a biology major, rent is sometimes really close and sometimes it’s not at all. You’re right, that’s why i’m a server for the money lol. It’s just that the winter sometimes is really slow. Last year I could barely make ends meet. I live in iowa so thankfully rent is super cheap, but my roommate is planning on moving out in the spring and I want to take over the full lease. I’ve started to budget better the last month and i can see the difference already. I’m hoping it sticks. I wonder if I’m so nervous because I want to push myself to a 4.0 which I don’t think is unrealistic. I’m excited to learn, and get to know my professors if possible."
