watercooling,fciiytm,t1_fcgjlyq,1577663328.0,"Thank you! The problem is: I dont even know what fittings i need and how often :/
Same with the tools.
If I remember correctly the Corsair Hydro X Series has an easy attachable drain for its water Reservoire.
I would love to do some hard tubing, but i am somewhat of a perfectionist.. If sth isn‚Äòt 100% the way i wanted it to be, i will do it again.. that can cost a lot of money with those hart tubes"

Good thing I am german and very precise in everything I do. \^\^"
