How are you ever getting out of that poisonous two party situation?

I have been thinking about this for a while but I just don't see a viable path, everything is so entrenched and neither party has a good incentive for reform"
HistoryMemes,ffhnkd8,t1_ffgju69,1579944004.0,Yeah shit like abolishing term limits and staying in power forever.
Games,ffhng8a,t3_etg5k7,1579943834.0,"Bad performance fine obviously, but the bugs in dev, that sounds bad to me.

In my experience it's easiest to fix a bug shortly after you made it. Not years later before you need to release"
gifsthatkeepongiving,ffhlekt,t1_ffhkiqd,1579940782.0,"You have to admit the source quality is pretty shit in this one. It's much harder to do accurate edge detection if the edges are blurry, but that's what you need to do to figure out the correct movement"
instant_regret,ff6qt4c,t1_ff62uvr,1579632947.0,"People, if you are in Germany or Switzerland please follow the local rule of moving to the left in the leftmost lane or to the right in all others. Otherwise you'll be smack dab in the middle of the emergency corridor if you were in the leftmost lane."
CasualUK,ff6ffht,t1_ff65bvq,1579626025.0,So annoying when you flip your car 180° and it still doesn't fit
facepalm,ff2ch7h,t1_ff2c1ak,1579500659.0,I didn't either. I was in the Swiss military
facepalm,ff2cfnx,t1_ff239v5,1579500616.0,Name checks out for not getting it
facepalm,ff2bxme,t1_ff2aa54,1579500110.0,You must have not paid attention. I definitely saw it happening
2healthbars,feyr52y,t1_feykc03,1579449597.0,"Nintendo can require all they want, you are allowed to use others trademarks without authorization if you are just talking about their product.

Making claims of compatibility is the best example for when this makes sense, nespresso-compatible capsules for instance. Showing your product interacting with another is exactly the same.

Unless they made a contract with Nintendo of course, but why would they, if they are just selling on Amazon anyway"
600euro,feybze9,t3_equcuz,1579443510.0,Wtf. Idiotische Antwort.
Austria,feyaqj4,t1_fexc67n,1579443102.0,Wieso können wir schweizer das? Bessere geographische Lage oder was meinst du?
zurich,fex52h9,t1_fewn7af,1579424524.0,"I don't know who says ONO, but if it's in German that would mean Ost-Nordost, East-Northeast, not west.

East-Northeast is halfway between East and Northeast. 67.5 degrees to the right from North.

However if it's French that would be Ouest-Nordouest, then you'd be right.

That would be halfway between West and Northwest, it would be 67.5 degrees to the left of north, or a heading of 292.5 degrees."
ProgrammerHumor,fewwnpe,t3_eqlhtb,1579420643.0,I didn't push on friday and it's kind of made me nervous when I noticed. Pretty irrational but still
AskReddit,feug3r3,t1_fet1q3l,1579386185.0,"A German Youtuber, Mai Nguyen, said it was like saying Nürnberg but leaving out the berg. It doesn't work when you say ""Nuremberg"" like an American though."
AskReddit,feudcsa,t1_feu0tqh,1579385482.0,"After 130 or so I started having to guess quite often. But the first 100 were too easy, I made three errors and I'm not even a native speaker"
techsupport,fesedsd,t1_fes7zhm,1579364336.0,I like this one too. Just not for forms though
techsupport,fese4a7,t1_fes92u0,1579364251.0,I work in a hospital research group and we use 7-zip too (but mostly with zip and rar)
techsupport,fesci85,t1_fepr66a,1579363836.0,"Looks to me like specifically the esperanto version is dangerous. English (.org), German (.de) and French (.fr) sites look good to me.

The download archive seems to be on .org regardless of which language site you're looking at."
explainlikeimfive,ferlsgu,t1_feqmikf,1579355570.0,"Wow what?! That's incredible I didn't know that English butchered those two words.

So I think joke's on you because I actually learned something instead of having wasted time"
