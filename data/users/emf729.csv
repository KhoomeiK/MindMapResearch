It would be 100% a different situation if she, for example, had let the internship finished, written you a letter of recommendation, and given you your certificate as agreed upon, and was now asking for your continued assistance in a different or other position. Perhaps still not an ideal situation, but it would be different.

But that's not what she's doing - she's using the promise of your certificate and a LoR to make you feel like you *have* to meet her unreasonable demands. She's making you feel like if you quit now, you get nothing for all of your work.

And it's a terrible, awful situation with no ""good"" way out, and that's not your fault. But there comes a point where you have to walk away. It doesn't matter how much time you've put in. It's done. You had an awful experience. And if anyone asks why you left, you can very honestly tell them it was a temporary internship. To be honest, no one has ever asked me for a certificate related to a past position. And I assume you have other possible recommenders in the future. In any case, you should look at this as a situation to leave. Cut your losses. LoR be damned- get a new position somewhere else. 

This is *not* normal. This is *not* okay. This is *not* the purpose of an internship. She's a bad boss who's manipulating and using you, your time, and your work for her own benefit without you getting any of the professional benefits you are *absolutely supposed to be getting*. She does not care about your wellbeing, your education, or your professional or personal wellbeing; that's been made clear by the nature and timing of her requests, her refusal to issue your certificate or your LoR, and disregarding the end date of your internship. If you leave, the only reason she'll be angry is that she's lost her professional punching bag.

Please, report her and get yourself out of this situation."

resumes,fe6dgy8,t1_fe56ull,1578887699.0,"As you point out, you're only a freshman. You may absolutely include relevant information from high school. And, quite frankly, I see no reason why the school you attend, which is also the one that's hosting this program, would care where else you were accepted. If you need more help with your specific situation and help getting started, your school probably has a career office that is fully equipped to help in situations like yours. I didn't think I had a full resume, but I did- it turns out I just needed to show the information correctly. I ended up having to cut things out.

More specifically, try using a layout with these categories (name them whatever works for you):

\- Education (quick summary- especially since it's a program at your university. Include your anticipated graduation date, majors/minors, etc.)

\- Relevant courses (here's where you can list courses from your first semester. However, with only 4-6 courses under your belt \[I assume, given you're going into your second semester\] you may be better off just talking about major proejcts)

\- Course projects (this is an incredible section because you can take major papers and projects from your first semester relevant to the program/your application, and basically write them up like your would a job. Summarize and optimize the bullets the same way, and include the course title/semester.) If you can just get two, you'd be able to highlight work you're proud of to make you stand out.

\- Experience (includes any jobs, internships, volunteer roles, etc. You're a freshman, so you can absolutely include positions from high school. This can also include roles in on-campus student organizations!)

\- Skills (any relevant skills- things like softwares you can use, languages you speak, and so on.)

How you order sections and what all you include depends on the specific application. This is something that you work out at the end.

The most important things are optimizing how you use space and how you talk about each position, and tailoring your resume to the program. Your school's career center can almost certainly help you get better at it. Personally, I schedule a resume review prior to every major application, so that I can get advice and make sure I'm putting my best foot forward. You get better at it over time, and it will definitely get easier as you gain more experience over time, too.

In general, your resume will stand out if it's well-crafted and well-tailored. The best way to do that is look at examples, make one on your own, ask for feedback, and improve it."
college,fdzraai,t1_fdzq8hu,1578793969.0,"I'm also a history major. I just very rarely use primary sources that require photos (again, the exception being Frida Kahlo's work). In my experience, most of my professors would be annoyed by a photo that wasn't absolutely necessary and probably wonder why I was spending time I could've been perfecting my paper on looking at pictures. Maybe that's an international difference- or just a difference between universities. But I don't think my professors would give photos positive feedback unless the subject of the photo/picture is what's being analyzed/discussed in the paper."
college,fdzdjdv,t3_enfqs1,1578789206.0,"First, you can't really compare 1-to-1 the curriculum of one US college/university to another, especially in the humanities. Each university has different policies and offerings, and each professor typically designs their own course and the assignments that come with it. It's completely different.

Second, both are extremely common. However, it's also most common to have very explicit instructions on the formatting (ie, 3-4 pages double-spaced pages in 12 point Times New Roman). In my experience, you don't add images to most papers (I've had exactly one paper ever that I included images in, and they were for a discussion of Frida Kahlo's artwork and kinda needed to be there). 

It's basically all up to the professor's discretion. There's also, in my experience, a general understanding that filler text and other ways to ""fudge"" the count are not really acceptable, and can lose you points. Personally, I've never really thought about it much either way- I just write my papers."

Keep in mind summer courses are really expensive, too, and charge by unit, not by semester. You may find it cheaper and easier to take community college courses that satisfy what you want to do. To do that, you'd talk to your advisor, get them pre-approved by the relevant department, and register."
cmu,fdp0hl1,t1_fdj39uq,1578617088.0,"I did not, but I know people who did. In general, I wouldn't be intimidated by IPS courses that are also offered for grad students - most of them count as electives for them, but they're supposed to have additional work to bring it up to a grad level class. I took an IPS class with several master's students as well as a staff member as a freshman, and it wasn't any more challenging for me than other courses and having their perspectives actually helped me get more value out of the class.

In general (I don't count DPAPI in this), it's my understanding that McGovern's classes are reading and writing intensive - after all, he went to law school because he wanted to inform his teaching as a professor, and it definitely does. But (now including DPAPI) he's truly an incredible professor overall, makes things super interesting, explains them really well, and wants his students to succeed. He's offered a spring mini every year I've been there though so if you are worried now, you can probably take a class with him next year.

And, for what it's worth, in terms of experience writing in a certain discipline, the only way you're really going to get it is... doing it in a course related to that discipline. I wouldn't let that stop you- just be aware of it, and ask for feedback when you don't understand things, and don't be afraid to reach out to the GCC and other sources of help when you're struggling with something new!"

I can understand being annoyed when canvassers come to the door, but I offered a very simple, fairly all-encompassing solution in hanging a no trespassing sign. Canvassing is a surprisingly effective way to fundraise for a nonprofit, though I can't speak on outcomes for religious groups and for-profit companies. You have a level of anger about it and desire for violence and harm against ""door ringers"" that I simply don't understand, that goes past annoyance. I don't really understand that level of anger, nor do I *want* to understand why you'd have any desire to hurt someone you don't even know.

pittsburgh,fdcuirg,t3_ekjms8,1578284694.0,"A note on ""no soliciting"" signs: I canvass for a nonprofit and, in training, we are told we can ignore them if we choose, since we work for a nonprofit and aren't actually soliciting. Don't know how it works with religious organizations, though. That being said, we are NOT allowed to ignore no trespassing signs and cannot knock those doors. Definitely recommend getting a no trespassing sign. Tell them that you'll call the cops next time they trespass on your property. To really seal the deal you might get a security camera (real or fake) and point it at your door. And, if necessary, follow through. (And, as a canvasser, I can tell you that we definitely won't come back after you tell us no until the next round of your neighborhood \[six months apart\], because it's a waste of our work time. Don't know how religious recruitment people see it, though.)

Edit: I will add that I've never checked the actual specific laws about no soliciting signs, and I personally don't knock those doors, but if it's true, the JWs may also be allowed to ignore those signs. But without your consent, they can't ignore the no trespassing signs!"
cmu,fczhhq1,t3_ejlsqi,1578101363.0,"I tried taking four summer classes once (2 session 1, 1 session 2, 1 summer all; one was research). Definitely my worst semester QPA at CMU ever. (I've also now done an intensive summer course at Pitt, which was another lesson in managing my expectations for myself.) I think it can be really easy to very quickly bite off more than you can chew. I would take one summer 1 and one summer 2 course, or 2 summer all courses.

Courses are held almost every day (or every day), and there are fewer people in each class. They're very fast-paced, and they have both more in-class hours and more homework than a semester class. There's a reason taking more is overloading- it's not only hard, it's stressful and all-consuming. Summer course offerings, depending on the department, also fluctuate greatly and can be cancelled before the term starts. I wouldn't plan on taking specific courses until the schedule comes out. Also, in my experience, more grad students teach summer courses than during the normal school year. You can look at the summer 2019 schedule for an idea of what might be offered and for an idea of how many classes got cancelled last summer, and who taught the classes that were offered. However, depending on department, it varies wildly from year to year.

The schedule for a semester comes out three weeks before registration opens, so check when summer registration is, figure out when the schedule comes out, and you'll be able to see anticipated offerings, time slots, sessions, and probably who's teaching it. If I were you, I'd make a list of as many courses as possible to meet requirements that you might be able to take in the meantime, then narrow it down with the schedule in front of you. You might want to think about using the summer to fill gen ed or elective requirements rather than core courses for your major(s), too, since they'd have more than one course that could work, and it could give you more options and flexibility.

Campus is also definitely more quiet during the summer. There are a *lot* of touring students, a number of high school students on campus for the pre-college program, and many places on campus have terrible hours. (Pittsburgh is also super humid and hot in the summer. I'm from here, but it's terrible in the summer and that's something to keep in mind.) But it's way easier to find a nice, quiet place to study and kinda neat to be able to explore places you haven't before on campus when they're mostly empty. Most resources are definitely still around, and there are special events and things designed for students who are around in the summer, but it's nowhere near as busy, there's fewer events, and I don't think many, if any, extracurricular activities run during the summer."

cmu,fc24esr,t3_efqk6l,1577339973.0,"You are assigned a day. Seniors are Monday, grad students Tuesday, juniors Wednesday, and down the line. Within that, you are assigned a random time. Your initial registration time (as in, registering over the summer for your freshman fall) will determine the order, but you cycle through times. They're generally blocks within late afternoon, afternoon, late morning, and morning. Everyone is assigned a time (I think they're in ten minute intervals). You can find more info about this in the course catalog! (It's a really great resource overall, and I highly recommend exploring it a bit for your program/college and for general university information.) The schedule comes out 3 weeks prior to course registration, and you can start planning your schedule after it's released. You will also be able to see your assigned registration date/time on SIO, though it might not be immediately available.

When you design your course schedule in SIO, you will have some information relevant to registration. You'll be able to see how many seats are available in that class, if you could get in based on your own characteristics (I'll explain in a minute), and how many people are on the waitlist. You will also see if there are reserved spots. 

Reserved spots are those characteristics I was talking about. Basically, to make sure you are more likely to get a class you need/want, spots are reserved for people based on things like college, department, and year. So, for example, if you want to take Elementary French 2, you may find that there are spots reserved for freshmen, modern languages students, and music students. Those spots are saved for students meeting those criteria, but any unused spots will be used to automatically fill in from the waitlist after registration. I am not sure when that happens exactly. So, in a 25 seat class with 10 reserved seats, if none of them are used, 10 seats will open up off the waitlist. Seats will also open up when someone drops the class, for example. Large courses may have

You can register for up to 5 waitlists at a time. You can see where you are on the waitlist at any time. You can also remove yourself from a waitlist at any time. If a spot becomes available for you, you will be automatically registered if you have the units free to do so, and receive an email letting you know that you've been registered. If a spot becomes available, you will receive an email giving you a date/time to register by, or you lose your spot. I got one last week with a deadline of January 3, so in my experience, it's a fairly generous amount of time!

If you are stuck on a waitlist, in many cases, you may be able to get in before the registration deadline. You have two weeks at the start of the semester to add a class. If you really want/need a class, it's typically recommended to reach out to the professor and go to class. I can only speak for Dietrich, but that's the advice I've received every time I've been on a waitlist. Definitely talk to your advisor about waitlists!

Many classes will *always* have waitlists, and some are impossible to get off of. This includes in-demand, very small CFA courses, for example, like Acting for Non-Majors and photography classes.

Some courses will require prior permission to register for. If you're interested in one of these, I'd look at who it tells you to talk to, reach out to them, and try talking to your advisor, too.

Some courses have pre-reqs. You will be blocked from taking a class without the pre-req until you have received a waiver for it. You generally go through your advisor for that.

For your first registration, I can't remember *exactly* how it works, but you'll still get a date/time- it'll just be over the summer, not this spring. That means everyone who is a current student gets to register first, and some courses will be full. Also, as a freshman, you will need to take the Freshman 5 courses this year. (If you're not a freshman, I apologize for the assumption!)

My personal methodology for registration is to figure out what courses/requirements I'm trying to take, and list all of the offerings that meet those requirements. Then I figure out which ones I want to take, and make a sample schedule. I also have a couple of backup options for each course, if I can. It's very common to end up on waitlists when you register, and very common to get *off* of those waitlists. 

Hope that helped! Definitely check out the course catalog, make a list of courses you're interested in, and talk to your advisor about them before registration."

I'd say I wish I had a credit card, because they're generally more secure for international travel, but I never really used it out anyway- I typically would get out as much cash as an ATM would let me at a time to avoid paying fees. This was especially helpful because it meant paying faster at restaurants, and I would have cash with me when we went to markets and things. I struggled with my numbers in Russian when I left so I also found that having to think on the spot about how much money to give the cashier helped, actually. I did use it sometimes- generally, if we went somewhere with an order kiosk that didn't take cash."
