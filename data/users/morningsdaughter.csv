There are essentially three types of laws in the Old Testament. Purity laws which only apply to the Jews. Civil laws that only apply to the Jews and people living in Jewish towns. And Moral laws, laws that apply to all people all the time. Homosexuality is considered a moral law under Biblical standards. Pork falls under Purity laws. Christians aren't Jews. They don't follow Jewish purity or civil laws. But they do follow moral law, because those things are wrong for all time and all people.

vaxxhappened,ff7wkm0,t1_fehrq9z,1579660069.0,"This is what people did before vaccines were around. Some diseases are much more dangerous if you get them in adulthood but generally mild in childhood. Exposing your children to them when they were young was done to protect them. The vaccine for Chickenpox wasn't released until the late 90s. So most adults alive today couldn't get vaccinated for it. Chicken pox was definitely less risky to get as a child and common enough that you were most certainly going to get it at some point. So to protect their children people would try to get them to contract the disease when it was most safe for them to get it. We don't have to do that now in the US because we have an available vaccine, like you mentioned before. However, the UK and many other countries still don't consider that vaccine necessary and many parents still try to care for their children by trying to make sure they get the sickness during childhood o they don't die as prematurely.

I'm not an antivaxxer. I think it's important to realize why people do what they do. People rarely do things to their children because they want them to be harmed. And it's hard to convince people to believe you in the same breath you're vilifying them with. They know they don't hate their children or want them to come to harm, any statement they hear that says that can be dismissed because at least that part is untrue.

Furthermore, women are not commanded to marry third rapists, but rather rapists are required to marry third victims which would require them to pay for their care. Women could reject the match and remain in their father's house. 

Also, if you look into the context of language you'd see that ""rape"" means any unallowed sex. Any sex outside of marriage would be considered rape. That's why the law clarifies if a woman cries out or not; in other words, if she consents or not. 

Eve isn't solely blamed for the ""downfall of humanity."" Adam got punished right along side her to equal degrees.

Most churches have a nice auditorium or chapel they will rent you for the day. Universities often have spaces that are perfect for weddings and surprisingly affordable. 

And there are a lot of ways to make weddings cheaper. Like instead of having a full dinner reception, have it earlier in the day and serve hors d'oeuvre instead. Skip save the dates and send out your invitations earlier. Print invitations on Vistaprint or mpix or other cheap online printers that don't make all their money off weddings. Check on Etsy for favors or DIY something or skip favors although. Skip the embossed napkins and expensive flower centerpieces. A lot of things can be skipped over because no one is going to notice or remember them anyways, not even you. 

Honestly, the $30k ""average"" is not a real statistic. The industry publishes that number to convince people to spend more money. The number isn't based on any actual weddings. The way they calculate that average is by averaging out the offered prices for each wedding service and adding them together. So if they see photography packages for $30000, $1000, and $2000 then they say the average price for photography packages is $11000 and that number gets added onto their total.

It's pretty clear from the first sentence of the second paragraph that he sends them TOS at first contact before the booking process begins, because he says he does it to inform them of the booking process. Deposits are paid at booking, not at first contact. 

You can't book him without receiving a copy of the TOS because you need them to find out how to book his services."
