AskReddit,ffg9ypk,t1_fffqjq2,1579901644.0,"Men are falling significantly behind in earning college degrees compared to women in the US, and with 99% of new jobs created since the recession going to those with a college education, there's a huge economic problem for males looming on the horizon. 

Men who feel economically marginalized are more likely to cling to other forms of the masculine identity, like violence(if you can't be a provider, you can at least be a protector). This means an increase in firearms ownership, which means much greater chance of successfully commiting suicide (economically insecure men are much more likely to own/purchase firearms). In the US anyway, women are more likely to attempt suicide, but men are VASTLY more likely to be successful, mostly due to the use of firearms as the method.

For all the talk of closing the gender pay gap and improving women's chances in the workforce(which are valid), there's not nearly enough talk about the drastic increase in uneducated males who are being left behind in the economy of the future."

I do love my HID's, don't really care about pissing off oncoming traffic though. The fog 'steering' lights are neat but kinda gimmicky imo, there's zero functionality beyond toggling the fogs. If you have your fogs on, it does nothing, vs the steering headlights actually adding value. Took me 2 years to even notice the fog 'steering'. Would happily take the steering LED's. 

I didn't love the factory wheels. Any 18"" wheels are less than ideal for me. Mine are collecting dust in my garage in lieu of some 17"" Methods so I can fit real all terrain rubber in the wheel wells. 

Went with Weather Tech floor mats all around, so floor mats don't really add value to me either.

Totally down to a preference thing, I wish I would've been able to wait for the '18 but my old Outback was on it's last legs and I needed to trade it in while it was still worth something lol one thing I LOVE about the Gen6 is room for a full size spare!!

As for adhesion, that can be frustrating at first. You need your bed leveled properly, AND need your nozzle the proper distance from the bed. If you're printing straight on the glass, you'll need it heated up. If you're using the tape that came with the printer, shouldn't need heat. Can try purple glue stick on the glass as well to help it stick down. 

One frustrating aspect of cheap Chinese printers can be cheap Chinese components. A lot of people (myself included) got very warped glass from the factory, which made properly levelling the entire bed more or less impossible. The easy solution is to go to a hardware chain like Home Depot or Lowe's and pick up a pack of 12""x12"" mirror tiles as replacement beds. Roughly the same size as the factory bed, and much flatter."

If you MUST, and know you're accepting 100% of the blame if/when your CVT pukes it's guts out and you're prepared to drop a few grand on a new one, there are a couple options. 

Cheaper and safer*: get something like the Pedal Commander that intercepts and sends it's own throttle signal. It won't give you more horsepower, but it will make what power is there a lot more responsive and snappy. 

Expensive and very dicey: go full NA/T and strap on a bunch of WRX turbo bits for a significant boost in power, have fun while it lasts. There's a Facebook group (NA/T Subarus) that has all the info you need to do it. 

Any way you go (including leaving it bone stock), I'd advise installing a tranny cooler to help prolong the life of the CVT. It's pretty simple and not expensive at all as a DIY. I put one in my stoxky '17 3.6r and the TR690 CVT in them are fairly tough, cheap insurance policy."

Nobody should be forced to have a relationship with someone they don't want to, but an emotionally healthy/mature person wouldn't be rubbing their life in that person's face at the same time and gloating about hurting them.

Living things try to be as lazy as possible, all the way down to the cellular level (one could argue it's called efficiency, but for the sake of this discussion/modern sedentary lifestyles, we'll call it laziness). 

Your body desperately tries to use as little resources as possible, this includes maintenance. If you're not actively stressing your body systems (muscles, lungs, heart, etc) your body will believe it's over spending in those areas, metabolically speaking. It will keep cutting back on spending until those systems start experiencing stress and that becomes the new maintenance floor. 

It feels costly to run because you taught your body that it doesn't need the ability to run(aka: excess cardiovascular capacity beyond basic metabolic needs), and it reduced all those systems in response.

And even so, most people who don't drink are perfectly fine not drinking and pretending like it's some awful curse you have to help them overcome is super awkward and condescending. 

If someone says they don't drink, your only response should be, Ok, cool. Anything else I can get you?"

AskReddit,fcvwr0y,t1_fcuww2o,1578011847.0,"Ding ding ding!! My first job out of college was a solid paying, contract QA gig at a corporate photography company. Literally sitting in a windowless room taking pictures of a mannequin all day and being forced to dress business casual to boot. It was absolutely soul sucking. By the end of it I was barely doing my job and mostly doodling all day. Once the contract expired I got a contract QA job at Activision for $9 an hour, way less than half of what I made at the other place. I could wear what I wanted, got to hang out with people like me(not 'Hey how are ya' boring SpongeBob types), and work on games. Yeah, the games sucked, yeah there were 80 hour weeks, but it was in GAMES. Once the Activision contract expired I did another month stint at the corporate place, banked up as much money as I could, and landed a job as a game designer a couple months later. Never looked/looking back. Have zero interest in being a part of the 'traditional' corporate thing. Keep your slacks and polos, I'm more than happy in the trenches making games"

If you've gone this long without attempting therapy/working on yourself, you're CHOOSING to be the way you are. You and your wife need to work on your communication/relationship, and you need to get into some therapy for your social anxiety.

The other thing to think about is tongue weight rating and the weight ratings of your accessories. A 2"" attachment is going to be rated for more weight than a 1 1/4"" one. The class 2 hitches are basically for bike racks. Class 3 is way more versatile"

This isn't specific to the outdoor industry, but it talks about various materials including animal derived and synthetics (aka, plastic that is fossil fuel derived). A good note is that synthetics aren't biodegradable and may contribute to micro plastic pollution. PFC's would be another aspect to look out for, as they're commonly used in waterproofing and are potent environmental toxins. Many companies are beginning to offer PFC-free coatings finally"
