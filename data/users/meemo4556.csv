What it sounds like would be best for you is you should have a NAS with 2 drives in RAID 1, and then an offline copy (or 2) plus a cloud backup if possible. Synology and qnap are good out of the box ready to use units, but if you want a little more value and are willing to build a machine, head over to serverbuilds.net"
