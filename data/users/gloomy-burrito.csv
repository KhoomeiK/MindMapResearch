Unless you are willing to do all the work and try to help her figure out her shit you’ll be so worn out by the time you do (if you do help her get over it somehow) and if you can’t help boom you’ve wasted another chunk of your time like before."

relationship_advice,ffag2a9,t1_ff8ln9i,1579734913.0,Yes 100% similar situation here.
relationship_advice,ffafz83,t3_es8jy7,1579734855.0,"Hello, I went through something similar and my advice is, talk to her and let her know how you feel.

From the victim’s perspective, at least in my situation I am always super clear about when I do and don’t want to be touched because I get random episodes where the fear and pain come back and I just need to not be touched at all. I try to make it super clear with whoever I’m dating.
It’s hard because sometimes (like my dumb ex for example) people take it too personally and it makes you feel bad but honestly just being able to talk about it and make things clear is the best thing you can do. Which is what me and my current boyfriend did and things are great!"
AskMen,ffaffe6,t3_esdvhi,1579734476.0,I always hated when a guy I was dating would touch my belly fat or try to grab or play with it. It made me really uncomfortable. But with my new bf idk why it’s totally different. I don’t care at all and I never slap his hands away or cover my belly. I think it’s because I know he actually really loves my body and my as a person. I didn’t feel that with the other people.

needadvice,fehqrcc,t3_ep878i,1579122003.0,"she thinks you were masturbating in the shower, which most moms frown upon because how can their precious little baby do something so vile. 

anyway if you were wanking it in the shower hopefully this was your wake up call to not forget your phone,

i once forgot my pocket vibrator in the shower and my mom pretended she didn't see it, that was worse than her saying anything at all. 

anyway good luck."

relationship_advice,feagjkt,t3_eo78ef,1578948493.0,"If I told a dude I needed room and was treating him this way it’s probably because I wanna break up but I don’t have the balls to do it because he’s probably a nice dude .

Anyways with that being said u deserve a lot better my dude! You’ll be fine ."
offmychest,fe9xwex,t3_eo4j99,1578942421.0,"I started going to therapy after I finally left my abusive cheating ex. I knew that when it was over and he was gone I was gonna fall into that pit of depression I usually fell into and beg for him back like I normally did. But there was something about this last time , i knew I had to do something and I managed to seek out help and find a therapist.

She was the same. Would tell me things I’d never thought about before and I started learning that I was worth more than I had been beaten down to believe.

Unfortunately she had to close her practice because she wasn’t making enough money which I understood because she was so great she wouldn’t charge her clients very much because she genuinely wanted to help and cared about that more than money. I couldn’t afford it when I began seeing her and she let me continue the sessions at a very low fee. 

I learned a lot from her and she helped me so much. I wish I could still call her or email and tell her about my day or how I need help. 

I can feel myself slowly start slipping down again sometimes but I am with someone new now that really cares about me and doesn’t let me fall. 

Anyways yes therapy is awesome and if any of you have been thinking about it this is your sign. Go.  Find.   Yourself.  A.  Therapist."

TrueCrime,fdsmzlj,t1_fdsh1uy,1578705338.0,"This is very very early in the show. It was mostly comments and jokes he’d make about women. Which I found totally offensive and dumb . He’s totally changed now .

Damn I sound like a gf defending her shitty bf lmao

“No guys he’s really changed now, he only calls me fat and ugly because he love me!” xD"
TrueCrime,fds7vnu,t3_emvgs0,1578696350.0,"I felt the same at first but now I love them, I really hated Henry I thought he was a stupid idiot trying too hard and too loud , I also hated Ben because he was sexist and had really dumb and bland views on everything. 

How and why did I keep listening? Well honestly I needed background noise while working at my shop . 

Eventually I would find myself stopping and trying to hear Marcus’ detailed explanation of the subject they were on and I kept laughing at Henry’s stupid jokes and impressions. 

I noticed over time that their episodes became more organized and each dude seemed to create an actual role in the podcast and it didn’t seem like a scrambled loud mess. 

Also MyFavoriteMurder’s Karen and Georgia had good things to say about them so that also made me give them a chance because I’m a huge fan of theirs too."
