RandomKindness,ff894d6,t1_ff7wqrn,1579669633.0,Yes! Research the area you'll be visiting and find the trails that suit your fitness level and ease of use. I live in So Cal and there's a dedicated subreddit for hiking in it and I'm sure there are equally great resources for most regions of the country. Or find the nearest REI and ask the people working there what's close.
cats,ff7y2c8,t3_es4vpl,1579661086.0,Totally worth it.
RandomKindness,ff7we55,t3_es4b7l,1579659947.0,I've never hiked anything that didn't make me happier for having hiked it but I can't ship you a hill or mountain. Maybe find something close?
banjo,ff7w5tk,t3_es4o9p,1579659790.0,I'm a bassist that has played for decades. I decided to learn a new instrument and bought a Washburn b9-wsh-a to learn on. If you've played bass long enough you'll know that trying to learn a new instrument on something hard to play is disheartening and not a good motivator to play. I ended up getting a Deering Artisan Special after a month with the Washburn. My advice is to spend as much as you can and get something good. They don't seem to lose value all that much so look at it like an investment.

socalhiking,fewka73,t3_eqqrzz,1579412480.0,The switchbacks below the Notch were sketchy a week and a half ago and we got another couple inches this week. I had microspikes but there were spots where I could have used snowshoes and some spots where I should have had crampons so I turned back right before the last switchback. That drop is steep. I haven't been up since then though.
