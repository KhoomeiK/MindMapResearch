TrollXChromosomes,ffe37s8,t3_et2y9p,1579835524.0,"Hmm one small tip, if you do get talking about it, take references to gender out of what you say to your non-conforming child. Like instead of ""when women undergo puberty"" make it like ""when people with ovaries/people with our kinds of bodies/people with 2 X chromosomes/people including yourself etc..."". 

If your kid doesn't identify with women they might just tune out the moment you put gender into the equation

Edit: another thought: also affirm that a changing body doesn't affect your identity/who you are as a person. Affirm that you still see your kid the same way and their friends won't (or shouldn't either). The period is just something we go through and deal with, like pooping or whatever."
