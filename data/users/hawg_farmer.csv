EatCheapAndHealthy,ffaqprw,t1_ffaevlb,1579742262.0,"It's really good to ask questions. Especially just starting out. I just noticed part of your delivered meat weight includes soup bones. You might want to factor of that in. Soup bones are awesome, but if y'all have HEB then you probably have ethnic markets around. Our Hispanic market has bones for sale about every other day. They're really reasonable price wise. Our Asian markets are about an hour away and they have really nice meat cuts usually reasonably priced. Ask around. If you find a packing house you like ask questions, lots of questions. Tell them what you are wanting to do. They will help you figure out cuts that will suit your family and budget. If you want your money to go as far as possible they will suggest different cuts or perhaps a different size of package. We get our hamburger packed in #3/4 and #2 tubes because it suits our family needs better. If I can help you out let me know."

EatCheapAndHealthy,ff9tj6a,t3_esfu4d,1579720941.0,"I can't tell you which way to buy meat for your family. But as a farmer the weight really depends on where the butcher cow comes from. As an example, if your butcher beef comes from a feedlot those weights another user  posted would be about right. We pasture and grain our cows right on our farms so we will let them get heavier if it isn't wasting feed. Wasting feed means they may have a lot of fat to trim off, not marbled throughout the meat. Have your tried calling a local butcher/packing house? I know we have people that will drive several hours round trip to use our local packing house to buy their meat. Our family has been blessed, 40+ years and never had a complaint about how they cut or packaged it. Which brings me to another point. If you have a small family pay attention to how it is packaged. Your meat will last way longer in the freezer if it's vacuum sealed.  Some packers will use saran wrap then wrap that in the famous white butcher paper. You will need to be careful to not tear the wrapper or the meat will freezer burn. Just my opinion."

Trust me the last thing I want to do is have to go into town and get 1200# of salt and minerals, 50 fence posts, a roll of wire then wrestle that beast into a parking spot to get toilet paper and juice boxes. We have single cabs that might haul all that, we have 3/4 tons that can but I can't get two legal kid's car seats and a booster in those. So off we go in the one we all share.  We're not running around in a brodozer, it's necessary to farm. Also may I add I don't have enough money to waste on ""rolling coal and smoking tires."" I'm going to do business then right back in the farm shop that truck goes."

It's ok if the discount is applied it's also ok if it's not. When I was married we were both active duty and would never think of stiffing a server. Everyone has to make a living, milking it because she's a dependa is abhorrent."

Cheap_Meals,fcwn4nx,t3_ejaty5,1578030377.0,If you are in U.S. call 211. It's to connect you with resources available in your area. In my area United Way is the one that operates this. They will hook you up with a food pantry near you or resources to help y'all through a rough patch. Once you go to the pantry you will have a much better idea of meal possibilities. There also may be free meals available on set days in our area there's 2 a week. Another opportunity to have more ingredients for stew or stir fry.
