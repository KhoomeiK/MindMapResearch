The policy was presented to the public as a ""zero tolerance"" approach intended to deter illegal immigration and to encourage tougher legislation.[1][2][3][4] It was adopted across the entire US–Mexico border from April 2018 until June 2018.[5][6][7] However, later investigations found that the practice of family separations had begun a year prior to the public announcement.[8] Under the policy, federal authorities separated children from parents or guardians with whom they had entered the US.[6][9][10] The adults were prosecuted and held in federal jails, and the children placed under the supervision of the US Department of Health and Human Services.[6]

>By early June 2018, it emerged that the policy did not include measures to reunite the families that it had separated.[11][12] This created a child migration crisis.[13][14] Following national and international criticism,[15][16][17][18][19][20] on June 20, 2018, President Trump signed an executive order ending family separations at the border.[21][22][23] On June 26, 2018, US District Judge Dana Sabraw of the US District Court for the Southern District of California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against the family separation policy and ordered that all children be reunited with their parents within 30 days.[24][25]"

Our Senate is “attempting” to destroy the constitution. We are in danger. If you aren’t worried you should be. Or to quote the ol saw, “if when all about you others are losing their heads, but you are keeping yours, you probably don’t know what the fuck is going on."

Our only hope for justice is winning in November and It’s barely a 50/50 chance.

Because calling one of America’s most prosperous cities a shit filled hellhole is literally a sentiment I’ve never heard before Fox decided to use it to smear Pelosi and the rest of California that leans Left. Nothing more anti-American in 2020 being pro-Trump."

Which is it, either you can’t afford to live there because demand is so high, (so many people want to live there) or it’s a garbage pit?

But all the Republican districts are surely utopias that are definitely not gripped with meth and opioid epidemics, not to mention an epidemic of blinding ignorance that says it’s patriotic to support a pathological lying traitor who sells his country out to all takers.

That said, ~85% of Republicans, moderates and all, support Trump, so it wouldn’t be too much of a leap to assume you also support him."
PoliticalHumor,fgg5kep,t1_fgg44q7,1580754721.0,"So if you only believe the truth then you have to disbelieve him multiple times every single day because he averages fifteen lies a day.

But I do think that everyone on the national stage, from Bernie and AOC to moderates like Pete and Schiff needs to start repeatedly calling out Fox for the propaganda. All the well spoken and profound truths in the world won’t matter until we make Fox synonymous with lies and propaganda.
