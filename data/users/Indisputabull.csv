A few things happened in a quick succession that made me change. The first event was this; I was a senior medic in the Armed forces and my PA who was like my mentor and a man I respect an immense amount pulled me aside and told me I smelled like alcohol, I was mortified but that alone didn’t make me change. It also took me coming to terms with my depression at the time and finding hobbies to replace the drinking to get me to want to change, and once I really wanted it I was able to stop. I’ve been sober now since 2014 and I no longer even think about alcohol it’s so low on my priority list it might as well not even exist."

My spouse is a teacher and one boy at the school (fifth grade) was being bullied so bad he stopped eating for days, and tried to kill himself. The administration was aware of this going on for months, and there are dozens of other instances like this a lot involving the same bully and still nothing was done. Just pushed it under the rug until some angry dads came to cave the principal’s head in when they found out what was going on. Then the boy was simply put in a different class, no punishment given whatsoever, and he still had access to his previous victims and a whole new class of kids."
