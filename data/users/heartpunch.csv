Don't fall into this trap. This is how you become a high-volume piece of shit attorney. Take a couple of cases to learn a little bit about the field, and be honest with your clients about your experience if they ask. Run a few cases out and see what happens. 

After you've handled a couple, then you'll know a little more about the field, and you'll be able to tell your wife (and potential clients) ""you know, I really feel bad about what's happened to your family. It's tragic. But...""

With discipline, you can probably get down to a healthy weight in about three months. That’s fine. Start now.

Do not take drastic weight-cutting measures. No sauna suits or skipping eating for days or spitting in cups or any of that other bullshit high school wrestlers do. 

Clean diet. Portion control. Discipline.

On top of that, work the fundamentals of wrestling. Pick a couple of moves from each position, and drill those. Drill, drill, drill. Don’t worry about developing obscure moves. Just the basics. I’d suggest working on developing a double leg takedown.

You can do it, but it’s going to be a lot of work. You’ll be better for it."
