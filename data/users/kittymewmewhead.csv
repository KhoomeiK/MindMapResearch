StarWars,fcwfcwp,t3_eiz785,1578024190.0,"Probably the most impressive things about these two movies are visuals and special effects.

It would have been a lot more awesome if the stories were the same quality."
aww,fcwegbo,t3_ej4fao,1578023551.0,Seems like one eyed cats are very popular at the rescues. Local rescue had two of them and they were adopted two days after they arrived. Silly me... I thought I had plenty of time to get at least one of them

StarWars,fctk3as,t3_eirrtl,1577946107.0,"They really missed an opportunity to at least acknowledge that Ben and chewy had a relationship prior to his fall to the dark side.


It reminds me of the force awakens when Leia totally walks by Chewie after Han's death and instead hugs Ray like she's her long-lost daughter??

Chewie got downgraded to just a background character along with C-3PO and R2D2"
