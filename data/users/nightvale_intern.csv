fatlogic,fdtesc4,t1_fdt8o4b,1578715722.0,"Well, FAs would also have an issue with all of your examples. They'd say you are ""moralizing"" weight and therefore ""contributing to weight stigma.""

I don't think there is anything wrong with being considerate of other people's feelings, if possible. However I think the point is that it doesn't really matter how you say it, you're never going to win."

fatlogic,fdlfzgr,t3_em00tr,1578523201.0,I park faaar away from the store just to avoid people vulture-circling the front hoping to get a spot. I'm usually inside and doing my shopping before they even find a spot to park.
fatlogic,fdlcvqe,t3_elv4y5,1578521318.0,The comments on the article just make me sad.
antiMLM,fdfshlh,t3_el4k06,1578369097.0,This seems like a trap. I bet there are huns strategically placed in the store to descend upon you if you show any interest in the display.
antiMLM,fdcw91c,t1_fdcepxp,1578286135.0,You end up fucked by the time its over anyway.
antiMLM,fdc4y8o,t3_ekjyvu,1578267195.0,"I assume by ""therapies"" they mean ""slathering your germ-ridden children in overpriced, smelly oil.""

You should go and sit in the front row while dramatically rolling your eyes and loudly sighing through the whole thing."
antiMLM,fdc469l,t3_ekkpih,1578266760.0,"Does anyone remember, back in the 80s, when CEOs would randomly call people in the phone book and beg for money? Me neither."
fatlogic,fdc0pew,t1_fdbuq03,1578264861.0,"No, because fat men are just lazy and choose to be fat. Its only genetically predetermined and uncontrollable for women. /s"
fatlogic,fdc0ach,t1_fdbzrzz,1578264639.0,Norovirus is fatphobic!
fatlogic,fd5otx3,t3_ek282h,1578179796.0,"I see the whole anti-BMI thing a lot, but what I don't see are any fat people buying calipers to measure their BF% and posting the results to ""invalidate"" BMI as a tool."
antiMLM,fctk4lb,t1_fctd3kk,1577946147.0,"If the size of your house also increases with the size of the person, that would go a long way in explaining why the obesity epidemic and obsession with McMansions happened at roughly the same time."
fatlogic,fcomarj,t3_eiab47,1577835809.0,I can feel the hypocrisy washing over me.
fatlogic,fcom2d5,t3_eia52y,1577835638.0,"I mean it could be, and everyone brace yourselves for this leap in logic, due to the risk factors associated with being fat in the first place.

Where do I pick up my Nobel Prize in medicine?"
fatlogic,fcm4chx,t1_fclr6vj,1577763909.0,"Deliberately disingenuous is the perfect descriptor for them. At best, the arguments they attempt to make are based on willful ignorance. Research (which they so love to cite incorrectly) operationally defines both overweight and obese. Furthermore, I'll go out on a limb and say the ICD does as well."
antiMLM,fckw3ba,t1_fckqajg,1577734449.0,"Exactly. Even if in the top 4%, they are still likely losing money, maybe just a little more slowly than the people beneath them that they are scamming."
antiMLM,fcjepj8,t3_ehhi72,1577684942.0,"Even assuming she truly is in the ""top 4%"" as she claims, people fall into two main categories from what I can tell: the individuals taken advantage of, and those taking advantage of others. The only way to get to the top 4% would be to do the latter and that is still a valid reason not to support the MLM model in any way. Though, statistically speaking, she is likely just lying and falls into the first category instead."
antiMLM,fcjecvs,t3_ehhtzz,1577684614.0,"Totally disgusting. For what its worth, I hope things have gotten better for you, and I'm not trying to sell you useless shit."
antiMLM,fcihkq9,t3_ehb5ug,1577662667.0,"Tbh when anyone refers to themselves as an influencer, I involuntarily roll my eyes."
fatlogic,fch1yfc,t1_fch1cg3,1577646496.0,Cis means your self-perception of gender matches your biological sex. I am a gay cis man.
fatlogic,fbifeuz,t1_fbi2bk2,1576899430.0,This would be amazing if it weren't so sad.
