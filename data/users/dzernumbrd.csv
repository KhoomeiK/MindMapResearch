The other thing I think is that 1% isn't really a true reflection of our citizen's emissions.

Australia has exported its entire manufacturing sector to China.

Everything in every shop says ""Made in China"" because Australia wants cheaply manufactured goods.

The cheapness comes at an environmental cost though because if China does nothing to stop carbon then Australian consumption of their goods pushes up greenhouse gas production.

Australia instead chooses to point our finger at China and say ""Bad China! You are the big polluter, not us!"" while at the same time loading up on goods at the shop that are made in China."

I think that high '99 valuation came from it being a semi-tech company at the time.

Any stock that was even slightly tech related was getting stupidly optimistic valuations.

Either way, Telstra is never going to be  a great company to buy for share price growth.

If you have a company that has a $45 billion market valuation, then to go up 100% in share price you need to double its valuation to be $90 billion.

If you have a company that has a $4.5 million market cap, then to go up 100% in share price you need to double its valuation to be $9 million.

When you are already a dominant player, it is much harder for a large company to add $45 billion to your company's value than a small company finding a niche area to operate and adding $4.5 million to its value.
