HomeImprovement,ffbafh5,t1_ffba4uq,1579757359.0,Less than I see on FedEx sorting center signs begging for employees.  And that’s not even out in the weather and probably has better benefits.
dogswithjobs,ff87xel,t1_ff87qwv,1579668573.0,"I work from home exclusively and for the first two or three months my dogs would hang out in the room with me and nap there. Now they don’t care at all, they just hang out on their couch and my bed. And at 12:01 exactly everyday one shows up and begs for her walk."
mildlyinteresting,ff87m2t,t1_ff7hmh3,1579668301.0,My cairn terrier leveled about 20 yards of dirt with a couple hours of effort a week in a year. I should have charged for his effort... and used it to buy more cookies.
knitting,ff6stio,t1_ff6qhi8,1579634154.0,I wouldn’t have thought there was one in my area but someone mentioned it and it’s just a few miles from me. Never hurts to look!
knitting,ff6fhe6,t1_ff6axcq,1579626058.0,"I can say with 100% certainty I’ve never used a suggested yarn. The color choices of my FO’s reflect this lack of follow through. 

But I just buy what i see is a good deal/in a color I like and find a pattern later. There’s plenty of yarns and patterns, no need to get hung up about it."
knitting,ff6fbvc,t1_ff6ei2u,1579625962.0,"If you have a craft recycle store near you, I’ve found some skeins where you just know someone finally accepted they weren’t going to use this load of fancy fingering weight and while it’s not exactly cheap for a sq, it’s knit picks pricing for some pretty nice yarn. It’s just a toss up if they have what you’re looking for."

beholdthemasterrace,fekkl3d,t1_fekb55h,1579201995.0,"Nah, Montgomery isn’t rural enough. Rednecks hang out where they can put a trailer on their acres.    

Redneck is more of a trans-geography culture than a southern one. I’m in the Midwest and could name a half dozen people I went to high school with that have taken close replicas of this photo."

dogs,fe6jfsa,t1_fe60bku,1578892857.0,There’s one near me that is a dog park/bar/restaraunt but it’s also no dogs inside. The startup idea was a bar in a warehouse which was stupid cold on the concrete in winter (my dogs didn’t appreciate it) but the current version doesn’t allow dogs indoors because the health department wouldn’t allow it with food.
dogs,fe6j75w,t3_enz28p,1578892624.0,"You can always get a leash wrap like this: https://etsy.me/2R6pJaE. It won’t help with the smallest kids, if they stick a hand out while walking by (and I’m not sure the legalities of it “you acknowledged your dog is dangerous” if the worst ever happens and they bite someone, but I think a muzzle could be on the same level there)"

FinancialPlanning,fd4vs1c,t1_fd4su81,1578171541.0,"The problem with a lot of those brands is you don’t necessarily save that much used if they’re only a few years old, and then you won’t have a warranty either.  If you’re the kind to keep cars for a while, look at a newer model just to see what’s out there. If there are any 2018 or 2019 models left on a lot, you could probably get a killer deal. Also - Subaru’s I would not get too old as when they need maintenance, it’s usually big... and pricey. 

I didn’t realize how much time maintenance took until I bought new and I haven’t had any maintenance to deal with except routine oil changes. It just works, all the time. No “this will only take 15 minute” fixes. No two hundred bucks here or there for repairs. Esp with little littles, I’m willing to pay more to get my time back."

Otherwise, try an agility, fitpaws, flyball, or other more structured activity to keep them moving."

fatlogic,fc0sppl,t1_fc08aje,1577298788.0,"PCOS is a catch all term for a couple of related pathways for stuff to go wrong. There’s no one specific way things happen. Some people can experience some symptoms that will be totally absent in others. 

While you need three items from their diagnostic list to be diagnosed, there’s about 10 overall. Many may have more than 3. Some of those items aren’t diagnosable without an ultrasound or bloodwork. 

“Lean type” pcos is a thing. While I’m a normal body weight (now), and have pretty normal periods, it’s 100x better, lighter and more regular, than when I was 40 lbs heavier. Still, my AFC (antral follicle count) was off the charts, bloodwork is screwy, and I have other issues with hair that have persisted.  It’s impossible to really fix, unfortunately, even with weight loss."
