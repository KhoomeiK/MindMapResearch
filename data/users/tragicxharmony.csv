I very much understand where you’re at right now! I’m in recovery right now (I’m 24) and am physically much much worse than when I was in my teens, and I’m not happy about it. It really feels like most people think you should be “over it” by now and I’m locked out of a lot of treatment options. 

I also can empathize with feeling guilty. It’s hard to come to terms with how your health affects the people who care about you. 

And your situation with the doctors sounds so frustrating. Tachycardia is definitely concerning (I’ve always had a high heart rate, especially for being underweight) and I can understand why they want to focus on that and keeping your electrolytes up, but the lack of focus on your eating doesn’t sound great. I hope that your ED treatment team can advocate for you on that

Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,fez439u,t3_eqylgl,1579453632.0,"Sleep! If you have an exam the next day and aren't prepared, staying up all night to study is not going to fix it. Get a good night’s rest and look over what you can in the morning. 

Particularly if you live in dorms, take care of your health in general. Vitamin C, hand sanitizer, etc. Getting sick can really mess up your studying and classes—last summer I got strep at the beginning of the (7-week) semester, missed a week and a half of classes, and ended up having to drop the classes I was taking because I was already so behind. Going along with that, eat properly. The “freshman 15” isn’t always weight gain; a lot of college students get stressed, forget to eat, and start losing weight. 

If you’re working or have other responsibilities besides school, make sure to have at least one day off per week. Yes, you can use it to study or relax, but don’t work/go to class 7 days a week because at that rate you will burn out. 

Make a calendar that has all your classes and all the due dates for the whole semester. Look ahead; on slow weeks work forward in reading/note-taking assignments. If you do that, on busy weeks with multiple exams you can focus more on your busy classes and not worry about getting behind. Try to have at least one person in each class that you can contact for notes in case you miss a class. 

Try to keep your room/dorm/whatever tidy. I know, it’s a pain, but a messy environment can make it harder to focus. Also, try not to do everything in your bed. Sit at your desk or go to the library to study. \

I *love* self-care and bath/beauty stuff. If you do too, make it calming and like a little ritual. Put on nice music while doing a face mask or something. Light a candle (if you’re allowed) while painting your nails. Whatever makes you happy!

fuckeatingdisorders,feyztru,t3_eqx0wb,1579452517.0,"To follow up on the comment u/maryjanenewston wrote, a lot of people seem to get really up in arms about The Fuck It Diet, but it has really good advice. For me, I try to follow what says as much of the time as possible. It isn’t the right advice for everyone, and if you have very severe health issues then you should definitely be under a doctor’s supervision, but its advice is scientifically sound. 

If you can’t afford to buy books, remember libraries exist, as well as Overdrive/Libby which you can access through a library card (although if you were to google the title of a book followed by the word epub, you definitely should not click on one of the first links, or find a pdf, or download anything for free). 

OP, when you’re going through this, keep in mind the reasons you want to recover—school, sports, your health—and write them down if you have to. You’re still fairly young, but your body won’t be able to bounce back if you keep this up. I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckeatingdisorders/comments/dohpky/im_so_deeply_angry_about_how_badly_ive_messed_up/) a few months back about all the health issues I’ve gotten from years of restricting. 

You need to eat, a lot, there’s no shortcut or way around that. Talk to your therapist and see if they can help hold you accountable, or if you have friends who can do that. I’m not seeing a dietician right now either (lack of access for people my age 🙄) but I keep track of about how much I eat. All the “normal” eating advice needs to be thrown out the window, and that’s scary. Full-fat everything; high calorie food; that’s what’s going to solve this the fastest. [Here](https://www.scienceofeds.org/2014/05/07/hypermetabolism-in-anorexia-nervosa/) is a very good article on what weight restoration may entail—I can say from personal experience that it is incredibly accurate. 

Finally, do your best to step away from ED forums/subreddits unless they’re specifically recovery-focused. It’s not healthy to be reading that sort of thing all the time. I know it may help you feel less alone, but it probably isn’t doing a lot for your mental health. I’ve been reading through subreddits focusing on weight gain for things like bodybuilding and sports. It’s unconventional, yeah, but I’ve found it to be more helpful and less toxic. Keep your mind focused on things that you want to be doing and work toward those goals

Good luck to you!"

Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,fes3hr7,t1_fes13sp,1579360980.0,If you’ve got instacart in your area the prices are a lot more reasonable than shipt or the grocery store’s own service. I get aldi delivered and it saves a bunch of money 😊
Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,ferrwp2,t1_feqse13,1579357657.0,Blue! And I vote for pink 😊
Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,ferrto7,t1_feprbwz,1579357626.0,Blue! It’s my favorite
Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,feppew8,t1_feppabj,1579326919.0,It’s one of those products that I love so much that I have to sing its praises every time it comes up in conversation 😅
Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,fepp47m,t1_fepnvtj,1579326651.0,"It’s arctic fox brand, it’s really nice and conditioning and vegan and doesn’t have harsh chemicals so you actually can leave it in overnight 😊 I just don’t want my nice pastel sheets getting neon blue on them but thankfully I dragged myself out of bed to get food and wash my hair so my sheets are safe"
Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,fepn3hw,t3_eqa7yb,1579324918.0,Chilling in bed and reallyyyy debating on if I feel like washing my hair dye out tonight or if I just want to leave it in until morning. Not sure why I thought 9pm was the time to start bleaching/dyeing my hair but I’m in too deep now 😅
Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,fepmsbz,t1_feplmbc,1579324669.0,"I love doing laundry way more than anyone should tbh....like putting clothes on the drying rack, ironing them, folding them—it’s all so relaxing! I don’t know why 😂 I also really like vacuuming and I may have spent an hour on my hands and knees scrubbing the kitchen floor today, lol. Who would’ve thought chores could be so relaxing?"
MaliciousCompliance,fepmg6h,t1_fepehf7,1579324390.0,Get them secondhand! I paid like $20 on poshmark for mine and they look like New Years later 😊
ethicalfashion,fepjjv6,t1_fepby66,1579322145.0,[Pact Organic](https://wearpact.com/women/apparel/tops%20&%20shirts/featherweight%20v-neck%20tee/wa1-wfv-wht) has some v-neck tops. Same boring colors though unfortunately

Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,fepbqnf,t3_eq9lmq,1579316641.0,"See, I know I’m super weird but I can’t think of anything that makes me weird at the moment 😂

Hmm, one thing is that I personify *everything*. If something looks “lonely” or whatever I feel super bad for it (I’ve bought things just bc they looked sad). I start worrying about the food I eat sometimes and if I’m hurting it by eating it. Anything with a face automatically has a personality....etc. It can be problematic 😅"
Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,fepbg3h,t1_fep5i46,1579316443.0,"Same thing for the soup! It’s a texture thing, I think. Soup just needs bread or crackers"
Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,fepb8cl,t3_eqa6gu,1579316303.0,Hi! Congrats on the bonus 🥰
Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,fepaslu,t3_eqan90,1579316008.0,"Congrats!!

I don’t really know what my dream job would be, and I think that’s part of my problem 😅 Maybe like a research librarian (not a customer-service librarian!) or a travel writer??"
LushCosmetics,fenh552,t1_feayjuw,1579284578.0,"Devil’s Nightcap is *killing* me bc every review I’ve seen of it says I’d love it but damn I couldn’t afford the 30ml one there’s no way I can afford the 100ml, and especially not as a blind buy. This is the stuff that keeps me up at night 😭"
LushCosmetics,fenghlq,t3_eq3hlm,1579284177.0,"I would *die* for Devil’s Nightcap to come out in a reasonably-priced size. The 30ml one was pricy enough but 100ml for like $200? No way can I afford that, especially not as a blind buy. Everyone’s reviews sound fantastic but the *price*"
ZeroWaste,feng3nn,t1_fem9lh5,1579283937.0,I would love the links as well if you have time! 😊 This is such a great idea
