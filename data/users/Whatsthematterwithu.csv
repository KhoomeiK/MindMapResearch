tinwhistle,ffcx4u8,t1_ffcvdph,1579809102.0,"So do I understand it correctly, you say there is a limited number of notes you can play up an octave? Some simply can not be played? Is that so?  


If that's the case, I'll need to figure out which can be played and which can not, great."

Like this one, I saw so many tutorial videos telling me to play them in the second octave, is it wrong? And is there any other way to play them with similar sounds?
