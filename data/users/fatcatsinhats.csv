AskWomen,fgmlcjp,t1_fgmalok,1580926918.0,Thanks for the tips. I find trying to find tutorials on YouTube that are actually helpful is like finding a needle in a haystack. I can cast on but get totally lost when it needs to get on the other needle.
TalesFromYourServer,fgmf7qz,t3_eza98a,1580923320.0,"I overheard at a fast food place a woman order a burger combo sub chicken fingers for the fries... Then she wanted to sub milkshake for the regular pop, then ordered another combo in a similar fashion and was shocked the total was $40+. So she took off the second combo and said her mom can just eat fries. Real class act."
TalesFromYourServer,fgmexv8,t1_fgm11j0,1580923173.0,Same here. You get a subtotal then an actual total with tax in a larger/bolder print.
LifeProTips,fgmdyat,t1_fgm2zrm,1580922681.0,My grandpa passed just 2 weeks ago and I'm already having trouble remembering his voice. I'll always remember his laugh though

todayilearned,fgktqdu,t1_fgkt6wz,1580873397.0,"We only get garbage pickup once every 2 weeks. As far as I know my city allows multiple garbage bins but we've only got 1 and I can't be bothered to request another. Between 2 cats, a dog, and a baby our trash is 95% poop"
AskWomen,fgkmxki,t1_fgjtl9e,1580869214.0,"This is me too. I feel hypocritical because sometimes I'm in the mood to be distracted by a joke and sometimes I'm not and there's really no way for my partner to know until it happens.

Today I called him to let him know I needed a break from the baby as soon as he got home. I was explaining all the things my son did that drove me crazy today and he laughed cause they were kind of silly but I was just at my wit's end."
aww,fghj85p,t1_fgh7xjt,1580786047.0,"I love the part when they realize and panic! My son did this when he started to walk and realized he was no longer holding on to the couch/table. He'd flail his arms like he was falling, which caused him to fall."
tumblr,fgevjnv,t1_fgekfy8,1580711626.0,Wasn't that only for the dragon? It's been a while since I've re read it so I could be mistaken. But Harry did *technically* bring Gillyweed.
EatCheapAndHealthy,fgccu6n,t3_exio2w,1580671386.0,"I've mentioned this app before and I hate mentioning it again because I don't want to sound like a shill for them... Flashfood works with superstore to sell fore that's about to expire for a steep discount. I buy almost all my meat exclusively from the app because I can get a club pack of chicken (about 8-9 breasts) for $15 (or less depending how close the expiry date is) when it's normally $30+. 

I'm hoping they'll partner with other grocers soon to get more variety."

tumblr,ffxy7s6,t1_ffxkq11,1580334758.0,"How much is a little? Like a splash, a tablespoon, 1/4 cup?"
beyondthebump,ffxmhkj,t1_ffxl1sk,1580328131.0,"Yes that look of relief they get when they're finally understood! Today my son was babbling and I just responded ""oh yeah?"" And he just lit up and gave me a look that said - oh yeah, you get it."
casualiama,ffxbp3w,t1_ffwlaz5,1580321862.0,I think they can actually track by IP address as well. My brother would edit in false info as a guest but still ended up banned after too many fake entries.
beyondthebump,ffx41rl,t1_ffwxazy,1580317295.0,"That's adorable! My son's starting to imitate the things we say and do and it's my favourite thing! One time he kept saying ""asoo"", or ""atoo"" and we couldn't figure out for the life of us what he was trying to say, until one of us sneezed a few days later and we realized he was saying ""achoo"""
beyondthebump,ffx3kzo,t1_ffwqios,1580317013.0,My son loves the baby on the diaper box! I have so many photos of him fascinated with the box that my phone thinks the box baby is a person to be labeled with it's own album...

beyondthebump,ffr1bqp,t1_ffqubjv,1580148289.0,"My son still naps about 1-1:30 hours but I always leave him for 2-2:30 hours. He's happy to play in his crib with his blanket, soothers, etc after he wakes up."
AskReddit,ffqykjb,t1_ffqq2dc,1580146542.0,This is what I was thinking as well. I think about that case a lot and it makes me so sad.
beyondthebump,ffqnjuc,t1_ffpgmam,1580139269.0,Scheduling breaks is really smart! They're scheduled at work so why not at home as well? I might start doing this
gifs,ffov66e,t1_ffoah1t,1580082177.0,It always comes as a surprise even when expected. My grandpa died last weekend and he'd been in poor health for a while but we were still blindsided when it happened.
beyondthebump,ffnjk09,t1_ffncoot,1580066791.0,"I feel this! My husband was sick over Christmas, then I got sick ON new year's day, then my son got sick shortly after, then we got snowed in, and now our dog has just been spayed and needs constant supervision because she's also very anxious anytime we leave the house. It's been a great 2020 so far..."
MadeMeSmile,ffj6duh,t1_ffj01os,1579991545.0,"Lol I told my husband as I was sitting on the toilet watching the 2 lines appear. His response was ""fuck"". We were trying but still totally not prepared to have the 9 month deadline suddenly."
beyondthebump,ffd5p6g,t1_ffcxbh7,1579813922.0,My 18 month old son has been feeding his own snacks to the dog so I thought I'd give him a dog treat to give her. Oh boy the tantrum that ensued when he tried to eat it himself and I had to take it away... Feeding is an adventure!
AskReddit,ffczpb6,t1_ffbic4i,1579810568.0,I'm a mom and I'm so scared of dying now because I don't want to cause that kind of grief to my son. It's hard to love so deeply.

tifu,fdtle5r,t1_fdse53d,1578718443.0,Doesn't even have to be a vaginal birth either. I had a c-section and pee myself all the time now.
beyondthebump,fdkxclc,t1_fdkmcmt,1578513099.0,"This happened at my son's swim classes too. This little 4 month old boy hated it, cried the whole time but his dad was a trooper. Stayed in the water all lesson, came every day and just talked to his son, tried to soothe him and learn some skills in the process. Towards the end he didn't cry near as much. A+ parenting."
funny,fdko2gm,t1_fdkmol0,1578507588.0,"If it's full on swaddling the baby, just be watchful because if she does roll over and her arms are swaddled, she might not be able to at least lift herself up to move her head. 

We used a sleep sack for my son until about 7 months then he turned into an alligator rolling all over the place at night so we just let him do his thing unencumbered."
MadeMeSmile,fdh6vab,t1_fdgqun4,1578416659.0,It doesn't stop either. My 18 month old just pointed to his belly button when asked where it was and I cried because he's so smart.
