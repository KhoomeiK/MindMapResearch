lexapro,ffof2b6,t3_etl0ct,1580077011.0,This is my first week on escitalopram and I've lost 2.5 kg (5.5 lbs). My appetite is completely gone. I'm pretty surprised.. I was actually expecting to *gain* weight as weight gain is a more common side effect (or so I've heard).
depression,ff5ldi3,t3_errbe6,1579598531.0,Hi. I'm currently in a psych ward and holy fuck it sucks to be here (for me personally). If you feel like you need to go back you should talk to someone about it. Tell your therapist.
SuicideWatch,fezvfvt,t3_er0tdy,1579462173.0,And the fact that you're literally describing how I feel is scary too lol
depression,fezukte,t3_er0e5f,1579461850.0,"Yeah. If there's a day I'm genuinely happy I know it's only temporary. Once I go to bed I'll be like ""right I'm still going to kill myself"""
SuicideWatch,fezs2ar,t3_eqxfhg,1579460919.0,"The thought is comforting but *doing* it is another thing though. I wish there was an easy, painless and foolproof way out."
depressed,fezqr7v,t3_eqzet4,1579460463.0,"Happy birthday in advance!

Treat yourself. Be kind to yourself. Do something special for yourself. Remember, in the grand scheme of things, it's honestly just another ordinary day. The Earth just happens to orbit the sun for the 26th time while you've existed. Don't overthink it and just go ahead and fill the day with self love :)"
mentalhealth,feu9qmb,t3_eqifmu,1579384539.0,There's also the opposite problem which is glorification of mental illness.
depression,fcv6yyx,t3_ej2hmo,1577995932.0,"I feel you. A really close friend of mine stared to ignore me and avoid me after I told her about my depression. It broke me to pieces. 

Don't blame yourself. You didn't do anything wrong. It's hard but try not to overthink it. Be patient. If they're a good friend they'll probably get back to you but if they're stupid enough to let something like *this* ruin your friendship I wouldn't say they're worth being around in the first place."
depression,fco7qv0,t3_ei5th0,1577825699.0,"Aren't people allowed to be happy and share their good memories?

Yeah, I get jealous when I see that stuff because I get reminded of how big of a shitty failure I am. However, I don't think it's stupid to ""show off"" your happiness. Not everyone's depressed. I honestly just wish I could be as happy as them. 

I rarely use social media anymore and it has helped a lot."
depression,fcn4zgn,t1_fcmzd90,1577803412.0,"I'm honestly not trying to underestimate the power of words but it can be very difficult to find the right words to tell a depressed person. 

Words that are supposed to help can sometimes actually hurt instead and the person saying these words may not be aware of the harm they're causing you.

Instead of being thrown stuff like ""it gets better"" ""be strong"" ""you'll be fine"" ""don't worry"" ""stop being so negative"" and other similar stock phrases right in your face, I'd rather want you to just hug me and acknowledge my suffering. Don't just say ""I'm here for you"", prove it by actually being there for them. Don't just say ""I love you"", show them that you love them."
SuicideWatch,fcmxwm9,t3_ei1lvc,1577797036.0,"I find myself doing the same thing. 

I don't literally tell people I'm suicidal but I hint at it and let them know I'm not doing well in general without going into details. 

Sometimes I slip up because keeping it a secret is exhausting. Depression is a big part of me and it's impacting my life so goddamn much which makes it hard to pretend it doesn't exist at all and yeah as you said it's like, whatever man. If they know, it's no big deal anyway. I'm not going to shove it in anyone's faces though. I don't really want to bother anyone with my problems and I know I would make people annoyed or uncomfortable if I tell them too much."
depression,fcmttlv,t3_ehzwxw,1577791947.0,Hugs are one of my favourite things in the world. Actions speak louder than words.
SuicideWatch,fcmtatv,t1_fcm2u10,1577791221.0,"I've definitely thought a lot about it but if you read my other reply you'd know that my mom doesn't care about me and I'm a burden on her. My other family members would be sad and I myself know that if any of my siblings committed suicide I'd be broken too but I'd also sympathize. I'd understand why they did it. I don't think I can stay alive ONLY because my family would be sad if I died. Am I supposed to solely live for others? I know I probably sound selfish but that's how it is.

Life is a journey I'd rather pass or skip. A happy and fulfilling life doesn't even seem appealing to me anymore. I don't feel loved. I don't have any close ones in my life, everyone pushes me away and I push everyone away. Trying to make things right sounds so difficult. Nothing gives me real joy anymore. I don't have a reason to be depressed, I just happen to be. I'm normally an optimistic person but it's hard to even pretend to be happy anymore. 

Thanks for taking the time to write to me. Lol I already went to bed by the time you wrote this so I couldn't reply earlier but I hope you got some sleep."
SuicideWatch,fcmqvsb,t1_fclrgdw,1577787750.0,Because telling them would make the situation complicated. I would be admitted to a psychiatric hospital which is something I'd rather not experience.
SuicideWatch,fclq7x1,t1_fcllbuz,1577753814.0,"My mom and I fight almost every single day, she knows I am depressed and suicidal but she doesn't care. She thinks I am lazy and weak and she tells me to just pull myself together. She grew up in a poor country so, according to her, if you have a roof over your head and enough money for food and bills you have no right to complain about life. I know I am privileged and I don't really have a reason to be depressed in the first place but listening to her yelling nasty things at me hurts so much. I don't *feel* like a burden, I know I *am* a burden. Mom is unable to se the severity of the situation. 

My friends have been really distant (which obviously is my fault because I've been isolating myself lately) and a person I thought was a really good friend stopped talking to me after I opened up about my mental health issues. I've lost a bunch of friends because of depression.

I've talked to several psychologists and I'm currently in therapy which doesn't help at all. In fact, it made things worse because CPS got involved. My therapist knows about my thoughts but I've learnt to keep my mouth shut about having plans."
SuicideWatch,fclnq53,t1_fcl9m5j,1577752104.0,"I'm sorry to hear that, I hope she's safe. You seem like a caring person, don't be too hard on yourself. Maybe she took a break from the internet or got hospitalised if she had an unsuccessful attempt / told someone about her plan and got help. Some psych wards don't let you use your phone."
SuicideWatch,fclapjn,t1_fcl74zn,1577743489.0,"It really sucks doesn't it. I know it probably sounds stupid that I worry about others killing themselves when I'm going to do it myself, but I hope you'll find a way to get better."
SuicideWatch,fcl9b1g,t1_fcl7ur9,1577742606.0,I'm sorry for being a disappointment
SuicideWatch,fc9bnff,t3_egor46,1577550172.0,"Here's a hug. 

Here's a box of tissues. 

Here's a cup of hot chocolate. (if you don't want it I'll drink it)

<3"
