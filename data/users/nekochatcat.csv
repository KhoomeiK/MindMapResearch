bujo,fcs0mp9,t3_eigs4q,1577909530.0,"My NY Resolution is to journal daily. I am mostly stuck in bed, so the journals really help me keep positive.

I have one I call ""Oh Happy Day"" where I write all the good things that happen each day.

I can't work and had to leave a job I loved. So, to still feel productive, I keep a journal I called ""Done"". It's the things I accomplished in the day. Between daily entries, I put encouraging quotes. I make it cheery with colorful inks, watercolors, w tapes, and stickers."

Good luck to you. You have taken a step toward healing by deciding to journal."
