HumansBeingBros,fetewi8,t1_fetd924,1579374731.0,Soy protein is higher quality than beef protein so it's actually not bad at all.
socialism,feidehn,t1_feicovk,1579135900.0,Being black is a factor but if you look at the stats being a man is more significant. Obviously the combination of the two will have the highest rates. But a white man is more likely to be the victim of police violence than a black woman. It's one of the most egregious examples of institutionalized sexism against men.
UFOs,feiazgh,t3_eozqas,1579134281.0,/u/stabbot
socialism,fehx9d6,t1_fehwgvk,1579125688.0,"Right, because both of the victims in the image are men, which is much more relevant than their race according to statistics. If they had been women they very likely wouldn't have been shot. Race is a factor but gender is a much bigger one. People have a really hard time acknowledging societal and institutional sexism against men though so the pushback is understandable."
socialism,fehuqsv,t1_fehu2je,1579124260.0,Something like 90% of police violence victims are men. Are you really claiming cops sexually assault more women than that?
socialism,fehqjjw,t1_feh7kw4,1579121878.0,Still nowhere near what men face.
veganrecipes,fehpz1i,t1_fegoj6m,1579121552.0,Why do you use almond milk instead of something like soy milk that has a lot more protein?
socialism,feh6glc,t1_feh1ucf,1579110139.0,It's moreso sexism. Being a man makes you far more likely to be the victim of police violence than being black.
teslamotors,fec4v3g,t1_fea6qf3,1578966680.0,How would that be possible? If you look at the side profile of a sedan you'll notice it bends in rather than out like a hatchback. That space could have been used but instead it's just sitting outside the car for no reason.
BeAmazed,fe8l465,t1_fe8gkyy,1578927394.0,I don't think you got what I'm trying to say. In the analogy you are told you will also lose all memories of them when they are snapped out of existence randomly. Obviously you won't care and won't miss them after this happens. But it's meant to demonstrate how you would feel knowing that this will happen someday. You should feel the same way about death.
BeAmazed,fe7qsmr,t1_fe7mvpb,1578918105.0,"I disagree. Fear motivates. If we had 8 billion people who understood that solving death is the most important issue we face we could deal with the issue much quicker. Instead we invent fairy tales like an afterlife, flowery metaphors like endless sleep, and just generally try to occupy our minds with absolutely anything else to ignore it until it's too late."
teslamotors,fe7k61n,t1_fe6m0pn,1578915719.0,A hatchback is objectively better than a trunk with an unnecessary small opening and a loss of usable space.
NatureIsFuckingLit,fe7g1ek,t1_fe7drmf,1578914180.0,If you Google it you'll find the same answer. I wasn't able to plant them nearly that quickly but like anything if you do it enough you get better at it.
BeAmazed,fe7de2c,t1_fe781ny,1578913035.0,"With an accurate understanding of death instead of fairy tales to make it easier to ignore it, the only rational response is terror. And even discounting the fact that death isn't necessarily unavoidable, that doesn't really change anything. If there was a machete wielding maniac coming at me from a distance and I couldn't move that fact wouldn't somehow be comforting."
NatureIsFuckingLit,fe7cfkn,t1_fe75xm9,1578912765.0,"Yeah I don't think we know the exact ground conditions in the area, so it's possible it could take longer in some of the locations. But a good planter can plant a tree in under 25 seconds."
NatureIsFuckingLit,fe74o18,t1_fe74gs9,1578909949.0,I think good planters can do more than 1 per minute.
HumansBeingBros,fe74apn,t1_fe6nlgd,1578909783.0,Even with a respirator it doesn't do much of you have facial hair.
NatureIsFuckingLit,fe73hi4,t1_fe6yxy3,1578909505.0,Planting one per minute that's less than 7 hours of work every day.
vegan,fe71wln,t1_fe6obmw,1578908958.0,Yeah in the same way people saying you can't love people while murdering them are gatekeeping.
TheBullWins,fe6wuxg,t1_fe47wp3,1578906987.0,Give it a few decades..
AmateurRoomPorn,fe6v0ue,t1_fe3mwxj,1578905784.0,That would only work during the day. During the night anyone can see in but you can't see out which seems much worse.
BeAmazed,fe6s2l8,t1_fe6riq8,1578902734.0,"But you would have regretted that decision right? Or would you have rather stopped existing back then and not been here today, now?"
BeAmazed,fe6pped,t1_fe6ov78,1578899643.0,"Well it's not peaceful because it's not anything. This is one of the reasons I think people aren't as terrified of death as they should be. They talk about it like it's a nice endless sleep. It's not. The concept of you doesn't even apply to anything anymore.

And yes I have been in so much agony that I asked my friend to get the gun and kill me. People say stupid things that make no sense sometimes."
BeAmazed,fe6pi8s,t1_fe6or43,1578899404.0,"Right, but it's the *prospect* of it. Thinking about your life without that person you really care about, who's become a part of you, is terrible. If I told you one day, randomly, I was going to snap my fingers and that person would just vanish out of existence including all your memories but it won't be that bad because at one point you didn't know them so it will be the same as that, you would be pretty upset about it. This is death."
BeAmazed,fe6op21,t1_fe6npbr,1578898429.0,"It's like saying when losing a loved one ""Well it wasn't that bad before you knew that person right? So not having them will be just like that."" Except it isn't."
BeAmazed,fe6ok3j,t1_fe64gci,1578898264.0,Not existing is worse than any gruesome death.
BeAmazed,fe6m7b9,t1_fe69qu6,1578895647.0,"Yes, that's exactly why it's the most terrible thing possible."

interestingasfuck,fe43m6s,t1_fe3tvv2,1578855483.0,Well us and thousands and thousands of other species that had nothing to do with it. Our species is literally a mass extinction event (the Holocene extinction).
interestingasfuck,fe433vn,t1_fe3kg39,1578855311.0,I'm pretty sure you don't realize how big the galaxy is. Even if we had some kind of crazy alien tech thousands of years more advanced than we currently have we still wouldn't be able to colonize a tiny fraction of the galaxy on the scale of hundreds of years.
Bamboo,fdr8t52,t3_emtxzz,1578681104.0,"This is not bamboo. It's called ""lucky bamboo"" but that's just a nickname."
CasualUK,fdptvj0,t1_fdo8vqq,1578640278.0,"If you're constraining the issue to amount of oil per acre then that seems like a reasonable argument. But the fact is palm oil is produced on land that was the last remaining habitat of orangutans. If we keep using palm oil the species will quickly go extinct. Oats aren't typically produced on that land, and to my knowledge no species are threatened with extinction because of oat production. There's also more to the value of food production than just oil."

vancouver,fdg4dys,t1_fdftgrc,1578379572.0,"I expect professionalism from our public servants. I don't expect them to act like Judge Dredd delivering their own lawless sense of unnecessarily violent ""justice"". The takedown itself was enough. There was absolutely no reason to gang beat him while he's unarmed and lying on the ground, and to try to prevent the public from seeing them do it. That you're ok with hurting people while they're down reveals a sad breakdown of your character and society in general."

vancouver,fdcxxs3,t1_fdakc85,1578287601.0,Several of those witnesses literally tell the cops to stop beating him. Did you watch the video? The cop in the car also shines a spotlight in the camera to further obscure any evidence of what they're doing.
vegan,fda09qk,t1_fd9jm58,1578240219.0,Probably more like 20%. I think you're overestimating how much people genuinely care about things. If you want to make them stop eating animals you have to sell it on how it will benefit them personally.
vancouver,fd9vjt2,t1_fd6ksp8,1578238560.0,Not gang beat him while he's laying on the ground and position a car to block video evidence of it maybe?
vancouver,fd9upmk,t1_fd8o1em,1578238315.0,They were beating him on the ground. One of the cops positioned his car to block the video of it happening.
vancouver,fd9uj5f,t1_fd80geu,1578238234.0,You seem to have missed how the cop strategically positioned his car to block the video of them gang beating him on the ground. He even moves the car farther forward when the videographer tries to get around it so he can't capture any evidence.

The article says the only reason that fluid can come into the brain and carry away toxins is that your brain completely shuts down allowing a void for the fluid to fill.
