So yes, you can be too poor to afford that privilege since that privilege comes with expenses to keep it safe and road worthy."

JustBootThings,ffdsjqf,t1_ffdaw4c,1579827844.0,"The Royal Navy actually used to camouflage its ships in funky and artistic ways that actually were effective and did confuse enemies in which direction a ship was travelling (at one point it was joked that the Royal Navy was the world's largest modern art exhibition).

However this was back when enemy subs and ships still used a physical visual confirmation of where the ship was rather than computer systems."
ukpolitics,ffa1ttr,t3_esaq84,1579726185.0,"The amusing thing about the comments in this thread you cannot tell which bias it has. It is either a Conservative mouthpiece that single handedly won Brexit and got Boris into power, or a radical progressive institution trying to single handedly change the public to a woke PC utopia. The trouble is, everything, even facts, can be biased based on presentation, even Centreism itself is a bias.

Sure it has its significant share of problems, but no one here has even the slightest answer."

television,fepceb2,t1_fenasv0,1579317082.0,"Well, they did actually address it in the Season 29 episode, No Good Read Goes Unpunished, but in an incredibly ham fisted way that ignored the meaning of that episode. In it Marge has Lisa read a book from her childhood which when rereading discovers it uses a lot of racial stereotypes that existed at the time of writing. In the end they say that we shouldn't judge things made in a different era as society has moved on. EXCEPT that they were still writing Apu the same way as they did when he was first created, missing the entire plot.

It would be like if Tom and Jerry cartoons were made continuously since the 30s and kept Mrs Two Shoes in. At least they did it the classy way by having a special introduction by Whoopi Goldberg when they released the old cartoons on DVD."

It was the 90s sitcom that changed a lot of things, including merging Ambrose and Salem, and changing Zelda and Hilda's personalities (though they didn't really have much of one before aside from being cartoon Halloween witches)."

thesims,fef9atl,t1_feer3hq,1579051220.0,"Yeah, one the main things I don't like about City Living is that there is one traditional old downtown style neighbourhood, one modern neighbourhood, and two stupidly weird neighbourhoods. I'd liked to have seen more in the style of the spice district, perhaps a neighbourhood filled with rows of brown stones, so each house is effectively an apartment.

Either that, or bonus urban neighbourhoods in other worlds if you have City Living."

I recall reading s study that found that women and children were more likely to die, will men and the crew stood a better chance (reasons included being more easily pushed aside, women wearing restrictive clothing that impeded movement). In fact British ships in particular had more women and children die."

todayilearned,fchrqdb,t1_fcheblq,1577653421.0,"From what I recall, in land valuation, the value of land as a price is determined by what the proposed land use is rather than what the current land use is. At least based on a basic residual land valuation, which is the the remainder of what the proposed development will sell for, minus the cost of developing it (including professional fees, zoning/planning fees, interest payments etc) and minus 20% for the developers profit. 

The remainder is the residual which is the maximum you pay for the land. It is why farmland sold for housing development goes at a higher price than if it was sold as farmland."
