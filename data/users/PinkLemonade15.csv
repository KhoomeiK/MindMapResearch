I was wrong. The distractions, lack of sleep, and homework vs paying work  created a system that caused my grades to be the thing that lapsed.

I'm graduating in May, after five years of college, with around a 2.7 GPA, and I am damn proud of myself. It's not perfect, but I am getting the $70,000 piece of paper, and I will be the first in my family to do so.

I worked in a kitchen for years, and thought ""well, I've seen what they do, it shouldn't be too hard""

No big deal, we reorder and get the correct drinks. We order our food, and my husband asks for a taco dish, hold the sour cream and cilantro. I ordered a fajita, no changes. 
45 minutes after we order, we get the wrong food.

 Not like, they didnt make the changes we ordered, both were completely wrong dishes. Husband got a steak, I was brought a salad. 

We inform our server of the mistake and ask for our correct order, and she said ""this is what you ordered""

Sorry, but no it wasn't what we ordered.

""Well, I have it right here"" she showed us her order pad.

We spoke to the manager, who offered us a free meal, and we said that we don't mind paying, as long as we get the correct meal. We've both worked in food service, we know how it can be. I also requested a different server. 

Apparently, it isn't store policy to allow different servers to work different sections. 

We got the check for the drinks, and paid that. No tip for the server because why am I going to pay her for bringing me the wrong things twice, the meal being both 45 minutes after we ordered, and being wrong. 

I haven't seen her working at that Chili's, so I can only assume she got fired."

He picked up a girl in a bar, took her home with him, and did the deed. Two days later her dad showed up and beat him up, turns out she was only 16. Her family then pressed charges on him. 

He actually managed to get off with light legal charges (probation and community service, I believe). The judge felt that since she was in a bar, drinking alcohol, my uncle had no reason to believe that she was under 21.

His boss did not feel the same way, and he had trouble finding a job for quite some time because of his record."

AskWomen,fdtd1wy,t3_emxwr1,1578715027.0,"In 9th grade, I was new to the school and I was an ugly duckling. Greasy hair, baggy clothes, the works. 
The popular people always used to do stuff like this, one of them kept putting his arm around me and would spin me around to his friends saying ""look at my new girlfriend, isn't she just GORGEOUS!""
When my face would get pink from embarrassment, he and his friends would make oinking noises. This went on for months.
I ended up reporting them to the school after one specific instance in which they took a picture of me and my friends, and then posted it on Facebook with the caption ""all the pigs in the stye: the scumbags of SHS."" This got a lot of attention, over 100 comments both in defense of us and making further comments.
The school didn't do much ""it's just a joke, there's nothing we can do about personal social media."" 
It eventually just blew over, and I grew into my looks but that stuck with me for all of high school."
