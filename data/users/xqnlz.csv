Also, urban cities turn to what we like to call “bat schedules”. Everyone who isn’t working stays up ALL NIGHT until like 6/7am then we sleep till 3/4pm."

worldnews,fdib585,t1_fdi6vzs,1578439034.0,What I meant was that individuals can exert(?)* more pressure on corporations and governments to do something. But most of us (I’m ashamed to say including myself) just whine and complain about climate change.

Edit: removed tsunamis from my little list of disasters because apparently that isn’t affected by climate change. We learn something new everyday ;). Thanks to all those who pointed that out."

Damnthatsinteresting,fddii19,t1_fddi8u1,1578313649.0,"Not OP but I really think the change in art in the past 200 years was straight downhill. I literally cannot appreciate most contemporary “art” especially “abstract art” because it looks like a child’s scribbling and throwing random colours at a canvas. I love ancient art though. You can see the skills of the artist through the details of a painting/sculpture/etc.

Edit: thank you for downvoting me. I guess it’s my fault for assuming this place encourages discussion."
