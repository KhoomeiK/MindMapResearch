ElizabethWarren,ff2dkvo,t1_ff2av7f,1579501812.0,"If I can try to explain this point of view for a moment:

I have two political identities. I am generally very far left (I sympathize with many forms of state communism) but I am also a very committed technocrat. I want government to be run by the most competent people in a way that gets as much done as possible. I also want the things that are done to generally promote equality for people and to disincentivize hierarchies based on anything other than merit, intelligence, and skill. 

I support Elizabeth Warren because she is one of the most capable technocrats in government today, as well as one of the most left-leaning. She combines these two philosophies in a way which I think makes her far and away the best choice for the presidency.

If I can’t have both, I would rather have a technocrat than a far-leftist in office. I care more about the maintenance and competent operation of the system of government we have than I do about removing unjust hierarchies. When I imagine possible worlds, an unjust world with a flawed but functional government is significantly superior to me to a world where maybe a few more injustices have been cured, but the regulatory structure which monitors society has failed. 

I therefore prefer both Klobuchar and Biden to Sanders, because both of them seem to be more competent technocrats - Biden especially. In 2016, I supported Hillary Clinton for a similar reason. I’ll support Bernie only if I have no options for a competent technocrat remaining. 

I am exceptionally happy for Sanders’ movement and the leftward shift he has brought to a party and country which so deeply needed it. With that said, having an important movement and being the right person to take on the technical tasks of running the executive are two very different things, and the presidency is about the latter."

At the same time, the A220 carries ~110 passengers, which is the same as the 717 but less than the MD88/90s, meaning they’re the smallest aircraft in the mainline Delta fleet. 

In general, we’ll see them replace the Mad Dogs on most routes they currently fly, but I’d expect the different abilities and role of the A220 to wind up resulting in shifting a few routes back and forth between Mainline and Connection operators.

They’re not asking questions about one of this person’s points, they’re saying “here’s a person I think is brilliant! Listen to this brilliant person’s mysogeny!” (Or at least, this is how it reads to people like myself on this forum).

A lot of people come to this subreddit without good faith, either to antagonize the feminists here or to yell at us about how we’re wrong. Saying “here’s a smart guy, watch the video and tell me what you think” comes off as very bad-faith, especially to posters here who are very used to it. A more productive, and better faith, way to ask the question would be something like “Is modern feminism inherently American-centric, as [video] claims?” or something to that effect. 

In short, the responses read as rude because we all (for good reason) have very short strings regarding bad faith questions and interactions on this sub."

Emotion tints our experience of the world and leads us to interpret the world around us in ways that are fundamentally untrue. Emotion should be removed from human experience wholesale, and the fact that it sometimes has good qualities is not an adequate defense."

What the “as long as there is antisemitism, we need a Jewish State” argument leads you to is the notion that every individual identity, regardless of its merit, history, or ideals, needs its own sovereign state in order to be truly safe. Is that really the world we all want to live? I for one believe in a world where we are people first, identities second. People, regardless of nation, religion, ethnicity, or ideology, are all people, and should not be treated differently on the basis of any of their immutable traits."

On Disco, Burnham is the lowest of the low - she has no rank, authority, or position, and is only in her place because Lorca says he wants another scientist. What’s more, there’s explicit justification for why Lorca wants Burnham on the ship and not in prison, which we discover led him to request the posting for a seemingly random prisoner - a request which was granted because it’s war and Lorca commands the UFP’s most significant strategic asset."

That behavior  (i.e. caring more about sex than emotional companionship after going on a date or two) is disgusting to me, and that disgust is what that phrase expresses."
