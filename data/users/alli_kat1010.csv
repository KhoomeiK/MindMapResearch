Homebrewing,fdw6u8r,t3_en74px,1578755672.0,"I know it's easy to way over-flavor a beer with it.

I tried it in an IPA I brewed recently, figuring the bitterness of the hops would cut some of the juicy flavor of the hibiscus.  I was very wrong, and it came out like bitter, very strong, hibiscus juice.

I added mine at flame out, and let them sit in primary until I racked to secondary, when I removed them.

Hope your recipe ends up being awesome.  I'd love to give hibiscus another shot."

I lifted the glass piece out, and there was a nasty burn mark on the silicone.  I scratched at it, and it peeled away revealing white silicone with a layer of coloring over the top.

It could be it got too hot or something, but I don't feel comfortable smoking out of silicone anymore."
