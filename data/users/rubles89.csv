I work with rf all the time (amateur radio operator) so I’ve gotten used to troubleshooting stuff like that.

One of my users had WiFi trouble with their work machine after replacing their isp issued modem/router. Took months. Reimage, driver reinstall, restart equipment. Set reservations on the router, set statics on the machine.

Then my rf knowledge kicked in. Looked at a site survey , somehow this router had that functionality.

EXTREME interference on 2.4, I counted 60 networks, all of which crowded on 1, 6, and 11

Changed to 5GHz, never a problem again"

Parallel to the north end of chambers street, on A1 and A2 tracks (I believe both) there used to be a rail transition, before the heavy installation of cwr. When a fast moving echo hit that rail joint it would make you blink from the sound pressure....

This is why before I ever step on a platform I don gun muffs, just like transit. I wear [Howard Leight Impact Sport](https://www.amazon.com/Howard-Leight-Honeywell-Amplification-Electronic/dp/B001T7QJ9O)  by Honeywell."

That sneeze is an arousal response. My dog for example, will sneeze if he’s super excited but hasn’t bothered talking just yet. 

The fact that they’re talking softly to the dog is very helpful, it keeps the dogs energy down so they don’t meet you where you are.
