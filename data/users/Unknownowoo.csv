FiddlesticksMains,feqrzuf,t3_eqerhk,1579345364.0,I feel like it would be a month at most. Theyre probably fixing some bugs right now.
creepyPMs,fepy0rw,t1_fepxuyb,1579334448.0,Im not trying to give you advice but okay I'll stop since we arent getting anywhere. I hope you have a nice day and Im sorry for offending you.
creepyPMs,fepxoa5,t1_fepxix8,1579334228.0,Again of course you can decide in different ways. I said I PEROSNALLY think its a good way. I dont know anything about asexuality and Im not trying to give you advice. Your decisions are completely up to you. I do understand how you think that its offensive but I really dont mean it in that way.
creepyPMs,fepxgt1,t1_fepwx6l,1579334004.0,"Im not telling you advice on how to decide on how to handle your sexuality at all. Thats completely up to you to figure out. I just said in my eyes masturbation is a good way to understand. Like I said in the comment before this one I didnt write what I did to offend people/make fun of them. If my comment upset you, Im sorry."
creepyPMs,fepwtn1,t1_feps1f3,1579333747.0,Masturbation and sex are different things in my eyes at least. Of course some people may be attracted to their own gender while others arent and just like that people might hate the idea of having sex. Everyone has their own preferences and are different people. I just think at the very least trying masturbation is a good thing to see if you like sexual things or not. Obviously you dont need to come to that conculusion just by masturbation and there are other ways to decide. I had no intention of trying to be mean and offend people and if you got offended at my comment Im sorry. I dont enjoy making people upset.
creepyPMs,feoxla7,t1_feov4z7,1579307581.0,Oh no thats not at all what part I considered rational. I obviusly do not condone people just saying they want to fuck them which is why I said it is a weird text to send. I was talking about how at least its a natural thing to try masturbation to see if you like it. I do think its fucked up to send someone you know is asexual that type of text. Im sorry I didnt word it good enough.
creepyPMs,feoulak,t1_feou4jy,1579305774.0,I somewhat agree with you. I also think its sounds rational but its a weird text to send to someone randomly.
