YangForPresidentHQ,fdabo8b,t1_fdaaq09,1578244217.0,"All the while making the rich people more wealth. I honestly think that the reason we are over there is for pure imperialism. A whole portion of the world barely tapped by capitalism...so how to you create a larger profit margine for shareholders? Get in there, and make them ""need you"" and have to buy in.

Meanwhile we can profiteer off the war in the meantime. Win win for the rich. 

They dont care about anything else. We...WE have a responsibility to stop this crap."

God fuck politicians. F*** dems, f*** reps. None of them care about their people, the people they are supposed to be looking out for. Why do we all keep them around?


Edit: to all go read. Sorry for the foul language."

Anxiety,fd2rij1,t1_fd0cqjp,1578150923.0,"I second that! Not one normal citizen here wants a war, the only people that do are poloticians who want Trump re-elected. Ive been to war and I dont wish that on anyone.

Your citizens and our citizens have this in common, we dont want war. I'll be praying for you. I'll also be making as much of a fuss about it as possible. Stay strong my friend!"

MorbidReality,fcxvh3b,t3_ejanvz,1578071081.0,Trump just wants to start a war so that the masses will panic and re-elect him. Dont let rich poloticians who have nothing in common with you run your life.

I am in grafuate school now. People can be frustrating especially when they are late. But people sometimes have mental illnesses that render them incapable, beleive it or not. You may habe just internalized capitalism and have an inflated sense of self importance.

climate,fciaksd,t3_eh6cj6,1577659786.0,"Didnt the Trump administration just outlaw polution tracking maps? I can only imagine this being to protect corporations cash flow.

What should come next is a massive change in the fashion industry as they are responsible for 1/10 of world polution and countless deaths of unfortunate workes in isolated 3rd world countries. 

But I suppose most christian amearican will look the other way because dressing for church is alway a contest and of course God absolutly cares what you wear while your picking and choosing the parts of a religion that suit you.

Poloticians need to be taken down and governements reformed. The citizens of the world need to unit together agains all thier governments at once. Since the military will obviously come up. The US military is a work power in pollution producing more that most countries.

Glaciers are melting, Antartica is shrinking, the world is on fire. Bears cannot hibernate, species are displaced and dieing out. Cod off the coast of alaska are in serious trouble and so are many other fish in many other places. But im sure we need to pay for National Guard member's to go to drill to sit on thier phones while soaking up that money doing literally almost nothing at all the entire time (former SSG and watched it happen all the time). 

It's not like any of the citizens anywhere in the world have any control over how thier taxes are spent or how thier government operates. And if you try then your automatically a criminal.

I can tell you what will happen. Everyone will continue to ignore this and what needs to happen right up until world wide turmoil hits and then we will all be in trouble. Enjoy the few short years you have left."
