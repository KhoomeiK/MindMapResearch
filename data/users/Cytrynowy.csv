wholesomememes,ffq8ta8,t1_ffq1pt3,1580126262.0,"I'm not the person you asked but am in the same situation, except we're not married (3 years in relationship) and have no plans for kids (quite the contrary, we're thinking of surgically removing ability to have kids). Both huge introverts, hate most people, share nerdy interests we were both bullied for in school.

We met in drama classes. We were both part of a junior theatre, participated in amateur plays all over the country during high school days. I had a huge crush on her (later on she said she said she felt the same but we didn't have the courage to express our feelings). Later on our paths separated for a few years, she went to university in another city and I stayed in my home town. After a devastating break up for me, we began talking again. A few months later and many trip to and from, watching anime and going to museums and art galleries, we began dating and became a pair. Now we're... well, still not happy in general (depression, anxiety, low self esteem issues) but together our mental health improved and we're happy to be there for each other. 

Basically I'm in a relationship with my high school crush and a friend after a decade of silence. IMO friend zone is not real, because she was my friend, and continues to be to this day."
