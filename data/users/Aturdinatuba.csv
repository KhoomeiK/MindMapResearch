well, first of all, we had this friend in our friend group named bob and bob had anger issues he would get mad at someone killing him in cod and take it out on us he would always comeback and say il fix my anger issues but he never did but you see jacob would always personally attack this kid go like ""bob all you ever do is rage your humor isnt funny I find you very annoying."" and shit like that ngl here I did join in on this but thats only because I thought this was normal these guys were my first friend group I thought it was normal well he left I was ok with him leaving wasnt happy wasnt sad but turn out jacob was taking his anger out on bob and he turned all that anger on to the next most ""annoying"" person me this went on for a few weeks I would say but I got dnd for christmas and I decided to play a campaign for my birthday with my ""friends"" let me add here jacob again had a pretty bad past but he is also an attention seeker and all my other ""friends"" support that anywho I would try to describe something and he would act like a pencil was his penis and his nipple and shit I was telling him to stop he wouldnt we finished the campaign though. then at my friend's house two days later we were gonna do a campaign this is where Jayden and Minho come to Jayden is your typical cant agree with anybody he would try to sound smart all the time and would never agree basically trying to find things to argue about. then Minho comes in me and might have had a bunch of up and downs in the past he's really annoying and you'll see later why well anywho  we try playing he is intrupting so bad i just quit trying this was a sleepover to so anywho jacob is being annoying like normal and crap then it clicked to me how toxic they all where well anywho then i just lost so much respect for all of them jayden would always take sides with jacob same with minho and they all would try ganging up on me this isnt anything particulary new though and we were watching youtube minho would let jacob use the controller and himself use the controller but not me. also i forgot to add a big reason to so I'm adding it in here i have anxiety and when i first tried telling them they all made fun of me and shit saying no you dont have anxiety you dont have it diagnosed(which i do) but they would all believe jacob when he said he had depression because of his bad past jayden came up with the bs excuse of the doctors only helping the self diagnosed people instead of his grandpa when his grandpa was sick which is retarded"
