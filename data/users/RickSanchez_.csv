I’ve always wanted to be a pilot but I honestly don’t think I’m capable of that."

iosgaming,fgqc9o9,t1_fgqc346,1581021606.0,No just bad games in general. Play them if you love long cutscenes and convoluted stories - and incredibly repetitive turn based combat.

StellarisOnConsole,fghrbue,t1_fghqh3i,1580791685.0,"Find planetary anomalies and research them. Eventually you’ll get an update in the situation log to have a research ship check something out. 

This is what you are going to exploit. The best one is alien mural because it gives +2 to each research. Send your research ship to orbit the event. When it gets there tell it to start, and once the percentage begins going up, tell your ship to do it again. The first event will auto complete and give your rewards. Now do it again. This works with pretty much any event that requires a ship to complete. 

The best way I’ve found to exploit this (it will cripple you early game though) is to immediately build every unity building you can and go down the science tree. One of the first unlocks will give you something like +15 Anomaly  discovery chance.  While you are waiting to unlock this don’t scan any system, not even your home system. Build at least 3 science ships and as soon as you get that bonus have them start scanning everything. 

Again, please don’t do this in multiplayer. This is such a long game to play it’s a dick move."
StellarisOnConsole,fghjul5,t3_eyiohl,1580786448.0,"I have many hours and many campaigns under my belt. I’m still terrible at this game. 

But I will say that using exploits helped me actually learn the game mechanics faster and helped me have loads more fun stomping xeno scum into ashes. 

If you aren’t against it I would highly recommend exploiting your anomalies to get insane research early. Just don’t do it in multiplayer."
