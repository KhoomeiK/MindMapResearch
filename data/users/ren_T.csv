CAguns,fgti78d,t1_fgss39u,1581104837.0,Americans have no stomach for protests and conflict. All talk.
news,fgra7tg,t1_fgq784r,1581041903.0,America's greed will always supersede it's best interests. What's the worst thing that could happen? All these rich assholes don't give a fuck about the country. They'll move one once the husk of the country is bled dry.
PoliticalDiscussion,fgr6e9c,t1_fgr658v,1581039274.0,"LMAO no way. Dems are such fucking idiots if they think this Kumbaya nonsense will work. ""We just need to hug it out and then we'll heal""

The GOP has been happily ratfucking the Dems and US democracy for over 40 years. You think the solution is to play nice and make up with them?

Wake up."

Tekken,fgr5wgp,t1_fgqtqd2,1581038927.0,"I actually stopped playing T7 after Leroy was released since it was just a clusterfuck online and always annoying playing an OP character.

Been playing Assassin's Creed Odyssey and honestly I don't think I'll come back until they fix all this balancing mess."
PoliticalDiscussion,fgr5j97,t3_ezzlfr,1581038673.0,"I don't know about anyone else, but I'd stay home that day if my choice was GOP/GOP vs Dem/GOP.

Fuck that."

LosAngeles,fgqy6tp,t1_fgmr9bp,1581034004.0,"That's what happens when you live in a town where your options are Meth, or raise a family.

Nobody really wants to live in the small po-dunk towns."
LosAngeles,fgqxmmf,t3_ezd1qp,1581033648.0,"You mean terrible public schools, overcrowding, poorly paid teachers, shitty infrastructure, lack of functional public transportation, high cost of living and low wages are dissuading families from settling down in this place? 

Shocking."
videos,fgqu2xg,t1_fgqswha,1581031510.0,"You've just lived in America too long where cops can harass, beat, and kill you with impunity.

In most countries the cops aren't para-military gangs roaming the streets looking for poor victims to exploit."
videos,fgqtyan,t3_ezzkyp,1581031435.0,"This is one of the most beautiful videos I've EVER seen.

That pig got handled like he was at a Hawaiian luau. Fuck the Police."

deadmalls,fgl3554,t3_eyzveo,1580880539.0,Why even keep it open? Just demolish it already.
todayilearned,fgh6bon,t1_fggwspm,1580777726.0,"Conservatives are morons. They're the same welfare queens who hate on California, yet we help keep all those bottom feeders afloat with our tax dollars."
todayilearned,fgh67qg,t1_fggz5gj,1580777653.0,Why don't you tell us about your lovely state then? I'm sure it's brimming with potential.

todayilearned,fgh4zgo,t1_fgh0rcz,1580776822.0,California has over 10% of the entire US population. Your odds are good that a poor driver could be from Cali.
todayilearned,fgh4oa4,t1_fgh4hv5,1580776613.0,I'd rather be poor in California than rich in Utah.

worldnews,fg5i7jw,t1_fg4y4ph,1580528162.0,"Eh, system is beyond repair. We're in the slow decline of democracy stage and whatever you want to do to try and vote, if you live in a state controlled by the GOP you're SOL."
worldnews,fg5i300,t1_fg4yyc2,1580528063.0,"Yes, now that we've almost ensured the US won't have fair and free elections, make sure to go and vote out the very people who made your vote meaningless.

Great plan guy."

news,ffh9et1,t1_ffgxfe0,1579926935.0,As a citizen you're always better off recognizing that cops are usually shitty people that are to be avoided at all costs.
LosAngeles,ffg4i1w,t1_fffh87b,1579898279.0,"Generally, Americans are a pretty selfish and stupid group of people. Trying to convince anyone that a thriving public transportation systems is essential to living in big communities is already hard. Add to that convincing all the separate factions of the greater benefits to society, and you'll get even more resistance or outright bad faith acts to delay the inevitable.

LA has exactly the transportation system it deserves since most of the people who live here lack any political will to actually get shit done. We'd rather limp on with triage fixes."
LosAngeles,fffyfxg,t1_ffcyglq,1579894542.0,"Fuck taxis. Years and years of shit service, bad pickups, horrible drivers, unclean cars and NOW I'm supposed to give a shit about overpriced and under delivered service.

Not likely."

LosAngeles,ffenymw,t1_ffeczu3,1579856610.0,"Hahaha! Why not throw in a gold house and a monkey butler? 

Nothing will fundamentaly change"
Tekken,ff3ttoe,t3_ereoti,1579548710.0,"Law is easy to learn but hard to master. You'll get a LOT of riffraff that know a few typical combos/carries and a lot of aggressive energy, but most don't have good fundamentals. Also, extra level of difficulty to be a Law player since EVERYONE knows the matchup due to the sheer amount of players out there.

TLDR; there are a LOT of Law players out there. Most of them are not good."
LosAngeles,feo0cek,t1_fenxp69,1579293438.0,City Council is full of corrupt incompetents. They've had decades to get their shit together and they haven't. Time for the state to step in where the city/county kept failing miserably.

LosAngeles,fdrphjq,t3_emuz3d,1578687707.0,I can't wait to watch Metro fuck this up too. I'd bet big money it will be the useless A2 option.
Tekken,fdlnqm4,t1_fdjekuz,1578528197.0,"Law's Rage Drive and Rage Art are both fucking garbage. The only time I ever use the Rage is in situations like your 2nd example. I'd prefer he not have one so I don't slip the buttons all the damn time.  
Feels like the rest of the roster has functional and interesting Rage systems. Law just feels tacked on and thoughtless. It doesn't provide any advantageous situations or setups."
