wrestling,ff6i7u2,t1_ff6fw0j,1579627751.0,"My point is people wouldn’t be so dismissive of your comment if you took the time to explain yourself right away. This is clearly some high school tournament where the stakes aren’t too high and it’s clearly two friends having some fun. This isn’t people agreeing to throw a match at the NCAA’s. And it’s not like they wasted THAT much time, the match was over in like 5 seconds anyways."

I once had a friend who was loud and aggressively drunk. Cop had him in cuffs but only after he swung on the cop. He even let him go after I promised to babysit him until he sobered up."
