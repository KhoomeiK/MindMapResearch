Mommy dearest also had to comment everytime I wore makeup (even if it was just eyeliner) that I looked like a hooker."
insaneparents,ffb4vy7,t1_ffay8fr,1579751866.0,"It was the opposite for me, but I have diabetes type 1. I begged them to stop buying so much candy because I couldn't restrain myself. They refused (eventhough I was the only one eating it.)  They also bought tons of energy drinks (really sugary) and I kept ending up I'm the hospital because of it. Then my mother got mad at me for becoming sick. She even left me for dead when I couldn't even walk. Luckily my step father wasn't as much of a stone cold bitch and carried me to the car and drove me to the hospital. I fainted and ended up in a coma. I woke up in the ICU where they told me if I had come in 20 minutes later I would have died. Thanks mom!"
