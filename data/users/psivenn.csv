The man is 33, I'm not exactly misting up over wasted years. Maybe dial it back to 40 hours, actually take vacation time, and see how that feels for another decade or two? Straight up go part-time and hand off the day-to-day leadership. But don't call it ""retirement."" It's clear that he's not really ready for that."
worldnews,ff8h04n,t1_ff88t7k,1579678084.0,"Yeah I don't get the hate for ""single-use"" bottles. Pretty much every day at work, I get a drink in a bottle, use it as a water bottle the rest of the day, and put it with the recycling. The process is really no different than aluminum cans, except the bottles are resealable which makes them much more reusable.

My city doesn't even recycle glass. You can buy Coke in glass bottles here but they're significantly more expensive, and they're just less convenient.

The expected flow for these things is already pretty sustainable. ""Stop selling convenient products"" is not a viable solution to the problem of assholes throwing recyclable material in rivers."
ValveIndex,ff6rzvv,t3_erxdj1,1579633658.0,"I'm a little dubious of trying to run Skyrim at 120. Maybe if you go mostly vanilla, I couldn't get there reliably enough to stay out of reprojection which I found very distracting with nearby NPCs stutter-walking. It's also honestly one game I would keep the Vive Pro for. The game highlights LCD black levels pretty badly and tweaking can only help so much.

The only game that's had me reaching for wands again is Fantastic Contraption, which is literally broken with newer controllers. But some games do keep me coming back to the Vive Pro screen."
ValveIndex,ff6q68m,t1_ff661xm,1579632571.0,"It definitely helps to be familiar with the controls before you jump into VR. Personally I use a joystick with keyboard but non-touch-typists would learn full HOTAS more easily I'm sure.

VoiceAttack is popular as well, you can bind most of the fiddly rarely-used buttons to talking to your ship's computer.

The site edrefcard.info is very helpful as it will assemble a reference based on your custom bindings, but obviously that's harder to look at in the headset. I use my second monitor as a floating window with OVRdrop and can pull it up there if I forget where something is."

ValveIndex,fefmhms,t3_eovp6x,1579059518.0,"I think your question is confusing folks because the adapter you're looking for is **USB-C** not USB 3.0. Your laptop must support GPU output via DisplayPort through the USB-C port. There are laptops out there which do not support this even though they were sold as VR Ready, so you'll want to make sure.

There are lots of cheap adapters that should work, I don't have personal experience with which brands to buy but in general it is a very simple passive adapter."

virtualreality,feexpju,t3_eoojtd,1579043493.0,"I own an Index and Vive Pro, after owning a launch Vive. My reasoning for buying them remains the same after owning them and hearing others' experiences with their headsets:

- The Index offers the most comfort by a large margin. For most people's fit, there's no competition here.

- Pimax resolution is only higher in the wider FOV, which brings both distortion issues and serious performance issues. To run demanding games at 120hz on the 5K+ requires a GPU that hasn't been released yet. FOV is the killer feature of Pimax, and it sacrifices a lot to get it.

- Reverb has the best resolution, but was not a serious consideration to me because of WMR support, HP as a company, and even more severe performance issues than the Pimax 5K.

- Vive Pro does not outstrip my 1080 Ti's capabilities, and offers OLED at a lower price than the 5K XR. Due to the lack of OLED options the XR was the only Pimax I considered owning. They are quite hard to find while many Vive Pros are on the used market."
Games,feeulaw,t1_feerjqe,1579041546.0,"Significantly, the fatigue system was an XP *penalty* for not being Rested. The change was they halved all XP and changed it to a Rested Bonus instead.

Like you said, mechanically it was identical but the system became much more popular because it didn't feel like it was nudging you anymore. Players tend to interpret penalties as to be avoided but bonuses as optional."

Typically the ones that frontline Devotion will include Gary and Nykthos, even though they are far from the most important cards. Honestly the main payoff for devotion in this color is the ability to consistently T1 Thoughtseize.
