The harmonic content of flats tends to decay to the fundamental pretty quickly, and if you play through a small practice amp it can give the impression that the strings have almost no sustain, when it's really just that the sustaining fundamental isn't being reproduced well.

On the other hand, dead rounds have a much gentler roll off of the high end. As a result, they still have plenty of the lower harmonics and therefore plenty of lower-mid grunt. This gets reproduced better by a small practice amp and generally just sounds different."

Our secondary school is like your middle school and then the first two years of your high school.
