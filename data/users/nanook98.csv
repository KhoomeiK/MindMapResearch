IWantToLearn,ff9bzbr,t3_esaov6,1579709498.0,I'm a French student and consider myself upper intermediate so I'd be willing to answer any questions you have. I'm also learning Dutch if you'd like to exchange
MaladaptiveDreaming,ff8pdou,t3_erp18d,1579690259.0,"Thanks for all the kind words everyone. ☺️☺️Will post an update soon. So far so good, been tough breaking the habit though"
MaladaptiveDreaming,ff5brbq,t1_ff5blb1,1579586483.0,"Any tips? I’ve found that having a rubber band or hair tie on my wrist and snapping it when I feel the urge tends to help. And I’d like to spend less time alone, but I just don’t have very many friends. And obviously tackling my anxiety would do wonders for reducing the need to daydream, but one thing at a time right? 😂😂"
Needafriend,ff5bd35,t1_ff56il5,1579586083.0,Thanks bro it means a lot

selfimprovement,femvatu,t3_epyclm,1579270557.0,"Currently fighting the same habit with nail polish that tastes bitter. It’s much more an exercise in awareness because nail biting tends to just become a subconscious habit. When you realize you’re doing it, it becomes easier to kick. Good luck!"
geegees,feebkvm,t1_fee053a,1579030389.0,"The thing is I know this course inside and out, it’s just that my transfer credit from my old uni didn’t get accepted. I’ll just buy the book then:/"
SuicideWatch,fe7hfmd,t1_fe6kwjd,1578914504.0,"My death will suck, but at least it won’t hurt as much as an overt suicide. People can’t blame themselves for an accident. They’ll grieve then move on."
SuicideWatch,fe7h0lf,t1_fe6mdpw,1578914409.0,"You probably wouldntve changed much for that person. It’s not your responsibility especially as a kid to talk someone down from suicide. We’re all just sick people and the world is better of without us. Such is nature. You’ve not lived long enough to judge your own life, but by god I’ve suffered enough myself"
SuicideWatch,fe7gay3,t1_fe6cnv7,1578914277.0,"It’s working pretty well for me. There’s one person in particular I can’t shake, but when I quit my job I’ll never see him again. I’ll do it and then it should only take a bit before people forget and move on with their lives"
CasualConversation,fdcuhi3,t1_fdcg46j,1578284665.0,This American living in Canada is proud of you!
geegees,fcx8nm7,t3_eijng4,1578055574.0,Not in Portuguese but self-studying. If you want to study together or practice speaking I’d be glad to help you out!
ExistentialSupport,fcswjvu,t3_eiqioq,1577926921.0,"It’s called depersonalization or derealization. I deal with it too and it’s been happening more frequently to me. Not sure how to deal with it, but it’s generally a symptom of anxiety. Maybe just find something to touch and ground yourself. It sometimes works for me"

languagelearning,fcmcb6e,t1_fcm86xg,1577770300.0,"Definitely a worthwhile perspective, thanks!"
photocritique,fclxp1e,t3_ehwbev,1577759015.0,"Shot on iPhone, editing with VSCO. I’m a hobbyist doing mostly city shots because I’ve lived in cities all my life. Just looking for some composition and editing tips. 

I’m sorta concerned with the weird grayness of the sky and maybe I should adjust the lines to be a little straighter...

Cheers and TIA!"
geegees,fclit8i,t3_ehs8oa,1577748784.0,"As someone who lives in Hull now and commutes the 20min to classes, I used to live in one of those buildings and I wish I hadn’t. The university has gym, if it’s the social life you’re looking for go ahead with it. It just depends on what you value more, the experience or the money. 

I paid $750 to literally share a room with someone and now I pay $450 for my own room. With upass included in tuition fees, consider living a little further away to save. Again, it depends on your priorities financially. Good luck!"
