And what you went through was even more than that, it sounds like, because you were constantly under physical threat from living in such a chaotic and hazardous environment.  Plus it sounds like your mother constantly invalidated your experience, which absolutely is emotional abuse. 

One of the biggest lessons in my own recovery from my own childhood traumas is that the people who can shred our souls without raising a hand to us are not less dangerous than the violent ones.  They're more efficient at creating suffering.

I'm a trainer & responder at a hotline IRL.  Over at /r/SuicideWatch, we maintain [an FAQs post about hotlines](http://redd.it/1c7ntr), which should give you a sense of how things usually go.  Of course AMA.

I can tell you that everybody I've ever worked with at the agency grapples with the dread of bad outcomes.  We all do the best we can for every caller, but there's still much to be learned about suicidality and suicide intervention.  We're fallible humans with imperfect knowledge, trying to resolve high-stakes situations where we have zero control and limited information.  As much as we want to, the inescapable reality is that we can't keep everyone safe.  What I tell my trainees is to avoid looking for certainty, but to try to make sure every caller had a better chance with us than without us. Even when that's true, it's not always enough.

It takes a perfect storm of things going wrong in their lives to push people to the point of suicide.  Once someone disengages from their survival instinct, it's hard for those of us close to them to make sense of their choices, no matter how much we love them or how well we know them.  I don't just know that from my hotline experience.  I've been seriously suicidal myself, and I also lost the two most important people in my life to suicide by the time I was 25.  

One book that many people who are struggling with these questions seem to find helpful is Thomas Joiner's *Why People Die by Suicide* (HUP 2005).  Joiner is probably the preeminent researcher in the field at present, and his empirical model of the suicidal mindset has been a great help to us on the front lines.  The book also contains a very frank account of his own father's death by suicide and how it influenced his work.

There are at least three serious things wrong with the assumptions underlying this statement.

First of all, depression and suicidality are completely different things.  The relationship between depression and suicide is correlational, not causal.  Depression doesn't make people suicidal, but some of the same things that contribute to depression also contribute to suicidality.  And although there's a consistent positive correlation between depression and suicidal *thought*, the relationship between depression and suicidal *behaviour* is less clear.  Sometimes the correlation is found to be neutral or even negative.  For example, suicides peak in the spring in both hemispheres, coinciding with the lifting of seasonal depression.

Second, it's not wise to assume that similar lived experience helps us empathise with others.  Often the opposite is true - people end up projecting instead of empathising.  

Third, there's no ""correct"" way to do suicide intervention.  It's a highly complex and individualised process."

That means that this is way beyond what even the best friends in the world can be expected to make any substantive difference with.  You can't *make* him get professional help, but you can suggest it.  

What I'd suggest is that you offer him some local mental-health crisis resources and then, if you need to distance yourself, do so.  Keep in mind that tolerating abuse from someone hurts *them*, no matter how they spin things to try to make themselves out to be the victim, and no matter how much they try to use emotional blackmail to get people to stay around to keep being abused.  

I can understand why you wouldn't be confident in his parents' ability to cope, but I don't think that means they shouldn't be informed about their son's behaviour. He probably has lied to them a lot already, but that's all the more reason they need to hear from his friends, particularly if several of you tell the same story.  You might offer them some resources which they can consult - most mental-health crisis services welcome calls from concerned third parties and getting Kevin into the right kind of therapy is going to require expert guidance to have any chance of success.

In my experience, that's usually an indicator that the differences are largely only semantic, which I've come to suspect as well.  

>  It just seems offensive to enter a conversation with someone who just wants to share what's going on, with the intent to ""educate"" them or change their mind.

Both those tactics, besides being morally reprehensible imo, are spectacularly ineffective in either easing suffering or reducing risk of suicide, so if someone's using they, they're the ones who need to be educated.  And we do our best with that, but sometimes it feels like an endless game of whack-a-mole.  There are a lot of pernicious misconceptions about suicide that just won't die. 

> The major point of all this was just that as someone who is going to commit suicide, I'm absolutely not interested at all in hearing about why I shouldn't from someone who knows nothing about me.

I think you have an absolute right not to be lectured to or argued with.  And I have a responsibility to offer whatever comfort I can.  But don't you dare tell me that I don't have a right to be sad about the world losing someone as smart and insightful as you.  I think the ethical line to draw, though, is that it would be unfair for me to make my sadness your problem - and that's what far too many misguided ""helpers"" do.   My default starting hypothesis is that someone has become suicidal because the rest of humanity has comprehensively failed them.  Anyone who's interested in helping needs to in some way make up for that, not ask the person to do anything or suffer any more.  (Of course there are practical complexities, especially in the case of involuntary interventions, which I think are usually -- but not always -- a terrible idea.)  

I have especially intense hate for the mindset behind books like *Stay*, which was all the rage a few years ago.   Its operating assumption is that suicidal people have a responsibility to do a lot of difficult cognitive work to avoid ""damaging humanity"" by their deaths.  People who propagate that nonsense deserve to roast in the Hell in which I do not believe.  The real hell of it is that the suicide fetishists present themselves as a benevolent alternative."

The suicide voyeurs and/or fetishists and whatever other labels might apply have had at least 15 subreddits that I personally know about banned by the admins that I know of.  Current the only one with significant traffic that's not banned is quarantined.  (I'm not going to name any of them.)  Some of our mods have infiltrated their communities and active suicide incitement and sabotage of our mission was definitely happening.  More subtle is the pro-suicide ""activism"" that co-opts language from other contexts to legitimise itself and normalises and encourages all sorts of toxic behaviours toward people at risk for suicide. 

It's much bigger issue than you might expect everywhere on the internet, but the anonymous, wide-open nature of reddit's design plus the (not entirely unjustified) reputation of reddit's management for being free speech extremists make it particularly bad here.  

These people's behaviour is blatantly criminal, but at the current state of our laws regarding online behaviour they're incredibly hard to stop. There are thousands of Melchert-Dinkels out there, but in his case there was a perfect storm of things going right from a detection and prosecution point of view.  

> My argument was merely that condoning, understanding, and accepting someone's decision to kill themselves- acknowledging that they have thought it through to the fullest extent- can be the catalyst of meaningful assistance in reevaluating options and self-assessing mental state. And the worst outcome of it is at the very least providing some respect and dignity in a person's final moments.

I can support everything about that except the word ""condoning"".  It's one thing to respect someone's ownership of their life and their right to end it, and another thing to be content about it when someone is so miserable that it comes down to that.  It's always tragic when someone is brought the point of suicide - whether or not they follow through.  I don't think it's helpful or even excusable to be complacent about these situations.  But we need to deplore the circumstances and support the person.  

> Whereas this seems to suggest that any acknowledgement or approval of someone's decision equates to encouragement.

How could approval *not* be encouragement?  There's a vital (literally) difference between approval and acceptance, imnsho.

I don't think that's true in every context. Personally, I wouldn't even call myself anti-suicide.  I'm anti-suffering.  I marched in protests for a woman with ALS who was fighting for the right to die.  And as much as I am the first author of the anti-incitement wiki, I go even harder after the ""helpers"" who invalidate our OPs' feelings and experiences.

Of course.  And, again, where do you think we're saying anything otherwise?

You don't need to endorse suicidal intent to feel and demonstrate respect for people's ownership of their lives.  I've been part of the training team for a couple thousand suicide hotline responders and the ones who don't do the latter always wash out.  They get emotionally invested in the clients' outcomes and that's toxic AF.  The [PSA post linked from point 4d](http://redd.it/25igd7) in the guidelines (in the sidebar/community info) goes into the perils of outcome-based thinking from a slightly different angle.  

I think you'd probably agree with the training mantra that I use at the hotline:  ""90% of the time, the rapport *is* the solution"".   

Quite a few of our rules that apply to helpers are more strict than they need to be in all cases - but because this is a public support space, there are quite a few things that can work in some cases which are not allowed because we're found that they have an unacceptably high backfire rate. 

Another wrinkle is that we have no reason to think that the 90/10/1 rule doesn't work here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet, and so our responders aren't just speaking to our OPs, and we all need to keep that in mind.  

I do have one point where both we and the science may disagree with you.  You seem imply in a couple of places that there's a ""point of no return"" where someone can't be helped.  It's impossible to prove that that never happens, but the evidence is overwhelming that even the people who act most desperately and violently to try and end their lives can usually be helped."

2. The second egg is is dropped on the floor accidentally by a person who loves the egg and was carrying it oh-so-carefully and lovingly to the nice, comfy fridge when s/he tripped.  

3. The third egg is dropped on the floor deliberately by a person who loves the egg and who sincerely (and on good authority) believes that eggs like nothing better than bouncing up and down on a nice hard floor.  

Now, the 3 people have wildly different levels of responsibility for the fates of their eggs.  *But all the eggs are just as broken*.  And that's easy to see in this little story, because eggs are simple things that don't try to assess their own brokenness from the inside.

What our human minds tend to do, because we're not just sentient but empathic, is rate how broken we ""ought"" to be based on the intrinsic badness of either the character or the intentions of the people who hurt us.  But it just doesn't work that way, even though the prevailing assumptions, and even the written rules in many criminal justice systems, assume that it does.  (e.g. the idea of basing a sentence on a ""victim impact statement"" is illogical, although giving victims an opportunity to heard is excellent psychology).  

It's surprisingly difficult to see our own experience for what it truly is, without reference to others - but it's essential for mental health.  Ironically, we need to honour our difficult experiences to make them stop haunting us - that's one of many paradoxical things about human nature.  

So when we're trying to figure out our own experience, the process of determining how and where our own egg is broken is entirely separate from blaming, labelling, or diagnosing the person who dropped us.

OP's egg is just as broken no matter what his parents intended, and what you were doing is  implying to OP that ""your egg isn't so broken because your parents don't hate you"", which is what got you the well-deserved downvotes.  I suspect that's not what you intended, but it doesn't matter what you intended.  Most of the serious harm around here is done by people who are well-meaning but ill-informed.

In my experience, it's usually best to keep it as low-key as you can.  For example, you might simply tell her calmly that you can't keep the promise not to report, and that you can't communicate with her any more.  Apologise if you wish, but don't be dramatic or talk about how awful or guilty that you feel.  If you write a note, keep it short and simple.  And don't [JADE](https://outofthefog.website/what-not-to-do-1/2015/12/3/jade-dont-justify-argue-defend-explain) - that just makes her validates her abusive behaviour.  

As far as safety planning goes, I would say that if her mum is generally supportive, then telling her might be a good option.  I mean if your ex were my kid, I'd want to know she was talking about suicide.  If you're in the UK (since you said Samaritans), you might find some useful information in the resources at [Mind's website](https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/) or by talking to them yourself and/or encouraging her to.

>  She says [...] the *only* thing that is keeping her alive is me

Even if she truly believes it and doesn't know any other way to try and help herself feel better about from clinging to you, this is emotional blackmail.  It's abuse, pure and simple.  Now, she may not know any non-abusive ways to try and take care of herself, and if so that's absolutely not her fault.  

I think it's important to keep in mind that it always harms people if we tolerate abusive behaviour from them.  This is true even if they're in real pain. This sounds like the sort of situation that's far beyond what even the best friend or SO in the world could make a substantive difference in.  I train crisis-line responders IRL, and one of the things that new people have the most trouble with is setting boundaries and limits with people who are in distress and at risk, but it consistently leads to better outcomes when we do it.  

What's her support network like?  I.e. friends, family, doctor, therapist, etc?  I'm supportive of your instincts that cutting contact is right, but maybe we can identify some things you can do to make sure she gets the best support possible during this time."

Second, it's really inappropriate to make a post about community administration without discussing it with the moderators first.  It's particularly irresponsible to do so without informing yourself about the possibility of disabling downvotes by subreddit and there's no excuse for not doing that because there are literally hundreds of discussions about it in popular, relevant subs like /r/help, /r/theoryofreddit and /r/askmoderators, etc.

Even though that's true, don't get the idea that we don't all wish we could have voting work differently here than ""normal"" subreddits.  This sub doesn't exist because we think reddit is a good place to do suicide intervention.  It's an absolutely *terrible* place for it.  It exists because in the early days of subreddits, it was found to be impossible to redirect people to other sites to talk about their suicidal thoughts and feelings - people felt uniquely at home here.
