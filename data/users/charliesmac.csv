Social norms to pretend to be happy in almost every social situation? No one's holding you at gun point but if you're not fake smiling like a maniac then people are going to think you're sad or angry or just a bitch. Expectation is a strong motivator, especially in social settings. 

Capturing an actual happy moment at a birthday, wedding, etc. is great, being forced to smile for a picture and keep on smiling until your face hurts is stupid. But because people think smiling is an indicator of actually happiness rather than social appeasement, here we are."

Or it's two counts of rape. If someone says they don't want to have sex either beforehand or while intoxicated that they don't want sex, then it would be rape. 

But I agree since you said they both give consent. I still think it's shitty and consent is flimsy when you're intoxicated because unlike the popular idea that you're more yourself when drunk, it's completely the opposite."

unpopularopinion,fddu488,t3_ekfy3n,1578324022.0,"I've been taught to use a gun. I still don't like them. I get why people have them, but the fact is there's a mass shooting at least once per day, at least that we hear about. 

What irks me is that people defend the us of weapons that they could never need to use. Defending necessity of a high powered rifle that can kill dozens in seconds is ridiculous to me. I understand using a gun for food, for protection, but I don't understand defending school children being slaughtered and innocent people's lives being taken away in seconds. 

People make the argument that if more people had guns there would be less shootings, but saying this is generous to people's level of selflessness. 140M of 327M people already own guns. Shootings are still going up. It's the 6th day of 2020 and there have been 6 shootings. 

It's not been this bad in the last few decades, so it's not an inevitable thing. It doesn't happen nearly as often as other countries. No one needs a gun that can kill so many people in few seconds. 

I see that people say that people get guns anyway, whether it's legal or not. And that's true, but most people who are causing shootings either got the gun legally or from someone who did. I think there should be better background checks, in which people are vetted for what they did not if they did something or not. Because not every felony means someone is violent, and definitely not every clean background means someone is mentally stable or responsible enough for a gun. 

And on that note, mental illness is no excuse for shootings. People always blame evil acts like this on mental health, but mentally ill people are more often victims of violence rather than perpetrators of it. 

People oftwn say ""now isn't the time to talk about gun control"" at every shooting. When is the time? 

This isn't a malicious post. I don't advocate for ""taking people's guns"" because that's a violation of personal property rights and it's unlikely anyway. I just advocate for protecting as many lives as possible. Having a nihilistic attitude towards people you don't know dying doesn't solve anything or put their families at ease. You just look like an asshole. I think people should keep their guns, and less people should be killed by them at the hands of another person. 

I don't claim in any way to be an expert. I don't know everything about guns, background checks, mental illness, etc. But this is my take on everything. 

Tldr: My point is, you don't need to be educated about guns to know violence.

I wish we could live in a better world where quality food that's usually thrown away by grocery stores was given to shelters and food banks. I wish people who were close to starving and had to skip meals could eat more than some cornflakes and really stale cupcakes. Also what does she expect people to buy in bulk to last a month at a grocery store that's any different than what they have at the food bank? That's still going to buy carb and sugar filled processed foods or... beans and rice.
