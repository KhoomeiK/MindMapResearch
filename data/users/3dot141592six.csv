TooAfraidToAsk,ffpu3d7,t1_ffp6wgc,1580105752.0,"Don't do that. This right here is why people ignore you. You come off a bit annoying/ aggressive and I don't even know you. The whole poor me thing is also a turn off. Let me tell you a story. 

I saw some people playing soccer and I asked to join. We kind of hit it off and they'd invite me over to parties and gatherings even though I don't drink. they'd still invite me. One day I get invited to a moving into college party 2 hours away. I get there and there's this kid whom I've never seen but everyone was just super rude to which was weird because up to now they'd been nothing but nice and inviting at every gathering. I was so thrown off by this.  I made small talk with this kid and a lot of it was forced but I forced myself to be nice to him. Turns out he also lived in my town so that was weird that I'd never seen him at our gatherings until now. 

 Fast forward 2 days. This kid shows up at my job to talk to me. I didn't think much of it, thought maybe he saw me on my way in. Later he adds me on every social media platform. He finds out where I live. Within the first week of meeting this kid he fucking stalked the shit out of me. Every morning I'd wake up to 50 notifications from him. Liked all my photos. He'd randomly go to my job and house. I'd be polite but not really buddy buddy. I asked my friends about this kid and they said he was like that. Everyone had to be mean to him or he'd go complete creep. 

I ended up changing my number and blocking him because he would not leave me alone. Sometimes you're so starved for attention that when you get it, you go over board and now you're known as that guy. 

There are 7 billion people in this world. Learn to accept rejection and move on.  when you don't get rejected please don't be that guy. You shouldn't have to force a friendship. I went through a lot of people before finding a small group that I enjoyed. Work at a restaurant, there's a lot of opportunity to make friends there due to the amount of rotating staff. Pick up a sport. Being more interesting doesn't mean learn to fly a plane.  It just means that even when you're not with friends,  you know how to entertain yourself. You have your own life and if someone wants to join it cool if not that's cool too. I can assure you that that will attract people. Not this welcome to my pity party bullshit. 

If you pick up something you love, you'll meet people that also love what you love and that'll be common ground. Remember that most people are alone most of the time. Social media makes it look like everyone but you is out there having fun but social media is a cropped and photoshopped picture."
TooAfraidToAsk,ffovy47,t3_euf6qq,1580082473.0,"Start by lowering your standards, know that no one HAS an OBLIGATION to respond. If they don't respond after twice, tops, learn to move on. Rejection hurts but honestly do yourself a favor and save yourself time by not being an annoyance or be known as some one who pesters women. Finally, know what your bad qualities are and work on them. Maybe you're boring? Learn to do things and then don't be a show off about it but next time you get a reply at least you'll have something interesting to talk about"

AskReddit,fedsg8b,t3_eon1df,1579018915.0,"I more or less inherited an aggressive dog.  Not to me or my family but anything and anyone outside of that. The place I lived at the time did not allow dogs over 30 pounds and he must have been like 50-60lbs. For the next 6 months I kept him indoors all the time. Which hurts now because he loved the outdoors.
 The landlord suspected that i had a dog but every time he came around i rushed him to the bathroom and ran the shower. 
Anyways, jump forward 5 months and I was close to moving,  he bit another dog. The police were involved,  my landlord kicked me out. I moved in with my girlfriend. During my dog's last month he lived in a tiny bedroom with me and my girlfriend because I still had a month to go before I could move into my new place. 
Anyways eventually the police concluded that my dog needed to be put down or get this really expensive insurance and at the time I was super broke. I put him down. It hurt so much but I was just delaying the inevitable. I loved him so much but it wasn't enough. 
I hate myself for making the last 6 months of his life like that of a prisoner. He suffered because I wouldn't let go. 
Anyways now that I'm a nurse I see this all the time with patients. Patients in pain want to die but family members won't let them. ""You have to be strong and hang in there"" , ""we're all praying for you"", "" stay strong for ____"" , ""we know you'll recover""
These patients scream in pain when family is not present but when you bring it up to the family they become defensive and angry. 
Sometimes you love someone so much and delay the inevitable but in turn it hurts the other party."

askwomenadvice,fdzszlc,t1_fdxz077,1578795086.0,"A lot of people here have said it already and they're not wrong.  You are young and chances are you might not be with your current bf forever.  In fact I was engaged to my high school sweet heart. Things fell apart and it was devastating but it ended up being the best thing to happen. It's one of those things where you can't see it because you're not old enough. We speak through experience that you have yet to develop. Just wanted to say that it's ok to love your bf and be with him for years if the love is there, but it's also ok to love each other and move on. On average every 5-7 years we become new people. About 5 years after my break up,  I ran into my ex and we had a month or two long fling but it turns out that we weren't compatible anymore.  We were ok with hooking up a few times then we parted ways and it was extremely easy. We both ended up with great people and we're both really happy. I guess I just wanted to say that you shouldn't feel guilty if the day ever comes when you're forcing the relationship. It doesn't sound like it but if it ever does, don't feel guilty for wanting a few years to yourself."
askwomenadvice,fdxxu3v,t3_en5qh3,1578774003.0,"Definitely FOMO. it's normal and happens time to time.  Try doing new things together.  Take a painting class or pick up a hobby together. Maybe try something new in the bedroom. Or in a new place.  The thing about this particular guy that you have feelings for, Is probably more to do with that feeling you get when you get a new toy.  The hormones that get released  For a new shiny thing start getting associated with this new guy. Not only that but the more you try not to think about it the more you do. So it becomes a vicious cycle. Remember that relationships aren't like Disney movies. They are work and after a year or 2 you stop Getting those butterflies It's not just this guy it will be any guy. Love eventually becomes more of a choice than hormones.  If it ever gets really bad try removing the other guy from your life."
