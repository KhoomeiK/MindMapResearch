airsoftmarket,ffh790y,t1_ffh6ijd,1579925082.0,Unfortunately a customer just placed a down payment on it yesterday. So at this time it's no longer available.
Props,ffdnmi2,t3_et213s,1579824716.0,"Print out a cover of the Bible and put it on an easier paperback book to rip.  Just make sure the book is thin enough to rip it apart efficiently.

You can make it like a pamphlet as well just several blank pages that are stapled together or something along those lines."

Rainbow6,ffb2jgm,t1_ffb1w1x,1579750171.0,I literally told the new guy that came in reported and bounced.  Just like man I had such a good groove going.
Rainbow6,ffb1vf4,t1_ffb12ti,1579749705.0,I wish it was off permanently.  I know it's part of the game but it wrecks it for others.
Rainbow6,ffb1kie,t1_ffb14yo,1579749497.0,I have dealt with idiots like this before but it's just usually just one person being a moron.  Heck I even let 1 kill go by but two of them at once.  Come on.
Rainbow6,ffb1eqh,t1_ffb15gj,1579749391.0,I was really tempted to (really tempted to (clenches hands)) but I just messaged the new guy that came into the game then bounced out.  Not worth my time and effort with trying to eliminate them.
siberianhusky,ffaru34,t1_ffaopg7,1579743012.0,I think we all do this at one point or another.  You just can't help it with such good puppies!
airsoft,ffaiem3,t3_esc32p,1579736467.0,Did you pull the spring from another case or did you buy one at the store?
JennaLynnMeowri,ffagahx,t3_esjc8w,1579735064.0,You looked like a Blacksmith or tailor with that colored apron on.  However yes I am Hungry for you!
single,ffag3pg,t1_ffafv61,1579734938.0,Doesn't help with guys showing up flashing dick pics either.
JizzedToThis,ffafv9q,t3_esdiyt,1579734778.0,I would buy more Dominos if my delivery girl was this hot.
single,ffabnku,t1_ff9pmm7,1579731747.0,This group was good in the beginning but now with people like this rolling in good its going down.
airsoftmarket,ff9xk9d,t1_ff8hvhq,1579723683.0,Noted.
PublicFreakout,ff9xfza,t3_esawu9,1579723610.0,I would freak out about this as well if it is my dog.  This is really justified.
PublicFreakout,ff5yvmr,t3_erq2lx,1579614661.0,"Well makes sense if the coach is dedicated to the ladies by law then the men shouldn't be in there.  However, getting slapped for it is kind of over the top.  Well, I guess it's just the culture right?"
single,ff5yfw4,t3_erq443,1579614299.0,Aren't we all crazy in the end??
NekoIRL,ff3kru3,t3_eraz85,1579543146.0,And cute as a button.
single,fevhopp,t1_fevgr5u,1579397595.0,Fun and painful. lol. The snow was great with fresh powder. Definite learning curve. Had to do almost like a shaolin flip to avoid a little kid that came across my path. All I knew I was in the air upside down and was like this is going to hurt. Splat!
StarWarsBattlefront,felzekf,t3_epqwu1,1579234921.0,BRILLIANT WHY DIDNT I THINK IF THAT!!!
SiegeAcademy,felui3y,t1_feluddm,1579231256.0,That's true but you can cripple them. In either case it depends how good you are at aiming for the head. However the main function is to peek around corners without exposing your full body.
SiegeAcademy,feklpxg,t1_fekiaod,1579202665.0,Its how aimed people do it and it also increases the chance of you hitting them.
SiegeAcademy,fekgvqa,t1_fekfwoi,1579199786.0,Easier to aim at the body since it's bigger than a head. Plus if nothing else you can probably down the person and when they are falling you either kill them or headshot them.
SiegeAcademy,feivkrq,t3_epbkeh,1579148398.0,"Aim usually isn't thrown off. At least for me.  It's mostly used so that you don't have your body completely inline when somebody fires full-auto at you in an open area.  Because most guns when you start firing goes from middle to up.  So if you are aiming at the body of mass and go full auto  9 times out of 10 you can probably tag the head as well.  Also, it's good for peeking around corners without fully exposing your body."
