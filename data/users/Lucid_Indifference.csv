microgrowery,ffcr3hj,t1_ffckfvp,1579805510.0,Pistils are the little white hairs indicative of the impending flowering stage.  It takes about a week or two to see them

Looks like pistils, you're good"
vandwellers,ffbzr50,t1_ffbyu7d,1579787802.0,"I can speak to my experiences local to southern Ontario.  Overall, the slack that Walmart shows RVs for parking there bleeds over to passenger vehicles.  And the abuses Walmart sometimes experiences, paints all with a negative brush.

The adage, ""better to apologize afterwards, than to ask permission & be denied"" is apt"

toronto,ff3qvuh,t1_ff3psis,1579546903.0,"People are everywhere, they just don't gather round for a photo, also there's project management & scheduled crews for task types.  For example the rebar crew would have been taking a few days getting the floor formed before those down there, and we in the truck delivering concrete above, even show up.  That's why this process takes years.

And the technology is not just wood.  It's I-beams, low MPa concrete & above all, mathematically proven via structural engineering formulas, to withstand cave-ins from the surrounding ground.  I don't know how, but as I've seen in my 6 years watching how high-rise buildings get started, it is used universally"
toronto,ff3opzr,t3_erhbe7,1579545586.0,"This might be considered ""low effort"" by the subs but I still have to figure out a way to get pics on an album using imgur through mobile.  Can that be done or do I need to transfer the pics to my laptop?

Anyway I took this picture over the Don Mills station build looking westbound on Eglinton.  This was at the end of October and only one of many visits I made before and after this picture was taken.

If you notice the walls are mounted with wooden beams that have been slid down vertical I-beams (embedded in the ground using caison concrete) and act as support walls while the structure is being built.

The in-ground tunnels on this side are already formed.  This is about a year or so into the project (or more), & still in its relative infancy.  More to come when I figure this imgur stuff out"
NoStupidQuestions,ff349g4,t3_er1vm8,1579533292.0,I answer to be sure like you said but then I report the number as spam & build someone a database

futurama,fezf1tp,t1_fez8kk0,1579456659.0,Rofl. Thanks for that memory...  Sometimes all it took was the look of his face...
AskReddit,fez0eo3,t3_equx98,1579452715.0,"I would make empathy indoctrination required at 18 for everyone.  It would take a year.  Make them work a month as a server in a restaurant, a month as a delivery driver (wherein they would be a passenger in a large vehicle working long hours away from home), a month as a volunteer to feed the hungry & poor (in the their communities), a month as a taxi / side gig driver.  Who's got more ideas for theme months?

Often opinions are formed on perceptions rather than experiences these days, which is too bad"
