* Taiwan closes their borders to China? Completely fine!
* Europa does the same with Africa? (Assuming that the virus spreads there which is the very scenario this topic is about) You must be a racist for even suggesting that!

Frankly, if China can't stop the rapid spreading Africa as sure as hell won't be able to do so if the epidemic really should hit it. Considering that undocumented immigration from Africa to Europe is far more common than from China to Taiwan, Hong Kong or Australia to begin with, the implications for Europe in such a scenario could be massive considering the immense risk of infection the Coronavirus possess. If undocumented immigration remains being treated as a peccadillo, instead of forcing those immigrants from affected countries to take the same precautions every German, French, etc. citizen who returns from China has to take right now, this could cost a horrific amount of lives. Europe not only has the right, but also the duty to protect its citizens from harm exactly like Taiwan, Australia, etc. do."

Note that I come from a 2v2 perspective, where KP often decks tend to be greadier as you got an ally to help you with fighting for bridge control."
MinionMasters,ffqt2sk,t3_eupewq,1580143006.0,"Depends on Master and on strategy. Ritual decks wouldn't make sense with less than 6 mana, simultaneously KP will usually have a pretty high curve in order to get value out of those 4&5 drops with his T3. Mordar usually lies between those.

In general 3.7 mana is quite expensive likely a decent rough estimation of an upper border for your average deck.

The main issue with expensive decks is the lack of  bridge control. Morellia does a good job to leverage higj cost drops with Spirit while always having the option to capture with skeletons. Apep also gets free bridge control outside of a few scenarios where you roll a building. Apep however benefits from fast cycle which you'd lack with an expensive deck. Rattbo is more of a hindrance than a help in this meta."
gaming,ffo1mh6,t3_eu6f8x,1580073226.0,Take my upvote for that reference. I love that movie.
MinionMasters,fflg6pv,t1_ffiag8v,1580039271.0,"No offense, but that sounds like multiple mistakes on your opponents' side rather than KP's T3 being strong. If your opponent is an Apep with his Shrine up, you don't use Rammer. Frankly, it's rare to see Rammer at higher elos at all as tends to die for free very, very often. Either way against Apep KP you should never play that cars to beginn with unless you have overwhelming board control or you use it IN RESPONSE to Apep's shrine, rather than an attempt do deal face damage."
MinionMasters,ffhtxgr,t1_ffhsp2f,1579953719.0,"While you're right in a way that those don't add consistent value you have to factor in Mana Frenzy. Both T3 perks (Ravanger & Morellia) get you a massive board advantage and very like bridge control for an extended amount of time if you play them right, which means that in an otherwise equal game they reach mana frenzy first.

So it's not that they don't do anything for you (which this would be more true for Ravagers T1) - let me put it this way:
If we divide the time from T3 to Mana Frenzy in to 4 sections Morellia and Ravager will win the first two sections board state and experience wise nearly guaranteed. Maybe even section 3 well. Usually however during section 3 and 4 Nyvir and Brustus are likely dead. Depending on your opponents responses (Laser Turret, Magma Storm) or your missplays (not covering Nyrvir and losing her to Stun Lancers) they even might die in section 2, but they might as well stay alive till section 3 if you cover them well and/or got healing to support your push.
So ultimately (even if your opponent consistently gains value), you're usually winning the board for 2 out of 4 sections with a variance depending on each sides' decks and skill.
After they're dead your opponent will begin to outvalue you like you suggested, but at that point you already have a noticeable lead towards mana frenzy. So it's not that you're losing due to lack of value - but instead the roles have simply changed: You're the defending party for section 3 and 4 until you reach mana frenzy - then you have the advantage again as (even with persistent value) your opponent will likely still not win the board as hard as you did with Nyrvir/Brutus."
MinionMasters,ffhotfp,t1_ffhb4ew,1579945922.0,"I have to disagree. 

While it does require some timing **Ravager** can set up great pushes behind with his T3 perk which are further leveraged by his synergistic T2 perk.

**KP** \- here I agree, he has one of the worst T3 perks ingame. It doesn't affect board state, it's a tool that's supposed to help you when you're losing and forced into defense, simultaneously that's exactly when its condition can be difficult to meet. Combined with the nerfs to his auto attacks over the years it's far, far less game deciding than other T3 perks.

Stormbringer - No idea why you would consider this weak: It's constant pressure that forces your opponent to act while in a neutral board state and becomes global removal utility while of the offense.

Morellia - nerfed quite a bit, but her T3 remains an extremely strong temposwing element with both (large AoE removal), a tough tank and AoE attacks (which can even strike airborne enemies) combined.

Diona gets a slightly faster frequency of her T1 perk, which is nice but lacks the major impact a lot of other abilities have. For comparison: Apep gets free 4 cost minions at a faster pace and while Diona's Decoy remains useful her Crossbow trap doesn't scale to deal with threats like Nyvir or level 5 golems."

>Aspects I factor into my judgement:  
>  
>Power with the ""best possible setup"" - You'll likely never know the best possible setup, but there's always strong decks. Measuring Masters by their strongest decks is likely the best indication of whether a Master requires buffs or nerfs.  
>  
>Versatility - Masters like Diona, Mordar and to some extend Rattbo need a specific way of deckbuilding to really make them useful. Being that restricted to a specific deck structure worsens your ability to adapt to the meta while versatility (both during deck building and how you can use your powers mid match) is a power factor.  
>  
>2v2 benefits - While this doesn't concern all modes there's characters who become extra useful in 2v2, like Volco as they can buff you allies or deal strong AoE whereas other Masters can suffer from a lack of synergy: Mordar for example can be a real hit or miss when randomly reviving low value minions from your ally. A Master who is good in one of the modes doesn't necessarily need buffs even though he might underperform in another mode.  
>  
>Ability reliability - Diona for example takes VERY long to cycle to the trap she wants as her traps take turns. Simultaneously her ability 2 can be countered by enemy minions while also suffering from RNG either way. Opposed to that Morellia has the freedom to choose the effect of her ability freely, or Rattbo has a guaranteed benefit with each summon.  
>  
>Board impact - abilities like Volco's burn the bridges or Nyvir's Breath before Morellia's dragon appears can massively shift board state and create large tempo swings. While not a removal Milloween can create low cost, strong scaling ranged units that don't suffer from the low health penalty ranged units usually have while having the potential to snowball completely out of control, they're even getting free buffs from her other abilities (synergy).  
>  
>Neutral state - Neutral state describes an even match where no side really manages to set up an overwhelming push. Stormbringer's and Volco's first abilities shine here, as they constantly apply pressure to the enemy master, even if no side wins the board.  
>  
>\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
>  
>There's more factors, but those are a few of the most important ones:  
>  
>Currently I'd rank the Master's like this for random 2v2 (meaning Morder will be much lower than in 1v1)  
>  
>S-Tier:  
>  
>Volco - Strong with spam and control decks. Wins neutral state battles, free insanely powerful bridge control with perk 2, incredibly strong perk three and while he can't attack flying units his attack deals massive AoE damage.  
>  
>Milloween - Got boosted a lot by nerfs to other masters and the introduction of cheaper spells over the years, as well as the recent Spawn of Fury buffs and changes to her Golems a few months ago. While a lot of Milloween players tend to be too greedy screwing up the early game, a Golem that isn't dealt with in time can later on win games on its own. In addition she has a free removal that can even deal with commonly very painful threats like Harbingers. P.S: What were those unnecessary buffs to her auto attacks last patch when they are already strong against single units and hordes alike...  
>  
>A-tier:  
>  
>Morellia: Extremely versatile, extremely reliable and extremely powerful. She got nerfed a lot and it is noticeable. She's leading the A-tier but doesn't quite reach the powerlevel Volco and Milloween have >anymore<. The nerfed auto attacks also are a noticeable factor. Overall she remains the best master for all-round decks. They're just not as strong as hyper specialized ones.  
>  
>Apep: Outside of rare instances where his ability becomes a building he gets free bridge control on a relatively low cooldown. This also allows him to build his deck accordingly and more flexible than other decks that have to somehow fit in bridge control (concept of opportunity cost). His reliable invincibility is a gamewinner and can counter even strong pushes for free - or simply use his shrine as a damage sponge before enemies even reach his face. His 3 has great value. Overall he's constantly strong during all stages of the game.  
>  
>Stormbringer: Winning neutral state is a great advantage in 2v2, so is the value he can get from tanks combined with his global auto attacks. His 2 buffing his ally's attacks as well is a big plus. He does have significant issues with strong pushes, though - as his auto attack lacks DPS.  
>  
>Setsu: While limited in her strategic variety ""face is the place"" remains a very strong strategy. Simultaneously her stunning auto attack has insane value in a meta with so many big threats.  
>  
>Ravager: He's definitely strong and can snowball advantages very well, but he's also subject to rock-paper-scissors. As there's quite a few Colossusses and stuns in the meta and Magma Storm is still OP as hell, he has fallen behind a bit and can often be countered. Still, he can be very problematic to deal with for other decks, especially if your ally knows how to enforce a push.  
>  
>B-tier:  
>  
>King Puff: While better suited in 1v1 he is a bit weak before tier 2 in 2v2. With power being shifted away from 4 and 5 drops due to nerfs on top of the introduction of stronger lower as well as stronger higher mana cost cards, he fails to reap the benefits of the latest expansions and patches. On top of that his 3rd ability can be VERY tough to activate when fighting enemies with board state impacting T3 abilities. Especially in 2v2 this can become an issue with many setups once he falls behind.  
>  
>Diona: Overly specific deckbuilding requirements combined with a long ability downtime if you need a specific trap. Her ability 2 also is quite unreliable and her ability 3 lacks impact. Decoy can win games, but she suffers from being consistently outvalued on average by other Masters' powers. Furthermore (while available more often with T3) her Crossbow trap doesn't even remotely scale in a way that would allow it to keep up with (e.g.) the bump of Milloween's Golems to level 5)  
>  
>Mordar: Hit or miss. His success completely depends on matchmaking and his allies' player skill. Not a good factor for 2v2 even though his rebirth is a gamewinner.  
>  
>C-tier:  
>  
>Rattbo: His creatures often become more of a hindrance than a help as Spiritmancer is a popular card in 2v2. Simultaneously he fails to really benefit from the last few expansions as many of the stronger cards are high cost ones. Even though his synergy with high cost cards was buffed his scrats rarely ever make a meaningful difference - especially considering that Daggerfall and Poison Strike are quite popular in the relatively common meta slither decks as well. Combustion nerfs (though more than justified) also hurt him. Then there's also frequent Soul Stealers.... He just doesn't fit the meta AT ALL and looking at the theme of the next expansion I don't think he's coming back anytime soon without major changes.  
>  
>Player skill remains a major factor, as do personal preferences - the differences in tiers aren't as large as they're in other games and this is just directed towards 2v2 random play. In 1v1 or premade 2v2 Mordar for example is much, much stronger - in tome decks even rivaling S-Tier. **>So take everything with a grain of salt.<**"

It does have great value and works well against standards counter like Fireball once KP gains his T2 perk, but teching in an extra Chopper or Whirling Scrat counters it very well.

I'm currently at place #36 of the 2v2 ladder iterating between a Scrat deck ([https://i.imgur.com/xtZi2Yd.png](https://i.imgur.com/xtZi2Yd.png)) with Wreckniator and random Volco decks. None of my decks right now a very good, but they work since that type of KP is easily hardcountered by a lot of cards - or by simply picking Volco. You could even grab your own Empyrean deck and use it with Volco if you prefer that. Burn the bridges + guaranteed rage works well and it's beautiful irony to beat one type of deck with itself ([https://i.imgur.com/ObFE655.png](https://i.imgur.com/ObFE655.png))."

Having such a low cast (not skill effect!) range as a limiter instead of skill (your ability to aim over longer distances) seems to go against thw original concept.

I can definitely see this being an issue at lower ranks.

Cursebearer is actually quite essential to that deck as it's your tool against Morellia dragons and living statues. If you don't have Maountainshaper consider Beam of Doom, it should also help with your trouble against stronger airbone units.

I'm not really using Chain Lightning anymore, the nerfs hit it really, really hard. Fireball would also be a better solution against airborne units. Chain Lightning might even backfire in some instances as it can keep enemies from walking into your burning bridges. Using a melee unit to force enemies to pile up on a burning bridge tends to be very effective. While Cursebearer tends to be good against high healths units Burn the Bridges takes care of all average units, which is why control Volco and Cursebearer synergize well.

MinionMasters,ff6zgnn,t1_ff6ugo8,1579638065.0,"Tough to say. I'd say 1v1 was far more competitive 3 years ago, but that doesn't mean it's not anymore. Judging competitive is though these days, as the increased rank grind means quantity beats quality when it comes to ranking up.

I personally enjoy 2v2 more these days. While it has gotten a bit better with ritual nerfs, 1v1 used to be very rock-paper-scissory last year. For quite a while ladder used to be ""random high cost spam"", ""counter to random high cost spam"" and ""face aggro"". Since the ritual nerfs skill is more of a factor again. 

2v2 premade is always competitive. 2v2 random I'd say is a question of interpretation. Especially in high rank you'll know that you have instantly lost when you get a Master 2 in your high GM or Contender team when your enemy does not - simply because the skill difference on the upper ranks is very high - and one bad player tends to have more of an impact than a good one in a meta as focused on high cost cards as the current one (you don't really have to be any good to make Colossus etc. a pain to deal with if a 2nd guy stacks units up behind it).

2v2 requires a different set of skills than 1v1 - you have to adjust to your ally, spectate his mana on top of yours and count mana for 2 enemies instead of one. It requires a lot more skill, but simultaneously you're also subject to more RNG due to having a random teammate with a random deck who may or may not know how to play in team. Hell, particularly most of my 2v2 matches with Milloween-randos are lost, simply because they blindly buff their golems instead of considering that some of their spells might have more value on other creatures in some situations, or that they potential consider enemy removal before spending all their mana on buffing one unit. It's a mistake that I see regularly even at high ranks.

In Warframe this has gotten a bad taste as DE essentially always misses the mark on what's appropriate (remember Wolf?) and then goes the extra mile by disabling a lot of mechanics (like status proc) from working against those targets, making those encounter particularly blunt in Warframe whereas they're actually fun in other games. A massively varying power level due to riven stat roll RNG simultaneously makes it impossible to balance. Allowing players to re-roll stats separately would allow DE to balance for the best case scenarios, but I'll likely get death threats from the riven mafia in my inbox just after suggesting this.

Frankly, that seems to be selective reading from your part. There have a been a lot of different constructive suggestions on both reddit and the official forums. The tone just has gotten a bit rougher as DE has been IGNORING quality feedback FOR YEARS and now they're even doing THE OPPOSITE of what players have been asking for.

There has been so much constructive feedback that slowly it's slowly turning into frustration and anger when DE repetitively shows that they don't give a f\*ck about this feedback. If we look at the Arbitration changes and the table dilution things had to completely escalate in their own board for them react. Which kind of promotes escalation when beforehand there's no reaction at all to more constructive feedback. Heck, they're still sticking with the most horrible implementation of a revive mechanic anybody could've come up with!

I'm drifting off topic though. Again - the solutions an constructive player feedback is there, like in the start post. It's just that DE has gotten very disconnected from the community over the last 2 or 3 years."
MinionMasters,feyr8n7,t1_feybuvb,1579449656.0,"Power with the ""best possible setup"" - You'll likely never know the best possible setup, but there's always strong decks. Measuring Masters by their strongest decks is likely the best indication of whether a Master requires buffs or nerfs.

Versatility - Masters like Diona, Mordar and to some extend Rattbo really needs a specific way of deckbuilding to really make them useful. Being that restricted to a specific deck structure worsens your ability to adapt to the meta while versatility (both during deck building and how you can use your powers mid match) is a power factor.

2v2 benefits - While this doesn't concern all modes there's characters who become extra useful in 2v2, like Volco as they can buff you allies or deal strong AoE whereas other Masters can suffer from a lack of synergy: Mordar for example can be a real hit or miss when randomly reviving low value minions from your ally. A Master who is good in one of the modes doesn't necessarily need buffs even though he might underperform in another mode.

Ability reliability - Diona for example takes VERY long to cycle to the trap she wants as her traps take turns. Simultaneously her ability 2 can be countered by enemy minions while also suffering from RNG either way. Opposed to that Morellia has the freedom to choose the effect of her ability freely, or Rattbo has a guaranteed benefit with each summon.

Board impact - abilities like Volco's burn the bridges or Nyvir's Breath before Morellia's dragon appears can massively shift board state and create large tempo swings. While not a removal Milloween can create low cost, strong scaling ranged units that don't suffer from the low health penalty ranged units usually have while having the potential to snowball completely out of control, they're even getting free buffs from her other abilities (synergy).

Neutral state - Neutral state describes an even match where no side really manages to set up an overwhelming push. Stormbringer's and Volco's first abilities shine here, as they constantly apply pressure to the enemy master, even if no side wins the board.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

There's more factors, but those are a few of the most important ones:

Currently I'd rank the Master's like this for random 2v2 (meaning Morder will be much lower than in 1v1)

S-Tier:

* Volco - Strong with spam and control decks. Wins neutral state battles, free insanely powerful bridge control with perk 2, incredibly strong perk three and while he can't attack flying units his attack deals massive AoE damage.
* Milloween - Got boosted a lot by nerfs to other masters and the introduction of cheaper spells over the years, as well as the recent Spawn of Fury buffs and changes to her Golems a few months ago. While a lot of Milloween players tend to be too greedy screwing up the early game, a Golem that isn't dealt with in time can later on win games on its own. In addition she has a free removal that can even deal with commonly very painful threats like Harbingers. P.S: What were those unnecessary buffs to her auto attacks last patch when they are already strong against single units and hordes alike...

A-tier:

* Morellia: Extremely versatile, extremely reliable and extremely powerful. She got nerfed a lot and it is noticeable. She's leading the A-tier but doesn't quite reach the powerlevel Volco and Milloween have >anymore<. The nerfed auto attacks also are a noticeable factor. Overall she remains the best master for all-round decks. They're just not as strong as hyper specialized ones.
* Apep: Outside of rare instances where his ability becomes a building he gets free bridge control on a relatively low cooldown. This also allows him to build his deck accordingly and more flexible than other decks that have to somehow fit in bridge control (concept of opportunity cost). His reliable invincibility is a gamewinner and can counter even strong pushes for free - or simply use his shrine as a damage sponge before enemies even reach his face. His 3 has great value. Overall he's constantly strong during all stages of the game.
* Stormbringer: Winning neutral state is a great advantage in 2v2, so is the value he can get from tanks combined with his global auto attacks. His 2 buffing his ally's attacks as well is a big plus. He does have significant issues with strong pushes, though - as his auto attack lacks DPS.
* Setsu: While limited in her strategic variety ""face is the place"" remains a very strong strategy. Simultaneously her stunning auto attack has insane value in a meta with so many big threats.
* Ravager: He's definitely strong and can snowball advantages very well, but he's also subject to rock-paper-scissors. As there's quite a few Colossusses and stuns in the meta and Magma Storm is still OP as hell, he has fallen behind a bit and can often be countered. Still, he can be very problematic to deal with for other decks, especially if your ally knows how to enforce a push.

B-tier:

* King Puff: While better suited in 1v1 he is a bit weak before tier 2 in 2v2. With power being shifted away from 4 and 5 drops due to nerfs on top of the introduction of stronger lower as well as stronger higher mana cost cards, he fails to reap the benefits of the latest expansions and patches. On top of that his 3rd ability can be VERY tough to activate when fighting enemies with board state impacting T3 abilities. Especially in 2v2 this can become an issue with many setups once he falls behind.
* Diona: Overly specific deckbuilding requirements combined with a long ability downtime if you need a specific trap. Her ability 2 also is quite unreliable and her ability 3 lacks impact. Decoy can win games, but she suffers from being consistently outvalued on average by other Masters' powers.  Furthermore (while available more often at T3) her Crossbow trap doesn't even remotely scale in a way that would allow it to keep up with (e.g.) the bump of Milloween's Golems to level 5) 
* Mordar: Hit or miss. His success completely depends on matchmaking and his allies' player skill. Not a good factor for 2v2 even though his rebirth is a gamewinner.

C-tier:

* Rattbo: His creatures often become more of a hindrance than a help as Spiritmancer is a popular card in 2v2. Simultaneously he fails to really benefit from the last few expansions as many of the stronger cards are high cost ones. Even though his synergy with high cost cards was buffed his scrats rarely ever make a meaningful difference - especially considering that Daggerfall and Poison Strike are quite popular in the relatively common meta slither decks as well. Combustion nerfs (though more than justified) also hurt him. Then there's also frequent Soul Stealers.... He just doesn't fit the meta AT ALL and looking at the theme of the next expansion I don't think he's coming back anytime soon without major changes.

Player skill remains a major factor, as do personal preferences - the differences in tiers aren't as large as they're in other games and this is just directed towards 2v2 random play. In 1v1 or premade 2v2 Mordar for example is much, much stronger - in tome decks even rivaling S-Tier. **>So take everything with a grain of salt.<**"

I'd rather use Hearthstone for reference where even the pros who earned their living by playing it constantly lost major tournaments due to RNG rolls. While Cheese Date doesn't have the large scale RNG as a Piloted Shredder randomly rolling Doomsayser (destroys the whole board) in Hearthstone Cheeser date provides low strategic value in terms of RNG as none of the outcomes is particularly meaningful or requires significant different counterplay. Then again - if it was gamechanging RNG that'd be broken in itself when it was up to luck instead of skill.

MinionMasters,fexl67i,t1_fexjmk9,1579432797.0,"At least yesterday I was the only one using Diona in the top 20 of the 2v2 leaderboard...

Both from experience and from empirical evidence I have to wholeheartedly disagree. Diona is fun and decoy can win small skirmishes, but the rotation of her traps means that it takes VERY long to actually get to it, meaning it has less value on average than other masters gest from their first ability. Crossbow trap also costs mana while stronger removals like Volco's ""Burn the Bridges"" doesn't. Her 2nd ability is subject to RNG. It's bad on average doesn't get any value unless you have board control in order to cover the fetch. Her 3rd ability is fine - but most other masters have T3 abilities that are great.

**You can build decks that play around her strengths**, but she's FAR from being the best master, very far. Personally I'd place her on the bottom of the tier list just slightly over Rattbo. She has a higher skillcap than other masters, but is far less impacting and has less consistent abilities and she only works with very specific decks.

The good thing about minion Masters is that skill matters and you CAN make her work. That doesn't make her good, though.

She gets a bit of value in 1v1 tournaments were enemies are predictable, but she's definitely among the two or three weakest Masters for laddering."

I'd suggest you change gate for Sewer Rat in order to have more bridge control, a lower curve and a wider set of receivers for you Slither bound benefits.

I'll assume that you don't have a 2nd Snake Druid, but it would make a good replacement for Woodsman. Alternatively Spawn of Fury works good with Harbinger and Living Statue. Gambler's Ball (while I personally don't like it) has become quite useful in combination with living Statue after the buffs. Flame Imp or Whirling Scrat would also be solid alternatives to have some sort of AoE. Those are some options - I hope you have one of those as a new player :)

Overall your deck has a really solid foundation, good job!

EDIT:Black Hole also is an option, but that might be too advanced. It can save Harbinger from Fireball/other removal or it can separate a big enemy frontline from it's backup, allowing Stun Lancers to get more value.

EDIT2: It might also be worth it to consider another Master who provides more damage on the side. Diona is possibly the most situational Master and relatively weak. Morellia might be a better fit as she can Spirit Harbinger, granting it extra life or set up an army of skeletons behind Living Statue, using its body for cover.

Stormbringer also is strong in any living statue deck."

While I agree that Colossus could be a bit weaker the main issue here are the players. Back in the day he was even stronger (wider AoE, 25 more damage/swing) and yet he wasn't as popular as he is now (even outside of ritual decks). The main difference was that players were skilled enough to play against him.

Ritual is another issue and in my eyes mainly product of 1, 2 and 3 drops getting consistently nerfed while more and more power was shifted into large bodies making big creatures dis-appropriately strong.

I consider it tough to objectively judge it, as I really, really don't like the playstyle it supports.

Got him 2 games in a row and he kicked me out of the top 50 with his plays (after I already lost some ranks overnight).

You always get bad players in 2v2 - even at high ranks and yes: It can be really, **really** tiling, but blaming the cards doesn't help if there's something that could have been done by any of you two - and in your case there was (as was in mine).

As it stands he's much too slow and doesn't provide enough value for his combo power. Similar as to why ""Bats Bats Bats!"" has been underperforming outside of bug-exploit decks. With the difference being that his combo is much less meaningful in most situations."
MinionMasters,fer4r10,t3_eqfavs,1579349783.0,"Considering the accumulated mana cost of the units you're facing and the position of the healing shrine this picture shows you that you made mistake of reinforcing a push against Collossus within the opponents' half (allowing your enemy to stack backup behind it) instead of letting it enter your half and cutting off reinforcements.

Simultaneously Stun Lancers have been placed much too early and in the wrong location, they'll be eating Storm hits for free and apparently you or your ally failed to use Apep's shrine to bait out stormy attacks before Priestress got too close (while she's still ouf of range she'll reach him after 2 attacks).

The King Puff on your side also failed to use bridge swap properly to splitt both Colossuses and chain the bridge stun into Stun Lancers. Then there's the question of why Healing Shrine was allowed to get that low on its own when your King Puff has 2 removals in hand.

What we can conclude is that A LOT of missplays happened on your side of the board - and your opponents have a team that can capitalize on those.

While I'd appreciate a Colossus nerf, this picture is not a justification. With the tools at hand the situation could have played out much different and in your favor."
Cooking,feq1vhf,t3_eqbdn1,1579336282.0,[Romanesco](https://www.google.com/search?q=Romanesco&rlz=1C1AVFC_enDE749DE749&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiTyYOK3oznAhVLzqQKHVSuBhQQ_AUoAXoECBEQAw&biw=1280&bih=578&dpr=1.5): a flat-out upgrade to your classic broccoli. It's surprising how many people don't know it.
MinionMasters,feprk10,t1_fep8wde,1579328870.0,"Sorry i misread. I still dont think it'd be worth it, though."
MinionMasters,feoozo3,t1_feont1t,1579303342.0,"Yes, I was surprised how easily I am getting board control with this deck, but Legionnaires with decoy can overrun enemies quite well. Squire Puff has the advantage that it shields your units even if they're in the enemy half meaning it can deal with late fireballs where Bannerman can't.

Frankly, it's also a really great bait as a lot of players go for the ""free"" kill and either end up wasting more mana than it's worth or place their units too early, so that you can counter them while keeping Squire Puff alive.

If you're uncomfortable with it you can always swap it, it's one of these cards that have to fit to your playstyle. Black Hole always is an option to save your units from Fireball as well, though the Rage from Puff has won me quite some games so far.

EDIT: Also note that Decoy can protect Squire Puff .

Caleth is solid, but for me the taunt is more of a bonus than a must-have, Using 2 bridge shrines for that feels excessive and particularly Diona doesn't gain that much benefit from T3 that it'd be worth the investment (both mana wise and in terms of possible bad draws)."
MinionMasters,feoksed,t1_feogkyq,1579301497.0,"I used to tripple GM frequently before the Contender changes, then the grind got more and life my got busier simultaneously. I ended last season at #52 Contender in 2v2, but I guess if we talk about ""what rank do you spent most at"" it's medium to high GM as I tend to play around with different decks after the initial grind (some of them work, some of them don't)."
MinionMasters,fenl5ez,t3_eq41pn,1579287028.0,"I really dislike how they add more and more faction synergy.

While not necessarily bad nearly all cards that are balanced for their faction bonuses underperform in more balanced decks, meaning that they ultimately don't contribute as  much to variety as they could.

It also makes laddering boring as everybody will be playing the same faction whereas  non-faction cards encourage experimenting with different archetypes."
MinionMasters,fenaoqj,t3_eppzko,1579280625.0,"Easy to play and easy to level with as most players won't be experienced enough or have the tools to deal with it.

It's really nothing fun to play, but it's an easy way to grind levels after season reset while watching TV."
Warframe,fena1ca,t1_fen6rkp,1579280222.0,"The buffs tackled none of the main issues: Wonky enemy hitboxes, poor flight speed (a bit better with the new Exilus mods) on a ridiculously long reload ON TOP of charge mechanics.

Arrow quantity (=Multishot from Splitt Flights) does help with hitboxes a bit as you have more projectiles covering a large hit-area (even though you obviously won't full damage).

While nice the minor damage buffed didn't tackle any of the consistency issues. Frankly, only fixing enemy momentum truly would, which is likely never gonna happen. So area coverage is the best we can get."
SubredditDrama,femjcks,t1_fek3xqc,1579258538.0,"There's a big difference between Steam and EpicGames though, Epic pays companies in order to get exclusive rights while most (non-self-produced) games on Steam can also be bought from other sellers and be played on other platforms like GoG.

Steam is marketleader, but not a monopolist - Epic Games tries to become a monopolist.

So being opposed to EpicGames doesn't necessarily mean that they're bootlicking Steam, but rather oppose EpicGames' policies.

That being said: Those are gaming platforms and especially EpicGames whose userbase is mostly based on players of THE most popular shooter for 8 to 13 years olds (Fortnite) doesn't really provide an audience who understands the concept of a discussion. That it's not about winning, but about delivering conclusive support for a thesis in order to agree on the most overall beneficial outcome (or at least agree to disagree due to different subjective valuations of arguments).

If we assume that a monopoly is something bad, as it provides too much market power, it's good to have different gaming platforms on PC - but simultaneously it's not good to have one that's trying to buy exclusive rights from 3rd parties. This is why the outcry against EpicGames, though not always constructive, is justified either way.

EDIT: Looks like some of the kids found their way into this sub as well."
