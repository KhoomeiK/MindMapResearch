I have been working my ass off helping my coworkers, helping multiple client groups, working my ass off to go above and beyond, have 98-100% monthly audit scores, and sucking it up and doing the things I don’t want to do. Our manager gives us (us as in the examiners on my client group) absolutely no recognition and didn’t even nominate us for this leadership program. They won’t even refer us to ANY leadership course to help us move up. All 3 of us almost quit today and yesterday.

Edit: I’m now going back to school so I can GTFO. I basically need a degree to receive higher pay and to get hired on outside this company."

My brother and I are millennials and can drive a manual (my car is manual) and he has two cars that are manual, I have a few millennial friends that have manual vehicles too. They will also be embarrassed when they learn the gas is on the right and the clutch is on the left."

alcoholic,fegrqwk,t3_ep2fm3,1579101005.0,"You can always check out meetings. You can look up YPAA meetings (young people in AA) in your area and check it out and try to identify with any feelings that people share. You just need to look up intergroup and choose the type of meeting you’re looking for. 
YPAA has helped me in sobriety to help to learn how to have fun sober, party sober, and develop friendships. There has been a lot more that has helped me to stay sober, and I started at 24, and now reaching 2 yrs at 27.

Edit: I recommend trying AA and trying to identify as you may have a problem, but ultimately it is up to you to figure that part out."
