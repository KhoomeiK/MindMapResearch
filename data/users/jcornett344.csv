Any recommendations on recreational dispensaries?"

iamatotalpieceofshit,ffhc41f,t1_ffh6hxn,1579929473.0,Ahh you're saying one does not kill better than the other. I mean a blow from a .45 is much more devastating to the body than a .22 and that's just a simple fact. You're much more likely to die from a shot from a .45 than a .22. Of course unless the .22 goes into your dome or heart. Then they're equally lethal.

cats,fecsj19,t3_eoeup2,1578982951.0,"I noticed one of your kitty's ears are clipped. Is this from getting spayed/neutered??

The reason I ask is because I just took in a stray and tried to figure out if she had been spayed and I found online that vets sometimes do this to indicate that a cat has already been spayed/neutered. But I'm a lifelong cat owner and have never seen this in practice.

Adorable kitty by the way XD"
