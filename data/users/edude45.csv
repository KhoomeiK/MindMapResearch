I first got it I updated to the current driver. There was an optional one available but I feel figured let's try with what seems to be proven. Started up squad and the game screen would freeze. The game sounds like it ran perfectly it would just freeze. I alt tab'd out then back in and the game would play normal but would freeze seconds later.

Then I believe I updated to the optional driver update. Same problem.
Then I turned off radeons special vsync setting and that fixed the game for me.

It looks good for about an hour then I started getting studdering. My temps were at 100. So I had to adjust some fan settings and I heard I could lower the voltage without losing more than 5 frames and I tried that and it's all good now. 

I'll see if I run into anymore problems but that was all day one.

I've never bought bt earphones that were over $50 so I could be missing out on their best as well. In the end though, I found myself going through so many wireless headphones that the only ones I could find that didn't mess up in a week or two were some Sony's. The bluetooths I have now, sound just as good as the Sony's.

In the end, I was converted. Though... I fought for headphone jacks, and I'd still advocate for them now. Along with removable batteries and sd card slots. Because if you're buying a 1000 dollar phone nowadays, all those options should be included in a phone. Not taken away."

But I've moved on to Bluetooth earbuds for work and I've never used my headphone jack again. I think back when headphones Jacks were first announced to be taken out, Bluetooth headphones weren't great, but now there are some decent ones that last some time. I don't like airpods so I get these generic brands off Amazon. My current ones last up to 8 or 9 hours. So they're perfect. Sound quality is fair.

But yes. I've gotten to the point where headphone jacks don't matter to me anymore. Although, I can understand the need for a headphone jack."
TwoBestFriendsPlay,fe3u3xz,t1_fe3rllr,1578852894.0,"Well... I don't remember foltest in the book, but I love how he is in the game. And yes he's an asshole, but he's a king. So he has that right. I think the point Pat was making is that the game foltest was way more interesting than what the show presented. The show is just a basic fat king hiding his secret. I think game foltest wanted the help.

As for the book... I can't remember if that was in the last wish. That's the only book I read and I only remember a little of it.

Edit: oh and he was chill with geralt because of what happened in the show and for saving him. So foltest asked geralt to be a part of his crew."

I do have to say, I don't really remember the book to well. I do believe the back half of the show is part of another book I haven't read... But yes... The show doesn't explain things too well. Also I really wish they took king foltest from the game instead of what they made him, generic. Foltest from the game was an asshole! But that was way more interesting than what the show gave us."

JusticePorn,fdf7lb9,t1_fddt1fr,1578355159.0,"True the cop actually went in fairly decent until he got attitude from suit kid. I understand the cop pushed the agenda though because if their is a kidnapping situation he can't let that car go. So the cop actually I think handled this perfectly... Or I should say as well as he could. He went in with authority and was being surrounded by many. The family was upset yes, but you can move in like that. Plus when the cop felt threatened rightfully (you can't judge a book by its cover regardless if at a church or not), the cop warned, then suit kid threatened the cop stupidly. It was a bad situation, but it seems to have been handled as best as possible."
JusticePorn,fdf71nb,t1_fddpilh,1578354792.0,"Thank goodness you're not a cop. We have enough morons out there as it is. The cop came off demanding yes, but it was due to the situation of a possible kidnapping. Cop can't let that vehicle go so he needed to be forceful. Got it? So decently enough he asks who owns the vehicle and to have suit kid go get the owner. Suit kid instead asks why? If there is a reported kidnapping this behavior is bad news. 

Then they started surrounding the officer and not giving space. That's a no no. To the point where the officer has to threaten with a baton to slightly equal the balance in force. Because there are many (with potential to have weapons) around him. That's better than starting off with a gun. So when the officer threatens to push off, then suit kind then threatens the officer, that is a big no no. 

So you see, you're an idiot and you need to pay attention to detail. 

There are bad cops out there sure, but situations like this make it so cops have to shoot someone sometimes. These people should have never surrounded the cops and no one should have ever threatened the cop and they should have never touched the cop or his things. Especially a taser. 

Please take a seat and think about what you've said and come back with a positive response please."
JusticePorn,fdf64rd,t1_fcwvexm,1578354182.0,"Never lost baton. White windbreaker kid looked like he leaned against the cop on the glass. That's good enough.
In all honesty, true shouldn't have surrounded the cop. In this situation, I wouldn't blame the cop for busting heads. Cop needed to talk to someone. They didn't want to comply just simply say no. The suit kid also wanted to threaten the cop when the cop was being surrounded. That's a bad idea as well.

So... Did the cop need to learn how to deescalate... Yes, but it was also the families fault. The mom also could have been killed for snatching a taser."

Cook and Daniels are too garbage to be traded. We'd have to give up kuz or Caruso to get rid of them. Unless a team wants to get rid of a player with like 3 years to rebuild...

But like I think I said, it seems he's maturing, I would just assume it would be better for him to go to college. Experience that than be with his dad all the time.

I first got it I updated to the current driver. There was an optional one available but I feel figured let's try with what seems to be proven. Started up squad and the game screen would freeze. The game sounds like it ran perfectly it would just freeze. I alt tab'd out then back in and the game would play normal but would freeze seconds later.

Then I believe I updated to the optional driver update. Same problem.
Then I turned off radeons special vsync setting and that fixed the game for me.

It looks good for about an hour then I started getting studdering. My temps were at 100. So I had to adjust some fan settings and I heard I could lower the voltage without losing more than 5 frames and I tried that and it's all good now. 

I'll see if I run into anymore problems but that was all day one.

I think game foltest wanted the help.

As for the book... I can't remember if that was in the last wish. That's the only book I read and I only remember a little of it.

I do have to say, I don't really remember the book to well. I do believe the back half of the show is part of another book I haven't read... But yes... The show doesn't explain things too well.

I understand the cop pushed the agenda though because if their is a kidnapping situation he can't let that car go. So the cop actually I think handled this perfectly... Or I should say as well as he could. He went in with authority and was being surrounded by many. The family was upset yes, but you can move in like that. Plus when the cop felt threatened rightfully (you can't judge a book by its cover regardless if at a church or not), the cop warned, then suit kid threatened the cop stupidly. It was a bad situation, but it seems to have been handled as best as possible."
JusticePorn,fdf71nb,t1_fddpilh,1578354792.0,"Thank goodness you're not a cop. We have enough morons out there as it is. The cop came off demanding yes, but it was due to the situation of a possible kidnapping. Cop can't let that vehicle go so he needed to be forceful. Got it? So decently enough he asks who owns the vehicle and to have suit kid go get the owner. Suit kid instead asks why? If there is a reported kidnapping this behavior is bad news. 

Then they started surrounding the officer and not giving space. That's a no no. To the point where the officer has to threaten with a baton to slightly equal the balance in force. Because there are many (with potential to have weapons) around him. That's better than starting off with a gun. So when the officer threatens to push off, then suit kind then threatens the officer, that is a big no no. 

So you see, you're an idiot and you need to pay attention to detail. 

There are bad cops out there sure, but situations like this make it so cops have to shoot someone sometimes. These people should have never surrounded the cops and no one should have ever threatened the cop and they should have never touched the cop or his things. Especially a taser. 

Please take a seat and think about what you've said and come back with a positive response please."
JusticePorn,fdf64rd,t1_fcwvexm,1578354182.0,"Never lost baton. White windbreaker kid looked like he leaned against the cop on the glass. That's good enough.
In all honesty, true shouldn't have surrounded the cop. In this situation, I wouldn't blame the cop for busting heads. Cop needed to talk to someone. They didn't want to comply just simply say no. The suit kid also wanted to threaten the cop when the cop was being surrounded. That's a bad idea as well.

So... Did the cop need to learn how to deescalate... Yes, but it was also the families fault. The mom also could have been killed for snatching a taser."
