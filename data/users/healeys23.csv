Teachers,feihqdi,t3_ep6cor,1579138803.0,"Hi! I'm a new(ish) teacher - this is my 4th year - so I don't know that I have anything to contribute in terms of trends but I do work hard on changing this mindset in my students so here's a few thoughts. 

Here's a couple scenarios that play out all the time:

Student: ""I can't do this at all. I don't get it.""
Me: ""You're not *supposed* to be able to do it right away. If you already knew how to do it, then there wouldn't be any point taking this class, right? The point is to start by not getting it and work our way to understanding.""

——

Student: ""I can't believe I forgot that. I’m so stupid.”
Me: “ what’s your favourite song?”
Student: (song)
Me: “Do you know all the words?”
Student: “Of course.”
Me: “Do you know all the words to (another random song that they would definitely know of but not know as well)?
Student: “No.”
Me: “What?! Why? You know the words to the other song. Why don’t you know the words to this song? What’s wrong with you?”
Student: “ well, I have listened to my favourite song a lot. It’s easy to know the words because I hear it all the time.”
Me: “ oh, so you’re saying that the reason you remember it is because of repetition? Almost like that’s how the human brain forms memories?” (Note: I teach teens who appreciate some good-natured sarcasm with a smile)
Them: “ oh, so I just need to repeat it over and over again?”

——

Student: “I’m going to completely fail this test.”
Me: “Well with that attitude, you are.”

~~~~

I also draw a lot of parallels with sports and practicing. Sometimes, students are more easily able to see how effort and repetition and time make success when they compare it to their sports instead of their school. 

~~~~

Also, if I ever say that I am not good at something...
For example, if I am drawing a picture on the board and I say that I am not very good at drawing, I always say something like “because I haven’t practised very much” or “because I have never given the time or tried very hard to learn.” I want to always have the undercurrent that achievement can be obtained through work and is not a result of inherent qualities. Growth mindset and all that. 

~~~~

This year, I have also been trying to teach people to learn what kind of mistakes they tend to make. I am teaching French, science, math, and physics. In all of these, I try to teach the students to figure out what kind of mistakes they make most often. I say that we all have different mistake patterns and if we learn to find what our own patterns are, we can more easily find and fix our mistakes. I always give examples of the kind of mistakes that I make most often and I say that I look for those specifically when I am doing a test or an assignment for myself.

We used to alternate weeks, to attempt to avoid argument, but it just lead to more argument when we forgot whose week it was pretty much every day. So, tricky little 11-year-old me decided to propose a solution. I suggested that we alternate by the date. I would take all of the odd numbered dates and my brother could have all of the even numbered dates.

... The only reason I proposed this idea was because I realized that there are more odd-numbered dates in the year than there are even-numbered dates so I would get more days in the front seat."

todayilearned,fcyvkdd,t1_fcysel3,1578088019.0,"As a teacher, there are a few ways I try to combat this. 

1. Not many group projects. 

2. Giving each group member a separate grade for the portions of the project that they did (Also based on my observations and feedback sheets from each group member stating what everyone did. I also have them create a pie chart that shows what proportion of the work each group member did). 

3. My personal favorite. I make homogenous groups based on effort level. Put all the really high achievers together so they do roughly even amounts of work. Put all the very opinionated people together so they can just argue with each other. Put the quiet/shy people together so that they can each have a say. Put the people who generally slack together (had a student come up to me once and say that I needed to change the groups because no one in his group including him would get anything done. I replied with, ""Well, I'm not changing it so I guess someone better step up then"" to his shock). 

4. If a higher-achieving/grades-motivated student takes over and does all the work, I take off a couple of teamwork points and talk to them about the importance of learning to work in groups and  strategies to make people feel valued and find ways that everyone can contribute.


EDIT: Woah lots of reactions. Let me clarify a bit. 

2. It's a lot of work. I use observation sheets that I fill in and my peer tutor fills in (with lots of guidance and training). I use the student feedback sheets. I use document editing history online to see who contributed what. But I do it to try to be fair. 

3. I also give guidance to the groups and help moderate. I also try to reserve a separate space for any quiet/shy groups - it often helps them get to have a say when normally others would talk over them and I find it helps some of them build their confidence. 

4. The ""teamwork points"" don't affect their actual grades. It's just a feedback mark on their learning skills. But for highly motivated students, the points (though meaningless) are usually enough to get them to come talk to me / take their feedback more seriously. I *was* the kid who carried every group they were ever a part of.  I also have since learned a bit more about social skills, tact, and learning that other people can contribute and how to help guide other people (or when to have a serious conversation with a teacher/superior). I usually frame it as a discussion of how to be a good leader, as that is probably in their future. 

Tl;dr - I don't lower grades for doing all the work - just use it as an opportunity to help future leaders build leadership skills. I'm trying hard to be fair and make sure that every student is both graded accurately but also can develop a bit more as a person and a learner. 

But I'm trying to be better at this all the time. I always gather feedback from my students and work with my more experienced colleagues. I'm trying!"

2. Meh. True but still better than Norway.
