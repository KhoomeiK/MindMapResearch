MorbidReality,ffevway,t1_ffeg0pb,1579867760.0,"That certainly is possible.  Maybe when someone is constantly told they need to be proud of who they are, they can begin to feel some kind of way about who they are on a subconscious level.

I also think being a visible minority can do a number on you psychologically.  If the vast majority of the people you see on TV (including cartoon characters) are white, then you can be programmed to think of whiteness as normal and nonwhiteness as abnormal.  In the typical kid's brain, abnormal = bad.  

I loved to draw as a kid, and for the longest time, all the ""default"" people in my drawings were always white and male.  This makes sense to me now.  All the movie, TV, and book characters I was exposed to were white males.  Race relations in the 1980s were better than they were in the 1940s, but the media during both periods lacked the diversity we take for granted currently."

Being a little girl, I felt compelled to bring a doll like the other little girls. I could have taken one of the action figures I regularly played with, but I wasn't bold enough to let everyone know about my nonconformity.

I felt weird about taking the black doll, though.  I had lots of black dolls and a couple of white dolls.  I knew my mother expected me to take one of the black ones to show off and I obliged her.  But I really wanted to take a white doll.  I remember being ashamed to take my doll out at recess.  I did, but that shameful feeling stayed with me the whole time.

At the time I didn't know how to articulate those emotions.  I still don't know where they came from.  It certainly hadn't come from my parents, who had done their damndest to make me proud of my racial identity.  It hadn't come from other kids as far as I can recall.  But I still had absorbed the message that black = inferior.  Black was shameful, not worthy of ""showing off"".  It was ""weird"".  I wanted to take a white doll to signal to the other kids that I wasn't ""weird."""

I don't have a problem with you telling her she needs to go to the doctor.  I do have a problem with you coming up with your own diagnostic checklist.  I have a couple of conditions that are genetic, but no one in my family has them AFAIK.  For one thing, my family is pretty shitty about going to the doctor and talking about their problems.  For another thing, even conditions with autosomal inheritance (like EDS) can appear spontaneously.  I was tested for Huntingon's even though neither of my parents have it.  Because mutations happens.  

Also, it is possible that she is on the hypermobility spectrum but does not meet all the criteria for EDS. She may not have a problem as severe as yours, but it could be her knee issues really are similar to yours.   

When she kept insisting she has your condition, you could have just said, ""You know, maybe you're right.  But you really need to go to the doctor first just to make sure you don't have something else.""  And you could have told her about the doctor who diagnosed you.    Honestly, all the stuff about how offended you were was OTT.  You don't own EDS.  You don't get a gold medal for having a formal diagnosis.

That way, you will be able to rationalize (in a ego-protective) way the differences between you and them.

I have always had more success being myself when I am around people who are at least 20 years older than me. People young enough to be relatively cool but old enough so that I don't feel tempted to compare myself to them. Older people are more likely to find your quirks endearing rather than cringey. And older people are more likely to make you feel useful and needed. Like, my friends rely on me to help them with ""new-fangled"" technology, since I am young enough to not be intimidated by it. It is nice feeling useful and needed.

Older folks are also less likely to showcase their highlight reels on social media.

But that doesn't mean those jobs can't made to be more tolerable.  If your work schedule was more consistent and humane, you probably wouldn't be so miserable at your job.  You might never love it, but at least it wouldn't make you depressed.

It is only recently that people have even had seriously entertained the notion of getting their ""dream"" job.  Before Boomers made college a rite of passage for the middle class, people worked jobs that were tedious and soul-crushing but somehow survived.  Unions made them more tolerable.  But I think just as important is the fact these jobs carried little of the stigma they do now.

My father is a blowhard most of the times, but once he shared an observation with me that I found interesting.  Back in the day when he was coming up, people who worked in customer service were considered skilled laborers.  Semi-professionals. Ringing up groceries wasn't seen as a ""loser"" job.  It was a job for ""regular"" folks--smart enough to do arithmetic in their head (cuz that's what you had to do before computers) but maybe not ambitious enough/rich enough to go to college.  ""Regular"" folks are now expected to go to college and follow their dreams.  

My father believes that the quality of customer service started to decline once all the regular folk were encouraged to go to college and become professionals, leaving so-called losers to take their place behind the cash register.  I find this to be typical Boomer hateration.  But I do think the perception that retail work is the landing place for losers has promoted the dehumanization of the retail worker.  Retail work is tough, but it would be more tolerable if the people who do it were treated like respectable human beings instead of ""losers""."

Another thing I have learned through the  years: It is important to find your people. People who you can yourself around because they don't bring out the insecurities in you. Unfortunately, the only way to find these people is to cast a wide net and be friendly to everyone.

news,fd9ktgh,t1_fd9c38o,1578234755.0,"I love meat and eat it everyday.  I have no intention of ever becoming a vegetarian or a vegan.

But I think you misunderstand evolution.  Natural selection doesn't have anything to do with longevity or health.  Just fecundity.  We may surmise from the available information that meat-eating has enabled our species to have more babies capable of making babies. That's great if you only care about making babies, but I think most of us also care about what happens to us over our entire lifespans.

I can certainly buy the idea that meat confers benefits during one's youth up to the prime of their life.  But I'm also open to the idea that once a person has stopped growing, developing, and reproducing, that there could be real downsides to meat.  And we should not expect evolution to have selected out these downsides since they occur later in life.   Huntington's Disease is an example of shittiness that evolution has failed to do anything about since it springs up after someone has already had children.  

Also, we eat way more meat than what our ancestors did.  In the typical hunter-gatherer society, meat was not an everyday thing.  The ""everyday"" food was what people gathered--nuts, berries, tubers, etc.  Additionally, big meat was shared communally with the entire clan.  You'd get a little chunk of meat and be glad for it.  You were lucky if you could go back for seconds with all the mouths to feed. Nowadays, it isn't anything for a person to eat meat in all three meals.  Our ancestors did not eat like this. It is only within the last few decades that people have consumed meat to the crazy extent that they do now.

Lastly, one could reasonably argue that we have canine teeth for the same reason we have a tail bone.  We have vestigial structures all over our bodies."

>The ""working to save for retirement"" or ""working a job for years until you can get one you want"" mentality bothers me. 

How about ""working so that you can do whatever you want to do when you're not working""?  Does that mentality bother you?  Because that's what most people are doing.  They work to keep the lights on so that they can enjoy hobbies, family, and friends.  It's hobbies, family, and friends that allow people to put up with shitty jobs.  When you've got love waiting for you at home, you can endure a lot.

I don't think working to save for retirement is stupid, though.  It's OK if you think this is stupid, but there's nothing objectively stupid about it unless you think saving for retirement precludes having fun right now.    

>Maybe a job would give me purpose and value, regardless if I feel disconnected with the work in the end?

Yes, I think even a job you just feel ""meh"" about could make you feel better about yourself.  I have worked some shitty jobs, but the people working alongside me always made them tolerable and somewhat rewarding.  You are probably feeling worthless and depressed because you're not connected with people.  You are too much in your head.  People can suck sometimes, don't get me wrong.  But being around them and doing something constructive with them might lift your spirits.  Sometimes just having someone call you by name is all you need to feel like somebody.  

3) If you're looking for a job that will give you happiness the majority of the time, you're going to be unemployed forever.  There are no jobs like this.  Even the job that I have (which I love) is full of headache and tedium.  Every day I have to devote at least two or three hours to a task that I'd rather not do.

LifeAdvice,fd6tr1g,t3_ejyt69,1578195598.0,">society has consistently told me ""find a job you love doing and you won't work a day in your life""

Society hasn't told you that.  Maybe you've heard it from friends and family, but this message is in no way universal.  The reason I say this is because most people are not working a job they love.  But people aren't flinging themselves off of bridges since they tolerate their jobs and save passion for after-work hours and the weekend.

I love my job, but it took me 15 years to get to this point.  The first   three years were angsty and exhausting.  The next five after that ranged from ""meh"" to ""kill me now"".  And then I got a new boss and a promotion and things turned around.  I started liking my work.  Now I love it.  I would still be unemployed if I had been looking for love right out of the gate.

I get not wanting to take any ole job.  But you are not in the stage of your career development where you should be expecting passion to hit you as soon as you step through the door.  You are in the dues-paying part of your career.  Does that mean you should take a job you'll hate?  No.  But it does mean you should take a job that you can imagine yourself doing for awhile, that doesn't fill you with dread, and that will help you achieve your long-term goal of doing something you'll love.  If you wind up doing something you tolerate and it pays the bills, you'll be doing better than most people in this world."

I told her that his lack of serious relationships is indeed a red flag and she need not feel guilty for saying that out loud.  Do I think the guy is ""OMG SERIAL KILLER""?  Of course not.  I just think that it suggests there will be some challenges in the relationship that she's never encountered before.  Challenges that may not be worth her while to deal with...so she needn't feel bad about walking away.

If someone is a big social media user (like lots of people are), the lack of a social media in a potential dating partner is indeed a red flag.  It doesn't mean ""OMG SERIAL KILLER!"" but it could mean that this person isn't hip to certain things and will likely require some extra patience.
