Libraries,ffseios,t1_ffs81e1,1580179772.0,"That could very well be the case. I've only been at this library for a few years and have seen movie nights for kids and teens without much attendance. I vaguely recall a bejeweled/jewelry/bedazzling type thing that wasn't well received but tbh as a teen I would have had zero interest in that either. Personally, I love the sound of a Harry Potter birthday, or a May the 4th Be With You program. Unfortunately, t would take some serious convincing of the youth services librarian, who tends to be the bare minimum type of person."
