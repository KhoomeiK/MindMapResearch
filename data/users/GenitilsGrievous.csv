college,fehyn4b,t3_ep1or8,1579126511.0,"Yes, yes you can. I’ve been living on campus for the last three years and dropped from 245 lbs to 150 (in a healthy manner). I now regularly exercise and eat right with the food options they have, they will always have healthy options with the caloric amounts there. 
Wanna know the secret?

It’s who you hang out with. I found friends that were fit and active and frequented the gym which gave me the opportunity to do that. Don’t try to find people that sit in their rooms all day and eat like crap. Try to find active people with good habits, this will also translate into your school work. 

Keep up the work!"

EngineeringStudents,fctdpfx,t1_fctd5jb,1577940002.0,"Both really. I like being at school, the people I met, and going to class. Also if I dropped out my parents would definitely whoop me, can’t think of that. Also I feel like I need a degree to really advance in the professional world."
