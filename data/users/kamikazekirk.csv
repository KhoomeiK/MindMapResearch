Economics,ffcw18x,t1_ffc97ft,1579808444.0,"Again you are arguing examples without providing evidence; and weirdly making my point for me; yes markets work when they work? For food as long as there isn't a shortage in neccessities markets are very efficient - but show me a working free market in an area of chronic shortage; yes central planning of food production can provide poor results but it also helped several countries provide for their citizens during times of war (eg WW2) so I don't understand your point

By your logic citizenship is a resource and it should be provided by the free market and I should be able to buy your right to citizenship and you would have to leave your country"
Economics,ffcvmg3,t1_ffc99bx,1579808195.0,I see you haven't bothered to even think about my point since an insurance market doesn't address the idea that healthcare requires a timely intervention for an infinitely valuable good/service; and you even admit that because the market system is broken the government provides Medicaid so thanks for proving my point!
worldnews,ffc7z49,t1_ffbt4bt,1579793624.0,"Weight of the payload is a big challenge, also size of most UAVs mean that they are more susceptible to the aerodynamic forces in the affected area which would cause more crashes and while it may not cost people lives having several LiPo batteries or fuel tanks added to a forest fire would be bad.

Scale is the important thing with water bombers and UAVs don't have that yet."
Economics,ffc7hg5,t1_ffbn4z8,1579793309.0,"Not sure what you mean, which government, whose votes? Your comment doesn't really address my point that market principles don't apply to all cases of resource allocation (economics)"
Economics,ffc75cx,t1_ffbbpxr,1579793092.0,"I mean I think it's pretty obvious that if your child was sick you would sell anything and everything (including stealing/begging/borrowing) to make them better; that can't be how a market operates because there is no comparison for goods, nothing can be infinitely valuable in a market so you can't make a rational decision if you don't have the option to not make the decision.

Or if you are having a heart attack you can't compare services and select the best value or care, you are stuck with the hospital the ambulance takes you to - you can't make a choice because you are unconcious or dying."
Economics,ffb6alg,t1_ffacy51,1579752939.0,"I think you're misunderstanding my point, a free market doesn't work for health because in critical instances you cannot make a rational decision.  There are plenty of examples of ""necessities"" like housing and food work within a market as long as scarcity isn't an issue; please don't try to misrepresent my argument"
Economics,ffa0bze,t1_ff9nm7d,1579725312.0,"But your underlying axiom is a rational market which is not suitable in all instances, for example healthcare isn't a rational market since the value of your life or loved ones is not something you can calculate rationally, nor can you calculate the exact value of an externality so while free markets are great for certain things they aren't the grand solution for all economic problems."

Foodforthought,fdhvn0m,t1_fdhsmyg,1578430965.0,"Didn't even bother to read - they gave the woman 45 days to come back to the US, if you're done your cancer treatment after 45 days you're only options to reside in the US are a pinebox or an urn; fuck off this is totally about trapping people into paying absurd medical costs; if it wasn't about that then they would extend the process until she mom was medically cleared by her doctor back home or seperate the child's application from the mother's so they both wouldnt have to restart.  All the rest of your argument is moot; wow after letting it sink in you are fucking nuts if that how you think France is; they are debating a bunch of issues but you clearly have no idea what the yellow vest movement is about if that's what you think.  Geezus you're as fucking ignorant as Trump when it comes to the rest of the world
Edit: Did you even read the Atlantic article? It mentioned that Canada allows its applicants to stay in their home country while they wait so this mother wouldn't have to make the decision to get cancer treatment or apply - she could do both! So how about you pull your head out of your ass and read and think before posting whatever mush is leaking out from between your ears"
Foodforthought,fdhrk07,t1_fdhpf44,1578428785.0,"[American Exceptionalism at its finest](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/01/the-story-behind-the-poem-on-the-statue-of-liberty/550553/), you say that American immigration is comparable and that it's just as difficult to get into other countries but for some reason those other countries don't have the same immigration issues; noone is having their Canadian or French immigration process abandoned because it took so long they developed a health condition causing them to be rejected.  Pull your head out the sand and check that your country is fucked, get out there and fix it"
Foodforthought,fdhnr8b,t1_fdhcae4,1578426538.0,"I mean the issue here isn't that someone got cancer, it's that they have been waiting since 2017 for approval; why does it take so long, either the US needs to improve immigration services so they can completed in a timely manner or just stop accepting them; this is simply an underhanded manner to weed out poor people who can't afford to wait; if you don't want poor people to immigrate then just add a million dollar application fee, don't pretend that you're a meritocracy when every step along the way to immigration is a means-test"
hockey,fdepwf0,t1_fddob2t,1578344142.0,"I think what he said above is different, in that NBC doesn't show the whole event or even round, it just jumps from event to event to only show American athletes; I think most other countries coverages of an Olympic event would be of the entire timeslot at a single event, ie watch the hole round of women's javelin as opposed to cutting between 6 different events and only showing one countries athletes."

hockey,fca23qm,t1_fc7logq,1577561888.0,"Crosby and Ovi don't need money, they only play because they want more cups and/or personal pride; the NHL should use this opportunity to market other lesser known star players which don't have the recognition Crosby and Ovi have like Barzel, Carlson, Eichel, etc"
Music,fc7c3hj,t3_egepry,1577503099.0,"I don't know what the point of this post is, this seems completely reasonable, if your band has 10k followers and they all listen to 1 of your songs everyday or so you easily hit 3m plays; for a passive income that you are also collecting as an additional revenue stream 70% of subscription fees seems pretty reasonable.

Maybe I'm missing something because this seems completely fair to me?"
