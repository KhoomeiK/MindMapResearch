tacticalbarbell,fgh6io5,t3_evtxya,1580777858.0,"To be frank, I actually go for chest supported rows, or Rows where I support my upper body or head so I disengage my lower back. Also been trying to implement more chin-ups since its supinated instead of pronated, which has helped my shoulder a lot. I love pullups, but its become a detriment. 

If i want to hit lat, i let the row stretch the lat on the eccentric; mostly rhomboids and traps i just hold the squeeze and avoid overstretching. 

I read an article on Tnation about supinated vs. Pronated pull ups where the pronated is more like you're pulling something down and supinated is more like you're pulling yourself up vut bth are great! 

 anyways. . . I personally think that we should work on our mid-to-low traps since doing pull-ups and high pulls and the like are higher traps unless we go full gironda and chest to bar which can be exhausting. I've been doing scapular pulls and prone ywti along with face pulls and band pull aparts. 

But, I've been following soflete's acft prep along with a running conditioning program which is like im crossfitting to a degree.
