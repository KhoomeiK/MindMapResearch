Animemes,fd4mujp,t1_fd3vkpp,1578169024.0,"Protestants don't have priests, they have pastors, for whom the title is a job or volunteer position, separate from their potential vocation to the married life. As far as Christianity goes, Catholics, Orthodox, and Anglicans are the only ones who ordain priests who take vows, and it isn't just a job they can quit, it's their vocation. I believe some branches of Lutheranism may use the word as well, but then again Lutheranism is basically diet Catholicism (/s)"

AskReddit,fcyk3xx,t1_fcyho3a,1578081440.0,"It is a big deal. As much as bullying has affected you, it is affecting those you bully just as much, if not more depending on the person. You can't blame other bullies for your behavior. You are responsible for your actions and you have the choice to break the cycle and be kind to others. The moment we all start thinking ""It's the way of the world"" is the moment no one can be kind any more. I'm sorry that you've had to experience others doing horrible things to you, but this is no excuse for being horrible to the next person."

Sorry that you have to put up with relatives like that, it's not like you can just stop being relatives after all :/ at least you have the peace of mind to know you're being reasonable, even if it feels like you're going crazy trying to hold a basic conversation with them..."
Cringetopia,fcwh07t,t1_fcwgkx7,1578025390.0,"Oh totally. Ideally, your religion should serve as a guide to determining political stance, because if you follow a specific religion that implies that you adhere to it's teachings and/or doctrine. But for some people religion is completely separate from their political views and it becomes a game of association. I've met some rather obnoxious Christians myself who don't follow the very very basic teaching of Christianity, ""love one another."" Last I checked loving people did not include yelling at them for having different beliefs ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
Cringetopia,fcwfyon,t1_fcweryu,1578024626.0,"Not nearly as conservative as some Protestant sects. Catholicism is often labeled as right wing because of its strong associations and leadership in the pro-life movement. Other than that, Catholicism lies somewhere in the middle."

anime,fcvcm26,t1_fcvcjij,1577999287.0,Thanks for informing me! It's hard to tell whats true and isn't nowadays :/
thatHappened,fcvaq2u,t1_fcv8fg1,1577998169.0,"My mom was in NHS growing up, when it was actually somewhat decent as far as she's told me. I graduated HS with NHS on my college apps, and it didn't help me one tiny bit. Colleges could not care less that you were a member of NHS. Maybe if you were an officer, maybe? I had to transfer into my top school by working my ass off my freshman year of college because I wasn't accepted right away. NHS was a waste of time. But my parents get upset with me when I try to convince my siblings not to bother with it because they don't understand that no one cares about it now."

Edit: the caption on the post does spoil the manga just be warned"
KimetsuNoYaiba,fcv9kfh,t1_fcv8y0f,1577997487.0,"I feel bad about it because I understand not wanting to put ""spoiler"" as the first slide on your post because it makes your page way less attractive. And people are saying just unfollow kawanocy. They should be able to draw whatever they want, I totally agree. It's beautiful art. But it's sad for those who truly love this artists work but haven't had the chance to catch up to the manga or prefer watching the anime with suspense."
KimetsuNoYaiba,fcv8y0f,t3_eix9zc,1577997111.0,"I follow kawanocy on Instagram, and I love their art so much, but lately they have been posting straight up kny manga spoilers like this with no warning. I'm caught up so it doesn't ruin it for me, but the comments on those posts are full of people who are really upset about the spoilers. They are a HUGE account though so they haven't felt the need to stop."

Edit: someone corrected me - he does use assistants and that information was just a rumor after all! Sorry if I misinformed anyone"
