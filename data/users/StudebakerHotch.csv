TumblrInAction,ffn6d21,t1_ffn33m9,1580062509.0,"All words are artificial, and all deformations are thus artificial. All words are arbitrary by their very nature. This isn’t me talking - its Ferdinand De Saussure. 

What would you consider a “natural” deformation of a word? Why is common usage the only measure of meaning? Beyond that, are you so sure that it isn’t becoming common usage? Words and concepts don’t enter common usage over night. You know the word “biography”? It didn’t exist as a concept or even as a word as recently as 1599 - Shakespeare wouldn’t have known the word. Now, both the word and what it means are common. There were plenty of people who thought the idea of a biography was totally ridiculous, and now they are bestsellers.

I don’t see any evidence of censorship or fiat. Where are you seeing this? People aren’t going to jail for this. There is no government statute regarding it. It is true that our values are changing, but why is that a bad thing? 60 years ago it was perfectly acceptable to use the N word at work. Now, it will get you fired. Is that an example of censorship and fiat?"
TumblrInAction,ffn4oco,t1_ffmzjl3,1580062053.0,"You have to think about *why* people want to adopt certain styles and presentations. Its not that wearing men’s clothes makes you a man; its that you wear them because you want to communicate a feeling of masculinity that is already present. 

Think of this way: I’m worried about hair loss. Almost every single male is worried about that as well. The difference is that I’m worried about it for the very specific reason that it will make it harder for me to look like a woman. Most people who identify as men are not worried about baldness for that reason.

The motivation for wanting to wear a dress goes beyond the dress itself. If I wanted to just wear a dress, I could do that. I want to wear a dress because (other than the fact that I love them) its an expression of femininity that I feel inside of me. Its using the cultural language of femininity to express an internal sense of womanhood. The dress itself is beside the point."

TumblrInAction,ffmofih,t1_ffmlin4,1580057291.0,"I’m interested in why you don’t buy the difference between sex and gender.

Leaving out the criteria of what makes  a man or a woman is largely the point. Its a deconstruction. Sex is the same across all cultures and times; gender is not. Gender is a cultural understanding of a biological reality that varies from place to place.

Think of it this way: I have XY chromosomes, so its not acceptable for me to have long hair and wear makeup. If I was born in the 18th century, it would have been considered manly for me to wear silk stockings, wigs, or to tie up my natural shoulder-length hair in a pretty bow. Oh, and make-up too. What is the correct definition of manhood? A man in 1764 or a man in 2020? They have the same chromosomes but drastically different ideas about how men should act and dress.

Sex is the reason why someone born with XY chromosomes has a penis and body hair whether they were born in the 18th century or the 21st. Gender is the reason why men from one time cry and wear pretty stockings and why men from another time have buzzcuts and hold in their emotions.

Sex is a scientific fact; but gender is very much a cultural invention that differs widely based on where and when you’re examining."

todayilearned,ff93e0a,t1_ff92tag,1579703866.0,"Most soldiers in most wars don’t even die from combat - they die from disease. Your chances of coming home alive from an 18th century war were slim because you stood a good chance of dying from disease being mixed together with a bunch of strangers in a quickly constructed camp with even worse sanitation than normal.

Its not just about weapons. If you were an average soldier, your worst enemy was cholera and exposure. When Napoleon’s army retreated from Russia, more of them froze and starved to death than died from Russian forces. Sure, muskets and cannons aren’t as bad as machine guns and mustard gas; but being forced to march through a hostile wilderness with no food and a whole bunch of diseased, desperate men sounds lethal enough."

Nobody in San Francisco is interested in building a decent place for the homeless. Instead, San Francisco landlords are just interested in getting as much money as possible from their extremely profitable properties. The cost of living there is so high that you need to earn more than six figures just to be somewhat secure. This situation is created by landlords and maintained by them because it suits their interests. Its no accident that San Francisco is filled with homeless.

Or Los Angeles. 

Or New York City.

What do all three of these cities have in common? Extremely high rents and a huge homeless population. Keeping the rents high keeps the landlords rich and keeps the homeless priced out of housing. The landlords refuse to lower the rent to make it more accessible to the homeless. They are directly profiting by keeping the homeless away from what the homeless need the most. They are concerned purely with their own livelihood and they are fine with creating more homeless to make it happen."
