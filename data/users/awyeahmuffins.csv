personalfinance,ffg8z3b,t1_ffg7ebq,1579901034.0,"Definitely agreed, I could be overthinking everything at the moment. It’s still pretty fresh. The biggest bummer for me is that for my degree (Chemistry BS), experience, and location (Southern CA) I was paid pretty competitively I think. I just started searching in the area and a lot of similar positions only pay $12-15/hr. But I’ll just have to figure it out. Thanks for the help!"

personalfinance,ffg4hxz,t1_ffg3urc,1579898277.0,Is this dependent at all on number of hours or is it 1 hour contract work and all unemployment benefits go away?
corgi,ff7rb7x,t3_es3dw9,1579656462.0,"I've used a couple different brands but usually always come back to the ""2 Hounds Design Freedom No-Pull Dog Harness"". It fits really nice and it's good quality and held up for over a year now. We use a size ""small"" and have used that size since he was about ~5 months old. Now that he's fully grown (28lbs) we're at the max of the sizing and it's a little snug, but will probably stick with the small unless he gets any bigger."
corgi,ff7qbrw,t3_erwl6p,1579655775.0,"How much do you feed him now?

Before neutering at 16 months I was feeding approximately 2/3 cups of food 2x daily. After neutering I decreased slightly to 1/2 cups of food 2x daily to maintain his weight of 28lbs (he's 13"" ground to shoulder, 18"" shoulder to tail). This is for Purina Pro Plan food, which I recommend. Personally I find the suggestions of 2 cups per day to be a bit on the high end, even for a slightly larger corgi. But it may depend on his build and any treats, etc. you give him during the day. I occasionally give mine a greenie stick, bully stick, yak stick, handful of training treats, etc. without worrying about counting calories."
