dogs,ff3pyhp,t1_ff2am6n,1579546338.0,"You need to remember that we have been working with trainers for six years. I gave up on the last one roughly six months ago. We have tried to go slow, we have tried to curb it all at once. She was getting better about it until last year. I was admitted to the hospital for four months and we had no contact, save for ten minutes when my mother brought her to the parking lot to see me. We get her fixed and then the slightest interruption in her schedule throws her back into the aggression. No amount of training has worked long term, thus far."
sex,ff3o59q,t1_ff3knpz,1579545228.0,"It's a little upsetting that men are expected to just know. Everyone needs a little help sometimes. What an ex woman likes, is far from what your fiancée likes. It's the same when I start fucking a new guy. Show me where to lick, suck, or wrap my hand. Some dudes like some teeth, some dudes wanna be deep throated, and some just want hand jobs. I don't wanna deep throat him for ten minutes to find out he doesn't like it. It's easier to have him grab my hair and show me how deep to go."
dogs,ff2c7nm,t1_ff2b2nc,1579500390.0,She's a Toy Australian Shepherd/Cocker Spaniel mix. She is a lovey little monster
dogs,ff29o0q,t1_ff296m1,1579497940.0,"I was told to remove her when she shows the signs. According to the trainers, she needs to calm down completely before being allowed back with the rest of the family. As you can tell, I am struggling to keep up with that idea. She also will not take food if someone is in the room, she is not interested in toys, or even me touching her. Full fight or flight mode."
dogs,ff2906d,t1_ff28pch,1579497341.0,"Exactly. Like right now, she is stressing because it is bed time. She won't eat. Won't get off of my lap. I pulled her treats out and set them on the bed. Once she relaxed enough to get off of me I waited for her to look away. Then she got her treats. Now she is at the end of the bed. Asleep. Once I turn off the light, itll be a different story, but she has started to sleep while I am awake. And that's good enough for now"
dogs,ff27oua,t1_ff25jor,1579496193.0,"We did something like this with one of the trainers. If she showed aggression, she was removed and placed in the garage. She wasn't allowed back inside until she stopped screaming. And attacking the door to get to me. She was out there for about four hours every day until the trainer called it quits. I do remove her and put her in a separate room after she bites. I walk her by the scruff, then we listen to her panic for hours until someone gives in. Usually the room is destroyed and she ends up harming herself. Her most common thing is pulling out her fur from stress, leaving oozing patches of raw skin. The only time she is willing to walk away from me is when she feels like someone in the house is lonely. I've put about ten thousand into trainers. I'm broke. I can't afford another one"
dogs,ff217mj,t1_ff20m6y,1579491059.0,"I've been trying, it happens less now. When I first moved here my grandfather got bit twice in one week. He also sneaks up on my while I am sitting with the dog and I have headphones in. He will grab my leg and pull me off the couch to scare me. That stressed her out more than people coming in my room while I sleep"
dogs,ff1zi8i,t1_ff1y3rs,1579489824.0,"We have, as well as baby gates, however if she can not touch me, she often screams and panics"
dogs,ff1yznf,t1_ff1up8o,1579489448.0,"We have seen professionals, however the training got us no where. It is anyone coming into my room, physically grabbing me, or lifting me up. Those are the only triggers there seem to be. I can sit on the couch with anyone, I can initiate physical contact with anyone, they just can not initiate. It starts with a quick snarl, she only warns for about three seconds before lunging. I am able to stop her by scruffing her. She is fine with people coming into my bedroom when I am awake. My father can come in if he cracks the door and speaks to the dog directly, before approaching me. Other than that, she is perfectly well rounded. Anyone can do anything to her. Strangers can put their hands in her mouth, anyone can take her food from her (she steals from the other dog and is allergic to most food so we are always digging through her mouth). She loves everyone she comes across, whether she knows them or not. That's why I was thinking if rehoming would be the better option for her. Nothing we are doing is working and she is visibly stressed about it. I feel like I'm selfish for keeping her stuck here. She is the only thing that makes me feel safe, yet it's becoming hazardous to her future. It is my fault that she is like this, I let her protect me, I showed her that the behavior was good, but now it isn't. Now we are in a safe and stable environment, but she refuses to accept it. When we go to bed, she lays right by my side, staring directly at me. She refuses to sleep if I am asleep, I'll roll over and she will be wide awake, licking my hand and staring at the door. It's like she is always waiting for someone to hurt her"
dogs,ff1x1xa,t1_ff1uguo,1579488137.0,"I have thought about it, but we have not tried it yet. I wanted to bring it up at her next appointment"
dogs,ff1s4ks,t1_ff1rts7,1579484960.0,"We have tried several professionals, as well as two veterinarian behaviorists. I will admit, she has not had a lot of structure. We have bounced between homes and we were homeless for the first two years of her life. People can touch me, even if she doesn't know them. It is just when I am sleeping or don't automatically greet someone who walks into a room"

dogs,ff1pyv6,t3_eqpoak,1579483595.0,"Mine does it too! However, it's only ever sticks in boots. I don't know where she gets them, or how she gets them in the house. Maybe put your butter in the cabinet? That's the only way I can see you stopping it lol"
dogs,ff1oun8,t1_ff1oiar,1579482882.0,"I have been trying, my father and I worked out a method that works for her. However, the rest of my family just tends to walk in my room without warning. I have told everyone on multiple occasions to stay out or knock before entering so that I have a chance to scruff her before she reaches the door. But, no one listens to me because its obviously ""acceptable"" behavior to them"
dogs,ff1onrx,t1_ff1mvu9,1579482763.0,"When I scruff her, it stops immediately (I just grab her by the scruff and she collapses. I DO NOT SHAKE). If I ignore her, she makes these god awful noises for hours, before shutting down and hiding under a dresser. She then refuses to come out or go potty for a few days until I give her attention. She refuses to eat or drink, won't take the highest quality treats that she is allowed. I feel like when I ignore her, she just becomes more stressed out. I hate doing it, and I ended up quitting with that trainer after six days of my dog not eating"
dogs,ff1o67c,t1_ff1lreg,1579482465.0,"Everyone feeds her, she thinks with her stomach and follows everyone who has food. She is incredibly loving with everyone in the household unless I'm around"
dogs,ff1nryw,t1_ff1n3ah,1579482252.0,"She loves everyone out on walks, there have been several occasions where I have caught her trying to jump into other people's cars to say hi. I have hired several trainers to get aid, but they thought that it was too dangerous and stressful on her. She isnt aggressive towards people for any other reasons (eg people can pry her mouth open to take food). Nothing I've been doing has been working. And the only person that can safely come up to me when I'm sleeping is my father. I'm at my wits ends about keeping everyone safe. The best option would be to move out and get us our own place, however I'm 17 and my health isn't accepting of it at the moment"
dogs,fewf9tm,t3_eqohkm,1579409621.0,"I had a cupcake with a little laminate paper in the middle... I got it for my birthday. I hadn't gotten to try it yet and my dog ate it (this was several years ago). Anyways, she ate the whole cupcake and the note inside. She pooped and poking out was a laminated paper that said ""You are the bomb"". It was a big landmine, so I thought it was pretty great"

AskReddit,fclm8vb,t1_fcl9so3,1577751091.0,"Hello! Daily weed smoker here. I don't have a job as I'm on bed rest for heart failure. I've been using weed to help cure it. I struggle from anorexia nervosa. I have lost my hunger signals. As of such, I stopped eating completely and my body started eating at its organs. This is my third time in heart failure, I've been on roughly 15 different medications to stimulate hunger. None worked, they all had awful side effects (the worst was being unable to be awake or speak for hours at a time), I started smoking weed. I'm now gaining roughly a pound a week. I'm getting more stable. While it is fixing my want to eat, it is also dealing with the psychological conditions that caused my eating disorder. It is my medication. Like any medication, it has side effects. It just depends on what is best for you."
