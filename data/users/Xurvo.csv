You shouldn’t beat yourself up about it because attraction isn’t the be all and end all (theres a lot more to life and to your life) but the truth is looking good is important in attracting people. A big arse isn’t important to everyone but if it’s something you want or the people you’re attracted to are attracted to that go after it"

seduction,fdmwmz5,t1_fdmv6p2,1578569193.0,"Your dopamine receptors adapt mate, it works by threshold/tolerance. If you’re on social media for 5 hours a day (even an hour let’s be honest) natural hits of dopamine aren’t gonna satisfy you. A detox is needed (some games are bad for this, reward based ones; world of Warcraft can be really bad in my own experience)

Or find something to supplement it, I’m honestly pretty bad for this. I don’t use social media anymore (just reddit and I try not to use it too much, and I use it for things that interest me like the news more than anything). Personally I smoke a lot of weed and listen to music, but I could do without so much weed it’s just a tough one for me to kick. Ciggs too actually but I’m on and off with them

Probably best just to detox and find healthy dopamine releases. I probably get the vast majority of mine from the gym as I require it for
me to be happy, if I don’t go for a few days I get bitchy and groggy. Guaranteed after a workout for at least 3 different exercises I feel great. You feel the endorphins release after each set and you feel better and better after each set

seduction,fdmrdmh,t1_fdmr3k9,1578562010.0,"Then are you really enjoying yourself or are you just incessantly chasing craving like a crackhead who only has a 50% chance of getting any crack but goes anyway? Weird analogy but think if this is going to make you happy mate, there’s no point doing something outside of your character that you aren’t even going to enjoy just to get something that ain’t that great. I have no idea who you are so I don’t know if this is something that would make you happy but stepping out of your character and what you actually want to be doing probably isn’t worth it. Find a way you can enjoy yourself and meet people, if you aren’t enjoying yourself there’s 0 point to any of it
