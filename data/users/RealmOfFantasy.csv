Do you ever talk to these people about how youâ€™re feeling and how you feel like youâ€™re wearing them down? It may help how youâ€™re feeling and they may be able to reassure you and talk things out. Communication can change a lot. 
If you need to talk you can message me.
I hope you feel better ðŸ’œ good luck"
SuicideWatch,fcbqa9o,t1_fcbeb7k,1577589782.0,"Just a couple of hours ago I was wondering how people can enjoy such minuscule things when there are so many significant problems going on right now that itâ€™s almost impossible to fix. 

I only find joy in making other people happy, and I donâ€™t even know what happiness is. I feel like I fake happiness even for myself. 

Iâ€™m constantly tired and feel like my head is so busy. 

This life is hard but I hope you can find some solace in it."

awfuleverything,fba58ct,t3_ec0tso,1576665239.0,Iâ€™m surprised this many people actually sit on a public toilet seat. Interesting
