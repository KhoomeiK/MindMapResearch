Screen goes black, only player 2 is visible. P2 can move freely for 5 seconds. Everything goes back to normal, except player 2, whose character is forced to repeat those moves, while P1 (Terezi) can move freely and attack. Player 2 would have to get creative and move (and possibly attack) in a way that, no matter what Terezi is going to do, minimizes the risk od them taking too much damage for the normal-ish 5 seconds. Terezi on the other hand would have an advantage - she would know what her opponent would be going to do, and she would have to counter it. Also, funny stuff would happen if player 2 tried to use their own ultimate inside Terezi's Black Box (as I would call it)."
