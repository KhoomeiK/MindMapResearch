If you're looking for the answer in moving forward with your life, here it is: It's you. You're the answer. Just look at your reflection in the mirror. You may not see it now, but you are clearly strong for staying alive on behalf of your daughter for more than a decade. I wish you well, and I am sorry you feel hurt and confused."

Others are like you - less expressive, but just as human. A lot of us then feel tempted to compare ourselves with others, especially those who seem happier at first glance, but really - once we start to think about it more - people who smile often might still be going through a lot more pain than someone else who rarely smiles. People just hide pain better than others. The people who are seen as ""more expressive"" than you are not any better, I promise. Wish you well in life."
