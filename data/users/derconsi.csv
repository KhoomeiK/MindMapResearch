Obviously there are more than plenty. I still believe that there will be unqualified women in leading positions, since that Happens with men too (We really aren’t all qualified obviously), but I step back from the statement that this problem would be affected by a quota.

Thanks for clarification"

SelfAwarewolves,ffacewy,t1_ff9rggu,1579732244.0,"If the main reason to vote a woman is a quota not her qualification the chance to vote for an unqualified woman to meet this quota is higher.

This is really not that hard

There are as many qualified women on this planet, if not maybe even more, I really don’t know, nor do I care.

But the argument I just stated for the third (?) time stands and is the reason I am against a quota. 

Don’t give the sexists fuel for their crusade by making it easier for unqualified people to be part of this.

(In this case its women, but ONLY because this is the group which would be affected by this quota)

SelfAwarewolves,ff9fjke,t1_ff9aw3e,1579711932.0,"Yea and that has to change, but by enforcing a 50/50 split via law there will be unqualified women in the process.  That will strengthen those who believe that women in general are unqualified for this job and in the long run harm equality.

Gender equality is important, but enforcing it by law will set that back in the long run"

Would a vote by qualification split in roughly 50/50? Yea and It would be great, but asking for qualification instead of enforcing equality is better Imo, since the only difference would be that there would be as much unqualified women as unqualified men"

While Skandinavia, like sweden tries to reintegrate people into society, america locks them up and throws the keys away. If you look at reoffending statistics, you‘ll see that I am right about the following: locking them up like animals makes them animals. (I‘m not saying that everyone who did prisontime in America is an animal, I am saying that it was made way harder than it had to be. If it worked out, Im happy for you, but you know better than me, that it must’ve been a really hard time readjusting and that a little support on the inside could’ve helped)"
