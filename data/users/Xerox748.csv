todayilearned,ff7t63r,t1_ff7b3hc,1579657748.0,"Right. Their argument boils down to:

>Sure, there were all these other Brady violations before this case, but because the Brady violation in *this* case was related to blood evidence, how could they possibly know it was wrong to have evidence that someone was innocent and prosecute them anyway?

It’s a nonsensical argument.

Also, again, this completely ignores the fact that the DA checked out *ALL* the evidence from the police evidence locker, walked it over to court, and submitted everything *except* the evidence that exonerated him, which conveniently just vanished into thin air. If you’re going to be willfully ignorant of how nefarious that is, you’re not arguing in good faith."

todayilearned,ff71z8j,t1_ff6jsxa,1579639519.0,"That and the thousands of other cases of wrongful convictions, and executions.

You want a really fucked up case look up 2011’s Supreme Court ruling Connick v. Thompson.

The tl:dr is basically that the DA’s office convicted this guy of murder, had multiple pieces of evidence the whole time proving that he was innocent, and not only did they not disclose that, which they’re required to do by law (called the Brady Rule), they actually disposed of some of it. Hid the evidence that exonerated him, and prosecuted him based on the circumstantial evidence that they could use to make their case.

He spent 18 years in prison, 14 on death row, almost executed, until his lawyers uncovered proof that the DA had evidence that exonerated him. He got out. Sued. Jury awarded $12 million. DA’s office appealed, appellate court upheld lower courts ruling so the DA’s office appealed it to the Supreme Court.

Are you ready for the kicker? The Supreme Court struck down the lower courts ruling in a 5/4 decision, saying the DA wasn’t responsible. That there wasn’t a reasonable expectation that the DA’s office should have known what they were doing was wrong, and that they were required to turn over the evidence that exonerated Thompson. *Even though* Thompson had shown there had been 4 convictions overturned before his case for the same violations, where the same DA’s office hid evidence that exonerated the people they were prosecuting.

The conservatives on the supreme court argued that because in Thompson’s case it was specifically blood evidence the DA was hiding, and in those other 4 cases it wasn’t “blood” evidence, just regular evidence, that it was unreasonable to expect the DA’s office to know they were doing wrong by hiding evidence that exonerated him. 

Yeah, it really is as stupid an argument as it sounds. They conveniently ignored the little detail that the DA checked out all the evidence from the police station, walked it over to the court, and submitted everything they checked out *except* the pieces of evidence proving his innocence, which just magically disappeared.

So in the end, Thompson, an innocent man spent 18 years in prison, 14 on death row, was almost killed, and the conservatives on the Supreme Court said, “tough shit. You don’t get a dime”. There were no repercussions for anyone in the DA’s office who essentially got away with attempted murder."

I’m not sure why there’s this war against comparing. Comparing one to another is a great way to illustrate a point.

I’m not equating the two. I’m not elevating the bully’s actions to the actions of Bin Laden.

I’m using Bin Laden as a reference, someone most people would know of, and agree that there would be celebration upon learning of him developing cancer. Much in the same way there was celebration upon his death. Bin Laden’s purpose in the discussion is to establish universal agreement that there are situations where celebrating someone getting cancer is a reasonable response, or at least an understandable one.

Using that as a reference point, we can then turn to OP’s bully. Someone no one other than OP knew, and who’s actions are unknown beyond the ambiguous “bullying” which can range from name calling to physical and sexual assault.

Since we don’t know what he did, or how devastating the experience may have been to OP, it’s hard to say wether or not celebrating the news of the Bully getting cancer would be a reasonable response. But because of our reference point, we can at least say that there are situations where it would be reasonable.

Obviously OP’s bully isn’t responsible for the deaths of thousands of people, he’s not Bin Laden. Obviously if the bully had called OP fat one single time, it would be unreasonable to celebrate the Bully getting cancer. But somewhere between those extremes is the line where it is okay to celebrate.

I don’t know where that line is, it’s probably a very subjective line that depends on the person, and the situation. At what point do allow OP to celebrate? Does he have to be physically assaulted, or is one punch not enough? What if he held OPs head in the toilet until he almost drowned and developed pneumonia? Is that enough? How about if he forcibly sodomized OP with a broom handle?

All we know is that for two whole years this bully made OP’s life miserable. Maybe it wasn’t enough to warrant celebrating a cancer diagnosis, maybe it was. But in general we can at least establish that yes, there are some cases where bullying is extreme enough and damaging enough to warrant the victims of that abuse celebrating."

todayilearned,fecfwbu,t3_eoaso2,1578972942.0,"Pretty much everyone I work with has a college degree or beyond, but one guy I work with who didn’t go to college, talks about his old life from time to time before working with us. Mostly welding, with some construction, farming, and auto work thrown in. He always talks about how glad he is to be out of that life and doing the work we do.

The thing about many of those jobs that he really rails against is how brutal they are on your body. Welding payed so much better than what he’s doing now, but at the end of the day he was physically exhausted. And then he had to wake up the next morning and do it again. Our current work can get kind of sedentary at times, but he can and does go to the gym to counteract that. There’s no anti-gym to alleviate the daily wear and tear on your body that more physically demanding labor does. He talks about how glad he is to be out because of the high burn out rates too. People he knew worked themselves too hard or even just working a regular amount, would throw their back, or their knee and that’s it, one way or another it wasn’t long before they didn’t have a job, and had a hard time finding a new one, especially a new one that paid decently. And to have just a major physical breakdown as young as some of these people are, means their later years are going to be even harder than the average elder.

I have a close friend who’s brother had that happen. He made decent money working a warehouse but after a few years he needed spine surgery and couldn’t work anymore. He’s lucky that it happened after Obamacare so the medical bills didn’t bankrupt him, and he’s young enough that it’s relatively easy to go back to school. But if he didn’t have insurance, and had been 5-10 years older, his life would completely fucked.

No one should be ashamed of blue collar work, but I hesitate to say “there’s nothing wrong” with those jobs. There’s a serious problem with the physical toll on the bodies of people who work many of them, and at least here in America, when their bodies are broken, society largely casts these people aside, and doesn’t provide a decent path to alternative careers with adequate earnings. 

Not all blue collar jobs are like this but there are a lot that are, and it’s a problem that’s rarely, if ever addressed by people who champion blue collar paths."

I’d like there to be an actual story happening outside in the real world with characters I care about. The people surrounding Desmond were interesting and felt like an actual part of the game as opposed to just kind of being there. The outside world has really lost the plot post Desmond and it needs to get back on track in a meaningful way."

Fucking Republicans complain about people on food stamps, the poorest of the poor, buying a can of Coke, meanwhile this asshole worth hundreds of millions, is lining his pockets with hundreds of millions more by stealing your hard earned money.

And before all the spider apologists start chiming in to say they aren’t *that* big and they’re not venomous: 

First off, they’re not as big as some fake internet stories about them, sure, agreed, but they’re still 10x bigger than anything I’ve ever seen in my house, which is already 10x bigger than I’d prefer. 

Secondly, get the fuck out of here with your non-venomous bullshit. You know what else isn’t venomous? A knife. Are you okay getting stabbed just because it’s not a venomous knife? Didn’t think so. And these giant fucking bastards have two big ass knives ready to stab you the first chance they get.

I’ll grant you, Iraq isn’t Australia when it comes to spiders and other creepy crawlers, but fuck those desert spiders.

Also just as an aside, they can run at a speed of 10 mph. Fuck that. Fuck everything about that."

Why do you think “Trump’s” physique is so bulky? Why do you think you never see them in the same room?

Because it’s a freaking body suit! Obummer is in there pulling the levers!
