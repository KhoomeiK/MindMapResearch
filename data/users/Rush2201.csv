monsterhunterrage,ffpwvdv,t1_ffplkbd,1580108907.0,">Things to note is that mhw has always been way harder on the processer than most other games. The AI is especially to blame for it, it particularly chugs when it comes to Luna spamming her heal interrupts and chasedowns.

I don't know about the other things you've said, but the idea that the AI in MHW is soooo complicated that it eats your CPU is absurd. Those kinds of checks you're talking about are nothing to a CPU (basically ""if X, then Y, Unless Z""). Kerbal Space Program is tracking and simulating more things than any monster in MHW, but it doesn't fry a good CPU. MHW, particularly after Iceborne, kills cpus because of poor optimization (base game had that too) and a more invasive anti-cheat that's constantly checking and rechecking files to look for tampering. Don't believe me? If you've got it on PC, run CRC Bypass and watch your CPU load drop by 10%-30% depending on your processor.

Also, any chugging you're experiencing on Luna is probably from the sparky graphical effects during her fight, not because she's calculating you to death with her AI."

monsterhunterrage,ffpe7ow,t3_eue0yf,1580092836.0,"I'm up the the guiding lands, not quite MR 49 yet, but Barioth is the hardest monster I've fought in IB. What weapon are you using? When I first fought him, I was learning SA, and he was being a total asshole. When I did this event quest, I've picked up GS, and while it took me 20 minutes solo, I smashed this jumpy tigerbat with 0 faints. And I wouldn't even say I'm good with GS (I whiff my TCS so damn much). Anyway, if you're using ranged, I can't really help, but for melee hunters:

Start the fight by trying to tenderize his wings, and focus your attacks on them until they break. If you're having trouble getting thrown off, use the evasion mantle before clawing. Once he's tenderized, try running him into a wall, mounting him (not claw mount), flashing him out of the air, or catching him in a trap. These will provide windows for you to damage the tender wing and break it. Also, after you run him into a wall a time or two, he will enrage (icon turns red on map). Try to save your real mount attack for when this happens, as you can't send them into a wall during rage mode, but normal mounts can still down them.

Like Teostra, he likes to hop around an boop you on the nose. There isn't really a defense for it, and it's pretty annoying, but it doesn't do much damage, so try to take it in stride. His fight, at least with GS, is about chasing him. He's one of those annoying ""hop in, attack, hop out"" monsters, so I spent a good deal of the fight with my sword on my back sprinting and rolling around his attacks. This is a good time to watch his moves and learn all his tells. It may just be me, but I have a hard time telling his tail swipe from his shoulder tackle. His shoulder tackle is a pretty easy opening because his tail doesn't seem to have a hitbox, so I just run for the tail when I spot it.

Having a healing palico is handy. Mine sucks 90% of the time, but he did keep me topped up pretty well over the fight. I think I used like 5 mega potions. I brought Temporal and Rocksteady mantles, as they're my standard loadout for most fights. Remember to use nulberries to get rid of iceblight. Bari's icy tail move and frost spit can inflict it. Use flashpods when he's in the air spitting his two tornadoes. I know they've been nerfed into the ground, but you should use every tool you have in that arena. Also, wall attacks (where you sprint into a wall, run up it, and jump off) can be used on those tree trunk things with the netting. Those will help non-IG/Lance people to get their normal mounts off. If you farm up some whetfish fins (especially the + version), those can help combat sharpening immensely.

Hope some of those tips helped. Barioth is a total dickbag, and you've gotta respect him. Bring your gadgets and your A-Game, and he's doable. Some patience when he's in constant jumpy attack mode helps, too."
