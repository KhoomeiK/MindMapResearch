MurderedByWords,fe9q8i6,t1_fe9lo9d,1578940481.0,"The point is that just because these smaller countrys can do these things doesn't mean we can. The ability for australia to control it's people compared to america is astronomically higher. They have a much smaller population, and also they have much fewer laws regarding the rights for a person to own a firearm. therefore you can take it away a little easier.

I believe it can kind of be summed up by either;

The bad guys will just keep their guns and fuck shit up worse than they would normally.

or

Why do I have to get rid of my stuff because some mentally unstable dude got his hands on a gun?

Australia also had something else going on. IIRC the gun violence rate was already on a very steady decline well before the banning of guns."

American gun laws vary state by state, but a general rule (at least in my state) is that you don't have to have your rifles/shotguns registered with the government.

Therefore, if someone who was mentally crazy, or some dude who owns a lot of guns just so happened to feel like it, what would stop them from just not turning in their guns.

Energy behind it is this. We made drugs illegal, and half the U.S. has tried marijuana in their lifetime. There is no physical way we can do something on that large of a scale without restricting some people who did nothing wrong."

I swear there are some extreeeeme examples. Such as:

Reddit saying that they dont like reddit censoring things and accepting investments from chinese censorship powerhouses, then when the other political side of reddit gets unjustly purged for no reason at all they say that private companies dont need to allow free speech.

Reddit being against racists and then letting r/chapotraphouse and r/FragileWhiteRedditor make front page.

And finally,

Reddit saying to have a civil discussion while people mindlessly downvote a comment because they disagree with the poster's views on completely different subjects. (u/userleansbot is used for this though all it does is scan left wing subs.)

You can probably get an example of this on this post, where people are gonna see that I'm a right leaning neutral, and then downvote this post into oblivion.
