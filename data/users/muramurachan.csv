It was a short convo so right now I don't know, but unfortunately I can't change the title. Thanks for the input, I realized that oversight myself and I plan on talking to him more about it later. But for now i think it's better to call them open and questioning."
polyamory,ffcdlm9,t3_esvij6,1579797169.0,"I just wanted to share that my stepdad recently came out as poly to me. Apparently, him and my mom have been talking about it for years and when I came out as poly they ""weren't surprised."" It's beautiful that he's almost 60 and has the courage to be himself. I am very thankful he opened up to me and I feel closer to him more than ever.

Edit: I didn't talk to him for long, but right now I would define their relationship as open and questioning. He might still be poly (loving multiple people), but he didn't go into enough detail."
polyamory,ffccb6o,t3_ess7p9,1579796366.0,"I heard about poly from a partner who opened their relationship. To me, it made sense. I had been unhappily monogamous with some swinging involved, as well as Relationship Anarchist, pretty much my entire life. So when I was included in a poly V, I started researching poly and what it meant.

It was an easy jump from being monogamous to actively poly. I just extended my RA to romantic relationships and bam! It's still a struggle because most poly people aren't RA, but all and all I'm much happier being poly than mono. I just had to realize that poly was a viable relationship model for me and what my version of poly was."

bipolar,ff6hwlx,t1_ff6h9a9,1579627558.0,"Oh yah, of course my moods affect me. But so would taking meds. Some of the side effects seem like they don't help at all to me, like
""nausea, increased appetite and weight gain, loss of sexual desire and other sexual problems, such as erectile dysfunction and decreased orgasm, fatigue and drowsiness, insomnia, dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation."" 

Additonally, not everyone responds to medication the same way. So I might not have all the side effects but experience a few of them very intensely. My moods affect me, but not enough to go through the emotional and physical gymnastics of finding the right medication to find a fix that I don't really think I need."
bipolar,ff6h1kx,t3_ervdes,1579627029.0,"This message against the stigma of bipolar disorder is a great message. Regardless of where the statistics come from, it is important for people to realize that bipolar is a mental condition that, in some cases, needs treatment. 

Now, not all people experience their bipolar condition in the same severity and frequency. I consider myself a high-functioning bipolar person. I get mood swings often enough and was diagnosed bipolar early on during adolescence, but very rarely do I have intense episodes that leave me unable to do necessary functions like going to school or work.

Therefore, I don't take meds. I think the danger of side-effects of taking the medication that I don't necessarily need far outweighs whatever benefits I could get from the meds. If someone is unable to function and their bipolarity conflicts with their lifestyle, then yes I would encourage them to seek help and treatment.

I think the important thing is to try to be happy and healthy as much as possible. Health is all encompassing and is often too complicated to be a single issue. Like if a bipolar person was smoking, what would kill them first? What is their diet like? How much exercise do they get? Do they have family history of diabetes, cancer, or heart disease?

In short, I think it's important to erase the stigma of medication for bipolar disorder. Not everyone needs meds, though. We should all try to be healthy and happy by living a healthy, active lifestyle while regulating our moods and seeking fulfillment in our lives."
depression_partners,ff3m3wb,t3_er8jxh,1579543968.0,"I would also recommend just asking if they would use a diary. Or if a diary would help them. I know you probably want it to be a surprise, but to be honest some people hate surprises or react badly. I don't think it's overstepping a boundary unless you guys had talked about no surprises or no journals as a rule; it's more you don't know what the boundary is in this case. And when you don't know a boundary the easiest way is to just ask about it and have a discussion."
polyamory,ff3l1ez,t3_erb8mt,1579543309.0,"Like other people have said, totally sympathize and feel for you. I've had a relationship with a cheater too; when I had made it clear all he had to do was tell me when he would have a new relationship. Even worse, he brought her to our apartment under the guise of ""being friends"" multiple times.

Cheaters won't change because of anyone else. They have to realize their toxic actions and make an effort to stop on their own. Sometimes this takes years and sometimes they never change. I don't think it's fair to you to drag yourself through their mess. Think about yourself when you break it off, and just continue to love yourself and take care of your own needs. It will suck, but it will get better.

Edit: also yah like others said definitely get tested again and it's completely on you if you want to make his transgression public. What he did affects his and your partners and their partners and so on, not just current partners but future as well if some STI was contracted. It's a domino effect that he completely disregarded. That's very irresponsible and he is a danger to the poly community."

This is so messed up; I think that there is no obligation to a kid who isn't biologically yours. That just doesn't make sense to me. I mean, what about a woman having a legal obligation to kids from another marriage? That's institutionalized sexism if it doesn't work the other way around. 

Totally support reforming child support/custody laws to be more equal between sexes."
depression_partners,ff3dgbl,t3_er0atr,1579538901.0,"Hi, thanks for posting your story. I don't think I'm familiar with your original posts, so it's nice to meet you!

My bf of 3 years also suffers from depression and has talked about living on his own. We've lived on and off together because of military obligations and other jobs, and in total we've lived separately for about half of our relationship. I can try to think this through with you, and tell you what we have done in our situation.

Why does your partner think he has to move out? The job sounds like a diversion from the real issue; he could get another job instead. For us, it comes down to my bf's need for control of his life and independence. He also struggles with taking care of household chores and finances. Separately, he still struggled with chores, didn't really take care of himself, and he was also pretty lonely because his anxiety would prevent him from going out and making connections with other people. So, while he continues to think about living on his own, he is hesitant to put himself in that spot again. At least together he doesn't do any of that stuff alone, and I could handle the basic necessities.

For people who feel like they need to handle their stuff on their own, that's fine until you're suffering from a debilitating condition like depression. It's okay to need help sometimes. Maybe your partner is struggling with accepting your help and that's why they want to move away. Maybe they feel intense guilt and it is a barrier to them accepting help? Do they have a therapist, and is that therapist challenging him to confront that part of depression?

In our situation, we established boundaries to make living together better. When he wants alone time, I give him his own space for however long he needs. That can be difficult when I have emotional needs but he isn't available. When I need companionship, I turn to my friends and mom instead so that I don't dump my feelings on him in his vulnerable state. I still talk to him about my feelings when he is not depressed, but not during. I also keep a journal so that I can record my intense emotions, and come back to it when I'm more levelheaded.

To make me feel better about the first boundary, we also established ""date nights"" on Saturdays, where we would do something just the two of us. Last Saturday was a nice walk in a park we've never been to, with a cactus garden, just before sunset. Even though it was only a couple hours, it allowed us to reconnect and finally relax into the moment.

We also have no expectations of chores being done by either of us, and that means yes sometimes the dishes pile up. One of us does it eventually, and that's fine, but it's not used against the other person or causes any resentment. As for his finances, his money is his. I realize this doesn't work for severe cases of financial instability, but allowing him to budget his own stuff helps with his sense of independence. As long as he pays his half of the rent and groceries, he can use his money for whatever else. 

That ""no expectations"" philosophy has helped us out the most. I've asked him to not make statements like ""I will do this"" or ""When you get back, this will be done"" because the reality is that if he's depressed it might not get done. And that's okay. Getting rid of that expectation frees us both up to do what makes us feel the most fulfilled. If he does the dishes before I get home, I am pleasantly surprised, if he doesn't then we just watch a TV show and go about our lives like normal, no harm no foul. If I bake the cake for his birthday, he's so happy, but if I'm too tired from work and instead take him out to dinner, he's just as happy. No expectations has improved our lives so much, for both of us.

So, I hope you get some good ideas from this long post. If your partner does move out, my opinion is that it isn't really a danger, it just might not solve anything because sometimes it's more difficult to do things alone than with a partner to support you. I suggest you two talk about the real reason why he wants to move away (for control, independence, escape from guilt, feeling trapped, etc) and try and think of ways to help your situation together by establishing some boundaries that work for your relationship."
depression_partners,few2t5g,t1_fevw5xy,1579404673.0,"Congrats to your ex, hope it all works out!"
depression_partners,fetbdrf,t3_eqft6z,1579373612.0,"Hi, my partner also suffers from depression that leaves him in bed for multiple days at a time. It's definitely very tough to work through, and he feels guilty every time he has a depressive episode because I pick up the slack of chores.

Now, I'll put a plug in that you two seem to have a very strong relationship, so what if it's not romantic/sexual at this time? I think that you both have the most important parts of any romantic relationship: compassion, respect, and love. It's great you're giving your ex the space he needs and I think that's very admirable.

Yes, maybe your ex's therapist isn't challenging him enough. Why does your ex feel like they need to be alone? My bf says he feels intense guilt and low self-esteem when he's depressed, so sometimes he'll take long walks because he can't deal with the chores, me, and life in general. He also listens to chillstep in a hot shower. Sometimes, he takes a hit of CBD, which helps with anxiety. He has an addictive personality too, so we have an agreement that when he isn't depressed I keep the CBD pen. We don't keep alcohol in the house, etc.

It sounds like you've both done great in keeping your relationship the priority. You aren't responsible for his depression, you can only support him--and he said that you already do support him so that's perfect! Try and talk about alternative ways in which he can cope with his depressed feelings while also being with you. Maybe it starts with you staying over and spending a night with him while he is depressed, or taking a walk together when he has feelings of needing escape. Being together through the tough times helps him see that despite his depression, you will still be there.

Depression will never go away, but I think it's way better to tackle depression with someone you love than alone."

You have no idea what generation any of us are, and you have restated what some of us have already talked about just repackaged in your own ""moral"" opinion.

None of the previous posts ever brought up ""dump them"" as the first option. In varying degrees and in different ways, plenty of people have talked about how to make it work and what things to talk about to try and come to a compromise in a poly-mono relationship. However, forcing people to be in an unhappy situation is abusive. There are some poly people who are unhappy in a mono relationship and some mono people unhappy with a poly partner. That's a completely okay feeling to feel.

Why is it so important to you how other people conduct their lives and relationships? I understand you have a different opinion on relationships, and that's fine, but it's when you put down an entire generation and become a complete biget that it crosses a line. Taking the moral high ground is pompous and very ignorant of other people's struggles."

polyamory,fem58rl,t1_felurkk,1579240207.0,"Communication and compassion go a long way. Coming together and getting down to your own individual needs before thinking about any relationship type really helps. We all have our biases that affect our perception. But what are the essential needs? Can you get them met with one person, can your partner get them met with you while you're poly and they're mono?

Needs are often mistaken with insecurities. Like I have a fear of adandoment, so at first I thought poly was meeting that need. But my fear isn't a need, it's a crutch that prevented me from realizing that poly fulfills my more base need of community. Monogamy to me never gave me the community I've had with poly. To have partners and metamours who all genuinely cared about me was something that made me feel so great, to have people who identified like me or were sympathetic to my poly relationships, it was acceptance of who I am.

Now, focusing on both of your real needs, you gotta ask each other those hard questions. Would you be okay if I dated other people? Why? Is there any way we could introduce another relationship into ours? What about no sex? Likewise, ask yourself equally hard questions: Why can't I be mono? What will I lose? What will I gain? How could I be happy in a mono relationship?

If the answer is that there is no feasible situation in which both of your needs can be met to the point you feel you're both happy and secure, you two are incompatible. It hurts, and it sucks so bad, but that's how relationships evolve sometimes. Individuals change and either the relationship changes with them or the relationship ends.

Try your best at making it work, put 100% of your brain power and love and compassion into talking about it with your partner, and see where it goes. Wish I could give better advice but things like this really truely are up to what you two can come up with together."

Yes, we all have a choice to live a life that gives us fulfillment. LGBT people can stay in the closet, and poly people can act monogamous and probably be a little happy. But I haven't felt as alive and loved in my entire life until I came out first as bisexual, then agendered, and then poly. It's all part of an identity, of how we feel the most happy and accepted in this hetero-mono-normative culture. I didn't choose to be poly, I chose to be myself."

It sounds like you feel pressured to make this choice not because you think it's a good time to open your relationship but because you fear your relationship will suffer if you don't (and maybe suffer if you do open it). 

I suggest, if you haven't already, talk to your partner about your fears. Ask if you wanted to stay mono, would she stay mono with you? More than that, contemplate what would make you secure in your relationship. If she says she would prefer poly, then you have a choice. You can choose to try poly with her, you can choose to remain mono while supporting her trying poly, or you can choose to leave the relationship. I think that talking about your fears and relationship security with your partner will make all these decisions easier, because then you'll know where she stands and where you both want to go."

However, a secondary lover can feel cut off from their partner because the primary lover will seem more important. 

There is definitely the danger of one of you wanting that one-one monogamous relationship again, but that's what exploration is. You tried it and it wasn't your cup of tea. It might still be your partner's thing but it doesn't have to be your thing. Hopefully, your partner will understand and you both continue to love each other.

unpopularopinion,feklb46,t3_eph6e5,1579202419.0,"I agree, but not in the context of animal rights. I agree because abusing animals is a very real symptom of psychological illness that could lead to becoming a murderer.
 
A few decades ago there weren't any laws against stalking. It took quite a few murders before stalking was punishable by law. Those new laws have probably saved many lives. Likewise, if there were laws against abusing animals that result in jail time, society would shame animal abuse and be more aware of the negative implications of that behavior.

I love animals and someone abusing them is very alarming. But to bring animal rights into the equation by saying animals deserve the same rights as humans therefore means that animals are punishable by human law. Equality means equal rights and punishment under the law, after all. Cats torture mice and birds, dogs hump people in heat, does that mean they deserve to be punished by our laws concerning murder and sexual assault? No, because they're not human."
