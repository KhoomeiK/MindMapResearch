nextfuckinglevel,ff3of9l,t1_ff3hhyt,1579545404.0,"The population you are referring to is in the minority. You also can't take your comment about fathers not wanting to get off their asses for their kids and back it up with divorce rates. Divorces happen for a number of reasons, and you can't correlate that with fathers who spend time with their kids.

I'm sorry about your experience with one person using drugs, but that in no way proves what you're trying to say here. One experience does not show any sort of pattern.

Are some parents lazy? Yes. Do some parents do drugs? Also yes. Do either of those points mean that most fathers are too lazy to get off the couch and spend time with their kids? Absolutely not.

Your opinion is uninformed and coloured with biases. Just because some people have a hard childhood or uninvolved parents, doesn't mean that ""most"" parents or fathers are like that."

AskReddit,fek684d,t1_fek4fsh,1579193462.0,"They went over the different types of IUD's and the pros and cons of each one of them. For example, copper IUD's are a good choice for people who can't use hormonal birth control, but they are known to increase cramping and bleeding.

Hormonal IUD's, such as the Kyleena or Mirena, are the most popular options. The Kyleena is good for about 3 years, and will most likely regulate your period, but probably won't stop it. The Mirena, which is what I have, is good for 5 years, and has a good chance of lessening or even completely stopping your period. Aside from some light spotting in the first couple months, I haven't had a period since I got it put in. It's glorious.

Of course, there are downsides to using IUD's compared to something like the ring or the pill. IUD's only release progesterone, not estrogen. This means if you're using your birth control to control other things like acne, the IUD won't be effective in that area. 

There is also the danger of an IUD becoming dislodged or displaced. It's uncommon, but it can end up puncturing a hole or moving to somewhere it isn't supposed to be. This not only makes it ineffective, but can also be dangerous. This is why it's important to check every once in awhile that you can still feel the string from the IUD, or go for regular checkups. If you can't find the string, doctors will do an x-ray to make sure the IUD hasn't fallen out, but you should always ask for an ultrasound. While an x-ray can let you know that the IUD is still in (because it is possible for them to fall out), only an ultrasound can let you know that it's in the proper place."
AskReddit,fek2z0p,t1_fej7gf5,1579191506.0,"I keep trying to explain to my boyfriend what I go through when I get a migraine, but I don't know what to compare it to because he has never even had a headache. I also live in an area of the world that has Chinooks, so I get weather induced migraines a ton during the winter.

A couple months ago though, I got a daith piercing, as they're supposed to help reduce or stop the pain. I went from having one or two migraines a week, to maybe one every few weeks. I get the other symptoms without the pain sometimes (fatigue, nausea, etc.) but I would much rather deal with that every once in awhile than pain in my head that prevents me from functioning."
AskReddit,fek2gx4,t1_fej8y3f,1579191198.0,"I've never been pregnant, and I've never had a pap smear, so my OBGYN recommended that I be put under for the IUD to be put in. I went to the hospital for half of the day, and the most painful parts of the whole ordeal were when they couldn't find a vein to put the IV in, and the cramps I experienced afterwards. 

My OBGYN was super careful though. They sent me for an ultrasound beforehand to make sure everything was fine before they shoved an IUD in there. I also attended a short info session about how IUD's work, how they get put in, and the pros/cons of having one. Of course, all of this happened in Canada, so none of this cost me anything other than my time.

I feel like I was pretty lucky with my experience compared to some of your guys' stories. I can't imagine how much pain that must have caused."
