confessions,fdh5vw5,t3_elasr5,1578416049.0,you were a dumb teenager. we all were. just in different ways. your guilt shows that you’ve grown and changed tho. don’t beat yourself up about it too much. you obviously feel regret and that’s enough. I really really wish you the best though and I hope your wife makes you happy

dogs,fcu77f7,t1_fcooar2,1577974204.0,if you aren’t using a lead maybe a harness would be better. it doesn’t tug on their necks and choke them but still keeps them under control. definitely invest in a good solid fence if the dogs are going to be kept outside without your supervision. better safe than sorry. good luck

dogs,fcn56te,t3_ei1exn,1577803567.0,There isn’t enough information here. Why was your dog off a leash in the streets and you were in a vehicle? Does your dog usually have any road sense? Dogs don’t think like we do. She could’ve have known the road was dangerous. Why were the pups even in the streets in the first place? Keep them in a carrier of a very short lead until they’re trained to walk outside.

Pets,fcb963c,t1_fcb8vt1,1577583991.0,maybe speak with your brother about it. if he enjoys your brothers company so much there must be a reason
Pets,fcb8t64,t1_fcb8kl3,1577583857.0,do you still do that now? consistency is key. he needs to know that you’re there whenever HE needs you. not whenever you need him. (not criticising by the way. just curious)
Pets,fcb8dd3,t3_egzbpx,1577583693.0,have you ever been with him on your own? just you and him bonding? him being alone with you on multiple occasions could make him feel safer. one on one time with each other. doesn’t have to be in the house. walks can be fun too. training can really bring you two together too. but keep it fun and don’t get frustrated with him. or whenever you see him give him a treat. you will associate you with tasty treats and keep coming back. you can eventually take the treats away from the situation when you are comfortable with each other and he knows you’re a friend.
entitledparents,fcb7k2k,t3_egwpyu,1577583387.0,thanks for being an awesome uncle for Kevin. hope he gets out of this situation soon
entitledparents,fcb773p,t3_egwpyu,1577583256.0,I also don’t like kids therefor I won’t ever have any. don’t have kids if you don’t like them because you won’t be able to take care of them. my mum nags me about not wanting kids but if I ever did I wouldn’t be able to look after them because I don’t like kids. I’m assuming something similar happened here. people need to stop putting pressure on people to have kids because shit like this happens!
