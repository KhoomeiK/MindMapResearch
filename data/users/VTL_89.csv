It’s not because you have a slow metabolism and you aren’t actually eating 1200 calories a day, you are either lying or *horribly* misjudging. There is no magic way either. No green tea or apple cider vinegar or refraining from carbs after 8 is the trick to losing weight. Caloric. Fucking. Deficit. How to get that deficit? Eat less or move more."

It’s well established that BMI isn’t really intended for those people. I’ve even seen BMI charts that explicitly say something along the lines of “disregard if you weight train”. The problem is that there are obese people that say shit like “SaQuOn BaRkLeY iS oBeSe BmI” to discredit the whole thing. Truly muscular healthy people aren’t really concerned what their BMI is and their doctors aren’t concerned either."

news,ffpn59y,t1_ffotkw5,1580099258.0,"I agree with all of this. I've been in a few rehabs and due to the age demographic of the heroin epidemic, a lot of these kids have either never had jobs, lost their jobs, or have done random jobs, and on top of that, pretty much every heroin addict has a record. When they sober up and start thinking about their future in rehab (which is great), for the guys it's usually ""I'll look to get into construction"" or someone saying ""I can get you a job doing whatever blue collar thing"" then there's an older cat their teaching them how to do that. But my point is that it wasn't blue collar shit that led them to addiction, but rather than addiction leading them to having a record and then that leading them to blue collar jobs."

nfl,ffkcbkf,t1_ffk3x2x,1580020435.0,I mean pretty much anyone on an NFL team in 2020 would shit on 1970's Hall of Famers. Laquon Treadwell would have 2500 yards and Andy Dalton would throw for 6000. You have to scale it for the time period or else the list doesn't work. You're not gonna have a list for baseball and not put Cy Young just because Matt Joyce would take him 400 dead center every pitch. That's why it's 100 Greatest not 100 Best.
