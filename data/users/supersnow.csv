aww,fep5621,t1_fenyytq,1579312368.0,Both of your dogs are so cute.
aww,fep5298,t1_feodvdo,1579312298.0,"""I promise I will be good ... please Mom"""
aww,fep4qcm,t3_eq4bl3,1579312091.0,Still not sure if I am a Llama person or an Alpaca person. They are both so cute. But a really interesting fact is that llamas and alpacas are closely related that they can be crossbred.
forestgardening,feo7pts,t3_emsogt,1579296293.0,"I love the idea of converting our lawn. But without getting out some heavy equipment to till the entire area, our grass would just take over again. What do you suggest? We are in a dry low rainfall area with very hot summers and frosty winters. We really don't have the money to hire equipment to till the entire area - as our front yard is large and would take forever to do by hand. We do have some garden areas but they have been taken over by grass. We have tried woodchips, cardboard etc. But maybe you have some better ideas."
forestgardening,feo6zu2,t1_feddpob,1579295913.0,Good to know - we are in a very dry area and ours haven't really done anything. We do have a rat problem over the last few years - never thought that our hugelkulture might of attracted them.
aww,fenz64o,t3_eq272x,1579292974.0,So cute - we have a Russian blue siamese and he is so vocal. Loves to tell us that is coming in from outside .... at 5am in the morning! The whole house gets woken up.
pics,fenyqdf,t3_epvhfy,1579292743.0,This is so beautiful - what is your instagram handle so I can see more?
pics,fenxkk9,t3_epzobw,1579292301.0,It is like a baby ewok - too cute
aww,fenhxwc,t1_femh7d4,1579285072.0,"I know right! That cat is so cute and just sits there. But really do you think a cat would get out into the cold snow? It was probably thinking ""when is this going to be over so I can go back to sleep inside"""
aww,fenhnip,t1_felrpsz,1579284892.0,That was cool - loved that you even fixed the hand color!
pics,fenh2oj,t3_epp6lh,1579284535.0,Wow! What beautiful art - I hope you have your work in a gallery somewhere.
aww,fengtnc,t1_fen0k4x,1579284381.0,Wow that must have been pretty freaky to have the baby deer just jump up like that.
dogemarket,fengdkn,t3_elsic3,1579284108.0,Do you have any examples of your work?
dogemarket,dkbga5v,t3_6n7zto,1500260455.0,I'll take the remaining at $1.50 per kilo. PM this shibe.
