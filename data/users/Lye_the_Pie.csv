todayilearned,ffdh71j,t1_ffcxzot,1579820789.0,"What's interesting is that, when I was learning about ancient/middle ages Arabia, it was flipped. The main cities' dialects were considered polluted because so many foreign traders would come in, so they'd send their kids to the bedouins in the countryside to learn proper Arabic. Not sure if this was the case in other cities. I guess it depends on how much foreign influence they had and how much of a bubble they lived in."

todayilearned,fehj130,t1_fegqxf4,1579117538.0,"Thank you for that detailed explanation. I'd only learnt about it at a more basic level before.
One thing I didn't understand was when you said ""until there is not enough mass"". Where did all the mass go? I thought it was just being compressed. Was it converted into energy and released in the fusions?"
Futurology,fehhj8s,t1_fdl1f8i,1579116660.0,"This just makes the peanut butter thing even more hilarious. XD I'm so curious to know where that came from.
Maybe you saw one when you were very young and you thought it was peanut butter or someone told you that it was?"
Futurology,fehhdsb,t1_fdl3ige,1579116570.0,"Oh true. Chia seeds do do that.
I've never had a chia pet (besides on Neopets XD) but had food and drinks with chia seeds in them. Was so grossed out the first time I saw them in a drink. Reminded me of frog eggs and I wasn't aware they were just seeds."
explainlikeimfive,fehh26q,t1_fdktw4m,1579116382.0,Interesting. I'd love to see if that's true or if the brain uses more than that. For some reason it feels like the brain would use more to me.

IAmA,fehg7v5,t1_fefhp6q,1579115892.0,"Honestly, if you want advice on how to fast, there's no better group of people to ask than Muslims.
We fast dawn to dusk for a whole month every year and many of us do it outside of that too (3 days a month, 2 days a week, or, for some that can really handle it, every second day).

Here are my personal tips (for someone with no significant health problems):
-Eat protein and natural sugar early in the day. Nutritious and a mix of fast and slow releasing energy. Something like dates, nuts, yoghurt, milk, honey. I don't eat much in general so that usually gets me by on days I fast. I've noticed I get more hungry earlier on the days where I ate a lot in the morning. Probably kick-starts my metabolism too much.
-Self-restraint. You just need to practice and force yourself. It's hard at first but you'll get used to it and it'll become second nature. The discipline you learn from fasting is a /very/ transferrable skill for other aspects of your life."
