Pets,ff6j51b,t1_ff5vpjz,1579628312.0,I had an armpit sniffer. He would go up behind strangers and sniff too if I wasn't paying attention enough to where his nose was going to keep him away. *embarrassing*
dogs,ff6gyof,t3_ern4mr,1579626979.0,"This dog is likely scared, not just trying to elude people. In situations like that it's probably best to set live traps."
dogs,ff6fj6b,t3_ervc5u,1579626090.0,There are lots who live together just fine. My girls are quite happy with each other and more bonded to each other than to the male in my household. No reason to stress unless you're seeing problems.
dogs,ff64ntu,t1_ff64byw,1579619034.0,"For the ones that I've had outside for various times and reasons, they run happily into the kennel in the mornings and relax in there. They nap, play with each other if there are two, chew bones, eat food. It's normal life for them sometimes. If you just throw a dog in there with no acclimation or introduction to it, they may very well be scared, but many dogs aren't."

dogs,fened2j,t1_fendr60,1579282880.0,"There's so many I want! I am trying to keep myself to one every 2 years or so, I think that's a good rule for me. I think I have to cap myself at around 6 dogs; I have 3 now, and it feels pretty empty ever since Najib left us. Everything you've said is true about ""too many"". I don't like that there's a stigma with re-homing dogs for that reason."
dogs,fen7e0e,t1_fen4fws,1579278596.0,"There are absolutely zero dogs of my breed in shelters in the U.S. right now that were not imported from foreign countries. There is one dog who is a very special case who is in a foster home with other dogs of his breed, just FYI to preface this. 

It is in my puppies' best interest to be raised in the home with us. There is no way to regulate that adequately. That doesn't mean that other puppies shouldn't be raised in other ways, but I can't see a better way for my breed and with my low number of dogs. Why do they have to eliminate on grass or dirt? I put mine on concrete slabs in a covered kennel when they were little for their safety (I could spray it down with kennelsol). They had a litterbox area in their indoor pen. I put them on grass later, around 7-8 weeks after their first shots, but some breeders don't like to have their puppies outside at all before they go home because of past experiences with disease. 

I am reluctant to put breeding limits on bitches because of the massive variance between breeds regarding breeding age and number of litters, and the way each one recovers from a litter. I also would really hate for an ""oops"" to not get registered if it didn't meet one of these requirements because they happen even to the best breeders. I would not have a single one of my dogs if a bitch's litter was restricted from registration due to an accidental litter, or an old bitch, or a too young dog, or a bitch who had had a lot of litters, or a too close breeding. If you go back far enough into pedigrees you will find it all, for literally every single registered dog in existence. That doesn't mean that we should be aiming to breed too much, or too old, or too related, but just that I would be reluctant to support a hard restriction on such things. I have passed on puppies from breedings because I though there were key components missing for it to be reputable in my eyes. Education is really the key to a healthier dog population and happier owners and dogs. 

The people who are managing close line breeding in reputable programs are not the problem for shelters. It's people who put two dogs together in their backyard regardless of the dogs' health, accomplishments, temperament, or pedigree and then sell those dogs in a Walmart parking lot or craigslist somewhere with no contract that requires the dog come back to them if it doesn't work out. Occasionally someone is elderly and a hoarding problem comes to light, but that is much rarer, but sometimes that's where purebred/show dog breeders will get blamed. 

Every reputable breeder requires that the dogs they produce come back to them if unwanted or have a contingency plan for a dog that doesn't work out. They are not reputable if they don't do this. Equally responsible are owners who drop off the face of the earth and don't honor the contract they sign with their dog's breeder. 

There's also big differences in how related a whole population is between breeds. I do think it's important that each breed follows the parent club recommendations for health testing, I would be behind requiring certain tests for registering litters for dogs born after a certain year posted publicly (as to not preclude frozen semen). I would also be behind mass DNA testing for dogs born after a certain year to prevent paper hanging, and a microchipping requirement for registering so all puppies are tied to their breeder somehow."

Anyone in the area that is interested in different breeds, especially rare breeds, should go."
dogs,fen18gi,t1_femyez4,1579274701.0,"This is definitely an outlier. My pack of Salukis only run an hour a day typically. Sometimes two for the youngster, but 2-3 is a lot daily!"
dogs,fen0kjp,t1_felzbjf,1579274267.0,In regards to the prey driven breeds and cats -- lots of people do live with combinations of sighthounds/primitive breeds and cats. They tend to have the best luck with puppies raised around the cats and cats being kept indoor only.
dogs,femyrih,t1_femyf40,1579273045.0,"I don't think they're corded right away, but I don't think they exactly brush them either? I know you can keep them brushed out as pets -- I wouldn't want a corded dog either. Too much work and there's too much mud on my property. It would be like a dirty sponge walking around my house, ick."
dogs,femxx9f,t1_femxm4f,1579272466.0,I think they still go through a lot of maintenance to get neat cords when they're first beginning to cord. They definitely need to get used to a grooming routine.
dogs,femx6qk,t3_epzhmb,1579271942.0,"If I took every excellent breeding or puppy that I’ve passed up over the years, I would be a hoarder. There are always excellent puppies around. So keep that in mind. That being said, too many dogs is the number of dogs where you would feel overwhelmed either with the time commitment or the expenses."

dogs,fejviqe,t3_epcn48,1579186816.0,"It would be worth doing a urinalysis and a culture just to see what comes up (beyond infection, maybe crystals?). They may also want to do some bloodwork to check for kidney function. 2-3 bowls of water seems like a lot for a single dog (but that's just comparing to my own dogs). Diagnostics beyond that might include an ultrasound which is understandable to not want to do right away ($$$)."
dogs,fejop73,t3_epcry9,1579181828.0,I would try to get something used probably. You can cut a lot of the cost off by just getting something that isn't new. Also I have to empty them every day.

dogs,fejko6o,t3_epftvo,1579178110.0,"There would be no reason to make the mix because they are really quite opposite of one another; the temperament would be very unpredictable. That being said, there's not a breed or mix that's genetically incompatible with another. You would have to do artificial insemination with the borzoi being the bitch because of the size difference."
dogs,fehevyl,t3_ep62ma,1579115112.0,Lots of whippets live with cats; they do best if raised with them from puppyhood.
dogs,fehej08,t3_ep5dxl,1579114901.0,"I certainly have experienced both with the same puppies! I think we talk about puppy blues a lot because a lot of people experience buyer's remorse and need to be reminded that it's just a phase and to hang in there. Puppies are hard, especially for people who are new to dogs. I miss my puppies when they're no longer puppies, but they do get easier as they get older. :)"
dogs,feh3vhk,t3_ep4081,1579108600.0,"You'll probably want to get a diaper for her. You might notice her be clingier. No contact with other dogs for 28 days. It's not a big deal for most dogs tbh. My girls have always been basically the same, maybe a little sharper with each other."

dogs,fedk8zo,t1_feazh3q,1579013624.0,"No homeless dog population problem. Cancer is a flip of a coin, especially in male dogs. I do think bitches not used for breeding should be spayed after a season or two. Diapers work well and crates and expens, but what masochist has white furniture with dogs anyway (ha ;)). Humping is a behavior you can train out. Have had several intact dogs & no children being humped."
