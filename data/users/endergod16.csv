mildlyinteresting,ffqtla1,t1_ffqp5nx,1580143341.0,"No, sir, it's called a joke. What I would actually do is wear one of them and just leave the other one at home. Both of them buying something that looks that expensive means that they care about you so both items have a sentimental value."

When he got me a PS2 and I wanted to play a game with him I'd have to wait cause he'd be going through a copied version of the manual and circling/underlining things that are important. Makes sense since he was a construction inspector. It's in his nature.

A little bit later I woke up to pitter patter heading toward my room and saw a dog nose peek in and Molly pushed the door open and jumped on my bed and I hugged her. I ran into my parents room and told them what happened and they revealed that they had put her down. To this day I can't explain what happened.
