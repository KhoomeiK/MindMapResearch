If you don't think adam and eve is real do you believe god sends people to hell? Why is your version of christianity true and others not? 
    
How does science, evolution, and biology undermine christianity?  
    
The easiest example of this is science and biology proving that gay behavior and trans behavior is hardwired by biology and isn't a product of the mystical underpinnings of sin.
   
On that same point it proves the bible isn't even a reliable source of morality considering the hatred, bigotry, and racism it perpetuates with condemning & ostracizing LGBT people. 
    
Need I bring up the bible's original stance on slavery, rape, and the treatment of women.?
    
If you don't think science has anything to say about morality then i would recomend glossing over what sam harris and robert sapolsky have to say abou it because your wrong. 
    
We can't prove god is real for the same reason we can't prove fairy's or unicorns are real. They are all unfalsifiable which allows anybody to come up with whatever interpretation or theory that could possibly confirm a preconceived belief (dillusion?). 
    
This is why there are endless denominations and interpretations. It's no different than pagans arguing over whether fairy wings are blue or green, but if you believe they are green then you belong to the Eastern green Fairy Star Temple of the True Eternal Sky.

Either way if I don't donate this organ they will die and if I do decide to donate I put myself at risk of death & unknown health complications down the road leading to a lower quality of life.

It might not be apples to apples comparison, but I think it makes a good point. A women gets pregnant. The  unborn child, fetus, clump of cells can't survive/live without the help of the host/mother.

Why is it different. Carrying a pregnancy full term is alot more involved than donating an organ and can also put your life at risk. Why should anyone be more obligated to birth a child than to donate an organ. Both scenarios involve loss of life and risk of death."

Transitional fossils bridge gaps between two species. Due to the difficulties in creating fossils in the first place, and the fact that speciation sometimes occurs very quickly in small groups, transitional fossils can be rare in the fossil record. However, even given these circumstances, there are still thousands of transitional fossils known to science, including those illustrating the evolution of modern fish, the transition of fish to amphibians, amphibians to reptiles, reptiles to birds, reptiles to mammals, and the evolution of human beings (as well as many other species).
