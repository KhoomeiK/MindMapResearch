todayilearned,ffcrmb9,t1_ffcm5wo,1579805829.0,...?you are incredibly ignorant of how the law works. Can't arrest someone for murder if they never find the body or any evidence strong enough to convict someone of murder.

sports,ffa6kum,t1_ff7w8sn,1579728873.0,None of the things he's doing are indicative of CTE. He's not beat the shit out of someone like Ray rice or kill someone like Hernandez. Don't always be so quick to give pieces of dirt the benefit of the doubt.

MovieDetails,ff4fi0g,t1_ff3xelf,1579562368.0,A drug addict telling you something isn't used for drugs. And you believed it. Huh
videos,ff4f9fl,t1_ff3aufp,1579562206.0,That logic you're using is the dumbest thing I've ever seen. Like if you can't let people learn from their mistakes why would they even bother to fix them.

MovieDetails,fel301a,t1_fekz676,1579212952.0,Definitely the second one. If you see the way he reacts to the thief in batman begins he doesn't seem out of touch in the slightest and knows how bad things can go in a single momeng

MovieDetails,feevxov,t1_fecdhyg,1579042371.0,Yes it is 100% the only way to have a gun they give to cops is to take it without permission. And it's not very easy to do that to a cop that's still alive
trailerparkboys,feeuuro,t1_fec5tpl,1579041707.0,Nah he's actually just an idiot as it's objectively good and funny. Especially if he's still sending you shit about it. Sounds miserable

worldnews,feei8jc,t1_fedl6se,1579034281.0,No that's more like saying those people should've been aware of the tensions and stayed away from the area. This is more of a condemning of trump for being directly responsible for the death of almost 200 people.
sports,feegpkf,t1_fee8ib5,1579033400.0,Nope that's wrong. Wnba media for years has insisted they have talent like the men do so they should be paid like that. A quick google completely exposes your comment as off base and just as a matter of fact untrue.
movies,feeflwr,t1_fedznwd,1579032757.0,No more like she just doesn't actually have talent and doesn't deserve to have the job she does compared to the millions of talented people that weren't born into a music execs family. But you can do your shit social commentary anyways nbd
