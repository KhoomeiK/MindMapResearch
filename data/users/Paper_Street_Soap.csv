YouShouldKnow,fffmkmw,t1_fffedd6,1579887194.0,There's a lot of competition in silicon valley and unemployment is low.  Good luck!

knifeclub,ff3vsb9,t1_ff3l216,1579549931.0,"I agree that it's smart to elevate some new/obscure makers offering intriguing designs.  I just think this particular design is way too derivative and really shouldn't have been put into production.  But that's just my opinion, of course."
knifeclub,ff3h2na,t1_ff3bs7a,1579540879.0,"well, he's not entirely wrong.  WE and other chinese manufacturers have been heavily courting new makers/designers to crank out production versions of their knives.  And they're not all home runs."
hiphopheads,ff1c3pp,t1_feznln2,1579477367.0,"That's a falsehood.  Any fixed blade (e.g., kitchen knife) can be pulled out with the same or greater quickness.  Or most basic folding knives for that matter (except two handed slip joints)."
hiphopheads,fezk7n2,t1_fezdamr,1579458217.0,"Lol, ""auto-stabbing knives"" are empirically not super dangerous."

Audi,fen0uv2,t3_epvuh8,1579274457.0,Any major maintenance issues in the past 10 years?
spyderco,fekty3s,t3_epowt3,1579207539.0,"FYI, there is a known clone of this knife on Aliexpress, I would exercise caution if you are considering buying it.

law,fehx8p3,t1_fehhjzb,1579125677.0,"I'm no expert, but from my casual understanding, there are actual legit cases of companies actively culling their work force of aged employees (e.g., IBM).  I'm not aware that the reverse is anywhere near as common place.  Correct me if i'm wrong, of course."

movies,fdqzw09,t1_fdqst2v,1578677623.0,"I agree that it was ""slow"", for lack of a better word.  I think that all the other comments (SLOW?, LOL, WAT?) are missing some nuance.  For me, the movie was saturated with anticipation, suspense, and associated dread.  But that's it.  I wasn't relieved by the ending, rather I wanted a bigger pay-off for all that build up."
modernwarfare,fdlk38n,t1_fdliw9e,1578525801.0,"I totally understand and this game can be very frustrating at times.  Heck, about 8 years ago I got burnt out on MW2 and switched to Battlefield for a less claustrophobic experience."
modernwarfare,fdlhasf,t1_fdkxrdp,1578524006.0,"Well, I disagree with everything you said, and I don't care to offer any formal rebuttal because it would simply take too much effort.  Take it as a win, or don't.  Whatevs."

NoStupidQuestions,fc1yngb,t1_fc1xa2w,1577333860.0,"What you provided isn't an ""alternative"", it's what nearly everyone says kids should do in bullying situations.  And if it was so effective then OP wouldn't have needed to make this post in the first place. So, besides self defense, what advice do you think trusted adults should give to bullied kids when they are outside their sphere of supervision?"
NoStupidQuestions,fc1x4rz,t1_fc1wsnm,1577332431.0,The same way everyone else manages to avoid getting targeted.  It's not like the bully got punched in the face 99 times before getting to the one guy who wouldn't.
NoStupidQuestions,fc1w93u,t1_fc1vno9,1577331649.0,See my response to the other guy.
NoStupidQuestions,fc1w6l8,t1_fc1var9,1577331590.0,"I agree, that is the best place to start.  However, since  it's rather common for adults to fail in these situations  and since bullies generally target the weak, then it's probably not a bad idea to make yourself a less desirable target in one way or another."
NoStupidQuestions,fc1ukbc,t1_fc1t7p3,1577330176.0,Then what's your suggested alternative?
