You need to accurately describe what’s happening & how you’re feeling &’side effects of meds for you.  Write notes if you need to.  Doc’s job is to assess that & recommend solutions. That part isn’t your job. Remember meds aren’t perfect. You’re looking for the best balance between benefits vs side effect that you personally experience. It’s a trade off.

Still, I’ll suggest, perhaps look around for translation help, not specific to healthcare / depression. I’m in the US.  Here I would look at my university social network to ask if anyone who is a good bi-lingual is willing to help. You could trade services, offer something you’re good at.  Maybe tutoring in your field.  Or I could look at any of the gig networks & offer it as a task. I’m guessing there are equivalent things where you live. One piece of depression (16 years experience here) is believing no one would want to help you. That negative self talk is just not true, but it might take some looking.  You can do this!"

Coping mechanisms needed until you can move out. They say junk to you, you chant in your head “water off a duck’s back” “in one ear & out the other” whatever works for you.

(I get it, my sibling specializes in ass chewing).  Anything giant, such as a life threatening health battle, will narrow their ‘bandwidth’ dramatically.  Maybe they don’t need extra info right now or maybe, just possibly, your message rubbed them the wrong way in its wording. Shorter, brief, is likely better.  Perhaps 
consider messaging BIL one more time & ask him what is best for them. State that in the past, you have gotten chewed out for it not sharing such information, so that’s why you informed them this time. That you feel damned if you do & damned if you don’t when really all you want is to let them know what’s going on, to whatever degree of detail they want to know.

Protect you & your child by calling police, locking doors , being proactive in whatever manner in necessary?   This is SERIOUS.  Sister is not to be in your or LO presence under any circumstances.  If either of your parents is likely to break this rule by bringing her with them, for example, then they get a long time out before they get another chance to be with their grand baby.  
Your sister’s behavior is NOT NORMAL & NOT ACCEPTABLE. Sounds like your family has been rug sweeping for years.  No judgement from me, my FOO has done the same thing for my sister for decades. Your sister is a clear & present danger to you & your LO. Your parents have allowed her to develop into an unchecked danger. Other posters have given great advice. I beg you to follow it. Get prepared because I fear this is going to get worse. Look over the information in the JUSTNOMIL sub, it is very educational about recognizing & planning for behaviors, etc. Lot of great info there.

He uses his free time to work with underprivileged kids.  He knew his skill set, found a way to earn good money, set his lifestyle well beneath that so his free time could be used doing his passion. I found his story so interesting.  
I personally know a kid who mowed yards in middle school to earn spending money. Got so many clients, had to hire some friends to keep up with the workload. The evolved into a lawn & landscape business by high school & the kid didn’t go to college bc the business is doing so well.

You might want to check out r/justnofamily  as in “ just no, I can’t even”  Also, am I the asshole.  Those descriptions might help you figure out if your family is truly this unsupportive or are you not stepping up enough. It’s likely a blend of the two.  You are 20 & still living at home. If your goal is to move out & you’re buying time while you save money or something, you have to take action at home to make that time more tolerable.

Hugs for the emotional roller coaster about learning the gender & then oops we read the scan wrong sorry!  Hugs hugs hugs & one tip that worked for me re: anemia  Cook & eat ANYTHING in cast iron cookware. If you don’t have some, see if you can borrow & start right away. Or buy I suppose. The science is that iron leaches from the cookware into the food, dramatically increasing any food’s iron content. My first test, I was borderline anemic & doc said we’ll test again next time & put you on pills if needed. Meanwhile, I researched what I could do. Yea, yea, the list of iron rich foods, that’s a start. I found a study — and I’m making up the numbers but the point was it was THIS dramatic an increase:  spaghetti sauce in regular cookware was 3 mg/whatever measurement but prepped in cast iron the same amount skyrocketed to 87 mg/whatever. As I said, 16 years ago so I can’t link to an article or remember precisely. We already had one cast iron pan, so I choose to cook a hamburger 2 times a week. That was enough iron for my body & avoid pills. Remember I was measuring borderline to start with. If you’re quite low, you could cook everything you can in it.   Hope this helps!  Good luck.
