bipolar2,ffai3kf,t1_ffabfhi,1579736256.0,"So true, just got out of therapy literally ten minutes ago telling my therapist the same thing. In the depths of a depression, especially manic depression, it feels like eons since you were last happy/normal, and it will feel like eons until things will let up in the future. You will always feel an abyss of hopelessness and despair."

BPD,ff5v96x,t1_ff5cigx,1579611434.0,"And to add, just because you don’t have all the symptoms doesn’t mean you don’t have it. You can be clinically diagnosed with at least five out of the nine traits in the Diagnostic Manual."

GetMotivated,ff19x32,t3_eqz4w1,1579476682.0,"I just started internalizing this Friday. Someone who i suspect doesn’t like me at work (constantly dismisses me and acts like i don’t exist), let the door close in my face. I sat at my cube feeling embarrassed and hot to the point of tears. I wanted to tell him off so bad to make him feel how i felt. But i decided to breathe deeply so that the feelings would subside. Right before leaving, we cross paths but he had to weirdly hold the door for me.  So i politely say thank you, and went on.

I felt better knowing that i could be mature about the situation and not let the previous situation change who I was or how I reacted the other person, which was something I’ve been doing a lot for the past couple of months. 

Walking home I even came up with a mantra to save on my phone screen so that I always remember how to react in the heat of the moment. These are the ways I want to treat people so that I can feel good about myself at the end of the day.

Good, not Bad
Nice, not Mean
Help, not Hurt
Peace, not Pain
Light, not Dark
Love, not Hate
Live, not Die"

washingtondc,fenzpay,t1_femz3li,1579293072.0,"Walking up is worse for me. The higher I go up the more it feels like I’m going vertical. I have to concentrate on looking up and forward. Any thought of how far down the platform is from me and my legs turn to jello, my hands get sweaty, and I feel like I’m gonna fall straight back down the escalators."

videos,fenuig6,t1_femxqw2,1579290978.0,Why is that a quote (quote worthy)? Is it because you’re not from America? Most Americans say that phrase in some fashion or another.
amiugly,feggmad,t3_eoo86g,1579092101.0,"I would assume you’re never have a problem with attention from girls, and that you’d either always in a relationship or have a potential somewhere nearby. 

As a lady, I think all cute guys have a load of girls lined up waiting to be the next one to get chosen.

Edit, I don’t know what’s up with all the fuss about your hair. It’s super cute and i would leave it as is."

How do you feel now, OP?"
depression,fegewls,t1_fega63p,1579090398.0,On point.
depression,feemesv,t1_fedw01c,1579036704.0,"I actually get this too as a woman. I start to talk about my vulnerabilities as a way for them not to hold me hostage in a way. Suddenly, the other person starts to talk about them or something completely unrelated and I become the therapist or listening ear. I’ve found therapy as a way to get everything out to a third party that’s paid to listen to me.

And the part about feeling like an oddity is common with our kind. It’s funny that we feel like we’re the only one going through this “thing” when there are so many others going through the same thing. Even the people who seem like they have everything going for themselves. I think that’s why i go back to being gracious for the things we have like health, freedom, etc. There are others are envious of what we have.

And yes, again this is hard to do. Hell I don’t even follow my own advice. It’s so much easier to fall back on negative coping skills because it’s easy and familiar. Learning healthy ones are *so hard*."
depression,fedsqbc,t3_eom9dq,1579019087.0,"I’m in a similar situation as you, good life, some friends, active life when I’m not glued to my bed, from the crippling depression of course. 

But also like you, i have a shitty non existent love life with no one viable to share it with. The last guy i was with did a number on me, belittling me to the point that he destroyed my confidence and self worth, and i begged for him to come back even threatening suicide. Effing mixed episodes. Finally over that, but still unsuccessful in finding that missing piece

I wish I knew what to tell you, but nothing has worked for me either. Or, there are other things that are working like therapy or meds, but it’s so slow that it hardly feels like there’s any progress. But with most things in life, I think it’s about taking it one painful day at a time, and remembering all the things you are grateful for. One day it’ll happen for you and all the shitty days will feel like a far off memory. Yes I know, so much easier said than done, but I honestly don’t see any other way at the moment."

PCOS,fedj7du,t3_eogyko,1579012893.0,"Yes! I love to get my cycle that’s because it means I’ve ovulated 14 days ago. And with ovulation that means i had a serge of progesterone, which makes me feel more womanly than ever.  💁🏽‍♀️"

depression,fedfv88,t3_eofgoa,1579010398.0,"Ehh, it can be a double edged sword. Imagine being a favorite person to someone you can’t stand or if it’s romantic, someone that’s unavailable. Torturous situation for different reasons.

It’ll be nice if you were each other’s favorite. That’s the ideal."

BPD,fdjv2b8,t3_elm39b,1578488454.0,"I feel this way, but what gives me a shred of hope is that my looks are validated externally from other people. Otherwise i wouldn’t know how to cope. But honestly, when people do compliment me or flirt i doubt their judgement and think they’re not all there, or they’re trying to take advantage of me in someway. This is heightened when I’m having a down day."
BPD,fdjuodi,t1_fdjrn4k,1578488092.0,The part about not recognizing yourself is so spot on. I feel this because i feel like i never look the same from pic to pic. And don’t let me see a video of me in action; i want to crawl into a hole for the rest of eternity...*sigh*
BPD,fdju2kb,t3_elm39b,1578487507.0,Well of course darling.

Blackfellas,fd7l9ef,t1_fd5iuk3,1578206224.0,"Same.

I got 20 hydrocodone pills after a 2 wisdom teeth extractions (went under with general anesthesia also). I didn't touch one pill and got by with 800 mg Ibuprofen instead. 

They did come in handy for those ever so often menstrual cramps from hell that were resistant to regular pain meds."

Went to get lower face done and got lasered on areas that didn’t need it (cheek and back of the jaw bone) and hair started to grow there immediately. Suffice to say I was effing pissed and ended up in an electrolysis chair shelling out even more money to fix something that wasn’t broken in the first place."
