Of course the Chernobyl tragedy played a large part in this, and Academician Legasov participated most actively in eliminating its after-effects. 

Legasov is somewhat of a tragic figure. He doesn't appear to be a bad person, but the comma or period he will leave behind is a paradoxical one. He serves as a great example of people's collective stupidity and ignorance."

Bastion is a part of an answer and will literally matter. He doesn't play the game 1v6. This is a GOATS focused post, obviously. He will deal significant damage to the protection a GOATS composition can put up and his crits at closer ranges against piles and big bodies will do significant damage. His spread is intentionally increased as he can be quite a toxic hero with a narrower spread due to moderate to long range reach yet not as effective in the relevant condition here of shorter range. Given the size of barriers and Mei's wall he is roughly equally effective against those. Like I wrote, I thought the developers made a smart decision when they increased his spread a while ago.

Splash damage adds onto direct damage? I also gave ranges.

Tracer's ability is actually extremely useful particularly when playing against Torb's Turret, but against Bastion too. I wanted these heroes to counter GOATS, not take out dive as well. The specificity is warranted.

...Genji's Deflect here is intended for damaging projectiles - Torb's Turret and Bastion. If people don't stop shooting at him every second otherwise then he will indeed have an extended Deflect. That seems to be a learn to play issue. I don't understand your sliding scale suggestion clearly."
