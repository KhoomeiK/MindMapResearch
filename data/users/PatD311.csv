IllegallySmolCats,ffb9uh4,t3_esllld,1579756593.0,There’s definitely a BOLO for this cutie! Detain and evaluate for intense smolness and scritches!💜🐾
DeadBedrooms,ffb9euo,t1_ffb4lkm,1579756051.0,Definitely. Get the truth out there to people you care about. Because when she’s done with the”truth” you won’t know what happened. You signed up to get married not become a priest or a monk. Good for you in correcting this before any more time is wasted. Living with them first is Paramount to finding out who they Really are. I made the same mistake. Only my mistake was 27 years old. Best of luck to you. May you find happiness.

lyftdrivers,ff9fcwj,t1_ff97og4,1579711818.0,If I was going to use an emoji it would be the one crying or maybe mad and red. Lyft was doing bonus dollars for early morning and after 5:00pm. It was 15 for 3 rides morning and 25 for 5 rides afternoon. I got up to try a different schedule and take advantage of their offers. I guess you figured by now they stopped doing them.

askcarsales,ff83l66,t1_ff7vxnb,1579665072.0,This is the correct path. Get your own financing. Setup your own mechanic inspection. Get a Honda that you like or something like a Camry. Try to avoid all vehicles that have been in accidents. Just focus on looking. Be patient. There are thousands of good vehicles out there.

Insurance,fejkrgy,t3_ephfwb,1579178203.0,If you were rear ended by the other driver who was at fault are you sure you have no injuries? Did you seek medical treatment? All these issues are so much more complicated with all the no-fault states and various rules and regulations. As had been suggested ask for proof of this prior damages to your vehicle. I would want to know exactly how there are coming to their determinations. I wish you the best of luck. Get all the facts before you make a decision.

blackcats,fed7b0c,t3_eoeeci,1579002243.0,"My Kitty Lucy had a growth/tumor that the vet found in her intestine but said he couldn’t do anything about it. It went on for a year and I gave her lots of love and the best food. One day this past Sept22,2019 she fell over and passed. I was so shocked I still haven’t gotten over it. I only had her for 4 years. My ex wife abandoned the two of us. So I felt like she was my child. She was 7 years old. It broke my heart. I’m so sorry you had to experience this. Losing a fur baby can be so hard💔🐾 I hope they’re playing together in Heaven."
Insurance,fed6tfx,t3_eoflx9,1579001636.0,You should speak to your insurance agent/claims adjuster before speaking to the other insurance company. They will probably want to record your statement and possibly poke holes in it. Be sure you have no lasting injuries. Once you close this up that will be it and you can’t change you mind. You should speak to a lawyer to be sure. In some states this is part of the deal. It sounds like you’re concerned about your vehicle mostly. If it can be repaired go forward. They can do wonderful things in auto body collision these days. If not then they will have to pay a reasonable payout for a replacement in similar condition to your vehicle before it was damaged. Best of luck
Insurance,fed621e,t3_eofqmy,1579000643.0,"If you talked to him at the scene, I would try to work it out with him. He’s already telling you that he doesn’t want to repair it. Offer him cash to get rid of him quickly. Just confirm that he doesn’t want to really fix it  and try to agree on a cash price. If you go this route make sure you get a receipt from him at payment that it concludes all claims and all debt/damage will be settled on the amount you both agree to. Not a lawyer here so be careful. If you bumped him you’re in the wrong. Proceed with caution. Some states are different than others with regard to no-fault. One last thing. Was a police report obtained? Just curious about traffic violations."

Lyft,fe20d91,t3_enmqnq,1578833104.0,Good job! That was really great for that amount of time. Before the holidays it was easier to make those kind of dollars. But sadly it’s fallen so far off I’m totally sad about it. I hear that a lot of people are struggling right now. I just don’t know how to overcome it. Take care.

Lyft,fdt82nx,t3_en1y8k,1578713144.0,It feels like he was trying to manipulate you and get the most out of his ride with paying the least. The only thing I would have done is to ask for cash up front to pay for you heading back empty and paying for gas both ways. Since you drove all those hours try to think of yourself and your health. Let alone the vehicle. I would think $10-20 extra is what I would asked for. Especially since he was having a bit of a time finding someone.

MechanicAdvice,fdq9t5a,t1_fdq8rk8,1578660524.0,The converter should slide into the trans once and then again if I remember correctly. Take the trans down away from the block. Engage the converter correctly. There’s a possibility that it’s not even engaged at all. It’s worth a shot. Reinstall again. It might work. Many variables though.

uber,fddfedy,t3_eksi91,1578309803.0,Nah. No problem. Just tell the driver that you’re listening to your headphones(hard to realize sometimes). Total concentration on the road is a good thing for everybody. Sometimes people get in and are talking on the phone. I usual just say pardon me if I don’t catch on immediately. It’s all good. It a job not a social gathering☺️
medicalmarijuana,fdcgbls,t1_fdbry4b,1578274199.0,I have read a lot of these. This is supposed to be a order taker situation. These doctors are signed up to collect money. It’s just that simple. If you paid him I would raise heck. Would he like his name all over the place telling other people that they are jerks just looking for an excuse not to do what you paying them for. Between the initial approval appt and the state card money it is crazy expensive.

Lyft,fdc9jn6,t3_ekl7zp,1578269785.0,Happens all the time. The biggest I notice is females ordering rides for guys. I always ask “what’s the name” if they don’t know it’s no go.
Lyft,fdbxjo5,t1_fd6vqgr,1578263507.0,That’s it. The entitlement. These people have never had to hail a cab or deal with it. The cabs around my way are in terrible shape and the drivers are worn out. They just take out their phone and order their car to fly right up to them.
Lyft,fdbwqbm,t1_fd6jvce,1578263062.0,1.5 hours?! I would need gas money for that up front. If not I would have to cancel. I’ve done the +45 minutes to nowhere. I usually have to drive back empty. Can’t afford to do these.

blackcats,fd785e8,t1_fd6tr8d,1578200685.0,I like your username. I can hear the song in my head now. I lost my fur baby Lucy after only 4 years living with me. She was only 7-8 years old. She passed right in front of me. She just fell over and went to Heaven. I imagine she’s playing with all the other Kitties with St Francis watching over her. It might be silly but I pray for her every morning when I say the Rosary. Miss her terribly.
