radiohead,ffj83v4,t3_etwlak,1579992728.0,I’m trying to think of what random anecdote Tahani would say about Thom Yorke.
1200isplenty,ffj789d,t1_ffj687e,1579992133.0,"Well, it should. Quite often people who are very overweight or obese will lose weight quickly in the beginning, but that’s not true for everyone. If your calories are accurate, I think you have lost weight already. It’s just hard to see when it’s less than 10lbs at that weight. Your sister may have noticed a subtle difference. When you go down another 10lbs, it’ll be noticeable to you in the mirror. 

And your scale is probably not inaccurate. It’s very normal to have weight fluctuations +/- 5lbs depending on what you ate the previous night. Hormones also affect water weight and weight retention a lot, so it’ll go up again near your period and back down once it’s done. And you’re a teen, so your hormones are all out of whack all the time. Don’t worry too much about the day to day fluctuations. You should be trending downwards. 

I also heard that exercise after a long period being of sedentary will cause water retention for a few weeks, so maybe that’s why you haven’t lost as much you should yet. Just be patient."
1200isplenty,ffj5wgc,t3_etxb4z,1579991196.0,"I don’t see how it shouldn’t. If you’re not losing, you may need to monitor your calorie intake more closely."

fatlogic,ffg2iat,t3_etbmyx,1579897048.0,"I’ve lost maybe one pound since late november and I’m mad about it. I haven’t changed anything in my diet. If anything I’m being more cautious than ever. But I’m getting a food scale to put the doubts to rest. I’m also having bloating issues and some trouble with BM. Could be medication related, so I need to check on that before I go to the doctor. Anyway, it’s frustrating and it sucks that I haven’t gotten to my next goal weight yet."
FanFiction,ffg0bqg,t3_ete1lx,1579895703.0,"I have a lot of problematic kinks, but I don’t really touch extreme underage (shota) at all. Really graphic torture is not my thing either. I like gore! but it has to “sexy” gore that I think is tasteful. Certain types of torture or injury are too much for me. 

Also mpreg, inflation, vore that’s not actual cannibalism, but those are more strange than disturbing. Incest by itself, imo, that isn’t also noncon or with a generational gap doesn’t deserve to hang with the likes of noncon, gore, or underage. It’s just not on the same level. 

Otherwise there’s not much I find off limits. Wait, I should clarify that I mostly tend to stick with smutty “dead dove: do not eat” style fanfic. If a fanfic is gonna treat them seriously, then I tend to back off cause I’m stupidly empathetic."
FanFiction,ffeq5y2,t3_et6le8,1579859953.0,"I say, if it gives you pleasure and accomplishes your desire to fill that niche, why not go for it? 

I’ve written (or am currently writing) several fics for small/dead fandoms. If something is not there that I am capable of writing, I can will into existence and that in itself is satisfying. 

I’m not a longfic writer, so there isn’t gonna be too much time spent on it either. For a longfic, which in my case would be over 15,000 words, then I would hesitate because of the total lack of feedback in a long, chaptered fic. But who knows, if I get *really* inspired and motivated, maybe I’ll do it anyway. But I can hardly  even write longfic for big fandoms, so that’s all hypothetical."

anime,ffdvva1,t1_ffby15v,1579830214.0,"I agree, episodes 1 and 2 were the only good parts of the show. I didn’t know this show was an adaption, and just assumed it would be a gritty detective thriller a la LA Confidential. it was exciting to me bc shows in that genre are extremely rare in anime. 

at least it made me laugh sometimes, unintentionally."
anime,ffdvlt3,t1_ffdllvr,1579830026.0,"yes, I get that impression too. sadly, the conversations on good and evil are just as shallow and clumsy as the ones about suicide. zen and the politicians can’t seem to think of very obvious, logical answers to that question. 

I had no idea what the “whore of babylon” was until this show. I looked it up and it really feels like magase was just that basic concept transplanted into this show but like, with no elaboration on her motives and her as a person. at least not since that flashback episode where her uncle (?) talks about her as a teenager. 

speaking of, that whole thing made me super uncomfortable. saying that as a teen she was seductive, and that guys around her was saying she “raped” them with her mind. shinobu (handsome pony tail friend who shoots himself) said it too. this anime goes hard on depicting almost all women in the madonna/whore dichotomy."
FanFiction,ffdm5pv,t3_et15pu,1579823822.0,"I enjoy reading for big fandoms and having a plethora of fics to read, but finding good fics for obscure fandoms gives me a huge thrill. 

I also mostly only feel like writing for smaller fandoms or for things that don’t have any fanfic at all. With big fandoms it’s so much more likely that someone more talented than me has already written something I want better than I ever could."
anime,ffbowm6,t1_ffbon0r,1579776358.0,"yeah euthanasia is one aspect of suicide that is actually *heavily* debated in the real world, and they somehow miss that too. congrats, babylon, you’ve basically said fuck all about suicide."
anime,ffbohd7,t1_ffbo5u0,1579775729.0,"they compared suicide (or rather, the choice to commit suicide) to homosexuality *twice*, but they couldn’t bring up the fact that people kill themselves because of depression or ptsd? 

like okay, fine, they wanna brush aside mental illness which is still a bit taboo in japan, but then they don’t even bring up *economic* reasons why people commit suicide, or people in really horrible, desperate situations like war or famine (which is basically what you mentioned). 

then they try to talk about good and evil all of a sudden? what does that have to do with suicide? I mean it’s been brought up in previous episodes, but I just don’t get how it relates to suicide specifically. it feels shoehorned in."
anime,ffbnoib,t1_ff5qshu,1579774525.0,"babylon has been prattling about suicide for 11 episodes, and I don’t recall mental illness being discussed even once. hell, I’m not sure it was even mentioned at all."
anime,ffbn2tg,t1_ff3gkvl,1579773601.0,"Babylon is baffling to me. This anime postures itself as a mature seinen show but it has a supernatural femme fatale with weird seduction magic powers who manipulates people to commit suicide? Then it tries to have deep conversations on the topics of suicide and good and evil but never goes beyond the very basics? Some of the arguments brought up are so harebrained I burst into laughter several times. 

Such a pity. Babylon started off very interesting and then went downhill as soon as Ai Magase was introduced. 

And jfc that screencap of the president reminded me of this [dril tweet](https://twitter.com/dril/status/473265809079693312?s=21). I just can’t with this show."

Then with Ok Computer, even for those who don’t emotionally connect, is a very palatable rock album with some cool, experimental stuff in that keep people interested. The rest of Radiohead’s discography works best when feeling the emotional impact of it. That’s why Radiohead draws in a lot of people with mental illness."

It’s an 80s throwback track, so prime material for a retro video with lots of cool references and an 80s vaporware aesthetic. It’s also a very velvet sounding track while still being fairly upbeat and very catchy a la Bad Boy, but imo musically it’s actually a little more interesting. I don’t think it should replace Peek-a-boo or Bad Boy, I wish it came out alongside them. 


**Don’t Know What to Do Without You** by Blackpink instead of Kill This Love. The choreo is one of Blackpink’s best. I like that Rose is leading the song, and Lisa actually sings in this one!! She doesn’t just rap, she gets to show off her vocals. It’s also a comprehensive sounding track and not a mishmash of different songs like KTL that sounds incomplete."

People who truly have 0 claustrophobia are unusual. I can perhaps handle crawling on hands and knees for short distances, but slowly shimmying on my belly? Fuck no. Anything can go wrong, and if you go alone, you are truly alone in the pitch black darkness with only your thoughts.

Lol I don’t even want to step into a big cave. Caves in general are a big no-no for me. 

The autheniticity of the story is very high and that’s what makes it good in this internet blog style of writing. The pictures are real so obviously the author did do real caving expeditions to get those pics. Like jesus, I would have a panic attack in there.

fatlogic,fdjlocd,t1_fdjli9e,1578476849.0,"No, I’m saying she’s a lying liar who lies (or is seriously deluding herself) because you straight up can’t gain weight on 1200 when you have to be extremely short for it just to be maintenance calories."
intermittentfasting,fdjjksq,t3_elnxf4,1578473821.0,I have. But getting the last few pounds off is getting incredibly hard and I may have to start exercising on my part.
fatlogic,fdi9tdi,t3_elj0ps,1578438323.0,You probably have to be 4 1/2 feet for 1200 to even be *maintenance*.
