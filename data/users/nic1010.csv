The whole point of The video is basically him saying he's finally done it. He's financially stable, his company could continue on without him even if he were gone and he no longer is required to put in so much time to keep things going. He's basically just admitted this to us now that LTT passed 10 mil subs. If anything gonna change it would probably be him stepping back from so many projects to focus on one's that interest him personally."

• Space

to replace a clutch on their own...? You're nuts if you think that. Guaranteed maybe 1% of all owners of manual vehicles have the above list, and even then of that 1% a fair portion won't even care to do it, they'd just fork out the money. 

It's not the only option, obviously. However it's the ONLY option a majority of manual drivers have, and it happens to cost around $1000 depending on the car and mechanics shop you take it to."

The Asian guy that was helping me told me to look for his East Indian coworker, he obviously gave his coworkers name as well, but race is a good descriptor when some other obvious descriptor isn't available. I really don't think most people have a problem with this."

cringe,ff436f9,t1_ff42a9j,1579554536.0,"Yea.... I could replace my clutch if I had a need to, that doesn't mean everyone can replace a clutch...? I don't understand the point you are making here. Average cost to replace a clutch is quite typically $1000 (CAD) if you do it through a repair shop. 

And what I mean is on some cars you have to fully remove it from under the vehicle, on others you can disconnect and move it out of the way."
cringe,ff41ohd,t1_ff4195t,1579553609.0,Except that with a lot of cars you have to drop the transmission in order to get at the clutch. With some cars its even worse where you need to slightly raise the engine in order to get at the transmission. Not really sure why you never considered maybe the $1000 cost estimate included cost to repair.

civic,fem878a,t1_fem7kkg,1579243285.0,"I'd still be careful doing above 350whp for a daily thought. 390 if it's being tracked mainly seems fine, 450whp+ I guess might be possible, but at that point it seems more like you're winning the lottery every time you take it out and something doesn't break on you. Eventually at that point something's gonna go and hopefully you won't need a new engine. If you're pushing 450+ may as well go a little further with proper block upgrades."
civic,fem72av,t1_fem6qyb,1579242074.0,Yea even a comfy 350whp build with some nice driver focused mods would make this an awesome daily. I also don't think the k24s in FG4s are meant to go much above 400hp without reinforcing the bottom end from what I remember reading. Would also want to look into transmission and what not. If you're dailying it probably safe not pushing near 400whp
civic,fem6bka,t1_fem64u6,1579241297.0,"Main problem is not having the performance mods to back up the need for such a spoiler, to be fair I dont know your build under the hood that is. Once you get that sucker turbo'd it would make a little more sense, maybe breaking 270whp+"

Paladins,fdkqxfe,t1_fdkq36z,1578509296.0,"> its a free game lol shut up 

Sounds a little childish to me. I do agree, the original comment is kinda stupid, but its not to far from the truth. Consistently each update after release has been broken to the point that the game is unplayable. The new VGS system is honestly doesnt simplify anything, it just forces everyone that knew the old system to relearn a new one. It added nothing to the game. 

People honestly have every right to be upset time after time an update goes live and the game just falls apart. People spend money on this game, they should respect their players by actually giving beneficial updates that dont break the game. This isnt anything uncommon for free games.... Being toxic kinda sucks I guess, but it doesnt negate the point that was being made."
Paladins,fdkpqgr,t1_fdkooe4,1578508588.0,I still fail to see how this is an argument. There are so many F2P games out there that aren't buggy beyond belief every time an update goes out. I'd guess it's more so an issue of how hacked together the game is at this point.
