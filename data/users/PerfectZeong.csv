PoliticalDiscussion,ffclgnw,t1_ffcj1w0,1579801976.0,"Of course they care about Republicans,  they can't pass legislation without them so as long as they exist and you dont have 60 votes in the Senate you have to care about them or nothing gets done ever. Obamacare was an end run around them and took literally everything to get just to that point and could go no further and obama still got trounced in 2010. What's that look like if he failed entirely? 

Activating new voters means people who have never voted are registering to vote for Bernie in large numbers and we have no real data to show that's happening. Of course if he starts blowing up primaries and crushing in landslides then I'm wrong bit I have no reason as of now to think thats the case.

It is the unfortunate reality that the progressive agenda often will get thrown under the bus to please the moderates.  That's the sad part of politics, the moderate leads the discussion because they're the one that can go either way. Being mad about it won't change the hand you're dealt.

Dude, pelosi and obama both wanted public option healthcare. That was absolutely the plan they put together and it was changed after realizing there was not the votes needed to pass it and it would die. The reason we dont have a public option in America is because of Republicans, nobody else.

What are you even talking about, they were fighting socialized medicine and they were largely rewarded for neutering obamacare and standing against it with massive gains in 2010. You can't shame them on it because their electorate wanted them to try and kill it. The fact that it's survived almost a decade by this point with a republican party that had house Senate and president is frankly a miracle.

You can fight against bad things and you can be optimistic and have ideas and try to make them work but reality is reality no matter what you want it to be and eventually you have to deal with it if you want anything to be done for anyone. Obama made the tough call to get what he could get rather than leave 10s of millions of people hanging and I respect the shit out of him for managing what he did.

People seem to have this idea that there is a massive untapped progressive voting bloc in this country that so far has not come to exist. I'm not saying don't fight for it but reality has so far not lined up with that. Bernie may excite left wingers and thats great but they vote anyway and he doesn't seem to be activating new voters. Maybe he will, I hope he does but let's hope we see it soon.

So would you have been ok with no Obamacare at all? Honest question because I know people who got or saved health insurance because of it. It's not perfect but it was better than nothing. That's what bothers me about all of this, people attack democrats rather than the people who are actually standing in the way of the things they want and I'm not even the worlds biggest Obama fan. If obama had 65 reliable blue senators we would have socialized medicine, no doubt in my mind. Bernie isn't magic, he has to deal with the same reality we all do eventually and its easier to be the outsider yelling than it is to actually do what you're yelling about, look at trump."

It was either no single payer or nothing. The fact that Obamacare got done in any form is frankly an incredible accomplishment. Blame Lieberman or Republicans but you can't blame Obama for looking at reality and deciding something that gets millions of people insurance that they didn't have is better than nothing. In a world where he could have had anything a public option was the plan but with what he had this is the best that he could do.

We got a lot of bailout money back, and if we hadn't bailed out the banks it would have meant absolute chaos for consumers and homeowners, far worse than we had. I'm not a fan of letting people off Scot free but a bailout needed to happen to keep the economy functioning.

Renewables are a good thing and Obama did help invest and provide a lot of incentives to push for them but the kind of jobs that are created by the industry are not the same jobs that the uneducated blue collar workers want. They don't want to retrain in mid life to make 15 an hour so trump's message of coal is coming back is good to them.

America is a nation where enough people thought obama was too leftist so they voted for trump. What do you think they're going to feel about Bernie? Even if he wins the primary season he won't have the kind of crushing mandate he would need to force legislation through so he either has to compromise like obama or accomplish nothing.

Doing a big screen level presentation on a small screen budget was Lucas' stated goal for getting into TV and probably a reason why they started the clone wars tv show as a movie then used the techniques they learned there to make a show version.

Until very very recently TV shows were relatively low budget experiences with the highest cost being the actors if it's successful. Doing something on the level of star wars on TV was considered too expensive and there's still a large divide between an expensive season of TV and an expensive movie production. Lucas wanted to pioneer tech to get a TV show that looked closer to the movie level on a TV budget.

He's not activating new voters and he's not overwhelmingly winning in the polls so where is this massive movement that allows him to pass legislation going to come from? Honest question if republicans can proceed to safely ignore him how does he enact anything? If progressives can't win purple states then honestly what are they going to get by having 48 seats in the senate at most?

If bernie wins and doesn't accomplish anything for four years is that his fault?

So that's your plan, eventually some progressive movement will come around even if it's way too late to do anything it was worth sabotaging what did exist?

At the same time I feel like the marvel universe is starting to sundown and I'm not necessarily looking to invest myself in a 22 movie pay off, I like more stories to stand on their own. Marvel did do a great job of making sure their movies felt satisfying but there are many that were just meh and after avengers 1 obviously it was all building to infinity war"
television,ff98eao,t1_ff97piv,1579707222.0,"See I don't know about that because the show was always set up as the will Smith tv show based on an exaggerated version of his life. It was always set up to be his show and as he matured as an actor it certainly became easier to give him more time.  I understand being frustrated about seeing your time and lines reduced but at the same time the show was his vehicle and created for him. No will Smith no show. He's the fresh prince. It's not like family matters where a throwaway character ended up taking over the show and completely changing what it was about.

But early on the show had more scripts that featured viv and as the seasons went on it became more focused on Will, carlton and uncle phil."
politics,ff95r7w,t1_ff931wg,1579705491.0,Well that's certainly not dissuading people from thinking it's a cult.
television,ff90x2z,t1_ff7pm3w,1579702050.0,Comedies are hard to hit on the first episode but I think it has a lot of potential now that the central crux has been established. First ep of veep is rough at times too.
television,ff903p1,t3_esa8yw,1579701407.0,"I dont think she ever got over the fact that it wasnt her show, it was the will smith show and she was a character on it. Early on will barely knew how to act and the rest of the cast was featured more prominently in part due to his own weaknesses as an actor needing to be covered up but it was always his show and she resented it because he wasnt an actor and she was. But it's HIS show."
television,ff8zcxq,t1_ff8ptj6,1579700819.0,Yeah I kind of like it really. Rather than aping marvels success they're just having success with strong stand alone films.
Documentaries,ff8ujqx,t1_ff8dor8,1579696574.0,Because people look at corruption differently when it's from people who have literally nothing.
quityourbullshit,ff7rnyr,t1_ff76cba,1579656708.0,I dont think most high functioning autists would appreciate being called mentally ill honestly.
SquaredCircle,ff7n4hx,t1_ff6imxe,1579653518.0,I like the brand wars. It's something we havent seen in a while and god damn I miss it when people gave a shit about wrestling and it was hot. Anything that transports us back towards that I'm in for.
atheism,ff7eeq5,t1_ff7djpk,1579647633.0,God helps those that help themselves to superbowls.
