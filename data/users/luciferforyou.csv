But yeah, fair."

YouShouldKnow,fg1nwtg,t3_ewcyzm,1580430527.0,"Definitely a side note but I heard Sam Harris describe that internal dialogue as follows and thought he perfectly nailed it:

""..you will meet your mind, and your mind is the most rambling, chaotic, needling, insulting, insufferable person you will ever meet.  It's like having some maniac walk through the front door of your house and follow you from room to room and refuse to stop talking.  And this happens every day of your life"""

unpopularopinion,fg1i0u2,t3_ew99nd,1580427469.0,"Well hi their fellow atheist.

""In general, poorer countries are more religious than richer countries because it gives people hope and something to look forward to, regardless of your situation""

\-that seems an awful lot like a guess thrown out as truth, and dismisses the education factor among others.

"" Moreover, in general I think it's a good idea that people have a set of ""rules"" or morals to be guided by ""

\-in general?  shouldn't what those morals are, matter?  For example, should punishment for theft be the removal of ones hand?  Because that is actually one of the ""morals to be guided by"".

"" I can't imagine the world being any better without religion ""

\-You haven't lived in Utah (just kidding).  I can definitely imagine the middle east getting MUCH better without religion.  In fact the entire Israel-Palestine conflict would not be a thing as Israelites wouldn't be parking their asses in Palestinian territories because there would be no reason to.

For an atheist, you seem to be a bit oblivious to some of the issues of religion.  Such as the propagation of mis-truth which I see as the biggest one.  It also normalizes irrational and uncritical thinking.  If someone learns and believes that two of every animal really got on a boat, then god drowned the entire fucking world, they're more likely to believe other stupid bullshit.. flat-earthers ,anti-vaxxers and pizza-gate."
realestateinvesting,ffsd3e0,t3_euybh6,1580178823.0,"This instantly made me think of a customer being upset with the car salesman when the new car they purchased gets under the listed miles per gallon.
Buyer is reasonably upset. But those are the dynamics. Buyer learns his lesson and wants to help others learn from his/her mistake.
Makes sense and a good reminder that agents are salespeople."

realestateinvesting,ffh6b1a,t3_erijdk,1579924307.0,"Question regarding the 1% rule.  Just to make sure I have the idea down, you're supposed to cash flow 1% of the total purchase price of the property a month?  If yes, isn't this a 12% cap rate?  Renting a place for 2k a month that you spent 200k on seems pretty difficult if I'm understanding correctly and the real estate investment company I work for is usually around a 7% cap rate."

Unexpected,fdrid4x,t3_emr1f6,1578684966.0,"So something like this actually happened to me in Los Angelos.  Maybe 12 years ago (before weed was legalized) I had one last J to smoke before getting on a plane to come back home.  I was walking around Venice Beach looking for a secluded place to smoke and just lit up when I couldn't find one.  Cops drive by, stopped, reverse back to me.  I toss the J on the ground as soon as they had driven by.  They gave me a ticket for littering which I thought was super cool of them.. turns out it was an $800 ticket.  I decided to not pay and just not go back to CA.  Found out it would follow me to my state so I had to pay.. went to pay and it had gone up to $1600."
realestateinvesting,fdorrex,t1_fdoqmbv,1578611428.0,Tenant takes care of it.  My brother still tries to meet the new people when he visits every couple months though.
realestateinvesting,fdop4m6,t3_emg8s9,1578609743.0,"Not sure if this is helpful, but my brother has a 6-bed house in provo that has one renter who sublets the place out.  It results in the renter paying cheap (out the door) rent and my brother only really needing to deal with one primary tenant who basically serves as a limited property manager.  Obviously that scenario can come with it's own risks and my brother has the advantage of being close to BYU, but it's worked well for him."
personalfinance,fdlflmb,t3_elshda,1578522965.0,yes; I've made a good amount of using credit cards in the last two years as I've had high expenses and done a lot of credit cards that have cash back as a standard as well as a sign up bonus ranging from $150 - 500.  I haven't paid any interest on credit cards for over a decade.  It's just about understanding them and managing them.  If you can't manage money you probably don't want to start using CCs.
