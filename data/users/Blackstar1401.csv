pittsburgh,ffe9vna,t3_et5b2c,1579840735.0,"I highly recommend a gateway clipper boat tour. It’s informational and beautiful. 

This link is good to get info about events and places. https://downtownpittsburgh.com/events/"
StartledCats,ffe79h2,t1_ffe6p0m,1579838589.0,"It disappeared after a while. I have 5 cats and we keep them in the basement. I would give it a few weeks and if it still bothers you then you can return it within the return policy.

Edit to add that that went away but because our cats use it so much they smell like poop if we don’t change the bag. Keep in mind I have 5 cats and two of them. I think when we add a third that will help."
cats,ffdr0sa,t1_ffdqp88,1579826835.0,There are two of them they are 6 months old and newly adopted.  I fostered them since they were 2 weeks old. It can be either of two. Here is a link to the chaos twins. https://imgur.com/gallery/OK0OLH0

AmItheAsshole,ffdb1db,t3_et075z,1579817006.0,NTA it’s not her day. What is it with people taking over weddings?  Just be ready that she may show up anyway. My mother took over my wedding and made me with I had eloped.
AskMen,ffd8n2t,t3_esruuu,1579815568.0,I wear mine all the time except when handling food or taking a shower. My ring is on the loose side and There is no catch in the bathroom so I don’t want it to accidentally slide off in the shower.
AmItheAsshole,ffbsi6t,t1_ffbsd22,1579781083.0,Still you may want to report the dog. If you report it then the owner may be fined and then start to restrain their dog. Don’t let your dog be a statistic of being killed by another dog. Be safe dogs can be dangerous when they have bad owner. I say this absolutely loving dogs.
cats,ffbscka,t3_ess2lb,1579780900.0,Aww. Your poor wife. I hope she was able to park somewhere else.
AmItheAsshole,ffbsaho,t3_ess2s9,1579780834.0,NTA but could it be a stray?   Are you able to call animal control?
AmItheAsshole,ff8yo67,t1_ff8yaka,1579700264.0,"I agree YTA. That is what I got out of this. Like he is just waiting for the divorce. My MIL has my wedding pic up and the wedding pics of my SIL and BIL. It’s common to have wedding pictures up. I agree with the wife that he cares more what his sister thinks than his wife. He also said not to share anything personal with his wife. It made me think why did this guy even get married. Marriage is a partnership. I hope they get couples counseling soon if they want to make it the long haul.

Edit fixed an autocorrect."
CleaningTips,ff3093j,t3_erdnpr,1579530174.0,I would try a fresh paint on the walls. If that doesn’t work she may have peed onto the carpet. You may need to replace the carpet.
netflix,ff2zxkw,t3_erdqfb,1579529909.0,Not really for young demographic but it has crude humor and is a good story is Grace and Frankie.
ttcafterloss,ff230ov,t3_er7jcn,1579492425.0,I’m in the same boat. I had a CP and a M@C right in a row. We are TTC again and I’m on my 3rd cycle past M@C and no baby. It feels frustrating. I was in Vegas for my birthday And I didn’t drink on the off chance I was pregnant. I just want my pretty blue eyed baby (my husband and I both have light blue eyes so it’s a 99.9 chance our baby will have blue eyes). It’s frustrating because you want to be healthy and ready.
AmItheAsshole,feowrwd,t3_eq8r3x,1579307078.0,"NTA sounds like more is going on and you feel like he doesn’t appreciate you. Consider the following article. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.huffpost.com/entry/she-divorced-me-i-left-dishes-by-the-sink_b_9055288/amp

It talks about how different things are important to partners. And you feel like he doesn’t appreciate you because he asks your opinion to get something you would like and then blatantly ignores it. You may want to consider couples counseling before you get married. These issues will only get worse."
AmItheAsshole,feogtz0,t3_eq7iu5,1579299964.0,YTA it could have been an honest mistake and you treated her like she was purposely out to get you.
pittsburgh,fem1hvr,t3_epvjgr,1579236705.0,I’ll take him. Lol. Seriously though I hope you find his owner he looks adorable. Did you check for a microchip?  If you take him to HAR they can scan him. Or even your local vet.
AmItheAsshole,fem17y6,t3_epvk0z,1579236461.0,Soft YTA. You are young and sound like you were trying to do the right thing. In the future never give out their info. What you can do is offer to take their information and pass it to the person they want to reach. In your case take your brother’s dad’s information to give to your brother that way your brother could choose what to do with it. This also goes for future jobs.
cats,feky8rr,t3_eppqxe,1579210083.0,Look up Jackson Galaxy YouTube video on cat introductions. It’s the best I have scene.  Give them a few good months. I just got two kittens and one of my cats is still grumpy about it 3 months in. My other two adjusted much better (yes I have 5 cats now and this is my limit).
AmItheAsshole,feio3qj,t3_epcvkc,1579143062.0,NAH  They we’re doing their normal activities while watching her. You are correct that your wishes should also be respected. Maybe new rules need to be put in place and if they have events planned then they don’t babysit and you get a different babysitter.
AmItheAsshole,fehzghq,t1_fehv1fg,1579127001.0,It sounds like he has double standards. I’m not going to vote but you may want to look at cross posting to r/relationshipadvice. I think you need to do some soul searching on if this is something you can deal with long term. Him being able to say no whenever and taking you through the coals when you say no is a double standard that I know I couldn’t live with.
AmItheAsshole,fehtvx7,t1_fehp0xw,1579123773.0,"Why are you with him? A partner is supposed to support you and it sounds like he is tearing you down. What are you getting out of this relationship?  It obviously is not support for you issue, which I suspect PTSD or emotional support, or economical (almost the exact opposite). Is the physical support enough to justify being torn down emotionally and possibly jeopardize a promotion and your financial future?"
hellofresh,fee140y,t1_f3z7huk,1579024201.0,I bought a big bottle on Amazon for $6. It will last a long time so I was ok with the price.
AmItheAsshole,fedfuh3,t3_eoley4,1579010382.0,Lol you had me until you said wish. YTA.  Just go on YouTube and see the comparison videos of people ordering a dress and what they got. Most of the dresses received off wish look like a cheap Halloween costume. Tbh I didn’t want to spend a lot on my dress and ended up spending 750 and found a cheap alteration place for $50. Veils are rough. I actually bought two. One was on amazon and it looked cheap when I got it. Lucky me that amazon has returns. I ended up getting this gorgeous lace veil from eBay for $40 and had a backup veil I was going to buy. The veil I got on eBay was the wrong color and I needed a tea bath to tint it to match my cream dress. The dresses and wedding stuff online is deceptive. I got flower girl dresses from JJ house and they took forever to come and they had to be massively altered when they got here.
TrueOffMyChest,feb23d7,t3_eobffj,1578954743.0,Good for you!  I hope the best for you in the future.
AmItheAsshole,fe0oo2a,t3_enkx94,1578816782.0,NTA. They should be compensating you. It is very kind of you to help out how you have so far.

raisedbynarcissists,fdp9zr8,t1_fdp3zij,1578623467.0,Don’t pay her anything. If she is not a valid employee.
raisedbynarcissists,fdox21e,t1_fdoqavj,1578614836.0,That is ridiculous. Is she going to actually be working for you or is she expecting you to start a business and just give her all your profit?
raisedbynarcissists,fdopjw1,t3_emhetw,1578610000.0,My mom pulls the same stunts. She eventually went too far and I just say no  I’m Vlc and would be nc if it wasn’t for my grandma. I’m confused do you own a business?
cats,fdnomvj,t3_emcmpr,1578590026.0,Play with him more or get a second kitten and they will wear themselves out together. Kittens are notorious for having pica and eating what they shouldn’t.
AmItheAsshole,fdmsiq3,t3_em7f43,1578563618.0,NAH but as woman that is creepy.  You may not know how creepy. You may want to read this article it explains in a way I can never articulate how creepy that is. https://www.google.com/amp/s/kateharding.net/2009/10/08/guest-blogger-starling-schrodinger%25E2%2580%2599s-rapist-or-a-guy%25E2%2580%2599s-guide-to-approaching-strange-women-without-being-maced/amp/

AmItheAsshole,fdkkkmp,t3_elvwf7,1578505527.0,"NTA but are you sure she is able to bath ok on her own?  My grandma went though a faze where it was a hassle to get in and out of the tub that she bathed once every two to three weeks and insisted she was fine. When we remodeled her living area we put in a shower and designed it for her with an extra big seat and long shower handle and extension that made it easier. She now baths ever day or at least every other day. Check with your patient and ask if there is anything that would make bathing easier.

AmItheAsshole,fddiktn,t1_fddeyko,1578313735.0,Also consider freezing your credit with all the credit agencies because she may do it again in the future.

ZeroWaste,fcut3eg,t1_fcusz6r,1577987962.0,I was thinking of making net bags. I was wondering because the cashier could see the produce inside the bags.
ZeroWaste,fcurtgb,t3_eiykh6,1577987203.0,This is my next craft project. Have you received any push back from the store on using them?
