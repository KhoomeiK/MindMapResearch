running,ffjcmk3,t3_etyhjx,1579995471.0,"All distances you add, should be slow miles. When you can run them and still feel fresh, add speed or more distance. you are ready to run a 10k when your steady weekly mileage is doble your target race. In your case, 20k+"
running,ffig3l9,t3_etpw9q,1579973042.0,Good for you! You overdo it when you feel it takes more from you than it gives in return. train slow and often until you reach 30km/week without feeling injured or fatigued. Then start structuring your week into long run (10k+) and a 3k tempo. (Heavy breath and 85% of Max HR) in addition to the easy runs. slowly add more easy runs as well once you feel comfortable. Add a rest day after your long run. Try upping every other long run to a 15k+. Now you are doing consistent injury free 45k+ weeks. Now you can sign up for a HM and enjoy the race from start to finish because you can run it properly all the way.

running,fffdl01,t1_fff9w06,1579881617.0,"I completely agree with the above, with low milage, you should not add tempo to your long runs. But I also believe you *should* run 40+ MPW to even consider running a marathon at pace, I don't understand how it is possible to complete it without bonking unless you have a solid base."

Look behind you before you spit or snot-rocket, also factor in the damn wind before you let lose.

Stay hydrated.

Do not let the weather dictate whether you run or not, pretty much every weather is runnable, Tornadoes, Hurricanes and Lightening storms are the only valid excuses to stay indoors."

running,ffcudn4,t1_ffcr2ry,1579807449.0,"Anaerobic running is still important to build muscle, stridelenght and vo2max. The important thing is to run based on how you feel before and during the run. Dont run intevalls or hill repeats or any other hard workout unless you feel rested and ready for it. Dont follow a plan to the letter if it wrecks you. Some weeks you can do multiple hard anaerobic workouts because you feel great, other weeks can be only easy runs because life can be hectic outside the running. Use books and training plans as guides and not as a recipie! Every body is different."

running,ffcs4hi,t3_esxbmn,1579806130.0,"In my experience you want atleast 2 of your last long runs (about 30k or 2.5-3h) with the last 10k at or above your marathon race pace. It really helps the endgame stamina, to push those last km, learn to run fast on tired legs. Also, your 5k pb suggests you just need consistent high mileage to run sub 3.20..  I am 3.15 ish on a 19.05 5k pb. My half is 1.28 though, i avg about 80km/week to break 3 this year. Also, your easy pace should be around 9 min flat. Check your pulse and adjust accordingly."

I come back from a run tired in the body, but alert and energized in the mind. It makes me a better dad and a better person in general. When it rains or snows, I feel like a badass batteling the elements, if the weather is nice, it just feels good. Time is relentless, progress and regress is so easially measurable, small wins every week on the path to a season goal.
