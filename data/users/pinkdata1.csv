BusinessIntelligence,fel53bl,t3_ep675r,1579214242.0,"Hello! One of the best strategies to increase the sales is to look at complementary products sold together. You can do this by using market basket analysis, which assesses the correlation between products sold together. This way you can create a typical purchase pattern of the customer and potentially increase and decrease pricing such that in the end the company still makes money based on the purchase of these multiple products. Or at least they are placed on the path of the customer to the cash register.

Another interesting thing is to look at the seasonality of the business and the purchasing patterns in different periods.

Additionally, you can also take a look at the number one products sold in each category. Make an experiment which product would sell better if this one is missing.

Lastly, I would also talk to the employees in the store and ask them about the potential problems there. Ask them about their opinion, what does not work in the store and incorporate this feedback into your analyses, since your strategies need to be in line with the reality in the store such that they can be applied.

If the boss sees that you have a 360 degree approach, he will promote you. In the end, he wants fresh ideas and new innovative ways of doing business. It is your time to shine, buddy!"
