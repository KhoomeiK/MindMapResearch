florrio,fgdj8lx,t1_fgbf8b4,1580683016.0,">The constant rotating makes you use **skill** to use certain petals

Yes, but too much skill.

I explained that newbies like me may have a very difficult time trying to hit even with a basic petal.

I don’t think it would break the concept of the game as a bunch of spinny flowers, but it would definitely change builds to have more variety. I don’t think it will cause some petals to be too easy to use, on paper it *should* allow for even more creative playstyles.

Using the rock shield example, a counter player could switch their petal arrangement for a “shield breaker layout” and focus the rocks down with fasts up front, and then use their stingers from the back. if the other player is good enough, they can spin to use other petals for defense. If the other player is better, they will find a way to break the other’s petals.

I’m curious for how you fight in this game, cause i always get “you’ll never catch me” or “both ded” or “i have no roses”"
