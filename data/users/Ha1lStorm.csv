NotHowDrugsWork,ffodr1n,t1_ffocvym,1580076650.0,"Like “wet” as in PCP. It’s the same consistency as lean and people dip cigarettes and blunts in it and smoke it. I could very well be the dummy here but my best guess is this is what he did, but didn’t fully understand what he was doing or had someone tell him “It’s like smoking lean man”. I’m making a lot of assumptions here but that’s the only way I can make any sense of it lol."

movies,fffsw6e,t3_etbvid,1579891080.0,I don’t know if it’s been mentioned here yet but there’s an older indie film starring Brie Larson called Short Term 12 that he’s also in and he plays the most captivating and moving role ever. His performance in that film is INCREDIBLE!
