GripTraining,ffdhezr,t3_ess55r,1579820922.0,"You just started? Congratulations and welcome to my biggest passion. A word of advice. Muscles develop fast. Tendons develop sloooooow. Two years. 

If you fall in love and pursue this (I hope you do) eventually you WILL develop a tendon issue. As you advance in the sport it is important to develop antagonist muscle groups to correct muscle imbalances. All the pulling needs to be countered by some pushing. This is why lots of climbers also do yoga. There is a ton of information out there.  I suggest you start doing some research on pre-hab now so you can get ahead of it. 

&#x200B;

With tendon issues the main thing is to STOP CLIMBING IMMEDIATELY. Even if you live at the mouth of Independence Pass in Aspen and don't want to waste the season. Just give it up. Ice and do mobility exercises on the area for the first 72 hours and continue for 4 to 6 weeks and get back into the sport SLLLOOOOWWWLLYY. I ultimately had to switch careers because of a climbing related injury that I ignored.

The stress tho. It's huge. Like financial sector stock market trader huge. One thing that I've found in common is that heavy drinking actually *improves* performance. So really really try to find another way to handle the stress, because I'm sure you know that's not healthy. 

Your exit strategy is sound. A lot more stability in hotels but I'm sure you can see, not much creativity. 

Good luck to you.

P.S. A couple books I'd recommend:

On Food and Cooking

This is a very thick book, after 15 years I still haven't read all of it. It discusses cooking on a molecular level with scientific and biology terminology. Not a relaxing read.


The Professional Chef Fifth edition.

The fifth edition and earlier is more thorough. It's the text book for Culinary Institute of America, same school Bourdain went to. Now more of the information is taught in class so there's less stuff in the books. But the newer ones are still pretty good"
casualiama,ffcgxlr,t3_esr8x0,1579799224.0,"What are your career goals? Are you cooking in Germany or abroad? Are you aware of the health impacts of a high stress career? Do you have any plans to manage that? 

I like to give young cooks a fair warning. In the states at least jobs are very low pay, rarely benefits and health insurance. Working nights weekends and holidays. For example I don't even care about Christmas now, it means nothing to me.

I had tendon issues so bad in my elbows I couldn't even open a heavy door without excruciating pain. It was caused by over use. 6 years later and it's not yet resolved. I had to work for a year with a hernia that had come all the way out into my scrotum while I worked 70 hours a week to pay for surgery.

I feel like I got ptsd from all the stress. 


Just a warning, this is not all glitz and glammer. Even when you get to the point of working for tv chefs and beautiful restaurants getting write ups in national magazines it's still mostly working a hot sweaty line that smells like hot garbage in the dish pit and a stressed out chef that yells at you. Eventually you get to be the one that does all the yelling. 

Just make sure you have an exit strategy in case you burn out and need to switch careers. The likelihood is very high.


Cooking professionally was one of the most fulfilling things I've ever done in my life, but also one of the most destructive. It's like a drug addiction. It's amazing and fun but so so bad for you. It's really hard to find a balance. And when you do it can be gone at the drop of a hat when the business goes under or changes ownership.

I hope you're ready for a wild ride."
casualiama,ffcf5qv,t1_ffcag62,1579798135.0,"Here's what's gonna happen when you make an account. First everyone will see the new guy and it will be like sharks with chum in the water. Expect some nasty messages like, ""hey can I come suck your cock rn?”, dick pics, asshole pics, guys in light bondage gear, stuff like that. But nothing super crazy. Just horny guys. After that dies down in a couple weeks you only get hit with a little of that when it shows you're available. 

But that's the worst of it. It is completely acceptable to just ignore those guys. They're being pigs and they know it.

Interspersed with that there will be plenty of very nice guys who will be respectful and go at your pace.

It's really nice the way they set up the profile info you can put that you don't accept NSFW pics or just not at first. People can put what std's they have, if they're on PrEP, if they're top or bottom or top verse or bottom verse and you can put what tribe your in. 

There's tons of guys there and you can see right away what everyone is into. It saves a lot of time. 


I think seeing it all out there like that might help your confidence a bit. One thing I wish I knew when I was younger is that there's nothing weird when it comes to sex.

You'll be back on drugs in no time. This is not a solid exit strategy. 

You have to find a hobby and a social structure that doesn't involve drugs. Something physical will give you a great endorphin boost. That's probably why you like working.

Climbing is pretty awesome, it's what I do, but the gym memberships are expensive as well as gear and trips. But it's not impossible to get into. Often you can go for free to try it out. Once you see if you like it then the motivation will really be there.

You're young so try out for some sports at school. Track season starts soon. All you need is a pair of running shoes and some shorts. I was never the fastest sprinter but did great in middle and longer distance races.

Learn an instrument, learn programming, chess club, drama class, just try everything. You can quit if you don't like it. Just keep trying things until you find something that holds your interest like drugs.

Find religion, but it's gotta be real, not faked. I like a mix of Buddhism and Hindu cos it's so beautiful and I don't care if it's real or not.

Find a hobby that you are passionate about. Something that holds your interest the same way drugs did. Something difficult works best for me. I really love rock climbing but the injuries sideline me a lot.

Cut ties with your drug using friends when you get out. Probably the hardest thing ever.

When you make new friends and they start to talk about drugs, give yourself a head start and tell them a little about your past and ask them to keep it away from you.


I'm not sure any of that advice would have helped me when I was your age. But I was definitely not ready to quit when I was your age."

The big message is that you CANNOT fix an addict. And they offer a lot of ways to care for yourself and protect yourself from their destructive behavior.

I smoked a lot of weed as a teenager. Started at your age. But I was a wrestler and didn't smoke much during season. I had a job during summertime so I had to be sober for that. I bought a guitar when I was 15 and immediately someone asked me to join their band. Stuck it out, got better, played some shows. We even borrowed a mixing board from a church and wiped a hard drive and downloaded pro tools and made an album. 

It wasn't much but all that stuff took effort and occupied my time in between the smoke sessions. So I wasn't just sitting around and getting blazed constantly. Also I developed a lot of problem solving skills. That's the biggest thing in life. You need to be able to over come obstacles and stay calm. Because life is one giant series of obstacles in the way of your goals. 

Weed can make you relaxed. But it can also make you complacent. And when you're used to that comfort bubble all the time and you get pushed out of it you will probably get more stressed than you would if you were used to dealing with stressful situations with a clear head.

If you fall in love and pursue this (I hope you do) eventually you WILL develop a tendon issue. As you advance in the sport it is important to develop antagonist muscle groups to correct muscle imbalances. All the pulling needs to be countered by some pushing. This is why lots of climbers also do yoga. There is a ton of information out there.  I suggest you start doing some research on pre-hab now so you can get ahead of it. 

&#x200B;

With tendon issues the main thing is to STOP CLIMBING IMMEDIATELY. Even if you live at the mouth of Independence Pass in Aspen and don't want to waste the season. Just give it up. Ice and do mobility exercises on the area for the first 72 hours and continue for 4 to 6 weeks and get back into the sport SLLLOOOOWWWLLYY.

Your exit strategy is sound. A lot more stability in hotels but I'm sure you can see, not much creativity. 

Good luck to you.

P.S. A couple books I'd recommend:

On Food and Cooking

This is a very thick book, after 15 years I still haven't read all of it. It discusses cooking on a molecular level with scientific and biology terminology. Not a relaxing read.


The Professional Chef Fifth edition.

The fifth edition and earlier is more thorough. It's the text book for Culinary Institute of America, same school Bourdain went to. Now more of the information is taught in class so there's less stuff in the books. But the newer ones are still pretty good"
casualiama,ffcgxlr,t3_esr8x0,1579799224.0,"What are your career goals? Are you cooking in Germany or abroad? Are you aware of the health impacts of a high stress career? Do you have any plans to manage that? 

I like to give young cooks a fair warning. In the states at least jobs are very low pay, rarely benefits and health insurance. Working nights weekends and holidays. For example I don't even care about Christmas now, it means nothing to me.

I had tendon issues so bad in my elbows I couldn't even open a heavy door without excruciating pain. It was caused by over use. 6 years later and it's not yet resolved. I had to work for a year with a hernia that had come all the way out into my scrotum while I worked 70 hours a week to pay for surgery.

I feel like I got ptsd from all the stress. 


Just a warning, this is not all glitz and glammer. Even when you get to the point of working for tv chefs and beautiful restaurants getting write ups in national magazines it's still mostly working a hot sweaty line that smells like hot garbage in the dish pit and a stressed out chef that yells at you. Eventually you get to be the one that does all the yelling. 

Just make sure you have an exit strategy in case you burn out and need to switch careers. The likelihood is very high.


Cooking professionally was one of the most fulfilling things I've ever done in my life, but also one of the most destructive. It's like a drug addiction. It's amazing and fun but so so bad for you. It's really hard to find a balance. And when you do it can be gone at the drop of a hat when the business goes under or changes ownership.

After that dies down in a couple weeks you only get hit with a little of that when it shows you're available. 

But that's the worst of it. It is completely acceptable to just ignore those guys. They're being pigs and they know it.

Interspersed with that there will be plenty of very nice guys who will be respectful and go at your pace.

It's really nice the way they set up the profile info you can put that you don't accept NSFW pics or just not at first. People can put what std's they have, if they're on PrEP, if they're top or bottom or top verse or bottom verse and you can put what tribe your in. 

There's tons of guys there and you can see right away what everyone is into. It saves a lot of time.

You'll be back on drugs in no time. This is not a solid exit strategy. 

You have to find a hobby and a social structure that doesn't involve drugs. Something physical will give you a great endorphin boost. That's probably why you like working.

Climbing is pretty awesome, it's what I do, but the gym memberships are expensive as well as gear and trips. But it's not impossible to get into. Often you can go for free to try it out. Once you see if you like it then the motivation will really be there.

You're young so try out for some sports at school. Track season starts soon. All you need is a pair of running shoes and some shorts. I was never the fastest sprinter but did great in middle and longer distance races.

Learn an instrument, learn programming, chess club, drama class, just try everything. You can quit if you don't like it. Just keep trying things until you find something that holds your interest like drugs.

Find a hobby that you are passionate about. Something that holds your interest the same way drugs did. Something difficult works best for me. I really love rock climbing but the injuries sideline me a lot.

Cut ties with your drug using friends when you get out. Probably the hardest thing ever.

When you make new friends and they start to talk about drugs, give yourself a head start and tell them a little about your past and ask them to keep it away from you.

All you need is a chin up bar (or anything else you can do a chin on) and two sturdy chairs. Or some gymnastic rings (which can be cheap). When I started l couldn't do a chin up or a push up because I had injured my elbows so bad.

There's the recommended routine on the side bar and even an app for Android and IOS. All the exercises have progressions. For example pushups start out standing up and doing them against a wall. We all start somewhere.

I smoked a lot of weed as a teenager. Started at your age. But I was a wrestler and didn't smoke much during season. I had a job during summertime so I had to be sober for that. I bought a guitar when I was 15 and immediately someone asked me to join their band. Stuck it out, got better, played some shows. We even borrowed a mixing board from a church and wiped a hard drive and downloaded pro tools and made an album. 

It wasn't much but all that stuff took effort and occupied my time in between the smoke sessions. So I wasn't just sitting around and getting blazed constantly. Also I developed a lot of problem solving skills. That's the biggest thing in life. You need to be able to over come obstacles and stay calm. Because life is one giant series of obstacles in the way of your goals. 

Weed can make you relaxed. But it can also make you complacent. And when you're used to that comfort bubble all the time and you get pushed out of it you will probably get more stressed than you would if you were used to dealing with stressful situations with a clear head.

He was all pale looking and splotchy. 

He ended up going to the hospital and then his parents put him in rehab. When he got out out he was healthy looking but kind of retarded. I think that's why he killed himself. 


Jai was nuts. He was a genius cat burglar. He could break into anywhere and steal anything. So he would steal so much cough syrup that all that was left to steal anywhere was the stuff with guafenisen in it. His tolerance was so high he needed at least two bottles to trip. He'd always get sent to the ER and they'd make him drink charcoal. 

So I'd call him up, ""Hey, how's it going? Need a ride to the show tonight?"" 

""Oh, I'm good. I had to go to the hospital again last night. Can you get any mescaline?""

Like, Jai. It's 1998, dude. Fucking people don't do mescaline any more. This isn't the 1970's. Nobody we've ever met has done mescaline. 

He ended up getting addicted to heroin and over dosing in his car while his new asshole friends went in his apartment and did all his drugs until morning. They just fucking let my friend die in his car.

Go get help. Try narcotics anonymous or an outpatient group therapy if you can afford it. The group thing really helps. You don't feel so alone and you can talk to people with similar problems and it cuts through that isolation you're probably feeling. In life relationships are very important.
