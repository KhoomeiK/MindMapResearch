You can get shit done but you have to do manual fixing all the time since if you move something or add more stuff it will fuck up the arrows and/or texts. Text coming on top of icons, connection arrow suddenly goes all over the place and so on. It's also not easy to change arrow type from one way to two way for example. Constantly I feel like I'm doing something very simple but this tool is spitting on my face and it becomes frustrating fast."

Also night time and million of other problems with this design. If it were so simple we would be using that design already. Its not about profits, its about the optimization. When you try to solve these problems with only solar panel on top of houses being the power source, you will soon have a similar grid just like now.

Many people make the mistake of stopping the train of thought on the first idea and not trying to critize it at all. Just like ”rich people have so much money why they dont eradicate hunger or give me some of it?”."

AskReddit,fc6278f,t1_fc5ie65,1577470597.0,Currently in Japan and this is very true. Youre supposed to eat/drink your stuff at the supermarket and throw it in the bin in there. Especially for a smoker this is pain in the ass and you mostly have to go smoke inside a restaurant or bar since they mostly allow smoking inside. My hotel has a smoking room (many hotels also allow smoking inside your room). Taking coffee to go is a nuisance since in addition to that you are not supposed drink or eat while on the move.
