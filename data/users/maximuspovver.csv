food,ff7mmdx,t3_erwmyq,1579653174.0,Does anyone know what the name for this is but when the pastry is more like a soft bread and not coated in sugar? But the inside is still the vanilla custard? I had it on holiday in Sicily and haven't found it since!!!

It teaches so many transferable skills. It's super sociable as well, with great comraderie in a good school. I would highly highly recommend."

IVF,fdsk299,t3_emz1yv,1578704150.0,"From the clinic side of things they say to have a full-ish bladder for the US tech and not to wear any perfume or strong smelling deodorant or make up as the embryos don't like these! Personally, I think it's best to try and be as relaxed (as possible under the circumstances)!!! It's like a smear test feeling due to the speculum and takes maybe 10 minutes max for the actual procedure."
infertility,fdr78ii,t1_fdr70rb,1578680468.0,I'm really sorry. I hope you manage to get some clarity and options from your doctor.
infertility,fdr6alr,t1_fdr4pq8,1578680118.0,I think there's also different methods so whether it was oral or vaginal or via injection can apparently have a differing efficacy.
infertility,fdr666a,t1_fdr4pq8,1578680045.0,How long were you on progesterone for? I think they're saying they would extend the support for up to 16 weeks when it's usually only around 8/9 weeks.
infertility,fdr4i5e,t1_fdr3k2b,1578679340.0,"Yeah about the progesterone!
I've actually just sat through a lecture about PRISM and PROMISE trials re: progesterone support in early pregnancy showing some benefit in women who have a history of unexplained miscarriages. So progesterone twice a day up to 16 weeks. 
I don't think it's very well evidenced yet and the benefit was only seen in certain subgroups but it might be worth mentioning to see what your doctor says!"
infertility,fdr1g73,t3_emjmwb,1578678222.0,Can I ask what luteal support you were given after your FET?
infertility,fdqytfy,t3_emsj89,1578676980.0,"I think there are a couple of things for you  to consider. First is that although you think the quality grades are disheartening the main point is that these embryos have carried on developing and have formed blastocysts. The grade is based on how the embryo looks but this is quite subjective and there is evidence that lower quality embryos still give live births. Secondly, there is a chance that the embryo might not survive the thawing process and in this situation would you be happy to carry on and thaw out the remaining embryo for transfer. I think a lot can be said for how stressed out you are while undergoing treatment and the best thing to do would be choose (if you have the option) what would make you less stressed. At my clinic they do give patients a bit of a say but they would choose to thaw better quality embryos first."
