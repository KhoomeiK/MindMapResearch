awakened,ffukczy,t3_ev8jd0,1580243786.0,"Fella if I may hint you’ve got it twisted. Weed and some other drugs amplify your awareness greatly, not sobriety. Meditation is cool, but doing it while high makes what you’re trying to notice much more obvious. 

Don’t believe anyone who tells you drugs are moving you away from understanding reality better. They’re essential for the easiest method of expanding consciousness."

RationalPsychonaut,ff6tyl2,t1_ff6rwd8,1579634827.0,"It totally does. No matter what your situation in life, rags to riches, one extreme to the other, true happiness can only be found within. You’d be surprised, movie stars or politicians or whoever with high status are often more miserable than common folk. They’re used to what they have and always seek causes for happiness outside their minds. Like trying to get bigger fame, more money or whatevs. So long as they look at life/themselves/others that way no amount of happiness will be enough, they’ll always want more. 

What psychedelics teach us is that pure bliss is available internally to all of us and right now! Love yourself unconditionally, love others the same, forgive their ignorance and look at them like you do your niece or nephew. You can transcend your destiny if you keep wondering the truth about reality. You’re obviously got a knack for it, so when you’re ready to learn more I advise you revisit these substances.

But since you’re handling it so well, you may want to figure out more. The limit is infinite. These substances are a pathway to evolving past the Homo sapien condition. Use wisely and stay safe!"

That’s not how it’s done. You have to play it cool with most people, don’t give off signals you’re smitten with her. Cos if you do, if she’s not in the same place, and most of them won’t be, you’ll get a check mate like you just did. 

Wait at least 10 dates before you bring up the topic of going exclusive."
