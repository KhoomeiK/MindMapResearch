Advice,ffdi3yi,t3_eszwdw,1579821342.0,I had about the same GPA in high school because I put absolutely no effort into it because I had no interest in it. I hated what I was learning. Couldn’t get into university right away because of my GPA so I went to community college for a year. Still didn’t do amazing but good enough to get into the university I wanted. Now studying Mechanical Engineering and have a 3.5 GPA. For me what changed was I was finally learning what I was interested in and started putting in my best effort. Your career is absolutely not fucked but you need to realize that this is going to take effort and it IS going to be hard. But once the 4 years or so are over it will all be worth it.
