Edit: Downvotes in full swing I see. Raise your hand if you are retarded and didn't understand that saying r/petthedamncat is a joke from the subreddit r/petthedamndog. If you're genuinely retarded and thought that someone seriously thinks ""PeT tHaT dAmN CaT"" then ok, I hope this dumb ass comment helped you understand that yes, veterinary professionals top priority is not to pet the animals. Otherwise, stop being wet blankets and taking everything so damn seriously. If I had a dollar for every Reddit thread where something made me laugh and someone has to come in and take it at face value... Damn that shit gets sad. Learn to joke. Learn to accept jokes. Just stop fucking taking clear jokes so seriously."

This is the first I've heard of or seen this joke, but I can definitely see it getting old if you see it all the time. I would just venture into wondering if the people saying it are saying it out of ignorance, or in an attempt to be malicious. I'd hope it's not the latter, but I could see it happening. 

I probably deserve my downvotes but thank you anyway"
dankchristianmemes,ff9g59q,t1_ff90l7z,1579712300.0,"Well at least you acknowledge you are doing the ""aktually"" thing. Still absolutely obnoxious, but I guess self awareness sorta helps you

Edit: Aww the dank memers here can't handle someone who doesn't like the aktually guy. Wahhhhh lemme smash the downvote to silence you"
sadcringe,ff9fff6,t1_ff9erwg,1579711862.0,"Not always but most of the time. What I think he's getting at is that you create your own issues to get to a situation like this. What is your relationship like with this girl? Why did you never make a move? Did you and it didn't go well? What are you doing to prevent yourself from falling for someone *to the point of being in love* while the other person's apparently oblivious? Or are they not oblivious and are trying to hurt you?

Not victim shaming here, I think what happened is sad and I definitely feel for this poster. But at the end of the day, to wind up in a situation like this, you've gotta kinda figure out how it got to that point. And when it comes to that, often times you find out that you are your own worst enemy."
