akita,feiygh1,t3_ep6uh9,1579150745.0,"I have an Akita and two cats. One of the cats likes to run around the house and is not friendly towards the Akita, and the other is mellow. My Akita chases and doesn't get along with/tolerates the first cat, but does with the mellow one. He is never left unattended with either of the cats as he has a strong prey drive. He was raised with both cats since he was four months old. Like others said, it depends on the dog and cat, but introducing an Akita puppy to cats sets up for the best chance of success."

They also may need help getting up and down stairs. I babysat a cat with CH that needed carried to bed every night. Otherwise, they should live a fairly normal life. Often, animals with things that don't require extra are still termed 'special needs' - such as an animal with three legs or one eye."

If it is, this dog is in no way suffering and will have a happy life despite some mobility issues! It is a disorder where the cerebellum in the brain doesn't fully develop - it is seen more frequently in cats and you can sometimes find these special need kitties in shelters looking for homes. As I said, it typically does not lessen an animal's quality of life, and I encourage people to adopt special need animals like this (or other special needs if they feel qualified to handle it). Thanks for sharing your adorable pup, OP."

aww,fe3hlh0,t1_fe3ewri,1578849350.0,"Having someone to take care of us when we are old is undoubtedly the most selfish reason for having kids. I understand your reasoning, you and I just don't see eye-to-eye on the fundamental morals of it. Your opinion, and the majority of the 8 billion people on the planet, directly results in the overpopulation issues we are having. My opinion, and choice not to have kids, directly benefits the people already living. Your children will have more of a future because of my choice not to have children. I fundamentally understand that having children = future humankind. However, I disagree that, in the current state of the world, that it is the responsible mindset to have due to the fact that children will unlikely have a future planet to sustain them, having children contributes to a currently overpopulated planet, and there's plenty of human beings already having children on the planet for the extinction of mankind to even be a remote possibility. The extinction of life on the planet as we know it, however, is a massive possibility."
aww,fe3dhjf,t1_fe38nls,1578848323.0,"I don't think you understand what is happening on our planet. We are literally going to be wiped out due to climate change and an uninhabitable world. Having kids right now not only contributes to the overpopulation problem, but brings people into the world who legitimately may not have a future world to live in and will die of starvation, lack of water, infection with no antibiotics, fires, flooding... Yes, people die from those things now, but it will soon be on a massive scale. Of course nobody likes to hear that they shouldn't have kids. I wanted kids. But I'm not willing to bring a human into the world that may not have a future and into a world that simply cannot sustain the people it has right now, let alone more individuals. Also, I'm not anthropocentric enough to believe humans are important enough to take every other species down in an effort to preserve mankind."

So your argument doesn't hold water in the current situation we are in. If our planet was at a sustainable human population, then having kids would be responsible, yes."

If I eat at a restaurant or support a company that widely contributes to animal suffering, am I really being moral in my goal to promote animal welfare? But don't I want to financially and directly support efforts made by companies to provide more plant-based food, hoping they'll provide more options and reduce their use in animal products if more people are buying vegan food?

Literally millions of koalas have died by burning to death due to human-induced fires - thankfully, millions of dollars have been contributed to help save their populations. Spreading the copypasta may bring a few laughs but it actually can be harmful to populations and I hope all of you are able to use your critical thinking to look past a weak attempt at humor that has circulated online and not let it undermine your desire to help certain targeted species of animals, such as koalas.
