Then he went in to get it checked anyway and it turns out he stopped breathing 90 times/hour. Severe sleep apnea starts at like 30... Now he sleeps with a c-pap and my mom stopped having headaches.
worldnews,fee6ra2,t1_fee4a42,1579027557.0,"You should never do word for word translation. In most languages, it would often make little or no sense. Maybe between very closely related languages, it doesn't matter so much, but still, there are idioms, slang etc. that you can't just replace. Word for word translation is often just shitty translation."
AskMen,fe8k0ip,t1_fe8j6ih,1578927006.0,But you said it. Maybe you should think why you reacted so negatively to a comment that was probably meant to be bait. In what way do you become a dick to her when things get heated?

aww,fdwu3wy,t1_fdwj1vf,1578762337.0,"My dog also was a terrier! You should try and teach him to search, it's really fun. Also, it's very engaging to them and a good way to still play with them when you're busy. And you can play hide-and-seek with them etc. You can try by hiding a treat in a visible or petty visible place at first, so he can associate finding it with a commend and understand what you want him to do, and then slowly try more advanced hiding places. There's a lot of good tips on the internet, this article seems pretty solid https://wagwalking.com/training/find-things."

aww,fdwrpqz,t1_fdwqy5u,1578761721.0,"Yeah, they can smell it, but not every dog knows how to pay attention to what they smell and how to identify objects by their smell. Sure, it probably comes naturally to most, but not all dogs. Many of them need to be trained to use their abilities properly. Otherwise, all dogs would alert things like low blood sugars, but they don't."
aww,fdw4vtg,t1_fdw2mc9,1578755092.0,"I'll just copy my reply: When a dog isn't trained in using his sense of smell it may not necessarily come naturally to him to distinguish the bones smell from far away. But yeah, if dogs didn't have object permanence search dogs wouldn't exist. I taught my dog in searching and I would show him a treat, tell him to stay and then go hide the treat in the garden or something. At the command ""search"" he would go and look for it. It would make absolutely no sense if he thought it disappeared completely."

aww,fdvmnro,t1_fdvhhp7,1578749111.0,"That means he has object permanence. If he didn't, he would think that the bone stopped existing if he doesn't see it, so he wouldn't search for it. There are a few studies that show that dogs have object permanence.

Voluntary renunciation of Iranian citizenship is possible under the law. They don't recognize dual citizenship though. Meaning, if you hold both passports Canadian and Iranian, when you enter or leave Iran you have to use your Iranian one. Basically in Iran, you won't be treathed as a Canadian."

Getting the data of the boxes is not as much of an issue as properly reading it and having the right processing software, which I don't think Iran has, but I'm not sure. We'll see if Iran gives the boxes to France or someone else. Boeing encrypting the data so it would be unreadable to anyone else would not be something that could happen."
