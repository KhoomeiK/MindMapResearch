ExecutiveAssistants,ff7xcnu,t1_ff7l498,1579660596.0,I also have a hard time saying no. I think it’s a hazard if the job that we always want to help but it can bite me in the arse and has! Option 2 is the best!
Episcopalian,ff4vtqp,t3_erfatj,1579573657.0,What a freaking adorable baby! Congratulations! 😍
ExecutiveAssistants,ff4lkjn,t1_ff4kzg3,1579566554.0,"Yeah,  I would just plow through right now and get it behind you. That’s really sucky that they put two newbies on a project like that. You’d think they’d pair you with someone who’s been there a little longer and set you up for success a little more."
ExecutiveAssistants,ff4ko5e,t3_erlun8,1579565932.0,"With you being new, I really hesitate to say tell her unless she’s directly asked. This might be one of those things that you just have to suck it up and do, knowing that it’ll get easier as you become more familiar with your responsibilities. I still hate one of my daily responsibilities; in the beginning it took me 2-3 hours a day but I’ve gotten it down to about an hour now. The girls you’re working with, unless they’re also brand new, should understand and appreciate that you’re new and that they may have to shoulder a larger share of the project than you. But it’s still less than they’d have to shoulder if you dropped off the project."

vegetablegardening,fesm904,t1_feqrwra,1579366720.0,HA! Fair point.
milwaukee,fepf4uf,t3_eq4vuq,1579318948.0,So glad I don’t work within those lines. What a PITA that will be.
vegetablegardening,fepes3w,t1_fepa57j,1579318703.0,"Originally, I was going to be a teacher but I had a prof in college who basically told me she didn’t think I was cut out for it and it really turned me off. So now I’m an EA. But I think it turned out for the best because I don’t think I could handle the parents. 😂"
vegetablegardening,fepa37h,t1_fep9u8e,1579315537.0,"Ahh, that makes sense. My parents were teachers too!"
vegetablegardening,fep9sy3,t3_eq8pjo,1579315352.0,I’m always jealous of people when they say they went away for a month. I don’t get that much vacation time in a year! Lol
TheMurderSquad,feoy72v,t1_felq377,1579307956.0,Yes! This is a great case. I’m not a local but I’ve seen some documentaries and shows about it. It’s a crazy and interesting case.
ExecutiveAssistants,felvzyn,t3_eprpna,1579232325.0,Not in London but there’s a FB group called The Leader Assistant that has EAs from all different countries. You might try there.
curlyhair,feijmkh,t3_eg4tfn,1579140052.0,"I use Banila Clean It Zero, which is a cleansing balm followed by Neutrogena HydroBoost (I have dry skin). I just use a little water on my fingers to massage in the Zero and then wipe it off with a wet wash cloth. When I use the HydroBoost, I don’t splash the water on my face, I use more of a cupping method and bring my hands up to my face and gently rinse it off a couple of times, if that makes any sense at all. I also put my hair back and use a headband if necessary."

TallGirls,fec9mks,t1_fec90q0,1578969114.0,"Aw, I’m sorry! But at least your shoes look cute while you’re injuring yourself. 😉 You know what’s funny is that when I was little, whenever I was bummed about my giant feet, my mom would always tell me that they had to be that big because I was so tall and that I’d fall over if they were  smaller."
TallGirls,fec8ax2,t1_fec5n0m,1578968397.0,"Omg, I’m so jealous of you! You can find  all the cute, cheap shoes! Meanwhile, my 6’ size 13 Sasquatch feet have to buy the expensive ones."

memes,fdzx6n1,t1_fdzwq9t,1578797975.0,Ha! Hardly. I’d kill myself in anything higher than 2/2.5”. Too klutzy for that.
memes,fdzv6rw,t1_fdz7rey,1578796564.0,"It goes the other way too. I’m a 6’ woman and when I was dating, it always seemed like men preferred more petite women. I actually had a guy tell me we couldn’t date anymore because I was too tall. To be fair, he had short man issues and wore lifts in his shoes. 🙄"
milwaukee,fdzugr9,t3_enf8jk,1578796073.0,Gorgeous pic! I’m totally jealous of your skills! I’m also too lazy/impatient to learn how to take a proper picture.  😅

PlusSize,fd6tnmo,t3_ek4f22,1578195564.0,"I agree with changing the subject or just removing yourself from the situation, whether by actually leaving the room or through earbuds or just tuning out and going on your phone. 

On the subject of social media, a couple of body positive IG accounts are @jameelajamilofficial (she’s on The Good Place) and her corresponding body positive/body inclusive IG account, @i_weigh."
todayilearned,fd5110f,t1_fd4zck2,1578173128.0,I did! But I was one of the last ones because math and I are mortal enemies. I think I got a Baby Ruth?
todayilearned,fd04k3x,t1_fd03gmx,1578113527.0,"Lol. Okay, I can’t argue with that. But the point I was trying to make is that what I hear, and I’d argue many people hear, when someone says it needs to be fixed is that the individual is not as worthy as a hearing person and needs to have a procedure to be brought back up to a normal level."
todayilearned,fd01c9b,t1_fczzl9x,1578112162.0,"That’s true in the strict sense of things. Instead of using the word good, I should have said that it implies that a deaf person is not as much of a person as a hearing person. That he or she is “less than”."
todayilearned,fczyzen,t1_fczkwg2,1578111059.0,"Lol at doctors or a bunch of deaf folks. But yes to all this! My parents were also deaf educators and this sounds exactly like what my mom has said so many times over the years. 

My dad actually didn’t learn ASL until he went to college at Gallaudet. He grew up in the 50s and 60s and went to mainstream public school with no interpreters and nothing to help him at all except for sitting in the front row. The fact that he went to college and got his masters and became a teacher and eventual superintendent of our state deaf school is especially impressive to me when you consider everything he had going against him."
todayilearned,fczxpbr,t1_fczqs9o,1578110411.0,That argument implies that a disability is inherently bad and that the disabled person needs to be normalized because otherwise that individual is not as good as everyone else. That’s the definition of ableism.
todayilearned,fczw1sp,t1_fczp498,1578109586.0,This! My three cousins are CODAs and they developed language with no problems. Just because your parents are deaf doesn’t mean you’re brought up in a silent world.
todayilearned,fczvaze,t1_fczo8ms,1578109222.0,"You miss so much without them! I love never having to rewind anything because if I can’t understand something, I just read it. That’s my number one complaint about seeing movies in a theater. If I miss what someone said, I get so annoyed there are no captions."
todayilearned,fczuj0t,t1_fczpy5m,1578108843.0,"My entire life, both my parents worked at the School for the Deaf and those classrooms could be louder than a hearing kindergarten class! Lol."
todayilearned,fcztubg,t1_fczomnh,1578108511.0,"So funny how that stuff sticks in our memory. I remember my 4th grade teacher had a mountain on a bulletin board and each of us had a little mountain climber and every time we memorized a multiplication table, she’d move us up a spot on the mountain and she would buy us a candy bar of our choice when we made it to the top, which I think was 10."
todayilearned,fczjtpi,t1_fczf3r0,1578102802.0,"Same here- I always have the captions on. I was reading before I went to kindergarten. The teacher chewed out my mom, who was also a teacher, for teaching me to read. She never did though and told my teacher that it was because of the captions. So that’s probably why you were an advanced reader too."
todayilearned,fczjikt,t1_fczewfn,1578102608.0,"HA! I’m only half CODA (mom is hearing) but I definitely relate to people telling you you’re loud; like yeah, my whole friggin family is loud! It took me years to bring it down to a point where I’m not told that all the time. Well, either that or people just don’t bother telling me anymore."
90DayFiance,fcrxbxg,t1_fcrbzap,1577907910.0,"This is exactly why when she described herself as a SJW, my husband and I were totally prepared to hate her. She didn’t disappoint. Most of my experiences with self-proclaimed SJWs have been like Tania. I’m all for social justice and equality but I feel like when you have to call yourself one like that, you’re not really in it for the right reasons."

CleaningTips,fcj4jb5,t1_fcixyqf,1577677096.0,"I totally get that but your house doesn’t sound like it’s anywhere near that. Also, if you’re worried about some spills and crumbs in your fridge, I doubt you’ll ever let it get that bad. Being a parent is hard enough so try to cut yourself some slack."
CleaningTips,fcfy53p,t3_eh1wp7,1577634758.0,Is there a reason why it’s so important to you that your son remember your house always being clean?

PlusSize,fc3vaiv,t1_fc3v21p,1577399535.0,"But from what you’ve said, it’s not just one comment, she has a history of doing it. If you said something to her, would she be receptive? Like if you explained how it makes you feel when she makes those comments would it make a difference?"
oddlyterrifying,fc2ykt6,t1_fc2cm26,1577377416.0,Happy cake day!
PlusSize,fc2xwvn,t3_eft9pe,1577376956.0,"Sounds like she’s projecting her unhappiness with her own size onto you. I’m sorry you have to deal with that, it really sucks. Is your fiancé willing to talk to her about it?"
