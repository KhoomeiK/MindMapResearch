Prime combos are not a question of technical ease, unfortunately, but rather a business issue. If they allow Primes to be had more easily, they increase the odds of you getting one of the 1-4 team primes for your team and therefore not needing to hunt for primes anymore.

That said, I'm fully in favor of a prime special combo and have proposed additional ways they could monetize it. Just saying it's not always about how hard it is to build the thing."

programminghelp,fcysroy,t3_ejlcl2,1578086292.0,"Hey hey. Lifelong Mac user here; I had to switch to Windows for work about 4 years ago. Before then, I hadn't used Windows for more than brief library searches or a typing class they made me take in high school. Seriously. Total Windows novice. 

First off, you can get Visual Studio Code for your Mac. It comes free with the Anaconda Python distribution. I use it as my primary editor because it seemed fine and I didn't care to find something else. That should help you get your feet wet.

One of the biggest differences between the OSes is the keyboard shortcut mappings. Even just going from Command on Mac to Ctrl on Windows takes some getting used to. I often end up doing some wacky things on both computers because my muscle memory takes over when I get deep into something. Editors often have different keyboard shortcuts as well. For instance, we use IntelliJ at my office, so I put the IntelliJ mappings into VS Code to try and reduce my mental workload. On Windows, Alt+J gives you multiple cursors, but in Mac it's Ctrl+G. So just be aware of that.

One big thing that always threw me for a loop in Windows is that applications close with their last open window. So if you have Firefox open and you close your window, Firefox closes too. This is different from Mac where the application can stay open without an open window. Most heftier applications in Windows will have prompts before closing the last window for this purpose.

Windows has a command prompt terminal but it doesn't accept UNIX style commands like \`ls\`. It has similar commands though (for example, \`dir\`). You can also download Git Bash, which should feel more like what you're used to.

Congrats on the new job! Hope it goes well."
