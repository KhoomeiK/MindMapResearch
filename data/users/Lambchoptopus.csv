GetMotivated,fc6xa02,t1_fc6vvxp,1577491868.0,"I will say. I have a cat I adopted, 2 year old and a kitten I found 2-3 month old and they make life much better. Sometimes pets can help, they give purpose, love, laughs and headaches lol my doctor gave me a note to help with the financial side on renting but I have anxiety and take meds so it wasn't much of a jump. Something that depends on you can lessen the load some days. That was my primary care because I told him I don't want to go to a specialist because of these reasons so he has been helping as much in his capacity."
GetMotivated,fc6tued,t1_fc6d2jg,1577489342.0,"Thanks, this happened about 4-5 years ago. My Aunt went into depression gained alot of weight from it. I deal with anxiety and hospitalized myself for depression when I was 19. The hospital felt like a prison. No door on bathrooms, caged windows, camera in room, no door on room. I couldn't have the 4 inch ribbon in my journal because I guess they thought I could strangle myself with it? They cut it out and threw it away. Monitored phone calls, it was a terrible experience and just made me feel like don't ever talk to anyone about anything otherwise you could end up killed or put in a place that is like prison. I encourage people to get help, Cymbalta took away my anxiety and frustration well but I am definitely cautious now on what I say and to whom."
