trashy,ff62g7o,t3_ergsvd,1579617445.0,Went on a photographic safari in Botswana 4 years ago. To have the privilege of seeing these magnificent animals... I could not imagine how anyone’s reaction could be “let’s kill it so I can adorn myself.”  Pathetic puny humans.

aww,ff4v8oc,t3_erh8cr,1579573253.0,"Probably a good time to remind folks to NOT use mouse/rat poison. Owls catch the poisoned rodents and eat them/feed them to their young. I volunteer at a wildlife center and we see way too many owls, hawks, other birds of prey, and many other animals who are suffering (and I mean truly suffering) from rodenticide poisoning. Sometimes we can reverse the effects but most times the animal is too far gone or has suffered other injuries as a result.  Thanks all!"

RealLifeShinies,fey34hf,t1_fevz98w,1579440136.0,"We live on a salt marsh and there are an abundance of hawks. The white squirrel has managed to evade their clutches for years. I’ve also seen the white frolicking with the greys, so social relations seem good. I’ve also noticed quite a few very light grey squirrels and have wondered if they might be his offspring."
RealLifeShinies,fey2cl7,t1_fevd8vu,1579439794.0,Wooster. So many great colleges in Ohio.
RealLifeShinies,feubjwh,t1_feu1v9q,1579384963.0,There were blacks ones on my son’s college campus in Ohio. And we had one brought into the Wildlife Center here on Cape Cod. No one had ever ever seen one on the Cape before. Nature is grand!
RealLifeShinies,fest3ln,t3_eqip8s,1579368758.0,"With those dark eyes, it looks to be leucistic - which is a partial loss of pigmentation that affects the fur but not the eyes - not albino. We have a beauty white squirrel in our neighborhood.  He’s magnificent."

interestingasfuck,feqz2yj,t1_feok674,1579347742.0,But you are absolutely right.
OldManDog,feqwxf9,t3_eq87wu,1579346985.0,Grieving with you ... a dog’s loss is a special kind of heartbreak.  Two within 6 months is cruel. Wishing you the comfort of a million happy memories.

OldManDog,fdw3e2e,t3_en2zub,1578754675.0,"When we lost our first dog, the vet said “the price you pay for your dog is in the end, not the beginning.”  Truer words... but still the best bargain you’ll ever make. So sorry for your loss."

dogs,fdvz472,t3_en286p,1578753328.0,I have 2 goldens and it is a rare day that they are not showered with love and compliments when we are out for a walk. And it never goes to their heads. Think about how insufferable any of us would be if random strangers approached daily and told us how beautiful we are. Further proof that dogs are better than humans and we don’t deserve them.

OldManDog,fdvgv9z,t3_en4v0b,1578747279.0,I’m so sorry for your heartbreak - which is the price we pay for the love of a dog. But isn’t it wonderful that he knew your love from the first minute he came into the world right up to the minute he left it?  Wishing you the comfort of a million happy memories.

rarepuppers,fdh614g,t1_fdgtkxg,1578416138.0,Wish you all the joy in your new pup. I hope you have a long happy life together.
rarepuppers,fdgslg7,t1_fdgq3jy,1578407257.0,Shockingly short life span for this beautiful breed. A friend of mine had three and couldn’t take the heartbreak. Any ideas why BMD’s have this low a life span?
