>no right wing extremist has ever shot up a church

That's what you think I said, what I said was: 

>Also also, I don't think a right wing extremist has ever shot up a church, much less ""every few months.""

I couldn't remember one, and googled, ""right wing gunman church"" and no results came up. Mea Culpa, good thing I added ""much less every few months,"" which was the entire point. Here's where someone might annoyingly say, ""first it was every few months, then you give one example from four+ years ago, MoVe GoAlPoAsTs MuCh?"" Defend your original point, don't nitpick the counterargument, it takes you away from your own stance to being with. 

>At any rate, you're doing an awful lot mental gymnastics to distort the reality that right-wing extremism consistently turns out mass killers.

Please, do point me to where I said anything like that. Pretty sure my entire point, which I put front and center, was verbatim:

>""Here's my big gripe, the trend of equating white nationalism with base conservatism, which has become depressingly common, is ridiculous.""

You're *trying*, poorly, to paint my opinion as one of right wing extremism isn't as bad/is just as bad as left wing extremism. I have no interest in making that point. You're mischaracterizing my point and making an argument against this imagined idea. An annoying and lazy way of saying that would be, ""using a strawman."" 

> I never said the right wing as a whole was anti-Semitic, and trying to suggest the there's no connection between those like Bowers and mainstream conservatism because the Republicans support Israel is utterly absurd.

You already said that. Again, please stick to the actual argument. And real quick, is disingenuous really the word you want to use? I'm not being sincere because I think that taking the .001% of more than 100 million and using that as way of representing the group is fucking ridiculous? 

Is islam a religion that inherently begets violence? In your words, it would be utterly absurd to say that the actions of extremists slitting throats in public and mowing down people in the street are not connected to mainstream islam. After all, you say we should judge a movement by it's extremes, right? I'd love to hear you argue this to some of the muslims in america who suffered so much abuse post 9/11. Because you've entirely avoided that point. So tell me, what makes it different? 

>It's pretty telling you can only come up with one instance of a left wing shooter in recent years.

Have you considered I'm not making the moronic right-left argument you're clinging to? I asked you a question, which you decided not to answer, about whether you'd consider it fair to connect his actions with democrats. As to why I picked that example did you think *maybe* it was because his motives were inarguable? I'd have hope you would have, because I explained as much. Maybe you didn't follow the news, but CNN reported the Dayton shooter had ""an extreme leftists"" twitter feed. But we can't connect his actions with the fact he was leftist right? Because for some reason you've yet to actually explain, you state that right wing gunmen clearly were influenced to become mass shooters by their right wing beliefs. In any event, my point is not that the left and the right's extremes are to be compared or analyzed. For the love of god, read more carefully or stop trying to pivot away. 

 >Because, again, the left isn't churning out gunmen year in and year out.

also you

>every few months we can look forward to a right wing gunman shooting up a Wal Mart or a synagogue or a church

Years, months, they're all just numbers, right?

>It's all too clear right-wing ideology is more effectively producing extremists than the left. Was this always the case? No, as the wave of leftist radicals in the 60s and 70s demonstrates. But that was 50 years ago, while 22 people were murdered at a Walmart six months ago by a right wing gunman.

You've brilliantly demonstrated my point on the fact that sloppy, careless verbiage is part of the problem. What's the difference between right wing gunman and right wing extremist? Nothing, because the idea is that the right wing, in general, is to blame for the extremists. I'm begging you, return to the actual point I was making about judging a movement/religion/group by it's extremists, just read what I already wrote and added here. That was my entire argument, and you literally glossed over it with ""it's stupid to not.""

worldpolitics,ffajif7,t1_ff93cr9,1579737284.0,"Frankly, I find the reasoning in that article pretty garbage, which is really par for the course when it comes to CNN opinion pieces. First, the entire article is based on an idea put out by Clinton's former press secretary. Could he be right? Sure he could. Is that the most obvious and likely explanation? Not even close, let me tell you why.

From the article:
>""The President is deliberately creating a circus show bringing back some of the best acts from the last three decades,""

Ken Starr was the lead on the only other impeachment investigation in modern history, and was the solicitor general under Bush Sr. I already mentioned the fact that Dershowitz was already a big shot lawyer accustomed to high profile, complex cases, but the reason he was picked is even more obvious than his qualifications. Dershowitz literally wrote a book entitled, ""The Case Against Impeaching Trump"" in 2018. He's also not just a lunatic trumphead, as evidenced by the many trump decisions, from the travel ban to the failure to single out white nationalists specifically after charlottesville, Dershowitz has openly denounced. So either Trump is creating a media circus for his base that relies on the fact it's a ""circus"" because Ken Starr was involved in Clinton's impeachment as lead investigator. Oh, and how is hiring Dershowitz a part of Trump's 'circus'? Well, the article ignores that one, all it says regarding Dershowitz is according to Julian Zelizer, who's a history professor and not a lawyer, Dershowitz's defense of Trump is wrong. 

Forgive me if I'm tired of CNN claiming Trump is both a clueless moron and a calculating strategist. Everyone knew from square one the senate was not going to convict based on the established facts, Trump adding star power lawyers is less a circus than it is a fairly unsurprising addition of a guy more qualified than basically any lawyer in the country to defend an impeachment and another guy who wrote the book on the subject already.

Ironically, the 'circus' surrounding this appointment is a direct product of outlets like CNN reporting headlines like ""TRUMP HIRES EPSTEIN LAWYERS"" knowing exactly what they're implying."

Here's my question, though it's somewhat rhetorical: is that really the bar? Beating people up and in more than one case hospitalizing people, some of which as a result of mistaken (or worse *assumed*) identity is not a big deal because no one died? Come on now.

>According to accounts by Bowers's coworkers of 20 years ago, and analysis of his recent social media posts, his conservatism became radicalized as white nationalism

Here's my big gripe, the trend of equating white nationalism with base conservatism, which has become depressingly common, is ridiculous. Part of the problem imo is simply the verbiage. People hear far right and far left, and naturally think the far right is inherently a part of 'the right,' and therefore 'the right' as a whole ought to be judged and/or evaluated by the beliefs and actions of it's fringe, extremist sector. Consider the fact that lumping right wing extremists/white nationalists with base right wingers is lumping together a group that hates Jews and would love to see them disappear with a party that outright refuses to criticize Israel and has essentially zero record of antisemitism. Meanwhile, there are elected officials on the left that have a *remarkably* concerning history and connections to anti semitic actors, including terrorists (this is something I'd be happy to elaborate on). But I digress, the point is I don't think any reasonable person could take a step back and say the right wing is at all anti semitic.

The difference in policy at that point is staggering, and yet, For example, the Sanders supporter who thankfully failed in his attempt to murder a congressional whip and his staff, along with police officers. Would you say it is fair to connect his attempted murders with democrats? Of course it isn't. Meanwhile the Pittsburgh shooter set out to murder jews. Much like the congressional shooter, his targets make the motive obvious: anti semitism. Was he a far right actor? Yes. Is the far right more prone to antisemitism than the far left? Sure. But remember post 9/11? Normally level headed folks were out for blood, and islamophobia worldwide never came back down. Here's a case in which several thousand innocent people died, and it was plainly laid out that radical islamist beliefs were to blame, with the architect behind the attack plainly stating it was part of a holy war against the U.S. and its allies; a Bin Laden authored fatwa issued for the killing of american citizens and the declaration of Jihad make this clear. And yet I'm betting (and hoping) you wouldn't be caught dead saying it was plain Muslim terrorism, and wouldn't be so foolish as to think Islam itself ought to be adjudged for the actions of muslim extremists.

Also, are we really going to pretend a guy insane enough to not just despise Jews, but hate them so much he is willing to kill them and die doing so has nothing to do with just being 'right wing'? Shit, which party essentially refuses to ever criticize Israel?

More poignantly, it's time to stop injecting MLK into modern debates outside his immediate and most effective sphere. MLK helped turn the tides of institutional racism in America.

He also thought Communism was evil as it ""robs man of that quality which makes him man...being a child of God""

He also believed homosexuality was a mental disorder that was to be treated with psychiatry.

I mean anyone with half a brain will likely recognize you're just making this up after reading ""normal attorney strategy,"" but this is stupid all the way through. First, no, it's not even close to normal, common, or even occasionally seen for someone to hire an attorney because of knowledge they A. cannot divulge to their new client without risking disbarment, and B. cannot divulge to anyone, whether in a court of law or not, without being disbarred and tossing their career. Let's also not forget we literally know nothing when it comes to the extent of Epstein's lawyers' knowledge, and the idea the lawyers personally keep blackmail records from Epstein is pure speculation.

More importantly, what is a common tactic is hiring lawyers with experience and a winning track record in big time cases when you can afford them. For example, Ben Brafman is a big shot lawyer who defended Plaxico Burress after his shooting, Martin Wolmak (of the infamous Jewish torture *gett* ring), Harvey Weinstein, and Martin Shkreli. Why? Because he's a big name and had a track record with huge cases already defending everyone from big time mob bosses to Michael Jackson. 

Dershowitz defended Epstein, as well as a number of other high profile cases, including being on of the few alive and practicing members of the O.J. Simpson 'Dream Team.' He was the youngest tenured professor in the history of Harvard where he taught law for five decades. The idea that Trump hired Dershowitz because he 'has dirt' from being Epstein's lawyer is insane. Epstein would be an absolute idiot, and his legal team entirely incompetent, if he told them the truth rather than the bare minimum they needed to put together a defense. Call Trump an ass for hiring a lawyer skeevy enough to defend Epstein, but the conspiracy bullshit makes you look clueless."
