Did your skate shop receive the shipment today? I thought these dropped a while ago. Either that or these are still sitting in shelves."
insaneparents,ffaaa3m,t3_esiigc,1579730953.0,What a privilege it is to live in America where you can deny you and your loved ones basic healthcare. Long live the USA.

THOOOOOOSSSSSSEEEEEE!!!!!!"
insaneparents,ff7qgnv,t3_es3c53,1579655870.0,"I grew up with this kind of stuff. My parents didn't have to punish me like this because teachers where I'm from were allowed to enact this form of punishment on students. This is mild compared to corporal punishments especially public canning.

I'm sad to see comments who support this form of punishment get downvoted to oblivion. This does not mean I approve of this either. I just want those people to realize how apathetic they are to parents who use this form of punishment because they're too busy being ""sympathetic"" for the kid being punished. The parent was once a kid too. All I see here are people being uncomfortable with the lives forced onto other people, who don't know better.

I think there needs to be a more comprehensive discussion than this. I would like to know alternative (effective) ways of disciplining a child."

DunksNotDead,feefpfa,t3_eooary,1579032815.0,Ohhh. You bought resale... Yeah. The resale should be way higher. If you put it in that sense then you're right about people sleeping on these. I think its because it's a high instead of a low.
DunksNotDead,fee4t8j,t3_eooary,1579026404.0,Sleeping? I could be wrong but weren't the shoes sold out within a couple of hours?
streetwear,fee4plc,t3_eoo7a3,1579026344.0,I was an Adidas fanboy during the Jeremy Scott days but Adidas lost me with Kanye. I'm not saying his shoes are bad because I can't judge without owning a pair. Runners just aren't my style. I like chunky sneakers like Jordans.
