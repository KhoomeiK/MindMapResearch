Dogtraining,fdomea6,t1_fdolieh,1578608099.0,"Oh yea. We actually got rid of one set we had because the steps were just a little too steep for her and she was having to jump up too much for my liking. 

Ive had a couple Dachshunds growing up so Im aware of their common health risks, just never had one this small. But my Mom rly wasnt the ""shining beacon"" of dog care so Im constantly trying to learn more about the breed so I can do right by her. 

She had a rough start in life so I want whats best for her without adding undue stress."
Dogtraining,fdol2h3,t1_fdmvrto,1578607307.0,Gonna have to keep building her up to this then! Can I ask what you mean by proper walks though? Want to make sure Im understanding what you mean. :)
Dogtraining,fdokye1,t1_fdmqkar,1578607241.0,Thanks for the suggestions! I am trying to get her into an indoor adult small dog playgroup for some socialization thats a little more structured than simply going to the dog park. I do worry about her running into a dog on our walks because some of my neighbors dogs are not very friendly. She definitely gets more like an hour to two hours of play.
Dogtraining,fdokrle,t1_fdnz811,1578607131.0,"How odd! Maybe some of them are not? The one by me has dogs all the time. The only time an employee ever said anything about it was in the garden section, and it was just a warning to not let him drink any of the water on the ground because they have pesticides they spray."
Dogtraining,fdojvf6,t1_fdoj5k0,1578606618.0,"I... wasn't doubting you? I literally just said what I had been told and that I would be asking my vet about it more as I had never of this before, and thanked you for the reply. Your hostility was not needed at all here."
Dogtraining,fdoge6a,t1_fdog66c,1578604612.0,"My vet literally told me that if my dog had a slimy bowl movement I was walking him too early after eating, because I pay way too much attention to poop and asked lol. 

The only thing I've heard about anal glands needing to be expressed are in very small dogs or large dogs with blockages. My entire life we have never had to take a dog to get them ""expressed"". Next time Im at the vet though Ill ask more about this. Thanks for the reply!"
Dogtraining,fdo5xi2,t3_emd7p0,1578599466.0,"I would suggest staying away from dog parks and finding a puppy play group to join instead. At this age puppies are still learning how to socialize and whats appropriate behavior. Dog parks are notoriously bad places to try and teach proper socialization as you don't know the other dogs and their level of training, or the owners. In puppy play groups you usually have a trainer or behaviorist running it, able to answer questions and monitor play to make sure its appropriate. Your pup is likely not aggressive but doesn't know how to say hi properly and gets overly excited. This can certainly *look* like aggression and can be scary, but is almost always just an overexcited puppy not knowing how to appropriately show that excitement. 

You can find free puppy play groups at Petco and Petsmart that have training classes available. Sometimes your local shelter or humane society will offer them for free or for a small fee."
Dogtraining,fdo24zi,t1_fdmxtaq,1578597499.0,Can you further explain? I've never heard of dogs needing walks because of their anal glands...
Dogtraining,fdnkrcc,t1_fdlfva1,1578587858.0,"I could never walk her that much ðŸ˜³

Because of her bad knees, walks are important but we have to be super careful not to overdue it or we can inadvertantly make her knees worse. Vet recommended a short daily walk for about 15 min if just walking, 30min if its a more casual stop and sniff stroll. 

Even with play we dont let her go hard longer than 10 min at a time so that she doesnt overwork her back legs."
Dogtraining,fdlsti9,t1_fdls0yc,1578531661.0,"Yea I know already that doggie boots are not happening lol. I can't even clip her nails myself, we have to make a special trip to the vet. I did get her a coat/sweater but she really hates having it on. She doesn't really like anything constrictive around her chest, which is hard already to find things that fit around."
Dogtraining,fdlse0m,t3_em1u1q,1578531369.0,"Stick to her routine, don't over spoil. If you can, allow her to smell her friend after hes gone. Dogs mourn their lost friends and it will be much harder for her if hes there one and day and simply gone the next without any context. For all my dogs growing up they either died in home naturally, or we paid a vet to come to the house. Then we allowed ALL the animals in the house, cats included, to sniff their departed friend. They know death when they smell it, and its good to give your dog context for the loss. It helps them mourn and move on. 

The one time we didn't do this and our dog passed at the vets office (he ate something he shouldnt have and got sick really fast) the rest of the dogs in the house pined for him for months, not knowing where he had gone or if he was coming back. The mourning time if we let them sniff first was much much less. I swear my mastiff mix looked for the dog we lost at the vets up until he moved on himself."
Dogtraining,fdls16g,t3_em1vmx,1578531126.0,"This would make me wonder if the food they were feeding previously caused the dog discomfort and that was the root cause of the behavior issues. My Chi mix, when his stomach is upset, is the grouchiest little dog. It would look to someone who doesn't know him like he just has a bunch of behavioral issues. He doens't listen well, doesn't want to be touched or handled, will guard toys from the other dog but wont play with them. 

Raw food diets are said to be much better for the dog, but the science is still out on that one. I personally have never heard of food alone fixing a dogs behavior unless the behavior was actually stemming from discomfort/pain that new food resolved which the owner was unaware of."
Dogtraining,fdlqsqo,t1_fdlpv7l,1578530283.0,"Yea I gave up entirely on giving her treats out on walks or in places shes unfamiliar because shes just too stimulated at the time to really even want them. She is getting better at taking treats, strangely, from our friends but still not quite there with us."
Dogtraining,fdlqpbd,t1_fdkwbp9,1578530217.0,"Thats my 15lb Chihuahua mix. He HAS to get his daily walk or spend the day at doggie day care or he is a nightmare to deal with. The doxxie though, while high energy, is not nearly as much of a nightmare if we don't say, play with her as much that day. I do want her to go on walks more out of building confidence and for socialization, but I think I'll not force the issue *too* much and let her kinda set the pace a bit."
Dogtraining,fdlqjcg,t1_fdlpj0f,1578530101.0,"Thats what he's saying, though I think walks are important not just for exercise but mental and social enrichment. Though from the comments Im seeing so far, I think its probably good for he and I to meet in the middle on this and just take her out when its more comfortable outside (mid afternoon) and also when she actually seems interested. She does get a lot of exercise and attention at home. He and I work different schedules so neither dog is ever at home alone for more than 4 hours tops."
offmychest,fdlq83t,t3_elwe5j,1578529891.0,This is so great to hear! congrats! Im almost nine years strong with what started out as a wonderful friendship turned into long term partnership. There truly is something magical about being with someone you can truly be yourself around.
Dogtraining,fdlpy96,t1_fdkvlx0,1578529703.0,"My small dog does the same thing. I think in her case its ""I dont want to go out there its cold/windy/etc"" but then she waits a couple more minutes and her need to pee/poop becomes too strong to ignore. Then she finally will go out, but in her case... if we don't catch the switch then shes just as likely to go in the house as she is in the yard. So we don't really give her the ""choice"" anymore. If I say outside, outside you go to at least TRY."
Dogtraining,fdleqdl,t1_fdldxmm,1578522439.0,Thats how it works for my 15lb male. The first part of the walk (which is conveniently also kinda boring for him) is walk time. We are hustling. Once we turn down a side street headed towards the local park he knows its more smelling time. For her I let her set the pace at the moment as shes still getting used to the leash. We stop and sniff when something catches her attention and then hustle off again. Walking with her fur brother has helped her structure a bit more since he gets impatient with her stopping too much lol.
Dogtraining,fdleaer,t1_fdlcgrm,1578522172.0,"This makes me think shes just being particular then... I live near the coast in California, U.S. We are usually between 50-60 degrees Fahrenheit during the day. Mornings is closer to 40-45 but we never get much below 40 even in the dead of night :/"
Dogtraining,fdlap19,t1_fdl8vle,1578520010.0,"My small front yard :)

I'm very lucky in that we got an apartment that has a small front yard, which gives both dogs enough room to go to the bathroom and even play fetch a little in. Its not a long run by any means, but with her especially being so small Im sure it seems much larger to them. Never would have adopted her with all her known issues if I didn't have a good easy place for her to go without needing to walk somewhere. The shelter was very good about being upfront on all her issues."
Dogtraining,fdlai8n,t1_fdl9a32,1578519900.0,Oh man we had a Dachshund like that growing up but I always thought he complained about changes in the walk because he was fat and lazy lol. Sounds like a breed thing for them then instead. Her vet did recommend getting a kiddie pool this summer and teaching her to swim as good exercise for her bad knees so maybe Ill take that suggestion. Otherwise the advice was regular short walks so that she builds and maintains strength in her back legs.
Dogtraining,fdlabgv,t1_fdl9upp,1578519789.0,"Thank you! Though I think she would starve if I tried to hand feed her lol. She also has to eat wet food at least once a day because she doesn't drink enough water for her digestion to be happy, so I'd rather not hand feed that :P 

I do add treats randomly to her bowl as she eats though and shes slowly, carefully, sometimes, taking a treat from my palm as long as I stay very still. Im not sure what made certain things so scary for her. All in all shes grown a lot and has given me a lot more trust now than when we first got her."
Dogtraining,fdl98g4,t1_fdkzy3h,1578519198.0,"He could... but hes very nervous about it. Hes brand new to dog ownership where this is not my first rodeo. He worries about a lot of things I don't even think about anymore. With how skittish she can be, hes really afraid of her freaking out on him and him not knowing what to do to calm her down. While I've worked with her a lot, some things still can send her in a panic and shes very good at squirming out of things so I think hes concerned she could get out of her harness and disappear on him. 

I don't push it too much because honestly he loves her to death and they play soooo much during the day. Yesterday I came home and she didn't even wake up to say hi to me she was so tired from their rousing game of fetch from the yard through the house lol."
Dogtraining,fdl8wn3,t1_fdl7ry2,1578519040.0,"Thank you for posting this! This makes me feel a lot better about taking it slower with her and letting her decide the pace a bit. She is a very happy little dog and gets lots of playtime at home so its not for lack of exercise. I do worry about her keeping her socialized, but we also regularly have people over and shes gotten loads better with visitors. I do have a small yard too, so walks are not a neccesity for her to relieve herself or to get some sun every once in a while. I bought a patch of fake grass for her when she was still refusing to even look at a harness so that she could have something soft under her paws too (my yard is mostly gravel). During the summer she loves laying in the sun on it."
Dogtraining,fdl8hyh,t1_fdkyki7,1578518843.0,"I've tried food but shes a little weird about treats. Loves them, but shes super nervous about taking food from human hands. I usually have to put the treat on the floor for her. She won't even take chew sticks directly from me. When shes out on a walk shes almost always either too nervous to eat or too interested in smelling something to pay attention much to what Im offering."
Dogtraining,fdl89d4,t1_fdl12vy,1578518724.0,"We dont have much of a yard as we live in an apartment but its definitely big enough that she can run around and play fetch. Ive started growing plants as well so she does have some mental stimulation on that regard, as she loves to travel among the pots smelling them all. 

Maybe I am overly concerned about this and shes just fine. I just feel bad when one dog gets to go to the beach, on hikes, to the store, while shes stuck at home in what appears to me as such a small world."
Dogtraining,fdl50zr,t1_fdkxqgb,1578517152.0,"My male dog LOVES his trips to Home Depot and other stores. I hadn't tried taking her out to stores yet because she gets so nervous around new things, but maybe thats part of the solution to helping her acclimatize as well."
Dogtraining,fdl4vrn,t1_fdkwokg,1578517083.0,"Thank you for the suggestion. Im thinking that with winter here yea, we need to do that reconditioning too. Which means she might not yet really be ready for daily walks and I just got a little over excited at her progress."
Dogtraining,fdkw052,t1_fdkvtgl,1578512309.0,Definitely could in the summer. Right now by the time I get home its dark out and even more cold out than on the morning
Dogtraining,fdktw2a,t1_fdkswh4,1578511062.0,"Definitely did that first :) 

She does have bad knees in her back legs. Not bad enough for surgery, but if she doesn't strengthen them with regular exercise and keep lean we may end up having to. Shes already on a supplement, and I waited about a two months for the supplement to really start helping (not seeing her run and lifting a leg anymore for example) before we started trying to walk outside at all. 

And I absolutely walk her with my other dog! Its more that if we only walk on weekends it means adding an extra walk for him so that he can still go to places like the dog park/hikes/beach etc, and gets the daily walk with her. I am concerned that maybe winter is just too cold for her to comfortably be outside. She does have a sweater but she doesnt like wearing it, and Im not really surprised considering how many harnesses I bought and went through finding the one that shes most ok with."
Damnthatsinteresting,fdihjqv,t1_fdign49,1578443063.0,Awesome thanks for the link!
Damnthatsinteresting,fdigi9c,t1_fdig8xy,1578442382.0,"I don't have names of them at the top of my head but this article goes pretty in depth about the changes. Including how for some women it changes the type of men they are attracted too.

dogs,fdig5kg,t1_fdhkbyz,1578442153.0,"Im going to say this. If that dog is taking pain like that like a champ, then she has definitely punished it before for showing discomfort. I don't think that dog is not in pain. He just learned its safer to hide it than show it."
dogs,fdig14s,t1_fdh9r9u,1578442074.0,"The one time I clipped my small dogs nails too short, I couldn't stop shaking for an hour. I felt so bad, there was so much blood, and she was obviously scared and in pain. I haven't clipped her nails since. I pay the vet to do it, and know that if they do go too far at least shes in capable hands to help her feel better immediately. I can't imagine purposefully putting my dog through that just because I was mad about something."
dogs,fdifk3w,t3_ele34n,1578441767.0,"Just because its not technically illegal doesn't mean its not abusive. You are right in trying to not  anthropomorphize how the dog might be feeling, but either way this is not right. Your gut is correct in feeling uncomfortable about this. 

However, I would suggest caution if you do decide to contact the shelter she got the dog from. You said this is your roommate... If you were to contact the shelter and they did reach out, they wouldn't just take the dog from her on your word alone. They would likely send someone out to talk to her, find out what was going on etc. She would KNOW it was you who called. Are you willing to turn your living environment into something very toxic, without any guarantee the shelter will even do anything?"
Damnthatsinteresting,fdiev74,t1_fdiemnj,1578441320.0,"A bit yea, cause the hormones in  birth control are meant to change a woman's natural cycle. Some forms of BC work by basically ""tricking"" the body into thinking its already pregnant. That gives off an entirely different smell, and so some women who are single may find it harder to attract someone purely because evolutionary speaking they don't ""smell"" available."
