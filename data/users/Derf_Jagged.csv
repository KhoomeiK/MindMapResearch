EatCheapAndHealthy,ffqktpm,t1_ffqi66w,1580137308.0,"Many of the Trader Joe's meals, including the one I just linked, don't have preservatives since they come frozen and don't need preservatives unlike fast food. The frozen meal is 30% of calories from fat, the Taco Bell is 49% calories from fat. You can plainly see there's way more saturated (animal, unhealthy) fat in the Taco Bell."
EatCheapAndHealthy,ffqi13s,t1_ffqcmak,1580135165.0,"What? Taco Bell beef is only 88% actual meat according to the lawsuit and likely just barely hits the USDA mandate of 70% lean minimum to keep costs low judging by how much grease comes off of them. I've never seen someone argue that Taco Bell meat is high quality lol.

According to this [nutritional facts calculator](https://www.calorieking.com/us/en/foods/f/calories-in-tacos-crunchy-taco-with-seasoned-beef/YA5wcaHGSk6K6_wRIfUoQw), the same amount of grams of Taco Bell taco vs [Trader Joe's mini tacos](https://www.becomebetty.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/wp-1478829398909-1024x1012.jpg) are roughly equal in comparison all around, so you're not wrong about the sodium. However, Taco Bell has preservatives and fillers whereas Trader Joe's frozen foods [almost] never do. Tacos are probably the low end of the difference spectrum since lots of fast foods are fried versus baked."

That would be why you aren't getting much value out of it. It also can make a big difference if you tweak the settings using FirebrandX's recommendations. The two main features that people buy them for are:

1) Line multiplying so that your TV doesn't upscale it and make it look bad

2) To be able to use RGB, component, and VGA through one HDMI port"
OSSC,ffqfp3a,t1_ffq2im4,1580133227.0,Sadly it'll add a frame of lag in that mode. I guess it wouldn't matter too much as long as it's not a fighting game or racing game. Is there a list of games that change resolution?
360hacks,ffpiohs,t3_euhwlx,1580095974.0,"From the manual:

> Due to a technical limitation in Linux, the platform in which the xk3y is built on, a maximum of 2TB is visable on any one storage device. If you have a 2+ TB storage device the xk3y will note see the device. It is advised to partition your storage device into partitions that are smaller then 2TB. For example, if you have a 3TB storage device you can partition the device into 2 x 1.5 TB partitions and the xk3y will see both partition as separate storage devices.
