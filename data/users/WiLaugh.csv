depression,fcmt41h,t1_fcmr1o7,1577790957.0,"I dont think i have any life goals, not big ones at least, i mean, i not even felt in love once so im not sure what to do with my life, my family thinks i have big plans for my future but the true im not even sure if i want to go outside and face the world or stay in bed like the coward i am.

Something i would like to change for sure is my insecurity, i feel insecurity is one of many things that is stopping me to go on life, maybe if was more secure this year everything will be a little bit different."
