depression,fgjqc3r,t3_eyphui,1580849308.0,"Ikr ,, you can literally get a job for just being pretty and I'm not just talking about being a supermodel. It's just sooo many set backs and disappointments that come with being ugly that it hurts......"

kpop,fghv2ag,t1_fghoh06,1580794721.0,"Wow this all makes sense now and actually I thought Kim Lip did it but I could be wrong, apparently I'm not as big of an orbit as I thought, but I'm pretty sure Choerry doesn't do the adlibs for LCM, her voice sounds completely different"
kpop,fghfyps,t1_fgg9ggx,1580783953.0,"Okay but that doesn't take the fact away that E:U and Onda didn't fit Mia's lines at all. The other 3 girls sounded just fine raw, that's why they kept all their lines. I think with a little more practice Onda could of done it though, she didn't sound that bad to me"

SuicideWatch,fga61fj,t3_exlb3n,1580647156.0,"I feel what you're going through. I recently had to leave my job of 4 years because my boss was a complete asshole and she was attractive so I know everyone was just kissing her pretty little ass. 

But anyway I think a lack of motivation is what's going on here. You went for the arts degree so I'm sure something interest you at some point in time"

Btw good luck on that boss in Ehmead Hill XD"
