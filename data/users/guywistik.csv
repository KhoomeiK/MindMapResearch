Gaslighting, name calling, cold shoulder, etc...

It hurts and cuts deep. 

We already have to deal with being overworked and underpaid. Breaking our bodies for pennies can affect our mental health, too.

Some of us have neglectful parents, especially when it comes to the relationship between mother and son. This dynamic and subsequent failure to nurture causes traumatic pain that is easily brought to the surface in a toxic relationship.

I'm actually laying in bed right now with no drive to do anything. Jobs take advantage of my hard work ethic, GF of 10 years still doesn't trust me. I've been recently accused of potentially talking to girls on reddit for some reason. Not sure where that came from. Had a recent job offer that was taken back because I never graduated high school, even though they said experience would suffice. After weeks spent preparing for this job, paying for a CDL permit and driving countless miles they ghosted me. My last $200 for nothing. Fuck Crystal Springs."

During one winter we didn't even have a door. We were one of the first families in the area to have a home built by habitat for humanity. We had a lot given to us. You'd think my family would be grateful, but no. The property is trashed and the home is crumbling and filled with mold after only 20 years. My brother is 30, has 2 kids and lives with my mom. They have received food stamps for almost 10 years.

From my experience, excess causes a warped perspective of importance and self-worth. This idea that we need to strive to ""make it"" is very misquided. That puts too little value on those doing thankless jobs like janitorial work or stocking groceries. These types of jobs should still allow for a decent standard of living. 

A lot of success comes from luck, and as a society we put too much value in someones luck. It's a key reason there is such an uproar regarding compensation for college athletes, especially football players.

I can't give you all the answer but I can tell you this... You're worth love and women think cleaning is sexy. Also, the tongue is mightier than the penis."

Maybe remind him that some men have permanently lost their ability to even get an erection. My friend broke his pelvis which damaged his nerves near his groin. He can't feel much or get an erection. My uncle was sliding down a tree as a kid and his testicle got snagged by a knot and ripped off. Many veterans deal with these types of injuries. 

He shouldn't worry. Many men would be happy to trade places with him. He also shouldn't worry about the persons comments because, meh... it's not worth letting someone bring you down with childish statements.

Good luck. Also, a good tip when he's giving you oral (this is where every man needs to shine), he should come in at an odd angle, head tilted slightly, like hes making out with the lips of your vagina. Gotta use the tongue and lips in sync. Dont be afraid to grab his head and put him where you want him. I know its not the info you asked for, but it gets my GF shivering."
