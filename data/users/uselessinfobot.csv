Jung,fesbc6p,t3_eqadel,1579363461.0,"I've kept a Google document for the last several years. I'll label the date of the dream and then whatever I can remember. It's handy because it's searchable if I realize a potent symbol or image is showing up in recent dreams that I recognize from a dream a long time ago. I've made connections that I probably wouldn't have otherwise recognized.

At the top I jot down my ideas of what certain places or people represent for me, like a glossary (as my understanding changes over time)."

That's a pretty interesting comparison to the junk food we make today that's filling but has very little actual nutrition."

loseit,fcwe2b5,t3_ej9geo,1578023279.0,"Please be patient with yourself. If calorie counts are difficult for you, that's totally fair. But it may also mean you need to take a break from the scale while you adjust to a new way of eating. Easier said than done when you are motivated to make it happen, I know, but the water and food weight are going to fluctuate and make things even more stressful if you are looking at that number on a daily basis.

I find that the more obsessed I am with ""losing weight', the more I think about food, the more I feel deprived, the more I want to eat, and it feels like a spiral of self sabotage.

But when I'm more permissive yet observant with myself, i.e. ""I *can* have this donut, but do I *really* want it and would it really satisfy me long term?"" I feel more honest and less tempted. This may or may not work for you, but any ""diet mentality"" - CICO, keto, or otherwise - can be counter productive if it simply turns into food obsession.

That said, some food issues are way above Reddit's paygrade, and might be worth working through with a professional counselor if you have access or have not done so already.

Good luck with your goals, and please be kind to yourself!"

dogs,fcu2av3,t1_fctmgaf,1577970269.0,"It is very sad for those dogs, I know they must have a lot of frustration (I would often hear them take it out on each other behind that fence). I don't think they've been taken away, but I really hope this is a wake up call for some kind of intervention that will help them. For now we are just steering clear of that lot until we know there is a stronger fence in place.

Ours is doing pretty well. We made sure to have him play with some dogs he knows soon after, and he doesn't seem reactive or nervous, so I'm very glad for that."
dogs,fcth3pe,t3_eilu6d,1577943076.0,"My husband and I were walking our St. Bernard right before Christmas, and there's a yard at the end of our street which is entirely fenced in. Two dogs (I believe a hound mix and a pit mix of some kind) live in that yard and seem to be out ALL the time, barking at everything that goes by. Sometimes they crack boards in the fence trying to get to other dogs, which always made me nervous, but this time one of them made it all the way through and both charged out as we were walking by.

My husband had the leash and had to kick the pit while it kept trying to bite our dog on his back/legs. I ran and alerted the owner at the front door, but it seemed by then my dog had gotten free and ran back down the street to our house.

Our dog got away with only one bite that really broke the skin (thank God for all his fluff), but it was terrifying to me. There were children playing right nearby, I'm just thankful nobody else was injured.

We talked to the neighbors who agreed to pay our vet bill, but we still alerted animal control which I guess already knew those dogs had ""poor living conditions"" (i.e. being left outside all the time). And now we carry mace every time we walk, because we don't want to be caught unprepared like that ever again."

fatlogic,fbyts2a,t3_ef2hkk,1577226120.0,"Somehow I keep giving myself stomach issues, and it's pissing me off. My Christmas break basically started last Monday, and I wake up extremely nauseous and with a mild fever. No idea what caused it, and it went away after a day.

Then yesterday I decided to try a new Korean BBQ place (it was excellent) and ended up nauseous an hour later, and slept off a gross stomach for the rest of the day.

I would love to be able to just enjoy my holiday and the food around me without feeling sick! I don't want to have to start hunting down some kind of food allergy or intolerance if that's what this is.

And to top it all off, I strained my shoulder really badly this morning AND THEN my poor dog got attacked by an aggressive dog down the street that broke through a fence to get to him. (He's okay but it was so scary.) Not a fun day! Let's hope Christmas is better..."
AmItheAsshole,fbbvrls,t3_ecjv1b,1576709237.0,"YTA - She just wanted a little validation of her work from a friend. It didn't seem like she was asking for serious constructive criticism, especially of something that she can't change now that it's finished. And the emojis plus the condescending ""I know you do better than that"" make your response sound really passive aggressive."
