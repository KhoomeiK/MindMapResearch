AmItheAsshole,ff6r2wc,t1_ff6qxvr,1579633108.0,It used to not be like this. The area was staffed and the job was a breeze. Winter/ holidays are the busy time and as we went into the holidays the area started losing people.
AmItheAsshole,ff6pkks,t1_ff6p78c,1579632209.0,That's how I feel. They have been trying to hire another full time with little applicants and it takes time to get trained. So I will leave them pretty effed for a bit...

AmItheAsshole,ff6p98h,t1_ff6ox4j,1579632022.0,"To put it plainly it is because of the overall work load and client issues I have to deal with daily. Out of 5 locations, we had 3 techs between 2 of them. We are over flowing with work and stress and know that a similar company you get paid a decent amount better. I got $1 raise to be the lead and deal directly with issues and running my portion and it was not worth it."

tifu,fem41kc,t3_epr72w,1579239034.0,Smacked is probably an understatement. Probably more like falcon punched. I've woken up from a nightmare punching something and sent a hand through a wall. Luckily it was between the 2 studs because that would have fucking sucked.
GetMotivated,fels7s4,t1_felqti5,1579229640.0,"Man I know exactly how that is. I always had the ""lone wolf"" mentality even though in nature lone wolves either start a new pack or die. I hated getting help from anyone because I knew it almost always came with strings attached but ultimately I knew I'd be better off if I surrounded myself with people I can depend on. You can do it. One step at a time my dude."

GetMotivated,fek3esj,t1_fejpwol,1579191773.0,I have been resisting any type of help from family and even moved just far enough away to make the excuse not to see them. My sister has needed me in a couple of cases and I realized that we had a common goal and can help each other. I am more working off the caption than the cartoon. But family is a rope that is hard to cut so you have to work with what you got.
GetMotivated,fek377g,t1_fek0db9,1579191645.0,"I see what you mean and I definitely tread lightly. My codependency was (and probably the same for your buddy) seeking validation in my ex that I was ""man."" I paid the bills and gave her what she wanted. Luckily realizing before any type of marriage that she was toxic. So I moved to my mom's, became dependent on her for a bit to get back on my feet, then learned how to be completely independent. My mom is one to hold over you the help she has given so this time around I am paying for college and my rent and not taking aid from her. I'm sorry for your buddy hopefully he is on a good path now!"
GetMotivated,fek2olx,t1_fejrqvu,1579191330.0,Computer science. I had started a bachelors about 3 years ago and stopped after about 1.5 years because I thought I wasn't smart enough to keep going. Discrete math kicked my ass.
GetMotivated,fek2kar,t1_fejurk1,1579191257.0,"Yeah like I took it as ""I should stop fighting my family and instead realize my sister and I can help each other reach a common goal."" The caption is also about how you could be doing just fine on your own (i have been for the last year) but sometimes you can do a lot more with a little help."
AskReddit,fejc7cl,t3_epgvju,1579166705.0,The answer to life
AskReddit,fejc38v,t3_epgvsa,1579166530.0,Dwell on the past. It crippled me. But it can't be changed and if I want to fix anything I have to look forward not backward.
GetMotivated,fejbwh2,t3_epgwc1,1579166246.0,"The timing of this is impeccable. For too long I wanted to do everything myself since I broke up with my ex 4 years ago. Housing, college, daily struggles. We shared everything and it made me codependent. Weak. I haven't completed my degree and put it off. My younger sister by 3 years is about to finish her AA then transfer to an undergraduate school. The roommate she was going to live with fell through and I jumped on the opportunity to go to school with her. She said ""we can be broke college students together"" and not going to lie I teared up a bit. It's a plan in progress but I applied to the school and am excited for this future. It seems a lot brighter than the path I was on.

Edit: oh my gosh I got a koala award! That's my first award and imo the best one! Thank you!!!"

AmItheAsshole,fdtl2d7,t3_emv42p,1578718307.0,The biggest bs I see is having to pay maintenance for a vehicle they are clearly saying is not yours. NTA. Maybe try to renegotiate the terms of service because it is very unfair. But most of that stuff is pretty standard when you get your car: driving siblings around within reason and getting it taken away if you get a ticket.
