relationship_advice,ff60oip,t1_ff5ukt9,1579616109.0,"My ex used to do this, just ignore me when I was sick, on my period or upset. I didn’t see it as an issue at the time but now that I’ve moved on I can see how hurtful it was. It’s so isolating and makes you feel like you’ve done something wrong. 

Have a deep think about how these actions make you really feel because they’re basically shunning you for being human which you do not deserve."

You were so considerate with everything you did. Totally NTA"

migraine,ff2ojo9,t3_er44vc,1579516481.0,Stress triggers my migraines so I use meditation during stressful periods. Whether this helps migraines directly I don’t know but it certainly helps my stress and my perception of stressful situations which in turn helps my migraines.
Wavyhair,fekg90h,t1_feka9be,1579199405.0,"I use cantu custard then boucleme gel, let that dry (air for lazy/ beach waves and diffuse for more wavy curls) then when it’s dry you ‘scrunch the crunch’ basically break the gel cast and you won’t look like you’re back in 2001 at a backstreet boys concert 

Loads of US people she the blue LA looks gel which is cheap I believe - that may be a good way to try a gel and see if you like it. It’s also got a cult like status even though it’s cheap. 

I would say give gel a shot and see what it does. Apply it to damp hair. There are loads of methods for applying product - praying hands (open palm one hand on each side of you hair and pulling down), raking (raking fingers through - this usually doesn’t work for wavy hair) or roping (where you clump your hair into ropes and squish the rope of hair then push it against your head to squish again and get more curl- I use this as I find it gives me good definition)"
Wavyhair,fek9yqn,t3_epjth3,1579195679.0," Briogeo Don’t dispair Repair mask is great for dryness and frizz 

Try to avoid sulphates and silicones in shampoo and conditioner - as others said check out the curly girl method. 

If you start using styling products you should also get a good clarifying shampoo - pureology purify is a good option. You can use this every couple of weeks to help with product build up which leads to limp unhappy hair. 

You could try styling with a custard which is light but helps reduce frizz and then if you want more definition a gel? Brands include Boucleme deva curl and bounce girl. 

Don’t worry about it being wavy vs curly everyone’s aim is to reduce frizz and get healthy hair. 

You could also try doing a protein treatment - a cheap option for this is a rice water rinse. YouTube the method but basically if you boil rice keep the water and after shampooing pour it over your hair. Leave it in for 10 mins then rinse out and deep condition. 

Another home option is apple cider vinegar rinse which helps reduce frizz. Google this but it’s basically a mix of apple cider vinegar and water which is used just like the rice water rinse."
migraine,feek11o,t1_fee9rir,1579035318.0,I think I need to start doing this because after 4 hours I just have to take more and I loathe taking them as I have such bad side effects. Admittedly the nasel sprays are better but I just paid 55 euro for 6 shots and literally cried at the cost of it
migraine,feejtab,t1_feddhno,1579035193.0,"That’s super strange!! Good luck getting to the bottom of it, sounds like it might be a case of screaming until someone listens to you"

But honestly thank you that’s actually super useful!!!"
nextfuckinglevel,feej3nv,t1_fee1zop,1579034782.0,Well now I feel even more out of the loop. Gonna start a go fund me to buy the game and catch up
nextfuckinglevel,fedl0bw,t1_fedhbuk,1579014141.0,See these are the kind of social references you miss out on when you only get to watch your cousins play video games!

HumansBeingBros,fdwg0sz,t1_fdvceb7,1578758278.0,"That’s very similar to my aura before a migraine actually! I get all weird and can’t speak properly, it takes me a lot of effort to formulate a sentence. 

Thanks so much for telling me! I feel like I know so little about this"
HumansBeingBros,fdwfhe6,t1_fdw7t2b,1578758187.0,Oh that’s interesting and a little creepy
JUSTNOFAMILY,fdvp835,t1_fdv0fn8,1578749972.0,No one is arguing this point but in this specific instance women looking out for women is what is happening. There are specific experiences that they share which is why this is the point of the statement and sentiment.
HumansBeingBros,fdvo019,t1_fdvirf3,1578749492.0,Thanks so much! I hate being ignorant on something that is relatively common but not really spoken about
fatlogic,fdv783l,t1_fdukwrn,1578744101.0,I love the fact that he makes you recognise that your negative thoughts although valid are also a very mean way of talking about yourself. It’s so easy to be self destructive this sounds like a really healthy partnership!!
HumansBeingBros,fdv61tn,t1_fdskdgo,1578743715.0,"This may be a stupid question but can you tell when a seizure is about to happen (like a migraine aura) or just it just come out of no where? If this does happen I understand this would vary person to person (like migraine auras) but I’m just interested to see if they would have been able to maybe say ‘oh I think I’m about to have a seizure’ 

I’ve seen someone on a train once bundle up their jersey and then she had a seizure so she must have realised something."

relationships,fdl8m6l,t1_fdl80lc,1578518903.0,I totally agree with this possibility. I also think you can be okay with someone but still feel upset. I was the Andy in this situation and I totally respected the other persons feelings but I was hurt and needed my own time to heal

AmItheAsshole,fdkfcda,t1_fdkeo5d,1578502675.0,"I think that’s half the reason people sometimes continue to do and stay dumb stuff, because no one ever really mentions that it’s dumb. Like really offensive jokes for instance, if people don’t laugh suddenly it dawns on them that actually it’s not funny. 

That’s awesome to hear he’s taken the feedback and worked on himself that says a lot about someone! We all do dumb stuff, it’s growing from it that’s important"

fatlogic,fdjs0o6,t1_fdjb50w,1578485364.0,One of my pet peeves of the diet industry is comparing calories in an item to how long it takes to burn off.
ukpolitics,fdhiri0,t1_fdgh81x,1578423516.0,"I think statistics show that millennials drink the least amount in recent history and it’s a bit of a shock to older people I think. 

My parents still can’t wrap their heads around the fact that I only have a drink once every few weeks. Their social lives revolve largely around drinking. I can see that being a big gap to cross for people"
antiMLM,fdhh9e9,t1_fdgt56m,1578422609.0,Also in pyramid schemes the lure is being the top of the pyramid and recruiting down. I don’t need to recruit people to get my pay check and annual leave thanks

migraine,fddkexu,t3_ekrppn,1578315707.0,"Yes! I have glasses for computer use as I get bad eye strain. My vision isn’t bad at all another prescription is tiny but it makes a world of difference to my headaches and concentration span. Anyway I got a blue tint on those and it isn’t a cure but it certainly helps me in office lighting and using a computer. 

But as I said I suffer from strained headaches on top of migraines so maybe it just helps the one?"
migraine,fddjznp,t3_ekta7i,1578315267.0,Mine vary a lot. They range from like 5/10 on a pain scale where I can push through as long as there isn’t a lot of noise these are like 10 a month but they last for 3 days ish. Then every few months I get one where I can’t leave my bed and that can last from 1-3 days. Botox has helped so much with pain management.

fatlogic,fdd7u4e,t1_fdcciqt,1578298716.0,Man I feel you! I have minor hypermobility and over the last 5 years have had to have both my knees fixed so that the patellar won’t dislocate. Strong muscles make all the difference to me too. Walking pain free never gets old
fatlogic,fdd7qkc,t1_fdc66jx,1578298580.0,Finding an activity that you don’t hate is so important! It’s easier on low motivation days to drag yourself their if your only issue is the motivation to leave the house rather than a fear of the activity. So happy for you!!

fatlogic,fc0tm01,t1_fc0f6e6,1577299351.0,"So I went to a doctor worried about it, they did bloods and they suspect my body is still in its teenage phase and may come out soon (I’m only mid-late twenties).

I make sure my bedtime is 9 hours before I wake up so I’m not too exhausted at work. I’m never super tired (like you are when you’re sleep deprived) I just don’t wake up naturally and it takes me a while to fall asleep"
fatlogic,fbzuymp,t1_fbzdvh8,1577262948.0,If I don’t set an alarm I sleep for 12-13 hours naturally so it’s just not practical for me to not have one
