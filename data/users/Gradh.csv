I do not expect or trust that authorities have respect for my rights.  Hyper vigilance is a survival strategy worth considering. 

The reason I sunk my teeth in this posting is because I think the authorities did not do a complete investigation. If you are a shit officer you are handled with different gloves than the everyman."

todayilearned,ffrjed9,t1_ffrf94r,1580159226.0,"First, the DNA should be tested to confirm that the blood evidence found was his. It has been noted that the officers blood was AB. The Rh type was not mentioned. If they had a specimen from the officers blood typing, they can do the DNA analysis on that specimen. 

DNA testing, itself does not require a warrant. Obtaining a sample from a person who refuses, most likely does. 

Evidence is evidence. How evidence is obtained is important.  How it is used is important. 

I suspect that this officer committed many other crimes. There were thirty calls from women that we’re accosted, detained, and creeped upon at the same location.  There are crimes that were not investigated. The investigators and prosecutors were derelict in their duties. 

Do you think the officer was dealt with justly to the fullest extent of the law?"

I’m not sure what saying actually means.  The thousand cases who walked are identical to the one innocent?  To me it is a simple quote that just hints at the issue of truth and justice. 

Would the opposite be considered? There seems to be just such an approach by law enforcement. All contacts are guilty of something.....sometime. All I have to do is investigate......"
todayilearned,ffr46l5,t1_ffr175w,1580150077.0,"He was not just accused, he was convicted. Thirty women had called describing aberrant behavior. The complete investigation for this culprit should have completed.
When charges are assigned to an “Everyman” it is usual for a haystack to be created. This officer appeared to be convicted for a single, first degree murder charge. I suspect the law enforcement and prosecution did not want such a ghoul in uniform to be publicly revealed. Just saying that for some reason, the piling on of charges did not occur.  With great power comes great responsibility,"
todayilearned,ffqzchy,t1_ffqpp3p,1580147033.0,"Is it reasonable to think that the crime for which the officer was convicted was the first and only such attack?  Is it also reasonable to expect that the perpetrator of such a crime should have his DNA analyzed and entered in the database. 

The one and done approach seems sketchy, reckless, lazy. Incompetent, or criminal......I struggle to come up with some benign motivation behind the way this was handled."
