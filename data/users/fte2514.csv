I live next to a Chilli's so it's my go-to when I don't want to cook but want a good meal.

Edit: 
Out of  curiosity I looked up the calories for sides:

Mexican Rice: 160 
Black Beans: 120
Roasted Asparagus: 35
Steamed Broccoli: 40

So, you can knock off a lot of calories by subbing the veggies for the carb sides."

Their chicken with mango and black beans is good too, but I haven't had that since starting Noom.

If you're still in transition and don't want to go full girl mode, ""queer or androgynous cuts"" is a term I've used to find more neutral looks.

In your case you could ask them to make them more feminine and they can show you with their makeup products how to enhance the natural beauty of your brows.

You are at a healthy weight for your height and it sounds like you are doing the right things.

If you belong to a gym with trainers your best bet might be to have a few sessions. They can mix things up for you and make sure you have good for. You probably don't have much fat to lose.

I was your height and weight in college and pretty strong. I definitely didn't need to lose weight. Maybe you will be happier just getting toned. Are you doing any weightlifting? That may keep you at the same weight or a higher one but your clothes will fit different and your body will look smaller.

Good luck with your goals!"
