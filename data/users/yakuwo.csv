gaming,ffbh3bl,t1_ffb9ei9,1579765001.0,Such nostalgia! Armor games - Last Stand was like a headcannon sequel to my plague inc runs. Used to play both in office before they discovered the need for IT surveillance.
trashy,ff9a8em,t1_ff90jwj,1579708384.0,"It isnt as hard as many think. The higher you go in some companies, the more trust, authority and discretion you are often given. You also have a better understanding of the controls put in place to prevent losses, allowing you to circumvent them better and to hide your tracks. Petty theft may still happen because people think they are getting away with it but often it is because management has accepted a certain level of loss in exchange for cheap labour. They may keep the evidence for future cause to fire you or wait till you past certain limits before bringing it to the authorities."

trashy,ff8nqwj,t1_ff8lc1a,1579687812.0,"Unfortunately embezzlement and bribery are things. There are known cases where better understanding of your employees personal finances aids risk mitigation. A company I knew that went into liquidation started its decline with the accountant's love for gambling and expensive women. However I cant imagine this being necessary for anything but the most privileged of positions in an organisation. The guy at the counter? What is the worst that can happen if he has a bad credit rating? There are security cameras on him, the manager breathing down his neck, he has to fill out forms for a paper clip. Hell, the guy is probably motivated to work twice as hard now."
trashy,ff8nh68,t1_ff7x7zi,1579687396.0,"Agree. I drive a 2008 Altis. Paid in cash. No loans. If I'm going to spend or borrow, it isnt going to be on a car. The one item most likely to be destroyed by a stranger for no good reason. I had a young chap at my workplace who put a deposit for a Nissan gtr using his first bonus. Incurred crazy interest. Totalled the car within the year."

todayilearned,femeikm,t1_felt5wf,1579251344.0,"Yes I was totally agreeing with you, was just adding on to the 1 in 6. I didn't like the idea of people thinking that singaporeans were really all that rich when in truth it is a much smaller group of elites. Also I think being not corrupt comes from more than being well paid. The Saudis are well paid but can be very open to unethical practices."
todayilearned,felidrc,t1_felgkke,1579222897.0,"Yes affordable essentials are one of the wonderful things about Singapore. for the rest, I'm pretty mixed. I first went to Singapore in the 80s. A terraced house was about 100k. I have doubts there are any public housing that is of that price now. Last I heard it's like 200k for a decent sized apartment. I dont even want to talk about what the private condominiums cost in the ads targeted at foreigners."
todayilearned,felg31t,t1_felcubl,1579221347.0,"I would like to correct this from my personal experience - they have quite a number of millionaires and billionaires but the 1 in 6 is a gross overstatement. Homes were included in this calculations which are illiquid assets. Cost of living is also high except for essentials. The cost of a car in Singapore is about 100k base when new (blew my mind being american). Organs are also heavily regulated to avoid any black market (experience from investing in a research lab there). Instead, connections probably help more than cash. People with enough money but lack connections probably head overseas to get their organs where regulations arent so strong. Still what you say isn't wrong, most people have a price. But bribing the least corrupt country in the world is going to be quite an effort. Easier to just find somewhere else."
facepalm,fejd2jd,t1_feiq399,1579168022.0,"Machine learning has helped make the smart people smarter, dumb people dumber. It was impossible to find info on flat earth from my local library in the past. Maybe except the children fiction section."
manga,fecclam,t1_fec6d9g,1578970781.0,"Author has had health issues throughout the series. The drawing, frequency and quality of manhwa seems to take a toll on Korean artists quite often. There were some issues he mentioned and he used provide some indication that he is planning a hiatus. Except this round, the series suddenly stopped with no news until Lezhin provided a cryptic note. The sense is that he had a major health scare and was probably hospitalised."
SelfAwarewolves,fe6rc4o,t1_fe5ryz1,1578901735.0,"Well, you still have to be a decent shot. 20 odd rounds to the back with another 30 surrounding the victim isnt going to support your story. Especially if he or she dies in a prayer position."

assholedesign,fdp5spc,t1_fdo3u55,1578620667.0,"I went from bar to liquid soaps, because of the mess. One bar of hotel soap I brought home years back has successfully assimilated with the remains of all the other soaps. Wife didn't like that."

PoliticalDiscussion,fdm8azi,t1_fdm6giu,1578542284.0,"Globalisation is responsible for that with the post cold war boom but technically the true beneficiaries have been western nations (being winners of the war) and their trade partners while everyone else is still catching up (also shootout to Europe's very sneaky destablisation of key powerhouses in Middle East, south Asia, and Africa in the early 1900s). For example, Central Asia is like 20 years behind culturally and technologically. The world has also been waging wars in ME for a good part of the past 2 decades.  I'm not being an apologist and I appreciate the harsh reality that our dominance has given some true benefits to us and our children but we definitely should be aware that US and Europe current dilemma with foreign intervention in politics and constant unhappiness/threats/attacks from other countries comes straight out of both our past playbooks (read: CIA) and past actions. I mean we supported some crazy ass dictators around the world while promoting freedom at home. The 2003 Iraq war was based off false premises and both sides of our government supported it. We gave weapons to Iran to help Contra. However (and fortunately), most people angry with us cant really do much since we outgun them (militarily, culturally, economically and technologically) beyond their wildest dreams."
PoliticalDiscussion,fdm5w0y,t1_fdjpw7c,1578540557.0,"Well, i would say probably look beyond the middle east and the past few years. Over the decades, I've seen enough news about Terrorists, revolutionary groups, actual governments, etc coming from places in South America, central Asia, Africa, even South East Asia. Trying to be the world police attracts alot of attention and unhappiness. We make new ones periodically. Only the more dramatic ones really make it to the front page. You can check out the wiki on attacks on US diplomatic facilities. Pretty interesting."

PoliticalDiscussion,fdjpeir,t1_fdjmyf2,1578482139.0,I mean we have been pretty consistent about killing the leaders of our enemies for a while. But we just have so many enemies.
PoliticalDiscussion,fdjml9e,t1_fdjj5rv,1578478171.0,It wasn't the same general doing that to all our embassies. This is just one villain from our gallery of enemies. Pretty sure we killed alot of the others but in less flashy ways. I dont have an opinion on whether it was an appropriate response to kill the guy but pretty surprised by how we did it.
PoliticalDiscussion,fdjhn0q,t1_fdjh0ep,1578471222.0,"I argue its cos our embassies have been bomb and bullet magnets for decades. Droning an actual general in a foreign civilian airport (not cave or lonely freeway) is pretty new and unexpected when everyone was focussing on koalas burning. Also I think people are worried everyone in this conflict is not going to be the ""better man"" and stand down."

IdiotsInCars,fcjnq4i,t1_fcihf8m,1577695570.0,I recommend making sure it functions even though it looks fine. Dont just plug it in and pray it works when an accident happens. Make sure to test and check it out frequently. I had the pleasure of the recording screwing up when an accident happened.

todayilearned,fbzsksf,t1_fbzjvyr,1577259321.0,I bought a small cheap wooden rake from daiso in Japan. I use it to scratch my back and legs. It is the most satisfying scratcher I've ever had.
unpopularopinion,fbqs7ci,t1_fbpwuyr,1577035029.0,"I can never appreciate a locals perspective, but I still find Singapore quite a good model. Tolerance is one of the hardest things to instill. Hopefully Singapore will become truly colour blind but considering the state of the rest of the world, you arent in a bad place. I've seen lynchings, shootings, stabbing and beheadings in my travels in the name of race, caste, tribe and religion. and there are many worse situations you can be in. Hell, an Indian convenience store owner was killed near my hometown a couple years back over race. (This is America, so guns were involved.) Either way, thanks for sharing an additional perspective of Singapore."
