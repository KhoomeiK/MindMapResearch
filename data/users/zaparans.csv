Economics,feig5pg,t1_feiekeu,1579137756.0,"This is a good comment. I understand all your positions. I understand your case for protectionism protecting fledgling industries. 

Our disagreement seems to be what the catalyst was. You think the protectionism was key and the driver of their ability to develop and I say the key was them opening up their markets to at least exports and their business friendly environment. 

For what it’s worth s Korea seems to have made good bets on industries to build up. They could have gone all in on textiles but they got lucky. Govts bet on things all the time and lose but if they do bet and invest in industries that take off it can work. In most cases govts is not responsive enough compared to private industry and result is poor management of capital. China is a great example of this. They tried to make everything but govt measured productivity by weight. When I was there in 1984 everyone took their windshield wipers off their cars because they couldn’t be replaced. The govt owned car companies hit their metrics making heavy things.   S Korea wasn’t as heavy handed and made better bets but the protectionism wasn’t the reason for success. 

Sorry for being a dick to you earlier. For the first half of our conversation I thought you were the original person I responded who said hurr durr globalism is bad. It’s been a good and insightful conversation."

sales,feidzu0,t3_ep7n8x,1579136299.0,I’m going to jump on the bandwagon with you. I’ve found cold calling to be a complete waste of time compared to other strategies. In previous work in SAAS and a security software I did all the cold calling off trash purchased lists and crap marketing leads when they came in. It was an utter waste of time. In both cases I was able to find emails or connect on linked in with people I knew at least played a role in the services I offered asa champion or decision maker and blast out short linked in messages or emails if I could find them. I could do this very quickly and the positive responses got a call back. It was far more productive. I have my own company now and my sales people do not waste time cold calling. I’m sure this varies by industry somewhat but any dude who is going to take a cold call and buy your product is going to check an email or linked in message related to that product or service or need and you can focus your time on real prospects rather than hoping to catch a needle in a haystack
Economics,fei932t,t1_fei7gyx,1579133021.0,"I pulled up his work earlier. I’m familiar with his arguments. Industries all over the world grow and develop without protectionism all the time. Korea was smart to open up and get exporting. It gave huge opportunities for entrepreneurs to start bringing money into the country hand over fist. The govt got lucky and made some decent bets on investments in industry which is pretty considering most govt investments in industry fails miserably though they did try and keep at arms reach as they also fostered an incredible business environment with few burdens and regulations allowing them to capture their gains from opening the economy to the world. 

They went from not importing or exporting anything to exporting everything and importing little and boomed and as they open their imports they boomed more. As they embraced free trade and cast off protectionism they grew more and more."

Tariffs against China are because trump thinks trade is losing and that trade deficits matter.

It’s certainly better if other countries freely trade but punching ourselves in the dick because other countries punch themselves in the dick is beyond retarded.

If you want to sanction countries for bad behavior go ahead. It’s never economically in our best interest which is what the anti globalist anti free trade types are pushing as the message. 

Yes China has internment camps with slave labor and it’s terrible. I assumed you meant foxcon or something like that. If you want to be punitive to China to try and force changes here then go ahead. That’s not what we are doing. We don’t even give a damn about these camps. It’s being sold as an economic policy to help the US and that is a lie. 

The tariffs have been completely ineffective in every way and are the dumbest way to seek these changes. We should be finding better partners but the reality is the entire protectionist movement doesn’t give a fuck what is going on overseas. They simply hate trade.

This is besides the fact that they were agrarian mud farmers before the sixties. Yes, the govt propped up and subsidized some industries and engaged in a fair amount of protectionism but the bar is pretty low to beat mid farming. Even efficient govts subsidized and protected economies can show growth when your whole country is poor as hell and you don’t produce anything. It’s the same story as China. Over this time they also have created one of the most business friendly environments in the world. It’s one of the easiest places on earth to start a business.

It’s part of the path to development. Europe and the US had low wages too while we developed. You can’t just snap your fingers and create a developed countries wages. Punishing them for not doing the impossible just hurts the poor in China. 

It’s up to US businesses, not govt, to decide if they want to source from China with their IP issues and ownership issues. The US should expand free trade agreements to give business alternatives to China rather than trying to tax us until we do what our communist president wants.
