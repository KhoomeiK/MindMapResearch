> I used to masturbate onto birds at a local park. Not a thing that I'm particularly proud of but I became quite good at it. I was taking zinc supplements so I was shooting massive loads and it became something of a sport to me. For anyone interested here is your best strategy. first, you need to find an isolated spot so you don't become a sex offender. I found a short kind of channel area where I saw the pigeons would congregate. Next, you arouse yourself. I was usually content with envisioning the occasional jogging lady coming over and taking a shit on my chest and that was enough to fuel the fire but if you're not as sexually charged as me just take some porn on the go. After you're good an horny, you get some bread. My pigeons preferred white bread but healthier birds might have a taste for honey wheat or maybe even multigrain. Fat, unhealthy birds are slower and easier to hit so remember that. Once you are seated on the bench and ready to do the deed, whip your roosevelt out and scatter bread out within a few feet of you. use your judgement based on how far you know you can cum. I was a lonely and depraved soul who could hit targets the size of a thimble at distances up to 4 feet. You wait for the pigeons to begin eating and to get comfortable with your presence. At this point, you want to coo gently and talk sensually to them to gain their trust. Now you're finally ready to cum on your bird. This is a tough part because the rapid motion of masturbation is very frightening to the birds, so you have to be subtle. Once you master a technique, you simply wind it up and let it go, aiming depending on your past cumming experiences. I always came high so I would aim for the neck of the bird and catch it right in the face. It's an extremely satisfying and erotic feeling, seeing those birds reel around covered in cum and maybe even transporting it to other places in the city. Either way I haven't done it in years but every now and then I catch myself gazing wistfully at a flock of birds, cock throbbing and waiting for them to land close to me."

Back in the early days of the inter web they used to load quicker than video, but that’s irrelevant nowadays. Even gif sites know it. They provided the option of gifs with sound. But they’re just video files disguised under a file type that makes people think they’re gifs. If the people running gif know it’s inferior, it is. They have to fool people to think they’re still cool giffers when they’re consuming the superior video formats.

It’s not the re-used content that annoys me (even if you spent 24/7 on reddit you’d miss great stuff so cross or re posts aren’t the devil), it’s that there’s clearly an effort to build tons of accounts with karma based purely on recycling content, and I wouldn’t doubt there’s some manipulation getting it to r/all considering its prevalence.

NatureIsFuckingLit,ffd7umr,t1_ffd100v,1579815115.0,"Hereâ€™s the text description of the sub they posted;   

> I used to masturbate onto birds at a local park. Not a thing that I'm particularly proud of but I became quite good at it. I was taking zinc supplements so I was shooting massive loads and it became something of a sport to me. For anyone interested here is your best strategy. first, you need to find an isolated spot so you don't become a sex offender. I found a short kind of channel area where I saw the pigeons would congregate. Next, you arouse yourself. I was usually content with envisioning the occasional jogging lady coming over and taking a shit on my chest and that was enough to fuel the fire but if you're not as sexually charged as me just take some porn on the go. After you're good an horny, you get some bread. My pigeons preferred white bread but healthier birds might have a taste for honey wheat or maybe even multigrain. Fat, unhealthy birds are slower and easier to hit so remember that. Once you are seated on the bench and ready to do the deed, whip your roosevelt out and scatter bread out within a few feet of you. use your judgement based on how far you know you can cum. I was a lonely and depraved soul who could hit targets the size of a thimble at distances up to 4 feet. You wait for the pigeons to begin eating and to get comfortable with your presence. At this point, you want to coo gently and talk sensually to them to gain their trust. Now you're finally ready to cum on your bird. This is a tough part because the rapid motion of masturbation is very frightening to the birds, so you have to be subtle. Once you master a technique, you simply wind it up and let it go, aiming depending on your past cumming experiences. I always came high so I would aim for the neck of the bird and catch it right in the face. It's an extremely satisfying and erotic feeling, seeing those birds reel around covered in cum and maybe even transporting it to other places in the city. Either way I haven't done it in years but every now and then I catch myself gazing wistfully at a flock of birds, cock throbbing and waiting for them to land close to me."

funny,fdd0fvo,t1_fdczrkb,1578289926.0,"Yeah calling dating adults â€˜groomingâ€™ is stupid and offensive to victims of actual grooming. A lot of people might find the age difference seedy, but you canâ€™t possibly think itâ€™s ok to group dating younger women with grooming."
nba,fd91vdo,t1_fd8smkz,1578227038.0,"Mourning wouldnâ€™t be there. He was part of the trade for Vince. I brought him up just pointing out that he knew how terrible the organisation was so he didnâ€™t even turn up after the trade. But if the organisation was decent theyâ€™d have been able bosh and vc, which is a potent duo. They had some other good role players and itâ€™s easy to attract others with that talent leading the way."
nba,fd7o9al,t1_fd74eec,1578207526.0,"Alonzo Mourning, acquired in the trade, straight up refused to even turn up. Shame. Bosh was just rising and Vince was going into his peak. If the organisation was decent enough to keep that together theyâ€™d have been scary."

mildlyinteresting,fciiqa1,t1_fcigv4n,1577663218.0,"The power and expansion and greed were traits he already had before Tuco and Gus were killed. And being motivated by control was always in his DNA from when they very first started cooking, connecting that to Hank is silly. Iâ€™m also pretty sure heâ€™d drunk scotch numerous times with Hank long before he killed Mike too.   

The whole article is a huge stretch at best."
oddlysatisfying,fcf1ffr,t1_fcf0do5,1577625704.0,Keep trying bro. After what Iâ€™ve described youâ€™re still going to hang your hat on what Iâ€™ve said being equivalent to a blended â€œhomogeneous pulpâ€. Itâ€™s fun watching people try to dig themselves out of tragic failure by using minor differences in interpretations.
oddlysatisfying,fcev5o7,t1_fceo1k6,1577624032.0,"Yeah, thatâ€™s not how it works. Not even slightly close. The sauce clings to the pasta better. You get a hint of the sauce flavour in the pasta itself. The salted water you boil it in gives the pasta some extra flavour. The different textures of the al dente pasta and the sauce, be it thick or thin, meat, cream, tomato, egg, etc, etc, etc, etc all make for a great dish. If you think blending a sauce and pasta makes what I described Iâ€™m pretty sure Iâ€™d never eat food you served."

oddlysatisfying,fcd9rur,t1_fcczckx,1577608005.0,"Oil coats the pasta and prevents the sauce soaking in. You should undercook the pasta, finish it in the sauce (obviously this doesnâ€™t work for every pasta dish) then give it a quick drizzle of extra virgin."
oddlysatisfying,fccxlwn,t1_fccs2kz,1577603871.0,"Someone else replying to the same comment I replied to also mentioned pasta and Ramsayâ€™s method. Check the other replies to the parent of my comment. They replied before me.     

I read that, then hit reply to the parent comment when it wouldâ€™ve been more appropriate to reply to the pasta comment or add my point about Ramsay first instead of last, then used the pasta example."

oddlysatisfying,fccjzo8,t1_fcciyfk,1577599269.0,"Someone replying to the comment I also replied to was talking pasta and Ramsayâ€™s suggestion. I jumped in as well with a similar explanation, but my point was - just because Ramsay said it doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s irrefutable."
oddlysatisfying,fccfvwq,t1_fcc7l2o,1577597922.0,"Oil and water donâ€™t mix anyway, oil sits at the top, and the raw pasta drops to the bottom. You just make sure the water is boiling vigorously before you drop the pasta then give it a good stir and it doesnâ€™t stick. If you donâ€™t do that but do add oil itâ€™ll still stick. You need to follow those steps even with oil, itâ€™s just a silly old myth.   

He has many old wives tales in cooking that make no difference and have been disproved scientifically. Theyâ€™re just things heâ€™s been taught so he sticks with it. His techniques are brilliant and heâ€™s a incredible chef, Iâ€™m just saying not everything he says is irrefutable."
