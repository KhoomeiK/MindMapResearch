>showing the bad side of a good person

Except the Joker isn’t a good person. Good people don’t murder other people, on live tv or off it. They don’t, as a general rule, premeditate murder - that‘s a pretty big one. If you find yourself premeditating a murder, this is a sign that - by any reasonable standard of measure - you are a bad person. I’d accept that there are exceptions to this, edge cases and so forth, but the scenario put forth in Joker isn’t one of them. I appreciate you trying to bring Jungian analysis to bear here, but you’re either fundamentally misunderstanding it, or you’ve misunderstood the movie. I’d wager the former.

To be fair, I’m going to flip this around to a couple words that really push my buttons: SJW and White Knight. Now, on the whole, my instinct is to disregard the opinion of people who use these terms. I think their usage is generally indicative of a cynical mindset. *That said*, I have to admit that there are edge cases where the literal interpretation of those terms is probably correct.   

I think in the middle of these extremes -  ‘SJW/White Knight’ and ‘Edgelord/Incel’ - is a wide spectrum of folk to whom the terms do not apply, and these tend to bristle and take umbrage at their use.

Phoenix killed it in the role, but besides that the movie was pretty paint by numbers, with some shoe-horned in Thomas Wayne shit, a romance side-plot/plot twist you could see coming a mile away (that they still spelled out for you just to make sure the dumbest viewers didn’t walk away confused), and some truly baffling in-universe stuff that took me out of the movie (like Joker becoming a people’s champion). Seriously, nobody is going to celebrate someone for murdering someone on live tv. Or, if they did, then Ras Al Ghul was right and Gotham is beyond saving. 

The movie has no subtlety, and it’s claims to craft (outside of the lead performance) were all done better by Taxi Driver, the better movie this movie desperately wants to be. Every incel-edgelord I’ve ever talked to really felt represented though, so there’s that."

FragileWhiteRedditor,fe6jtwc,t1_fe6cnvn,1578893235.0,"It’s true, if I was a POC with any experience of microaggressions I would be able to make my point far more eloquently, but since I labor at a disadvantage in this department I’m gonna stumble and muddle my way through this thing and hopefully you’ll bear with me. 

First off, because credentials matter, I am a light-skinned Métis whose Native grandfather was among the many who were sent to Residential Schools. Like many aboriginal families, ours bears numerous generational scars of what he went through; alcoholism, abuse, teen pregnancy, foster homes, more abuse, bad education and poverty. So while the skin I was born into and it’s light-colouring has afforded me numerous privileges - in dealing with police officers and seeing people who looked like me represented in media, for example - I have experience with the long arm of racism in many of its subtler and more insidious forms. 

And no, I’m not talking about casual racism or microaggressions. I’m leery of these terms not because I don’t believe they’re not real or don’t exist, but because - unlike much of what we see posted in this sub - they’re far more subject to personal interpretation, cognitive bias and subjective experience. I know I know, that sounds like a fancy way of saying I don’t believe they exist, but what I’m saying is that it’s a lot more complicated than overt racism, or institutional racism, which are large enough to be seen from space and theoretically easier to oppose. 

But I’ve gotten way off topic here. It just felt like you were being dismissive in your reply, and I think that this situation has more nuance than you’re giving it. 

The situation, as I understand it, is: (brown) guy goes to party. Stares at (white) girl long enough to track who she talks to and gauge her relative enthusiasm, when his turn comes in the conversational circle he deems her enthusiasm to be objectively less than with white partners. He assumes it is because his race, and later accuses her of being racist. 

Now, even assuming his assumptions were correct (which is a stretch but I’m willing to grant it for the sake of argument), I still think he dealt with it in an assholish way. I think loudly accusing others of racism -without any sort of privileged view of their thoughts and opinions, and in the absence of tangible evidence of said racism - is a bad look, and a self-defeating strategy that alienates people. People who one, presumably, wishes to participate in a fair and equitable society with. Well, congratulations, now they think you’re an asshole. 

This is way too long for an internet argument where people talk past each other, but just one more thing: this is a situation where you can look at it through race lenses and see one thing, and look at it through feminist lenses and see just the opposite. Not to echo many of the so-called fragile comments that OP was calling out, but women do not owe men their time, or their enthusiasm, or their conversation. Full stop. 

Have a good night, and I apologize if this comes across as tone deaf. I just want peace, and better tomorrow, same as you."
FragileWhiteRedditor,fe69flu,t3_enpaol,1578884719.0,"Man I hate to say it but that guy was kind of an asshole. 

Like, racism is totally a thing. And it’s cancerous and it’s pervasive, you’ll get no argument from me. But cognitive bias is also a thing. Whether or not this girl was *actually* racist we will never know and can never know. But by defaulting to that assumption, dude came off as an asshole. 

There are a lot of examples of racism, in this sub, on this platform, in the world at large. But being snubbed by a girl at a party... I just don’t see it."
FragileWhiteRedditor,fe67pa2,t1_fe66ylr,1578883636.0,"I was prepared to boycott it out of respect for Moore and my love of the graphic novel, but the reviews got the better of my curiosity and I’m glad."
FragileWhiteRedditor,fe65vv1,t1_fe64ico,1578882489.0,"Gibbons designed at least one of the characters for the show. And yeah, I’m definitely sympathetic to Alan Moore (who is a fucking genius) and was prepared to dismiss this right along with the other shameless cash grabs - Before Watchmen and Doomsday Clock - which were built upon the legacy of Watchmen but disrespected the source material with their very existence. 

But somehow, the tv show is different. And maybe I’m just pulling flimsy justifications out of my ass so I can enjoy the things I want to enjoy. That said, it absolutely is a work of art in its own right, with its own story to tell, amazing writing, character designs, music and cinematography. No spoilers but episode 5 was one of the best things I ever saw in my *life* and, for me, the best tv of 2019. 

I respect the respect you’re showing, and I wish you all the best as an artist. But I think you should give it a shot. It is a worthy inclusion to the Watchmen mythos. That said, fuck DC (fuck Marvel while we’re at it, comic book companies were little better than slave plantations back in the day). Fortunately, Alan Moore is doing pretty well for himself."
