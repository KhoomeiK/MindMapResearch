I don't love him personally. I love his work. His music, his comedy specials and his movie. I don't care about him because I don't know him. If he died, I'd be sad, because I wouldn't have any more art to consume from him. But all that is too long to write, so I simply say I love him, because I do love what he gives me, so I guess that covers it.

iamatotalpieceofshit,fg0sdpf,t1_fg0pa97,1580414081.0,"I don't want to make pedophilia sound like an unimportant issue. Quite the opposite. I don't think pedophilia is actually considered a huge issue, when it should be. And yeah, you're right, it's not a fetish, or just a fetish, it's definitely a mental illness.

Maybe pedophiles should be reported to authorities. Put on a list, have the police or the feds keep an eye on them. But it should be discreet. It shouldn't come with any consequences for the pedophiles, because if seeking help gives you consequences, no one would actually seek help. And that is pretty much what is happening right now. I do think that if pedophiles felt safe about seeking help for the condition, more would do so.

It's kind of like having violent tendencies. You are a potential danger to others, but you are not actually guilty of anything. And unless you've gotten into fights before, you should absolutely be free to seek help to become less of a potential danger to society. Imagine people with violent tendencies being afraid of getting professional help. There is no cure they can get to be free of their tendencies to harm people, they can't get help, so what are they to do, other than hide their uncontrollable urges from everyone?

Horrible example, I know. I probably made a mess of it, and offended people who have anger issues. I'm just trying to say that pedophiles are people who have potentially destructive urges, and they are too afraid to speak to anyone about it, even those who's job is to offer help to people like them. You said pedophilia is a mental illness or disease, and I agree with that. How are we supposed to try to cure this disease without opening up to those who have it?

And the fear pedophiles have is not for crimes they have committed, but for things they MAY do if they DON'T get help. But if they can't get help, how are they to be free of the danger they may cause? You see how it's all a loop?

I would rather protect children over pedophiles as well. But the way I see it, pedophiles are sick people who need help, and if they don't get that help, they might cause harm. I think we should try to cure them, or make sure the symptoms of the disease never show up (symptoms as in, consuming child porn, or molesting children). But because there is no cure yet, the only solution we have is to lock them up, to keep society safe from them.

What I'm saying is, we have to look for the cure. We have to find ways to make pedophiles functioning members of society, happy, AND harmless. Those people are sick, and they deserve help. Prison is supposed to rehabilitate people, but this is not its function, and pedophiles are a good example of that. No child molester has gotten rid of their urges because of prison. We should find other ways to help these people.

And, obviously, what I say here goes to those who suffer from pedophilia and have not given in to their urges. Child molesters, rapists and consumers of child porn are criminals and should be punished."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fg0mglr,t1_fg0ktud,1580410744.0,"1 is unforgivable.

I am by no means an expert, never studied the topic in university or anything, but I've taken several deep dives online, watched documentaries first, then got to obscure chat rooms and talked with pedophiles. It's not an orientation, most of them can be attracted to adults and can maintain actual relationships with adults. It's a fetish. 

Society does not help these people, and that's a fact. Pedophiles are afraid to speak to an expert about this, because they think they'll be reported as a potential danger to society. So they hold it in. And some of them begin making excuses, and start sliding into a dangerous state of mind.

There are many points to be made. Society has failed pedophiles by condemning everyone that has this condition. To be honest, even looking at child porn is absolutely morally vile (not to mention a literal crime), let alone possession, let alone actually molesting a child/minor. But there are people that are pedophiles and that actively fight their urges, and some of them managed to find ways to push it in the back of their mind and effectively ignore it for the most part. So far there is no ""cure"", I mean, we don't even know the causes yet.

My opinion is, pedophiles absolutely need help, and they are not getting it. Being a pedophile is not ""wrong"" (morally speaking, obviously there is something wrong with it). Molesting children or helping the child porn industry by consuming child porn is. It is a dangerous topic, but it shouldn't be. We have to talk about it more if there's any chance of fixing this problem."

Also, don't worry about the wall. I do think there is some truth to it, but it's extremely exaggerated. Also, any sane man would rather be with a 40ish year old woman who has her shit together, than a 25ish year old who is still trying to find herself.

Also, if you go to hardcore red pill communities, or whiny MGTOW safe spaces, you will obviously find no love or sympathy for women. What's next? Saying that all men share incel ideologies? Men are literally billions. Those communities are extremely toxic, but they don't represent an entire gender.
