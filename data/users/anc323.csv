Mommit,ffc1hmx,t3_esmx9b,1579789149.0,"Yay!! I totally understand what you are feeling. My husband and I are in the process of buying a house, but first he has to get a new job title at his work. He’s been being considered for a couple of months now, and we are getting hopeful that it comes very soon!! Once we get settled in our house, we want to start trying for baby #2. Our firstborn is 19 months. My fingers are crossed for you and your husband!!"
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffb2egj,t1_ffb070n,1579750073.0,"Just wanted to say I disagree. If she lied and said she was on the pill when she wasn’t, that’s really deceitful and would, in a sense, be trapping him. That being said, I don’t think that’s the case in this situation....of course, I guess we don’t really know!"

TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ff9hu5u,t3_es6qu6,1579713334.0,My kid looks nothing like me OR my husband. I think trying to figure out who the father of a child is based on looks is a bit silly - this girl really needs to get a DNA test!
AskReddit,ff923en,t1_ff8qqwg,1579702939.0,"I used to be that way too when I first started smoking. Give him some lenience - he will stop talking about it so much shortly, once he’s gotten used to how incredible it is."

breakingmom,ff33tsy,t3_er5q2u,1579532977.0,"Hey, I think we all feel this way. I think society hypes up this thing with moms, like we should know everything and have all this patience and basically be superhuman, so we go into motherhood with false expectations. Being a parent is HARD but that’s how you know you’re doing it right and you’re cut out for it. You could be an absent parent, a parent who lounges around all day or goes out and parties and doesn’t feel that burnout or sense of failure because they aren’t trying, they aren’t working hard for their kids. You are which is why you feel this way. What keeps me going is thinking about the future. What it will be like when my kids are older and able to take care of themselves more, what it will be like when I finally have consistent time to myself and become me again. Hang in there!!"

AmazonFC,fespqfr,t1_fesig8w,1579367722.0,"Sure, the less points the better (maybe? Some FCs seem to have random ways of deciding who to convert), but your wording implied that anything over 3 points would disqualify him from conversion. So I just wanted to point out that isn’t necessarily the case everywhere. No need to get defensive, man, I wasn’t trying to attack you or be rude!"
bulletjournal,fes8cp7,t3_eqdm42,1579362481.0,"I have a self improvement list, too! Care to share what is on yours? My list is very small at the moment (drinking more water, stretching every morning/night, meditation, yoga) and I could use ideas!"

breakingmom,fene0zv,t3_epwoya,1579282674.0,"Try to forgive her for her ignorance - she has no idea what it takes. 

I was one of those people who felt that moms who didn’t breastfeed were selfish/lazy. Then, my son was born and I realized how much of a nightmare breastfeeding is. After just 3 tries, my nipples were so cracked and sore and my son was HUNGRY. Add that on top of just trying to figure out being a mom and keeping this little baby happy and alive and it was just too much for me. It made me feel guilty for so long, but I didn’t even breastfeed for a full 48 hours before we switched to exclusively formula. 

The fact that you made it 11 months is INCREDIBLE and you have my respect!! Your sister has no idea what she is talking about and you should feel so proud of yourself. Formula is fine. Your baby is healthy and happy and fed and that is all that matters!"
breakingmom,fehwkat,t3_ep2xzx,1579125291.0,"I always tell people that I have no idea what I was expecting with becoming a mom, but it wasn’t what I got! I don’t think anyone can be fully prepared for the exhaustion, the sacrifices, all of it. We know that parents deal with these things, but until we experience it ourselves, we have no idea how hard it actually is.

Every single day I think “wow, I’m so lucky to have this kid and be a mama” and every single day I also think “wow, why did I decide to become a mom? I HATE it.” Motherhood is really strange. 

Thank you for posting this, I think we could all use a reminder that we aren’t alone and every single mother out there has felt regret with having kids, even if it wasn’t “real” regret and was just in the moment."

breakingmom,fedjega,t3_eognk7,1579013031.0,"I added up all the hours I spent doing various things caring for our son and household and I was working 2.5x as many hours as he was, and he was still getting 8 hours of sleep while I got 3. That still didn’t help. 

You know what I think does help? Leaving the kids and household for a week and letting your SO handle it (and let’s be honest, what needs to be done in a week is just a fraction of what we do.) I still haven’t been brave enough to try it because I am sure that things would be totally messed up when I got home, I don’t think my husband could handle just taking care of our 18 month old properly, much less handling bills and appointments and everything else we do. 

I’ve rambled, but point is: take some time out of the house if you can. At the very least you will get some reset time, and maybe your SO will see firsthand what you do every day and will understand better."
AmazonFC,fedj0sb,t3_eokp2z,1579012764.0,"Something similar happened to my husband last week, and again the week before that. Just go talk to HR, they will remove it for you no problem.

Edit: it’s probably just a system error, you didn’t do anything wrong!"
