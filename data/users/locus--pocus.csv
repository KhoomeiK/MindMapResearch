bipolar,fepifpv,t3_eqbi9l,1579321315.0,"yo that's nice but if ur talking lamotrigine and the rash isn't bad just try sticking it thru, it's the only thing that's worked for me as well. and i also had a nasty rash for a few weeks but it's starting to fade"
bipolar,fephywp,t3_eq8m9m,1579320976.0,no im leaving my beverages and takeout until they form mold colonies and a hundred ants invade & i unsuccessfully try to get them to leave thank you very much
bipolar,felo68h,t3_enm3nl,1579226865.0,"i get vivid nightmares but then i wake up and can't remember i had them. i actually i had a fucking awful one this morning and finally put two and two together - that's what causes me to wake up feeling like i'm dying (usually i get a good 30 seconds before the anxiety/irritability/paranoia kicks in). 

in any case, klonopin helps a lot. other benzos probably will too, but there's something about the way klonopin kicks in quickly (hold it under your tongue) that allows me to calm down. my quality of sleep still sucks though ha"
bipolar,fef1l1s,t1_fcxw1i2,1579046023.0,"hahah i feel this on a spiritual level, also scary because once it gets bad enough it gives me the capacity and intent to do things i shouldn't do (like die)"
bipolar,fef12dg,t3_eb3va6,1579045676.0,yooo i lived in a co-op in college with thirty other kids and would deep clean the kitchen every few months at 4 am and while everyone appreciated it i also think it kind of freaked them out lol
bipolar,feey1z2,t3_eoqgro,1579043718.0,"hey, what a cool question. i used to build houses in the sims 2 all the time, but only after i'd spent forever idly thinking about a backstory for random characters i came up with. 

i used to work at a cafe with a really great setup and making lattes/drinks for folks is definitely up there. i wasn't medicated for bipolar specifically until this year (so yeah, very recently) but that was the one thing that stabilized me, or felt like it did."
dxm,f6rtq45,t1_f3oxdyk,1573119074.0,"good point on the benzos, thanks dude! for what its worth most of these are just legal substances haha, my plug moved and i haven't been able to find anyone reliable so ive just been makin do with these"
