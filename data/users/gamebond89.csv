BestOfLiveleak,fe4wspp,t1_fe4oqdn,1578863494.0,"I agree... but someone had to do it.. listen man i am no comfortable in watching such brutality and this is the most brutal video I've ever seen yet. I saw the comments where people said they butchered his arm and stopped the video when someone threw a rock at that monster's head. But sometime you have to become the monster to eradicate the monster... Our strict law and jury couldn't stop such acts like rape, acid throwing on person's face. I know this is wrong but fear is coming... They weren't stopping someone had to do something about it. All you've heard that he raped this 13 yo girl what do you think if he had raped someone else too or was gonna... Poor girl gotta live and suffer throughout that for something she didn't even do and that guy however faced brutality dies with no remembrance of his deeds.."

BestOfLiveleak,fe4fk1o,t1_fe4b1lh,1578858724.0,"Do you even know how many women are being raped in India? Even with all these strict laws those fucking men dare to rape them burn them throw acid at them cutting their every limb after ending up killing them? Yes i am a person from India and i know how are things here not only here think about the whole world how many people are suffering. Not only women but men are also being raped and mutilated... After all these years they aren't stopping and we've been living in constant fear women are afraid to go outside alone in night wear the dress they want to, travel to places they want to. Not only that they aren't even safe coming from schools , colleges and work places. It's time to create the fear. Sometimes it takes a monster to eradicate the monster for greater good all you see here is him being tortured with brutality and harsh side of human but for a reason. In the end he's just dead with no remembrance of his wrong deeds. While that girl would be traumatized for her whole life for the mistake she never did...It's okay i agree with these brutality looks inhuman but to me it's fair honestly if i would have been there i would have crushed his balls and slashed his dick off and let him live his whole life. Suffering for his deeds.. It's not that you are wrong and i am right but even such laws couldn't even save those girls search up the net see how many poor women get raped everyday... You are not wrong but sometimes you gotta realise that the greatest threat and devil is the mankind itself.. harming each other and peaceful living creatures like animals."
BestOfLiveleak,fe4dex1,t1_fe4b1lh,1578858077.0,It might seem that way at the moment but you have no idea of your intentions when it might happen to you or to your loved ones... I am pretty sure you aren't gonna be like here officer take him up he raped me or my loved one take good care and serve him some jail time....
BestOfLiveleak,fe49bjc,t3_enql53,1578856970.0,People here saying that was barbaric or whatever.. hear this raping a 13 year old do you even fucking Understand what does that mean? Hell with it being 13 no matter how old a person such acts can destroy his whole life. People have no right to say that he didn't deserve it until they felt the pain of the person who got raped. I think he didn't deserve death but he deserved torture for life!

DevilmanCrybaby,fdbe86b,t1_fdbbqmp,1578256553.0,"I appreciate your fandom üòä. Yes it had many important messages that media scares to present nowdays it's indeed a bold show. However the ep 9 hit me so hard that i just couldn't get over the grief of.. you know. As i said i like good storytelling  that gets you invested in the character particularly that one character... same with endgame where the relationships you create with them. Both the shows  embraces what it is and i am grateful for it. It had moments of brilliance like tons, even despite the fact i can handle gore i am not a fan of all these tentacles and monster things that I thought show was mostly routing for but it showed it's more than that! If any show has even one of the scenes which stands out and makes me think that it's incredible overshadowing all its flaws it becomes easily one of my favourite ones. Well for now i am just kinda depressed.. and gotta figure out something i am sad but at the same time happy to see that the show is pretty damn impactful and hits your feelings hard.."
DevilmanCrybaby,fdbcetc,t1_fdbab8n,1578255961.0,Well yeah i had a question that i know that some spinoffs of Devilman were their earlier so do they continue after Amon the apocalypse of devilman? Or they are just spinoffs...
DevilmanCrybaby,fdb9mwz,t1_fdb54ng,1578255192.0,"Thanks! And i am really grateful that the show exist.. honestly i don't really watch a lot of anime not that because i wasn't intrigued or i was kinda young 17 as of now but because i never gave it a go so i can't really says its the best but it's definitely something that I've never seen before, what can i say i am a sucker for good storytelling and this one has it...
