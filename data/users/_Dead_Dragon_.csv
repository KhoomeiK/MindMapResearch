raisedbynarcissists,fff51ls,t3_et9ik5,1579875883.0,"They’re really treating you like shit. I’m so sorry you have to deal with it. 

I’d like to offer my condolences for your father’s passing, specifically, for the loss of any possibility for a truly meaningful and supportive parental connection with him.  It’s so hard sometimes to deal with the conflicting emotions we experience when a toxic relative dies, especially a parent.  On one hand, you are relieved that they can’t hurt you anymore, and on the other hand, you lost someone you knew your entire life, and who you wished to have a relationship with at one point. 

My advice to you is to take a friend with you to the service.  It doesn’t even have to be a close friend, it could be a person you talk to sometimes. It’s even better if they are or were a security guard, police officer,EMT or firefighter.  These folks deal with crazy frequently as part of their jobs so they’ll recognize it when they see it.

Having someone there who is there solely for you will help you feel more secure.  There’s a strong possibility that their physical presence will dissuade some of the more shitty behaviour from your shitty egg donor and her minion spawn.  This person can also be a witness to the crazy that does happen, and can validate what you experience.

In the subject of the psychological abuse you suffer from your family’s refusal to support you financially, I’m so sorry that they fucked you over so badly.  I know you are angry about it still, and I think that’s valid.  I’d only like to say that I’m worried that you are dwelling on it.  It’s not good for your mental health to stew over what should have happened and didn’t, and how that messed with your ability to succeed.  I think it would be better for you to recognize how much success you have had without having those advantages and privileges.  After all, have your own home now, and that’s a huge accomplishment.

My only other pieces of advice is to go read some of the posts on r/justnomil and r/justnofamily.  There are lots of stories there that are similar to your own, and tons of great advice available.  There is also a great channel on YouTube called [TheraminTrees](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheraminTrees).  They talk a lot about mental health and the effects of abuse.  I think you will find a lot of validation there.  I know I did.

Edit to add one more thing: Don’t talk to any of your family alone.  If they insist on trying to take you aside to speak privately, away from your friend, refuse. It’s an attempt to try and coerce you. You can say something like: “Anything you have to say to me can be said in front of my friend.  If that’s not acceptable to you, I don’t want to hear it”"

PourPainting,fem5hmm,t1_felwpkn,1579240454.0,"Sand it down, and apply a primer coat of paint.  If you don’t, you’ll end up with peeling.

The second thing you should consider is doing a few practice runs on similar materials.  Scrap metal from old electronics will work.

The last thing is to do some research on the type of paint that will bond best.  You may find that your typical pour paints like acrylic aren’t ideal for use on electronics unless you apply a clear coat afterwards.

Oh yeah, and make sure you protect your holes for the buttons from excess paint.  Nothing will ruin your project faster than finding out that the paint got a bit thick in places, and  you forcing the buttons through causes the paint to chip.

Reading your story makes me feel for you.  You’re struggling so much every day just to live an ordinary life.  It’s obvious to me that you need support and love.  I wish I could be there physically to help.  The best I can do is offer to listen when you want to talk, and help be your sounding board.

Virtual hugs to you.  You aren’t alone. I’m cheering for you."

I’m glad you went with an open adoption.  You give the child the opportunity to never question where they came from, and you gave a couple a chance to have a child of their own, and include you and DH in their extended family.

Quick side note here, my sister-in -law had issues with her youngest being extremely upset all the time.  Then, on a particularly frazzling day, my SIL ran out of milk.  She said “fuck it” and used soy milk.  The next day, her kid became an angel.  Once there was real milk back in the fridge, demon baby again.

It turned out that the kiddo had allergies to dairy, eggs, and seafood.  Whatever she was allergic to was getting passed along in the breast milk.  Once my SIL cut all that out of her diet, her kiddo was fine.  It was pretty darned hard for SIL to do, because she loves all those foods.  She gave up on breastfeeding after 8 months. 

Kiddo is a healthy 4 year old now. She’s had tolerance training for her allergies.  Her doctors believe she’ll completely outgrow her early allergies by the time she is 10."

It was one of the best cars for farm life because it never got stuck.  You could skid off an icy highway into a deep ditch full of snow and you could drive it right back out again.

The last act for the one I grew up with was protecting my my two brothers, my mother and I when a tractor-trailer sideswiped us on the driver’s side. (100% the trucker’s fault, he was 40km over the speed limit in icy conditions) We ended up in the ditch full of snow, the front and back ends of the frame bent to the right.  All of us were fine.

The final act of the car was to pull itself out of the snow-filled ditch to the tow truck.

If the result is the same, you’ll be reassured that what you do next is going be helpful. 

In the meantime, make sure you do your best to reduce the stress, both your kitties and your own.  That means a good routine, including exercise and rest, and meditation for yourself, probably taking the form of mindful quiet time with your kitty.  The stress we feel can bleed over to our animal companions.

You may want to help by playing recordings of cats purring, especially mother cats purring to their kittens.  It might help them relax."

JUSTNOMIL,fctzxfp,t3_eioj9r,1577967616.0,"Hey OP.  What you described your MIL having sounds an awful lot like the illness my JustYesMIL and my niece went through over the holidays.  My nephew had brought it home from school.  From what my SIL said, it took a week or so for it to incubate in her daughter, so you should be very vigilant for the next while.

Others have said very similar things to how I would approach handling your MIL, so I’m not going to say much other than she was 100% selfish, and needs to face consequences.

What I will say is you need to get help, because you sound like you’re starting to suffer caregiver burnout.  You need to take care of yourself, because your kids need you to.  You need someone to come in and help you with everything in the house for a while, so you can relax and actually enjoy some time alone, taking care of your needs.

My only other suggestion is to get brass doorknobs or door levers.  I’d say you should ask your daycare to get some installed too, if they haven’t already. There was a paper published in the last few years which showed that brass has anti-microbe effects.  If you google it, you should be able to pull up the paper.  If you want to read the whole thing, and the paper is behind a paywall, email one of the authors for a copy.  They are frequently happy to give you a free copy of their research papers when asked."

The most she wants at those moments is for me to acknowledge her, which is usually accomplished by offering my hand for a smell, or even pointing at her, so she can touch my finger with her nose. If she wants a quick scratch, she’ll rub her head on my hand.

However, there are times when she does want snuggles, and she usually indicates that by trying to get me to follow her to a snuggle spot."

Another option is hand sewing. You can start fixing stuff of your own, and maybe do some side repairs for your coworkers. 

Then there is cross stitch and embroidery, which has also been mentioned by others.

The phone company won’t eat the cost for upgrading the service, so it’s up to the farmer to pay for it. That price is dictated by the phone company, because they’re not going to let just anyone near their lines.  They have enough trouble with backhoes as gophers digging up their lines as it is."
