TalesFromYourServer,ff72826,t1_ff6u01o,1579639653.0,"My mom will go up and compliment the parents of well-behaved children.

When you get parents upset at this view, their responses usually include the words ""deserve"" and ""earned"".

I'm not sure what they think they deserve or have earned, as the general public did not ask them to have children...so why do they feel that the general public should be subjected to their children's behavior?

The fact is if you're going to have kids, you need to be prepared to restrict your activities.

If you went out a lot before you had kids, you can't expect to do that after you have kids and not suffer repercussions.

My brother and I were not taken to nice restaurants until we were able to behave properly.

Prior to that point, we either did not go out, or food was brought home, or we would go to some place that was child-friendly such as McDonald's, etc."

Not touching other people's food

You are not deserving of special treatment because you ""exist"".

For the parents: No one cares that you've managed to push out a couple crotch goblins - you, along thousands of other people around the world on the same day your little angel was born.

If they can't behave in public, hire a babysitter if you want to go out or wait until they can behave in public.

Not directed at OP, but to those making such judgements:

Perhaps the divorce is due to the character of the wife? 

Perhaps the divorce is due the emotional stress of not being able to conceive?

Regardless, it is not the business of the Lodge.

What if the Brother is responsible for infidelity and filed for divorce?

The comments mentioned are up there with ""a woman's place is in the kitchen"" or ""keep 'em barefoot and pregnant"".

Regarding the Appendant bodies: 

their purpose is not to be a social forum for those who miss going to prom.  Dinners and social events are a pleasant perk, but have zero to do with the purpose of the body. There is no requirement to have ""a lady"" to introduce at dinners, etc. 

Are single brothers less qualified?

If anyone's qualifications to take a chair or lead a Lodge are in question, it is those of the individuals who made those statements."

You can ask about the Society, but not to join.

AL, TX, NY, CA, and IL have 2-3 Colleges in the state; the remaining states have one.

The experience will vary from College to College.

Over the past few years, there has been a significant effort to refocus the direction of the Colleges back towards study and research papers: the presentation of those papers in the Colleges, the discussion of the papers, and the publication of those papers.

Depending on the College, you'll find Masons at all different levels.

For many, the Society is an outlet for members to discuss topics that their Lodges would not find interesting or where their Lodges do not have an educational focus."
