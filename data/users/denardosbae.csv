90DayFiance,ffactk4,t1_ff8ntmk,1579732524.0,Those kids also seem to really lovw her. They show healthy attachments to her by going to her for comfort when the crew is around filming which has to be super strange to young kiddos. She might be a jerk to Mahhkull but she seems to be doing a decent job with giving the kids a safe space while their mother does her time from the brief bits with them shown anyway.

IdiotsInCars,ff8ubu5,t1_ff8o1zv,1579696357.0,Four to five miles over in most places in USA is okay especially if you are matching the flow of traffic. They will usually try to get 7 over at least because of their revenue stream being higher the bigger the ticket. Note this will NOT work in certain regions and it helps if you're familiar with customs of the area. There's some small towns known for having a very agressive police force that might pull you over for 1mph over limit just to check you out.

While she sits back with an attitude like meh, this guy loves me, I guess he's ok and I'll let him have a shot. But if he isn't perfect, I'll give him endless shit. 

And of course he isn't perfect because we're all humans here. It allows her this illusion of emotional distance and control over the narrative of the entire relationship. Idiots like this usually dont change and she is definitely gonna end up driving him away eventually. When he DOES break it off, its very likely she will stalk and harass him for years. This type is super odd to me, they act like they don't care during entire time you're with them. But the hot second that you break up and they are no longer in control, then you see that they truly do care. In a scary and batshit crazy way that you want nothing to do with."
