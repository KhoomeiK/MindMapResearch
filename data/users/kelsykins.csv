PhD,feku7eh,t3_epmq4n,1579207691.0,"Get some hobbies that you enjoy. This goes for almost all people in academia, but especially in a Ph.D. I make a point of trying new hobbies pretty consistently too. You need to have something that makes you feel calm and relaxed. I learned to knit and make myself and my friends blankets (excellent for holidays too!) and took up running as well. One hobby is good for the body and the other is good for relaxing. 

  
Also, make sure that you are in a healthy routine with any persistent mental health issues you have. I started my graduate studies when my anxiety wasn't well managed and it just takes a little longer and more effort/motivation to strike that balance."
PhD,fee78si,t3_eopbvo,1579027844.0,"Congratulations! You've done such a good thing and you should be proud! People think that your research is relevant and interesting! 

I was in a similar position last year at the first conference I ever presented at. I just sat down in my hotel room afterward, called my SO/family and told them how it went and talked through how I was feeling. I also contacted my advisor and said I felt weird with people paying attention to me, as I try to fly under the radar most of the time. Try to remind yourself that people aren't expecting more from you just because you've presented good research, they are just interested in what you have to say.

Find someone that you trust and feel comfortable with at the conference and explain how you're feeling. Most times people are more than willing to help others that are feeling overwhelmed. We as graduate students and researchers pour our hearts and souls into research, and any strong reaction generates a lot of emotion. Allow yourself to feel that weird anxiety! But also remind yourself it's only coming on because of this positive attention from your great research! 

Congratulations again!"

If you have something like a pawprint from your pup you can actually get them made into custom stamps for use like this! I lost my cat at Christmas two years ago and got his pawprint mold from the vet made into a stamp. you can also do their name tag or something else similar if a pawprint isn't your style!"
bulletjournal,fdotr1e,t3_emae0s,1578612677.0,"I do this all of the time! I often just write LOL! next to it and move on. On occasion, I will draw a little animal or stick man pointing at it saying something silly about my screw up."
PhD,fdoq1eo,t3_em87bj,1578610295.0,"1. As a student with a non-research based Masters degree, I really struggle with getting lab techniques done effectively now that I am in a more self-directed program. I simply can't grasp the concepts and skills as quickly as in a lot of cases I am just learning the skills. My second issue is definitely imposter syndrome. I recently wrote my thesis proposal and was CONVINCED all of the 30 pages I wrote was wrong and I was going to get kicked out of my program. I am also a first-generation university student, and just recently imposter syndrome was found to occur more in this group.  Very interesting. 
2. True breaks. I know we work all year, it's our job, etc., but I never took more than a day off of school work during my first year and experienced MAJOR burnout. I took 2 weeks off at Christmas this year because my advisor told me I basically had to, and I am actually happy to be back to work now."
GradSchool,fdlmze3,t3_elxq44,1578527695.0,"When reading papers, I do 25 minute pomodoros with 5 minute breaks until I've worked for 2 hours, at which point I take at least 30 minutes to relax and let my brain chill. With this system I can usually go for around 6 hours of working. I find the long breaks make a huge difference."
PhD,fdlm2jv,t3_elz55a,1578527094.0,"Congrats! That's my goal as well, despite one of my advisor's clear objection toward the whole idea. It gives me hope that I can get there as well!  Congrats again on all your hard work paying off!"

P.S. Ahhh I love your prayer plant!"
PhD,f92tsuh,t3_e3fr2p,1575041569.0,"As a person who just had a meeting about working on my research proposal, I can share the advice my advisor gave me. 
1. Develop your thesis and the chapters you will address. Make it a solid page of what you will do to address the research questions.
2. Support your thesis intent with a solid state of the art research review. Situate yourself in the current literature.
3. Write out the steps or experiments you intend to undertake to test your hypotheses and answer your research question.
4. Explain how this research is significant. This should be fairly easy to see as you write this narrative of research.

Best of luck in writing!"
