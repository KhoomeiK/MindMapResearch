Most amateurs will go for a right hook first. If you’re not planning to strike first, plan for this.

CCPA,fglr6f2,t1_fglabz7,1580908781.0,"I read that as two options. [natural person] or [business registered with the secretary of state]. 

A natural person specifies a human in their capacity as a human—not an employee. “Hi, I’m John Smith, Whistle said I could do this on his behalf. Look he signed a permission slip.”

Basically, a part of starting any legal business is getting registered with the state. That’s how businesses get a tax ID, make sure their name is ok, and get a basic licensees to do business. Full disclosure, I’m not a business owner in CA, and not familiar with CA specifics, but a ton of other states work this way.

In my read, a natural person would not need to register with the state."
etiquette,fgkvwrq,t3_ez1qz2,1580874842.0,"Your level of social comfort is equally as important, so don’t press yourself to do anything that makes you uncomfortable. 

Some things to consider, many latino cultures are open with hugs and cheek kisses.  I moved from that to the Midwest, and it was hard. Like, how dare you come into my my home and shake my hand. We’re family now, you better open my fridge, take a shit in my bathroom, and give me a hug and kiss!

The Spanish word for “manners so good you are uncomfortable or don’t do things you want” is “pena.” One beautiful concept is that a host can say, “no tienes pena” or someone can say “tengo pena,” and you can quickly address that issue. 

Clothing might be another. Latino cultures often forgo graphic t-shirts when doing social interactions—especially older generations. If that’s your style, you may want to consider some norm core tops. 

Lastly, and a bit reiterated, be yourself and as Long as you’re not being rude, you’re fine. Take the high road and if they say “you’re too American” ask what you can do to make them feel more at home."

CCPA,fgjb0ve,t3_eyt0hq,1580840422.0,">“Authorized agent” means a natural person or a business entity registered with the Secretary of State that a consumer has authorized to act on their behalf subject to the requirements set forth in section 999.326.


>§ 999.326. Authorized Agent
(a) When a consumer uses an authorized agent to submit a request to know or a request to delete, the business may require that the consumer:
(1) Provide the authorized agent written permission to do so; and
(2) Verify their own identity directly with the business.
(b) Subsection (a) does not apply when a consumer has provided the authorized agent with power of attorney pursuant to Probate Code sections 4000 to 4465.
(c) A business may deny a request from an agent that does not submit proof that they have been authorized by the consumer to act on their behalf.

**Said plainly:**

Anyone with written permission. That said, there is not clear guidance on whether a signed napkin is written permission, as compared to a signed, witnesses, and notarized letter."

CCPA,fggv2x2,t1_fggu848,1580770222.0,"These are great questions that I cannot answer. But Facebook likely can. Here I’m wildly speculating: 

I imagine they want a photo ID so they can make sure the person in the profile picture looks reasonably like the person in the ID, rather than a letter-to-letter name match. They would probably only delete the account that logged in and made the request.  The use case in mind is probably common names. There must be 1,000 Adam Smiths in Facebook. It would be a mistake for them to wipe all of them when one Adam “Smithe” makes a request for deletion."
CCPA,fggtbg6,t3_eydqzv,1580769088.0,"Right now the state attorney’s regulations to CCPA compliance are not clear about what actual measures meet the “reasonable” level it sets out for verifying a user before deleting or sharing that users data. You can obviously see why I shouldn’t be able to delete your Facebook presence. 

But if I stole a piece of mail from your mailbox, I’d have name and address. Is that enough? What if I paid ~$10 to find out your phone number through the many public records lookup sites? 

At what point does Facebook protect you enough from bad actors? At what point is it an inconvenience to you? Obviously a DNA sample, list of 10 previous addresses, and sworn statement from two living relatives and a priest would confirm who you are—but that’s got problems on the other side. 

I completely understand that the last thing you want to do is give a company more (and more sensitive) PII to delete your other PII. 

I would review their notices carefully. Any company that uses the PII collected for verifying identity of the user for other purposes is going to be in a world of hurt. But hey, the US is the Wild West and the long arm of the law has never had weaker fingers. So... good luck amigo. 

For what it’s worth, I don’t mind giving out my license # because it’s already fairly findable."
