ConsumeProduct,ffi52yu,t1_ffi27ux,1579965303.0,"Of course not and those kind of extreme purity tests are more a thing for the left. This sub is more about rejecting consumption as an Ersatz religion. A lot of young people have no personality or purpose beyond their consumption of media and merch. People should strive for more than their dopamine fixes in the form of cooming or consooming. It's a rejection of the infantilization of modern men in particular and call for or people to be more family and community oriented. 

Like all niche subreddits it is of course prone to radicalization but the core of the message is always the same callback to traditional family values and the moral system that propped it up in the past.

Everybody understands that you have to live your life within the confines of modern society and almost nobody really wants to reject society completely and live like uncle Ted. But that doesn't mean that one can't mock the siren song of worthless trash peddled by the commerical interests that is meant to distract you from a system that makes a human life in this society less and less attainable. 

Family, children and community are at the very core of the human experience and rejecting them is to reject your humanity and that is going to cost you. That's what this sub is about. The rest is just cultural noise."

explainlikeimfive,ffhu44r,t1_ffhehfi,1579953979.0,"The compiler is a piece of software that takes a text input and translates it into machine code. 

To do so it first has a scanner or lexer which is a piece of code that takes an text input and converts it into a stream of tokens. So instead of a character sequence ""f o r"" you get a ""for""-token. That's the lexical analysis. It only checks if those character sequences are part of the language. Some tokens are keywords like ""for"" others are identifiers like variable names and others again are just symbols like ""("" . If you encounter a malformed token that's a lexical error. Like a variable name that starts with a number is often not allowed.

The next piece of software is called a parser. It checks the grammar. Just containing the correct words doesn't make something a correct sentence it also needs to be in very distinct pattern and that's called grammar. The parser can read those tokens from the scanner and checks the order in which they are. In a simple form they are top-down parsers which work like giant decision trees. If you are at a certain point in a sentence you know that only certain words are valid as the next possible word. In English the verb has to b at a certain place for example. In Java or C you know that if the last token was a ""for"" the next has to be a ""("" . At the end of an expression there has to be a "";"" and so on. Sometimes there are multiple choices and you just follow the next token, as I said just like a decision tree.
If you encounter a token that's wrong like a ""#"" after a ""for"" it's an error in the code you try to translate. (That also means that you have to be able to make a decision a every fork in the road and that's limiting in language construction so there are other more powerful methods for parsing but that one is the simplest.) If you are done with one rule, for example you reached the final ""}"" in a for loop, you go back a step in your decision tree and check for the next decision. 

You now have checked if your program has the correct words in them and if they are in the correct order. What you can now do is to translate the sentence into another language. That can be machine code or it can be something else like Java byte code which is like machine code but for a virtual machine i.e. a piece of software that interprets the code again. 

Say you encounter something like ""x=5+a"". First you would generate machine code that loads the number 3 into a register let's say register A. 

const 5 A

 for example in a sort of pseudo machine code. 

 The parser has encountered a variable name before in ""x"" and that was followed by an assignment operator in ""="" so now it is at a point in it's logic which says that it is going to save whatever is in the other side of that assignment into x. ""x"" has to be declared somewhere in your program and at that point the parser is going to generate an entry in the something called a symbol table that stores information relevant to that variable. If it is the second variable it says that wherever memory address our program starts go to the section where variables are and look at the second entry. The same thing is true for ""a"". Let's say it's the third variable. 

So after we generated our code for ""5"" the parser sees a ""+"" and goes into the rule for add. That rule says that if you see a variable name load that variable. So we generate something like 

Load 3 B

That takes whatever is at that memory address and stores it into another register B. (a register is a memory cell in your cpu). 

Then the add rule says that it should generate the machine code for add.

Add

Add is defined as take A and B and store the sum in A.
Then it generates the code for storing the sum. We remembered x when we encountered it and we see it it is the second variable so we generate

Store 2 A

Now the sum is in the memory of where we defined x to be in. 

That generates a long list of instructions out if your whole program. If you have a decision to make in your program like an ""if"" decision it is done via jump instructions that check if something in Register A is bigger than in register B for example if it is it goes to a certain point in that instruction list and if it isn't it continues where it is. 

That's the gist of it. There are other more complex strategies that allow for other language features or for optimization. But in it's simplest form you just check for correct words and whether they are in the correct order or not and if they are you translate it into some sort of lower level language."
