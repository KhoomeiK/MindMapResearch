todayilearned,fd6lyzw,t1_fd5xq7k,1578192930.0,"I think the requirements for the job are always overestimated. Usually what you see is based on templates that are cobbled together with the intent of getting maybe 50% of the qualifications met. This is partly to make the company, managers, and human resources look responsible and cover their bases, and partly to attract people with better credentials even though those people usually aren't on the market at all, because they're actively being sought out and hopping from job offer to job offer. Obviously some things are firm, like doctors needing medical degrees, but experience is not firm at all. It's a deciding factor, but unless there are a LOT of applicants, they'll still interview and consider someone with little or no experience. It's just more of a pain to train them in and get them working.

But if you're a big fan of rules, and you don't bother applying because you didn't feel comfortable not having all the experience they said was required, you screwed yourself for no reason. Just like negotiating a contract or bartering with a salesperson, that is just the original listed price. You can still come to the table with another offer. Like seeing a pair of maracas listed at $20 and coming in with only a $10 bill to try getting them for less. There's no law or punishment for your attempt. At worst they'll turn you away. It's just another silly game employers play. Just like required tipping in some countries like the USA, or coming in to the office when all your work could be done from home, or working 40+ hours when you only have 20 hours of work."

Nice try Reddit, but you can't correct the master memer."
