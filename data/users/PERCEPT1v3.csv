While in college at Auburn on a goal line play that would almost certainly decide which Bowl game Auburn would be sent to, Bo got a call wrong and ran left, on a play where he should have ran right. This play could have put Auburn in a national title bowl game. He literally cost them the game. Bo later acknowledged his favorite joke from the snafu.
