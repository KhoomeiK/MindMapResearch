Nope. It's all based on massive debt.

That is true. The massive debt is directly related to Trumping taking office.

Yes.... liberals are the problem...

EDIT: Adding this for poignancy. I also never said shit about Obama. I don't give a fuck about Obama. He ALSO increased the national debt quite handily. He ALSO made some poor choices.

> Paychecks are increasing with unemployment as low as it has been in decades

Those two things have zero correlation. And the first part is just plain false. And unemployment was decreasing at the same rate before Trump took office. Just because it continued while he was in office doesn't mean he had any impact on it. Unless you're celebrating the fact that he didn't fuck it up, which is quite honestly something to celebrate, considering who he is.

The problem here is assuming that people believe that. You may realize that. I may realize that. But other people see ""oh look the economy is great!"" and think Trump did anything to accomplish that. They don't realize that almost literally every metric was already trending that way before he became president. Yes, there are aspects of the economy that are better than when he took office, but the percentage increase directly correlates to the increase that occurred before he was president as well. But that's not in the infographic someone posted. They also don't know that ""the economy"" just means GDP and stocks. Or that the economy is increasing on the back of insurmountable debt. They just see ""lower unemployment! Best economy!"" So now uninformed people think Trump has been the greatest president we've ever had.

Uninformed people will vote solely based on the limited information that has been fed to them. This presidency has typically been overwhelmingly against Trump, but 1) there is still plenty of pro-Trump shit going around, and 2) that isn't typically the case. A lot of people actually vote for presidents they wouldn't want, and they don't even realize it, because they don't know the policies; they merely know what they hear on the smear campaigns."

> KOA: Where are we going?

I think something like, ""You will see"" as a response builds more suspense for the reader. Then when they stand in front of the picture, he tells him what he's seeing, so there was no reason to tell him in the previous panel.

Page 2
> MAN: Koa. The sign said no trespassing, there are plenty of other waterholes to choose from.  

>KOA: But none like this one, this one was special. 

Both of those commas should either be periods or semicolons. You're combining two independent clauses; a comma can only do that, if a conjunction is used, which isn't being done here. Also keep in mind the nuances of a semicolon: the two combined sentences should be related in some way, and I don't know that I've ever seen a semicolon in a comic book.

> ELDER: The Rainbow Serpent? one of the first things I taught you boy and you misused the knowledge. 

You need a comma before the ""and"" here.

> ELDER: The power from the dreamtime is not for me or for you--

I don't understand the em dash here. Typically that is used for someone being interrupted, but he continues to talk. If it's a self-interruption, you're probably better off with three ellipses (you...).

> ELDER: I’m afraid so son, i'm afraid so.  

Comma needs to be a period. There should also be a comma before ""son.""

This exchange is very strange. This guy must be one shitty cop to give up so easily. I understand for the story you need him to show up and then leave, but I don't think this is the way. I feel like it would flow better, if he sees them before anyone is pushed to the ground. He stops and asks them what's going on. Then the elder can say something to the effect of ""We're just going for a stroll. We're not breaking any laws."" Koa doesn't know he is in trouble, so he seems fine. The cop walks away and gets back in his car. He buckles his seat belt, looks up and sees Koa being thrown to the ground. The cop tries to get out again, but his seat belt won't unlock. Koa looks up, screaming ""Help me!"" to see the cop staring at him but thinks he's not doing anything to help. Obviously you don't have to use that exactly, but I think it makes more sense that way. Then it looks like the cop actually cares from the reader's standpoint, but to Koa, it looks like he gives zero fucks.

That second line is awful and completely unnecessary. He's standing in front of a grave; I'm pretty sure the readers will pick up on what's happening.

> MASON: I guess what angers me the most is that everyone is saying it was a road accident, I know that’s not true. 

> MASON: Even if that puncture in your chest wasn’t there I still wouldn’t have believed it, we didn’t spend all those weekends driving go karts against each other it--

> MASON: --That wasn’t all for one of us to get involved in a fatal road accident. 

Do people really say ""road accident""? I'm in the states, and we would say ""car crash"" or ""car accident."" If that's normal talk, then that's fine; it just seems weird for me to read. Also, I'm not getting the go-kart to car crash correlation here. Little kids can drive go-karts, but they can't drive cars. Plus this dialogue feels a little forced. I think just saying, ""I know it wasn't a car crash. I knew before I even heard about the puncture in your chest.""

> MASON: I know what happened, plain and simple it was homicide and maybe because I’m still a kid they didn't want to tell me my old man was murdered. 

> MASON: They were your co-workers, and at the end of the day they just want to save their own necks. Probably less paperwork involved in a road accident then murder this way. 

There should be a period after ""plain and simple"" and a comma after ""homicide."" Also ""then murdered"" should be ""than murdered"" with an ""a.""

Page 6:

> CAPTION (KOA): I’m pretty confident I could survive out here alone. 

Just saying ""I know"" instead of ""I'm pretty confident"" works better, I think. Knowing he can do it implies confidence in his ability.

> CAPTION (KOA): Realistically all that stops me is being limited to such a small space. 

> CAPTION (KOA): I have to stay far away enough from Arnhem City to stay safe from the men of white law but not too far that I risk being caught back in Yolngu Country.

""Realistically"" feel unnecessary here. I also think you're giving too much information in the second line that sounds unnatural. Something more natural would be ""I need to stay out of reach of both the white man and my people."" Again, feel free to alter that, but it just feels better to me.

> Mason goes on a computer to search Sergeant Robinson on the police database.

They don't lock their computers? Or use username/passwords for the database search? Might make a reference to him knowing his dad's credentials here.

> MASON: Sarah Robinson… no criminal record of course, and extensive recognition as a great cop, but why would she lie about my dad’s death?

Needs a comma after ""record."" 

Page 9

> OFFICER: Sorry to disturb you Mrs Becker, but considering the circumstances, it’s important. 

> KARA: Of course officer, I’m sorry for the trouble.

Needs a comma after ""you"" in the first line and a comma after ""course"" in the second line. The comma after ""officer"" should be a period.

> OFFICER: Mason is always welcome in the police station  but breaking in was unnecessary, that being said I think it’s for the best if i take your key back.

Needs a comma before ""but,"" and the comma you have should be a period. There should also be a comma after ""best.""

> KARA: I’m confident this incident will never repeat itself, I’m so sorry about this. thank you for being lenient on him.

Comma should be a period.

> KARA: I know you Mason, you are your father's son and I couldn't talk him out of dangerous situations and I assume that will be the same with you. I know you want to find a different reason for his death, but if there isn't one be prepared to understand that--

Comma after ""Mason"" should be a period. There should be a comma after ""son"" and ""situations."" Another unnecessary em dash to end the sentence.

> KARA: --And if you find a hidden truth, be careful. 

Unnecessary em dash to start a sentene.

> KARA: But i hope the trip was worth it Mason. did you find anything?

Comma before ""Mason.""

Basically just showing what I talked about before, so no real notes on this one."
nfl,ff2yi3a,t1_ff2y4ng,1579528669.0,I meant before the age of 25. Thank you. I've updated my comment.
nfl,ff2y0ha,t1_ff2vt19,1579528230.0,"After we win this year, I would love for you guys to win it next year. I'm a big Ravens fan, mostly because I absolutely love Edgar Allen Poe, so I'm rooting for you guys."
nfl,ff2vk94,t3_ercxd7,1579525818.0,There's still time.
nfl,ff2vion,t3_ercxqa,1579525773.0,"I'm obviously biased here, but I think seeing a player get MVP one year and win the Super Bowl (before the age of 25) the next year would be awesome. Plus, Mahomes would be the first ever to be on the cover of Madden and win it all. I really want Reid to get a ring, and a few others as well. Kelce has been playing lights out for years, and I would love love love for Suggs to get another ring. That would be such a great story. Plus I've been waiting for 30 years to see my team in the Super Bowl. I really feel like the fans deserve this one."
nfl,ff2t9e3,t1_ff1nys4,1579523215.0,Hindsight is 50/50.
nfl,ff2rqel,t1_ff1wjpf,1579521200.0,It's because our defense is so greatly improved too. Pat didn't need flashy numbers this year to win.
KansasCityChiefs,ff2rcxo,t1_f80e57w,1579520674.0,Yeah. It is.
KansasCityChiefs,ff1njs4,t3_er4vg2,1579482140.0,"Big props to you and a lot of your fans. I always check out other teams subs after a game, and I saw a lot of really great, positive things being said. Titans are damn good. You guys started 2-4. You have a lot of reason to celebrate. Really rooting for you guys on the years to come."

nfl,ff0q40f,t1_ff0lolm,1579471257.0,It's true. Chiefs already lit up Tannehill once.
nfl,feznyeq,t1_fezkhpw,1579459499.0,"Yes, we know. We don't have to see this comment every time someone says there's a difference between resign and re-sign."

nfl,fetgcj3,t1_fetcqnx,1579375165.0,I mean... he's pretty well known for his hitting. Just not against NFL players.
nfl,fetcf50,t1_fetb3eu,1579373884.0,I basically felt the exact same way. Lol
