Meanwhile, there are (assuming from your comment) well intending people like us that could be using ordination to male a difference for good. One does not even need to commit to religion to promote the joy of union.

AskReddit,fe7tf1i,t1_fe7oxru,1578919085.0,"Right. They want you to pay for the certificate. My point is, (from my experience in California) you do not need the certificate. It is mainly to frame and put on your wall. Becoming ordained and posession of a paper certificate are two different things. This is the purpose of the website. Without it yes, of course we would live in a world where we would need to carry paper documents to prove who we are. But the website exists to add your name to a database accessible to agencies who need to check such things. I never said you will get documents. I'm telling you it's a gift shop item. They have to make money somehow. They also sell wedding packages and robes and sashes. 

Otherwise, explain what I have been doing for years now. Every wedding I have done has been verified as legal. 

Besides, the burden of proof is still on you. I have provided the website with the full ordination process for free. If you have completed the process and are literally reading the words:  Welcome to the congregation of the Universal Life Church. As of 01/13/2020 you are now an ordained minister.
And you still don't get it, fine. There is nothing I can do for you. Keep putting this on a pedestal and relinquish your respect to pastors and ministers with a framed ""document"" on their wall. Hell, while your at it, discourage others and promote the mystesism and pomp and circumstance that makes someone ""officially"" a minister. Why don't you look up what is required to marry a couple in California."
