If you cant get the weiman cooktop cleaner another brand called cerma bryte exists. 

Though cerma bryte is more for the burnt on foods/ scalded water issues  and the scrunge works best for the residue in your photo. 

I usually use a regular sponge- just a little damp- and wipe the spot. Then scrunge with elbow grease! After I've done the cerma bryte clean. (Cerma bryte goes on liquid and dries, I scrub/flake it off with a dry papertowel).

Other toys are typical squeaker balls (but with nubbly rubber bits so they're good for teething but my one dog has always loved them. )

I was recently told to take their favorites like the ball described above and to wrap it in old towels or blankets so they have to unwrap them to play. (But you should help of they're trying to pull/tear as they're getting frustrated).

You are right in that calling blue cross isnt going to work on anything other than a weekday. If you pay for anything out of pocket it will need to be reimbursed by blue cross -
After being approved as medically necessary first (a.k.a tons of red tape). So keep those costs negligible and follow up with your CDU ASAP. 

I know blue cross has paid for emergencies for members outside of canada. But the one case I was involved with the member survived and was able to travel via regular air fare with their family home. I'm sure it would be far more of a hassle to have a medi-flight to canada from anywhere other than Geilenkirchen. But it would likely be blue cross haggling with the flight provider vs you as a patient needing to make up costs later.  

Essentially I would just keep your blue cross travel card on your person in at risk activities. 

The base blue cross rep can order you the travel card. Or the medavie website depending on your base. They're cutting back on those local experts in favor of members doing the work - poorly and by themselves. (Enter the thinking meme with the caption ""you dont have to reimburse what the people don't know how to claim""). 

A shame as having seen those blue cross people process, they know the code for getting you a non slip tub mat for the bottom of your bath after surgery, without even looking. But it will now be members downloading multiple read files trying to find the right numbers; and having their claims denied because the items they wanted weren't the specific ones for that ""enter X illness or surgery here""."

Frugal,fcwtpll,t3_ejahcm,1578037216.0,"Frozen veggies in your rice and or ramen will help extend its nutritional value and fiber offerings to keep you full. It helps if you have a freezer though cause the bags can take up lots of space. I like frozen soy beans (a.k.a edamame) because it's a decent protein serving for a relatively small serving size. 

Also things like split peas, you can get a 500g bag for 2 bucks or less. I made peas pudding (a mashed potatoes consistency type of texture) as a side. The bag gave me a 10 inch round pan full. I separated it into servings and froze them. 

No name pasta or Great Value at walmart is actually very comparable to name brand for fiber/ carbs. The big bags are about 2 bucks. 

Keep staples like flour (get big bags on sale) and try and make your own bread, or cheese sauces. Borrow spices from friends if they have any. 

Tofu is a cheaper protein. Consider it.

If you get peanut butter, only get it if it's on sale. That sort of thing is more a quality of life item on your budget but maybe a food pantry could send one your way. 

Rotisserie chickens are usually sold at a loss as a great deal. Get one, harvest the chicken and use the bones and leftover meat to make soup. Or at least broth (another way to use your great value noodles).

MurderedByWords,fcvbixu,t1_fcufn48,1577998640.0,"I think I have a hard time with the concept of these sets targeted at girls because of the banality of some of the sets. 

Like I can get WHY an 8 year old girl would want a playset that incorporates an accessories store. When you're 8 you think they're amazing places, and maybe you got your ears pierced in one. So you know the idea.

But why these kids should have to step outside their box sets to incorporate neutral tones, or have access to a raptor figure is what blows me away. 

Regardless of how kids imaginations work, the fact that is the sets seem made to focus on pretty average to kind of lame sets for girls. 

Whereas boys have police forces, garbage trucks, ninja, star wars, lego city, arctic expedition fantastical stuff that girls arent exposed to, to really know to ask for. Like it's cool, being an astronaut is a bit of a reach for most folks as a dream job. But why should girl sets not even mention it? After all digging up a sabre tooth tiger in the arctic is a pretty gar out there job, but that set exists over near the boys Lego. Oh sorry. Its attached to the boys lego section. It's in it.

Why are the astronaut suits or ninja suits in those tones favored by boys? (And yes I know Mya is the girl ninja, but she was a support entity for quite awhile before she got a ninja debut, and I can name the other ninjas colors, but I can't recall hers.)

The fact is this is driven by the $$ and they dont want to pander to too wide of a gender blending until they know itll pay off. 

I struggled to find a lego set for a girl this year because I felt that most of the ones available told girls their imaginations were ordinary or their dreams were related to ice cream or accessories!!! 

I ended up with a treehouse build with a zip line because as a kid I remember the attempt my sister and I had of building a fort in our backyard.
