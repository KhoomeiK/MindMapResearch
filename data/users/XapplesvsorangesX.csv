Flipping,fcvysg6,t1_fcvyfae,1578013186.0,Poshmark is a social app. The bigger the “follower” base you can build up the more chances of having your items seen when you do self shares. You constantly have to follow people as the people you may have followed months or a year ago could have deleted the app. Also sharing other peoples items brings exposure to your closet but the older I get the more tiring it is. I use to love all of it 4/5 years ago but Poshmark also takes their cut and I absolutely hate that discounted shipping eats into my cut. Don’t even get me started lol maybe I should post a Poshmark rant
