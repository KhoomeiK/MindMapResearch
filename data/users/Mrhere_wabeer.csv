MA1/A2 Plainfield 30 carbine


The plainfield is still a work in progress. Had to buy a new stock. And a whole new trigger group and mag well. I bought one from a place that had it both together. Not two seperate pieces. Barrel band doesn't stay tight so if you shoot it, it will rattle off. Havent shot it in a few years because of a screw in the back I need and then the whole barrel band thing.

Have had 8 threw out my life. Not at one time. Always had four on deck. Down to three. No lose to me. The 40cal I had was ok. It was a tanfoglio. Would like another hand gun with the whole, one is none, but im ok with it for now.

*trigger gaurd was rusted and rewellded a few times. The very first pull of the trigger broke it off. Still could shoot it but obv just wanted to change it out. Barrel band didnt start loosing up until a couple times after shooting it. Was at the range. Pulled the trigger. It rattled off, dust cover to the ground with the rest falling out of the stock It came with. Oh, it was designed like a .30car (could be used for one still) but set for a .22"
