dndmemes,ffe6q7m,t1_ffe6nkv,1579838171.0,The town was awful and racist and he asked if I wanted to do something fun and I said sure (I thought it was drugs or secrets or something) and then he dropped this poor kid on me but I’m now taking care of him
dndmemes,ffe6jbm,t1_ffe421q,1579838025.0,"Yeah, he did sell me a slave to kill (accidentally, I didn’t do an insight check to see what he was up to). So I’d like to think it was just"
dndmemes,ffd81wz,t3_esx1ex,1579815229.0,I'm a new player and I was put in a situation with a racist Innkeeper and I killed him and I'm so worried about the consequences but I didn't know what else to do and I panicked. It was either kill him or fight all the town guards
AmItheAsshole,fenjx01,t1_fenjfv6,1579286285.0,"I definitely, personally agree with you. Like, I don't think it was a mistake that warranted the reaction from her I received, but I second guess myself a lot and I worry that friends will give biased opinions, so I figured internet strangers would help"
AmItheAsshole,fenip9l,t1_fenih70,1579285540.0,"No, i totally get where I was an asshole here. It was very unproductive but I also was younger and a lot more hot headed than i am today. I know I wouldn't act the same way now. I can accept your judgment, I just wanted to make sure I wasn't the only idiot lol"
AmItheAsshole,fenijrv,t1_fenid0g,1579285446.0,"I genuinely can't remember if I called her any names, I just was a bit short in my responses and can be condescending when arguing with people. I can own that."
AmItheAsshole,feni7wi,t1_feni482,1579285243.0,Thank you. The libertarian stuff really became big after she met her boyfriend (now husband) but I mostly included that to give a bit of a perspective on why she was anti-Net Neutrality.
bulletjournal,fen15ed,t3_eq1pjm,1579274647.0,Here's the rest of the month so far: [https://imgur.com/a/UG6X6pr](https://imgur.com/a/UG6X6pr)
Dimension20,fejy1vy,t1_fejxyva,1579188453.0,"I totally agree. I think Rick Man About Town is a ""black coffee"" kind of guy as well"
Dimension20,fejnmmn,t3_epijvs,1579180910.0,I feel like one could be made for all of Rick’s personalities
DnD,fehvrsz,t1_fehvou2,1579124846.0,Coolio. It'd be cool to see them in the future then :) Now all I want is my Quarterling lol
DnD,fehvb61,t1_fehv738,1579124582.0,"I wonder why they weren't transferred to 5e? From the link, it seems they were last seen in 4e"
DnD,fehv4r2,t1_fehv2fz,1579124481.0,"Like I said, new to D&D. i didn't know, but its nice to know they do exist now"
DnD,fehth2e,t1_fehtecw,1579123541.0,I hadn't even heard of that. I'm very new to D&D and genuinely didn't know it existed
DnD,fehjlz9,t1_fehjk7h,1579117878.0,"Yeah, that was what I was thinking. It'd be interesting!"
DnD,fehj4dg,t1_fehj2cq,1579117591.0,Bards screw anything?
DnD,fehiqx2,t1_fehio9q,1579117371.0,"That's what I was wondering. Like ""ligers"""
antiMLM,fe5wnrv,t1_fe5wi2r,1578876609.0,"I was a MK rep (very short lived) and I for sure was pressure and convinced to buy a ton of shit I didn’t need. The products aren’t the problem, the sale design is. By buying the products you support an incredibly predatory industry."
antiMLM,fe48mnw,t1_fe41ryj,1578856830.0,Don’t feel that bad for her. She was my upline. She’s one of the ones who has done okay on the backs of others.
Dimension20,fdo72ny,t1_fdo6zls,1578600022.0,"Yeah, that's what I thought after a while too, I just was confused when Bean had a +12 to something"
Dimension20,fdo5gfb,t3_em9hei,1578599226.0,"Out of curiosity, does anyone know what level they are playing as? Their proficiency bonuses make me think high level, but their XP made me think maybe not that high and I'm very curious."
succulents,fd6opjn,t1_fd6kho4,1578193882.0,That’s my problem too rn! I think I need to buy a plant light
bulletjournal,fd3vzg0,t1_fd3cz9j,1578162131.0,I’m so jealous of people who can cross stitch. So a dope talent!
StardewValley,fcvtmo7,t1_fcvte8k,1578009830.0,Exactly! It’s really helped me track my mental health and be aware of what causes rises and falls.
StardewValley,fcvt6i0,t1_fcvsu0n,1578009541.0,The scale is a mood tracker for me. Basically if I have a fight with a friend or an anxiety attack it would be a “Bad” or “Awful” day. Good vs. great comes down to being with friends or having a really successful day
StardewValley,fcvoqmd,t1_fcvopd0,1578006691.0,Just as a joke!
bulletjournal,fcvidd1,t1_fcvibjs,1578002724.0,Yeah! I love relaxing with Stardew so he totally counts as health lol
StardewValley,fcvebjr,t1_fcve8m8,1578000311.0,Thanks! You too! Just have fun!
StardewValley,fcvdyvb,t1_fcvdqxl,1578000101.0,"Yeah, I definitely am not nearly as talented as the people I see on Pinterest and stuff, but like, no one really is? Like, a lot of those pages were designed and done and redone a billion times until they were Instagram perfect because the person posting it needed something perfect. Which totally undermines the heart of bullet journals. They're sloppy. They're full of mistakes. They're meant to be organic and develop over time, not be perfect."
StardewValley,fcvdbka,t1_fcvd8bc,1577999714.0,I only started mine a few months ago! I just bought some stickers to help spruce it up lol
StardewValley,fcvd9fk,t1_fcvd2n2,1577999679.0,"Oh it definitely is! And personally speaking, I have a lot of anxiety around to-do lists and feeling pressure to fill out a pre-made planner and that I'm gonna screw it up, but my bullet journal is personal. I don't feel bad messing it up because its mine, for me. Heck, I skipped last month because I was way too busy but I just picked it back up this month and I'm not worried about it because I'm the only one who sees it"
StardewValley,fcvcuaq,t1_fcvckfx,1577999425.0,"Its basically a sort of planner but its fully based on your needs because you design it. For me, I track my daily habits, my spending, and appointments and such. I also have pages dedicated to writing down all the books I read in a year or tracking my savings.

A lot of people would prefer to just buy their planners, but for me, I like being able to shape mine to exactly what I need. So I don't really use or need weekly planners, but most planner comes with them. So rather than search and pay a lot, I just make my own. At the start of each month I take some time and I plan out each month and what design I want to do. Personally, it can be a bit of work, but for me its a creative thing that I find relaxing."
StardewValley,fcvc3gy,t1_fcvc1dl,1577998978.0,H\*ck yeah imma rep my boi! He's legit my favorite NPC and the fact I can't be his friend hurts me.
StardewValley,fcvc0qt,t1_fcv9y3a,1577998933.0,Thank you! I'm working on my habit tracker page next and its gonna be mining themed with gems and prismatic shards and stuff!
