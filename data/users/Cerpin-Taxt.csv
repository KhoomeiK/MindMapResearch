instant_regret,fedd5g9,t1_fedd1yh,1579008150.0,> That's a BMI of 22.31 and that is on the upper side of normal
instant_regret,fedcvzw,t1_fedcm9e,1579007917.0,"Average doesn't mean healthy or ideal. You are aware of the global obesity epidemic yes?

The *ideal* weight for a 5'9 male is between 125 and 169 lbs"
instant_regret,fedcein,t1_fedccpt,1579007483.0,It's not.
instant_regret,fedc7vr,t1_fedc2vh,1579007320.0,"That's a BMI of 22.31 and that is on the upper side of normal. 5'11 is also above average height. 

Go punch it into any bmi calculator you like.

Healthy weight for a 5'11 male is 132-179"
instant_regret,fedbzbg,t1_fedbx3y,1579007102.0,Nope. It's close to overweight for a grown man of average height.
instant_regret,fedbvbs,t1_fedbq4b,1579007001.0,Wrong. It's close to overweight. That's how far off your frame of reference has shifted.
instant_regret,fedbkgp,t1_fedbcnw,1579006719.0,"It's not, its on the upper side of normal."
instant_regret,fedbax2,t1_fedawzv,1579006472.0,"You're actually overweight. This is what I'm talking about, everyone's perception is ridiculously skewed."
instant_regret,fedb0eo,t1_fedawel,1579006191.0,A 5'10 man at 180 lbs is clinically overweight.
instant_regret,fedaspn,t1_fedaelu,1579005988.0,The guy I'm replying to and everyone responding to me seem to disagree with you.
instant_regret,fedaq2j,t1_fedahse,1579005916.0,"6´ is above average height and you could lose 15 lbs from 160 at that height and still be considered ideal. So yeah, it's not light. 160lbs at 5'9 is pushing overweight."
instant_regret,fedafm8,t1_fedaazs,1579005635.0,BMI calculator says you're obese so your view is probably a bit skewed yeah.

instant_regret,fed9pfh,t1_fed9ar3,1579004898.0,"I find it really funny when americans say someone is ""160 lbs"" like that's light."
pcmasterrace,fe9kdnb,t1_fe9j71x,1578938649.0,"If you want to go cheap as possible it makes sense to buy a consumer card, but there are far better workstation cards than anything in the GTX series is my point, they're not made for that market, they're made for gaming."
pcmasterrace,fe84yxo,t1_fe84e2v,1578922636.0,"Read the rest of the comment. 

It's not about me or you, it's about the fact they're overpricing their products to the point that they're pushing themselves out of the market. 

I could buy one right now if I wanted to, heck I could buy a couple, doesn't change the fact it's not worth what they're asking for it. 

It was only a couple years ago their equivalent flagship card cost a quarter of what they're asking now."
pcmasterrace,fe842dz,t1_fe80sjx,1578922295.0,"You're not listening to me. 

1. It's not their best, they could make better and charge more than this is they wanted to, as evidenced buy their commercial cards not their gaming series. 

2. The reason they don't is the same reason these cards are selling badly. They'd be too expensive for the market they're in. 

3. You're incredibly naive if you think these are mostly being bought by gamers who don't mind the price. Miners are buying them, miners are solely responsible for the 200% price hike that occurred overnight that had a knock on effect on the price of all other products. 

> I think you need to see it from more than your own point of view, and realise that there are a lot of people out there with a lot of money that wants to play games

You need to see it from a wider perspective outside your bubble. There aren't a lot of people with a lot of money who want to play games. There are a lot of people with *some* money who want to play games, but rich gamers who can afford to spend over 10% of the national average annual wage on video games are few. 

Pricing yourself out of your own market is a bad decision and it's entirely based on greed. The only reason things are the way they are is because of other greedy people using these products for things other than their intended pupose. This isn't a natural market phenomenon. This is tearing down homes to rip the copper out the walls to turn for a profit."
pcmasterrace,fe7xrcl,t1_fe7tahp,1578920337.0,"Then why even make it? The 2080ti is not the most powerful card they can make right now. It's not pushing the limits of their capabilities, that work is done for other sectors. They could have made it much much more powerful and much much more expensive, but they don't because 99.999% of people wouldn't be able to afford that for what is essentially a toy. The GTX series in it's entirety, yes even the 80tis, are products for the hobby mass market. If it's price tag puts it out of that demographic's range it's a failure of a product. 

It's only real functionality is for playing video games, and the number of people who want to spend >$4,000 all in on a video game platform that'll be obsolete in 5 years is close to nil. 

Toys should cost what toys are worth, not the price of a used car. It's like they're trying to sell upmarket supersoakers for $1.5k no one wants that, its absurd. Anyone who actually needs a handheld device to shoot water beyond the capabilities of a toy can get an actual commercial device for that price."
pcmasterrace,fe7qtqb,t1_fe6scxs,1578918117.0,They are consumer cards for the masses though. The 2080ti is not the most powerful card nvidia makes. It's the most powerful *gaming* card. Professional industry doesn't use the GTX series at all. What's the point of making you flagship gaming card unavailable to the people who play games the most i.e. students and part time workers.

yesyesyesno,fe3cumh,t1_fe3arj9,1578848127.0,All that'll do is make the bottle less stable. It makes no other difference. Better to let go of the cork than the bottle.
yesyesyesno,fe34559,t1_fe2m2qt,1578845768.0,You'd be surprised how sober people think a bottle of champagne should be opened. At arms length barely cradling the mouth with both hands trying to push the cork off with both thumbs aiming directly at someone else's face.
educationalgifs,fe263yx,t1_fe24wpj,1578834879.0,"Yes I'm aware. What I'm saying is you're unlikely to have lost enough for a turkey neck by 30. If you do have one by then you probably always did in some form or another, or you have loose skin from weight changes."
educationalgifs,fe1z7hp,t1_fe1vfjo,1578832629.0,"If you have a turkey neck at 30 I don't think you can blame aging for that. That's bad genetic luck or a weight thing. 

It takes quite a lot of age related skin sagging to get to turkey neck stage, you don't normally see it in people under 50."
yesyesyesno,fe1wyse,t1_fe1w9wr,1578831852.0,I suspect I've opened more bottles of champagne than you've even seen so I'd take the advice if I were you.
yesyesyesno,fe1slmb,t1_fe1e1lp,1578830386.0,"Bottle on the hip, one hand on the neck, one hand inverted on the cork like you're unsheathing a sword, twist and pull but mostly twist. This method works for even the most stubborn corks, the cork isn't pointing upwards towards anyone's face, if the cork does fly it'll hit your body or go behind you not into the people you're serving, but it won't fly because you have it tightly gripped in your hand. If the bottle froths you still have the cork right by the mouth to stop spillage. You also have a good comfortable grip on the bottle neck, the strongest part of the bottle, rather than trying to extend your hand around the wide body of it which would make you likely to lose grip. 

Firing corks into the air is childish and dangerous and only twats do it."
