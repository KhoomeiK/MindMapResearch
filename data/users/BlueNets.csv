howtonotgiveafuck,ff5iu6v,t1_ff54cet,1579594873.0,And here are you also clearly giving a fuck enough to comment and complain. Oh the irony.
Wakandapeopletwitter,ff54alx,t3_eqzw06,1579579832.0,Nah some of them don’t even do that and they still get hate. Saquon Barkley and CJ McCollum get harassed in their Instagram comment sections for their wives and they haven’t insulted black women. But Serena always gets congratulated for her white man. It’s hypocritical asl.
