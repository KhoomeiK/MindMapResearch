dogs,fcxbdxe,t3_ej93p4,1578058200.0,I'm so sorry!  I have a dog who currently has cancer and we are waiting for the day he tells us he's done.  These days are precious and he gets all the treats and goodies he wants.  Prayers for comfort for you and your pup.
dogs,fcve1gj,t3_ej2bgr,1578000144.0,Congrats on your new pup!  I foster for a local rescue who ships our pets to Vermont. It has been an very rewarding experience and I get to follow my pups all the way to their new homes and some I even follow afterward as well.
