summonerschool,fddhvws,t1_fdd4k6a,1578312954.0,"Meh, I actually dislike HOW the game is played in normals vs ranked, it is actually really annoying to play with and against people ranting about you doing dives , rotations, flashy predictions or camping because ""dude chill it's a normal""

Think of it as the difference between playing poker with and without any money involved. People don't play smart or patiently so the half the essence of the game is lost there.

I used to have some limbo periods of the seasons where I didn't feel like ranking because I was playing poorly but wanted to rank, luckily now I can flex with friends and it's so fun how everyone take so seriously even though the matchmaking is the same fiesta as normal"
