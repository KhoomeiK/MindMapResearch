SuicideWatch,ff91rc5,t1_ff5qdin,1579702688.0,"It is so kind of you to say, about my message. I haven't met many practicioners of the Tao, but from only the few encounters I've had, they've always been wise and thoughtful. I'm always pleased when our paths cross. One of my teachers actually illustrates bits of buddhist wisdom with stories about Lao Tzu (because true wisdom is universal, and the names and labels we put on things hardly matter), and I enjoy them very much.

I decided to wait for a while, before replying and making it about myself, to see if something would change here. It's quite possible I missed him by a few hours, but this is how things go, we are all on our own path. It was obvious to me that he was actually looking out for something that he wasn't already aware of. Some wisdom and unconditionnal love and kindness seemed like a good bet (but when is it not?).

Here is the teaching that always repeats itself for me, and that I see in my experience, even right here. The more we make things exclusively about ourselves, the more intensely we experience suffering. The more we train ourselves to be selfless, the more satisfaction we get in return (no matter how counter-intuitive it seems to be at first glance). The concept of selflessness is something that most of the -apparently- very young people in this sub are completely missing (just like I did when I was their age, unfortunately, because nobody showed it to me, and because our society trains/tricks us to want to go in the opposite direction).

Take good care of your own well-being, my mindful friend. You know how important that is, not only for yourself but for others around you."

The funny thing is, that in reality you probably are the most perfect person for the job.

How and what things are for us, always depends so heavily upon the way we chose to look at them. A thing is, but whether it will appear brighter or darker for us, can depend for the most part on what kind of light we chose to shine on it.

I understand that in this case you were only replying to me, but I wish for you to know not to doubt yourself too much (that, and I like talking too much to refrain myself from writing it). From the little I've seen of your actions, you are on the right path (but who am I to talk, right? :) ). It just takes a good bit of patience, for all of us. Mostly to work on that perspective/point-of-view of ours, and to learn how to create something better with it (always in our mind first).

Stay strong, friendly Internet Stranger. Also, we are not alone or completely isolated (don't know if you need to hear that, I sometimes do)."

I am, thank you. My entire perception gets twisted sometimes, and reality suddenly gets completely grim as a result, but now it doesn't happen more than once every few weeks. It used to happen way more often than that, when I was a bit younger. It lasts around 12 hours (+ more hours for a complete emotional reset) and doesn't entirely depends on me (which is both good to understand and frustrating, but hey). Aside from that, I've been working on my mental quite a bit for a few years now, so I tend to be okay in general. It just hits me like a ton of bricks when I don't expect it, and I don't necessarily catch in the moment that it's *actually* happening (but even when I understand, I still have to go through the process anyway).

Dogs and pets in general are so great, because they teach us what unconditionnal love is. :) No matter what you do or think of yourself, they'll just love you without condition, and be happy for the smallest silliest things. I guess they also teach us to be kind, and how to practice kindness, because they make it pretty easy for us to be kind and loving to them. Such great teachers! I'm so glad you found him, and I have no doubt that he's over the moon to have you, my friend. I've been thinking about it for years, but until now it has scared me too much to imagine myself being completely responsible for the life of another being (especially such an innocent one - and I'm sorry if that last sentence could make you anxious, by the way, it is only ever my own perspective).

Such action is basically demonstrating to someone, and planting the seed in the very fertile soil of their mind, that they should absolutely convert to something else, or at least run away from something... isn't it? :) This is so counter-productive.

Who would submit themselves to that over-reaching level of control? It never works...

>since she just *loves* seeing what I'm doing all the time.

>She recently put a tracking app (Life 360) on my phone and has  threatened to deactivate my phone plan if I turn off location  permissions.

This is way, WAY too much. I'm so sorry this has happened to you, my poor friend. She effectively created a prison for you. I am also sorry for your dear mother, who is apparently struggling to find her love (and what about her faith?), obfuscated under that need to control how others behave at all times, which is a mighty source of suffering (as is the delusion that makes us think that other beings belong to us, and that they are our property). That karma she is creating right now will bear fruit, some later day, and it will unfortunately taste very sour (one doesn't even have to be a buddhist to understand it).

Because, as you demonstrate so aptly, we cannot control other beings (especially not through violence, as is the case here, it is only ever on the surface that they are being controlled, and they are, naturally, soon to try and find an escape, from the moment they understand that they are trapped).

Ultimately, I think she can hardly know unless you tell her.

She is not in the secret of your heart, and if the Buddha's statue didn't clue her up, nothing will. Probably short of seeing you walk into the temple, but even then maybe you can say you were accompanying a very good friend (isn't the Buddha a very good friend?). You also don't have to be a buddhist to meditate, for example, plenty of people meditate just to relax, these days. So she can't really make that connection either... I think that she cannot penetrate your heart on the matter unless you invite her in. Parents tend play on the fact, that they will make you believe they know all your secrets, but they don't. I know more people that are burning incense while not being buddhists than the contrary (I dislike it myself): have no fear, my friend, she just cannot enter your heart by effraction in such a way.

But I understand that the little lies are weighting on you. This makes complete sense. Repeated little lies always end up becoming one big lie. But apparently, the only thing you can do is to try to minimize them for now.

I don't know if anyone would advise you to be completely honest with her. Honesty is complicated, because she is your mother, and you perfectly explained why it would be complicated (tracking others is definitely not okay, as is having to justify your every moves, I feel so sorry for you; you should just be allowed to live your life and not have to ask an authorization for it). When you will be more independent from her, maybe. In an ideal world, this would never happen, because she is deluding herself and creating suffering for both you and her (an obvious, **very obvious** suffering); but an ideal world this never is. If you practice correctly, you will soon understand that you are more advanced than her spiritually. This should never be a source for resentment towards her, but a source for compassion. If it can lighten your heart to know, her behavior will always be a reminder that being fully trusting, compassionate and loving is the only proper way to behave towards our loved ones... So, you could say that she is showing you the way, your loving mother, without even knowing it. How nice of her, how inspiring, isn't it? :) Maybe. Is she a Bodhisattva in disguise?

**Realistically speaking, that tracking app is a real logistical problem.** Not only that, but it is **deeply** hurting your relationship with your mother. I can see **no trust here, only control**. Since this isn't even related to buddhism, perhaps you can tell her that? No matter how you feel (you might be justifying in your mind that she is right to track you down, because of what is happening, but you shouldn't even relate the two), this is never justified. What about some legcuffs, so you can't run too far? You are litteraly being kept under surveillance, and blackmailed on top of it. This just isn't right. How far have people fallen in 2020 with technology... I understand that reasoning is hardly an option with that kind of person, because they specifically don't want you to use reason (that could set you free, therefore goes against what she stands for - which is entirely unreasonable in itself, and they *always* know it). What if you were to debate about it, by using christian teachings? (I am pretty sure they say nothing about submitting others to our will, but rather speak about love and freedom from oppression) She doesn't seem to apply them very well herself to begin with, so maybe you could come out ahead on that front (and/or she will have to admit to you, that she isn't actually very dedicated to Jesus/Yeoshua's teachings, that good kind-hearted friend who almost certainly wouldn't have stood for this).

My compassion levels are through the roof for you, because I understand how much this must hurt, and how little choice you feel you have... You have all my sympathies, my friend. As you have my respect and my trust, for all it's worth."

>Not that I'm malicious or anything, just a fucking pain to be around.

Would you be able to understand that this is speaking of the relationship that you have with yourself, more than anything? As you say yourself, you aren't bad, therefore the only problem is probably that bad relationship you have with yourself.

Try to impress yourself rather than other people. Why? Because other people will come and go in your life, they are there now, but won't be the moment after (and that moment after will come soon enough, even if it doesn't feel like it now). But *you,* for yourself, are for ever. Therefore, it only makes sense to only focus on impressing yourself, and to be a kind-hearted friend to yourself (which, would you believe it, is actually something that tends to attract other people sometimes).

Hang in there, my friend. I'm sure you are a badass. It's just that school years can be very uncivilized, but they eventually pass; you look back, and they are nowhere to be found, were never important in the first place. What's important, then? Why, yourself, of course. The rest barely matters, in the grand scheme of things. But the relationship you can build with yourself? This is for ever. Allow yourself this, make a truce with yourself. If it isn't love yet, it might become just that someday. You can perhaps operate in gradual steps, and set up to simply tolerate and respect you as a person, for starters, which is realistically the minimum that you deserve and should expect from yourself (or from anybody else, for that matter). Also, nothing can keep you from giving yourself a quick smile when you happen to glance at yourself in mirrors. Why? Well, because it's only natural to smile to a good friend, isn't it? It doesn't matter what we think we look like, a genuinely good friend won't care about that, they only care about if we are happy.

You are 20 years old. For someone who is nearing 40, you are still a baby who doesn't really know what they are doing, and we tend to see you as such (we are just shy enough not to mention it point blank in front of you, my friend, because we know how serious most of you are, about your perceived adulthood). You may like to think of yourself as an adult, but you haven't finished your adolescence yet, sorry to break the illusion (but also, not sorry). Should you decide to stick around, you are guaranteed to look back at yourself, 20 years from now, and ask ""Holy crap, what the hell was I thinking?"".

Your growth isn't finished yet, young man. Take it from a nearly 40 years old, and call me patronizing if you'd enjoy that (but that would be looking at the finger, and not at what the finger is actually pointing to; are you aware of that saying?). I only started to become what I would call an adult when I was around 24-25 years old (*started* being the key word). Before that, pieces of your puzzle are still completely missing, that you don't even know they are missing: because you can't feasibly know, and such is our ignorance when we are young. Your brain itself haven't even finished to grow yet, do you think this not affecting you in any way? Of course, you would probably think it doesn't, because you only have your brain to think with, but you would be wrong. You are playing a game for which you don't have all the cards for, do not be surprised to find yourself losing. In many ways, you are still meant to be taken care of, *to be cared for*. And you should probably allow your mother to do that for you (no matter how much of a monster you made yourself think you were; don't you find it a least a bit annoying how we all tend to do that?). If not your mother, someone who would still be willing to care, if you are lucky enough to have them (and you would be; we always are lucky to have them).

You are to be gentle to yourself, my *oh-so-young* friend. And, if there is people who happen to genuinely love you for who you are, despite all of your perceived flaws, you are to be gentle to them also. That is our only task. Make peace, be kind. Allow yourself to grow out of this, and maybe have a small glimpse at the fact that, there is no reason to hate yourself. Those are only your growing pains.

May you be at ease, now. Would you think me harsh, for telling you the truth? On the contrary, I feel as much affection for you as any stranger can feel for another stranger on the Internet. I understand suffering, and I see yours. You wrote it well, by the way. Which tells me that you are more intelligent than you would think, if you were only to judge yourself by your past actions (you shouldn't; you shouldn't even identify with them). Which tells me that you actually know what you should do. I wish you a peaceful day, my friend. You can always come and talk to this ancient patronizing buddhist, if you feel like it. For the future, I would advise you to cling to what exactly inside you pushed you to write this post, because it is what will help you.

If a suicidal person is being told that it ""gets better"" repeatedly, and often enough, I'd say it's a safe bet that they will develop a form of guilt and shame from not actually getting better (because if it ""gets better"", it means for everyone without discrimination. So they themselves must not be good enough, they must do something wrong, for them to not actually get better; or perhaps they'll think that they are cursed somehow). Also, they will simply tend to shut up about it, if they know for sure than what they are being told doesn't match with their experience (which will also reinforce the other person's delusions that it is, in fact, ""getting better"": in this case because they'll hear about it less).

I would say that saying it gets better does more harm than good. It's likely used as an easy way out, by the person talking to the suicidal one (possibly also a form of self-gratification). The root of the problem for me, is people trying to ""help"" for the wrong reasons (to not feel that they themselves are powerless = EGO), and actually lacking the intelligence to properly see the ramifications of their actions (sorry to be brutaly honest, but lack of intelligence in people is definitely a problem, and unfortunately not one that we can directly do much about)."

I think it is very beneficial to make ourselves fully understand that anger is a feeling that never reaches its target. Therefore, anger doesn't accomplish what would be its supposed purpose. We are only ever making *ourselves* feel miserable, and we are making the wrong diagnostic that the cause is on the outside of us. It isn't: we are creating that inner feeling of anger, which has for consequence to make *us* feel miserable. The feeling of anger never touches the outside world at any point, nor does the outside world touches it.

We get angry at the outside world, because we are making the assumption that we are being treated unfairly in some manner. You are assuming that your father is treating you and others unfairly, therefore you allow yourself to create that anger within you: because, from your perspective, you are justified in doing so.

But play with that perspective of yours. Go ahead and move it around: look at things under different angles, not only from the fixed angle that you assume is yours.

Is your father treating others and himself unfairly? Who is actually that being, who is your father, I ask? He is someone who happens to be on his own path to investigate suffering, and he is doing it thoroughly, like we all have to. He doesn't deserve to be judged, for he is a being who is walking the exact same path as you, the path leading towards the end of suffering. You are making the wrong assumption, that you can allow yourself to be angry at him, because he is less advanced than you are on the path. When, where he is along that path, doesn't depend upon you, and barely depends upon him at all. With Right View, the delusions of that being, are to be properly understood as suffering, and that analysis becomes the cause for the arising of compassion, loving-kindness, within one upholding Right View.

Be ever mindful of the Intention which made you ask this question, for it is a manifestation of your own mind, who's trying to guide you towards the proper way of looking at things, in order to lessen your own suffering in this life. Anything your father does, cannot lessen your own suffering, only you can. You are to be gentle to yourself first, in order to be able to act appropriately towards others. Be more kind to yourself, practice the method as it is to be practiced, and you might find that the feeling of love you were looking for, will arise as the natural consequence of your actions."

You cannot be confrontational about it, because that attitude would be (is always) counter-productive. The more force you apply, the more resistance from her you will generate, mechanically.

If you cannot really interact with her present-self, perhaps you can set up to interact with her wiser, future-self, why not? You already know that she will change from what she is right now, anyway, nothing can stay the same (*Anicca*). Why not assume by default that she will eventually get wiser, and interact with that version of her, through her present-self? It is only a matter of time before she choses to change herself into something else, you know this.

And what should be the nature of those interactions with her future-self? Showing kindness to her right now, a form of understanding and acceptance of what she is, and to care for her whatever her choices end up being. Especially if she makes bad ones, her delusions should be understood as suffering, and only fuel your compassion. To truly take care of her, you actually have to take care of yourself in this present moment. If you are making yourself suffer (*First Noble Truth*) through your desire to change her, even for what you think is the better (*Second Noble Truth*), you cannot (will not) teach her anything but that suffering of yours. She will see it (what you call hypocrisy) for what it is, and she will have to conclude that the buddhist method to ease one's sufferings doesn't work, as she would have seen it fail first hand.

You already know what you have to do. Follow the Noble Eightfold Path. Ever work on your Right View, Right Intention and Right Action towards her. If what happens to her is of the utmost importance to you, make yourself understand that following the Eightfold Path laid by the Buddha is, therefore, of the utmost importance to you. We cannot change people directly, we have to take a detour to simply allow them to change themselves. Keep investigating the end of suffering. You are doing it not only for your own well-being, but for the well-being of that dear child of yours. How inspiring, is it not? You are not a random person on the street, you are a disciple of the Great Buddha, the Awakened One; treat yourself in a way that would be fitting for one such as you.

What will likely happen is: she will end up growing out of whatever she is into right now and, perhaps one day, like we did before her, she will stop looking outward for an escape from her own suffering. Of whom, do you suppose, will she think then? Who will come to mind, that she knows for having already solved that conundrum before her, that can maybe help her, or give her some form of guidance, with whatever trouble she will be having? That's right, you! She will perhaps think of you, and ask herself how you did it, with her mind mentally evoking your example in her memories. You only have to make yourself available for this through your actions right now.

Be ever vigilant of your own mental well-being, then, for you are setting an example. Not teaching through your words, but teaching through your actions, which will be coming from your Right Intention, which will be coming from your Right View. Be good, be kind, uphold virtue, make peace. Create that good karma, for you and for her. Mindfully plant that seed, and trust that it will eventually grow into a tree to bear delicious fruits. Set up to become that Noble One in her future memories right now. The Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha are your refuges, and you can count on them. You know what you are doing, therefore there is nothing to worry about.

Certainly. The buddhist method helps one not to identify with their negative thoughts and feelings. I would say that simply gaining that understanding -that we are not those- would end up being pretty great for anybody.

Given what you say, I'd suggest listening to some ""Dhamma talks"", to start (gently) deepening your understanding. Look up for Ajahn Brahm on YouTube, and pick a video title that sparks your interest (be it depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts... whatever it is). In other words, slowly start acquainting yourself with other buddhists, beyond mere books, to see what is really up with them, and lend your ears to some legit teachers for a while (the Internet being as good as any place for at least a first step, and also a great ressource on the matter)."

When your own inability to control others stares you that much in the face, it's just that easier to gain the profound understanding that the only thing you can act upon / have control over, is your own reaction to the events in your life, in other words how you chose to relate to them. I understand that I could be angry about it, and make my own life miserable (*Dukkha*) in the process as a consequence, so I just don't (*Third Noble Truth*).

I also think that it obviously goes way beyond the scope of the video game industry. Would you fancy somebody actually replying to you, instead of glancing over words on a screen, and quickly moving on to something else, like is the custom on places like Reddit, where everything can feel meaningless some times?

The ""Us versus Them"" mentality has always been cultivated and encouraged on a large scale, in order to generate control and profit from regular people. This mentality can probably be more efficiently propagated now than ever before. Therefore, and unfortunately, the people you specifically talked about are but a symptom in the grand scheme of things. They do what they do, because they took a habit of seeing things through that lense, that perspective. They simply came to think that it was appropriate. The tendency towards tribalism and communautarism is within us, but it is also something that is forced upon us, and leveraged against us, at the societal level.

The way to counter-balance it is probably with the cultivation of morality, to reach a simple understanding of what behavior is actually beneficial for us and others, and what isn't; and at the very least giving others the same respect and consideration that we would like them to give us. But, coincidentaly, morality is also something that is being discouraged on a large scale, obviously because amorality, and moral lawlessness, happen to be a more efficient tool of exploitation right now.

I also agree with your last paragraph that idolatry is an obvious negative behavior, in terms of causes & consequences, for an individual and the people around them. But that same behavior is also encouraged and cultivated on a large scale, from the places of power, all the way down through basic peer pressure. If one actively rejects morality, they are likely to partake in this negative behavior, if only because they won't understand, nor clearly see, what harm it does to them and others around them.

I guess my point is, ultimately, that people will behave stupidly (which doesn't mean that I consider that they themselves are stupid, people are also simply what they make themselves to be), but a good part of that tendency towards stupidity also comes from a place that most of them are completely oblivious and unaware of (even worse: they actively do not want it to exist). We are, as a whole, way more receptive to outside influence that we would like to admit. All it takes is simple training through repetition, to reinforce a certain behavior. No Free-Will to be found, there. And very little Free-Will overall, actually. The vast majority of us will think that we only act out of that supposed Free-Will of ours when, in reality, we are always encouraged and trained by third parties to behave in certain ways, at all times (especially in this day and age, even though it always happened). It's ironic, because the people who see themselves as ""rebels"", but have never developped their own spirituality and inner strenght, will have very little self-agency and control, relatively to how they behave in the world. Perhaps they could ask people like Edward Bernays what they think of their individual self-agency."

It is counter-productive to the goal one would actually contemplate suicide for. One committing self-annihilation does not leaves their sufferings behind, therefore suicide is not a viable option to put an end to those sufferings, and loses its assumed purpose.

""I am the owner of my actions, heir of my actions, actions are the womb (from which I have sprung), actions are my relations, actions are my protection. Whatever actions I do, good or bad, of these I shall become the heir."" (Anguttara Nikaya)

Killing ourselves would be one such action, and the sum of our actions (*Kamma*/*Karma*) follows us into our next rebirth. Every action has a consequence, every seed we plant eventually bears fruit, sweet or sour. Suicide is one such action, therefore suicide has consequences.

Also to note: the mindset of the dying person at the moment of death influences where they will get to be reborn. It is fair to say that most people committing suicide have an *extremely bad* minset at the moment of their death, which in turn will influence the place of their next rebirth in a huge way."

You are not even factually incorrect, because things can indeed be interpreted as you did. Nor were you overly confrontational about it, as your following comments are showing. The ultimate proof of your genuine goodwill is that you ended up apologizing for the people who made the choice to take your words without a grain of salt and without humor.

But that isn't on you, it's on them. You cannot take responsibility for the way others chose to react to you (especially if you have reasons to believe that they won't necessarily be entirely honest about it, as is often the case with people when they have an argument). If other people make the choice to give away to a third party their personal responsibility in how they act towards that same third party, it is entirely their problem to deal with, not yours. Do not accept that gift, they shall keep it. Others are never the cause of our own actions: we are. As such, any consequence of those same actions should be understood as being fully ours; they are not to be given away in order to avoid responsibility.

Who cares about Mass Effect 2, in the end. The only thing that matters is how people chose to treat each other, and how they chose to relate to one another at any given moment."
