helpme,ffeny3u,t1_ffenx9w,1579856587.0,Do you have any relatives that you could possibly stay with?
helpme,ffenqae,t3_et7ea1,1579856267.0,"Wait. You’re 13. I know it sucks to hear, but don’t you want to know what’s past your hometown/state? Don’t you want to try and travel the world?  Life sucks right now and it probably will for a while, but that doesn’t mean it always will. It won’t just magically get better. You have to fight for it. You have to strive for it. If you can make it to 18, you can literally chase happiness however you want. Not saying drugs, alcohol, etc. I’m talking about go into the world and see what it has to offer. Experience diversity! You are strong. You may not feel it at the moment, but you can overcome this. It can be temporary if you fight tooth and nail for as long as you can. One day, you may look back and be happy that you didn’t end anything. It won’t be easy. It won’t be quick. But it will be rewarding. Look for anything That makes you smile. Use it. Start there as your first brick, then find another. Build your path. You can do it! I believe in you!!"

It is extremely difficult and I wouldn’t wish it on Hitler himself. It’s emotionally draining and Very difficult to do. I wish you the best, friend. They say time is an awesome healer."

AskReddit,fep5x6j,t3_eq1wzh,1579312849.0,"To be completely honest, I have no idea...I kinda want to say that someone special, but she’s going through a lot and it wouldn’t make me completely happy bc only time can do that. I was doing great, but my biggest fear came true. Maybe if I could get a win, whether it be with me or to help someone else, I would start on the path. I’m not sure until then. Maybe answers? If I had to name one thing that would bring me the most happiness, I guess it would be control over my emotions. I’m not really sure and I’ve began to ramble, but I feel that I should post it or it wouldn’t be off of my chest."

I have a vision of what I want to look like, feel like, think like, talk like, etc. I’m done wanting other’s validations. I’m going for it. I’m going to educate myself on depression (I don’t have it but a friend does). Work out regularly (reach my goal appearance). Meditate (hopefully at least every other day). And stop procrastinating. I’m going to hold myself accountable and I’m going to see it through. I got this!!!!"

Supernatural,fcrvecv,t1_fcpoq7e,1577907133.0,"I didn’t think about most of this at all so thank you for that. The comment about Dean enjoying the small things really got me because I never thought of it like that. I just assumed he was always hungry and really enjoyed cartoons. This definitely makes me appreciate their strength more. As for the Sam taking control, I meant there was nobody physically helping him. Although I do see where he had the help without a doubt."
Supernatural,fcrugj3,t1_fcqb2qm,1577906765.0,True
Supernatural,fcruegk,t1_fcr14xn,1577906744.0,True. It’s definitely had its wear and tear on Dean
Supernatural,fcoz683,t1_fcotepm,1577845652.0,True
Supernatural,fcoz272,t1_fcownun,1577845562.0,The character development is absolutely amazing!!
Supernatural,fcoyzie,t1_fcoyszl,1577845503.0,Oh for sure. I’m not taking anything away from either one. I strive to be able to overcome things in the way they do
Supernatural,fcor8ng,t1_fcoqdqu,1577839398.0,"Yea. I also figure that having had a part of an outside life from hunting and then having it ripped away would make him more mentally strong, but then again the same thing happened to Dean with the exception that his family didn’t die, they just had their memory of him taken away. Could you imagine knowing they’re out there and not contacting them?"
Supernatural,fcomr0z,t1_fcoml6u,1577836129.0,"That’s what I say, but my friend sees it as being too weak to kill yourself but wanting to die anyway. I don’t agree with that but it’s his opinion"
Supernatural,fcomnq4,t1_fcoetgp,1577836064.0,Either make you stronger or completely break you.
Supernatural,fcomln4,t1_fcoef8j,1577836024.0,This is very true. I would just like to say that you’re my hero and I believe you can pick up whoever you want wherever you are.
Supernatural,fcomj93,t1_fcoffiw,1577835978.0,I agree with the last sentence. I could definitely see Sam as being more resistant to torturing people
Supernatural,fcomcie,t1_fcogmbw,1577835844.0,If you say so
Supernatural,fcombyk,t1_fcom6xk,1577835832.0,Yessss
Supernatural,fcombih,t1_fcom3ji,1577835823.0,I never looked at it that way. I guess that would be one of the situational questions that I thought I was avoiding. Thank you for your answer.
Supernatural,fcom3zm,t1_fcogtiv,1577835672.0,"That’s true. Personally, I’m going with Dean is stronger because I see myself and him"
Supernatural,fcom0yx,t1_fcoisd4,1577835610.0,"I wouldn’t doubt it. It sounds familiar, but I can’t swear to it. Either that or killing is definitely his go to"
Supernatural,fcodqru,t1_fcobikx,1577829750.0,"I’ve never looked at it that way. Reminds me of when he had Lisa and Ben, he drove himself crazy needing to fight something. It’s literally who he is."
Supernatural,fcodmfz,t1_fcocxq4,1577829665.0,"That sounds awesome!! I can’t pull off leather, I tried to wear a jacket similar to his but it didn’t work out..."
Supernatural,fcoav8b,t1_fco37sc,1577827751.0,"That’s what I was leaning towards, but didn’t want to admit it. I see myself in Dean and my roommate in Sam, so I was hoping I/Dean would win"
Supernatural,fcoarpn,t1_fco1ef8,1577827683.0,That’s right...forgot he was a massive douche for a bit
Supernatural,fcoa1zu,t1_fco2gre,1577827193.0,"True. Although with Eileen in the picture now, I could see Sam as continuing the life whether Dean was around or not but it would most likely depend on if she continued or not."
Supernatural,fco9wai,t1_fco4p1b,1577827085.0,"True. The argument I made for that one to myself was that Dean locked Michael in a “closet” in his mind for quite a while. Sure he had help to get him in there, but nobody helped him keep him locked up."
Supernatural,fco9tca,t1_fco9mj6,1577827026.0,That’s valid. Depends on the episode at this point.
Supernatural,fco9re5,t1_fco98ks,1577826988.0,"For sure. They also tried to show Sam as being the stronger of the 2, but many times it looked as if he overloaded himself which was when they had to fix him."
Supernatural,fco9lrt,t1_fcnzfo5,1577826881.0,I never thought of it in the soldier sense. That’s a good observation. I’m extremely happy they’ve developed his character since the first 5 seasons.  I also forgot about Sam being screwed for leaning on others for support. I think the reason he does that is because Dean was always there for Sam to lean on. Dean had no one to lean on and open up to.
Supernatural,fco9diw,t1_fcnwrbi,1577826728.0,I see that. I always knew that Sam was more in touch with his feelings where Dean just kinda “ignore and override” to the best of his ability.
Supernatural,fco95v6,t1_fco7xey,1577826584.0,True. I admire them both for at least attempting to do the right thing after everything they’ve been through.
Supernatural,fco9311,t1_fco8s2i,1577826531.0,"I think that’s why I’ve given this debate as much thought as I have in my head. I’m also biased towards Dean, but I don’t dislike Sam. I would have to say that Dean has also went to the dark side (mostly with the mark of Cain) and Sam fought to get him back. But it’s true that Sam has made more “mistakes” and Dean has forgiven him every time and brought him back. I like that you put the forgiveness aspect in there. Thank you for your answer."
Supernatural,fcnwqek,t1_fcnwox7,1577819975.0,Wouldn’t doubt it...
Supernatural,fcnw8ez,t1_fcnw6st,1577819687.0,Deeper than that whole lotta nothing he had...too soon?
Supernatural,fcnvyrn,t1_fcnv5u2,1577819527.0,You could see the realization in Dean’s eyes when he said it too...💔
Supernatural,fcnvv65,t1_fcnv91c,1577819467.0,"I wouldn’t flame you. I agree with the cage thing. Personally, I like Dean more because I like to think I am sorta like him, ya know? So I try to find ways to make Dean out to win most things but this is one that I’m not sure Dean could win. I have talked about the cage with a friend of mine and he mentioned that Death put up the wall in Sam’s mind and then Cas completely transferred it to him. He made the point that Sam didn’t really do anything other than breakdown at that point, but to me, that doesn’t make him weak. I figure if it were me, I’d try to end myself tbh. So that makes him stronger in my eyes. I do agree with the 2 halves of a whole part of your comment. They are literally ying and yang. Thanks for your answer."
Supernatural,fcnvdus,t1_fcnujke,1577819186.0,"To be fair, Dean did take responsibility for everything in the first part of the show. The biggest time that I can think of him blaming Cas (at least recently) is with the death of Mary and Rowena. Which Rowena dying was partially Cas’ fault but not really. That was a situational case. Dean was still hurting from the death of Mary mostly so he was blinded and only cared to see a part of it. I do agree that he’s been putting a lot of responsibility on Cas when Dean was also to blame. Personally, I think the main person to blame for Mary’s death was Jack even though he was soulless."
Supernatural,fcnv10q,t1_fcnuhcg,1577818978.0,"Ahh. You’re talking about either the demon version of himself that he either hallucinated or dreamed of (same thing basically). Or the horseman famine. 
I never thought about it being easier to break someone who cares. Explains a lot about life in general. Thanks for your answer."
Supernatural,fcnubgd,t1_fcnsm4m,1577818567.0,Thanks. Do you think this is in part because Dean tries to fix it by himself while Sam (most of the time) talks about his problems?
ExNoContact,fcnny6j,t1_fcnnlug,1577815089.0,"If she has things to figure out, then you’re doing the right thing. She asked for space so the ball is in her court to initiate to you. You’re doing the right things. Make sure you believe them tho. Don’t just do them as a distraction. I wish you the best as well."
ExNoContact,fcnffpy,t1_fcne1fn,1577810612.0,"Possibly. I’m taking it slow and seeing how it plays out. I am way too understanding and almost too forgiving, but those are strengths just as they are weaknesses. I can do better but she can also be better and that’s what I want. A better her. She understands that. My main focus right now is elevating myself to a new level and not getting hurt again. My guard is up this time, so if I do get hurt again, it’s my fault and I’ll remove her from my life entirely. If not, then we’ll see where it goes. I appreciate you looking out for me, friend. I wish you the best."
ExNoContact,fcnf3ir,t1_fcndzpc,1577810419.0,"I first went no contact about a week after the breakup, but she showed up to my house a week after that bc of something I had done. I then immediately went no contact again and started working on my flaws. She messaged me a week later for thanksgiving and we talked here and there for about a week. Then, after a week, we started talking everyday. I was not ready for everyday communication bc I wasn’t healed yet. So I lost my temper and we were “forced” to stop talking by her mother (I know for a fact her mom did make her stop, but she rarely let her mom tell her what to do and her actually listen.) We didn’t talk for almost 2 weeks and she said “merry Christmas”. I replied “merry Christmas” and then we didn’t talk for a few days. That’s when she sent the apology text and we ended up talking again.  So In reality, there really wasn’t any “no contact”. It was more of “no reaching out and letting her come to Me”. The best way to use no contact is to worry about them as little as possible. You’re gonna worry about them and wonder about them, but you can’t make that your entire focus. You have to worry about yourself more. Fix whatever you don’t like about yourself (or in my case, begin to fix it). Get to a point of almost indifference. If they come back, great. If they don’t, great. Understand that you can be happy without them and you don’t NEED them, you just WANT them. 

If I’m being honest, we’re far from over each other. We’re still crazy about each other, we just made mistakes. Her mistakes hurt me more than mine hurt her, but a mistake is a mistake. There wasn’t any cheating or super undeserved disrespect dished out. We have a chance to get back together in the future but we have to much to change before then. Just stay strong and use Reddit as much as you need to. Don’t look at anything of theirs and do your best to completely distance yourself. Remember, NC is to help you heal and become who you want to be. It’s not to reattract them. If they do become reattracted, it will be the new you. Not the absence of the old you."
ExNoContact,fcnc64j,t3_ei1re3,1577808526.0,She did message me! She apologized for all of the things she did after the breakup that hurt me. She even apologized for the things she did before the breakup! This was out of the blue (but way overdue) mostly because she never apologized first during the relationship. We ended up talking on the phone and it was a pretty good conversation. She said that she misses me and that she’s not over me at all. I still have my guard up and am being hella cautious. And we’re not getting back together until she shows me that I’m a priority to her and that she’s changed.
motivation,fc78fw6,t3_egfcu7,1577500295.0,"As far as cable goes, there’s not much to watch that will really help you out. Just start flipping through the channels until you find something you like. I suggest being very careful as to not spend too much time watching it. 

I watch FearlessSoul on YouTube. It has a ton of motivational videos and stuff of that sort to get/keep you going. AlphaM is another YouTube channel that I watch occasionally for workout videos and stuff of that sort. 

One thing that I’ve done to help me figure out where I want to be is to write down my goals. When I get lazy or stressed, I simply look at them to keep me going. I also plan on writing down a plan of action to achieve those goals (once I figure a plan out). 

The best thing to help with the addictions other than meetings is to completely distance yourself from things that trigger you into doing it. Sell your vape. distance yourself from the people you gamble with until you feel strong enough to say no and even then, don’t hang out with them when they’re gambling. One thing that helped me with my gambling problem was to stop carrying money on me. My friends knew that I would get them their money, but it could be a while so if I didn’t have a lot of cash, they didn’t bother. I also suggest telling your friends of your plans. It doesn’t have to be all of them, but at least 1 or 2 to hold you accountable and that you can talk to in times of weakness. I beat my addiction by becoming addicted to a person. Now I’m focusing on becoming addicted to myself. (Not in a bad way. Bettering myself and such.)

One thing that could help with losing weight/ becoming fit would be to stand while you do some things. I tend to sit at work and I’ve been consciously trying to correct this, but it’s not exactly happened yet. This is mostly to change your mindset from being lazy (if you are). I also suggest going for a walk in a park or somewhere relaxing when you feel like relapsing. This can help you get your mind off of whatever it is that’s causing you to want to relapse. You can’t just walk tho. Focus on your surroundings and pay attention to your steps. Anything to get your mind off of whatever it is currently on. 

Also remember to be kind to yourself. If you do relapse, it doesn’t mean that you’re back to square one, it means that you took a step back. You already know that you can go however Long it took to relapse without doing it. So shoot for a little longer. Speak kind words to yourself. Be your own best friend. I know it sounds stupid, but I’m giving it my best shot as well.  You can achieve every goal you’ve set for yourself. Good luck on your journey, friend. If you need someone to talk to feel free to reach out."
