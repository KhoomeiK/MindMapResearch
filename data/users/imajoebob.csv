If you decide to tough it out you'll have the opportunity later in life to say you're glad you decided not to do that. But if you choose not to stick it out, you'll never have that opportunity."

NASA did a study a long time ago about this.  Having astronauts locked up in a floating tin can for months presents air quality issues.  They found a number of different plants have a noteable effect on toxins, pollutants, etc.  Do a search, and to might be surprised."

worldnews,ff6d6v5,t1_feiu939,1579624633.0,"Because, from things I've read, this is about standardizing the actual hardware, not how the hardware works.  I.e. Everyone has to use the same plug. The USB-C is backward compatible with an adapter. But the physical limitations of mini/micro USB won't allow them to do what the C does.  In 3 years do you want to be stuck with the equivalent to a serial port?"

DIY,fej70ho,t3_epbfnu,1579159536.0,"Ask your inspector if he saw the wiring and if there's a reason he didn't think it important to mention.  If he doesn't give you a satisfactory answer pay a professional to do an electrical inspection.  Ask your insurance agent for a referral.  Depending on the result, you may be able to file a claim against th e inspector.  Or he may tell you the possible complications were already mitigated.  Properly installed aluminum wiring meets code, if only by grandfathering.  
Aluminum touching copper creates a galvanic reaction. This is what happens on your car battery connectors, creating that metallic ""fuzz."" This affects the electrical resistance of the connection, causing it to heat up.  Eventually it can cause a wire to fail, break, or even start a fire. There is a fix that's safe and been in place for a couple decades.  
If you have a good basic understanding of working with electricity,  this can be a DIY project.  It's some work, but not expensive.  You buy a big tube of specifically formulated Al/Cu anti-oxidant compound at the home store, check and clean each and every Al to Cu connection, apply the compound, and replace the wire connector with a new one. There's a chance the old connector may already have oxidized, and they're dirt cheap.
Do a full inventory of each room, and don't forget any gang boxes in the cellar or attic. Create a work plan and follow it.  Shortcuts could burn your house down.  It's not worth it.  You can probably do it over a few weekends.  If you don't feel confident in doing it yourself, hire a *licensed* professional.  It's probably not much more than your insurance deductible."

No matter which course of action you use to correct this, taking it down appears the best way to start. You can excavate around and under it, but in the end it will take more time and effort than getting it out of the way and preparing the ground properly.  I think this is one of those cases where what appears to be the easier solution ends up being much harder."

explainlikeimfive,fc1qjjh,t3_efnmti,1577326545.0,"Both. And neither.  
Your voice is controlled by muscles, and like any muscle, these can be trained to do more than if left to their own devices.  At the same there are still limits. Our muscles can't be trained to lift a house; the equipment doesn't have the capacity.  Your voice can be trained to behave within those physical limitations (the both and neither). 

I was a classically trained singer with a 3 octave range. I was an exception. Most people struggle for more than half that.  To ELI5 it, I was an athlete (truly). I exercised much muscles every day. I trained, I treated, I pushed my limits. Just like a football player or a sprinter, or a weight lifter.  Genetics enabled me to do more than others, but effort helped me reach my potential.

Others train their voices in a different way.  Look at Melissa Rausch, Bernadette on The Big Bang Theory. She has a perfectly ""normal"" voice, but can sound like Bernadette one second, and like Mrs Wolowitz the very next.  THAT is likely the type of change you want, and CAN train yourself to do.

But consult with a professional coach. You can do severe damage if you do it the wrong way. And even if you do it the right way, you can still get permanently injured. Just like a basketball player who blows out a knee, vocal chords can be injured. 

Trust me, I know.  All too well."
