todayilearned,ff99svd,t1_ff98k6t,1579708113.0,"It was 14th century. Medicine was a mix of superstitions, wild guesses and bits of (not necessarily useful) knowledge that survived from antiquity. Doctors believed that people consist of four main fluids that can be either hot or cold and that disease is caused by fluids going into disbalance or getting either too hot or too cold. So the king's doctor decided that his patient was too cold, and tried to make him hotter. Everyone knows that drinking brandy makes you feel warm inside, so it must work on your outside the same way, right? 

Anyway, this probably could be useful for disinfecting any skin lesions he might've had, but not for much else. Also alcohol evaporates quickly so the king probably was getting colder instead of warmer. Until he was lit on fire, that is."

etymology,fdwzqpt,t3_emz7l1,1578763832.0,"It's on the Russian wiki, and the source given is a book written by Dmitry Mendeleev which I can't access, but here it goes.

[The article about Dmitry Mendeleev's father Ivan](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9C%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B5%D0%B2,_%D0%98%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD_%D0%9F%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87#cite_note-3) says that he was a son of a priest whose surname was Sokolov. But when Ivan began studying in a seminary, he became Ivan Mendeleev. Why? Because there was a weird tradition of ""seminary surnames"". [Here's a source in English on googlebooks that describes it a bit](https://books.google.ru/books?id=Ei9QBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA425&lpg=PA425&dq=seminary+surname&source=bl&ots=sd0PRUoWAx&sig=ACfU3U1nrI4EhPtExsitx_QABIJg98aSHA&hl=ru&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjjidS-hvzmAhXNs4sKHXQUCQYQ6AEwDnoECAYQAQ#v=onepage&q=seminary%20surname&f=false). They could be very different: some were inspired by the Bible, some were related to the student's own peculiarities, some translated the roots of his name into Greek to make it more scholarly sounding. [Here's a big article, in Russian only](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A1%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B5_%D1%84%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B8). Sorry for that, seems there aren't any thorough sources in English. 

Ivan Sokolov's name change was very simple, according to that wiki page: he was given the surname of a local landowner, Mendeleev. First syllables of ""Mendeleev"" sound a bit like a phrase which can be translated as ""to do an exchange"", and Ivan had made an exchange of goods recently, and the landowner was known to exchange his horses a lot. So that's how the dad got this surname, and his famous son inherited it.

But I should've been more exact, I meant that Franklin's men took some things with them which can be considered luxurious and unnecessary when they left their ships. It wasn't a scientific expedition anymore, but a matter of survival. Wiki quote:

>At another site on the western extreme of the island, Hobson discovered a lifeboat containing two skeletons and relics from the Franklin expedition. In the boat was a large amount of abandoned equipment, including boots, silk handkerchiefs, scented soap, sponges, slippers, hair combs, and many books, among them a copy of The Vicar of Wakefield. 

Another one:

>Some of the crew members heading south from Erebus and Terror hauled many items not needed for Arctic survival. McClintock noted a large quantity of heavy goods in the lifeboat at the ""boat place"" and thought them ""a mere accumulation of dead weight, of little use, and very likely to break down the strength of the sledge-crews"".

Books could be used for kindling, spare boots are also not bad, but other stuff seems very random, and the contemporary searchers thought the same. Maybe they planned to use these things to trade with natives, who knows. I think I saw a suggestion that this strange assortment points to mental decline caused by lead poisoning."

interestingasfuck,fd71uu6,t1_fd6ykzq,1578198409.0,"A predator sees prey, but the prey doesn't see it. Best thing the predator can do is to stand still to check if it's really unseen and then quietly get close enough to attack (as one puppy does in the end of the gif). I had cats that reacted to feathers the same way. They became still, eyes dilated, going into full attack mode, and then pounce. Dogs aren't usually considered to be ambush predators like cats, but they can sneak on prey animals, too."

Cows weren't ours and we didn't know they were here until we walked out of the woods to see them grazing on a field. It was awkward. We called the dog back immediately, but it managed to get five or six cows in a small herd before that."
