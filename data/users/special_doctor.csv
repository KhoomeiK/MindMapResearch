relationship_advice,ffb3gp9,t3_esng91,1579750816.0,"Take probiotics, it will help. Have you taken any antibiotics lately? Antibiotics can sometimes cause yeast infections so it’s recommended to supplement with probiotics. I usually take capsules from Whole Foods but even plain yogurt might help a little. Also, are you using any really strong mouthwash or anything at all that could change the bacteria in your mouth? I’m assuming based on your post that you did not get thrush from sexual activity.

If a date told me he had thrush, I would honestly want to know what caused it and I would not kiss or be physical until it was cleared up as it can be passed on."
offmychest,ff8958h,t3_es6o9e,1579669654.0,What flavor of jam? What kind of bread?
relationship_advice,ff7pm4z,t3_es4dmf,1579655272.0,What do you want to tell her?
offmychest,ff7pitq,t3_es3hh1,1579655206.0,"Yes, please do anything you can to help these children. Their own Mother is putting them in danger by allowing a child rapist to live with them. I cannot believe this. Maybe see about talking to Child Protective Services, they aren’t always the best course of action but I’m not sure what else you can do. I would try to seek out legal information/advice from someone....,possibly a police officer, child psychologist, attorney, pediatrician, child abuse advocacy groups etc. Try reaching out to anyone you can to see what can be done or what they would suggest. Does the Mom have anyone in her life (any friends or family) that are responsible and would be able to help?"
relationship_advice,ff7ohks,t1_ff7nmtu,1579654481.0,"If he never really posted much stuff about past relationships, it might be understandable that he doesn’t post about yours. It could be that he likes to keep relationship stuff private. I would still feel a bit uneasy that he just went ahead and deleted it but I’d have a talk with him and explain how you feel, see what he has to say. Maybe he really was ready to take a break and this prompted him to do it. Honestly, if he gets rid of social media and you hardly use it anyway, it might be so much better for your relationship overall!"
offmychest,ff7ngqz,t1_ff7mgm9,1579653758.0,"Oh my, what an absolute piece of trash. Why on earth is he not in prison? He raped two little boys and who knows what else. Do any of those pictures posted have him and the kids in the photo? You could screenshot it and take it to the police to show he is violating the conditions of his release. How old is the oldest son?"
relationship_advice,ff7mti7,t3_es39be,1579653308.0,"In his past relationships, would he generally post pictures of his girlfriend/pics of them together and/or post anything about the relationship?"
offmychest,ff7lon4,t3_es3hh1,1579652525.0,"WTF?!? Do the fathers of the other kids know? What were his actual crimes/charges? I would be very worried for the children that live with this guy. If their Mom is dumb enough to stay with him and believes his offenses were a misunderstanding, I doubt she’s being very cautious keeping the kids safe and protected from him. You can find his actual charges online through the National Sex Offender Database and most states now have criminal records available online."
AskReddit,ff0h1xs,t1_fexfzzm,1579468827.0,"What went wrong in yours? For me, I think we are both too stubborn. I’ve gone on a few dates and I can barely get through the date knowing my ex and I should be together. There’s no one else I want to be with and I know with all my heart that we are meant for each other. The things that went wrong can easily be fixed. I might reach out to see if they want to talk. At least I can feel better trying and letting them know how I feel. The worst that can happen is I get rejected and the best is that we work things out and can be together. I don’t want to regret not trying one more time. I’d hate to look back and think I could have just reached out once and fixed things. One possible rejection is worth way more than a lifetime of regret."
offmychest,few5t78,t3_eqramh,1579405806.0,"If your Dad feels neglected right now, it might be a good opportunity for you to talk with him one-on-one. Maybe ask him to go somewhere, just you two and tell him you want to talk to him about something serious that means a lot to you. Maybe you can compromise by going to college but also working on music. You could get a business degree with a concentration in music or something similar that will also help build a music business and work in your music on the side."
relationship_advice,few4ryy,t1_fevp42o,1579405356.0,I’m so sorry. Did it seem like she was losing interest? Did you notice any changes? You might have to go no-contact and block her from social media so you aren’t seeing her posts but you will still see her at school. Are her friends nice to you and do you trust them? You might be able to get a little more info from them. You might also consider moving on and showing her that you are having a good time too.
relationship_advice,few41r9,t1_fevzpld,1579405054.0,Did she have a sexual past?
relationship_advice,fevxya8,t3_eqqqcc,1579402938.0,Have you been in a relationship before? Have you felt this way before or is this something new with her in particular?
relationship_advice,fevnzuy,t3_eqq4t5,1579399558.0,Sorry. Why did she dump you? How long were you together?
AskReddit,fevnsjx,t1_feqfeuj,1579399481.0,"Are you just hoping they text you then? That’s where I am, waiting and hoping because I know we loved each other, just didn’t have the best communication."
AskReddit,fep6xl0,t1_feo4b7o,1579313507.0,Same. Why don’t you text them?
offmychest,fep520n,t3_epxeri,1579312294.0,Good for you! What a sweet thing to do.  You probably can’t even imagine how much that must have meant to him.
