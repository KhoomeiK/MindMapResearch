epidemic,ffcqqie,t1_ffcn1gq,1579805274.0,"I think you’re confused about the term “super-spreader”. It refers to individuals who spread the virus at an extraordinary rate, not to the contagiousness of the virus itself. What you’re looking for is an R0 number, which we don’t have for Coronavirus yet. It is unlikely that the virus is as contagious as, say, measles (R0 12-18) based on the fact that few in Wuhan have actually contracted the virus given the high population density. Obviously this is an outbreak of huge proportions, but you’re talking like the world is ending."

neoliberal,fdmarj3,t3_elkb8x,1578544138.0,"Let’s look at the first four states to vote in the primary race:

Biden has a 1.5 point lead in Iowa, a state that Hillary won over sanders by less than half a point.

Biden has a very narrow lead in New Hampshire, a state that Sanders carried against Clinton by 25+ points.

Biden has a gigantic lead in South Carolina and is practically a shoe-in with his >20 point lead.

Biden has a 6-7 point lead in Nevada, a state which Clinton over Sanders won by about 5 points.

In conclusion, Bernie is obviously winning, and he might as well be considered the commander in chief already.

There’s nothing wrong with taking care of yourself in whatever way you need. There will be people who judge you for this, but the good people in your life will understand."

AskReddit,fde22xv,t1_fbsgu1y,1578329438.0,"Hey I know you commented this two weeks ago, but I asked my GF about Violet Evergarden and it’s one of her all time favorites. Gonna watch it with her at the end of January when we both go back to college together."

Currently in a coffee shop by myself drinking a cappuccino and looking at reddit. That... would be a very sad death."

UpliftingNews,fctfzzu,t3_eij2k6,1577942057.0,"Golden rice and other gm crops similar to it are what inspired me to major in molecular biology. This is amazing news and anyone not celebrating it is in need of a reality check. GMO naysayers are holding back advancements in agriculture that could change the world for the better. If we’re able to create something as safe and useful as golden rice with our limited knowledge of gene and allele function in rice, imagine what can be done with a few decades more of studying and tweaking the DNA of our crops."

AskReddit,fcmp212,t1_fclsp3a,1577785152.0,"Honestly no idea. Just go down on her before you actually get to sex, and the whole “post nut exhaustion” point everyone here is making is moot. If she cums once from oral and again from sex, that’s a win-win-win-win I say (the first two wins being her two orgasms, the third for my ego, the fourth for my dick)."
wholesomememes,fcapg2t,t3_egxbmy,1577573946.0,My girlfriend is a huge anime fan while I’ve only ever seen a few. Gives me a lot of joy to be able to spend time with her watching her old favorites and learning about the shows and characters that are important to her. I’m in the middle of Ouran High School Host Club right now (which I unfortunately have to watch alone while on winter break from college) and we’re gonna start Violet Evergarden when the semester starts and we can be together again.
