fatlogic,feze89k,t1_few7yyp,1579456455.0,I'm tall and lanky with no muscle to speak of and I have been eating around 1500 since I was 18 (mom wasn't a great cook lol and I don't get hungry often)

fatlogic,fdnji3b,t1_fdmzpxo,1578587114.0,"Yeast break down large starch molecules in flour into simple sugars they can consume. This is the same process, but you do not add any additional sugar, so the time it takes the loaf to rise is longer that way. That is my favorite way to make bread too! I just meant to show there is a valid reason to sometimes add a small amount of sugar"
fatlogic,fdmy7qj,t1_fdmtu98,1578571057.0,"Sugar is what the yeast in the bread need to consume to form the co2 air bubbles that make bread rise. So there is a valid reason for some sugar to be added, but not the overload you usually see in store bought whitebread"

Our bodies are different! Also I feel like this wouldn't be as much of an issue if we had comprehensive education about physical health in the us, but alas, talking about exercise hurts people's fEeLiNgS"
