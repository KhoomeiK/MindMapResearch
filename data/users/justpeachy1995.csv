loseit,fensxou,t3_eq1kpc,1579290279.0,"Hi! Too much fiber being added to a diet quickly can actually cause constipation. Start slow by adding veggies into one meal a day. Especially raw veggies will do this. While fiber helps promote a good digestion, a lot at once can cause abdominal pain, bloating, and constipation."

Fitness,feh4q7n,t3_ep0fwq,1579109104.0,"This is both a rave and a rant:
Rave: I started graduate school! It's online so I've dedicated the time I get off work to focusing only on school. This means I moved my gym routine to before work. Woke up at 5:25am 4-5 days a week for the past 2 weeks! I actually enjoy morning gym more; less people, no waiting

Rant: 1. I understand it's the new year, and you may be new to the gym. But wipe down your goddamn machines when you're done and re rack your weights. It's mind boggling how many old sweaty people just leave their sweat on the machines ü§¢ 2. The two older men (50-60yrs old) who stare at me every morning literally all workout. They walk on the treadmill and just watch me and make comments. Maybe they're complimenting? But it makes me so self conscious and distracts me."
GYM,feh2uyf,t3_ep45hm,1579107997.0,"As long as you're in a caloric deficit you'll lose the fat covering the abs. To make your abs more pronounced when you do lose the fat, look at a couple an exercises, make sure you're hitting upper, mid, and lower abs and you'll get there.

Be consistent with gym & diet. The saying ""abs are made in the kitchen"" is very true. Everybody has abs (working out will make them more pronounced) but fat is covering it so you'll need to stay consistent in your caloric deficit. MyFitnessPal is a great help to calculate how many calories you should be eating to lose weight and it'll help you count calories throughout the day."

GYM,fdnucck,t3_emaal2,1578593001.0,"With being in school and having a full time job and managing family and personal relationships I personally enjoy going in the morning before work. I wake up so I have enough time to go there, workout, come home and get ready/make breakfast that way I work my usual 8.5 hours and have all night to work on schoolwork (which I try to do as much as possible) that way I have free nights to focus on my relationships"
loseit,fdntqx4,t3_emd2ed,1578592657.0,"Congrats on graduating! You're going to feel discouraged more than once, and this will probably be the worst of it. The first day back is always rough. You're not going to be able to do what you did 4 years ago, but you can make small achievable goals! Have one be that you'll be able to workout like you did 4 years ago. 

Focus small and create weekly goals! Stay consistent and you'll see results. Best of luck!"
GYM,fdnq8tw,t3_emaprs,1578590784.0,"Soooo many reasons! 
Health benefits such as fighting off diabetes, obesity, high cholesterol increasing my cardiovascular system, releasing serotonin to battle off seasonal depression and anxiety. 

I always feel more energetic when I work out consistently, I feel more focused and I want to challenge myself even more. 

Physical aspects of course! Who doesn't want a nice flat stomach and to feel confident in a bikini"
GYM,fdnp2ii,t3_emci2c,1578590232.0,"I mean it's all about calories, so if you're eating in a surplus and working out and getting adequate protein you'll gain muscle. I personally don't see why you would want to do it on a bad diet- you'll feel more sluggish and it's overall just not healthy?"

loseit,fdk2bz8,t3_elqdjz,1578494332.0,"I second this 100%. Working a corporate sales desk job taught me their way of keeping employees happy: food. For. Everything. 

Literally a snack cart with Rice Krispies and resees and donuts would go around at least twice a week. Vendors would bring us lunch every other day (fried chicken sandwiches 90% of the time). Someone's birthday: order lunch and get a cake. It was rediculius. I gained a lot of weight at that job"
loseit,fdk1ztu,t3_elquxc,1578494084.0,"Living at home makes it so I can't always decide what's for dinner and many times my parents order out. For situations like this, as well as in restaurants, I really look at the ingredients to know how calorie dense this thing is. I never eat the entire thing (Chinese takeout is about 3 meals for me)."
Fitness,fdi0cs9,t3_ekxwxw,1578433467.0,"Rest day definitely. Think about your basic workout routine, you're working a specific muscle group typically every 2 days. Your muscles can only repair so quickly before being worked again. This is where rest days come in. Anytime I take time off from the gym I always crush it since my muscles are completely repaired"
loseit,fdh1c2f,t3_el75md,1578413234.0,"I'm gonna sound like a broken record, but CICO. You have to be in a caloric deficit for it to work. I used MyFitnessPal when I started out to get an idea of how many calories various foods contained, I personally don't mind eating the same thing everyday so I picked out a few basic meals and snacks and stuck with that. Focusing on ""real"" food, actual produce, not ""weight loss bars"" helped because I was eating ""more"" (volume wise) and staying full for longer. This helped with cravings and binging! 

Once you get the hang of it, I switched it up when I wanted to treat myself. My morning snack is about 250 calories (apple and Pb) so if I was craving a donut real bad, I swapped my snack for a donut. In moderation of course, but little swaps helped my sanity lmao.

Don't get discouraged! You're gonna see results and be so excited. Then there will be no results. You're gonna plateau a couple times. It's frustrating as hell but just work through it. The amount of times I felt I looked the same, making no progress then it was literally like I woke up and looked different (I'm talking about definition) is a great feeling.

Take pictures! Don't always trust the scale, water weight, fluctuations, hormones can all mess with your weight. Pictures and measurements work! I've lost fat and gained muscle and I'm the exact weight I started at. The scales the same but I look completely different. 

Don't force yourself to do/eat what you don't want to. Find something you like. Whether it's food or exercise."
loseit,fdh0eir,t3_el6vw5,1578412640.0,"I did both at the same time! I was in a caloric deficit to lose weight and did strength training and gained muscle definition. If you're looking to really bulk up and you want very pronounced muscles, maybe bulk first? I'm not sure what your stats are so it's hard to tell. 

If you're looking for more lean muscle growth then do both at the same time. I always say I ""balanced out"" (stayed about the same weight but body fat percentage decreased and I gained muscle)"
GYM,fdh00if,t3_el7ht0,1578412394.0,"As others have said, it's a supplement. If you get enough in your diet then you don't need it. I personally don't eat enough of it so I take a supplement once a day, after my workout only because I workout in the morning and I have a protein smoothie for breakfast so it just worked out like that.

If you're curious whether you're getting enough, download something like MyFitnessPal. You put in all your stats, what your goals are, etc. And it'll show you how much protein you should be eating. Take a couple days and put in what you typically eat and see how much protein you're legitimately eating in a day and compare. Maybe you're slacking and a supplement would be beneficial."
loseit,fdgzeqj,t1_fdgmyrc,1578412008.0,"I second this. I used to workout after work (around 5:30ish) and I struggled with falling asleep big time. Since the new year, I switched to working out before work. Maybe it's a coincidence considering I went from waking up at 7:15am to 5:30am but I pass out as soon as I go to bed now"

She's being a little dramatic haha. You're right, it will look uneven if she's only working upper body. The soreness she hates is temporary, any new muscle group you workout is going to be sore for a little bit! It's a hard workout because she doesn't work it out ever haha they're weak!"

loseit,fddzue0,t3_ekjvog,1578327958.0,"I hold all my weight in my midsection, my hips and inner thighs. I have wide hips and figured I would always look chubby in that area because as I lost weight and worked out, it was always there. But for me, that area was just the last area to lose weight. My hips appear smaller and my legs are getting some real shape to them! Give it time, it might just be that stubborn 2lbs. Either way, with building muscle and losing fat, you can definitely have toned legs!"

GYM,fcytddn,t1_fcylqsk,1578086662.0,"When I started out I calorie counted using MyFitnessPal and it gave me a really great idea of what contains what and after using it for a few weeks I fell into a routine. I don't count anymore, occasionally if I'm unsure if it's calorie dense I'll check it out! Switching to less processed packaged stuff helped because those tend to be calorie dense and there's just a bunch of additives you don't want!"
GYM,fcy35i7,t1_fcxzhog,1578074104.0,"That's where the weight gain started, stupid college! I was broke so I bought cheap healthy food: salad ingredients (spinach, bell peppers, cucumbers (stupid cheap), avocados and chicken) little snacks like apples and peanut butter, or rice cakes and peanut butter. Rice is super cheap for a while lot, frozen fruit/veggies hold nutritional value and are cheaper and easy to prepare!"

I had extra weight on my hips and thighs and I wanted to get rid of it so I ate better and started going to the gym 3-4 times a week. My boyfriend lost weight throughout the span of about 3 years and when I met him, he was doing really well. We both fell off the bandwagon and put on some weight, I was at about 145lbs from 135lbs, doesn't seem like much but I told all my weight in my hips so it was noticable. I'm back in my routine and he's been saying some comments lately...laying down and my hip bone is out a bit (nothing unhealthy don't worry) and he goes ""jeeeeez"" or the other day we went out to eat and I was deciding what to get (cheat meal) he's like well you need a burger. 

I'm trying not to let it get to me because I know he's frustrated with himself and taking it out on me but damn üôÑ"
fatlogic,fc5ynsm,t3_egc9c3,1577468583.0,"Rant: new year's resolutioners at the gym. A huge high five for deciding to get healthier, I'm happy people get motivation for it. What I'm not happy about is how busy the gym is gonna be. Between people sitting at machines on their phones, using machines for weird purposes and frankly just the crowd that will be there. I've already decided I will start going in the morning starting next week rather than 5pm 

Rave: I did well through the holidays! Had a piece of cake here and there but overall kept my portions at a reasonable amount!"
