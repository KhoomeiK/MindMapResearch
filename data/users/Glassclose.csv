it's a fantastic way to lose your ass if you don't know what you're doing. lots of people end up trying to chase the market and buy too late and try to sell when it's already dying down and then they'll accept less and less making it almost not worth it. often the market is a 'race to the bottom' of who is willing to sell the cheapest, some get some competitive and get so lost in it at the end of the month they're in the red."
