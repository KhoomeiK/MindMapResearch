I think the ultimate goal is finding the life recipe that is healthy for you with the help of medications if they help. There's a lot of work from the patient and we cannot simply outsource everything to the psychiatrist."
bipolar,fck320g,t1_fcjy825,1577715101.0,"Thank you!

I mostly agree with your comment.

I do not think I'm completely delusional though. But again, we cannot know if we are delusional. That's the beauty of delusions.

I just need to learn to live with my doubts."
bipolar,fcjy19y,t1_fcjlvbh,1577710006.0,I have to stop thinking.
bipolar,fci6zze,t3_ehc8h6,1577658481.0,"You're not alone.

You know more about your life than doctors IMO.

HOWEVER, if you feel good with your medication... Why not deal with your deeper issues with it? Being depressed sucks very much and you looks ""stabilized"". 

Sure, your mind would be more creative to force you to focus on your issues... But there's nothing that will guarantee that you will fix them. You'll just think about them again, and again, and again. And THAT is exhausting.

You might want to speak to a psychologist."
bipolar,fc8yyia,t1_fc81vwh,1577544351.0,"Wow.

I would be also upset if I'd experience something similar...

That is also why I'm very critic of the psychiatry field... They have their dogmas and it's impossible to fight them with reason."
Quebec,fc6x3mc,t1_fc5i3ez,1577491736.0,"Les compagnies sont idiotes par contre... Pour avoir eu plusieurs emplois dans le milieu de la finance, je peux vous assurer que vos données personnelles ne sont pas protégées. J'aurais pu les voler très facilement et la compagnie n'a pas les processus en place pour le savoir...

C'est déconcertant en réalité.

Il est mieux de prendre pour acquis que nos infos sont déjà leakés et vivre en ce sens.."
