The U.S definitely had a large production base across the ocean, but the problem was getting the weapons produced to Europe. Soviets could just roll out tanks and get them on trains. British and Americans couldn't do that.

By the end of the war, the Soviets were matching Allies in almost all aspects of airpower except for strategic bombing capacity.

I don't really think this guy had a firm grip of just how massive the Red Army was or how much firepower it packed. Just in terms of artillery, ""The God of War"" as the Soviets liked to call it, the Soviets had Germans and Allies outmatched and out-gunned from 1940 onward.

After years of preparation and around the clock bombing of Germany, allied armies had a ton of trouble facing 5 to 15 German divisions while having air supremacy. Meanwhile the Red Army was launching enormous attacks in 500 km wide fronts and annihilating whole German army groups (30+ divisions) in weeks.

To be perfectly clear, this was not because there was something wrong with Allied soldiers. They were just as brave as the Soviet soldiers. The problem was that there was (and is) an ocean and/or a channel between Allied industrial heartlands and the theater of war in Europe. America could have produced a much better tank than Sherman, but there was no way it could send it to Europe and support it. Meanwhile, Soviets would produce massive heavy tanks and send them straight to battle without any worries of how they would supply them."

The Detroit Combination and many smaller, semi-independent, Mafia clans were all over the area. All of them were beholden to Chicago for overall guidance since Chicago was the only mid-west family with a seat on the Commission.

So if Giancana ordered his clan to interfere on behalf of Kennedy, he probably got the word to all these other smaller clans to do the same thing.

That is assuming that it was Giancana operating alone and this was not a Commission decision. Because that would mean all the clans (including the 5 families) all over the country were doing everything in their power to get Kennedy elected."

France and Germany had been at each other's throat for a while at that point, but neither really  wanted to be the one declaring on the other side first without a REALLY good reason. Why you ask? Because of Great Britain mostly. Both sides knew that if they declared on the other side over some half-assed pretext there was a real chance Britain would either completely stay out it, or worse, join the opposite side which would really mess up their plans.

When the Archduke was shot, Germans actually thought they had a chance to keep Britain out of the war if Austria declared quickly. And it *almost* worked.  Nobody really was sure if Britain was going to go to war until the very last minute and they would not have, had Germans not attacked Belgium.

They blow up a way through the wires using grenades or other explosives and quickly spread through the line, targeting specific strong points using grenades and pistol fire. They would not go for clearing the actual tranches though. Instead they would keep going forward to hit communication points and HQs with the intention to create chaos up to 5 kms inside the enemy lines and then fall back."

HistoryMemes,fedxxbk,t1_feda60z,1579022227.0,"Charging an MG with your head held high is a bad idea, sure. 

But MG positions are more vulnerable than what most think. Basically, they are not very maneuverable, so you are stuck and everyone wants to kill you. So if you have any sort of support gun, or any sort of support structure among a platoon, the gunner is going to have a bad time. That's why infiltration tactics were so effective in 1917 & 1918. The entire idea is that you break down your larger units into smaller teams that can coordinate and communicate and you load them the hell up with as much explosive and ammo as they can carry. Static MGs wont stand much of a chance against those tactics."

I mean all the way to Astrakhan. Ukraine, Georga, Azerbaijan, and Armenia should have been captured. 

Army Groups Center and North should have played more a supporting role. 

The only way to win against USSR would have been to bleed them dry. Capturing those strategic position would have given the Germans the opportunity to bleed Russians, because at that point, it would have been the Russians that had to go on the offensive, not Germans."
