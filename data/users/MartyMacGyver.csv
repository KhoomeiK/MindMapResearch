arduino,fcis8yg,t1_fcibtit,1577668593.0,"Ah.. 60/40 is a right PITA to work with. You might raise your soldering iron's temperature a bit when working with it (if it's being plasticky), and avoid moving it at all for a moment after solder is applies until the joint cools a bit (basically remove the iron and wait a second).

Why? Because 60/40 has a small temperature range in which it's ""plastic""... not quite liquid and not quite solid. If it moved while in that phase, it can lead to a poor/""cold"" solder joint.

63/37 is eutectic: it goes right from liquid to solid at a certain temperature, no plastic phase. It's worth investing in some (I like the no-clean kind personally, but RA Flux types work as well).

More info about solder and its phase diagram is [here](https://fctsolder.com/eutectic-solder/). The takeaway is that 63/37 solder completely melts at 183C, while 60/40 is melty between 183C and 191C.

There's a lot more info out there... [this thread](https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=634103.0) has some good stuff (particularly [this image showing solder joints](https://karpova-lab.github.io/cerebro/_images/soldering101.png))."

FastLED,fc4hbsw,t1_fc4e9mu,1577416660.0,"Are you talking specifically about the new WS2812B-V5, or just the WS2812B's in general?

[The V5 is like TTL while V4 and earlier are like CMOS](http://www.interfacebus.com/voltage_threshold.html), in terms of the logic levels and guard bands:

    V4: Low = 0-0.3VDD        ( 0.0V - 1.5V @ VDD=5V)
        High = 0.7VDD - VDD   ( 3.4V - 5.0V @ VDD=5V)

    V5: Low = -0.3V-0.7V      (-0.3V - 0.7V @ VDD=5V)
        High = 2.7V - VDD+0.7 ( 2.7V - 5.7V @ VDD=5V)

The V4 and earlier were always iffy with 3.3V signals thanks to that 3.4V margin for ""high"" (which would be a bit less iffy as VDD sags under load, but is still uncomfortably close to the highest signal a 3.3V device will provide).

I'd expect the V5 (as specced) to work much better with direct 3.3V signalling given the lower ""high"" margin. They would've had to redesign the input block to handle that (I'm curious how or if the output signal differs now)."
