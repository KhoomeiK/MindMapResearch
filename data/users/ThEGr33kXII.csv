I think blaming it on being a mostly women production and the majority of film goers being women haters is disingenuous and untrue. I'd bet my money on the reason being that it's yet another unnecessary reboot that adds nothing to the original. There are few reboots that have done well recently...

Captain Marvel did fine, and the hate was the stuff it's lead actress said, which was stupid, not the film itself."

Opinion =/= Fact. In your option it's transphobic, in mine it isn't. That's why this conversation is pointless. 

>Well see, I don't believe you when you say that they don't want to be called by their preferred gender. I thought the whole JBP thing was that ideas matter, not identities.

It's because you don't understand what I mean. They prefer the female pronoun, that's what transitioning is... They don't agree with all the new pronouns. You must have purposefully mistook my language. I guess Boy George's to at that.

I'm more middle ground than Conservative.

I treat people as individuals, this is why I'm not the one using group identity, ""you conservatives"" as if that somehow invalidates me. 

I'm truly done with this now. Take care."
JordanPeterson,fecvgnp,t1_fecv3xt,1578986219.0,"You don't even understand why I posted this which is why I think you're young. You just don't get it...

I don't agree with all this pronoun fad. It's not practical and it means nothing.

I've not said anything against anyone who is trans. FYI I've supported colleagues who have gone through (yes, 2) the whole change. They don't like the pronoun thing either, which is partly why I don't... Does that mean that they're now transphobic? See that's BS.

JordanPeterson,fe5d4a2,t1_fe4r67h,1578867901.0,"Thanks for the reply. A nice read. 

I'm very much the what you see is what you get sort of guy, I don't believe in much really. I don't think there is anything beyond what we have now, but I think we do in some ways live on by creating nice memories in others... I suppose you could call consciousness the spirit, it is something that is difficult to quantify and understand. Probably something that should be considered more, it's quite humbling.

There is a very strong race to the bottom with this ""I'm the victim"" BS. I don't like the group connotations, white, male and straight and you might as well get your name changed to Lucifer. I like the idea of individuals working to better themselves for the betterment of all, why Jordans message struck a chord.

I've heard similar claims. I mean I don't know, I'd like to hope it's not true but it wouldn't shock me if it was. Like you say they seem to want to create this crazy utopia and it seem they want to build it on the bones of western cultures.

Anyway, won't keep going ha. Here is to hoping you're right about the backlash! Take care."
JordanPeterson,fe1f59t,t1_fe0bzo0,1578825858.0,"2% of DNA is a HUGE difference. There are approximately 3Billion DNA base pairs in a Human Genome. So 2% is approximately 60Million different instructions. That's just massive. 

A huge amount of the 98% we share are shared because they're instructions like ""how to make a cell"", ""How to make bones"" ""Where the hell it all goes and connects and forms""...

The best analogy I can think of is this; Saying that all computer programs ran on a PC are 99% the same because the hardware is the same, they all use binary, the Operating System is the same and the drivers, a screen, keyboard, mouse... But one program is a web browser and another is a game. They share 99% of what they are but they're so very different and if you only focused on that 1% you might never even know they were both programs at all. Hope that makes sense.

Then there are the differences between siblings (brothers for example) they share even more DNA, yet they're (in the vast majority of cases) very different people, they can look similar but you can see the differences. 

 I'd do more reading if I were you. 

We do have brains big enough to give us more freedoms, that's absolutely correct. A side effect of this is society and a need to belong to it. The modern culture is just that manifesting in a very unhealthy way because they're being taught that society is wrong my leftist teachers and lecturers.

I don't know enough about Gender Dysphoria (I mean real trans not those snowflakes who want to feel special) and the causes of it, though I'm not sure who does know enough. It seems to be linked to Autism. I know that Autism has a very strong link to genetics and so it seems likely that this is the case for GD.

I don't think making the world rotate around a tiny group of confused people is correct, and I don't think that surgery or drugs are the correct course. These people need to support to come to terms with who they are... It's hard though because Autism gets in the way, they literally interpret the world differently."
