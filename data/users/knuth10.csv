unpopularopinion,femn5nq,t3_epogu9,1579263353.0,"Nfl cut back on a lot of commercials. No more break kickoff break for example. If you weren't watching commercials you would be watching a bunch of dudes standing around on the field. Maybe you just dont like the sport its self the times slots are ment to take up a certain amount of time and playing the games to fast would ruin their TV contracts. Which as a viewer you probably dont care about but the money flowing in from those contracts is what makes it such a great sport. The super bowl is out of hand still and sometimes if there are injuries replay reviews or penalties it can slow the game to a halt which does suck.


If you really want to complain about to many adds try watching the last ten minutes of a close basketball game"

unpopularopinion,fdhxq55,t1_fdhtbbo,1578432064.0,Your right you can do whatever you want the point is that its annoying for the other people around you who are paying hard earned money to have a good experience and it gets ruined by some bratty little kids.

unpopularopinion,fdgwgc1,t3_el95xf,1578410023.0,I used to work in the restaurant industry and it is insane how people will let there kids act when out to eat.
