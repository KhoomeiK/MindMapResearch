Advice,ffewr42,t3_et9m0t,1579868681.0,"First off, gunshots don’t go down as well as they depict in movies. Many times, you don’t hit the right area and end up suffering in horrible pain until you bleed out. Other times, you still live but are basically a vegetable for the rest of your life. Do either of those sound appealing? If they don’t, don’t off yourself with a gun. 

Second, please seek help. I don’t know what you’re going through, but I’ve thought the way you are thinking now. Life can get better. But that choice to make it better starts with you. It will take time; it won’t be a sudden 180° and everything is better. But, if you’re willing to put in the work, you can enjoy the rest of your life."

And if you two had better communication, you’d be able to tell him all your reasons for not wanting to do what he did and he’d understand.

Also, I’d stop interacting with her so much. You two are still acting like a married couple. If you want to separate to see if you want to work it out or move on, you need time to be alone and think things over. Seeing each other every day and hanging out isn’t going to help."

cats,feu8rs4,t3_eqmnug,1579384262.0,">Is pet insurance worth it?

Definitely worth it if you get the right kind. You want insurance that will cover meds AND medicated food if ever needed. I didn’t have pet insurance and my oldest is on medicated food and my youngest gets medicated food and daily steroid inhaler. I wouldn’t paying for any of it if I would have had pet insurance. Many cover yearly checkups too. 

>I live in the city with out other door cats is there any risk of disease spreading etc.

If your cat would be outdoor at all, there’s a possibility. I would suggest to keep it an indoor cat since you live in the city, just for safety more than anything else. And it would be good to do a monthly flea and tick treatment. You could get a flea and tick collar or treatment you put on the back of their neck each month. Our youngest eats field mice that come in during the fall, so all of our cats get the flea/tick treatment that also protects against worms. If you think your cat might eat mice or interact with other cats you don’t know well, I’d use this as well. 

>Average cost/time to care for a cat properly?

Depends on your preferences. Cats can be solitary animals so they don’t need as much time as a dog. But they need stimulation (play time) and some like to get a certain level of attention. 

As for time, my oldest is a snuggler, so he needs snuggle time throughout the week. My middle is very solitary, so she only needs some pets here and there and will request snuggles as needed. My youngest (asthmatic) likes to be near us almost all the time but doesn’t always need snuggles. But my youngest demands play time. When he gets bored, he scratches furniture and rugs. Other than that, I feed them and clean their cat boxes. 

You also have to consider items you have to purchase. They’ll need something to scratch and many cats like to climb. If you’re in a small house or apartment, I’d recommend a cat tower. They have corner towers so they don’t take up too much space. But they’ll cost at least $100. And toys that will keep them stimulated. Add in a cat box, litter, food, nail trimmer, and yearly checkups (including any yearly meds like rabies shot). My cats also have a water fountain since they prefer not to drink stagnant water. And we have auto feeders for when we travel. 

Some things also depend on the breed and/or personality of the cat. My youngest is part Bengal so he’s high demand for play and stimulation whereas my other two not so much. My oldest is an orange tabby and like I said he’s a snuggler. The middle is a tortie, and they’re just odd. 

Overall, cats can be fairly inexpensive and low maintenance. If you happen to get a cat that gets medical issues, expenses can add up."

Third, decide what your dealbreakers are for future relationships. What won’t you tolerate? When a dealbreaker comes up, tell the person you don’t date people who (insert dealbreaker). If they choose to change, awesome. If not, leave. But don’t give them an ultimatum. You want them to change because they want to, not because you threaten them with something.

Never said what my kinks in bed were or even bragged. I said I enjoyed sex with my husband and I’d be his little slut in his opinion. It was a joke on the post but YOU were the one who decided to make an issue of it. If it offended you damn much, why didn’t you just ignore me and go on with your life? Why do you choose to keep telling my how shallow and unenlightened I am by enjoying sex with my husband? 

And this isn’t real life. If you think everyone on an ANONYMOUS social media platform acts and says things like they do in real life, you’re poorly mistaken. Again, if you were so damn offended, why did you reply to me in the first place? Is it because it made you feel like the better person? Is that the way you feel better about yourself in life?

Also, why aren’t you demonizing the other people who have called themselves scumbags and sluts? Is it only because they didn’t say they’re spouse would think they’re a slut?

Cringetopia,fel9enn,t1_fel549s,1579216937.0,You’ve really made me think about my choices in my life. And I think I made a fantastic choice marrying the man I did and not one like you. I wouldn’t want my husband to not care about my sexual health like you obviously do about women you’re with.
insanepeoplefacebook,fel88ct,t1_fekzutv,1579216183.0,They’re literally risking their lives so these children can have a free country to live on and you’re STILL missing my point.
Cringetopia,fel4xvc,t1_fekx4ud,1579214150.0,How is wanting to have sex with your husband shallow? Do you honestly think women who enjoy sex are bad?
Cringetopia,fekx23m,t1_fekwibn,1579209378.0,Is it because you don’t get a lot of sex and are jealous of my husband?
Advice,fekitqq,t1_feka6nr,1579200941.0,Your other posts say otherwise.
Cringetopia,feka50q,t1_fek9wpu,1579195782.0,Why? Because I have a lot of sex with my husband and he really enjoys it?
Advice,feka3ae,t1_fek9qzd,1579195753.0,"Ah, you’re a troll. Sounds about right for a computer nerd."
Cringetopia,fek9cct,t3_epm5ug,1579195311.0,"I’m either a scumbag and/or slut. But if I’m a slut, I bet my husband would agree I’m his dirty little slut. Lol!"
relationship_advice,fek98o1,t3_epm5vt,1579195250.0,"Just ask. It’s not rude to want less hair, especially if you go down on them. My husband knows he’s not getting blowjobs if he’s all natural."
Advice,fek90t9,t1_fek8sg8,1579195123.0,"Seek help from a counselor. Sounds like you have an anxiety and/or stress issue is this bothers you so much you get infuriated by it. It’s annoying, but you can always choose to close those posts and not read or respond to them."
Advice,fek8q99,t3_epm63v,1579194951.0,"While I agree with you, what advice are you seeking?"
DeadBedrooms,fek8ezv,t3_epm6ev,1579194765.0,"Sex does matter to many people. If you suddenly are never going to have sex again, most people would be at least a little upset. Just because your asexual doesn’t mean everyone else should be."
insanepeoplefacebook,fek826q,t1_fek5asd,1579194554.0,"So being in specific classifications is a bad thing now? Then why have a shelter only for LGBTQ kids? Isn’t that classifying said shelter?

Also, please explain what made you think I was against kids in my original reply to OP. Enlighten me please."
