overlord,ffan50f,t1_ff9gl0v,1579739856.0,"Yes and no. He one shot 50 of them with aura of frost before the fight started, because it was annoying to fight so many. But that still counts as fighting them."
TwoXChromosomes,ffainwt,t1_ffa0lwd,1579736653.0,This is were i thought the story was going from the start. Felt strange to me that it went in a different direction.
overlord,ff8yqj1,t1_ff8sss4,1579700318.0,Came out the same time as S2
todayilearned,fez7o5s,t1_feynnqw,1579454535.0,"You are saying. That one of the largest companies in the world. With a 30% profit margin. Had a failed buissness model. If i had one goal in life, it would be to fail just 1% as hard as them, so that my entire family wouldn't have to work a single day for the next 20 generations.

Now what i think you are confusing here is a failed buisness model, and failure to adapt to a changing environment, aswell as a movie industry that wanted a bigger and bigger piece of the cake."
todayilearned,feyf5ue,t1_feyf2ih,1579444677.0,I see you have no idea what happened to blockbuster. Good job throwing out your assumptions though!
todayilearned,feyavxr,t1_feya0c0,1579443132.0,Was it really? Never knew. My opinion still stands though. Whether they were to punitive is another matter though.
todayilearned,feyan5x,t1_fey6syj,1579443058.0,I've learned that when i borrow something i return it.
todayilearned,fey4bzx,t1_fexcqc9,1579440710.0,They should be punitive. Thats why they are called late fee's and not extensions.
todayilearned,fen1cla,t1_fen0aau,1579274775.0,Aaah. The early days when you couldn't just publish your own manifesto.
totalwar,fek0u8m,t1_fejzs78,1579190191.0,Also much more boring to reuse the same things. Can't really enjoy more then a couple campaigns of historical games anymore :)
totalwar,fek0n69,t1_fejyb17,1579190072.0,"I mean, just making them as better versions of the new fort battles would do a lot."
totalwar,fek0aw7,t1_fejrzlc,1579189861.0,Launch day? Launch year?
explainlikeimfive,fe39dv3,t1_fe3902y,1578847179.0,Norway did fairly well with it. Just less corruption. And less criminal leaders.
explainlikeimfive,fe34axf,t1_fe2uuvy,1578845817.0,Also they spent their money like a lottery winner rather than investing it.

Showerthoughts,fdg8pbe,t3_el6zlv,1578384772.0,This is also the reason everyone hates the mandalorian.
Battletechgame,fdf9knw,t1_fdesmxe,1578356493.0,Ah yes the misfire. Great times.
explainlikeimfive,fd2omr9,t3_ejv5sf,1578150178.0,"Meh. Drug dogs dont need to sniff drugs. They just need to tell you they do, so it doesn't make much difference."
TwoXChromosomes,fctnl25,t3_eirnp9,1577950322.0,"You might not want to ruin the rest of his life with criminal charges (which he in my opinion deserves), but if the last girl he did it to pressed charges, you may not have needed to go through this now. And if you do press charges, the next girl might be saved from this.

If you don't want to deal with the legal system for your own reason thats fine (like it being a big undertaking and you just want to put it behind you). But don't do it for him. He lost any right to your sympathy a long time ago."
Showerthoughts,fcselly,t1_fcrokl7,1577915437.0,"Even if they do load during intro scenes, developers vastly underesimate how much money i spend on my hobby."
tifu,fcr8w2z,t1_fcr5xxt,1577898472.0,"I would 100% know if my 5-10yo child was hanging out with my brother. Also, mother was happy to invite raging pedophile to chistmas."
tifu,fcr4naa,t1_fcr4aq6,1577896726.0,"The post was deleted, so i can't check it but i remember them hanging out significantly after she was 5yo."
tifu,fcqyeaz,t1_fcq5q81,1577894075.0,The evidence is that the mother allowed the raging pedophile alone time with her daughter. You can't leave your daughter with a supposed pedophile and then throw a hissy fit when your noe adult daughter hugs them. This is not okay in any universe.
tifu,fcqxvce,t1_fcpgenu,1577893852.0,"The mother had proof that he was a pedophile, but she had no issues with them being alone together? Seems like the mom is insane then."
todayilearned,fcjim4u,t1_fcj81ir,1577689015.0,Also it's more difficult to do. Put any hinderance in the way of people on the edge and the odds of doing it drops significantly.

Battletechgame,fbywjtm,t1_fbyw7fu,1577228272.0,"It's worse/better on higher mech parts. I can either pray to get 5 pieces of SL atlas before the game ends, or i can just buy all 5 pieces for 10 mill...

And yes. Super unbalanced. Having more than 2 pieces of a mech, and up to 8 or something is just broken. Ruins the salvage part of the game."
