If anything would happen to us on earth, similar to what happened to the Dinosaurs

Elon Musk is currently making sure that we can backup humanity on Mars. (to start with)

This is also the reason I would call him the greatest asset to humanity. Ever. He IS dealing with threats to Humanity as a whole. This is why I don't see many (if any) contenders.

Elon Musk fits under every one of these points too though.

There are thousands of Atomic Nuclear bombs out and about.
War is a trend, VERY POSSIBLE for another World War on earth.
The capability of destruction in war keeps increasing.

Global Warming is also a REAL threat to all major life on earth / our food sources. 
(If you don't believe in Global Warming, what are you doing in this subreddit? Honestly curious.... like Elon didn't create Electric cars just for fun..)

Dinosaurs were basically wiped out on earth. Something similar could definitely happen again, but to us humans.

> We may not need to leave earth ever.
Better to expand out from earth BEFORE we actually HAVE TO leave it behind. Because when we actually HAVE TO, it might be too late.

Do you honestly think that antibiotics are more important for humanity as a whole, than turning around the trend of global warming? (+backing up humanity outside of earth + actively trying to combat the future threat of artificial general intelligence?)

Like, what threat against humanity as a whole, did penicillin actually combat?

Going to ask again, what threats against humanity as a whole, did ""Galileo, Newton, Einstein"" circumvent?

You are giving multiple examples of Awesome people.

What about the people you are trying to give credit to? Einstein etc.
Aren't they standing on shoulders of Giants too? (+you didn't mention what threats against Humanity they have taken preventative measures against?)

And actually, I Can give Elon credit for SpaceX, as he made that happen.
That is how credit works.

Without Elon = No SpaceX or reusable rockets as we speak.

Cancer isn't a threat to Humanity as a whole. Or even the Majority.

We don't know who invented the wheel.

Penicillin wasn't really important to ALL of Humanity though. Just to the people who would actually need it.
