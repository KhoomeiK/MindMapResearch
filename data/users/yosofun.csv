In the CS reply they did say they would talk to the FA and that it wasn't my job to ask them to be aware of their own policy - but no compensation. Not sure if the issue was automatically closed but I'm reminding them again.

Just wanted to interject with (hopefully!) instant usefulness to help your dog with period - have you considered getting dog diapers? There are cute / affordable cloth diapers you can get on Amazon. Usually I put a cheap (no wings) period pad in it so that I don't have to wash it everyday. (You can just throw it out and reuse the same cloth diaper - it stays fairly clean).

And a cute pic of my dog in her period diapers:
