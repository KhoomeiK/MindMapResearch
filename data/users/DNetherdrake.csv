AnorexiaNervosa,ffamuf5,t1_ffa33a5,1579739656.0,"It is hard. Thank you, I'll try doing that instead. That's an interesting solution, although I feel like I'll still berate myself, or at least feel like I should be berated. 

I don't want to believe it but it's true. My family is basically what started all this, although my anorexia in particular is my own fault entirely. My friends are all pretty much friends with me because they needed friends in school and so did I. I don't have an emotional connection with any of them, none of them really want me around, and none of them know about any of this. Otherwise that would be a good idea, but I really have nobody. And you're right, I think asking would be really difficult for me.  Thank you, it really does help even just to be listened to, especially by someone who understands. I hope you're right and they aren't true. It all feels like it's true though. I hope I look on myself with more compassion in the future, but I think I'll look back on myself with shame instead.  Case in point, this whole comment, which I hate that I wrote. But really, thank you so much"
AnorexiaNervosa,ffa1y7j,t1_ff93xmb,1579726255.0,"Yeah I guess so then, I do hope your heart makes a full recovery. I'll make sure to watch it. 

I'll try to celebrate small victories, but they never feel like victories. I feel worse every time I eat because even if it does mean I'm overpowering my ED it just feels like I'm doing something bad, like I'm cheating or something. I may still be here but I really am weaker than it. It controls me entirely. I've had a really rough time affirming myself, yeah, but I hope I'm on the right track. 

I'm sorry to hear you were a self-harmer in the past but thank you, I'll try Neosporin. 

Thank you so much!"
AnorexiaNervosa,ffa1jps,t1_ff9y8rs,1579726023.0,"I do kind of feel guilty for breathing, yeah. But I do have reason to feel guilty about it. I've hurt people and helped none. I just make things more difficult for people so why should I consume resources too? Anyway I'm not sure I do have the strength within me to figure out when my ED is lying and when it isn't, or to go against what it tells me regardless, but I hope I do. Thank you, I know I'm being kind of argumentative about it but what you said here really does mean a lot, even if I still can't believe it's true."
AnorexiaNervosa,ff8c1j4,t1_ff7nv1o,1579672431.0,"I'm sorry you're going through this, I hope your recovery goes well! I haven't gotten that bad, I hope I never get to the point where it starts damaging my heart. 

I know giving into them is positive and I'm getting the signals because I'm sick but it's so hard to not be revolted by food and by myself for consuming it. My ed is stronger than me. 

I'm glad you stopped feeling frozen, at least. I had no idea it slowed things like cuts healing. I've got a self harm problem too and that would explain a lot, honestly (and unfortunately). But that actually makes the thought of eating slightly more bearable, so thank you. 

It does help, and I hope so too. Thank you! Good luck to you as well!"

The book I mentioned makes the point that it matt well not be something that happened in your life, but rather something that did not. It's an awful feeling, no longer really having your identity. I hope you can find it again."
emotionalneglect,ff3tso6,t3_er9chh,1579548692.0,"My story is similar to yours, I think. I've been reading Running on Empty, by Jonice Webb, and it's helped me understand what's happened to me. 

I never really had a lot of friends, and what friends I had were out of necessity;I needed to eat lunch with somebody, in middle school. There weren't enough seats for me to be by myself. I never had any emotional connection with them, though. They never really cared about me, I don't think, and before long I didn't care much about them either, I guess. At home the story isn't much different. My mother bordered on emotionally abusive, at times, though at the time she always appeared pretty normal and I guess loving. It was conditional, though, I realise now. She got horribly angry when my grades were any less than perfect, for example, and would yell and tell me I was lazy and the like. A few isolated incidents saw it get worse far beyond that, but the general idea was the same. At the time, though, I thought it was normal. My father wasn't around much, and, much like your story, was more accepting of who I was, but pressured me into talking to people and doing things that made me really uncomfortable sometimes. I never had much of an emotional connection with either of them. I'm currently going through the process for a diagnosis, but my psychologist is reasonably sure that I'm a little autistic and ADHD as well, and my friends kind of did similar things, always wanting to get me into crowded, noisy places that just really made me anxious and uncomfortable, not out of malice but out of lack of understanding and emotional connection. 

As a result of all this I've felt much the same way you described, and have attributed much of it to CPTSD despite still having a hard time recognizing my childhood as abusive or neglectful, although I do have some understanding that it was. 

I'm sorry this comment is so long, but I hope my story helps you understand your own."

AnorexiaNervosa,ff1q09j,t1_ff1mtef,1579483621.0,"You're welcome, and thank you for reaching out. I'm sorry to hear you have an increasing self-harm problem, but knowing why can be a big help. It's possible that it's the same reason your appetite is gone; it was for me. I've been having a lot of trouble bringing myself to eat, actually, and I'm sorry you have been too. I usually spend a long time reminding myself that healthy people just eat when they're hungry and don't debate with themselves whether they should allow themselves to eat or not. I remind myself that eating is important, that my body is telling me I'm hungry for a reason, and that eating is ok to do. But if I'm being honest, I need the same advice you do. That's worked for me sometimes, but I still find myself going so long without eating and watching what I eat so carefully that I just physically can't stop myself from eating anymore I'm so desperately hungry. I'm definitely getting worse, so what I do might help you, and I hope it does, but I still pretty frequently can't force myself to eat when I don't feel like it, or even when I do. But unfortunately all I really only of to try to help is just convincing yourself that it's ok to eat, that you need to eat, that you deserve to eat. It's difficult, I haven't gotten there yet, but it's all I know, I'm sorry."
AnorexiaNervosa,ff1jeh4,t3_er43ws,1579480149.0,"When I started, which was recently compared to a lot of people here, I was in a similar situation, where my appetite was just smaller (in my case because my depression was worsening). There were a few days when I didn't really eat anything at all and I found the same kind of twisted release that I get from cutting (I've got a self-harm problem too) came from not eating. From there it grew into a control thing, where I needed to defeat my body's natural urges, and I became obsessed with my weight. Looking back I had had signs of developing an eating disorder before, feeling bad for eating too much and feeling bad about my (pretty healthy) weight. Please stop before what happened to me happens to you. I'm so scared by this disorder and want so desperately to not have given it to myself. I don't want that to happen to you, or anyone else, so please, if it is possible for you to eat, eat."

emotionalabuse,fczybjb,t3_ejphly,1578110728.0,"A little bit different of a situation, but I've had the same thoughts, yes. When I was younger my family was very turbulent, and very recently I've realised that it was completely dysfunctional. From my perspective, my mother was emotionally neglectful and borderline emotionally abusive, and my father was mostly absent (parents not divorced or anything, he was just always working, including at night). From hers, though, I just had a temper when I was a little kid. I keep flipping back and forth between ""all the family dysfunction was my fault"" and ""I was neglected and abused as a child"". I continue having these thoughts, so I'm sorry but I don't really know how to make them stop. It might help to know that I have the same problem, though. 


The following is how I rationalise my thoughts about my situation. I still go back to ""maybe it was all my fault"" pretty often, but this line of reasoning helps me sometimes, and I hope it helps you. 


I think that it's important look at how it affects each person. As a result of my family, I have depression, anxiety, and mild anorexia, I've attempted suicide, I've self-harmed, and these have been lifelong problems since I was very young. My mother is basically fine. I feel awful about the things I did. My mother does not. This isn't to say that I'm a better person than my mother or that either of us are bad people or anything like that. All it says is that one of us was disproportionately affected by the other's actions and is remorseful, and the other is not. It's unlikely, therefore, that my mother's actions were healthy/reasonable/not abusive and neglectful. It's also unlikely that my actions were abusive or unexpectedly unhealthy (they were not healthy, but there is no healthy response to being trapped in a situation like that, as far as I'm concerned). My actions were not good, and they were certainly harmful. But they were not impactful, and I am still deeply remorseful. My mother's were very impactful, and she is not remorseful. We both hurt each other, and we were probably both the problem, but she must have been more of it."

askpsychology,fcxlvrd,t1_fcvj40i,1578066078.0,"Thank you for your response. I know it's impossible to be entirely certain, but the majority of people do not experience mental illness. I would expect, and I very well might be wrong, that the genetic component is present in a larger proportion of the population than it presents in. So while there is clearly an environmental stressor for some, is there a known reason why those for whom a stressor does not exist present symptoms?"
askpsychology,fcxlm85,t1_fcv10vd,1578065900.0,"Thank you for your response. I can understand that it has a genetic component and you can be genetically predisposed to a disorder, but as you say, schizophrenia might be preventable in a vacuum, should a vacuum be achievable. However, is there a metric for ""stressful life events""? Might the stress which comes with a perfectly normal life (reasonable childhood, no bullying, no abuse, etc.) be enough to trigger mental illness?

I still believe my parents were well-meaning, but I was frequently in situations like yours where I was completely emotionally isolated and was afraid to open up to my parents. They often commented about how what little they knew about our problems was basically us calling them bad parents, and we were emotionally and psychologically neglected for our entire lives. There was some psychological and emotional abuse, I believe, as well, although I'm less sure of that. At any rate, it has turned out that my sister and I both have C-PTSD because of our childhoods, which you may want to look into if you haven't already (certainly not saying you have it, but it is a helpful community for me). You're certainly not alone with this, and I hope you at least have some friends who can support you, as you need and deserve to have some support. I also hope some sort of professional counseling is available to you. Nobody should have to deal with things like this alone, and I really hope you don't have to."

I'm sorry you have the thoughts, I'm not sure if knowing you'll never go through with it makes it better or worse, honestly. 

This makes sense as well, although I have really bad social anxiety and just can't talk about myself at all, really. I've tried a few times, didn't get very far though. It's been really frustrating for my therapist, I think.
