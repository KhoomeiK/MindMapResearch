CasualConversation,ffrdf4a,t1_ffr224r,1580155803.0,"To counter my impatience whilst driving I turn the journey into a computer game made up of randomly moving boxes; where the mission is to avoid being hit by, or hitting, the other boxes. The purpose is to remove the human emotion element & just make it a game of skill."
ketonz,ffc1plv,t3_esjte1,1579789315.0,"Nuts are quite carby, so careful on the snacking. I substituted with seeds which are less carbs. Snacks now are Pork scratchings, home-made dark chocolate fat bombs and sometimes keto ice cream. If you're on a budget the local vege market is your friend - spinach, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, etc. With the weight stall, I put that down to the body adapting to lower food intake & adapting my base metabolic rate (BMR). I break the BMR downward cycle & effectively re-set the BMR by fasting once a week for 24-40 hours. I also use a set of scales that measures fat%. So even if my total weight is not decreasing, my fat % usually is."
todayilearned,ff74xgk,t3_ery2yg,1579641199.0,"There were 3 cases in the UK in the 1950's that were often quoted in the 1960's discussions about why state executions should be banned. This case - the Rillington Place murders, the A6 Hanratty murder & the Craig / Bentley murder."
CasualUK,fetykaf,t3_eqiu39,1579381346.0,"Chipping Campden Olympic games - started in the 1600's, but stopped in the 1850's allegedly due to rowdyism caused by the immigrant labourers working on local railway construction. Re- started in the 1960's. .... EDIT: according to the website the Games stopped in the 1850's due to the land where the Games were held becoming unavailable, but that wasn't the reason given back in the 1960's."
AskHistorians,fetndx6,t3_eqf2g4,1579377176.0,"I think it's important to examine Hitler's psyche to understand what happened - by reading Mein Kampf and books by Albert Speer, Kershaw & Starsgard for example. The conclusion I draw is that Hitler saw Europe, not as it is today but as in the days of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. This was during his formative years. The Versaille Treaty at the end of WW1 saw the Empire and parts of Germany split up. Hitler's driving passion was to re-unite the German-speaking people of Europe. Hence the take-over of Sudetenland, Austria, Czechoslovakia and parts of Poland. In the first 3 instances there was disapproval from the British & French, but no obvious military re- action.  So why should invasion / liberation of the pre-WW1 parts of German-speaking Poland be any different? In Hitler's thinking the major concern was Russia and that problem was solved by the peace treaty that Germany signed with Russia just prior to the Polish invasion (the Molotov Ribbentrop Pact)."
AskHistorians,feql15l,t3_eqcon7,1579343032.0,The British De Havilland Mosquito from WW2 could be classified as a gunship in one of its base design modifications. It had forward mounted cannons for ground attack - refer the video in this link - https://youtu.be/qmY99snA_po

history,feiicwm,t1_feie4cf,1579139217.0," After the nervous 1950's & early 1960's, nuclear weaponry resolved to the strategy of MAD - Mutual Assured Destruction, so that strategy may have determined why the nuclear button has not been pressed."
history,fehzod6,t1_fehxssg,1579127134.0,"Difficult to describe the global tension at the time of the Cuban Missile crisis. I do remember my father - unusually - being glued to the frequent radio broadcasts as events unfolded. The whole scenario was based on brinkmanship & who would blink first. In the 1950's we (the west) had built a mentality of inevitable nuclear war - refer nuclear fallout drills at school, nuclear bomb shelter construction, etc - it was not "" if', but 'when'. So a random launch of a nuclear missile would probably have had a cascade effect."
zerocarb,fdrr21l,t3_emrc4f,1578688363.0,"It's amazing when you have to force your self to eat - I think that's one of the successes of the diet; the lack of hunger pangs. From what I've read hunger pangs are detemined by the hormones  leptin & grehlin, which in turn are switched on or off by the ? glucose / insulin level in the body. If carbs are not being eaten, then glucose/insulin are not available as a hormone trigger, so the leptin/grehlin response is dormant; ie - no hunger pangs or feelings of satiety."
Wellington,fdov7xq,t1_fdop0wa,1578613631.0,"I just set up a routine: alarm, then breakfast, then workroom using a cheapo stripped down laptop. Break for coffee & phone check. Break for lunch. At the end of each day's session log achievements in a journal. Repeat 5 times per week."
todayilearned,fdmr9ql,t1_fdlma47,1578561861.0,His full time job was running a pub in the North of England & he was only paid per hanging. He sometimes reported to a prison to carry out an execution only to find it had been postponed or cancelled. In this case he didn't get paid. He resigned because of this. There's an audio somewhere on the internet where he talks about this - contradicting the idea that he resigned because he became against state executions.
LifeProTips,fd4scvu,t1_fd4idy1,1578170658.0,Yup.
LifeProTips,fd1ioku,t1_fd0u5gu,1578131771.0,"yeah, a few years ago I got a call at about 10pm from someone claiming they were from ANZ. Said they were running a competition & to enter all I needed to do was read out my credit card number - which I did.... and then pin number, at which point I hung up & called the cops. Several days later I got a letter from ANZ apologising for a mis-directed marketing campaign."
keto,fcgx5dj,t3_eh7sme,1577644956.0,"The big advantage of keto is the disappearance of hunger pangs. In the early days I had to remind myself to eat. Method: Download an app like carb manager, set your goals in the app & then rigidly follow the protein/fat/carb recommendation each day. If your weight loss stalls stop eating for 24 hours or so, then resume the eating regime. Also, adjust your food intake recommendation in Carb Manager dependent on progress. Good luck!"
