The single species known as the Tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus) belongs to an *order* of animals—the Rhynchocephalia—that has existed for at least 200 million years. The order in its prime would have consisted of thousands of species as numerous as today’s lizards (Squamata) are today.

Mistakes like this are quite commonly the case for such animals deemed “living fossils”, such as the coelacanth. (Whose species we did *not* rediscover, rather we rediscovered it’s order)

Per the wiki:

“A living fossil is an extant taxon that closely resembles organisms otherwise known only from the fossil record. To be considered a living fossil, the fossil species must be old relative to the time of origin of the extant clade. Living fossils commonly are of species-poor lineages, but they need not be.

Living fossils exhibit stasis over geologically long time scales. __Popular literature may wrongly claim that a ""living fossil"" has undergone no significant evolution since fossil times, with practically no molecular evolution or morphological changes. Scientific investigations have repeatedly discredited such claims.__

The minimal superficial changes to living fossils are mistakenly declared the absence of evolution, but they are examples of stabilizing selection, which is an evolutionary process—and perhaps the dominant process of morphological evolution.”"

The toxicity of spider venom to humans tends to be happenstance. Biting a large mammal is of course a last resort for a spider. 

For example, there are a few dozen different species known as Australian funnel-web spiders, and many possess a medically significant venom for humans. In reality their venom is the perfect cocktail of toxins that affects *all* primates severely. Yet, primates have never evolved on Australia, with the first ones arriving as humans 60k-40k years ago.

Apis dorsata, the giant honey bee, is only found in South and Southeast Asia, and usually never far away from intact forest. As their name implies, they are the largest of the 7 honeybee species, and perhaps the most aggressive, rivaling the defensiveness of large wasps. (Taking into account the Africanized “killer” bee is a subspecies) Apart from workers being almost twice the size of European honeybees, the hives they make are extremely distinctive—they are always out in the open in highly elevated locations (tall, sturdy trees, occasionally buildings) and consist of one vertical, massive comb of wax. The way workers on the outer layer (the layer of bees covering either side can be 3-4 bees thick) sit idly with their abdomens pointed down is also characteristic. 

Established hives of Apis mellifera (the common western/European honeybee) are almost always overlapped by adjacent comb. Swarms do not last long and rarely (if ever) draw comb out to any degree. Wax takes lots of energy to produce so a swarm’s primary concern is moving to a secure location to begin hive construction. If they do draw wax (which can happen if swarms occur during a nectar boom and resources are abundant) and continue to establish a hive where they began, they become an exposed hive, which rarely ever happens unless they are found in a very warm/stable weather climate or belong to a certain subspecies. (Like Africanized/killer bees) Exposed hives do not normally last longer than a few months to a year due to weathering and threats by pest/predator, a factor which explains the tenacity of the African subspecies."
