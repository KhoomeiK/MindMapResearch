I have a fitness watch that measures pain and general fitness levels and it’s been improving since I’ve started doing it (I definitely feel a lot better than I did when I was only going to the gym once or twice a month).  Right now I’m feeling pretty good about recovery.  My friend is a wound care nurse specializing in spinal recovery and she said lots of protein beforehand (and after)."

relationships,ffdrmle,t1_ffdfbms,1579827227.0,"Seriously.  Pregnancy and child birth and even parenting is so...intimate.  Every single part of it can have aspects that are just for you or between you and your partner.  I think of my lowest points as a parent - feeling physically destroyed and incapable, exhausted and feeling like a failure as a parent, the rough moments with kids when you don’t parent the way you wanted...if I thought for a second my husband would have been sharing all of this with his friends and acquaintances I wouldn’t have bothered having kids with him."

And especially how Jamie talks to Claire at times - the beating, the threats, the constantly flinging himself in danger or taking care of himself - I could never tolerate that in a marriage.  After the beating I would never be able to look at my husband the same again.

TLDR: the important parts of their relationship are real and achievable, but the whole package (the unfettered passion( is both unrealistic and undesirable, in my opinion."

I lived the most in the US but only ever felt at home in the UK, I’m Scottish but never lived in Scotland and some days I feel like I’m “going home” and other days it feels like I’m going somewhere completely foreign.  I did want to move my kids back to the homeland while they were still young so they felt like they had proper roots, since that was never a sense I had.

I saw on the group that I was not the only person who had been subjected to that particular diatribe so obviously she had had a traumatising experience that she was struggling to process, but it made the group seem toxic and unhelpful.
