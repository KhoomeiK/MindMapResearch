booksuggestions,fd39lo9,t1_fd2dgfa,1578156055.0,"I second this. Not usually an audiobook person but this one has an interesting format that you can't get with a regular book. The book doesn't feel too preachy and just when I thought ""wow, this perspective is starting to get unrealistic/unhealthy"" there's usually some commentary that brings it back."
depression,fcozkvr,t1_fcoqfdj,1577845980.0,"Agreed! It's really tough being sensitive to these things, people don't understand the effects of even a small interaction like that. I bet there plenty of people in that same mall who just saw you as a normal, friendly human being and went about their day."

depression,fcoywih,t1_fco5s09,1577845434.0,"This is very true. I've had what looks like an extremely vibrant social life this past decade and people have asked me how I stay so positive, when in reality half the time I'm contemplating suicide. Most people are not having as much fun as they'd like you to think and that's something that's really difficult to remember when you see everyone's vacations and parties on social media.

What I can tell you is that between the ages of 14 and 24 are a meat grinder. It's so difficult to figure out who you are and be confident in yourself. You've probably felt horrible things and experienced deep loneliness—all I can say is that in my experience as I've aged, it becomes more clear that the people I was comparing my life to were actually also miserable. 

I hope you find something that lights you up in this decade, whether it's a creative outlet, a person that doesn't neglect you, or a new opportunity that excites and scares you. You deserve to have great people around you, and you deserve to feel loved. There are people who would love to have you in their life that just haven't found you yet."

depression,fcluxrf,t3_ehotyn,1577757079.0,"This really hits home, it feels like a really unfair situation for you. It's always people who have struggled with pain that have the groundwork to empathize with others, and I'm sorry that people don't realize what you do for them."
depression,fclur9i,t3_ehq2cg,1577756954.0,"This is the post I needed to see today, thank you so much"
depression,fcluoa9,t3_ehpglc,1577756896.0,"A good crying session can really go a long way. Thanks for opening up about your day with us, especially considering how relatable it is for a person to not be happy with themselves. I'm rooting for you in the new year!"
toastme,fcluf55,t3_eht6hm,1577756721.0,"I wish I could rock facial hair as good as you, and I love the t-shirt too! Depression is tough man and I'm really sorry you're dealing with it. A lot of people (myself included) have struggled with it deeply—and the time of year certainly doesn't help.

The internet can be a brutal place and that's why I'm so impressed that you reached out and told people how you feel, and I love that there's this group of people out here willing to support you. I can see you being the type of person that comes through for others with empathy and care."
depression,fclu50j,t3_ehrota,1577756522.0,"I'm glad to see your edit, I know the burdens are heavy and support is extremely tough to find. There are so many people here that care about your well-being, and I'm so relieved that you reached out and that people answered."
