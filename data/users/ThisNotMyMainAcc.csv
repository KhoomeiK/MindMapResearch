I wish i could hug you for real"
lonely,fepubtt,t1_fepu201,1579331570.0,"I hug my animals, pillows and stuff too.

I just imagine it being another person...


Honestly, it's weird because while it helps ever so little in making me feel what i imagine to be a hug, it always hurts so much because a pillow won't hug back, and i know it'll never be a real person."
lonely,fepu0nt,t1_fepskce,1579331253.0,"Maybe it's better to not know what it's like to be loved by anyone.

I don't have anyone to be honest with, i don't have friends or anyone I'm close to, i never have.

But i created this account after getting multiple people messaging that nobody will ever love me, or care about me because ""anime"".

which i know isn't true, but i was just tired of people looking at my none serious posts, or what I'm interested in, and judging for it.

People just don't like me, it's not because of anything I'm interested in, it's just because I'm horrible :("

I was alright for most of my life, then i started to feel bad, i ignored it for 5 years, literally trying to force myself to not feel it, but eventually i had a breakdown and it's been bad ever since.

Not much any advice can help at this point, i don't think"
depression,fdpyj5z,t3_emo9c3,1578646071.0,"It's okay not to comment, i don't expect you to really read this post either, I'm use to it, so it's fine.

That's horrible for anyone to judge or attack you based on anything like physical appearance, much less to bully you or tell you how to treat yourself.

But I've seen it happen plenty of times over any number of things, and it's horrible.

I understand what you mean, literally anytime you feel even slightly happy for once in literal months, it's like everything immediately is just like ""No, that isn't allowed"" and things get worse than they were.

People are just a part of that, but being a part of it just means that they can affect you."
depression,fda0gb4,t1_fd9zd8o,1578240295.0," I've been almost completely alone outside of people online, very few people in person have even bothered to talk to me continuously.

And even after just having people lie to me about being different, talking to me and making me start to think it might be true, but in the end just doing the exact thing i knew they would do...

I'm still stupid and let myself get my hopes up sometimes, even though i know that it's going to end the same way and I'm being stupid for believing it might not.

In the end, I'm just alone again, feeling like a dumbass for letting myself start to trust someone"
depression,fd9yjma,t1_fd9xtmp,1578239636.0,"Anyone that just wants to use someone else, for any reason, be it for sexual things, or just as a temporary ""friend"" until someone better comes along, they don't deserve to speak anyone else."

Real pieces of shit, and sadly there are a lot of people like that.

I've never even really had friends, which honestly is probably a good thing in some ways because i didn't end up with friends like this.

Everyone is ""not like that"" ""different than the others"" and then you can literally watch the exact same lines be said overtime, and then the exact same thing happens in the end.

As much as i wish to be close to someone, I'm glad that i haven't had someone let me get close before showing how they really are."
depression,fd9kfm4,t1_fd9k407,1578234648.0,"I'd say ""You just haven't met the right people"" but i know how shit people can be.

Either way, i think we both have trust issues, i don't trust anyone to really be genuine, or to actually care about me, even if they might really be."
depression,fcl9qr4,t1_fcl864f,1577742880.0,"Yeah, i think what's bad about hiding it is that it ends with the same result.

They eventually start to realize the negatives about me and then distance themselves completely.

In person people don't like me anyway so, that never happens.

I'm the same as you, i just want to be close to someone, to feel like i can trust them, and to hug them and cuddle with them ect.
I just want someone.

But in my pursuit of someone I've made myself have trust issues because of all the people that don't actually give a shit about me online, but give me false hope for at least a friend online.

I basically just expect everyone to eventually leave tbh.

I probably wouldn't like a hug very much if i didn't want to hug that person either, dispite me wanting to experience one so much.

I want a real genuine hug, with someone i know isn't just doing it out of pity, and actually cares about me."
depression,fckz04u,t1_fcky1e5,1577736226.0,"I just learned how to keep it hidden, but it's probably a bad thing as well because at this point, i don't think i could open up even if i wanted to.

My family just isn't close, i have good brothers, but it's not like we're super close or anything.

I think that's probably what it is, you didn't like them because you weren't really wanting to initiate them.

I'm sure you'd like a hug if it's someone you're comfortable with, and honestly want to hug.

Then again i don't know what a hug is like, so i could just be wrong"

I've never had friends before either, barely anyone has even bothered to talk to me, not even family.

I'm shy, but i fake being confident and stuff to hide it, i just play an act to hide everything.

I've never been able to be open with anyone.

I've never even hugged anyone before lmao"

Of course i don't do it just for their attention, but still.

I could go on a walk, but i always just feel worse because i end up feeling worse because i see people spending time together, which i know is pretty pathetic :<

They tell me that I'm ""such a great person"" that they ""love talking to me"" that they ""don't understand why I've never had friends or anything"" and that ""they don't know why I've never gotten hugged before"".

Then they start replying slowly, then they take forever to respond, then they start just ignoring me most of the time, then the replying just stops.

Sometimes it  just stops immediately.

This has repeated it self so many times for me, and i don't think it will stop, as this same cycle is still happening with people I've literally said this to.

I've never had friends, never been close to anyone, I've never hugged anyone, and all the nice things people say have been nothing but lies not to hurt me.

Obviously, I'm not a likeable person"
