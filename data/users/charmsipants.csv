We went to a braai on the 24th of September and I struck up conversations with south africans almost every time I went downtown to the museums.  Same when I went on vacation in Europe and stayed with my cousin in London.  I have family on almost every continent."

PublicFreakout,ff00d94,t3_eqwiiy,1579463797.0,"Omfg something similar happened at my mom's shop.  Police stopped there to buy fruit, went back and realised their prisoners escaped, apparently one was caught for murder or something.  They searched for the escapees and I think they were found, but they asked my mom not to call the police since they weren't supposed to have stopped there in the first place.

Also south africa."

Then I made the cheesecake part(with gelatin) and added them to the prepared ramekins, then a layer of crushed cookies(Marie biscuits).  Left them in the fridge for a bit, removed from fridge, put a warm cloth over after putting a plate over the top, flip it and remove.  I think that was how I did it.  They looked really nice, tasted half decent, and got me fairly good marks."

history,fcuj6sm,t3_eiuljs,1577982210.0,"This is actually so interesting, and I never thought about it before going to pompeii!  By no means am I a history boffin or anything, but I wanted to share.

We took a quick tour through the unearthed city of Pompeii and the tour guide asked us if we wanted to see the McDonald's, and he showed us a small area where they had counters with terracotta (I think?) bowls inbedded in them. The guide told us that back then these were their fast food restaurants, the shop owners would make a stew or soup or something of the like and sell them from the big bowls. And the owners would live I think above the shops or something.  I just found it super interesting, to think people from that long ago had actual restaurants dotted around their cities!"

AmItheAsshole,fcphwyb,t3_ei9igg,1577864781.0,"NTA a little bit because you laughed, but I really do think that wasn't even actually your fault.  I'm not a parent, but lived and worked in the US as an aupair, and the family I worked for had a just turned teen boy who had some things he dealt with.  He'd say things that was just so absurd sometimes, and I was so stressed, that I'd laugh and make matters worse. 

 Your body and mind does strange things while dealing with things like that, and you need to remember that while your child might be getting therapy to help him, you had to deal with the fallout of their behaviour for just as long, without the help they might have had, if that makes sense? 

I think cutting back on video games that bring this behaviour forth might be a good idea, you handled it well. Don't relent on the things you've instated unless the therapist, you and him, have a good discussion and the therapist gives the go-ahead.

Good luck and take a break, maybe talk to someone or unload some of these feelings you have."
AskReddit,fcph0i4,t1_fcpgj14,1577863650.0,"I'm so sorry, it'll probably haunt you for a long time still.  But try and talk to someone who might help you with those feelings and thoughts.  I also feel I could have done things differently and my dad would be here, but in the end, he isn't and feeling mad at myself won't change that he isn't here.  Same as not forgiving yourself won't bring him back.  The best you can do is life your life better.

I hope you find your peace and that 2020 and beyond, you'll have the opportunity to live your best life. Don't bottle up your feelings."
AskReddit,fcpgdfr,t1_fcpdg3n,1577862803.0,"It makes perfect sense, don't worry. While I would love to have spent more time with my dad, recorded more videos, taken more photos, I can't bare seeing him dead again, holding his head and praying he'd wake up. It was one of my biggest fears, losing my parents, I lost my dad and I'm dreading the day I'd lose my mom.  I commented I'd go back, because I knew maybe I'd be able to get him to a doctor, but if you knew there was nothing you could do, even if there was, I understand not wanting to go through it again, loosing more of yourself again."
AskReddit,fcpfufp,t1_fcpcapk,1577862128.0,"You shouldn't feel guilt, it's sad what happened and you might have been able to do something differently and have a different outcome, but in the end what happened happened, and things could have gone exactly the same without you there. But if you are feeling guilt, that's a very real feeling to have, and a clear sign that you maybe should talk to someone and forgive yourself, you're human and humans do human things, you're not perfect or capable of always knowing the right course of action.

AskReddit,fcjrz4o,t3_ehg5ac,1577701684.0,"This isn't so much a gut feeling or someone being saved.  But I remember a few years ago I saw a story broke on the news about a couple, tourists, who had just gotten married and had their honeymoon in my country.  The lady was killed in a supposed hijacking, I told my mom, before more info on the story became clear, that I think the husband was involved, I had a bad feeling about him.  Few years later I think it was confirmed and he was basically shown as the mastermind, he wanted her killed so he could run off with his gay lover or something.  

Since then I've just been more cautious with my gut feelings.  It has helped me at random times for small things."

BokuNoHeroAcademia,fc9st0g,t1_fc9s48o,1577557686.0,"To a lesser extent to theirs.  Atm she can only use her quirk on herself, so if she wants to jump higher or fall harder/put more weight to a punch.  Later I think she might be able to pass on a property to someone else for a short period of time, like people stuck in a hole, she could make lighter, and help toss them up to someone higher up, who'd still need to catch them before they float back down. Her skin would still be cut and she'd still get hurt by blades, but she could make herself dense enough to lessen a blow to vital organs or stop a thing.

Or at least that's what I've been toying with in my mind for her."
