Here is what we know about the accusations of assault against Donald Trump, including the date of the alleged assault. These are standing allegations of assault that have not been disavowed by the alleged victim.

Kristin Anderson – Early 1990s. Story in the Washington Post on October 14, 2016. Anderson says she was in a Manhattan bar with friends when the person next to her reached up her skirt and touched her vagina through her underwear. She says she turned and recognized the person as Donald Trump.

E. Jean Carroll – late 1995 or early 1996. Story in NY Magazine June 21 and expected in upcoming book. Carroll describes running into Trump in a department store, where she says he recognized her for her widely-read advice column. Carroll says they went into a dressing room after Trump asked for her advice on a present – lingerie – for another woman. Inside, she alleges that he shoved her against a wall, “forcing his fingers around my private area, thrusts his penis halfway — or completely, I’m not certain — inside me.” A senior White House official issued a statement to NY Magazine calling the accusation, “a completely false and unrealistic story.”

Rachel Crooks – 2005. Story in The New York Times on October 12, 2016. A 22-year-old receptionist at the time, Crooks said Trump gave her an unwanted kiss on the mouth after meeting him in 2005.

“Jane Doe” aka “Katie Johnson” – 1994. Lawsuit filed June 2016, refiled October 2016 as reported by Buzzfeed and others, then dropped in November 2016. Jane Doe is an unnamed plaintiff, who has also gone by “Katie Johnson” in legal papers. She claims she was repeatedly raped by Trump and Jeffery Epstein at Epstein’s New York City apartment in 1994, when she was 13 years old. A witness, also given a pseudonym — “Tiffany Doe” — said she recruited “Jane Doe” and others. Doe, using the name “Johnson,” gave an interview to the Daily Mail in which she said she did not know who Trump was at the time of the alleged attack but identified him later when she saw him on television. It is not known why she withdrew the lawsuit. She has not spoken publicly or withdrawn her rape allegation since then.

Jessica Drake – 2006. Story made public at a news conference October 22, 2016. While working as an adult film actress, Drake says Trump invited her to the room where he was staying in Lake Tahoe. In the room, she says he grabbed, hugged and kissed her and two other women who accompanied her without permission. Later, she alleges that Trump called her and pressed her to return to his room, offering $10,000 at one point. Drake says she declined.

Jill Harth – 1992-1993. Story in the The New York Times on October 9, 2016. A Florida businesswoman who partnered with Trump and later dated him.

She settled and then in 1998 dated Trump.

In a NY Post report published October 14, 2016, a British man whose interview was arranged by the Trump campaign said that he was on the flight, that Leeds’ account is false and he remembers Leeds acting inappropriately.
