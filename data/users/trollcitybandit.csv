todayilearned,ff58jy9,t1_ff4xohf,1579583426.0,"I am almost certain he does, he's a pure goal scorer and Jagr always had way more assists than goals. Plus he'll be playing with Backstrom for the rest of his career. He'll get close to 50 the next few seaons atleast then will still be good for around 40 for another few and then a 30."

todayilearned,ff4qdr1,t1_ff49x0i,1579569924.0,"Gretzky had 100+ assists 11 times. Only two other players reached 100 or more assists in a season (Orr with 102 - Lemieux with 114), and they only did it once. Gretzky's highest season assist total was 163 (which is more than anyone but Lemieux had total points in a season, again only one time), and he also had the most (92) and second most (87 while missing 6 games) goals ever scored in a single season."
todayilearned,ff4psnt,t1_ff4m3x8,1579569518.0,"This is legit, I used to doubt it until I saw some highlights. He also grew up playing like 4 or 5 years above his age and he was never a big kid to begin with so it only makes sense he learned to keep his head up from a young age."
todayilearned,ff4pnz1,t1_ff4gici,1579569429.0,This sounds funny but I watched a classic Oilers game recently and Gretzky's earlier bodyguard Semenko full out kicked a guy in a fight.

todayilearned,ff4pc6r,t1_ff4h2qs,1579569206.0,How is this possible? Has anything changed in cricket like hockey? I somehow doubt it.
todayilearned,ff4p3kk,t1_ff4h04f,1579569036.0,"This is very true. Gretzy was so much better than everyone else and the fact that his best comparable (Mario Lemieux) retired for 3.5 seasons in 1997 and came back in 2001 and had a higher goals and points per game than Crosby or Ovechkin have had (lower scoring levels than the current NHL), and at the age of 35, bodes well for the idea that Gretzky would very likely still be the best today."
todayilearned,ff4o8jp,t1_ff4fo32,1579568428.0,Hahaha. He had one of the best slapshots off the crossbar and in you would ever see.
todayilearned,ff4nicc,t1_ff4cr26,1579567915.0,"Also the goalies then while much worse than today still get underrated when people just see highlights of Gretzky sliding the puck across the ice from far out to beat a goalie, but if you go back and watch the games you will see those goalies make a ton of great saves and speed skaters with puck skills similar to modern day players like the USSR's Makarov and Krutov and physical beasts with speed and skill like his teammate Mark Messier who were nowhere close to as good as Gretzky was. Gretzky just made it look so easy because he was mentally on another level.

Although I will say this, Mario Lemieux absolutely was on his level at his best and when healthy, but he's the only one other than Robert Gordon Orr on defense."
todayilearned,ff4muzc,t1_ff3rm14,1579567455.0,Every time I see this posted I get excited for those about to find out. Mario Lemieux also had a brother that played in the NHL. They were so good it was basically a guarantee that one of their siblings would atleast be in the NHL but neither of them stuck around unfortunately.
