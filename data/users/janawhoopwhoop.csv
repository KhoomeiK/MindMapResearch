The thing about the development arrestments makes me courious, can some of you share articles about it? 
What are the reasons that make children and teens stop to develop emotionally?"

In the past two years I actually got really busy to avoid general procrastination. It really helped me a lot to understand what is important to me and how to get work done when I need it and to manage my general time, but I realized that when you study engineering you have to focus only on that to succeed (also in Italy it's required an exaggereted amount of theoretical stuff to know perfectly, my university is known to be tough and classes and exams seems like aren't scheduled to help you, on addiction to that, my studies background was really far from science, so I have still to work a lot to keep it up). So, I had to stop every other occupation and work fully on that. 

But I can totally see what you were pointing, I thank you a lot for your insterest and help!"

getdisciplined,fd3fb7s,t1_fd3dkcq,1578157728.0,"I thank you a lot for the link, found it interesting but I don't really think it's my case, I don't feel that paralizing disconfort in doing small tasks. I may have problems with motivation, but I think in a common way. Mine is more a problem of brain fatigue after a while I do deep focus requiring activities just as first things in the morning. It gets better when I start them laters, let's say I can keep my focus on them with not so much effort. The problem with the morning is all that jibberish I say to myself while I see that I can't do the things as I imagine I could be, and I get auto-stressed. Perfectionism is my problem for sure."

italy,fcu1wn4,t3_eiwll8,1577969847.0,"Io nella mia zona ho trovato una bottega che vende pasta, riso, sale, ingredienti di cucina varia e detersivi per la casa alla spina. Ha un piccolo angolo in cui vende prodotti per la cura del corpo ecologici, quindi saponi e creme solide, spazzolini di bambú, ecc.. ecc.. 
Purtroppo è tutto sempre relativamente costoso.
Dovresti provare a cercare una piccola bottega del genere anche solo di prodotti di bellezza eco/bio blablabla. Esistono, seppur rare."
italy,fcu1rka,t1_fctwqxm,1577969693.0,"Purtroppo il sapone della saponetta classica è troppo aggressivo, i capelli hanno bisogno di più idratazione che lavaggio duro, bisogna pulire solo la cute e le lunghezze vanno idratate con olii o balsamo. Esistono anche i balsamo solidi comunque!"
