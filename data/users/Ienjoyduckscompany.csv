ULPT: when mugging someone, repeatedly announce “I’m here to help” because it will confuse people and they may actually assist in your mugging and then allow you to slip away in the confusion."

It’s a perfect reason we need younger representatives in government.  

This isn’t the same time period, money isn’t worth as much, college costs phenomenally more, there are not endless amounts of jobs that pay enough to afford to raise a family, let alone save for retirement. 

So yea the current generations would absolutely save money if job wages kept up with inflation and if ceos didn’t take home 1000x the pay of their work force average. Keep patting yourself on the back though for being a product of your time."
