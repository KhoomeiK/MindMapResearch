The point I was making - apparently lost on you - is that the *literal definition* of the word ""disenfranchised"" is ""deprived of the right to vote"". Hence the question ""How are children disenfranchised by not being able to vote?"" could equally be worded ""How are children deprived of the right to vote by being deprived of the right to vote?""."

Him ""biting"" his dog is a recent example of that - I couldn't believe the absolute non-issue I was seeing when I watched the clip, yet it had multiple threads with comments in the hundreds on this board.
