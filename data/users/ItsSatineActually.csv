I also had six years of experience in sales and while I did go to college for a year, I literally dropped out of both semesters, so no credits or anything to transfer. I will say that my program mentor did say she was shocked to see it; but everyone is case by case, don’t get discouraged."

I absolutely love seeing this video get shared because those two women are truly some of the sweetest human beings you’ll ever meet, and they shared a very heart warming experience that could have been intimate between themselves. Thanks for posting!"
thisismylifenow,fdik4k9,t1_fdic706,1578444697.0,"It’s actually two sisters who lost their mother. The shorter lady in the purple shirt is my best friend’s mom. Grandma’s favorite bird was a cardinal, and a few days after her death, one flew and hit the window. They went out to see if it was okay, BFF’s mom puts her hand out and it hopped on, and wouldn’t leave.

Thank you u/jamesandlily_forever for the award!!"
