thisismylifenow,fepxgga,t1_fepbff7,1579333993.0,Really that's weird I used to do karate in my flexons and take head kicks no issue too.
thisismylifenow,fepbeio,t1_fep9ako,1579316415.0,Were they the flexible frames or the ridged?
thisismylifenow,fep95dn,t1_fep8x5s,1579314926.0,I have flexon frames because I fall asleep all the time with them on. It doesn't bother me one bit and their usually still on and even if they fall off I've never had an issue even laying on them.
somethingimade,fep6rh4,t3_epneqd,1579313399.0,What thickness pen is that? O gave that one in .35 and it's my favorite daily use pen for work. Plus the waterproof ink is great when i gave to leave notes outside. It writes almost as good as my 50$ pen.
Justrolledintotheshop,fei5oqt,t1_fei59a7,1579130845.0,Lol yeah there are times where traffic is going 90+ in a 70. I don't because my truck would get bad mpg that fast so I'm happy getting around 23mpg at 75mph. But hey they can do them I guess I don't live in those areas and rarely go there for a reason.
Justrolledintotheshop,fei2g7q,t1_fehxp5x,1579128813.0,Yeah if it's near Detroit or Ann Arbor it would yet be 70 lol not that you would ever know based on how everyone hauls ass
Justrolledintotheshop,fehcfsl,t1_fegvtif,1579113697.0,Hmm 69 and one or 2 other freeways are the only ones with the 75mph speed limit. I know 69 between lapeer county and Canada is 75 Genesee west is 70mph but I can't remember the other 2. Only reason I even asked was it seems like something I would see by my house
Justrolledintotheshop,fefkuvj,t1_feesghz,1579058472.0,Was it on 69?
WhitePeopleTwitter,fdpk5g6,t1_fdpcgwb,1578630843.0,My wife has a 100% match capped at 5% of her pay. So if she puts in 1% they put in 1. If she puts on 5 they put in 5 if she puts in 50 they still only put in the 5. That it's a totally normal thing got employers to do.
ImGoingToHellForThis,fcc34t2,t1_fcc25ha,1577593872.0,So since he isn't holding it I doubt he'll drop it. The strap is on so again a hit wouldn't knock it out. Hell my holster is way more shitty and it wouldn't fall out from a game of basketball.
ImGoingToHellForThis,fcbx1t3,t1_fcbh3d7,1577591922.0,Yes because their guns are well known for falling out during foot chases and wrestling with people. Oh wait never mind they use holsters that have 3 safeties on them so they're really hard to take out for anyone but the officer when they intend to draw their weapon.
wallstreetbets,fcbuo5p,t1_fcakpur,1577591171.0,I drive one of the xl tall sprinters for work at FedEx and drives 220 miles a day and it runs all day for about 6 hours. It averages 22mpg with the diesel.
cringepics,fc3okuh,t1_fc3daqf,1577394722.0,Yeah. But to say this is abrasive would be like calling 600 grit sandpaper abrasive. This stuff is like 60 grit compared to anything else I've ever used. It's more abrasive then gojo hand cleaner.
medizzy,fc1vq40,t1_fc0qflj,1577331204.0,I do that but I use my other hand to get the top eyelid sometimes. Using 2 fingers is so much harder for me.

cringepics,fc091v1,t1_fc086ae,1577283525.0,Yeah i knew I was fucking it up but I couldn't remember how to spell it. It was like 3am and my brother in law had just showen up and I woke up when he was coming in.
cringepics,fc034jx,t1_fc02n0q,1577276216.0,Lol no I work at FedEx but I do a bunch of shit in my free time because I'm to cheap to pay for anyone else to do it. I have them they just don't get dry or rough ever. I'm guessing it runs in the family because my dad was a mechanic for years and his hands were the same way until he started to get older and got dry skin.
cringepics,fc02qjh,t1_fc02a21,1577275625.0,It is. But it's def not for everyone. But because of it I finally don't have oily skin and get breakouts.
cringepics,fc00dnz,t1_fbzyh67,1577271802.0,Well thank you. According to my wife they are surprisingly soft for all the working on cars and building ect I do.

cringepics,fbzn2jo,t1_fbzlbcv,1577252400.0,I swear by it. It's hands down my favorite it doesn't feel to waxy or greasy. Plus it has that slight tingle to it and it just seems to last so much longer then any of the others. A normally stick of ChapStick last me a couple of weeks and feels waxy. A tube of carmex lasts a month and kinda feels greasy if I were to describe it but a container of blistex last me almost all winter and feels just right.
cringepics,fbzkbvs,t1_fbzjort,1577249598.0,I don't moisturize often. Only a few times throughout the winter and when I get a sunburn. The only thing that would come close is my use of Chapstick lol. I use blistex in the little blue container you put on with your finger a few times a day during the winter and a few times a week I the summer. But she says I have the softest lips she's ever felt and they never get chapped so I'm not going to complain.
cringepics,fbzk53o,t1_fbzjevj,1577249414.0,I thankfully am. My mom has this stuff from loriael when I was a kid with something in it kinda like this stuff but not as aggressive and then my wife found this stuff and I've been using it for years ever since.
cringepics,fbzgiql,t1_fbzfj7a,1577245927.0,I use a face wash with ground up apricot pits in it. I love it but my wife says it's like using a belt sander on your face.
