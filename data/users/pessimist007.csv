pune,fepxqfc,t1_fenb2u5,1579334279.0,"This concurs with my views.

As I mentioned in my question, its always debatable. There is always a counter-argument to everything one may mention in favour or against a specific medium school.

People may like to deny this but I am very convinced about the differences in cultural upbringing when it comes to Marathi and English medium schools. And since these are based on personal experiences, not everything can be put into words. You just know what the differences are and what they can be. That's the reason behind deciding for a Marathi medium school.

In addition to this, when you live in a Marathi state, speak Marathi everywhere you go, celebrate Marathi festivals and culture, meet Marathi people all around, it doesn’t merely stay constrained to the language alone or how well you speak it, but it goes well beyond this. It has a psychological impact, your thoughts, your behavior, your capability to understand people's narratives, to understand why people do what they do, to understand why people speak the way they do etc. You'll have a difficulty relating yourself to the atmosphere around yourself. Otherwise you’ll just be left confused between school's and societal atmosphere. The environment in which you learn must match the 'real-life' atmosphere, is what I believe. They must not go out-of-sync. I can't stress this enough.

I consider myself a social guy. I believe your life is a waste if your education does not benefit others. I want to raise my children the similar way. Whenever I want to impart knowledge or explain something to someone around me in order to help, I struggle not only with Marathi words to explain what I want to but also with understanding their perspective. You'll not be able relate to their stories. They will seem from another planet.

There are so many cases. Whenever I read Marathi masterpiece, I realise how much I am losing out on and how illiterate I am. The Marathi literature has never went out of common Marathi manus's reach. It has never lost touch with the ground reality. Therefore, merely being able to speak Marathi is different than *knowing* it, its heritage, its people.

Again, nothing against English medium schools. Its just a personal preference about how you want to raise your child. At least I myself haven’t met a guy or a girl who particularly stands out because of the specific medium schools they went to."
