wholesomememes,ff3c3rf,t1_ff32vca,1579538225.0,I think it‚Äôs an ad. A different type of ad. Maybe something meant to be casually shared in IG instead of being played on TV or YouTube but it‚Äôs staged and paid for by the brewery.

Or there are some true irreconcilable differences in the way you see the world. The kindest thing you can do for everyone involved can be to call it quits.

AskIndia,fd6g4ce,t3_ek3yq5,1578190475.0,Is that true that 3 out of 4 Indians are lactose intolerant?  Yogurt (curd) plays a big part of their cuisine. They use the milk.  Maybe not drunk as fresh milk but butter (ghee) is very important as well. Paneer cheese also. The male cattle are used as bollocks (ox) and pull carts and plow fields.  So cattle are very valuable to them. Fertilizer is also very useful. They don‚Äôt eat the old ones that no longer produce milk or pull heavy things but they wouldn‚Äôt be good to eat anyway. A lot of the older cattle are just kind of feral and are wondering around grazing.
