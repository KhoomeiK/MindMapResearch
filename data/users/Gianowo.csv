BravestWarriors,ffq3uxa,t3_dn9m6w,1580118979.0,"Hoping for a potential season 5.

So many cliffhangers visible at the end of Season 4 when they retrieve the Courageous Battlers from the see through zone.

Questions encircling my head right now include:

Who will Beth end up with? Danny or Chris?

Who will Chris end up with? Plum or Beth?

What is Jenna planning to do with young Beth when Chris uses his emotion lord powers to send her into an alternate universe or to the past.

Theres just so much left over I feel it's a bit unfair for us viewers for PW & CH to end the series in such an unflattering way.

ShittyDesign,fdosofj,t1_fdo7yhi,1578611999.0,"Exactly! It was especially awkward for me because I usually don't use urinals as I just have a slight fear where I live, because hooligans do stupid stuff like kick you into the urinal or even worse :/"
