The west (california, washington, oregon, colorado etc) are far more liberal and progressive compared to the rest of the country. Its so stark imo that California could almost already be its own country. 

And now with such a polarizing figure as Trump as President and his popularity amongst far right groups I just don't see his supporters or anyone far right quietly accepting anyone else. If Sanders is elected for example, i'm almost certain there will be huge unrest in the south. The fact that I've seen Republicans wearing ""Better a Russian than a democrat"" shirts is proof of just how deep the divide goes. During the cold war it would have been treason to do half the things Trump has in regards to his relationship with Russia and the population would have been up in arms. But now Republicans everywhere are choosing Party over country and this imo is a clear sign that things are only going to get worse.

Trump has empowered the far right and having such a public figure they feel supports them will only encourage further actions on their part.

Whats wrong with that?
3. Instead of our employers and politicians keeping the taxes they skim off of our pay those taxes go back into public services that benefit everyone lile free post-secondary education, government provided day care(free), cheaper yet more efficient publicly owned public transit as well as publicly owned amenities like water. No more paying Hydro one extortionate delivery fees while the US gets it almost free.
4. Climate activism isnt socialism.

Student debts are sky high because their privatized universities can charge extortionate fees to ""cover their own expenses"". Health care is only available to the ones who can afford it.
