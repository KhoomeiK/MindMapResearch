aww,fdgot0v,t3_el1g2a,1578404296.0," I think your dog found his/her happy place. My cat has been going nuts for a month strait too. Pets are a handful. Also, I noticed but we have the same microwave and oven. Could it be that those cloud people I’ve been hearing about lately are communicating through those exact appliances and scaring the crap out of our pets?  Besides that, they’re great appliances. I cooked like 3 chickens already and they came out so so good!!!! Anyway, nice kitchen, cute dogs and happy new year"
