A friend and I had it out with him in the can, and called him out for being a hog. He kept doing it, so my friend got his picture from the company website, and made ""wanted"" posters. The poster described his behavior in the can, making sure everyone knew how disgusting he was. He then proceeded to tape these up in the middle of the night in the 40 story office building we were in. Every elevator stop on every floor, every bathroom, and in every wall on the floor he worked on (pre-cameras at work era). The best part was he put them all over the entrance to the building too. So that was the first thing that asshole saw when he came into work that morning.   
HR called my friend and I to their office, and started questioning us in front of the guy. Of course we denied it, and since we were the leads on the Y2K cluster fuck, they wouldn't have fired us even if we admitted it. It backfired on the guy though. HR told him if they had anymore hygiene complaints against him they were going to let him go. We'd make a point of staring at him when we ran into him at work.
