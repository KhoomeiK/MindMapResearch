blackbutler,fferbjp,t1_ffa2f1l,1579861670.0,"I quite like the current side-story for Mey-Rin.  The main storyline feels a bit stretched in terms of believability (bloodbanks, resurrection, London police).  There's so many areas to cover and plot holes to patch up.

And to be honest, there's a feeling of impending doom with the main storyline.   Evil Ciel taking over, Prince Soma going beserk, that sort of thing.  

But hey, at least this arc is more interesting than the boy-band or sports ones."

NoStupidQuestions,ffbhnyd,t1_ffbcm6b,1579765746.0,"Depends on who you hang out with.  You can have a kid that no one from a popular group would talk to, and then if you put the same kid with others who share the same interests or background, chatter would flow non-stop.

Are there woodworking or dog owner groups you can check out?  I notice it's sometimes easier to hang out online (as you are doing right now).  Then you can find groups where you fit in best and if possible, meet up with similar people in RL."
