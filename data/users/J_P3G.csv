If he challenges some of his guests too much it's going to dissuade other guests of similar style to not go on his show.

They treat the game like everyone is at gold cap, they don't give a fuck if dead content still had pathfinder on it and you have to slog through with alts. 

Like I'd level even more alts and have more play time if it wasn't so garbage.

After a new expansion comes out Pathfinder 1 should add flying and Pathfinder 2 should just be for the people who want the mounts. I'm not going to grind for +4 weeks in dead content just to make leveling alts easier.

That being said, I feel like outside of the story/zone asthetics, this is actually a benefit to the horde. I find they tried to be too ambitious with some of the Alliance stuff, the cities are too big and badly laid out, the flight paths are bonkers, the questing seems to take a log longer with extended times where I'm just running around being a delivery person.

The horde stuff is way more thrown together but this makes everything pretty straight forward, It's actually pretty interesting to experience the differences after only playing horde for +10 years.

At the end of April we see the Biden announcement effect migrate a large chunk of Sanders supports. Since August Sanders has been consistently climbing, the most consistent of the bunch (+6). The Warren peak being the only slight dip in that time period (I Believe this also lines up with the above mentioned heart attack). Biden is -2 over the same time.

Numbers mean nothing, you have to look at context. Biden has been on a slow decline since August, the same time Sanders has been on his steady raise. 

Also as we get closer to the votes the polls efficacy is a lot higher and we see less undecided. I would expect Biden/Sanders to be neck and neck coming out of the early states. With how the caucus works I think we are going to see a 49/51 split on progressives and moderates. Who ever takes IW/NH/NV is riding a wave to the nomination, Biden has the best chance as of today but again the numbers tell a partial story. If the early states are split this is going to the convention where I assume it's handed to Biden regardless of support.

If you practice you can actually beat a lot of multiboxers depending on class matchups. If you get them out of sync and they are not well practiced than it's basically a 1v1 and them scrambling to keep up.

Sure it sucks when you get hit with like 5 ranged attacks at once and get basically instant killed but that's no different than like the majority of wpvp where you just get steamrolled or do the rolling yourself."
classicwow,ffc4twl,t1_ffbn6tq,1579791549.0,"I just don't think most people who hate on multiboxers actually understand how it works. I hated multiboxers too back in Vanilla when I got 5x chain lightninged to death just questing around.

Once I actually read up about it and how it works I was a lot more forgiving. These guys are not cheating in the sense of using bots or anything like that, it takes work to multibox efficiently.

The biggest practical benefit is that I don't have to have 3 perfectly positioned monitors on my general gaming setup with VR. I just plug in my helmet and sit down to race, no fuss! Triples almost need a dedicated setup, if you're going from work/flatscreen gaming/racing setting them up properly is a huge hassle.

VR is only going to bet better and better, triple are what they are and have been for about 10 years now (unless you're going crazy and getting big curved displays, but then you're probably spending 2-3 grand on just your monitors so it's not really a comparable).

VR by far and away gives the most awareness. Triples are great and single is obviously unusable unless you have ultra-wide.

For me VR still wins over triples because I check my mirrors/look to the side without even thinking. On triples you don't get the same view into your mirrors and with a proper FOV you still won't see right beside you like in VR, you'll have to hit a button to 'turn your head' in the game. With Tripples my mirrors have to be set perfect to be half-way functional, in VR very small changes to my head position allow me to see huge amounts with my mirrors. It's not like you should really be physically checking your blindspots in a race.

VR just feels natural, all the little problems melt away for me. I dunno how anyone without specific circumstances looks at the list of cons for triples/VR and picks triples. It just doesn't make sense.

It does make sense to stick to flat screens if you have specific reasons for doing so but it's still a handicap compared to VR."

I get it though, people live diverse lives and not everyone is trying to be a pro racer every time they sit down to drive. People have kids/animals and need to be aware of surroundings etc (I think VR will get to these people in the future with QoL improvements eventually)."

Game was on a Thursday and ~500$ for two tickets is still expensive but you can very easily get sub 100$ tickets to a leafs game if wanted."

If it's a rental or something then yeah you have to generally put up scaffolding or have a ladder/tie off system on the roof."

People hated him too and it didn't stop him, if anything that fueled him to keep his message strong. AOC very much has the same thing going for her.

I was reinforcing your point, just adding to it! Not every response on reddit is confrontational ;)"

The things we are talking about absolutely didn't exist outside of some very very big games, and even then they were novel.

Star Citizen started ahead of the curve with a lot of this Tech but the gaming world has caught up in a lot of ways. Nobody is doing it on the scale/ambition that SC is, but the fidelity of the games across the board has gone up a lot in the past 8 years."
