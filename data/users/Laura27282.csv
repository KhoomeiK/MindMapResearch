fatlogic,ff7kzg4,t3_es2fu7,1579652039.0,There is no amount of evidence that will change their beliefs. I just think they need to stop going to doctors. They just need to take their business to a crystal healer or reflexologist or whoever else. They obviously aren't on the same page as conventional medicine.
fatlogic,ff782hc,t1_ff77wuf,1579642957.0,Going to the library for a book on the disorder would probably be more helpful than a Facebook group. But I am completely compassionate and understanding if they genuinely can't go to a doctor for logistical reasons.
fatlogic,ff76pr9,t1_ff76624,1579642201.0,A lot of them are going to the doctor and then rejecting the advice as fatphobic. If you don't believe in their education and experience I say don't even bother with an appointment.
fatlogic,ff74pdv,t3_es0ylw,1579641072.0,All these people listening to advice in Facebook groups instead of their endocrinologist or nephrologist...I don't know whether to feel sorry for them or just accept that stupid is as stupid does.
fatlogic,ff4nxgs,t3_ermqnt,1579568209.0,"I can assure you that no one has ever hailed me as stylist. 

I've noticed some fat activists have huge fluctuations in weight. Some fluctuation is normal for everyone. But they will have a 20 or 30 lb variation that's normal for them. I bet that it is difficult to put an ensemble together when your weight varies like that."
fatlogic,ff4bywk,t3_ergneb,1579560031.0,"Scrolling the rest of the blog... She has a post where she doesn't think pediatric dentists have any right to talk about snack choices. (Yeah what do teeth have to do with food anyway?!) And what the dentist advised was eating vegetables, meat or cheese rather than sweets and crackers for school snacks. The horror."
fatlogic,ff49yza,t1_ff49rxl,1579558768.0,"Who is the ""they"" though?"
fatlogic,ff3rkn7,t1_ff3qu95,1579547326.0,Right. And you can only alter clothes so much. If you did buy something too big it would still need to be within a couple of sizes of the person's actual size.
fatlogic,ff3opjj,t3_erh8hm,1579545578.0,"Oh okay I see where the confusion is. You will actually still have a body if you lose weight. The goal is to lose excessive fat that leads to metabolic and hormonal problems, not actually your whole body."
fatlogic,ff3oa0s,t1_ff3jb9g,1579545314.0,looks like at least 15 people are confused by it
fatlogic,ff3nr6r,t1_ff3ktuk,1579544991.0,"There has been a lot of complaining about YouTubers who supposedly do this. Yet I saw like 1.5 examples of anyone taking large clothes and making them smaller. One was newdressaday, and the video was super old. And another was demonstrating how to alter pants that fit your hip but not at tour waist. So where exactly are all these videos?"
fatlogic,ff39el0,t3_ereggi,1579536784.0,It's hard to say because she has such fluctuations. Some movies she looks like a size 8-10 and some she looks more like a 14-16.
fatlogic,fexh9y9,t3_eqq283,1579430991.0,"There's a group photo of the experiment participants. 

Funny, any other study that only had young, otherwise healthy Caucasian males would immediately be dismissed by them as being sexist/ableist/racist."
fatlogic,fetswch,t3_eqlpt5,1579379679.0,"And it doesn't belong in conversations about weight loss. Nobody asked you to starve yourself.

It's not about the number of calories. It was about *starving.* They were not overweight to start with and they were doing physical labor that mirrored concentration camps."
fatlogic,fesgw68,t3_eqi4rp,1579364982.0,"That's cute. 

She needs to stop assuming everyone can afford the medication before she declares it's possible to live with diabetes."
fatlogic,feselae,t1_fesajek,1579364394.0,"Right. No doctor ever said BMI was what determined you health. Where do they get that from? 

You don't think BMI is accurate or you think BMI doesn't apply to you? Ok. Then use WHR or even of the other methods. They are so hung up on BMI."
fatlogic,fejjz6l,t3_epefe7,1579177389.0,"Even having some weird quirks around food doesn't mean you have disordered eating disorder. 

And any diet is a disorder?! Let's say a doctor recommended the Mediterranean Diet (one of the most frequently recommended diets from Drs). They aren't going to then say you have an eating disorder from what they prescribed to you.

She is just not on the same page as conventional medicine. She fights them at every turn, thinks she knows more. I don't even see the point in continuing to go to the doctor if you don't buy into their experience and training."
fatlogic,fegmofh,t1_fegjl0y,1579097390.0,"I just got a bag of stir-fry vegetables, 2 servings, at Walmart for $0.88. I add cashews, I buy the ones that are labeled 'pieces' so they are cheaper. The tin was $2 for 6 oz. Then a stir fry sauce that was $2.50. A box of instant rice with four servings was $1. 

Nice vegetarian meal for cheap. Plenty of cashews, rice and sauce left over too."
fatlogic,fegm4su,t3_ep1q98,1579096959.0,"First off someone needs to introduce you to Aldi's. 

You might have to lose the fresh raspberries. Those probably were like five or six dollars in the off-season. But you can get bananas and apples cheaper. And I've seen bags of frozen raspberries and blueberries at the Dollar Tree. And you didn't need a bottle of water. I don't ever buy fresh pineapples so I don't know what those run. What you can get canned pineapple for cheap. I know it doesn't taste as good, but canned food retains its nutrients even better than fresh food. You just might have to drain off some syrup."
fatlogic,feglt9i,t1_fegk5nq,1579096705.0,I used to follow this Christian blog of a woman who had been a nurse before she left to stay at home. She flat-out said on her blog that anorexics were the most selfish patients and went on a rant about them from a religious point- of-view. I didn't have a rebuttal for that. I don't even think I've ever met anyone in real life with anorexia. But my opinion turned negative on her after that. She basically didn't view it as a clinical problem but a spiritual one.  How about saying something like they are frustrating because you don't know how to help rather than just declare them selfish?!
fatlogic,fee33k2,t3_eoefor,1579025391.0,"I don't ever want to stigmatize people who have it.

But I can't afford that medication. I watched my parents have problem after problem that traced back their diabetes. They have more money and better insurance than I do. I've got to at least try to prevent it."
fatlogic,fed8zgj,t3_eoefor,1579004141.0,"First off there's a steady stream of people hauled into hospitals with DK. Obviously they aren't managing your well. 

Secondly the way you managed it is with dietary changes. The very thing fat activists say causes all types of psychological problems."
fatlogic,fed8hf3,t3_eogoxc,1579003629.0,I will always believe that if it is wrong to have underweight models then it is wrong to have overweight models. Half a dozen countries ban  models with BMIs under 17.5. Yet there is no upper limit?!
fatlogic,fe82j8h,t3_eo3sh0,1578921739.0,That second one is the worst. You don't ask for another patient's treatment plan.
fatlogic,fdr9rsc,t1_fdr2m22,1578681505.0,Right. Neoliberal means liberal but capitalist. How does that apply in this context?
fatlogic,fdor46p,t3_emhj5s,1578611017.0,How does the small body prevent you from doing yoga like the big body?
fatlogic,fdogwhi,t3_emfjt1,1578604904.0,"Towards the end of that long, long article they got around to some good ideas. 

But most of it was trying to convince us thin people have worse health outcomes. Or that most fat people were eating next to nothing. Nobody is buying that you routinely eat a single yogurt or bowl of carrots for a meal. You maybe kept that up for a week or two. Comeon now. 

The stuff about kids getting needing more recess is important. And not just saying don't eat cheeseburgers when you don't know what those burgers *mean* to them is important. Most of it was the typical misrepresenting cherry picked studies."
fatlogic,fdk86ol,t3_eltodu,1578498283.0,I too can make false equivalents.
fatlogic,fdk0rz0,t1_fdjvnxc,1578493199.0,"It's frustrating because they stay in the dark about weight loss for so long. When it's actually really simple. (simple, but not easy) 

They always think it's some sort of magic ratio of carbs and protein or the time that you eat or whatever else is out there."
fatlogic,fdee0yy,t3_ekyc09,1578336975.0,"For reference, Cinder Block was 25 lbs when she was surrendered to the vet. About twice the weight she should have been."
fatlogic,fddov56,t1_fddl6vl,1578319905.0,Usually. There are some countries that have 23 as the standard for BMI. But even if you have a correct BMI you could still have a not great ratio of muscle:fat. Or the so called 'skinnyfat.'
fatlogic,fddoh5u,t1_fddnq9j,1578319564.0,"Yes, they made up the terms ""death fats"" themselves. It was an attempt at humor. The person that coined it was class III obese and felt like the world was telling her she was going to 'drop dead at any moment' from her fatness."
fatlogic,fd5tuif,t3_ejxin1,1578181444.0,There's a a dick pic in there. They are sending dick pics.
fatlogic,fd5r8sd,t1_fd33orz,1578180590.0,"Over taxes, not overtake. As the excessive hormones become a burden."
fatlogic,fd4osxg,t1_fd4mjnb,1578169511.0,I don't think it ever reverses. Just reverses symptoms.
fatlogic,fd2fhe7,t3_ejwt2k,1578146460.0,"My non-scientific understanding of it: Abdominal fat is metabolically active. It releases hormones and fatty acids into the rest of the body. This over taxes other organs- pancreas, liver, kidneys, Etc...  Greatly increasing the risk of metabolic disorders like type 2 diabetes. The fatty acids released contribute to things high cholesterol and an increased risk for heart conditions. 

If fat isn't linked to diabetes, I'd like them to explain how losing weight reverses symptoms?"
fatlogic,fcxdh4x,t3_ejfaid,1578059986.0,"I take issue with girls not being as physically active a generation or two ago. 

Many little things were harder. The appliances that save time weren't as common. Before bathrooms had showers, bathing/hair washing was more labor intensive for example. Same goes for a lot of household work. Maybe you had a washing machine but hung everything out to dry for example. There was more walking, maybe only one vehicle per household. 

Women's sports weren't as competitive I'm sure. But the average person today isn't an athlete either. 

And I take issue with the idea they didn't eat any vegatables expect boiled greens. You can look at cookbooks and meal plans from pervious eras and no that's not true.

There are these people online that always claim people in the past didn't know how to cook or season food correctly. That's dishonest. They take a few cringey recipes from ads as evidence.  They don't look at what routine life was like."
fatlogic,fcxai1b,t1_fcx9v5a,1578057387.0,Ah ok. I felt silly going to a clinic for eczema. But I had a patch that had been there for months. I'd spent a bunch on over-the-counter eczema lotions. The steroid was $2 with insurance and worked immediately.
fatlogic,fcx50ob,t1_fcwtdom,1578051492.0,"I'm a 36-year old female with a prescription for Adderall. 

I have to get blood pressure/weight/CMP every six months. If my weight goes down too much I can't get a refill. People were abusing the drug for weight loss. I think that comes from the government regulations. The BP and CMP are because a side effect of the medicine can be high blood pressure and kidney/liver problems. 

I went to a clinic for eczema and was weighed. It's just a matter of routine and the way it's ran. You come in and you first see the Medical Assistant. They don't know what the doctor is going to want so they just do routine vitals and weight. The medical assistant takes your history/complaint and then the doctor/pa/np comes in."
fatlogic,fcqug9w,t3_eiii15,1577892369.0,How can this be? How can there be so many ex fats? I thought weight loss wasn't even possible.
fatlogic,fco66zy,t1_fcnc5an,1577824836.0,good point
fatlogic,fco58b6,t1_fco4kho,1577824315.0,I pulled this from a review. I noticed that a bunch of the reviewers had the disclaimer that they were given a copy of the book in exchange for a review. I wonder how well the sales are actually doing.
fatlogic,fcnhke0,t1_fcnbd9v,1577811858.0,I wish she'd just let her dietitian license lapse. She has turned her back on her education anyway. In her podcast she's always mentioning how she had to 'unlearn' things she was taught in the dietitian program.
fatlogic,fcng8tg,t3_ei5c6c,1577811078.0,Oh no it's really simple. It's just not easy.
fatlogic,fcn50nx,t1_fcn3vxr,1577803436.0,"Translation:

However after you recover from diet culture, you might find yourself really craving something you're allergic to. Like shellfish. You have full permission to eat anything, including something you need an EpiPen for.""

She doesn't believe in diet rules- at all. She has said in the past she does not advise her diabetic patients to change their diets either. She refers them to a HAES provider who takes the idea of dietary changes completely off the table when it comes to the treatment plan."

If you can't stand, and you don't fit in any waiting room seat, I would suggest those rollators. A walker/seat combo that is sold at Walgreens. They will need a more costly bariatric one, but since they can afford to maintain such a large size I can't imagine that being a problem."

It's just the starvation mode stuff has permeated our thinking to the point that people think they *need* to eat five times a day to ""keep their metabolism running.""
