I feel like I don't deserve to be replied to simply because I want to talk to my friend too much.

I feel like you should not be in a friendship if you are not ready to leave this relationship in any moment.

Because if you are too dependant of your friend, friendship becomes too toxic to even call it friendship."
depression,fddjwuk,t1_fddhidj,1578315184.0,Alright that makes sense now.
depression,fddh33a,t3_ekqb96,1578311985.0,"I agree self love is one of the most important things.

But how to start self-loving? I mean love is not something you consciously decide to feel towards someone."

Maybe he even was not able to help you and yours relationship with depression could devastate him. 

Think about it as lesser evil. 

And don't worry - there's always someone who would consider you a valuable and beautiful person. :) 

There's simply too many people to let you be alone. Unless you isolate yourself, but hey - that's an extreme case."
AskReddit,fd93szy,t3_ejwjbm,1578227980.0,"If I can stop and restart the time, I would use this ability to fool people that I have ""teleportation"" powers. They wouldn't notice, because time would be stopped while I walk from place A to B. I could get basically infinite amount of money and knowledge because I could ""teleport"" some money to my pockets or freeze time until I finish studying some interesting field of science."
AskReddit,fd91ak6,t3_ek6vqd,1578226723.0,"I'm telling him if he won't talk back while we are not alone, than every single day he's gonna hear about all my crap, and on top of that I would finish this daily talk with very detailed description of some Chinese cuisine dishes, which include dog meat. And every day he's gonna eat the meat I would prepare for him. He'll never know what kind of meat he's eating unless he'll ask."

You might as well make them fans of sad horse cartoon."
