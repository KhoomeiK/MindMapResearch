Then when  he goes off script he veers wildly from one thing to the next and just rambles . When hes reading or hearing on script, he takes very long pauses between sentences."

I have a lot of very good friends and we can go months without seeing each other and then we pick up right where we left off, and it's fine! I have work friends I am close with but hardly see them outside of work, I have old school friends and new friendships I've made and I wonder how I ever got along without them! Make your circle wider, allow people in. Life does take over, and it's ok to miss your friends but it shouldn't limit how you live your life and make you feel bad about meeting new people, it's how we all grow! You sound like you're a great friend to them, let others be yours too if you can let them :)"
offmychest,fdv1bqw,t1_fdq2f71,1578741959.0,Thank you x
offmychest,fdv1alq,t1_fdq2pk7,1578741942.0,Thank you so much. I'm so sorry you lost your dad. Your words gave me comfort and I understand what you went through. Lots of hugs to you and thank you for sharing your experience with your amazing dad x
offmychest,fdv0m64,t1_fdq283j,1578741788.0,"Thank you for your kind words, I managed to get through his eulogy and tribute without falling apart, everyone told they really liked it and he would have loved it too. It took a lot of strength and I don't think I will get out of bed today. I will never forget him and I hope nobody else will forget him too. Thank you. X"

relationship_advice,fd8tkic,t3_ek6o8p,1578223277.0,"This is really, really heartbreaking. My best friend has been there 100% for me after losing my dad last month, she has been amazing so maybe I can tell you what she did for me and we can see how you can support your friend? My best friend (we will call her Ella) was just THERE. Everytime I had news about my dads condition, anytime I was upset, any time something went wrong she was the first person I wanted to call. Ella listened, cried, hugged me and looked after me. She called me constantly to listen even when i couldn't even speak through crying. When I was brave enough to go out of the house because i needed to do my Christmas shopping for my kids, she was right by my side keeping me going. She was encouraging and sensitive and knew the right thing to say. There will be people at the funeral who dont consider me my Dad's real daughter (he was my dad for 33 years) and she will be by my side to defend any nasty words that get said, she will shut people down who arent helping my family because that's who she is, fiercely protective and loyal. She did all of this just this month, but has been there for me all the way through since my Dads diagnosis in April, and I will make sure I can repay her kindness when she needs it, I will be HER Ella. 

I'm so sorry for your friends loss, and your loss too. It really is tragic to lose a child and she will need lots of support. The first thing to do is encourage her to go to a bereavement counsellor, be the one to find it and be the one to take her there. Be there on the phone when she needs it, be there in person to hold her and listen. Be the one to make sure she eats, even just a little. Be the one to take her to the doctors if she needs help and be the one who can run errands or act as a go-between with her family/friends if she isnt strong enough to talk to people. Keep her daughters memory alive, keep all the photos and her daughters things close for now, she will need it. 

I wish I could offer some more practical advice, and as another mother I wish I could take your pain away, and hers. Please don't forget to give yourself time to grieve too, its important to support your friend but you must also prioritize yourself and process your loss too. I'd like to offer you a listening ear if you should need it? Mother to mother, friend to friend. All you have to do is message me and I will be there for you, I will respond right away and sometimes it helps to have someone who isnt close to talk to - someone who can support you without being too involved and having the feelings getting in the way. My offer is there. Otherwise, I wish you all the best, you sound like an amazing friend and she will really need one now. You can be her Ella, and I can be yours. Hugs. X"
Advice,fd1mc4j,t1_fd1lpi6,1578133303.0,"I'm so glad it went well for you, well done- it couldn't have been easy. Thank you for your kind words, ours will be next Friday. I was wondering if you would reply with an update and it made me happy when my phone pinged with your response! I'm sure you made your family very proud, my condolences to you again. Try to take comfort that your loved one is at rest and that people will have taken comfort in the words you wrote and read to them. And thank you so much for replying, I kept you in my thoughts yesterday."
happy,fd1ljta,t3_ejrv7c,1578132947.0,"This is awesome. I'm so glad you had someone to support you in your hour of need and its heartwarming that you are paying forward the help you had to others. You're awesome and I hope you and the other ladies have very bright futures ahead!
Kindness is everything."
Advice,fcxb24b,t3_ejdzu2,1578057905.0,"Will you let me know how it goes? I am doing the same for my dad next week - a full eulogy. All I can say is, if you do get upset, please don't give yourself a hard time. Everyone will be there for the same reason, to be sad to say goodbye. Just give yourself time and space to breathe. Let someone take over if you cant - I have mine fully written down so I can hand it to the minister if I get too upset. Even if you cant read it, they will be your words.  Good luck and I hope it goes well for you, and my condolences to you and your family, I'm sure you will make them proud."
trashy,fck29p6,t3_ehlctk,1577714407.0,My friends sister made an account for her cat and comments on various things in cat like baby talk. She sent me a message of condolence recently but she forgot to switch accounts so I read a message from her cats 'purr-spective' telling me how sorry she was that I lost my dad. It was weird.
happy,fcjrotg,t3_ehj5r0,1577701263.0,"You are really beautiful, your smile is amazing. It's not a hurry up and take the photo smile, it's a genuine smile that lights up your whole face and shows genuine happiness! Body dysmorphia is cruel, because you don't get to see what other people see, and now it sounds like you're starting to see your image the way we do. Keep that beautiful smile beaming! You've got this girly üëç‚ù§"
WholesomeVideos,fc8876g,t3_egju9k,1577529053.0,"Not cute at all. Look at how agressive she is in her words, her manner and her body language. That kid is frightened. I would never make my children feel this way just to get a few likes on a video, shes betraying his trust in his mother and the boy is genuinely scared of what she is going to do. I hate this video, it reminds me of the mother who filmed her kid opening a gift which was an xbox box and watched him get so excited only to tell him it was just a box. The kid was absolutely crushed."
coolguides,fbtumxf,t1_fbtuic3,1577096778.0,"You might, and that's ok.  There's no pain like it and sometimes it takes a while to sink in. My offer is there and I will happily talk to you for as long as you need, it will help me to help someone else. That's how my dad raised me and I'm proud of being like him. Don't worry about leaning on people for support, sometimes it's too much to deal with alone."
