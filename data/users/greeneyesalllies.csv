sex,feda6y9,t1_fed9oa8,1579005396.0,I was thinking about hormones and since it stops women becoming fertile which might attract men more.
newcastle,fed6iva,t1_fe6m1rt,1579001264.0,The chips and cinnamon twists are pretty good tho... its value food but you pay for what you get in regard to quality with Zambrero. It's a cheap feed at TB
newcastle,fed6fcp,t1_fe0yl7b,1579001134.0,I have found it to be pretty good and the chips are heaps good. The crunchwraps and powerbowls are pretty tasty and good value too. It's nice when you want something a bit more substantial and less 'healthy' than Zambrero although the nachos at zambrero are better with the real cheese. I'd reccomend checking it out
AskMen,fdw2wgi,t1_fdw2oev,1578754506.0,How does that make you feel?
newcastle,fdvk6de,t1_fduf84v,1578748285.0,Maybe it was...the staff aren't very good at communicating there. Actually the staff at Taco Bell were much more helpful and at least pretended like they cared.

newcastle,fd7ried,t1_fd7qryk,1578208962.0,"Yeah it seems really funny as I never imagined a lot of people from there here, they must promote UoN or something.

It was heaps funny because whenever I met someone from the states when I lived on they were nearly 90% of the time from Iowa so I started to just ask if they were from Iowa. We had a people from Rhode Island and Colorado also but they were limited."
newcastle,fd7r32f,t1_fd7qg5j,1578208770.0,"Oh really? I live near Kindra place, it's quite a nice street but I haven't noticed any whack shit (I've only lived here 6 months and lived in Cooks Hill before and felt that was more unsafe and before that on campus). Apparently this is the 3rd robbery in 2 years.

What sort of whack things happened?


I don't know what you mean by fun but its pretty quiet (usually) and not busy except for the road. I think there are mostly international students now. But OMG, on campus is ridiculous, just paid under 2k to get in one of the cheapest rooms"
newcastle,fd7qh98,t3_efbxu8,1578208501.0,Newcastle is a lot better as the Sydney Universities are HUGE and impersonal now and don't really have any on campus accomodation (its all privately owned) and also the majority of students are from India and China and don't speak a lot of English (even though they are doing degrees?). The people are a lot friendlier here and the campus is lovely and easier to meet people. I've been to both and can confidently say UoN is nicer for international students
newcastle,fd7q1v8,t1_fc15d5y,1578208311.0,"No we have great multicultural food here and so many Indians and Indian restaurants and other Asian restaurants since we are close to Asia (like a lot of Australia). There isn't a lot of fried stuff as we have a lot of focus on cafe (we are obsessed with coffee and having a perfect one!) and fresh, healthy locally sourced food."
newcastle,fd7prx7,t1_fbzo722,1578208187.0,"Newcastle has 550,000 people now"
newcastle,fd7pp70,t3_efbxu8,1578208153.0,There's so many people from Iowa State and North Iowa on campus at UoN so you'll be able to have support.
newcastle,fd7p44m,t1_fd7opfj,1578207903.0,True.  I work in Jeso Central and finish at night sometimes and that's an experience. This area always felt pretty safe though and I was in a false sense of security as it felt like a more civilised part (compared to others) I guess that makes it a target. I'll be moving out asap and back on campus with 24/7 seccos and cctv.
