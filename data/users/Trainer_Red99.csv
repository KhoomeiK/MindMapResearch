fantasywriters,ffc0wij,t1_ffawpib,1579788703.0,"Yes, I was trying to hide the fact I was inspired by martial art films and Super Heros anime to write a novel (instead of being inspired from an actual novel). What about film directors? Don't you think they can just jump in the studio and learn from doing? (Since watching a film doesn't show you how a film was directed). 
There's also the case of video game players, what if they spend more time playing games rather than designing games? (Maybe an aspiring author spends more time reading than writing).
Although I do argue that you'll learn more by reading popular fiction rather than reading about how to write fiction."
fantasywriters,ffbvy92,t1_ffbsk75,1579784570.0,"I agree, some people think an author can do everything by him/herself, but you still need an editor, beta readers, and a cover artist.  
I've written a story and made the RPG Maker version of it.   
The animations and level design I did went well.  
It sucked when I realized how difficult it was (for me) to balance the battle system.  
Had I asked a math inclined redditor or Tabletop RPG gamer for help, I'm sure the old project would still be alive."
fantasywriters,ff9f9us,t1_ff95xmm,1579711765.0,"This makes me so happy! By just telling you my blurb you guessed it was inspired by anime. I started writing fantasy when I couldn't find any other anime series like Ranma 1/2, Full Metal Panic Fumoffu, and Gintama: absurd comedy and action with monsters hack and slashing. I read a post of Reddit calling out authors who don't read novels but watch movies, anime, tv shows, to base their novels in. The post said we should read more to become better writers, not watch anime or TV lol"
fantasywriters,ff9es0a,t1_ff92hvg,1579711455.0,"This makes me so happy! By just telling you my blurb you guessed it was inspired by anime. Two beta readers have told me my novel could be an anime since it's hitting the tropes. I started writing fantasy when I couldn't find any other anime series like Ranma 1/2, Full Metal Panic Fumoffu, and Gintama: absurd comedy and action with monsters hack and slash. By the way, there's no ""anime"" genre in fantasy books since I can't draw xD"
fantasywriters,ff8t3rb,t1_ff8sgid,1579695068.0,"Nice. High fantasy would be more difficult for me to write since it requires more world-building; whereas, low-Fantasy can grab a nearby city / country and then you can adjust their physics/lore"
fantasywriters,ff8rqcu,t3_esaq1c,1579693459.0,"These makes me question as well, is using our world as a base for a novel enough to make a novel urban fantasy? What if all the physics are altered, there's other creatures living alongside humans, and monsters in our real world? Is that Urban Fantasy?  
I just thought it was easier to mention a city and describe it than creating an original location and describing it, that's why I leaned towards using our world / real locations."
selfpublishing,ff5qpnc,t1_ff4mjvp,1579606413.0,"Yes, I've used copyrighted and CC. Since nothing is for sell yet, I guess they're being used as memes, fair use. From the sound of it, I shouldn't even worry since I'm not even famous and the cases I know who used copyrighted material, so far received a letter to stop using them. A cartoon animator was really lucky when he used copyrighted characters, the owner of the IP told him to make it sufficiently different and could keep using them. They looks almost identical, everyone recognizes them."
rpg,ff2xtmj,t1_ff2xbcf,1579528056.0,"Man, I didn't know Humble Bundle sold TRPGs. I haven't checked them in a long time since I haven't been on steam in ages."

rpg,ff2wwju,t1_ff2weqz,1579527183.0,Thank you. I bought Mini Six on print as you let me know about it. I'll staple Maze Rats and Knave. I've already laminated Risus and L&F before. I own Fiasco. I buy TRPGs as if buying fiction novels :-)

But do you know one that reaches cooper or better?"
NoStupidQuestions,felnb5u,t3_cr4cnm,1579226273.0,"I did it for almost 2 months, well I would work part-time near my house, then go back to sleep.Peripheral nephropathy, light heartbeat, prediabetis, frequent urination, weak muscles, and an upset stomach, were the symptoms I felt. You also increase your chances of becoming full diabetic and having a stroke by sleeping more than 9 hours a day."

depression,feiwcfc,t1_feigh9o,1579148998.0,I've also lost interest in many things that once brought joy. I have a fiance and siblings. Knowing they're doing well in life keeps me motivated. I sleep many hours but still live day by day and can sustain my job. Nothing is exciting anymore.
depression,fegi135,t1_fegfy7z,1579093401.0,"Thank you so much. It means a lot to me. It's not as bad as other threads I've read.  
I derive happiness from seeing my family doing well, but I don't feel like trying new things for myself.  
I'm still productive while teaching and can continue living."
depression,fege4yv,t1_fegcvur,1579089556.0,"I would say self-doubt. I am afraid it might be genetic since there's been other moments where I was very anxious in life

Something terrible happened to me last year. I spend months sleeping many hours. After 5 months, I stopped feeling hopeless in exchange of living day by day. It feels way better this way, but it seems I lost the spark I once had."

Ironsworn,fdzsmjv,t3_enc51e,1578794835.0,"You can still find it in APK websites. I downloaded it before it was removed. It works, just scroll to the right when it starts. It was missing some asset cards. The journal would glitch if you wrote tons of entries."
rpg,fdsoytl,t1_fdqrl7j,1578706067.0,"Sure, as long as it keeps the formula. I wanted to try it since it gets a lot of recommendations, but didn't know which version players are usually talking about."

savageworlds,fdk0k46,t1_fdjxw0w,1578493039.0,"I'm looking forward to it. I'll buy 3 games: Feng Shui 2, Wushu, and SW,  but I'm afraid that if SW really is fast and retains the fun, I'll just use SW for all my needs :-)
You can see what I'm trying to do and why speed is important based on my other 2 game choices :-)"
savageworlds,fdk04j6,t1_fdjxta5,1578492708.0,"I like silly martial art and action movies that's why I thought about a TRPG where many fast encounters are possible and fun. I found SW, Feng Shui 2, and Wushu. I'll buy all 3 and possibly keep running the ""fastest""  and more fun one"
savageworlds,fdjzuau,t1_fdjwee3,1578492489.0,"I want to use Savage worlds to emulate everything you see in Jason Statham, Bruce Lee, and ridiculous Super Hero movies. I'll also buy Feng Shui 2 and Wushu. Any recommendations to create stupid action scenes?"
savageworlds,fdjzome,t1_fdjuejn,1578492363.0,"I see. I will buy it today and read it. I'm attracted to high speed, ridriculous, and impossible, martial arts or super hero action. I thought making them as fast as possible with Savage would be ideal to keep the addrenaline flowing. I will also buy Feng Shui 2 and tip the creator of Wushu. Logic and physics don't matter in the type of action I like :-)"
savageworlds,fdjz9ts,t1_fdjvhvh,1578492042.0,"Haha. I did mention I might have been an ignorant. Right now I have the $$ to buy a new TRPG, but don't know which one, and I'm so close to buy SW because of how fast it is and to plug it on anything: Lord of the rings, Star Wars, zombies, and Hong Kong action movies. I fear I won't want to try anything else after SW"

horrorwriters,fbz7m65,t1_fbyqkw9,1577237598.0,"I was able to find a fantasy stories narrator. He started 6 months ago and has 821 subscribers. It was very difficult to find anyone narrating fantasy/sci-fi with their own voice. I don't want to make money anymore, but it would be demotivating to upload narrations that fewer than 50 listen to.  The fantasy narrator has 117,000 views. I'm still unsure if I should read creepypastas because of the mass audience or fantasy because nobody is really doing it."
