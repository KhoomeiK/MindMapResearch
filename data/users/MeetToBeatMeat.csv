MadeMeSmile,ffe1oy8,t1_ffdlbfd,1579834396.0,"Though I'm not a parent (too young to be one), I believe that the behavior depends on many things other than the way they are raised. For example, kind of people they've interacted/saw interacting, their friends, cartoons, etc. Even if two children are twins, they may have different behavior which may not depend on any of the above things.

My point being, just because children may not show expected behaviors doesn't mean they shouldn't be parented well. You know that you're a good parent. At some point in their lives they *will* understand what's good or what isn't and that is the best result a parent or society can expect."

He waited till he was finished then burst out laughing and showed him the video before sending it to everyone in our friend circle. His roommate was a great guy though. Laughed it off saying to let him know the next time he records him."
