Even had a cousin say the same thing to us.  So, we were bummed and thought we weren't going to qualify in 2019.  But turbo tax gave it to us.   I've since went to double check my child's personal information just to be on the safe side. As you said perhaps we made an error during data entry.  But, its legit.

I went back and read it again and I think the sentence, "" Children that qualify for the  Child Tax Credit are under 17 on Dec 31"" is what is confusing. 

This Dec 31 is 2018.  Not Dec 31st, 2019.

Again poorly worded and confusing."
todayilearned,ffp8uaq,t1_ffp8c4z,1580089074.0,"Not trying to plug a company or ""hailcorprate"" but I use Turbotax with audit protection and it has has never failed me.  I have a very simple tax situation so if turbotax says ""great we checked and you qualify"" then I'm good to go."
todayilearned,ffp7z92,t1_ffp7ov3,1580088501.0,"The IRS site is worded in a confusing manner.  I too thought ""under 17"" meant 16. But he was 16 for part of 2019, turned 17 in 2019 and we qualified.  I'm no special case.  It is what it is and you are interpreting it wrong just as I did when I first read it."
todayilearned,ffp70z8,t1_ffp6uls,1580087835.0,"This is wrong.  My child turned 17 in Oct of 2019 and we recieved it for the 2019 tax season.  He turns 18 in 2020 and at that time we will not be eligible. Ergo, your title is wrong and confusing."
todayilearned,ffp6oc8,t1_ffp6hhi,1580087586.0,Your post title says 16...
todayilearned,ffp62qj,t3_eug89p,1580087164.0,"It is until they turn 18, not 16.  My child is 17 and we recieved it this year."

interestingasfuck,ffk29u2,t1_ffjpei6,1580013592.0,"By definition,  [skilled worker positions are not seasonal or temporary and require at least two years of experience or training.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skilled_worker). This is why it's easier to replace than give a raise.  That's all I'm saying.

And a $5 raise is quite substantial so that may have been the reason you recieved that type of response.  In two weeks they can have two of you at base pay."
interestingasfuck,ffj4zz9,t1_ffiyktz,1579990547.0,"I really didnt mean to offend with my comment.  I am genuinely curious, how long would you say it takes to train the average person to become skilled at trimming?  Couple weeks, a month, 6 months, or longer?"
interestingasfuck,ffi1l9u,t1_ffhki8p,1579962350.0,"I think it's justified by the output of 2 versus 1.  That and once they bend for this guy they might think he's coming back for more later. Then others find out and it becomes a ""mutiny"" because Jim makes more than Bob and Bob wants in on the pay raise action.  In the long run it's cheaper to have the turn over and keep the base pay where they want it. It's farm work, not highly skilled labor.

They aren't slow at all.  They did the math already."
interestingasfuck,ffhzi9j,t1_ffh7yq9,1579960346.0,"I've heard it's because there are SO many young people that think ""wow, it'd be so cool to work around weed all day"". So you're easily replaced with the next batch of kids that think ""wow, it'd be so cool to work around weed all day"".  And the cycle continues.  Supply and demand my dude.  Unfortunately for you, supply far out weighs demand in the case of weed farm workers."
