There are hundreds of ways to eliminate cells, that's not the problem.

> It doesnâ€™t matter how it happens

That is incorrect, because this determines in which exact way the cells are different from healthy ones. Differentiation is key. You need to AND recognize all of the ""sick"" cells AND NOT target any healthy cells.

Which is also one of the reasons it's still going to take years to turn into a treatment. They tested on human cancer in a mouse. If it's human cancer in a human, there are also lots of other human cells around."

Apparently what they found in this paper is a mechanism to reprogram your immune system to attack cells that have some specific properties on their surface, so this mechanism can work for all types of cancer that can be outwardly distinguished from healthy cells.

It can also accidentally program your immune system to attack healthy cells, which is basically involuntary suicide. So there are years and years of testing in this research team's future.
