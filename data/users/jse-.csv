todayilearned,fexkczq,t1_fewb4zn,1579432397.0,You want proof that I’m Japanese?
todayilearned,fevua3m,t1_fetgppt,1579401587.0,"Are you kidding? I AM Japanese, I’ve literally been on JR trains thousands of times. The “accepted translation” of Shinkansen is bullet train. The literal translation of the characters that make it up is the “new main line” because that was the vision of the kokutetsu (not JR) when they created the Shinkansen."
todayilearned,fesaoyd,t1_femuur4,1579363313.0,"新　is new, but 幹線　translates more accurately to “main line” or “main road.” Translating the middle character on its own doesn’t make sense. That’s not how Japanese works, and it’s what you get when your stick it in google translate because you don’t know any Japanese whatsoever."

todayilearned,femi8wp,t1_fem886p,1579256933.0,"Reddit’s view of japan tends to be really polarized  so people either worship the country or treats it like a social justice nightmare. In reality neither of these views of Japan are accurate. People like you seem t be fine with basing your entire knowledge of a country based off of Reddit posts. Just because you read a reddit comment that said the Japanese criminal justice system is flawed it doesn’t mean you can apply that same biased knowledge to the Japanese rail system. 

The bullet train system has by far the strictest maintenance and inspection system in the world. On top of that Japan’s rail company’s are world leaders in high speed rail and technology. That is the reason why they have a perfect record, not because of smudging crime statistics. You seem to imply that a cultural tendency to “be submissive towards authority” results in the people allowing crime to be misreported, and even accuse the Japanes rail system of misreporting deaths...do you really believe that the Japanese people are so brain dead that if someone is suspiciously killed by a bullet train (which is instant national news) that they won’t demand to get to the bottom of it?

Just because it’s re only thing you know about Japan , it doesn’t mean you need to try and explain everything about Japan using your bullshit opinion on cultural differences."
