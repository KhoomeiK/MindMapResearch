GirlGamers,fgtc5ed,t3_f09mlu,1581102426.0,"He ladies! My name is Hannah, 24F, I primarily play online on Xbox! I do also have a switch and PS4 but I don't play online on those! 

My most common online games at the moment are COD Modern Warfare, Minecraft and Battlefront on occasion!  

I like to privately play Tomb Raider, Pokemon S&S, Breath of the Wild, Celeste, 

Gamertag is Elegantbaws (don't judge I made it when I was like 11 and I am too lazy to change it lol) 

To note about COD: I really enjoy it but this is my first COD game (mostly did Halo back in the day) and I'm more so online for a good time rather than crazy competitive!"
GirlGamers,fgtbscn,t1_fgt5kkn,1581102203.0,Hi Valkyrree I play Minecraft and COD MW the most at the moment!
pregnant,fgt65ho,t3_f0e1l1,1581099857.0,Took me until about 24 weeks for others to notice! You'll get there!
modernwarfare,fgszogy,t3_f041ft,1581096003.0,"TIL that I am a ""sweaty player"".  I am a new player to any COD, 24F so honestly I get really stoked for every kill.  
I like the slav but number one is the black chick
My favorite loadout consists of a blue M4, a purple Shotgun, sticky grenades and stims. Just upgraded from Claymores. 
I am terrible at sliding, but I always get slid on and laugh in our group ""Those damn slidey boys always get me!"" 

I guess I'm a sweaty try hard, womp, but I suck and just really enjoy the game."
modernwarfare,fgszakz,t1_fgs8qo5,1581095771.0,I use him because I like track suits and want one

Ooohh I gotchu"
modernwarfare,fgsy97m,t1_fgrhsxs,1581095143.0,"Call me sweaty.  24F but man I love me some tracksuits.  Also if ""Sweaty"" is another term for a try hard this confuses the hell out of me.  I'm relatively new to the game and use the M4, the shotgun, sticky grenades and I like the slav and the black girl (she's my favorite).  Meanwhile when I play online even my husband will complain in our group about ""These little try hards with their M4s"".  Then I laugh because I guess that's me? And yeah I am trying hard but damn I die a lot lol"

pregnant,fgstrm4,t3_f09h34,1581092486.0,I drink a ton of hot chocolate... I know it's not good for baby but he enjoys it and it helps me get some calories in (26+6 with HG)

pregnant,fgsspp4,t3_f04mgp,1581091853.0,"I thought I would eat like crazy and gain mad weight during pregnancy. Genuinely was concerned about how much weight I'd gain. Nope! Got HG, still get sick once a day at least at 26+6, and I'm only 5 or 6 lbs over starting weight.  I started being able to eat recently but it's tiny meals."
unpopularopinion,fgssjne,t3_f0aq6t,1581091750.0,"I wish I could say I was perfect but I hate roaches.  I don't kill them, genuinely feel bad killing any animal that isn't endangering me or mine (once killed a black widow near my dog)."
TooAfraidToAsk,fgsr3cd,t1_fgsjz2d,1581090857.0,"Don't expect them to look ok Reddit, but good thinking none the less!  Make a physical journal they can submit to evidence with ""I THINK MY NEIGHBORS ARE DANGEROUS"" inside of it."

unpopularopinion,fgsk73m,t1_fgscd7t,1581086400.0,Loved the atomic blonde fights.
unpopularopinion,fgsk44k,t3_f095ua,1581086343.0,"I actually really enjoyed Atomic Blonde.  Her fights we're usually 1v1 (granted my memory is horrible so if I'm wrong sorry) and she would look brutal afterward.  It was never like she jumped on a dude's shoulders spun and flipped without any bruises, most of the fights she came out looking wrecked and as a female I LOVED it.  Looked so real and awesome."
TooAfraidToAsk,fgsjpft,t3_f09dsu,1581086055.0,"So I know it's way easier said than done but moving and then notifying the police is your best course of action.  

Also, start writing in a journal what you've seen and heard.  That way if anything does happen and the police come to investigate they'll find that journal.  Best of luck, definitely sounds dangerous!"
todayilearned,fgsim5j,t1_fgqikff,1581085280.0,Honestly that's like $100 a month.  One big vet bill (vaccines for example) and a toy and a bag of dog food (I have large dogs) a month pretty much does that.

DeadBedrooms,fgqejpy,t1_fgpjx60,1581022656.0,"Accept for the fact that it absolutely is supported by science that porn, after much viewing, rewires your brain to be able to only get that sexual stimulus from images like porn.  Hence why so many younger men are needing Viagra than ever before, because they started watching porn which was seemingly harmless and it changed how their brain reacted to sexual stimulus.

You can definitely be addicted to pornographic images and the oxytocin release that comes with it, just like drugs.  No you won't have that issue if you view it every now and then, but multiple times a week and choosing that over actual sex, yeah, you've got a real problem."
pregnant,fgqcged,t3_ezrxy0,1581021691.0,"A man told me the other day my plan would never work and I should just stop trying to have a plan altogether.  He also said that the babys first few months we're way harder than pregnancy and labor. 

First of all dude I'm pretty sure you don't know shit about pregnancy or labor. 

Second of all, please excuse me while I roll my eyes.  I'm going to do what I'm going to do, and my plan was literally ""I'm going to try and do natural but I'm open to epidural if the pain is too bad"".  That was the grand plan he scoffed at.  Seriously, so annoyed."
WinStupidPrizes,fgq8rqo,t1_fgq5psu,1581019978.0,Considering how many women have been assaulted and raped... When the flu kills 00.1% of people we all freak out but 33% of women being attacked against their will is no biggie.

AskReddit,fgq3oex,t1_fgpis6d,1581017271.0,Are you okay?
unpopularopinion,fgpybmo,t1_fgprdcv,1581014340.0,"Most rapes go unreported because of the shame so many put on the victim (what were you wearing, but were you drinking, did you actually say no, why were you out that late alone) etc.  92% of those reported aren't even followed through and the rapist is let off due to a lack of evidence (it's very difficult to prove a rape occured even if it 100% did) If it became a crime to report a rape then more rapists would feel free to rape others because women would be scared to report that they had been raped and would then be arrested if enough evidence wasn't found.  So I get raped, I report it, and then I'm arrested for it. Yeah, no, not a good idea.  

I get false accusations get filed, but the majority of accusations are real, just very difficult to prove.  Don't punish all the men and women who've undergone a horrendous situation because some garbage fire people decided to falsely accused somebody.  What's right for the majority should always overcome what's right for the few."
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fgpx3l2,t3_ezsn0l,1581013675.0,"Honestly I love the honesty.  When I was 18 it was like ""Okay but the clock is ticking and you should probably get married soon"" like what??"
