6 Underground, for example.

movies,fglxk9g,t1_fglwgt1,1580913385.0,"The twist is a little more than “it’s a prequel”. There are two timelines presented. One set in the past (the traps) and one set in modern day (the investigation). The twist itself is that the coroner is the guy who switched Kramer’s cancer results with somebody else, which made him not realize he had cancer until it was too late. The coroner is actually the guy in the first game who has a bucket over his head the entire duration of the trap and who doesn’t get out and is seemingly ripped to shreds by the saws he’s pulled into. Kramer realizes he was wrong to trap him (he let revenge cloud his judgement rather than his usual method of choosing who he puts in the traps) and rescues him before he can die. The coroner goes on to be the one who’s recreating the traps in the present day. All the people who die in the past are seemingly brought into present day, but it’s actually a new game being done by the coroner. The lead detective (who’s crooked as fuck) starts to piece things together, but is captured by the coroner.


The coroner pretends to be captured as well and is seemingly killed by a laser collar (Flower Head), but reveals he is alive and the one who’s been killing people the last few days after the detective confessed to his crooked ways. The coroner kills him with the laser collar, resulting in the Flower Head scene. It’s a brutal scene, and I definitely recommend watching Jigsaw. It’s (possibly, unless this new one is a full reboot) canon after all, so you’ll catch any references to it if you see the new one and it does reference all of the previous films."
movies,fgls8ug,t1_fglqtdg,1580909645.0,"That’s your prerogative. I thought it was interesting, if only as a high-tech counter to the Reverse Bear Trap.

movies,fgljwow,t1_fgliqmr,1580901420.0,"That’s fair. I was surprised too, but I took it in stride cause I had low expectations from the start.

Kinda wish they’d embraced the “modern day” tech when it comes to the traps like with the Flower Head at the very end, even if that one was a one-off trap to kill the last guy who could expose the last remaining Jigsaw killer. It makes sense why they couldn’t, what with the reveal at the end that the whole “game” was a prequel story.


I’d love a Saw movie with traps similar to the Flower Head. A bunch of cool, high-tech traps which use technology to bolster or otherwise improve the trap, but not necessarily make it harder, and definitely not impossible like Amanda went and did with her games."
