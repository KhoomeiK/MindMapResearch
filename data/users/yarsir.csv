Your argument doesn't address how meat is necessary. You appear to slide the goal posts as you talk about doctors bitching about meat. Anecdotal? Or do you have a source? Is there medical evidence stating chicken meat is necessary for a human diet? How about all meat? 

Are supplements worse for the environment than meat consumption? Do you have a source comparing the two?

Lab meat may be better, someday, but of the options today, the science does not appear to support meat eating as optimal. At best, inertia won't let the meat industry disappear, at status quo, people will ignore their entitlement, selfishness and poor decisions simply for taste."

JordanPeterson,fel3dfp,t1_feab9vk,1579213185.0,"Trigger test: I think you (or where you get your arguments) are gish-golloping. Why? Your first line says arguable, but solid. I'd argue that is an oxymoron. Something cannot be a fact or solid, if there is significant argument. Sure, we can argue against evolution, but hopefully that example shows that it all depends on perspective. When it comes to politics... perspective helps shape many arguments. It only becomes solid when you choose a team.

You claim the left was X and is now Y. If a generalized descriptive label can change stances, then maybe left and right are not good terms to be using. It would be like the ignorant who claim Lincoln was a republican and that somehow represents all republicans today.

Speaking of labels, it is easy to declare someone is X and then make someone out to be a hypercrite or 'the left eating itself' type arguments. That is an issue with identity politics. Makes it easy to direct an agenda and get pwople riled up. Especially with all the personalities that exist. 

Which ties into your 'left hates free speech because X personalities'. Sounds like the teams are fighting over who they want (or not want) on their team. I find it prudent to define people as they label themselves, rather than how others label them. Otherwise we'd have to beleive Shapiro and JP are Nazis by the same token that 'the left' are the real Nazis... having listened to both of those speakers, they are clearly 'right leaning' so it shouldn't be surprising when 'left leaning' people dislike them. Less so when the extreme ones call to silence them and weild their power to do so. Especially when the extreme right acts the same.

I am behind on Brexit. Is the undemocratic part pushing to have another referendum? Or doing the proper Republic action of steering the ship instead? Or do people use 'democracy' as a strongman word to again put down the other team they disagree with? Personally, I find the issues complex and not as simplistic as many politicians try to make it sound to their base.

The feminism/Muslim hypocrisy is invented by anti-left(or whatever) narratives. This point clearly puts your arguments in the narrative push and/or gish-gollop. If you want to argue this one, feel free, as I have a decent understanding of the 'left' side arguments and how the 'right' twists it to their favor. A TL;DR is, you can champion tolerance of faith (moderate muslims) while also championing for women rights. They do not negate each other, but some muslims can certainly make it difficult to champion both.

You say the left is 'bizarrely' critical of the west and anti capatilism. More gish-gollop. Points made with no good faith arguments.

If those points are true, would it be true to say the right is bizarrely uncritical of the west and pro-capatilism? Pro Imperialism? Pro exploitation? Hopefully, we can say no to all those rhetoricals. If we can, then we should be able to take a step back from calling 'the left' bizarre and focus on the extreme views. Or better yet, actually bring arguments instead of opinions.

Gish-golloping typically does not care about constructive critiques. Otherwise it could be more centered in weighing an arguments pros and cons."

I think one can talk about people and about ideas. If a flawed person pushes an idea, the idea may be flawed. Similar to a corrupt idea or plan, the corruption or flaw can undermine it.

Ghandi is used as an easy name drop to illustrate an idea. Usually non-violence to achieve peaceful goals. We can certainly talk to the idea without worrying about the person, but if the person is meant to be a representative of the idea... then their flaws come with it.

Regardless, 'culture making her like something' is an easy flaw to exploit in the argument, depending on your leanings.

I must have been lucky with my experiences.

The people running the classes I took fostered discussion, even if the ideas argued appeared to run counter to each other.

The issues I usually see are poor communication of ideas or some corruption in the transmission. Your story appears to be one of corruption of transmission, due to an overzealous and ignorant teacher.

So they may have attempted to handle me differently if they viewed me as a potential convert. *shrugs*
