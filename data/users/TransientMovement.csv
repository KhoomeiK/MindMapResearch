And secondly, imagine being so delusional as to think you know more about the climate than literally every climatologist. It's not even a topic of argument, the fact that climate change is real is just a fact. Coastal erosion, droughts, rising sea levels, unprecedentedly long fire seasons, drastically shrinking polar ice caps. The list goes on. Just because you don't see changes like Hollywood shows in movies like '2012' or 'the day after tomorrow' doesn't mean it isn't happening, you're just living in a safe little bubble where the impacts are directly in your face."

AskReddit,fffrbac,t1_ffepo4g,1579890100.0,"I'm a decently fit dude and I got called fatphobic by a girl I was seeing a few times because I said that I didn't want to get in the habit of eating too much pizza, because I'd gain a lot of weight and I didn't want that. She interpreted that as me tying my worth as a person to my weight (I don't), and she didn't like that idea, due to her own struggles with an eating disorder in the past. She assumed that if I thought that, then I would value her less if she didn't stay at some ""perfect"" weight, whatever that is. She didn't necessarily say it to be 'mean', and we ended up talking quite a lot about the issue, but she was definitely projecting her own body image insecurities onto me.
