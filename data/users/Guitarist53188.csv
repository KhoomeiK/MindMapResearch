ComicBookCollabs,ff7l2gs,t1_ff714cb,1579652096.0,"Def looks better with the change in symmetry concerning the lettering (centered). The art still leaves my eyes wanting concerning the same situation. Where do you want my eyes to go- should be the same thing you encountered work page flow. If it's towards the center consider narrowing towards as such. That's why I referenced the movie posters- the same principals apply as it did back then (the era you ate aiming towards). Pick any reference you want- blade runner, starwars, etc. There will b multiple posters but some will draw your eye better than others.

Second topography, it's a big deal- find something better more appealing. Dafont is a great avenue if you don't feel like putting too much time into it. 

Your title always bigger than everything else. Top teaser section is chill (but also not really needed, I've never been convinced by those) 

Lastly the distribution outlets don't need to be as large. It's good to have but if I'm gonna read your book I'll find out. Shriek em off to the corner and when you do market them hyperlink it in the comments or much like anythin shared it'll be a image ready to click. 

That's really all the advice I can think of. I Hope it doesn't come off harsh I just want you to be able to sell your shit and everyone bases their opinion on the cover."
