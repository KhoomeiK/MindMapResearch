Also, their soaps and Scrubee. I first went into Lush last spring because I wanted to start trying some natural moisturizing soaps to help how dry my legs get in the winter, and that's when I discovered Sultana of soap, and Scrubee. I can now never be without my Scrubee (it's utterly transformed my skin...), and their soaps also keep me really smooth and soft (I'm a huge lover of winterberry now)."
