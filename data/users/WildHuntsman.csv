virgin,fdixiuc,t3_elklir,1578453298.0,"Why do you say that everyone dislikes you? Has something happened? 

Some general advice would be to put yourself in situations where you’ll get to chat with people over common interests. Join study groups for your classes (that has the bonus of improving and or maintaining your own grades as well as earning the gratitude of anyone you help). What are your interests? Join some clubs/teams that catch your fancy. Not sure? Drop in to a few sessions to see if you like it. Keep an ear out for any events at your school (i.e. dances) and ask around to see if there’s anyone you can go with (friends or a date can both be fun times). 

When chatting with people, offer to exchange numbers. You can find a topical excuse like “hey let’s share numbers so we can send each other any missed work”, or just say “hey I like chatting with you, here’s my number, let’s chat some more”. Even offering to show people funny memes or sending them interesting videos is a good way of going about it.

I’ll probably have to mull about those quotes in my head for a bit before they really make sense to me like they do to you. At the moment death and The End seem kind of synonymous. 

At the moment I feel like I’m living a bad narrative. I feel like I’ve wasted my life and will be unable to overcome the challenges presented to me. I’m addition to this, I get the feeling that my narrative is fixed and I can’t change it. It feels like some tragedy playing out to it’s “inevitable”’ conclusion. 

Seeing as how I haven’t read either of those books I’m probably missing a lot. I don’t know what else you can share without going into spoiler territory, but thanks for sharing and giving me more suggestions for things to read.

virgin,fctfx01,t1_fctdfh8,1577941979.0,"The latest example of someone having ulterior motives saw a friend of mine seek me out day after day after day. It was nice to be wanted, but then they told me that they didn’t like the idea of me doing things without them due to jealousy, and told me about how they are a manipulative person. I guess you could classify that particular case as someone using me for some odd self-validation/obsession. It makes me sad to think that I’m doing something similar in my pursuit of romance, that is that I’d be using another person for self-validation.

People will have also asked for things like documents, money, help with school, as well as another person’s number, from me. I’ll add onto the list if I recall more.. Since I’ve distanced myself from others I haven’t been asked for things too much of late. Now there’s just silence on a lot of fronts. I wonder if I’m just flattering myself trying to think that others even cared enough about me to use me. 

I self deprecate because it’s a bad habit I’ve picked up, I struggle with self esteem issues, and I’ve been rather depressed of late. I don’t doubt your integrity. I apologize, I didn’t mean to come off like that. I also got a bit confused as I thought that us sending messages was more of a correspondence than a conversation. Either way, I’m glad that you find them engaging, I do as well. It makes me happy that you found my takes on monster-related media to be interesting.


You’re not the first person to tell me that I’m interesting and engaging. It’s nice to be complemented. What makes me agitated is that every individual who says such things is usually much older than I am and not someone I see in my daily life. I get frustrated wondering why I can’t connect on that same level with my peers.


I feel like I’m a sad background character because I’ve been dealing with the same issues my whole life and watching them play out in the same way. I’ve always struggled to connect with others, I’ve always been isolated, such things make me depressed. I don’t like being so negative. I want to have more positive and constructive conversations with the likes of you. I hate it when I give off the impression that I despise everyone and everything. I’m sick in the head. I seriously doubt that I’m capable of achieving any serious intimacy with my peers at this point. 

Thanks as always for your replies.
Happy New Year."
virgin,fctc6nj,t1_fcrza1g,1577938707.0,"I want both. A relationship would likely be the most fulfilling thing between the two, though just knowing that I’m desirable enough for casual sex would be a step up from where I am. 

Perhaps I haven’t been clear. I don’t want to pay for sex. That would make me depressed. It would reinforce my low opinion of my myself. I want to know that I am wanted, not my money.


Most people I know in real life don’t engage with me all that much. I often need to initiate things between us. People tell me that they value me and then ignore me weeks, even months, on end. Whenever people do chase after me it’s usually because they want something from me or have other ulterior motives. I second guess what people tell me because their actions often scream different stories.


There are people who want me around, but no one wants me romantically. Very few want me around as a friend. People want me around living a hollow life that has mentally destroyed me. 


I think that you must not know very many conversationalists if I’m up there in your mind. 99% of people I try talk to will disagree with you. 


I have had supports. They’re not enough though. At the end of the day I’m alone. I’ve always been some pitiful child that people will occasionally take pity on. I’m not meant to be a friend or a lover, I’m meant to be a sad fixture in the background of happier lives."

You mentioned the use of medication. Have you also tried other forms of therapy?"
virgin,fc7fr2y,t3_eb7kdx,1577506084.0,"I think that you raise some good points and arguments. Heroes are often so perfect that they’re hard to identify with. Everything seems to fall into place for them. The Monster, a victim of circumstance, mistreatment, their own failings, etc., are far more imperfect, and thereby far more relatable and easier to project our own selves onto by comparison.




Monsters have been representing people for some time. You mentioned Frankenstein, one of the main influences of Mary Shelley’s work in this case was The Sorrows of Young Werther by Goethe. Both Frankenstein and Young Werther are unappreciated beings who struggle to cope with rejection from those they seek acceptance from.

An even simpler example could be The Princess and the Frog. Many people feel like an ugly creature who is forever waiting for that special someone to come along and, through their affection, help them achieve their fullest potential.

Though historically inaccurate, Shakespeare’s Richard III is another “monster” who struggles with many issues that the audience can relate to. He has a negative body image, feels as though he is at the mercy of fate and cannot escape his “true nature”, and teeters between self-loathing and narcissism. Many consider the character to be a rogue anti-hero.


In one of Cormac McCarthy’s least spoken of but chillingly relevant to works, Child of God, the protagonist Lester Ballard, is what many today would be called an incel (though it’s debatable whether or not he’d meet the strictest definitions). A mentally disturbed 27 year old, Ballard is universally rejected by those around him. In his isolation, he becomes increasingly unhinged and violent. Preying on young women, unable to form human relationships, Ballard becomes what many would consider to be an Incel Boogieman. By the end of the novel, his descriptions have become inhuman. The author describes him as a monster. Interestingly though, without revealing too many spoilers, Ballard is shown to have the potential to be a truly considerate man to those he cares about, making one of the novel’s tragedies the fact that Ballard was unable to find anyone in life whom he could shower his affection on. 





In a broader sense, I’m finding that the Monster is often becoming the Hero as the Monster is easier to sympathize with than its antithesis the Hero. The Joker, once a deformed violent criminal who preyed on the innocent, has now become a sort of folk anti-hero, his personal failures and isolation making him an allegory for the many people who feel dispossessed throughout the various societies of the world. 



Sorry if I went off topic a bit. I’ve had some of these thoughts in my head for a while and have been eager to find a place to put them."

virgin,fc79l24,t1_fc6h72m,1577501154.0,"Yeah that makes sense. I was told by adults that I was “mature” in various ways. I think they just liked it when I didn’t make a fuss or cause similar shenanigans. Some also liked that I have “mature” interests. They all just prodded me down a path of isolation. 


The experience is that of being intensely intimate with another person through the act of sex. Everyone whose had sex can relate to one another on that level. In addition to that, it silently signals to others that you are emotionally intelligent enough to be intimate with another person as well as then notion that you’re desirable. Sex with a prostitute only gives you a small window into this realm. You know what sex WITH A PROSTITUTE is like. There is no substantial emotional intimacy, there is no mutual desire. If anything, telling people that you pay for sex will lower their opinion of you. You aren’t even able to find a sexual partner without paying them first.


Mentally, I haven’t progressed from when I was a child. I’ve been in a state of mental stagnation. Deep down I’m just a scared child. I think others can see that. Who in their right mind desires a scared child? 


I have goals and ambitions. Reality has seen to it that such dreams have been all but dashed. I’m stuck dealing with the same issues in the same old way over and over again. I can’t seem to change that. I’m destined to forever live in that cycle of torment. 

The fact that I’m a repulsive virgin is one of the main sources of my sorrow. I just want to be accepted and wanted in return. Prostitution can’t give me that. I don’t want to miss out on the natural pleasures of life. I’ve already lost my teen years. I cannot get them back and I revile myself for that failure. 


I don’t know if I’d recognize anyone loving me in a romantic way. I’ve never experienced that. I just want to find out whether or not I can recognize that. I want the opportunity to fail as well as succeed.

My friends are few and far between. It’s not uncommon for me to go days, even weeks without people contacting me. I’ve met a few people in my life who will occasionally invite me into their life in the sense that they’ll introduce me to people and have my try new things. Most of the time I’m an afterthought for most of my “friends”. Many will say that they like me and whatnot, but will, as previously mentioned, forget I exist for a while until they’re bored and need someone, anyone, to distract them. It’s always been that way for me. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I consistently fail to meet people with whom I can develop close relationships, platonic or otherwise.

People tell me that I deserve love and happiness, but nary an individual among them desires me in any romantic way. People tell me that IN THEORY I’m loveable and desirable. Yet in practice their theories are proven false.


I appreciate your care and concern. The fact that you take the time out of your day to give me such lengthy replies is very kind of you.



I’ve met the immovable object. Something needs to give. I don’t want to die, nor do I want to continue this wretched existence. I need to take some action. Constructive efforts get me nowhere. At the end of the day I’m sad, lonely boy who cannot connect with the world around him. 


I’m crying right now. I just want to be happy, Soda. I want to intimacy to be a part of my life. No one is willing to give that to me. I just want to be loved like so many others are. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know where to go. I’ve reached the end. I want someone to show me the way."

There’s plenty more to find online, too.


The dryness and redness kinda sounds like a yeast infection (also common). Proper hygiene should clear that up.

If you’re going to a prostitute then they should get you to wear a condom, so there’d be no concern about diseases there. 

As long as you’re not actually diseased then I wouldn’t worry too much. Any reasonable girl wouldn’t lose it over some little benign bumps.

Best of luck."

virgin,fbvwh0x,t3_eef9mf,1577137081.0,The body degraded as life goes on. Sensations both physical and emotional can dull. Sex in your teens isn’t the same thing as sex in your 50’s. I’m afraid of missing out on experiences due to my body going downhill over time.
