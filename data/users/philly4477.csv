NewMexico,ffgfo8j,t3_ethl26,1579905178.0,"I’m a new-ish abq resident haven’t been to the caverns yet. When asking locals though they use words like ‘amazing’ and ‘spectacular’, I haven’t heard a one bad review. That’s my second hand account of what the visit is like."
selfimprovement,fdp30al,t1_fdolvmu,1578618786.0,Right but if someone’s feelings don’t matter to you shouldn’t you still be mindful of them? A close family member for example? You’re stuck with some people.
selfimprovement,fdnw1oh,t1_fdmhvnh,1578594001.0,Interesting take. What do you mean?
selfimprovement,fdm2f4c,t3_em0cnr,1578538194.0,Do you. Break free. Be aware of other people’s feelings but exactly not responsible for them. Get it.
selfimprovement,fd0acwx,t1_fczbl4k,1578115989.0,Definitely. Take accountability for my own life. Thanks
