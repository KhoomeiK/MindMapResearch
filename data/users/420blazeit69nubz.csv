When you’re an adult it seems more like well this could be the rest of my life while you’re a kid or in college you think of it as much more temporary until the good stuff comes up. You also have little to no responsibility when you’re that age so worrying about kids, spouse, house, car etc is just not a thing. There’s certainly 2 parts to the equation 1) just working at all and then 2) working what you’re actually trained to do and/or having a decent enough job to at least not be miserable"

Nicotine is a bitch to stop on it’s own and that will certainly up your anxiety(hence why you smoke when you ARE anxious), insomnia, irritability, headaches etc. I’ve found nicotine withdrawal to be the more jarring of the two. Weed is more an annoyance plus the lack of control with my medical issues. Now withdrawing from nicotine felt like a real withdrawal which I have also experienced unfortunately. Good luck and don’t be afraid to use nicotine replacement therapy like nicorette mini lozenges or a vape."

Now it’s harder to say you’re putting your life on the line for others(I’m sure tons of soldiers do truly believe and mean to fight for those who can’t) when it’s rich politicians backed by giant corporations that exist at the insane scale they exist at because of the military industrial complex and their increase of budget ever year.

FLMedicalTrees,ff5rrak,t1_ff42x8u,1579607708.0,Why is size such a huge factor for some people? Genuinely curious because if the quality is the same personally I don’t care. Sometimes I feel like a get a larger total weight of stem if it’s just 2 buds. Is it left over from the black market? Is it because we’re (maybe correctly) that these are all the smaller buds towards the bottom of the plant that gets less light or were caused by stress and there for less potent? I’ve read articles saying this is true but then you see a lot of the minis/smalls/t3 etc have higher THC(not everything I know) percentages than some of the “normal” bud. I assume they’re trying to harvest as fast as possible so they’re not extending harvest to let them grow larger.

I’m one of those people who have a naturally high edible tolerance so I need RSO or else it’s just too expensive to consume edibles. If I make food with it then I use the distillate but for straight up meds no BS RSO is what works best plus it’s cheaper anyway.
