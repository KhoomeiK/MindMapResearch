As far as school shootings go, it would be awful to show the statistics on fatherless boys and how SSRI missed doses correlate with the shootings.  You can’t cage boys like schools do, and most fatherless kids never learn restraint/boundaries/self control as their mothers never had to learn it either and are naive to the needs of strong boundaries that boys need. Kids can’t duke out their pent up energies as children because ‘that’s bullying’, as they still get bullied in other ways and they’re helpless to fight back as the school never solves the issue, just shifts it from physical to deep mental. Then medicate the kids they ruined. Those are the kids doing the shootings."

Sometimes sand can tank through TR but not reliably. The synergy with ground/water is great for coverage. Usually if you lead rain and damp rock Pelipper you clean up with Excadrill with his fire weakness covered for a sweep.  Sand duo often just wins if it’s not countered well.

I liked the swap into Mamoswine if I thought it was happening otherwise, nobody is fire or punching Gyarados that ruins swines day anyway.

I preferred helping hand bulky togekiss more. If Morpeko isn’t the right option, often Togekiss can help, and HH changes otherwise walled situations. 

I much preferred Parting Shot on Morpeko. I always struggled with sand teams, and you’re not out speeding or twaving them anyway, but max rockfalls will knock out your cores.  With a parting shot you can survive long enough to kill them, don’t have to worry about misjudging who dynamaxed then fake out failing flinch, and similarly get another turn to fake out later, which is really helpful if they’re running lightning rod as those games always were tricky.

You simply saying ‘he’s wrong’ is just some bullshit emotional response. You have provided no retort to any of his arguments. 

He called people like you Leftists and dedicated plenty of thought to you"
todayilearned,fepfpny,t1_feozr93,1579319352.0,It’s impossible to control without religious denial of it. That is his point. There are people who can push a button and destroy the entire world in nuclear holocaust because technology progressed unchecked.
todayilearned,fepe0tw,t1_feohdlw,1579318189.0,"The Nazis thought that eugenics was purifying the gene pool for all future generations. They were doing the world a favor by sterilizing them all. 

Genetic engineering of the future (it’s here already) is going to reintroduce the same ethical dilemmas. 

And to policy makers who are directing society— that distinction you make isn’t one for them. They are effectively choosing to kill people by continuing to have society rely on their use."
todayilearned,fepdipz,t1_feopxjl,1579317842.0,"His entire argument is that technological progression is inherently aimless and inevitable.  If you choose to do nothing about it then it will inevitably progress, for better or for worse, you have no idea.  And his argument is that ultimately, uncontrollable bad will come and the pros won’t matter. 

If society stopped it a century ago, we wouldn’t be a button click away from nuclear holocaust as it stands today. Genetic engineering wouldn’t be on the verge of changing all life as we know it forever. Etc etc"

It’s a much preferred system. Pelosi would have drowned 3 decades ago with term limits. Politicians would become on average, older, since being a career politician is impossible unless you’re always moving up. Again, older the people are the harder they are to buy."

PoliticalHumor,felwqad,t1_felvc8l,1579232855.0,"Them dern large capacity rifles... what the fuck is a large capacity rifle?  Are you saying semi automatic rifles have only been around since the 90s?  Rifles are so freaking useless for a mass killing anyway, so much bulk for defenseless victims. They’re doing it for the image, not because they have any brains. There were no school shootings when Biden pushed to ban them in schools. He was scared on ghetto black kids bringing pistols to schools cause he’s a racist cunt. Almost every school shooting is done with a pistol.  Only a very few have happened with a rifle. And each one of those likely wouldn’t have happened if they knew the gym teacher even had a .22. These fatherless kids are so fragile that that much of a deterrent would have stopped it in conception.  You say they’re stealing their parents rifles... when key fact:  a few years ago the statistics were 26 of 27 largest mass shooters came from a fatherless home. And they weren’t stealing the gun from gramama or her boyfriend. 

Dunno how the hell Republicans are making money off of guns here?  Obama has sold more than any Republican ever could. 

So much gun ignorance with you city folk these days. As if the capacity of a magazine matters when it takes five seconds to swap one out. Large ones jam too much anyway.  I bet you call it an assault weapon if it’s colored black as well?"
insanepeoplefacebook,felv391,t1_felja3n,1579231674.0,"To be fair... vaccines your parents took were tiny doses of the killed virus. 

Vaccines of today are tiny tidbits of extracted parts of it and a 100 fold higher dose of adjuvants to bug your immune system out in hopes of getting it to work.

All because one shitty lab back in the day couldn’t pasteurize and the pharma companies and the government covered it all up and forced everyone to switch to the system that was completely untested (there has NEVER been a study on the level of adjuvants used today versus without, EVER), just so the pharma companies could never be held liable for kids getting sick off of vaccines ever again. 

Ya know, they could actually do the tests where they don’t also amp kids up on alumina in the controls when they do their studies about vaccines being harmless, but they won’t."

freefolk,felsp32,t1_felsbg3,1579229978.0,"They found a shitty actress just to meet a quota. Considering this is the biggest thing Polish people have going for them, it’s disappointing when it becomes muddled by D-tier talent just to meet some bullshit British virtue signaling.

The casting call for the cast was literally only open to BAMEs. That’s why all the younger females are all half Indian or black or whatever. It was a diversity hire from the get go. They never tried out any white actresses"
PoliticalHumor,felpn94,t1_felo7m6,1579227880.0,"They used to have gun range classes in fucking high school.  Nobody ever went on a rampage with ready access to weapons being given to every kid. 

School shootings weren’t even a thing until Joe Biden pushed his shitty legislation to remove all guns from school. All of a sudden kids off their modern meds are shooting them up. 

The only thing that has changed is society is full of fucking huffy puffys on SSRIs these days.

9/10 school shooters were on/off of SSRIs?!?  Ya don’t say. Don’t look into how many were being raised by single mothers either..


Just because society is full of oversocialized useless twats doesn’t make the threat of an oppressive government any less real. Look around the world today— protestors, entire races of people, etc are all being slaughtered in the modern day. Because in those countries they don’t have the tools to fight back

It’s a shame your education has failed you. I suppose the modern education that only exists to make you an obedient scared twat would be considered successful"
