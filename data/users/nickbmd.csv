Meaning you'd have a known congenital heart defect. Sotalol is a beta blocker - beta 1 specifically - lowers HR. Ok fine, amiodarone would be an odd choice, as it's favored towards ventricular abnormalities, but hey, maybe it's preventative? The lack if thinners is bizarre too given propensity of clot formation from afib. Also to spontaneously go into vfib? Strange as well. Niw, if they were synchronized cardioverting you, that's one thing, but spontaneous would be a strange case indeed."
