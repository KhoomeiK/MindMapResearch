You're identifying issues, but what are you doing to stop them reoccurring (I.e arguing.)

You need to restrain yourself. Saying something and then apologising for it doesn't undo what has been done. If I stabbed someone, then apologised and called an ambulance, they're still bleeding. You're likely also a bit narcissistic based off reasons above.

Advice,ffhwr8w,t3_etpndk,1579957336.0,"I see you've got some help but I'm here to chime in too :)

Music is large and wonderful. I'm not sure how you write your music, but most musicians, songwriters and composer improvise and take aspects they like and put then into their songs. I improv on piano and cello as piano is easiest to do it on and cello is my musical soulmate. 

Take a few piano lessons, get enough technique to play chords and then muck around until you find what you like the sound of. Improv can be deeply affected by your emotional state - like all music, it's why there are so many pove songs. 

Singing is a skill, not a talent. I firmly believe anyone can sing if they find their voice - take some lessons if you really want to try sing, choirs are fairly easy to join too. 

I'm not 100% sure what you mean by making beats, I assume you mean holding a tempo? If so, this comes with practice. It's a skill you'll develop as you go. 

One final thing - I don't mean to potentially bum you out, but there are musical rules. (Unless you like jazz, YouTube - Adam Neely). This is music theory, it's the basis for western and most other nations modern music. The system we use has been established over the past thousand years, and refined greatly over the past few hundred with classical. If you can learn some music theory I.e cord and triads it will go a long way into helping you improvise and compose.
