povertyfinance,fckszpl,t1_fckott6,1577732532.0,"Oof. I’m sure you know this but he really has to get over that mindset. Pride isn’t a good look, especially when it comes to financial planning. Caring about what you “should” have while ignoring your reality is a slippery slope.

Slight tangent here, but it’s important to remember that you can’t see financially stability from the outside. Some people see nice house, white fence, 2 cars, etc. and think that means someone has it all together financially. It doesn’t. I’m friends with a married couple who are both doctors with big salaries, but they’re living paycheck to paycheck. They have a really nice looking life but they are one emergency away from losing it all. That’s not an exaggeration.

Also your kid is so young. I’ve read so many stories on Reddit about people who remember stretches of PB&J dinners and homemade halloween costumes and family game nights, but didn’t realize until they were much older that it was because their parents were broke. All they remember is “yay more boxed mac and cheese!”  and that mom and dad played UNO every night with them. They didn’t know that the mac and cheese came from a food pantry and they played games because they couldn’t afford cable. If you’re a loving and supportive parent, that’s what they’ll remember, not where you lived when they were in kindergarten. Do what you have to now so you can be stable for them later."
povertyfinance,fckficu,t3_ehmtyi,1577724174.0,"Just spitballing but a few ideas:

Why has your husband vetoed those options? An RV seems like it would work. Maybe it’s not a long term solution but if you gotta get out of your current situation that would at least give you a place to live while saving money for whatever’s next. 

If you need to rent, how do you feel about getting a roommate? You have a child so idk how that factors in, but sharing the burden of rent could make huge difference in your options.

How many pets do you have? Do you have a friend who could take care of them for a period of time? I hate suggesting this but since you’re in a tough spot, it’s a real consideration. If you wind up homeless that’s not good for any of you.

I think it boils down to what you can make work for now. Whatever you end up doing doesn’t have to be permanent. If I’m understanding correctly, your husband should be back home around October 2021? That’s a little less than 2 years, which isn’t awesome for living in a less than ideal situation, but it’s not forever. Try to think of the long game. I suggest writing down a few financial scenarios and how they would play out over the next 3-5 years to get a real sense of the long term cost. And as others have said, making a budget and sticking to it will help you whatever you choose to do."
