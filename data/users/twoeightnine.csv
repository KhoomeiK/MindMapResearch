NationalPark,ff41xkd,t3_erdhgv,1579553767.0,"Just an FYI. The drive to Zion is only 2.5 hours but you lose an hour due to time zones as well. 

If it's Utah's Spring Break as well you're not going to have time for much of anything on that first day. Expect long lines for the shuttle, huge crowds at Scouts Lookout and further along to Angel's landing.

Don't bother with sunset in Bryce Canyon. The sun sets in a poor orientation for any late colors. Sunrise is the star."
