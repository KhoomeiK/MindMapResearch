Poland's current borders match the borders of early Piast Dynasty Poland fairly well but most of those western areas had become German over the centuries and they certainly kicked a lot of Germans out of there after the war.  And yeah, WWII was a war of conquest for the USSR so places like Lviv and eastern Lithuania that had lots of Polish people and which any reasonable person would have made part of Poland ended up in Ukraine and Lithuania.  That's kind of gets at Poland's biggest problem for the last 250 years though - they're stuck between two bigger powers and those powers have mostly done what they wanted with Poland.  But the Germans lost the war so at least this time Poland was able to pick up some territory.

investing,ffbh4ql,t3_esei9c,1579765051.0,"Cost of capital and tax advantages - interest payments are tax deductible while dividends aren't.  Let me explain...

Basically the operations of a company are going to have cash flows.  That's completely independent of how the company is financed.  No one knows for certain what those cash flows will be but there will be cash flows.  

Also, a company needs capital.  That capital can be financed through equity or debt.  If you finance the whole thing with equity then the stockholders own all the cash flows.  If you finance it with debt then the stockholders only own what the bondholders don't take first.  Thus, stock is a riskier investment than bonds.  And the stock of companies with lots of debt is a lot riskier than the stock of companies with no debt.  Anyway, back to the bondholders: If the bondholders are willing to loan the company a ton of money for dirt cheap (as they are with today's interest rates) then their share of the cash flows goes down and that leaves more for shareholders.  And if the company uses some of that dirt cheap money to buy back shares then that's even more cashflows for the remaining shareholders.  Also, unlike dividend payments those interest payments are tax deductible.  So that's even more money for the remaining shareholders.  There are limits to this sort of thing though.  As a company takes on more debt its probability of going bankrupt goes up.  That drives up it's interest rates which makes it harder to take on more debt.  Ultimately there's a point where the cost of capital is minimized and that's where many execs want to be."

worldnews,fdyhhro,t1_fdy9ztp,1578779848.0,"Airbus and Embraer have nothing to do with each other.  There are few companies on earth with the capability of building something that would take market share from Boeing's cash cow, the 737.  Embraer was one of them.  That's why they got bought.  It's not about their current product lines.  It's about what could have happened in the near future."
investing,fdy81si,t1_fduxgeh,1578777011.0,"That's how I take it and I guess it depends on who your friends are or what your goals for retirement are but I wouldn't call that ""late to the table"".  That's 68th percentile for an American in their early 50s.  Through investment gains and continued savings it would be easy to double that by 65 and that plus social security will give someone a pretty solid retirement."
worldnews,fdy4rxe,t1_fdxllyk,1578776144.0,The world needs another passenger jet company.  The problem is that with our sorry anti-trust laws as soon as it got big enough to be a threat to Boeing Boeing would just buy it as they did most recently with Embraer.
worldnews,fdy4d1t,t1_fdy3k9f,1578776002.0,Boeing does have pretty robust labor unions though.
worldnews,fdy487o,t3_enay84,1578775949.0,The layoffs are at Spirit.  That's a different company.  Boeing hasn't laid anybody off.  Not yet anyway.

todayilearned,fdxzz9q,t3_en9a32,1578774634.0,There's only one that isn't already locked to a Monday that would actually make sense to do that with and that's Veterans Day.  Almost nobody alive today remembers WWI - the end of which is where the 11/11 date comes from.  We can just as easily celebrate our veterans by giving them a three day weekend rather than some random day in the middle of the week.
MGTOW,fdxy7pj,t1_fdw5024,1578774136.0,Nobody **needs** to spend that much on a ring.  And the two months thing is just DeBeers marketing anyway.  The median amount  spent in the US is like $2K - so about two weeks salary for the average American.  If the woman wants you to spend so much that she'll literally have to fear getting mugged every time she wears it out in public then this is not a woman with any foresight whatsoever.  Take that as a warning and run.

milwaukee,fdpk498,t1_fdnzen1,1578630816.0,"Road costs aren't really an externality.  They're a direct cost and in this country they're paid mostly by the people who use them through (in the case of freeways) gas taxes and (in the case of local roads) by the property taxes of people who live on those roads.

Pollution isn't really an externality either.  Some side effect of it might be but that gets complicated.  I mean packing people into tenements has plenty of negative side effects too."
milwaukee,fdpits2,t1_fdpae7w,1578629783.0,Cities don't subsidize freeways. The interstates were built with 90% federal dollars and are today maintained by the state with a combination of state and federal money.  People in Brookfield pay more than their fair share of both state and federal taxes to cover that.
