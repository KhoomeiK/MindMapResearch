> What you’re neglecting is that a lot of people don’t actually know what they want until forced to make a choice.

No, I'm not. Often times in these situations, people know exactly what they want, until they actually do it. Then they immediately regret it. It doesn't mean that in the moment they weren't suicidal. It just means they had second thoughts.

> Additionally, many suicide attempts are calls for help. People who take a bunch of pills then call someone to tell them they took a bunch of pills. They’re subconsciously asking that person to save them. They don’t actually want to kill themselves. It’s a cry for help. Yet another thing that’s extremely well documented.

Sounds like it would extremely hard to differentiate from someone that has had second thoughts. It's only a cry for help if it doesn't work.

> Whether the attempt was genuine or not, you still take it seriously. That doesn’t mean you automatically give it credence as a genuine attempt and ascribe no consequences for the attempt. That’s just stupid. The guy set his house on fire. That endangers the lives of other people and is the exact reason why arson is illegal. Genuine attempt or not, he still committed arson. He still has to be punished for that crime. Otherwise, you’re encouraging actual malicious arsonists to set fires and claim they were just attempting suicide so they won’t get punished. Welcome to reality. It fucking sucks.

I literally never said this. You're attacking a straw man.

> You’re also ignoring that some people should commit suicide. It saves society the trouble of dealing with them. We’d all have been better off if Hitler had killed himself even sooner. Epstein definitely should’ve killed himself for what he’d done. Too bad he didn’t. Like 30 fucking years too bad. For all we know this guy was an epic piece of shit and we’d have been better off if he’d died in the fire.

I don't care. This has nothing to do with my point.

> Your oversimplifying a complex topic solely so that you feel better about yourself. This kind of thinking doesn’t help society and sure as fuck doesn’t help suicidal people.

No, I'm saying not to gatekeep fucking suicide. If someone is suicidal, it doesn't matter what method they use or attempt to use. Whether they succeed or not. They're still suicidal. Did you even read the post I was replying to before going on your diatribe?

Not just a good suggestion if you want to have great sex, also a great way to learn how to actually make things enjoyable for your partner as a young man. Learning with your (assuming similar aged) partner is great, but especially when younger it's not always easy. Sometimes younger women don't even know what they like, much less feel comfortable explaining it. Sometimes your partner doesn't want to hurt your feelings or make you feel bad.  

I'm 28, and the best partner I've ever had was a 48 year old woman who loved sex, knew what she wanted, and wasn't afraid to tell me. At 21 I learned more about how to be a decent lover from her than from any other woman I've been with.

For me it's also cheaper than normal weed. I live in Michigan which just went legal, and we've had a weed shortage state wide for a while. Eighths are like a minimum of $40 for good shit (that's black market, not store prices. Store prices are significantly higher), and a 1g cart is *about* equivalent to an eighth. Only carts cost anywhere from $25-35/g. Deals like 5 1g carts for $100 are not uncommon.

Drugs,fdcvvqh,t1_fdctrjf,1578285819.0,"Depends on what you're vaping and how you're doing it.

You can buy all different forms of concentrates, most require a ""rig"" to properly vape them, and honestly they hurt your lungs worse than a bong in my opinion. 

The easiest (and by far the most popular) way to vape these days is using prefilled cartridges, which is what I do. Since you can adjust the power of the vape, you can choose how hard of a hit you want, and how smooth it is. 

One of the coolest things about vaping is that there's a real variety of flavors. Depending on the quality of your cart (and your preference), you can find carts that just taste like normal straight weed, have no taste at all, or taste like almost anything you want. Some people complain that they can be artificial tasting, it's all about finding a good balance. I personally prefer stuff like strawberry vs overly sweet tasting ones.

The actual vaping process is a little different than smoking. You light a joint and relax as you smoke it, generally you know you're done when it's down to a roach. With vaping I just tend to take 4-5 hits slowly over a couple of minutes. Vaping generally takes like 5 minutes to hit for me, then it hits pretty hard.

And finally the high is different. Smoking weed gives you that confused, funny foggy feeling along with the ""high"" feeling. Vaping weed tends to be more clear headed. Whether that's a good thing or not is up to you. I like to vape when I'm working so I can keep a clear head, but sometimes I prefer to be foggy minded (like when I'm mowing the lawn or something)."

* The change of the Roman military structure from a citizen militia to an imperial force, which meant soldiers became loyal and *reliant* on their generals.

But if my SO said she liked it, I'd probably be willing to at least entertain the thought of growing some kind of facial hair out. Depending on if the request is reasonable (you know, like a trimmed beard versus full Duck Dynasty).

todayilearned,fcmzw7m,t1_fcm5gjb,1577799092.0,"It's important to remember that the Greek city states did not hold universal values at all, and that trying to apply the values of one group to another rarely works. On top of that, Macedonia itself was considered somewhat different from the other Greek city states (not that a concept like being a ""Greek"" truly existed back then in terms of a modern state, it was more like a loose concept) by their contemporaries.

On top of that, the approval of homosexual relationships tended to wax and wane depending on the time and location, and full blown homosexual relationships (meaning those that exclusively took the place of heterosexual ones) were very rarely accepted. When it happened, it tended to be the exception, not the rule. Often times what was accepted hinged on concepts like who penetrated who, with the one being penetrated considered to be shameful. 

Even furthermore, sometimes you had cultures (most famously Athens) that accepted and even encouraged concepts such as [pederasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pederasty_in_ancient_Greece), which very rarely ever meant a truly life long, exclusively homosexual relationship. 

Finally, it's very important to remember that those social norms followed by royalty/nobility/the very wealthy, were often *not* the same as those followed by the common people. For example (and yes I'm aware that we're talking about Greek foreign rulers here, but it still stands), incest was hyper common in Egypt (for royalty) under Greek rule for hundreds of years. Like, real, brother-sister incest. This was very much *not* the case for the common people.

Moving on to your main question, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to be ""that guy"", because no one really knows if Alexander and Hephaestion were in a romantic relationship. By modern standards, it would seem likely judging by the statements and actions expressed by the histories. However it's important to remember that things often become more bombastic in the retelling, and also that speaking/acting in ways that would be considered over the top or romantic may not have been considered at all unusual for the time period.

WhitePeopleTwitter,fbzlssu,t1_fbzl75o,1577251060.0,"I understand what you're saying, but I can't help but fundamentally disagree. To me, it just seems like common sense that when you're talking about something simple like wants and needs, you do your best to convey your feelings on the matter as clearly as possible. That is the best way to go about getting what you want.

That doesn't mean you have to be brutally honest in all things, all the time, but when you're going to get food or something, yeah you say if you want something. Even if you're not sure, say that you do, that way you're not eating someone else's food if they don't get you something.

It's a bit of a pressure point for me, I grew up not always having a ton of food around. I get really annoyed when anyone eats off my plate, even my SO."
