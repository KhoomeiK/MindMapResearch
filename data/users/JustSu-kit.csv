2nd: this life form is unable to consent to being here and living by the already stated standards of living you literally raise a child based off of your own unbiased/biased opinions and one day that child could conform to a whole new set and what are you to do when you can no longer agree with your child‚Äôs decisions ?

If someone can bring you into this life with no objection to their current circumstances then any individual should have a right to leave as well in a way that doesn‚Äôt leave others scarred for life like; seeing you hang your self from the family room ceiling, finding you in the bathtub with your wrists slit, seeing your mangled body in an auto accident that you committed on purpose ....or seeing a pool of blood around your body from a fatal shot through your skull. 

I‚Äôve had so many family and close friends that have been scarred for life and left in a state of confusion as to why someone committed suicide in such ways and I‚Äôve also grown up with a suicidal/depressive siblings with no will in their eyes to go on. These people deserve their right to die peacefully as they wish.

It‚Äôs not easy watching your parents crumble before you because you see the world for what it actually is 

I always made my parents cry in some way when I was a child 5-15 and felt no remorse, I was labeled as a sociopath by my siblings for not being a good little puppy expressing the text book behavior.  

But later on as I and my siblings grew older they  saw that I had a voice that said the truth about what was really going on in life that we were being abused and manipulated and once I knew and they also new they were furious which led to me countering my parents tactics and I did the best I could to shield my siblings from them telling them to keep things between the 3 of us.

My whole childhood from my perspective as an adult now is that this is all one giant game.  

I hate the people my parents turned my siblings into 

My brother has major PTSD and is easily triggered and let‚Äôs people walk all over his intelligence for their beneficial gain he was forced by my mother who knowingly knew he would not be able to return to the states where he was raised he fought his way back so he could continue his life and went through extreme amount of trauma hence the PTSD 

My sister I pieced together this year that at a young age she was addicted to pain medication 800mg of just about any pain medication you can think of  and followed the path of my mother and had a child with no throughly thought out plan. 

I completely cut myself off from them this year seeing that their minds can no longer handle the truth I know of the world as an adult now if they knew what I knew they would no longer be on speaking terms with my parents or other family members. 

Is it that I know too much to want to live the script any longer I never asked for this existence and on the behalf of my siblings I know they never asked for any of this as well."
antinatalism,fc8ods2,t3_eggvre,1577539015.0,"Society has had a major increase of suicides lately and there are clear distinctions in your news, your communities, and government that shows the lack of communication of truth being dispelled to the masses. We are lied to on a daily basis and we know it, but feel as if there is nothing we can do.

Society is scrambling to make sure you find a mental health provider to numb you up and dumb you back down so you won‚Äôt feel the need to commit suicide. No one can generate money from a dead body. Can‚Äôt pull out a loan to gain slave work from you any longer. 

Suicide is the ultimate freedom that no one can experience until they take the gruesome leap to hang, point a gun to their head and blow there brains out splattering blood and brain tissue and muscle everywhere normally in the home of their family, so when they finally come home or haven‚Äôt heard from you in a few days they see what is before them and it leaves a burned mental image in their minds forever and thoughts of ‚ÄúWhy would they do this to me‚Äù 

Why in the fuck would you like to come home and see that your child has killed them selves in a gruesome way because this is the only way to relieve yourself from your wheel??

If people actually cared about one another this would not be happening and people would be allowed the choice of euthanasia and they‚Äôd be allowed to back out of it any time which is also a choice. maybe some people just need a near death experience to want to keep living and all the others that see that their is no point will get what they desire"
