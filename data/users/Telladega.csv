Dr. Fox,

I’ve read your work denying the science of climate change, and implore you to read – with an open mind, as all true scientists have – James Hansen’s Storms of My Grandchildren (http://www.stormsofmygrandchildren.com). This is perhaps the world’s foremost planetary scientist. The vast majority of scientists agree on a consensus around human-induced climate change, and your denial of that consensus doesn’t make it disappear, along with increasing and overwhelming evidence that it is happening (melting permafrost, methane bubbling in the arctic, sea-level rise, polar ice loss…).

I ask you to re-examine the evidence and consider your own grandchildren, if you have them.

￼Hawaii ReporterJune 23, 2011 at 1:15 pm

RESPONSE FROM THE AUTHOR: The climate has been warming and cooling for millions of years. There have been a nominal 600 periods of warming over the past 1,000,000 years. This is no evidence that current climate events differ in anyway from that climate history. Out of the last 10,500 years, 9,300 of them have been warmer than the temps of today.

Furthermore the global warmers are being caught routinely using extremely poor data, omitting other data (especially T data which has been omitted showing cooling in many places)., fudging other data (T data, CO2 data, sea level data, glacier data, etc). None of the warmers have discussed their poor data nor the horrendous lack of data quallity and control programs, Hansen among them. He is completely untrustworthy.

I could go on to discuss the IPCC misrepresenting a lot of climate events such as the Himalayan glacier situation (written largely by the bogus Greenpeace), the failure of the IPCC peer review processes, to the omission of 90,000 surface CO2 measurements. Books are being written summarizing these misrepresentations.

You also are missing tthe point. This is not about whether the climate is warming or cooling. It is about whether humans are the cause. The working hypothesis can be stated “Man-made CO2 causes globaal warming”. There are huge sources of natural CO2, such as the oceans, which are estimated to contain 39,000 billion tons of dissolved CO2, the atmosphere is estimated to contain 780 Billion tons, another 2,300 billion tons come from plants, soils, and humus. The human contrbutions are estmated to be about 7.2 billion tons of CO2 annually. This number is smaller than the total estimated errors in the other 3 sources!!! The oceans emit billions of tons of CO2 annually and absorb some of it in other places. You might want to read up on Henry’s Law which discusses the solubilities of gases in water. About 97% of the CO2 in the atmosphere is from natural sources. To suggest that these natural sources are not involved with climate while only man-made sources are, is ludicrous. No science that I know of has explained this.

Basically the IPCC forbid any consideration of other natural sources of warming such as the sun. Advances are slowly being made in spite of the warmers and the IPCC,with solar irradiance, solar magnetic fields, solar magnet field variances, and how all of these interact with the impressively large cosmic ray fluxes from deep space. These likely have an effects on earthen cloud formations (and therefore our climate).
To blame all of this on man-made CO2 along with the reams of poor data , and poor data quality certainly is not science, nor is consensus, nor do computer models produce any evidence.

Futurology,fcx0xlx,t1_fcx0gv3,1578046287.0,"Today, the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a report on the forthcoming impacts of climate change.

But evidence in the new report, in which a team of 91 scientists from 40 countries analyzed over 6,000 scientific studies, shows that the future is bleaker than once thought. A 2-degree-Celsius rise in temperatures would spell widespread disaster. Even if the world manages to shave off that extra 0.5 degrees, we’ll still be well on our way to flooded coastlines, intensified droughts and debilitated industries. A seemingly small 1.5-degree-Celsius bump in temperature would also alter weather worldwide, wreaking havoc on agriculture and natural ecosystems, and cost about $54 trillion in damages, according to the report. Because agriculture is the leading source of income in already poor countries, it’s likely that a crippling wave of poverty would ensue.

To make matters worse, the world is already clocking in at 1-degree-Celsius warmer than preindustrial levels, which means we’re more than halfway there. At the rate we’re going, global temperatures are set to hit the mark by 2040—unless a lot changes, and fast.

“Limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius is possible within the laws of chemistry and physics,"" energy policy expert Jim Skea of Imperial College London, one of the authors of the report, explains to Christopher Joyce at NPR. “But doing so would require unprecedented changes.”

Among them would be a 40 to 50 percent reduction in emissions by 2030—a mere 12 years from now—and a completely carbon-neutral world by 2050.
