startrek,ffuk8h9,t3_ev73j3,1580243712.0,I used to hate Q but now those are some of my favorite episodes. He used to annoy me deeply.
Cooking,ffo52dc,t3_eucjra,1580074260.0,"I always tell people get an instant pot, I’ve made incredible meals in 30 minutes, meal prepped frozen dump and cook meals, Pinterest has thousands of recipes. I love mine and I use it literally at LEAST 3 times a week. They’re not expensive anymore either I got a refurb a couple years ago for $60 and I’ve more than gotten my money’s worth out of it. They’re cheaper now. I have the most basic model and it’s perfect for whatever I need."
AmItheAsshole,ffnu1g6,t1_ffmbic7,1580070818.0,Your whiskey collection sounds awesome I’d have done the same thing myself. You’re definitely NTA
AmItheAsshole,fflp85u,t1_ffjyu5d,1580042309.0,"You are taking money from her though and more to the point it’s your fucking place too, she’s not your maid. The house is the responsibility of both of you you’re laziness is a bunch of BS. She’s asking you to help around the house and you’re shirking your responsibilities. Grow up. YTA."
AmItheAsshole,fflmp4y,t1_ffk0qro,1580041480.0,"My cat is named Zoe but I have a whole dictionary of nicknames for her. Tiny cat, twinkle toes, baby cat, little old lady (she’s 4lbs and 20 years old) I could go on and on. I typically sing them all at her... yes. I am a crazy cat lady. 

Op is NTA, honestly it’s a cute idea to have “the baileys” 
like: “have you met the baileys?”

AmItheAsshole,ffla4gf,t3_eu2fn6,1580036938.0,"NTA, I own both a wand and a vibrator. The wand is for muscle aches and the other is for.. quite obvious...The wands are for massaging your muscles, I’ve known women who use their phones as vibrators. If it vibrates you can come. Lol. If you were going downtown with your bad self when they came over that’d be one thing but you were using it on your leg. I use mine on my back and hip. You’re totes fine."
AmItheAsshole,ffkc07a,t3_etxcq5,1580020290.0,"NTA if my bf had done that I’d make him go to the store and replace everything too. I am in the same position myself, I do all the cooking, I buy the groceries, I do the shopping etc... your bf needs to go grocery shopping."

period_thoughts,ffjdf79,t1_ffjd75b,1579995934.0,I’m happy I get it on time when I do but I get such awful cramps and it genuinely makes me dizzy and sometimes sick. I would love to feel good about it but I just can’t. I’m happy that you have a positive experience though!
period_thoughts,ffjci76,t1_ffjcane,1579995403.0,"You’re not weird at all. You’re lucky if anything, at least from my perspective. My periods cripple me."
period_thoughts,ffjb8gz,t1_ffjb2rk,1579994660.0,I’m happy to help inspire you! It definitely makes my period easier. I’m glad it’s helping others too. Periods suck!
period_thoughts,ffjakil,t1_ffj9wjl,1579994277.0,"Start planning it out. Grab a heating pad, pop on a good robe or sweater, set up a snacks bowl, bring a drink and relax chicka! I love doing it. I’ve stayed for over an hour before. It helps to not try to physically stop my cramps and just let it all go for a bit. Standing can be a chore on my period with my cramps. It feels good to just chill without anything stopping the bleeding. As Elsa said, let it go!"
