I focused really clearly on it all, it almost even seemed hyper-real with the amount of detail and the odd feeling I had. The car drove past me and along the street, turning out of view. But the moment it disappeared our car turned the corner right next to where I was (where I first saw the other car). This time it stopped. My sister was not inside. Only my mum. It simply isn't possible for that other car to have existed.
