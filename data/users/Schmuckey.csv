PUBGConsole,ffgmds9,t1_fffij5r,1579909598.0,"I tell people that I’m sorry that they are dealing with so much pressure in their life that they have to waste all of their energy on a message. Sorry your job sucks, your mom didn’t love you, and or your dad never went to your baseball games. I hope the messages of hate you send to me and probably everyone you lose to fills this void."
books,ffebndz,t3_et34fh,1579842299.0,"I hate reading too. I find my mind wonders, I can never retain anything when reading. I got a 760 in the math SAT and 340 in the other. I had to take the ACT and got a 29. I never read a book in high school, and would always have to spark notes enough to get by. Major issues when I was in college, I’ll put it that way haha 

What happens to me is that I start reading..  after a few sentences my mind jumps to something random, let it be life or what I just read. At this point I am reading pages unconsciously and my mind is focused on this thought. After 5-10 pages in my unconscious brain reading connects back to earth and I have no fucking clue what is going on. I tend to stick to topics I enjoy and short reads/ articles. I have no issue retaining memories, this only happens when I read when I do not want to."
