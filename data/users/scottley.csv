AZURE,fezcy3q,t1_fez82hq,1579456028.0,"Many of the platform services have a base cost and then usage costs...  i think that any time you enlist a new resource provider and/or resource type, check the base costs. 

I think that the real takeaway here is to evaluate what feature you get for what cost and to be able to present that to a decision maker.  The ""good"" part of this is that there are web pages to go to to check pricing... in the data center days, you'd call your rep and ask about a server or device with XYZ specs, negotiate... get an answer... buy the thing... 6 weeks later it would get racked... and then you'd find out that the OS version you bought didn't have the feature and you'd argue until it got right...  all the while, the dev team is building code against an architecture that won't be able to be implemented."
AZURE,fez0osf,t1_feypltk,1579452821.0,"Always check pricing before buying something.  Include the cost of the resource and the operating requirements in your analysis of whether a resource is a good choice for your solution.  

I had a similar experience with an AppSercice Environment, but fortunately checked pricing before buying... had a conversation with my security team about the sensitivity of the data and whether a dedicated AppService Plan was OK to use... turned out Dedicated AppService Plan was good enough and that saved $1600 a month flat rate plus additional resource charges.

It's important to evaluate each resource for its correctness in your solution.  Unfortunately there are some Azure resources that have a high entry bar price; it makes it challenging to learn about them."

dotnet,fdfsuq5,t3_el3yub,1578369357.0,"Simple explanation  many details can be applied at your leisure.  If you're doing User, Business logic, data layering, this fits... onion and other architectures may be a more complicated explanation. 

The entity objects are a direct (or view) representation of the database.  The dbcontext is the tracking mechanism for changes to the database.

On top of the dbcontext would go the business logic layer, so from a user, business, data perspective, the dbcontext and entities handle all the DAL.  You could compose different data sources in the BLL or the DAL... that is up to you.  For your sanity, though... do not bring entities up into the User layer."

dotnet,fd3vxx0,t3_ejkn85,1578162118.0,"Your follow up question regarding Web Profile User info being stored in Business Entity data...  this is a VERY tricky setup... I worked on an ecommerce platform that had many front ends with many profile systems (including OAuth patterns with 3rd party Identity Providers).  No matter what you do hear, there will be failure possibilities...  in the current GDPR world, you also need to separate the user identifier from the user's personal information.  Take an AAD User as example... there is a UPN, usually an email which disqualifies it as an identifier that you could store on an object if you are going to have any supportable data sharing agreements with 3rd parties (e.g. sending order info to a Fraid Risk Profiling system).  Back with Passport RPS, it had a PUID which is essentially a user id hash (irreversible identifier). 

I think making the user id field in the business system a string field, define an interface or a delegate to generate the ID from the user tier.  You mat want to keep a mapping of the UserId to the method that generated it so that you can know what algorithm was used to generate the id.  Obvious disclaimers for per user salt in hash, etc..."

dotnet,fcufiyg,t1_fctlkyp,1577979725.0,"Your JWT is authentication material to the web server... if the server is using a profile system of its own, then it will look up the user during the authentication phase of the response.   After your token is validated and user is captured as the HttpContext.User, then all that will be left to do is to get the UserId onto the mapped Locations entity object...  in aspnet core, there is an interface,  IHttpContextAccessor. This interface can be resolved (if it is registered) from the ServiceCollection... here is a link about registering the service so that you can resolve it... https://stackoverflow.com/a/38186047

To move forward you have two choices...  you can add a line to your controller method such that after the Map call (translation of LocationsCreateDto to Locations entity) to set the UserId before you save or you can get that logic to run inside the AutoMapper mapping function."
