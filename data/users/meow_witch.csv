legaladvice,fffr5lk,t3_etdmlu,1579890004.0,"NAL, but I worked for a 401(k) holding fiduciary company for years. While it's possible (though not probable) the rules have changed in regards to the 401(k) it's very doubtful she'll be able to get ahold of that money.

The company I worked for was very careful about security before even discussing if there was a  401(k) held there. To take money out of your 401 before the year you turn 59 1/2, you'd need to call and verify the account. This means either a) knowing the pin or b) answering very specific security questions. These are not questions you created, but things pulled from your past such as former addresses, family members, etc. 

Then to actually get the money you need proof of why you want a withdrawal. The law states that to withdrawal money from a 401 prior to retirement age, you must fall under one of very few emergency reasons. Medical bills, buying a house, higher education for yourself or your children, and death of the account holder.

In this case, if she's claiming she wants the money due to his death, there would be multiple steps. 1. The company he worked for would have to tell the Fiduciary company that he is dead. 2. The fiduciary company will need a copy of the death certificate. 3. The back office of the fiduciary company then confirms that he actually is dead, and confirms probate. 4. Money follows probate rules. 

I hope this helps you feel safer for your girlfriend. I'm so sorry you're going through this and wish you all the best."

I was in a program for new mothers where a nurse came to my house once a week for the first year (then every other week for the next 2) to make sure I didn't have any questions about the new mother thing. 

One of the first things she told me is that it is not just okay to take a break, it's a requirement. She said, even if the baby is crying, if you need a minute or two away then it's okay to leave it in the crib while you leave the room. Obviously you don't want to leave them alone while they're upset for long, but you're not going to break your baby by letting it cry for a few minutes. 

On the other hand, I had an older family member who told me to leave the baby laying down unless I needed to be holding her so I wouldn't make her spoiled. My nurse said psychologists have proven that you can't ""spoil the baby"" by holding it too often. Yes, it still needs tummy time and you need breaks but there's no official length of time that is too long for holding it."

What it sounds like is a miscommunication that got out of hand. What expectations were given to your bridesmaids in regards to the dress fitting? Where they told ""here are your options, let's choose one together?"" Or ""What is your opinions on each of these?"" Or ""This is what I like, let's get you fitted""? If it's anything but the latter Joy probably thought you wanted to know her opinion and would be taking it into consideration. It is also possible that she assumed that even after hearing complaints on all the dresses you would choose one and she'd suck it up. 

She has the right to tell you she's uncomfortable. And things that you may find nitpicking may be a huge deal for her. For example, I was invited to be a bridesmaid for my former best friends wedding and, like you, she wanted everyone to wear completely matching dresses. The problem is, with some bridesmaids being a size 2 and some being a size 22 it was hard to find one that everyone was comfortable with. Things that seemed small to her made some of the girls very uncomfortable. Small ribbons around the waist made the bigger girls look even larger. Lack of sleeves or even spaghetti strapped dresses meant girls who should always wear bras to look respectable were unable to do so. Backless made the girl who had a surgery scar very uncomfortable showing it off. All of the girls were willing to suck it up and wear what was ultimately chosen, but the bride was very upset that we even mentioned these issues. I believe at the wedding only 2 of the original 5 or 6 girls were still bridesmaids. And I haven't spoken to her since a week later so I'm unsure what ended up being chosen.

Did you ask Joy if she was going to suck it up and wear one of the chosen? Or did you just say ""yeah, this isn't working, you're no longer a bridesmaid""? 

Honestly though, even if you didn't give her the chance, it doesn't matter. It's your wedding. You have the right to choose your bridesmaids and what those bridesmaids are going to wear.  If you did and she refused, then she's the AH. But if you didn't give her the chance, you may want to smooth things over so you don't loose a friend over this."

I was pregnant while watching and Jackie being turned into a Cyberman was just traumatic to me. I've always found Cybermen to be extremely creepy because they started out human. 

My mom is not a Who fan, but my daughter keeps trying to get to her to watch. Seeing my 5 year old telling my mom ""it's okay Mimi, nobody dies in this episode"" before trying to get her to watch The Empty Child was just hilarious to me. Kiddo's tried 4 or 5 times to get her to watch it, but it just creeps her out too much."

Service animal is a specially trained animal (usually a dog, but can definitely be a mini hourse).

AskReddit,fdkbznf,t3_elsknq,1578500663.0,"Technically a play, but it's been made into movies. Romeo and Juliet. 

So Romeo has been banished, and Juliet would rather live with her husband than stay with her family. She's a kid (14) so no idea how to plan things herself, go to an adult, they'll know what to do.

His fucking plan is to have Juliet pretend to be dead while sending another priest as a courier to be able to tell Romeo to come get her. What could go wrong?!

They're obviously fine with no longer living in Verona. So you sneak Juliet out of town, dressed as the courier maybe, happy ending for her and Romeo. Their families can either deal with it and start getting along or disown them and keep being jerks.  Or even better, just never tell the family where she went. They can think she died without having to see a ""dead"" body. 

And people freaking love it, and find it romantic. Fuck that."

My ex husband bought me a $35 cz ring from Walmart. I knew he had put it thought into it, because it was exactly my style. It was gorgeous and I wore it with pride because it was from him. Plus, we were young (23 and 22 at time of engagement) and I knew it would be a waste of our resources to buy me a more expensive ring when that money could go towards down payment on a place to live. 

She sounds pretentious, like being able to show off pictures of the ""perfect"" engagement and having the ""perfect"" ring is more important than who is proposing. Which is so backwards. I'm sorry this happened, but I'd feel like I'd just dodged a bullet."
