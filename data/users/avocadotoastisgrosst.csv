AmItheAsshole,fefx4kw,t3_eoley4,1579068097.0,"Did you actually use her real name?! Not the smartest decision, if you did. 

YTA. You have a $20,000 budget and you want her to spend $50-$100 on a dress? A nice normal dress (not high end designer of course) is gonna cost that much let alone a freaking new wedding dress. The bride does happen to be more of the centerpiece than the groom. I can see how you would think $1000 is expensive. I get that, but the fact that you're like let's do $50 to $100. Freaking slap in the face. If you were trying for like a super super super cheap wedding like $5000 it would make more sense to push for a dress within budget, but you have $6000 left over and you already have the honeymoon paid for. Your reaction was ridiculous. You can easily afford it and it isn't taking away from any other wedding things. Also, if she takes care of it there afte many second hand stores where she could get some money back. 

Also, getting a wedding dress fitted is 100% necessary. Do you know how heavy and uncomfortable wedding dresses can be? ALERT not all women have the same chest to waist to hip to leglength ratio. For a dress for such a special occasion to for sure look and fit right and be semi comfortable getting it tailored is KEY. You're not gonna wear a standard bra. You typically get one built in to fit perfect so no saggy boobs. I'm not saying you can't find a great dress for cheap, but the way you handled it was like nah you'll be fine in a garbage bag.
