The one thing that bothers be about health insurance is that living a healthy lifestyle statistically puts me at lower risk of the slew of diseases that a 400lb smoker is much more likely to get, yet I pay the same premium."

I'm familiar with residential housing, so I'm going to use it as an analogy.

Say instead of getting help with ADHD issues, you want to build a shed in your back yard. You've never built a thing in your life and the supplies you need have to ordered through a contractor (to make this analogy work).

So you hire a contractor and tell him what you're trying to do. He starts ordering some wood and nails for you and instead of telling you how to build the shed he gives you the names and numbers of people to call to schedule them to build it.

So you make some calls and start reading some poorly written instructions and pretty soon you've got yourself some walls. The roofer is coming in 2 days and you're not nearly far enough along, so you call the contractor but he's booked out 2 weeks and the extra meetings aren't covered in your contract so they will cost 10x as much.

Well, it turns out you were supposed to call the concrete guy first for a foundation and now you have a decent shed sitting in the mud. It works well enough, so you start storing some stuff in it. 

The rain seeps in and you constantly have to replace rotting pieces, but at least you can keep your stuff in there. Years go by and you keep getting more wood and nails until one day the contractor stops sending them.

Your shed collapses and your shit is ruined because the contractor just didn't do his job. He never gave you what you _really_ needed and no one was held accountable.

The doctor should be following up with you to see how your therapy is going. To ask questions about how the drugs are helping and make sure that you are setting yourself up for success after the dosage starts to taper down to, ideally 0."

facepalm,fgohaer,t1_fgo9ebx,1580969928.0,"Well, this appears to be in Australia, so their use of the word cordial is referring to basically any mixer, alcoholic or not.

Grenadine is basically cherry flavored syrup. Grenadine is the least fancy ""cordial"" I can think of, so I'm not sure what this bartender's on about.

Cordial in the US generally refers to any Liqueur that doesn't _necessarily_ fall into any another class, such as cognac, amaro, whiskey, vodka, etc, but will almost always have alcohol content.

Cordials are often used to add aroma/flavor to cocktails, but are served straight/on rocks as well. Common examples would be B&B, Chambord, Bailey's, Amaretto."

1st child co-slept and shared room for up to the first year. She is almost 4 now and constantly struggles with sleeping all night in her own bed as well as going to bed. 

2nd is approaching two and has been sleeping in her own room since 4 months, never cosleeping. She has had 0 issues laying in her own bed and sleeping through the night. No sleep regressions either."
