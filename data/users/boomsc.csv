I know Anakin is the usual 'literally jesus' character but honestly he seems more like Star Wars God, just one that gets corrupted W40K style. A being of completely unknown origin and unknown but potentially limitless power heavily implied on multiple fronts to have been *destined* to change the face of the force, the galaxy, *everything* (and in canon extended universe literally to hold the two halves of Force in eternal balance.)

I mean the context OP wants is weird psuedo-nonsense; but 'people who hack into systems' are 100% a thing.

UnethicalLifeProTips,ffj8i1g,t3_etxvp1,1579992970.0,"I mean do you want it *to stick* or just ASAP?

If you want it ASAP you're looking at actively framing her which *if you're good* works like a dream, but if you fuck up or don't plan properly or just get shit-hot unlucky then it's you with an immediate firing and her with a nice fat lawsuit (oh and you'll never work in a position of power again.) If she's actually bad enough to *seriously* want to get rid of and not just one of those useless cunts we all have to put up with through life, then it takes time and effort on your part.

ASAP: Identify something that's an automatic firing by company policy. Frame her to be *doing* that, and then have *your* boss/corporate catch her 'doing' it. I.E she works with children and a really obvious no-no is carrying/supplying drugs. So tell corporate you're concerned about rumours of inappropriate conduct by your employees and ask for a surprise inspection. Load up her locker with a decent amount of coke or weed, enough to *maybe* be passing it on, and then go scrub up real good. Assuming you've done it well enough she can protest but there's not much beyond she-said/vs/evidence. 

Properly: Document everything and build up a solid portfolio of her not doing her job to fire her for 'good cause' (which doesn't carry any shit like supporting them. Firing someone because they're fucking shit doesn't entitle them to claim unemployment from you.) or better yet to the point she complains about 'bullying' and it results in an HR meet where you can thoroughly demonstrate you're in the right for expecting work out of her. I.E she's a bartender. Start micromanaging her, any time you see her bitching and whining instead of working, direct her to do tasks, monitor her closes and opens, repeatedly and *endlessly* instruct her to do the 'extra' stuff (that's 100% part of bartending, like cleaning and stock rotations, but tends to get ignored because it's back-of-house and hard work). Give it a few months and fire her with due cause because she's blatantly refusing or incapable of properly conducting her job (*or* win the other way and completely break her spirit to the point she stops all her karen shit and gets on with just working.)"

Many *real* feminists are in fact just decent human beings who are fundamentally opposed to someone being unfairly treated, abused, or otherwise marginalized or let-down by society. That means that yes they are also, fundamentally, in support of mens rights as much as womens rights (as in OP, that one group of people occupying 4 in every 5 suicides is wrong.)

But that's nothing to do with feminism or them being real feminists. It's to do with them having the empathetic and caring worldview that other humans have value.

&#x200B;

Real *feminists* are, by definition of their name, advocating for womens rights. Their central focus and the effort of nuanced understanding and investigation is specifically targeted to women and their marginalization contrasted to 'the other'.

The constant retort that ""feminists do care about men"" is wrong, but beyond that, incredibly *damaging* to any effort to build up attention about mens issues (such as why suicide victims are 4x more like to be men) because it maintains this image that feminism *is* addressing that, or that it's not a *real* issue because feminism isn't giving it much due. There's nothing wrong with feminist suicide campaigns focusing on protecting and resolving women killing themselves. At all. But there *is* a problem in doing that while simultaneously claiming you're supportive of mens rights too, because it implies you (as the global historically successful and massively supported de-facto 'rights' movement) are saying the subject of the campaign (women) is of particular importance.

&#x200B;

Heck, the immediate 'Redpill neckbeard' thought everyone has when you say 'Mens Rights' should be proof enough of this. Feminism and Mascinism (for lack of a real word) both have incredibly toxic, aggressive, and anti-otherness groups: Redpillers and misogyny is equally matched with TERFs and misandry. The difference is that 'mascinism' is immediately rejected as something 'anti-women' because it *has* to be, because it's just trying to do what feminism does but for men, only feminism *already does it for both*. If you need any proof of this in the real world, google 'mens shelters' in literally any country and you'll be hard pressed to find *any* extant shelters, if not any buried beneath articles talking about how backlash and criticism from the community forced their closures."

• Cities are full of discarded cats and dogs about to be put down.

24 are charged with what *might* be considered 'starting *the* fires'.

53 are 'facing legal action' for failing to comply with the state's fire ban. Which includes [all](https://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/fire-information/fdr-and-tobans) forms of fire, including things like outdoor bbqs and welding. No fire needs to be started or result from the activity, it's just a violation of the ban by having a bbq.

Every single class is fun to play in and of itself. Obviously a medic is *best* when being a health ninja and pushing a glowing russian minigun up the map, but even with a colossally shit team of spycrabs you can still have a blast sniping players with a crossbow. In many other class-based games I've found particularly support *relies* on actively supporting others to be fun, that means as soon as people stop working with the support players, people stop playing support and the class dies.

Close-grouped objectives mean everyone's *encouraged* to cluster up as a team and teamwork exists just by proximity. Playing an engineer works because most of the time there's always someone nearby to spy sweep and teleports become team-loved necessities. There aren't any 'just deathmatch' arenas, and the unofficial one Hightower basically *never* sees any support classes for exactly that reason.

Low TTK just reinforces that as well. Half the difficulty of class-based gaming is keeping the enjoyment levels equal. Planetside 2 takes an *age* to reach a combat zone, so unless you're playing with a group of friends to make sure you have something to do on arrival, no one bothers playing anything that isn't a damage class because it sucks ass to run your medic across the map, do basically zip and die. In TF2 you can run your medic across the map and die without a single assist, but 20 seconds later you can be right back in a heavy's pocket so there's no real 'loss of enjoyment' to rolling a medic over a soldier."

gaming,fen5hk0,t1_femzr24,1579277409.0,"I do for two reasons.

Firstly it's masquerading as a shooter when it's more of a building game with shooting elements. Most of the time winning is determined by who can build the quickest and fastest, having a great gun or being amazing at shooters tends to mean very little. Myself and many others were enormously put off when we discovered that instead of running around shooting each other we found ourselves playing a resource mining and hoarding game in order to be ready to instantly build a massive Fort at the first sign of danger. Anyone coming from a shooter (such as pubg, let alone non BR games like halo or tf2) gets put off rapidly by this.

Secondly, at least when I tried it out, the game hadn't been remotely balanced to prevent team killing. There's a team mode, but the single player mode is full of people working together to dominate the match. It's not 'cheating' but it's really unsportsmanlike, and while the same thing happens in other games, it was excessive when I played forrnite, every single match would come down to a dozen or so players that just so happened to be working together perfectly as a team, then the final group would just have all bar one suicide.

Edit: Just to address the second point, I used the wrong terminology. I do not mean 'team killing' i.e friendly fire. I meant 'being killed by a team'. Sorry for the confusion."

I think it missed my ideals by being *too* war like.

AskReddit,feji67x,t1_fejcfdu,1579175334.0,"The serious side effects are a collapse of testosterone production in the body. Testosterone is the hormone in men *and* women that drives bone and muscle mass growth (among other 'manly man' things like body hair). No testosterone means *no* muscle or bone growth. I.e muscle wasting illnesses and brittle bones, such as osteoporosis. This is the functional outcome of no testosterone, as opposed to side effects of individual responses to excess estrogen or progestogen.

Obviously your subjective mileage varies, but I would say severe muscle wastage and brittle bones resulting from a potentially irreversible collapse of hormone production is significantly worse than extremely excessive period duration and exhaustion.

It's not okay for women either, because it's not comparable. If Hormonal BC resulted in permanent infertility that could *maybe* be reversed afterwards alongside guaranteed permanent loss of bone density, muscle weakness and the immense risk of osteoporosis, heart attacks, arthritis and related illnesses, and the only way to avoid that is to carefully, under medical supervision, take an individually required dosage to hold you at the very edge of that outcome, it wouldn't be used at all. Sure, *maybe* we could pretend the patriarchy of yore would have released it anyway, but I guarantee it would have been on the agenda of the Suffragettes and all waves of feminism to find better alternatives than 'neuter and rapidly kill' any woman who wants to have safe sex. It certainly wouldn't be something women had pushed to be made free for everyone.

By contrast, if Male BC was an implant that just made men shoot blanks, and carried a wide range of side effects depending on how the individuals body reacted, from absolutely nothing, to increased weight gain to tiredness to urinating blood for six months to the very, very slim chance of something more serious like a stroke, almost of which (except the stroke) could be completely undone by simply removing the implant, it would *absolutely* be something most of the population took. 

&#x200B;

But it isn't. Female BC works more or less by amping up estrogen or progestogen to convince the body it's already pregnant so that nothing takes hold. Side effects are literal *side* effects of the body's response to a surge in steroid hormones. Male BC works by *lowering* testosterone levels to a point sperm production stops, and hoping the level isn't too low to shut down the body's ability to produce testosterone at all. Side effects are not side effects at all, but the *direct* consequences of completely removing a steroid hormone from the human body."

• Bisexuals love men and women, penises are great, vaginas are great; they're sexually attracted to both.

• Pansexuals love men and women, penises are great, vaginas are great; they're sexually attracted to both.

• The predator aliens arrive.

• Bisexuals aren't interested, they love men and women, not tentacle faced aliens.

• Pansexuals *are* interested, because the penises and vaginas are completely secondary, they love the *person* and the junk they're thrusting is secondary.

The biggest difficulty is people interpret the difference as a kind of #niceguy 'higher attraction' where pansexuals are *above* such 'human qualms' as gender. It's not about superiority or 'more accepting' so much as its about attraction priorities. 

Heterosexual attraction derives from secondary sexual characteristics, men and women are attracted to women and men for the things that make them women and men; they are *also* attracted to other gender neutral qualities and traits, but don't produce attraction feelings without the things that make them women and men. Bisexual attraction is equally derived from sexual secondary characteristics, but instead of just one gender, both genders produce those attraction feelings.

Pansexuals attraction derives from the things that make them *them* (human/individuals/existent/whatever). The things that make them women or men are secondary irrelevancies. True pansexuality is more akin to *a*sexuality with a sexual bent. Asexual people can develop intimate relationships with others without the slightest trace of sexual interest, abstract of gender and based on the person and circumstance alone.

• He's protecting Gotham, not handing out justice; everyone including the monsters are given over to Gotham to deal with, if they execute the Joker then fine, but it's not Batman's call, he's the security, not the judge.

• His whole 'superpower' is being super super rational and overthinking everything. He's super aware that killing Joker is the very peak of a mountain sized slippery slope to killing anyone he doesn't like. We already see very clearly that Batman *does not differentiate* between crime, Joker gets a pounding, murderers get a pounding, bag snatchers get a pounding. (If you've seen Watchmen the movie/comic and not show, Rorschach is a 'real-world' batman and makes this point really well) Batman sees the world as black and white, criminals are bad and must be stopped; period. There isn't any lesser or middling evil and no grey lines. Which means he'd be *incredibly* susceptible to that slippery slope since he *already* refuses to acknowledge any functional difference between Joker and Brady the alcoholic bag snatcher. (The Justice Lords arc of TJL shows this nicely)

• He's mentally ill and self-aware about it. Most stories about the two revolves around them being two sides of the same coin, Chaotic Evil and Chaotic Good. Batman appreciates the only real difference between the two is his adherence to his rules. It doesn't really matter that he doesn't kill, it matters that he's clinging to a given *reason* to restrain himself. (Batman Who Laughs is great for this.)

• He's afraid of being unstoppable if he *did* go over the line. He's a super smart, exceptionally rich, incredibly well trained hero with contingency plans for literally anything and everything including stopping and killing every other superhero who might try to get in his way. He *owns* the Justice League space station and could straight up crash it into the planet (or use its super laser) if he wanted, the only guaranteed check would be superman and that depends heavily on both of their mental states. It doesn't matter if Joker is an acceptable death or even if there's no *real* risk of Batman going batty, the point is the *risk* is too great to take the chance. (Batman v Superman actually outlined this mentality despite its shit everything else. ""If there's even a 1% chance, we have to take that as *absolute* certainty"")"

2. Pretty consistent - Manager has *zero* guidance or expectation or understanding of how to conduct an interview. They just want someone to stock shelves and don't care, but several past employees picked up without any real interviewing who turned out shit convinced them they really *should* interview you, they don't know how and they don't really care either, they just don't want you to steal the copper wiring again; so they google ""Common interview questions"" and go from there to avoid looking stupid themselves.

Whether you're playing a tiny pixel game like Hammerwatch, an ancient massively outdated game like Vampires, or a super modern AAA blockbuster like Borderlands3 they'll perform identically well installed on an SSD or HDD. Same goes for size, it doesn't matter if the game is 60Gb or 600Mb, SSD and HDD perform identically.

&#x200B;

The *only* difference, and the sole benefit and reason you should ever use an SSD, is in data *access* speeds. An SSD can access its stored data *much* faster than an HDD. This is why SSD's are used almost exclusively for storing OS software, because booting up your computer requires accessing and running a lot of data. If it's on an SSD, all that data is accessed and run significantly faster (so you get a 2 second boot-up instead of 30.)

So if you have the latest and greatest 150gb mega-game, it doesn't matter where it's stored, because 149.5gb of that data is completely inert at any given time, a floppy disk is just as good as an SSD for all of that data, and *using* that .5gb of data is all performed by a GPU/CPU, the SSD has zero involvement on that front either.

The only games you should ever bother wasting the incredibly valuable space of your SSD

a) games you are immediately and constantly playing to the point the usual 10 second boot-up time being shortened to 2 is actually worth it (Remember this isn't shortening the *content*, all those intro videos and company logos still play, all the SSD does is shorten the time between \[clicking game icon\] and \[game window opens\])

b) games you are immediately and constantly playing that have *enormous* load screen times (Skyrim is a particularly infamous one, Crysis3 is too I believe, Borderlands2 has always taken an age for me.) because again all those load screens are is a placeholder while the disk retrieves data for usage, exactly the same as the space between clicking a game icon and the game opening.

It's that so much of the population has had so much past experience with *those* vegans who are vegans *so that you know they are*, that someone actively picking the (Vg) option sets their hackles up automatically."

No one wants to do things more cheaply because it sounds like they've wasted money. No one wants to be told something's healthy, because it implies they aren't. Everyone wants to stop wasting time just *getting* somewhere."
cycling,fcvpmvn,t1_fcvg8ui,1578007258.0,"I thought that might be the case. I *think* the wheel wasn't trued properly. It never had a 'wobble' but sat off centre (So it wouldn't 'rest' on particular portions and would free-spin a third of a turn to it's resting position.) and was something I planned on trying to fix as a learning experience. Life and weather got in the way and I imagine this is my reward.

I think I made it sound more careless than it is. I'm aware of the tire pressure and give it a squeeze regularly to make sure it's firm enough, especially if it feels soft when riding. I

 meant I haven't needed to inflate the tires since at least early december, and I felt spending ten minutes crouched down with my face in front of the wheel fiddling with pumps and dust caps would be long enough to have noticed a broken spoke, so 'last time I did that' is a good benchmark for when it's happened."

Your original point is *specifically* 

> selective outrage on threads like these, how dare someone mistreat an animal, but killing the same exact animal is fine.  

To which I responded that's not selective outrage. Mistreating an animal without purpose is worse than killing it for consumption. 

>Now I see, correct me if I'm wrong, but you seem to have adopted a  premise that somehow eating x as food makes it morally acceptable. 

You are wrong. See the line above. This has never been about whether eating x is morally wrong or not. This has been about whether torture is morally wrong or not.

>Since  you willingly put humans in your own examples, would YOU (in your view  not a cannibal's) find it morally acceptable to kill and eat random  innocent people when there is no need to? 

Why mine and not a cannibal when we've already established in your eyes 'food animal' is completely arbitrary since?

> I already CLEARLY addressed this point with the reply ""Of course anyone would choose the least worst option,""  

Fantastic! Then we're in agreement and there's no need to continue. 

> Oof going for the ad homs and shrill assumptions  

Clearly you don't understand what an ad hominum is. At what point did I specifically attack *your* character as proof your argument is invalid?

> Going back to that analogy again, the goal of abolitionism wasn't to  distinguish from humane slave masters and asshole slave masters, it was  to end slavery 

And going back to the original point and the title video, this isn't and was never about abolishing the use of eggs as food, it was about the casual mistreatment of chicks on a hot griddle for a joke."
AskReddit,fcinn2a,t1_fcilo4o,1577665626.0,"Just out of curiosity, are you American? And is your attitude common/have you encountered foreigners with similar attitudes?

It's a genuine interest. I'm British and while I know we're known for a binge-drinking culture (which these days feels more and more justified imo.) it caught me off guard by how completely *normal* your scenario sounded despite you clearly trying to paint a picture of twatty braggards. Even in an ordinary city workplace most people are openly looking forward to getting *multiple* beers in asap and it's not uncommon for nights out to consist of *planning* to get so drunk you forget why you started.

Actually now I think about it, maybe the entire point of 'going out' is different? In the UK going out partying isn't so much about spending time with your friends, it's predominantly about getting hammered, the socializing is just something to do while you pickle your skull.

I also remember reading somewhere that in most countries 'going for a drink after work' means literally a small 'dutch courage' for the road home or to ease off the stress, whereas in the UK 'going for a drink' means *at least* two pints."

WTF,fcdm6fo,t1_fcb2naq,1577611335.0,"No. What we eat is arbitrary. The name of 'things we eat' is not. 

If you choose to sleep on a pile of cushions, a mattress, a rock or a bed of nails your decision is potentially an arbitrary one, but it doesn't make calling the place you sleep 'a bed' arbitrary.

> Then you go on to to include killing and eating humans ""humanely"" as something that isn't outrageous.  

To a cannibal.

> literally both your statements would be objectionable and outrageous to anyone faced with those choices 

Doesn't matter. Your objection and outrage is as irrelevant as the cows. You will die. Your only choice is between a quick and immediate death (as we treat all food animals because almost everyone acknowledges it to be the most human) or a slow, painful one that *I* take enjoyment from (aka animal abuse, unnecessary suffering before the event of your death.)

> would you rather be enslaved by a humane slave master or an abusive slave master?  

Obviously a humane one. 'I don't want to be a slave' is at *best* part of a completely different question and dilemma, and more practically, *not remotely relevant* to the topic of 'what kind of master would a slave prefer'.

Which is the point you're failing to see and the point a huge amount of militant vegans skim over in their desperate attempts to leap straight from 'that kid skinned a cat' to 'you're a monster for eating meat'. I choose to eat animals and whether you like that fact or not is irrelevant, you have no prerogative to argue that I can't, and the question of whether I *shouldn't* is a completely different topic to whether or not *if I'm definitely going to*, should the animals have their eyes gouged out with spoons just for fun first?

Ironically the inability to separate those two completely different topics is why so much animal abuse continues today. It's impossible to see the dairy workers stomping on calf heads for the wall of protestors trying to stop anyone drinking milk."
WTF,fcaur0a,t1_fc9y0ua,1577577003.0,">Food animal is an arbitrary distinction

No it isn't. Animals we eat are food animals, animals we do not are not.

>in another country dogs and cats can be considered ""food animals,"" if I were some psycho cannibal, you would be a ""food animal.""

Yup, and the point still stands. Replace 'animal' in my original sentence with pig, cow, cat, dog, fish, human, tree and the point is just fine. The outrage over animal abuse isn't that we're consuming the animal, it's that we're abusing them.

>. Of course anyone would choose the least worst option, but there is  another option, it was always a false dichotomy. You simply don't have  to do either of the two.

No there isn't. You die either way. There is no other option. The only option is *how* you die, and I have yet to see anyone justifiably argue they *want* to be torturously maimed and slaughtered across a period of hours or days rather than immediately put down with a bullet."
