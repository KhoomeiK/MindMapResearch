If you want to learn Baptist, even with potato aim you can totally do fine, I have potato aim too and can keep my team up just fine.  I think the definitive video guide for him is still ML7 unranked to GM Bap series.

I'd also recommends Brig who is very different to heal with and isn't exactly a main healer but is extremely powerful if done right. I don't think there is a good guide on her but Violet is an awesome streamer and talks a lot about her decision making process. She also did a video with Hitscan to do a mini guide."

That certainly makes the situation muddy, are they currently homeless because of their addiction right now or would they still be homeless if they were clean.

I simply don't see the vast majority being economically driven, of course take my first have impressions with a huge heap of salt.

Another simple issue might be anxiety from losing more SR. It makes you play like shit because you NEED this account with all the nice stuff to move up to where you belong.

OverwatchUniversity,fdtzkiz,t3_en28bt,1578724867.0,"Okay, well if Dva is your main then you have a couple of important things to take care of. While the other two posts are correct I'd say large scale ideas are what are important for you. First things first, how much studying of Dva gameplay have you done? O highly recommend checking out Level 5 Pidgey who had probably the most comprehensive guide on her over seen. 

From your very brief VoD (really it should have you in defense too) the major issue that sticks out is you don't have a plan. What is the purpose of Dva? Should you be in the dead center of the enemy team? No. Should you be front lining? No. You are there to enable your team to do their job(take space) As off tank you are really great at keeping flankers out of your backline and focusing down more squishy characters. Your plan should be really simple. Watch your backline to see if someone is flanking and call them out while you jam a mech in their face.  If you backline is safe try picking out one person on the enemy team that is squishy and make it your job to make their life difficult. 

Next big thing is booster control and rockets. You need to cancel your boosters waaaaaaaaay sooner. Boosters should be a way to get in to do one very specific job or a way to get out. Often you'd loop around, this is a waste. Boost in enough to boop but just before you are that close start shooting missiles. Save it for when you are right in their face so all the damage goes right in their head. Then you can back out with matrix or look for another target etc. Those would be the primary two main things I'd work on for you.

I highly recommend also watching Jayne go over Dva gameplay even though it is old a lot of it is the same.

They also have their own rules for heating procedures and what questions they can ask. You really only have to look at the most recent supreme Court nominee to see how it can be bogged down.  It isn't so much that the Democratic party is blocking nominations but rather maximizing delays. This article by Harvard Politics does a really great job going over a lot of points. Personally I believe that unless there is a serious justification for calling a nominee into question it should just be rapidly pass, let the President choose who they want for the jobs they get to fill.
