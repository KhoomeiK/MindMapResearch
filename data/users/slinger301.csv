tumblr,ffm980r,t1_ffiybtr,1580050821.0,"Also, we know that marijuana based products are capable of passing an FDA trial, since Marinol (synthetic THC) has been FDA approved for decades, and was switched to schedule 3 in 1999. So no, the regulatory environment is not the problem."
todayilearned,ffj379t,t1_ffj0jgi,1579989238.0,"Yes, it is an American football thing. After you run/pass the ball into your opponents end zone (earning a 6 point touchdown), the scoring team has the option  kick the ball through the goal posts in the next play (scoring an extra 1 point),or attempt to run/pass the ball into the end zone again for 2 points (the conversion) if successful, and no points if you fail."
tumblr,ffiybtr,t1_ffitvp7,1579985720.0,"I'm not buying that for an instant. CBD revenue was over $22 billion last year. Look me in the eyes and tell me that the CBD industry can't find $0.019 billion to fund an FDA trial on Marijuana, especially as restrictions fall like dominoes. You could also do an FDA study on actual  hemp oil (CBD) which can be as low as a schedule 5
 federally, and totally legal based on state. No problemo. I suspect that the real problem is that the suppliers know they don't have a leg to stand on and an actual double blinded and controlled study will show the emperor that he's naked."

tumblr,ffiac2i,t3_etpys7,1579969116.0,"I'd like to also add: Cannabis-based products might have legitimate medicinal value, but they need to undergo the rigorous safety and efficacy testing that other pharmaceuticals go through; and smoking, per se, is still *astonishingly* unhealthy/dangerous, no matter what plant you roll up (edibles are far less risky in that sense)."
EliteDangerous,ffi6vr7,t1_ffhlxry,1579966662.0,"Sure, a pirate could DSS and find the Hotspot, and maybe even find our low wake, but some hotspots are thousands of km in diameter, and our ships sensors can only find a non SC ship at a range in the tens of km. I'd totally be on board with your idea of tracking IR  emissions (because that makes sense IRL) as long as the mechanic is also available to players as well. Then, we'd have to find metal rich and rocky rings close to the star so the ring temperature could mask our heat signature."
EliteDangerous,ffh4gq4,t1_fffz1ln,1579922861.0,I really appreciate the complexity of the EVE economy and crafting system.
EliteDangerous,ffftkql,t1_fffmxyj,1579891502.0,"Playing devils advocate: how realistic is it for pirates to consistently find you in a ring? Space is huge. I already have to suspend my disbelief that they see me SC into a ring and jump on top of me then, but if I fly a few hundred km in a random direction from my drop-in point, it's a needle in a haystack. 

I'm totally on board with your desire to add risk to mining, but I think there are more logical ways. I'd rather have my laser hit some volatile deposit and detonate the rock, or random radiation belts, or hypersonic space debris, or even a rational supply and demand economy where the price of painite tanks while the price of iron skyrockets."
EliteDangerous,ffff55q,t3_etbvns,1579882612.0,"200 hours in. I skipped the obligatory ELITE post because it was in trade and only took a few weeks. Didn't feel right, and I'll hit ELITE explorer soon enough. That said, grinding is a game I don't have time to play, and I appreciate that I can learn to fly in the ship of my choice. I don't have to stress over money (enough of that IRL, thankyouverymuch). Now that I've made my billion, I'll tour the galaxy and try out the other neat things this game has to offer without having to worry about optimizing my profits or anything like that."

tumblr,ff7m86q,t1_ff7360o,1579652903.0,"So what I'm hearing from the Cole analogy is that even if the Enterprise is docked, with the engines turned off, operating in peacetime conditions, and showing such restraint to prevent civilian casualties that they basically give the opponent a free shot, and allow them to dictate the time and place of the fight, even with *all these factors,* the weedman and the Winnebago end up splattered across the hull and the Enterprise survives.

todayilearned,ff3n2ec,t1_ff1ypmr,1579544566.0,"Should, but probably doesn't. The problem is, how do you write a law that makes this illegal? How should a politician actually word the law to stop this type of scumbaggery without inadvertently screwing over a bunch of people?"

EliteDangerous,ferxh9v,t3_eqffz7,1579359356.0,"It would be nice if the economic adjustment worked both ways (the buy price increases if no one sells a commodity to the station).  I wish iron became super valuable because everyone in the galaxy was off mining painite and no one on the station could make steel bulkheads.  I think that would make mining a lot more interesting because you would have to locate the current high-payers for a region, find new sources, and not just go off to your usual spots."
patientgamers,fers6gx,t3_eq0lnq,1579357763.0,"Star Trek Online. Not really over or underrated, but a good solid mmo. It actually had a solid set of story missions that were very lore-friendly, and it didn't have the usual mmo grind until late in the game. You could get cool ships without premium currency (and cooler ships with it), graphics and game play aren't top tier, but aren't bad. Multi-player is entirely optional, and gankers/griefers were non-existent."

So she certainly does take risk and try new things.  Certainly more risk than painting a blue square on a white background. 
But you're not going to convince me that this gallery wants huge and dramatic when there's a dead bird in a hallway. I've seen more drama (and better taxidermy) at the local nature center. And the motel 6 sign was not dramatic at all. Just big-ish. With how many skilled artists our city has, it's an absolute shame to put crap like this in a jar and hang it from the ceiling.
So whenever visitors ask about things to do, I recommend the locally owned art cooperatives/galleries rather than the municipal gallery.  The skill and overall quality is way better."
