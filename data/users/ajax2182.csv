atheism,ffhrjcd,t1_ffh17nc,1579950144.0," I feel like I have no idea where to take this argument. Just because something is valid and clear, doesn't mean it follows the scientific method. I feel like all of our disagreements come from our different view on what 'the scientific method' is. And as someone who was taught this quite clearly in high school I'm not sure what to say. So let me try to make this as clear as possible. The scientific method requires a clear, testable hypothesis that links cause and effect (often in the form If (the independent variable is changed), then (the dependent variable will change in this way).) This is such that it can clearly be deemed true or false, and no other claims about anything regarding the matter is made. We don't try to ask something like ""What are the factors that influence..."" because that is open to so much bias and it becomes virtually impossible to deem any factors statistically significant. And there are many statistical tests that are used to test if the results from an experiment deem the hypothesis to be true or not. So why would we use such a method? Because theoretically (and I know this is not how it works in practice due to the the inability to control all variables) this allows one to make a claim about cause and effect and state clearly whether or not it is true, to add to a body of research in away that doesn't become outdated. Other fields, some of which like to call themselves science (like psychology), end up with experiments that cannot be reproduced as they yield different results every time. Again, it is the nature of the field that it is hard to apply the scientific method and that doesn't mean the research isn't valuable, but like I said, the true scientific method applied as intended has no flaws, no errors and in practice the errors that are introduced are measured, with P values used to calculate probability that the experiment gave the result it did out of pure luck.

So this comes back to the point I was trying to make earlier but maybe wasn't clear enough: In the experiments outlined in the article that you linked to, what was the hypothesis? what EXACTLY were they trying to test? how did they know their result wasn't a consequence of pure luck but confirmation bias got the better of them?

I only originally posted about it not being science because I have yet to see enough clear scientific experiments, following this method, to prove each of the necessary components explaining the theory of evolution. Which is why I would need to see the original papers rather than reading a summary from a website trying to just inform people on the rough method and conclusion. So if you're so confident that it's legitimate science, show me a scientific research paper from any reputable journal that actually conducts a fair and honest scientific experiment following the scientific method."
atheism,ffgw035,t1_ffgt1r3,1579916479.0,"Sorry I totally missed the link. I will read it as soon as I get home and then update this comment.

EDIT: The experiments outlined in the article provide plenty of scientific bases for the mechanisms of natural selection, particularly the last on the peppered moth. However I remain unconvinced that this should be put under the domain of science when it seems more like making a series of observations and then drawing conclusions with arguments and reasons. This, in many key ways, differs from the process of outlining a hypothesis that draws links of cause and effect, and testing that hypothesis using mathematical methods that allow one to test if the result is statistically significant. We can't just say we think giving more water to a plant makes it grow faster, test it, find that to be the case in our experiment and deem it true as it could be by random chance that it grew faster and that possibility has to be eliminated (or measured). Because again, just to be clear, I'm not saying there isn't sufficient evidence for evolution, I'm saying that evidence sits outside of the realm of science. So, if you can find them, I would be much more interested in reading the original papers as published for the outlined experiments to read the original hypothesis. Because it feels like you're trying to argue that there is lots of evidence for evolution and convince me of it, but I completely agree. I am just not convinced that the way this evidence is collected and analysed is much different from the world of psychology or history, as compared to something like physics. I am looking for a way that the strict scientific method has been applied to proving the many aspects of the theory of evolution."
atheism,ffgpfr7,t1_ffgfyrv,1579911726.0,"I am not trying to move the goal posts. What in your mind is different about evolution and evolution by natural selection? Natural selection is a process through which evolution occurs with other biochemical processes being required in order for the overall theory to work (like the way that genetic mutations cause discrepancies within the characteristics within a species). But if any of these aspects don't have adequate evidence than the whole theory falls apart so I think it is perfectly reasonable to frame it around natural selection because it is integral to the process of evolution. In which case I would love to hear a clear scientific hypothesis to test this to be true, rather than just providing a logical explanation. That's what really matters to me. But I'd still be interested to hear of scientific experiments that test other crucial elements of the overall theory of evolution."
atheism,ffgdy5h,t1_ffer5la,1579904095.0,"It is not that I don't believe it. Sure, it's robust, and there is plenty of evidence to support it, but I only believe in the way I can believe historical facts. You can give me all the evidence in the world that Ganrilo Princip was the one who killed Archduke Franz Ferdinand and I will still believe it to be true, but not quite in the same way, with the same certainty. There is no better fact finding method than the scientific method, even if just looking at and making conclusions from evidence is in many cases good enough (such as with many historical facts AND evolution).

I am happy to be proven wrong but then I challenge you to give me an experiment with an established independent and dependent variable and a clear hypothesis that proves evolution by natural selection. Because that is what it would take for me to change my mind. However, in any case when this debate comes up with anyone I've had it with no one can, and in this moment I'm hoping you're different.

The reason I believe this despite being a huge believer in science is the precise fact that, as someone studying data science, I believe the scientific method to be so important. And have seen the number of times it is hyjacked by psychologists who do experiments without being sure what they're testing till they're finished. It makes for a lot of BS studies and I think people are dishonest about other aspects of science that should be treated the same."

atheism,ffdybp7,t1_ffcgmd7,1579831964.0,"Yeah that's exactly what I'm saying. In my mind for something to be counted as science it has to be testable by the scientific method. For example, if I want to see the effects of increasing the amount of water I give to a plant on the rate at which it grows, my hypothesis might me ""If the amount of water given to a sunflower each day is increased from 100ml to 300ml, then the rate of growth will increase."" It is a clear, testable claim that links cause and effect, therefore we can design an experiment that will prove it true or false (or maybe that it's inconclusive). But that's a different thing from saying ""what are the effects of increasing the amount of water given to a plant"" which is unclear, hard to test and ready for a whole lot of bias. So with evolution, I am not convinced there is a clear experiment that can be done to prove it true, however we say it's true because of collecting observations and seeing patterns, more like how a historian works than a scientist."
atheism,ffdc1s4,t1_ffbmax5,1579817677.0,"Then I do struggle to see the point. The way you phrased the OP read to me as if you can't or don't understand how someone could believe such nonsense. And I agree it's nonsense, I also agree that people's arguments made to defend it are bogus. This is simply due to your implication that if someone believes in an all powerful God, then there are all these consequences of it that clearly many Christians don't believe. I'm not saying I think your logical deduction isn't valid, I'm saying it's something that has been dealt with by many believers who clearly don't agree with your assertion.

I'm not trying to make an argument from authority (especially not being a believer), nor state that the fact that this has been debated many times makes the reasons more legit. But I do think that the fact that this argument has been done to death means it'll take a new and interesting approach to actually get anywhere.

atheism,ffblk1e,t3_esgqx2,1579771266.0,"This may be an unpopular opinion here but evolution can't be proven in the same way religion can't. As a believer in the scientific method it is crucial to generate a clear hypothesis that can be tested and makes direct ties between the independent and dependent variables, to then design an experiment to prove or disprove. If you can't do this it's not science, it's in a different domain. And since evolution is an idea based on observation just like religion (but not clearly designing an experiment) I don't think it can be put under the domain of science (and this is coming from someone who believes in evolution and not religion). This doesn't inherantly make in an invalid idea, but it's like the descrepancy between historical and scientific evidence, science wins every time in my eyes."

It is incorrect to put a comma before ""and"" as the second clause is dependent on the first.

When people talk about how councelling can really help the experience is that trying to articulate what's going on forces you to think about it in a different way and with a bit of guidance from the person you're talking to it can help you reach your own solutions. I know that feeling of being lost and no one can expect you to know what to do. The best advice I was ever given was that ""you don't need to know how to do basically anything, or be good at anything, you just need to know who to go to to learn it."" So I would suggest just trying to talk. Maybe to a councellor (if there's one at your school), or a close friend who you really care about (trust me you think you're going to be a burden on them but people can really surprise you with what they'll do) or you can talk to any of the lovely people on this subreddit.

I don't know that she necessarily 'deserves' to know but telling her could make a difference.

She said she was really worried about me beforehand but didn't have the guts to say anything but she wanted to check that I was okay now.
