AskMen,ffwcuam,t1_ffvilz5,1580295779.0,"But it isn't snooping if you're using each other's phone like that. Snooping is when you specifically check for potential cheating messages with your SO not knowing about it. Like taking their phone to the bathroom while they're sleeping and checking on it. 

Of course the only way you'd find out they're actually snooping if you catch them red handed looking through your messages. I don't think anyone would have a reason to go through private messages, unless they asked you to reply for them or read a message they just got or something.

I don't really understand that angle, because like you said... It'd be really insulting that they don't trust you and think you're cheating! *And* they go behind your back to 'check' instead of talking about it.

Yes, I know some people actually do find out their partner is cheating because they have that hunch, but imo it's different if you're constantly worrying and checking on it every once in awhile. Like personally I don't see the point of being with someone if you can't trust them. I'd rather be single >_>"

The first thing that comes to my mind when I see the name kobe is kobe beef. He's that irrelevant to me. Yet I've had people shit on me asking why I'm not mourning for him. Simple.

sadcringe,ffqlun8,t1_ffq8t0x,1580138064.0,"It depends on what your definition of bad person is. Cheaters *are* shitty people and I would never excuse their actions. But to me a bad one would be if they weren't even guilty about it, for one. Not trying to defend, but there are many types out there and I only spoke of one kind. 

For example I have a friend who kissed another guy. She was deflecting at first *but* at the same time she felt horrible and regretted it all by herself, and planned to tell her bf. Which she did. She later acknowledged she fucked up and nothing could excuse it. So while she did cheat, I wouldn't call her a bad person.

But ayy, turns out her boyfriend was also cheating during their whole 3 year relationship with multiple girls. But she only found out because he accidentally left his chat open. When confronted he started saying he was lonely and blamed her for it, and he showed no remorse about his actions. He also went as far as to saying she wasn't supposed to have found out. So yeah, 0% guilt, he would never have told her about it. He was forced to admit. He said all kinds of other weird shit too, but this is a cheater I'd consider a bad person... If my friend did what he did, I would have cut her off."

Hell, some cheaters *want* to cheat because as cliché as it is, they just like the thrill of it. Doing things behind one's back and how long they can get away with it without being caught.

BrandNewSentence,ffc8u7j,t1_ffbylwp,1579794179.0,"A little mix of both happened to my friend's relationship. Her bf kept bringing up ""threesome with a girl"" to her and she kept saying no. But one day she agreed but only if she can have a threesome with a guy too. He half heartedly agreed.

They did both threesomes and they ended being jealous of the other person. Eventually the relationship got self destructed lmao

It's *usually* not a good idea if the relationship didn't start as a poly or open relationship."
