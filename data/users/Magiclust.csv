However, from what I have been able to attest on my own psychic experiences and psychographies from our most reliable mediums here in Brazil, whose proofs of his paranormal abilities were famous and attested by many who saw them, I would not advise anyone to even think of committing suicide.

I don´t think at this late in life with my growing memory and cognitive problems I will be able to develop more complex processes with things I'm learning for the first time but I'm certainly always trying to learn whatever I feel is withing my cognitive abilities:-).
Oh my main concern with veggies and fruits is the problem of pesticides, which we avoid when we buy certified organics or from reliable small organic producers.
Indeed, the problem with agribusiness for me also lies in the cruelty against animals, as I'm a vegetarian for animals' sake. However, more and more ecologists recognize the benefits of vegetarian/vegan diets for the environment as well.
I just wouldn't be able to plant my own rye or wheat and thus will always have to buy mine from organic producers but I totally agree with you about the need for us to go as off the grid as possible and the need for vertical agriculture and hydroponics in the future if we want to save our dear Mother Earth!
I will have to look up all those tomato species to find the Portuguese language translations for them, sometimes we don´t even have a certain species yet but quite often one which is similar.

Get mad? No, I've got better things to do than worry about arrogant people who don´t won´t help, drown happily in your inner hell, you deserve it:-).

My story with the German language started when I was 15 and from them on it has been an intermittent process. I hope now I won´t give up resuming my studies of the language I decided to catch up a few years ago:-)
Please, do try, there are many ways you can do it online without having to go to a course, I could suggest some wonderful online teachers' sites and Youtube channels. I personally cannot afford expensive courses so I only sign up for one who charges very little each three months (with different payment options for those who can afford) and got a scholarship from a very kind teacher whose course is amazing but I wouldn´t be able to afford if I had to pay for it. I also love getting free stuff from generous teachers who offer some of their material as samples so they get their courses more known and I often share their free material too in my postings on other social media."

Oh, as one going sixty soon, I lived my twenties in the eighties and my thirties in the 90's and, even though I do miss the incredible feelings of naive hope youth gives us and the magic of youth itself, whenever I look with lucid eyes into those decades, it really gives me the creeps.

I often use this as an alert of my consciousness to compare how I felt back in those times with the progress I still need to make in so many things or the ones I've already achieved. 

It's a good spiritual check to watch old movies and series of the different decades of one´s life to see each time how far you've gone and in what you still lag behind, it´s an exercise of inner alchemy if one knows how to make good use of these real life memories! And, for those who don´t believe in such things, at least we can agree it does help inner growth."

Mine  only pulled back at 19  (and that was in 1979!) when I decided I wouldn´t have mine  cut for  anything. So I started  bathing the  inside area  through the opening with warm water from the hose of the head shower (without the head so the water flux got more pressure). 

One  day  it simply pulled back while I was at it and  to  date I feel   deeply  grateful  to  whatever   inspired me to do   that  cause I  deem  it as one of the 'miracles' that happened  in  my  life.

And mind you, this being said by one who has always been fascinated with the topic of time travel and often get nostalgic about many things I personally lived in some decades. Nevertheless, every time I look deeper into these feelings, I realize they are quite mistaken and the negative aspects far outweighed the ones I felt nostalgic about and that in our times these same aspects exist in way more improved forms."

Moreover, the very reply given by the author of the posting shows how wrong you were, since she (or he) is a vegan herself/himself:-). As for your accusation, trying with ad hominen attacks to downplay my argument in a blatant use of logical fallacy and sophism, I can assure you I'm capable of using a great amount of vocabulary without having to resort to the blessings of a good dictionary. However, as an educator, I totally recommend their use and often resort to them otherwise, when the real need presents itself, which was not the case here:-).
I rest my case!"

I'm in a rush here due to being late with my house stuff and needing to fix me something to eat but I will read your message with the due attention later on so I can give you a more substantial response as due. Till soon:-)"
IndoorGarden,ff9pz50,t1_ff9lspw,1579718369.0,"Thank you again for the kind words. I think the first three years of learning what was really happening to me were the worst, but I slowly managed to pull myself together with homeopathy and Taoist meditation (in the first years I was so depressed my channel had gotten totally clogged up and I wouldn´t be able to tune with anything good, so  vulnerable I had become). 
My neuropathic pains were also taken for fibromyalgia but I knew it was not what the definition of the condition says so I ended up discovering by my own searches over the web that, besides the occasional pain in the bones themselves, the more frequent and excruciating pain fits whenever the temperatures low (and often with any weather change, though not as intense as with cold weather) were actually neuropathic pain, due to the intense sensation of being smashed and squeezed withing oneself, as if all your body is being pressed and twisted, which often feels like being with a heavy flu or overall inflammation.
I then found out that keeping my head warm whenever the temperatures dropped (even if just a bit) would help soothe the fits immensely, as well as never using cold water to wash my hair, even in extremely hot weather in summer, which is complicated as I tend to have convergent blood pressure in high temperatures, but I've pulled it off by just letting it warm enough to withstand in such weather and not chilly enough to cause the pain fits. I also learned that in cold weather my movements must be really slow so as not to trigger the fits and that if we learn how to detect how they start, it´s way easier to avoid the crises to get worse, during days in a row as they used to, by immediately lying down all wrapped up from head to toe and trying to relax as much as possible. I'm saying all this cause these tips might help your wife relieve her pain too, and if she also has neuropathic pains it certainly will help! Also, ever since I've started getting organic veggies my health has gotten a bit better, the pesticides ruin anybody's health but even more so those whose health is already compromised in some way!
I just beg your pardon for not sharing the links now cause I'm still amid my house stuff and didn´t even get to eat anything, so I'll have to fix me something first and take care of the more urgent house tasks to be able to select the best links for you but I felt I had to share this experience first as these tips might help her sooth her own symptoms. I will also like to talk about what I've found about magnets used for bone and articulatory regeneration and the meridian points, all of which are also related to what Taoism and Bön tradition tell us about the energetic aspects of our biological bodies!
See you soon!"
