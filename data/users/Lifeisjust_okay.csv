bestoflegaladvice,ff3jtr6,t1_ff3ghy5,1579542572.0,">My husband thinks I should let go of my childhood problems... But it's hard.

Oh my heart is breaking for you. Like, you know, the hardest lesson for a kid to learn is how unfair life is, that karma and justice is bullshit adults lie to you about, and whenever I hear about kids who were forced to learn that lesson early in the most horrible ways, especially from their own parents and family who are the people who are supposed to be supportive and there for you, at least when you're a kid... Ugh. I'm so sorry.

But letting go is for the birds. You can't let go because you haven't healed from it, I mean, I'm just an internet stranger but it sounds to me you've never been in a place in your life where you could stop, reflect on the hurt, and learn how to come to terms with what happened to you. It makes me sad that even your husband thinks you can brush it off, but I imagine he's also trying to brush stuff off if he's going through a rough time too. Brushing stuff off... No. You can't do that. I just learned about negative resilience, if you ever have a quiet moment, look up the term. Pushing things down will just make them come back harder at you, and in the meantime it's still affecting you subconsciously. Its something I'm also dealing with now, and it's super confusing because you tell yourself you're okay but you really aren't.

Okay I so veered off topic here, so I'm sorry about that. It's just, you sound like you need a hug and someone in your corner."

You have a history of surviving abuse, have you been to therapy for this? I know from my own experience that abuse changes our perception of what is normal, what we can let slide, what are red flags. This isn't necessarily a red flag of abuse but it is completely disrespectful and you will start to internalize it to your detriment. You are doing so even now.

Loving partners don't accuse each other off being sensitive. They understand that each person has been through different experiences and will try to come to a compromise over what you're sensitive about, with the understanding that neither of you are saying something offends you to be manipulative. Because manipulative behavior is sorry not something loving partners do.

Please start reflecting on other things he's said that strike you as insensitive that you decided to look past because you had Rose colored glasses on. You might have missed some red flags then since you couldn't tell they're red."
