Python,fehz3je,t3_ep99e0,1579126783.0,"i really don't like using an array element to hold the choice type.  It's cute but very hard for someone else to read.  Just use ""if choice == 1"" and so on.  

Please use more descriptive variable names.  Call x ""current\_index"" or something.  Call Ul ""use\_upper\_case"".  Call ""alph"" ""alpha\_characters"".  Call ""char"" ""special\_characters"".

I don't know what you are trying to do with getting the first character in your arrays and then using that as an array, as in:        

     l = char[0]         
currentSelect = l[cC]  

Your variable l at that point should be a single character, not an array, and trying to use it as an array to get your selected character should throw an error.  I admit I don't know everything there is to know about Python.  But if I, a decently experienced Python programmer, don't know how it works, you should put in a comment explaining it."
