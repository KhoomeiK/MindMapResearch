ITManagers,feyj4kl,t3_eque4p,1579446136.0,"I half agree with /u/AntoooH.  Yes, your manager should define expectations, and articulate what success looks like for the position.  BUT... that hasn't happened, and your manager may be so far out of the loop that he doesn't know either, which I would argue makes him a poor manager, but that's neither here nor there in the grand scheme.

I view this as a blessing in disguise.  You have an opportunity to define the metrics by which you'll be judged.  Many people would absolutely love to be in those shoes.  So forgot about who's job it *should* be to define KPIs.  It's currently yours and you're doing the right thing by embracing it and being self-aware about your past approach.  Unlike your manager, that right there tells me that you've got great potential.  Anyone can take a course and learn to admin O365, and anyone can bitch and moan about a crappy boss or broken HR system.  Believe it or not, few take the initiative to work around, or solve, such challenges.  I believe that success in IT is 75% attitude, and 25% tech skills.

Anyway, you didn't ask about that, but as an IT Director, I just wanted to recognize and commend your efforts and mindset.  

Assuming you're using a ticketing system, you can set metrics for response and resolution times that can be objectively measured.  Even if the company has official SLAs, your KPIs should be more aggressive than ""don't breach existing SLAs"".  

I'm not familiar with O365 security, but I'm sure there are audits that you can run and review every n weeks.  Performing and documenting such audits is another simple KPI.

Along those same lines [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/admin/usage-analytics/usage-analytics?view=o365-worldwide) may give you some ideas for other types of monitoring, reporting, and objectives that can be turned into KPIs.  [Here's another](https://tryane.com/en/intranet-success/).  You're an IT professional, consult with your technical advisor (aka Google) for similar article and ideas.

Once you have ideas, I strongly suggest presenting them as suggestions to your manager as a rough draft of things you think are important to the position. Let him know that you recognize his viewpoint is different than yours and that you need his feedback so you can put together a realistic set of guidelines for yourself so you can improve your performance.  If you come across as ""I'm doing your job for you, since you won't"", you may as well pack up your desk before meeting with him.  Especially since you went to HR, and he was likely informed about it.  You should set the tone with questions that tell him you care about being successful and you value his opinion.  Something like: ""I see I need to improve my performance, and here are some ideas for doing that.  What do you think?  What do I need to add or change?  What does success look like to you for my role?""

Hope this doesnt come across as preachy.  Just sharing my opinion from serving 20+ years in the business, mainly in support and admin roles, and now as a leader.  Whatever you do, good luck, and come back to let us know how it went."

LifeProTips,fem4fdw,t3_epufng,1579239406.0,"To build on this LPT: learn to fix your car yourself.  Most work isn't that difficult and you'll save well over 50% vs paying a shop.  (Example: I had a dealership charge me over $100 to replace a $15 cabin filter that required zero tools and takes less than 60 seconds to complete).

Simply following the manufacturer's maintenance schedule -  regardless of who performs it - and using the the correct fluids will go a long way to keeping your car on the road.  Just ask the fool who ""saved"" $10 by using the cheapest coolant on Walmart's shelf, then had to spent $600 a year later to replace his rotted and leaking  radiator and hoses.

Also, know what the scheduled maintenance involves, and when it needs to be performed.  No one should fall victim to a repair shop that adds unnecessary charges to your visit; but likewise, declining necessary preventative service because ""my car runs fine, I don't need XY or Z"" is going to cost more in the long run.  For example, brake pads are much less expensive to replace than pads *and* rotors.  Declining new brake pads when they are suggested by an honest mechanic will triple your costs if you wait until you NEED new brakes because.

Finding an honest shop is important;  equally so is respecting their expertise and trusting their recommendations."

They are not innately agreesive, but they are strong, smart, and protective.  If they are poorly treated or abused, they **will** stand up for themselves.  Because they are strong and powerful, they can do significant damage when they do.  

If the little shit Versache lap dogs that are poorly trained and snappy had the ability to tear off a leg rather than nipping at an ankle, people would call them dangerous and aggressive too.

It's an awfully light straw to be the one that breaks the camel's back.  But if that's where you're at, you'll have to ditch most free services.  There are decent paid email services that are privacy focused.  Unfortunately, there isn't much in the way of social media alternatives.

""Almost"" as in my girlfriend at the time and her friend physical put themselves in harms way to keep me from getting my ass kicked into the following month.

The person I offended didn't know me and didn't appreciate that I used it as a term of endearment.  It was something I picked up by osmosis from hanging out with drag queens and other flamboyant gay friends who used the word freely.

science,fcj6zzh,t1_fcih2d8,1577678836.0,">Not a single reason for them to still be run by churches in the modern day though. What possible benefit could that have?

From an article posted above (note that the context is discussing how Catholic hospitals force their reproductive health restrictions on hospitals they enter into partnerships with):

>The Church sees mergers with secular systems as a way to spread its religious message. “New partnerships can be viewed as opportunities for Catholic health care institutions and services to witness to their religious and ethical commitments and so influence the healing profession,” the Catholic Bishops wrote in the 2009 edition of the Catholic Ethical and Religious Directives. “For example, new partnerships can help to implement the Church’s social teaching.”"
science,fcj5nzk,t1_fcj0ey6,1577677884.0,"No, the capitalist way is to grow big and gobble up the smaller competition until there's less competition.  Which is why there are areas where the only option is a Catholic or Catholic-affiliated hospital."
science,fcj2ly1,t1_fciqlww,1577675722.0,Clearly you didn't read the article.  It's not an anecdotal one-off.  The Catholic Church is systematically purchasing and affiliating with secular hospitals to impose their beliefs.

science,fcj19iw,t1_fciul3c,1577674772.0,"Read the article above.  No clinic is going to perform a procedure on a woman who is in life-or-death need of emergency medical care.  That's what we're talking about here, not discretionary abortions, so a discussion about access to abortion clinics is moot.  

And to your initial comment, there is nothing stopping an individual from instructing their hospital providers to only provide care that's inline with their beliefs.  There is zero need for hospitals that impose religious-bases restrictions on all patients to accommodate the community.  Particularly a not-for-profit hospital that enjoys financial benefits confered by the government.  

Again, read the article.  The Catholic Church buying and affiliating with secular hospitals serves a very specific goal:

You wouldn't know this by all the personal injury lawfirms advertising big payouts for accidents.

It's a disgusting fraud.  They team up with a chiropractor and have you go through a bunch of expensive treatments and follow-ups at no cost to you.  Then they sue the other party's insurance for medical and legal bills.  You get nothing because you're not legally entitled to anything outside of car repairs.  They get paid for their ""work"" that was never necessary.

Plasma is a state of matter.  The above quote may as well have said that water can be reprogrammed by liquid.  

Small hint: When a manufacturer warns buyers that their product doesn't do what their sales material claims it does, that's a pretty big neon (or argon, xenon, helium... etc.) sign that you're about to waste $15k on a device that doesn't cost more than $250 to make.

If the immoral thieves selling these things actually believed in what they were selling they would provide scientific evidence - not anecdotal fables - as proof, and they wouldn't need to add this to every page of their website: ""Note: The BioCharger™ is not intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or other animals.""

Well, what's it intended for then?  

They've had over a decade to commission one or more double blind studies.  Why not submit their magic healing machine for 510(k) clearance.  And no, it's not prohibitively expensive.  In fact, it costs less than what people pay for one of these devices.

Content.  Not Ads.  I'm only aware of one instance where my devices ""spying"" on me resulted in content I'd be interested in.  And it freaked me out a bit.

I was on a Ramones kick and was listening to them for a few days in my car.  My car is 10 years old and isn't ""connected"", I can't even stream music via Bluetooth in it.

When I got home from work and opened my computer, there was an article about the Ramones in my ""recommend for you"" start page on Firefox.  I read it, not thinking much about it until it hit me.  The article was around a decade old and the only connection was that I was listening to the band in my car.  From a memory card.  Why/how did it appear when I opened my browser?  It must have been because of my phone.  A Pixel 4 that had song identification turned on.  Google claims the song ID happens on-device and they never know what I'm listening to (it may have been another service or app that was responsible though).  Mozilla Firefox claims to be a privacy focused browser, but they're obviously using data collected in interesting ways to curtate customized content.  

As an aside, I use a system-wide ad blocker on my phone and computer, plus an add-on browser ad blocker.  I RARELY see ads on these devices.  But when I go to work, sure as shit, I'm bombarded with ads for things I was looking at the night before from home, even though I don't use my personal credentials on my work computer.  

The algorithms used to link people and data is wild.  I'm a privacy aware person, but I'm at terms with the fact that targeted ads are inescapable unless I stop using technology and conduct every transaction in cash.

What I'm not at terms with is when this technology is used nefariously.  Like targeting propaganda to people most likely to believe and act on it."
