Yes, they value money and self-interest.

AskReddit,ff1kkm1,t1_ff00sl5,1579480684.0,"Uni is still an excellent idea. The loans you get are amazing, you only have to pay back 9% of your income above £25k (a threshold that rises with inflation) so if you don’t get a good job after uni you basically don’t have to pay at all. It’s impossible to go bankrupt or even end up in a bad financial situation because of it. And then the debt is wiped after thirty years. It’s a graduate tax basically.

Then also consider then that regardless of fees, you’d have to take out loans for (or otherwise fund) living costs - probably £8k/year in today’s money, maybe more. You’d have to pay that back anyway, so the marginal effect of tuition fees only hits you if you actually earn quite a lot (enough to pay off all the maintenance loans).

And finally - the repayment system is actually fairer than it was pre-2012, at least for the first decade or two when you might be financially squeezed, because for that the threshold was much lower - £17k. That’s ~£60 less per month you pay now compared to then."

The difference is that it’s their job to be well informed and to research the best solutions to the country’s problems, your vote simply decides the values that guide them in picking the best solution. (e.g. values might help you decide whether it’s more important to you that fewer people *do* drugs, or that fewer are *harmed* by them). 

You’re not expected to know the solutions and understand the intricacies, which is why we don’t do things by direct democracy (and referenda are, in general, an awful idea - see the UK as an example).

In this case, more than in any other vote, the senator should absolutely see the huge amount of criminal evidence that has built up against Trump, and vote to impeach. The opinion of constituents should be irrelevant here.

This bullshit, where you say it’s unmasculine to show emotions, is why so many guys commit suicide because they’re forced to bottle their feelings up inside until they can’t hold it any more.

I did laugh, it was kinda funny. What I have a problem with is people like you saying masculinity, femininity, and gay behaviours are objectively defined, and in particular that it’s un-masculine/gay to show emotion?  It’s almost as dumb as the people who think it’s gay to recycle. 

If you’re a straight guy (which I can only assume for you to take such views), I also feel sorry for your girlfriend if you think it’s gay and feminine for you to express your feelings. Because all men should just be cold, emotional robots, because that’s what masculinity is, right?

The very fact you say “traditionally” means this is very subjective - you’re admitting the definition of masculinity and femininity has changed over time.

When I find something cute, I show it visibly (enough that my friends joke about it) and yet I’m pretty secure in both my masculinity and my sexuality. How can that be if it’s *objectively* feminine to “let...a Dad kissing his son run your emotional responses”? That’s just your opinion and I disagree with it, making it subjective.

I mean trying to state there are objective definitions of masculinity and femininity basically runs counter to everything feminism has shown us over the past century - it’s clear that they’re not so neatly defined, and rigid gender roles aren’t a thing in progressive society any more.
