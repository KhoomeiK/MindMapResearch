Err. The reason is that the 70s show mocked and portrayed a satirized version of the 70s while MitM also did the same for it's contemporary period. A That 90's show would be much like MitM that you could just remake MitM.

Edit: I could probably do without the old technology and car jokes. Although the joke about the Internet (web) coming to be and Windows would give no end of nerd humor fodder."

web_design,fdey1u7,t3_ekv3vi,1578349024.0,"I talked to two people doing a bootcamp in KC. From what they told me, they cram 2 years of community college in to 3 months. I choked on the amount of money they were paying for the 3 months. It was like $10k to $15k. The amount for 2 years of community college.

They were still in the program so I wasn't able to find out if the job placement worked out or not. They were doing other networking so it is possible they were able to get pulled into a startup. I was dubious of the claim that 70% were able to find jobs. Most community college only place, if I remember correctly and I probably haven't, less than 30%, but they don't take an active role like I was told bootcamps do.

Big if true, but I wasn't going to risk all that money on an unaffiliated so called school."

Not sure if you want to read this, but let's just say it involves a man abusing a boy. That is the brief version. The episodes continue in the abuse involving boys.

It appears the length is similar to a cradle. Still around 100k+ words probably which is a decent sized fantasy book.

Will Wight could probably crank out 3 cradle books a year if he paced himself and did nothing else. Hell Sanderson puts out 3 100k word books a year like it is nothing. 18 months writing for Sanderson is like 1000+ page book. The amount of prep for a The Land book can't be as much as a Stormlight Archive.

But I need to remind myself that each author has their own pace. Some authors are a single 100k word book a year. Some are 1 book every 3 years and most are ""whenever we feel like it."""

You could explain away and even Richter is like, ""What are the fucking odds? Guess my luck skill is useful afterall.""

Not to say the book wasn't enjoyable, but getting halfway through the book and still dealing with notications made me worried the plot wasn't going to progress or it would fucking end setting up book 9.

In later years, you will probably have guides and fans saying to skip book 8 and go to book 9.

I can entirely believe that a lot of fans will be pissed.

programming,fc9ep8z,t1_fc9bkz0,1577551543.0,"Let's just say that streams are a much better API. All I know is that the elegance of the future APIs using futures and streams will blow your mind. What you will be able to compose will be far more powerful and generalized. I am daydreaming about databases and I can't wait.

I mean you mentioned a library I haven't used before and it might use composition with streams and futures at this level. I know the standard asyncio offers some hot API for async and I want to break me off some of dat. We get some of it in JS but nowhere near what Python has.

Edit: expert opinion here, I would give up on async file IO. Let's just say it is probably not something you will need nor should ever use. If you do need it, then may whatever Divine protection you believe in have mercy on your code.

Edit 2: if you really want to try out async file operations,  https://github.com/saghul/pyuv provides a solution. It uses libuv, so is cross platform and better than uvloop in that it opens the API to you for getting down to the file IO API. It does not work with async or steams or futures."
programming,fc9a9r3,t1_fc987yd,1577549562.0,"IO != file.

asyncio doesn't need to support async file operations. This could be the domain of another module.

What makes you think there aren't already or won't be in the future be modules or extensions that return futures or coroutines?

Aiohttp already exists for http requests. Streams are where network requests are currently. I would expect streams to be used for file IO in the future even if they are blocking.

I am actually not certain of async file operations and would be wary. Definitely something I want blocking because of all the weird or stupid shit that can happen.

Edit: if I am correcting someone, I might as well mention that concurrency != parallelism.

I mean, I understood that you meant concurrency, but why give the benefit of the doubt to a supposed know it all."

It is nice to be able to reflow the process and be able to rethink IO and the handling. I have been known to abuse concurrency and getting fucked from it but how else do you learn limits if you don't push against them. It would be nice to play with other event loops and see how my code would act.

That shit is a thing of beauty. I can't wait to jump back into Python. With my luck corporate will restrict the shit to 3.5, which is not bad but sadly no 3.8.

I am excited to see if any SQL ORM or native library has updated to asyncio. That looks like it would be baller as fuck.

Oh right. Might be able to solve several bugs when working with SQLalchemy when trying to use contexts. Then again, might need to rethink to something like Django ORM. So exciting!"
programming,fc7rhku,t1_fc7pg8g,1577516757.0,"The basics of pythonic code hasn't really changed. Teaching pythonic code is basics for any programming learning or working with Python. There will definitely be those who won't follow the guidelines, but the culture of Python is consistency.

Python done right is beautiful and that is what the culture appears to be focused. I am not sure what examples you are getting at with async, package management, syntax sugar, etc.

With anything beyond the basic coding standards and formatting, you will get deviations. As with most programming languages, idioms will continue to evolve. As they should always be allowed.

I am curious about async to be honest. I was sure there was only one way to really do it or do you mean what should be async and what shouldn't as opposed to syntax? I haven't had the opportunity to mess around with Python 3.7, but if it is anything like JavaScript, then I suspect that it will be a while before the usage and idioms are hashed out and agreed upon.
