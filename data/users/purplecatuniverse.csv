SelfAwarewolves,ff6uqr3,t1_ff6swy4,1579635284.0,"If someone asks for help and then you provide it you can either be acting out of obligation or due to empathy. But I want to emphasize that an act in itself isn’t empathy but may come from empathy.

Like responding to a text isn’t empathy, it’s just an action. But if you did it because you empathized with that person, then you are showing compassion. You feel empathy THEN you perform acts that can be described as compassionate; hence why I said compassion comes from empathy.

Empathy though goes beyond understanding negative events that happened to another. If your cable repair man tells you a story about how his daughter is the first person in his family to go to college, you might not personally relate to that experience. But you can imagine what it must feel like — how proud he must be of her via empathy. Even though it’s a happy event you can still feel empathy for this person. But there is no need to show him compassion because the word compassion applies only when another experiences misfortune. So you can have empathy without compassion but you cannot have compassion without empathy."
SelfAwarewolves,ff69tty,t1_ff5vyk9,1579622486.0,"Firstly, I don’t think anything is magic. This is a mechanism that evolved to help us improve our relationships and overall benefit our society. You’ve made some interesting leaps though with the conclusions you’ve come to.

1. You made the assumption that if empathy was to work the way that everyone but you is suggesting that we only help others to ease that pain. That’s counter to what empathy is. The whole point isn’t that empathy exactly mimics what a person is feeling, but instead we intuitively feel an echo of what that person is most likely feeling, giving us an understanding of their emotional state. Empathy is about gaining another’s perspective. Of course you don’t know for sure that’s what their feeling.

2. You also are generally suggesting empathy is some sister trait to narcissistic personality disorder. Narcissists struggle to feel empathy by definition. Everything they do is for their own personal benefit/image. Empathy, like I said before, is gaining a frame of reference for what another is feeling and I think achieving that frame of reference involves also using intelligence guided by experience. 

3. You said empathy is dangerous. We don’t pursue empathy compulsively and blindly do things without thinking of the consequences. Well, some people are reckless with it, but it’s my guess that it’s the fault of either their intelligence or experience. What you seem to be describing is someone that is helping another person to make themselves feel better. Someone that is overzealous with something they’re vaguely calling compassion, but is really just a rouse to fill some void within themselves. Like if they lost a friend to brain cancer a couple years ago, but the wound hasn’t heeled, so they become an annoyance to the family. Or the become overly intrusive because they think they can “fix” things for someone else. I’m sorry that happened to you but that sort of selfish charity is not empathy. In fact, meddling in someone’s life seems like the opposite of empathy because most people should realize they wouldn’t want someone swooping in and fixing their life.

Like missionaries. Missionaries aren’t helping the “poor little brown babies” because of empathy, they are doing it because they think it’ll help them get to heaven. And their frame of reference is strictly their own (they think a lack of god created poverty in Africa/India and that belief in their god is what made themselves more elite). Missionaries have historically done more harm than good.

4. Also you seem to think compassion is a tier above empathy. I disagree — You cannot be compassionate without empathy."

SelfAwarewolves,ff4t9e5,t1_ff3zjq4,1579571904.0,"I'm legitimately curious if the reason this isn't clear to you is because you have antisocial tendencies. This is straight forward to most. You do not need to be a telepath to help and care for others. But we help and care for others because we empathize with them.

Most people don't have to be like: ”I see person x had a house fire and her cat died. I know this is a bad thing because society says so and therefore kind words are needed. I think I should send them a heartfelt message, as is standard protocol.”. It's not as mechanical as that.

Instead people are immediately swollowed by sadness and even feel a fear and emptiness that is an echo of what that other person must be feeling, which is empathy. Then we react from there."

So they did think I was lying which is what I responded to.

Despite my apparent first impression, I’m not slow. I’m a PhD student in virology/immunology. The doctor did say his reading was 68% and did make him stay until it was 90%. What I suggested was that the doctor may have experienced this before and knew the reading was artificially low whether it was due to his slight thalassemia or something else. And she must have wanted him to stay until it read normally. She didn’t communicate that to us, but that’s what I figure happened.

After the first comment I looked into it, and of course I now understand that 68 is dramatically low.

It’s almost unbelievable for you to accuse some random person on the internet of lying for flimsy reasons. More than likely, his oxygen saturation readings were low for reasons you simply hadn’t come across before.

A doctor at this clinic discovered he was a carrier for beta thalassemia several years ago. He was tested when he was very sick and they couldn’t figure out what was up. So this doctor would have known about it. So maybe, when she saw his oxygen was reading outrageously low, she probably knew that was it coupled with his asthma.

My favorite theists are those that use what I call “And there’s no way we come from monkeys!” type arguments.

They then create an argument that does a great job of validating fellow believers but makes actual scientists roll their eyes.

Not only is evolution the most fundamental pillar of biology, but most every modern experiment adds more evidence to evolution’s validity. This can happen independent of the somewhat hazy understanding of that first protobiotic cell. Having a few theories floating around a scientific community of the exact mechanics is just a natural part of the scientific process but does not at all cause the evolution theory itself to fall apart or force belief in magical beings as you imply.

BREAKING NEWS!

“The Chattanooga River Rubber Duck games may be delayed due to HEAVY RAIN! Find out more at 6!”"
atheism,fcw9jy2,t1_fcvzagj,1578020272.0,"To expand on another comment I made:

Dogs have a sort of “moral code”. Meaning there are acceptable and unacceptable behaviors and so dogs that act weird either provoke attacks, are avoided by other dogs, or make other dogs nervous. So in a sense dogs that behave with unsolicited aggression are not necessarily “just doing what animals do”. They are behaving outside of a standard innately followed by other dogs. Often these ‘crazy’ dogs freak other dogs out in the ways I described because dog’s depend on each other’s body language to communicate.

I don’t see how that’s very different from our invented morality. There are certain behaviors that hinder the ability of our societies to function smoothly, so those deviant behaviors are considered wrong to various degrees. That’s why I talk about them in terms that apply to humans.

And by “pure” I mean they aren’t influenced by societal pressures. They are insight into what human traits are likely cultural vs more or less innate.

It’s true, I live in Alabama in the boonies, and we do not have packs of dogs running around and we don’t have a stray cat problem. So that does impact my view of animals. Back in undergrad, I was attacked by a dog and needed stitches but to me it was an outlier.

And on the roach people: They are insane. I have to get ice from their floor and no shit, last time I went, a lady was in the ice room with a trash can filled to the brim with cockroaches. And these are American southern fat ass roaches, about the length of my palm. And she glared at me the entire time I was in there without saying a word."

Because ultimately, as gross as they are and as unruly as they can be, they are just 4 legged fury idiots with nothing against you personally. And being insulted that others own dogs as pets and not as work dogs is not logical."
atheism,fcvi4c9,t1_fcv13ed,1578002569.0,"People seem to also not accept that both dogs and cats can have mental illness to varying degrees. Their brains are complicated and as such a multitude of things can go wrong. I’m not saying a dog can suffer from schizophrenia, but I think that they can perceive the world in an unhealthy way that is not normal, causing them to lash out.

Edits:

(Though if you see my other comments I don’t necessarily think your mindset towards dogs is rational/reasonable.)

And also dogs themselves have a sort of “moral code”. Meaning there are acceptable and unacceptable behaviors and so dogs that act weird either provoke attacks, are avoided by other dogs, or make other dogs nervous. So in a sense dogs that behave with unsolicited aggression are not necessarily “just doing what animals do”. They are behaving outside of a standard innately followed by other dogs. Often these ‘crazy’ dogs freak other dogs out in the ways I described because dogs depend on each other’s body language to communicate. If a dogs body language doesn’t match how will other dogs communicate with them?"

Are dogs gross and irritating? Yes lol 100%. So I get why people would rather stay away. But I love them anyway, as I love all animals. They are so pure and happy. And particularly, I find their behavior interesting and I love to observe it. I think they are amazingly evolved little creatures.

But he (or she) seems to have an active hatred for both dogs and dog people, which I find irrational, unnecessary, and eye roll inducing."

The physician decides if the risk of the medication is worth it. And death definitely is not one of the symptoms, so her conspiracy that  Fluoroquinolones are secretly causing the deaths of people is way off base.

Unfortunately, I think older people are often given antibiotics like cipro because they are more susceptible to the bacteria that they cover. We all know that an elderly person falling sick with pneumonia or Hib is devastating. They are given these serious antibiotics. And sometimes they die anyway. But it’s not because of the antibiotics.

I’ve shadowed doctors for thousands of hours and saw a lot of antibiotics prescribed. Did some of them overprescribe antibiotics— of course! —but they never overprescribed Fluoroquinolones of all things."

And yeah it does make sense that her dehydration exacerbated the situation. The vet did comment that she was underweight at that time and it was so apparent.

I thought she might be under-eating. I do give her those ‘unhealthy’ treats I mentioned which my chubby mouse doesn’t get, to his disappointment. Though when she started mostly ignoring the treats I became increasingly concerned.

And your females seem to eat sort of the same as my gerbil. I’d say 3.5 tsp in 8 days is about like a tbsp in a week. Google said gerbils should eat 10 g per day and she is no where near that, so your comments are comforting."
