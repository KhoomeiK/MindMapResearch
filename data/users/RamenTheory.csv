dankchristianmemes,fdtcasp,t1_fdsmntw,1578714727.0,"I am LGBT and I was raised in a conservative Christian household, attending Christian schools most of my life. Nobody talked about gay people burning in hell. Nobody was using gay slurs. When I came out, most people were actually pretty nice and respectful to me. I feel like this story is seldom represented however, and few seem to believe this when I tell them. Maybe it depends on where you go but in my experience, Christians are for the most part tender and loving, but most everyone else seems to believe that they are all hypocrites.

However, your last comment makes me a bit uncomfortable, because — well obviously I'm LGBT myself and I wouldn't compare sin to being LGBT — but also because I think that no matter what you believe about sexuality and gender identity, self-righteous Christians and other types of sin are not really comparable. They are different issues. Sure, ""it cuts both ways"" — *empathy* cuts both ways. So does forgiveness and turning the other cheek. But I notice that Jesus spends a *whole* lot of time talking about hypocrites and self-righteous religious people, seemingly much more time than he spends condemning other sinners. I can't help but feel like there is something especially egregious about claiming to be a follower of Jesus but actually just using religion to feel better about yourself. And based on how harsh Christ was to the Pharisees compared to how harsh He was to prostitutes, I can't help but suspect that this has Biblical grounding. Another thing is that God says those who cause others to lose their faith might as well just toss themselves into the water i.e. alienating potential believers through your own self-righteousness is a really, really big deal, probably way bigger of a deal than being gay, regardless of how God feels about gay people"

Filmmakers,fcvfrbc,t3_eixype,1578001162.0,"Hi, u/Rdwomack2
I have only seen your trailer and not the entire short so please take this with a grain of salt. The one thing I did feel was that to me the visuals were a bit lacking. I wish that the colors and cinematography conveyed more of a mood or tone, and the lighting in particular feels unexpressive. In fact, to me, your location is begging to be given more of a definite mood.

Take for example that last shot of the trees — I get what you are trying to do, but the colors/time of day make it feel, well, flat. 

I also thought that other small editing touches, like the title graphics, looked very unprofessional. Little things like that can really help boost your production quality, and they are not too difficult to achieve, so they may be worth your time.

I can't speak to why exactly your film got rejected though, as there are a million variables when it comes to festivals, which are in fact a bit arbitrary — kind of like entering American Idol in hopes of being a singer"

• If you are accepted to NYU to Tisch to a program other than Clive Davis, it is up to the Clive Davis department to decide what materials are needed to apply to their program (i.e. portfolio, audition, etc.)
• If you get accepted to NYU to a school other than Tisch, you must submit an internal transfer application which will be reviewed by an NYU admissions official IN ADDITION to all the materials that the Clive Davis department itself requires. 
• If you are accepted to a program that is similar to Clive Davis or are accepted to a school that *offers* programs similar to Clive Davis, it lessens your chances of being accepted as a transfer
• Transferring is anywhere from just as competitive as being accepted as a freshman to drastically more competitive 

Overall transferring is not impossible but is certainly not a trivial or easy thing, and you will have to spend a good amount of dedicated time applying. I personally came across somebody who was rejected as an internal transfer to Clive Davis"
