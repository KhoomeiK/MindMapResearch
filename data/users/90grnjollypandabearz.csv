BreakUps,ffhnx8r,t3_et6459,1579944546.0,I made the mistake of sending my ex a book of messages 2 weeks after our brake up. I never received not one response from him regarding those messages. Absolutely nothing that I said in my messages was ever going to bring him back. Save yourself the time and effort  and don’t break NC. The only thing it does do is reopen old wounds.

DoesAnybodyElse,ff2l166,t3_erasg8,1579511088.0,Yes. I don’t ever know what to say if I get the option to leave one and then I get paranoid listening to voicemails. Like all of a sudden I’m going to get a voicemail from a ghost or something.

Selena because I know she loved to laugh. I’d love to just talk about life in general with them. They both seemed like sweet people. Plus I’m a big fan of both of them.

BreakUps,feccqe0,t1_fe7rbe1,1578970868.0,"I can relate to what you’re saying. I’m not afraid of going out but it makes it difficult to move on when you’re being constantly reminded of this other person. It is kind of like having a ghost of him in that sense. 


Yes, you’re right about the moving on part. I haven’t spoken to my ex in weeks and won’t ever be in contact with him ever again but like you said, maybe it’s his way of letting me know to move on. 


Thank you for your insight on this. Yes I can’t wait for the day that my mind doesn’t go looking for him anymore. I’m making progress but I’m really proud of myself for not being where I once was at the beginning of the  breakup.  Good luck to you as well fellow Redditor."
