facepalm,ff17bcu,t1_ff1742s,1579475980.0,I didn’t critique trump though. I just stated the fact that trump has a very small black support. Not really hate.
facepalm,ff15304,t1_ff148jr,1579475288.0,"But are there going to be black people at the rally? Sure their may be literally one or two but trump has a minuscule amount of black supporters. Like ridiculously small. While Hillary would likely attract a large amount of the LGBT community.

Genuinely though them shirts aren’t to show support towards black people. It’s to try and negate the terrible imagine trump has with POC."

You make them sound like a bunch of farm animals or something. You keep changing the scenarios to try and fit your narrative.  You can’t look at someone and tell what their sexual preference is. You can however look at someone and tell what race they are. If you wore a shirt like that most people would likely assume you are gay. However if you’re clearly a fat middle aged white man wearing “Blacks for trump” then it comes across stupid. The slogan would imply that they are black people themselves who are going to vote for trump. But they aren’t black."

facepalm,fexvulf,t1_fexuyxt,1579437299.0,But there’s proof of that incident happening. A video. It’s not about the fact he was the screenwriter that shows me this story is bullshit. It’s the whole interaction. So you’re telling me people were discussing the inner workings of the comedy movie “men in black”? Then it so happened that the screen writer was there. Who happened to overhear there conversation perfectly. He then tried to insert himself into the conversation. But then they denied him because they didn’t want him mansplaining? It’s bullshit man.
facepalm,fextqbd,t1_fextlrf,1579435971.0,It’s always amazing to me when people believe everything everyone claims instead of actually thinking about it and realising that this story is very dodgy and is very likely to have not happened.
facepalm,fexsg6s,t1_fexresl,1579435426.0,Mate no. So you’re telling me that a group film students just decided to ponder the finer details of the movie “Men In Black”. A movie known for its complex narrative and gripping story. And did so in front of the movies screen writer? And then shut him down instead of listening to him. Yeah this didn’t happen.

However I do believe he is extremely over hyped due to being English. He can score and that’s what city need. Aguero and KBD are the two stand out players in that team, Kompany also when he was there. He is very overrated and he doesn’t seem to be improving."

Gamingcirclejerk,febvhep,t1_febul4a,1578963169.0,I mean this is literally a sub mocking you and people like you. Not sure why I’d leave but you’d stay? If you do not believe that the gaming community is rife with horrible people then your being naive. GRU is just one place this racist hangout. There are plenty of other places they reside.
Gamingcirclejerk,febtipr,t1_febsc2j,1578962543.0,"Not really. I’m a mix race male so I’ve had to play games all my life with protagonists who do look like me or have one defining trait that I don’t have. Sure when I see a black protagonist it makes me feel happy and included by having someone of my race being the main role in a game. But I’ve had no problem playing games with white protagonists my whole life. 

White straight males have a abundance of characters they can relate too. There was literally a huge block of gaming from 2007 until 2012 were all you’d see on game covers was a dark haired white man holding a gun. You can’t expect every single character to relate to you and only you."

Mate where not about to have a rap battle. It’s just you trying to explain to me why gamers are oppressed. 

> A) the game community isn’t like this at all. you’re propping yourself up by painting the community as a bunch of racist, sexist, homophobic, bigoted incels 

I’m not painting them like that. That’s what they are. 

> You are shitting on your own community to make yourself look good which is a major douche move.

My man I’m definitely not a “gamer”.  Nor will I ever ever claim that title. 

> B) being on a high horse doesn’t make you better than other people, just more snobby and pretentious.   Not a good look.

I’m not on any high horse?

> C) you don’t strike me as someone who would understand satire.  Admittedly GRU has taken a dive.  I’m not really on there much these days.  But still, you don’t seem the type that has the maturity to understand what it was attempting to do.

And this is what’s wrong with subs like GRU and other places on this site. You can’t be straight up racist, homophobic and sexist and then slap the label of satire on it. It’s very disingenuous. What level of maturity do you need to look at someone saying, “13% = 50% haha funny”. That sub shows a clear lack of maturity.

> D) you can shit on all the communities you want, just makes YOU look like an asshole. Not someone people invite to hang out.

Well my mates aren’t sadistic racist gamers who pin their whole identity on the games they play. So it’s cool."

Yes it is awesome that gay people are being represented more. However it is spoke about more due to it not being the norm. The LGBTQ community is one that has had to deal with many hardships and years of oppression. Instead of moaning about them celebrating some positive representation, how about you cheer with them."
