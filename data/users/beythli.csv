Hahah, I totally wanna second this statement. 

Personally I can't stand ANY insects, (even gotta keep my distance with butterflies and fireflies), but grasshoppers really freak me out. Had one manage to get into my open car window, hit me in the face, and then land on my leg just to chill there looking at me. Was so afraid he was gonna jump at me again, forever freaks me out."
