MensRights,ffg296p,t3_etfpmc,1579896891.0,"Yeah dude, it’s wrong. We don’t want to be generalized by feminists, and we shouldn’t generalize women. There are traits that are more common in either sex, but no traits are exclusive to one or the other."
MensRights,ffdlasj,t3_esyxcb,1579823295.0,"1. No. I don’t think many people here do, and personally, no, that term doesn’t apply at all. I am more than capable of getting a date on any given Friday, and while I do like to wait a few months to have sex, I’m not a virgin. Aside from not fitting the technical definition of the term, most people here also don’t believe in things like “sex redistribution” or want to murder anyone, so we don’t fit the cultural definition either.

2. I believe in equality of opportunity, not equality of outcome. Women and men aren’t exactly the same, and in general, most of us tend to fall into gender roles a fair amount. If a woman is interested in STEM, by all means she should go into it- but she shouldn’t be privileged because she’s a woman any more than a man who wants to teach kindergarten. With physical jobs, women are going to be less common because women are, on average, physically weaker than men, on average. If a woman is capable of doing the job at the same level as her male coworkers, then she shouldn’t be discriminated against, but nor should she get any special favors. There are always going to be people who don’t fit gender roles, and they should be able to do as they wish, but a larger number of people do fit those roles, and that isn’t a problem. 

3. Legally speaking, women have more rights than men, even if the draft is ignored. Women have the right to bodily autonomy and to reject parenthood through abortion or adoption, while men are forced to pay child support whether they want a kid or not. Women are, in many places, considered incapable of rape, which leaves male rape victims without any support. Women are also, under the Duluth model of domestic violence, able to physically abuse their partners and have the partner arrested for putting their hands in front of their face to defend themselves. Socially, there are drawbacks to being a woman in some situations, and a man in others, but legally, women absolutely have some privilege over men.

4. Men’s Rights issues do include the draft and child support systems, but those are far from the only issues men face. Domestic abuse is one of the big ones. Almost half of DV victims are men, and yet there are no shelters specifically for male DV victims in America, and in several states, the laws protect female abusers. Only 1/10th of DV hotlines accept male victims. Rape is a similar issue. Another problem is circumcision, or male genital mutilation. Female circumcision is banned in all fifty states on girls below eighteen, in all states without willing consent, and in most states, it’s banned full stop. Why is male circumcision the choice of the mother? It’s a cosmetic surgery with numerous health risks that removes an extremely sensitive pleasure center from a non-consenting child. If FGM for religious reasons is banned (which it obviously should be), MGM should be as well. There’s plenty more to talk about, but those are two of the big ones.

5. I’m a right-leaning centrist. I used to be liberal, and then I came to recognize a few very disturbing things about the way current liberal politics work. 

6. I’m doing alright! I’m fasting today, so my head is killing me, but otherwise I’m doing okay. Hope you have a nice day!"

It only effects 0.3% of the population, and that’s a high estimate, and children who haven’t hit puberty have no way of knowing if they have it or not. If you transition a child, you’re giving them a 99.7% chance of developing gender dysphoria when their body goes through the wrong puberty. By the way- gender dysphoria has a 41% suicide rate if untreated.

This includes the ratio of grey to white matter, and the thickness of the brain stem. If the brain stem is of the opposite sex, it cannot properly sense the sex characteristics, which causes a high level of distress known as Gender Dysphoria. That dysphoria can cause nausea, panic attacks, and depression, and in over 40% of cases will end in suicide if untreated."
