PublicFreakout,ff9yrue,t1_ff9yjzp,1579724398.0,"The passenger is Deviant Ollam. He's a Youtuber who does penetration testing, locksmithing, security, and firearm videos. Some of his most popular videos are of him demonstrating the proper procedures around transporting weapons when flying, and how the TSA fucks up frequently when it comes to inspecting and handling firearms. I believe that he generally brings a couple of handguns with him when he travels to conferences."
PublicFreakout,ff9xpuw,t1_ff9us8n,1579723776.0,"Indeed. Should have called 911, given the vehicle's license plate number (which you get on ridesharing apps), and stated that your driver had refused to allow you to leave their vehicle, and was being aggressive.

Might've made the driver escalate this, but the passenger in this video concealed carries."
assholedesign,fe3ely1,t1_fe2lunf,1578848587.0,"Did you read the article you linked? Yes, they're mislabelling their powerbanks, but it's because they're labeling 30000 maH products as 26500 maH to get around some esoteric flight regulations.

They're not selling lower-capacity products as higher-capacity ones, they're doing the opposite."
aww,fe0787l,t1_fe02d2t,1578804886.0,"I've been bitten several times over the years by rats which we had adopted as juveniles, due to their having been fed through their cage bars while waiting to be adopted. It took a while to train that out of them."
aww,fe06z4l,t1_fe02cwi,1578804680.0,"Wild rats are to pet rats as wolves are to dogs. Related, but very different."
aww,fe06il0,t1_fe05qtu,1578804309.0,"Yes, but it's usually less gross than it sounds. They poop dry pellets. The slightly more annoying thing is that they pee a small amount almost constantly, as a way of marking where they live and who's part of their mischief.

The most flattering thing a rat can do, from their perspective, is piss on you."
aww,fe067hv,t1_fe02ib1,1578804073.0,"It never stops hurting, but it does get easier the more of them that you have over the years. Saying goodbye became a ritual for us, which was always sad, but became less traumatic each time.

We said our last goodbyes today with our last two boys, and the hardest thing is that we're not going to have rats again for a time."
aww,fe05ulp,t1_fdzfa77,1578803802.0,"It's worth the heartbreak.

We said goodbye to the last two of our rats today, having had seven total. I consider every last one of them to have been family, as much as any dog or cat I've had has been. They have such big, distinct, wonderful personalities, and can be so incredibly loving.

I miss them so much, and I have treasured my time with them all."

Violence should not be a part of the penalty. Especially not for administrative offences."
holdmycosmo,fdpfgyd,t1_fdne0lu,1578627260.0,"Warn, document, and leave. All of the offences she committed were administrative. Nothing was served by force being applied."
canada,fcyzqev,t1_fcysxe9,1578090685.0,"Our rights don't come from the Charter. They are intrinsic to our being. The Charter simply acknowledges and affirms those rights. The judiciary can also affirm those rights as they relate to particular happenings.

But, less pedantically, yes, the judiciary refers to the rights which have been guaranteed to us in their decision-making, and in the framework that those rights are defined there are considered to be ""reasonable limitations"". The judiciary can reason and decide about what can be considered a reasonable limitation upon our intrinsic rights.

Personally, I would have it that our rights be inalienable under the law. But, strengthening everyone's rights is unfortunately often an unpopular political standpoint."
canada,fcxvo18,t1_fcxfq96,1578071194.0,"This may well be a good use of taxpayer money if it creates valuable precedent which strengthens the right to free expression. Judicial precedent is far more valuable than our Charter, when it comes to protections of rights and freedoms."
technicallythetruth,fau8kgj,t1_fattv13,1576345649.0,"As a rule, yes, they're exempt from rules."
