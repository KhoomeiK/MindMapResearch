history,fcv58zq,t1_fcutmzx,1577994915.0,"The question was how did restaurants become a social norm.

Beer has calories and many cultures have used ""liquid bread"" as a meal replacement. (I.e., belgium monks brewing high calorie beers since they fast). Brewing and making bread requires energy, space, and skill. Wheat was currency in Ur/Uruk in 4000B.C. Wheat also supplied the material needed for nourishment.

Try to see past a restaurant in the conventional sense. The idea of people sitting together for meals that were made by others is a social norm that probably dates to prehistory.

history,fctycb0,t3_eiuljs,1577965637.0,"In Sumer, around 4000BC, there were houses of women that were beer brewers. There are depictions and descriptions that people would meet at these houses, pay for a tall glass of beer, that they would congregate around, drinking from large vases with reed straws.

There may have been an expectation that these women also served food, like bread, since brewing beer and making bread use the same ingredients.

Wheat was also used as a form of currency."
