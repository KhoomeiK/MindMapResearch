fatlogic,ff8etmo,t3_es6gf2,1579675442.0,I am always embarrassed for Ragen Chastain.  She's like a 35 year old narc trying to fit in with the cool kids at the school where she's working undercover in a 1970s after school special.
fatlogic,ff8elhb,t1_ff8cx8c,1579675185.0,"What country are you in?  I don't think there is pharmaceutical heroin in the U.S., unless that's another term for methadone or similar?  (I've been clean for 33 years, so maybe I'm just not aware of these amazing new drugs that I've missed out on...)"
fatlogic,ff8bwiq,t1_ff7o3hy,1579672292.0,Any remotely normal-sized person would die at their end weight if they lost 100 lbs.
fatlogic,ff8b7i5,t1_ff86ti8,1579671598.0,"I'm one of those people who will say something hugely inappropriate in a situation like this.  I had 5 softball-size uterine fibroids that required surgery a few years ago.  I had assumed they'd give me a little something to relax me before surgery, but I was wheeled in stone cold sober under these shockingly bright lights and everyone was standing around in silence looking at me on the table waiting for the doctor to come in.  I blurted out, ""If pictures of my hoo ha end up on Instagram I'm suing all of you"".  Everyone kind of looked at each other then laughed and then they put the anesthesia mask on me (thankfully and probably to shut me up)."
fatlogic,ff8aj67,t1_ff7fu1g,1579670950.0,"FAs are all about being tantrum throwing victims.  I absolutely hate being touched, to the point where if you wanted to torture me you would start with giving me a massage.  I avoided getting a mammogram until my mother was diagnosed with lung cancer when I was 45 and I realized I was being a fragile little idiot.  Having a technician handle my breasts is tarantula laying eggs in my mouth horrible for me.  But I do it because I'm an adult and I know that dying of a horrible disease is much worse than 5 minutes of extreme mental discomfort."
fatlogic,ff5ddro,t1_ff3lot2,1579588207.0,"I'm in the same age range as the Friends actors and when the Fat Monica episodes came on in the 90s everyone just howled over how hugely fat she was.  And yes, in the reruns now, she just seems normal, not because she's not hugely fat, but because there are so many hugely fat people now."
fatlogic,ff5bky7,t1_ff5b33m,1579586302.0,"I don't doubt what you're saying, but I wonder if this is just a U.S. lack of boundaries thing.  I'm American and female.  I have been told to smile, had my clothing commented on in very gross ways, and just generally had people comment on me just being a person in a public place, and I've never been obese.  I feel like 99% of these comments were meant in a positive or neutral way, but they are still intrusive and unwanted, and in some cases creepy AF."
fatlogic,ff5at7c,t1_ff59rbw,1579585536.0,Your first sentence is basically describing menopause.
fatlogic,ff2ctmz,t3_eqyanm,1579501018.0,"Ah, I see Ragen's changed her main grift again.  She went from elite fatlete to wellness coach to health care call-out queen.  I guess doctors are something that she deals with a lot since she can't seem to slowly walk a 5k without blowing out a joint or tearing something."
fatlogic,ff2cdtw,t3_er3kr1,1579500565.0,"300 lbs and functionally illiterate...  Honestly, I feel bad for them."
fatlogic,ff2bon5,t1_ff2bb46,1579499862.0,"No, no, no!  That could not have possibly happened because she is genetically thin so even if she ate 24 x 7 she could never gain weight!  /s"
fatlogic,fepr7nf,t1_fepq40v,1579328550.0,"I can't even imagine what it's like to have a restrictive eating disorder and be told that your only alternative to ruining your health being severely underweight is to ruin your health by being morbidly obese.  The fact that Ragen Chastain is an ""ambassador"" for NEDA tells me there is a major crisis in eating disorder treatment.  I wish you the best in your recovery and hope you find some rational treatment options."
fatlogic,fem4m85,t1_fekyoh5,1579239589.0,Tortilla chips with basil pesto out of the jar.  At least Nutella probably doesn't cause dysentery symptoms...
fatlogic,fehjwc3,t3_ep4l2t,1579118047.0,"I'm more interested in where it goes on to say that guilt over eating messes with your metabolism and so you gain weight if you feel guilty about what you're eating, but you don't gain weight if you don't feel guilty.  I can see where not feeling guilt over eating ""bad"" foods may indicate that a person has a healthy relationship with food, leading to their ability to maintain a healthy weight, but the way it's written makes it sounds like you could clear your mind of guilt, eat all the junk food you want every day and lose weight."
fatlogic,fehivt7,t3_ep773m,1579117451.0,Somebody finally came out and said it:  Self-control is bad.
fatlogic,feg3pmd,t1_feet6cj,1579075544.0,"Thank you so much for this post.  You said everything that I've learned over the years about twelve step programs and what I refer to as the rehabilitation industrial complex.  They are almost exclusively for-profit programs, which as you said, are mainly staffed by people with no medical training.  If you believe in the disease model of addiction, fine, but what other disease is treated almost exclusively with self-help groups led by fellow sufferers?  I have a close friend who was in very early recovery (after her 6th rehab) who was put into a supervisory position in a sober living house.  It turned out as you might imagine.  I've experienced the suicide of a boyfriend because the 12 step model was the only treatment available and it was just not working for him.  It is mind-boggling that we have this constantly reported upon national crisis and the prescribed treatment is essentially faith healing."

fatlogic,fdr5sop,t3_emu6jp,1578679835.0,"I've gotten to the point where I am stopping before eating junk or when I'm not hungry because I think of these ridiculous screeds and I am determined not to ""nourish"" myself mindlessly throughout the day.  So, thank you HAES evangelists.  Your idiocy is inspiring me in exactly the opposite way that you intended and is helping me stay on track."
fatlogic,fcmdbzg,t1_fclj3yx,1577771234.0,"I'm not the person you replied to, but ""supper"" is another word for dinner."
fatlogic,fcllq03,t3_ehc4u9,1577750731.0,"Of course there were some fat people in the mid 20th century, but it was absolutely not commonplace, and there is plenty of photographic evidence to prove it.  No need to go around to vintage shops to try to prove your nonsensical point."
