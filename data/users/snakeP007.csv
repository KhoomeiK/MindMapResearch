Thank you!"

modelmakers,fdslsdf,t3_elmtdr,1578704849.0,"I decided to practice some tricky detail application with out much luck. I took an old curved model piece and some leftover decals. Put one over raised panel lines and rivets, and the other on a curved surface.

The one on the curved surface got wrinkles in it from the curve that I couldn't work out. I used micro set, sol, a heat gun on warm, just can't get it flat. I feel like it was flatter before the micro sol.

The second one looked ok, put the micro sol on and it conformed to the raised panel lines a bit  but now the stem of the P is crooked. 

Am I being too nit picky?  I couldn't imagine applying decals to cars.

modelmakers,fdlfmcn,t1_fdjxlwa,1578522977.0,"Thanks for the info! 
And when it's all done is when I can apply chipping effects for my weathering?"
modelmakers,fdj1n0r,t1_fdizpoi,1578456126.0,"Very helpful thank you. At what point would I try to remove air bubbles. Before the micro sol? 

Also, do the additional coats of micro sol increase the risk of the decal tearing? Sounds like it needs to be done very delicately with a very soft brush. As far as weather with scratch lines in the decal, is there a certain point you would do that?

Thanks for the info!"
modelmakers,fdj12ky,t1_fdj03mt,1578455735.0,I saw somewhere that said apply 3 coats of micro sol. I would think that would greatly increase the chances of it tearing since it melts the decal like that.

Foodforthought,fcmoy9e,t1_fcmlauu,1577785006.0,"Really? Where are you from? There are many reasons I could point to that I have difficulty finding dates, or even friends. I used to think maybe I'm unatractive and that's the reason, or something with my personality. But that's not the case. I struggle socially sometimes but have a great personality and good values and am attractive, even if I don't believe it myself sometimes. Things don't add up and I'm not entirely sure why, but like I said I have my ideas. Sometimes I feel like it just a rat race. I like a girl, but she's not interested in me and is after another guy, who is not interested in her because he is interested in another girl and round and round we go. IDK anymore."
