fosterdogs,fed4fpb,t1_fecjsmo,1578998337.0,I wish I could!! I already have three dogs and three cats!!!
lookatmydog,fe8ll6b,t1_fe8ej6c,1578927585.0,It’s so sad what happens down south. There are no laws at all protecting these poor innocent animals. It’s heartbreaking
lego,fe21o28,t1_fe1wxqk,1578833511.0,The stand that it came with that clips to the mask can be attached to other LEGO pieces. The actual mask alone can’t
bioniclelego,fe1rve8,t1_fe0ac0n,1578830226.0,"I do keep it in a display case with some other stuff I have. I was cleaning it out the other day and was like wow! I forgot all about this!😂
I did think about selling it but not even sure what I would get. Has to be worth at least 2-3k"
bioniclelego,fdzqs0r,t1_fdzqqw9,1578793653.0,Time flies!
bioniclelego,fdzfqeb,t1_fdyzj85,1578789783.0,Why’s it fucked up? I don’t get it
bioniclelego,fdzfgwa,t1_fdyo6ww,1578789683.0,"It was a pretty easy contest. 
And I think I’ll pas in the $5 offer. 😂😂"
bioniclelego,fdye68e,t1_fdy64ma,1578778766.0,Lol it really was.
bioniclelego,fdxfpyz,t1_fdx9vwr,1578768289.0,We actually had to take pics of every day objects that resembled the masks. I took a pic of the top of a white lacrosse helmet.
lego,fdx1gsd,t1_fdwp725,1578764316.0,Yes. That’s the platinum one

Here’s the link to the video. That’s if I did it right this 😬
In the video the creator is actually holding the same exact mask in my picture!!"
bioniclelego,fdwncyl,t1_fdwn87u,1578760452.0,Yes. 2015
lego,fdwma9d,t1_fdwj3hu,1578760162.0,Correct. There were six different ones
lego,fdwm65c,t1_fdwj7do,1578760127.0,It is really cool. I’ll post better pics in a little bit
lego,fdwg7qr,t1_fdwfj62,1578758341.0,Solid gold. 14k. You watch the video of how’s it made. There’s actually a video from Denmark with the creator of the mask and he’s holding the exact mask that I own! It’s pretty cool!
lego,fdwbuip,t1_fdw538r,1578757130.0,Could probably have my son do that. I’d have to dig all the legos out from the attic first😂
lego,fdwawhb,t1_fdw2ooo,1578756866.0,I’ll keep that in mind
lego,fdwaaz5,t1_fdw8soz,1578756684.0,Oh yes! Ok!
lego,fdw0k51,t1_fdvv8jn,1578753733.0,Oh really!? I saw pics of them but that was before my son was into legos so I didn’t pay much mind to them
lego,fdulq7n,t1_fduiqjx,1578734929.0,😂It came with the mask
lego,fduaygl,t1_fduan05,1578730624.0,No! I could never! Too rare of a piece.
lego,fduajet,t1_fdu74xe,1578730413.0,Not sure there really a market for it. I’d hate to have someone get it and just melt it down for the gold😬
lego,fduacxh,t1_fdu7k57,1578730325.0,Makes sense
lego,fdu6vtz,t1_fdu6etn,1578728626.0,I never understood why LEGO valued it at $150 when it’s solid 14k gold. I took it to get appraised when I won it and it’s worth well over $1500!
lego,fdu6ior,t1_fdu6etn,1578728454.0,Yep! Very cool piece!
lookatmydog,fdtnc68,t1_fdtdyqy,1578719262.0,That’s fine😂💕

lookatmydog,fdrt00x,t1_fdrrfxu,1578689292.0,Awe thank you so much. And thank you for rescuing! Rescue pups are so loving. It’s so sad how animals are treated down south. They are just disposable objects and laws don’t protect them down there. Every month we get about 300 pups and dogs that come up here to NJ from GA high kill shelters. They all get divided to several different rescue groups who in turn place them in foster homes until they can be placed in living forever homes. Sunday I am getting three pups from a litter of 7 that were found in a dumpster. Someone threw them away like they were trash!!!😡😡. I’ll post pics when I get them. Keep an eye out!

aww,fdq58v0,t1_fdpkstp,1578655423.0,The big one is a chocolate lab and the litter one is a Jack Russell mix we think. He was my foster fail. I had to keep him because he loves Gunner so much💕💕
