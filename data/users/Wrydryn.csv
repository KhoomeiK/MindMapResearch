SamandTolki,ff78vva,t1_ff70d7m,1579643430.0,Isn't it possible if someone wanted to to get a copy of the police report for the car accident with foia?
JusticeServed,ff2lj3p,t1_ff2kvgc,1579511824.0,I don't know about this specific show but on Judge Judy the show would pay for any judgement for their appearance.
mendrawingwomen,fezkuw9,t1_fezhpqv,1579458396.0,Still not enough bones!
ffxiv,fepux0i,t3_eq1k64,1579332181.0,"And here I thought our ""greatcommunitybtw"" could be toxic at times but apparently it doesn't hold a light to what jp does."
ffxiv,fepufz9,t1_fephgka,1579331701.0,I don't know what kind of mods they were using but there's plenty of sfw ones that improve on the base game immensely.
thisismylifenow,feocqot,t1_fennslf,1579298254.0,I used to have a pair of prescription sunglasses but the ocean took them away from me. Now I just deal with being blind.
gadgets,feob4it,t1_feo9cpx,1579297659.0,I already agree with you there. The law moves slow compared to the pace of technology. I'm just speaking to the point of a power/data cable. Of course there will be improvements there but when each manufacturer has their own standard there needs to be someway to prune it down. I didn't like digging through a drawer looking for the right type of charger/connector for my phone in the past. It was pretty overwhelming.
KingdomHearts,feo9xps,t3_eq3q9e,1579297178.0,I'm excited but not hyped. I hope the expanded story does the game justice.
gadgets,feo7xk8,t1_feo0p55,1579296328.0,"What's so bad about it though. It creates less waste, is consumer friendly, and standardized a common component."

nextfuckinglevel,feh1wga,t1_fegk8yp,1579107423.0,It was probably a gentle no. They may not have wanted to ask extra of the surgeon or to keep it professional.
StardewValley,fegz6ll,t3_eozh5g,1579105773.0,How was the algae?
halo,fegz34n,t1_fegh2t7,1579105713.0,How long are we talking? Hours?
SamandTolki,fedl0yw,t1_fedkew9,1579014154.0,Well taken from his custody at least. I thought the one kid was returned to his mother.
SamandTolki,feddf27,t1_fe22t9a,1579008384.0,What ever happened to Daddy of five after the kids were taken away?
LivestreamFail,fed96ao,t1_fecw90q,1579004340.0,Does every critic belong to the hive mind? Or just the ones who you don't like what they have to say?
pokemon,feb0x9c,t3_eo3qy7,1578954338.0,I liked how in RS the two bikes offered different terrain options for exploring. It made sure that it was always worth coming back for something new. As well as rewarding you for your current choice.
IASIP,feb05s1,t3_eo2m0n,1578954094.0,The real implication is that humanity is there before they go behind the moon and then gone after they're around it.
NintendoSwitch,feaydvg,t1_feajy41,1578953510.0,Gotta give it a year to build some history.
NintendoSwitch,feayaa0,t1_fea1h4v,1578953476.0,It would still make for a good relay speedrun though.
ffxiv,fe6oy5o,t3_enn2ss,1578898729.0,9/10 booty not big enough
depression,fe6nu6o,t3_enrs4c,1578897432.0,That's why I just don't talk about it.
anime,fe6g4ri,t1_fc6b5zs,1578889873.0,I have a feeling that Demon Lord won't be the boss of the world. For sure a major plot point though.

woof_irl,fd9bqnq,t3_ekayu7,1578231152.0,Not even fighting over it. Just trying to steer where they're going.
DnD,fd9bi7j,t3_ek91ns,1578231066.0,Such a satisfying thud at the end there.
medizzy,fd70bur,t3_ejz8m6,1578197917.0,I had to look at this a second time to realize this wasn't a hand in an Integra mitten.

SamandTolki,fcw0ub4,t1_fcvc0r4,1578014540.0,There's appetite and then there's oral fixation.
SamandTolki,fcw0cnt,t3_ej1b25,1578014220.0,It might look that way through a veil of depression and persecution. However I just want him to follow through with his weight loss. He spends too much time on the internet and in his head for his own good.
todayilearned,fcseu4y,t1_fcru3uy,1577915531.0,He also had people working with him that went on to make popular series themselves.
iamatotalpieceofshit,fcrdibb,t1_fcracq5,1577900366.0,"At least some sellers are more honest than others by labeling it ""Made in China, Assembled in USA""."
todayilearned,fckfimw,t1_fck9p4u,1577724179.0,Some people are just that opposed to change.
ffxiv,fciahv0,t1_fci9kim,1577659757.0,TP wasn't that bad. It limited AoE spam and stacking ss too high but that's about it.
halo,fci9mvk,t1_fch4enh,1577659441.0,BTB is and always will be my favorite game mode.
oddlysatisfying,fci8lal,t1_fchz782,1577659060.0,I'd probably break that in a day just from fidgeting with it.
