Having been the one cheated on, I can only give you these tips: If you are wanting to work it out with him, you need to clearly communicate what he needs to do to help you trust him again and know that it will take some time to get back to the point where you were. Forgiveness doesn't mean you trust him, but it will help you move into a better frame of mind.

We split bills (he paid some, I paid some) and groceries and things for the kids were supposed to be every other week expenses. It didn't work out that way. He didn't pay his half of the rent (we were renting a house from my parents, otherwise we'd have been homeless), we'd get notices to disconnect utilities (that he was supposed to be paying for), and I'd have to cover them. It was terrible. I have ideas where the money went, but I was never sure. Funny thing is, after we split my adult kids were still living at home and I told them they'd have to get jobs and contribute, which they did... each $200 per month. All the bills were paid, including rent, and we all had money leftover. It should've been doable with my ex.

All I can say is to support him, encourage him, and do what you can to help him feel comfortable and happy. Also, follow his cues on things. My son has always dressed fairly androgynously and I halfway expected him to start wearing more masculine clothing once he asked to be called male/he/him and also not using his birth name, but his chosen name. That wasn't the case. He still wears things that could be considered ""feminine"" as well as more masculine-style clothing. I halfway think that made the transition harder because there are still people that see him as the female and call him his dead name, but he has said he doesn't mind until he officially changes it.

That being said, OP, you're young and he is, too. I definitely agree that you should talk to your mom about her concerns. She could be afraid that you're moving too fast, getting too serious, and that he is taking advantage of you. Then again, you could be ok.

Now, I have figured out that he is probably not a full-blown narc, but definitely codependent with narcissistic tendencies. Turned out, he was treating her the way he treated me and it was all due to the influence of his mother (who also interfered in our marriage the whole time including but not limited to introducing him to women he thought were more suited to him and allowing him to cheat on me at her house). Seems the gf had gotten quite a bit of money from something and when the money was gone (of course his mother helped ""spend"" it), she decided she no longer liked his girlfriend, started a smear campaign and he was considering breaking up with her because he believed everything his mommy told him. He ended up getting in contact with me after she and I talked and not only thanked me for talking to her and apologizing for everything he did to me, but also asked my advice. I told him that he needed to stand up to his mother or he would be alone for the rest of his life. He did and his mother gave him, ""Well, it's me or her.""

Don't fall for sunk-cost fallacy. You didn't have 7 years, you had 6 before he decided it was wise to sleep with a co-worker, unprotected, and give you an STD while lying to your face about everything. 

You're only 22. You have so many years to find someone who is worthy of loving you how you should be. Don't waste them trying to convince him to love you.

Marriage,fdno0yi,t1_fdms3cw,1578589734.0,"I feel so much for you because I've been there. Married less than a year with a baby when he cheated and left. 6 months later (and for him 3 more women later), I was elated that he came back and begged me to take him back (it was actually the day we were scheduled to be in divorce court).  We were high school sweethearts, met when we were 18 and were 21 when it happened. 

That being said, I am not going to say you have to divorce him. I totally understand that this man is the one you love and have a family with, however... if you allow him back you need to make sure that he does what you need him to do in order to eventually trust him. That means he is to tell you everything you need to know without trickle-truthing you, going to couples counseling, and it may also mean that he has complete transparency and allows you to see his communications (phone, text, messaging, email...) whenever and wherever you need and, if this woman is a coworker, that he either change jobs or request a new assignment so he has no interaction with her at all. 

For me, mine didn't do any of that. He just expected me to accept his apology and vow that he would never do it again and I thought that was the only way to do it. Blind trust. What I didn't realize is that I was and am extremely codependent and that was what made me feel like I was bad if I didn't trust him automatically. I also didn't realize that the only reason he came back was because I was the only woman that would put up with his crap. But the wound festered. I suspected him of other affairs, but none were any I could prove. We got divorced after 20 more years because I lost myself so much after trying to save my marriage and my family. I didn't realize I was teaching my kids that it was ok to be in a toxic marriage (we had other issues as well that stemmed from this). 

You are so young. If he doesn't do what you need to trust him again, well, don't push it. You have plenty of time to find someone who does deserve your love and will cherish you."
