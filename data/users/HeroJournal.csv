The initial reason for making this app was to help people with chronic conditions find how various factors affected their mood and individual symptoms, and also allow people to keep everything in one place in a neat health timeline.

\- I had been tracking everything from mood and symptoms to sleep, diet, exercise, meds and supplements for a few years on Excel. I decided to put it all into the app to spot any patterns.

BearableApp,fekn38l,t3_epo98q,1579203484.0,"So one of the main feedback points I've got from testers is that it takes a bit too long to do an entry. With that in mind and considering how highly upvoted the quick check-in post got before, I've been focusing a lot of my time in trying to come up with a way to make recording much quicker for those who don't have much time.

1. Rather than a one-off entry button, it could be a Quick Check-in mode that could be permanently turned on for those who want to use it every day - it would be an overall entry for the day.
2. With the above in mind, I've made it so that every individual section turns into a kind of quick version.  I haven't worked out what to do with the food diary though (not sure how to make a quick version of that), and medication is still a bit iffy, not really sure how that will work - that's pretty quick in the normal mode already if you're copying last entries, so might not need this in quick mode.
3. I only show 5 factors per category with the option for ""showing more (...)"" as I think this is less overwhelming if you have loads of factors and you can organise it so your main ones always show first.
4. I feel like this way has a better flow to it than a quick check-in pop up.
5. I added a sleep entry to this as I think that would be pretty nice to enter quickly.

Feedback welcome!"
BearableApp,fek52jt,t1_fek4ajx,1579192774.0,"Those are just ideas for now.  

With the Food diary it's split into AM/MID/PM rather than 3 definitive ""meals"", this is so that you can add favourites based on time of the day (including snacks) for quick entry.

Also with naps would you want that to be shown separately or included in the overall sleep?   

The hard thing with naps is that with sleep you are entering your overall sleep for the night before which will obviously effect the day ahead (and reflected in your stats), but with naps you'd probably want to only show naps for the actual day in question rather than yesterday's naps.

So I decided to make my own. If you’d like to read more about how this app journey started, feel free to check out my blog post here: [https://bearable.app/blog/theoriginsofbearable/](https://bearable.app/blog/theoriginsofbearable/)

Another part of my motivation was the frustration coming out of doctor and therapist appointments with the feeling that I hadn’t been able to give them a full account of my week or month, because, well, who can remember that much in detail, especially when dealing with the stress of health issues. I felt I could never provide them with enough detail to make the best assessment possible of me, which led me on a wild goose chase from consultant to consultant and therapist to therapist…

I have been talking in a private subreddit for the last few months with people with Anxiety, Depression, Fibromyalgia, Bipolar, CFS, Crohns, MS, and other chronic conditions in an attempt to gather as many different points of view as possible.

Top of the list was to make an app that is effortless and intuitive to record into - especially given the brain fog that comes with many conditions - but still provides useful insights as to what daily activities and health factors (such as sleep, diet, exercise and medication) make people’s mood and symptoms better or worse.

I would really like to make this an App that is **made** by those that need it most, **for** those who need it most, which is why I want to listen to each and every one of you and I promise to respond to all of you.

ps. If you want to continue to give feedback and request features I also have a new public subreddit which you can find below. I really hope to see some of you there

BearableApp,fdklre1,t3_elw3vy,1578506179.0,"As you can tell with all my recent posts, I'm really trying to perfect the symptoms entry system.  I'm listening to all of your feedback with each post, hence why I keep coming up with new designs until I get a certain level of positive agreement.

Out of all the recent posts I've made, I think I'm leaning most towards this, so here's an explanation as to why:

&#x200B;

**Why would this be good?**

\- For those people who want to be able to enter severities into more than one period at once, this solves that issue, as you could just use two or 3 fingers to press separate periods together.

\- From a user experience point of view it's makes everything flow much better, no need for separate screens or pop-ups. The instant response is nice I think.

\- Consistency with factors section (with time periods toggle)

\- Currently if you press a specific symptom's time period square, it won't scroll to that period on the entry page, so it would solve this issue.

\- With the overall entry possible too, people who just want to enter once can now do that, and then even edit individual time periods afterwards with the toggle.

\- Saves you from clicking individual symptoms and then having to enter into a pop-up.

\- The ""mark none for remaining"" button makes more sense here, as it would be for all remaining periods, making the stats potentially more accurate.  Also now there's an undo option for this.

\- I generally think this will make entering symptoms feel like less of a chore

\- Ability to write notes for each symptom rather than overall for the day. This also means my future idea to have ""triggers/what helps"" buttons for each symptom would also become a lot easier.

&#x200B;

**Drawbacks:**

\- You'd need 3 clicks for severe, but I actually think overall this method would be quicker, as it's not like it's a slow click taking you to another page, it could be 1 second of 3 quick clicks."

""You should farm karma on Reddit"""
BearableApp,fdhnsdu,t1_fdhmr9k,1578426558.0,"Yeah the only issue with that is that I'm not sure how I would be able to show the 4 little bar charts symptoms overview of the day, which people like, as it would just be a selection of pressable symptom levels like we currently have on the separate page"
BearableApp,fdhkeq0,t1_fdh9oq1,1578424517.0,"So would you prefer it if I made the time periods part like what we currently have on a separate page?  I.e. you'd still be on the homepage symptoms section, but if you clicked a time period it would show pre, am, mid, pm clickable at the top and you could have all symptoms ready to be rated instantly."
BearableApp,fdh8nlw,t3_elehnj,1578417776.0,"After your feedback I thought this might be a kind of useful inbetween to have when you don't want to just click an overall symptom level for the day, but want something a bit more flexible if you had a symptom over more than one period.

This could be nice and quick even if it's just for one period, as you wouldn't have to confirm, it would just be one click to open and another to click the symptom level.

Also we have added these nice little fill animations (i.e. the bar level rising) to make entry a bit more satisfying."

BearableApp,fdf7r9o,t1_fdeuw2e,1578355268.0,"What do you think about just adding ""general/overall pain"" as a symptom?  I know this doesn't have the 1-10, but could still have some use perhaps, especially if you don't want to enter all symptoms"
BearableApp,fdf7mqi,t1_fdf27m2,1578355184.0,"Thanks for explaining, that makes sense why you'd want that.  It would also be nice to have an overall pain level in the calendar.  Something definitely worth considering.  Have you tried just making a symptom called ""overall pain"" and just entering that? Or is it not useful because it's not 1-10 like your used to?"

BearableApp,fdeck75,t1_fdeatkq,1578336060.0,"Thanks, I see what you mean. 

It would be nice to have 0-10 but then I can't have groups of 2 for each mood icon (necessary way of doing things when you already have colour palette that's too big!) and it's also more excessive for the people who feel 1-10 is already too many options.  

This is a tougher choice than I expected as everyone seems to have a different opinion!"
