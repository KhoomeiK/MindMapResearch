insomnia,fel8wu0,t1_fej5uen,1579216619.0,"Thanks for the pointers. I tend to normally do that to be honest , but this was a totally different feeling with the insomnia. You may see it in an earlier reply but the service was amazing and a lot of people gave my grandfather so much praise . It really made me proud  to be his grandson and helped put my mind at ease ."
insomnia,fel8oxk,t3_epfk76,1579216478.0,Thatâ€™s really a great way of thinking about it. I think with me it was just the weight of the upcoming funeral that gave me little to no sleep.  Iâ€™ll be honest it was an amazing funeral and a lot of people spoke incredibly high of my grandfather. So now knowing all those kind words and seeing how much he meant to everyone else will help put my mind at ease and allow me to sleep
insomnia,fej5qhu,t1_fej5grt,1579157977.0,"Yeah Iâ€™m with my folks and my brother( all passed out) so Iâ€™m not alone . Also with no tv in my room, Iâ€™m just trying to find an article or something on my phone to put me at ease. Tomorrow is the actual funeral so Iâ€™m not out of the storm yet .  

I guess Iâ€™m just hoping I made him proud :)


Sorry for your loss and I hope you found peace during your difficult time as well ."
SuicideWatch,feel2w2,t1_feegpjd,1579035930.0,"Thanks. Yea I know heâ€™ll always be there I did get my send of humor and pride of my Irish heritage from him.  Itâ€™s strange the night he passed , I could have sworn I felt someone holding my hand  when I was falling asleep ..."

SuicideWatch,fe8xoel,t3_enx1qf,1578932111.0,"Update: he passed away overnight.  It will be rough going up to the funeral, but at least I k ow heâ€™s in a better place and pain free ."
minnesotavikings,fe6cta8,t3_enu599,1578887187.0,Heâ€™ll be one and done in brown town for sure ðŸ˜…
SuicideWatch,fe6cpwk,t3_enx1qf,1578887115.0,"Thank you.  Itâ€™s been a rough few years and I knew this was coming sooner or later . He is 94 and thatâ€™s quite the milestone in itself. It just a pain since he nor my grandma will get to see me have a wife and kids like all my other cousins and my brother who have their stuff all together. I just want them to see that I was successful , ya know ?"
SuicideWatch,fduvaxo,t3_en3mit,1578739412.0,"Iâ€™m right there with you . Iâ€™ve been single for god knows how long ( flings here and there) yet I want the end of the rainbow.

Hydrocephalus,fdfr4qg,t3_ehz6ei,1578368181.0,"No, itâ€™s just general anxiety for me ( basically just worrying about stupid stuff and over thinking . 98% of the time I donâ€™t even notice my shunt."

insomnia,fcnidcy,t1_fcnc02u,1577812309.0,"Yeah, my New Years resolution isnâ€™t to get into a routine where I can work out in the morning . I do tend to wind down till about 11 eating dinner and watching some tv, but the Iâ€™m still full blown awake"
Hydrocephalus,fcni63r,t1_fcngg9p,1577812202.0,Iâ€™ve been there before and I always wondered what was actually going on and I did a school project back in highschool and found out about the whole anxiety and depression side. So Iâ€™ve watched that closely
Hydrocephalus,fcmhfwm,t3_ehz6ei,1577775403.0,Hahaha my tv is in the living room and I love my bed too much. Tea would be a great idea though. I need to get back into that stuff :)
SuicideWatch,fbzpubo,t3_efd3cz,1577255632.0,Reach out to those who love you. If you canâ€™t bring yourself to do that( like me) find something youâ€™re passionate about and engulf yourself in that so it brings you happiness and a new outlook. Iâ€™ve been doing it for a hot minute and I feel pretty good.
minnesotavikings,fbx8srt,t3_eey7wd,1577174589.0,"Yeah I was really just wanting to keep this records going , but I know itâ€™s just one game. Iâ€™ve said it once and Iâ€™ll say it again : Iâ€™ll bleed purple and gold till I die.  Letâ€™s rest everyone up and come back fully healthy to take on whoever we need to in order to make a strong run in the playoffs. SKOL!"
