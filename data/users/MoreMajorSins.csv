specializedtools,ff83jsz,t1_ff7q6kn,1579665043.0,I got shot through the hand and through the thigh by a 9mm and waited for 2 hours in the ER hallway. A nurse came out every so often to change the gauze she taped to my wounds while I waited at least.
todayilearned,fe81r1u,t1_fe6ctj0,1578921449.0,Yeah. The memorial is across the street

todayilearned,fe69oze,t1_fe694ua,1578884901.0,I’m doing fucking awesome! Married to an amazing woman working a job I like with a pretty active social life. Still trying to quit drinking though . I’m 12 days sober now.
todayilearned,fe69bja,t1_fe68zhy,1578884643.0,My wife and I split up in October (3 months earlier) and I spent most of my waking hours drunk. It eventually caught up with me and my work performance was terrible. I was a warehouse supervisor and my schedule was 4 ten hour shifts that started at 5am.
todayilearned,fe68zh2,t1_fe68ppw,1578884416.0,"It is. My wife and I split up 3 months earlier (my depression from that is essentially why I got fired) and I broke down and called her that day. Man, 15 years ago and it feels like yesterday."
todayilearned,fe673ma,t1_fe66j63,1578883270.0,I’m much better. Thanks.
todayilearned,fe634wl,t1_fe5sdei,1578880718.0,"I remember this well. I lived a few blocks from where it happened. I got fired from a job in East L.A. that morning and got stuck in traffic from this on my way home. It was a very depressing day all around.

There is a memorial next tot the storage place on Los Feliz."
orangecounty,fcwr2ah,t3_ejax47,1578034243.0,"I’ve had a very similar experience. The whole “couple mentors” even. I also had a similar experience at a Barnes and Noble where a young girl complimented the book I was reading and then started telling me how happy she has been lately. Before I knew it, she was inviting me to Saddleback church."
AskReddit,fbi27ic,t1_fbi1uq0,1576888682.0,Thats not true. The Democrats have passed almost 400 bills in 2019. The Republicans are ignoring them in order to make it look like they havent been busy.
