todayilearned,fehoou4,t1_fehe6n6,1579120811.0,"Converse Chucks used to last 5 years or more of daily wear.  Since they got bought by Nike, I might get a year out of a pair. :("
DivinityOriginalSin,fegr5pg,t1_fefsk2f,1579100599.0,"I shouldn't have started with the insults, my apologies.  I was feisty last night.  Anyhow, my point is that all of the other resources, including man hours and fuel and the emissions from said fuel add in to the cost of a rock.  Yes, there are a lot of rocks on this planet, but everything we have is finite.  Everyone thought helium was so bountiful we could just pump it into balloons for every event.  Now, it's so cost-prohibitive to do that you have to be fairly wealthy to have helium balloons if you can find a place that even has helium to sell."
DivinityOriginalSin,fefrdyc,t1_fefna1y,1579062992.0,"Factor in the resources required to mine it, ship it, carve it and place it, and it's more than a rock. Not a hard concept to grasp. For real though, I hope you're just trolling and not this daft."
DivinityOriginalSin,fefmdwj,t1_fefgwzb,1579059450.0,Using a rock for something I personally do not want would be a waste. Don't be a dumbass.
DivinityOriginalSin,fefgmtc,t1_fefezbx,1579055911.0,It doesn't spit them out in rectangular carved pieces.
DivinityOriginalSin,fedxwc7,t1_fedi4yb,1579022209.0,Planting a sapling on top gives the mourners something to visit without wasting stone for a headstone. I have told my wife that if I can't have a viking funeral this is what I want.

todayilearned,fcuu9lr,t1_fcussqa,1577988627.0,"You can hop on the civ subreddit and get a game organized on the discord, but you may want to wait until you have a better grasp on the game. 

Zigzagzigal (sp?) Has some amazing guides for each civ on Steam. There are quite a few YouTubers out there with good tutorials and play throughs. Saxy Gamer and Potato McWhiskey being my go-to's.

Have fun and welcome to ""ehhhh, just one more then and I'll go to bed,"" club."

gaming,fbvo5rg,t1_fbvd4du,1577133634.0,"Lol a shill? Nah, just someone who thinks people should deal with the consequences of their actions and not get do-overs for poor decisions. Not to mention he shit on the games for a long time until The Witcher 3 exploded and made money hand over fist.

The old coot made more money from the games than that original lump sum anyhow. I know many people who bought the books after playing the games."
