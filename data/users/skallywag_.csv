Nor did they trust some yahoo at the DMV or the basketball coach at my High School teaching drivers ed as a pass to coach JV sports. I was doing it by 13. I was self taught/taught by the very people who would’ve actually gave a rats ass if I I died. Those people also learned from people who felt the same way  about them before we felt like we were smart enough to ‘standardize’ drivers education. At some point people need to start understanding that your offspring are your responsibility, not societies."
changemyview,fdlteek,t1_fdlgpif,1578532053.0,"Don’t cherry pick the Bible. You might want to finish that Romans passage that you started but conveniently managed to not finish  - I’ll finish it for you... ‘Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error’..the last part of Romans 1:27. Not gonna argue in favor of your view point or not just hate to see people cherry pick information from scripture to mold their view point.

Edit: to your last point the Bible only speaking of marriage as man and woman - if I say the sky is blue and you say ‘well you didn’t explicitly say it wasn’t black’ is like trying to argue with an adolescent child. You’re avoiding the fact someone told you it was blue and you’re countering with ‘well, yea, but you didn’t say it wasn’t’.... You’re absolutely right I didn’t say it wasn’t black because I told you upfront it was blue. Black was never an option."
YouShouldKnow,fdcmt3b,t1_fdc4ejj,1578278806.0,"Bitter, not so much. I could care less how you ‘feel’ about lifted vehicles. Your feelings are a you problem. I’m still tackling to correlation between lifted vehicles and the blatant disregard for humanity and how the two seamlessly influence the other. When you solve that one let me know and I’ll note it, Good Samaritan."
YouShouldKnow,fdcmfch,t1_fdake48,1578278536.0,"Insecurity? Lol. Me buying parts for a vehicle has zero correlation with my view on human existence or my fucks given for said humans. I mean...we’re seriously going to gauge the fucks given for human existence on truck parts? What are you mad about?

By the way, if it makes you feel better, my headlights are aligned properly and I own zero light bars."
YouShouldKnow,fda8odj,t1_fd7m0tz,1578243063.0,Yea my lifted truck totally means I hate everyone and give zero fucks for everyone around me. Because that’s logical.
changemyview,fc4j6of,t3_efz6vg,1577418206.0,"Im not changing your mind but I’m jumping on the mic. I love these topics. So much variance yet the logic never changes no matter how much people try to validate the non sense that is borrowing money for a depreciating asset. 

If you can’t pay cash for it, you can’t afford it - outside of your typical mortgage. You’re not gonna convince anyone with logic otherwise. People didn’t build financial wealth and independence by buying (financing) cars they couldn’t afford. Now, you’re gonna say no one has 30k laying around to buy a new car!’. You’re probably right. Which means the vast majority of people need to down size their reality of car ownership because spending 30+k on a car with money you don’t have is ridiculous. Especially knowing that a car is a depreciating waste of time and money in 2019. Sure, your all original, serial matching Camaro from 69’ that’s sitting in your uncles shop holds value 50 years later but they were a limited run of vehicles. Not the mass produced 2019 50k Camaro they sell today at every Chevy dealership in your local area. Get real. 

I get so sick of this topic yet it so fun to talk to about. Who are you flexing for? Why do you want a shiny car? Is owing money on that new car getting you ahead? Is it adding value to your life? Think about it. Take 5-7k as buy yourself a decent car. Nothing special. Just something get to work with. Then take your what would be car payment on a 35k car and stick in a mutual fund over the life of the typical auto loan (you were gonna spend it anyways don’t act like you can’t budget for it). Whatcha got? Assuming total hypotheticals but very realistic returns, $350 a month (drastically less than a month to payment on a 35k car assuming your down payment wasn’t massive) over 5 years at an average of 8% is roughly 22-25K in a mutual fund. 

Don’t buy a new car. Save a little money, get you something you can roll down the road with for 5-8 years, and invest your what would be car payment. Boom, all of the sudden the what would be waste of money is a strong investment and it’s like you never felt it. You were gonna spend the $350+ a month anyways right?

No one likes to be weird. And being weird with money is doing what no one else is doing. And what everyone else is doing is financing cars for 30k+ like it’s the right thing to do."

RaidShadowLegends,fc4bmlz,t3_eg204f,1577411986.0,Smallest QoL requests but I have to agree. Like the old storage in PokÃ©mon. Different files or whatever.
RaidShadowLegends,fb8zij6,t3_ebzcmy,1576625576.0,"My issue is the same as yours on the surface. Itâ€™s a bait and switch thing. I was going strong on the fusion until I saw the rumors of a possible nerf and Iâ€™m not gonna invest anymore. Heâ€™s broken and itâ€™s obvious or they wouldnâ€™t be talking about it. 

My main issue is this. They clearly didnâ€™t test his kit. If they did they wouldnâ€™t be back pedaling now. Theyâ€™re so heavily committed to churning out these fusions and new characters because people are spending out the rear end to get them, that theyâ€™re not even paying attention to the actual game play. So hell bent to get the next cash grab launched that they arenâ€™t even checking the viability of it. Itâ€™s insane. And people continue to spend. Itâ€™s mind blowing. Iâ€™m not gonna bitch about it to the point where it gets nauseating because itâ€™s obvious the whales in this community are clearly doing what whales do best so this behavior from plarium isnâ€™t likely to change. Power to em I guess. But itâ€™s so crazy that people are over looking the obvious issues with this game and development and yet theyâ€™re still spending crazy amounts to play."
