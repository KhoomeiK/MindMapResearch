Indy has to gain his trust and respect while overcoming obstacles and equipping the young man to face a high-stakes ultimatum of some sort. Indy is by his side as a guide and mentor until, when the plot seems like it can't get any tenser, he finds that his skills are no longer adequate. The son has to go the final part of the journey alone.

You should subscribe to his emails. They're written as though they're personal messages from Trump to each and every follower. I don't doubt that many actually believe that's the case. They have no inkling how such a process could be automated. It's not for naught that Republicans have been assiduously working to create an undereducated populace.
