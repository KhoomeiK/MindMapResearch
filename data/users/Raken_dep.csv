aww,fdq36ai,t1_fdpykqj,1578652601.0,"As far as ik, there are a few varieties of trees that do start fires due to friction between their twigs/branches although such friction caused fires are very very rare, as ive said in my comment above.
Bamboo being an example that have started such fires in the Amazon and in quite a few places in India."
aww,fdprbdx,t1_fdpp0wr,1578637522.0,"Its started by either arsonists (people who deliberately start fires), or, due to the dry lightning (lightning that strikes without rains), or, on some rare occasions, due to the brushing/grinding of the branches of the dried up trees due to the wind which can cause embers easier than usual due to the extreme temperatures and eventually the tree/s catch fire and then the strong dry winds blow these flames towards the trees in the vicinity of the burning ones. Once the fire starts it then comes down to a cycle of 

1. trees burning, causing smoke.

2. This smoke is accompanied by the water vapour. The water from the soil and the trees themselves starts evaporating due to the high temperatures that were already there before the fire started, but the high temperatures due to the fires increase this evaporation multifolds.

3. This smoke then goes up into the sky and forms clouds. And once enough of this water vapor is accumulated in the smoke clouds and the clouds reach a higher altitude, the water vapor condenses. Thus, untimely rains are caused

4. Rainfall accompanied with usual lightning. These clouds are drifted to other places by the strong winds

5. After a point, the rain stops as the clouds have really less or no water content left in them, but the clouds are still up there in the sky.

6. And these clouds, then, might cause lightnings and such lightning, (without the presence of rain) is called dry lightning. Keeping in mind that the clouds have drifted to some other place due to the winds, these dry lightnings might now hit the trees in some other places, thus starting a fire in a new place.

And, thus the cycle might continue for unpredictable durations"

gifs,fdjpmpl,t1_fdjhzv8,1578482439.0,"Idk why so many comments here are having connotations of blaming ""only climate change"".
No, climate change might well be a part of the reason all of this is happening is what I'm saying. And yes, climate change is a really complex thing to fathom in its entirety. But denial of climate change is what im saying is what needs to stop. Accepting the fact that we humans have the potential to do things that can affect and catalyse the climate change and accepting that things have been done by humans that have altered the ecology of vast geographical regions in the past is at the crux of climate change. Im not an activist, im not brainwashed by the propaganda side of climate change, no.

[There are things like these that are happening, and whats alarming about it is that the frequencies of these fires have increased due to this feedback cycle](https://www.vox.com/platform/amp/2019/12/30/21039298/40-celsius-australia-fires-2019-heatwave-climate-change)

And about the link that was about the VFFA, yes thanks for that and I'm glad to be more informed about the perspective of the volunteer firefighters who have been doing all the ground zero work, and hence, they definitely are a reliable source. But just like the reason they have put forward, there are genuine and rational scientists and meteorologists out there who are trying to inform the world about the patterns and developments with as much material and scientifically sound proof as they can, and they need to be heard too. 

[Here's a brief given by the BOM of Australia regarding the bushfires](http://www.bom.gov.au/weather-services/fire-weather-centre/bushfire-weather/index.shtml)
>There have been significant changes observed in recent decades towards more dangerous bushfire weather conditions for various regions of Australia. In particular, observed changes in southern and eastern Australia include more extreme conditions during summer, as well as an earlier start to the bushfire season with dangerous weather conditions occurring significantly earlier in spring than they used to. These trends towards more dangerous bushfire conditions are at least partly attributable to human-caused climate change, including through increased temperatures.

Its not about blaming it entirely on climate change only, its about acknowledging that humans have catalysed and still are catalysing the climate change to some significant extent, if not to a large extent. And I am of the opinion that the denial of it is gradually, if not rapidly, going to make things worse, just like it has been happening for years now."
gifs,fdj0f6d,t1_fdimmn2,1578455279.0,"As ive replied to a similar comment above

I will never deny that people might also have started fires in some places, but are you going to deny that the temperatures reaching 50°C in these dry woodlands don't have the potential to start a fire and then spread to vast extents? Are you going to completely deny that these people who started the fires might have started the fires only because they saw the wildfires starting naturally and then decided to take advantage of the situation and go on to do the shit they did. And btw, if humans and their actions of setting such fires can lead to catastrophic consequences like the one we're seeing now, where the smoke of the fires set off by some people is covering almost an entire continent, then atleast i personally would not hesitate in admitting that humans have the potential to cause climate change.

Is the world supposed to see stuff like this happening every other day to accept that its got something to do with climate change and that humans are indeed pushing and causing and contributing to this climate change and making it worse.
Do you know that these devastating wildfires that blazed at the end of December have been a part and a consequence of a feedback loop of the relatively smaller bushfires that have been happening since September? Do you know that meteorologists are fearing one more set of wildfires by the end of the week after the rain stops, due to this whole cycle of bushfires, rains, thunder, and then dry thunder (thunder without rain) which is what has set off these wildfires, along with these 20 arsonists that your incompetent leaders are entirely pinning it on now?"

And I have been feeling and believing more in the reality of the irreversible climate change unfolding when a recent study by an advanced satellite corrected previous estimates that the city i live in will drown into the sea by 2100 to 2050. And seeing how things are unfolding elsewhere in the world (these wildfires, the permafrost melting in Siberia and releasing deadly bacteria and insects that were literally ""cold storaged and quarantined"" in there, the huge Antarctica shelf, that's twice the size of the Manhattan island, cracking away from the mainland Antarctica and so much of other shit), it feels absolutely weird to accept the possibility that these things might happen in the near future, in our future, and not in some distant generation's future! :')"

But half a billion of these helpless animals and wildlife have been declared dead. 
HALF A BILLION! That number just sends a shiver down my spine! This whole wildfire seems like a small glimpse of how catastrophic the denial of climate change is going to prove."
Astronomy,fd4dzv8,t1_fd31a3a,1578166743.0,">Since there is no sound to hear we instead use computers to detect gravitational waves

But isnt it true that gravitational waves are hard to detect. As far as i know, the LIGO which has been used to detect gravitational waves, has detected them on very rare occasions and for really really small instances? Im not well informed about them being detected and recorded to an extent where they can be used for converting them to sound waves using computers.

If so, that's really interesting. Detecting gravity waves for larger durations can prove to be a huge step in decoding space and time mysteries that still elude scientists!

soccer,fd18bvf,t1_f72x8it,1578128500.0,Iniesta is Laudrup's beta version
soccer,fd170ts,t1_f6yzna0,1578128157.0,"Along with watching videos, there's one more thing you'll have to do to do understand how great he was as a player and to understand that there's no harm in calling him the best attacking player and the best playmaker. And that thing is: Read and research. So if you do have time, READ about this man and look at what some lf the legends of this game have said about him.

Just to give you an example.
Johan Cruyff, who has been called by professional players of multiple generations as one of the best players, and also is well known for being a blunt and hard critic of the game and who's footballing iq and philosophy has been held in high regards by the world of football, has said things like these about him.

“One of the most difficult players I have worked with. When he gives 80–90% he is still by far the best, but I want 100%, and he rarely does that.”

“When Michael plays like a dream, a magic illusion, determined to show his new team his extreme abilities, no one in the world comes anywhere near his level.”

These are just two of the multiple quotes highlighting Laudrup's brilliance. Cruyff, Platini, Iniesta, Romario, Beckenbauer, Koeman, Baggio, Raul, Thierry Henry, Pep Guardiola, David Silva...all of these players have said some unbelievable things about Laudrup. Now you and me, we've never been pros so our opinions on how good a player is can be flawed. But when a myriad of top quality pros like the ones i mentioned up there say the kind of amazing things they've said about Laudrup, that's where things become believable.
