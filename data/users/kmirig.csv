MakeupAddiction,fepc0bh,t3_eq0hgg,1579316823.0,"Pale, blond, and dark brows here. I embrace it. However, for a while I was filling in my brows with a Benefit #5 pencil and a #3 gel. Both shades were neutral enough and didn’t pull warm on me so it worked for me. I think it has some to do with under tones."
MakeupAddiction,fepbp2p,t3_eq5eog,1579316611.0,"I’m a super oily person. Like oily oily. Something that I’ve switched to doing is making sure my skin is hydrated. Hydrated skin tends to produce less oil because it’s not over compensating. I use niacinamide, a hyaluronic acid, and a light weight moisturizer. The  niacinamide helps with the look of pores and reducing oil production. The hyaluronic acid is a humectant (basically a moisture magnet) keeps me moisturized all day. 

The biggest change to my makeup though is switching from super super matte products. I looked like a powdery/cakey mess. Yes, I was matte all day but I looked gross and it clogged my pores big time. Switching to less drying products might mean I’m oily at the end of the day, but honestly my skin looks better. I’m a flight attendant so this is a tried and true tested method. I have to blot through the day but like I still look good 12 hours later."

cancer,fdy6t08,t3_enb1p7,1578776681.0,"My dad was on an extremely high dose of prednisone while I was in my late teens/early 20s  (medical condition not related to cancer) sometimes you just have to beat them at their own game. Starting an argument over something petty? Agree and walk away. Sometimes walking away and cutting the tension is the best thing to do. Don’t get swept up into the abuse. It’s hard for both of you and the medicine isn’t making it any better. 

But a more proactive measure is for the both of you to start therapy. Not necessarily together. Also support groups can be super helpful as well."
flightattendants,fdy5qeh,t3_enbni6,1578776397.0,"You just learn to embrace the chaos. Plus when you get back to the galley you can complain about how much somebody or something is testing your patience. 

But at the end of the day you know it’s nothing in comparison to trying to beat the timer with a fire or having to administer medical care."
