todayilearned,ff546me,t1_ff52vt0,1579579746.0,"Leave your personal beliefs out of this. You can neither prove or disprove the existence of God, spirits, or other things. You can believe none of it is important all you want, billions of people do believe in this stuff and it is not your place to tell them they are wrong and that spirits, in the context of a human spirit, are bogus. Just as much as why I cannot tell you you’re wrong. I’m just stating why religious institutions will never be taxed in America so long as the separation of church and state exists. 

Also I’m not going to argue what a hobby is, but religion is not."

worldnews,ff52j8x,t1_ff32t76,1579578474.0,Wait does this mean life starts over from scratch or did we have an auto-save.
todayilearned,ff50crw,t1_ff4uvig,1579576843.0,"Well since America does the majority of spending it stands that they would need to spend less.

Edit: To clarify I don’t believe America should be spending less on Military spending, having to out spend Russia and China, and to stay ahead of both of them is very important for world security.  And anyone who disagrees take a look and Ukraine and the Nine Dash Line. Both nations don’t give a shit about human rights and could care less about over running another nation if it could better line their pockets. Also some might say that America is just as bad. But it’s been over a century since America forced another nation to give them territory, Russia has in the last 5 years and China is completely fine throwing  its military around to get what it wants)."
todayilearned,ff4zlb1,t1_ff4wspv,1579576284.0,"Again bad precedent. Who’s to say what’s charity and what’s not? Pastors and Priests of Christian faiths have no other jobs, so they have no way of getting a wage since leading a congregation is a job in an of itself. They couldn’t afford to be full time spiritual guides. Now you and many other people may not believe that humans have a Spirit to tend to, but millions of people do. 

Who gets to make the decision on what is considered charity and not? 

Also some of these places have really good lawyers, *cough* Scientology *cough*. And I’m sure they can save most of their money from being taxed. 

Now some might say well we all know certain religions are shams, which is certainly true. However at least in America there is the separation of church and state, meaning the government needs to stay out of matters of religion, and religion needs to stay out of politics. And that is why it will never be put into place in America, Uncle Sam gets his taxes and the churches, temples, etc get their donation.

People who donate/tithe expect it to be used on all sorts or things, since ministers need to be paid, this may lead to more money being given to them to compensate for this, which may mean less money to charities. 

Plus how is the tax decided? You want to let charity donation to be exempt, cool, so do religions now have to state how much is going to be donated first? And then they can decide how much they have to pay the electric bill, or the tap?"

HistoryMemes,fewm6vr,t1_few2eu1,1579414353.0,"Why does everybody keep talking about shit they don’t understand. Why wouldn’t the Republicans want to allow Puerto Rico to join, the local house and senate are currently controlled by three-fourths majority of the PNP, which is Republican supported. Also it controls the Governor and the seat of the commissioner. If they become a State right now they would support the Republicans. If anything it would be Democrats who wouldn’t want them to join. 

This is all very easily found by a google search or going to Wikipedia."

eu4,fe3mo11,t1_fe1zvc3,1578850694.0,Well RM is the only way I know to officially to spread “your” dynasty. I had a recent game as France were I got a PU over Sweden and within a hundred or so years Muscovy lost its King and I successfully forced a PU on them against Lithuania. I didn’t even have a RM with them or anything. From everything I know the best way to form a PU is keep your prestige really high and have a RM with a nation you want to PU. Or in the case with Muscovy have high Development and high prestige. At least I’m pretty sure that’s why I was allowed to fight for PU over Muscovy.
