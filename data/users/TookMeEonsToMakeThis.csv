AskReddit,ff8pbba,t1_fem4kcl,1579690165.0,"Similar thing here but less horrible.

My grandpa (moms side, dead now) may have made some woman pregnant in the 50-60-70s (I really have no clue when exacly) and thus my mom and uncle may have a half sibling somewhere in the world that we may know the name of? Never met him thougth.

And my grandpa (dads side, alive) may have cheated with other women while married tk my grandma. I understand it as she is controlling and talks so much so he has basically forgotten how to speak... I wish I was kidding but the man can mumble a bit and laugh. He also has dementia of some sort and that doesn't help really with his speaking problems. 

I heard this from my mom like a week ago or so and I got surprised. Grandpa is really kind, but also very quiet and well isolated due to his babbeling wife..."

AskReddit,ff8nqum,t1_ff2vex5,1579687809.0,"Same in sweden. Bad pay, barly anyone who likes or cares about elders can work for them because its so bad pay. Same with people who help at old peoples homes. My grandma had to move 650km at age 89 to get into a better home where we could look after her regulary, so ya know, she didnt live in the same daiper for 2 week and ate once a week... 

Now my grandparents on dads side have elder care at home and they are better then most, but may have stolen things from them... 

Like I get it. Working for a pay that bad and not having the ability to get another job due to being an imigrant or bad grades can turn you into a desperate person that steals to get food on the table."

But after like 3, 4 or 5 or so tries it should look better and better. Also don't remove the old builds, always good too see what you came from so you can aleays go back to it if you want to remake another city.

I often buil trees and such (not much else tbh lol) and it takes like 10 or so trees bere for looks good.

So just give it a try, take a break if you need then grt back to it and try some more. There is no shame in starting over :)"
