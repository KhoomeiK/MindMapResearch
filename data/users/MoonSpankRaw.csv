 But still. It’s pretty unbecoming to behave like you are."

That’s the first time I ever got something SPOILED to me- I had JUST bought the book (my mom bought it, really— I was maybe 9 or 10).  First day at school with it, kid walks up to me and says I read that! Blah blah blah happens!

I raged when I got home and started defacing his picture in previous yearbooks and class pics. 

...that showed him."

Having said that, I thought ep 1 was great and can stack with any earlier season ep, but the 2nd had a little too much forced in there, as others are stating.

Still definitely better than first two eps last season, too."
