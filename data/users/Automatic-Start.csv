AskReddit,fcw2ggs,t1_fcvw1ua,1578015600.0,"Yes indeed. People aren’t repeating this because they heard a superstition somewhere, they’re warning you from personal experience. I could tell my own horror story. Someday the debunk will be debunked."
getdisciplined,fcujf9h,t3_eizreu,1577982367.0,"I can see how this would be true for people, but this is literally one of my favorite things to do. It drives me insane not to have time to be alone with my thoughts."
AskReddit,fcubpvk,t3_eipzwh,1577977245.0,"I see TOO MANY double digits all the time.

I know about selective memory. I know about superstitious pattern psychology. I’m a skeptic about this stuff. I sat down and worked it out - you will see double or triple digits on the clock approximately 16% of the time (*iirc). But when I see it happen, it’s seriously 99% of the time. To where I get resigned to it. I refuse to believe it’s actually 100% of the time.

And there are times where this pattern just stops. I’ll go months without seeing a double digit. But then it starts up again, for an indefinite number of days. I’ll know that if I look at a clock again, it will be some multiple of 11 minutes or 1:11 later.

If you look this up on the internet, you will find a bunch of BS about guardian angels. There is no evidence for this; it’s just pure wishful thinking. They’re numbers.

But it makes me question if reality is somewhat of a different structure than I’ve been led to believe. What structure, I don’t know. Dreamlike idealism? The matrix? The Cause and Effect episode of ST:TNG?"

Enjoy!"

AskReddit,fcrs38q,t1_fcqi5b3,1577905867.0,I remain silent and everyone gets uncomfortably self-conscious and shifts topic.
AskReddit,fcqlk6a,t1_fcpnjpl,1577888150.0,This is such a universal thing I’ve wondered if it’s genetically hardwired in humans.
AskReddit,fcp9wrm,t1_fcoaxlf,1577855568.0,"Do you see how you keep stretching to uphold the standard narrative?

Remember, this was a discussion about brainwashing."
AskReddit,fcnzjes,t1_fcni597,1577821400.0,"That is called a strawman argument - making up a position your opponent did not take so you can pretend to knock it down.

If it were common knowledge that every person of demographic X peacefully encouraged gun ownership for themselves and all of their neighbors, what would happen to unprovoked police shootings of demographic X?

But instead the push is to remove this option and leave only police with guns."
AskReddit,fcne3z7,t1_fcn95ok,1577809800.0,"The purpose of the 2nd amendment is to stand up to corrupt government bullying, which is exactly what they’re complaining about. But the programming says to vote against their best interests."
AskReddit,fcn5ria,t1_fclqmkq,1577804001.0,"Do you think there would be a BLM movement if the protesters believed in the 2nd amendment?

(I wasn’t the one who downvoted you, fwiw.)"
AskReddit,fclq34p,t1_fcl7281,1577753721.0,"Don’t forget, you have also developed your opinions on equality and its enemies by listening to media stories. No one is immune."

getdisciplined,fch2qho,t1_fce62uk,1577646748.0,"Put it on your home screen. First thing you see every day. Plus, you’ll end up mindlessly clicking it to fill the time, same as with a social media icon.

With the way phones are indispensable, most people will be guaranteed to always carry that list on their person.

Edit: Guess I should add, I also have a memory issue and Trello is a godsend. I maintain lists for many categories of my life."

AskReddit,fbysx69,t1_fbxvv20,1577225465.0,"Sounds like the original point was about supply and demand, which of course makes sense in nature."
getdisciplined,fbyfxp5,t1_fbwx1d7,1577215909.0,"Can you verify that choice even exists? Sure, people talk about the concept - but what does this supposed choice thing LOOK like in reality? If people do it all day, it should be easy and obvious to point at the moment a decision is made. This doesn’t involve anyone giving up anything; it’s simple honest observation. Dont talk about it... try it! :)"
getdisciplined,fbuhca5,t1_fbugc2t,1577114414.0,"It is upsetting if you don’t follow through to the end and look for the person choosing, as well."
