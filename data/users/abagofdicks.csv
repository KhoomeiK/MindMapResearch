saltierthancrait,ff21jdy,t1_ff1xa6u,1579491301.0,Yeah. He could’ve started to broadcast some sort of signal from the island instead of just randomly booting up and projecting the map
JoeRogan,fewpwg0,t1_fewn3do,1579417721.0,I’d be interested to see what he’s like just bullshitting without Sports Drama to yell about
Showerthoughts,fewoslu,t3_eqsgx5,1579417213.0,No way. Someone would buy that in a heartbeat.

audio,feps5jx,t1_fepr8s0,1579329433.0,It should sound great if you have it pretty close to your mic. I don’t think it’ll sound too bad if you have some distance on it it either. As long as your room isn’t loud.

livesound,fegsk2y,t1_fegs3jd,1579101549.0,I’m sure it goes down to below 50 with the subs. I’d just guess the 100-200 range will build up in a less pleasant way.

movies,fdnsp3y,t1_fdnskcp,1578592055.0,True. I guess also the Burton films happen in a Wonderland version of Gotham so there isn’t much 90s aesthetic about it other than some vehicles.
movies,fdnsf23,t1_fdnn470,1578591894.0,Ugh. We already have a 90s Batman
movies,fdmla1c,t1_fdmktyq,1578554187.0,Yeah. She didn’t have much to work with besides screaming. That character was just as awful as her boyfriend. They should’ve had her embracing everything as soon as they got there. Or given her some like-able qualities. I don’t buy her feeling like she found family or anything at the end. Surprised the director of this gets so much praise. It was pretty bad overall.
movies,fdmkrmz,t3_edx1zc,1578553600.0,"I liked the idea and look but the core plot and script is awful. These people have been dating for 4 years? Did I miss hear that? They’d at least have some chemistry after that amount of time. They act like they had a one night stand and she got super clingy. I went to youtube to find easter eggs in the artwork. All the “explained” videos keep forcing the fact that this movie is special because it’s about a relationship. You could skip straight to the festival part, reduce most or the relationship stuff and it would probably be a better movie. The main characters have no personality and are the worst actors in the whole film."
