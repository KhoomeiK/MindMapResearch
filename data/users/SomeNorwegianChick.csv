AskTrollX,fe82zuo,t3_eo2xyq,1578921903.0,"You are sick, therefore you should call in sick. Even if you're not contagious your body should be at home, resting, to fight off the infection. Going in to work will only make you heal slower.
 
 However I do feel your pain, I get what it's like to have called in sick a lot and starting to feel guilty for it. It sucks, it feels like others think you're abusing the system to take chill personal days off. That's not the case, however. You are sick. That's what sickdays are for. You are an employee, not a machine. Sometimes people get sick, and some people get sick more often than others. That happens. Noone should shame you (including yourself) into going into work sick when you should be resting."

badwomensanatomy,fdyedon,t1_fdy7mdf,1578778847.0,"That's what I was thinking. If the hole is smaller, it would just make it very uncomfortable/painful for the woman, and not give the ""enjoyable"" effect of a tight vagina that the men are looking for, since the actual vagina hasn't changed at all. But I guess that is a part of the misoginy, not realizing that the smallness of the hole =/= the tightness of the vagina."
badwomensanatomy,fdy5cqj,t1_fdxrwf9,1578776257.0,"Sorry, English isn't my first language. Do they mean (in the post) that the lips are sutured so that there is a smaller hole? How would that affect the tightness of the actual vagina?"
