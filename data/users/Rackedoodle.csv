Animemes,ffjj6qj,t1_ffjg20y,1579999425.0,"For the shows that are perfect already and didnt end ob a cliffhanger, its actually better not to have another season as it would probably be very bad in comparison to the first one. My personal example for this would be One Punch Man, I loved season 1 so much I watched it in 3 different languages and when season 2 came out I was pretty disappointed because the fight scenes were different and genos looked more like a post apocalyptic robot than a futuristic cyborg. This all being because they used a different animation studio with (probably) a lower budget. So I hope for season 3 they will go back to Studio Madhouse."
