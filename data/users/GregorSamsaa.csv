You need to :

1. Update your resume and apply for available positions outside your company that you feel measure up with what you think you should be getting paid.

2. Talk to your current management or the hiring manager within your company for that available position and let them know of your intent and desire to apply for the open position as it more closely aligns with your expected compensation for your current work duties.

3. Entertain any and all offers from your applications outside your company and make sure you find one that you are very willing and ready to accept because chances are you’re not going to get what you want and showing them a solid offer you have received and asking if they’re willing to match only works if you’re actually going to leave.

tennis,ff8anpw,t1_ff7r06y,1579671070.0,"That’s not entirely accurate.

One of the main things the WTA suffers from is competitive consistency. Their finals are often one sided and the hot player of the week barely struggles. Some of the matches I have seen were bad quality on both sides and looked like neither player wanted it or even belonged in the final.

The ATP is very different in that even when the big 3 make a final we get a very competitive match. These guys are just elevating their game to another level to win these matches but the quality of play is very high and we leave thinking “man, had medvedev faced anyone else that day, he would have had a win”

So yes, we will more than likely see multiple major winners each year, but the main difference is that we will more than likely get very high quality tennis from those that step up at each tournament and that’s what’s enjoyable to watch. So we will miss seeing the big 3 but I’d put money on the tennis being very enjoyable without them."

It talked about how someone wishing to learn how to code needs to understand it’s an ever evolving process and there is no “click” moment where it all becomes clear.

Each project or task is going to be the coder trying to solve an issue they probably haven’t seen before and the best they can hope for is to be able to reuse some code they’ve used before but it will still be approaching the problem/project from a fresh perspective.

Coding is not like other pursuits where you’re going to sit there and one day it all becomes clear and you’re all of a sudden adept and experienced at all things python or c++ or whatever.

Find yourself projects of increasing difficulty and those that require the use of other functions you’re not familiar with. Working on the same type of project will only make you skilled at one particular problem or approach.

They cannot see any of the numbers in a standard Ishihara test, so the tester pulls out a bunch of electrical wires and hands them to the testee.

I think people confuse how bad being colorblind is. They’re not seeing in black and white. Its’s subtle tones and hues that cause confusion, especially if there’s no reference.

It’s not a confrontation and if they start escalating it to one, walk out, come back with an employee and have them fix it.

I think a lot of people are misunderstanding the OP. Any time I’ve had someone try to switch seats with me is because I went by myself and they have 3 people and the empty seats they could get were two to the left of me and one to the right or something. They usually ask you to shift one over so they can sit together.

I’ve moved in those instances because one over still keeps me in the center. I always tell them “I’ll move if you promise not to talk during the movie”lol

Some of the people posting saying they’ve been asked to move entire rows, that’s just insane."
RegalUnlimited,fculevk,t1_fcufsre,1577983569.0,"I run into this all the time. I kind of make it a point to come in from the side the numbering starts on to be sure I end up at the correct seat.

The last 3 movies I’ve gone to I’ve had to move people down a seat because they were one off due to coming from the wrong side. Really sucks for large groups because instead of shifting the person in my seat to the end, they all end up standing up while trying to balance their popcorn and belongings to all shift down one seat lol

It’s a real simple fix too. Add numbers to both sides of the arm rests, that way each seat is boxed in by its assigned number instead of only having the number on one side."

“Donate money and tell us your favorite player...”

After they finish the exhibition, total is tallied to see who “won”. I feel like people would drop down hard money to show their love for their guy lol"

cowboys,fcs81zr,t1_fcri0eh,1577912751.0,"Early 2000s Texas football was some scary shit because of the no pain no gain, we’ll run you into the ground mentality.

I have a nephew playing Texas football right now and things are so much better. I initially advised my sister against it but I think all programs in general have evolved from doing stupidly dangerous shit like not allowing a teen to drink water during a 3hr practice in Texas heat. Sad to say that a lot of the heat stroke deaths probably had to happen to make these changes a reality.

The whole no pain no gain ideology is also dying because a lot of these new coaches are embracing new studies and research regarding maximizing gains and performance. They’re all about being efficient in training, minimizing injuries, and longevity of the athlete.

And the football level as well as win records are the same if not better than 10 or 20yrs ago."

TwoXChromosomes,fckh1s5,t3_ehlo0t,1577725157.0,"CVS and Walgreens are “convenience” stores much like gas station stores. They have a pharmacy, which is how most people end up in there but everything else is way overpriced when compared to a Target, WalMart, and your local grocer (H-E-B for most Texas people).

That’s not to say they don’t have some steals some times when you take advantage of being a member of their discount card (it’s free to sign up) but you really have to wait for those and even then when you do the math on some of those sales it will sometimes bring the prices of the items to slightly below regular price at the previously mentioned stores.

So yea, those prices you saw may be double the average."
BiomedicalEngineers,fckev8u,t3_ehg6pt,1577723767.0,"I would go talk to your health professions adviser, and start looking into admission requirements of the medical schools that you plan to apply to.

Sad to say that not a lot of medical schools have embraced the holistic approach to admissions. Meaning that the person with a 3.9 in bio is going to look better than your 3.2 in BME. Keep in mind that almost every one accepted into medical school is doing the extras so those are rarely going to set you apart.

It’s pretty much a given that a med school applicant is going to have undergrad research, poster presentations, conference attendance, massive volunteer hours, and summer research internships. 

If the schools you plan to apply to take a more holistic approach when reviewing your application then it will absolutely help to show up with a BME undergrad because they will take the difficulty of the course material into account. Be prepared to answer this question though, “Why do you want to go into medicine if your undergrad is in engineering?”"
