Firstly, they do provide a link to the survey data, though they did the lazy journalism thing of reporting on an article someone else wrote so you need to click through from there. [Never say I don't do anything for you.](http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2020/images/01/20/rel1a.-.trump,.impeachment.pdf) (1) and (2) as such can be definitively answered. 

As for (3) - The breakdown is provided above. It may answer your queries, if you're adequately interested, though they don't give the total number of each demographic (though the relative numbers can be inferred from the sampling error listed). But they do give you that information. 

>3.5. Why only these categories? Was age and wealth factored in as well? State location? Rural housing and city housing? If not, why not? If you’re pulling all this excess data on race and gender why aren’t you factoring in everything else too? You can’t accurately answer all these questions with a single test. The test should’ve only focused on the one question at hand and then had more separate tests for the other information if they wanted that information.

Some of this information is included, but you'd have to ask them for their decision making about what to include and exclude.  I assume that they need to draw the line somewhere.

The more I look down the list the more I feel like I'm repeating myself by saying ""check the supplied link"" so I'll leave it there. I agree with you in that them not linking directly to the survey is questionable, but I'd tend to go with laziness over anything more nefarious on the basis that, as far as I can tell, I can't see where they've been misleading in their reporting. I personally would have included sampling errors, I guess."
politics,ff8cx3l,t1_ff8c2h2,1579673342.0,"Something I realised on a second reading of your comment but missed on the first - definitely >50% of people who were *surveyed* responded in the affirmative. Sampling error takes into account what you were worried about previously - trying to extrapolate a large population's opinion based on a sample size. Definitely 51% of respondents responded in the affirmative to ""should Trump be removed"". Also of note - only 45% responded negatively, while 4% had no opinion, so even if you could reasonably say that people wanting Trump removed might not be the majority, it is basically certainly the plurality based on this survey."
politics,ff8b5lb,t1_ff894hz,1579671546.0,"That's true, but there's still roughly a 75% chance that the headline is accurate based on the results of this poll. Also, following this same logic, (I assume that) other polls that show the most likely case being 48% or 49% would have a sampling error showing that the majority of Americans *could* want Trump out, but it would be disingenous to say that they *do*. 

Essentially - based on what you've (correctly) asserted, what part of the headline or article would you change?"
politics,ff8b01w,t1_ff89jrl,1579671398.0,"Well... if you're saying that we should wait for more polls to show the same thing before we get too excited, then I agree with you, but I'm not sure what other point you're trying to make. In the broader context what the people think on this issue is largely irrelevant anyway, given that the people with the power to make the decision have already made their mind.
