I think it's a bit oversimplified and miscontrues the evidence, but it is certainly true that daily 1200 for women and 1500 for men for sustained weight loss is widely accepted by professionals and the community as a safe minimum. So that is a good level to put in place. How unsafe and the quality of the evidence going under that by how much and for how long and in what circumstances is another question that is probably better addressed elsewhere."

The wild horse is unhappy and resents the rider; the trained horse and the rider are of the same mind and following the same path to their destination.

loseit,ffcrwx5,t3_esxfm1,1579806005.0,"\>  I haven’t even checked the scales recently but last time I did

Friend, I've been seeing this over and over. Weigh yourself like you are setting the clock to it. Same time every week at least if not every morning. Right after you wake up and use the toilet, same day every week or every morning. Do this while you are losing weight. Do this after you have lost the weight. Do this the rest of your life, regardless of what your weight is doing, regardless of whether you are recording it or recording your diet or your state of mind or lifestyle.

It takes less than 10 seconds out of your day. There's no excuse. You can live in denial for weeks and months but if you are seeing the scale every week or every day you will know how heavy you are and you will not have the excuse that you just didn't know how bad it was while you gained 30 pounds over a period of months.

I mean, you own a scale right? You could have weighed yourself a fraction of the time it took to type this post. You are typing a post saying you are starting over again for the 4th time but you haven't gone and stepped on the scale to even determine how much you weigh *today* or even recently in order to know how much you need to lose. You need to face up to this seriously if you intend to take that weight off again and then preserve your hard-won losses. This pattern is not going to magically fix itself. If you get diet back down again and then stop caring enough to even keep stepping on the scale afterwards then in the best case scenario you will be back here a 5th time having gained it all back."

loseit,ffbz08g,t3_esrere,1579787215.0,"Congratulations on losing 55 kg, that's literally a massive accomplishment.

But you are not pregnant. Her pregnancy and a Christmas holiday that happens every year to everyone is not an excuse to gain 8 kg. I'm not saying that to be mean, it's just a fact. It may be a fraction of what you lost, but it's not a small amount. It's certainly not a normal amount to gain during holidays--and with they type of discipline needed to maintain weigh loss there's not really a reason to gain any significant weight over holidays.

Since you are in a marriage and this is a big issue ideally you should be able to talk to your wife for support even if she has a lot on her plate as I am guessing you probably share meals together.

As for ""how do I stop,"" I ask you, how did you lose 55 kg? Why did you stop doing that? There's a lot of resources in the Compendium and FAQ in the sidebar, but I suspect you already know exactly what you needed to do to lose that 55 kg, which also happened during stressful times in your life.

Yeah if you're getting compulsions to the point where you're disrobing and weighing yourself every 45 minutes and it's disrupting your activities throughout the day that's a problem. But if it's just stepping on and off the scale a few times a day I don't see the harm, especially if it defuses anxiety about your weight. Not weighing yourself at all is a big issue. You wouldn't know that your weight loss has slowed down (which is normal when you are smaller), and if your slow weight loss turned into a slow weight gain you would have no idea until you noticed your clothes getting tight or appearance changing (assuming you paid attention to that and weren't in denial). Information is power. Multiple daily weigh-ins don't add much if any information but unless extreme they don't really hurt."
loseit,ffbx7t0,t3_esrxvl,1579785704.0,"I really don't think it's a good idea. You can't manage what you don't measure. As long as you are diligent about tracking your calories for a deficit it's not so important to track your weight, but the weight is the easiest, most precise, and fastest responding ground truth. People get fat unawares because they lose sight of their ground truth.

Now if you are weighing yourself every two weeks you are getting your ground truth every two weeks, but you say it's ""about"" every two weeks indicating that this isn't a regularly scheduled routine. It's way too easy to just stop weighing yourself altogether if you don't have an appointment with the scale weekly and you are just weighing yourself when you feel like it. The problem is when you fall off your weight loss routine and you have already fallen off weighing yourself and have issues with the scale, then you're unlikely to weigh yourself again until a lot damage is done. This is how folks end up back here after they've gained back all their hard-fought losses (or more) in a matter of a few months of denial. I really think that an unhealthy relationship with the scale has as much blame as an unhealthy relationship with food for many weight regains. If you look at **most** of these stories, they were not regularly weighing themselves throughout their weigh gain, and very often it is **shock** at the number they are seeing that brings them back here.

So while one size may not fit all I do think it's far better to develop a healthy relationship with the scale and the noisy numbers it gives you. I weigh myself in the morning after I pee and before I brush my teeth as part of my morning routine, it takes me no time at all and I don't fuss over it. You could consider weighing yourself more often (e.g. once a week) without logging it every time.

If you really don't think you can handle more than a two week interval (and I don't think you really know until you've spent a good month or two weighing yourself daily to see if that changes), then I would very strongly suggest making that **scheduled** at the same time every two weeks, e.g. after waking up and peeing every other Monday or Saturday morning or what have you.

If even having an appointment at any interval still causes you too much stress and anxiety to deal with, then that's really potentially indicative of a problem that's going to cause denial issues dealing with future weight gain trends, which **will** happen at some point."
loseit,ffbvxoc,t1_ffbb1ix,1579784554.0,"While on one level you are right there are two levels on which you are wrong:

1. Eating something may trigger eating other things (most often, more of the same thing). The behavioral effect is real. Altering behavior to avoid triggers is rational.
2. As mentioned in earlier comments eating something may trigger water retention and bloating. e.g. eating a 0.25 pounds of sugar or 0.25 pounds of salt with water will cause more than a 0.25 pound gain on the scale than the water alone. No that won't be 4 pounds of fat but it is more weight for a time and it can be significant enough to have a temporary effect on appearance.

You might not like how your wife is putting this but if that's how she's justifying her food choices and she is maintaining a healthy weight or weight trajectory then that's not an argument I would pick; let her say it and get over it and by no means pressure her to eat something she doesn't want to."

So maybe he was trying to be make a cleverly humorous point, but even so I don't think it's helpful to think in ways that in justify or minimize binges and falling off the wagon behavior, rather, it's better to just be encouraging of stopping that behavior, getting back on track and moving on with the marathon."

As to what to do about it, again, seize the day and change your life now. You already know the changes that got you here and the changes you need to make. Frozen pizza and cookies got you here. Stop eating and snacking on cookies AT ALL (or reserve them to infrequent schedules, but really, they are your crack. you should quit them.). We all know what cravings are like; it comes down to is it worth it to service insatiable cravings for junk if it means weighing 200+ pounds and up and never getting back down to 180 (which is still an unhealthy weight)? Is that what you want to model for growing child? If the answer is no, ditch the cookies and accept that you won't eat them any more until you get to your goal weight. And even if you schedule cheats, do not use cheat food as a reward for reaching goal weights. This kneecaps your incentives. Reward yourself with a nonfood pleasure.

Your major gameplan is going to be counting calories, mealplanning healthy foods, and secondarily add some exercise for health and wellness. But even if you struggle to go all the way, if you can just cold-turkey your major junk foods (frozen pizza and cookies) and make yourself eat healthy choices, you should see a difference. e.g., it's impossible to binge on steamed broccoli to obesity. Eat healthy very-low-calorie foods with EVERY meal and for EVERY snack.

\----

Another suggestion, get not just your SO's support but his buy-in. He's happy with his weight at 164 but he should not be, he's also overweight, just not obese. You may be making him complacent. Ask him to lose weight as a team, eating healthy meals and exercising together. It will be longer and harder for you than him to reach a healthy or ideal weight, but on the other hand it will be much easier for you to lose more weight initially. So chart your progress together, at least initially, and even after he is at a healthy weight he can still work with you in maintaining and encouraging a healthy lifestyle, as the same things he will need to maintain a newly healthy weight are what you need to do to achieve one (although you need fewer calories than him).

Of course if he's not willing to play along you will have to do it without him, but for most guys it would be more likely that he's extremely eager to help you lose weight and would love the opening but afraid there's no way for him to express this."

I would make the point that cutting out alcohol is great, but advice to switch to liquor with minimal mixers to someone whose relationship with alcohol isn't completely healthy is like advising someone to switch from pot to crack for weight loss.

If you're someone who has 2-5 beers or glasses of wine a week and never binges then this would work in theory, but that person is probably not going to get the same experience they want sipping neat whiskey.

If you're a heavy beer, wine or cocktail drinker then it would be better to just cut down on whatever you're drinking than switch to straight hard stuff.

I guess the alcoholic selzters that are all the rage (White Claw anyone?) are a lower calorie substitute for beer but most actually have the same calories as lower-alcohol light beer, so if anything the light beer is healthier drink for drink since there's less alcohol.

So all around I think it's better advice just to eliminate or reduce alcohol intake. Moderate alcohol use can be fine for maintenance but I think for weight loss it's easier to abstain or have it as a treat/cheat rather than a regular thing, but adults can make their own decisions."

Drug overdose fatalities are direct deaths from the use and effects of the drug itself. That's not counting all the disabilities, suicides, infections, drug-related disease and collateral consequences.

Opiates including and especially heroin are some of the worst substances you can mess around with. You take too much and you can stop breathing and die, or if you don't die, you have irreversible brain and organ damage. You can't know what's in street drugs, and the lethal dose of fentanyl, which is highly sought by addicts and widely added to other opiates, is two milligrams. A dose that may get you high one day may kill you on a relapse when your tolerance is down.

You can look normal as an addict up to a point, but you can still drop dead in minutes, whether or not you've visibly hit rock bottom.
