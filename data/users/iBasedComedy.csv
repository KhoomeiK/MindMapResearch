kingdomcome,ffw2ecb,t3_euyvvc,1580281394.0,"There’s a woodland garden northwest of Ledetchko. If you can level up your lockpicking enough, there’s a hard chest in it that has St George’s Sword, one of the best swords in the game. 

If it’s armor you’re after, there’s a walled in area south of Skalitz. Inside there’s about six decently armored bandits. If you can lure one away from the others, you can kite them pretty easily. That’s how I got my first cuirass. It’ll save you an arm and leg at the Rattay Armourer and you’ll get set up with a full or partial set of plate. Although I recommend you get Pebbles first to carry some of the loot/make a quick get away. Also, make sure you save if you try this.

If you’re felling brave, the bandits in Skalitz wear some of the best armor in game, plus there’s almost always one or two with silver/gold spurs. Wait for them to beat the fuck out of each other and harvest their plate."

I was disappointed by Herod’s Sword when I first started using it. Not because it was bad, but because it looked like it was the best sword in the game and I had stolen it the first day I was in Rattay. So I had nothing to look forward to in the later game, sword-wise. 

If you’re trying to get better at combat, make sure you train with Captain Bernard, at the very least until he teaches you how to riposte. If you’re not ready to grind at Skalitz yet, there’s a walled in area south of Skalitz with 5 to 6 bandits inside. It’s pretty easy to lure them out 1 or 2 at a time. Down a Saviour Schnapps before you go in and you can practice fighting with some decent enemies. Plus, you get a couple of decent sets of armor to sell."

kingdomcome,ff1syd4,t3_er424k,1579485482.0,"Some things that would improve the game in my opinion. Spoilers maybe.

Combat Lock On is too rigid. I’d like to be able to defend myself from more than the person directly in front of me. 

Stealth Kill. If I kill someone silently, without witnesses, it shouldn’t draw the attention of half of Bohemia.

Detailed Tutorials. It took me longer than I’d like to admit to figure out that blocking drains stamina and when you run out you take real damage. I don’t recall Captain Bernard saying anything like that.

Maintenance Skill. You can get away with Henry not being able to read or sword fight because he grew up as the son of a blacksmith, but you’re telling me that Good Ol’ Hal o’ Skalitz doesn’t know how to repair weapons or armor when he grew up with a forge in his backyard?

Fast Travel. It would be nice to be able to cancel fast travel. If a pitchfork wielding peasant can pull me out, why can’t I do it myself?

Archery. I understand what they were going for, but I would love this game even more if I had an aiming reticle instead of putting tape on my screen. I mean, we have one for the melee weapons, but not for the bow? It’s not asking for much, just a little dot on the screen.

Bandits. How is it that the Cumans, who slaughtered an entire village and strike fear into hearts all over Bohemia, seem like kittens compared to the bandits, who were presumably driven into a life of crime by poverty. Why is it that random bandits in the middle of the woods have better armor than the professional soldiers.

More Cities. The map is basically Rattay and Sasau. I’d love for them to add some other cities, like Kuttenburg or Prague.

This went on longer than I expected, sorry.

Oh! One last one. 

We go through so much shit, singlehandedly saving Bohemia from the forces of darkness, and Henry doesn’t even get knighted? Unbelievable."

kingdomcome,ff1mg2j,t1_ff0ar38,1579481608.0,I felt this in my soul.
kingdomcome,ff1j6g9,t1_ff0jxdb,1579480050.0,"I usually hope for ambushes, too. My favorite spot is the fork in the road between Rovna and Skalitz. Usually between 3 to 5 armored bandits or Cumans. My problem is that I sometimes fast travel on foot and by the time i pull out my dollmaker arrows or sword, I’m surrounded. Or I’m ambushed in an area where kiting doesn’t work, like the zigzag road between Rovna and Merhojed. If I’m ambushed at the fork, I leave with several sets of plate armor. But if I’m ambushed by the zigzag, I usually get knocked down the side of the hill, snapping my ankles like crisp celery. Then, while I’m shuffling around trying to find a way back to the path, the bandits come down and proceed to put the boots to me, medium style.

ps: I know I should be using a mace, but there’s just something satisfying about stabbing someone in the face."

It’s your ring, not theirs. Who cares if the jeweler was a criminal? As long as he wasn’t robbing graves for gold fillings to make the ring, then there’s no reason why you should have it destroyed.

You said hey when you got home, why would he expect you to greet him for a trip to the kitchen? You just woke up and would have been, presumably, tired. No reasonable person would have held it against you for forgetting, or made a big deal out of it. Even in a house where a formal greeting is normal that would have been over the top.

I‘d say that your dad sounds like he’s on some sort of power/ego trip, but it looks like that’s just how he is. You have to be careful about people with large and fragile egos, because sooner or later they’ll find or create a situation that sets them off.
