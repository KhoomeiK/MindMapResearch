Unfortunately you have to report what you saw or you’re in jeopardy yourself. You can take solace in the fact that you only saw kissing and handholding, and without more evidence he probably can’t get in trouble for more than that.

All we know is that she now acts “different”. Who even knows if it has anything to do with this?!

relationship_advice,fdjytg6,t3_elp8dt,1578491684.0,"You sound like you’re an amazingly strong person, handling this very well and doing everything right. I’m extremely impressed by your maturity. 
Just FYI, if the lock think gets turned down you can use a common wedge shaped door stop on the inside of your door (assuming it opens into the room) to keep the door closed. It’s less effective with carpet, but used properly this solution can be as strong as a lock because when the door is pushed the wedge only gets tighter. It’s a cheap and easy solution you could start employing right away. 
The down side is that if you did have a medical or fire emergency they’d pretty much have to destroy the door. Your peace of mind and safety might be worth that though.
