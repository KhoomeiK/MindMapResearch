somethingimade,ffiq3y7,t1_ffhj17e,1579979916.0,What kind of equipment are you working with? Just a glass cutter or any grinders?
AmItheAsshole,fficsit,t1_ffi4bbs,1579970800.0,It comes across that you feel you're more entitled to do your work than let her do hers. YTA for that. And instead of asking you basically forced her to comply with your wishes by having a stewardess ask.
somethingimade,ffh3wii,t3_etjrjv,1579922420.0,Your soldering lines are great!
Modesto,ffh0hwr,t3_etis5n,1579919828.0,Is that that random run down looking spot on K street?
acturnips,ffdx9ru,t3_esjwz7,1579831210.0,Hello! Are you still available for new people?
ac_newhorizons,ff82rbp,t3_es2sxp,1579664456.0,If Mac and Shep aren't in it I riot.
MakeupAddiction,fdt48qb,t1_fdsz0vj,1578711709.0,Yeah it's annoying when people blur/touch up their FOTDs... I get that makeup is supposed to enhance and idealize but you create unrealistic expectations of how makeup should be. Everyone has pores people!
NeckbeardNests,fdpnu16,t3_emjv5h,1578634049.0,You can always do this again too. Keep it up :)
EarthPorn,fdfs3a7,t1_fdfryt2,1578368825.0,Well at least one family was against it.
EarthPorn,fdfdyq3,t3_ekyiyr,1578359452.0,"A long time ago I stayed with a Navajo family near this and they said this formation was sacred and it was disrespectful to go out there without a tribal guide but seems like non-natives go regardless based on these responses. Kind of sad. It was super windy when we hiked up it, but it's definitely an amazing experience--the formation feels powerful."
JusticeServed,fde8p0h,t1_fddqvv0,1578333622.0,"Lol I think he's singing Auld Lang Syne but with the lyrics replaced with ""Chelsea"""
nonononoyes,fdatgss,t1_fcmmv16,1578249920.0,https://youtu.be/4g4CIYR7lIk here's the YouTube link. Overall carchase is just insane with multiple pit maneuvers attempted.
facepalm,fdaaxhr,t1_fda79vn,1578243887.0,Yeah okay dude next you'll tell me cats aren't the girls and dogs the boys of the same species. Next time try paying a lil attention in school.
facepalm,fd9ni2r,t1_fd8ci4b,1578235631.0,I grew up next to a farm so I think I know a few things about livestock.
facepalm,fd7izcm,t1_fd7h45s,1578205286.0,Goats are the boys and sheep are the girls.
Art,fcxbij4,t1_fcw6wlx,1578058312.0,Yes I thought the same thing!
Art,fcx87c4,t3_ejcxhn,1578055108.0,Go lil' shark! Be brave and venture forth into the unknown!
Damnthatsinteresting,fcrs6ee,t1_fcqmm5s,1577905902.0,"It was him experimenting with different styles as he aged. This is a little misleading. If it was all realistic portraits rather than stylized it'd be a better comparison. Also, I remember reading that these weren't in chronological order."
Baking,fc7e28w,t3_egj5ln,1577504675.0,"This one is very chic and clean, love it."
AnimalCrossing,fc1s265,t1_fc1pp3c,1577327927.0,Yeah I resent how this dog that constantly railroads you into tasks is shoehorned into being the mascot of this game. Tortimer for life.
