Anyone with a net worth over $10,000 is not going to have that excess money in cash it will be invested in vehicles with a higher return whether that be CDs, bonds, mutual funds, rental properties etc. Everyones net worth is “paper” wealth until the point they liquidate all their assets which is usually only upon death if even then."

Politician 2 says, screw solar panels I want them all confiscated and burned in the new coal fired plant I will be proposing for my district. Should you now be allowed to donate money to Politician 1 to help make sure he gets elected? Because thats what we are discussing here. I think you should."

smallbusiness,fct22yf,t3_eiji1o,1577930867.0,Is there another service you can add on that people may want at the same time? For example the local popular alarm company started offering pest control because people who just bought a new house and are setting up alarm monitoring often need to start annual pest control as well and now they are one of the biggest in the city. Or maybe partner with another contractor with a related service like if you are power washing driveways and see cracks you can refer to a guy who can patch it and get a cut from each job. Same with replacing windows.

Custody,fc3mubv,t3_eg0nvu,1577393478.0,Judge will look at whats least disruptive for the child. If she has been with you for a year thats the status quo and works in your favor.
energy,fc3ctmu,t1_fc3bam6,1577386959.0,I think people fail to realize that right now natural gas is practically free. There is so much gas being produced as a byproduct of oil drilling that in the Permian you have to pay people money to take your gas or just burn it. Until that glut subsides gas will be the nobrainer for power.

wildhearthstone,fbycv2n,t3_ef4qvr,1577213714.0,When I climbed to wild legend I was playing more like 8 hours a day for the final week. Your deck type factors in here of course. Some decks play much faster then others. Rank 3 is where the grind really begins. These days I usually just shoot for 3.
