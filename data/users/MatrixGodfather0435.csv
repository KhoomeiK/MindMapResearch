AskReddit,ffescot,t1_ffes6kh,1579863199.0,See that's what I came to. But I wanted to see what conclusions others came to.
AskReddit,ffes3wg,t3_et0g8b,1579862847.0,I had a friend who thought that everyone had voices in their heads. I kinda thought he meant like thoughts and conscience. Nope actual full on voices like a conversation just out of reach. Poor guy.
AskReddit,fferz98,t1_ffermfg,1579862658.0,"Interesting thought. However as society exists, arent all people interdependent upon eachother? If one agent is dependent upon another doesn't that violate the definition? Not trying to prove any point this just kept me up all night."
prolife,ffeqzci,t1_ffemz2h,1579861169.0,"I do want to clarify something in case I wasn't clear. Since autonomy does not exist in any stage of development, there is no separation between abortion and murder. We grant bodily autonomy arbitrarily because we lie to ourselves saying that we are in control when in fact we have no control. From that perspective, abortion must be murder because it violates and ends a life. Anyway feel free to discuss. I love this kind of thing. God Bless!"

RandomThoughts,ffe2svl,t1_ffe1y0c,1579835217.0,"Oh ok sorry. Been a long day and the brain is running at like 2%. The way I see it, Britian couldn't win the war. Each general acted more for their own glory rather than the success of the mission. There was no ""total force"" policy that was actually enforced. They were too far removed from the TOW and established military doctrine encouraged the British army to be slow and methodical in most cases. (Not counting special units) then you had once France came and harrassed the British navy and stopped the flow of reinforcements, it guaranteed America's victory. Most of the officers in the US army and navy were British trained and then we got some French and even Prussian officers come to train troops. It became a massive think tank. The British generals were outsmarted, outmaneuvered, and way too under supported by the end of the war. But that's just my thoughts."
RandomThoughts,ffe18in,t1_ffe0cps,1579834074.0,Can you please provide a source? I'm only finding quotes about the ideas of the revolution and french involvement but nothing of great detail.

RandomThoughts,ffdzxx2,t3_et3pqx,1579833134.0,Wait. You believe America didn't? Or is it that you think the French and Spanish won it for us?

prolife,ffdvy0d,t1_ffdl6qg,1579830267.0,"Just to chime in here, I have a lot to say about this brain teaser and it got me thinking for about 30 seconds. Believe it or not that's impressive. I built a global network from a 10 second thought. Idk I think fast. 

Let's go ahead and clarify autonomy. In a common sense, autonomy refers to the right to self govern oneself. As far as bodily autonomy is concerned, there is no difference in the definition. This is where I see the first two cracks in the brain teaser. This teaser assumes the life cannot exist without external support and based on context we are to believe that this refers to a uterus and the nutrients that come from a mother's body. NICUs are more and more common in hospitals all around the world. Incubation technology is advancing to the point where a fetus can be removed 4 months early and in many cases even earlier. This poses many risks but it is possible. (See below)

The second issue with this teaser is that in this context, it can be assumed that the point of the teaser is to grant autonomy to educated adults or those who are self aware. How do I get there? Well the definition of autonomy requires the agent to have an understanding of itself. The issue with that is that would give someone the right to terminate not only a pregnancy but the life of a child until they reach the degree of intelligence required to satisfy the definition. Which would be rightly defined as murder. If we use this definition as the standard, then there would be no difference between aborting a 10 week fetus or say a 4 year old child.

The final issue I have with this teaser is an implied end to dependency. Yes, fetuses are completely dependent upon their mother and infants and children are dependent on their parents but even as fully formed adults we are dependent upon external forces beyond our control. We depend on the planet to rotate, the moon and gas giants to soup up asteroids that could hit us if they didn't. We depend on other people to farm, to make medicines, to lead, to manage our finances, even to clean our teeth for us. Part of the human condition is interdependence. That simply does not end at some point. No one is completely autonomous at any stage of development.  Anyway thanks for the workout. Hopefully this makes sense.

startrek,ffd4pi0,t1_ffd0kvx,1579813370.0,"I'm glad that I'm not the only one who felt this way. That being said, one of my favorite things about Trek is the epic opening. Idk from the music, you can kinda tell what the series is going to be about. Voyager's theme kinda rolled like waves on the ocean in a way symbolic of a great journey. DS9's was strong and triumphant symbolic of a fortress in a war. TNG was victorious like spring coming after a cold winter which is symbolic of the rebirth of the series. Idk I loved the music. But I'm weird."
startrek,ffcyflf,t3_estxqk,1579809854.0,Can I say one thing negative about it? I loved the epic music of the older shows and movies. The music with Discovery and so far Picard loses something for me. Other than that one super small detail I absolutely loved the pilot.

AskReddit,ffbqgpa,t3_esrnvc,1579778572.0,"As a Christian, I'd expect the New Testament to be true with the exception of Revelation which I see as poetic and symbolic. The Old Testament though, I can see the ideas being true like maybe Noah did build a big boat and saved a bunch of animals in some valley that he may have lived in or something but not literal truth. Look at the Genesis creation story for instance. In English we translate the Hebrew word Yom to mean day but it could potentially mean an age or just a really long period of time in general. So I think the messages in the Old Testament are true but things probably (in some cases definately) didn't happen exactly like the Bible says. But that's the thing. It's not a history book it's a theological book. But hey that's just what I believe."

I know so many ""Christians"" who say this but then they go on and do horrible things all the while saying that their tickets are stamped to heaven. Doesn't Paul say something along the lines of Our salvation in Christ does not give us a license to sin? As much as we should be confident in our salvation, we should be humble in our sin and prostrate ourselves before God in repentance of our sins. But heck that's just the way I see it. Feel free to to discuss. Deus Vult."
OhioStateFootball,ffb5i9e,t3_esnskn,1579752335.0,"Ok just a thought but do you really think Kraft is going to look for a never been an NFL head coach before guy after Belichick?

Showerthoughts,ffb0pdn,t1_ffaywn1,1579748914.0,There are DEFINITELY health issues. No offense to anyone on reddit I just dont want to go into it online but the bottom line is you're right that I need to track this stuff. Before I fixed my eating I went from a fit fighting machine to a ball of grease. It took a minute to start actually losing weight. Water weight doesnt count but I'm down about 8 lbs so far.
diet,ffax0je,t1_ffawuov,1579746454.0,Cool thanks! So should I be at all worried about the beinge eating? I mean clearly I should stay away from it.
Showerthoughts,ffavs7d,t1_ffaukiw,1579745635.0,Also it's not like I'm not losing weight. I am. The issue is that it is happening in weird spurts. I get to the gym maybe one every other week and I use an exercise bike from time to time at work but I'm a far cry from my 8:40 1.5 miles 65 pushups and 80 situps for the Air Force. It's weird.
Showerthoughts,ffavjso,t1_ffaukiw,1579745482.0,"900 isnt a calculated amount it's a ballpark max I can pump into me without finding myself sick. Normally I'll eat yogurt with some oatmeal and bananas or strawberries depending on what I have on hand then my wife will get home and I'll eat a handful of nuts and/or berries. Then dinner comes around and on average the blue apron meals we select is somewhere around 450 calories and nothing else. I drink water almost exclusively. Catch is I mostly don't eat everything I have in front of me. As far as sugary things, I've mostly cut those out in the past few months but I'll occasionally have a coke every other week or so. I dont eat junk for the most part unless I am working a weekend in which case I'm in a secured area where I can't leave for 12 hours or more and all they have is chips and cookies. Yay."
diet,ffapkw8,t3_eskskq,1579741498.0,Also it may make sense to say that I don't drink that much. Maybe 2 or 3 beers over the course of about a week on average. Sometimes more sometimes none at all. Depends on if there's any sports on.
diet,ffapchx,t1_ffaooua,1579741342.0,"Sure. It's not super often maybe once every month for a day, usually less, and the last time was New Years Eve."
AskDocs,ffaomoi,t1_ffao2lb,1579740864.0,Hey thanks a lot! I just wanted to make sure nothing crazy was going on.
AskDocs,ffanl94,t1_ffamzuk,1579740160.0,"Yeah I do IT for work and so there's a good 8-12 hours of screen time. I mean I do pee a lot but that's because I drink about 3 or 4 32 ounce bottles of water a day in order to keep myself from falling asleep at work.

As far as the hunger goes, it seems more related to when I go back to a ""normal"" schedule. I rotate off working nights for about 5 days every month or so and it seems like I always get super hungry then."

Showerthoughts,ffagreu,t1_ffac2t7,1579735374.0,"I get what you're saying but no need to be an ass about it especially when you dont know me. Problem hasn't been type of food for years the problem is the amount. I'm virtually never hungry and when I am it's when I have 3 days off and my sleep schedule goes from hopefully 08:00ish to an absolute max (and very rarely reached) 13:00 to somewhat normal nights. If I force myself to eat say 3 decent meals or even multiple smaller ones, my stomach churns like I'm way too full and I'll be in pain for hours. Went to see an allergist but only found lactose to be an issue which hasn't helped and I'm on a waiting list for a GI doctor but options are extremely limited here and the jerk keeps pushing my appointments back. Regardless, my body acts like it's in starvation mode at all times as a result of all of this because I maybe clear about 900 calories a day and that's pushing it. So while off of this is going on I A - don't feel comfortable going to the gym and making the calorie deficit worse. B - barely have time to take care of my mental health anyway which is what the gym used to be before I started this job. Anyway I need to lose about 40 lbs but I have absolutely no idea how to do that given the time this job takes and my diet issue."
