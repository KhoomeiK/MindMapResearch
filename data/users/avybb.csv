EDanonymemes,feu1rmk,t1_fesq26u,1579382245.0,"I definitely don't think IF and disordered eating are the same thing, some people can practice IF in a healthy way. I wasn't meaning to say that people cant, this is just what I feel like telling people when they recommend diets to me (as I'm trying to recover)."
EDanonymemes,feu0qcx,t1_fetjduf,1579381994.0,"I started my ED with legitimate diet practices. I understand that they are not synonymous but I wish people would stop recommending IF/whatever new diet fad is  to me now that I'm in recovery and have gained weight. People talk so openly and push these sorts of things with no context for individuals relationship with food. 

This is just what I feel like saying to people whenever they push diet info onto me."
Dogtraining,fek1lqi,t1_fejmc98,1579190661.0,Will try! Thank you!
endometriosis,fdd0k7z,t1_fdcw3am,1578290050.0,Thank you for your insight. It's the first step to living a less painful life and I have to at least ask a doctor
endometriosis,fdd0g1x,t1_fdcx0ed,1578289931.0,"Thank you, this makes me feel so much better. It's scary to commit to an expensive surgery but living like this is misery

I'll be very careful with picking surgeons and if I end up having endo I'll stick with excisions."
dogs,fdcgvrb,t1_fdacrar,1578274588.0,"I plan on it, my hopes are that it isnt anything neurological. If its neurological, because of the eye, they wouldn't cover any of the expenses from what I understand."
dogs,fdcgsru,t1_fd7fbwp,1578274529.0,"Will do, thank you :)"
dogs,fd76vom,t1_fd76fio,1578200204.0,"Sadly it isnt just the angle. His left eye doesnt follow his right super well.

However, knowing that if his vision is impaired he could still go on to live a happy life makes me very happy. Thank you!!!"
dogs,fd7667h,t1_fd75wzm,1578199941.0,"It is just his left

Edit to add, he can see for sure. But I'm wondering if that left eye might be vision impaired since it is wandering a bit. Or if its just similar to a human lazy eye. 

Hopefully not anything neurological :("
dogs,fd74qxk,t1_fd727b4,1578199415.0,"Of course!

The first pic is my pup,the second is the parents. His parents are 50/60 lbs, husky/GSD/lab mix (we arent sure, they were strays before my sister adopted them) 

Neither of his parents have blue eyes."
unpopularopinion,fd1cx0q,t1_fczzlph,1578129974.0,"We talk a lot in economics about how eventually in capitalism, the freedom of choice becomes eradicated because of monopolies. You can have a million flavors of potato chips but you have no ethical potato chip brands so you have no choice but to support an institution who is unethical (very basic example) 

Ironically, in order to exclusively purchase ethical products you would have to be rich."
unpopularopinion,fd1cfzc,t1_fd1ca87,1578129791.0,Yeah this is more of a rant than unpopular. Probably will delete bc anyone with a brain can recognize this
aww,fcq6w1z,t1_fcpj4lt,1577880023.0,"Sorry to give unsolicited advice (that I'm sure you already know) but with those mixes for sure watch out for hip dysplasia! I highly reccomend having your vet check up on it every 2-3 years but especially if you notice your dog having less energy or not jumping etc. She sounds absolutely adorable though, give her some pets for me!!"
dogs,fcpk4di,t1_fcpcuw4,1577866126.0,"Same here,I think lots of husky but the golden fur and little shorter muzzle is more lab."
Advice,fcp3xmv,t1_fcp2oix,1577849710.0,"Definitely a mix! He looks the most ""husky"" out of all of his littermates and is the only one with blue eyes (his parents didnt have blue eyes either) his parents were strays my sister adopted so we dont know for sure but we think Husky/German shepherd or Husky/lab mix!"
dogs,fcp2qmm,t1_fcp2bn7,1577848673.0,"Our first thought was GSD or Lab and Husky Mix!

Edit: what trait stuck out to you that made you guess GSD?"

And he is the cutest, I absolutely fell in love."
dogs,fcoxmxw,t3_ei9xa6,1577844401.0,It sounds like he might be in pain- please have him evaluated by your vet.
DoggyDNA,fcgk4po,t3_eh8pgs,1577641002.0,"My sister found a couple of free roaming dogs on our family  farm. One boy, one girl, named Captain and Marvel respectively (first pic in link is of them the first couple of days they were found). They're bonded, and we shortly found out Mavel was pregnant (we think Captain sired the pups, we dont know if the two are related for sure but we think they're littermates)

Cap and Marvel are 45-55 lbs and full grown, 32 inches long and 28 inches tall. Marvel has some brown coloring on her back which some of the pups got (she had a litter of 8 surviving puppies, 10 total)

Sebastian is the only one with blue eyes, none of his littermates or parents have them. He is a slimmer than a lot of his littermates and not as active though he enjoys running and bones. He also is the most White of them all. 

In the link there are pics of his parents and his littermates, as well as a few extra of him

ABoringDystopia,fc6wfts,t1_fc6jgp8,1577491250.0,"Actually, while this is the case in some places, it actually is important. Water is a scarce resource and water rights are something of great contention in places with severe droughts such as Colorado (where I live!) See, how much water people collect in Colorado effects about 4 other states and their water access. It isnt just about where the water is, it's where its going. While large companies overlook these regulations and ship water(which sucks) that doesnt make it a good idea for people to have free reign over rainwater. Nature doesnt care about state lines, it has it's own flow. It's important to respect that in order for the water cycle to properly nourish everyone (the best it can at least, no guarantee) we have to control our interaction with water collection carefully."
AskReddit,fc3udqm,t3_efqzp6,1577398870.0,"I know this is going to get lost in the abyss but my sister brought 5 puppies to the house and refused to take care of them half the time. There were 8 dogs and 12 people in my house, it was pure madness. I didnt get to play any games or eat a single meal at the table with my family because I was trying to get 8 week old puppies not to poop inside or bark their heads off in kennels. 

The worst part is that no one ever offered to help or missed me at the dinner table."
