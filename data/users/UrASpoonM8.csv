It isn't necessarly small talk. This is just a case of petty authoritarians making daft rules for everyone."
ukpolitics,fex8012,t1_feuh16g,1579426544.0,Its a slight bugger that a key witness was suicided by unkown parties
ZeroWaste,fept892,t1_fenihl3,1579330470.0,I don't see it as shaming women for having periods. Maybe shaming women for dealing with them in a less environmentally friendly way. Granted if some women had a genuine medical reason and these guys were going full jehovas witness with their promotion of cups that could be an issue.

fuckthesepeople,fe1b09x,t1_fdzlj4f,1578824530.0,Its standard procedure in the supermarkets here granted the bacon is likely fine but other meats may not do so well.
fuckthesepeople,fdopyqm,t1_fdmk3wz,1578610250.0,The asian (usually of pakistani origin) grooming gangs have shown up now and again and was a big scandal for a while. The article being 'race bait' really shouldn't detract from the rape and sexual exploitation or the british police's inability or disinterest in dealing with this issue.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotherham_child_sexual_exploitation_scandal

productivity,fbxeooy,t3_eez9yq,1577183447.0,"100% Robusta coffee beans might do it. Way stronger than regular beans. If your in the uk they do it at asda as a brand called grumpy mule.


Maybe take some time to excercise. That has always given me more energy in general though not straight after a workout. It would also be worth getting consistent sleep if you don't already."
