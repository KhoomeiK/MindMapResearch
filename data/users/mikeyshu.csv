The only real way to recover from a psychological trauma is by talking about it, to come to terms with it.

You can take meds, you can do other therapies. But no ""method"" will succeed on its own, without facing the trauma and coming to terms with it. Which you do by talking about it, re-living it, then learning to deal with it or get over it.

In fact: by not wanting to talk about the trauma, you'll make it worse. You shove it deeper and deeper but you will never actually overcome it.

Perhaps you can try to bring up the courage to talk about your trauma by reassuring yourself, that whatever you did, whatever someone did to you - you are not the only one and you don't have to be ashamed.

My friends and I had this band for a while in our teen years. At some point we wanted a new name. Somehow, being young and dumb and whatnot, we thought that ""**Laughin' Eyes**"" was a good name. I admit that is weird and funny enough. Like looking back I can't even say why we found that a to be a good name, lol.

Anyways. So one time we managed to get ""booked"" through a friend of a friend for a local farm's summer festival. Said friend being the one in touch with the organizers of the festival, he gave them all the necessary info about us. So they went along and promoted their festival, prepared banners, printed leaflets, booked newspaper ads - the whole shebang.

Except there was one little problem. As the festival got closer and the first newspaper ads and articles were being published, we suddenly realized that the entire time our band name was written completely wrong.

The folks missunderstood our name ""**Laughin' Eyes**"" and instead thought we were called ""**Love In Ice**""!! :D :D :D

Needless to say we were super pissed having ads, banners and whatnot all over the town announcing one of the festival's act called ""Love in Ice"".

Also needless to say that after that, we renamed our band. Ended up calling the band ""Phoenix"", then. :-)

After years I finally brought up the courage to reveal to her about my severe depression, hoping she would solace me and help me through it.

Instead she looked at me, then laughed at me and heavily mocked me for it. What's worse: She was studying for a fucking medical degree. So she literally should have known better.

That hurt me so, so bad, the 2 remaining days of the trip were awful. Originally we had planned for her to stay another week with me after we get back home (she lived a few hours away).

But really, honestly, what is much worse than all of that together, is how others treat you for how your life is going. Like as if it's all your fault and you're just being a doofus and not trying hard enough or whatever.

Like the OP described - what do you even tell a person you meet for the first time? Truth is, our society is all about status symbols and a job is the prime status symbol. So having none and having not worked in years, essentially makes everyone around you look at you like you're some sort of leprosy or ebola patient.

Or dating... how the heck do you even stand any chance dating. Impossible. You stand almost 0 chance finding love (a girl in my case). Who wants a 6+ years jobless, severely depressive guy, who can't provide for a family and isn't easy to handle. 

Doesn't matter how nice, sweet, caring you are. If you have nothing to offer, you aren't love material. Period.

Seriously. Why can't society just accept the fact, that some people just CAN'T work. I mean NOBODY would ever go to a mentally handicapped person and yell at them ""get out of your f\* wheelchair you retarded person and work!"". No, everyone accepts that people with certain visible medical conditions aren't capable of working. But with us depressive people - just get your shit together, your disease is mostly just made up, I can't see it, so stop whining and get a job.

Why? We may not physically be handicapped, but we are mentally handicapped, which also prevents some of us from working. That's simply fact. Society, accept this and let us be."

Tbh I suspect heavily that IF Rockstar ends up deciding to go with such a concept like this one here, they will probably do that anyway. They will most likely add role progression again and what you wrote would be ideal for that. 

Like you start with a simple run down small homestead and can only plant wild carrots and raise chickens. Each time you do certain things you gain XP and at a certain level you can build another stable or fenced area, or whatever. Then you can raise the next ""tier"", e.g. pigs.

You know how I mean?"

I think there might be a rather ""simple"" solution to make it possible and yet avoid having to instance the homestead. All that needs to be done is to enable more than enough spots across the map where it can be placed. I mean server cap is 32-something. So worst case the entire map needs ""just"" 32 different locations. If the homestead isn't gonna be huge, then it should actually be do-able.

Then imagine the system to basically work just like the mobile Cripps camps. You don't really purchase a fixed spot like the Moonshine shack. You just buy a homestead once and it will always spawn once you enter a lobby. However: It might change location, if the previous location was already taken by another player in the new lobby you entered.

Is that utterly realistic? Nope. Is that completely ideal? Nope.    
But it would work and it would avoid placing each farm in a new instance, like entering the moonshine shack. So anyone in the lobby could interact with the farm, which I think should be a very important aspect of the whole idea."

What do I mean by that, isn't that the same, doofus? Well sure, I guess the terms can be used interchangibly, of course. For me, however, a ""Frontier Rancher"" role feels more like a kind of role that would evolve mainly around cattle. You know... managing a herd of cattle, driving them from A to B, driving them to the train pickup point in Flatneck Station or Valentine for sales, etc.

While the document includes raising small animals such as pigs and chicken, as well as actual agriculture. All things I, personally, would rather call a Farmer, than a Rancher.

Why am I making such a fuss about a damn word, for god's sake? Because ideally I'd love to have both as roles. A farmer role as described in this post AND an actual (cattle) Rancher role for managing a cattle herd."
single,feomqwi,t3_eq7fjn,1579302318.0,"Let me tell you something from experience, mate. I'm 34 now. And I feel you.

When I was around 17 I felt like you. I was very introverted at that time and it was about the time when my little group of male best friends kinda ""grew up"". Like we were a tight-knit group of neighborhood kids that were all about the same age (literally) and had been together pretty much since birth.

Then came the teenage years and everyone of them started with the first kisses, dating experiences, yada yada. Like two of my friends (twin guys) kept bringing home bloody gorgeous girls. They started going to the disco, drink alcohol, the whole boom boom.

Except of me. I have a memory of me literally standing at my room's window like a cheesy creep in movies, looking down on the street and seeing these 2 twin guys leaving home with 2 hot girls in their arms. I stood there at the window, cried and wished so hard I had that, too. Like I hadn't even really kissed any girl, yet.

It was before online dating, you know. So if you wanted a girl, you had to be insanely lucky to meet one through chat rooms or you had to actually go out in the real world and talk to girls. I couldn't do that, I just couldn't. And when I tried, I got rejected. So I gave up.

At this point I assume I felt like you feel right now.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But here is the thing, mate. Back then I thought like you. ""I am so lonely, I tried everything, it just won't work, I am so scared to die alone, etc, I just want to die anyway, life sucks.""

Because there was something I just, like you, could not comprehend at that young age. And that was patience. And that with 16, or like you, 20, one is so insanely young (even if it doesn't feel so), that there is more than pleeeenty of time to change everything. And that time WILL come.

I mean it did for me at some point, too. I met my first actual girlfriend ever at the age of 21. By coincedence via Skype (LDR). Sure that relationship didn't work out but it changed me. From there on something happened with me and I became more extroverted, I started to go out and consequently I met many women. So I met more girls, I got laid more and more often, I had frequent shorter ""relationships"", I had dozens and dozens of dates. In short: I became very active and easily racked up some numbers (by whatever means) over the next few years.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

What I am trying to say is: Right now you may think that you are ""already"" 20 and haven't kissed a girl yet, and it sucks and you just want to get out of the lonliness. I feel you. But I promise you, I very promise you: Soon enough there will be a point in time when your life changes and you meet a nice girl that likes you back.  And then things will naturally pick up and 5 or 7 years from now, you will look back and smile. I promise. And I mean you're 20, mate. 5 or 7 years from now is NOTHING. I know it does feel significant right now, but it really isn't. Just don't give up, be patient and your love life WILL pick up.

I also totally understand and agree with you about these thoughts of envy for people with a busy life. I feel you. Me being so depressive, that I wasn't able to work for the past 4 years (and still am not), I really do. 

Whenever I meet new people and we're scheduling to go out, I feel like I need to hide the fact, that I have a lot of time sitting at home. I feel so embarassed that I'm always the one saying like ""Yeah any time works, it's not like I have anything at all going on in my life...""

I feel so envious to those people with a full schedule. Ack.. I don't know. It's just that in a way I feel like a busy schedule is some sort of a status symbol, too. A busy schedule means you have a full job (=money), a lot of people in your life who want to spend time with you, etc.

You know what I mean?"
dating,fenhh72,t3_eq325h,1579284784.0,"Honestly... at some point in life I stopped with some sort of strict ""dating etiquette"". I just go by the flow with most things. I don't really have many set ""guidelines"" or ""rules"" for that anymore.

In terms of kissing, sex, etc. I'll go with the flow - what happens, happens, if not - it's fine. Although, if none of this happens by like the third or so date, then I don't consider this going anywhere and will most likely bail and move on.

In regards to being exclusive, I'm kind of old-fashioned and usually don't date more than one woman at a time. But I wouldn't expect for my date to be exclusive, as well, up to the point of serious making out or sex.

I do agree with u/PRW63 on  his ""1."" Once I match with a girl through online dating or make an aquaintance in RL, I don't want to keep chatting for weeks before the next step. I want to, at least, exchange numbers and start talking on phone every couple days, after matching. If it doesn't match, it'll most likely come out during that time.

If it still matches when occasionally talking on phone every couple days, I'll expect for a first actual date to happen within a week or so. That kinda sorts out the next type of girls - those ""always super busy girls, who want a partner but don't really have the time in their life to dedicate to one"". I don't need that. If suggesting a date gets me the reply of ""oh sure, I'd love to.. let me see.. I have an opening in my schedule for 2 hours Friday night in 3 weeks from today"", then I'm out at that point. No thanks.

When it comes to ""how much time between dates"" - I don't have a strict rule. It shouldn't be too soon, unless it's going reeeeally, really, really well. But it also shouldn't be weeks away, because then - naturally - both will lose interest in this early stage and it'll go nowhere."

RedDeadOnline,fddcb7g,t3_ekhnzf,1578305337.0,"That's a vey interesting survey. And the results are even more interesting.

My revolver usage goes as follows:    
I always carry around a set of LeMats and a set of Navys. The Navys are loaded with express rounds and I mostly select them only when going into fights with NPCs. The LeMats are usually selected by default and charged with explosive rounds, so I can react to PVP anytime.    
While design-wise I like the Navys more to go with my outfits, the LeMats are powerful enough for PVP and - that's my crucial point - load 9 rounds, rather than 6. So with explosive rounds loaded, I have 3 more bullets per gun in PVP, with an already powerful cartridge.

Longarms-wise I play like this:    
I'll always carry around my Carcano, to be able to snipe long distance, if needed. I just prefer it over the Rolling-Block in PVP for the faster firing rate. I don't have the best mouse, so I'm not a terribly good sniper.    
Additionally I will always have either my Lancaster ready with express ammo, along with the aforementioned Navys, for NPCS. If I expect PVP (e.g. wagon train escorts), I'll switch the Lancaster for my Litchfield with short scope, loaded with Explosive ammo. The Litchfield has greater range and slightly better punch.

&#x200B;

Tldr: For NPCs I use Navys and Lancaster with Express ammo, for PVP I use my LeMats and Litchfield with Explosive ammo."

RedDeadOnline,fd1pzuv,t3_ejulpo,1578135001.0,"My personal ""threshold"" when escorting a wagon delivery with a posse is ""weapon drawn or not"" and ""single player or posse(leader)"". 

Even if someone is rushing towards our wagon - if he's a posse-less player and has no weapons drawn at all, he's good. But he will be observed and rest assured, I have my quick draw ready. If he draws anything, his corpse will be cold before it even drops to the ground.

Another thing is posse players. If there is a blue guy rushing towards the wagon and he's a member of a posse, or worse, posse leader - no chances taken. Even unarmed, the guy will be dead before he gets anywhere near the wagon. And we know if someone is in a posse and which and where and why and whatnot, because we scan the player list constantly & know who ""Person X"" is, that is rushing towards us, before they even saw our wagon.

Needless to say, that all doesn't matter when it comes to red players. Red players of whatever sort will be sniped as soon as they pop up on the wagon train radar. If you're red, you've killed players before and then you have no mercy or ""benefit of the doubt"" to expect. As simple as that. You chose to become red, you deal with the consequences, Mister Wannabe Outlaw.

Long story short: I'm personally for de-escalation most of the time and avoid firing the first shot. Often enough people proof harmless and just randomly shooting them ""to be sure"" only makes them furious (understandibly) and then they will give chase as retaliation. And it takes so few to blow up a wagon. Nonetheless it's always important for the escorting posse to have eyes on anyone near the wagon and be a good enough shooter, to guarante that in 99% of the case, you can aim and kill the potential opponent faster than they could blow up the wagon in any possible way."

There was that ""girl"" standing pseudo afk near the Kerosine factory in the plains. I rode past her on my way to Valentine, when she suddenly reached for her carbine and aimed in my direction as I passed. Naturally she ate an explosive bullet from my LeMat within 0.2sec as I rode on.

Then a minute later on the overpass next to the train tracks near Valentine I had to check something in the player menu. Suddenly I hear hooves behind me. She approached from the rear in full gallop, rode past me and blasted her shotty in the back of my head as she passed me.

Naturally, again, I could of course not let that slide. So I chased her down and all the way right into the Valentine Gun Store where she then hid for a while. I stood guard at the door, my shotty with incendiary bullets ready to go. I got bored, so I spilled some flammable booze into the store and ""accidentally"" ignited it, leading a trace of fire into the gun store. Didn't make her come out, tho.

After waiting for a good while, I moved on. As fate wanted, next time I went back to Valentine for a resupply, about 20 minutes later, I stood near the Bounty Board when she suddenly left the gun store. Needless to say, within 1 second, before she could even gasp, she laid on the muddy ground, her body bursting up in flames from my incendiary shotgun pellets.

What ensued was a fierce but short shotgun vs shotgun battle throughout Valentine, during which the same happened to me as it happened to [PeasantMoustache](https://www.reddit.com/user/PeasantMoustache/): My char attempted to climb a backyard fence to reach her but stumbled, then rubberbanded and gave her the chance to blast a slug into my face.

I was indecisive for a long time and kept using both, sometimes still do. They both have their pros and cons in their stats. I just eventually decided, in order to keep maintenance simple, to just stick to one. I chose the Springy, for the very reasons that others stated here. I kinda like the handling of the bolt better, too but the Springy has a bit faster reload and better punch with Xpress ammo.

In fact I rarely use them at all anyway. It is mainly my ""backup weapon"", which I have in my hands when riding through cougar/bear/wolf territories. That way I can (w/o using the attached scope) 1-shot-kill them closeby when shit hits the fan and yet keep their stars with single-shot-headshots. The Springy is essentially the weapon with the best punch amongst the rifles that don't force a scope upon you."
