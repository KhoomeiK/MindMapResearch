PoliticalHumor,ffk84a0,t1_ffk7zae,1580018521.0,Here’s one for you.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_Nations
PoliticalHumor,ffk79r1,t1_ffk6hgi,1580018087.0,"That’s funny my degree is in economics and I work as a data analyst in corporate.  

You can pity me all you want.  At least I don’t try to go up my own ass to justify a system that has been a disaster.  It’s not as complicated as you think.  Anytime you concentrate power with no accountability abuse is going to happen.  It doesn’t matter if it’s in corporations or the government in the end you end up with an authoritarian shit hole ran by an elite to benefit the elite"
PoliticalHumor,ffk5qhr,t1_ffk4vfy,1580016742.0,Maybe you should read a book and instead of plaxing everything out.  You can try to over complicate things all you want.  There are plenty of shit holes that don’t have American sanctions.  When you study the history of economies you realize pretty much since the beginning of civilizations the people in charge always made the rules to benefit themselves.  See you don’t have to read Why Nations Fail.  I broke it down in one sentence
PoliticalHumor,ffk4bi8,t1_ffk3uh0,1580015417.0,"Venezuela is a shithole because the elite extract wealth from the economy and people in power put their buddies in power.  Such as putting Rick Perry in charge of the Department Of Energy.

I see no difference between Russia Cuba and Venezuela.  A group of elite make economic decisions to enrich them and their cronies.  The only difference is the propaganda"
PoliticalHumor,ffk3ngm,t1_ffk37ve,1580014806.0,Ok you can argue all you want.  All the economists say it was a market based solution.  You can go ahead and join the MAGAtards and tell experts they are wrong.  Full horseshoe theory of stupid
PoliticalHumor,ffk33kx,t1_ffk2zml,1580014318.0,They set the goal the companies implemented it
PoliticalHumor,ffk1dbh,t1_ffjtibv,1580012822.0,Well you can argue with the economists.  I wrote my thesis on a greenhouse gas cap and trade modeled after  it.
PoliticalHumor,ffk0pid,t1_ffjst34,1580012250.0,"Lol, yeah keep on pushing the no true Scotsman.  Cuba is going to suck no matter what because it’s ran by a bunch of cronyist who make decisions what is based on their best interests and not others.  You know why capitalists economies will always destroy authoritarian economies because the strong and best ideas make it to the top and not what is best for who ever is in charge.  That’s why Russia, Cuba and Venezuela sucks not because of the US"
PoliticalHumor,ffjt1zz,t1_ffjscvf,1580006174.0,Actually it was a market based solution that stopped acid rain https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_Rain_Program.
PoliticalHumor,ffjrunn,t1_ffjp4bt,1580005252.0,It was market based solution that pretty much ended acid rain and could do the same thing with green house gases.  Markets make better solutions than some bureaucrat who got their job because the knew the right people

politics,ffjebmi,t3_ets1it,1579996461.0,More like R Kelly
PoliticalHumor,ffikgez,t1_ffhvo40,1579976013.0,The economy is doing good despite Trump.  We are running a massive deficit which is artificially increasing the economy.  The trade war has increased cost.  The farm bailout has gone pass the 2008 auto bail out and we will never get that money back.  While the stock market is great for the rich education and healthcare costs are still out of control.  Trump refuses to do anything about global warming and has rolled back pollution standards
