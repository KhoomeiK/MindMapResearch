TooAfraidToAsk,ff7s4r9,t1_ff7rseg,1579657027.0,"Those are all very valid points, I think if everybody looked at it that way then there would be much less violence against trans people. Keeping an open mind and and open heart are both very important in dating, no matter what."
TooAfraidToAsk,ff7ozdd,t1_ff63zni,1579654829.0,"i think that's a pretty safe way to go about it, for sure. i honestly think this subject is very interesting, with all of the talk about the science behind attraction and all that. where i differ in opinions with you is when it comes to not pointing out prejudice, for fear of making them defensive. of course i'm not going to all out say something attacking them for it, but more of a gentle ""huh, did you hold any negative opinions about trans people as a general group before this happened? do you think that affected your choice?"" i think on some level it's just about as shallow as turning someone down because they are 5'9 instead of 6'3, or if their dick or tits are too small. if a hookup is what that person wants, then whatever, no shame in wanting to bang the perfect person from their fantasies. but if they were genuinely starting to fall in love with a person for their personality and not exclusively their body, and then turned them down because of their opinions on trans people as a group, then that would be undoubtedly a kind of shitty and shallow thing to do. i dunno, i might be prejudiced myself, though it's kind of hard not to be when trans people like me are killed each year because of their dates feeling deceived. transparency is always extremely important, especially for trans people because without it they could be hurt or put at risk for violence."

TooAfraidToAsk,ff62v69,t1_ff62440,1579617748.0,"I mean like, if they had all surgeries AND passed, two different things. Some people can pass without surgery, and some people don’t exactly “pass” even with surgical intervention. After that, I think it comes down to a couple things. If a woman was to become attracted to a man, and they go out on a date and are enjoying themselves, and then all of a sudden the man says “I feel like I should tell you, I’m transgender. I’ve had all the surgeries, and I’m 10 years on hormone therapy.” And then the woman immediately loses interest, it raises the question of why that would be? I don’t like saying extreme things, but it could be prejudice. I wish I could say it isn’t any of my business, but if I found out that a trans friend was dumped because they were trans even though they are genetically the gender the person they were dumped by expected them to be, I would be inclined to avoid that person for my own safety. 
In the end, not enough research has been done on the subject, and I don’t know enough outside of my own experience and reasoning to make a concrete argument."

TooAfraidToAsk,ff583i2,t3_erl3o2,1579583010.0,"tbh, i think that it depends. if you've got a genital preference then whatever, everybody kind of does to a point. but if somebody's refusing to date a fully transitioned, all surgeries, completely passing transgender woman or man just because of their past, i think that's a bit fucked. but what it comes down to is that nobody can force anybody to stop or start being attracted to someone. i've dealt with some people like that who just have no perspective at all, and i think that in the end it's none of their business who you fuck, especially since theyre just some person on facebook."

ftm,fetqo2s,t1_fepxpnn,1579378474.0,"no, i'm not a troll. i'm saying that trans guys don't have to identify with these terms if they don't want to, especially since they are common stereotypes that are pushed on trans guys. no flack to anybody who does choose to identify with these for personal reasons, but when these terms are used to generally describe trans guys (which has happened to me, and other trans guys i know, usually by ignorant people) it becomes harmful. all i'm saying is that generalization of the ftm trans community is harmful since we are all individuals. this post was more targeted towards younger trans guys just figuring themselves out. i wish i didnt know about these terms, but i've had them applied to me personally."
ftm,fetq4vb,t1_feque59,1579378265.0,"it's a stereotype that i've seen pushed on trans guys. like ""cuffs his jeans, wears khakis and button up shirts with graphic tees under them,"" which i definitely DONT do, but i've seen a ""trans guy starter pack"" meme saying that is true and that pissed me off and i know other trans guys who don't identify with that at all so i thought it would be worth saying."

that being said, i can sympathize with ftms in environments even less accepting than mine who use these terms for themselves with a way to reclaim and cope with the circumstances they have to live in, and bring their identity closer to the lie they have to live to survive. but the usage of those terms for people who have not explicitly said that they are okay with it is just downright scummy."
