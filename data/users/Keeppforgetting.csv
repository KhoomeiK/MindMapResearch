California,fffnlxm,t3_et288f,1579887824.0,Whatever. Vaping is annoying AF and it’s not exactly healthy either. I say tax it.
rupaulsdragrace,fffif46,t3_etbtg3,1579884641.0,Honestly not really into her. Would be a swipe left from me.
aww,fffhv2i,t3_et9nmq,1579884300.0,Nope. I still haven’t seen one.
bigdickproblems,fff2sdo,t3_esft5z,1579874154.0,This is not true for gay men. Knowing beforehand what the size of the penis is can help a lot in terms of prep work and knowing what you’re getting into. If you don’t know how big the guy is you’re almost asking for an accident to happen.
nottheonion,ffdy6d9,t1_ffdwevk,1579831857.0,"Of course everyone deserves representation. That’s why there are *representatives.* Judges are not supposed to represent the people, they’re  supposed to uphold and interpret the law. They’re not supposed represent any sort of ideology."
nottheonion,ffdtcdm,t1_ffdsiy9,1579828423.0,Ok that’s great but the courts aren’t supposed to be equal in ideology. Judges are supposed to be impartial. How would having them come from different districts make them more impartial? Impartiality can come from anywhere. The reasons they’re listing are not good enough.
