lego,ff4yh3w,t3_erl3ep,1579575489.0,I’m always interested in learning about other people’s characters. What’s the story behind all these characters?
PS4,ff4c6kx,t3_erkax5,1579560168.0,"It’s cool to see how far we’ve come. I have fond memories of playing RE3 at a friend’s house, so I’m excited to see what this new one has in store!"
gentlemanboners,ff2xnwk,t1_fez9ju4,1579527909.0,"Haha, I know, but the design of the area definitely strikes me as looking very “prison-like”."
gentlemanboners,feycxhc,t3_eqvav7,1579443916.0,It kinda looks like she’s going to prison.
wholesomememes,feycl2e,t3_eqvyke,1579443782.0,"Kinda reminds me of a recent event where I was eyeing the game Bloodborne, but was really indecisive about whether to buy it or not. One of my parents saw me looking at it, and then a month later, they gifted it to me for Christmas. That really felt good."
Spiderman,felxnfs,t3_eptwd8,1579233539.0,"Every Spider-Man portrayal has a lot of positive elements, and each version does a lot to make themselves stand out. I enjoy all of them regardless."

DnD,feirkye,t3_epcsyz,1579145429.0,I enjoy emotional tales like this. I would be happy to have a group like this!
patientgamers,fefujvr,t3_eowy3v,1579065655.0,"Off the top of my head, Spider-Man has been bringing me the most joy. I always have the biggest grin on my face when playing it, and there’s something about swinging around New York that makes me feel nostalgic for when I was a child who was obsessed with superheroes."
Terraria,feftpic,t3_eows69,1579064899.0,"It’s cool to see you put a lot of time into Terraria. It’s one of those games where I genuinely lose track of time when I play. 

Unrelated, but I think I’m more surprised by how many hours you put into Sekiro! That’s really cool honestly. I haven’t played it myself, but glad you see you put a lot of time into it."
lego,feck13n,t3_eofr7i,1578975796.0,Saturday night’s alright for building!
PS4,fecj7js,t3_eofdro,1578975220.0,It honestly looks like a really interesting game that’s totally up my alley. I dig the atmosphere and tone it’s going for. Maybe when I’m not bogged down by school work I can finally give Control a shot
flicks,feciuwv,t3_eoeyrz,1578974981.0,I started watching Jodorowsky’s Dune. It’s definitely interesting to see what his plans were for his Dune movie that eventually never got made.

CasualConversation,fdx1byd,t3_en8o1v,1578764269.0,I don’t have any siblings but my mom is especially kind to my aunt (who is the younger sister) and they always reach out and call each other every week due to the distance.
CasualConversation,fdwrdai,t1_fdumon1,1578761593.0,For me I just really love the Sith in the old EU. They’re definitely a complex group of force users.
characterdrawing,fdtsg6w,t3_en2zn1,1578721486.0,"What’s the story behind Rahz, if you don’t mind me asking?"
CasualConversation,fdts1w8,t3_en2lz5,1578721313.0,"I’m a big fan of Star Wars lore, and have even written out a story about a group of outlaws based in the Star Wars mythos.

I love Halo’s story, and I’ve been slowly getting back into the games.

Nier is also another series I absolutely adore, and the lore in both the original game, and its successor Automata have some of the deepest and impressive storylines I’ve seen in a video game."
batman,fdp6y07,t3_emj86q,1578621434.0,Very atmospheric

criterion,fdgq4mx,t3_elayj4,1578405375.0,"I was hoping this film got a physical release like Roma! I’m glad it’s finally confirmed, because I loved this movie, and I’m happy I get a chance to physically own it!"

criterion,fdcl9gd,t3_ekmfdu,1578277702.0,"Man, I’ve wanted to get this film on Criterion for the longest time. It’s just one of my favourites, and I dunno, it just really speaks to me in a really personal way."
Celebs,fdbz6j1,t3_ekdzks,1578264130.0,Putting her hands behind her head like she’s getting arrested!
StarWars,fda4mf2,t3_ekdytc,1578241588.0,"I’m generally someone who loves the “those two guys” trope, and it’s especially fun when those two characters work really well off each other like with these two troopers."
gamemusic,fda4bn9,t3_ekeak0,1578241457.0,"Wow, that’s awesome! This seems like a really cool opportunity! Congrats on getting to compose for the game! I’m looking forward to listening to more of your work!"

criterion,fcrr3wv,t3_eilbop,1577905483.0,Tree of Life and LEGO set building is a combination I didn’t know I needed.
wholesomememes,fcnfgyf,t3_ei3zop,1577810632.0,"Yes, I really want to start this year off by just being more positive overall. I’m tired of being negative!"

wholesomememes,fcc5tpz,t3_eh11tk,1577594746.0,"Reminds me of a smaller streamer I used to watch. He would stream Stardew Valley regularly (and even got me interested in the game) and I would typically ask questions and just say anything that was on my mind regarding the game, and he was happy to converse with me since the stream didn’t have too many viewers. That experience felt really “interactive” in a way."
lego,fcc4hj5,t1_fc2cvid,1577594312.0,"Thanks! I do love me some Star Wars sets, but I’ve always had a soft spot for Batman, and this Batmobile is just so cool!"
