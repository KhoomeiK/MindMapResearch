todayilearned,ff2m72n,t1_ff2hinv,1579512837.0,"His story is far more interesting than that. The shooting was only the culmination of much more interesting events.

I mean, the movie Get Rich or Die Tryin' was essentially a biography right? 

Where do I even begin?

50 Cent's mom really was a prostitute, or at least involved with Kenneth ""Supreme"" McGriff's organization, and was murdered by them. Most likely her involvement was in some form of drug running or preparing the drug packages.

Growing up in Queens, 50 Cent knew or knew of Ja Rule before he made it big.

Ja Rule grows up, becomes a rapper, and gets together with Irv Gotti a few years before 50 Cent, who was a minor drug dealer, while aspiring to build a rap career with Bang 'Em Smurf doing management stuff for him.

Ja Rule hits it big by getting on singles with Jay-Z and DMX after he hooks up with Irv Gotti, who was friends or at least some sort of business associate of Kenneth ""Supreme"" McGriff working together while McGriff tried to get into the entertainment business.

50 Cent gets on a single with Onyx in 1998, with an appearance on their 'Shut Em Down' album. Then he makes his famous 'How to Rob' single for his debut Power of the Dollar, where he goes down a list of rappers, stating how he's going to rob them. Pissing off nearly the entire industry.  The only person that would work with him at that time was Jam Master Jay from Run DMC, who produces his initial work on Power of the Dollar.  During production of Power of the Dollar, 50 Cent was the target of a hit by McGriff, but survived b/c he wasn't in the studio that day.  Jam Master Jay was, and was murdered as a result.

Most the biggest artists in the rap industry meanwhile were returning disses to 50 Cent at this time and he was essentially blackballed.  Power of the Dollar was released as a mixtape. And 50 Cent began generating some buzz for his song-making abilities. During this time, he started moving away from Bang Em Smurf and forming his own crew of unknown Queens artists, Lloyd Banks and Tony Yayo. Loyal aspiring rappers who would go on to form the core of his rap crew, G-Unit.

G-Unit, together with 50 Cent begin making mixtapes in 50 Cent's basement, producing their own beats and using other artists beats to release mixtapes that are akin to albums in their quality and original production. This was the first time this was done in the industry, whereas previous mixtapes were released through DJ's, who controlled that aspect of the industry, and were releasing unreleased songs with the DJ's shouting themselves and the artists out over the songs.  50 Cent and G-Unit bypassed this and were producing mixtapes and releasing them themselves to generate their own buzz.

In these mixtapes, 50 Cent was taking subliminal shots throughout at Kenneth ""Supreme"" McGriff, while taking not-so-subtle shots at Ja Rule, who was now famous for his guest appearances with big artists like Jay-Z and DMX (almost forming a group with them called Murder Inc.). Ja Rule's group efforts with Jay-Z and DMX fell through when he began growing closer to Irv Gotti and McGriff, and egos got in the way.  Ja Rule and DMX began beefing. Meanwhile, Irv Gotti was running a new label ""Murder Inc Records"" with Ja Rule as their main artist, and McGriff bankrolling them, with rumours that it was being used primarily as a money laundering scheme.

While 50 Cent and Ja Rule beef pops off during 50's mixtape era, Kenneth ""Supreme"" McGriff puts out another hit against 50 Cent to take him out, in part for the previous missed hit and partly because 50 Cent was directly impacting Murder Inc Records' ability to make money by turning hip hop fans against Ja Rule and his style of R&B/Rap hybrid songs. 

50 Cent gets shot 5x in the face, but miraculously survives and comes back stronger than ever with the disses. He also generates interest from an artist based out of Detroit by the name of Eminem, who had a lot of buzz himself and was good friends with a super producer by the name of Dr. Dre. 

The same year (2003) that 50 Cent releases his industry debut, Get Rich Or Die Tryin', an album that goes diamond and turns the entire industry on its head, Murder Inc Records get raided by the FBI for money laundering. There are rumours that 50 Cent may have been an informant or gave tips to the FBI to strengthen their evidence for the raid, Kenneth Supreme McGriff as a result, gets indicted, eventually going to jail in 2007.  During that time, rappers in the industry align with Ja Rule against 50 Cent, who was continuing to diss other artists as part of his embracing a villainous role in the hip hop industry. Rappers, such as Fat Joe and Jadakiss, along with the rest of The Lox, put out numerous diss songs over the next couple years, focusing on calling 50 Cent a snitch.  During that time, 50 Cent puts out the most anticipated follow-up album to a debut since the Notorious BIG, quickly selling over 5 million records, setting more industry records.

Ja Rule's career begins fading now that Murder Inc Records was all but disbanded, and basically all but retired from making hip hop, with a couple subsequent releases that were lacklustre and barely noticed. The beef with The Lox and Fat Joe sort of dies out, though The Lox continued taking aim at him in one way or another for a few more years. In the meantime, 50 Cent had taken a Dr. Dre Aftermath signee into his G-Unit group while Tony Yayo was serving time, in The Game. Game releases a highly anticipated debut under G-Unit records, an affiliate of Eminems' Shady Records, which itself is an affiliate of Aftermath Records, which itself is an affiliate of Interscope Records.

The result is that 50 Cent makes a ton of money off Game's album. Game gets into a fight with 50 Cent and leaves the group, begins dissing 50 Cent, who responds on his mixtapes about how he owns The Game's career because he controls Game's album budget. The beef continues for a while, mostly pushed by Game, before it begins dying off after an intervention by Louis Farrakhan.

50 Cent meanwhile puts out some more albums, but it lacks the hunger that his first album and second album had. During this time, he invests in an upstart drink company called Vitamin Water.  Confident in his ability to sell records, he challenges another upstart rapper named Kanye West to an album-selling competition after they realize their albums are coming out on the same day.  50 Cent says he'll retire from hip hop if Kanye outsells him in the first week.  Kanye does. 50 Cent doesn't retire, but begins moving away from music. Around this time, a little known company named Coca-Cola buys Vitamin Water, a sale that nets 50 Cent over $100 million, and 50 Cent begins his slow move away from hip hop music and into a producer, using that money to fund his production company, where he now produces a show on Starz called 'Power', which has been overall well-received by critics."

I got my interview (tomorrow, actually), at a program that responded to my letter of interest. It was a chance for me to share more information about my interests. Stuff that I couldn't really fit into my personal statement.  And it's a program that I didn't expect to receive a reply from, just based on their reputation and criteria. But sometimes you find a fit, and like I mentioned before, you never know what will pique a programs' interest.

I got my response back 6 weeks later. 

Sometimes you just have to give it everything you got. 

I might end up in the same position as OP, but, hey, all it takes is that one program to rank you high. 

I should also add that attending large conferences is usually a plus too. You can literally meet with program directors and other influential staff that can put in a good word for you. Just make sure to followup after the conference with an email and stay in touch with everyone you met (this means getting cards and pamphlets).

Also, with my letters of interest, I attached the most up-to-date version of my CV."
medicalschool,fefelbz,t1_fef9cv4,1579054669.0,"I'm an IMG. I got one interview, and that's late in the season. Your advice is exactly what I'd give him. 

Additionally, I'd probably recommend to /u/asks_for_milkshakes for this season, that he still has SOAP. So it's not all over. In addition, he could look into residency swap.

I'd also recommend for him to send out letters of interest. Like, a lot of them. Not just to his top choice programs, but to nearly all of them. Obviously, not the same letter across the board, but having a decent skeleton that he can tailor to each program as to why he's interested in that program, it would help.  You never know who's interest you'll pique. (probably best to write these over the summer, and have them ready for submission by mid-October).

He should also keep a list of programs that offer auditions and their dates, and contact them for that option accordingly. 

He can check out residency swaps and look for programs outside the Match.

If he's looking for more USCE, and doesn't have any personal contacts that can help him get it somewhere, then perhaps applying for a research job or medical assistant (or some other job with clinical experience) at one of those hospitals.

Scribing is another good option for jobs. Perhaps he could directly contact the hospitals or physicians through email, or check Indeed.  There's a lot of scribing jobs available that are looking for immediate availability. Scribing provides experience with EMR systems, allows for the scribe to be in the room sometimes with the physician, writing the notes. It's also a pretty good networking opportunity if you can rub shoulders with the right people.

Research is a good option if he's interested in an academic residency program, or something more specialized than primary care. Could probably talk with someone who can help him do a systematic review or meta-analysis (these are pretty cost-efficient and require time more than anything else). Probably write some case reports and submit them to journals that have allow free submission.

And as you said, Step 3, more clinical experience, more applications, FM programs in IMG-friendly regions. 

Tutoring for the Steps is another good option to do in his spare time.  Doesn't have to be formal, through any organization, but ithat would obviously help.

Maybe write articles on some of his more interesting experiences for newsletters or local newspapers. Get his ideas and name out there. Residency applications are about selling yourself as a candidate. 

If he's able/willing to pay, then there are organizations that setup externships.

If it was something in his application, there are multiple companies online that look through your application and personal statement to help you improve the quality, if there was a potential issue there."
