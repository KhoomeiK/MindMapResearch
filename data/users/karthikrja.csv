KidsAreFuckingStupid,fg6sj1v,t1_fg6ro1x,1580575884.0,"I kinda feel like i deserved that. Now that when i see other parents do the same i realised that they are not actually hitting the kid ( like causing pain ) neither did my parents. Its basically mothers moving quickly with their angry face, making the kid believe that they are actually getting hit and its pain. They don't actually show their whole strength to the kid. They barely touch the kid and the kid goes high pitch screaming. Its hilarious to see now

The wholesome part is after this the mother sit down with the kid calms down him and explain him why he shouldn't do what he did.

Its like a parenting technique in my culture. Dads are reserved for extreme conditions like the hammer in a ""break in case of danger"" box in a big buildings"
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fg6rke3,t1_fg6qxlx,1580575251.0,"You are right!

KidsAreFuckingStupid,fg6r82e,t1_fg6oynb,1580575026.0," My parents never went to the extent of causing me any severe damage. Infact i was never afraid of pain because of pain its rather them seeing in their angry face and emotions that made me realise that what i did was wrong

My mom after hitting me calm down me and teach what i did wrong why it was wrong. And then she tells me if i did something good or right, i would appreciate you and show my love but at the same when you do something wrong or disrespectful i would punish you similarly"
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fg6nkbl,t3_ex5z5s,1580572563.0,"As a non american and an southern asian (indian), do parents in America or in any other western countries won't beat their kid if they do something like that

I don't know know what happens in real life. From what i seen from american movies parents never hit their children. I know its rather falls under child abuse or domestic violence. But you can't raise a child property or respectful without hitting them when its necessary.

My mom used to beat the crap out of me whenever i do stupid or disrespectful. When i reach the extreme, then my dad would just slap and it would hard reset me for like atleast 6 months. Once i past 13 or 14 they stopped hitting me because i started being mature. This is usual in other asian countries too

Seeing a lot of posts from this subreddit like this make me cringe immediately. Are kids this violent and disrespectful?

And i also came across so many comments saying they hate kids. Which is surprising for me because i like kids. I've never seen someone genuinely admit they hate kids. But seeing this i does understand the root of the problem"

instantkarma,fg4a6yy,t1_fg49fzy,1580499428.0,"So that's it. A woman or man hit you in the public infront of 100s of people and you walk away because you are an adult. Every has different emotional state. 

Again i am not saying that he should hit the woman. If he was assaulted at first, then i won't be judging his actions.

If a man hits a women she hits him back, it doesn't matter if she is weaker or stronger than the. So should you ask her to walk away? because apparently that's what adults are supposed to do"

Verbal abuse and bitchslap are still an assault. Just because we don't show our  emotions and pains explicitly doesn't gives you the right to ""bitch slap"" or ""verbally abuse"" a man"
instantkarma,fg47cci,t1_fg3yx50,1580497681.0,"Okay, so why do you think a random guy would punch a random girl in her face at what seems to be a public gathering? Obviously he is very well aware that he is surrounded by people and they will beat the crap out of him if he assault a woman in front of them. He did hit her despite all of this. I am not gonna believe that he hit a random girl out of no reason

That's why i asked for the full video.

It seems like something happened between the boy and girl, then he argued and then he assaulted her.

But the video starts from the end of an argument. So you can't quickly judge the scenario.

If she did hit him in the 1st place, then its definitely offence and he has every right react the way he did.
