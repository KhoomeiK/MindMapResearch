One interesting paper I ran across recently detailed how it would be theoretically possible to passively co-opt the Starlink network as a passive radar system. Since the Starlink network will be constantly beaming down microwave radio signals at very specific frequencies from space to Earth, you could conceivably build a radio receiver system that listens for echos of those signals bouncing off of flying objects and thereby triangulate their positions. Like a typical radar system, but without the need for a transmitter (as Starlink's already doing that) and it will only ""see"" objects reflecting in the Ka/Ku bands."

Because, if the ground station [GS] is any further away than that, there is going to be a point when your [UFO]-on-a-stick or the [GS] are in the footprint of an overhead satellite but the satellite is no longer in communication with the other end [UFO|GS].

To have both the [GS] and your [UFO] in the same footprint of a single satellite, the ground station will have to be no more than half the footprint away.
