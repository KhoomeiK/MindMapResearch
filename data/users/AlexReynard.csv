Certainly. There's nothing that can't be improved. I took issue with her calling them ""primitive"" and saying intelligence itself can't be measured.

Sure we can. I can measure your eyesight, vocabulary, blood alcohol level, all sorts of stuff.

This is more my irritation with a *lot* of stories I've seen where women aren't held to the same standards of agency as men. Once I started noticing 'woman takes no direct action; things work out for her anyway', it was everywhere. Or, just as common, 'woman takes negative action, and without taken further positive action to resolve the situation, things work out for her anyway.'

She is also dead wrong about IQ being primitive. It's exhaustively studied. And she's dead wrong about bias. Many tests don't even have words, they're just increasingly-complex sequences of patterns. Literally anyone of any culture or age can take this test without any bias interfering, only the measurement of their ability to adapt their thinking to understand new situations.

Also she is DEAD WRONG about everything she said about gender. Why in the hell would you use other animals as examples to try and disprove *human* sexual dimorphism!? That's like saying humans aren't poisoned by cyanide because owls aren't. Different species have different degrees of sexual dimorphism. And in human beings, men and women have differently-structured brains, due to how hormones act on the developing fetus in utero. Men have a higher ratio of grey matter to white matter, women have a higher ratio of white matter to grey matter. This is objective reality (and why transgenderism can be verified on MRI). In fact, her statements are even dumber here due to the fact that, despite the different structures of male and female brains, *there is no substantial difference between average male and female intelligence.* She could have just said THAT.

The biggest difference is that, since men are bigger risk-takers in general, it just means that more women are in the center of the bell curve, and a greater percentage of men will be at the really smart AND really stupid ends. Even then, that is ONLY describing general trends across entire populations. It absolutely does not mean that women can't be geniuses, as Alexis proves right here.
