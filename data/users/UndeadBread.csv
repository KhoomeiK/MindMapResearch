No idea why he didn't ask a local library or how he even knows about our little branch, unless he just mailed out a bunch of these to different libraries throughout the state to increase his chances.  Anyway, I was told to just ignore it, but part of me feels bad for not helping someone who wants to seek out information and is seemingly unable to do so.  At the same time...I looked up the stuff he requested and it would be over 100 pages of material once printed.  We charge for print-outs and I think it's safe to say that he won't be paying the fee (plus the shipping).  We wouldn't waive the fee for any regular patron and I don't see why this should be any different.

As much as I feel compelled to help this guy out, I don't think I'll fulfill his request because I don't feel that I should give a special exception to someone in prison.  But should I send him a letter to let him know?  Or should I do as my supervisor said and flat-out ignore it?"

In California, we don't have this nonsense.  No matter what, minimum wage is either $12 or $13 (depending on how many employees there are).  Despite this, people still treat you like an asshole if you don't tip servers.  This doesn't make sense.  Someone working at a big chain restaurant is going to make at least $13 per hour.
