Unlawful doesn't mean it isn't state-sanctioned, though. 

For example, the CIA wanted to stage false-flag attacks on the American populace to start a war on Cuba, which JFK refused to approve.

My advice:

Equip Enemy Radar.

For the first part, go high. Stand on a tower and hop down when convenient. Easy peasy.

For the second part, stay low. It's easy to get the ones on the ground. Then wait for the two on the walkway to face the same direction, jump up and strike from behind.

The last part is the hardest. Bullet jump from the end of the second area to the far right edge of the third area and take out the enemy there. Then immediately the one patrolling the back edge, and the one on that little raised platform. By that point two will be walking close together toward the second area with their back toward you--kill them, then there's only one left, easy enough to get.

I fucking *hated* this test, and I wish they would make practice MR tests so that you could restart without leaving/reloading into the area (would that be so hard, DE? If you need to restart you have to wait through two loading screens and unskippable dialogue from Lotus!) This test definitely sucks ass but once you have the rhythm it's... Doable.

Another thing--move *fast*. Get a weapon with fast executions, and remember that standard melee kills are still silent provided the enemy is taken unaware. And--the more time they have to walk around, the more likely you are to get spotted (especially the last area.)"
