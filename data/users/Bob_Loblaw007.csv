YouShouldKnow,ffaabuq,t1_ff9ft68,1579730981.0,"You notice it most when having a shower. You can't get the soap to lather up. As for taste, I find water tastes differently depending on it's source so I can't really say hard water tastes differently than soft all  the time, although sometimes soft water can be salty due to the softening process ( a salt brine is used to wash resin beads that collect the minerals in the water)."

YouShouldKnow,ff80om2,t1_ff7k45n,1579662937.0,"No. The anode rod is, as you probably know, is a sacrificial rod that erodes away with time, however the majority of the sediment is comprised of calcium. Minerals fall out of water when it's heated. In areas with extremely hard water, the calcium will form a hard crown on the bottom of the tank which results in a bubbling sound as the water underneath it boils and forms bubbles."

My eyesight isn't the greatest so the Mares really stands out for me. Easy to read, color coded. I watched a comparison video of the genius vs perdix and the perdix just looks like a jumble of numbers that I'd have to figure out while trying desperately to be neutrally buoyant. I'm surprised that all the comments from experienced divers recommend the perdix. I really expected them to go with the Mares."
