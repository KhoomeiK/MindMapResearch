bipolar,ffaifq8,t1_ff8jzpl,1579736488.0,"He is perfect, whether I’m up or down."
dogswithjobs,ffahy4e,t1_ff8bj08,1579736156.0,"I definitely agree that in most work places, it’s not necessarily appropriate to bring dogs. And I think a coworker’s health concerns or allergies should take precedence over personal pets. 

However! I work at an animal shelter, so, it couldn’t be an allergy-free workplace anyways :) Some animal shelter animals are housed in these same offices and all staff regularly work with dogs and cats, so it’s a bit of an unusual environment. 

(We also have an approved pets in the workplace policy that includes behavior, potty-training, noise, and workplace disruption.)"
dogswithjobs,ffahwrk,t1_ff7yxlg,1579736130.0,I have an office job at an animal shelter
dogswithjobs,ffahvvp,t1_ff8twek,1579736113.0,Ooh good to know! He hasn’t destroyed it yet but I’m sure he will soon.

dogswithjobs,ffahax1,t1_ff88fry,1579735728.0,Yes!
dogswithjobs,ffah9gw,t1_ff7mm5j,1579735701.0,"I agree that pet-friendly workplaces have a lot of perks! I know my pup is a stress-reliever for me as well as my coworkers. And I successfully quit smoking by replacing smoke breaks at work with walkies once I got this job!

Per the other comments on this thread, I agree that coworkers with allergies/phobias/etc, as well as questions of productivity, should always be considered before considering a pet-friendly workplace policy.

I happen to work at an animal shelter, however, so the entire workforce is very pet-friendly by the nature of the work we do."
dogswithjobs,ffafwf1,t1_ff8hzbn,1579734801.0,Umm actually there are three beds there :) though I don’t remember where they all came from. At least one was a gift when we got the job!

dogswithjobs,ff82juq,t1_ff80rvf,1579664304.0,"No, I adopted him from a shelter when he was about 2 months old. Someday I’ll spring for the doggie DNA test!"
dogswithjobs,ff826ji,t1_ff81j1u,1579664032.0,Oh it’s his. A coworker gave him the empty jar so he could lick it out.
dogswithjobs,ff7id1u,t1_ff7hvyr,1579650244.0,Neelix is the best. I wish I had a Neelix in my life to make me absolutely terrible food with all the love in the world.

dogswithjobs,ff7ge9s,t1_ff7g4sp,1579648940.0,He is very good. Every time we have a walk aka potty break we visit 2-4 offices on the way for pets.

NotMyJob,ff1ijdh,t1_ff0mr8h,1579479768.0,"Never heard of Aldi! This was at Fred Meyer on the west coast.

It was great though. Froze three and just ate the last one a month or so again. Fingers crossed for a similar deal this year! If so I can mail you one haha"
NotMyJob,fezxfny,t1_fewkl9a,1579462947.0,"I was buying corned beef for St Patrick’s day. Noticed that the prices as compared to weights were way off, throughout all the packages. Told the guy behind the counter and he just looked at me and said “I don’t care.”

Went home with 4 briskets for $7."

AskReddit,fdfcpqv,t3_ekt5n3,1578358602.0,"Yes. My boss regularly shows up 4 hours late, or not at all, so I have zero accountability for things like this.

And I hate it. I’ve become way more of a slacker knowing there’s no one who cares when I show up or what I do."
depression,fdfbtrr,t3_ekwbox,1578357999.0,"Yup. I call it the depression side of radical acceptance. This is how I am, this is who I am, and I’m better off accepting it as a fact and finding ways to be ok with it, then fighting a battle to beat something I’ll never win and being consistently disappointed in myself for failing."
bipolar,fdbz29o,t1_fdbufr1,1578264067.0,"I’m sorry to hear this is happening to you too.

I just don’t know what kind of help to get. I’ve talked about it with my psychiatrist and my counselor, but neither of them seem to be able to help pinpoint the cause. I’ve found seroquel to be the best thing to manage my bipolar...so I feel like unless I find an answer, I have to choose between managing my bipolar, and having this weird binge eating disorder."
