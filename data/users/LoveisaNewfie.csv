If his illness is so progressed that even with care they foresaw him going into nursing care within a month or so, they will likely discuss not only palliative management but hospice care. 

I am so sorry for you and your husband and the stress and heartbreak this is bringing up for you. Absolutely seek palliative care--they do not only focus on the physical management, but seek to provide you *all* the support you need when managing chronic or terminal illness, for the patient and caregivers/family."

I'd still check in with your vet if the diarrhea is ongoing, they at least have options to get it under control and rule out a few other things.

I'd really recommend (as a vet tech) a trip to the vet first, to rule out anything. Barring that, taking steps to make home less stressful. Feliway is good; making sure the cat has somewhere maybe only he, and not the kitten, can get to as well. Plenty of good resources about reducing cat stress online. Good luck!"
legaladvice,ff2fp0a,t1_ff2dnwc,1579504175.0,"Don't feel bad at all. This is really common when dealing with online marketplace/as-is sales. Generally it's considered buyer-beware, and that is why the buyer does due diligence and checks the product before taking possession and giving the money. If the phone worked when you sold it, and you disclosed any issues it may have had at the time and they bought it anyway, that's pretty much it. What happens to it after that is their problem, especially when it's because of their own misuse or negligence. (And often it's a total scam. Period.) You owe them nothing, not even your time. Only respond as appropriate if they were to somehow pursue anything legally, but I highly doubt they will."

Even though there is no will specifying who gets what based on Harvey's wishes, his estate (basically his assets minus any debts) still needs to be settled properly. An attorney can help you figure out who is legally entitled to what (most likely June, especially since he did not legally adopt Deborah) and you can move forward from there with attempting to get things worked out the way he wanted. But June is almost definitely going to need to be notified one way or another."

Consider some nice fabric shades for your windows. Art: find a couple pieces that you enjoy, that also coordinate with the color of the furniture, and then pull from it for your accessories.

legaladvice,fdpzmv7,t3_emkruh,1578647567.0,"NAL, so I can’t really comment on the first part. I just wanted to inform you that microchips do not expire. With Home Again, you can pay for their *optional* membership which affords you a few extra perks, like sending out notices if you report the pet lost, and free calls to a pet poison helpline, last time I checked. But the chip remains registered and part of the database for the life of the pet, regardless of whether your membership is current or even if you never had one at all. This is why it’s always very important to keep your contact info up to date on your account so they can always contact you if needed. 

If the chip was registered to you, I would screenshot/print that info and store it. Make sure the info is up to date. And change your password to ensure she can’t access the account and make any changes."
