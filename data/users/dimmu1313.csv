If you're over 30 I might believe you, but the odds that you're a 20-something or even teenager who wants to be part of a special club are very high. Dissociative Disorders are exceedingly rare, and while OSDD allows for the cognitive awareness of the dissociated identities (whereas DID requires that a person have acute amnesia and by extension little or no awareness of the dissociated identities), OSDD is, quite frankly a very ""convenient"" disorder for which angsty teenagers and young adults can self-diagnose.  The complex trauma, which OSDD (as opposed to DID and BPD, the latter of which is far more common and more likely, despite still being very uncommon) would necessarily allow you to recall and describe in detail the sources of complex trauma because of both the lack of acute amnesia and protective barriers that the dissociated identities create (a dissociated identity creates a buffer from the trauma by seeing the affected self as another totally separate person).

So, all that said, two very important questions: how old are you, and what trauma(s) led to the dissociated identities?

Second:

\>  who cares about them unless you are vulnerable 

That's part of the very problematic thinking a lot of people have about vaccinations.  Just because the flu isn't deadly to you, you could easily get it and transmit it to someone to whom it is deadly.  Vaccinations aren't just about keeping you from experiencing the symptoms of the disease, they're also about keeping you from spreading the disease. Many people who are the most vulnerable to the deadly effects of a disease are also, for various reasons, unable to get the vaccination.  By essentially being surrounded by people who \*are\* vaccinated, they're effectively shielded through a concept called ""herd immunity"": they can't get sick and die from the disease if the disease doesn't have a transmission path to that person.  Diseases survive and thrive not just by infecting one person, but by infecting others before it dies out. The flu has a high efficiency of transmission, and so herd immunity from the flu requires anyone and everyone that can be vaccinated to get vaccinated in order to protect those who can't get vaccinated.  By willfully choosing not to get vaccinated, you are the weak link in chain through which the disease can pass.  Choosing to not get vaccinated is effectively choosing to take someone else's life in your hands."

If you're vaccinated, you don't get sick. If you don't get sick, you can't spread the disease. The more people who can't spread the disease, the less likely those who are most susceptible -- and to whom the disease is most dangerous -- will get it.

This is true.

The only real argument that might call into question the \*usefulness\* of the data depicted is that Teslas account for something like (by my estimate) 2% of all vehicles on the road in the US today. It's a big number, but very low to establish a beefy correlation between crash likelihood and whether a car is a Tesla.

Batman is the only ""super"" hero I actually like because he's human, not all powerful, not invincible.

Characters with god-like abilities are pure fantasy and pure stupidity.  I think a big reason I didn't like the Avengers and other Marvel movies is because they force the audience to accept vulnerabilities that just wouldn't be there with someone who's essentially a living god in order to dance around the fact that this character just shouldn't exist.

I think superheroes are fine for comics and cartoons but that's where they should stay. Movies are ultimately about immersion and suspension of disbelief, no matter the genre.

Are any ops or flashpoints soloable (without BiS gear)?  I'm fine grinding heroics if that's what I have to do but any boost in efficiency would be nice.

> tactical is an additional gear piece.

I think I'm going to have to check out a guide or two. I did notice my character has a gear slot (tactical?) that I haven't seen before, so basically I'll just visit the tactical vendor once and I'll have the BiS item? Or it's a progressive thing that I spend more and more (tech fragments?) to gradually get toward top quality?

Sorry for all the questions but you've been a big help!"

So for conquest, if I'm not in a guild, it still has utility?

Are tacticals what I will be focusing on for endgame gear?  Can I reach 306 solo?

Sounds like crafting is the same. Thanks.

Sounds like renown is just a minigame for something extra to do besides focusing on endgame gear.

Operations are out for me, I never really got into them. I did notice there are a handful of new datacrons so I'll definitely be going after those.

What's the state of crafting? I was maxed out on all craft skills and did enjoy bouncing around alts for crafting mats and missions, and i noticed that what was previously max craft level mission items (where the item enables a new mission in the crafting mat mission list that guarantees high end mats) that I was stockpiling have all been converted to top level crafting missions for 6.0 so that was nice.  But in the past even with crafting skills and companions maxed out, the ultimate utility of crafting was fairly limited: craft BiS augments, mods, etc and top-tier stims, adrenals, and health packs.  Obviously I don't bother with crafting that requires running operations. But I'm wondering how much of a waste of time it is to level companion affection and crafting skills.

What about the Renown system? Galactic Command came and went in the time I've been gone, and my understanding is that it's been converted to the Renown system. Is that something that's meant for solo players? Is there any value/utility in levelling that? Is that just a system for post-75 XP? Not sure if you're familiar but in the game Diablo 3 they have a Paragon system which is a method of continuing to gain xp and gain incremental stat boosts after the character has reached max level. I'm wondering if Renown is the same idea."

They tried using ""trade secret"" laws to protect proprietary design details, and that's absolutely egregious in my opinion. The software encryption and protection schemes should allow for total transparency (because disclosing encryption schemes does not, by design, allow hackers to know how to break the schemes) of software and hardware designs.

It reminds me of the ludicrous ruling some time in recent history when corporations were deemed to be individuals with the same rights and privileges as ordinary citizens, which create a glaringly obvious (and presumably deliberate) loophole by which wealthy individuals could hide or obfuscate the movement of money in and around campaigns.

That said, your first step (assuming you've already done a lot of hands-on learning and are comfortable with UE) should be to link your EG account to a Quixel account to get access to their Megascans library.  They have a nice tool called Bridge which is an app you run alongside UE, from which you can download and export textures, meshes, and materials directly into your currently open project.  Inside Bridge, be sure to lower the default resolution as they come in at 8k which is way too high for anything you want to use in multiple instances (I set everything I export from Bridge to 2k by default).

Showerthoughts,fgjklag,t3_eys1i2,1580845971.0,"We've already accomplished interstellar space travel. It's not a question of whether it's possible, it's a question of whether it can be done in any meaningful, useful period of time.

The fastest any man-made object has ever traveled is roughly 101 km/s, which is about 100x faster than the fastest bullet (the .220 Swift).  That's approximately 1/2968 or 0.03% the speed of light.  At that speed, it would take (4.243ly\*2968) = 12,594 years to reach the closest star. Hell, at that speed it would take 2.35 years just to go from the Earth to Pluto (7.5 billion km) if the craft was already moving at that speed when passing the earth.

It's a bit depressing actually to think that, despite the sheer size of our own galaxy and the fact that at some point we'll have the ability to get to nearby stars within a few human generations (e.g., we could send people whose sole purpose was to reproduce, raise their kids, and die, rinse and repeat with their kids and grandkids a few times over without ever leaving the spacecraft, hoping one of the offspring doesnt f things up, OR discover a way to put people in prolonged stasis without them aging or dying), the extreme distance to even the closest galaxies can never be overcome.  Worse still, the current generally accepted rate of expansion of the universe sets an upper limit on the maximum possible distance to travel \*ever at any speed\* and it's a relatively small swath of the universe.

All that said, any hope of travel to any place more than a few light years to a few hundred light years (a tiny swath of our own galaxy) lies in exotic, non-conventional means, of which many are theorized and few can be imagined as implementable with any knowledge we have today.  One example of interstellar and even intergalactic travel is the concept of ""space folding"". We've known for a long time that space (and time) is really just a system of positions trajectories governed by the sum of all forces and energies (including some we can't identify) in the universe, and everything -- including light -- obeys the ""shape"" of that system. Folding space is a concept that simply disregards the shape and available trajectories of this space-time system, and ""punches a hole"" through it, between any two points, bringing them together like walking through a door from one room to another. 

We see a potential means of this happening naturally with black holes, the centers of which constitute a so-called ""singularity"" where gravity distorts space time to such an extreme that all known reality is concentrated into a single, infinitesimal point. Theoretically (and disregarding the rather large problem of being otherwise annihilated down to subatomic particles if not pure energy), if one distorts space in the same way, and moves any microscopic distance in any direction, then return space to its normal ""shape"" one would find themselves potentially thousands, millions, or even billions of light years away.

There actually is new hope of not only making this happen, but surviving the effects with discovery of evidence of the Higgs Boson -- the information-carrier particle that gives matter the property of mass -- and the pre-supposed existence of a Higgs Field, across which the information of mass is transmitted. One method by which this mechanism may work is for normal matter to convey mass via the Higgs Bosons to other matter which also has mass via the Higgs Field.  A thought is, if we can manipulate the information carrier or the field to give a pocket of space -- containing a vessel with a person in it -- an apparent infinite or extremely high mass (probably at some safe distance from the earth) such that space time distorts to an extremely high gradient, then remove the ""fake"" mass and return spacetime to normal but having moved a very small distance while inside the distorted region, theoretically the contents of this ""pocket"" will return to normal space at an extreme displacement."

The reason is because an infestation means there are one or more centers of rapid reproduction (i.e., nests) and unless every insect in the nest(s) are killed, including the eggs, there's no way to stop it.

If it's \*not\* a full-on, out-of-control infestation, the first thing to do is clean-clean-clean to remove any any all sources of food for the insects. You'll also really need to have an exterminator come assess. There's a good chance that they can find (the most likely) nesting spots and apply poison directly to the area, killing the insects at the source.
