mentalhealth,fcrz7ek,t3_eimoh3,1577908782.0,It's very hard take it for myself I lost so many jobs because I just don't want to get out of bed sometimes but I guess you have to look at the long run not just today. You need to tell yourself you're doing it for you to make yourself a better person. Kind of like you just need to keep looking at the long run not today. I'm the type of person that takes it day by day bad to do because you end up losing so much. I'm sorry I hope things get better for you being stuck in depression is the worst feeling ever especially when you can't get out of your own head.
