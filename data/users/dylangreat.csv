There have been quite a large amount of psychological studies that show people are more attracted to healthy mates instinctively, because you know, it used to matter when we were hunters and gatherers whether or not your mate could be useful.

science,fe5bzs2,t3_enn489,1578867499.0,"I took shrooms when I went to this lake literally in the middle of nowhere in a big forest. We thought that if we took them 15 minutes before we’d find the lake and we’d start tripping by the time we got there. But, since we were all on empty stomachs, they started to hit way faster than expected. So we had to keep pulling over to get a grip on ourselves and make sure everyone was good. Slowly we all devovlved into some reality that was much more magical than our own. Trees melting, the ground transforming into a giant spinning kaleidoscope, the sounds of laughing whispers everytime the wind blew through the trees and bushes all around us, it was all so surreal. We found where we had to park and start walking to the lake I hadn’t been to since I was younger, and within about 15 minutes of walking, out of nowhere comes this massive swarm of mosquitoes. Instantly they start landing all over my face and hands, and I can feel the gross sensation of being bitten over and over. Since I was trippin, the sensation of all the bites wasn’t itchy, it was more like a numb feeling all over, and I got this odd sense of no self. Like I couldn’t think of what made me who I am. My past, my future, my own roots as to what built my personality we’re all swirling around in my head without any type of coherent organization. I could hardly tell who I was, I was experiencing ego death, complete loss of the self. It feels like how I imagine dying feeling like, just a huge rush of holy fucking shit what’s going on, and then a sense of realization, and then weirdly, acceptance. Taking shrooms, as weird as it sounds in this case, made me fear death way way less, because as weird as it sounds, my self did die that day, and something different came after. I don’t know what exactly happened in my brain but I can tell you it puts a proper perspective on what we are and what the purpose is(nothing). And it forces you to actually accept it instead of pretending you’re okay with death at some point."

There is some distance between your mouth and lungs, and when you first inhale, a lot of what you first inhale is normal air, which starts to pressurize your lungs, so it gets harder and harder for more air to go in. So you have to take that second deep breath to push it all into your lungs. Imagine the amount of weed you have wasted hahahaha, at least you still have a low tolerance, also, this is not representative of what being high is at all, an oil pen is 80% or more thc, it’s highly concentrated."

space,fcw4dhx,t1_fcvyayf,1578016871.0,"Your relevance is based on what’s relevant to you, that’s your point right? Meaning you’re measuring something with a brain that only recently evolved from apes. Give a robot the mental capacity of a god and it’d still know it is nothing and we are nothing but the ants we believe we’re so much more than. Relevance is based on a scale that is constructed, it doesn’t really matter how you feel, because in the end, it isn’t you, it’s your brain."

GetMotivated,fcemjb8,t1_fc99mqm,1577621830.0,"It’s impossible to be happy if you can’t be yourself. If your dad is relying on you to pass on the blood line, that should not be more important than your own happiness, if he says otherwise if and when you come out, then that should make you very angry, not sympathetic. That would be very selfish of your dad, because you aren’t his property, you are your own person. You aren’t any different of a person before or after you come out, and your dad shouldn’t see you any differently if and when he ever finds that out. That is a huge conflict that I could see you possibly resolving, and who knows, that could have a huge dramatic positive impact on your life, and it sounds to me like you’d finally be able to be yourself. I’d say there’s some hope in that."
GetMotivated,fc8ceie,t1_fc7jm4s,1577531756.0,"I feel that man. Honestly kind of in the same boat, or was. I just sat around, smoked weed, didn’t work, always asked for money, and the days just passed as if there was nothing really to them. But no person on this planet is perfect, for perfect is a human concept. I guess at some point I just kind of realized all of those feelings of hopelessness were just as meaningless as I saw life, which in turn actually made me feel better about life. Sitting around moping just felt like I was giving up, like I wasn’t even trying to make the situation better. But all it takes are small steps to making yourself better, maybe signing up for a college class at a community college to get some credits, or looking for a job that pays better, or maybe making a goal of saving enough money to travel somewhere you’ve always wanted to go, or maybe a little love in your life maybe from a significant other could be something you could try to practice and pursue, or if you’re still living with your parents, trying to get out to go live on your own with some roommates. Also, I hate to be one to advocate drugs, but I used to be very misunderstanding of what real happiness is and where it comes from, until I took shrooms/LSD, both of which done in the right conditions, are completely harmless, in fact, they can make you a much better person, as they made me. They just make something click that never even crossed my mind. I don’t know, maybe look into it sometime. I think you might be hurting yourself a little bit, those obligations you mention. If you’re doing everything in your life for your family, what are you doing for yourself? What are some things you like to do in your free time, things you actually enjoy?"
GetMotivated,fc79l1p,t1_fc5jo5u,1577501154.0,"What’s the point in hating yourself? Have you ever asked yourself that question?

Idk, maybe it’s the media making us feel like our lives aren’t equating to the people we see on the internet and in movies and tv shows. None of which is realistic. But in the end, yolo."

It literally says in the constitution you can’t use your power to make bribes, yet this is somehow a part of democrats being salty about the 2016 election. They’ll do anything to make us turn against each other and not use critical thought"
