PS4,fff1ula,t1_ffe8w62,1579873400.0,"I felt that way for the first few areas and then it was just so easy I stopped playing. Once I saw people one-hitting bosses, I was pretty disappointed.  I’m not a Fromsoftware fanboy but no other game has even come close to level of detail they guys put into their worlds and lore."
PS4,fff1h6t,t1_fff18wl,1579873094.0,I just want to see his next game get even weirder than DS. Hopefully that horror game is a real thing.
PS4,ffe53xj,t3_et2joq,1579836933.0,I played the game a while ago and just started playing again to make this video. I noticed a new option on the menu and it let me play the pc game. I just guessed it had to do with how many B-sides you find. Maybe not.
gaming,ffe4zyj,t1_ffe2g3q,1579836851.0,"Idk where I am, tbh. I just helped a weird hotel manager clean his hotel I think."
gaming,ffdqb1l,t1_ffdoli4,1579826384.0,"Oh, they get *very* tough."
PS4,ffc4dug,t3_esu01g,1579791244.0,"It’d probably be like playing any single-player game with two people. Slightly frustrating, slightly fun.

Edit: if you’ve never played the game, it would probably end up being more frustrating than fun. It’s meant to be played alone."
PS4,ffc1ifl,t1_ffbxser,1579789165.0,"Yeah, you may be about 6 years behind but whatever. You can also press the ps button and square at the same time to zoom in on anything."
PS4,ff9f85c,t1_ff90ykn,1579711737.0,"Damn, guess they just need one on file. Sneaky bastards, always trying to auto-renewal your subscriptions for you. But if you do have a CC, don’t worry about them charging you a single cent. As long as you go to Account Management> Manage subscriptions & then turn it off manually. If you don’t do that, it’ll renew itself in 7 days and you’ll be charged."
StarWars,ff8zpeh,t1_ff8u17j,1579701092.0,"And I told you I couldn’t find it, and gave you something just as good. Why do you even care if Lucas said it or not? You are wrong. It’s obvious what his intentions were and has been confirmed as canon, so let it go. Sorry I can’t locate the exact quote out of the thousands of articles and videos online. I just think it’s funny how you need a quote to be persuaded. Just go watch the scene, dude. It’s pretty damn obvious what’s going on. And that’s just as good as a quote, seeing as how he directed the scene. You’re just interpreting the scene wrong if you think Luke wasn’t healed."
StarWars,ff8tuc4,t1_ff8tlkn,1579695863.0,"It’s people like you who are ruining the film industry. You need everything explained to you, served on a silver platter. If it isn’t specifically told to you, it doesn’t count because you have no imagination of your own. Lucas probably knew most people would be smart enough to know what was going on, but apparently he was wrong. Just stick to your movies that have exposition thrown at you in every other line. Then you won’t be so confused. Nowadays, Obi would’ve said something like, “I healed you Luke!” Because most audience members can’t interpret shit on their own. You seem to be one of those people."
StarWars,ff8tolx,t1_ff8tlkn,1579695696.0,"It doesn’t matter, my guy. It’s canon."
StarWars,ff8tgi4,t1_ff8t1sm,1579695458.0,"Tbh, I’m guessing you’re very young and have probably never actually watched A New Hope. Or, if you have, you didn’t understand it or how storytelling works. Lucas wanted the audience to see this cloaked figure and wonder who he was. He then heals Luke and that’s the audience’s first hint that he isn’t just a hermit."
StarWars,ff8t6ba,t1_ff8t1sm,1579695149.0,"You really are a moron, lol. I got like 5 karma, my master plan worked! But, to make you happy, I found some info on it. It’s not a direct quote from Lucas but it is canon.

“Practitioners were many, as were examples of its utilization. Ki-Adi-Mundi used this Force power to heal a broken collar bone almost completely by meditation after the ambush of Jabba the Hutt's minions, during Mundi's mission to find Sharad Hett. Obi-Wan Kenobi used a basic form of this ability on Luke Skywalker after the latter's confrontation with Tusken Raiders on Tatooine.”"
StarWars,ff8svov,t1_ff8srq9,1579694816.0,I really couldn’t care less if you buy into my “speculation.” I just think it’s funny how you think there’s no Force powers being used on Luke in this scene.
StarWars,ff8strz,t1_ff8shsh,1579694753.0,"So, in your opinion, Obi just places his hand on Luke’s face and it just miraculously revived him? Lol that’s so dumb. And, again, I’m not saying that this is the same type of healing we see in the new film. But it’s obviously meant to be “magical,” the way he just wanders in and revives him. It’s the scene where the audience first starts to wonder who this guy really is. That’s the whole point. It would be stupid as hell if he just woke Luke up like anyone normally would. We see him place a hand on Luke, Luke is healed and that sets up the audience for what’s to come."
StarWars,ff8smek,t1_ff8shsh,1579694514.0,"Yeah, that’s just one sentence. I literally just said that. Holy shit."
StarWars,ff8selc,t1_ff8s1yl,1579694263.0,"That was literally one sentence, bro. Think about it. It’s the introduction of Obi and it’s the first time we see a Jedi. Lucas *obviously* had him heal Luke, to get us wondering who he was and wtf he just did. You’re so close-minded. Have you ever seen someone wake up a knocked out dude by gently placing their hand on the person’s face?"
PS4,ff8s7ja,t1_ff87d47,1579694033.0,"I’ve also had the same thing happen with PS Plus. They give you a free trial at first, but then I found a sneaky way to get more free trials (it’s worked a few times but didn’t work the last time I tried.) When my subscription would run out, I would start a game up that had saved data on the Cloud. It would say I couldn’t access the Cloud, or whatever, because I didn’t have Plus. But then it would give me a 3-day (maybe more) trial so that I could get the save data back onto my system storage. I’ve done that a few times and idk if it was a glitch but I’ve done it at least 4 times since the PS4 launched lol."
StarWars,ff8ros7,t1_ff8hql9,1579693404.0,"No, he probably just didn’t use it again because it’s stupid and causes more problems than it solves, when it comes to the plot. And the new force healing is just overpowered as hell and I wouldn’t even say it’s the same thing that Obi used on Luke. I do think he used his force powers to wake him up and heal him, but that’s it. I’m not saying he could’ve revived Luke from the dead. I mean, look at the way his hand is on Luke’s face. If he just wanted to wake him up, he would’ve probably just shaken him awake. So I’m pretty sure he’s healing him/waking him with the force. And, again, I saw a quote from Lucas. He may not have control of the franchise, either, but Abrams said he consulted with Lucas while making the film."
PS4,ff8rfb4,t1_ff8ij74,1579693073.0,I have a card on my PS4. I’m saying you don’t need to actually use it to get the free trial.
PS4,ff7qznm,t1_ff6c77c,1579656234.0,"Like other guy said, no you don’t. It’ll take you to a page where you can purchase a certain amount of months but there’s also an option to “purchase” a 7-day free trial. No CC needed."
PS4,ff7qwvd,t1_ff7kwko,1579656180.0,"Yep, I think this is the third free trial I’ve had."
PS4,ff7qvco,t1_ff6fo6q,1579656151.0,"Cool, glad it isn’t just me :)"
StarWars,ff747uo,t1_ff6a6nn,1579640790.0,"I can’t find the article. I may have heard it in a video or something, but I don’t think it’s a bold claim. Obi is obviously healing Luke in this scene."
PS4,ff73zun,t1_ff6bi4o,1579640664.0,I wasn’t talking about the Divinity part. Just every day there’s a post about good couch co-op games. But Divinity is pretty unique.
StarWars,ff66ky1,t3_erue1i,1579620359.0,George Lucas has confirmed that it was.
FinalFantasy,ff66gol,t1_ff50uwm,1579620280.0,I like boobs.
PS4,ff66adi,t1_ff57244,1579620158.0,"Good, we need more difficulty in our games these days. Too many games of this genre are way too simple."
PS4,ff666qk,t3_ervtfs,1579620089.0,Lol why is this same question posted on this sub almost every day?
PS4,ff65z2t,t1_ff5oqc0,1579619946.0,"I hate it when the title isn’t on the spine. I mean, c’mon! You went through the trouble of making the badass art, just give me the title!"
PS4,ff65wlc,t3_ersd0d,1579619898.0,"Doom is, by far, my favorite reverse cover. So badass."
aww,ff40als,t1_ff3tcdy,1579552745.0,I didn’t mean it was pretending to smile. I’ve read that they make that face when they’re being submissive.
aww,ff3r1fr,t3_ercklc,1579546999.0,Dogs aren’t people. That “smile” isn’t because he’s happy about getting a treat. He’s probably just trying to appease his owner. Dogs also “smile” when they’re nervous.
PS4,ff2ur6t,t1_fez9u74,1579524954.0,"No, I’m saying we get Horizon screenshots every damn day and it’s getting old. It got old two years ago. And none of the games I listed get *nearly* as much attention as Horizon. None of those games have daily screenshots on this sub, or even close to it. And that’s what I’m talking about...Screenshots. I just don’t understand why people feel the need to post about how beautiful Horizon is as often as they do. We get it. It was released in 2017 and it’s still nonstop screenshots. And, again, it’s not even that great of a game."
PS4,fez6hxa,t1_fez36h4,1579454296.0,"Here’s the launch trailer for 1886, in case you’ve never seen gameplay. If it was shitty game, I’d happily admit it. But it really isn’t. Most reviews will say it is but I guarantee you it has nothing to do with the actual game, but the length of the game. 
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RgJvIak6BpE"
PS4,fez5swt,t1_fez36h4,1579454063.0,"It’s actually an incredible game. People were just pissed off because it’s so short and I think it was sold for $60. If you can snag it for $15 or less, do it. Idk where you heard that it was a shitty, poorly made game because that’s complete bullshit lol. It’s short as hell but every second is great."
