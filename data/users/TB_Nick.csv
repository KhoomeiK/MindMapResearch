To clarify: I still haven’t lost faith in humanity yet, and I do think there are people out there that would do this for a friend, and if I was *truly* in that situation I probably would help them too. I was being unsympathetic when I wrote those comments, mostly because at first, I didn’t like the comment portrayed in the original post, as at the time, I believed it was likely a made up story and people were falling for it, which made me mad and say that stuff. But now I realize that it doesn’t matter whether it was true or not, it’s still a nice story that makes people feel good. I’m honestly most disappointed in myself for saying that I wouldn’t do this for my best friend, as I know that he would most definitely do it for me without a second thought.

It would obviously have to have a banger soundtrack with songs that easily blended together so the player would seamlessly be able to switch between songs when needed. There would also be enemies mixed in and some songs would give you weapons to fight the enemies with. Each song would have a hot key so the player could easily switch between them.
