AccidentalRenaissance,ffi3h9m,t1_ffi0rb9,1579963995.0,"As mentioned by others, eating an infected animal is likely (the Wuhan market where it is suspected to have originated sold seafood and wild animal meat, aka bushmeat - which is often where viruses make the jump to become capable of infecting humans, it's how ebola probably came about). By the sounds of it, that market is also very likely a Chinese wet market, which means all of this meat being sold - alongside seafood, alongside live chickens and ducks being slaughtered then and there or sold with legs tied to be killed at home - are generally ""cleaned"" throughout the day by hosing all the blood and shit into a gutter and out of sight out of mind. So the entire place would be constantly wet all day and everybody is walking through this area covered in water, blood, and other stuff that comes out when you kill a thing... And buying food to bring home. It's kind of surprising more viruses don't spread from those places."

newzealand,fdn4x9q,t1_fdmzzt3,1578577386.0,"Bingo. What makes this even more sad is that the international student ""industry"" relies on an impression to some extent among fee-paying overseas parents of some level of pastoral care. A lot of kids coming to study in New Zealand have never been away from home, aren't aware or prepared for the macho culture, the drug culture, the racist culture they might experience there, and there's a shameful lack of guidance on any of these things for overseas students. 


English language assistance? Yeah, minimal in most cases but at least it exists; other than that they have to pretty much figure things out for themselves. Agents overseas selling access to New Zealand high schools and universities certainly have it in their best interests to gloss over any of the downsides to studying in New Zealand - and the provision of any kind of support for students is dealt with largely case by case for each school/institution, and that's really not good enough. We could be leading the region in this area if it was managed more humanely, people *want* to study in New Zealand - and they want to send their kids here - but instead our institutions are happy to simply cash in while they can on our positive general international image as a location without any real effort to deserve the payout they get for that - kind of like some of our eco-tourism I guess."

Could imagine that sub becoming very popular actually, if they're isn't one already that ironically I don't know about.

videos,fdk4h6e,t1_fdk1idd,1578495833.0,"That's a dangerous over-simplification though. Maybe you could say that for actresses/actors who already had a degree of power and influence themselves and then chose to work with Weinstein and perhaps encourage others to work with him even though they knew what he was like. I suspect this is fair for Asia Argento for example because she dated the guy publicly and even by her own admission did so with the express intention of benefiting her career. 


It's not fair to say this though for people he methodically exploited and who legitimately didn't know the full extent of what they were getting themselves into until it was all happening at once. For example - if you read about how he carefully set things up with Salma Hayek on the set of 'Frida' so that standing up for herself against his requirements for nudity on set (that she did not want and did not think was consistent with her vision for a project that was personally very important to her and that she'd worked towards realising on screen for years) would have meant throwing away her life's dream and knowingly putting at risk the countless hours of dedication of all the cast and crew depending on her and her vision that up until that moment Weinstein seemed to have genuinely supported without preconditions. He intentionally stacked the situation up against her in this way before forcing this condition so that it wasn't really a ""choice"" for her at all at that stage, because of everything that was riding on it and that she and others had invested in the project up until then. That's an example of how he could manipulate the people he had power over. So while there are some who are surely exploiting the situation at hand, not all of the victims are doing that I think."

politics,fd2sfja,t1_fd2j8af,1578151230.0,"I guess the difference is, someone who openly expresses joy and who eagerly jokes about and believes immediately in the reasoning for an assassination of a person, any person, justifiably should be expected to know who that person is and exactly why they can decide to be so happy that person is now dead - rather than simply taking the word of the group who just killed him, and the fact he represents the military in a country perceived as an enemy during relative peace time. On the other hand another someone who suggests political assassinations should go through the proper legal-political framework, and perhaps should be taken in consideration of the wishes of one's allies and citizens doesn't have the same responsibility to know the background of the person being assassinated because its a general principle they are defending, not the person who was just killed. It's up to the people doing the killing to give clear, reliable evidence to justify that killing, at the very least to their own citizens who may be forced to deal with the consequences of that decision in unforeseen ways."
movies,fd2ojck,t1_fd283n4,1578150140.0,"I haven't seen the movie, so my view is completely based on the principle here (and only on the validity of the deaging stuff - I have no opinion on the movie itself having not seen it)... But a movie is a creative work and it's up to the people creating it to decide how it's going to be made. These are the choices they made for this film, and it's done now. 


If I don't like a painting I just won't continue looking at it, and certainly won't hang it on my wall. I'm not going to say the artist should have produced it differently unless it's absolute shit in such an extreme sense that someone like myself completely lacking in artistic ability can confidently do better. I suspect that's unlikely if the artist is as accomplished as the creators of this film. 


They did what they did - if I like the result when I set it that's good, I hope I do. If I don't then no big loss - there are plenty of other movies I do like, and it doesn't mean the creators should have made different choices just because of my preference. As far as the ""option"" of finding another actor to play young de Niro, a young pesci, and a young pacino... I can't imagine who could pull that off and not piss all over the whole situation with their glaring not-deniro-ness, and so on. Pacino as a young godfather/Brando was in many ways the performance of a generation that Scorcese lucked into by finding him in the perfect form for that role at the perfect moment. I don't think that kind of gravitas is something you can just reliably cast whenever you want to - and assuming that can be done in the form of a trifecta for three of the most iconic character actors in this genre just seems kind of crazy to me. I could be wrong though, as I know as little about casting as I do about directing or CGI, or artistry. Yeah, I'm kind of shit at a lot of things come to think of it."
