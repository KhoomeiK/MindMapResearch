(Source: my wife was a Vice President for the bank for 14 years and sat on an advisory panel once with her.) My wife NEVER has done anything unethical for the bank. In fact, part of the reason she resigned is because her manager, team lead, and another person in leadership all wanted her to lightly fudge some stuff in write ups.

And you're 100% right on all the compliance training. The wife is still in banking (diff. bank), and it's a never-ending hell. But she damned sure knows what's legal and what isn't.

I'll wager the women here who are all over my very sanitary practice (again, I rarely do it and always clean if I splash) don't wash their hands properly. *I* am hardly the problem.

Also, period blood isn't sterile. And urine is sterile IF the person that produces is doesn't have a urinary tract or bladder infection—both of which are very common. I find it fascinating that people are more concerned with my nonexistent urine on the seat and trying to change my behaviors when: 

* 1) I am not trying to change anyone. To each her own is what I've said this whole time. Clearly you're not worried about piss on the seat cuz it's sterile, per you, so why do you care if I hover and wipe after? 

* 2) The most common disease vector is dirty hands. If you truly care about hygiene and diseases, focus your attempt to change people's behaviors there. Anyone who has spent any time in a public bathroom knows that very little proper hand washing happens there.

**People here:** Don't hover, you spray urine. That's gross.

**Also people here:** I'll sit on the seat. Don't care. Urine is sterile.

I promise, not every car that has space for a double-DIN HU can have CarPlay. Again, though, it's moot, since the car was totaled by an inattentive driver, and our new car has all the coolest tech and safety features we wanted, as my wife is in sales and does a TON of driving in Los Angeles."

Not having money doesn't mean we start assigning grandiose terms to foods because we wish were having that food. And I can promise you that because it was made with a non-risotto grain, it doesn't have the taste of risotto. Words matter. That is my only point.

You can’t just call something a dish without understanding what makes the dish what it is.
