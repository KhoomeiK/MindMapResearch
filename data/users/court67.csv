k9sports,ffhxp4m,t3_etl3t1,1579958432.0,"I don’t think any club is going to have their meeting time online, you’ll have to email for that. Honestly, google is your friend here. If you can go to one, they likely know a lot of the other clubs in their area and can get you a list."
k9sports,ffhxnfl,t1_ffhfhye,1579958379.0,Yep USCA’s website has a directory of clubs for IGP.
k9sports,fffvqot,t1_fffvm2j,1579892851.0,"Yeah it’s something I would break out as a separate skill for sure, and have the decoy be extremely consistent with positioning so she knows exactly where the tug will be (low, out to the side)."
k9sports,fffv3zo,t1_fffsluz,1579892452.0,What about send to decoy + toy? We do that a lot for troubleshooting this stuff where you don’t want to have to add additional complexity like outing off the sleeve/suit. Or is she going to look for the leg and make him nervous? Lmao
dogs,fffmwg5,t1_ffflu7o,1579887397.0,"One of my dogs does not wear a gentle leader because it’s quite aversive to him. I gave up on desensitizing him to it because i just wasn’t making progress. My time was better spent on LLW without the GL, just on a flat collar. 

The bitch I use a GL with has had a metric shit ton of desensitization to stuff on her face. She has to be muzzled on hikes, and she has an eye condition that requires UV protective goggles. By the time I put the work into those, the GL was nbd to her. So I’m not really sure how much time it would have taken without that history. I will say I’ve met some dogs that just never take to it, and will always find it too much, because it’s truly aversive to them."
