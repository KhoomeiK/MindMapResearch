freebies,ff7w7dy,t1_ff7voo5,1579659820.0,"The folded card allows you to just print something on the outside of the front and back.  Picture a table tent sitting on a table, it sits like that and has nothing on the inside. So if you held it like a greeting card, it would be empty inside and you can't print anything there.  The folded greeting card is your typical card where you can print something on the front, inside, and back."

MovieDetails,feiy4kq,t1_feipjfi,1579150463.0,"Ooh, I know the CDA 2319 reference.  So in MONSTERS INC, one of the monsters comes back with a white sock on his back and another monster yells ""We have a 23-19!"" and the CDA (Child Detection Agency) rushes in with biohazard suits to make sure he's contained and not spreading any possible disease brought back with him.  Rumor is that the 23-19 could be that the 23rd letter in the alphabet is W and the 19th is S and it stands for ""white sock"" since that's what's on the character but could just be random numbers.  But that's what the stickers are referencing."

Oscars,feaw5f8,t1_fealole,1578952793.0,"FURIOUS 7 is in the top 10 grossing movies of all time and I can't stand most of that series. I would certainly say it's not Oscar-worthy but it was hugely successful.  You can just Google the top 50 grossing films and start scrolling and probably find a bunch you don't like and aren't Oscar-worthy (short of maybe some effects here and there). I was surprised by FROZEN 2 not getting a nom either but I have heard a lot of great things about the other films that were nominated and so they all do seem deserving. FROZEN 2 didn't seem to be anything special, per se, and so that might have kept it out of the minds of the voters even if it was good."
Oscars,feaicp5,t1_fe9t4lr,1578949154.0,But not liking the movie shouldn't have anything to do with the performance.  I can hate a movie but still recognize an actor was great in it and deserving of an award.
Oscars,feahp6w,t1_fe8zdll,1578948931.0,Being commercially successful doesn't mean it's an incredible film that needs to get a nomination though.  There are a lot of films that do really well in the box office but don't deserve Oscars.
ContagiousLaughter,fe4jjux,t1_fdhfyzz,1578859977.0,"It's annoying as shit but that's the exact reason - the expectation of it being longer.  So when someone is doing a search and it comes up with 7 results, 6 of them showing the video to be 5-seconds and 1 being 15-seconds, the average person will choose the 15-second one thinking it's a longer version.  Doesn't really apply when it's then re-shared to Reddit but they are doing it for the Youtube searches and such."
MovieDetails,fdfz4r0,t1_fdf129s,1578374353.0,"This is weird though because as an actor, you are very aware of where the camera is and when it moves.  So the actor would clearly know that it was panning to him, especially in a small confined space like the car.  So I don't know what surprise this would elicit as the actor would just react normally in character once he saw the camera changing position."

Filmmakers,fd6gpbg,t1_fd6bys4,1578190738.0,"It would be tough to get the camera set up in a way that it was totally on the action and then fell while staying framed the whole time (couldn't just hang as it would bounce all over the place).  The camera operator can frame it properly and then hold it steady through the fall as well as the landing.  Plus he can make any small adjustments needed if they are a little higher in the frame than expected, etc..."
MovieDetails,fd66244,t1_fd64giq,1578186027.0,"Basically that the script called for large cornfields but it was in places that it probably shouldn't be, which is the sense the director says he wanted us to have.  And they found a farmer near some mountains that was kinda off the normal grid for growing corn and it hadn't been done before in that area. And so they started to grow it and fortunately it got to the right height just in time for filming (covering almost 1,000 acres). Then for the driving scenes the corn was 7-10 feet tall so there was no visibility so they rode over the vehicle in a helicopter and told the driver when to turn right and left. Then they had to burn the corn but it was green and green corn doesn't burn so they hid propane and diesel tanks in the field to make the fire.  Then at the very end, they sold the remaining corn and made all their money back from the crop."
