RoastMe,fepbxuu,t1_fep9464,1579316777.0,Mental health 5/10 but can't get any lower? That's the problem right there. He lacks ambition. Sure with that attitude it can't get any lower but its definitely not gonna get any higher either. It'll be just as mediocre and lukewarm as this post
RoastMe,feparx1,t3_eq9or2,1579315995.0,"Your post says ""thick skin"" but your face says ""I do drugs to numb the pain"""
RoastMe,fepajv4,t3_eq9y7c,1579315840.0,You look like a part city human skin suit and the more I look at you the more horrified I become
RoastMe,fepa5jf,t3_eqai87,1579315580.0,Why do you look like a walking mugshot?
RoastMe,fep9z25,t3_eqaket,1579315463.0,With those edges it feels like if I blow hard enough on the screen it'll knock the rest of your hair off your head
depression,fd32pcn,t1_fczq6fd,1578154226.0,That's horrible
depression,fco5ifa,t1_fco4tx1,1577824470.0,"Yeah, I'd be quivering too. I'm a weenie noodle through and through"
depression,fco4f6u,t1_fcnudbb,1577823876.0,Lmao you might have a point there.
depression,fco43y1,t1_fcnuxvr,1577823708.0,"Trust me, the only thing that's hard about writing is the motivation to keep doing it. At least that's been my experience so far. Also this was kind of a cheat because I was just describing what happened. I didn't have to use to much imagination thankfully."
depression,fcnt4hq,t1_fcnrlo0,1577817907.0,"Yeah, I realized its probably something I'd have to expend a lot of energy to achieve. Plus I don't think genuine murderers walk the streets as much as we think."
depression,fcn95ui,t1_fcme109,1577806471.0,Not gonna lie. It did feel oddly liberating knowing I hit rock bottom.
depression,fcn92ha,t1_fcmcgt0,1577806405.0,I never mentioned being super happy to them because I thought that's how I was supposed to feel all the time. I only ever brought up my negative emotions. I think I just want to be stable. Both extremes are exhausting.
depression,fcn8tlv,t1_fcmb8ab,1577806233.0,Wow. I actually do enjoy writing but it's been really hard to believe anything I write is any good. I'm tearing up a little haha.
depression,fcm936t,t1_fclru4s,1577767537.0,I'll be honest here. The thought of living my life solely for the sake of others makes me want to vomit. But otherwise I get what you're saying.
depression,fclvuf3,t3_ehve2q,1577757713.0,Thank you
depression,fclss6p,t1_fclsgik,1577755583.0,"Yup, I'm pretty terrified right now. But I'm also too exhausted to do anything about it. I'm just hiding under covers for the moment."
AskReddit,eywi0ou,t3_cz2apy,1567529957.0,I played tag next to a ironing board with a hot iron on it. It fell on my leg and I've never known a greater pain lol.
