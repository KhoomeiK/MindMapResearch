It's almost like they want everyone to be impressed with not only how sick they are but how dedicated they are to their job by coming in even though they have the flu. Dude, the only thing you're accomplishing is to get everyone else sick."

People always expect that I miss dairy or meat or eggs, but honestly nowadays I feel nauseated when I even smell those things being cooked."

AskReddit,fcxyewk,t1_fcxdqeq,1578072195.0,"One of my current co-workers has a dog who is so old that she can't move. Something is wrong with her back hips and she literally cannot stand up or move at all. They won't get one of those cute little wheelchair things for her so she can move around; instead they are okay with just leaving this poor dog to lie in the same place all the time. I think they have a harness on her so they can roll her over and stuff (she is a big dog) but that's it. I know the dog is miserable because the co-worker talks all the time about how it keeps her up at night crying. She just ""doesn't have the heart"" to put this dog down. It just really seems selfish to me to keep this animal alive and in misery just so she doesn't have to go through the emotional distress of putting her pet down."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fctzwdf,t1_fctw89t,1577967581.0,"I've realized too that the older folks (at least at my job) don't take on nearly as many tasks and responsibilities as the younger folks. The two boomers in my office have very specific, small-scale responsibilities and everything else is lumped on to the younger people. So, not only do they not need the income because they already own homes and have social security checks and hefty savings, but it's also less stressful for them."

BlackPeopleTwitter,fciflv4,t1_fchft5c,1577661797.0,"This is so correct. Think about every transaction you have every day with different people; people you know and people you don't. You are far more likely to A. Be nice to them and B. Help them if they need help with something if they are being nice and respectful with you. This also goes for people who work in call centers and customer service people.

Yes, it's my job as someone who works very closely with customers and hears a lot of complaints very regularly to try and help everyone, and I will. But if you're nice to me and need something done, I am way more likely to bend the rules."
aww,fchm35t,t1_fch6ja0,1577651709.0,"I have seen videos of dairy farmers calling it a fucking rape rack. Jokingly. Laughing, as if they think it's funny. Watch a documentary called Earthlings. 

It doesn't really matter whether or not the farmers see it as rape. They're desensitized; it actually happens surprisingly quickly with farmers and slaughterhouse workers. They stop seeing the animals as living, feeling beings because they couldn't do their jobs if they didn't. Maybe that's a sign that there's something very wrong with it all. 

""PETA style tactics"", or trying to tell people what happens to the animals who are suffering and being exploited, worked on me. It made me vegan. It made my husband vegan. Watching videos and learning these things is literally the only way to get people to understand what is actually going on. I'd love to know, what is working for you? What would make you stop supporting the animal agriculture industry? I'm sure you know better than I do."

aww,fch3wfn,t1_fcgnt58,1577647029.0,"Idk, chaining an unwilling animal into a tiny pen and shoving your arm elbow-deep inside of them over and over until they get pregnant just because you like the taste of the fluids they make after they've had a baby.. sounds like rape to me. 

It is also colloquially called a rape rack in the actual dairy industry. By dairy farmers.

Edit- but hey, if calling rape something different makes you feel better about drinking cow milk, it's your conscience. Call it whatever you want."

Also, take a real look at some US slaughterhouses and factory farms. Even the ASPCA approved and ""ethical"" ones are literally hell on earth for animals.
