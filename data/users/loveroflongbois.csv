Parenting,ffo3pl8,t1_ffndssy,1580073786.0,"This is pretty much how all cases of selective mutism I’ve seen go. It’s important to accommodate the child so they can still succeed at school, and use constant reassurance that this (school, grocery store, grandma’s house, etc.) is a safe place and teacher/aunt so-and-so/etc. is a safe person. But the kid tends to do what they’re going to do until suddenly, they don’t. It truly is that they just grow out of it. 

My friend’s younger sister had a relatively severe case, she didn’t speak outside of the home until she was a teenager. She’s fine now. She successfully completed her education and is going to college. She has a few friends and is trying to make more."
PublicFreakout,ffm1v29,t1_ffkac28,1580047209.0,"I don’t understand why it’s even that big of a deal to some people. This child seems autistic. It’s not a condemnation on him. I’m sure he’s fine in his day-to-day life, just means he needs extra help in more difficult situations like this. It’s frankly ridiculous that we can’t openly say he acts like he may be on the spectrum without it being this huge affront. Either he is or he isn’t, but either way it’s fine."
PublicFreakout,ffm1ae2,t1_ffkygrv,1580046940.0," I’m gonna assume you’re high functioning, in which case the impairments that come with autism are pretty mild and probably DONT register as a real problem for most people. The kid in the video for example, he’s probably going to be fine in day-to-day adult life. He’ll find his niche. But it’s disingenuous to say that people lower on the spectrum don’t have a disability. Children who literally can’t speak, aren’t completely potty trained, may harm themselves/others ARE disabled. It’s unfair to their caretakers and to the kids themselves to say otherwise."
PublicFreakout,ffm08yl,t1_ffk4waf,1580046471.0,"Yeah, I mean no one is saying this kid is DEFINITELY autistic, just that it seems likely based on the way he speaks and acts in the video. And that’s fine really. Just means he needs a bit of extra help that I hope this school is giving him."
PublicFreakout,fflzfvq,t1_ffk99fx,1580046145.0,"I mean no one is saying this kid is DEFINITELY autistic, just that it’s a possibility based on his behavior."
AmItheAsshole,fffpko1,t1_ffeybwp,1579889026.0,"I mean yeah, that’s what should be happening. She isn’t caring for the kids, so they can’t be in her care. It’s obviously a mental health issue, but it’s also straight up neglect. Honestly the best option is to remove the kids and put them with dad. I cannot understand why that hasn’t happened already."
Adoption,fffjjr1,t3_etb0i8,1579885330.0,"Are you financially dependent on her? If not, it may be time to put some distance between you. If you are, start taking steps to not need to rely on her. Find employment, save up, etc. 

She sounds controlling. Unfortunately many parents feel the need to be in charge of every aspect of their kids’ lives, even well after they reach adulthood. Now that you are grown, you need to start laying boundaries. Your decisions and life are your own, no matter how much she wants to view you as an extension of herself."
AmItheAsshole,ffchn8q,t1_ffbpf3b,1579799661.0,I think you should have posted in /r/relationships or something. If you post here a lot (per your edit) then you know that this isn’t an advice-centered sub.
AmItheAsshole,ffcgz5s,t1_ffbwt3a,1579799250.0,Oh without a doubt. OP sounds insufferable. She tried to frame this as just her wants but toward the end she’s just shitting on her cousin (“freaking Merida”). This is 100% the cousin being prettier than OP and OP wanting to change the cousin’s appearance to feed her own inferiority complex
AmItheAsshole,ffc4ysv,t1_ffc2hry,1579791641.0,Asian babies also have waiting lists and there are virtually no Indian babies in US foster care. I’d wager they did domestic for eldest kid and internationals for the next two.
AmItheAsshole,ffc4thc,t1_ffc2hry,1579791541.0,"I’m telling you right now that it’s unlikely the adoption of the younger two was domestic. There are very few Indian and Chinese babies in the US foster care system. Finding one is close to impossible, to the point that many adoption agencies will turn away families who only want kids of that background (my agency being one of them). Most of those kids are from overseas. As for the eldest child, he likely was adopted domestically. Which really makes me concerned that OP intentionally picked kids based on race. If they just wanted to raise children and didn’t care, they wouldn’t have gone out of their way to do an international adoption after a likely much easier/cheaper domestic one. 

I realize I’m assuming a lot here but with OP refusing to answer questions about how he adopted the kids all we can do is speculate."

relationships,ff9jwlc,t3_ese7pa,1579714573.0,"It’s best if you just don’t engage with him.  Give him statements to shut down the argument before he starts: “I’m not going to talk to a bigot, your opinions don’t merit a response. Good luck going through life saying stuff like that, you’ll need it.” 

If he continues to escalate and won’t leave you alone, talk to your teachers or counselor. This counts as abuse I believe, so they’ll probably involve the authorities. You are a minor, so it is your mother’s responsibility to shut down his behavior. If she can’t/won’t, more drastic measures need to be taken."
trashy,ff67jo4,t1_ff5k0bt,1579620999.0,That’s absolutely insane. Literally who cares if he’s married. Does getting married affect your ability to dance and sing?? Does being a K-pop idol have a hidden requirement of fucking other women?
aww,ff39mhp,t1_ff35n1z,1579536924.0,"If you honestly believe that then check this thread. There are around a 100 comments at the bottom of this thread who got downvoted to hell for saying such crimes against humanity as “so cute!” Or “mlem”. The circle jerk is around hating pit bulls, not loving them. Evidenced by the fact that there’s a bunch of comments saying stuff like “he’s ready to eat some babies” sitting at 10-15 upvotes while completely inoffensive comments saying the dog is cute got downvoted. 

The pit bull haters brigade every post on these subreddits that feature pit bulls. It sucks. I come here to look at cute animals, not see hate and advocating for fucking euthanizing the dogs in the pics. How is this even allowed."
aww,ff38sip,t1_ff30q5h,1579536386.0,I’m sorry you got downvoted for missing your dog :( I can’t believe that people are so preoccupied with hating a breed that they’d downvote a comment expressing nothing but love.
aww,ff38ltz,t1_ff37prs,1579536264.0,"Because it’s a pit bull in the post. There’s a community of people (their homebase is a sub called /r/banpitbulls ) who downvote brigade any posts on the aww subs that feature pit bulls, and any positive comments expressing the cuteness of the dog. Don’t let it get to you. They’re pathetic."
television,ff33fw2,t1_ff2zk0q,1579532687.0,This is also how I reccomend doing it. Carve out time for a double feature of both. Grave of the fireflies is an important work but it’s inevitably depressing. Totoro is a no-brainer palate cleanser.
relationships,fekefjp,t3_epcje1,1579198324.0,"Sounds like you’re quite pretty and she making these subtle digs because she feels inadequate. It’s shitty behavior but easy to see through. 

You feel shitty because that’s the goal of her behavior, to put you down so she can raise herself up. 

It’s best to just remember that her comments are coming from a place of jealousy and insecurity, they’re far from fact. Be comfortable in the fact that you’re objectively attractive enough to elicit this kind of response from others. Honestly I wouldn’t want to be around a person who feels like they need to put others down to feel better about themselves."
namenerds,fejzdou,t3_epelbk,1579189289.0,I have a Disney Princess name. I’ve gotten the same 5 jokes on an endless loop for my entire adult life.
Adoption,fehsz2r,t3_ep7s6o,1579123259.0,"This is a complicated issue that you and your husband need to hash out with a therapist. 

You can also call a reputable adoption agency to speak to a social worker for some general information about the logistics of the process.

No one can tell you if it’s the right or wrong choice. You and your spouse are the ones who know yourselves, your children, and your family. 

Take it slow and think things out completely. Like I said, recruit professionals, talk to a therapist/social worker. If you don’t feel like relatives/friends could support your decision ether way, it’s best not to tell them. This a choice only for you and husband."
relationship_advice,fednw7a,t1_fed347o,1579016056.0,"Do not respond to these people. You’re giving them exactly what they came here for. I understand because I do the same thing, scroll down to the depths of humanity past the outpouring of positive support. The more you interact with them the more they feel legitimized. Downvote, report, and move on."
namenerds,fediz5t,t3_eolk0c,1579012732.0,"I think it’s a solid, classic name, and I don’t heavily associate it with anything in particular. IMO it feels like one of those names that only works in adulthood (plus I hate the nickname Marty). But that’s a common problem with honor names so it’s nbd."
namenerds,fecoa25,t3_eogbvs,1578978967.0,"Namenerds thinks that Harper is overused and too trendy. Personally I love it. 

I also don’t really mind -ayden names. I wouldn’t use one myself, but it’s a pleasant sound and I can see why they got so popular."
AmItheAsshole,fe0clzu,t1_fdzyxsw,1578809885.0,"He’s still the asshole for making a scene, losing his temper with her over something stupid, and most importantly for the ridiculous double standard that he’s allowed his female massage therapist but she’s not allowed a male one."
AmItheAsshole,fdnj7b5,t1_fdmqi3t,1578586932.0,Thanks for commenting! I was also going to mention this. It’s very easy to hurt a cat while shaving it.
namenerds,fdhiaux,t3_elfibw,1578423239.0,"I agree with everything said here,. I was wondering can’t you just go by your middle name instead? Flora is uncommon but it’s a real name at least. Also I don’t know what field you’re in but many women I know in academia just use initials in publications, to avoid gender bias but it would solve the same issue."
relationships,fdgvcav,t1_fdgu7t6,1578409239.0,"I agree, the whole post is basically moot after that. Call child services. Go back to court."
namenerds,fddsaf0,t1_fdbtmgp,1578322678.0,I do love Ophelia but I worry it only really has Lia as a nickname.
