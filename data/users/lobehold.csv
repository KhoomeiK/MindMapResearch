ottawa,fffryra,t1_ffd745q,1579890505.0,"It's a chicken and egg problem, transit usually gets invested only when there's a need, but ""need"" basically means traffic is hell and people complaining loudly. Because if traffic is good people aren't incentivized to ride public transit so you don't have enough ridership to justify the outlay.

So you kinda have to crawl through the sewers in order to obtain freedom a la Shawshank Redemption.

If you develop the city to avoid traffic problems all you get is more sprawl, and then you end up with 2 hour commutes and shitty traffic anyways.

TLDR: you need a lot of disgruntled commuters for the ridership base to make investing in transit worth it."

Don't put too much weight on having a support network, especially if you're still functional. All a support network can do is for you to blow off some steam, nobody can solve the actual problem (or learn to cope with it) except for yourself.

Plus people have their own shit to deal with, I didn't know one of my friend was also suffering from depression until I opened up to him. When you're depressed you focus on your own depression intensely but the world still exists, and doesn't revolve solely around you.

Look at it this way, how much did you help your friends? Did you try to get to know their problem and offer support? Why are they suddenly on the hook to be on your beck and call?

At the end of the day nobody owns you anything, and it's something you have to deal with yourself no matter how much support you get."
TMJ,fcxv3pu,t3_ejb9c6,1578070854.0,"Yep, when I was at my worst.

Your jaw is fucked up right now so it's not functioning properly and open/close at the correct angle.

My advise is rest, rest and more rest. Don't ""test"" your jaw by keep moving it.

The greatest improvement in my TMJ was when I had impacted wisdom teeth surgery and couldn't eat solid food and couldn't open my mouth wide for like 2 weeks straight (also was on Ibuprofen).

At the end of the 2 weeks I finally opened my jaw (which was feeling really stiff) and I had the most amazing feeling ever stretching it out and it made like a dozen loud cracks and squishing sounds (cartilage stretching) and I felt a hell of a lot better.

Goes to show how much rest helps."

bapcsalescanada,fcw79p7,t1_fcw624d,1578018768.0,"There's such a thing as induced demand, as in if you have a lot of storage you will think of ways to make use of it, even though you're probably just fine without it.

Personally I rock a 500GB SSD and a 3TB USB hard drive and I don't use even half of it with all the streaming available nowadays."

bapcsalescanada,fcw3671,t1_fcvzk9x,1578016071.0,"Do you not have a computer right now? If you can utilize it now then buy it.

If you're just going to keep it sealed up in a box somewhere for a year, I think that's a bad idea. Storage gets cheaper all the time, even if NAND gets 40% more expensive that's 40% on the price 1 year from now, which could be half of what you're paying today while being faster."
bapcsalescanada,fcvxtgi,t3_ej3ura,1578012548.0,"Remember to just buy what you need, not what you *think* you will need.

Cheap storage you never use is money wasted, not money saved."
ottawa,fcvxgtk,t3_eildlu,1578012317.0,"I get it man, housing is shit right now.

I also understand not wanting to live in the outer suburbs, I left Barrhaven and moved near city center this past summer because I am battling depression and being in the suburb is a big contributor to it.

But man, you got to sacrifice something to live in desirable areas, I know you ragged on some houses by saying they're ""a piece of garbage"", but in this market that's the price you pay.

I bought a fixer upper with rusted siding, uneven floor and holes near the foundation because it's the only thing I can afford in the area I want to live in, and honestly it's not too bad. Yes there's tons of work to fix it up but it doesn't have to be all done at once, you can space it out and do it a little at a time.

Remember, location is everything, if you are willing to sacrifice a little short term comfort you can lock down a place now and slowly fix it up later.

If you don't lock down a place, even if it's ""garbage"" you won't be able to afford ANYTHING in a few years, garbage or not."
depression,fcvpg2q,t3_ej1l29,1578007136.0,"I have supportive friends and family, I have people who are there for me and listen to my problems, but it only release some pressure temporarily, it all comes back in a day or two.

After a month or two I just stopped talking altogether, because I said everything that is there to say, I'm still having the same problems, so no point repeating the same thing to my friends and family over and over and burn them out for no reason.

I know you're frustrated, I recommend you to unload all your real feelings to people you trust (or a therapist), but know that at the end of the day, the most that people can do is listen to your rants, you still have to deal with this yourself.

I know what you're talking about, we just become a shell of a person, no interest, no passion, no hobby, just living life on auto-pilot like a robot. It does suck.

What I didn't realize early on that I figured out later, is that a big part of depression is being depressed about HAVING depression. It kind of builds on itself. Being uninterested, unmotivated, unfeeling, and not being able to do anything about it, is in itself depressing.

So your depression is really a smaller core of depression over actual shitty things about yourself, and then a big outer layer of depression over the fact that you are depressed.

You may not be able to do much about the inner core in the short term, but you can at least get rid of outer layer which is basically you beating yourself up over the fact you're depressed. 

We are already pretty fucked up being depressed, no need to kick ourselves when we're already down.

While we're being depressed, we're so stressed out, so concentrated on BEING depressed, we don't have time to have a personality, being depressed becomes a full time job, it slowly occupies more and more of our time and personality until very little is left.

So to actually have our interests and passion back we need to drain our stress, anxiety and depression out. The less we concentrate on being depressed, the more room there is for good feelings to flow back in.

So don't concentrate on having passion and interests, the only thing you need to do is relax and open up enough space for those positive feelings to move in."

Seriously just go see a doctor and let him/her take a look and put your fears to rest.

WTF,fcpep9x,t1_fcpcuz7,1577860760.0,"Well, we're all dying, growing old that is... hell you could die in a traffic accident tomorrow. There's so many more likely sources of danger there's no point worrying over a remote possibility. If you worry about every unlikely thing you'll just go into a fetal position unable to move.

At a certain point you just have to throw your hands up and go ""fuck it"" and just let it go. Back when I had the ""night sweats"" and lumps it took me around a month and a half. At the end of it I was so god damn tired from all the worrying I don't have the strength to keep caring anymore and did exactly that - said ""fuck it"" and just let it go."

WTF,fcpcc4c,t1_fcpbic1,1577858067.0,"So relax. Chances are absolutely remote you have anything at all.

Hell your night sweating could very well be from your own anxiety and stress. Just calm down and live your life and try to put this behind you."
