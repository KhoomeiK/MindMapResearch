TooAfraidToAsk,fflnbde,t1_ffl8rv3,1580041767.0,"I’m Australian and no household has a bidet either. We’re getting a fancy ass toilet with a built in one, I wonder if I could add a foot pedal to it for all my no armed friends (haha who am I kidding I don’t have any friends)."
TooAfraidToAsk,ffl0glf,t1_ffkxqa6,1580032516.0,Yooo that’s genius I never thought of that.
AskReddit,ffk2ejy,t1_ffhmqf8,1580013707.0,"I agree with your views but would also argue that a lot of the “fat acceptance” community has the same viewpoint as body positivity, but that there is a very vocal minority of people who give it a bad name like utterly obese people saying “healthy at every size” etc. 

This is not how the majority of people think and this is definitely not how every fat person views themselves. For example, general fat acceptance pushes for larger clothing sizes while the vocal Internet minority pushes for them to remove smaller sizes and encourages people to not lose weight (as you said)."
AskReddit,ff988q9,t1_ff8oi2s,1579707122.0,"To be fair, people usually turn on the radio for music, and then get 10 songs an hour mixed in with the hosts making sexual innuendos for stupid segments and a hundred adverts. I could put on Spotify and listen to ANYTHING. Even without premium its like 4-5 songs before 45 seconds of ad. Sports and news will be the only reason radio and television stay alive in the future."

AskReddit,ff95j4j,t3_es53p0,1579705338.0,People who just recount things that happen in movies/shows/videogames/books all the time. Like “haha in (piece of media) this guy does this and this and it’s funny because (large explanation of other things that happened in that world) haha and he says this and this” like ok I am not particularly interested. It’s ok if it’s just once or twice every now and then but when it’s all the time Jesus... involve yourself in the real world...
Toyota,ff951t9,t1_ff90ebn,1579705015.0,Aw thanks! It has a few tiny cosmetic issues that are cleverly hidden by angles and pixels haha and the engine is slightly funky but otherwise it’s awesome!
Toyota,ff8v4q0,t1_ff8syxw,1579697141.0,Thank you so so so much! Also shoutout to Brisbane lmao.

NoStupidQuestions,ff8mg70,t3_es4khz,1579685814.0,I can’t read plays because I can’t distinguish between speakers using names. I need clear visuals.

Toyota,ff7z88k,t3_es5pn8,1579661899.0,"The seller said that there were only about 200 manufactured in Australia (or something like that, not that it’s *super* rare like the Delorean but I think it’s cool). Others have told me it can’t be from 1983 because it’s a convertible and they didn’t make any convertible Celicas that year, or that it was converted from a coupe (it’s registered as a coupe but all the paperwork says it was manufactured as a convertible). I’m mind boggled. Love the car though, even with a few cosmetic issues and a leaky cooling system (getting it fixed dw).  :)"
RoastMe,ff623kf,t3_ernxxd,1579617183.0,You look like you took that entire outfit right out of Pinterest because you don’t have the ability to form your own style.

videos,ff3c7ld,t3_erc20b,1579538277.0,I’ve noticed this with literally everything.
NoStupidQuestions,ff3c1e3,t3_er1vm8,1579538192.0,You gotta take a leap of faith. I got a call and my phone said it was from China. I picked it up and instead of a spam caller it was my friend (sacrificing her parents’ wallets to pay for the long distance call). Then I get a call from a state away and I know it’s spam because who the fuck would be calling me from there? Just shoot me a text.
creepyPMs,ff38l9h,t1_ff37ufo,1579536253.0,Ikr? I thought the majority wanted their first time to be with someone special. And I’d rather be with someone I love than a rando creep.
creepyPMs,ff2zpc2,t1_ff2w3ks,1579529717.0,He goes to an all-boys school and is seemingly heterosexual so his horny has probably been repressed due to lack of female.
HellsItch,ff2zi6t,t1_ff2xq9o,1579529548.0,"It’s passed for me now (thank fuck omfg). Mine only really lasted the 1 day with 2 more of much more bearable small flare ups as it died down. I was slapping the shit out of my back and sitting under boiling water because pain was so much better than itch. I think I have genuine ptsd every time I get a regular itch on my back, arm or chest. The first day of Hell’s Itch was at least the second worst day of my life. The first was just a week before New Years recently when the vet diagnosed my dog with cancer but they undiagnosed her with it a few days after (tests were clear) so in hindsight Hell’s Itch was probably THE worst day of my life."
AskReddit,ff2v5qg,t3_er424v,1579525395.0,"Pro: enough stuff to do I guess, moderately priced, aesthetically pleasing if you like grungey, small city vibes.
Cons: the cool grungey places are all being gentrified, public transport is shit, parking is shit and expensive, no jobs, hot, houses are shit and expensive. 

Do love it though. If I can afford a decent house within an hour of the city I’ll probably stay here my whole life (which sounds depressing)."
creepyPMs,ff2ooov,t1_ff2a23s,1579516700.0,That’s what makes it so bad and why I show everyone lmao. If he was like “I wanna fuck u bb” I’d be like gross and brush it off but this is just such a pathetic attempt at being slick it’s hilarious (and creepy).
creepyPMs,ff2nfls,t1_ff2ndsk,1579514765.0,"Exactly! Why lose ur virginity to some creep and have it be all sloppy and awkward before, during, and after?"
creepyPMs,ff2mfkz,t1_ff2mb10,1579513207.0,Oh for sure. He’s the biggest narcissist I know. He tries to make me jealous “omg this girl was so checking me out she’s so annoying ugh :/“ like okay lmao ?
creepyPMs,ff2gn4k,t1_ff2ghgt,1579505303.0,"He was 100% serious. I’d been homie-zoning him for a while, hence the use of “homie” a shitload."

AskReddit,feyn0cy,t1_fetl0sb,1579447774.0,Somewhat similar but I remember kids at school singing Twenty One Pilots’ “Stressed Out”. It was released the year after I left that school.
AskReddit,feph7tk,t3_epp36x,1579320420.0,I really want a film camera and materials to develop at home. Everyone says to look in thrift stores but the thrifts stores around me are all clothes and kitchenware.
