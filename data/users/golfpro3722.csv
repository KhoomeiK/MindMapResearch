To me this is a no-brainer but I guess the problem is that we want to feel justified in cheating or stealing when we can exploit a weakness in the system.  We don't want to feel like crooks when we're being a crook.  Really, honestly, truly and sincerely, my only point to the conversation is this is not a trick, it's intentional theft.  You ought to think about it.  If you want to do it, then it's on you but it's not a trick.  It's theft.  We've all stolen.  We'll probably all steal again especially in retail situations.  But this isn't a mere trick.  It's an intentional theft and you filmed it and posted it.  Nothing will probably every come of it...but some jackass in an HR department may use facial recognition and search for you someday when the tech improves and this could pop up.  That 50K a year salary that you're hoping to land won't be yours and you may never know why."

Look at the current government of the U.S.  The evangelicals and the Trump Administration are looking to enshrine discrimination in housing, employment, and other services, such as medical care against homosexuals and attach it to civil rights legislation.

funny,ff2yoeh,t1_ff2ydvg,1579528829.0,"It's theft by deception.  The poster demonstrated premeditation.

I fill out surveys on my register tape and get a free large sandwich with every one I buy, nearly every time I go.  NOW THAT, is a free sandwich.

My only point being, I don't think that he knows that he's filming himself committing a crime.  He thinks it's okay.  He doesn't understand that doing something like this can cause you legal troubles.  Just because you can doesn't mean that you should.  I took the time to mention, hey this is stealing, just so he understands.  It's not a trick.  Pulling a rabbit out of a top hat is a trick."

edit: anecdotal: A few days before Christmas I received a large order from Omaha Steaks that was sitting on my front porch when I returned home from shopping.  It was my address but not my name.  There was a phone number for the buyer, I called it and got voice mail.  The area code was Toledo and I live 6 hours south and east from there.  Lots of new neighbors here so I had no clue.  I tried searching for them on the web to no avail.  I called Omaha Steaks and they informed me that they would contact the buyer.  This happened on a Friday.  I put everything in the freezer.  By Sunday after no phone calls from anybody and no one picking it up, we figured that no one was coming for it, especially since it was perishable food.  We ate a package of Kielbasa Sunday night.  Lo and behold Monday evening I get a knock on the door and two grandchildren of new neighbors two doors down came looking for their package.  I was embarrassed as hell.  At least I stuck it all in my freezer for them right away.  I thought that there was no way that anyone was coming for it after four days.  Good thing for them that we didn't dig into the filet.
