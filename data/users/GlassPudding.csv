unpopularopinion,fehj9v3,t3_ep2slk,1579117680.0,pretty sure he and his wife used reddit a lot. i think she was into that. shes just taking a nap. i get your point but i think attaching a *link to the post was pretty inappropriate.*
TwoXChromosomes,fefgq42,t3_eovdqq,1579055966.0,I have read that the vast majority of women who terminate later believe it was the right thing to do down the road. Trust your gut
stopdrinking,feddest,t3_eodwvt,1579008378.0,"not going through the same situation exactly but am working through a breakup. 

> I'm so heartbroken, but I have so much to be thankful for. 

amazing to have the clarity to feel this way. I have heard, it is easy to be grateful when things are going well. It is when things re difficult that gratitude is hardest to find but most healing and beneficial. thanks for sharing this story, i needed to hear it too. breakups are fucking tough, but you sound tougher. good luck"

MadeMeSmile,fcaxyr4,t1_fcax3wg,1577578821.0,"I was living with my long term partner, I thought we were happy. It was snowing a lot and we lived across from a beautiful park. I remember sitting on the porch watching the snow and listening to the silence and being glad for where I was. I remember making a Reddit account to post pictures of snowmen. I would have had no idea that we would end up moving less than two months later, that we would break up 6 months later, that I would buy a house alone 11 months later. We tried to make it work but final nail in the coffin a couple weeks ago. It was a really, really hard year. My vision for my future has completely changed. I don’t know what’s next or what’s in store for me but I’m *finally* starting to see the light ahead"
