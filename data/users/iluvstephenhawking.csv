This whole graph is pretty messed up. Some of the colors of the viruses are not even in the key like dark brown and orange. Why isn't HIV colored as body fluid?

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,ffqmh2c,t3_eu81nz,1580138514.0,I hate spending $300 at the salon and being angry when I get home. Last time I went I wanted pink ombre and they gave me orange! I was so mad. I ended up going to Sally's and dying it the pink I wanted myself because I was at least happy with the way he lightened it. Bleaching my own hair always scares me but I found putting coconut oil on it before the bleach really helps prevent extreme damage.
Justrolledintotheshop,ffqlsei,t1_ffqkzyx,1580138020.0,"It is true. My friend had her first car for 8 years and never had an oil change. Her dad would just top it off with oil whenever it was low so how can I blame her? My mom taught me how to do oil changes, change a tire (and what not to do on a donut), and few other things so that is how I know basic car maintenance. But if your parents tell you that topping it off if is fine then there is no reason not to believe them. Who knows what went wrong that her dad thought that was ok."

LifeProTips,ffq1tt7,t1_ffni5yx,1580115735.0,Long time ago when my boyfriend's roommate moved out and we took the master bedroom in which the roommate kept his 1 sugar glider there were little poops all over the walls somehow. I remember taking a toothbrush and scrubbing tiny poops off a lightswitch and spots on walls where I guess the sugar glider hung out. I asked my boyfriend wtf was wrong with his roommate that he let the pet not only poop everywhere but also never cleaned it up. Maybe he just gave up.
ChoosingBeggars,ffq1dni,t3_euj03d,1580115049.0,It is funny that even with silly rush jobs like this you can tell the artist is a good artist. Even taking my time I doubt I would even be able to make the right lines to make the shape of realistic car.

A standard stick of butter is 8 tablespoons. Our butter has measurements on the wrapping dividing it into tablespoons so a butter company can't just decide to shortchange that unlike a package of chocolate morsels. That is not standard.
videos,ff3isp7,t1_ff3i1z0,1579541940.0,The problem is that they used package size not imperial. If they just put any sort of weight or volume it still would have been fine. Do you not understand that? 16 ounces of something does not change.
videos,ff3hmmk,t1_ff3fk7a,1579541223.0,That doesn't make sense. If they had put 16 oz of whatever then they would have been ok. the ounce didn't change the amount in the package did.

They don't enjoy the same stuff therefore cannot enjoy being together because one is always going to be upset with what they are doing. He wants to be out and drinking she wants to be home eating bland food while not talking. They should do them but separately.
