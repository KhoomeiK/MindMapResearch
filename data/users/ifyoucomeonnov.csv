If you want those things there are children's hospital charities that will gladly take your donations. There are countless gofundme pages for kids going through college. 

You have to remember that you're situation isn't representative of everyone else. I live in a country with high tax rates and high welfare. I didn't go to university. I don't have kids. I am a healthy young adult. I pay $5k a year in taxes. I live below the poverty line. If minimum wage increases I will plunge even further below the poverty line. If taxes increase I will plunge further below the poverty line. My experience is no more representative than yours, but before you force everyone to pay for other people, consider the people that have to pay while earning just enough to lose out on all the welfare. If my tax rate was decreased by 50% I would have another $2.5k a year to save. It might not seem like much, but when it comes to a deposit on a house, or even getting to enjoy life a bit more, it makes all the difference."

~~that because you are using your phone before you sleep . your eyes turn kind black and white vision on dark areas so you can see better on night so when open your phone your eyes get tired from switch between the normal vision and black and white vision so automatically you don't sleep because you are feeling sleepy you sleep because your eyes are exhausted and tired so if you sleep with out using you phone while you are on the bed you will wake up healthier then ever~~"
