As for new players, they won't know what the stickers/locations mean, so what's the harm in having them on the board."

rpg,ff8xw7t,t3_es98jx,1579699623.0,"We had a fight in our gaming group a couple decades ago that almost ruined our friendship. Half of the group was playing with the intent to ""succeed"" in the campaign. The other half (which I was in) decided to roleplay their characters whatever the cost in the story. So when the GM put my ex-lover as our final enemy, my character sided with her while trying to stop the conflict.

The adventuring group had been together for a few months of game time, the nemesis was the mother of my (character's) two dead children. My character made a simple choice. And I LOVED that the GM put me in such a terrible situation, because this is exactly what we play for. 3 players at the table had a very different opinion and refused to finish the scenario.

I would never be pissed at someone for my character's death. This is part of the game, the risks are real. Especially if it come out of great roleplay. I hope that once the shock of the loss of his character gone, your player can get behind the idea. Or his teammate have a quest to raise him now :P"
gamedesign,ff8xb08,t1_ff8ukkr,1579699112.0,"You can be a AI developper. Or a sprite animator. Or be in charge of data manipulation.

If you work in a AAA company, you'll be specialized and need to know your tool very well. If you're a solo indie game designer, you need to know a little of everything. The rest is very dependent on what you want to do. It is never a bad idea ton know HOW a game works and what are the tools and processes needed even if you don't master them.

But being a jack of all trade with no strong point will be hard. you need to know what part of game design you REALLY want to focus on, **if you want to join a team**."

letsplay,feqiulb,t1_fep7mm5,1579342391.0,"**Wrong, it has nothing yo do with haters**. Responding with grace to haters shut them off and the two examples given by dezdicardo are good example of that. Never feed the troll. Even if they just try to be destructive, being nice and use your ""customer service voice"" will stop them. Their goal is to get under your skin. Show them that they can't and you win. 

And NEVER answer as soon as you see something bad or trollish. Wait 24h, cool down and be nice. This is how I grow a niche channel (French pen&paper RPG) to 2K sub in slightly over 1 year. 

Taking everything with grace also got me in the good graces of publishers. And that is pretty sweet :)"

Gemcraft maybe good (I only played a couple of hours of the first one, not my cup of tea), but calling the grandaddy of Tower Defense is showing a lack of regard towards video game history. Which was my Engineering Degree final memoir subject :)
