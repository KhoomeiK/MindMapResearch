I live in California, every year our state burns -- and this happens to thousands of animals.  Australia is burning in enormous scale, and the fires devour everything.

I'm glad this cat is alive, and came home, because to add to the trauma of the fires and losing everything, the utmost of trauma is believing your pet didn't make it.   Seeing the pets and wildlife burnt and hurt and not understanding why they are hurting breaks my heart.  Then it takes 10 months to get out of that heartache and another fires hits and another lot suffers."

VanLife,fdbswgc,t1_fda076x,1578261542.0,"> Since you have a T1n, what are your thoughts on the linked build and price

I bought a pro-built Airstream interstate 2006 with 65k miles for less than that earlier this year. Leather all around, full tanks, AC/Furnace, generator/propane, spectacular bathroom, the works.  So there is that. I think the price is a little high and you can get a real RV for the same. ""stealth"" is so over romanticized, it's super clear when somebody lives in their Stealth van anyway.  People have issues with junk-vans, not with good ones.

my T1N has been amazing, it just took me to SoCal where it snowed, and it drove like a dream through Super high winds and heavy rain, it behaved well in snowy icy conditions, it starts first time every time, and runs as far as I desire.  It's a tremendous vehicle.
