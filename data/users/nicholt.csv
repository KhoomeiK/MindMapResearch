solotravel,ffmolv5,t1_ffjvbtl,1580057319.0,"Not op, but I would say a rental car is almost a necessity. You'd be much more efficient with your time if you had one. The Big island is, well, big and you're gonna want a car.

Edit: and rent a 4x4 for the the big island. I rented a civic and I wrecked it on a rock sitting on the highway. Not to mention the island is new and the surface is hard as hell. So any grid roads you go on are not like you're used to. Very sketchy in a car."

When I lived in Australia, a bunch of my British friends had experience with it. All I know is I saw a guy on ket once and he had me make sure his legs were still real. That doesn't seem like a positive high to me lol. Though I didn't really know that it was a psychedelic until recently. I might have tried it otherwise.

His near death experience story is what most interested me. Saying it was like a dmt trip. I've listened to that episode 3 times I think. 

And an update, I've listened to the first 3:30 hrs of the dmt couch session. And what to say... I feel like I got 0.1% of the experience of dmt just listening to it. Realllly makes me want to figure out how tf to procure dmt for real. Though I'd really struggle to find someone to do it with.

Drugs,fffmtdt,t3_et9p0g,1579887345.0,"Idk, I feel like if I was a parent I would have a very hard time knowing what a user looks like. I can tell when someone's on meth now pretty easily, and of course someone who is drunk, but some drugs are sneaky. I don't think anyone can tell when I'm high on weed for example. I don't laugh like crazy and my eyes don't get red. No one has ever said anything and my dad still talks shit about weed in front of me even though it's legal here. So I figure he must not know. And as for coke, one of my best friends was a coke addict and I had no idea for about 2 months, I thought he was just really charismatic. I mean, he was in a very successful job and was very smart. Not easy to tell then imo."
apexlegends,ffflzdb,t1_ffflmra,1579886836.0,Thusly defeating the entire purpose of the ping. Cause you have no idea if they're actually pinging an enemy or if they are just annoying. Too many have cried wolf with the 1000x ping method that I don't trust any of them.
apexlegends,fffl5ls,t3_et4mu6,1579886330.0,"Two things:

1 - Seems like zero randoms I play with use pings at all. If you're gonna run off a mile in a random direction, at least ping that you're going there so I know what you're doing. Ping anything and everything. It makes the game better. But I guess it's my fault for solo queuing public matches.

2 - I hope season 4 brings back the challenge badges that for some reason only season 1 had. Like there was a badge in s1 for getting 100 kills with 8 different legends. Those are the challenges I like to complete. But there haven't been any new badges recently like that, aside from event specific ones."

UnresolvedMysteries,fff9c5i,t1_ffdxa6n,1579878914.0,"It's because of the giant lie we are told daily that being rich and famous will be the answer to everything. Most people looking up at Amy or Britney think they have it all, because that's what we are led to believe. So in turn, when they see them 'screwing' up they see it as squandering their opportunity and taking their success for granted. But the reality is, all the money in the world doesn't solve any fundamental individual problems. It's just not possible. Mo money mo problems, as they say. You have to deal with the constant pressure to be great and the constant ridicule when you don't meet someone's expectations. I think it would be horrible to be that famous, yet so many strive to get there for some reason.

I resonate a lot with Duncan and his attitude towards wild shit. Like he understands some stuff is crazy but he's willing to consider the possibility of it being legit. Which is exactly how I am. Of course Crystal therapy seems batshit, but I'll try it, just to make sure."

CanadianInvestor,ffd5fwr,t3_esxznk,1579813781.0,"Like others said, I'm bothered by how long it takes to deposit money. But it seems like the only reasonable option to buy stocks with a low balance. Like if I'm only able to buy $100 worth of stocks, it doesn't work if the fee is even $5, cause that's already 5% of your gains squashed. With 0 fee it allows you to build from a smaller starting point. 

I also don't like that you need 10% surplus in your account to make a trade (or 15% I don't recall). So if you want to spend $159 of your $165 account, it won't let you."
EngineeringStudents,ffcxxos,t1_ffckgol,1579809567.0,"Yeah I knew some kids who probably would be reading engineering textbooks even if they weren't in university. I don't know how you develop a passion for reservoir modelling, but I guess it's possible cause I've seen it."
rareinsults,ffcxhpb,t1_ffcwhmx,1579809315.0,"Well I suppose, but this isn't even a 'real' cryptocurrency. Do some more digging on it and you'll see what I mean. Talking out my ass so bare with me: There is no technology behind it at all. The company lies to everyone that there will be a fiat exchange soon, but it's never coming. When people buy 'onecoin' they get nothing in return. They just change the numbers in the backend because there is no encryption and no 'blockchain'. So someone buys $10000 Onecoin it's now magically worth $20000 cause they say so, but there is no way to even withdraw your onecoin so it's a total sham. It's not like Bitcoin where at least every BTC is unique and cannot be changed."

Dr Death - Dr who totally fucked up every surgery he ever did and never thought he was doing anything wrong. It's hard to say if he was being deliberately malicious, but it seems like he really thought he was doing things properly.

Dr. Ruja Ignatova - Started the 'cryptocurrency' Onecoin, which essentially is made up and totally worthless. Scammed people out of BILLIONS of dollars. Promised people they would get rich quick, but the currency has no use. It's more complicated than that, but whatever. Also somehow accidentally created a cult around Onecoin (though it wasn't her intention I don't think). People who speak against Onecoin and call it a scam are labeled 'haters' and are ignored (much like suppressive persons from Scientology).

I've lived in Sydney and Melbourne (which are higher than Toronto on this list) and both of them I would say were quite affordable with an entry level job (I earned \~$25/hr in both cities). Buying a house in either place would be insanely expensive, but for some reason, rent wasn't that exorbitant.

CrazyIdeas,ffc4q8k,t1_ffbf832,1579791480.0,"Well I've noticed that for most people, music isn't that personal of a thing.

Like how many of these 'soulmates' would just be people who have both listened to 100 hours of Billie Eilish and nothing else (she's great actually, but I hope you get my point).

It's rare that I meet people who constantly seek out new unique music in the way I do. I don't necessarily care if someone listens to the same exact music as me, but being into music at all is a major major bonus. But if I find someone who listens to the same obscure electronic music artist, it's pretty much a guarantee we can be friends. Only has happened 3 or 4 times in my life."

fitmeals,ff3sndz,t1_ff3ptyw,1579547985.0,"I will try that next, thanks. I just got the middle-road whey concentrate in chocolate peanut butter and the flavor is lackluster. Thankfully it's not artificially sweet, just lacks any punch. But as long as protein mixes well and doesn't make me gag I consider that to be a win."
EngineeringStudents,ff3rwfy,t3_er58ni,1579547525.0,"I remember once practicing the damned squiggles over an entire page in my notebook to figure out a way to write it neatly. Anyone who saw probably thought I was trying to summon a dark lord. I did get it eventually, but I just tried writing after many years and I lost the knack."
solotravel,ff3l2k8,t3_er8aoc,1579543329.0,"I am constantly listening to new music and trying to find cool stuff, so every 2 months I make a new spotify playlist and add standout songs to them. I've been doing this since May 2017 and it has been one of the most valuable things I've ever done.

I can pick a playlist from back then and instantly be transported back to the time I made it. Usually I can remember the exact moment I discovered a good song for the first time. I also give each playlist a title that kinda describes the time. For example: ""May/June 2018 - Corporate Life Sydney"" ([https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0pxH4aVsS5V2gUMF2cbKRz?si=cDCgUg9GSUOLI9ugYG5hxg](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0pxH4aVsS5V2gUMF2cbKRz?si=cDCgUg9GSUOLI9ugYG5hxg))

I lived in Australia for 2 years doing a bunch of different shit, and these playlists help to separate them in my mind. They are extremely good for when you want a good dose of nostalgia. I also have this feeling that I will appreciate these a great deal when I get older. Right now I already love that I did this, and it's only been 2 years.

I recommend it!"
solotravel,ff3ka3c,t1_ff2baxp,1579542848.0,Emotion was also the soundtrack to my US road trip I did throughout the west. The title track is especially awesome.
fitmeals,ff3jthg,t3_erf5mk,1579542568.0,"It's still expensive af in Canada tho.

For my Canadian friends, look at [canadianprotein.ca](https://canadianprotein.ca) , very similar to Myprotein with their offerings, but cheaper. 

Looking at each company's affordable protein:

Myprotein - 5.5 lbs - $83.99 ($15.27/lb) - 22.8g protein/30g scoop

Canadianprotein - 4.4 lbs - $29.99 ($6.82/lb) - 21g protein/30g scoop

...this isn't an ad, I just am really happy they exist, cause usually we Canadians get shafted."
PersonalFinanceCanada,ff3hi52,t1_ff1t16c,1579541145.0,"Maybe it's cause I grew up in Regina and hate it, but Saskatoon has always seemed like a much better city. It's prettier, has a better university, has that cool walking street part (forget the name). Too much of Regina is a wasteland. It's like Winnipeg in that respect. Just super boring and dead to look at. If you never leave the southwest of Regina though, one would probably enjoy living here a lot."
PersonalFinanceCanada,ff3gz6s,t1_ff29ju7,1579540824.0,Seems like you have an amazing rental price. I lived in Sunalta for a work term and it was $1000 just for a room in an apartment.
AskReddit,ff2676x,t3_eqx8y1,1579494938.0,"Well I just bought a $20 pepper grinder because the one I had only 1 micron of pepper per minute. Then shortly after trying the new one, I realized the top screw actually works as an adjustment for the grind size. I had it all the way tightened and so it was on the smallest size. This bothers me a lot, because $20 is absurd for a pepper grinder, but it was somehow the cheapest option at Walmart!"
AskReddit,ff25rvl,t1_feznktr,1579494588.0,"I am a big proponent of this (though I did have a coffee today, so I'm a heretic too). In my experience, when you're on caffeine, your mood and energy levels follow a sine wave. Goes to +1 for a bit but then goes down to -1 right after. When using zero caffeine, it's more of a flat line. Some mood changes, but not nearly as drastic. Plus less anxiety too.

I think everyone should at least try it for a week, just to understand themselves a bit better."
