Found this thread while searching for the same question you had. Thought it was a neat idea, but it looked like they stopped after a few episodes. They don't have the trailer listed on the duolingo site, but it is on spotify."

That's the only place we found an air conditioner as well. One of the random gift shops had air conditioning. Nowhere else in london or paris has so much as a ceiling fan. For reference it was 35-37C (95-100F) most days during our trip."

So, yes, I'd agree that a single late payment that he's given advance notice on would not be a great reason to evict assuming it's the only thing :)"
