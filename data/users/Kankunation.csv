The point being made is that the size, convenience, portability, and versatility that modern smartphones offer make them the optimal choice for most people, who have no real need for any of the features that a true desktop or laptop excel at.  You typical user only need a computer to check their emails, manage a bank account, look up the occasional item like a word's definition, game time or the weather, watch a video or two, and handle their social media. 

A optimal user or power user using a computer can do all of those items faster or more efficiently, but a phone does is all well enough, in a highly portable form factor and typically easier as phones provide more real-time feedback to the user and have all kinds of sensors and software that mitigate the difficulty of certain tasks, (GPS tracking makes directions and weather easy, facial recognition/fingerprint scanner makes logging into sensitive apps quicker, camera let's you do everything from scan QR codes to submit checks to you bank account, etc). And since a smartphone is also used for other tasks that computers aren't (workouts, messaging, calls) it makes sense for many users to only really use their cell phone for 90% of their use case. 

Not to mention that most users aren't at the level to get the most out of a PC. A power user might be able to do everything they can on their phone and more without ever taking their hands off the keyboard. But your typical user hasn't the slightest clue of how to use any commands other than Ctrl+alt+delete. Nor can they type any faster on a physical keyboard than on their phone. nor can they navigate a webpage any easier than a phone app (I'd argue the average user has an easier time navigating a phone app due to the intuitiveness of direct manipulation as opposed to mouse and keyboard, hence why children have such an easy time learning touchscreen devices). A phone is simple enough and does everything well enough for the average user to prefer it over a laptop, and thus makes it the ""best"" option for a lot of users, even if it isn't objectively speaking the best option, in terms of hardware or peripherals."

A hundred years ago, we would have Annual floods in the spring when the ice melted up north. The whole Mississippi Delta would flood, and fresh sediments would be deposited evenly along the Gulf. 

Then in the 1920's/1930s, the Army Corps of Engineers built the levees and spillways in an effort to control the flow of the river, as a response to great flood of 1927. This stopped the annual flooding that built up our wetlands, an increased the speed of the river to the point that Sediment no longer has time to deposit in the gulf (it still builds up, but far slower)

Of course. The wetlands isn't a very stable area to begin with. It's prone to sinkholes and subsidence. And the area is also prone to Hurricanes and other strong storms, which speed up the erosion process. So we just keep losing land without it being replaced."

Not the case. Most servers keep their own tips. Sometimes the restaurant might make them share some of their tips with the kitchen staff but not often. The only places I know that completely share tips are the ones like coffee shops that just have a single communal tip jar. Restaurants generally don't.

Most restaurants would never pay more than neccessary for servers. Minimum or close to it is what is expected of those types of jobs unfortunately. If they valued their workers more than that then they wouldn't already be giving them $2/hr

 > Tipping still exists but in the way that other countries do it. In the case of the people you say get 15-20$ because their are good, they would still get tips.

It's unlikely these positions would be anything but minimum wage,  and, as it is, servers can often make the equivalent of $15-$20 and hour off of their tips a big chunk of which is tax free, since they usually don't report their cash Tips even though they're supposed to)."
worldnews,fcbic38,t1_fcbf1nz,1577587219.0,"There is, at least in concept. The US has recognized Puerto Rican citizenship since at least 1900 with the Foraker act, and Puerto Rico has on several occasions reaffirmed a separate Puerto Rican citizenship (for example, Miriam J. Ramirez de Ferrer v. Juan Mari Brás, PRSC case in 1997). And they have issued Certificates of Puerto Rican citizenship to natives since 2007. So even if it's symbolic, the concept exists.

The aforementioned Supreme court case was what I was referring to with my previous comment. In that case, a Puerto Rican man rejoiced his own American citizenship, but claimed to still retain Puerto Rican citizenship. This action was approved by US officials, and the PRSC determined that he still maintained Puerto Rican citizenship as defined several times in the Puerto Rican Constitution. He thus maintained the ability to vote in PR elections (though could not vote in any federal elections)."
worldnews,fcb059r,t1_fcay9iv,1577580047.0,"They are still US citizens. Everybody born on Puerto Rico is a US citizen. This has been the case since the Jones-Shafroth act of 1917 was signed into law.

They are also Puerto Rican citizens, but not exclusively such, unless the renounce their American citizenship (which isn't unheard of). They aren't a state, but that does not exempt them from being US citizens. Anybody from Puerto Rico can move to any US state and legally register to vote with no waiting period and no citizenship tests. (Not saying they should, mind you. But they absolutely can)."

Puerto Rico **is** this country. A US territory with US citizens making up the bulk of it's population. This isn't some far off unrelated country that we shouldn't care about like Saudi Arabia or Brazil"
worldnews,fcao6hp,t1_fcan0sp,1577573179.0,"Puerto Ricans are American citizens. But they can not vote because they do not live in one of the states.If they legally moved to the states, they would then be able to vote with little hassle.

It's same same with Guam and Virgin Islands, they are all US citizens at Birth. However, this is not the case for American Samoans, as their Constitution does not include birthright citizenshi. It is fairly easy for them to apply for citizenship if they wish to, however."

That's some BS that Hannity and the like love to say to rile up their viewers but the left does not hold that view. Pay attention to them and you would realize that. ""Open borders"" is pretty much just fear mongering.

2.  As usual, you guys seem to have no concept of nuance. The extremes of the current administration are far worse than anything done under the last few. Conditions were better. Children weren't being separated from their families or ""disappearing"" from camps. Immigrants had better legal protections and legal teams assigned to represent immigrants were better and larger. Trump has actively made the situation on the border worse, and there is no denying that. Obama and especially Clinton weren't perfect, but they were nowhere near as vile or malicious as Trump is in regards to border control."

[Article with the quote](https://mspoweruser.com/phil-spencer-says-single-player-games-like-horizon-zero-dawn-dont-impact/). TL:DR is that Single-player games come with a lot more risk involved and they have to have a financially sound reason to develop them. Not just Microsoft, but all studios.

That was in 2017 though. More recently, he  said that that we are going to get [plenty more single player games in the future.](https://www.techradar.com/news/phil-spencer-confirms-that-single-player-games-will-continue-to-launch-on-xbox).
