The controller was simply a dial with a compass on it, and people would mark the positions with a sharpie or tape, turn the dial and the antenna turned, also.

I never saw my grandparents (born about 1900) struggle with any piece of technology to even 1/10th the degree my parents (born about 1940) struggle with phones or computers today.
