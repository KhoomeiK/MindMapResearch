trippinthroughtime,fffegts,t1_ffeqiwt,1579882183.0,"> Something like the flu

Friend I got bad news for you, it’s not possible to work with influenza. The flu will make you want to die if doesn’t actually kill you. People often mistake “stomach flu” (which isn’t a thing) or a particularly nasty upper respiratory infection for influenza and that really screws over the unfortunate folks who are truly influenza positive. 

Anyone who even tries to come in to work with the flu is an asshole. If I notice my coworker is ill and they are refusing to go home- I will Karen my ass straight to HR and tell them what’s going on. I refuse to get sick from the negligence of a fellow employee."

worldnews,ffd92u9,t1_ffd8nsa,1579815815.0,"You’re absolutely right. 
 Which, in a way, supports my urge for the education in those communities. However trickle down it might be."
worldnews,ffd7nxx,t3_essj4i,1579815012.0,"Listen; I’m not saying China is perfect, nor any country for that matter. But we owe it to ourselves as an online community to responsibly share news and opinions. A lot of the comments I’m reading here are extremely xenophobic and racist. 

I’m that asshole friend of yours who’s a crazy animal lover. I donate to many animal organizations. I’m vehemently     against animal trial testing in pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and chemicals. The person you introduce to your other friends as “ugh, yeah- maybe not say that about rabbits and mice around her.” But I will never, EVER demonize an entire race, nationality, or ethnicity based on their cultural practices. 

What we need to be doing instead is recognizing that a *massive* developing country in the 21st century is going to have cultural practices that will simply take longer to evolve. These are often less heritage-based.

Here’s a great example- there is a habit among Chinese mainlanders relieving their infants in public places and often not cleaning up the results. We see less instances of this happening now- but not because we shamed them or made it taboo, it was when education about health and sanitation became more prevalent among the rural communities. 

While it sounds like these residents aren’t eating actual koala meat, and instead is a viral translation failure, what if they were? There’s obviously a *reason* why they do, and my guess is that it’s viewed as a health food/medicine. If more folks used their phones to document the bogus claims of these meats and took the time to educate them, we would be able to accelerate their development as a first world nation. That’s a win for everybody, and the animals, too. 

Thank you for coming to my TED talk. And yes I’m *a blast* at parties."

trees,fecvxr4,t1_fecvbes,1578986753.0,"Per the Mayo Clinic:


An allergy starts when your immune system mistakes a normally harmless substance for a dangerous invader. The immune system then produces antibodies that remain on the alert for that particular allergen. When you're exposed to the allergen again, these antibodies can release a number of immune system chemicals, such as histamine, that cause allergy symptoms.

[Allergies according to the Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/allergies/symptoms-causes/syc-20351497)"

This thread is full of people in denial and tons of ignorance.  Don’t get me wrong- I’m glad they are happy and healthy babies and families out there that were born under some crazy conditions, and I’m happy they are all happy. 

An educated woman who sees her GYN annually does not go 6 months without knowing she’s pregnant. She just doesn’t. 

Being told you can’t conceive but your periods CHANGED? An educated woman still goes to her GYN because she’s responsible for her own health and a self advocate. 

So many of these “surprise stories” are major red flags for going to see your doctor. I haven’t seen one story in this whole thread that didn’t make me ask “why the hell didn’t you see your GYN? There’s legit only two reasons- denial and ignorance. Possibly income too, depending on location. Which is just sad I’m so many ways. 

I advocate for other women and my heart goes out to the very few cases where suppression of sex education plays a major role in this, but from one woman to the other- come *on* ladies."
facepalm,fds2vr8,t1_fdqknj7,1578693555.0,This is true- but you would very likely be informed of this during your first GYN exam.
