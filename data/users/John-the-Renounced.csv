DIY,ffhwvn0,t1_ffhwo7s,1579957479.0,"Not caulk, it's not strong enough. Resin, yes, but use a short length of threaded bar and secure with a washer and nut. Getting resin to stay in the hole is the trick, and you need to stabilise the rods while the resin goes off. Resin bolting is good and secure but, as I suggested, last ditch as it's a royal pita.

Tbh, expanding bolts are going to be easiest, quick, and very secure (much more so than the plastic plugs which have come out)."
DIY,ffhw4nv,t1_ffhvuib,1579956592.0,"Yup. You may need to drill out the hole a little if it's not regular. If you have drill bits you can 'reverse' them and try them in the existing hole until you find the diameter that fits, and then buy the plug that fits."

Damnthatsinteresting,ffe2xdi,t3_eb9kp3,1579835309.0,"The why is the bending moment on the keel is significantly less on a transverse launch than a longitudinal one, where she slips in astern off the blocks. In a longitudinal launch there's a buttock clenching moment where the ship
starts floating and is supported on the fore poppet - maximum stress on the hull and minimum stability. 

In the ideal world they're all go in this way but the reality is that most traditional shipyards aren't laid out to enable it, so it's still the exception rather than the norm."

CelticPaganism,edp3zw7,t3_a73kzx,1547107113.0,"Personally I'd identify as pagan atheist - I don't believe in any god/s, but recognise the divine in nature. My paganism is rooted in the wheel, and in observing and celebrating what's going on in the countryside surrounding my home. I'm new to considering myself pagan, having been an atheist since I was about 7.

I read on one site that arriving at paganism is a personal journey, it only took me 40 years to arrive. My partner and I intend to ditch all the church assimilated festivals for their pagan roots, and are very much looking forward to celebrating Imbolc, Beltane, and Solstice (and the others).

Read widely, follow your own thoughts, and allow your own beliefs to grow, mature, and change. One thing I do agree is that there is no 'proscribed' paganism - it is between you and the world."
