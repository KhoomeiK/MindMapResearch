Copyright restricts who can distribute media, DRM restricts how legit users can use it, this means that DRM can remove some freedoms that law gives you with regards to the media you paid for.

DRM allows much more control than copyright law gives you, and copyright law allows you to force people to use DRM. (In the US,  in other parts of the world breaking DRM for media you paid is fine)."
