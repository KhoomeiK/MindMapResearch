I don't buy the stalker argument, the hit was far too professional.

In broad daylight and no witnesses.

A stalker would have made mistakes and left evidence.

Furthermore, the kill was too clean. A stalker would have shot more than once out of anger/spite.

Look how Chapman killed Lennon

>Chapman fired five hollow-point bullets from a .38 special revolver, four of which hit Lennon in the back.

Dando's murder was far too clean & clinical for a stalker.

>As Dando was about to put her keys in the lock to open the front door of her home in Fulham, she was grabbed from behind. With his right arm, the assailant held her and forced her to the ground, so that her face was almost touching the tiled step of the porch. Then, with his left hand, he fired a single shot at her left temple, killing her instantly. The bullet entered her head just above her ear, parallel to the ground, and came out the right side of her head.

AskReddit,ffesbav,t1_ffdbpch,1579863144.0,"> There isn't much I can say, but my grandmother says it was overall a tougher time to live, however it felt more secure than now, and much more secure than right after the fall, the ninetees in Russia were a mess and a half, where there basically was no functioning government or police.


This is a common response I get from Russians I speak to.

People may have felt more secure, but in reality, they weren't.

The security was an illusion. You were simply on the road to what happened in the 90's, but just didn't know it."

Shockingly intelligent (which I love) and as cute as a button.

The kind of girl I completely fall head over heels for.

But goddamn, was she boring.

I mean, I'm not the world's greatest conversationalists by any stretch of the imagination, but I'm very good at making new friends whereever I go and never struggle to engage in small talk.

But Jesus, it was like talking to a brick wall.

The key is, she wasn't rude or ignoring me, it's just that there was nothing there.

She later married and I remember thinking '*How ?*'."
