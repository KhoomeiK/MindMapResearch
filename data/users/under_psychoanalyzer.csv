For president, Literally anyone other than Trump. It's so weird that all these ""religious liberty"" rules his administration are actually about giving Christians the ""freedom"" to discriminate on the job. I would hope it's glaringly obvious the difference in the parties, but it's not apparently. I have stereotype libertarian yet trump hating friends on Facebook that is a nice little case study into the mind of independents. He latched on to some out of context story about Pete Buttigieg appointing a faith adviser and how that immediately discredited him as a candidate for president because he's tired of people trying to put religion in government. Ignoring that A) All candidates do that B) he was doing that to make sure minority religions were represented and listened too and C) unfortunately a lot of people vote for whoever their pastor tells them too. He just latched on to it and wouldn't let go. The truth is some people are just looking for excuses to hate candidates and there's not really a way to send someone back to k-12 to relearn logic."

I'm not being aggressive. I'm calling out your lies and misleading statements. Stop spreading lies and I'll stop calling you out on it. You're pulling random numbers out of thin air. That 37% you tried to mention didn't exist. 

> Over the same period, there has been growth in the shares of Democrats and Democratic leaners identifying as liberal. Among Democratic-leaning independents, slightly more identify as moderates (45%) than as liberals (39%), while 14% are conservatives. But the gap has narrowed since 2000, when moderates outnumbered liberals, 50% to 30%."" 

Right. Most are moderates. 14% of conservatives, but still Democratic-leaning. That means 59% of the 17% of the total US population that are democratic leaning independents are more to the right of Bernie than not. The number gets bigger when you throw in the 13% of Republican-leaning independents and it's completely accurate to say most independents are moderates.

The title of the Washpo  ""[Most independents are just moderate partisans""](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/03/14/most-independents-are-just-moderate-partisans/). It's right there.

If everyone in the US voted and was fairly represented we wouldn't have to actually make an effort to make people vote blue, we'd just win, eventually, most places trend blue. Which is why the GOP wants to prevent common sense voting reform. But HR 1 submitted to the house in 2019

If we get rid of First Past the Post voting with something more appropriate like Approval Voting or Ranked voting I believe the party system will take care of itself. It's not a 1 to 1 comparison to atheism. These people are still partisans. It's like people quit the Catholic Church because of pedophilia but ML never created protestants so they don't have anywhere to go, but they're still Christians so they're sure as hell not going to become Muslims.

nonprofit,ffctpiz,t1_ffcird6,1579807060.0,"Overhead is whatever people agree to. It's meant to cover misc. expenses that support a particular project that you don't want to breakdown like office rent, office supplies, etc. If you the project takes 10% of the organizations time/effort then overhead should be whatever 10% of all those common use items in the office that indirectly benefit the project. Ideally, you actually break these things down and come up with a number. That's why sometimes overhead costs look ridiculous but if the org is paying for a penthouse office in a major city rent ain't cheap.

Right. It also doesn't mean they'll have a harder time getting elected. What point are you arguing? You just flipped from trying to say being a woman makes it harder to get elected to be a woman doesn't mean you get automatic votes?"

Just like there weren't any serious African American candidates before Obama. It's a dumb talking point and not actually based in reality. Half the fucking country is female.

Hillary *won the popular vote*. It's so fucking dumb to say 2016 proves women have a harder time being elected president. 2016 was a shit show for other reasons. Gender was a small, tiny part of why she was a difficult candidate."

Going to need to see some data on how that's true or relevant.

Complaining that the Democratic party is using too much identity politics and then telling someone they can't win because of what makes up their identity is mind-bogglingly hypocritical. Misogyny doesn't mean someone hates women. It just means they treat them as less. There's no concrete reason to believe a woman can't win the presidency any more the Obama could have and it's really weird you don't see that."

Take your personal trauma out of it. I was just pushing back against the idea that there's a difference between raping kids in the park and banging a 16 year old who in a short while will be able to have sex with whoever and still be just as physically mature as they are now.

southcarolina,fefbi94,t1_fefabun,1579052676.0,If the student was one year older the teacher could get fired but not actually go to jail. Treating high schoolers as asexual children is part of why SC's teen pregnancy rates are so bad. It's an abuse of power but she didn't put a fucking lollipop under a box and rape them.
southcarolina,fefaond,t1_fef09px,1579052136.0,"If she was 3 years younger or they were 1 year older it wouldn't legally be rape. The charges literally list it as a consensual relationship. It's not a huge age difference. It's an abuse of power, she took advantage of them, and she should be fired but it's dumb to call someone a child molester for banging a 16-year old that might not look any different from someone 21. Treating 16-year-olds like asexual children is why teen pregnancy is so bad and why teenagers get taken advantage of in the first place. No one wants to sit them down and treat them like they're actually at their sexual maturity so they can actually make informed relationship decisions, because we've drawn an arbitrary line to say sex before your 18 is bad."
southcarolina,fef9xcf,t1_fef01uw,1579051634.0,"Right, I'm not arguing any of that. I didn't say anything about any of that. She should be fired. It's a gross, and a gross abuse of power.

But calling someone a child molester for banging a 16-year-old is a bit much because, physically, you can't tell the difference between someone from about the time their 16 to till they're 20 something."
southcarolina,fef9m58,t1_fef21wo,1579051429.0,"Exactly. I would never knowingly try to flirt with someone under 21, in a position of power or not. It's gross. There's a huge emotional difference. The teacher was in a position of power they abused. But I try to push back that calling someone a child molester because the banged someone who is at their physical maturity for not being a child molester and it sets people off."
southcarolina,fef90a0,t1_fef57n4,1579051023.0,Yea. She's barely out of college and fucked someone about to go to college. She's not a child molester. It's an abuse of power and she should be fired but this isn't like someone abducting 9 year olds off the street.
southcarolina,feeu370,t1_feepok8,1579041231.0,Easy with the white horse there. It's an inappropriate teacher-student relationship but treating 18 like a magic line that makes people adults is dumb. I guarantee you could make line up of people between 16-21 and you could tell me whose over the line just by looking at them. She's 23. People acting like teenagers engaging in sexual behavior is the same thing as someone molesting a 9 year old is why you have high school students going to jail for sending pictures of themselves to other high schoolers.
