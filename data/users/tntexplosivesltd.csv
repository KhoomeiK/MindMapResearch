Ubiquiti,ff53sbp,t3_erlv7c,1579579437.0,"It looks like you could get away with only having the 24-port switch, no USWs, with a dedicated link from the switch to each camera/AP. If you're running two cables to the attic, might as well run 8. Easier to diagnose if there's a fault, fewer devices in the attic to have to replace if they crap out (especially if the attic is annoying to get to)

Even if you need to upgrade to the 48-port PoE switch, the equipment you eliminate (2x USW Flex, 1x US-8) probably cost more than the difference between the 24-port and 48-port PoE switch, and you have a bunch of ports to spare if you ever need to expand the network"

Ubiquiti,fekvpi0,t1_fekjbu3,1579208575.0,"They work perfectly fine for PoE+, they're only really short and PoE+ is pretty low current. It also uses two pairs to share the load. They also aren't that flimsy.

I probably wouldn't trust them for anything more however. Still, why not test them out and see what they can actually do?

Also, where I am the shortest regular cat6 patch cable you can easily get is 30cm (1') meaning more often than not the rack door won't close if you have a patch panel directly above the switch. These slimline cables will squash down easier, and go down to 25cm long."

Ubiquiti,fefc9ii,t1_fef78xs,1579053179.0,IMO patch panels should never be wired together in the same rack. It just causes confusion. If you need to wire two devices together just use a patch cable with good cable management.

Too late to change it all now, the cabling has gone in.

The whole office space is in an old warehouse, but the desks are just in the middle of the floor. The office manager wanted to avoid having cable drops from the ceiling, so they had to run the cables kind of specifically, and the warehouse hasn't been lined or anything, so the cables are just coming down the one main beam, or along one concrete wall. We already have the server room at one end, so the problem wasn't how remote the area was. They just wanted to do less cabling, so 1-2 links per desk group was deemed to be the most cost effective."
