bulletjournal,ff5pqg8,t1_ff5p7hk,1579605096.0,"Thank you. Get ready for quite a long explanation :D

I know that I wanted to do something for Valentine's day/month but I didn't want it to be the typical hearts, chocolates and flowers. 

Enter the anatomical heart! And because I'm weird, I put it in a jar with a liquid buffer (usually formaldehyde but I didn't want a *preserved* heart - just one suspended in a medium). Kind of how people shield their hearts from the world because they're afraid of the repercussions.

Now, I'd have love to have gone horror movie plant and have a rose bush grow out of the actual heart but it seemed a wee bit over the top. I went with  peony seeds. They represent the people who come into your life. The one growing on the jar is the person or people who stick around and work hard enough to crack that shell you've built up and expose you to new emotions and experiences. 

(Also, I really like plants and they are a direct connection to my heart) 

I think that's about it. Yup."

bulletjournal,ff5jd4l,t3_erdtjk,1579595608.0,Yup!! My current setup is like an oversized monthly that I use to note down tasks. It's extremely efficient for the times I don't feel like drawing every week for hours but then I don't technically have a spread to decorate each week either. I have to wait for each month's cover page and overview to get my decorating in. So I'm always excited when the month ends :)

I used Faber Castell Pitt artist brush pens for the calligraphy and some of the line work (they're waterproof).

But it was never recommended for what the bujo has involved into. I had the same problem with my Leuchtturm and made the switch to Archer and Olive this year. 

The easiest way to stop the bleeding is to use colour pencils or to draw your pictures on another piece of paper and glue them in later. 

You can also use a thin layer of gesso and iron the page flat if you *really* want to paint on it. 

The above option is not recommended if you use Frixion pens to write lol"

I know the official ones are on the small side but Etsy has some that are b5 sized which could help with the page count. That way, you can have separate notebooks inside the cover for your lists, activities and different types of writing. It also makes swapping them out easier because the core remains the same."

As someone who draws in their bujo, I feel like noone is 100% happy with what they do, especially after comparing it to the incredible work you find here.
