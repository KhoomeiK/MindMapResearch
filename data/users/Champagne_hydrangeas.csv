AskReddit,fgkemno,t3_eyus0a,1580863765.0,"The good ol ""rude to  servers"" is a no-no for me. It's unnecessary and awful, and makes me wonder what else they have up their sleeve. I've never met someone who was polite to their servers but horrible to me.

A step down from that is not asking me any questions about myself. I get some people are shy, but there's a difference between awkward pauses and then waiting for me to carry the whole conversation, which they then make about themselves.

Not a dealbreaker, but I look askance at guys who don't offer to walk me to my car at night when I'm parked in public (and then I offer to drive them to theirs)."

KUWTK,ffto1n9,t3_eubiy2,1580225354.0,"I can't think of one specifically, but I generally loved Kourtney and Khloé take Miami, especially the first season. They just had so much fun, and in fact inspired my bff and me to take a spontaneous trip there when airfares were low. Those two were famous but not *quite* famous enough to where they were unrelatable, IMO."
