I'm not saying cocktails in Glasgow suck, just that in my experience there's nothing hugely special here, especially to someone coming from the US, which I've always assumed was at least in part due to tipping culture

my point on licensing is referring to fixed measures

and the 'dive bar' thing is a classification distinction, I would have called most of those rock bars, and in my experience what someone visiting means is 'pubs'."
glasgow,fguihdy,t3_f0ic4n,1581121635.0,"For whisky, there are two key pubs really: The Pot Still and the Bon Accord. 

Cocktails, historically, have never been as much of a 'thing' here as they are in the US, and the weird licensing laws make them a bit tricky, so you probably won't find the quality here really compares very well to the US. You'll get a perfectly *adequate* cocktail, but nothing that's going to be memorable. Having said that, it's worth dropping into Rogano, an original Art Deco restaurant/bar which will otherwise tick all the instagram boxes and does all the classic cocktails of that era.

Similarly, we don't really have the concept of 'dive bars' - we have pubs, and these are the singular thing you can experience in the UK that don't really exist anywhere else other than Ireland and Belgium. Sample the great real ale and craft beer scene. Pubs like the State Bar, Tennent's, Bon Accord (and many others) will give you a real taste of Glasgow. In Merchant City, avoid the generic bars and head for Blackfriars or Babbity Bowster.

glasgow,ffm7kci,t1_ffltnui,1580049814.0,"A long, long way from a Tory - my point is that privatisation can work with sufficient, well-designed regulation. The Tories' neo-liberal approach doesn't include the latter, so I would generally look outside the UK, such as to the Scandinavian countries and Germany, for successful well-regulated industries. They manage to be social democracies utilising private financing.

Looking at the UK's basket cases (each of which is a substantial argument of its own) and saying that nationalisation is the answer is to avoid the actual issues in each case which don't disappear when you change the financing model. In many cases the major problems which plagued the early privatised systems in the 90s have now been fixed, and to enact transformational change back would risk it happening all over again.

Really we're agreeing - we've been absolutely shite at privatisation in the UK because we're so bad at regulating and sacrificing to the neo-liberal altar. My point is that the failure of privatisation in the UK should not be taken as a de facto case for nationalised industries, because we were shit at those too - and there is a whole spectrum of regulatory principles which mean at heart the difference need only be about financing if we want it to be.

But as it stands I have as little faith in our (real or potential) government's ability to successfully establish well-run state companies as I do in them to successfully establish good regulators, because to my mind the principles required to do so are pretty much identical, and both main parties love ill-advised top-down non-technocractic interventions too much for either way to work."

Transport policy is devolved to the Scottish Government, not to the councils. Councils have to operate within the national system, so to change that it has to happen at a national level, and be done in a manner that treats all operators fairly (i.e. you can't do something to First Glasgow alone, you have to do it to McGills etc too) otherwise those companies can sue the government for lost revenue (on the basis they've invested under the assumption of future revenue).

Again, there are proposals going through Holyrood at the moment to make it easier for councils to create their own local services, but these will still exist alongside private operators"
glasgow,ffg7a9x,t1_ffg1wht,1579899989.0,"As a point of opinion, I think people get too bogged down in private vs public and the nationalisation debate. Privatised services can be run very successfully with the right regulation, and nationalised services often have perverse incentives that lead to inefficient management.

The reason we privatised so much stuff in the 80s/90s - under both Tories and Labour - was because by that point most public services were bloated, inefficient and expensive. I do feel that the upsurge in support for renationalisation is only amongst those not old enough to remember how bad the previous public companies were. There's nostalgia for the Corporation Buses of the 1950s, but you won't find many people saying, ""I wish it was like how it was in the 70/80s.""

Changing the source of funding and the regulation model doesn't inherently make any difference to the quality of the service. While there is a good template in what Lothian Buses has achieved, we could just as equally have a well-funded and efficient privately-operated bus service if we just regulated e.g. First Glasgow a bit better."
glasgow,fffqfp1,t1_fffggq4,1579889561.0,"It's not a franchising system like the railways, they're a licensed private bus operator, i.e. they make money from running buses wherever they think demand is sufficient. They do have some contracts with the council to run subsidised (i.e. loss-making) routes, but basically they're as free to run whatever buses they want for however long they want to do so (subject to meeting the conditions of the licence). This is why we have multiple companies, there's no inherent monopoly over services for the council to take over. There's no good reason for there to be one, unlike the railways which are physically constrained by the need to run on specific railway lines.

If the council started their own company they would be running in direct competition with First and would so likely have to run at a massive loss, or only run the subsidised routes, again at greater cost due to economy of scale - so it would be a bad use of public money.

So the potential sale of First Glasgow would have allowed the council to establish a company that would be economically viable by having reduced upfront costs and competition - it would be taking over an already-profitable business. If that's not on the table, then the council can't realistically enter the market at any scale.

The only way this changes is if the Scottish Government makes radical changes to the private bus operation model. While there have indeed been such changes proposed over the past couple of years, with significant support in Holyrood, remember that despite somehow painting themselves as social democrats, the SNP are very much centrist and pro-private business and are in favour of the private operator model."

In the case of Millport, there did indeed used to be several passenger services into the the village itself, which went bust after the main service was started in 1972 to the upgraded 'tattie pier' in the north of the island.

If you look at the geography, it's clear that a ferry going Largs-Cumbrae Slip can do 3 or 4 times as many crossings per day than one doing Hunterston - Millport. The bus service on the island might be insufficient, but it would be way cheaper to run a second bus than to have a massive ferry running all the way round the coast and tripling the ticket price.

there is no duration. You just have to give 28 days' notice to leave. So technically you could move in having paid your first months' rent, hand in notice that day, and leave 28 days later without any penalties.

As above, because this is a fairly new change, you may still find many landlords trying to get you to sign a 'short assured tenancy' of 6 or 12 months. These are no longer valid."

Renting in Scotland is very different to England, tenants have far more rights. e.g.: Pretty much all agency fees are illegal other than a holding deposit which must be offset against rent. There is also no longer any 'duration' of a lease, they are on a month-by-month basis. All deposits must be placed in a recognised deposit scheme.

Know your rights, because despite all of the above there are still plenty of shitty agencies who will try and pull a fast one, as well as private landlords who feign ignorance. Note that there are also plenty of scam listings on major websites.

The punctuality can be a bit poor, and it's all a bit dirty, so people moan about it a lot, but in total it's pretty good and you can live here and get about quite happily without a car (as the majority do).

The buses can be a bit expensive and shit (mostly because of the companies that run them) but again it's a step change from what I saw passing for a bus service in most US cities. Because all the different services are run by different companies (rather than the municipality running it) the different services are not well integrated, which is a downside compared to other european cities."
