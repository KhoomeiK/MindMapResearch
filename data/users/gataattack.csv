EDAnonymous,fep1dsj,t3_epw8g9,1579309963.0,"Hi OP, I don’t know if you know this but there is a type of eating disorder/OCD that revolves around avoiding certain types of food to an unhealthy degree. I don’t want to armchair diagnose but you might want to look into it and see if it feels right to you. The acronym is ARFID but you can look up food avoidant disorder as well. It doesn’t sound like this is regular “pickiness”. Stay safe and good luck I hope you find some answers."
fatlogic,fejidt5,t3_ep81sg,1579175590.0,They’re right binging on chocolate and chips is totally a normal and healthy reaction of my body. It’s also really weird how they constantly disconnect themselves from their bodies.
fatlogic,fejf583,t1_fejbq1s,1579171166.0,"She could have atypical anorexia which doesn’t require being underweight to diagnose. She could also be bulimic by binging then purging with restricted eating. You  could potentially be very disordered  without losing weight then eg eating 4000 cals in one day but then only eating 1000 for the next four as a rough example. Obviously those numbers might be too high I just wanted the easy maths example. She could also be extremely restrictive in the types of foods she eats. Eating a regular amount of calories but from only three items of food. That has a name but I can’t remember it. 

Honestly though what makes me doubt her is that someone with a restrictive disorder would probably love love to lose weight inpatient. Desire for weight loss drives EDs I can’t reconcile someone who has an ED but doesn’t want to lose weight unless they are recovered enough to probably not be in therapy."
fatlogic,fej42gz,t3_ep4l2t,1579156119.0,This only works in a junk food free world. Our system isn’t built to cope with massive amount of infinite sugar dat and carbs
Cringetopia,fej3t6y,t1_fej3mdt,1579155846.0,In this context probably just smoking weed in a small space so the smoke fills the room/wherever else you happen to do it.
EDanonymemes,fegfbfo,t1_fegawc5,1579090824.0,Oh yeah I remember that. I was a lurker myself.
EDanonymemes,fegau4v,t1_fefym3d,1579085411.0,FPH?
fatlogic,feg9bcz,t1_fefnkol,1579083264.0,It sounds like she can barely breathe. In fairness it could be nerves and I hope it is because otherwise...damn.
Instagramreality,fef8e3g,t1_fedvs47,1579050613.0,I think her face looks way better
TumblrInAction,fecm2g2,t3_eo5xyx,1578977270.0,That really is nothing like what the Joker is about. Really it is probably the most lefty movie nominated with the possible exception of parasite.
BlackPeopleTwitter,feciv8i,t3_eodqgu,1578974987.0,I worked in a two customer service jobs. Both places told me directly to never attempt to stop someone stealing for the same reason.
fatlogic,fe27lcw,t3_en9y8m,1578835338.0,The person said average meaning neither fat nor skinny. Not average as in the most common. Her entire argument is based on the wrong interpretation of her word.

intermittentfasting,fdouwce,t3_emgnni,1578613422.0,Such a lovely figure.
exchristian,fdm8xkh,t1_fdm5nai,1578542744.0,So no scripture/theology thing? That seems bizarre. It’s all the same religion really. I guess people always want an out group.
Cringetopia,fdl6b8v,t1_fdl59mw,1578517782.0,Draco frequently refers to Ron as “weasel” because of his name. Draco is the ferret since he once got turned into one by a teacher. Hermione has been called a beaver because she used to have prominent front teeth and she once was hexed to have them grow incredibly fast. I think Draco was the one who called her Beaver.
exchristian,fdl5l2w,t1_fdk0bwz,1578517432.0,Also they don’t like Catholics? Why is that?
exchristian,fdjst2i,t1_fdj8jci,1578486231.0,Wooow that is a level of religious saturation I didn’t even know existed outside of extremists and cults.

TumblrInAction,fdfjqsw,t1_fdej31v,1578363327.0,May I ask what sleep disorder you had? I’ve been having similar issues for years.
progresspics,fdctwqs,t3_ekjwpd,1578284196.0,You have almost the same before stats as me! Hopefully I’ll be you in a years time.
menwritingwomen,fd6oqj9,t1_fcyu8qw,1578193893.0,It was not. The book kind of falls into a so bad it is good thing. It’s basically the main character constantly congratulating himself for being the most “nerdy” thing ever just listing references. It is pure trash and dumb as rocks.
fatlogic,fd1ro1s,t1_fcwv1f2,1578135737.0,I’m from Australia and we have an obesity epidemic here as well so it can’t be that.
fatlogic,fcwujf8,t3_ej6o9x,1578038195.0,It is odd to me that being weighed at the doctors seems to be standard practice in America. Granted I don’t go to the doctor much but I’ve only ever been weighed once and that was because I was getting surgery.
badwomensanatomy,fcwueng,t3_eiz84p,1578038038.0,I don’t know if I have ever read some comments that have made me so angry.
exchristian,fcu9112,t1_fct7wl5,1577975432.0,I wonder if that comes from our instinctual fear or nighttime. We belong in daylight and are uncomfortable in the dark.
dankchristianmemes,fc44tbn,t1_fc3msrv,1577406650.0,Why does God feel the need to test people?
