TooAfraidToAsk,fd6pg44,t3_ejrgje,1578194127.0,i think its normal. i do this to stories with so much flowery words. i end up pausing and looking up the words in the dictionary when i don't understand them so i can internalize its meaning

offmychest,fcwnmlx,t1_fcwmk86,1578030829.0,"yes i have talked to my grandma but because she lives with my aunt, she respects her and doesn't want to get involved. everyone in our family don't want to mess with each other and i guess it adds that i'm in a Filipino household? i'm just waiting for her to book me a ticket so that I can go home to my parents. i can't stand how she's treating me here like im boarding at her house and telling me i'm lazy and i should get a job even though im still a student. :( sorry i think i have said too much. i hope i'm not wasting your time."
offmychest,fcva1w9,t1_fcu9r42,1577997775.0,thank you for your kind words. she really cares for me but i hate how sarcastic she is at times which i don't find funny. she also sometimes forces me to socialize or go out which worsens my anxiety and i can't refuse because she'll get mad/upset about it. its sad that i look up to her when i was a kid but now i don't know anymore.

ForeverAlone,fcjxnva,t3_e71h2w,1577709555.0,"this is me. when i was around that age i was talkative and full of energy. people would constantly praise me for being smart or befriend me because im approachable. and now that im 19 nearing 20, so many things have changed. i have become socially awkward, shy, depressed and has body dysmorphia. people around me would question what happened to me or look at me like im the most horrible person they've seen"
