AskReddit,feim9wx,t3_epcjh5,1579141844.0,"Would end between PA and TX. With the final states being the dakotas, Montana, and Idaho. California doesnt have much (assuming all the military assets would fight for their home state) other than money (us currency would probably be nullified at this point) and land. PA would take the NE states, DE, and MD with little effort. WV could be an issue with guerilla warfare tactics and terrain. 

TX has to contend with all bordering states that have a very high percentage of gun ownership and military members making it difficult for them to expand. 

AK/HI would be the last to fall."

1. Shes learned that she could get better food if she ignores her dry food. 
 -leave her food out all day, avoid treats and scraps for a few days, she will eat when shes hungry.
