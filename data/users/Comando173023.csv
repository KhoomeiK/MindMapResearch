So this for example would be considered a rifle or a pistol, I'm only 20 so no pistols yet. And what you said confused me about the grip and stock, did you mean that taking them off would consider them an AOW. And from what I read an aow would be a gun with the least amount of parts to make it concealable, no stock, no grip, short barrel etc. Thanks for any help for someone new to the big world of guns."

The way the witcher let's the musician follow him, no real badass like that would ever allow him to follow him like that, he was also making a ton of noise and making fun of him for trying to be stealthy when checking out the guys land.
