todayilearned,ff6yf17,t1_ff6m3pa,1579637452.0,"There is an awesome experiment with mice detailing this exact situation. To summarize, they get 2 groups of mice addicted to coke. One group they keep in isolation and subpar living conditions, the other one they re-introduce it back into its family and friends. They give both the option to drink regular water or Coke (TM) water. The slum rat stays addicted, the rat with a support group chooses regular water."
todayilearned,ff6y80o,t1_ff6t9i0,1579637336.0,"You're wrong because you are saying that only things that are physically addictive are real addictions. You can become mentally addicted to something just as easy, and people become agitated and short tempered when that is taken away from them - ie- video games, phones, working out, church, running, etc.

PS-Caffeine addiction most definitely does cause physical symptoms of withdrawal btw"
AskReddit,ff61mhz,t3_ero8mj,1579616828.0,"I'd be sad I didn't end up as a fighter pilot or senator, but I ended up with a hot wife, which was pretty much my motivation to go into those jobs (Don't judge me, I was 13!) Would be very happy that I found a job that suits my personality and makes me more money then all my pretentious ass classmates. Would be astounded at how popular I've gotten in my older age, and how people actually notice I exist now! I would also be jealous of how I can buy any video game or console I want at a whim, and get to play them when I feel like it. But most of all, I would be so happy to see that I am right in the joyous throws of raising 2 awesome ass kids who will be just like 13 year old me in no time."

TwoXChromosomes,fedleh5,t1_fedkk82,1579014410.0,"Well he's going to throw fits, just like your own kids would if suddenly they went from having no rules to rules. It may be a little tough since so long has passed since he first came to live with y'all, but it's worth a shot. Worst case - He goes home in 4 months thinking that he didn't enjoy his time with y'all and doesn't want to keep in contact (Which sounds like is going to be the case if things stay the same as they are now anyways). I'd recommend starting small and working up from there, but just make sure they are consistent with the rules you give your own kids too. Maybe start with no electronics during dinner time, then move up to no electronics for dinner and the hour before/after dinner while everyone in the family plays a board game together, or even let them play a video game as long as it's something they can all play together.

Our rule is no electronics while the sun is up, which would be easier to implement now since the sun goes down pretty soon after school, but as the days get longer that time increases without him really noticing it. I have also heard of parents changing the WiFi password daily/weekly and kids having to do chores or things to earn the password back. He's going to throw a pissy fit about change, no doubt, and his brain won't be adjusted to not being constantly stimulated, but he will figure it out eventually...and be the better for it in the long run. Hell, maybe one day 5 years down the road you will get a call from him thanking you for the change. I know sure as hell I can't thank my parents enough for things they did that made me hate them at the time.

EDIT- And I'm not sure the exact details of how the program works, but do you have any communication with his family so you could gameplan with them about restricting access to electronics that are technically his. My parents always let a lot of friends live in my house like it was their own when they needed to, but it was always under the condition of ""When you're under my roof, you will follow my rules if you want to live here"""
TwoXChromosomes,fedk236,t1_fedjsub,1579013492.0,"To help improve the situation for you and other women around you. Why is it our responsibility to ensure a cleaner earth for future generations? Why is it our responsibility to point out other social injustices when we see them? Why is anything our responsibility? Because by nature we are social creatures, so helping each other improve helps us all benefit.

EDIT- Also it's not just women's responsibility. It is mens responsibility to call out other men for toxic behavior. It's no one sexes responsibility, it's all our responsibility. However, women are the ones who are directly impacted by it and see it on a first hand basis, so it's easy for us to ignore it or pretend like it doesn't exist until it is thrown in our face that it is a very real thing. Just like I could tell you about all kind of men specific problems we encounter that women don't know about until it is pointed out because it's not something you experience on a daily basis."
TwoXChromosomes,fedjaxq,t1_fedh6nz,1579012963.0,"Maybe try taking him to a Comic-con/video game convention or something like that? It is how a lot of socially inept ""nerds"" get social interaction with people they can feel more comfortable with.

Also, have you tried setting screen time rules? It's very easy to get sucked into the digital world and get addicted to it. Video game addiction is very real. My wife has to set my ass straight occasionally, and now with kids it's something I can pull myself away from easier because I don't want them to see me with my face buried in a screen all the time. It will suck for the first couple weeks, but you may be doing him and yourself a huge favor in the long run."
TwoXChromosomes,fedim7l,t1_fedd190,1579012475.0,"Agreed with the last part. If you just let someone talk over you, it makes you feel foolish and awkward, but if you straight up interrupt them with that line, they can't continue talking without looking like a complete asshole in front of everyone else."
TwoXChromosomes,fedibsn,t1_feddbze,1579012263.0,"As dudes, the majority of us are immature assholes until a few important women thankfully come along in our lives and smarten us up. Most of us aren't misogynistic assholes by choice, its just most behavior that we get excused from because ""boys are just being boys"" causes us to be surrounded by a friends group that is an echo chamber of male toxicity, so it changes our viewpoint. Thankfully most of us are actually empathetic human beings, and when we have someone seriously point out that the shit we say or the jokes we make aren't funny outside of our 13 year old brains, we realize we don't want to hurt people and make an effort to grow up. Those that don't....well fuck them and find new friends :)"

As a guy, at pretty much any large gathering of people, you have to be on a lookout for those dumb asses who go out looking for a fight. No it's not sexual assault like females have to worry about, but it is still the loss of power and feeling helpless for reasons completely outside of your controls. Hell even if you win the fight, you still get to go about your next few weeks explaining why you have a black eye, your forehead has a huge gash in it, and your lip is all busted up....plus it's a pretty good chance that down the road you'll come across a video of this incident on the internet to remind you of how pleasurable it was."

I fucking applaud you for this part man. This gets overlooked so much in the conversations about this shit. I honestly can't say I know what rape or sexual assault really feels like, but I have to imagine its not too far off from having a much bigger guy or guys holding you down and trying to turn you into ground beef, which is a very real prospect every time we go to the bar or any large gathering, plus add on the the fact that most of the time it happens in public and nowadays someone will get it on video for the rest of the internet to see.
