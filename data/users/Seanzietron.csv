insaneparents,ffb9qxu,t1_ffb9a5w,1579756479.0,"Agreeing to an atmosphere of a sexual temptation before marriage is not something most mothers would support in the child they have reared and loved. The amount of heartbreak and unnecessary pain associated with this has been linked to a large majority of depression cases; parents want the best for their children and they should guide them into a path, which might provide them with safety and true joy. I’m glad that you have a mother who cares. Overall, i worry about the youth of today and the permanent emotional scaring people have after putting themselves in vulnerable situations time and time again. The suicide rates are much higher and often linked to unplanned promiscuity, as it all just happened in-the-moment. . . But then like the fire of their own life, the fling died out; both parties feeling like a piece of their soul was torn beyond repair. Of course a mother would be concerned."

Christianity,ffaz0pe,t1_ffay96b,1579747778.0,"Basically, in rhetorical analysis, people refer logos, which is contextually synonymous with the concept of logic.

In part, God is Logos."
