83% of 126 million is 105 million, almost double what it was in 1975. 10% is 10.5 million jobs with pensions. 

That old companies have pensions is understandable, but it's not like employers are required to create new jobs with pensions, and governments need to cut back because its destroying budgets. It certainly creates no loyalty to the job, but frankly employers have no loyalty to you. So we've roughly lost about a third of the jobs with pensions over the last 50 years. 

But looking at it from the whole, only 6 million jobs out of a country of 300 million lost pensions over a period of 50 years. How would that have a noticeable effect on savings? Or even just the working population, that's 6 out of 126. That's what I was getting at. 

No, it was the great recession. The generation's formative years was in that time of crisis and so it causes you to think about saving more.

We have no idea if the executive misrepresented himself or if Biden did. Since it seems like such a bizarre thing to brag about, I'm going to guess this happened to Biden in a fever dream if it happened at all."

It said they were almost extinct in the lower 48 and soon would be gone. No, I see them almost every day south of the twin cities, usually multiple eagles. Heck up on the north shore I once saw three eating deer roadkill, feet from the highway. They are very common birds.  The little blurb at the NYC museum should be a story of how we can actually make things better when we try."

politics,fezz3ey,t1_fezvp12,1579463406.0,"Depends on the area. In Minnesota the Democratic party is actually the Democratic-Farmer-Labor party, having joined 3 parties together. After decades and decades of mining businesses doing things like making sure immigrants from scandinavia had to work with others who didn't speak their language so they couldn't unionize, eventually, they did, and Labor up north has had a strong influence to this day, even in very small communities. My father who grew up there is a staunch republican but he agrees that the miners needed the unions as they were treated horribly. Anyway, while Minnesota has had close votes for a long time it's always been blue enough, largely because of rural support for Democrats."

First, he was saying 70% of people didn't have a pension, so he was saying most everyone didn't have a pension. 

Secondly to your point that it's triple, there are more people working today, so it's around double the amount of people had pensions than currently have them. Yes, it's significant, but I would not say it's significant in the way that made people significantly save less before than they do now, considering most people didn't have pensions.

I'm an elder millennial with a pension; I was hired 2 days before they stopped offering the pension 15 years ago. I also have a 401k (with partial employer match) and other savings though. The fact I have a pension only impacts my savings rate in that I have less of an employer match. I save at 15% of salary going to 401k and another 5% or so to direct savings. Because of my pension I only get a 3% half-match from the employer (so, uh, 1.5% if I put in 3 or more percent to 401k). I made it through the great recession having bought a townhome at sky high value only to have it plummet a year later. Now I'm very conservative and concerned for my financial wellbeing later, just bracing for great recession 2.0, which causes high savings. I'm sure others are like me."

The woman is an overt anti-Semite who has repeatedly made overt bigoted remarks, remarks of which have been denounced from across the political spectrum --including with a resolution by the Congress!-- because they are simply anti-semetic. It's not isolated, its a pattern of behavior, but she is seemingly given free pass to do this in minnesota."
