offmychest,fewtemj,t3_eqhm7l,1579419216.0,"This really makes me miss my past long distance relationship, though it didn't work out in the end and it wasn't because I didn't try so hard for it to but because the person I was dating was just too mentally unstable and had too many very serious mental health problems. I'm a hopeless romantic though and this experience has not drawn me away from having a long distance relationship. If I ever do again, I just plan to have it with someone who is mentally stable and can be there for me the same way I can be there for them. :)"

Assistance,fe0e98f,t3_en99g5,1578811683.0,"I could help but start crying as I read through all these comments. I lost my grandma, who raised my brother and i, last year (at 30) and this was my first holiday without her. Its still been rough and can hit me like a ton of bricks when I least expect it, but I've also been working on establishing new routines and trying to get on with my life. My most sincere condolences to you and your siblings! If you ever need someone to chat, sooner or later, don't ever hesitate to message me. I know how truly devastating it is to lose someone so close."

Witcher3,fctobzh,t3_eil04l,1577951307.0,I've been off from Dec 14th and start back to work this Friday.

Its such a beautifull game and I look forward to exploring more!"

PCOS,fcdch3k,t3_eh16hk,1577608738.0,"Its awkward having to shave in the morning, than feeling prickly in the evening. I have a lot of excess belly weight too and find it difficilt to manage my weight as it takes forever to lose anything. I also just don't have periods. I stopped taking births control months ago due to the increased risk of stroke so without it I'm just not having periods. Its unfortunate but I'm just learning what I need to do. Basically do my best to stick to my diet and establish a work out routine. I know this is what I need to do to reach my weight loss goals. I'm just glad I'm not the only one to have to shave or manage extra hair. Its not excessive, but it's dark and I don't like feeling prickly!"
