survivinginfidelity,ffhvepr,t3_etmea3,1579955699.0,"Listen. Life is good, even if it doesn't feel like it right now. Yes, you've been betrayed. Yes, everything you had faith in has fallen apart. The thing is that you didn't do it. You have been faithful, I assume. You are the one who can go to sleep knowing that you were faithful. Take pride in that and move on to better things. If you have been faithful, you have proven that you can go this many years and be a loyal husband. SOMEONE OUT THERE WANTS THAT. Be proud of yourself and try to make it through the stages of grief. Trust me. I recently lost a 12 year marriage. I was and still am devastated. It still hurts. The thing is, though, that I am a free man now. Everything that I thought was good, was actually bad for a long time. At the end of the day, I can say that I was a great husband. It was my ex that couldn't deal with real life. Now, I have ample time to be who I want to be. It's a bit lonely at first, but I get to shape myself without the worry of fixing my marriage, nagging me every day. Embrace it, man. It's hard to believe right now, but there are good sides to this situation. Once you heal, you get to have the excitement of a new relationship, just like your cheating wife did, but on terms that let you sleep at night. The kids will be fine. Even your cheating ex will be fine. Just get used to the idea that she wasn't the one for you. I promise that after some months of time and therapy that you have exciting things in store for you. Don't give up. Please don't give up."

What you have to know is that your wife fell for the oldest trick in the book. Limerence. Limerence never lasts. Not only was she in a cloud of limerence, affair partners don't come with the day to day things that a real relationship comes with. Also, there's the excitement of clandestine activities. 

It's not your fault. You may have been able to do some things better, but you didn't break loyalty. She did. If I were you, I would move on. I'm four months away from finding my wife's infidelity out. It's not so bad. I still miss her sometimes, but I have a good life. Good luck, man. I really feel for you.
