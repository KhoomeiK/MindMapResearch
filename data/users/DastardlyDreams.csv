Vive,ffe6jaq,t1_ffdw422,1579838024.0,Controller patch was released a few hours ago.
GetMotivated,ff9axtn,t1_ff96rhf,1579708823.0,"I wasn't really serious either, but I sort of disagree on the false hope bit. It's just a counter to the idea of the forbes ""30 under 30"" number and shows that plenty of successful people had average dayjobs while doing whatever it was that got them to be successful on the side. I've got my dream job already, but I could probably spend some more of my free time advancing that further instead of going on reddit."
GetMotivated,ff96jp0,t1_ff8t2pu,1579706024.0,"No! I'm turning 29 next month and after reading this it's like there is a phantom egg timer ticking away in the back of my head. You've got almost a 2 year head start on me, don't waste it."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fesafux,t1_fes8fmq,1579363222.0,"Well we don't know for sure that she required a ""dream wedding"" for her daughter. Could be a nice little backyard ceremony. So far all we are sure of is that she needs her real hair for it."
news,fes92je,t1_ferwpyw,1579362727.0,"They didn't say you were ""wrong"" for correcting the lyrics. They just said no one actually gives a fuck. In the wise words of Newman from Jurassic Park, ""nobody cares."""
science,feevmqo,t1_feeud4h,1579042184.0,"Why is it always a ""daily blunt"" when people say someone smokes a lot. I'd rather have a dozen small bowls throughout the day than a single blunt."
news,feeux42,t1_feeg72p,1579041747.0,That's so surreal to me. Last time someone complained about the smell of my weed was in high school when my mom texted me to tell me to blow it out the window next time.
AskReddit,fecj7mh,t1_feciq17,1578975221.0,God damn that sounds exhausting
Jokes,fe36ksy,t1_fe31ubg,1578846487.0,"God fucking dammit. When I was 8 I fucking told Kevin from down the street that girls get pregnant when a guys pees in them and he laughed in my face. Well who's laughing now, Kevin?"

insanepeoplefacebook,fdogtkh,t3_emetzb,1578604858.0,"Fuck, now I'm going to spend my lunch break trying to think of what these marble coloured eggs could realistically be."
insanepeoplefacebook,fdoa4zi,t1_fdl9x4u,1578601515.0,"Well ellipticals aren't for training to run, so that's sort of on you for assuming they were."
insanepeoplefacebook,fdo5bn0,t1_fdn59jc,1578599158.0,"I feel like it's a recent thing. My parents started saying over Christmas how they are afraid to admit they're Republicans because of ""violence"" and my dad took his Trump stickers off his work truck. Still no signs of actual regret though and Fox was still on their kitchen tv..."
todayilearned,fd3hppt,t1_fd3eroz,1578158390.0,"Maybe ""sucks"" was an overly strong word. If strapping your baby to your chest doesn't work for you, that's fine. I just don't see why Daniel Craig or anyone should be made fun of if there kid is cool with it. It just seems sensible. You don't get extra points for carrying it in your arms.

I guess I was more replying to your original comment in this chain but I wanted to hear read more about your thoughts on the subject.

Really confused by the downvote comment though, not really sure what you are talking about. I never mentioned voting."
todayilearned,fd3elws,t1_fd3dq09,1578157605.0,So because it sucks for you then everyone should have to hold a baby in their arms only? I just don't see why someone should deserve to be laughed at because they wanted to use both arms and it works for them and their baby.
todayilearned,fd3bztp,t1_fd2zyhn,1578156804.0,"Oh I'm an ""exotic"" grandkid! It's fun because all your white relatives get to relate you to all the exotic movie characters they saw throughout the year, like the kid from Coco. /s"
funny,fcy598y,t1_fcxwejl,1578075007.0,Yeah I was totally thinking actual scooters. Mobility scooters share almost nothing in common with an actual scooter.
trippinthroughtime,fcngri3,t1_fcneo7n,1577811383.0,I saw Incubus in concert once. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

news,fckks32,t1_fckiw3l,1577727485.0,Why did you delete your original comment? You seemed pretty proud of what you were saying in it.
news,fckgewp,t1_fckeqmf,1577724752.0,"Okay, but what would the point of ""redeeming"" the Roman salute even be? The Romans are gone, I doubt they still care if their salute survives to the year 2020, and it's not like we are running out of salute variations."
news,fckfczb,t1_fck8lx3,1577724080.0,"The one by me actually has started asking for a name that they write on receipts right underneath where the order number gets printed. It's sort of dumb but I can see how it could be viewed as ""more personal"" by someone. That being said, they write my name on clear view of me as I stand in front of the cash register. It would be pretty obvious if they wrote ""fucking pig"" instead of a name."
Showerthoughts,fciutn3,t1_fchy0x6,1577670335.0,Both of your grandmas got creampied.
news,fc5utg3,t1_fc5pfh2,1577466383.0,"If B+s are too hard, just do what I did and go for a CSU instead of a UC. 20k total college loans for 5 years(freshman year was kinda a cluster fuck for me to figure out what path I wanted to take)"
SelfAwarewolves,fc4temu,t1_fc4p57i,1577427713.0,"This is almost every ""political"" conversation I have with my parents. It's like they think society can only tackle one issue at a time, and that if you can't 100% solve an issue than it isn't worth the effort.  I don't know how they got so resistant to the concept of change. Like guys, it was just a slogan over a decade ago. Chill out."
relationship_advice,fc3jqkm,t1_fc3i0zu,1577391317.0,"That's still not a bad offer. I mean I have a pretty dang good relationship with my parents, but I wouldn't expect them to bail me out of jail more than once. Once seems like a good gesture."
ChoosingBeggars,fby1p7g,t1_fbxzzyo,1577205959.0,"Also, premium?"
