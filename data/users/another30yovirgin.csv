FriendsofthePod,ffyzk8x,t3_evoxd2,1580359298.0,">This will be one of the most highly relevant, confusing, and competitive caucus nights in recent memory. 

Around 1% of US Democrats will be eligible to vote in the Iowa caucuses and only around a quarter of those will choose to. Although it's possible that one of the candidates will blow the rest out of the water, it looks likely that it will be close to a four-way tie.

So no, it won't be particularly relevant. 

The media loves the narrative that Iowa is everything, because it builds the suspense around the big day. The second it's over, they will be ready to treat every contest as the day that will make or break everything. But they will also do everything they can to keep the other candidates in the race, because once it's decided, it stops being interesting. Remember when Bernie was still in the race and getting all sorts of media attention, even when some of that media attention was basically like ""Bernie, you know you can't win at this point, right?""

The bottom line is, Iowa only matters as much as people believe it matters. There's no good reason for it to matter more than any other 1% of Americans. If you listen to David Plouffe's podcast, he's trying to talk all of the candidates into getting out of the race the second they can if they're not ahead. And yet, Hillary Clinton didn't exit the race in 2008 until June and somehow Obama still won. Weird."

Yeah, I wasn't talking about actual sex there at all, although it might apply. But even when you say you've had the experience with prostitutes, that wasn't the same at all. If you met a woman in a normal dating situation and wanted to have sex with her, you'd have to work up to that point where you're having sex. You don't have to do that with prostitutes. It's agreed already. The plan is to have sex. So that's what I'm talking about. I'm talking about kissing her, or pushing the relationship forward to the place where you have sex, etc. I have no experience whatsoever there, and you probably don't either.

>If you're 30+ most women will run for the hills upon finding out about your inexperience.

Well, I will give them the benefit of the doubt and say that probably a lot of women would be ok with it under certain circumstances. But there's a difference between ""I think I'm falling in love with you and I've just found out this unflattering thing about you"" and the more realistic ""I just met you, we went on a couple of lackluster dates, I'm still deciding if I like you, and now I'm finding out this unflattering thing about you."" 

That's not what bothers me, though. What bothers me is that they don't consider how much damage could be done by the *wrong* person. I mean, I've heard plenty of stories about later virgins who were basically about to have sex, and they admitted to being virgins, and the woman was irked by it and ran for the hills, as you say. I mean, that would destroy me. I'd be a wreck for a month if something like that happened to me. I'd be paranoid that she might tell any mutual friends we have. I'd be angry at myself for telling her (because otherwise we could have had sex and I could have gotten the monkey off my back). And I'd be mad at her for doing that to me too. And you can bet I'd never make that mistake again! But I'd probably just stop dating all together. Which, I guess is no different than what I've done in response to a different bad experience.

I do think there are kind women out there who would totally work with it, but I don't think the odds are really in your favor. So oh well."
