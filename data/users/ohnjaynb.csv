And if they do, they might not distinguish between 737 NG and MAX at booking. You're not going to notice until you're in your seat reading the safety card. At that point you can ask for a refund which the airline refuses and you're SOL. Besides I guarantee 99% of fliers will take a perceived deathtrap airplane if it saves them ten bucks on the ticket price. With things like basic economy fares air travel today is a race to the bottom."

ChernobylTV,feue11c,t3_eqcjtw,1579385632.0,"First off, the liquidators on the roof were not on a suicide mission. They were exposed to very unhealthy levels of radiation, but they survived.
 
Secondly. The problem was not technology. It was more about time. The German robot they used didn't fail because ""they gave them the propaganda numbers"". That was all added TV drama. They had the right numbers. It failed because it was designed to withstand cosmic radiation from above. For this reason the most sensitive components were on the underside making it uniquely vulnerable to the roof radiation, but they tried anyway because it's what they had. An American robot might have been able to do the job, but this was politically untenable. They could've designed and built a robot to clean the roof, but construction would take too long.
 
A reverse example was the improvised lead plated truck for measuring radiation depicted on the show. This did not happen. The Soviet Union already had a purpose built shielded tank designed for atomic bomb test measurements. Legasov himself stepped inside and they safely drove him right up to the reactor."
