AskReddit,ffejl3w,t1_ffein4x,1579850681.0,"> The argument isn't that they are just as free as the rest of the world, if they can't freely travel to the rest of the world or even freely throughout their country it would be absurd to make that claim. The argument is more that with the conditions they are under, the tighter grip isn't exactly irrational. Should the government of NK fall, the consequences would be disastrous. This can be demonstrated by looking at just about any country where this has happened, the USSR in particular actually.

I guess that the restriction on travel (and speech) is the fundamental concern that most people have about the NK regime. Nothing is worth that sacrifice and since the citizens have no influence on how this is enforced, that restriction is simply unacceptable regardless of the rational. 

>Fundamentally different? No. I'd say the DPRK wants the same thing most countries in the world want. Peace, stability and to reduce poverty as much as humanly possible. I'd say the differences lie in the material conditions and methodology definitely plays a big part.

I guess you can say that I've fallen for propaganda, but I'm not convinced that NK government is concerned with peace, stability, and poverty reduction for their citizens. This is based on the discussed travel and speech restrictions along with defector stories. Which leads me to how...

...I made another last minute edit on my response about defectors that would be great if you could address, I promise I won't do it again :)"
AskReddit,ffehgml,t1_ffeft21,1579848168.0,"I did watch some of the first video, and frankly those guys were not very persuasive to me. Yes the rest of the world (and especially the USA) is responsible for many many horrendous actions in our history, but the whole presentation was very patronizing and did not convince me that people of NK are just as free as the rest of the world. 

I don't think this is a black and white issue, but I do think NK is different from every other country on earth right now, and traveling there directly and (substantially) funds NK government objectives. 

And you didn't really address my second point or my final question from the previous comment.

Edit: Also, as I mentioned I did not watch much of the final video, but I'm curious if you could summarize why NK defectors should not be trusted, because IMHO they should be the most reliable source considering the massive risks they took to escape and tell their stories."
AskReddit,ffegw2c,t1_ffedr46,1579847526.0,">Has sweden nationalized the means of production?

No, and I don't expect them to. 

>has Bernie ever proposed to match swedish corporate tax rate?

Bernie's proposal is to return the corporate tax rate to 35% as it was in 2017 [[1]](https://berniesanders.com/issues/corporate-accountability-and-democracy/). The current rate of 21% is the lowest it's been since since the 1930's [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_tax_in_the_United_States). [This graph](https://www.epi.org/files/charts/Hungerford_Figure-C.png) (full article in citation 3) is fairly persuasive that higher corporate tax rates produce higher GDP growth [[3]](https://www.epi.org/publication/ib364-corporate-tax-rates-and-economic-growth/).

My questions:

1. Is it acceptable for people in the USA to advocate for the strong welfare policies found in scandinavia?

2. Do you honestly think there are a large number of americans hoping we can enact policies similar to the USSR or

3. Is it more likely that americans in favor of ""socialism"" support access to medical coverage and education like that which is found all across europe?"
AskReddit,ffef4v5,t1_ffee053,1579845651.0,"I'll be honest man, I'm not really interested in watching 90+ minutes of youtube videos on North Korea (NK) tonight. But from what I saw skimming through those videos, there doesn't seem to be a lot of fact-checkable information for me. 

I'd say that I have two primary reasons to discourage traveling to NK: 

1. The citizens of NK are not free to leave NK and discuss the NK government openly. I cannot comprehend of a valid reason for this to be the case.

2. You can only vist NK through private tours in which nearly all of the money you spend goes directly to the government of NK. If you travel in china or cuba nowadays you will spend most of your money at private establishments which will of course pay taxes on their earnings, but your patronage fundamentally improves the lives of the people running the businesses. This simply is not the case when traveling to NK.

edit: I guess my question for you, is do you not think NK is fundamentally different than any other country in the modern world?"

Bangkok,fe98hka,t1_fe5ydxh,1578935345.0,">It is possible to modify a gasoline combustion engine to burn hydrogen, the efficiency just isn't as good as a fuel cell, and of course it would cost more. At this point it looks like hydrogen won't make as much sense as just using electricity and batteries, but time will tell, things can change.

I'm not very familiar with the idea of using hydrogen with ICE, do you know if/what the emissions are from this type of system? I agree that batteries make much more sense for cars over fuel cells, but IMO electric planes show a great potential to be run on hydrogen, which could have an even greater impact considering the massive footprint of a single flight.

>Pollution isn't going to drive a change, and climate change impact and future risk at the current level won't. We will continue to breathe smog instead.

Unfortunately, this is probably correct, we have to get the (up front) economics to tilt in favor of electric vehicles for mass adoption."

todayilearned,fe90uw2,t1_fe8xflb,1578932960.0,Yes. Biking is a very reasonable means of commuting. My point was never that walking is the perfect end-all solution. My point is that driving a 3000lb vehicle to move a single human such a short distance is a waste of resources. I stand by that.
