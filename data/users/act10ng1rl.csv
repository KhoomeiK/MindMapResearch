AfterEffects,ffqgilo,t1_ffqe1w9,1580133927.0,"I understand the jist of it I just need something more about how cameras size affects z space and placement of z space objects to get desired effects. It’s more the numerical placement of objects for me. I feel like I’m putting things ridiculous far apart and it’s difficult to manage and somehow I’m sure there’s a more efficient way.  I understand photography and camera mm lens sizes and how objects and sizes are affected by focal lengths on DSLRS so I’m not sure if my understanding of that is helping or hindering my understanding of AE camera functions. I’m sure once it clicks I’ll be like DUH but for some reason it’s just not clicking.

cambodia,fe9w2r1,t3_eo7ped,1578941940.0,"To be honest, it is worthwhile hiring a private guide. The one I hired knew the busiest times for each temple and took me the opposite route most guides/tours/recommendations go to avoid the crowds. He picked me up/dropped me off from my hostel, provided water all day, and walked me through each temple and explained everything in English. He costs $50 each day and we were out for 8 or so hours each day. Just my personal opinion that I wouldn't have gotten as much out of it if I tried to plan it on my own or just hired a tuk-tuk driver who wasn't a guide. If interested I can send you his information.

I stayed in Mad Monkey hostel which is a walk to all the markets. For a ""party hostel"" I got a private room for about $20 and just used ear plugs and didn't hear anything. It was decent and clean. If you're looking for fancier, Trip Advisor named Viroth's Hotel, the #1 hotel in world in 2018, they cost roughly $125 and are consider super luxury and looks super swanky.
