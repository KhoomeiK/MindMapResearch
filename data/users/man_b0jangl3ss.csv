Did you not see my comment above?  I said that I was well compensated.  I agree that there is a huge gap between enlisted and officer pay.  However, every officer has an undergrad degree and is ultimately responsible for everything that occurs under their command, the lives of those in their unit, etc.  I'm sure someone in DoD did the analysis of officer pay vs their civilian equivalent position in an attempt to aid in retention."
