Not because I agree with the practice, but having recently gone through a string of interviews for a new job (after being employed nearly 5 years at my previous company) almost every company asked questions about what I had been doing the 4 months between college graduation until my first job. I hadn't listed my shit retail job I had after college because it wasn't related to anything I was doing now, but it came up constantly. All of them referred to it as ""a gap"" and recruiters especially asked me to find a way to add some clarification into my resume before they would send up my resume.

Edit: to clarify - the gap they were worried about was over 5 years old and was between my college graduation and my first professional job. A job at which I worked at for over 5 years and got two promotions in. I had no gap between that job and what they were interviewing me for."
