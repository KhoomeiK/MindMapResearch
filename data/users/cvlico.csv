researchchemicals,femk2b4,t1_fdsstw0,1579259546.0,totally agree. it comes up really quickly and is intense af. i couldn’t tell a difference between ald-52 and LSD.. it’s been around just as long too! i love al-lad and id recommend it to anyone first starting with psychedelics
researchchemicals,femjz6u,t3_emx1u6,1579259427.0,"i find with ethlad it produces a more intense trip (is even say almost twice as strong as LSD) but it lasts only about 4 hours (at least for me). The only time i’ve ever felt i experienced “ego death” was on 200ug ETHLAD. Stuff is great in moderation, especially when you don’t want an 8 hour trip but be careful my dude"
todayilearned,femjulg,t1_fdy1y8k,1579259254.0,or maybe he’s ON something.. /s
todayilearned,femjnlb,t3_epsvd0,1579258976.0,"yes there are other systems that are cheaper, but this is a prime example of investing in the safety of people. i hope i come across a statistic comparing this to north america’s train death toll

edit: the citation for this fact in the wiki article brings you directly to japan’s website for the service. they have every single report possible on there with tons of info answering any question you’d ever have!"
UnethicalLifeProTips,fe488o8,t1_fe471lv,1578856704.0,"i’m in canada, not sure if it’s cause of being raised by europeans or what but a housecoat to me is a bathrobe. and i’d consider a nightgown to be, quite literally a pyjama dress (nightie). one thing i’ll agree with for sure is that wearing one out and about in the hotel is a little distasteful lol"
UnethicalLifeProTips,fe42m1b,t1_fe3ys2l,1578855145.0,are you implying that people don’t wear house coats anymore or that they get called bath robes?
UnethicalLifeProTips,fd912bm,t3_ek227l,1578226611.0,"I’m in canada where we have free healthcare, but people are starting to open up private MRI clinics because the hospital waits are so long. this isn’t unethical but if i was in that situation and really couldn’t wait, i’d find a way to go and pay and get some sort of discount. good luck! waiting for those things can take months even years. i’ve been called back for them years later when i literally forgot what it was for."

UnethicalLifeProTips,fcx838n,t3_ejccqr,1578054987.0,"Bonus- since you seem to be concerned about the wellbeing of your company during the chaotic time, stepping up to help, it’ll also build trust between you and your employer. This makes you more likely to get what you want in general"
UnethicalLifeProTips,fcv3k7w,t1_fcv2syk,1577993921.0,"one is borrowing and the other is stealing..? it’s not the same as robbing a bank but someone is still expecting to get compensated for their work. i’m an artist and i just think how pissed i’d be if someone just saved a photo to their phone and got a print made. No different than downloading a free movie technically, but i’d also argue the opposite that a movie is probably making more money than a single person or a small business. I understand the financial aspect of it (and i do it too) but i’d never want to take from something that would have a negative effect on a single person? fuck way to question your ethics eh"
UnethicalLifeProTips,fcv1hhl,t1_fcv12ks,1577992692.0,"you have a point! like if they wanted to be SO sure that nobody could access the content, they’d be able to. still makes me feel bad though lol"
UnethicalLifeProTips,fcv0qjw,t1_fcuznds,1577992285.0,well content is paid for a reason. it’s unethical for the same reason piracy is

motivation,fch0hwc,t1_fch05y7,1577645998.0,"what does the post say about fiction? i always read non fiction because if i’m going to spend time reading, i want to learn something. you can easily modify this to fit your needs, but if you can’t find the time in a day for 2 hours to yourself and a proper nights sleep, something needs to be re-evaluated bc that’s not healthy."

IDOWORKHERELADY,fbaa28o,t1_fb69evd,1576671586.0,this is so smart. reminds me of when miley made up the bone song in hannah montana to remember parts of the skeleton.. funny how music sticks in our heads like that!
