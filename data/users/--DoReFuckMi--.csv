thedivision,fcnw5hh,t1_fcnvnxq,1577819639.0,"So for my build since it's a berzerk demo, go low armor and high health?"
thedivision,fcnq9vf,t1_fcnpl52,1577816399.0,You could just do a gunner 2 piece tp and gila and then get 1 or 2 armor atts and stack on gear pieces that give health
thedivision,fcnp38j,t1_fcnojli,1577815744.0,"I know I'm definitely not a shield guy, or at least for this build. No firefly or pulse, otherwise others are just too weak on skill power (I'd love to use drone but it's too weak"
thedivision,fcnn8ws,t1_fcnmq0y,1577814707.0,"Maybe I can rework it, I love the multiseekers. But I've never really done turret, tried bomb turret once and hated it. I've always had the preference of heal and offense skill, but maybe I don't need heal since it uses clutch"

HolUp,fciqion,t1_fcip9zx,1577667419.0,"I mean nearly every search makes sense, like the idea that the moon is (jokingly) made of cheese. That's obviously not true, but it's logical that some people would believe it since the joke has been done so many times now. Or the fact of asking if the moon is bigger than the earth, a lot of these are kids going on google to search for a school project. I circled the first one seeing as it absolutely makes no sense at all and that people are disregarding the name of the ""moon""."

DayzXbox,fcbp3cv,t1_fcbmjck,1577589404.0,I'd rather get it for PC since PC seems more stable and as a logical option. Its just one of those games I think at a least a 144hz and amd card should be utilized on
