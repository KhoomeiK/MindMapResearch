SatisfactoryGame,ffw6so5,t1_ffvwvy3,1580286998.0,"That one program should certainly not be a store that gouges developers and has historically been anti consumer.  No refunds for most of the life of steam and they've managed to propagate no license transfers as an industry standard.  This would be no more difficult than a standard CRUD operation in a database.  Right to resell was obeyed by software housed back when licenses were verified by the physical copy of the software.   It should absolutely be obeyed by all software houses.  Valve isn't alone here but they have a big part in making things the way they are.  

They do not have the community's best interests at heart."
SatisfactoryGame,ffvsv1z,t1_ffvs07h,1580272276.0,"I honestly think that most of what steam offers is bloatware and doesn't justify the 30% gouge they take.  They call it industry standard but what they don't say is that they set the standard by being the only option with no competition for so long.  Even when Steam first offered workshop I knew it was going to end poorly.  Then they tried to turn it into a community content store that gouged 70% from content creators.  

Name any feature that Steam has and I'll argue that it is so much better to use the open platform that is PC to provide that feature, rather than locking it to a single store.  They're the only PC controller manufacturer that has gotten away with tying their controller to their store exclusively.  Could you imagine if Microsoft tried saying Xbox controllers only work with Windows Store?  Screenshots?  Please.  ShareX.

Either way, i have nearly 700 games on steam so it's not like i'm opposed to using them.  I just don't buy any of the gimmicky bloat they call added value."

bro"
SatisfactoryGame,ffvhhct,t1_ffvdpi9,1580264220.0,"Any mod loader can manage those basic functions without needing to lock the mods to a particular store.  Some games even manage these basic operations inside the game itself.   Factorio is evident.

The store also doesn't need to support cloud saves for the game to be able to.   Borderlands 2 on steam before steam offered cloud save functions to developers is evident of this.   I probably saw cloudsaves on epic store by these means

I think GoG are the only ones who do universal cloud saves."

SatisfactoryGame,ffumw77,t1_ffumc0i,1580245323.0,Canadian born and raised.  Gamer since commodore 64 days.   I've probably got a lot more gamer cred than you could gather.   It's fine that you don't want to have an honest conversation with me.  I don't think you're emotionally equipped for one.
SatisfactoryGame,ffultyy,t1_ffulch2,1580244685.0,"Any feature that steam gives is also part of epic store, since windows is an open platform.   Screenshots is often given as something steam does that epic store doesn't.  Except that's wrong.    Achievements too but every game I have on epic has achievements.  The store just doesn't track them.   A shopping cart?  I'll manage.  I have a hard time thinking of any ""missing"" feature that can't be done without the store supporting it, or ones that affect the game mechanics at all."
SatisfactoryGame,ffukidj,t1_ffuf75a,1580243878.0,You weren't just asking.   You were a 100% dick about it and are doing more damage than you realize.  All in the name of self righteousness.

SatisfactoryGame,ffu1btr,t1_fftkq0m,1580232360.0,"Workshop it's the worst mod downloader.   It also doesn't enable mod support at all.  It just locks modding to a particular store.  It brings no value to customers.   

Achievements are coming and that's good I guess.  I'm not to much of an achievement hunter.   But wow do I ever not want epic to lock mods to their purchases as well.  That is not a healthy trend that valve is trying to set.  

Cloud saves were more or less always supported.   I think it was only the first week that they weren't."

SatisfactoryGame,ffu0l36,t1_fft4tjz,1580231892.0,Screen shot snobs are cute.   Why does it matter if it's a screen shot or a phone photo?  It's not like pixel fidelity is being lost from Diablo 2's svga.

skyrimmods,ffrc80o,t1_ffqd197,1580155046.0,"They make money just fine and have a ton of community support.  My guess is that the ads are to inconvenience the user base that only ever intends to leech for the rest of their lives.

Storage is cheap but bandwidth isn't.  The people who hold up the community deserve money too.  Ads aren't even that bad and you can even pay a pittance to remove them for life."

This page says you should get uncapped speeds.  I'd ask support.  Also as a premium member, you can select your preferred download servers in preferences. 

One experiment i'd personally run in that situation is downloading from nexus over a vpn you know has good bandwidth.  Your ISP may be throttling and this would confirm or rule that out."
skyrimmods,ffpd93y,t1_ffpbnxe,1580092147.0,Ok.   Thanks for considering it.

Data breaches happen.  They suck.  It's hard to excuse them but not to understand how they happen.  Responsible disclosure and best practices are all we can hope for.   They have all of that in spades.   

Name a company with as many users or more who haven't seen a breach."
skyrimmods,ffpaf01,t1_ffp6rn4,1580090158.0,Nexus probably already has enough income without the leechers to be honest.  My guess is that the restrictions are put there more as speed humps for the leechers.

skyrimmods,ffpa2ah,t1_ffp3qz3,1580089913.0,They're the same people who think the workshop features that steam has is value added to a store.

A pull request is when you tell everybody else on the team to look at your changes.  If they don't want it on their development branch, the license does not prevent you from forking that development onto a new branch.   You're free to do that and you have access to all of the source code of the technology.  Bitcoin Cash and all other derivatives of bitcoin are forks from that development branch.  

When you go off and redefine what these definitions mean, it sort of comes off as sour grapes.  I have to be honest with you.  Then again, you brought up the defense before that was even mentioned.  Why'd you go ahead and get ahead of it there?

Proof of work is only the largest public computation cloud.   The USA alone may have a network hiding in the basement of the NSA that is double that cloud's capacity.   Likely greater.  The current control they have over any system is just dipping their toe in to test it out.

In the event this were to happen, then there would still be ways to maintain the network and have trusted transactions, but the landscape of the wild west would completely change."
