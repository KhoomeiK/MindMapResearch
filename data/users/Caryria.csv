The reason being that due to walking up right our hips have changed and because of language our heads are bigger. The two combined mean that if we actually went to full term there would be no way to deliver the baby naturally.

Awwducational,fft6xhg,t1_ffryw6e,1580210221.0,"Same. I love learning about all the weird and wonderful animals out there and I rarely come across one that I haven’t heard about before. I had never heard about these chaps before until this weekend weirdly enough. 

We went to a safari park and they had a whole pack of these in one of the enclosures. They had fed them an entire hind leg of some big beast (maybe an antelope or possibly given the size of it a moose) and they were all swinging off of it incredibly happy. It was quite impressive given they were probably the height of a large house cat though much more stocky."
AmItheAsshole,ffrta80,t1_ffr1tzq,1580165343.0,"Whoa whoa whoa. It’s got to the point that his stress isn’t the issue anymore. He has got her making wills, packing up all her clothes and putting it into storage and is constantly looking at her like she is going to die. She is the one having the baby and stress at the end of pregnancy is very bad for both her and the baby. For example If she develops pre-eclampsia it can be worsened by stress because it can cause the high blood pressure to get worse. Not only that it can affect the baby as well and not just during the delivery but later life too. 

It’s absolutely fine to be cautious about his therapy but she cannot at this fine worry more about his mental health than her (and baby’s) mental and physical health. I had severe complications during delivery and my hubby was amazing throughout the whole process. I would already have moved out if I’d had to go through what OP is going through."
AmItheAsshole,ffrs4y7,t1_ffrcyjy,1580164608.0,"I’ve also said she needs to ban hubby from the room and should even consider moving out until after the baby but I think you maybe going a little far that he doesn’t care if she dies because he got her pregnant. 

OP hasn’t stated that he’s always been like this, only his behaviour during the pregnancy. It’s entirely possible it was always an irrational fear but that it’s worsened while she was pregnant. And with his father constantly whispering in his ear about his own experience it’s become overwhelming to the point that he’s completely terrified and out of control."
AmItheAsshole,ffrrcj8,t3_eurjt5,1580164108.0,"NTA. in no way shape or form could you be considered the arsehole in this scenario. It sounds to me like your FIL has terrified your husband to the point he has become completely paranoid about the looming delivery. 

Chances are you’ll having a completely complication free delivery but it will still be the most stressful experience ever because your husband is going to be so scared of losing you. However if you do have any complications imagine the reaction of your husband. Maybe it will kick his arse in to gear and he’ll finally be prepared to support you through what is potentially a difficult time. However if it doesn’t and he carries on in this manner while you could be going through scary times it’s only going to make things that much worse for you. 

I had a pretty complication free pregnancy until 37 weeks until I developed very severe pre-eclampsia, had an emergency caesarean, then severe post-natal bleeding which involved another trip back to theatre which then cause a further complication of a spinal fluid leak causing some pretty debilitating headaches. I’m not saying this to scare you but to emphasise that while my husband was my rock, it was still the scariest moment of my life. I couldn’t have imagined going through that if my husband had spent that last few weeks pulling away from me, after telling me I needed to draft a will because I was going to die.  That just sounds horrendous!

Stress towards the end of pregnancy is not good for you or the baby. I would suggest like others have done here and suggest attending a session with his therapist (if he is actually going) explaining the situation and also stating very matter of factly that he either a. changes his attitude completely (a very tall order considering you have already had a few talks with him) or b. not only is he banned from the delivery room but he can also move out to his father’s until after the baby is born. And if he doesn’t listen considering moving out yourself.

Edit: I’ve just read some of your replies so forget the therapist. In fact I suggest you go straight to the moving out stage. He sounds like he has got to the point where nothing you say is going to convince him you are coming through this ok. I would even consider going no contact until after you have fully recovered and you are strong and able enough to have a very frank discussion with him about where you see your marriage going. 

I’m not going to the point of some people here suggesting that he is actively planning your death or that he never cared about you because he got you pregnant with this fear in head. But he is clearly not well at the moment and needs to get help as his therapist is not helping (if he is actually going).

Also please please give us an update because I think we’re all worried about you now."

Damn right it was and I’m pretty sure he would have done anything to take it back. He apologised for it!

Anyone saying he hasn’t because he’s rich needs to do a little research. But I’ll give you a few places to start. He grew up in the limelight. Every outing, every special event was boardcast on tv and reported around the world. When his parents were getting divorced it was all over the place. The speculation about his parentage was practically forced down his throat. When Diana died he was forced to walk behind the hearse, his grief being filmed and broadcast to the world. 

As he got older every little transgression was caught and reported on. He dressed as a nazi to a fancy dress party and the tabloids were crying out for him to be refused from the army. He fought for his country but all people were interested in was pictures of the private parties (all of which with consenting adults unlike his uncle). He couldn’t even kiss a girlfriend in public without it appearing in the papers the next day. 
 
His entire life he has been reported as a bad boy being wild and out of control, while his brother was pretty much touted as the golden child. When the majority of stuff has been stuff that any one of us has done at one point or another. 

Anyway that went completely off topic but everything that has come out from the Queen following the announcement has come across (to me and my hubby at least) as supportive."

Until that is, until it didn’t work. One day he got excited and span round on the spot. Sounds innocent doesn’t it. Not when you realise he didn’t lift his foot and his trainer gripped the carpet. He ended up with a spiral fracture of the tibia. 

Hearing him screaming in agony and yelling kiss it better was heartbreaking. We didn’t initially realise it was broken though we knew it was seriously so we tried the kiss it better, but he kept repeating it over and over again. There was no way I was saying no to a toddler asking for the one thing that he found comforting so I kissed that leg maybe 50’times while we waited for the ambulance.

AmItheAsshole,fey3j51,t3_eqnf9p,1579440323.0,"YTA. You both went through something hideous and while you may be ready to have another child it sounds to me that your wife just isn’t yet. Her saying that her hands are too full with the dog is her way of deflecting the conversation that she doesn’t want to have because it’s still too painful. It was only a year ago after all . It’s entirely possible that she may never be ready and if this is unacceptable to you maybe you need to think about alternative options (maybe fostering, adoption or the worst case scenario divorce). You were absolutely in the wrong to try and start shit in front of friends when you could have had a conversation with her in private afterwards. 

If you are uncomfortable with her calling the dog a baby that’s completely understandable when you held your real baby in your arms but how will she know this if you don’t discuss it with her (maybe you have already, I’m making the assumption as it isn’t mentioned in your post).

She did what most kids in her position would have done. And she has come to realise it absolutely was the wrong thing to do. She is also still entitled to be friendly with your parents. 

However that does in no way mean that you have to accept her apology. Her actions caused you to go through hell and I should imagine your mental health will have suffered (and is maybe still suffering). If I was in your shoes I would give her a chance however it would be with very strict conditions. It would take a long time to gain my trust back and only if the conditions were stuck to.

Personally I think parents should always discuss how they raise their children especially when the parents aren’t together any more. It’s far too easy for kids to play their parents off against each other. Now it’s got to the point where he has been demonised and is likely to see his relationship with his daughter be ruined. 

*Maybe* if he had contacted her before just making a decision about the punishment there would have been a different outcome in terms of her reaction. *Maybe* if both parents were on the same page from the start then *maybe* he wouldn’t have needed to go full nuclear. 

*Maybe* the mum resented not being contacted at all when the result of that punishment means that she’ll now have to drive her daughter around. I don’t know as there isn’t enough information. 

His daughter is clearly incredibly naive and is driving very dangerously and her mum clearly sucks with how she has reacted afterwards because she’s enabling her daughter.

I have a 20 month old and 3 cats. I have been working since day one on getting her to love animals and how to treat them right. She loves all animals but that doesn’t mean that she always treats them well. Her idea of stroking a cat is to slap them so we have to grab her hand and show her how to stroke while saying gentle. We do this all the time and often the lesson sticks and she strokes the cats gently but the next day she is back to slapping because she gets excited. But the only way to train her how to be good with them is by making her interact with them. Though we would never force the cats to interact with her. They have their safe places and we don’t force them to come out.
