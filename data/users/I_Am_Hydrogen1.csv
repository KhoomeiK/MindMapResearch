AskReddit,ffi8jdg,t3_etcyd6,1579967851.0,Have a better support system for young men who are struggling in an economy that is increasingly hostile to them. Much of a man's sense of worth is based on their ability to provide. You can't have society take this away from them and expect everything to be okay. Anything remotely pro-male is branded as misogynistic these days. It is ridiculous. We have a masculinity crisis in America and the world.

personalfinance,ff7l9e9,t1_ff4d5v4,1579652231.0,Agree 100%. Feeling bad about being rich is idiotic and borderline pretentious in itself. The fact that OP has enough self-awareness to even consider these things ensures that they are not actually spoiled.
personalfinance,ff7j9th,t1_ff6q4e3,1579650863.0,"What this guy says. If you know what the modulus operator is and can do FizzBuzz (which apparently not all CS grads can do, which blows my mind) you will find a job somewhere. It won't be at Google, but you'll be making a livable wage."

You clearly don't understand the term. Does talking about this make people uncomfortable? Sure, and it sounds I made you very uncomfortable. But I'm not racist. I am an American that went to an American university wanting what's best for my country. The ""race"" of the foreign country is irrelevant."

EDIT: To any admins reading this, you aren't getting a fucking cent out of me until you admit less Chinese.
