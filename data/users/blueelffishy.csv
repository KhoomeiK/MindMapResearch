AsianParentStories,ff3k3tl,t3_eqia82,1579542742.0,Ive had a lot of other asian american friends that do this. I feel like with how our parents raise us and the general culture a bigger part of our identity and self worth is based on being smart and being right. Once you branch out and value many other qualities in yourself and people i see my friends less eager to correct others
AmItheAsshole,ff2e669,t3_eqzf0e,1579502449.0,"NTA. Do want to comment on a trend though. Some white people in this thread are invalidating their own right to speak on non white oppression, on account on their whiteness. Speaking as an asian, the discrimination that irish and italian people faced wasnt that far off from us. Whether its more or less, thats debatable and we're not going to dive into that. Its weird that in the US white people to mute themselves on these issues somewhat, and the thought that groups of white people may have been oppressed more than a non white group is unspeakable."

Im a man with a newborn son. I was feeding him and really tired and dropped the bottle. This made me start bawling my eyes out! My wife heard my crying and came into the room and rubbed my back and tried to comfort me. When she realized the amusing reference to a common saying, she had an tiny involuntary chuckle not directed at me. She resumed trying to comfort me. I turned to her and said ""this doesnt seem fucking funny to me"" AITA?
I really dont think everyone would be flaming the wife in this situation. Its so weird how much more sympathetic people are towards women, its almost demeaning as if theyre little children."

I guarantee people that if they truly cared and tried and looked into the alternatives they can do it. Yeah itll be inconvenient but it can be done. This excuse is honestly disgusting, not just pathetic but disgusting.

I dont think when people support politicians theyre even supporting the person, more what that symbolize in their head.

Thats why people support gandhi despite the weird pedophilia shit he did. Its not about the person, its about the symbol. He symbolizes peace. The person is irrelevant.

Thats why good people support hillary despite her being a liar and self serving. Shes a symbol of progressive ideals and of rebellion against trump, the symbol of tyranny. The nitty gritty of who she actually was isnt important. Its about taking a stance.

Thats why when i see a trump supporter i dont hold it against them or think of them as dicks, even though trump is a trash person. Doing a reasoned analysis just didnt how humans think about politics. I doubt the sandman kid would actually agree with trump if you did a check by check breakdown of who he is. If hes a dick, then we're all dicks. The majority of people support candidates with this lazy method


Its also why people say to get offline and interact. We need to communicate more. Someone who sees gandhi as their hero and someone who thinks that means they support pedophilia arnt actually that different and divided, its just a misunderstanding

Like im from the midwest and i moved to the south and asked a few guys why they support trump. Turns out they just liked his personality on TV. His charisma made an impression on them and thats what he symbolized. They literally didnt even know about the border camps and shit hes done cause they dont follow the news at all. They might be ignorant but doesnt make em a bad person"

A grown adult doesnt need their fragile little feelings tiptoed around and coddled. 

It was a perfect reasonable request. And if she didnt like it, thats perfect fine too. She could voice it and communicate her discomfort maturely like an adult instead of bawling like a baby and falling back on her ""im pregnant i got hormones"" crutch.

Its absolutely true that guys dont need to have feelings for a girl to have sex. Honestly most guys would be down to fuck any half attractive girl they see on the street, right then and there. Doesnt mean they want a relationship or like them"
AmItheAsshole,fdkf7xs,t3_eldh5o,1578502600.0,"NAH for the same reasons other NAH have given. I think the main reason some feel YTA is that genders switched, dudes are responsible for squashing any insecurities they have, while it seems women get more of a pass for their wounded emotions. Its a double standard but its still NAH for this case"
news,fdj1etb,t1_fdj0ui5,1578455970.0,"A lot of people genuinely dont follow current events at all. Its hard to believe with how integrated society is now with twitter and media shit blasting in our eyes. But a lot of people just work, go to the bar and do their hobbies, sleep and repeat. They dont give a shit about politics. They see other people wear maga caps in their town, all they know is hes kinda charismatic and symbolizes big TV stuff so they wear one too."
news,fdj0b5j,t1_fdiy22b,1578455202.0,"Then everyones a dick. Nobody really picks a candidate by doing a reasoned analysis of the details. Its a shame, but its not unique to trump supporters. I dont think when people support politicians theyre even supporting the person, more what that symbolize in their head.

Thats why people support gandhi despite the weird pedophilia shit he did. Its not about the person, its about the symbol. He symbolizes peace. The person is irrelevant.

Thats why good people support hillary despite her being a liar and self serving. Shes a symbol of progressive ideals and of rebellion against trump, the symbol of tyranny. The nitty gritty of who she actually was isnt important. Its about taking a stance.

Thats why when i see a trump supporter i dont hold it against them or think of them as dicks, even though trump is a trash person. Doing a reasoned analysis just didnt how humans think about politics. I doubt the sandman kid would actually agree with trump if you did a check by check breakdown of who he is. If hes a dick, then we're all dicks. The majority of people support candidates with this lazy method


Its also why people say to get offline and interact. We need to communicate more. Someone who sees gandhi as their hero and someone who thinks that means they support pedophilia arnt actually that different and divided, its just a misunderstanding

Like im from the midwest and i moved to the south and asked a few guys why they support trump. Turns out they just liked his personality on TV. His charisma made an impression on them and thats what he symbolized. They literally didnt even know about the border camps and shit hes done cause they dont follow the news at all. They might be ignorant but doesnt make em a bad person"

AmItheAsshole,fc9e121,t1_fc6c8tn,1577551233.0,"Stop infantalizing a grown ass women. Men are expected to control their emotions under all circumstances. If she doesnt like the request thats fine, she can communicate that maturely instead of wah wah wah bawling like a baby falling on her ""im pregnant got hormones"" crutch. 

Its really telling that a man isnt allowed even simple assurance to make sure they dont spend 18 years of their life living under a lie. And you try to twist that into an act of aggression. Lmao"
AmItheAsshole,fc9cwib,t1_fc6bl35,1577550697.0,"People dont give a shit about the feelings of the man. He wants a quick and simple test for someone whos betrayed him in the past so he doesnt spend 2 decades living under a lie? Fuck him all that matters is the womans feelings. Its not just sexist towards the man it infantalizes women. Its so plain to see. Like yea pregnancy affects you hormonally but do people realize the woman is still a grown adult? A grown adult doesnt need their fragile little feelings tiptoed around and coddled. 

It was a perfect reasonable request. And if she didnt like it, thats perfect fine too. She could voice it and communicate her discomfort maturely like an adult instead of bawling like a baby and falling back on her ""im pregnant i got hormones"" crutch.

People need to stop putting women on a pedestal. This aint equality its literally continuing gender stereotypes treating them like a baby"
