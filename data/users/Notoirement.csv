Hi there !

I searched and didn't found answers to my question.

So,  simply put, I bought FF VI (played it as a teenager but never finished  it), and installed A World Reborn, the core package, because the  characters look great even if they're a little bit too desaturated.  
And there's one thing that bothers me : the battle UI. It's the mobile one.

So  I tried to manually install AWR aaaand it all went to shit, BitDefender  went super mad, blocked everything, I couldn't install FF VI anymore,  soooo I think I'm not going to try that again.

My  question is : if I install the core package, can I install another mod  on top of it ? Here, the Mobile UI Removal and another Battle UI to  replace it.

In the manual installation you have to follow a correct order to not mess anything, so I really don't know.

Have a good day !"

We told each other ""relax, we just under the stress of the recent attacks, it can't happen again""  


""AFP just said there were hostages in the Bataclan""  
Then we all sheltered inside the bar, the start of an insane evening.  


Damn that year"
europe,fdi8874,t1_fdhqhz4,1578437489.0,"Well, 2015 was a rough year. We were all kinda scared about new attacks.  


And then that awful November day came. I was near the Bataclan with friends that night. It was terrifying. Days after that, they were a huge wave of panic across Paris, first time in my life I knew what it's like to have your brain shut off and enter ""survival mode"".  
For a week I was shaking in my commute, scared something will happen.  


The country declared the state of emergency. Which allowed cops to harass thousands of muslims people, most of them for no clear reason. They even used that to harass people involved in ecology.   
Basically, with the state of emergency, cops are now authorized to kick your door, destroy your house and have no responsibilites whatsoever.  
The state of emergency is supposed to have a time limit, but our governement (which was supposed to be left to start with, but took a hard turn to the right there) made it longer. One time. Two time. Three time. Then Macron was elected. And now the state of emergency is common law. Thus : we lost liberty in that matter.  


And then we had strange things. Like, crowd gathering was forbidden. But not for everybody. That year there were the COP21 too (busy year !), and a peaceful march was planned to show our support to the work toward better actions with climate change. Nothing antagonazing, just citizens marching to basically say ""GO POLITICIANS GO !"".  
It was forbidden, for ""security reasons"".  
But in Paris there's another thing called ""dinner in white"" : really rich people gather somewhere and eat dinner. For some reason (money and whiteness) they're allowed to do that and be thousands to be drunk in the Louvre's garden. And they were allowed to do that while the march was forbidden. And we basically noticed that everything related to the climate, social equality was forbidden. But other marchs or protests weren't.  


The other thing was our relationship with the police.  


With Charlie Hebdo and the dead policemen, almost everyone wanted to thank them, they were heroes, something that never happens.  
But the year after, the gov try to pass harsh neo-liberal laws. Of course people were mad because fuck capitalists, if they want money they can work from it instead of stealing ours. And the cops were basically allowed to become really violent.

Whenever someone criticized them for cracking teen's skulls open, ""you celebrated them last year and now you criticize them ?"". So they kept going, no one was eager to stop them. This kept going. And they became more and more violent.  


For one year now, France has seen every saturday protest in Paris. And it's fucking brutal. The police, within the ""don't kill someone"" range have no limits. They've blinded people, maimed others, they wear masks, it's impossible to identify them, they can attack you for stupid reason and get away with it, two days ago someone was murdered by policemen just because he filmed them doing a really brutal intervention.  
Another thing, since May 68, policemen were forbidden in universities. And I'm okay with that, these mongrels have nothing to do near place of knowledge and wisdom if they want to spill blood. Now they can do that again. They were even helped by far-right milicia once.  


Basically, if I can pinpoint how it went, it's a bit like America post 9/11 :   
\-Muslims are more and more targeted  
\-Our country shifted to the right (and we're talking about FRANCE, the last time we had truly left winged people was ... the resistance council. The two others left president were actually right-winged -\_-), our far-right party (founded by nazis, traitors, and even some nationalists resistants) was in the second turn of the 2017 election, and no one was surprised.   
So basically, it worked out pretty well for ISIS on that matter : our country is ready to create more and more volunteers to become terrorists instead of just thinking for a mincute ""wtf are these people doing that?"" (the answer is : heavy racism that pushes them out of society and into the hands of these cults)  
\-The police has gotten power and are now violent like I've rarely seen with protesters. The second one isn't directly linked, but it's a clear consequence of it.  


As of Paris, things are kinda back to normal. We're no longer frisked everytime we cross a door (in 2016, just to go to the cinema, I was frisked THREE TIMES.), so maybe there's changes that I didn't notice or don't think about right now, but things are back to normal.
