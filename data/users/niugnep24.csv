But yeah, that’s why she “didn’t just take the public option” Inquisitor Reagan.

Er, public option doesn't exist yet.

I asked about marketplace plans. You can sign up for a marketplace plan without having to prove eligibility for subsidies, and there's a procedure to ""estimate"" your income subsidy and you don't have to ""prove"" anything until tax time, when you settle the difference.

That said, current marketplace plans do have high deductibles and may not have helped as much as your sister needed it, but it would cost her almost nothing to at least have some catastrophic coverage.

Under Biden's plan, the public option would operate similarly to current marketplace plans in this regard, but would have much better deductibles & coverage than is often available.

Buttigieg:

A backstop fund will reimburse health care providers for unpaid care to patients who are uninsured. Individuals who fall through the cracks will be retroactively enrolled in the public option.

Biden:
>Additionally, Biden will ensure people making below 138% of the federal poverty level get covered. He’ll do this by automatically enrolling these individuals when they interact with certain institutions (such as public schools) or other programs for low-income populations (such as SNAP)

From Biden's web site:

This means that no family buying insurance on the individual marketplace, regardless of income, will have to spend more than 8.5% of their income on health insurance.

From Buttigieg:
>Cap marketplace premium payments at 8.5% of income for everyone, which will primarily help middle-income individuals and families.

Both plans provide the public option for free to low-income people, so that's not the issue. Buttigieg's site mentions automatic enrollment for ""Individuals who fall through the cracks"" but I'm not sure what that mechanism is and if it actually gets you to 100%

It seems the real issue is that Biden's site gives the explicit 97% number, while other ""public option"" candidates are leaving it vague."
