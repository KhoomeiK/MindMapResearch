That made millions of people not only more productive, but also more alive. Which is a great plus, in my books.  
   
At this point, all his ""bad"" deeds are FAR outshined by going above and absolutely beyond any average ""good person"" ever would or could.

memes,fernlx5,t1_fer2ib3,1579356172.0,"Well, your bio-dad is probably better off away from that woman. I literally just watched the movie and there were so many nuances to how Joaquin portrayed the character and his state of mind. I have mixed feelings about the trailers though, because I don't think it did justice to the overall dark and sombre tone of the movie. However, maybe that's a good thing since many people who otherwise wouldn't have seen this movie, did and it might have swayed a few minds how they think about the unfortunate and the downtrodden. It's a shame your fam wasn't one of them.  
   
All in all it's a hard movie to watch and, well, not to sound iamverysmart material but I can't put it otherwise at this point - one has got to have the capacity for empathy, beauty and conscious thought to appreciate it. It is a very well made movie and one can acknowledge that even if it's not one's ""cup of tea"". Your folks really just didn't get it. This movie was not made for them. Sorry, but pearls for the swine. However, there's plenty more who appreciate it highly and that gives me hope.  
   
But don't be angry or distraught. No one's perfect. They're most probably not terrible people just because of this. We all have our inner worlds, experiences, tastes, flaws, complexity/simplicity etc. Focus on yourself to always improve, learn, grow. Don't take others' bitterness to heart unless you want to multiply that bitterness that's already present in the world.

Sorry, got a little emotional there. It's.. been a rough few weeks."

This. A train moves fast and smooth. If you're engrossed with the scenery or chatting with friends, you very much can fail to hear a train coming, except for the loud-ass horn, if the conductor notices you in time. If you're surprised by a train barreling towards you, chances are, fear can also root you in place. It's terrifying metal fist of death that absolutely will not stop or swerve. You either get away or you die.

"" I saw Ellen Degeneres at a grocery store  in Los Angeles yesterday. I told her how cool it was to meet her in  person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother her and ask her for  photos or anything. She said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken  aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but she kept cutting me off and  going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing her hand shut in front of my face. I  walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard her chuckle as I  walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw her trying  to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in her hands without  paying.

The boy at the counter  was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Mam, you need to  pay for those first.” At first she kept pretending to be tired and not  hear him, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the  counter.

When he took one of the  bars and started scanning it multiple times, Ellen stopped him and told him  to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical  infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even  think that’s a word. After he scanned each bar and put them in a bag  and started to say the price, she kept interrupting him by yawning really  loudly."""

Acting like there is no middle ground; If you're not with us you're against us; There exists only good and evil; If I don't like it - it's evil etc. By your words, that is the mindset of your boomers who fucked up the 'conomy and so on. However, that is not a mindset unique to a generation. You can see it all around the place today as well. It is a mindset of near-sighted, not thinking, selfish stupid people. That fucker of a president in Brazil who theoretically burned down a vast part of the rainforest? Not a boomer, but a selfish dumbass nonetheless. Australian PM responsible largely for the fires and all inaction? Also not a boomer, but a major asshole and dumbass. USA actions in the Middle East? Boomers AND young people acting the same idiotic way.  
   
What I'm trying to say - yeah, meme haha, but from my point of view at the end of the day you are becoming the same salty unreasonable people you are denouncing.
