1. We don’t do it
2. We have no reason to explain why to a customer. 

Just, order and enjoy! Don’t have an aneurism about our mysterious business model! It’s not like cracking a code... we just don’t do it. Any reason needed for explaining it has been listed above"

Like I said, small place, small kitchen. They only have so many six pans to hold shit and so much ticket room on the line to hold tickets. If every ticket had a prompt, then it would be mayhem.

I think we need to train customers. If they want to go to Water Country USA, or ride the rollercoaster, they must be “this high”.

It’s to protect the business. 

It is a time consuming thing when my helpers aren’t old enough to pour alcohol but put in food orders. They fuck things up. 

It is not a well oiled machine, it’s a family place, and it shows in flavor but not in functionality.

Honestly, if you want a half and half pizza... 

There are so many worse things in life to have to worry about. It’s pizza. If it’s good pizza, enjoy it. If you want special toppings or a BYO style, there are other options mostly anywhere."

TalesFromYourServer,ffupo3f,t1_ffunofn,1580246915.0,"We have a super tiny kitchen within a food desert. In my city. There aren’t high end spots around me that make pizza. We also are a market so we have things that Papa J’s doesn’t have.

The business has been open for 4 years and pizza keeps sellin like crazy. But, in order to make everyone happy, we have to make a few unhappy. The return customers keep us open, not the new ones. 

I know it sounds weird, but the company is floating well while we uphold these standards. 

Sometimes the customer isn’t right, and the product is good enough to keep the cool ones close and the abusive customers away"
TalesFromYourServer,ffudjl3,t1_ffu8mwv,1580239697.0,"And it would always be cancelled after spending a few minutes on the phone with them to get their order, right? Wasting extra time for other customers.

I worked at a pizza spot (just put in my two weeks) where people would get super offended that we didn’t have a la carte style ordering or build your own pizzas.

It was because we had a set menu, two cooks that have an oven that fits 8 pizzas total. 

Papa John’s is across the street, they’ll put whatever you want on there! That’s not our business model because we can’t support half and half pizzas, modified orders, etc.

Just order the pepperoni or the cheese, and stop asking us to do half and half.

If you want our pizza, it’s by our methods."
