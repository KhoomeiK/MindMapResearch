offmychest,fc33zlf,t1_fc31mhd,1577380896.0,"You're right! I'll get a proper scan in the next visit, and the pain is limited to the lower back only, it's always there, I feel abnormally weak in that region, like when I do planks I feel my spine wiggling, up and down, it too unstable, I feel exercises won't help much unless the issue is ascertained. I feel so bad over health issues, you know what I used to do a lot cycling and outdoor sports and I was perfectly healthy until I began college, it's like my life turned upside down, some for good and some for bad, family issues, career, and then back ache, I know I'm too young to say this but I am getting tired lol, also dad isn't really supportive for treatment, he's like ""you're too young, stop being lazy and all the pain will be gone"" 
Anyway thanks for listening and giving me suggestions, really I appreciate your help!!! :-D"

Also back when I was in high school, I accidentally jumped off from the 1st floor, landed on feet, right ankle was twisted and got a ligament injury, but I didn't have any back pain then"
