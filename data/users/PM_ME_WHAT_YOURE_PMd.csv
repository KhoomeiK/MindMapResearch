A) It would be difficult to get that list - or probably an even a more thorough list of dissenters - via Big Data collection? Between Facebook, Amazon and Google (and probably even the reddit comment you just posted in reply to me), it seems like we‚Äôd lose very little privacy while also at least making it a tiny bit easier to keep guns away from crazies. Of course, the best solution would be defanging data collectors, but I don‚Äôt know how we‚Äôd do that without relying on a government that neither of us really trust.

B) Citizen militias could hold their own against the most expensive military in the history of the world? It seems to me that we‚Äôd be better off relying on those highly trained, well-equipped men and women not wanting to fire on their countrymen rather than on being able to beat them in some kind of guerilla warfare.

Again, I‚Äôm totally unfamiliar with the debate and just trying to get a feel for it. Not trying at all to be contentious."

2) The one-eyed (but gifted seer) Cthaeh is Selitos.

3) The Cthaeh is an Amyr, causing pain for the greater good: sending Kvothe on a path to kill Cinder.
