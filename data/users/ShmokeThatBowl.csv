HOWEVER. You said you were raised in a highly religious household. At the age of 13, there is a pretty good idea she didn't fully understand the damage of what she was doing.

explainlikeimfive,fbwtusy,t3_eawyk1,1577159285.0,"You pretty much hit the nail on the head. There are dozens of aspects to music that while shared amongst many songs and artists, make each one it's own unique song. There are LOTS more, but here are just a few basic examples:

* There are 24 different musical ""keys"" (not to be confused with piano keys), and each song is usually written in 1 or 2 keys. If we change the key a song is played in, it sounds drastically different. For example, changing a song from C major to C minor would make the song go from ""happy"" sounding to ""sad"". Often times artists use a change in key to affect the tone of the music; either to give a rise sounding effect, like changing from E flat major to B flat major, or to change the tone of the music from ""sad"" to a ""happier"" resolution
* The chords that are used in the song largely depend on what key the song is in. (i.e. in C major, the main 4 chords musicians use are C, G, F, and A minor as they are all the relative keys to C Major) Some artists may be ""criticized"" for only using the same four-chord pattern, but yes, ***tons*** of music has an overlap, or shared, chords 
* The melody line, or the ""vocal line that everyone is familiar with"" part of the song is another aspect, usually the most memorable part that makes each song ""unique""
* Rhythm is another big one - by slighly altering the rhythm of the music, we are able to change the way the way it sounds to the ear. Without the correct rhythm (or melody line), a song can be unrecognizable."

explainlikeimfive,fbwtusy,t3_eawyk1,1577159285.0,"You pretty much hit the nail on the head. There are dozens of aspects to music that while shared amongst many songs and artists, make each one it's own unique song. There are LOTS more, but here are just a few basic examples:

* There are 24 different musical ""keys"" (not to be confused with piano keys), and each song is usually written in 1 or 2 keys. If we change the key a song is played in, it sounds drastically different. For example, changing a song from C major to C minor would make the song go from ""happy"" sounding to ""sad"". Often times artists use a change in key to affect the tone of the music; either to give a rise sounding effect, like changing from E flat major to B flat major, or to change the tone of the music from ""sad"" to a ""happier"" resolution
* The chords that are used in the song largely depend on what key the song is in. (i.e. in C major, the main 4 chords musicians use are C, G, F, and A minor as they are all the relative keys to C Major) Some artists may be ""criticized"" for only using the same four-chord pattern, but yes, ***tons*** of music has an overlap, or shared, chords 
* The melody line, or the ""vocal line that everyone is familiar with"" part of the song is another aspect, usually the most memorable part that makes each song ""unique""
* Rhythm is another big one - by slighly altering the rhythm of the music, we are able to change the way the way it sounds to the ear. Without the correct rhythm (or melody line), a song can be unrecognizable."
