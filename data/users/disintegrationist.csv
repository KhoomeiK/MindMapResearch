news,feyysyl,t1_feyttr8,1579452165.0,"Well, there's some room for debate if the employee (manager or otherwise) acted clearly against policy and that is shown by the company being able to recover at a later date from the person who acted against policy.  But of course the plaintiff will go against the deeper pocket first because... well, we all know why.

That being said, the fact that nothing serious happened cannot imply that something drastic COULD not have happened, like a hostage situation, traffic accident etc. and that's when liability from the bank would become extremely high and therefore justifying the existence of such policy in the first place.
