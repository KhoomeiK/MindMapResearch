What a stupid statement. What does the danger of the others have to do with this? Just because the others were potentially overblown (although they were handled very well, had they happened a few hundred, or even 100 years ago it'd have probably been much worse), has no impact on if this one is overblown or not."
IAmA,ffhpdb5,t1_ffg1sal,1579946779.0,"Yes but that's not all that relevant. Someones personality is much more dependent on how they were raised by their parents, what community they grew up in (and their relationship to that community), their genetics, their personal ""choices"" (although free will is kind of debatable, so maybe move this into randomness and environment), and just random factors (e.g. random accidental early childhood minor brain injury, toxin exposure, coincidentally ending up in a traumatic experience, etc).

Their personality is much less effected by how much money and opportunity they had when growing up. Which makes total sense, for the vast majority of our species we've been in a totally different situation where these types of things would've been much smaller, and even then wouldn't have been all that important. This level of wealth and protection is absurdly higher than any time in history. Someone who is in the bottom 5% of wealth in a western country has better access to food, education, medicine, a much lower birth mortality rate, much higher life expectancy, much more access to information, etc than even royalty did just a few hundred years ago. This level of wealth for everyone is pretty much unheard of, so it having little impact on personality makes a lot of sense."

IAmA,ffhoxql,t1_ffgxt3f,1579946108.0,"You could say the exact same thing about going to college though.

""Sorry man, but I'm not buying the whole excuse that someones parents not helping them through college might be as traumatic as (not being able to go to school | being married off at 14 | suffering malnutrition through most of your early life) just because one person had such an easy life that they've never had to deal with actually bad situations. I don't really care if the emotional pain they feel is equal, if anything is just an indication of how out of touch they are.""

The fact that you listed not going to college as an ""actual bad situation"" really shows how extremely out of touch you are as well. To a very large number of people on the planet, you comparing that to ""an actual bad situation"" and ""being traumatic"", is an absurd amount of arrogance and entitlement. I'd say the gap in entitlement between someone getting upset about not getting a new iPhone, and you not going to college, is a much smaller gap than you not going to college, and the problems that a large percentage of the planet deal with.

Edit: this might look like I'm being judgemental towards you, but I'm not. It's completely normal to be adjusted to the environment you grew up in, rather than some arbitrary baseline. Being upset you couldn't go to college is not a problem, being upset you couldn't get the new iPhone is not a problem, being upset you didn't get any chance at any level of education is not a problem. The problem is how you deal with that.

Someone being raised well in a wealthy environment would react differently to someone who was raised poorly in a wealthy environment. The one who was raised well might realize that while they are upset about not getting the iPhone, would react to that by looking at why they didn't, and instead then maybe deciding the are not actually entitled to one and maybe could instead earn one themselves somehow. Whereas someone who was raised poorly might throw a tantrum like you implied, or similarly might act vengeful.

Similarly someone raised well who ended up not going to college, would react differently to someone who was raised poorly but who couldn't go. The person who was raised well might decide to make sacrifices to try and pay their own way through college, or maybe they will try to get into whatever the field is another way (you can still get into a very large number of fields without going to college, even STEMish ones like computer science), or maybe they will fight for political change to make college more accessible. The person who was raised poorly would have a different reaction, instead they might just become very vindictive with the system/their parents/etc, instead of trying another way maybe they will just give up on what it was they wanted to study. The point being they will act destructive instead of constructive.

Finally someone in a poorly developed country, but was raised well will again act differently to someone who was raised poorly there. If they lost access to a primary education (had to work to support their family, civil unrest, etc) and were raised well then they can turn that into a positive, maybe they will fight so that their kids do have the ability to learn, maybe they will instead learn other skills to help take care of them and their family, etc. Again someone raised poorly might instead be destructive with the facts, maybe they will again act vengeful in some way towards the society, maybe they will also try to prevent future children getting an education, etc.

The point the person was making was that your reactions and entitlement are normalised to the environment you were raised in. There's nothing wrong with that, you don't control it. How you're raised doesn't have a large role over how you emotionally react to things being denied or given to you. Instead how you're raised impacts how you respond to something being denied or given to you. And the response is what matters."

thinkpad,ff8fds6,t1_ff8axgy,1579676086.0,"Lenovo had three brands produce keyboards for the X220, W520, T420, etc. These were NMB, Chicony, and Alps. Generally the Alps are regarded as the worst by almost everyone and they don't even feel good when new, they have grey rubber domes. The second best is generally the Chicony ones with white rubber domes, and those are apparently quite good, but tend to age poorly and go mushy. NMB are the best and what I have listed here, with the TP red domes.

There is no better one than the NMB as far as I know. Any ones like ""Jarri"" from Amazon are either just reboxed old stock, in which case they might have NMB ones, but I doubt it as they'd likely know the value. Or alternatively they're just knock offs made in China via a variety of ways (obtaining full designs, obtaining or stealing old molds, running their own runs in secret, etc).

At best they're just going to be fake NMB ones, but the chances of that are super low. In reality they'll swap any material they can if it's cheaper. So you'll likely end up with e.g. more brittle/easily discoloured/etc plastic from where they used a cheaper variant, or stuck keys from where they've used a mold ten times past it's rated lifespan, pretty much anything.

The TrackPoint nub also has a black square/X/+ shape inside it when you pull it off, unlike some other trackpads where the nub is purely rubber and the full size bit is on the TrackPoint itself. The keyboard itself tends to feel like it has a significantly further travel distance to me, and there's a much more of a snap and then a thud when it reaches a certain actuation point.
