I once had a guy tell me that peanut butter was a great source of protein. He was shocked when I told him it was still mainly a fat source. They do their advertising well."
fatlogic,ffaz49n,t1_ffaxf38,1579747844.0,"Totally disgusting story here but yours reminded me of this one. 

My boyfriend's little brother once fingered a girl while she was on her period. Except she didn't tell him. He found out when he looked down at his hand and saw blood on it. Like who does that? 

The first time my boyfriend and I had sex was period sex lite. It was like my last day, and both of us just couldn't wait anymore. By that point it was basically nothing, but I was still like it's up to you dude. So was super messy and we can both say we technically had period sex, but I would have never done it on one of my heavier days. Props to anyone who can do it but nah too gross."
AskReddit,ffawr91,t1_ffavoua,1579746282.0,"Ok that actually makes so much more sense. Like I said, I have 0 working knowledge on back end shit, so I would have never guessed that it works like that. I was always a good test taker so I never really thought about them. That's for explaining!"
fatlogic,ffavdil,t1_ffau52h,1579745367.0,"You weren't but the guy above is. You chimed in that wearing a belt makes it harder to catch your breath. At which point I split hairs. You're not wrong and I wasn't calling you out, just explaining why I would split hairs. I do feel like I have a bit of an issues with being at little too pedantic though so like eh. Idk I just like things being clearly defined."
fatlogic,ffanvk1,t1_ffan0qw,1579740352.0,"If you're saying everyone who isn't out of breath after squats is a non-lifter, I'll gladly split hairs."
fatlogic,ffaly9n,t1_ffajmfe,1579739050.0,"Idk, not being able to get enough air seems different with out of breath. I breath heavier when I squat yeah, but out of breath means gasping for air in my book. And I'm certainly not at that point despite lifting at between 8-10 rpe at any given point."
fatlogic,ffa7bgt,t1_ffa6yvr,1579729284.0,"Yeah it all ends up in some program that averages it all out. The get my BMI and everything so as long as that average is good, I think I should be good. I kinda accidentally stockpile my calories for the weekend so it does always average out!"
fatlogic,ff9xk27,t1_ff9t0eh,1579723680.0,"Not everyone wants to be a bodybuilder. Pretty sure powerlifters don't get out of breath after squatting and I wouldn't say they suck at squatting.

Edit: r/gatekeeping"
AreYouTheOne,ff9wth7,t1_ff9oq1a,1579723224.0,"What else would you want him to say? Maybe you like pet names, but I would prefer best friend over something like you're my sugar bear or anything else just as mushy. And ""you're my girlfriend"" would just be odd."
MtvChallenge,ff9wkmm,t1_ff9wek2,1579723076.0,"Oh for sure. But you would think that being a combat veteran, he would be the least likely to break down like that. Maybe I'm overestimating the benefit of combat experience."
fatlogic,ff9w0mm,t1_ff9lamb,1579722734.0,"My 6'2"" bf flew from to Chicago to Thailand a couple years ago. Middle seat next to two overweight people. Heard it was *rough*. Luckily the next time he flys to Thailand (& my first time there) he's gonna shell out for first class!"
fatlogic,ff9vfdc,t1_ff9kri6,1579722349.0,"I am small, but still larger than a housecat, and I can comfortably curl up in airplane seats while still staying completely contained in my seat. It's wild to me that the can't even entertain the idea that some humans can fit in the seats fine."
fatlogic,ff9ufrz,t3_esd9hw,1579721599.0,"I gotta track my food for a week for my nutrition class. Good thing I'm experienced with it! Kinda worried that my teacher will be concerned if one of my 900 calorie days end up in there but some days I'm just not hungry.

Edit: it does balance over the week. Maintenance for me is like 1,600, 800 make-up calories isn't hard to do when you eat out Friday, Saturday, & Sunday."
fatlogic,ff9tcdj,t1_ff9sll6,1579720821.0,Oh yeah I'm a massive hypocrite! I fucking hate running. At the same time I'm not telling people that it's not important and once the weather's nicer I'm going to try to start doing it with my dog. But I had a good laugh one time because somebody said it seems like my training was all cardio and I just had to laugh because the last time I did cardio was 3-4 months before that.
fatlogic,ff9rxtv,t1_ff9r1im,1579719861.0,"I mean yeah people definitely put too much stock in cardio. But like you said, it's important for heart and lungs health. Obviously bodybuilding professionally is a bit of a gray area for caring about your health, but the followers these women are talking to are definitely not professional bodybuilders. There's a happy middle ground between advertising cardio as the end-all be-all and going a ewww cardio so gross, don't ever do it."
MtvChallenge,ff9m749,t1_ff9k3sm,1579715921.0,"When I was in high school I was walking into my friends house and her dumbass dog ran out. We were out on the street in the rain looking for that POS for hours. He was eventually found and I think he's still alive to this day but yeah, shit happens sometimes.."
MtvChallenge,ff9liaq,t1_ff9jjkw,1579715516.0,It would make more sense. And explains why he would have turned that down. His kid wasn't even 1 at that point. I keep forgetting the recruiting from survivor because at this point no one has been on from survivor.
fatlogic,ff9k8xo,t1_ff9j1vn,1579714775.0,Since you keep saying pub I'm assuming you're somewhere on Europe. I'm so dang jealous of you guys! I work 30 miles from home & my boyfriend's friends are like at least 10 miles away from us. I used to live in Chicago and it was much more walkable. but now I'm in the part of the Midwest where there's like barns and farmland. I don't even know if my city has a bus if it does I don't work in the city I live in so I don't even think the bus could take me to work.
MtvChallenge,ff9j97t,t1_ff9degh,1579714185.0,"He did not. I would assume vendetta's because that's the first season they started having big brother people on it but I'm not sure. 

I'm just trying to figure out what season he would do good in socially.The seasons recently have definitely been a whole lot of social game. he's really only close to Frankie and Nicole and Victor from big brother. And we saw what a flop Victor was. I doubt his social game would be much better."
fatlogic,ff9bhtj,t1_ff966g2,1579709177.0,"Idk it really depends. I do my grocery shopping once every two weeks, buy a lot of shit online, and then everything else it's run in run out real quick. Socializing as well really depends. I haven't established a friend group in the area yet so I don't really socialize but my boyfriend's friend group does most of their socializing online and most of my old co-workers would go weeks without socializing other than work and family. It really depends on age group and culture I feel like but yeah idk. 

I also don't really consider things you have to do to be a functional human to be that impactful on your activity level. Like labor intensive jobs are definitely going to bump you up there but buying supplies and eating food and going to and from work (unless you bike or walk) don't really factor all that much to me. You don't *have* to walk your dog an hour every day, you're making that choice. 

In your example, based off of various tdee calculators asking to rank activity level, I would say person 1 is lightly active and person 2 is sedentary."
MtvChallenge,ff92qqc,t3_escaol,1579703408.0,Caleb Reynolds from big brother just mentioned was asked to do The Challenge but that it wasn't for him. And then talked mad shit about how he's cut from a different cloth than everyone on the challenge and that they've never seen anyone like him on the challenge. Just because he's a combat veteran. He had to be med evacuated short into the season on survivor. Obviously being a combat veteran is difficult but that doesn't mean shit when transferring over into a reality competition show.
fatlogic,ff90pr2,t1_ff90m5u,1579701890.0,"I heard it was nasty but wasn't it developed to be a meal replacement for people who actually needed it. Like military or some shit? Or did I just make that up?

Edit: ok yeah I definitely made that up."
