But it's like a lot of long running media in that new fans should eventually make their way to earlier stuff just to appreciate how they got to the thing they enjoy today.

Best example is music imo.  A lot of times you can go through a discography and connect dots to see how an artist got from sound A to sound B etc."
FloridaGators,ff9pkzg,t3_eseche,1579718093.0,"Frustrated.  Like last night, sure the reffing was bad but the worst part of that game was the 4 possession stretch where we straight didn't play defense.  Like they would get a rebound that went past 3 of our guys and just take it to the rim uncontested.  We don't allow that maybe that hot streak at the end wins the game.  Otherwise it was entertaining but shit like that frustrates the hell out of me.  I also still think we don't play with enough tempo."

dancarlin,ff80d11,t1_ff7z22i,1579662709.0,"I was thinking of this after listening to it on my commute home from work and to me there is a difference between them in philosophy.  Alexander, Ceaser, Genghis Khan, etc. all are figures not people.  Hitler is a person associated with a philosophy and ideology that is rightfully seen as evil.  I think it is possible in 2500 years for Hitler to be seen more as a figure than as a person.  We will never imagine that because there are people alive who remember living in that time and people who know people who remember that time but every generation there is more and more disconnect.

Counterargument though is that we didn't have the records, the first-hand accounts of the victims, the memoirs, the writing and video, etc. of the ancients that we do of Hitlers area.  That could prove to be the biggest difference but like I said we are way to connected to that era to ever truly unobjectively view it like that."
