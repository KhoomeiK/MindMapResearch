thinkpad,ff3i30b,t3_erddbo,1579541502.0,Does the graphics card make a difference? Sounds like a stupid question but I've heard conflicting things about it. Mostly that it only really increases the heat output?

SuicideWatch,fezhn1m,t3_eqww8z,1579457429.0,There literally is no point. The point is for you to find a point then stick to it. Have the point(s) give your life meaning. Its all a corny pile of shit. I fucking hate this entire reality its all a joke.
thinkpad,few1ilh,t1_fevgx81,1579404145.0,Hey thanks for all the info. I still have a lot too learn its plain to see but always down to do so! I'll take a peak into these and see what is the best option is. I would more than likely buy one of these and upgrade to ssd and higher resolution screen right away.
thinkpad,fevdlez,t1_fetlgow,1579396191.0,i just have been hearing alot about it and Im interested in checking it out.
thinkpad,fevdim2,t1_feti7ve,1579396154.0,"i want to learn about Java, and i like to really get into the amount of customization linux provides. and laptop is about mostly portability, plus if i could take advantage of multiple hard drives on a laptop then maybe multiple OS. I've just be interested in diving deeper into things. plus the tinkering aspects, doing builds. stuff like that. especially if i can spend sub 200 for something that gives me the ability to check multiple boxes. i understand linux is mostly lightweight and i don't need much power so, something cheap with future proofing capability doesn't sound like a bad idea or heavy commitment into something i don't know much about."

thinkpad,fetbv06,t1_fet898w,1579373684.0,Right now I just have a desktop mostly for gaming. I plan on utilizing a laptop as well for work and eventually school if life permits. That's why I'm looking.
thinkpad,ferlx6i,t1_fepne5t,1579355622.0,I don't have anything worthwhile laying around. I have the money to buy one and upgrade or just buy a newer laptop. I just would appreciate tinkering on it. I don't have a think pad but I want one so that's why I'm asking around
thinkpad,ferlnqa,t1_fepocqb,1579355519.0,Dude I know NOTHING lol I'm trying to learn. Or at least start somewhere I apologize for my uneducated comment.
thinkpad,fepllg6,t3_eqb3bz,1579323713.0,Hey. Ive been wanting to buy one for cheap and upgrade should I? I'd like to start learning Linux and teaching myself other things about coding and programming. Is this one of the better models?
