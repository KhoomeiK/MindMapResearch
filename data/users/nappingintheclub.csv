AskReddit,ffi4jg7,t3_etcyd6,1579964870.0,"men disproportionately make up suicide deaths because the methods they use are more violent--many women don't succeed in suicide because they attempt to OD, instead of things like guns. Gun control would inherently decrease the violence in male suicide attempts and increase likelihood of survival and make suicide rates more proportionate"

tbh you should probably cut back on lifting so much--be careful about your knees especially! or be sure to hit legs less frequently now that you have good muscle existing--do 1x a week for maintenance, and cardio like stairmaster/ hiit/running can do the rest"

As mentioned in a different comment, part of gp does share district resources with harper woods, however the Park is a funnel to gpsouth high school and the gpnorth district is the one with HW. GPP is walkable, great public park for residents, great great great public schools, and as commutable to detroits downtown as you can get--its like a 15 minute shot down jefferson, if not less. all the houses in gpp are old in a cute and quaint way, and there are plenty of community events, restaurants, and lakefront views to take in. neighorhoods are big in the GPs in general--I grew up with big block parties, and count my childhood neighbors among my closest friends in adulthood. no joneses for us--just minivans and a lot of afternoons at the woods park"

Yes, BMI is not wholly accurate but its a pretty freakin good rule of thumb. This is coming from a girl who has always danced along the line of unhealthy BMI due to high muscle mass from power lifting (I squat 250), ice hockey, field hockey, and track. As an all-state high school athlete who now at 22 still works out 5x a week, even though I know I am very fit and my weight isn't unhealthy, I know that BMI is fully accurate for most and laugh when girls my weight (btwn 150-160, 5'5'') who never exercise or lift say that well theyre the same weight as me so they must be healthy too"

New studies show the future devastating impact of hurricanes as they continue to reach further north. Nobody ever predicted a storm could do what Sandy did. As the oceans warm, hurricanes will move slower (ie spend more time over each place and leave much more rain and destruction) and continue to migrate up the coast. Obama can afford insurance, and I just wrote a thesis exploring the pricing model of home insurance in hurricane-prone areas. o summarize, I found that the rich will always be able to afford vulnerable property. the rest of the 85 percent of us will not be able to afford the skyrocketing premiums, plus the fact that no policies widely cover flood damage.
