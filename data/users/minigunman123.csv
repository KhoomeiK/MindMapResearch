I also don't think the racist things in America in the early 1900's were harmless, and I don't think you think that either. But they were still far from what the Nazis did/were doing, which is why I don't think America is a flawless paragon, we're definitely not hypocritical for hating Nazis, now or then. America never industrialized the destruction of ethnic groups solely because they were an ethnicity we didn't like, with no goal other than to kill them and wipe them out because we just hated them so hard. That's a pretty noteworthy and not universal thing that the Nazis had - it's existed before in history but it's not common. America's worst atrocities were almost all expressions of greed on the other hand, and people have owned and relocated and killed each other in greed for as long as we've existed.

FDR wanted to declare war on the Nazis because they were taking over all of Europe but also wanted a politically kosher way to get involved, this is why we waited for the Nazis to declare war on us, but once that occurred Americans were quite happy to go crush the genocidal maniacs.

It does not immediately follow that if ""God"" preceded the universe (as a sidenote, I contend that this, itself, is an incoherent statement to make, akin to saying ""I was the first fish, before water existed""), then everything in the universe is subject to his ""divine command."" You may believe this because the religious text of your choice says so, but it doesn't make sense as a syllogism.

Further, simply saying that the entire universe is subject to divine command and that the current divine command is XYZ, does not make it an inherent part of the thing commanded, that it is XYZ. It was *made to be XYZ by another being, therefore that is not inherent or intrinsic.* If it were inherent or intrinsic, it wouldn't need to be told by God, ""do this thing."" It would already be doing it. This is why most theologians that I've personally encountered do NOT believe that God is constantly maintaining the universe, but rather made the laws of nature so that the universe could exist, and only intervenes occasionally (which is where you get ""miracles""), so that things like humans and our natural behaviors towards sin can indeed be said to be an intrinsic part of our flawed nature, and why we need saving in the first place, according to the mythology."

That post itself is pretty much incoherent. Just to take a stab at the first sentence, ""My God is the only objective reality of the universe since he stands outside of it"" is immediately contradictory - if God is outside of the universe, then he is not part of the reality of the universe. He's either part of the reality of the universe (and then you could say he is ""the only objectively real thing"" if you wanted, though good luck defending that claim), or he's a separate thing and outside of the universe.

This person is just spouting fairly typical stuff for hyper-Christian types. If you try to analyze it logically/philosophically it will come up short, because these types of statements aren't based on solid philosophical reasoning, but just some half-baked strung-together defensive statements about how great their religion is. **This isn't to say religion is all dumb or bad.** But these kinds of statements are not really relevant to philosophy, in the same way someone rambling about prime numbers at the bar isn't really relevant to the study of mathematics - you can *try* to analyze their statements under that paradigm, but you'll mostly get nonsense out of them :)"
askphilosophy,fenvd3d,t3_eq57ba,1579291456.0,"This is basically the Euthyphro dilemma, outlined by Socrates in the dialogue *Euthyphro*.

If something is holy/righteous/good *because* it is loved by God/the gods, then it is not inherent, it is a result of their love, which is not a guarantee (even if you think it is, in this circumstance, we have to assume that a ""God"" would theoretically be able to revoke their approval of something regardless of one's own opinion, since it's them that has the ultimate cosmic power, not you).

If something is loved by God/the gods *because it is already holy/good/righteous*, then their love is not needed, the thing was/is good, righteous, or holy in and of itself, and their love is not part of the equation.

So either something is the way it is because God - a literal being, in most interpretations and understandings - says so, and you (or the universe) abides by their saying so, or it is that way inherently, and they're irrelevant to the whole process."

The extra cores slightly outperform the increase in IPC and clock speed from the 3600, for stuff like video editing and rendering, and both do very well in casual gaming, so long as you aren't trying to play the most demanding games on ultra at super high refresh rates (you'd want a better GPU than the 1660 Super to do that, anyway)"

askphilosophy,fehm45i,t3_ep4qg3,1579119327.0,"Whatever meaning or value you thought or continue to think life has or had, is unaffected by whether or not you believe that the meaning or value was the result of one of the flavors of ""free will,"" or biology. Either way, you have - or had - that value, and believed in that meaning. Your psychological health and wellbeing should not depend on the answer to this question.

If you think that a lack of free will means there's no meaning to life, and this depresses you profoundly, this is possibly not a philosophical issue - this is something to see a clinical psychologist about. Most philosophers who ponder things like free will are not made depressed by their findings. If you find yourself troubled, this is a health issue and not something that philosophers can help with."

personalfinance,fee9s4r,t1_fee7hm7,1579029335.0,"Typically, yes. In fact, it's a legitimate strategy to buy more stocks when the market is tanked. This is because the stocks will recover (assuming you're not investing in a company that might actually fail in the next couple years - always research the stocks you're going to purchase) and if you bought during the height of a recession, you've basically bought it on sale, and can hold onto it for years to watch it grow substantially after the market recovers."

What you mention here sounds more to me like investment - by the government, AKA the public, ideally - into STEM education for children and teenagers. Sure, that's a great thing. But the conversation earlier spoke of biohacking and expensive journals and making scientific endeavors more ""open,"" so it sounds like you're talking about something other than just investing in young child education.

So if you aren't talking about making labs and resources available to unqualified people, what exactly are you trying not to say?"

askphilosophy,fectesw,t1_fecfz1u,1578983898.0,"It's a fundamentally unreasonable expectation, however, that if it is not possible to make most fields of science cheaper and easier to get invested into these days (since so much of the basics are already discovered - you can't re-discover electricity or the wheel, after all), we should then make these expensive, laborious institutions and laboratories accessible to people who don't have proper training and education in how they work and what the field is studying or where it's gone.

Why would it be reasonable to expect that most - or even a large minority - of scientific labs be open to random guests without any screening for credentials or competence beforehand? That's just asking to have the lab be damaged and the time of real scientists who could be using it in the meantime be wasted."

I've already made about 5% return from being invested into a few stocks including Apple, in less than a single month (some of that is due to having stocks on margin, though - the return on the stocks individually is less than 5% in the previous month).

OP did say that he doesn't have time to learn how stocks work to be fair, but 6% is nothing compared to learning a bit about stocks and going into some of the safer ones like Microsoft or Apple.

But yes, being debt-free is also psychologically good - it's not a bad decision. But 6% return annually is actually pretty low, especially right now."
