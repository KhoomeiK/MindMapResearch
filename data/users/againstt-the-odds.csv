socialanxiety,fd7ywgk,t1_fd2efyy,1578211935.0,Oh trust me it was bad. Really bad. Probably one of my worst memories lol. It took me maybe 2 or 3 years to stop having it pop up in my mind randomly.
socialanxiety,fd02leq,t1_fcx2ta3,1578112713.0,"Ugh, so annoying. It throws you off."
socialanxiety,fd02hq4,t1_fcy81yl,1578112670.0,"YES! I think my anxiety distorts my perception of my voice. I think I am speaking fine but people can't hear me. I never know how the other people are hearing my voice, if I'm too loud or too quiet."
socialanxiety,fd025dr,t1_fcx89h4,1578112528.0,At least its over and one day you'll forget about it! I did this one presentation about 5 years ago that went horribly and afterwards it was so hard getting over it but now I barely think about it anymore! You'll forget it soon trust me.
socialanxiety,fd01ege,t1_fcwzgnm,1578112191.0,"So true, some jobs have no need for the workers to be loud and outgoing but they only want loud people."
socialanxiety,fczzywj,t1_fcx7uc1,1578111546.0,I know what you mean. Sometimes (rarely) being outgoing comes naturally depending on the social setting and other times I just know that its gonna be a disaster haha
socialanxiety,fcwiyg7,t3_ej0ige,1578026880.0,"I just wish that one day there'll be a job that wants someone who ""does the job quietly and doesn't waste time talking"". Lol."
socialanxiety,fcwi4zh,t1_fcwddxb,1578026242.0,How do you fake it? I have the hardest time acting outgoing and loud.
