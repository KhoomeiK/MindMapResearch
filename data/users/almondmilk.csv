SandersForPresident,ffbihaa,t1_ffbhome,1579766834.0,">It's not complicated. You're ignoring opportunity cost. They should have used this money to wipe student debt which would have had a far more stimulative effect than the gains (is this even inflation adjusted?).

How on earth am I ignoring opportunity cost when I never gave any opinion on the matter? My stating a fact has no bearing on whether or not I supported the events that led to it. 

Inflation adjusted? You can look at individual loans. The only one I looked at was JPMorgan Chase's, which was paid back inside of 8 months with a total of 6.9% increase to the US Govt in the form of dividends and warrants. But again, I'm making no argument for or against the return on investment, only stated that the money was repaid. 

>All of these banks should have crumbled. Is that not capitalism? Obviously we would need to replace their functions with idk an actual public bank that doesn't gamble your savings away with the presumption they will be bailed out.

Again, this response has nothing to do with anything I said. If you think it does, please show me what it's in response to."
SandersForPresident,ffbhamj,t1_ffbfkne,1579765265.0,">Not only that, but these banks were some of the worst actors in terms of causing the financial crisis in the first place. 

People should talk about that. I don't believe in pounding the desk and yelling; I believe in hammering home the facts. It bothers me that it seems people want to ignore or disregard certain facts when in reality there's plenty to focus on, like you've alluded to (and is touched on below). It bothers me that people imply that the money was a gift with no expectation of repayment. If you have to mislead, then your argument is weak. Even if you're right. 

>They took thousands of mortgages to people with poor credit, teaser rates, etc bundled them together and sold them as triple A rated mortgage bonds to anyone who would buy them (pension funds, other banks, insurance companies). They knew that these so called triple A or double A rated bonds were filled with garbage. But they also knew they were too big to fail. 

I agree with this to an extent. And I'll add at this point I think we're veering off from my initial statements and getting into a related discussion. Albeit short because it's late! Yes, they bundled mortgages in such a way to achieve what was perceived to be a diverse package and getting their Aaa rating. I even read they got ahold of the rating agency's formula to decide what qualifies at certain levels, giving them the ability to efficiently package garbage (also ignoring the privatization of the ratings agencies and their business practices). But the banks themselves kept many of these on their books; if they hadn't, they wouldn't have suffered such losses (not even getting into CDSs and CDOs here). Though yes, many were sold off as well. AIG ate these up. Namely, I believe, the credit default swaps."
