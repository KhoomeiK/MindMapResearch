books,feeyxqt,t1_feenfhw,1579044290.0,"Are you familiar with [Library Extension](https://www.libraryextension.com/?utm_source=extension_header&utm_campaign=installed_extension&utm_medium=web)? I have it for Chrome. Whenever I click on a title in Goodreads or Amazon, a little box opens up on the page to show its availability at my local library - book/text, e-book, audio -- with a link to the online catalog. I love it! Total gamechanger!"

aww,fcmt052,t1_fcm6d27,1577790805.0,"I did a search for ""yorkie rescues kitten"" and a couple of results came up. This particular link had the most info. In the video, the lady says, ""Be gentle, Hazel."" in a Southern accent, so, it seemed legit! I just had to know that the kitten was okay!"
aww,fclvbyc,t3_ehuh1m,1577757356.0,"[This is what I found](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3Z6zVjcxbY) looking for the backstory: The dog's name is Hazel and she lives in Abilene, TX. She was slow to come back from taking a wee in the pouring rain, and her owner was surprised to see Hazel returning with this kitten. The kitten was adopted by the lady's brother and is named Sheba. <333"
casualknitting,fcippw5,t1_fchop64,1577666892.0,"I'm not fond of Magic Loop either so I knit TAAT on two long circulars. I think it's the same progression, going counterclockwise from bottom right: Sock A, Sock B on needle 1 \*turn\* Sock B, Sock A on needle 2. Because I don't pay attention I like to use circulars that have different cords, like a red chiao-goo and an addi, so that I don't get the needles mixed up. Total gamechanger!"
