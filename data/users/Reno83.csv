My GF was a lifeguard as a teenager in the Midwest and the only interactions she had with Mexicans were children running around in their *chones* at the pool.

Demos are great bikes. I remember in the late 2000's, before the widespread popularity of ""enduro"" bikes, when ""freeride"" was the buzzword at the bike shop. They were short lived, but, at one point, Demos came with a 180mm Totem option instead of a 200mm Fox 40 or World Cup. I have a 2008 Giant glory with 180mm single crown and, before that, a Demo 9 with a Fox 40. 

For their weight, Demos are surprisingly good climbers, won't be the fastest, but I never encountered a hill I didn't want to try (dual chainring with granny). The biggest issue was keeping the nose down. I raced collegiately too and always did well on the downhill courses, but embarrassed myself on slolem (not very nimble on switchbacks). If you're going to use it mostly on DH, I would recommend a triple crown, it will plow through anything. Also, it will slacken your HA by a degree or two, which is my main gripe with my single crown Glory (67-degree HA)."

Were all Nazis antisemitic and racist? No, but they supported a leader bent on destroying Jews. In both cases, you have followers that may not buy into 100% of the shit their leaders are peddling, but are at worst accomplices and at best complicit to the atrocities. Nazis are a better example, since, unlike Confederate rebels (some of which were just good people fending off an invasion), there is a stigma attached to their beliefs. 

Imagine your great grandfather was a Nazi soldier. He didn't know about the concentration camps and he wore his uniform proudly. Defeated by the Allied Forces, he is forced to take his uniform off. He then learns about what Hitler was doing and he is so ashamed that he puts his uniform in a trunk in the attic never to see the light of day. 50 years after the war, he dies and his children divy up his estate. Amongst the belongings is a box labelled ""military memorabilia,"" which his son saves and stows it in his attic without opening it. Present day, the Grandfather dies and his children and grandchildren divy up his belongings. The old Nazi soldier never told his side of the story to anyone because he was too ashamed, so there's no context to the articles inside that box. The box is opened. What is everyone to make of it?

As we can see with religion, when people don't understand and they choose to remain ignorant, a little stupidity goes a long way. To be clear, I'm not saying you need a degree, but lack of value of education can lead to close-mindedness. 

2. The inconvenience or personal expenses incurred by climate change efforts, be it laws or taxes, turns a lot of people away. This is due to a lack of long-term vision and not thinking about the greater good. There's even people who don't deny climate change and even understand it, but don't feel like their individual contribution makes a difference.

3. People in developing countries or even people in developed countries who have no choice. It's easy for me to say ""save the rainforest,"" but I doubt the poor farmer clear cutting his patch of rainforest in Brazil has that luxury, he has to eat. 

To be honest, the ones that piss me off are those who know better, but have something to gain by promoting ignorance. Or the ones who cherry pick what part of science to believe.

Personally, I would go for the **Nuclear** option. You'll be sent to Navy Power School which is an additional year of training. Then, after training, you'll be sent to teach, to a submarine, to a carrier, or, like the guy I met, to Naval Post-Graduate School (NPS) in Monterrey to conduct research.

The next option is **Public works**. I interned at a Navy base when I was in college, so I met a lot of engineers going this route. Basically, they make you into a Civil Engineer and you work with the Seabee Battalions. I'm sure they also deploy, but the rest of the time it's just an office job. Most were able to get their PE.

Then, there's **Staff** positions. You're basically a warm body filling in a position. I was an electronics technician in the Navy and my first division officer was a EE, but he never did any engineering work, just personnel management. He was actually managing the air terminal (small C12 airport) and not just our electronics shop. My division officer on the ship, who was in charge of all the comms and navigation, was a physics major. Once again, he was just there for personnel management.

There are other forms of media out there that are more appropriate for other people's brains to digest information or entertain themselves with. Now, somethings you have to be able to read and comprehend, but why would I spend days reading Harry Potter when I'm an audio/visual learner and find the movie (series) much more rewarding. I know, I know, ""the book is way better."" Personally, I prefer to binge Netflix than read, I do enough reading for work."
AskEngineers,fdij8ro,t3_eljxlx,1578444143.0,"The entry-level job market, especially for mechanicals (the most popular engineering major), is rough. Depending on geography and industry, the competition is insane. Personally, I graduated with 3 internships under my belt and a hair above 3.0, and it took me 50+ applications over 6 months to land a position in aerospace in SoCal (3 major universities within a 20-mile radius). 

How many applications have you submitted?

Don't give up! I landed my last internship 2 months before graduating and I stayed on board 4 months after graduation. It wasn't great pay, but it paid better than a minimum wage job and it took some of the urgency off of the job seeking. Life is a lot less stressful when you can make rent. This even allowed me to be somewhat picky about what I accepted. I was making $20/hr and I turned down positions paying $10-15/hr more because they weren't the right fit. Also, in case you're targeting aerospace/defense or some other state/federal positions, hiring slows down at the end of the year and picks up at the beginning when the new budget is approved."

Not to say that they didn't voluntarily join the military or necessarily know what they were getting involved in, but, once in, they were obligated to follow orders or suffer punitive consequences, to include imprisonment or death. The Border Patrol, on the other hand, is voluntarily. They can quit like any other job. The truth is plain and simple, their paychecks are more important to them than the lives they're ruining."

RandomThoughts,fcuu5z3,t3_ej0j4p,1577988564.0,"In the US, it has to do with a variety of social and legal considerations. Biologically, 18 is an arbitrary number, as adolescence continues well into early 20s. However, in my opinion, the advantage of lowering the age of adulthood is that there is an increased number of potential military recruits, more  tax contributors, parents are able to free up resources earlier (18-year commitment vs 21-year or 25-year commitment), and it decreases unrest by giving young people a voice in politics. The disadvantage of lowering the age of adulthood is that 18-year-olds aren't always mature enough to be on their own, there's still a lot of maturing to do."

AskEngineers,fc9oosp,t3_egr7tt,1577555864.0,"I started out as an electronics technician in the Navy and now I'm a mechanical engineer. Working in aerospace and defense, a lot of the technicians and mechanics I work with are fellow veterans. The technicain/engineer division I see now is very similar to the enlisted/officer dichotomy I saw in the military. To me it just seems like people's way of justifying their choices. A similar thing I've heard people say is, ""I could get a degree too, *if i wanted to*."" 

In my opinion, this stems from a misplaced belief that there is a division of ideas based on level of education, most likely based on bad interactions. What I see with a lot of young, inexperienced engineers, like I saw with many young, inexperienced officers, is that they expect respect and fail to develop that rapport. There are a lot of things engineers do in the design process that may not be obvious on the floor and, vice versa, there are many aspects of the design that work in theory but not in practice. The key is proper, respectful communication."

AskEngineers,fc6id3k,t3_egb6g8,1577481283.0,"I've had a mix bag of presentation experiences. 

As an undergrad, Q&A always seemed like a good opportunity for fellow students to knock you down a peg and downplay your achievements in an attempt to both sound smart in front of the class and to make their work comparatively better. As for professors, they're always holding everyone's feet to the fire for the sake of academic rigor.

As an intern, expected to function in an intern capacity, the engineers were always nice and, though there was blunt criticism at times, they kept it positive in order to encourage my development as a presenter and an engineer.

As an intern, expected to function in a ""big boy"" capacity, the researchers and scientists would try to poke holes in my research. This may have been a unique experience though. I conducted research for an engineer who was  constantly competing for funds with other researchers with the Office of Naval Research. Every year, at a conference room full of 10+ PhDs and their assistants, we presented our findings to the head honcho to convince him the research deserved more funding. PhDs competing for funds can get pretty nasty (I wasn't a graduate student, just an undergrad).

As an engineer presenting my projects for peer reviews, other engineers are blunt, but productive. There's no value added when making negative or counterproductive comments. Everyone in the room has a common goal to get the work done, so everyone in the room is invested in your work and ultimately rooting for your success. As an engineer, your success is the group's success, so people will go out of their way to lend a hand if you're deficient."
