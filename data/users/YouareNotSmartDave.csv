insomnia,ffdhfda,t3_esvvs9,1579820929.0,"I was on it for at least 2 years and was fine. The problem is that it is used to treat neurological pain so when you come off it you'll feel very disoriented. It did help me sleep, and I did manage to get off of it. I pray you get the sleep that is your natural right."

ForeverAlone,fcuup55,t3_ej0h59,1577988897.0,"***Maybe*** you are just not as selfish as most other people and that is why you are so lonely. A lot of people who always get the attention they want are just really good at getting it and don't have the moral sense that lonely people have and that makes them better at manipulating others so they can get all of the warmth and love. I'm really awful alone myself and I sometimes think that it's because it just never occurs to me to use people for attention... if I was more selfish and less moral I'd have friends and lovers etc.,."

I was killed during my early 20's, then I brought myself back to life, lived for 10 years during my 30's, then the people who killed me during my early 20's found me out again and drove it all back in real extra deep and its been 11-12 years since I've been a person with a mind who could feel happiness and be creative with life etc.,."

depression,fc32ypp,t3_efqogm,1577380227.0,"When I was homeless and unemployed I went and volunteered. It will give you something to do, put you in touch with people and resources, and give you the sense that you are contributing to society. Thrift stores and soup kitchens are always in need of volunteers and those people usually also know where the jobs are. But that was a long time ago things might be different nowadays."

AskReddit,fbyem3t,t3_ef21pu,1577214961.0,I found Reddit to be quite illuminating. My only social media outlet was Facebook and being on Reddit opened my eyes. It seems to me that Facebook depicts the world within a delusional context of leftist propaganda mixed in with corporate advertising and posts from beautiful people with wonderful lives showing off how great their lives are while on Reddit you get a clearer picture of what is really going on out there. Since Reddit keeps your identity relatively concealed people are A LOT more visceral and raw with what is going on in their lives.  Not to mention all the science and history that Reddit provides that you will not get on Facebook... Reddit really kicks Facebook's ass when it comes to obtaining information about the world we live in today.
