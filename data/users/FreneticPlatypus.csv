pics,ffhs7ol,t1_ffho9c1,1579951180.0,"My point is that if a bullet is best, why don’t we all just eat a bullet? Everyone’s going to die eventually, you, me, that lion. Why do we think the lion is somehow “lucky” because it gets off easy? People suffer long drawn out diseases in extreme discomfort so why not blow their brains out and prevent all that suffering? It’s *humane* after all.   

We don’t do that because *our lives* are sacred and every single minute of *our lives* are important. We want to live as much as we possibly can before dying and most would rather face worse death if it means getting another ten years of life. The lion in that picture doesn’t look old or emaciated or diseased and may have had another ten good years of life in him. 

Animals have been eaten by other animals since there have been animals and while of course I wouldn’t want to face that type of end, I don’t think that convincing ourselves that we know best how this lion would like to go out is just an excuse to kill something that doesn’t need to die just yet all for our own entertainment. If you knew that there was a good chance that you were going to get a horrible form of cancer and suffer a long painful death much later in life, would you rather someone, at some point twenty years before, out of the blue with no warning, just sneak up on you and put a bullet in your head?    

I just disagree with hunting all together, most of all this type of hunting. The lion didn’t need to die just then. It’s a conscious being and even though it can’t express these things, it has a will to survive that we are just ignoring. No one gives a shit about how the lion would “rather” leave this world, we just want to pretend that we’re strong and destroy something for the fun of it.
