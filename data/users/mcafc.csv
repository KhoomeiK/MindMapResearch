I haven't tripped in over a year, but would like to start doing it again some time in my life when I have more time for pure contemplation. Overall though, I think it's just doing what people have been doing for centuries...But I can't say for sure! There has been no time I've been more convinced of the existence of some God/spiritual force than when I was on acid. At least they have made me treat things like beauty, goodness, and truth more seriously than the typical post-moder, Nihilist world view."
religion,feeiayi,t1_feehc50,1579034320.0,"YEah, lol, have you tripped LSD? I'm asking because I had similar thoughts after doing that. In my opinion, LSD is simply a type of religious experience, so it's not necessary to do it to get these kind of thoughts, but they encourage the hell out of it. This is related to my idea that stress/anxiety causes people to posit ""god solutions"" to problems in their life/the world.

  
I used to be big into research on resonance and vibrations. The idea that you could speed up plant growth via vibration/electricity was huge to me, I was obsessed for a while. I also believed, like you, that this could be used to heal humans. If you create a proper resonance with the human's ""natural frequency"" you heal them, this has been shown actually through some modern research on the spine.

Reginald Fessenden was the inventor credited with sending audio across the Atlantic Ocean through radio waves. He had an idea highly related to this(using a Tesla coil!) to grow plants faster following this logic:   [https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/66/6b/86/5dbe2acbbce040/US1268949.pdf](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/66/6b/86/5dbe2acbbce040/US1268949.pdf) 

Ultimately, forming your own 'religion' that makes references to science is interesting, but you are just doing the same thing people have done for millions of years. I think you are on some very interesting ideas, but to form a sort of ""new religion"" from these ideas just plays deeper into my argument that this is a human tendency, to make up religious, spiritual explanations to explain science to people who don't fully understand it."
religion,feegudv,t1_feegk5d,1579033478.0,"I'm just going off my comparative religions class from school, but from what I was taught, an atheist is someone who will defend the idea that God is not real, whereas an agnostic doesn't know either way. You might be right though! I see your reasoning that the opposite of ""theist"" just seems to be 'lack of belief' rather than 'someone who will argue against God'. Still though, there seems to be some separation here, the nuance, in common parlance at least, seems to be picked up by the atheist vs agnostic thing."
religion,feefy1q,t1_feefa3b,1579032955.0,"This is interesting. I arrived at similar conclusions in college(When I was also surrounded by many people who were much smarter than I, reading Kierkegaard and such). I arrived at a sort of ""pantheist"" conclusion(the idea that basic substance is God, or the Universe itself is God). I also had many ideas of how the big bang, the cyclical nature of entropy, etc. all played into this idea.

But at the end of the day, I think that is just \*our version\* of religion, it works for us.

Also, I fully agree with you about the idea that the reason to become religious is to become a better person. I always feel so much better when I am in a connected, religious mood. But my good feeling gets undermined by skepticism. I was raised by a very smart, PhD psychologist who is a hard-line atheist and basically says that Religous beliefs are delusions that have ""Been given a pass by society"" because they are largely harmless. They are an outlet for delusional beliefs when we are anxious about the overwhelming complexity of the world. Still, I can't deny the fact that most real Christians I know are some of the best, most loving people I have met...so it works in some way."
religion,feef3jj,t1_feeeywm,1579032456.0,"I would say it is possible, this is why I don't consider myself a full atheist. I think the doucmented tendency of the human mind to create these explanations is something to be sympathetic toward, because I do it myself to some extent.. Ultimately I know nothing of the ultimate reality, but I also do not have ""faith"" in any religious idea."
religion,fee9vno,t1_fee8k50,1579029394.0,"I agree with this, but it still seems like people are rationalizing belief in God in odd ways. Then they moralize with their concepts of God, even though we can't prove them. Which leads to even deeper issues."

If you think beautiful art is not so, you are wrong and lack taste.
