GERD,ffh7j15,t3_etfifl,1579925317.0,Anyone have any knowledge of age of onset of gerd and cancer risk? I remember reading a study saying the younger the person started having gerd the higher the risk and is they started having it in their teens or early 20s the risk was Mich higher
LadyBoners,fff2al7,t1_ffdo37t,1579873764.0,I would get behind that marketing scheme. Make more shows with sexy hot men like this (maybe even staring the same guy!) to increase Netflix membership
notliketheothergirls,ffdu6j8,t1_ffdppoo,1579829018.0,No your right. Bosses shouldn’t fuck their employees just like teachers shouldn’t fuck their 18 year old students even if the student flirts with them first.

GERD,ffd8pms,t1_ffd735d,1579815609.0,No It’s actually what prompted me to go to a gastroenterologist for the first time and get an endoscopy... well I shouldn’t say no.

Futurology,ff78um7,t1_ff72okq,1579643410.0,Oh geez. I still stand by the fact that China consumes so much pork though. Pigs are one of the best vectors for diseases that are able to transfer to humans
Futurology,ff6o0fm,t1_ff5yrtp,1579631273.0,China has notoriously bad animal husbandry problems. Pig gets sick just kill and dump in the river. Disease spreads. Also China eats a lot of pigs which are great vectors for zoonotic diseases and I could be wrong but I don’t think India eats nearly as much pork.

unpopularopinion,fe9waxn,t1_fe7ll8m,1578942010.0,Yeah this reads to me like the rich parent should get the kid in a divorce. It should always be 50/50 as much as possible.

Unfortunately your daughter still suffered from the divorce. A lot of people promote divorce thinking it’s better for the kids, and in many cases it is better for the parents to divorce than the kids to live in an unhappy home, but it still has a negative impact on a kid and leaves wounds that need to be healed"
