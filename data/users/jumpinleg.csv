Documentaries,ff9s9s3,t3_esffwv,1579720107.0,"I strongly disagree with the doctor’s characterization of antidepressants as a crutch. There are several medications (insulin, statins, etc) that people take a maintenance dose on. While I agree these aren’t medications for everyone and oftentimes the doctors downplay the side effects, sometimes people are just sad. No rhyme or reason, no root cause. Please don’t stigmatize these (in some cases, life-saving) medications even more than they already are."
