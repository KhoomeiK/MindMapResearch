AskReddit,ffdnzrx,t1_ffd98zo,1579824939.0,"This reminds me of a character idea my friend had. He was a dwarf named Thumor Greataxe, a dwarf who is in love with his axe (named Betsy). He cut off a part of his beard and attached to his axe because dwarf women are supposed to have bigger beards than their husbands. He is on a quest to find the one who forged Betsy to get his approval for their marriage."
