MarinelordGG,enuvi1,top_level,"I just needed to tell anyone, I feel like I finally got my shit together for the first time in a long time.

Edit: holy sh, this thread blew up ! Didn't expect that. I can't respond to everyone but thanks a lot for your support guys ! I had a cool day at work today and some of your comments were really awesome, thanks a lot ! I'll keep on doing me-stuff and having me-time as much as I can, starting today. And thanks for the 2 medals lol"
liquid42,fe5h20s,t3_enuvi1,Awesome! It‚Äôs the small victories that make a big difference.
xStillSane,fe5hf2a,t3_enuvi1,"That's genuinely great! Good job, OP! Hope more days like that come for youüå∏"
Montanasloane,fe5itub,t3_enuvi1,"Yes! It‚Äôs the small steps done consistently that lead to big changes. Well done! üëèüèº
It may not seem like much but it really is; because anxiety is so much about memories and when we have memories of being panicked and feeling incapable of just going to the grocery store, it will prevent us from trying. But when you‚Äôve done it, you now have the memory of succeeding. And you will again. It‚Äôs all about repetition and celebrating the ‚Äòsmall‚Äô victories."
MarinelordGG,fe9va36,t1_fe5itub,"I completely agree, anxiety and depression really ate my life and some days I barely get out of bed ( if I am not working of course, wich I do a lot thankfully. ) these weeks. Doing something constructive and spoiling me a good burger is in fact real good moments I should turn into a habit ! Thanks for the support."
Coins2007,fe5zr7f,t3_enuvi1,"Well done! (You, not the burger.)"
Hungry-san,fe63ngg,t1_fe5zr7f,Something wrong with well-done burgers mate? Them's fightin' wurds.
MarinelordGG,fe9vn0c,t1_fe5zr7f,"Lol, I actually like my minced beef well done at the opposite of real steak !"
livebebrave,fe9obg3,t1_fe63ngg,haha!
ObviouslyOstrich,fe62gyi,t3_enuvi1,"Hell yeah man that sounds like a good meal! I just got an air fryer/grill and my girlfriend and I have been making all sorts of stuff in it. I wanna figure out how to make homemade waffle fries now! 

I find that cooking and/or cleaning gives me something to do when I am tripping out a bit, definitely lets me feel productive and that‚Äôs always good."
mariio480,fe62o41,t1_fe62gyi,Dude I need to get me one of them thingys!! I've seen people make some killer wings in the air fryer. All kinds of goodies. And OP Iam so happy for you!! Consistently making progress is a beautiful thing.
MarinelordGG,fe9vusd,t1_fe62gyi,Jeez I really should get something like that ! Thankfully I have an oven that's pretty okay too for cooking simple stuff. But I find myself eating a lot of oven-ready crap.
ObviouslyOstrich,fe63y7s,t1_fe62o41,"The ninja 5 in 1 has a grill too and it‚Äôs FREAKING AWESOME. I‚Äôd definitely recommend it. I can make great burgers indoors in 15 minutes. Prep cooking cleanup and all! Saved me money from eating out. That‚Äôs for sure. 

For the wings I will toss them in baking powder and slap your momma seasoning and put them in there for 25 minutes, spraying with some canola oil a few times throughout and flipping halfway and I‚Äôll put fries in the oven while they‚Äôre frying. Then I toss in the hottest sauce I have. It comes out really crispy."
zachattacksyou,fe5x58s,t3_enuvi1,Awesome possum!
shookpikachu,fe65xsb,t1_fe5x58s,Haven't heard someone say that in awhile haha
MarinelordGG,fe9vykx,t1_fe5x58s,"that made me smile, thanks !"
feelingxindigo,fe5xf50,t3_enuvi1,"The fact that you noticed this, too, is a victory in itself!! Very happy for you OP."
tarakancz,fe60hu4,t3_enuvi1,I feel you hardcore! I get panic attacks almost every time I go to any store or public place. It's a fucking burden dude. I am so happy for you though! I'm going to try and clean tomorrow and grocery shop - wish me luck!
Cappucinno-Catt,fe65qh9,t1_fe60hu4,good luck man! I believe in you !!!
MarinelordGG,fe9w86g,t1_fe60hu4,I believe in you dude. I understand how hard it can be for us to even do stupid stuff like buying meat and a salad but at the end the only one you are punishing is yourself. Don't care about anything else than your groceries and the meal you are going to cook for yourself ! :)
tarakancz,fe66iq0,t1_fe65qh9,thank you!
tarakancz,fea8w9z,t1_fe9w86g,"I haven't worked up the courage to go grocery shopping. I am trying, but I did get some cleaning done today, so I feel somewhat productive. I have a job interview tomorrow that I'm freaking out about. I don't know what to wear/if I have anything to wear. I suck at interviews as well. Thank you for the encouraging words though :)"
MarinelordGG,feaow84,t1_fea8w9z,"It‚Äôs okay friend, I am sure you will do well! Stay calm, don‚Äôt panic you got this! And it‚Äôs okay if you didn‚Äôt go shopping, you will do it when you will feel like to. It‚Äôs okay is the magic word"

Ashkenazicc,fe5zns4,t3_enuvi1,"congratulations, nicely done! wish i could do the same! sadly i can't drive :("
MarinelordGG,fe9wk8f,t1_fe5zns4,Is there any bus you could take to go to any grocery store ?
Ashkenazicc,feaeam8,t1_fe9wk8f,"Nope no one will help me, or my mother. We're kinda stuck In the middle of nowhere, and can only really get out like once or twice a month too get groceries."
Sauerkraut_McGee,fe5zstx,t3_enuvi1,Badass!

cross_out92,fe64i7w,t3_enuvi1,"Same for me today! We're having unseasonably pleasant weather this weekend and that definitely spurred my exit from months of gloom. Now if I can just keep this up when it's painful to step outside again, I'll be doing well üôÉ"

hamfisted_postman,fe6gicc,t3_enuvi1,"Yeah! That's awesome!

 I'm feeling good too. I'm starting a CBT class tomorrow and I can snowshoe along the frozen river from my house to my appointment. It looks like it's going to be 14 degrees and snowing. It will be a fun way to distract my mind before I have to act normal in a group of strangers."
MarinelordGG,fe9yzj2,t1_fe6gicc,Have fun doing it friend ! Thanks for the support and hugs to you.
hamfisted_postman,feciulm,t1_fe9yzj2,I hit a lot of slush. I should have probably stayed off the river until it gets colder

Basic_NOVA_bitcH,fe6cf9y,t3_enuvi1,Keep it up!
veryexpensivefood,fe6d5et,t3_enuvi1,That's huge. I know I avoid the grocery store because it's a huge stressful place but cooking is a huge stress reliving activity for me.
MarinelordGG,fe9z2j1,t1_fe6d5et,Then the groceries will be worth doing if you have so much fun cooking !!!

lfr6,feaa15o,t3_enuvi1,"I'm happy for you, I love it when I get the feeling of relief after then anxiety goes away"
isweedglutenfree,em0e7a,top_level,Whoever needs this reminder :) I usually do
SalmonBarn,fdlmv68,t3_em0e7a,"Luckily my anxiety has kept me from going to the dentist for years and enabled horrible hygiene so if I clench it hurts. 

Did I win..?"
swmill08,fdlsbgl,t1_fdlmv68,"If it makes you feel better, I went for the first time a year ago in what had been 15+ years, and I‚Äôm so thankful I did. They are kind and understanding. I made it out to be so much worse than it was. Biggest thing was 2 cavities. You‚Äôll feel so much better even booking an appointment. Hope this helps!"
IHearYouLimaCharlie,fdm3wjd,t1_fdlmv68,"I didn't go for 20 years and it ended up being a really bad thing. However, there are dentists who do sedation dentistry and even can put you to sleep for it! I had a lot of reconstructive surgery this way. Hope this helps if you get dental anxiety!"
Daycar90,fdmfm9b,t1_fdlmv68,I‚Äôve yet to find any of these kind/understanding dentists. Anytime I‚Äôve worked up the nerve (or had so much dental pain I was forced) to finally go I‚Äôm met with dentists who dive right in to basically chastising me for how long it‚Äôs been since I‚Äôve seen a dentist and listing the extensive work I need done so I usually end up leaving the consult and never returning.
cmVkZGl0,fdmnq7x,t1_fdlmv68,"Find somebody who does sedation dentistry in your area. Also, close your eyes when they start.

I'm two daced when it comes to dental work. I get so nervous I'd rather be sacrificed to the devil instead but then when I'm in the chair I'm a model citizen and ready to endure whatever."
LitherLily,fdlxand,t1_fdlsbgl,"Absolutely, I was expecting so much judgement and they were very kind and also straightforward about anti anxiety methods they can provide! There‚Äôs so many more options these days."
mrs_cto,fdm9nor,t1_fdlsbgl,"Yeah I haven't been to the dentist in a couple years because last time I went I think they said I had a cavity forming. And fuck that. I'm not getting another filling. The last filling I had was a few years ago and it did not go well. My husband had to leave work to come be with me I was panicking so bad in the middle of it. And because of that I didn't let him bring me later to get my wisdom teeth taken out. My mom took me. I couldn't handle the humiliation of him seeing me fall apart. Which I very much did at the oral surgeon (which is another story entirely). 

But I'm glad to say my teeth are fine. I brush them every day and there's no new sensitivity or what not."
Acerakis,fdmtl1e,t1_fdlsbgl,Had a similar experience recently.
SalmonBarn,fdmfgxq,t1_fdm3wjd,"See, this is what I want and need. I‚Äôm for sure going to need a root canal and a number of fillings. I absolutely would love to get it done in a couple sessions just completely under. Because that may be the only way I can handle it."
AffectionateGiraffe9,fdnn33g,t1_fdm9nor,"Whenever I get fillings done they always give me this gas that helps calm me down. I always listen to headphones as well, and that helps!"
cmVkZGl0,fdmntpe,t1_fdm9nor,Maybe you can look into solea laser fillings if you ever need another one. They're more expensive and a drill is still required but not to the extent of a regular cavity. Personally I think the smell of it literally disturbing though.
cmVkZGl0,fdmo0hq,t1_fdmfgxq,"Completely under is more than just sedation dentistry though. I went looking for the same thing and found out the harsh reality. It's very uncommon and it's real expensive too. Just want to clear that up because these are two different things. 

If you want full sedation, you're going to need probably an oral surgeon or anesthesiologist brought in which is separate from the person who does most of your work in the first place, even if they are trained. In my case, coordinating all the different people required was the biggest obstacle and unrealistic.

Sedation dentistry will just use either pills, gas, or even an IV, but they won't have you go under. You get so doped up that you need somebody to bring you there and back so you might be able to endure it with just that alone. Another reason why it can work is because it messes with your ability to form memories of the moment while it happens and your ability to recall them so you don't have the same kind of physical emotional response because you can't really grasp onto the event in the first place. It really works even if you think it may not. You can also ask them for a trial of the different pills you're going to be taking so you can see how you'll respond instead of being surprised on the day of."
IHearYouLimaCharlie,fdmvs1l,t1_fdmo0hq,"100% this, excellent explanation. I have had both, I've been under general anesthesia which is expensive and took place in a hospital but also I had bone grafts done too, so it was a lot more than root canals. I had success with the twilight sedation explained above where I'm doped up and don't have memories of the situation for lots of stuff."
lonelymoon212,fdlqj0g,t3_em0e7a,I need this to be a once an hour phone notification.  Lol. Literally have jaw problems from it
Kuhncumber,fdn8pqa,t1_fdlqj0g,"I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs an app out there that lets you set recurring reminders, if that‚Äôs all you need to get better definitely take the time to look into it"
Unnamed-Visitor,fdlirz3,t3_em0e7a,Relax your shoulders and move your tongue off the roof of your mouth.
jordan_todd123,fdlo2uu,t1_fdlirz3,Isnt that correct tongue posture?
Asterboy17,fdlxq36,t1_fdlirz3,NONONONONO the tongue it supposed to rest there. It's called tongue posture
Loveforsale,fdmepsm,t1_fdlirz3,I've pushed my teeth out of alignment because of anxiety. I try to be aware of my tongue placement at all times which I obsess over. Fml
RickZanches,fdm11r1,t1_fdlirz3,Damn this whole thread caught me.
Unnamed-Visitor,fdlo6im,t1_fdlo2uu,"Your tongue should naturally rest just off the roof of your mouth, but due to stress, most people will press their tongues to the roof of their mouth."
brashboy,fdn4m6z,t1_fdlo2uu,Ah fuck now I gotta worry about tongue posture lol
CambriaDeschain,fdm5v8i,t1_fdlxq36,"In speech therapy, when I was a kid, she told me to rest my tongue on the roof of my mouth. It helped tremendously with my speech, but idk if it has any effect on anxiety/mood?"
Unnamed-Visitor,fdlxvql,t1_fdlxq36,"If your jaw is closed, then it will, but jaw muscles naturally rest open, and the tongue relaxes off the roof of the mouth."
Unnamed-Visitor,fdmerna,t1_fdmepsm,Calmly breathe. A slow pace to your breathing does wonders for onset stress.
tu-BROOKE-ulosis,fdmgm0j,t1_fdmepsm,Oh I‚Äôm starting  to do this! Any tips?? Mines obsessively pushing my lower teeth. I cannot figure out how to stop. It‚Äôs agony.
ComplimentLauncher,fdmnf7h,t1_fdmepsm,This has happened to me as well. Is it your innermost lower teeth bent inwards toward the tongue?
redbonnetblue,fdlptkv,t1_fdlo6im,I've never noticed that I do this! But I totally do.. and I'm always clenching my jaw. Thank you!! I'll try to be more aware.
manifestsilence,fdmbjgb,t1_fdlo6im,"Is orthotopics bs? It has that smell to it but was the only advice I'd found on the subject:
https://the-great-work.org/guide-to-proper-tongue-posture-mewing/

Edit: to partly answer my own question, yes and no:
https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentistry/comments/2zpaiu/is_orthotropics_quackery/
What I get from this is its effectiveness is dubious after age 9, but maybe the tongue posture thing has merit.

So I'm still going to obsess over whether my tongue is supposed to be on or off the roof of my mouth and not know..."
-throwaway-thanks-,fdlt1sl,t1_fdlo6im,WOW i did not know this‚Ä¶ mine is never naturally resting
Loveforsale,fdmjd3n,t1_fdmgm0j,"Honestly, I wish I could give you solid advice but I can't. I just had to be more self aware and move my tongue to the correct place every few minutes. I did get put on antidepressants and that did help lessen the tension but not completely."
Zedjones,fdnfhs9,t1_fdmgm0j,"Cognitive behavioral therapy might help, along with trying something like mindfulness meditation just so you're more mindful of when you're doing it."
Loveforsale,fdorc1h,t1_fdmnf7h,"I push my top front teeth forward. I started noticing when I would try and eat something and my food slipped through my teeth.  Also, my bottom teeth are no longer centered but I think my jaw is crooked somehow."
Unnamed-Visitor,fdmbw35,t1_fdmbjgb,"There are two positions that occur naturally for the tongue, and they depend on your jaw position. If closed, your tongue will press itself against the roof of your mouth. If opened about halfway (which naturally occurs if there is no outer force preventing it such as unconsciously closing it) then the tongue will rest only the edges of itself on the roof, creating a sort of air bubble in the middle of it. When you're talking, your tongue shouldn't touch the roof of your mouth by anything except the front end for annunciation of words."
Unnamed-Visitor,fdlt42o,t1_fdlt1sl,For most people it only rests when they're asleep. This is in part because it can't naturally rest if you close your jaw.
ComplimentLauncher,fdpw0zz,t1_fdorc1h,"ah i see, they told me that if i wasn't in pain then it's better to leave it alone. Don't know about you though.

Ps: I take three love thank you very much"
manifestsilence,fdmcb02,t1_fdmbw35,Thank you! That helps a lot
JillStinkEye,fdmdm32,t1_fdmbw35,Thank you!! Ever since hearing this tip years ago I've had anxiety about where my tongue should be! It feels weird and harder to breathe if it's not resting (not pressing) on the roof of my mouth.

angelathefirefly,fdllkei,t3_em0e7a,I honestly think that I need a professional massage because of how much my muscles hurt from the tension that my panic disorder causes me to have.
isweedglutenfree,fdlmgrz,t1_fdllkei,"If I don‚Äôt go regularly, I get terrible aches that take over a week to subside. I‚Äôve started going to a cheap foot spa every other week and it‚Äôs helped tremendously."
angelathefirefly,fdlqaj2,t1_fdlmgrz,"Really?! I also have terrible headaches and migraines. I wonder if I shouldn‚Äôt try massages (once I can actually leave my house again. Thanks, anxiety.)."
isweedglutenfree,fdlqsne,t1_fdlqaj2,Think about how much strained muscles play a part in that. I‚Äôm sure it would only help. It‚Äôs also something exciting to look forward to and I don‚Äôt have to get ready for it bc I take my clothes off and lie face down for an hour in a dark room so people aren‚Äôt going to be looking at me. Then I hop in the car and go straight back home. This made it easier for me to leave the house for a massage as opposed to leaving for any other reason.
thisisit06,fdlqkn6,t3_em0e7a,I needed this. If anyone else clenches or grinds regularly try and catch yourself. TMJ is horrible :(

The more I try to relax my jaw,  the tenser everything around it becomes, seemingly involuntarily. Am I the only one? Its like theres a reflex that prevents my mouth from hanging open. Even when i have managed to temporarily override this reflex and have allowed my mouth to hang wide open to the point where my tongue is so dry its hard and yet, at the same time,  Im drooling, the muscles in my face eventually contact to close it back up again, and i don't feel any better.

PoSchodoch,fdm5ydf,t3_em0e7a,"I thought my jaw tension / teeth grinding was due to anxiety. In the end it was wisdom teeth whoch caused misalignment and electrolyte/vitamin deficiency. I noticed the past 2 weeks that most of my anxiety is caused by physical sensations, for example, my jaw and shoulders getting v tight or getting fucking head spasms because of these deficiencies. 

I was slowly starting to consider i got fucking ms or something but I was just eating like shit l, hated salt and was constantly flushing my body with water and liters of beer every single day for 3 years. 

All this shit made me demotivated as fuck, initiating things took ridiculous amounts of energy. I just thought it was depression/anxiety. 

I never took into account that i could have deficiencies living in a western country. That and daily prescribed stims and shittons of drugs didn‚Äôt help. 

Sorry for my rant/blog post guys, I‚Äôm just so fucking happy I finally found something that actually works (and there‚Äôs still some dexamp pumping around)

Hope you guys find a piece of this shitty puzzle too."

Do this just once or twice to release the tension when you think of it and it'll change your life. 

I went from wearing a dental splint nightly to prevent clenching and painful TMJ to just having a normal jaw. Maybe a little tension but easily managed."

Dear everyone,  
  
I am writing to let you know I am reading each and every single one of your comments. I made this post because I saw many posts talking about how scared folks are. Truth be told, I am scared too. I'm scared everyday. That's life with anxiety. Sometimes it is really small and it feels like I can just ""ignore"" it and put it in my back pocket, and sometimes it is really huge and like a gigantic elephant stomping around in my brain.  
  
I recognize the tendency in myself to get caught up in negative feedback loops (including obsessively reading about horrible things and obsessing over current events) and decided I would post something somewhat different for us because sometimes, just being honest, coming to /r/anxiety can leave me feeling a bit more anxious, lol.  
  
Whatever the case, I want to thank you all once again for taking the time to share your thoughts and feelings. It is good to know we're not alone. There are so many of us out there who want to see good things come out in the world. I want to share a passage that is comforting to me when things become difficult, and hope maybe it will be of some small comfort to y'all as well.  
  
>""The life of Man is a long march through the night, surrounded by invisible foes, tortured by weariness and pain, towards a goal that few can hope to reach, and where none may tarry long. One by one, as they march, our comrades vanish from our sight, seized by the silent orders of omnipotent Death. Very brief is the time in which we can help them, in which their happiness or misery is decided. Be it ours to shed sunshine on their path, to lighten their sorrows by the balm of sympathy, to give them the pure joy of a never-tiring affection, to strengthen failing courage, to instil faith in hours of despair. Let us not weigh in grudging scales their merits and demerits, but let us think only of their need--of the sorrows, the difficulties, perhaps the blindnesses, that make the misery of their lives; let us remember that they are fellow-sufferers in the same darkness, actors in the same tragedy as ourselves. And so, when their day is over, when their good and their evil have become eternal by the immortality of the past, be it ours to feel that, where they suffered, where they failed, no deed of ours was the cause; but wherever a spark of the divine fire kindled in their hearts, we were ready with encouragement, with sympathy, with brave words in which high courage glowed.""

The subreddits aren't filled with top experts or analysts but teenagers who are as nervous as us. If you want to check on going news then check out AP or BBC feeds as information is more accurate."

As a young teenager I had major issues thinking the world was going to end. Now - with the Australian brush fires, the Puerto Rico earthquake and the situation in Iran, those fears have came back. I‚Äôve been super anxious and just trying to take a breath and do something to take my mind off the situations by doing stuff I enjoy.

I‚Äôm so scared and anxious what is going to come next. I know this may sound dumb - but I just want peace; I just want everybody to get along."
Thesmallone13,fdjfama,t3_elm4sm,"You literally just described my day today. I can't sleep. I've had that panicky, tight, knot in my chest since this all started. I don't know how people aren't scared.. I don't know what the future will bring or if there will a future for much longer and it scares me. I was driving a day ago and gave a frenzied, despondent lecture to my steering wheel followed by a nervous break down in the parking lot of my college. I can't get away from it because everyone is talking about it. As I walk around, I wonder how much longer will the buildings, trees, street signs, plants, and everything in between be there? I just feel hopeless."
orokami11,fdjseb8,t3_elm4sm,"There's so much recent shit happening around. 

Australia burning. The US and Iran missiles. Puerto Rico earthquakes. New influenza virus in China which has travelled to 1-2 countries.

universallyfuckedup,fdj41ha,t3_elm4sm,Yes I‚Äôve been trying not to read the news but it‚Äôs just everywhere. My sister is over in the Middle East and I just want her to come home but at the same time I‚Äôm afraid for her to get on a plane. I‚Äôm really trying not to think about it and get myself worked up.

I'm with you, never felt so stressed/scared in my life, have fires near by where I am, have had my car packed for a week now and tomorrow/Friday is not looking good for us.  Prepparing your house as best you can and having a plan in place, alleviates some anxiety and take some time out, stay of social media, employ some self care helps too. Be safe out there"

Dodge1992,fdj03z4,t3_elm4sm,"I wish there was a single unbiased news source so I could get some actual facts.  Alas, I will not sleep a wink."
doglover33510,fdj5ym5,t1_fdj03z4,I trust NPR. I know one of their reporters is  one of the few US reporters in Iran covering the conflict. They are good at reporting actual facts and interviewing people for information.
Viva-La-Muerte,fdj3u9o,t3_elm4sm,"Thanks OP.

Just took two valiums after the attacks. 

 Honestly,imo the worse us yet to come. 

A war with Iran looks like it  it's going to happen soon. All as climate change worsens and no telling the horrors that will be...if you think half a billion Australian animals killed in the bush fires is bad...wait until it is people instead. 

It isn't a grave it's the future we chose."

Massive thing that helped me was my breath. Turns out I have been chest breathing for years.

Learning how to belly breathe has reduced my anxiety significantly."

NPNP93,fdkotwf,t3_elm4sm,This is such a lovely post. My flying phobia is really overwhelming me at the moment and the news developing this morning has really thrown me
Privateski,fdlbsph,t3_elm4sm,"Thank you so much for this! I actually had to completely stop looking at the news because it kept reminding me of how much the world is upside down. And then I get those internal anxiety thoughts where I don‚Äôt think about anything else except for what‚Äôs happening in MY life. Ultimately, there is nothing wrong in my life right now. I‚Äôm actually doing really well. But it‚Äôs just my daily anxiety that makes it hard to walk down stairs because my legs are shaking so bad or the empty feeling I get in my tummy every morning and the thoughts just start flooding in. Everything in life is right, but my anxiety convinces me that everything is wrong. 

Thank god for meditation."
Roflcopter71,fdmb149,t3_elm4sm,Definitely needed this right now. Thank you.
TheTroubledChild,en7g7v,top_level,"My anxiety takes so much energy from me, I avoid people as much as I can, even my friends, even family. The moment they start talking it feels like sensory overload immediatly. I have to force myself out of the house so much. I am working from home, which makes it even worse. I DO feel lonely sometimes but then imaging someone being around is such an unbearable thought. 
It is NOT social anxiety, I am not scared of people or what they think of me, I just think they're unbearable and I lack the energy to deal with their bullshit. I used to be super extrovert some years ago, it all changed when I developed anxiety. 
I'm in therapy already, but it doesn't help, like at all. I don't wanna live and die like a hermit, but I don't know how to help it."
coffee_and_tv_easily,fdvts1p,t3_en7g7v,I feel like this a lot of the time. My social battery is very short and I easily get overwhelmed by conversations
waffletones,fe0738n,t1_fdvts1p,OMG SAME-
Togglet,fe20eee,t1_fdvts1p,I sometimes feel as though I'm not truly living. I can't focus on the person in front of me and enjoy each moment as it passes when my mind is racing in circles and loathing in self doubt. Anxiety really is a tax on our lives.
coffee_and_tv_easily,fe20r5y,t1_fe20eee,This is absolutely how life feels to me as well!! You described it perfectly.
Motionpicturerama,fdvrorp,t3_en7g7v,"Not necessarily people, but I find conversations really overstimulating. Like my system can't handle it. Noisy places too."
ForthNow,fdzc0e8,t1_fdvrorp,I get what you mean by not necessarily people.  I love sitting on the couch watching tv with my girlfriend or one of my parents or my best friend as there presence makes me relaxed.  When they try and start a conversation and make eye contact though it can be really tough if I‚Äôm not in the right mindset for it.
Tazhaki,fdwcdhi,t3_en7g7v,"I feel same. My mental problems takes so much my energy that sometimes I just want disappear without saying a word. And also I think I'm just big burden for everyone, so I try to save others from myself."
Visenya_Rhaenys,fdwvaia,t3_en7g7v,"I don't have friends anymore partially because of this. In my case, I think I'm emotionally burned out after spending so many years insisting on bad friendships. Nowadays I just feel empty, like I have nothing left to give because people already took everything from me. I miss enjoying the company of others and I feel lonely quite often, but I see no way out of this."
xStillSane,fdvuvlx,t3_en7g7v,"Yes. I can be extrovert when i need to, but i cannot hold onto that for very long time. Soon enough, i get tired of dealing with my friends, it's not that i hate them- they are all nice and fun to be around but i just don't have any energy to keep going on for long term. Therefore, distance grows and well, i become alone all over again. I want to stop being lethargic all the time omg ;-;"
ResilientBiscuit42,fdwjxee,t3_en7g7v,What are friends?
PineConeEagleMan,fdxty3l,t1_fdwjxee,"Those things from fairy tales, I think"
Idabbleinwitchcraft,fdx9w1j,t3_en7g7v,"I don't have friends anymore. Haven't for a long while now. My husband is my friend. That's enough for me, honestly. Even the thought of friends is exhausting. I hate feeling obligated to go out and do things. It never ends up being as bad as I expected, but it is severely draining.

 I hate talking on the phone, but I do talk to my only sister. I guess she's my friend too in a way, but luckily she knows what it's like to have anxiety though she is definitely an extrovert who doesn't like to be alone. 

I think I may have some sort of thyroid issue like others in my family that leave me feeling super fatigued and lethargic all of the time. 

Anyway, posted my whole life story just to say that you're not alone. You can try to change it or just embrace it. I've learned to accept that this is just how I am and I'm fine with it. My life is still happy and meaningful despite not having friends."
Desertbro,fdzpkuf,t1_fdx9w1j,"I miss having friends and meeting up to do stuff, but I'm not really making an effort to find friends or join some social clique - because I'm generally find with the peace and quiet from not hearing from people all the time.

I like to see people doing stuff, so I'll go to the park just to see people walking around - that's enough social contact for me not to feel alone - I don't need to talk to them.  I really limit my contact - even at work, I don't talk to most people there.  I just have zero interest in what they think or what they are doing."
SpiralToNowhere,fdyoxi9,t1_fdx9w1j,"Yeah, that's pretty much where I'm at now too.  Some days I panic but the reality is I'm mostly fine with it."
forestlover72,fdx4666,t3_en7g7v,"does it also happen to you with things like music and videos and just things in general? it could go deeper than anxiety if that's the case, something like a sensory disorder. worthwhile to bring up"
Desertbro,fdzp66n,t1_fdx4666,"No - for me it's only people that are particularly distruptive.  With music, TV, sports - any entertainment, I can choose the type and how long I want to be around it.

People are different - they inflict conversation and topics that are irksome at any time - and telling them to just Shut Up will cause issues - so many times, choosing not to be around people is the easier option.

Like others have said - I don't have stuff to fear from people, they're just annoying more often than not, and I'd rather have peace and quiet.

Clerks in grocery stores or restaurants and such are not annoying, they are brief with their info, help you, and get out of your face - but something like a salesman would be a trigger, so I would avoid those environments."
TheTroubledChild,fdxsdo8,t1_fdx4666,"I am honestly not sure, but I'll look into that. Thank you for bringing this to my attention."
Desertbro,fe6nlcq,t1_fe3vure,"I understand.  I think it was rude on her part to come to your home uninvited.  I'd have been upset, too."
littlebunnyfoofoo11,fdwxv1o,t3_en7g7v,"My boyfriend and I are navigating this together, and it's honestly weirdly brought us closer? My anxiety is not consistent, it comes and goes in waves, sometimes gently and sometimes forcefully. But my battery will sometimes short circuit and I could be in the middle of doing something with him and just immediately be done. Don't look at me, don't talk to me, definitely don't even think about touching me. I need to curl up with myself and watch a movie alone before I'm ready to socialize again, even with the love of my life.

The key is very open and honest communication with yourself and your loved ones. It's nobody's fault, it couldn't have been avoided, nothing happened to cause the shut down, it just happens. Just give me a bit to reset, chill out, and I'll be fine."
TotalDsg,fdwdzd2,t3_en7g7v,"Yea just like you, kind of a sensory over stimulation."
AshleyIsSleeping,fdwj39d,t3_en7g7v,"I've been in an especially bad place mentally and I feel this. And I feel like my friends are going to hate me for it, or assume our friendship just isn't important to me."
golevka6489,fdwjdm8,t3_en7g7v,"Not sure if this solidarity is appropriate or valuable to you, but I'm going through this right now, too. It feels like a massive difference from how I used to be. I hope you find balance and peace."
misswyatt,fdxifwn,t3_en7g7v,"I feel this so much. I used to be an extrovert, now I get overwhelmed by texting."
TheTroubledChild,fdxqqtj,t1_fdxifwn,"YES that as well, even texting feels too much!"
brad123xxx,fdxvkgy,t3_en7g7v,"I don't want to do anything. I dont want to work, watch anything, hang out with people, I dont want to continue my education, play games, do chores. Theres just nothing I want to do. Where did all the motivation go.."
TheTroubledChild,fdybuqe,t1_fdxvkgy,Feel you. I just wanna lie in bed and wait until life is over. I want my motivation back.
Desertbro,fdzpzi0,t1_fdxvkgy,"I was never especially motivated to do most of what normal people do.  However, I used to have confidence I was good at what I wanted to do, or could accomplish tasks in a reliable manner.

What I've lost now is the *\~ confidence \~* and it feels like a hole in me. Where I used to just get up and do things and figure it out along the way - now I hesitate because I'm unsure I can figure anything out.  Very different from how I was before."
evin2747,fdy6jow,t3_en7g7v,"Oh god. This spoke to me, loudly. Thank you for letting me know I‚Äôm not alone in this behaviour. I know it look some degree of guts to post this. Please know someone, somewhere in the world takes solace in your words and can empathise with where you find yourself in life. I hope that you and the rest of us, find the answer. x"
Reddit_is_therapy,fdx632z,t3_en7g7v,"Yeah, I'm a huge introvert who got rid of that nerve racking anxiety by practicing over the years. Now I can talk to anyone, even if they're a stranger without much anxiety. 

But no matter how close we are, any sort of social interaction drains me. It's like every bit of interaction takes me one step closer to sleep. 

So if I'm hanging out with people, I'm gonna have very little energy afterwards to do my homework. I just keep days chunked with social or personal stuff - entire day for people and no study etc."
sunnyc1414,fdxzf1x,t3_en7g7v,"I‚Äôm an extrovert with lots of friends and fun things to do with them. I have zero phobias so I don‚Äôt really have a trigger. I am very happily married with 3 amazing grown children.

BUT since my anxiety hit in massive form late November I have yearned to be alone.  I do not feel like I have the energy, feelings, or mental fortitude to be with an other people. I feel like my head is in a cloud. My gut churns and I am shaky and weak and, of course, riddled with anxiety. It‚Äôs exhausting to be around other people and fake like I‚Äôm not dying.
Solidarity and peace to you. This is the pits."
Desertbro,fdzqd93,t1_fdxzf1x,"Yes, for me, too - I can distinctly feel the difference from being able to interact with people easily, to now where I just don't want much interaction at all.

I keep waiting for what I call ""the NEW normal"" where I understand my limits, and I'm comfortable working in that zone, but so far, I still feel like I'm missing something, and NOT at some stable place where I can relax and not worry."
nolabitch,fdxwek5,t3_en7g7v,My ability to socialize is crazy limited. I'm someone who recharges alone. It's okay to prefer your alone time. You don't have to change it unless you think it is directly related to your unhappiness.
TheTroubledChild,fdybgbd,t1_fdxwek5,"I think it is, it feels like I am wasting away my life. I want to be social again, I want to go on adventures and travel with friends as I used to. But I just can't. When I force myself I am a nervous wreck and just don't have a good time."
nolabitch,fdyojw5,t1_fdybgbd,"I'm so sorry - has your therapist made ANY recommendations that resonate with you?

Perhaps small steps is the way to go. Schedule an hour or two out and then come home. Go to a cafe and soak in the energy of the public. Also give yourself permission to have a no social day - some people develop a social calendar and work their way up to greater things. Also, it may help to open up with a trusted friend who, when in their company, can watch out for and honor your anxiety.

What about ""online"" friends? Sometimes skype/facetime can satisfy some kind of social itch.

If you're in NYC I'd love to meet up."
AnAngryBitch,fdyhbdi,t3_en7g7v,"I get like this, too. What saves me is, I take off out of town for a couple days by myself.
I go somewhere I've never been before and where I don't know anybody. Grab a hotel room, relax and treat myself. Edit: TRUST ME--It REALLY helps. 

You don't have to go anywhere big like NYC or LA, just go to wherever you can reach by car or train/bus and stay a night or two in the local motel. The first night I treat myself to a pizza and dessert and just binge-watch TV (I don't have cable.) The next day I usually walk around the local coffee-shop/antique district and window shop. It. REALLY. HELPS!!"
reefsedge,fdynm3h,t3_en7g7v,"I haven't had friends or a life of any kind in a long time. I haven't spent time with friends in like 2 years. I don't date. The only people I see on a regular basis are coworkers, whom I dislike. I'm happiest when I'm completely alone, mostly because it takes all of my energy just to make a life of solitude work. I don't get lonely anymore, because I've mostly forgotten what it's like to have conversations with people about anything substantial.

Discuss what you're experiencing with a therapist and develop a therapeutic plan, or you'll end up just like me."
AllyIsCuteDuh,fdyr63h,t3_en7g7v,"I have lost some of my closest friends exactly because of this. I would constantly feel too tired to engage with them through texts and since I moved countries and this was the only way of communication, we naturally fell apart. Ot is a very slow and painful process where you kind of realise what's happening but also cant quietly do enough about it. And the thing is trying to explain to people, even my family, always ends up sounding ""I was too lazy to text you"" or ""Couldnt even bother caring"", when simply constant updates and chats overwhelmed and made me even more aware of how hermit-y I was living."
mordantOpossum,fdx2u2m,t3_en7g7v,"Oh yes. On the regular. I often feel horrible, but many of my friends know and understand. Job hunting lately, and it drains me so much I don't want to do ANYTHING afterwards."
badwitchproject,fdx7ctm,t3_en7g7v,"Yeah. Currently in my best mates house, didn't want to come up, shes away getting ready so now I'm watching the match with her eldest son. I just want to go home, stick on some tv and cook my steak. I have not been in the mood for people all week."
ladycandle,fdxsssy,t3_en7g7v,I lived in three different countries. I had a group of girlfriends in two county.. didn't realize how stressful having so many women friends are.. always some drama .. always having to choose sides .. now that I moved and settled to another country.. I am married now .. all I do is go work and home.. sometimes go to outings with co workers.. I am more happy now with no group of girlfriends
veryemmappropriate,fdysu54,t3_en7g7v,"I've been having this problem more recently, and hadn't considered that it was anxiety related. A moderate percentage of people in my immediate circle (like my husband and my best friend) have ADD/ADHD and get distracted or go on tangents about things they find interesting that don't necessarily interest me in the same way. And I find myself nodding along, but I know my physical presentation definitely shows that I'm disinterested or frustrated, and my thoughts start to veer toward escaping the interaction or changing the subject as soon as possible. But I feel this sometimes spending time with friends that don't have ADD/ADHD as well, so considering that anxiety could be the root cause might be helpful. But it also kinda feels like I just have a limited attention span, and any monologue that goes over that limit leaves me frustrated and bored."
davidmt,fdyzdi5,t3_en7g7v,"I sometimes feel I am alone with how I am, but its surprising to see so many comments that are EXACTLY me.  I too find it so exhausting to be social, I have not have friends in years, nor do I feel any desire to have any.  I do everything by myself, and am mostly happy, although I am very moody.  I am not lonely.

However, my family is pushing me to go to the doctor.  I end up bottling up my feelings and eventually take it out on them.  I hate that it happens, but it does.  I can't control it. 

I don't know if I'm depressed or what the story is, but do you think I would be a candidate for medication?  I feel like I'm going to go in there and they will tell me I'm fine, and that its all in my head.  I DON""T have any desire for counseling, the thought of it makes me very anxious."
davidmt,fe5quzn,t1_fe3y69c,"Thank you for replying.  I am thinking about calling the doc tomorrow for an appt, but yeah I am embarrased to tell them why I want to see him.  I am open to medication but seriously I feel somehow guilty about it.  I don't even know why.  I really don't have any desire to be my socially active but at the same time, I don't want to lose my temper around my family every time I see them."
ginx_minx,fdx0kj1,t3_en7g7v,"I can totally relate. It is almost as I had writen this myself. I used to be extraverted as well, and still am but rarely and only in certain situations. I dread seeing people so much and for one sole reason : I can't converse. It feels like my energy just completely drains once I see someone. Talking isn't even an option at this point. Started three years ago."
RaccoonRazor,fdxgq7l,t3_en7g7v,"Everybody is different, and it‚Äôs not *necessarily* bad being relatively unsocial. With time and practice you‚Äôll increase your social battery"
toi-kuji,fdxlxaj,t3_en7g7v,Just listening to people talk can be so so tiring
waffletones,fe07084,t3_en7g7v,BroOOo I'm literally the samee I used to be so extroverted but like...depression and anxietyyy eee(well I havent gotten it checked professionally yet so just possible depression/anxiety) but omll I feel SO BAD cause I get like a bunch of messages and dms and I just ignore it till like a week later bc I'm just so tired and dont want to talk to anyone or go outside and ik if I respond then itll start a super long convo and I just cant üòÖüòÖ
sealteamricksss,fdx8bq7,t3_en7g7v,I hate myself.
Alonelioness,fdx7o19,t3_en7g7v,"I would say the same. Anytime so have to head to classes or work during a bad day when I feel anxious, there is a severe weight over me, making me feel exhausted."
testicletoes,fdx7vi8,t3_en7g7v,"I‚Äôm introverted, have been all my life. I have lots of friends though, and i force myself everyday to be social and talk to people. I love my friends, so much. But damn its hard. I used to be super shy, and never wanna talk to anyone but I got tired of having no friends."
paellapotatoes,fdxkhlb,t3_en7g7v,"Yes same here. It's just horrible because I will start doubting who I have been to them (my friends!) and overthinking everything the moment I walk away from the conversation. I guess mine is more of social anxiety but it's good to know I'm not alone and it's not just a phase. I can get headaches after having normal conversations I somehow perceive as stressful even though they may not be.

On a slightly digressing note - I have far much less patience and tolerance for strangers now. I feel like they invade my personal space a lot (even if they are not touching me) on the bus, train etc and was wondering if it was related to my aversion towards socialising as well."
_Senjogahara_,fdxn04m,t3_en7g7v,never really had it lol.
numberfivedream,fdxraj4,t3_en7g7v,I was born with it.But I always wanted to change that.
Karen-MM,fdxt111,t3_en7g7v,"I can totally relate to this. Just reading the news or a particularly ‚Äúthought-y‚Äù book can overwhelm me. Thanksgiving and Christmas wreaked havoc on my nerves, even though it was loved family. Quiet time in bed is relaxing but non-productive and I don‚Äôt want to hire a maid. You may be indisposed to meds - a lot of people are - but I find buspirone helpful for my anxiety."
Plzspeaksoftly,fdy4isa,t3_en7g7v,"Legit me today.  

I have no energy for anyone talking to me. And In getting annoyed real easy when anyone talks to me.   

I think I've reached my social limit for the week.  Nothing much I can do about when I have 2 kids that constantly talk to me. 

Can I just wrap myself in my blanket and watch Netflix til I sleep?"
rescue-cat,fdy6kit,t3_en7g7v,So often. I avoid people until i have to see them or until i feel better. Sometimes it takes weeks. Good thing i have very understanding friends who are ok with me just sending them memes for a couple weeks at a time.
Nomerss,fdyuq83,t3_en7g7v,"I understand where you are coming from. A lot of times I lay bed and want to do nothing, talk to no one, and just sleep. A few ways I combat this, and this is easier said then done, is get up. When I realize I am having those feelings I give my self 6 seconds to get out of bed. Eating some healthy foods like fruits and vegetables, drinking a lot of water, and practicing some mindfulness helps a ton. Lastly, even though you feel you do not have the energy to talk to anyone, combat it directly, reach out to someone: get food, coffee, have a meaningful conversation, something productive. This will help reenforce positive connections to these feelings. 

Grant it, this a personal prescription, it may not work for you, it is what I found works best for me. Now, sometimes those days come where you don't want to deal with anything and that's find too, just don't let it control you.

You got this!"
ConfusedPeachGirl777,fdyxnt3,t3_en7g7v,"It's super annoying. I agree. Sometimes I just feel so tired and then when I actually have energy one day, my friends are busy and don't have the time to hang out."
ColoradoGrrrl,fdzflkn,t3_en7g7v,Not currently but definitely has happened in the past. Just did not have the emotional energy for other humans. I just lived the hermit life for a month or two until I was ready to socialize again. Getting back into therapy also helped. (I‚Äôm not in therapy regularly but have done it several times when things are worse just to get me through the down season).
Peachmon,fdzfzdn,t3_en7g7v,"I am the exact same!  i was invited to a friends birthday party yesterday but i didnt even bother going because of anxiety (100+ people - randoms and people from highschool).  I often feel instant regret or feel angry about not being confident enough to go to social events or see friends... it feels pathetic and lowly of me.  I am definately an introvert who would much rather stay at home on youtube and play games, but i just want to be able to function and live like a normal human being."
Code3LI,fdzjzq0,t3_en7g7v,"I've lost the energy to even deal with myself many days lol. That's why I sleep so much.


For example, today I woke up at 12 and took a nap at 2 for a couple of hours.


But I know where you're coming from. Many times I get invited out I just can't. Partially due to many social  experiences involving alcohol, which I'm trying to stay away from; partially because I lack the energy to get out. And for whatever reason, I get super anxious while driving, especially at night. So anything far away makes me feel ill due to the anxiety."
alessF,fdzlv09,t3_en7g7v,# BIG SAME
Desertbro,fdzo43a,t3_en7g7v,"My anxiety blew up about 5 years ago - and in the time since, I've tried to make my life more simple - less to think about = less to worry about.

Although I like to see people and talk to them occasionally, I mostly pulled away from close contact with almost everyone I know.  It's just easier not trying to sort out what other people are griping about in addition to my own issues - I don't have emotional space for both any more.

So...basically became a hermit in order to not be dramatically anti-social.  I still talk to people, but I keep it really limited."
kjngstars,fdzwq2t,t3_en7g7v,"I can feel you, its so true for me :(("
john_justdance,fdzy8jy,t3_en7g7v,I feel anxious going  out with nee friends I mad3. Its hard sometimes when you find a new passion and you are anxious to follow this passion because you dont know the consequences. My new friend are really into rap and Brega funk (brasil) music and its all so new to me! it is at the same time WONDERFUL and very scary. i know it will all work out. I am appreciating every second of these new things and learnig that 99% of my worries never manifest themselves so Im very proud of me for that. I am getting better every day and I wish you the same!
def-b4-decaf,fdzz2it,t3_en7g7v,"I can feel this way sometimes. But it‚Äôs important to stay a part of your friends‚Äô lives, because you can and will loose them with time if you neglect them. Friendship is a two way street. Even just staying in contact by online methods/texting is a good way. And let them know what is going on so they don‚Äôt feel as if it‚Äôs personal and their fault. They will be accomodating if they‚Äôre good friends, and give you the space you need. They will still be there for you for the times when you are feeling like you need a friend. :)"
claireeees,fe04dnr,t3_en7g7v,"I can't be with people for more than 10 hours before I start to get cranky, I like the people I hanged with it's just I need to be alone to myself for most of the time. I pushed all my friends away because of this because they were extreme extroverts and they wanted to party everynight. And thus I am friendless but I'm doing ok"
carter_pride,fe04he9,t3_en7g7v,Yes.
waffletones,fe071ma,t3_en7g7v,Btw does therapy help...?
Fr0me,fe088mf,t3_en7g7v,"For a couple bad months there I was feeling the same way. I didnt even want to think about how badly a social outing or party would go, but after about another month i'm starting to feel a lot better and have even gone to a couple parties and had a good time. It may not sound like much but looking back at those months and Im happy where I am now. 

These feelings come and go like waves,; somedays youll feel like shit and others maybe less like shit. But its just a matter of doing a little each day and thinking positively. 

Altho easier said than done. Good luck my friend, love from Canada :)"
IiteraIIy,fe08oew,t3_en7g7v,"Honestly, this sounds like more than just anxiety. Possibly ADHD or manic depression, though the latter is less likely without other symptoms.

Listen, I used to experience something very very similar. I still do with mostly everyone. I lived for a long time thinking I wasn't capable of maintaining friendships and that i'd *rather* be alone. About 9 or so months ago I met 3 on the internet who changed my life and we all went to see each other in NY and it was shockingly fun despite the grimy neighborhood the hotel was in and the blistering heat and anxiety from all the activity. 

I can't even explain to you what it is about them, but they work with me and support my needs and respect my boundaries. They're the first people besides my immediate family that I feel comfortable being around almost constantly, even if we're doing our own thing. Sometimes it takes someone really special to get through to you and it's okay if that takes a long time, don't lose hope and don't isolate yourself.

I also wanna mention, one of the most jarring factors of friendships that I didn't know was turning me off to them was the romantic border. I'm on the ace spectrum and it made me feel much more comfortable and safe to be affectionate to my friends while we all understand things are completely platonic and romance isn't an ""upgrade."""
theblurryboy,fe08rhf,t3_en7g7v,"I feel thr exact same. Been back in town for a month, have hung with buddies once :/"
tlambinator,fe0bu73,t3_en7g7v,I'm the same way. Playing video games online with a headset helps. It reminds me that I can make mistakes and people won't automatically hate me. It also helps me practice talking to new people.
theaziz2001,fe0fq4s,t3_en7g7v,Then they‚Äôre like ‚Äúgod you‚Äôre such a joy killer‚Äù which makes you feel worse about yourself which leads to more anxiety. Never ending fucking loop of hell and they could care less.
LeCharlesMuhDickens,fe0p6ku,t3_en7g7v,"All the time. We have friends that we regularly grab dinner with, sometimes it‚Äôs just too much for me. They‚Äôre good people, the best people really, but the questions and conversations can be hard to handle on occasion."
supbiatches1,fe56pww,t3_en7g7v,"I find that I constantly need to be around people, because it gives me positive energy and keeps my mind off itself."
lovesprite,feaizpv,t3_en7g7v,It happens to me even at work sometimes
judylee1127,fdx72cr,t3_en7g7v,I feel like this might be less of anxiety but more depression related.
TheTroubledChild,fdxs3fn,t1_fdx72cr,"Don't think so, I am super anxious as soon as I step out the door and tend to have panic attacks. Staying home isn't exklusive to depression."
deliriousnotions,eo8ep9,top_level,"I got my first acceptance letter today!!! High school was a pretty shit experience for me. Anxiety held me back and lead to me missing things like football games and prom. It got so bad that I had to get home tutors for two years because I couldn‚Äôt even manage to leave my house. For awhile I considered dropping out because I literally believed it was impossible to continue. But I couldn‚Äôt be more proud right now. I‚Äôm IN school for senior year, I WILL be attending my graduation ceremony, and I AM GOING TO COLLEGE!!! Hell yeah!!! So if anyone feels like giving up, trust me if I can get into college with my attendance record looking the way it is, you can do pretty much anything."
Amarannta,fea8emj,t3_eo8ep9,"Congrats! This is a oportunity to start from 0, to be who you wanna be in a new atmosphere. I've been there, and it was scary, but I was able to get new fantastic friends, learn a lot and have a lot less social anxiety. This is great, you deserved it!"

Zack9764,feb3p1p,t1_feaajkc,Don't be scared but just make sure you're making changes. I didn't make enough changes and it wasn't fully the fresh start I was dreaming of but it was definitely still better than high school.

elliewashere,feae2y6,t3_eo8ep9,"I am so impressed by your perseverance and grit. Good for you!! Huge congratulations.

(Disclaimer:  I'm sure you know all about this stuff having gone through a lot of anxiety already, but I wanted to give you a heads up in case you don't know about these resources.) When I was in college the disability services office helped me with my anxiety; I worked on time management and study skills with them, and they were great for emotional support. This was even without official accommodations for anxiety as a disability (which I didn't realize I qualified for, and it sounds like you would too). I hope your school has these resources if you want them. Most schools are required to in the U.S. I believe.

Unrelated -- I hope that your college experience is wonderful. YOU'RE DOING IT! GOOD FOR YOU!"
deliriousnotions,feagmhg,t1_feae2y6,Thank you!! I‚Äôm planning on taking advantage and getting myself a single room so I can unwind in peace after a busy day. I don‚Äôt know much about it though. Guess I‚Äôll be doing some research lol

HaleyBugga,feadq1y,t3_eo8ep9,"Fuck yeah!! I was quite the same, extremely anxious and quiet in high school, didn't really have friends. When I started uni I found a group of amazing friends I'm so comfortable with, as well as my lovely SO I'm very grateful for. My life did a 180 and I'm so happy I put myself out there. 

Go to events!! Besides the orientation week things, schools usually host a bunch of stuff that encourages socialization, and that's how I met a lot of people. Also, ""stepping stone friends"" are a thing. Meaning the people you hang out with for the first week (or however long) don't have to be your new best friends, but can be great ways to meet people you mesh with better. Congrats!!!"

tbh, college is going to be hell for sure. but what in the world isn't? you'll learn a LOT. one lesson i greatly received from college was when I was presenting my thesis in front of my professors.

also, i nailed it. you'll do great my friend."

meowmeansgetout,emm7fd,top_level,"So I had a crappy day, was condemned in public and I controlled myself from crying. It was a success! But I still felt like crying and the feeling of sadness/anger/misunderstood was(and still) stuck inside me. I waited until I could get back home to cry. However, when I get back I'm too tired to cry? Does that make sense üòÇ"
saffire_playz,fdpne45,t3_emm7fd,"Yep, it sure does. I have been sad at times and just can't cry and it makes me feel sick tbh"

multiplestoriesgirl,fdpotwr,t3_emm7fd,"So much sense!!! I spent much of last year doing that. I'd be in a situation that would make me want to cry but couldn't so I'd tell myself ""you can cry your eyes out when you get home"" but when I got home I just couldn't do it. So frustrating to still have that bad feeling in you and not be able to cry to feel relief."
meowmeansgetout,fdpvm81,t1_fdpotwr,Same gurl~ *sigh*
bxo1988,fdpvc23,t3_emm7fd,I burst into tears infront of my pharmacist yesterday and infront of my lecturers and other students at college. I always come across so confident and happy infront of them that it was really embarrassing.  For some reason I find that having a hot bath and a cry makes me feel better when things get too much. I almost look forward to it like itll be a bit of relief locked away from the world and I'll feel better. I had a bath and tried I guess? To cry it out and I just couldnt.  It was physically impossible and it was frustrating and made me feel horrible. Then a close friend come over after and I couldn't stop crying. They didnt even speak to me or do anything that triggered it I just sat silently crying. Ugh haha.
meowmeansgetout,fdpvqh3,t1_fdpvc23,I'm sorry to hear that dude :( Felt the same with the physically impossible thing. Hope you're feeling better now :)
bxo1988,fdpvwm4,t1_fdpvqh3,"Its just frustrating! Thats one of the things I hate the most about my anxiety and health anxiety and that gets me down the most. Im just frustrated with it.  Its like I understand how it works but my body and brain doesnt do what I understand or want it to do. I feel abit better now, the embarrassment will pass! I hope you feel better soon! As much as I wouldn't want anyone to cry if itll help you I hope you can have a cry soon.. just a little one mind you! :)"
meowmeansgetout,fdpwb7z,t1_fdpvwm4,"Yo ikr~ If only our brain and body listens to us...

bxo1988,fdpwez3,t1_fdpwb7z,üòÇüòÇ only time I'd ever tell someone to cry! Sometimes I listen to songs i know make me cry to bring it on. Ridiculous but sometimes it is needed! It does really help you feel better until you get a migraine from doing it so hard.. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

gottapeegottapee,fdpq2ba,t3_emm7fd,"Yes and I hate it so much. You‚Äôre definitely not alone in this.
The worst part is when it‚Äôs a horribly inconvenient time to cry, it‚Äôs almost impossible to hold it back but when I‚Äôm finally home, in private, I just can‚Äôt seem to let it out."
meowmeansgetout,fdpvnw0,t1_fdpq2ba,Mmhmm~ Really hate it too~ Thought I could release some of these emotions...
Reachingout365,fdpvq97,t3_emm7fd,"Lol put in a sad movie, or start journaling. That should do it.

But yea I've done this and it's so annoying. Like it actually requires energy to cry... I feel like due to insomnia I cry less lol"

True true. Didn't sleep well last night. Currently too exhausted to cry but migraine is making it hard to sleep..."
M1r4cul0usP5ych0,fdpwr1e,t3_emm7fd,"YES! I hate this so much. Especially since I have so much trouble with bottling up my emotions. I know when I get the urge to cry I need to let it happen and release that emotion or else it's going right back into the bottle and the lid will tighten once again. (Which sucks when I'm in public and can't get away.)

Makes me feel like I took advantage of my tear ducts when I was a kid. I could force myself to cry on the spot whenever or wherever. Now my tears run on their own time. I just do my best to make sure it's a comfortable setting."
meowmeansgetout,fdq7wp6,t1_fdpwr1e,"I get you with that bottle thing~ I tried watching a sad movie just now (suggested by another redditor). Usually I would've cried. But unfortunately this time it's like I have more emotions building up inside me and still couldn't cry lmao

Yup
Yup
That's how it started

Just wanted to feel something

That's why I started self harming too."
Jellyoscar,fdqhpn1,t1_fdqhf83,Fuck yeah but that's another problem for me that makes it worse i can't remember stuff for very long or if i try to say it or at least type it my brain just decides to block it off.

Ate02muc,fdqa01p,t3_emm7fd,"I rarely ever cry in public bc I just don‚Äôt express my emotions to ppl I know. The only exceptions are when I‚Äôm in a place where I‚Äôm being overwhelmed by multiple things at once, then I either have a panic attack and cry or I go numb and can‚Äôt feel anything"
XanaxWarriorPrincess,fdqkbhw,t3_emm7fd,"I've been needing a good cry too. I'm thinking of watching Grave of the Fireflies, the saddest movie ever, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stop, so I keep putting it off."
meowmeansgetout,fdtw99f,t1_fdqkbhw,Samee heard it's the saddest movie ever and didn't really dare watching it...yet
worldinjune,fdqm7hq,t3_emm7fd,I will sometimes force myself to think about something sad like imagining something bad happening just to make myself cry... LOL
Stellar_Stairway,fdqnp8d,t3_emm7fd,"Yes, I go to my go-to‚Äôs for crying when that happens‚Äîthere is so much tear fodder on the internet. There are key songs, videos, and clips I seek out when I need to cry. It will be different for everyone!"
AliceHanano,fdqpvlr,t3_emm7fd,"Yes. That's me most of the times I want to cry. I don't want to cry unless I've gone to bed and I know I won't be seeing anyone until the next day, but at that time I'm just tired."
iObeyTheHivemind,fdqr14b,t3_emm7fd,Sure have. I monologue my story when I feel like I need to get it out. I talk like I'm sitting in a group therapy session. Just to myself. It helps me.
scrake1,fdrth7k,t3_emm7fd,I never cry. I wish I could. Idk what's wrong with me. I feel the pain and sadness ball up in me but all I can do is sigh over and over. I guess sighing is my version of crying.
CidCrisis,fdrysrd,t1_fdrth7k,"Same. Very *very* occasionally if I'm drunk enough, and the music hits me the right way, I can cry. But it is rare.

But yeah, wish I could as well. It's really cathartic when it happens. I envy people who say they just cry in bed all day. Better than just feeling dead. Like a corpse walking."
miss_21,fdq1p1m,t3_emm7fd,Just breathe deep breaths and try to relax. It helps me get it out when I do that.

InsecurityAtItsWorst,fdq6xg1,t3_emm7fd,"I've been trying to cry for a few weeks, In my stress relieving places. Shower, and bed listening to pop punk yet the most i can ever get is a single tear.

Not sure how to deal"
meowmeansgetout,fdq7pgi,t1_fdq6xg1,Some redditors suggested listening to sad music or watching sad movies... Didn't work for me.. but maybe you can try?
InsecurityAtItsWorst,fdq8tsw,t1_fdq7pgi,"My my genre is pop punk, i listen and play it and have gained a deep connection with many songs of this genre for different reasons. 

I've seen a fuck load of bands, my girlfriend and i bonded over them early on in our relationship due to me being drunk and explaining what these songs mean to me and such things.

When i try to use these songs to cry i get overwhelming feelings i relate to retroactive jealously and that does me zero good.

Thanks for the suggestion though!"
BatteredRose92,fdqcljn,t3_emm7fd,I'm just impressed you have the skills necessary to potpone crying.

meowmeansgetout,fdtwswo,t1_fdsp471,It's okie~ Everyone has their own way of expressing their joy/anger. Yours is to cry. Call me weird but that's kind of cute. Reminded me of my bestie ü§£
Jellyoscar,fdqgqsj,t3_emm7fd,Oh my fucking god yes i think this has just turned into a problem that has just stopped me from being able to cry altogether and i hate it because i feel stupid and fake. I really fucking hate it and i don't even know if it's just me exaggerating things in my head or wether i know how bad the situation is and i have no actual reaction. I just want to cry my eyes out so bad.
draconis4756,fdqir2p,t3_emm7fd,"Yea I feel like this a lot. I can never get to a point that I can let it out. The closest I can get it my eye watering up.

DepressedDenise,fdqiup1,t3_emm7fd,FUCKING ME:)
Naila-Alian,fdqiy78,t3_emm7fd," You will need to put your self in an emotional state so the tears can come out , listening to some sad music while remembering a painful memory could help .

 being emotionally overwhelmed is what triggers us to cry , it's sign that we need to vent out some negative ( explained or unexplained ) energy , sometimes you don't know why you have an urge to cry but your body does it for a reason .so it's better cry at that moment ."
meowmeansgetout,fdtvylb,t1_fdqiy78,Aww thanks~ I was alone at home and I was rehearsing the situation where I rant the incident to someone (not like I'll do that fr). And then the tears just come out...Don't feel as suffocated anymore but I'm getting more anxious.
alaskawamas5000,fdqja4c,t3_emm7fd,"I've done it a lot of times and as you mentioned, I get frustrated when I want to let my tears out when I get home. 

I cried in public just once when I got out of one of my classes. I had a meltdown, ran away from the building my classes took place and sat in one of the benches located in the main hallway (in which every person of my faculty walks in). 
I bursted into tears as everyone was walking by, and I knew that I was (sadly) the center of attention. Even some guys recorded me and took photos. 

I'm not really ashamed of it when I look back into it at times, it was an experience. It was something that my heart was telling me to do, I had whatsoever no control over myself, and I was mentally tired. 

I think it‚Äôs necessary sometimes to let yourself go when you really need it, other occasions imply the wait of your emotions. It may be worthy sometimes, and you‚Äôll have a good time."

beythli,fdsnpnd,t3_emm7fd,"I've found that my BEST cry sessions happen when I'm going through my stretch routine with somewhat calming/chill music on. I mean, get really invested in these stretches and breathe properly. Allow your mind to roam during. Let those bad feelings leave your body from the tips of your fingers and toes, as well as your breaths.  Accept the fresh, calming sensations that replace the negativity.

It sounds energy consuming/like a lot of work, but it gets easier. It's so rewarding!

The tears just FLOW out of me due to so much energy moving inside of me, it takes way less energy than actually crying. AND I'm replacing those negative feelings with much better ones. Highly recommended!"
Ayujessica,fdsy3kc,t3_emm7fd,"Usually when that happens, I get the idea that I cannot cry because I already cry so much that I'm starting to get, like, numbed to the pain I am experiencing. Imo, that is the worst feeling I can have, because it feels as if I am losing hope that stuff will get better.

Sometimes I tell myself that it is because I am tired though, like you said. Or because the thing that triggered my crying has passed at that point and I cannot do anything about the fact that it happened, so I choose to move on an focus on something else again, which also sucks because it has that same numbing effect in a way. 

So weird to say, but I really wish I could cry on command to just let it out and feel stronger afterward"

Anyone else have this? Could it be something like Adrenal Fatigue?"

Ybuzz,fdo6kl1,t3_emckin,"Absolutely! 

Let me introduce you to 'spoon theory'. Mostly it's used by people with chronic illness or disabilities (my SO is one such person, which is how I learned about it) but in the simplest terms, your 'spoons' represent your physical energy. 

You, like everyone start out the day with a set number of spoons in your pocket. But every task you do costs a set number of spoons - so taking a shower? That's a spoon. Getting out of the house? Spoon. Get to the shops? Couple of spoons. Carrying the shopping back home? Several spoons.  For most people this is fine - they have almost unlimited spoons, more than they will ever use in a day. But for people with chronic illness, pain, disabilities etc., their spoons can vary a lot. They might wake up with just a handful of spoons and have to choose - 'do I shower? Or do I cook and eat a meal? Because I can't do both today if I also have to take the dog out to pee. ' 

But here's the thing - introverts use spoons when they interact with people, and people with anxiety use spoons when they do things that make them anxious.

On a bad day for your illness/pain/anxiety etc. you wake up with less spoons than a good day, and so you can get less done. 

But then if you try to 'borrow spoons' (or: push yourself beyond your limits today) then you will have no or fewer spoons tomorrow. 

I found it kind of comforting to be able to tell myself ""it's okay to go easy on yourself this weekend, because you used all your spoons this week."" Or "" it's okay to do one scary thing this week, and leave the other one till next week, so you don't use all your spoons and crash."""
bloutchbleue,fdo9pvn,t1_fdo6kl1,"I use that metaphor too ! Or something similar, with something looking kinda like a battery. I see myself needing to be charged again after a huge social event and try to accept that I need to be alone and in a safe and relaxed place, and that's it's perfectly ok.
But I like your metaphor better!"
C-to-the-Sax,fdofki7,t1_fdo6kl1,This is incredible I‚Äôm going to use this to explain my anxiety!
dtshockney,fdorzpw,t1_fdo6kl1,"Ive kinda followed this theory this week. Ive been having a bad mix of anxiety, asthma, and illness. My spoons have been very limited but its helped me to actually take the time i need for me instead of trying to suffer through work days or push myself too much."
Dace88,fdpq7iq,t1_fdo9pvn,"I prefer yours. I relate to it more. 

I'm an addict and I'm 9 months clean. Had to go to someones birthday about a week ago, and of course it was in a pub. I knew I was going to a pub, I knew it was going to be hard but since it was an organised surprise party I figured it'll mainly be his friends and family.

Wrong. It was ALL his friends and family, All his wife's friends and family, and people he hadnt spoken to in about thirty years.

So there I am sat in a pub, stone cold sober, with close to 200 people heavily drinking in a fairly small room.

I positioned myself right beside the door to the smoking area so I could pop out everytime I thought the anxiety was going to rise above me. I must have chainsmoked for the 3 hours I was there. Thankfully I had my 2, nearly 3 now, month old daughter with me so I was able to say goodbye, I have to bring my girl home and put her to bed.

That was about a week ago, maybe more, and it knocked me on my arse up to now. 

I was just drained, the way you described it, and I needed however long it took to recharge. I'm still not 100% but at least I'm up and about and somewhat functional."
AbysmalBelle,fdpzzv3,t1_fdo9pvn,Thank you for this
Pictocheat,fdqse9m,t1_fdo9pvn,"The analogy/metaphor I personally use involves rubber bands.  Every morning when you wake up, it's like you're given a different rubber band.  The rubber band may be really stretchy and flexible, or it could be brittle and snap easily.  You don't know how flexible or brittle your rubber band is until you try stretching it.

Although you can usually tell when you should stop ""stretching"" (exerting yourself) as your anxiety level rises, sometimes you stretch it too fast and/or the rubber band is just so brittle that it's already too late and it ends up ""snapping"" (you get a panic attack).  Other days, you could be doing the exact same activity under the exact same conditions and it won't really affect you; that's when you have a ""flexible"" rubber band.

I would also agree that the more often your rubber band snaps, the more likely you are to ""be given"" brittle rubber bands on subsequent days.  Usually though, I end up having panic attacks only on the days that I'm off from work, because I don't have a routine for days off like I do for work days.  But it's also my fault because although I realize creating a routine would help my anxiety, I'm stubborn and choose not to because I feel like I shouldn't *have* to (why should I force myself to stick to some arbitrary schedule when I have no commitments or obligations?)."
bloutchbleue,fdq0930,t1_fdpq7iq,"God, I'm so sorry you went through that. That was really brave of you. Congratulations for being sober. 
That's perfectly normal it's gonna take time. It's important to remember that you just have to do the best you can everyday, and sometimes your best is just waking up, eating, and that's all, and that's perfectly ok, you are slowly recharging.
What's important is understanding/ listening to what we really need and respect it, no matter what other people think of tell you, because you are the only one who's gonna live in your shoes and go through your day. 
Congratulations again, I wish you and your daughter the best. :)"
bloutchbleue,fdq0hnd,t1_fdpzzv3,"You are welcome. 
I like that sentence that says that you have to do your best everyday, but also accept that sometimes your best is juste waking up, eating/taking a shower, and that's ok. Everyone is different, we have to accept and make peace with it, it gets easier when you understand and respect your own rythm. 
If you need it today, or any other day, I'm sending you all the positive thoughts I have."

gjenoppfinne,fdo76ph,t3_emckin,"YES This happens all the time after hard work deadlines that drive up my anxiety. I'll take about a week of recharging. 

Exercise is key for me because it builds up my confidence and gets my energy up. Also, drinking A LOT of water over the course of a day (sometimes I'll drink a half gallon, sometimes a full gallon) and I will wake up the next day feeling totally revitalized."
karmaceutical,fdodyya,t3_emckin,"Yes, absolutely. Anxiety is incredibly taxing on the body. It literally burns calories (which is part of the reason why many who go on anti-anxiety medication experience weight gain).

graceful_ant_falcon,fdoxpmh,t3_emckin,"I get this pretty much every week. My classes are very difficult and I end up spending my whole day at school, doing homework, and then studying for tests. I finish around 8 or 9 pm and just go to sleep after that. I do that everyday and then on the weekends I lay in bed doing nothing because i don‚Äôt have the energy to get up. 

This was actually last semester and my classes are easier now, so I can‚Äôt change anything even if I wanted to."

The whole month of November and December I just push through all the activities, the shopping, family visiting etc. After Christmas is over I crash hard.

I've had a lot going on over the last year or so (big life and personal changes) which made my base level anxiety higher. Then the few months before Christmas at work were insane and even though we had two weeks off, I still feel drained and overwhelmed.

Fingers crossed it doesn't last too much longer."
zhouston76,fdq0atg,t3_emckin,Yes. I feel like I care so much about that one thing for so long my other priorities go to shit because fuck it. At least it's not THAT.

Pictocheat,fdqtiqa,t3_emckin,"I thought these were relapses.  It doesn't necessarily even have to have been a rough day; sometimes my anxiety will just get under my skin to a greater degree for some reason and then I'll feel lethargic for the next week or two.  But even after the lethargy goes away, I'll still be more on-edge than usual."

bot_bot_bot,fe1v7jb,t1_fe109st,"Can I ask what meds they are?? Have they had any bad side effects? I've heard some stories that anxiety meds dull the mind, that a lot of people don't like who they are on them. Your experience sounds different, I'd be grateful for your insights when you have some time."
trIeNe_mY_Best,fe2pqpg,t1_fe1v7jb,"I'm clearly not the user you were asking, but I can give you my experience with anxiety meds. When I first started experiencing anxiety symptoms, I had no idea what was causing them, so I went to my primary care doc. He prescribed Ativan. It would work pretty much immediately, and although the anxiety didn't go away completely, it took the edge off and I was able to focus on everyday things (like work) instead of what triggered my anxiety. However, Ativan is a benzo, so definitely no recommended for long term use. Also, you can't drink alcohol with it, otherwise you're at serious risk of stopping breathing. The only side effect I noticed was when I stopped using it, I had some pretty bad headaches for a day or two. 

I realized I needed to go see a therapist/psychiatrist to work on my anxiety, so I made an appointment. I worked with the therapist, and learning grounding techniques and talking to someone was very helpful. I finally was able to get in to see the psychiatrist and start talking about meds. She prescribed Prozac (which takes several weeks to take effect), and hydroxizine (works immediately, I can take as needed, and is basically like really strong Benadryl). Prozac has overall been pretty good for me. I'm much, MUCH calmer, I don't have the physical symptoms of anxiety that I used to get, and I haven't really noticed a change personality-wise other than decreased anxiety. Yay! But, I have noticed that I tremble slightly (kind of like slight muscle fatigue) since the med started kicking in. Also, lately ive been waking up at night every 1-1.5 hours, falling back asleep, and repeating, so I'll talk to my psychiatrist to ask if it could be due to Prozac (but I'm also working on ruling out other possibilities in the meantime). So far, I personally decided the good effects of Prozac outweighed the bad effects for me (although this possible sleep issue could be a deal breaker). I took the Hydroxizine a whopping two times. The first time I tried it, I was having a full blown panic attack, so I took a whole tablet. I've never done recreational drugs, so I've never been high before, but I'm guessing that how I felt with that full tablet was what it is like to be high. I didn't have a care in the world while the drug took it's effect. No other side effects to report. The next time I had a panic attack, I tried scaling it down to half a tablet, but it didn't seem to do anything. That's all I can say about hydroxyzine. 

I definitely recommend seeing some professionals to deal with anxiety. I've had a very positive experience with it! I'd especially recommend seeing a therapist and talking about your feelings rather than just taking meds alone. Hope this helps!"
hitbug,fe2peah,t1_fe1v7jb,"I wouldn‚Äôt say they exactly dull the mind, but I‚Äôve definitely noticed my mind being a bit foggy at times. Like if I‚Äôm trying to think of a word/how to spell something my mind will just go blank for a few seconds. But other than they haven‚Äôt changed my personality whatsoever, besides being happier of course."
apatheticdude44,fe318wt,t1_fe1v7jb,"To chime in, I was put in Cipralex (or lexapro), and though it increased my anxiety for a week or 2, after about 2 weeks my anxiety subsided. They gave me headaches for a few days, as well as increased sweating, but everything went away. I was already dealing with anergic depression (not really sad or suicidal, but just felt dead inside, numb to emotions), so I‚Äôm not sure if the meds caused any more of that. For a few months after starting, I did feel happier and a little more positive. The only side effect which annoyed me was sexual dysfunction. 

Unfortunately, my anxiety came back after 2 years, and I was prescribed Wellbutrin. A lot of people think Wellbutrin isn‚Äôt good for anxiety, as it can cause more anxiety in some, but like the cipralex, the anxiety was a startup side effect, and the anxiety mostly went away. I still kind of feel like the anergic depression is still there. And the sexual side effects are a tiiiiiiny bit better. 

But don‚Äôt be afraid of meds. They really have dragged me out of my worst times with anxiety."
bot_bot_bot,fe3lfyf,t1_fe2pqpg,"I've been seeing a therapist for over a year now. There's been so much stress in my life the past year I just can't keep on top of the anxiety.

This is not who I am normally, but the last year or two have been a fucking onslaught of problems for me, some of my own making, some not. But I'm getting to the point now where I think I might need medical help to keep on top of things, but I'd really rather not take meds."
ShylyFrustrating,fe62y7d,t1_fe2pqpg,Hey I have been on Prozac for 4 months now. I do suffer from anxiety. What‚Äôs even worse that I recently got a job now so I feel anxious every time when I faced new challenges new environment meeting new people etc. I also have social anxiety disorder as well a bit of OCD and NPD symptoms as well. I take 40mg of prozac everyday. Every night and so then I keep waking up in the middle of the night checking clock and then going back to sleep.
bot_bot_bot,fe3lrqg,t1_fe2peah,"Thanks, good to hear."
bot_bot_bot,fe3lmpf,t1_fe318wt,Thanks for your input!
trIeNe_mY_Best,fe3p0k0,t1_fe3lfyf,"That's great that you're seeing a therapist! Anxiety is no joke and really tough. I've been there before with feeling like I was on top of it, and then having panic attacks shortly after. I also remember feeling like it was always something new coming up, and it got to the point I was having trouble getting out of bed.

Yeah, I get not wanting to take meds. Meds work differently for different people. I was really afraid of the meds making my mental health worse than it was. Then, even after I was given a prescription, I kind of freaked out because I read through all of the possible side effects, and some of them are pretty serious. It took me several days to work up the courage to try it. But I just kept thinking that ""Something stressful happens, and then I deal with it, and I'm okay. Then, something else happens and I try to deal with it, and then I can get over it. But it keeps happening over and over again, and *I can't make it stop*."" That thought that I couldn't make it stop on my own is what pushed me to try meds. But those are my own thoughts, and I understand meds aren't for everyone. 

But getting medical help is still a good idea. There are a lot of other medical scenarios that could be causing your anxiety. A doctor could call for a blood test to see if your Vitamin D or B12 levels are out of whack and causing the anxiety. Or it might be a bit of a thyroid thing. (All those things can affect your mood.) That way, if that is a cause of your anxiety, you could get it treated and not take medications specifically meant for mental health.

I wish you the best! Anxiety is awful, and I definitely wouldn't wish it on anyone!"
trIeNe_mY_Best,fe668s2,t1_fe62y7d,"Starting a new job is always stressful, but adding anxiety to it must make it quite the struggle! That's the same dosage I'm taking, and I'm glad to hear someone else has issues sleeping. There was a period where every single night I'd wake up between 1-2:30 AM. Then, I had to have an endoscope done. So it seemed like the anesthesia for that sort of ""reset"" my internal clock, and for a while, I was back to normal. Then I started waking up every couple of hours. I'll definitely talk to my psychiatrist about this, but I like the way Prozac has helped calm my anxiety. So, I'm torn between trying something new to get better sleep or keep it the same, but feel better mentally."

You've read my mind, this is EXACTLY the thought I had a day or two ago.    
My struggles have been pretty severe lately, it's not every day 'normal' things that are setting me off. I had to take sick leave from work for a few weeks because things got so bad.     
   
It's so, so frustrating. 

> A doctor could call for a blood test to see if your Vitamin D or B12 levels are out of whack and causing the anxiety. Or it might be a bit of a thyroid thing. (All those things can affect your mood.) 

I just had blood tests last month, everything came back clean there."
ShylyFrustrating,fe6nr8l,t1_fe668s2,Yeah man roger that. Prozac has definitely helped my anxiety and had made me more calmer as well. But if I‚Äôm not wrong the main side effects of prozac is insomnia glad we don‚Äôt have that. But I am able to fall asleep better which is a HUGE plus for me. I always had to battle my inner demons before I fall asleep thus delaying my sleep cycle everyday longer. I do want to increase my dosage though next time when I meet my psychiatrist. I am glad to know that you experience the same symptoms as well. Anyways take care of your health and mind as well. Have a good day.
trIeNe_mY_Best,fe4rzpy,t1_fe43c9r,"If you haven't already (I understand that you may have already), be sure to bring up that cycle of having something stressful happen, getting through it, then having something come up over and over again with your therapist. When I brought it up to my own, that's when I feel we really started making progress and trying to find ways to break that cycle. I felt comforted when you said you had those same thoughts, and I hope that knowing you are not alone also brings you some comfort. Having stressful situations come up and dealing with anxiety on top of it (and also triggering it) just makes everything SO much worse. I don't blame you for being so frustrated.

That's good that you had the blood test done! That means that you can rule out that as being a cause, and it's a solid step forward! Perhaps you can talk to a psychiatrist not with the intention of starting meds, but with the intention to gather as much information on meds as you can get. Be honest with the doctor, and tell them why you don't want to try meds. Talk about the pros and cons of different meds, what the possible side effects are, how long they take to have an effect on patients, and basically whatever else is on your mind about the meds (also, if you have any relatives on any meds for mental health, try to find out what they are taking and if it did/n't work).

Keeping hanging in there. It sounds like you're really working hard to manage your anxiety, so don't give up! You deserve to be happy, too!"

hitbug,fe2oco0,t3_eni3c5,"Yay! After 8 years of avoiding getting help for depression/anxiety, I finally started meds about 5 months ago. 

Having days without anxiety feels so amazing!! It‚Äôs like being in the best mood ever. Some days I definitely do struggle, even with the meds,  but I feel like they give me the ability to work through things better and have a logical mindset when it comes to ‚Äútomorrow will be a better day‚Äù."
localsxonly,emwmv8,top_level,"Basically, it allows me to take my exams in a separate area and have some extra time. It makes me feel like I don‚Äôt deserve to be here, which blows because I worked hard to get here. I feel like I‚Äôm also screwing the other students because anxiety exists in everyone, just in varying degrees. To be fair I was evaluated, which is what enabled me to have these accommodations, but I just feel weird about it. Has anyone else felt like this before?"
SureNarwhal,fds5j6s,t3_emwmv8,"Yes, although not in relation to my anxiety.  I hope my experience helps you.

When I was in university, I developed a medical condition that required accommodation.  Prior to this happening, I hadn't needed any accommodation.  My anxiety at the time was not the sort that requires accommodation in an academic environment.

It was very hard for me to cope with.  You see, I was an excellent student, an over-achiever, the sort that provided help rather than asked for it.  And then, suddenly, I did need help.  And I felt a lot like you, I think.

I felt ashamed to need help when others didn't need it.  I felt like it wasn't fair for me to have help when others didn't.  I felt like my accomplishments weren't worth as much.  And I felt the usual anger and unfairness that I had become unwell in the first place.  Why me, right?

I think that these are pretty common feelings, especially because of the prejudice society has towards people who need accommodation.  People often say it is an advantage for people with medical conditions (or really anything requiring accommodation) to get that help, like it's cheating.  Even if you don't expressly believe it, it's easy to internalize that if you're exposed to that.  And if you then develop a medical condition that needs accommodation, it can cause a lot of self-hatred.

But it's not actually true.  It's making things fair.  And this is what I eventually came to understand.  When a person has a condition, a disability, it is not their fault and even if it was, they shouldn't be denied the ability to participate in society because of it.  

Having accommodations to make sure that people like us can do well at university isn't screwing the other students, it is making sure that it is fair for everyone.  It's no different than if someone breaks their arm and can't write, they would be allowed to have someone write down their answers for them on the exam rather than just fail them because they can't use their arm.

I hope this helps.  It took me years to figure this out and sometimes I still feel bad.  Let's just say, people can be assholes."

throwawayadvice32179,fdw7l2t,t1_fdslsbj,"My advice, which you can take with a grain of salt but I felt like I related to you a bit, is that if you don‚Äôt push yourself out of your comfort zone as mortifying as it can be, you will only get worse. I berly got through college because on my last month of my senior year I dropped out because I couldn‚Äôt give a presentation in front of people. I didn‚Äôt finish until 4 years later when I could complete the class online. Fast forward to last week I had a lunch meeting with my intimidating boss and was so nervous I puked in the bathroom and left work and had to reschedule. On the day of the reschedule I was sweating through my shirt and it was a lunch, that‚Äôs it, but i got through it loosened up a little and I felt a wave of relief. I had racing thoughts and panic streaming through me but it actually went well. Now if I never went through that lunch I would have never felt that sense of relief and accomplishment as stupid as it sounds. So make your self uncomfortable to the extent you can because that‚Äôs the only way you will make progress you don‚Äôt want to be taking exams in a separate room for the rest of your life. And then what‚Äôs after that? It won‚Äôt get better. It‚Äôs like working out, if you want rewards it‚Äôs all about repetition of shit you don‚Äôt want to do until it‚Äôs second nature. Good luck."

SassyMillie,fdsqpyg,t3_emwmv8,"Special accommodations wasn't even a thing when I went to college. I'm so glad it's available for people who need it!

I do get where you are coming from. I have recently started seeing a psychiatrist for my anxiety and related conditions. When I've gone I am asking myself ""WHY?! Why am I here? I'm not that bad, why am I wasting her time when I should be able to figure this out on my own?"" You see, even though I am paying (very well) out of pocket for her services I just don't really feel like I deserve them. It's a struggle for me because I do want to get better. 

I've also had years of PTSD from being a survivor in a mass shooting. I was SO uncomfortable every single day at work because my back was to the doorway. That was the standard configuration for work cubicles and if people asked for a change, they were looked down upon and scorned (behind their backs). So I never did request a change, but I should have. I totally should have and my work life would have been so much easier. If only I had a time machine. :)"
imgonnadieyoung,fdstts6,t3_emwmv8,"To make things short- you are not taking accommodations away from anyone else and deserve them just as much as the next person. If all else fails, realize that you would not have been given accommodations unless it would benefit you. Best of luck and you deserve them for your hard work!"
Daycar90,fdsweon,t3_emwmv8,"While I‚Äôve struggled with anxiety my whole life, university was when I first sought help for it. The doctors in health services at my university were so amazing, right away I was told if I ever was having a hard time with deadlines and getting assignments done to come in and they would give me a note no questions asked. Even after being told this I still struggled taking advantage of this, I would be up all night before a due date trying to get things done and being having full blown panic attacks and still be convinced I didn‚Äôt need the note, generally wasn‚Äôt until the early hours of the morning that I would finally admit to myself it either wasn‚Äôt getting done or if it was it wasn‚Äôt going to be the work that I knew I was capable of doing. Looking back I wish I had taken advantage of all the services more because I think I would have been so much less anxious and therefore might have gotten to need them less instead of being constantly stressed and anxious about the idea of being stressed and anxious (anxiety spiral much!). So basically my advice is take advantage of all the services, allow yourself some room to breathe, university is tough enough already, don‚Äôt make it harder than it has to be."
Mlhyns,fdsbm46,t3_emwmv8,"Oh I know your feeling so well. I also had accommodations and felt so bad when I told my friends about it. Actually, because of anxiety I didn‚Äôt stay in university ..

Die4yourgovernment,fdtigh1,t3_emwmv8,"When I reminisce 10 years back, I really regret not utilizing those resources that were rightfully available to me. 

I thought similarly regarding unworthiness, or maybe it was a bit of denial and humiliation. Nonetheless, there are many more students out there that don‚Äôt understand the complications or obstacles that people have due to anxiety, panic attacks, ptsd..etc

The fact that institutions have identified these extraneous variables which affect the way we learn and test is absolutely awesome and mindful.

Be humble to yourself and seek assistance and run with it."

I felt the same way when my school put me in special ed classes. I mean, these kids were really, really special; and I would cry asking myself why am I here, these guys really need it and here is this asshole (me) sitting here. You‚Äôre not alone l!

Unnamed-Visitor,fdt0l7i,t3_emwmv8,"I had this problem back in high school. I was put on the IEP list (basically tier 1 special needs kids) which got me access to a study room, a tablet for schoolwork, extra exam time, etc. I always felt like I wasn't deserving of it, because the reason I was put on it was because my 8th grade teacher realized I couldn't do schoolwork as fast as other students, I couldn't focus the same as other students, and my motivation was too unpredictable to put any reliance on. To me, it feels like I was handed this set of tools as a reward for having a laziness issue and anxiety."

I felt the same guilt because anxiety is something that you can have yet still doubt you have it, but speaking to accommodations advisors has helped me feel more justified! And when my classmates ask where I am during tests, I just answer them honestly that I have testing accommodations! People will be a lot more understanding than you think, especially professors (and also it‚Äôs the law). 

Good luck with your journey, I hope accommodations will help you!"
tryingtofindgoodsubs,fdt1w8c,t3_emwmv8,"Hey. I actually started using accommodations for exams in my second year of law school. I went through undergrad without them and was fairly academically successful with almost a 4.0 GPA.

I got into a top law school and I was doing fine (average to above average). Then I had some things come up. I had a head injury and had to take some time off school. When I came back I wasn't the same. I lost confidence in myself and my abilities. 

I tried writing my exams but could not finish on time. My brain just can't operate at the pace it used to. 

The ticking clock running down would make my brain go blank. I would then start having panic attacks and have to leave the exams. After going from a B+ average to a C+ average I spoke to the office. I got my time and a half accommodations and my quiet room. 

With accommodations on exams  I got back up to my B+ average. I didn't do better than that. I needed the extra time to not go into panic mode. 

Anxiety disorder is a disability. While having a bit of anxiety is normal, having so much that it impacts your performance is not. If your anxiety ruins any chance of you to function your best then it is not normal anxiety. Do you not think you would perform better without anxiety? 

The extra time and quiet room are there to put you on even footing with your classmates, not to give you an advantage.

I could get a B+ average before I was crippled with panic attacks. With them, I could not."

However it was my school therapist who referred me, I mentioned that I don't feel like I should get these treatments when there are others who are worst off then me. My therapist said yes, there are those who have more serious problems than me, and yes you've gone this long without these assists but it couldn't hurt to help make your remaining semesters better. After all those who want the help get it, and there are still many more people who actually need the help but do not know they qualify for it so use it to help you so you can help others in the future. Why struggle more when you can help ease some of the stress in your life 

So use it and learn from it, maybe in the future you'll learn a new strategy to help your anxiety. Just going to the appointment and hearing from the disability service's councilor helped me realize I'm not alone and all of my worries are valid when using this service"

maybe this is too hard for you to understand emotionally because it is a abstract concept. It helps me to imagine that I have a big rock on my back rather than anxiety. Imagine having that on your back when you are taking a test. others have rocks too, but you have a 40 pound rock when others have a 5 pound rock.  don't let others make you believe that they have the same problems as you.

BornAgainVirginian,fdtwp7p,t3_emwmv8,"Hey, I signed up in my undergraduate for neurological issues that were testable and apparent on brain scans and such. I had a visible disability (seizures).

Your disability is just as valid as mine, and as long as you aren't maliciously trying to game the system, are honest about what would help, and work with the people there to guide you through it all -- I see no reason you don't deserve these accommodations.

You know what's really unfair? Having anxiety that is so bad you can't succeed. The same with any other disability, you deserve an equitable shot at things."

Satanz-Daughter,fdu1a4d,t3_emwmv8,"I also receive accommodations at university for my anxiety.

We just don‚Äôt get the grades we deserve if we test in regular environments because anxiety limits us so much. Everyone gets anxiety that‚Äôs a fact, but accommodations are aimed at those of us who fall on the side of the anxiety bell curve that lowers academic performance rather than enhancing it."
garamasala,fdudaq9,t3_emwmv8,"I work for a disability department in a university. It's not an unusual way to feel, I have known blind people feel like a burden for needing sighted guides. Anxiety exists in everyone to an extent but it is not debilitating for everyone. The people who assessed you would have been experienced professionals and would have only given the recommendations as part of a reasonable adjustment within (usually) national guidelines. Your university just want to level the playing field so you can achieve your full potential. Trust that they know what they are doing, exam adjustments are not given lightly."
Razirra,fduejzg,t3_emwmv8,"Literally the point of testing is to show how much you learn. Without accommodations, testing instead shows that yes, you are more anxious than the general public. Everyone has anxiety but the difficulty and format of tests has already evolved to suit them- but not you. 

Insert any other condition here. 

You‚Äôre preserving the integrity of learning and testing when you use accommodations. And if you‚Äôre worried about undiagnosed people, well, using testing accommodations makes it more normalized and more people are likely to be offered the option in future as they streamline the service due to you using it."
ImAnIcicle,fdur8ed,t3_emwmv8,"I didn't do this when I went back to college 3 years ago, and I wish I had. I got through it but barely.

It was horrendously stressful and I've been out and working for 6+ months now and am still recovering from it.

Don't feel bad about this. It will be a benefit to you. Take advantage of it. I know it's hard but try not to compare yourself to others using the service. It's okay to ask for help. It's okay to use the resources available to you. Take care."

Having accommodations does in no way invalidate that. I was given some accommodations during my PhD for anxiety and dyslexia. The university knows how much space it needs and schedules accordingly. Every exam diet I would always have students who were given 1-on-1 invigilation because of anxiety. For the record, I was not told why they needed it, but many were upfront about it. I did my best to provide a relaxing environment and accommodate the student. It was not my place to judge, just to help you get through the exam. Your invigilator should be the same. Their job is to ensure that you are able to take your exam in a comfortable environment. 

On a very selfish note: 1-on-1 invigilation was the best because I could do my own work while the student was taking their exam. I was super productive."
gene_parmesan_PEYE,fduvt5b,t3_emwmv8,"I used disability services for my neurological condition and I wish I had of used it in my physically healthy days when I was struggling with PTSD, MDD and Anxiety.

For example, I have an alternative exams which means I don't do it with 100 other students, I do it in a small classroom with a few other people (never been around more than 10) who also have different exam conditions for their own reasons. I used to be pouring with sweat and so anxious before those ""normal"" exams and it would definitely affect my concentration and memory recall. I would give anything to redo those exams in a calmer setting where I can function better mentally.

But you‚Äôd never be able to tell something is wrong with me.  At least not unless I was limping.  I got a cap on my hours cause if I‚Äôm on my feet to long I‚Äôll flare.  Also I wear tennis shoes and can‚Äôt lift anything really.  I‚Äôve worked there 5 years and we‚Äôd have 12 hr shifts every Saturday and then sometimes 3-4 days in a row for holidays.  Exhausting and since we are commission paid, we‚Äôd be there longer if the customer required it.  Rough stuff.  Most my coworkers were asking me lots of questions in the beginning but now they don‚Äôt.  It took my stubborn ass a couple months to get myself to turn in the paperwork.  In the end I thought well, I‚Äôm not going to get better so I might want to kinda take it easier on myself.  Plus I have no control when I‚Äôll not be able to get out of bed from a flare."
austrohorologium,fdw5aqs,t3_emwmv8,"That's anxiety for you. There's no bottom in that endless well of inadequacy.

Just try to roll with it. Remember that there are people in the world who are the nastiest, most ignorant assholes and that they get everything served in a silver tray because they won at being born in wealth.

Meanwhile, you just got a little help because we're wired weirdly, beyond your control, so all things considered it isn't as unfair as unfair things can actually be."
ADSwasAISloveDKS,fdw9ke6,t3_emwmv8,"I wish I had applied for disability last semester. I went from As and Bs to Cs because my anxiety has been an issue. I would have failed one of my classes if I didnt talk to the professor before the final about my problems and how its prevented me from coming to class. Luckily he understood as he went through something similar and gave me a couple points on my final grade. Come test time it would have been amazing to be away from it all, I probably would have performed better. I would have also gotten better grades if my absences caused by anxiety were dismissed or excused by they weren't because I didnt arrange disabilities. 

Just because our struggle isnt visible, doesnt mean it isnt real. You're doing the right thing by seeking disabilities help and know you're not taking away from services other get, just making it more manageable for yourself. Also, they wouldnt have approved it if it wasnt valid and necessary. Please take advantage of it, I wish I had."
KnifexCalledxLust,fdwawol,t3_emwmv8,"In high school, I had similar services because I had depression, crippling anxiety and ADHD. I had a special teacher that I took exams with and help me essential organize schoolwork. Just having someone re word questions, not having a time limit and being able to move around if I needed made a world of difference. 

However, when I went to college, I did not follow through with continuing these services. I ended up dropping out of college within the first yeae because I just could not cope on my own. I really regret it. 

Don't let other people make you feel unworthy. If those services help you, focus on that. Your well being is the most important thing. Best of luck in college!"
Cheilosia,fe6ez74,t3_emwmv8,"I've worked in a place providing these services AND I have generalized anxiety. You are entirely worthy of these services! I'm so happy that our university offers them. Yes anxiety is a spectrum and totally normal for everyone sometimes, but at a certain point it becomes a barrier. If anything more students should have access to these services and by using them you're not taking them from others, you're proving that there's a need for them!"
JD-Anderson,fdsocqh,t3_emwmv8,"Screw em! If it helps you, do it."
dampgrandpa,enpe31,top_level,"Never really listened to metal music that much before but somehow it just calms me down when I feel physically uneasy and fidgety. Sometimes I get the urge to start like running around the house and so on but then I just pop on some aggressive music, such as metal, which I've actually grown to like, and after a few songs I no longer feel extra fidgety. Figured it might help someone in a similar situation to try it.

&#x200B;

To be more specific, I tend to go for something with screaming, melodic metal and other subgenres similar to it really don't work on me. Hope this works for other people too."
LostHero13,fe3gk9o,t3_enpe31,"I've been studying the effects of music on mental health for awhile now. It's not just metal that can do this but really any genre that you enjoy. It helps break the cycle of anxiety and makes you brain release the happy feel good chemicals into your system. 

But metal has been shown to help mental health in several studies. One report found that metalheads tend to be happier than fans of other genres. This likely has to do with the connection the music forms. Metal bands love their fans and interact more with them. The fans form a sort of bond through music. 

Plus its hard to feel anxious when headbanging lol"
Hertoc,fe4mtdq,t1_fe3gk9o,Headbanging destroys anxiety neurons.
arcinva,fe5dne2,t1_fe3gk9o,"When I've been filled with negative emotions, I've found that those hard genres help me get those emotions out.  Like people who enjoy exercise talk about sweating it out... only with metal it's like screaming it out or headbanging it out or air drumming it out or whatever."
Miss_Doggie,fe5q064,t1_fe3gk9o,I agree. I feel like metal helps me release energy with the energy of the music. Similar to cutting but not as negative.
joostdemen,fe5rnsu,t1_fe3gk9o,Hey i am really interested on this topic and how other really agressive music goes with that. When im anxious and i put on some uptempo hardcore i really really calm down! A song i could put on: https://youtu.be/Ce3fnu3eLKU

I like Metallica. Pantera, fear factory and volbeat"
dampgrandpa,fe3ao3g,t1_fe39vvr,"I'm more into nu-metal and melodic death metal. My top three bands I like are **Infected Rain**, **Jinjer** and **Arch Enemy**. They've all got that fast paced aggressive tone and they involve lots of screaming but also some clean vocals. Also love their lyrics."
skarbux,fe6dqeo,t1_fe3ao3g,In Flames and Architects do it for me
lmfj3737,fe3y11o,t3_enpe31,Killswitch Engage is incredibly powerful and uplifting. Knowing the guys behind the music are even nicer and more supportive makes this a favorite to listen to when down. Music can help heal for sure.

Joy218,fe5pc6p,t1_fe5akse,My take on this is that ‚Äúcalming‚Äù music doesn‚Äôt distract me enough from my intrusive anxious thinking.  And frankly puts more pressure on me to calm down! We all know how that never works.  Metal takes me out of my own head.

Its so cathartic to me to listen to music with screaming, its like I'm letting out all of my troubles through the music. Btw I highly recommend Opeth to you, Mikael Akerfeldt has some of the best screams but also the voice of an angel and they are quite melodic too."

tinkerer98765,febmlv0,t3_enpe31,"I‚Äôm so glad you posted this. I don‚Äôt normally listen to metal but there are a few bands I really enjoy like Killswitch Engage and Atreyu (I guess more metal core) and after a morning of anxiety over something I could not identify, I saw your post and decided to listen to metal this morning at work. It worked like a charm and I think there is something to say about using different genres of music to break anxiety cycles. I tend to listen to the same stuff within the same general genre (alt rock/folk) on repeat until I get really bored with it and then just start over with whatever band I listened to at the beginning of the cycle. Metal is such a drastically different genre and it helps that I actually like the music. Definitely will be listening to metal for the next couple weeks."
Azelea239,fe3yemk,t3_enpe31,Should listen too the DOOM soundtrack. Its pretty amazing

I noticed, I used to listen to a lot more aggressive and ""loud"" music, when I was still in school. I never really listened to anything else at that time.   


But for me, I figured it was more about releasing stress and frustration through music than really calming down. I haven't really been calm then at all."
nebulochaotic_,fe4wxk7,t3_enpe31,I found a metal playlist on Spotify (I think it's literally the first one that comes up when you search) and it has honestly been my saving grace when I get that weird ADHD random aggression or when sensory overload is making me feel angry.

YellowR1,fdm3bdm,t3_elvyuy,"Yes! I‚Äôve been single for over a year now but I‚Äôm very comfortable with this single life. But sometimes I just feel the need to squeeze something and feel physically surrounded. So I have tons of pillows I hug to sleep and I just got a weighted blanket!

I was just all alone because i couldn‚Äôt organize anything and I don‚Äôt have much friends left.

olivialikesfries,em6n94,top_level,"My journey with guided meditation is all thanks to the app Headspace. It has truly changed my life and I recommend it to everyone I know. Back in high school, I missed months of my senior year because I suffered from panic attacks while sitting in the classroom. Now I‚Äôm in my senior year of college, and thanks to meditation/ mindfulness (and of course proper medication) I now have the skills to effectively deal with my anxiety. I never thought this would be possible. Today was a good day. :)

Edit: omg someone gave me my first award, thank you stranger!"

apathetic666johnson,fdxwk5u,t1_fdxuy4e,thanks! I usually can draw slightly better but my anxiety is definitely shaking me up.
jmr324,fdzo390,t1_fdxwk5u,I really like the drawings
Mousekavich,fe2ilzx,t1_fdxwk5u,"That anxiety infuses the work, raising the quality due to the purpose of the work. After all its purpose was to express what anxiety feels like, right?"
PiscesJoy,fdylg6d,t3_enccir,"Wow I totally get this. I feel like when I am just out and about, doing nothing out of the ordinary, I‚Äôm still doing something wrong and people think I‚Äôm weird or annoying or in their way and everyone else is effortlessly totally normal and chill.

Mousekavich,fe2inqd,t1_fe0kw18,Therapy
PiscesJoy,fe3f1xb,t1_fe0kw18,"Yeah unfortunately it‚Äôs not a simple solution.

lfr6,fe351hj,t3_enccir,How old are you?
apathetic666johnson,fe3epfh,t1_fe351hj,27. Why?
lfr6,fe3lvjq,t1_fe3epfh,"I used to feel like that when I was young, maybe from my 17 to 28-29, I think it's a matter of maturity, I love this quote, maybe it'll help you:


""When you‚Äôre 20, you care what everyone thinks, when you‚Äôre 40 you stop caring what everyone thinks, when you‚Äôre 60, you realize no one was ever thinking about you in the first place,"""
apathetic666johnson,fe3tn1p,t1_fe3lvjq,"I wish it were that simple, but it's more of a fear of not blending in. I was bullied and outcasted for being different my entire life, and as an adult I can't shake those ingrained fears that something is wrong with me. It's caused me to feel like something is wrong with me and there's nothing I can do to change it, and I will never be accepted by the village/tribe/society. So I don't actually care if an individual doesn't like me, but I do worry about the whole society. I want to blend in with the rest of the people to show I'm trustworthy and friendly despite how different I am. My nervousness has frequently made people uncomfortable, because who else would be nervous but someone doing something suspicious or wrong? So people become uncomfortable and fearful of me, just causing a situation to occur from nothing, which increases my anxiety for being around strangers in the future. In short anxiety has driven me insane."
lfr6,fe4kzlu,t1_fe3tn1p,"I know is not that simple, didn't want to imply it was. I'm not a psychologist, so I don't want to say anything that may worsen your situation.  

Don't blend, as simple as that, just don't worry about that, I know everybody says this but now that I'm turning 40 I'm finally understanding it, look for yourself, get to know yourself, what you like, what moves you, believe me, I'm finally getting there, I have a small shop that I'm really sick of it, have had it for 15 years and now I'm just keeping it because it feeds me, but it is the reason why I'm so anxious and spend with this awful feeling 90% of the time. But I'm getting to know myself and just started this project that gets me working even until 2am, but I'm delighted, for real. Right now I'm working on it while I was thinking what to answer you

I know what you mean about making people uncomfortable, I've been there and yeah, its sickening, but little by little I have found my people, I have 2 good friends, that's all I need, really don't care about society. I even feel uncomfortable around my family (mother, father and brothers) so I don't really look for them and just spend time with my wife and son.

Don't worry to much, for real, things do get better with time, just don't expect to thing change in a day, it doesn't work like that.

What do you like to do, do you have hobbies?"
4_am_,emb5oj,top_level,"I've never really thought about it before, but I've noticed that I get extremely tired when I'm particularly anxious or stressed about something. Like sometimes feeling stressed makes me wired, but that's a different kind of stress. This is like an 'I just want to melt into the floor and not exist anymore' feeling of anxiety. I got it really badly once when having a long chat about ending a relationship, for example. It's like my body starts shutting down or something. Now I think of it, it seems to be whenever I'm in the process of making important decisions. Is this common?"
Rohsalina,fdnp5am,t3_emb5oj,"Yes. It happens to me, too. Sometimes the tiredness almost makes me feel distant/disconnected from the world."
4_am_,fdnxwyd,t1_fdnp5am,"100%. I sometimes find myself sitting at my computer watching something, but it turns to double vision, because I'm just like staring into 'space' through the screen. Feels like I'm in a trance. And then I'll snap out of it and have to skip back 2 minutes on the YouTube video."
kspecstylie,fdnxann,t3_emb5oj,"Yes. Anxiety/depression takes a lot of energy out of you. Through the worst years, I did find myself constantly just wanting to sleep it all away because that's easier than sitting like a vegetable, staring at the wall for 4 hours+. I had no energy to do anything else but just sit there, and internalize it all after work. It also has done the opposite and cause insomnia, as someone stated here. The past couple of years, I've worked really hard to understand/manage/lessen my mental issues, and it's managed to decrease the impact of that. Actually, now I just take that energy and try to apply it to something that will make me happy (ex: watch a show, play games, etc)."
4_am_,fdo0kol,t1_fdnxann,"Yea I have insomnia too, the tiredness never works in my favour once I actually want to sleep. What helped you the most?"
kspecstylie,fdo2s6k,t1_fdo0kol,"In the beginning, I got an anxiety blanket. I read about how it is based on deep touch therapy, like the good feeling you get when being hugged. I gave it a try and immediately noticed an improvement during the first couple of uses. It was weird at first because you slowly get this numbing feeling, but then you feel calm and still. It made me calm enough to really feel tired and I ended up taking a nap. 

Aside from that, I also saw a counselor to try and understand my anxiety and depression, and found out that a lot of it stemmed from the fact that I am adopted (never met my biological father). That explained a lot. From there I read a lot about cognitive behavioral therapy, deep breathing, everything really...to try and find the right mix of what works best whenever shit hits the fan. For me deep breathing and getting back into meditation and mindfulness has been most beneficial. I also have been more open to family and friends about my issues because for the longest time I held it all in and no one knew for over 10 years. Now that they know, I‚Äôve gotten more understanding and support from my ‚Äútribe‚Äù, especially my boyfriend and family who adopted me. It‚Äôs a layered process but I took it step by step....eventually I started seeing and feeling solid progress. Of course I hit bumps in the road, but the bad days aren‚Äôt as bad and long as they used to be. This may be a lot, but I hope it helps you find what works best. <3"
4_am_,fdo6bjj,t1_fdo2s6k,"No that's really helpful. I'd never heard of an anxiety blanket but it sounds good, thank you!"
l1r0,fdo8uyp,t1_fdo2s6k,Is that the same as a weighted blanket? When exactly do you use it and how? I just have it on my bed right now as a regular blanket.
kspecstylie,fdo6z04,t1_fdo6bjj,For sure! I think they‚Äôre technically called gravity blankets but I‚Äôm sure you can search both and find the same stuff.
kspecstylie,fdobav3,t1_fdo8uyp,"Yup. Same thing. I have it folded nicely on my ottoman in my bedroom. I only use it when I‚Äôm starting to get an anxiety attack. I go to my couch and pop on a YouTube or a Netflix or whatever, and lay there under my blanket. In about 30 or so minutes I start feeling it working. This usually happens in the evening after work, and usually stay there til I feel better or til I‚Äôm ready to go to bed. Whichever comes first. If I need it for sleep, then I‚Äôll take it back into the bedroom with me."
l1r0,fdocknr,t1_fdobav3,Makes sense - thank you.
kspecstylie,fdoczbn,t1_fdocknr,You‚Äôre most welcome. I gotta share that being a part of this subreddit has also really helped me maintain my course. So now I‚Äôm trying to give back to the community that helped me. Best wishes to all.
l1r0,fdodj1t,t1_fdoczbn,That's great. I am just in a tired dump today - sounds like the blanket will help.
frostingprincess,fdnu4m3,t3_emb5oj,It feels like the energy just drains out my feet. I want to sit and not move at all.
majeric,fdnxtqu,t3_emb5oj,"After the attack, I‚Äôm generally wiped."
BigReaderCassius,fdnvwz7,t3_emb5oj,"Yes it is very common. Anxiety can also keep you up at night, constantly wake up, or sleep too much. 

Go to your doctor to talk to someone about your anxiety."
4_am_,fdo1ke9,t1_fdnvwz7,"Already on medication, not that it exactly does much other than dull it slightly."
BigReaderCassius,fdo2j5i,t1_fdo1ke9,Have you tried counseling? I know everyone is different but I too was on medication that I found did not really help. I then stopped the medication upped my counciling and started to exercise and started playing guitar. Although my anxiety is still there I find it's way lower than it has ever been
4_am_,fdo5djg,t1_fdo2j5i,"Yea I've had counseling in the past. My issue is that a lot of my anxiety is routed in feeling unhappy with many aspects of my life, and while I am working to improve things, one at a time, it's a slow process. I feel like counseling isn't going to speed things up and is a major expense. You're right though about making time for a hobby. I've kinda let my hobbies slide over the years for some reason."
mysacrificee,fdnxwez,t3_emb5oj,"Absolutely. When I was suffering really bad panic attacks the exhaustion came on almost immediately. And sometimes would last a day or two after the panic attack ended. Almost like a hangover haha. Not fun. Remember though, this moment will pass. Try to exercise, stay hydrated and eat healthy. Helps loads with the energy levels"
NewKidLucid,fdnij27,t3_emb5oj,All the time
depressedvenezuelan,fdnxxac,t3_emb5oj,"Yes this happens to me all the time, the i understand it that when you are anxious your body is in constant alert and this consumes a lot of energy, but when the anxiety starts to fade you are left feeling like you have ran a marathon"
olisrevenge,fdo2813,t3_emb5oj,"After long periods of being anxious, I tend to be extremely exhausted."
jumpingjacc,fdo3he7,t3_emb5oj,I feel like I could run a marathon when I get anxious
4_am_,fdo6mo5,t1_fdo3he7,I get that too. It's either one or the other.
andromachenon,fdo3zu8,t3_emb5oj,"yup. i can feel my eyes flutter and i start to slump, and eventually i just go down. i‚Äôm usually out for a minute or two. i‚Äôm still pretty much conscious, but so exhausted and detached that my body and mind shut down. i think of it as the equivalent of ‚Äúturn it off and back on again.‚Äù"
mingmob,fdo723p,t3_emb5oj,"Absolutely, and I hate it! For me it mostly comes from anxiety about unfinished tasks, which easily spirals out of control as I sleep more and do less. I combat it by choosing one thing that is easily accomplished and giving myself full permission to rest when it‚Äôs done. Sometimes I choose to do just the one thing, sometimes I get an endorphin rush from finishing one thing and that energizes me to do more."
4_am_,fdo9213,t1_fdo723p,"I think this is bang on. It's like a procrastination anxiety/tiredness thing. How do you deal with it when the tasks are long term goals? Like finding a new job, getting fit etc. I feel like I don't deserve to relax until I've finished these tasks, but they could take months and months."
mingmob,fdoa46z,t1_fdo9213,"You definitely have to break them down into mini goals. Instead of ‚Äúlook for a job,‚Äù can you say, ‚ÄúI need to complete the work history section of my resume, then I can take a break?‚Äù When doing everything is too much, remember that doing anything is better than nothing. 

I often feel guilty if I haven‚Äôt ridden my horse for several days, but going for a ride sounds exhausting. Instead of beating myself up for not being a good owner, I put on my riding gear and go to the barn just to groom/snuggle him. Sometimes that‚Äôs all I‚Äôll do, sometimes getting there is the hardest part and once I‚Äôm there I have the energy to lunge him or ride."
4_am_,fdodvs9,t1_fdoa46z,"Yea I really need to do this. I do make lists, but I tend to deviate from the list and start trying to figure something else out or obsessing over unrelated shit, think myself into a hole and then kick myself for procrastinating and not being as successful as my friends. It's at this point the anxiety ball has grown and I feel exhausted.

The horse thing makes a lot of sense. I did have a hobby that I used to break up the day but I kinda had to give it up when I moved to my current city as it's not an easy hobby to continue here, in a similar way that horse riding wouldn't be. And I feel too guilty to take up a new hobby when there are more pressing issues in my life.

Thanks for the advice, I'm definitely going to work on making my daily goals more specific."
mingmob,fdoflqb,t1_fdodvs9,"It is really hard to get out of that rut. Currently I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm able to put these step to work about 70% of the time, but when my anxiety isn‚Äôt managed as well it is much harder. I also struggle with executive dysfunction due to ADHD, so it can be hard to know the cause of my ‚Äúproductivity paralysis.‚Äù Definitely work on specific, attainable goals, but make sure to show yourself compassion along the way. It‚Äôs not easy, no matter what people without anxiety tell you."
alonsoe94,fdoa36w,t3_emb5oj,"The same happens to me, I finish as if I don't feel it was no emotion. The psychologist told me that it is a response from your brain to so many thoughts"
Noblesseoblige24,fdoa9ea,t3_emb5oj,"I find I get anxiety **caused by being** tired. As in, my mind is just so exhausted it's throwing a tantrum."
NoobLs,fdohvh6,t3_emb5oj,"Yes, all the time."
4theloveoffiber,fdowe78,t3_emb5oj,All the time. I‚Äôve been laying in bed since 5:30 pm. Feeling incredibly drained.
plzwait,fdp7vew,t3_emb5oj,"Yes! I take lots of stress naps, they seem to help me regroup if I‚Äôm not in a complete panic"
bitzor,fdpcidc,t3_emb5oj,Hey. New anxious person here. My anxiety showed up tied to panic attacks. Once the panic attack melts down I get incredibly tired. I can be phisically energic but mentally I feel like I need to sleep for weeks straight.
tanduayece,fdpil7j,t3_emb5oj,"Same. When I'm anxious or stressed, I sleep for more than 8 hours and still feel tired... I don't know how to handle it, wish it stops."
digi-cow,fdpj4gh,t3_emb5oj,"It makes sense, your body and mind is going through A LOT when you're anxious and you need rest to recover."
wheredidmysockgo7,fdpjfr9,t3_emb5oj,Yeah. Usually right after I've been anxious I'm super tired. It always sucks
dumbguts,fdpk5lb,t3_emb5oj,"When you're in a long period of anxiety, your body fails to work at its fullest potential. Digestion is different, muscles are constantly stiff. When your body gets tired of being anxious, your body feels weak as it tries to get back up on its feet. Learned about this in a psych class, it's really interesting."
SilkySweetMel,fdpwrv1,t3_emb5oj,"I‚Äôm the same. I either get the nervous anxiety (might have a heart attack and die) or I feel like I‚Äôve drugged myself with sleeping pills. Ive noticed a few things that set off the sleepy/shutdown mode: Flights, waking up too early, driving, doctor appointments, confrontation, anything relating to court (traffic ticket court dates), funerals, school meetings, etc. I just want to shut down and not exist. Don‚Äôt want to deal with these things and just want them to go away. I haven‚Äôt figured out a healthy way to deal with this sort of anxiety. My meds only make it worse when it gets like this. For now I‚Äôm making notes so I can share this with my docs.

fullmetalheartbeat,eltacg,top_level,"Crossposted w/ r/DoesAnybodyElse.

Let me preface this by saying that I am NOT talking about intentionally acting ""disabled"" or anything like that. It wasn't that I decided to do that, not at all.


It's more that sometimes when you have social anxiety you can get into this dynamic where people see you as incompetent and helpless, and you feel incompetent and helpless. And in some cases it can feel safer psychologically to lean into that helplessness and have people patronize you, rather than to try and prove competence and potentially prove ""just enough"" to get your patronize pass revoked, but not seem competent enough to prove yourself, in which case instead of patronizing you people might act towards you with hostility.


I was very, very school smart, but seemed ""incompetent"" and felt ""stupid"" in almost every other area of my life. So I kind of convinced myself that I was one of those ""socially akward smart people,"" which I suppose isn't entirely untrue, but I had a moment of self-awareness in college where I realized I was sort of wearing that like a shield, and leaning into my awkwardness MORE around people who ""just don't GET anxiety."" 

Eventually I realized it was kind of counterproductive and that it was keeping me from gaining confidence in certain settings, and perpetuating dynamics between myself and others that I wasn't happy with. I'm generally a lot more confident and happy now, but of course I still have chronic anxiety and I still sometimes catch myself falling back into this."
shortyninja,fdk3gbm,t3_eltacg,"I think I do this. Huh.
I hadn‚Äôt even realised."
fullmetalheartbeat,fdk4gxb,t1_fdk3gbm,"Sending much support your way, friend! It's not a fun dynamic to be in, so I hope you find the support you need!"
FLS-TROYM,fdkbdmz,t3_eltacg,"I've always felt incompetent, surrounded by those that knew what they were doing and I was just trying to keep up. I oddly responded without the helplessness. I protected and hid my insecurities, and then suffered from guilt of being a fake. Strange how similar feelings can generate a host of maladaptive responses. \~Troy (Flourishing Life Society)"
ararlynn,fdk9jc4,t3_eltacg,"i do this a lot, actually. i just want someone to help me out, i guess, so i don't have to do things alone and act independently. i'm trying to stop, but it's a habit now"
wrcftw,fdk6qua,t3_eltacg,Damn....I think I've been doing this my whole life. How did you get out of the trap? Whenever I find myself in tough situations I seem to do this.
fullmetalheartbeat,fdkuzy8,t1_fdk6qua,"That's a... hard to answer question, without a simple answer. For me, the process of ""recovering"" from the worst of my anxiety was very much that, a process. If there's one thing that I've learned it's that you can't ""willpower"" yourself out of anxiety, nor can you just ""willpower"" yourself to cope with anxiety in a healthy and productive way. For me it was a process of having specific experiences that lead to the necessary epiphanies that gradually provided me with more tools and insight needed to keep getting better. 

People are often told things that they intellectually know the words to but don't *know* on a deeper level until they have specific experiences that make it click. Like being told that ""anyone who is committed to misunderstanding you is not worth your attention."" Like sure, you might know what that means, and it might make perfect sense, but it nonetheless isn't that helpful as advice because you might know it but you don't feel it, haven't had the right experiences to really believe it when it counts. And you can't just make yourself *know* it either- it will take that personalized epiphany.

This might sound discouraging, as if I'm saying that there's nothing you can do right now to make your anxiety better, but that's not what I'm saying- it's just that there's no one-size-fits-all, canned advice I could give that would be actually helpful, because what will help you right now is individual to you and the epiphanies that will provide you more tools will come as you move forward, but can't be forced. So my only generalized advice is this: know that no matter how stuck you feel, you ARE making progress. Recovery is not a sudden thing achieved through force of will, it's an accumulative process. Every time you set a goal and failed, tried a strategy that didn't work, etc, it wasn't a waste of time. It was valuable experience that will eventually collectively contribute to those ""a-ha!"" moments that will make important tools and strategies real for you, rather than just being words. It's okay to give yourself that affirmation, ""Every day I make progress even if it doesn't feel like it,"" because it really is true.


Then once you've had those a-ha moments and learn the tools and strategies that work for you it's important to perform ""maintenance"" on yourself, and try and keep them up the best you can. Many anxiety disorders are chronic conditions, meaning they can't be cured, but they can be treated. I promise you that recovery from it being as bad as it is is possible and that are ARE making progress every single day, even if it doesn't feel like it."
wrcftw,fdl98y8,t1_fdkuzy8,Thanks for that reply
anemix01,fdl2img,t3_eltacg,"I didn't realize I had a similar case. I'm almost a young adult yet there are times where my anxiety doesn't let me interact properly with people around me because I'm so afraid of how the conversations will develop.

One day, during my family's vacation, we were meeting all sort of family members and well, that  gave me anxiety since it exhausts me to have to ""act nicely and friendly"" when all I wanted to do was to stay silent on a corner and just watch from a far in peace.

So, I noticed that everyone was gathering on this large table, so at some point I'll have people next to me who I'll be force to do small talk with ( which I hate because it's so draining and uncomfortable). But then, just at the extreme end there was my little cousin playing with her barbie kitchen set. So I rushed and sat next to her so 1. I didn't have anyone next to me, 2. I was ""forced"" to be her playmate. 

For the next hours I played like a five year old with my cousin as an excuse for not talking to a single grown up there, it worked.

Everyone thought I was just trying to be nice but in reality I did love playing ""barbie little restaurant"" than talking with my family members cause it meant that I was just talking to one kid who was actually pretty nice and not judgmental at all."
shabi_sensei,fdlgzib,t3_eltacg,"I'm afraid of failure so I never really try my hardest because then I'll look stupid or incompetent. If I fail, I can say ""well I wasn't really trying anyways"".

Silver_Dragon_526,fdkrwtd,t3_eltacg,"I also have ADHD and depression. Sometimes, usually right before a panic attack occurs, when I'm overwhelmed I find my higher functions sort of shutting down and I revert to acting like I'm 5 because I just cannot function. My therapist thinks that being ADHD makes those reactions even worse than if I only had anxiety. Honestly, I dont know how to cope with it other than having my SO hold me in a tight hug until my panic attack passes. If he's not around I try to find a private place where I can be absolutely alone until I calm down."

SureNarwhal,fdm7ajc,t3_eltacg,"For me...I don't think so.  I don't think I've ever had an opportunity where I would have leaned into it as my parents were emotionally abusive and hostile to any signs of anxiety, depression, etc.  Whenever I have been capable of doing so (I am less so right now), I have always tried my best to hide it from people by avoiding the situations as much as possible or suppressing my emotions and lying.  After how my parents treated me...I do not think I could react how you describe.  It is antithetical to what they forced me to become.  Right now, I'm less capable of that, but I'm more prone to freezing up or just crying if I can't escape such anxiety provoking situations.  I just can't deal with it."

https://www.amazon.com/Hope-Help-Nerves-Claire-Weekes/dp/0451167228

> At night he falls into bed exhausted, to sleep the fretful sleep
of nervous agitation, the heavy sleep of nervous exhaustion, the
drugged sleep of the barbiturate swallower, or, worse still, to find
no sleep in spite of heavy sedation.
At times the early evening may not seem so bad. He may feel
almost normal and think he has conquered this ""thing"" at last,
and may go to bed saying, ""Now, that's the finish. Tomorrow I will
be my old self again,"" only to wake and find the spasms and
churning as severe as ever.

and

> PALPITATIONS
This short attack of alarmingly quickly beating heart may come,
and so often does, just as you are going off to sleep, or may even
wake you from sleep. Do not sit up in panic. The more you panic,
the more adrenalin is released by your glands and nerves and the
quicker your heart beats. Although you may think, ""Ah, I wish the
doctor could feel my pulse now! My heart really is racing!"" I still
suspect that if you take your own pulse you will find that its rate
is not much more than one hundred and twenty beats to each
minute. Even if it is, it is not important. A healthy heart can
tolerate a rate of over two hundred beats per minute for many
hours, even days, without evidence of damage.

So you see it is both common and long known and also has a long known solution.

Purchase it online for just $5.

I'm not associated with it in any way. It has almost cured me.

Her other book is equally good and has overlapping content but is for $3 for the Kindle / online version: https://www.amazon.com/Self-Help-Your-Nerves-Overcoming/dp/0722531559

It's worth 1000s of times the $3 it costs.

I've been able to control my anxiety and panic attacks while I'm awake, but during sleep is another story. I often have woken up heart racing, drenched in sweat, trouble breathing. Feels like a test almost. Like how well you can get your anxiety under control after being thrown into the shit of it. It's especially annoying for me since my anxiety stems from my health (which is totally fine but thats anxiety for yah).
Anyways I think what it boils down to is preparing your mind before bed, I believe that meditation can be quite helpful. I've also personally be trying pure CBD oils and they have helped quite a bit keeping me calm and asleep throughout the night. So maybe give those a shot. Anyways hope this helps hang in there!"

I pretty much got rid of all the anxiety and fell back to sleep. That was my most recent one and I was super surprised that I did that. Maybe you should give it a try for your next one.
ManicToons,fduybae,t1_fduvlqi,Yeah I'm super anxious still that I feel it kicks up as soon as I start snoozing off. Bad thing is I go in to work in 3 hours. Wish me luck.
ALittleBorkedUp,fdvfjex,t1_fduybae,"You‚Äôre going to be okay. Anxiety is a bitch, but you don‚Äôt have to let it win.

When my anxiety was at its absolute worst, there was a period of about a week where I couldn‚Äôt even go into work. Some days I‚Äôd have a panic attack just after getting out of bed. Or I‚Äôd get 90% of the way to work and then start having a panic attack until I turned around and called in sick. Some days, I‚Äôd make into the office, and then have a panic attack on the way over to my desk, and I‚Äôd have to get out of the office and promise myself not to go back in before I could calm down.

As this went on, the fears about being able to earn a wage only compounded my anxieties.

There came a point where I was just so exhausted by my anxiety, that I said fuck it. I sat down in my chair and decided that if I was going to have a panic attack then I was going to do it right there and just get the fucking thing over with. If I was going to pass out, then so be it. If I die (even though nobody dies from anxiety), then fine.

I did what I could to self-soothe, but I couldn‚Äôt stop the rollercoaster once it was in motion. So I sat there and rode out the panic attack . Eventually it ended.

I was physically and emotionally drained, but I‚Äôd survived. And in the place where my anxiety lives there was just a numbness. And then I got on with my work day.

Knowing that I could survive my anxiety if I just stuck it out, and that I didn‚Äôt have to lose my job, or live my life like a recluse was a big weight lifted. My anxiety never went away, but the more I confronted it, the easier it became to make it through each day.

Of course there‚Äôs a lot you can do lifestyle-wise to mitigate your anxiety (nix the caffeine and reduce your sugar intake, eat more regular meals to avoid blood sugar spikes, etc.), but accepting your anxiety and moving forward is a powerful thing."

joeywisenbaker,fdlwinu,t3_elyt5g,"I wont be able to sleep and it doesn't worry me, but after 1am rolls around I start to panick because I dont think I'm gonna have enough sleep to function at work and I'm gonna be late and have to call in and I might get fired. My mind goes through this process more than it should."
Chromenugget888,fdlx6fn,t1_fdlwinu,It's simple as reminding urself that's it's okay and you'll sleep eventually but it's hard to convince urself that's everything really is already

bogoblin-,fdlc3mn,t3_elyt5g,"This, but like I don‚Äôt feel anxious at all I got to bed  like normal but feel like I‚Äôm never actually asleep?? Like I‚Äôm not going into REM"
draconis4756,fdlku7h,t3_elyt5g,"I‚Äôve had/have this now. One thing that I‚Äôve started was to not fight it. Or force it. You can‚Äôt assume that you‚Äôre not getting sleep. You also have to build( this is going to sound stupid) a relationship with your bed. A bed is for sleeping. Not for tossing and turning. So my typical technic is when I start to get fusterated in bed. I get up, grab a light bite and drink. I then sit on my couch and read. Something boring or something that you‚Äôve read a million times already. Another thing that works is audiobooks. I put it on a timer and it helps take my head off me. 

I also use the calm app. There are many meditating technics that‚Äôll help you relax."
MandyPandyxox,fdlll4a,t3_elyt5g,"Yes! Just went through this last night, tossing and turning until 2:30 am... and I had to wake up at 6 am. I just have constant waves of anxiety every time I check the clock and I still haven‚Äôt slept, very vicious cycle :( 

however I find what sort of helps me is if I‚Äôm having trouble sleeping and have been tossing and turning for awhile, instead of laying there anxious, I will allow myself to get out of bed to get water, maybe read a book, or occupy myself in some way to relax and take some pressure off until I feel like I can try to sleep again."
eleanormair,fdln4w7,t3_elyt5g,I'm doing this rn and have no idea how to stop it.
Chromenugget888,fdln9am,t3_elyt5g,I think it's like being aware of your blinking or breathing. Just distract urself from it and you'll drift to sleep eventually
DivineSwine121,fdlt5ss,t3_elyt5g,"Yes, since getting my first full time job I've had so much trouble sleeping. I think it's because I know I have to fall asleep or else I'll be miserable at work the next day and it just turns into this vicious cycle. I know the best thing is to not fight it but even when I do that I still can't always sleep! Really struggling with this in particular right now."

tinderbax,fdlub3o,t3_elyt5g,"I had some sleep anxiety last night. Usually it comes from either the wife making sounds in the night that wake me, the kids waking me up, my own issues waking me up, or feeling like death the next day regardless if I get enough sleep or not. Sleep (a lack of it broken or too much) is the center of all my issues."
2serve,fdlwzxl,t3_elyt5g,"Dude, thanks :("
zxtb,fdlycvu,t3_elyt5g,Same here. Last night I had 3hrs of sleep and then 5hrs of a panic attack.  This has been going on for weeks and I'm scared.  Doc gave me Celexa which I started just a few days ago and I know it takes a week to work.  I stopped it today as I need to take a sleep med tonight. I'm pretty desperate now.
kelinakat,fdm4myu,t3_elyt5g,"I've struggled with this.  The irrational anger that wells up is the worst, most self-sabotaging thing.   Once I get to sleep I am usually good til morning but I have had nights where it takes hours to drop off, and one or two nightmare scenarios where I get less than 3 hours of solid sleep for a work day.

A while ago I read somewhere that even if you're not sleeping, laying awake in bed in a restful state (pretending to sleep) will still help you far more than sitting up and doing/reading things. Whether that's true or not, I choose to believe it and focusing on that has often helped me calm down enough and get bored enough drift off.  Also eliminating *all* sources of light, cooling the room as much as possible (not freezing, but in the 67-71F mark), and putting in earplugs helps me immensely too.  I have 6 hour sleeps sometimes, but no more of the  3 hour ones."
sweetiepie430,fdm8ryv,t3_elyt5g,This was me last night. Finally fell asleep around 4 am.
harmboy,fdmaf6u,t3_elyt5g,"i just joined this subreddit to post about this exact issue. i've had diagnosed severe general anxiety disorder since i was 13 but it has never manifested in this way. for the past four nights its taken me until around 3am to sleep- my brain has convinced me i am unworthy of sleep and if i do sleep, i will die. i fell asleep on the couch last night and this morning my mom woke me up because i was having an attack in my sleep. 

further, i get attacks about showering. if i shower, i will have an attack. if i don't shower, its even more difficult to fall asleep and i will have an attack. i don't know what to do."
CoconutsMom,fdmafvz,t3_elyt5g,"Yep, and on those nights I either don‚Äôt sleep at all or fall asleep around 5 or 6 AM. Last time it happened to me was last week and I was awake for 24+ hours I was miserable."

Ostmeistro,fdqwaza,t3_emqkb5,"Tell him to sub if he's using reddit. That's why I'm here, it has been useful to us"
Everilda,fdrmi2b,t3_emqkb5,"I don't know if this will help you but it helped me. I took my husband to my therapist. Not for couples counseling or anything like that but just so my therapist could understand me better. And because sometimes I think things are going great but he thinks I'm still constantly yelling at the kids. So we wanted his opinion. 

He walked away with an empathy for me he never had before. 

What happened was that he was complaining that I'd go to bed annoyed and wake up annoyed and why couldn't I reset? It's a new day, etc. And why did I need to spend time staring at my tablet and get super irritated with our kids when they came by/interrupted me? And my therapist basically explained to him that there was SO much going on in my head that anything added was unbearable.

Now I've said this to him before. But the way she said and the fact that it was a professional telling him ""hey you need to understand the anguish she's in that  does *not* reset just because of sleep""  really struck a cord with him. That really helped out relationship and how he views me. So my suggestion is to drag him to your therapist. Tell your therapist your spouse needs help understanding and tell your spouse you just want your therapist to have the full picture. Both of which are true."

nojox,fdv07xh,t3_emqkb5,"Buy this book and read it : https://www.amazon.com/Hope-Help-Nerves-Claire-Weekes/dp/0451167228

It's $5 for the online version.

And then, make very sure _not_ to force the understanding and methods onto your spouse. Instead make him read it. Don't nag.

Be sly, and make him pick it up by himself. Once you trick him into reading it, he should be able to fix himself quite well without medicines, stigma, hurting his ego or anything like that.

Here is an important paragraph from the book:
> And yet, however deeply involved
you may be in nervous illness, however long you may have 
suffered, you can recover and enjoy life again. I emphasize _however
deeply involved and however long_. The main difference between
a person ill for many years and someone ill for a short time is that
the one who suffered for long has had more time to collect 
disturbing memories, especially the memory of much defeat, so that
he despairs easily. But there is nothing altered within this person
determining that because he has been ill for so long, he cannot
possibly recover now.

Anxiety is _curable_.

The author is a world renowned expert who introduced CBT into anxiety and nervous breakdown treatments, a kind of pioneer in the field of psychology and therapy, so you have the ""scientific and proven"" requirement more than fulfilled.

Watch these videos and understand the disorder:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYJdekjiAog

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br8-qebjIgs

Without really telling him, trick him into watching those videos.

If he is open to taking help, then tricking is not necessary, just point him to this post. If he is not open to taking help, then try something like being absorbed in the book and the videos all the time, but don't really tell him anything. Let him notice, get curious, and quietly sneak up and read it himself.

----

Edit:

If he is willing to take help from you and if he is OK with reading the book, then this paragraph is relevant:

> When I see a person who has suffered from nervous illness for
a long while, I do not think of him or her as hopelessly, 
chronically ill. **Neither do I see a coward.** I see a suffering, bewildered
person, **who has possibly not had adequate explanation of his 
illness**, adequate help."
