kevstar80,fdlub0b,t3_em1osb,My family adopted a dog that can basically do this... it sucks. We have a huge backyard closed in by a similar chain link fence. If we just let him out back he escapes. We have to either walk him or put him on the dog runner line I had to install.
meekjuju,fdnr7fh,t1_fdlub0b,We did the same until our neighbor complained to the police that our dog (who is an Alaskan malamute/Great Pyrenees mix) was out in the cold. Apparently the runner line is considered tethering even if they get the whole backyard to run.
ThreeFingeredTypist,fdolg9q,t1_fdlub0b,"Electric fence, worked for my dogs, easy to install, pretty cheap. After the first couple zaps my dogs haven’t tried to jump fence again, even other fenced in places that aren’t my yard. It’s been 8 years since we installed and probably 6 years since it was fully functional (lots of trees, branches fall, break the wire)"
chase__manhattan,fdnuv2g,t1_fdnr7fh,I had a Great Pyrenees/lab mix in Minnesota. I would let him out to pee in -20 def F and come back to let him in when he was done and he would look so disappointed that outside time was already over. I imagine your dog was much the same.

kevstar80,fdp02pq,t1_fdozavj,Thanks. I actually just watched a youtube video on this. I was trying to figure out how the gates would work. My wife is leaning towards the invisible fence. We need to figure something out. He needs the freedom to run and spend his energy.
ThreeFingeredTypist,fdp1ksn,t1_fdp02pq,"We used a long, skinny spring. One for each side, the connection runs underground, not across the entirety of our gate (2 part). That we did later as our gate has a slightly elevated decorative top the dogs didn’t jump at first.

Invisible fence did not work for us in the small lot inside of our larger lot, that’s the first thing we tried (because it didn’t look like a prison yard). I think they discovered it only hurts for like a second. However my girls are part pit and very stubborn."

He went for a walk with my mom in a dog park, and another bigger stupider dog wanted to play, ran full speed into him and bowled him right over. Our little Rafael jumped up to his feet and kept on going like nothing happened, wagging tail and happy face and the bigger dog limped away."
