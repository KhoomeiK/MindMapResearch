Fyloud,fe5sf8t,t1_fe4mcjc,i see what u did there >_<
Eager_FireFace,fe5j58l,t3_enpcoz,Listen it's fine if you would do only 5 per day of both till the debt has been met. But if this is just karma whoring or it does'nt work a day and you won't try again next time then it will slowly eat you up and people whill know subconsciously that this is a person who failed to complete a promise he made to a lot of people.
loadacode,fe5pfh3,t1_fe5j58l,"Damn you are straight going for the psychological warfare

Eager_FireFace,fe7aj05,t1_fe5pfh3,I just don't like people who don't keep there promises so I try to light a fire under there ass so they do keep them.

Gribbon1020,fdmdzc8,t1_fdmbpqn,"I got a new job and started chipping away at the debt while getting the necessities I needed.  It was a mess because I was with my ex for 6 years and after it was over I ended up back where I started with a mountain of debt.  

At first everyday was a struggle cause it seems like no matter how much I threw at the debt it wasn’t going down fast enough to my liking but like everything it takes time.   Just have to stay positive it sounds like it’s been said 1000x before you just have to believe it."

This gives me peace of mind to know that everything I do with this one is my own doing unless it’s some kind of manufactures defect.  If I can get 12+ years out of it I say it’s money well spent."

What would you suggest I do ? 

get a job just for saving up no matter what it is ?"
Gribbon1020,fdmhm61,t1_fdmeqbn,"I won’t make a suggestion but I will tell you how I did it.  I didn’t have any savings before I started my new job.  All my credit cards were maxed and spent the last money I had paying for parking to have my interview.  

Luckily they hired me and I felt dedicated to them cause they took my at my lowest point.  Do I hate the job? Sometimes yes. Is it my dream job? Absolutely not.  But sometimes you have to just keep pushing yourself through the hard times when it feels like you’re about to break even if it’s doing something you don’t want to do.  Eyes on the prize."
ChevalierRouge,fdmk36w,t1_fdmhm61,"Damn.

thanks for that insightful reply

I'm really conflicted about it .

on 1 hand those simple lines make sense and inspire me to go out and get a job now

on the other hand, doing something I hate just to make money is a thing I try to avoid.

I don't know what to do ..."
Gribbon1020,fdmltl6,t1_fdmk36w,I can understand that.  It’s really want you want out of life.  It’s okay to take a detour sometimes doing something you hate to get the means to eventually do what you love.

Vangelis76,fdmow46,t1_fdmn787,"You're welcome! It's pretty nice. I went from Explorer to this suv. The explorer was wonderful.  Super comfortable but just too big and gas inefficient. So I got the titanium model so it's loaded.  Thanks to my friend who hooked me up. Mine is equipped with the stronger engine so it's quite zippy. Is yours a 2019? I'm happy you like it. 
It's my 3rd consecutive Ford and I've been very happy. 
Feel free to chat whenever you like.  Thanks 

Robert"
Gribbon1020,fdmpdx3,t1_fdmow46,"That’s awesome!  Yea it’s a 2019 SEL not quite as much in it as the titanium but has more bells and whistles than what Im use to.  I wasn’t a fan of the way the grill looks on the 2020 so went with this instead.  Much better than my 08 Focus where neither of the back doors would open and 170k miles on it 🤣. Ford vehicles have been great for me,  I’m definitely sticking with them for a long time."
Vangelis76,fdmq69t,t1_fdmpdx3,"Oh I see. Funny story about the Focus. Yeah 170k is quite a lot for those cars. The SEL is still pretty well equipped.  At least per my opinion.  I was going for that one until I realized that the stronger engine is only available on Titanium. But yeah it's a fun car to drive. Ford has come a long way.  Their Mach E that's coming next year seems promising too. They better not screw up the Mustang image.  It's their bread and butter besides their trucks. 
I agree about the redesign.  I saw the new Escape at the LA auto show and I wasn't impressed. It looks cheaply made and too similar to a Kia."

Gribbon1020,fdmn5wx,t1_fdmn3hh,"Currently in the US, Pennsylvania specifically, what are my chances you manufactured it?"
arratonao,fdmossd,t1_fdmn5wx,"None, actually. Escapes for the US market are manufactured in Louisville, Kentucky. The Euro/Asian ones are made here in Valencia, Spain. I can guarantee that's a fine car, I have one myself!"
Gribbon1020,fdmoxfs,t1_fdmossd,"You made me even happier with my decision then with your guarantee, thank you!"

Spacemage,fdmre5m,t3_em4488,"What else are you doing?

I ask because I'm happy you're out of a failed relationship, and you're out of debt, although I don't find a new car to be a status of success."
Gribbon1020,fdms8up,t1_fdmre5m,"My previous car was not in the best shape.  170k miles, neither of the back doors opened, driver side door I had to pry open after a deer nailed me, sounded like it was screaming everytime I started it and needed brakes, tires alignment but I was putting off getting it fixed so I could afford a new one.  It’s a small step forward among many I need to take, but at least I’m no longer driving a potential coffin."
Spacemage,fdmu5hb,t1_fdms8up,That definitely puts a different perspective on it. Congrats!

Gribbon1020,fdn2lnb,t1_fdn06pt,So far I’m loving it.  Very smooth ride I think the engine in mine is supercharged it wants to haul ass for a little 4 cylinder.  Would recommend.

Also don’t feel guilty to treat yourself once in a while to something you want (movie, game, night out at a restaurant, etc) just don’t over do it.  You have a plan to rid yourself of this burden after all."

Yeargdribble,feaj3te,t3_eo4oaw,"This is kinda true.  So little story.  I don't like feeling like a narcissistic douche bag so I dislike posting on IG and taking pictures/videos for it.

But my mom lives far away and doesn't get to see me a lot.  She'll get on IG once every month or so and binge on what me and my wife have posted, so I decided for her sake I'd post more.

Interesting side effect is that I can look at stuff I did and it makes me feel good.  I think, ""***I*** did that... that's ***me***.""  Progress in the gym.  Not feeling good going for a deadlift or something, I can watch myself deadlifting in the past and think, ""Man, I smashed that!"" or ""Wow, that used to be heavy for me and now it's nothing!""  

Some people go watch others to get pumped up, but that's someone else.  They are doing something you literally might not be able to do and ultimately you feel like a failure and get hit with the FOMO, but when it's you that's less likely to happen.

Same with music stuff (my career).  I can see stuff I was doing and it brings back fond memories.  It's easy to see that I did something good or to see how much I've improved in a given area.  

I can even just notice that I've gotten fitter.  I can see that I've moved to a better house.  I can just see the progress I've made in my own life.

If other people want to follow me because they have some bullshit interest in some quid pro quo ""likes"" that's their problem.  I'm not there to scroll through their feed.  I'm making a log for myself and those close to me and in the sea of everything bad about IG, I can actually use it as something motivating.

I'm not competing with everyone else.  I'm just competing with my past self.... and I'm fucking winning!"
smorkenti,fe9ykjh,t3_eo4oaw,I find this motivational. Especially as a fan of Cowboy—that guy lives life like he truly understands that it’s temporary.

Endaris,fec038s,t3_eo4oaw,"Not to mention, if you make mistakes, nobody will remember. So make them, and eventually you'll succeed leaving people to say ""How incredible! How did they get that far without ever messing up?"""

I don't care about things.  Instead, I  think what would Heaven on Earth be for me and I do that. That might be different for everyone, but for me, Heaven on Earth is dog walking/petsitting.  I did the 9-5 thing as a web content developer, and a few other jobs, and being in a cubicle 8-10 hours a day, being inside all day and I felt like I was dying, like I was fucking dying. I don't know how people go to work in a box all day to pay for homes, another box, they barely spend any time in.  I walk a dog, breath fresh air, and look up at the blue sky every day. That's my office.

I dunno. We're all gonna die. I look at classic paintings with the peasants from like 400 years ago and think that's me, the stupid schmuck in the corner. I hope he or she is happy.  Because that's all there is.  Life is short. Enjoy it."
