CthulubeFlavorcube,fdvoopq,t3_en6y4r,Is there a sub for parents who deserve oscars?
RegDeezy,fdwgxbn,t1_fdvoopq,"When I was young, I told my mom that I was running away. She helped me pack and fixed me some sandwiches just in case I got hungry out there. I walked outside for about 15 seconds and turned around and came back in."
Ns53,fdvzk81,t1_fdvoopq,"Can I have one?   
I wanted to teach my daughter the consequences of her words when she was 7. She said ""I hate you I want you to leave."" So I said ""Is that really what you want?"" She screamed ""YES!"" so I went into my room and got out my luggage and started to pack (she could see me from her room all while she angrily sobbed on her bed.) 

I took my time then I got up and rolled it to the stairs and said ""ok. I'll leave if that is what you really want."" I waited down by the door for about a minute before I heard her running down the stairs. She slammed into me crying 

""I'm sorry! don't leave! I'm sorry. I don't want that. I lied!"" and I walked her over to the couch and hugged her and explained why its not good to say things in anger to hurt people. She's never done that again. >: D"
Srsly_dang,fdxdqp0,t1_fdvoopq,"Agreed! I watched a kid start to throw a tantrum in a store and her parents calmly set the basket down and then started mimicking their child stomping their feet and saying ""I don't wanna!"" And the kid legit stopped crying and looked at her parents like if they were crazy I then heard the dad say ""looks and sounds pretty stupid huh?"" Kid was maybe 10, young enough for any injustice to literally be the worst thing to happen in their life. But also old enough to understand their actions."
HooptyDooDooMeister,fdwwoay,t1_fdvoopq,That mother who acts scared when her child plays surprise with her definitely deserves one. Anyone know the one I’m talking about?
Icyskies_2002,fe0d1om,t1_fdvoopq,I'm sorry no one is answering your question.
SquareSquirrel4,fdwr8h0,t1_fdwgxbn,"I did that with my daughter (who has literally been dramatic since was conceived). I made her some snacks, packed her bag, and hugged her goodbye. She dragged her little giraffe suitcase down the street while I went out the back door and sneakily followed her. She made it to the end of our street, sat on her suitcase, and ate her snack. Then she walked back home and acted like nothing ever happened."
Allupual,fdwwnwr,t1_fdwgxbn,"When my sister was born (I was 4? Idr how long after she was born this was) I was upset ab her getting all the attention so I packed my pink Barbie suitcase with stuffed animals, underwear and 2 oranges and told my mom I was running away forever. So my mom was like “oh no where will you go” and I told her the park, then she asked where I’d go when it got dark. so I said I’d go to the Twins’ house, they were my age and right next door. My mom was liken”oh they have 4 kids, there won’t be a bed for you”. So I said I’d go to my best friends house (she was like 6 houses away) but my mom was like “but then miss rachel will have to do more cooking for Katrina *and* you.”

So I said I’d go to the park and think about it and my mom was like “ok but I’m gonna be sad if yI u leave because I’ll miss you” and I was like “oh ok” and put my Barbie suitcase back and stayed (as if I was gonna go in the first place lmao I would’ve gotten halfway out the house and then been cold and came back or something)

4 year old me was very impressionable I guess"
JfizzleMshizzle,fdx623i,t1_fdwgxbn,"I ""ran away"" when I was like 6-7 years old. I went down the block and sat under a tree for like 10 minutes then came home crying lol"
Ruthbadergingerbread,fdxifq3,t1_fdwgxbn,when I was young I kept sneaking out in my bedroom to try and catch the Easter Bunny that my mom got tired of me doing that so she told me that if the Easter Bunny catches me he'll scratch my eyes out because even though he's the Easter Bunny he still a wild animal and can't control his emotions.
NoodleEmpress,fdxj615,t1_fdwgxbn,"Awe, I did that too when I was younger. 

I told my mom that I was running away and my mom was like ""Yeah, well where would you go??""

And I was like ""Idk yet but I'll figure it out"" or something like that. So I packed my bag with like some underwear, my favorite book, and the whole carton of apple juice. All while my mom stood up in the background fake crying for me not to go.

And I just??? Sat in the car for like an hour, got hot, and just walked back in. And then she hugged me and told me to give back her juice. 

No she does not let me live it down."
Wouldtick,fdxb7yp,t1_fdwgxbn,I did that with my son.  Haven’t seen him in years.   Bet he is 8 or 9 by now.
Maxter0,fdws8du,t1_fdwgxbn,i lost it at the sandwiches.
2BAndRGR,fdxdwzi,t1_fdwgxbn,"I decided to run away when I was 8, took my stuffed animals and a lion king wallet with $3.00 and sat in a giant hole my brothers had been digging for fun (they watched Encino Man and were convinced they could dig their own pool). It started to storm, I got scared, walked back in and told everyone I was just kidding and I had ""got them so good""."
lifeOS19,fdxfd84,t1_fdwgxbn,"When I was younger, my mom got mad and threatened to locked me outside of the house. So I grabbed the keys without her noticing and provoked her to do it. She locked me out. I waited a few minutes and walked through the door. Needless to say, she was very confused and still laughs everytime the story comes up."
199236kc,fdxdmiv,t1_fdwgxbn,I did something similar. except I packed my own bag then asked my mum to open the front door because I couldn't reach the latch and it made it difficult to run away
smallanimalparty,fdxoy7q,t1_fdwgxbn,"Lmao you just unlocked a deep memory for me. I did the exact same thing. And my mom packed me a Lunchable, checked my little suitcase and said ""Bye have fun!"" I went to the end of the street, ate the Lunchable and came right back.

Edit: I was thinking about why it seems like so many kids just suddenly want to ""run away"" and I remembered that my favorite movie was We're Back at the time and I REALLY wanted to run away and join the circus! But then I didn't know where the hell the circus even was lol"
fennomanic,fdxogzz,t1_fdwgxbn,[Reminds me of this video of a Russian girl saying she's running off to Africa as her dad helps her dress up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJUo_EJKSLo)
conversacion,fdwj4s5,t1_fdwgxbn,Jujitsu in action
truebabyblue,fdybx17,t1_fdwgxbn,"I once packed my care bear suitcase with only underwear and my favorite stuffed animals and told my mom i was running away. With my dora cowgirl hat, dads size 5x t shirt, and boots on i walked up the street and came back. I apparently said “You told me I couldn’t pass this tree when riding my bike so I didn’t know where to go.” Like I came back from running away because I followed the rules."
autistic_robot,fdxvcio,t1_fdwgxbn,Reminds me of a Calvin and Hobbes strip
Littlebrin,fdyh377,t1_fdwgxbn,"I “ran away” once because my parents wouldn’t let me spend the weekend at my friends house. Said friend lived ~3miles away by road and a little less than that if you cut through the woods. I packed some clothes for the weekend and wore my best walking shoes and went on my merry way. 

I made it to their house, realized how much shit I would be in if my friends parents called my parents, and then hiked back home and pretended like I had been in the barn the whole time."
PeachCream81,fdxckya,t1_fdwgxbn,"Why didn't you take the hint?

**^(-- sorry, that was just mean of me; I'm sure she's a great mom!)**"
Somata-mata,fdyc54z,t1_fdwgxbn,"I did the same thing with my mother, she helped me pack but without the food. She stood at the doorway waving goodbye and wished me good luck in the world. I only made it to the end of block to see that she went back inside, that's what ended breaking me. I ran back crying, telling her I'm sorry and to let me come back home. All she did was open the door, hugged me and asked what would I like for dinner."
aza9999,fdyh62z,t1_fdwgxbn,"Grandmother did the same with me, i had a tanty and said i was walking home so she packed my bag and handed it to me. 

Came out ten minutes later and i was sitting on the curb so she said ""Why haven't you gone home yet?""

I said ""I don't know which way to go""

She just pointed and said ""That way!"" and walked back inside the house. Grandma gave zero fucks.

I snuck back inside later and pretended like it never happened."
Eskimodo_Dragon,fdxuttj,t1_fdwgxbn,"Reminds me of the Brady Bunch episode when Bobby wants to run away.  Mike is super chill and taking things very seriously and explains to Bobby that he'll have to make money to support himself so he asks, ""Well, what can you do, Bob?"" -pretty sure it was the first time he ever called him Bob, not Bobby, kind of driving home the adult nature of things.  Anyway, Bob responds somewhat sheepishly but also with confidence, ""Weeell, I can finger paint, and glue stuff!""  -lol good times."
BadbadwickedZoot,fdxz6lu,t1_fdwgxbn,"Did she cut the crusts off?
 My mom used to wake up early to cut the crusts off my sandwiches.  She knew the crusts were my favourite part. She hated me so much."
CaptainMin,fdy1snd,t1_fdwgxbn,Lmao same here. My inspiration for my departure was Calvin n Hobbes.
42Ubiquitous,fdyumeu,t1_fdwgxbn,I went to the park across the street and tried sleeping in a tube slide. My mom made me come back inside and said I could runaway tomorrow. I forgot about it by the next day.

d_ac,fdyzu7b,t1_fdwgxbn,Brilliant
Sagybagy,fdzckkc,t1_fdwgxbn,I did this as a kid.  I packed my own bag though.  It had toys.  On my way out the door they reminded me I wasn’t allowed to cross any streets.  Standard rectangular neighborhoods.  I walked around the block and came home.  Waited till I was 18 to try again.  Had better success.  Mainly because I could cross streets.  And buy my own snacks and pack better.
darkness-of-serenity,fdw9hwv,t1_fdvzk81,"Works on parents, too. My dad got mad at me over something I can't remember now. He told me to leave, I got up from the table, and started to put my shoes on. He realized that my dumbass 6 year old brain was taking him seriously and yelled at me to get come back to the table.

He hasn't said it since."
11never,fdx04ib,t1_fdvzk81,"I told my mom I was running away forever. I think I was like 5-6. I cant remember what terribly ~~un~~fair thing happened that made me decide to do so.

I had only my knowledge from children's movies so I got a stick from the yard, put my belongings (some baby carrots and my beanie baby rat) in a bandana, tried it around the end of the stick, slung it over my shoulder and told my mom goodbye. I paused as I went out the door, glancing back at my mom, who was still reading her book on the chair. ""Have a nice life!"" She said, without even looking up.

I made it to the end of the driveway and collapsed in despair. She came out to collect me and said ""it's okay. What would you like for lunch?"".

As a child, everything your parents do for you is normal to you. 
That was all it took to realize I was taking her for granted. Even if I didn't know there was a word for it."
CthulubeFlavorcube,fdw0ies,t1_fdvzk81,"You'll need to win over the rest of the Academy, but you definitely have my vote."
charlotte--,fdwh8ra,t1_fdvzk81,"Lol this reminds me about the time when I was like 6 years old. Told my dad that I'm moving out because I hate him. He asked me a few times that if I'm sure, and told me that they have to send me to the orphanage then since I'm too young to live by my own. Me, being a jerk said that I agree.

Well I changed my mind when he packed some clothes and my blanket to his car and told me to get ready to go. Lived ten more years at home. :D"
Princessbelle1991x,fdx2z60,t1_fdvzk81,My mum did something similar when I was a kid.. when my brother was born I told her to send him back to the hospital cause I was sick of him crying. I kept saying it and throwing a tantrum. So she went “ok I will” and proceeded to pretend to phone the hospital. So of course I started crying begging her not to really
Darphon,fdwvwgs,t1_fdvzk81,"I dated a guy who when he was little threatened to call CPS on his mom for some regular punishment (like time out or something) 

She wrote down the number to call and handed it to him. He never did it though lol"
CZILLROY,fdwzvqa,t1_fdvzk81,"When I was maybe 4 or 5 and my brother was 8 my mom would threaten to stop the car and make us walk home. Then one time she stopped the car and told us to get out, and we were like ""alright see you at home!"" And we got out of the car, about a 30 minute drive from home. She freaked out and begged us to get back in the car, and didn't threaten us with that any more."
Gin-Kishi,fdwy6vi,t1_fdvzk81,"Well, shit like that traumatized me... My father did it once or twice. The problem is that i've already been kicked out by my mother a few years back, so he knew that if he left i'd have to live with her, and i definitely didn't and don't want that. Still bring the fact that he did that to this day.

Still to this day, almost a decade and a half later, i don't speak to my uncle (my mother basically took his side instead of hers pre teen child and kicked me out)"
depressed-salmon,fdwltxt,t1_fdvzk81,"The hug and taking time to explain it to her afterwards, 10/10 parenting. Shes gunna have a great start in life thanks to you!"
Ivegotthatboomboom,fdxlo5s,t1_fdvzk81,"I kinda get it (kinda) but...this really isn't a ""lesson"" you want to teach your kid, is it? I don't understand why you were given silver. I am not trying to hurt your feelings, or make you feel bad honestly! I just have to point this out because it can be so damaging even if you can't see it. It's honestly really mean. All she learned, is that if she throws a fit you are actually willing to abandon her. It scared her, that's why she didn't do it again. Besides, what lesson is that? That if she says something in anger (that you know she didn't mean) you will actually abandon her?? That it is an ACTUAL consequence of her words? The consequences should be that your feelings were hurt and she needs to apologize. And then teach her why she should use kind words. Most parents manage to teach their kids about not saying mean things in anger without threats of abandonment. 

My son does this sometimes and I ask where would he would go? He'll say something like the jungle and I'll tell a funny story about my journey fighting tigers and making friends with monkeys that help me find him. Same type of story if he stays in the neighborhood. I tell him I would keep looking forever until I found him. Because I'll always be here no matter what he says. 

He always starts laughing and then I have a conversation about how words effect people. That it hurts my feelings and he needs to apologize. That threats like this will never get him what he wants. Then I repeat the rules (which are clear and consistent) and say that those boundaries won't go away if he does that. Then I teach healthy ways to handle being angry. And I let him know that sometimes people who love each other get angry with each other. It's okay and doesn't mean they don't love each other anymore, you just need to talk about how you feel. Kids sometimes have a hard time understanding that point particularly, it's very black and white thinking. The same reason they tell a friend ""you aren't my friend anymore!"" over something minor, they haven't learned conflict resolution yet. 

The most important lesson you can teach your kid is this: Your love is unconditional. There is NOTHING they can say that would make you let him leave, or for you to leave them. Kids need to know that parents are absolutely a safe place. Kids will test your unconditional love and their security with you all the time. This is most likely actually what she was doing and what she learned by your actions wasn't good. Even if you say ""I didn't mean it, it was to teach you a lesson"" well now they learned not to trust your words. 

All I'm saying is, children don't think the way adults do. Doing this to a teenager? Yeah, they would understand. Although I still wouldn't use this tactic. But a 7 year old? You just created a lot of insecurity. I am not trying to make you feel bad but that was emotional abuse. People say things they don't mean when they're upset and the consequence of this can be losing a friend IF they don't apologize and fix it. But I've always told my kid that while he needs to treat me with respect, losing me is never a consequence of ANYTHING he does. 

I know you probably didn't mean to, but I'm almost done with my psychology and child psychology degree and this kind of thing is harmful to kids. I use lots of books about anger and handling emotions, and then we talk about what the story is saying. The ""our emotions and behavior"" series is really good. And ""Where The Wild Things Are"" is a sinilar story, but Max leaves in his imagination. Then he ""comes home""and realizes that's where he really wants to be. 

Another very similar thing is the ""if you're not ready or come right now I'll leave without you"" thing. So many parents do it bc it works, but it's the same thing, not as bad as what you did though. It only works bc it scares them, it's lazy parenting. Try talking to your kids and teaching self regulation of their behavior; and the why behind what you are asking of them.

Tl/dr: don't use this tactic. It sounds good in theory, but it's emotional manipulation. Don't scare your kids into good behavior and always demonstrate unconditional love. They need to know there is NOTHING they can say or do to make you leave, you'll always be there. And it'll teach them that you're capable of lying and tricking them to teach them a lesson."

maliline,fdxltbs,t1_fdxdqp0,"That's my instinctive reaction when a child acts out in my kindergarten class, I just mirror them for 5 seconds, then look them in the eyes. I usually feel bad afterwards, because I do not want to ridicule them... It works so well, though. From their perspective it is usually a good strategy, whining and putting on a tantrum gets them what they want from their parents. Not from me! The look on their faces... They don't usually try that one again."

soph04,fdxnujh,t1_fdwwnwr,This is the right response in my opinion. The parents that say okay or bye then etc reinforce that the child isn’t cared for/whatever their fears are for leaving in the first place.  I wish my parents had said that to me.

Pause...""I'm really doing it"" *inches towards the door*

""[Sister], wanna come""? 

""No""

""Ok...bye then..."" *Opens door, starts veeery slowly walking out*

fluffyelephant96,fdx1jql,t1_fdw9hwv,"I have a similar story, though more humorous. 

At family thanksgiving one year in Alabama, my cousins and I were all bored and wanted to go to the park. We decided that I would go and ask the grown ups (all were sitting around the table talking) if they could take us. My dad said that if we wanted to go so badly, we could... as long as we could walk there. I was 11 at the time, and my other 8 cousins were between 12 and 6, with a 2 year old, so my dad thought that there was no WAY we would want to go to the park so badly that we would actually WALK there. He was wrong. 

With what I thought was permission from the grownups, we set out to go to the park, even though we had NO idea where one was.  We eventually stopped a guy in his yard, and he pointed us in the direction of the local elementary school. We played there for several hours. 

Eventually, the grownups realized that it was WAY too quiet and that no one had seen the kids in a while. They kinda freaked out when no one could find us around the house or outside, until my dad realized he had essentially given us permission to walk to the park. All my aunts and uncles split up and headed out to all the local playgrounds until they found us. 

I did NOT get in trouble though. My parents thought it was funny. My grandma did not, however."

adonutisnotacupcake,fe0l6u2,t1_fdw9hwv,"I did this but for real, approximately 10 years older than you were in this share... it’s hard to watch the pain that puts my parents in, honestly... knowing that anger and hurtful behaviour can indeed have unanticipated results (i.e. in a lesson parents should be teaching their kids, and not the other way around 😔 — that your actions have consequences).

But... as I hope the sadness I express here indicates: it’s impossible to scour away the scars; but now I see that experience as being, ya know— an origin story? And who’s to say just because my parents were ostensibly “adults” raising kids... that they’d ever learned that basic lesson themselves?🤷‍♀️ 

To excerpt from a quote belonging to Maya Angelou —  ““Do the best you can until you know better. Then when you know better, do better.”

Now, when my brother was being picked up from school early when he was in kindergarten, the teacher told him to go home. And that's what he did; he walked home. My dad, now retired cop, ascended into another plane and had helicopters, bloodhounds, and three separate police departments sent out to find him. He was safe at home watching Spongebob.

Dad threatened to end the teacher's life. She quit teaching that year."

bsotr_remade,fdw950u,t3_en6y4r,"Reminds me of something my mom did at an urgent care clinic when I was in high school. 

I was sick with what I later found out to be bronchitis and was in the waiting room with my mom. There was this one lady that had her 2 year old with her. She looked to be about as miserable as I was and her kid was throwing a ridiculous tantrum. Poor thing looked like she was at the end of her rope trying to get the kid to calm down. 

My mom asked the lady if she could try something to help. The lady gratefully agreed. My mom walks up to the kid and gets its attention. She then proceeds to throw herself on the ground in front of the kid and throws an even bigger tantrum. Pounding on the floor, screaming, kicking, the whole deal. 

The kid just plops onto the floor and stares with this shocked expression on her face for a minute before trying to calm my mom down. 

My mom then got up, took the kid's hand and walked them over to their mother and sat them down. 

The look on that kid's face was priceless."
MittenMagick,fdwlkl9,t1_fdw950u,"It's super interesting - kids know how adults act. When an adult is acting entirely not like an adult, it freaks them out like that and basically forces them to hard stop their emotions long enough to evaluate and realize how ridiculous they are being as well. The self-reflection part doesn't happen on a super conscious or mature level, but it's there."
TheBadBedPotato,fdwlek6,t1_fdw950u,Your mom is awesome
KokoKringled,fdwyft4,t1_fdw950u,My mother did this when I was about 3 at a Target. I had the same reaction as your story’s kid and never threw another tantrum like that again. So it’s pretty effective.
UltraSTONED,fdx7jrx,t1_fdw950u,Bro your mom sounds like gem. Good shit!
Ecstatic_Carpet,fdwmhi4,t1_fdwlkl9,We had a dog that occasionally would pant excessively loud.  If you started to do the same she would stop almost immediately and look a little embarrassed for a while.
TheMightyBattleSquid,fdxdjh6,t1_fdwlkl9,"More than likely it's something to do with actually being able to *see* it. Kids at that age don't have as much self-awareness, they have to learn/develop it. Babies start off without being able to tell themselves from other people! There have been studies where (I believe around) 6yr olds couldn't tell you what an adult was looking at on a table from where they were at even though the child had just been in the same spot. Instead, the children describe what they (the children) can *currently* see from their new spot."

olivetica,fdw8myu,t3_en6y4r,Serious question - will this teach the kid that it’s okay to react that way?
earthbenderceramix,fdwudkc,t1_fdw8myu,"Serious answer- No. Actually, the opposite. There is a book called Inuit Morality Play by the anthropologist Jean Briggs that you should read if you are really curious. Basically by turning the situation around and making it playful, it asks the kids to think about their own actions in a new way. The way kids learn is through experience, so every chance we can give them to think through situations while they are still young is going to help them become calmer and more well adjusted adults."
hi_haters,fdwremz,t1_fdw8myu,"Not sure, but your question brings to mind another article I read on Reddit about how some [Inuits teach their children](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/03/13/685533353/a-playful-way-to-teach-kids-to-control-their-anger)  right from wrong.

lotrfan1991,fdwgbk5,t1_fdw8myu,"That's what I'm thinking. This sort of thing works when they're older and can see how ridiculous they look, but he's at an age where he's mimicking his surroundings. I think seeing his dad act this way would reinforce this behavior."
CollaterLDamage,fdxd20n,t1_fdw8myu,"the big thing people forget is that you cant teach the kid in black and white. if the parent did this all the time, yes, it would teach them to do the same. same with baby talking, do it all the time, thats what theyll do. everything needs to be done in moderation."
Absquatulate_Now,fdwvdhm,t1_fdwremz,"We used to do that too. They were called ""cautionary tales"". Every culture has them, and you're familiar with many of them, especially those by the Brothers Grimm.

If I'm right in remembering, the Grimm brothers invented the evil step-mother in their tales, often replacing the evil bio mothers of the origins.

Absquatulate_Now,fdy4g9g,t1_fdy3e5e,"Disney has rewritten the ending of every tale they've told so far. Yes, there are retellings of these stories, but removing the cautionary aspect of the story and rewarding the protagonist for their poor choices began with Disney. Prior to Disney, if you read Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, or any of the other stories, you were reading it from a collection of Grimm's Fairy Tales. You do understand that is why their name is timeless, even after Disney co-opted all of their work, no?"

My friend's son took my orange sherbet and I looked at him and made a sad face, burying my face into the couch and whimpered. He tapped me and tried to feed me.

She got upset and told me she was going to take me to the new mommy store. A few minutes later, we pulled up to a building with an overhang( it was a hotel). She leaned over and gave me a hug and told me “alright we are here, go inside and tell the person at the counter you’re here for your new mommy”. I was crying at this point, still mad and a bit confused. I asked her “if I don’t like my new mommy can I have you back?” She said “no”. She then leaned over me and opened the door. I got out, my move drove and parked. I walked into this hotel crying. I walked up to the girl at the desk and told her “I’m ready for my new mommy.” This girl had no clue how to deal with the situation, I walked outside crying with this girl holding my hand. My mother drove up and opened the door, as I got back Into the car I could do nothing but cry and apologize.

spl4299,fdkp9n0,t1_fdkmupt,I once went to a job interview and I only used hi-c fruit punch (had the most carbs because the flavor does make a difference) juice boxes and I was trending low while I was waiting to be brought in for the interview so I tried my best to sneak a juice box from my brief case and suck it down before anyone noticed. I was about half done when the secretary peaked around the corner and sees me hunched into my briefcase sucking the life from a juice box. All I could do was let the straw go and it made that gurgling noise as it reinflated with air. So embarrassing
LIamaface,fdllqlr,t1_fdkmupt,"I had a teen employee who we kept juice boxes for in the staff room fridge, just for this. He had one of those regulators on his upper arm, and he would let me know when his sugar dipped low because it was 2 hours between breaks, and sometimes it just happened, especially when he was working hard. He was such a great employee. I felt it was important to make him as comfortable as possible.

Also there’s nothing embarrassing about juice boxes! *sips juice box in one go*"

spl4299,fdkss2o,t1_fdkq9xe,I have not heard of that. I'll. Have to look into that. It's meant to be a low fix? Like your sugar is 60 and you use it instead of something less terrible? Or is it meant to replace the glucagon injection?
el_hefay,fdkpdst,t1_fdkmg7b,The point of having glucagon available is in case the person gets so hypoglycemic that they become unconscious and thus unable to take any glucose by mouth. I’m fairly certain most or all insulin dependent diabetics are also prescribed a glucagon kit for emergency use. Ideally their family and/or close friends should  be trained on how to administer it.
JerryLupus,fdkq8xq,t1_fdkmg7b,Any diabetic patient can get a prescription for a glucagon pen. Just because it's more prevalent with doctors doesn't mean you shouldn't have one for yourself.

FblthpLives,fdkdtqb,t1_fdjy4xu,"You do. Diabetics carry tons of supplies: Depending on how you administer your insulin, this may include vials, insulin pens, pen needles, batteries, syringes, refrigerated carrying pouches, alcohol pads, a spare blood sugar monitor, emergency glucagon, etc. How much you carry depends on your situation and how extra-prepared you want to be vs. how much you want to carry. But diabetics are only human. Sometimes you forget an item, or forget to replace something when it is used up, or accidentally grab the wrong thing because you're in a hurry. Carrying these supplies is lifesaving, but it is also a daily routine, and when you are in a routine occasional mistakes happen. And sometimes things just fail...you can get bad vials of insulin or syringes that break, for example."

ElectionAssistance,fdknrhn,t1_fdkdtqb,"Especially the battery. Some of these things we need multiple times a day, some every few days, and then the stupid battery maybe every 45 days. Its the easiest to forget by far, especially if it isn't like a long trip or something. The pumps are notorious for having stupidly useless battery meters too, mine will be at red low battery level for 2 weeks (1/3 the battery life) before it actually triggers the low battery alarm, then I have 30 mins to change it."
Hondamousse,fdkfbyl,t1_fdk6qhe,"Yes and no. Depends on the battery. 

My TSlim will tell me it’s at 10%, then suddenly it’s at 1%. Plugging it in will instantly register 15% charge. 

I did like being able to use AA batteries in my old unit, but even that had its own pain points, line the time I robbed a game controller for batteries. 

The worst part is the low battery alarm at 2am. Goes off every few minutes, wasting the battery to tell me it’s got a low battery. It knows damn well what time it is, why this isn’t in the alarm programming I’ll never figure out."

Demonicfruit,fdk8795,t1_fdk4jnd,"Am a diabetic. Most diabetics carry batteries in their diabetic bag (where their testing kit and glucose remains as well). However, you don’t bring this literally anywhere. The amount of times i’ve simply gone across campus without my supplies is far too many to count. Lastly, your pump dying isn’t even a medical emergency, so settle down. I have no idea why this girl had to run across campus at all. Lacking basal insulin for even 4 or 5 hours will just result in a simple high blood sugar, which diabetics know perfectly well how to deal with and are not life threatening in the slightest. The only immediate threat to a diabetics safety is an extreme low, which could literally not be caused by REMOVING basal insulin."

AnotherLolAnon,fdkttru,t1_fdkfbyl,"I very briefly used a pump that delivered non urgent alarms, like site change reminder, low reservoir, and low battery the next time you interacted with the pump without disturbing you.

Bad for the environment. Highly convenient. 

RIP Snap pump"
schmoopmcgoop,fdm1a1c,t1_fdkfbyl,I think the tslim battery is great. It feels accurate.
spl4299,fdkavz7,t1_fdk8795,"It could quickly become an emergency. Starting at a normal level (say 100-120) without basal, your levels could reach 250-300+ in just 2 hours and it will only keep rising. I am a diabetic and have been for quite a long time. Anything above 250 for me I count as a possible emergency unless I know I have a way of correcting. 

In 4-5 hours, she would be well into the 400+ range if not 500. No basal is a scary, scary thing.  The toll on your body being that high for even two hours (correcting, at peak she'd still be around 200-ish) can be awful on its own. A high blood sugar should never be considered simple"
Adorable_Raccoon,fdkf0ko,t1_fdk8795,"Maybe she meant the colloquial type run? Not like an actual sprint.

Hondamousse,fdm7jex,t1_fdm1a1c,"I love my T-slim. My warranty replacement unit just arrived, I've found no reason to stress about moving to it since it's the exact same model. 

For the most part I agree with you about the battery. It is fairly accurate most of the time, but the random jumps when it's getting low drive me a little crazy. The rapid decline from 20 to 10 to 5 percent in the course of a couple of hours, all the while lighting up the screen, buzzing, beeping and nagging for attention every 15 minutes isn't helping to resolve a low battery scenario, it's exacerbating the issue. I just want a little bit of control over that type of reminder. 

Basal IQ is absolutely life changing, and only going to get better this year and next with software updates. After 25 years, I can finally go to bed without purposely running my sugar higher to avoid overnight lows."
Demonicfruit,fdkbrxs,t1_fdkavz7,"Being even as high as 500 (ridiculous number to reach given 120 at the start and \~3 hours without basal) for a few hours will have literally no life threatening implications. In fact, new research (that they in fact use as a methodological foundation for closed-loop pump therapy) shows that overall time over the course of years in or out of range is what accounts for long-term implications from Type 1 Diabetes, chiefly neuropathy.

So, if we bring it back to this post, there is legitimately no dire medical implications in this context. If you aren't in the middle of nowhere you are in close proximity to a AA battery anyways. The person who ran across campus was simply being nice so that the diabetic in question did not have to feel physically uncomfortable from a moderately high bloodsugar, not so that she could save her life as everyone in this thread is implying.

&#x200B;

You would be correct in your assessment if either 

A) she forgot her battery for two weeks in a row, landing herself in DKA. 

or

B) she forgets her battery enough times routinely to increase her rate of neuropathy in the feet/hands or retinopathy."
samivanscoder,fdlh6gh,t1_fdkpih6,Me too! I have a baby and between the 2 i dont get more than 2 hours at a time. And my rep always wonders why im out of smartguard. Im not checking my bloodsugar at 2 in the morning after i finally put the baby back to sleep.
schmoopmcgoop,fdnt27j,t1_fdm7jex,"Honestly for me the battery is less reliable at 90, 80, and 100% than it is on the lower end. I mean it beeps at the lower end, but it turns off after you turn it off. I thought it was annoying but it saved my ass the other night, by annoying me so much I had to charge it. My pump definitely would have died had I not."
spl4299,fdkd3i5,t1_fdkbrxs,"You are correct that by itself, would have no immediate right that very moment danger, but we have no idea who this person is and she might fall into one or both scenarios you listed. Also i mentioned possibility of 400-500 after 4-5 hours. 250-300 is more reasonable in 2-3, like I had mentioned.

Bolted out to their car after they'd passed keys off to grab their kit only knowing ""I'm diabetic, insulin is in the car, please help"" and to this day I will never understand how that kind of compassion for someone I didn't know made me such a piece of shit.

Needless to say, we're not friends any more.

Sumit316,fdngkm4,t3_emaalj,"> According to the National Interagency Fire Center — the government agency that is coordinating the deployment of firefighters from the U.S. — roughly 100 firefighters have been been sent to Australia over the last four weeks, with 50 to 60 more planned to be dispatched Monday. At least sixteen of those firefighters have been sent from California, where fires scorched thousands of acres across the state throughout the fall.

Thatdirtymike,fdofor3,t1_fdoavww,"No disrespect taken. 
Wearing oxygen and a mask just isn’t practical, facial hair aside. We hike a lot and carry lots of weight- tools, chainsaws, gas, water, batteries etc. It just wouldn’t be possible to do all that with SCBA. Also the oxygen tanks just don’t last that long, in wildland you are regularly in the field for 12-15 hrs (I have worked 30+ some hours a couple times). 
Besides there isn’t as much of a need as structure guys have, they are in an enclosed building doing their thing when we are outside. If the winds right, you may not get much smoke exposure. I have never seen anybody go down from breathing too much smoke, you can usually avoid ‘eating smoke’ all day (I’d be curious about COPD and lung cancer rates in wildland fire though but I’m speaking for acute issues). I have seen many guys go down from heat exhaustion and/or dehydration; I’d bet my overtime that number would sky rocket if we had to carry O2. 
Lastly, you usually sleep in field while on fires so access to running water for shaving is pretty limited. On a 2 week assignment, I’d would usually get 1 shower (thank god for baby wipes). Other kinds of wildland guys have better access to running water and showers based on what kind of resource you are working with."

Bakedstreet,fdoo29u,t1_fdogw6s,"Koalas are fucking horrible animals. They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal, additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death. This is not the token of an animal that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they are awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally scream like fucking satan. Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal. Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently... Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they're fucking terrible animals. Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here). When the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on. This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why? Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher. This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape. Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree, which brings us full circle back to the brain: Koalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree. An animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet. I fucking hate them.

Tldr; Koalas are stupid, leaky, STI riddled sex offenders. But, hey. They look cute. If you ignore the terrifying snake eyes and terrifying feet."

It's only fair since we exported our Eucalyptus trees to California (sorry about that).

artrodrig3,fdo1hr0,t1_fdnhekp,"It's common for Americans to send firefighters to Australia and New Zealand. Just as it is common for the Australians and New Zealand to send firefighters over to North America (US and Canada).

I live in the Pacific Northwest. We have our share of wildfires too. Every once in a while I hear of the Aussies and Kiwis coming over to help when the fires get really bad.

Edit 1: Link to 2017 radio transcript by NPR: [link](https://www.npr.org/2017/07/22/538705455/sharing-resources-across-countries-to-fight-wildfires)

Edit 2: TL;DR or geolocked- Australia, Canada, and US have been sending personnel to help each other since 2000. Fire fighting techniques are similar enough to swap with each other.

Not limited firefighters - personnel  planning officers, operation officers, incident managers (who organize and manage the battle against the fire), aviation specialists, and fire-behavior-type specialists.

Things have been getting worse in the past 20 years.

Edit 3: nothing found to corroborate my New Zealand claim; relying on memory, which can mix things up."

XANA_FAN,fdo6wkz,t3_emaalj,I’m an American. I live in a valley in Montana where we’ve had a few bad fire seasons (though nowhere near as bad as Australia is right now) and I worked at the closest grocery store to the fire camp. Every few days a different crew would come into the store to make their purchases covered in ash with money stained black and I was surprised one day when the entire crew was Australian. Apparently fighting wildfires can be a full time job where you get shipped to the places in the world that are having fires at that tine of the year.
DarthVadersButler,fdoat7y,t1_fdo6wkz,Australia and the US send each other firefighters during their fire seasons since they are opposite of each other. Though from what I've read it's getting harder to do because the seasons are getting closer to each other.

We are all in this shit together. The elite and powerful may feel insulated right now, but if this shit continues (it will) and continues to get worse (it will) we are gonna reach a breaking point, and people will stand up, speak out, and force a new generation leaders in.

Now multiply that by Califronias 2018/9 fire season. Now multiply that by Fort McMurray. And the Amazon. And Australia. These fires need to be fought wherever they are. Those Americans (I know there are probably many Californians among them) and the Canadians understand especially. Very glad others are going too.

It was a bizarre feeling to see a line where the fire was stopped and see a neighborhood completely fine until one house is burnt and everything beyond that is gone. So I feel for the Aussies who lost whole neighborhoods and forests."

YourBigLesbianPapi,fdorwvs,t3_emaalj,"I'm actually tearing up. I live in the US and it just made me overwhelmingly happy that Australia has more people to help out the amazing people battling these fires. I'm lucky to live in an area with no serious natural disasters, maybe the occasional earthquake you can hardly feel, a tornado that badly damages a city every two or so years, or flooding from heavy rain from a hurricane down south. So when I see stuff like this going on around the world it really shocks me and makes me so sad to see people suffering, but it makes me happy to see tons of people coming to help out and donating to their efforts."
KillerRobotAttack,fdou154,t3_emaalj,Did we send any to the Amazon rain forest? Then why are we helping a country in the other side of the planet? Could it be because it’s a white country?

They already are firefighters, risking their life on every job to save people and their possesions. A lot of these people are from California where they deal with raging forest fires. Yet they sign up to fly to the other side of the globe in a country they aren't familiar with and people they don't know and fight fires so massive and dangerous they seem like they come from hell itself.

God Damn Heroes."

suckitsarcasm,fe4b6vo,t1_fe45rfg,They claim they have the best type of AWD
thecolbra,fe4a1az,t1_fe45rfg,Well they're pretty much the only cars that you don't have to shell out for a more premium trim  and generally a extra cost as well to get it. The only other non luxury Japanese manufacturer to give AWD on a sedan is Nissan and your other choices are a fusion or charger.

WhaleLoad,fe45c7j,t1_fe4321l,"FCA still makes some solid products when it comes to high performance. Granted, it's a supercharged vehicle, so buying it used can be very sketchy and the MSRP is around $100K for the Trackhawk. 

Anybody who can afford one and test drives it will likely buy it. Hella dealerships were selling 2019's at a $10K upcharge because of their demand."
ImAJewhawk,fe4rdaz,t1_fe4321l,"So true, first car I had was a Dodge Charger. Will never get a FCA car again."

WhaleLoad,fe46tdc,t1_fe45qno,"Most definitely! I can empathize with that and likely couldn't imagine myself being in a position to purchase a used Trackhawk, let alone new. However, for those wealthy though and not mechanically inclined, it's an insanely fun vehicle. Kind of like comparing purchasing a pre-built PC versus building your own, but of course more costly and difficult. 

I know someone who's buying it for his wife's daily driver because her SRT Durango wasn't cutting it."

>“There was such an alignment of feeling, like [Subaru cars] fit with what they did,” says Paul Poux, who later conducted focus groups for Subaru. 

As an outdoorsy teacher, I'm hoping I never get a student named Paul Poux. That awkward first meeting when you ask if his name is pronounced pox or poo will have the rest of the kids hanging shit on him for the next 6 years."

Skim74,fe43fqy,t1_fe3j70r,"> Rather than fight larger car companies over the same demographic of white, 18- to 35-year-olds living in the suburbs, executives decided to market their cars to niche groups—such as outdoorsy types who liked that Subarus could handle dirt roads. In the 1990s, Subaru’s unique selling point was that the company increasingly made all-wheel drive standard on all its cars. When the company’s marketers went searching for people willing to pay a premium for all-wheel drive, they identified four core groups who were responsible for half of the company’s American sales: teachers and educators, health-care professionals, IT professionals, and outdoorsy types. Then they discovered a fifth: lesbians.

ResplendentShade,fe3eb3n,t3_enmypn,"I’ve only known 1 Outback owner, and he was a cool dude.  But.. he did buy it used, from... an old lady.

That said, they’re really popular among outdoors types in any region where all wheel drive is useful."
A_Generic_Canadian,fe3ut96,t1_fe3eb3n,"I can't believe how popular they've become where I live, I feel like every second driveway in my neighborhood has a Subie parked in it."
Alexander_Hamilton_,fe5okzl,t1_fe3eb3n,I think that's the timeline. They get bought brand new by old ladies who garage them and use them sparsely. Then young people buy them used for a huge discount and have a reliable awd car that's practical and can be fun.
ResplendentShade,fe41u7y,t1_fe3ut96,"They’re really a pleasure to drive, super well made.  A bit on the expensive side though, including repairs."
A_Generic_Canadian,fe4916x,t1_fe41u7y,"Yeah everyone in my immediate family is driving a Subie. I'm driving a Crosstrek, the cars a bit more expensive but insurance was cheaper so it kind of balanced out, plus I love the AWD in the winter."
ResplendentShade,fe4cgvf,t1_fe4916x,Those look really nice.  I’ve been thinking about getting either a Forester or Crosstrek for my next vehicle.
frupp110,fe5x2c3,t1_fe4916x,I have a Crosstrek as well. Switched from the AWD CR-V when the lease expired. I got the dark interior and literally the only complaints I have about the car is that the trunk light is on the side instead of the top and that the both the front seats don’t have storage pockets behind them. Everything else is great.
A_Generic_Canadian,fe4exas,t1_fe4cgvf,"Can't go wrong with either to be honest, just what fits what you need more. The Crosstrek is more of a raised car than an SUV, so it definitely feels more like a car to drive in and has the practicality/space of a hatchback. My mom drives a Forester because she has a large dog and he fits better in that than the Crosstrek. Both are great, but the Forester is definitely larger and more SUV-like."
Punchingbloodclots,fe5ilit,t1_fe4cgvf,I was deciding between an Outback and a Crosstrek and ended up getting a Forester. Love it.
Jub_Jub710,fe5w074,t1_fe4cgvf,"I love my crosstrek. Accelerates beautifully, and really helped when I used to work in the mountains. Towing capacity is decent, I've towed a few different size trailers with mine. Plus, changing the oil yourself is so easy, I just do it myself now. The height isn't ridiculous, but it stands assertively on the road, and it holds all my shit. Went from a Legacy to a Crosstrek and it's my favorite car I've ever owned."

None of them have me more than 2 inches of headroom.  I have 4-5 with the Subaru outback with no sunroof. Sunroof is what kills it and it's damn near impossible to find cars without them.  

So many salesman told me ""you can lower the seat"" with my response always being ""it is"". 

Ford SUVs were alright but they were monstrous inside. I had a 97 explorer and that was alright. The 2010+ explorers are built for much wider people. Two of me could fit in the space between the door and center console."

My favourite ""returning guest"" story:

My brother-in-law works away on cruise ships sometimes. My sister's never grown out of teddy bears, bless her, so my BIL always takes the ""travelling bear"" with him and writes the bear's travelling blog and so on.

So one day he gets on a ship he's been on before and goes to his cabin and sits the bear out on the bed. One of the regular crew comes to see him about something, and when BIL opens the door he can tell that the crew guy *kind of* recognises him, but isn't 100% sure.

Then the crew guy comes into the cabin, sees the bear, and says ""Oh hey, I know *that* guy!"""

MyCatIsATypist,fdsdyqm,t3_emvj9o,"One day you will enter your usual coffee shop, in the usual way, and hear the usual ""Large?!"" 
""Oh no,"" you will answer with a polite smile, ""today I need two coffees, one with cream.""

And the coffee boy will be shaken inside but he will not know, not for a while, why he feels the way he feels. He will wonder, if she will forever need two coffees and when it will end? Has his daily customer found love? Or perhaps family is visiting from out of town. It could even be that she wants to impress a new boss. The coffee boy had never asked any questions beyond confirming the usual. 

The daily grind, always so hectic was soothed by the little routines. The little old man that picks up a small coffee at 8am every day or the worn out mom dragging two kids along on weekly errands. These things helped our coffee boy through the endless slog of coffee dust and hot steam. 

He will never again feel as secure in his routines as he had been. Our coffee boy feels this and is certain of it, as sure as he had ever been before. He feels is resolution begin to waver. Why give himself, his time,  for a paltry 7.50 when his whole world could change in an instant, out of his control, away from comfort. His favorite customer, with his favorite order, gone and changed forever. The dark feelings of loss overwhelm him.

""Another coffee, please, with cream."" you will repeat, feeling unsure about the barista's hesitation. ""Of course, of course."" He will reply with a well practiced customer service smile on display, his world profoundly and permanently altered."

adamhanly,fds5udx,t3_emvj9o,"my wife used to go to this taqueria at least once a week to get nachos, sometimes twice in a week (they were that good) and she came home conflicted with joy and concern that now when she walks in some of the staff say ""NACHO CHEEEEE"" and she's like ""haaaaayyy"""
lazerpenguin,fdsyjko,t1_fds5udx,"In my younger single days I used to go to this taqueria and order the same burrito so much that sometimes I would come in once after work and again coming home from the bars. One day the lady with genuine concern asked if I was sure I wanted another burrito.... 

Same apartment, my other food source was a korean sub shop, they had a punch card but I never used it cause I always lose those things. Once the dude gave me my sub for free and was like ""dude you've eaten at least 10 subs this month we'll count it as a punch card sub""

I swear I cook a lot and eat fairly healthy, but that was a wild year or so of going out a lot and eating like shit."

PeterMus,fdsdshv,t3_emvj9o,"We had a great chinese place in my hometown that was dirt cheap and delicious. It was run by a family. Easily some of the best chinese food I've ever had. 

My brother and his girlfriend at the time went 4 times over a long weekend. 

They walked in for the 4th time that weekend. The middle school age daughter took all the orders as the parents didn't speak much English. 

That didn't stop the mother from shouting out of the kitchen ""yay! You very good customer! Very good! You come evey day!"" 

My brother's girlfriend refused to go inside the restaurant for months after that. But they still ordered out all the time."

CoolBeansMan9,fds5012,t3_emvj9o,"Such a first world problem, but I used to have a cashier at a coffee place know my order, and would basically have it ready and rung up when I got to the till. Problem is, in the summer some days I wanted an ice cappuccino, but didn't have the heart to tell her."
SentientEnema,fdscj0q,t1_fds5012,Same problem at my shop. That's why I immediately let the barista know there will be a deviation today as soon as I walk through the door because I don't have the heart to tell her I want it cold when it's already made. Now she asks hot or cold during the season transitions and goes for my default when confident in my choice that day based on the weather. It's complicated but lovely.
DogzOnFire,fdsbepd,t1_fds5012,"I'm a creature of habit, so for lunch I used to get the exact same wrap at the deli every day. Eventually, one of the ladies there had memorised it and started naming out the ingredients to confirm them when she saw me. I was happy to be seen and remembered.

bleedinmagic81,fds5vh6,t3_emvj9o,"I don't like coffee, and my local coffee shop offers their frappes with or without espresso (pretty much making it a milkshake, which I generally get). From the first time I walked in there, the folks were nice, but now I'm a ""regular,"" they know my name (they give you a number for your table, but since everyone there knows me, they never give me one), and whenever I decide to order a different drink, they'll go, ""Aw, no mint chocolate milkshake?"" They brighten my day every time"
finnomenon_gaming,fdsfb2s,t3_emvj9o,"The local Chaldean Quikmart next to me made sandwiches, so I'd go there like everyday. These were bomb-ass sandwiches for like, 5 bucks, very reasonable. And they were stacked, fresh cuts, the kind of shit subway wishes they could be. Like, you couldn't even fit that shit in your mouth, you had to mush it down. The best sandwiches.

And these guys were so nice, knew my name right away, wanted to know what I was going to school for, the owner didn't speak a lick of english so the counter guy translated back and forth, just way extra effort shit that I really appreciated. My dad was always in there too, to by smokes or beer or whatever, so we built a nice rapport, but then I moved away, and I really missed my sandwiches and the cool dudes at the shop. I went and said goodbye and everything.

Come to find out, they are always asking my dad how I'm doing, and what's going on in our lives, and if we're coming to visit for the holidays, and those motherfuckers still know my order when I do visit. It's been a decade. Honestly makes me tear up a bit that like these dudes don't even think about it, it's just what they do. They make sandwiches, and they make friends, and they keep them for life.

Thanks cool Chaldean Sandwich guys :')"

SwimsInATrashCan,fdsekr8,t3_emvj9o,"I was waiting in line once at my daily coffee shop and the barista over at the prep area said, ""Yo, <my actual name>! I got your coffee on the house!""

Really was a magical feeling. The line was especially long, and I always order the same thing, so I felt like a boss hopping out of line and grabbing my coffee.

It's always nice to feel like a ""regular"" at places you frequent."
Pickles-the-Cat,fdsg9d4,t3_emvj9o,"At the Starbucks I used to frequent, my daily order was a chai latte with an added shot of espresso, which I soon came to know are called “dirty” chai lattes (and are delicious!). I then began adding a second shot of espresso for some extra kick, so my daily order turned into a “double dirty” chai latte. After the barista got to know that this was now my consistent daily order, he would shout, “DOUBLE DIRTY!!!” as soon as I walked in the door and he’d immediately start making it. Made me laugh every time, and got me some great looks from other customers."
icsk8grrl,fdsh146,t3_emvj9o,"Honestly, the best part of my day was also when regulars would show up. I already knew what to make, I knew they’d treat me if not as a friend at least with respect, and I knew I was also going to make them happy for a few minutes. That’s the thing I miss about working at a coffee counter, that 60 second joking rapport was my thing. Now I’m in a cube, and it’s much harder to have that same human connection over the phone. But at least every morning I get to go to my nearby coffee spot and enjoy being the regular with the cool barista girls :)"
Leafy81,fdsh6po,t3_emvj9o,"I have a basic routine and it's nice to be remembered by the people who work at the stores I shop at.

Loud_lady2,fds1bye,t3_emvj9o,"I worked at a pizza place this past summer and there were some customers who would come in pretty frequently. One of my fave things about that job was the joy on people's faces when you knew what they were going to order. There was an old British (we're in canada so it's always fun to get customers with accents) man who only ever ordered medium tomato pizza, and a deaf woman who were particularly happy when I would know what they wanted when they came him. I feel like it's the small things like that in customer service, when the customer actually appreciates your service, which makes it more bearable."

It helps that I have a creepy good memory with certain things, though I start to feel like it's TOO creepy when I also recognize their car as they pull into the parking lot...their drink is ready before they even step in the door."

There was a visceral aspect to it which really stood out and she said she wanted to be an illustrator when she left school.

However the headmaster fucking hated her. Told her she couldn't display her pieces in the school galleries, generally tried to censor her artwork every way he could. Even made the head of art who was probably the only teacher in the school that she had any kind of bond with her put her in detention and tell her that she couldn't paint anything that could be construed has ""anything above PG"".

That's the one thing someone can do if they think they have no idea how to be a good parent or be good with kids.  The simple answer is just treat them like a person, rather than a subspecies of adult. 

I know most adults don't *want* to listen to a kid go on for two hours about all the classifications of monsters in a cartoon, but you have to understand that there are really important underlying passions and patterns forming there *beneath* the subject matter. 

Interets in taxonomies, hierarchies, statistics, etc., these can all come from a deep love and fascination with a cartoon or video game or even legos. 

The more you reward creative and passionate behavior, the more you respond to them seriously and with legitimate interest, the better they'll be. 

You watch some parents mock a kid's interest in something ""childish"", and then wonder why they aren't ""more social"".

The kid might not think it's that great either and be very sensitive to the subject. Maybe the parents could show how terrible they draw even at their age to make a joke out of the whole situation and explain how everything comes with practice. If you really enjoy drawing, anyone can practice enough to become pretty damn good by most peoples standards even if you dont have natural talent. It's about what doing what you love."
MagpieMelon,feb4xqk,t1_feag66j,"I remember as a kid I loved to draw, I had a great imagination too and would draw for hours. I showed my mum one of my pictures once and she said “great but you haven’t really progressed much have you? You just draw at the same level over and over again, it’s the same as all your pictures.” I was maybe 6 years old and that really hurt. I stopped drawing after that. 

What really hurts is that my younger sister was then praised her entire childhood for drawing, and my mum wanted her to be an artist."

Honestly I have no idea why people are defending the parents in this situation. It's mind-boggling to me because I would *not* be as far along in my engineering/design career without some very understanding and solid mentors.

Yeah, people that are saying that either have no experience with kids or specifically enjoy being a dick to them.

Honestly, it’s one thing to laugh a little- I know for a fact my mom had to stifle her laughter sometimes when I was young, but a little giggle or chuckle isn’t that malicious. If you turn things around and positively support them, they won’t remember the giggle but the fact that they were supported.

That mom legit was filming specifically to humiliate. That kid has already obviously been made fun of before because she was downright ready to cry and didn’t want to show her mom whatsoever. That’s a far cry away from letting out an accidental giggle because it’s terrible (by adult standards at least!)

It makes me so sad for her and obviously a lot of kids, because their interests are seemingly a joke to a lot of people. :/ What a shitty way to treat someone, let alone a kid:

I've worked with young kids and sometimes they're sensitive as fuck, especially young girls. Watch that video again and look at that child's body language... it's horrible... that kid is *ashamed*.

In this exact circumstance I can honestly tell you that **my reaction would be 100% different**.

> I was round at my cousin's for Christmas and their kid faceplanted into the sofa, was about to cry, then saw all of us laughing and started cracking up.

This is a logical fallacy. Different situation. Young children often look to adults on how to react when they do something dumb and hurt themselves and that is a *completely* different circumstance than what I was originally commenting on. Period.

Shielding kids and laughing at them when they show some fucking creativity are two separate things. Seriously. In the positions I've been in charge of kids I would be fired if I had this sort of reaction to a kid showing me a drawing. It's childish and insensitive.

However, parents laughing at their kid doesn't instantly mean they'll be hurt for life. As far as we know this isn't a regular thing for them to be laughing at their own kid, and knowing children she'll probably be in a sulk until dinner or whenever her parents apologise and say ""hey honey, sorry for laughing, we really do like it and it's on the fridge, love you goodnight"". When you say about the girl's body language, yeah you're right it's pretty sad, but the way her mum speaks and her tone of voice— this seems like a loving family and I'd be happy to bet that this isn't the norm in that household. Also this household is probably one that will grow to be able to laugh at each other, which I wish mine could do more often."

Till one day she said ""I'm tired of drawing so many! You do it yourself!""

And I did. And the roles switched and now she'd be the one suggesting activities and house details, and whenever I was stuck on drawing something, she'd help me imagine it and getting me to draw it! she taught me how to use my imagination, and since I started since I was 3 or 4, I learned pretty good motor skills, and started wanting to draw anything and everything. Then she'd tape me cartoons and we'd binge-watch them till we memorized them and I was marveled at what art could do!

I'm now a graphic designer and illustrator (mostly illustrator!) and also started tattooing cause I just can't stop drawing! <3  And I feel art is best when it comes from such a loving place :) Be it someone or someone inspiring you, or you finding inspiration on your own and loving the outlet <3"

I love spending time with, and teaching, my grandkids all I can when I see them.  I’ve been getting them into languages using google translate (something we started by way of dealing with a school bully) I asked them what phrases they wanted to look up in what language and we went from there. 

My second granddaughter has a real flare for language and remembers so many phrases from several different languages. Her favourite is still “Stupid idiot” in mandarin (used on the school bully as a way of helping my granddaughter feel better and knowing no one else at her school knew what it meant it also kept her from getting into trouble ).  She’s 6."

One night we’re all sitting around getting high and me and my buddy’s dad are talking. He starts talking about my computer school, how smart I was, and just how proud of me he was. It always stuck with me, more so than anyone else I ever met this guy genuinely believed in me and was proud. More than my own parents I didn’t want to disappoint him."

SocraticDeciple,fe0cxpu,t1_fe08sin,Yes we have a city horn in the middle of our steering wheel... But you have to take one hand off the wheel in order to press it... If your other hand is pretending to pull an air horn cord at the same time... That doesn't leave you any hands for holding on to the steering wheel.

Also if you're a hot chick... Boobs get the best honks!!

Edit: also you'll have better luck with the custom peterbuilt and kenworth trucks than with the cookie cutter trucks that the major carriers use. A lot of drivers are foreigners now who don't know the American customs in regards to trucking... Which isn't to say they wouldn't get it or do it... But I feel like the less apt to. 

Also since i seem to have everyone's attention here... Please for the love of God and your own family... When you see us put our turn signals on give us the space to move over rather than trying to jump ahead of us. And NEVER EVER cut us off and ride our front bumper... That is SOOO dangerous... Not for us... We'll be just fine... But if something happens... Our trucks can weigh up to 80,000 lbs... we will roll you like newspaper. Ive seen a full sized doge ram folded in half like a taco with the bed over the top of the cab with the big rig sitting on top of it. We literally CANNOT STOP these things in time to save your lives. So please leave that big open space in front of us  open.

cryptoLo414,fdz4seu,t1_fdxqqpb,I spent a lot of time on the hwy with my grandpa growing up (he wasn't a trucker just traveled alot) I would always do this. I just got sad because one day I pulled my last fake truck horn and never realized until now
RavingRougeRaven,fe04a3o,t1_fdxqqpb,"Once I was on a beach with my partner and 7 year old daughter. There was train track that ran horizontally at the top of the beach. When a train passed we all waved, hoping one of the passengers would wave back but the train driver honked the horn and waved out of the window.  It absolutely delighted my daughter that he did that."

I never forgot that kid's face when I did it. He was all curled up behind his mother, but when he heard it, his face lit up and he started to jump up and down with joy.

I was so surprise that such a simple thing could make that kid happy, that I drove off with tears behind my helmet.

Now that I have a '17 Mustang GT with a Corsa Xtreme catback I see kids light up all the time when I roll through residential areas. When I see them getting amped up I put the clutch it and give it a full send or downshift and hope for a backfire. It sounds like a whip cracking on the rev match downshift and the kids love it.

But we had trains, and all the group of kids from the neighborhood met near the railway the saturdays at 11am to wave to the train. I still remember the joy when the train driver waved and honked the train (you can imagine the strong sound of a big train's honk) for us. And also some mondays at 1pm, the passenger train passed. And not only the driver honked us but some of the passengers returned the wave too. (Srry for my bad english btw)"

Your_Answer_Is_No,fdxjnw1,t3_ena3op,One of my favorite memories from high school was driving my Mazda past a truck just driving around with some friends. My friend in the back started pumping her arm so I slowed down. He wasn't looking over for a while so after a minute or two I distinctly remember downshifting and hitting the gas when he looked over and hit the horn as we accelerated away.

My mum used to drive a big big car and one day there were some kids jumping up and down, pointing to a huge puddle, shouting, on the side of the road. Everyone was ignoring them while stopped at the lights. 

But my mum rolled her window down to hear them. It was raining, mind you. 

""DRIVE THROUGH IT!"" They were shouting.
So she did, she gathered speed and sped through it and water went e v e r y w h e r e
And Man those kids cheered so loudly."
TheTraveller12,fdyueq0,t3_ena3op,I’ve always been too shy to do the arm pump because I thought truckers were tired of seeing that but I’m so glad to hear the opposite!!
purplekween,fdzjyab,t3_ena3op,"My dad was a trucker in Ireland all his life & we used to joke that we would have to pry his dead fingers from the wheel when he passed! That truck saw more love from him than my mum (I jest!)
His truck was immaculately clean, polished chrome the whole 9 yards. He loved Smokey and the bandit movies, Convoy etc & he absolutely loved it when kids did the arm pump! 
He did pass 2 years ago and his friend drove his truck behind the funeral car as a mark of respect.  
We were stopped in traffic and a couple of kids did the arm pump and dads friend blew the horn, I thought my mum would kill him but she burst out laughing saying that dad would have wanted that!

Had a kid do the arm pumping motion to me once, as I went through his neighborhood.  My truck only has a normal sounding, MAYBE slightly beefier than normal horn.  Not much more than a car horn.  I honked anyway.

&#x200B;

I make the most of every chance I get, and I fuckin’ rip that horn and make it as long and loud as possible. It’s the best part of my job.

noraping,fe00qnc,t3_ena3op,As a kid we used to have a trampoline at the end of our yard which bordered a four lane highway. As kids we would often give truckers the horn pull. Sadly my step-mom had us stop for fear that a driver would come to our house and take us...
fadedpinkadidas,fe00qy9,t3_ena3op,"I never knew this was a thing until I was on a field trip in junior high and our chaperone told us all something like “if anyone tries to get a truck to blow its horn, you’ll spend the rest of the day on the bus.” Of course a bunch of kids did it anyway."

mirthquake,fe04e1f,t3_ena3op,"In middle school our class was about to leave to an aquarium about 2.5 hours away. Our scientific guide, who was a totally out-of-touch elderly lady, addressed the class before we left saying, ""Now, I know that you all are familiar with the hand gesture that invites truck drivers to blow their horns, and that will NOT be tolerated on this bus trip.""

I, having been unaware of this gesture or its meaning, glanced around the classroom and got the sense from just about everyone's eye contact that they weren't familiar with it, either. The woman then proceeded to even demonstrate the yank-your-hand-down gesture, reiterating that this wouldn't be tolerated.

The SECOND we got on the highway every kid on the bus made the gesture to every truck we passed. Thus began 2.5 hours of constant honks and grinning truckers. We'd just learned a new lifehack! The science lady was furious but nobody stopped us.

Absolutely couldn’t put them on fast enough.  Second thing, we got someone to doggy sit and her house was only about 10 minutes from the ceremony.  We took our limo bus to swing by her house after the ceremony before the party began, and took some pics with our pooch.  They make wonderful collars too if you want a little accent of flowers or something.  But that picture is absolutely my favorite picture from our entire day.  Highly worth it.

testbug0,fe8zig9,t1_fe7azyc,"That's a bit presumptuous. As important as the dog may be to some people, they may not always want it to be part of the wedding for various reasons.

For example, my dogs would be way too distracted by the people around to do anything other than create a ruckus. Then you'd need a dedicated (sober) dog minder for the entire ceremony too.

Basically, having a dog at a wedding can be a huge hassle that many people do without. I'm satisfied with just having the dogs in some of the wedding photos. They can stay home for the ceremony."

So I'm going to ask one of my closest friends (who know my dog the best) to leave the wedding after the ceremony, when the wedding and reception are at the same place to avoid making people travel in between, take the dog where? To their house? And then leave him there and come back? Take him to doggy daycare? And how stressful for my babe, that he's somewhere he's never been before with mom and dad, but then someone who ISN'T mom or dad takes him and brings him somewhere else and then leaves him there immediately??

EnigmaticAardvark,fe8qqsp,t1_fe8kiqp,"Some tough love incoming - if you love that dog, you'll spend the time and energy making sure he gets the training and socializing he needs in order to make him a happy, balanced member of your pack.  A dog that anxious is not a healthy dog, and the way you talk about him, it seems like you're kind of frustrated with him and with the whole situation.  That's something your dog will definitely pick up on.  By not doing anything about it, you're not ""protecting"" him from the big scary world, you're enabling his anxiety to build and worsen.

If he's struggling with that level of anxiety, there is lots that can be done, but it's going to take time and energy for you to do it.  Consider committing to spending that time and exerting that energy.

Step one is basic obedience training - you can get it fairly cheaply through local pet stores.  Call around for pricing.  It will it give you and your dog a chance to work together around other people and dogs, and starts the process of showing your dog that his world is bigger than just you, and not as scary as he thinks it is.

Step two is constant reinforcement of the original obedience training by creating and maintaining a routine.  I work with my dogs for about an hour a day between when they have their supper and when I have mine.  It's just playing and having them obey sit, stay, lay down, roll over commands, but it's time I spend paying attention only to them.

Step three is doggy daycare.  He'll get a chance to be away from you, play with other people and dogs, and again, realize that while you're the one he loves the most, life without you isn't cripplingly awful."

My dog was exactly the same as yours. She hated being left alone and would let anybody within earshot know (she has an incredibly loud bark for a small dog - neighbours did NOT appreciate it!) This was before I moved to uni, so we were a family of five, all of whom had work or school to get to. It meant we had to train her into being comfortable with being alone. It was a tricky process, but I think it's made her life a lot easier.

I think the original commenter wasn't trying to insult your skills as a dog owner. I think it was more a suggestion that your dog may be happier overall if you try and get him more comfortable with being left alone. Out of interest, is he a rescue?"

Pixarooo,fe8szxw,t1_fe8slvw,"We have, he's not super food-motivated. He's a shelter dog so I'm not totally sure what he life was before he got to me - my understanding was that he spent a lot of time in a crate (8ish hours a day). He's also (supposedly) purebred cavalier king Charles spaniel and they are well known for separation anxiety. But he's huge for the breed so I'm betting he's part springer spaniel or something else similar. Dog tax: https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/alsgxj/cold_boye/"
EnigmaticAardvark,fe8w3v1,t1_fe8spym,"I definitely wasn't trying to insult their skills, but a dog that has separation anxiety even while he's with you, is not a happy dog.  You can't just throw up your hands and say ""Oh well, this is how it is."""
gingasaurusrexx,fe9hzsc,t1_fe8spym,"Yeah, I get really sad when I see people talking about behavioral problems with their dog like ""that's just the way it is."" Dogs are intelligent, independent creatures who experience emotions and traumas just like we do. If a dog's that anxious, he hasn't worked through something from his past and the owner hasn't found the proper way of helping him through that. 

When I got with my ex, his dog was already 7. She had a ton of separation anxiety, didn't trust bodies of water, and lost her shit at thunder, fireworks, and the vacuum cleaner. I worked with her, figured out how to calm her down (fireworks and thunder, she just wanted to be able to be outside to see what was happening, and then she was fine; the vacuum became a friend that gave her treats whenever it came out, but she had to take them from it, not me, etc.) She loved swimming after I showed her no one was going to pull her in against her will (something my ex did thinking he was being funny when she was a pup) but she didn't like stairs in pools, so only liked beaches/lakes/etc where there was a gradual incline. 

A friend of mine got a dog close to a year ago, and the dog was an absolute wreck every time he left the house. This is a big husky/german shepard mix, and he's destroy the house, poop inside, pull trash out and everywhere. If my friend tried to leave him outside, he'd escape, even ripping apart a super-solid crate. But he's been working with him a lot, training him, doing all the right things, and that dog is like night and day compared to when he got him. He no longer has to worry about leaving him at home, the dog is not scared of anything, he's just the goodest boy. And my friend's mom was pretty much ready to give up on him because he'd kill her chickens and she'd beat him and wondered why that didn't work. I'm very glad friend rescued him."
Pixarooo,fe8wzyy,t1_fe8vouh,"He loves being with other people! My joke is that he loves me and his dad more than anyone in the world, except for everyone else he's ever met. He's totally fine when he's left with our friends or relatives. He doesn't like being left alone and he's anxious in the car. He knows tons of tricks, gets tons of attention, and has a pretty great doggy life :) You can't judge how my dog behaves off of one Reddit post explaining why it's complicated for me to have him come to my wedding - I simplified the issue for a quick comment. 

I'm not super interested in arguing with strangers on the internet, so I'm going to end it here. I hope you have a great day!"
iamreeterskeeter,fea5k5y,t1_fea3vdy,"I have a dog who has a severe case of separation anxiety.  Training, meds, lots of socialization, exercise all did almost nothing.  I ended up taking her to a PhD vet behaviorist at a university hospital for help because it's so bad.  While observing her, the doctor noticed a particular behavior that was odd.  She told me that some dogs are literally wired wrong and my dog is such a dog.  She said that it is possible for drugs and training to help, but it is going to take 100x more effort than a typical dog because the problem is biological and not a matter of bad/lack of training."

hitch23213,fea5vua,t1_fe9y1ui,Oh wow youre kind of a dick arent you
ditsobeh,fec9oy4,t1_fe8mwic,"Sure, but the bride and groom aren't typically the only ones working to make a wedding work, often one of the groomsmen or bridesmaids would be happy to help with something like that either. And if the dog is simply a ringbearer, it's easy enough to swing by home and drop the dog off between the wedding ceremony and reception party. If the dog is at the wedding in the first place, I'd assume home would be nearby enough."

ditsobeh,fec9vzm,t1_fe8prop,"oh my god that poor guy, he got turned into a dog"
Zapparoth,fe90se7,t1_fe8tzm9,"Again, this is not what is referenced when the comment I replied to said gender. You can attribute whatever you like to anything. However, gender is not an inherit attribute to the dog itself, only its sex is when we talk in terms of he/she, a dog isn't aware of the concept identity. If I say to a dog-owner: ""Oh, what a beautiful dog, what is ***its*** name?"" and he responds: ""***Her*** name is Lucy"", neither I or the owner are addressing any sort of gender-imposed title on the dog, but rather its sex. If you pass by and think ""Oh, that dog to me is a he and sort of looks like a cat"", sure, do your thing, but again, that is what you ascribe it and is independent of the dog itself. 

The boat example fails, because it is dependent on what language you use. We identify boats as she because the word ship is built upon a feminine Latin word, Navis. If I would be speaking another language, for example Russian, I would call it a he. Whether I choose to call a dog a she or a he however, doesn't depend on the language I'm using. ""Gendered noun"" is not the same concept as its sociological counterpart. In any way, what is referenced above is its biological concept, which is per definition, sex."
Pixarooo,fe8v6zx,t1_fe8twjv,He might be! Lots of people mistake him for one. We can bring him to peoples houses and leave him there (not alone! But he stays with my mom or with one of my fiance's sisters when we go out of town) without an issue. I just don't want to put him through the stress of someone else taking him and then immediately dropping him off somewhere by himself!
iamreeterskeeter,feauz4p,t1_feaa5rn,"I took no offense from your statements.  I responded to explain to not only you, but (more importantly) to the others reading that it isn't a black and white issue. While the majority of the time it is related to a lack of training, exercise, etc., there is a minority where the issue is more complicated.

I went to my appointments with the behaviorist convinced that I had been doing something wrong to cause it.  Guilt tore me up for months to figure out what I did wrong so I could change it.  It blew my mind that in my specific case it wasn't something that I did.

I was hoping to encourage people to take their anxious dogs to a vet behaviorist if the usual things haven't helped.  All I heard when I reached out to trainers or others for advice was that it was all from a lack of training and me doing something wrong."

ArtistWhoStarves,fe8p35u,t3_eo214h,Your dog looks like my dog.
Heavymuseum22,fe96zxd,t1_fe8p35u,Same here. What is your dog’s breed? We rescued siblings that look Exactly like her dog. We’ve been trying to find out what there are.
ArtistWhoStarves,fe9e0r3,t1_fe96zxd,"Seemingly definitely a German shephard/Siberian husky mix. Possible great pyr. Only difference I see is my dog, Steve, has a snow nose (pink)."
Heavymuseum22,fe9k31e,t1_fe9e0r3,Closest we’ve gotten is a Carolina. Ours a boy & girl looks exactly like a husky shepherd mix. The shelter even speculated Akita. Pulling up videos on YouTube Carolina’s act more like ours than Husky or Shephard’s.
BirdIsTheWorldTruly,fe8pmmx,t3_eo214h,Anyone know what type of dog that is?

Thorn65,fdquvg2,t3_emtkrx,Happy birthday :)
Dietman72,fdr8xus,t3_emtkrx,You are obviously a regular that they’ve grown to know and care about :) I have that with certain bars and bouncers myself but not to this level go you!!
plzdontlietomee,fdrujb3,t3_emtkrx,"Those are friends. Maybe not like super close, but in our busy lives, cultivating the ""weaker"" friendships is so healthy. I look forward to seeing the regulars where I go (and am also a regular). I can't unload all of my burdens on them, but we relate to each other and have similar interests and enjoy each other's company. Some days, it matters quite a lot that I have those acquaintances. Basically, I too perceive that I have a lack of close friends, but I'm trying to widen my perspective, and my gratitude."
ImSnackered,fdr6439,t3_emtkrx,"My local bar did this for me she's ago. I still have the card, it was really so thoughtful."
LooongGoooneDaddy,fdr6ut4,t3_emtkrx,That is so coool! I would drink in that bar till the day I would die
zorasrequiem,fdrn97n,t3_emtkrx,Simultaneously the sweetest and saddest post I've seen today.
pike360,fdqz1q9,t3_emtkrx,This is awesome!
BlitzKreig2741,fdroqnd,t3_emtkrx,I have that yoda clock. I got it when I was in middle school and I still use even though im in college. That thing.... perfect gift
CrackZach,fdtjqyo,t1_fdroqnd,Yup
MrPoopieMcCuckface,fdrr092,t3_emtkrx,Sometimes people like you and you don’t even know it. Then when you need them they’re there. Happened to me at work. Thought most people didn’t like me and when some crap happened quite a few people spoke for me and had my back. I’ll never forget them.
mander8820,fdrmcmc,t3_emtkrx,Holy shit they got you a Toyota!!!!!!
JustifytheMean,fdsb8hm,t1_fdrmcmc,"I was like ""Are there keys sitting there or something, what's this guy talking about?"""
_1-2-3-4_,fdr5z38,t3_emtkrx,that’s amazing. genuinely made me smile😃
spoilederin,fds4hq7,t3_emtkrx,"I hate to see these posts (for a good reason). Like some of the other people have mentioned, you do have friends. If you’re a regular and they like you, they will celebrate things with you that they would never do for regulars that they don’t like. 
You don’t give yourself enough credit. 

Sometimes it looks great having a big group of friends to go out drinking with but a lot of the time it ends there. There are some groups that are genuinely friends but then there are the groups that are social drinkers and then head home. They don’t hang out beyond the bar scenes and are just acquaintances.  I just mention this because I have seen several posts where I want people to know they are more liked than they realize. Every single signature on that card cared to wish you a happy birthday for a reason. ...You’re worth celebrating to them."
bspanther71,fds7bvw,t1_fds4hq7,"Yes!  I have hung out ""outside of the bar"" with my bars staff many times. Some people say its wierd, but its not!"
spoilederin,fds8z15,t1_fds7bvw,"Exactly. I used to have Thursday bar nights with my coworkers because we could all complain about the same things. That’s the only time we hung out though. I spent enough time with them during the day. I think everyone has their place within some kind of social circle. The difference is the number of “friends” I would trust with everything, would fit on one hand. General acquaintances are another story."
adamhanly,fds3cqn,t3_emtkrx,i hope this guy realizes he has friends. they all work there.
ATXWanderer91,fdrtzh3,t3_emtkrx,"Love that. Bars have been my home away from home, too. “To know and be known” - it’s a special thing. 

Happy birthday!"

Extra_Taco_Sauce,fds81xv,t3_emtkrx,This is really nice :) I have regulars at my old job (at a restaurant) that would always get a little gift on Christmas or their birthday. Some of them would come in every single day and eat alone and we would get to talking sometimes. I love my regulars :)

Road_Whorrior,fdn95dc,t1_fdmqoii,"Mine also just hates the sounds of loud emotions of any type. Angry yells - she runs away. Happy yells - she runs away. I don’t think she knows the difference and both scare her. 

The only kind of loud emotion she doesn’t run from is pain/sadness. If she hears me cry, she comes from wherever she is and rubs all over me, kisses my eyes and tears, tries to clean my nose, all that good girl stuff. It’s adorable and very sweet, but I know it stresses her out. She’s very empathetic and has a history of abuse from before I rescued her, so she does have really bad stress reactions. When I see her trying to help I purposely try to modulate to keep her calm as well, and it’s good for both of us I think. She’s much calmer now than she used to be."

TrustmeDomo,fdn6esa,t1_fdn1mry,"I have a question about all what you said: How dare you?

Cats are super clean apex predators that are happy to live a domestic life. My cats spend literally hours a day cleaning themselves, and somehow smell like cinnamon. I don't own cinnamon, how do they smell so great? 

My cat will protect me from any intruder that are his size, 12 lbs or smaller,  and will warn me if he feels danger is afoot, and I trust him more than the bearded dragon I bought for my security. 

Me and my cat also play pool together, because I taught my cats to be cool, unlike your shitty cat parenting.

I also could take my cats camping or hiking, but I don't want to, because these little badass apex predators will kill any reptile, mammal and amphibians within a  2 mile radius JUST FOR FUN, and still settle down to cuddle on my lap or for a game of marble ball.

I do have a literal box of cat poop and pee in my house though, so that's a downside, but I clean it everyday, and with filters, it doesn't smell. The people who come over though, know I have a cat because the cats greet and do a ocular pat down for any danger that person may bring.

Your cat parenting may be lacking, but my cats will inherit the earth.

Edit: Also, when has a cat ever turned anyone into the police? Dogs are narcs, and will turn you into the police for nothing more than a milk bone or a pat on the head. I can trust my cats and any cat with my secrets, both legal and otherwise."
tronk,fdn3956,t1_fdn1mry,"One of my cats until she recently became sick a few months ago and died last week, was a great mouser.

We inherited a young cat from my aging aunt moved into an assisted living apartment a few weeks ago.  The young cat is a major mouser.  She sometimes brings birds or mice  in and plays with them before murdering them.  

Most often, though, she hunts down leaves off the maple tree in the back yard.  She'll bring the leaves that she kills to the back porch (there was a pile of over 20 leaves before we realized what she was doing), or she'll bring 2 or 3 into the bedroom if we leave it open.

I don't disagree with what you said, but my cat will totally protect me if maple trees try to attack my and my family!

Also, when I was 4 years old, a retired Police dog, German Shepard, snapped at me an bit me on the forehead (like temple to temple).  That's why I'm distrusting of large dogs and police."

Even if he tries to have sex with me constantly and then gets all huffy when I say no. He needs a girlfriend, or really a boyfriend, he's super gay cos he only ever does it to men, or needs to be fixed, cos I think he's really frustrated he can never get off, I mean wouldn't you be too if you were just denied every time you want a wank? Luckily my friend agrees, they're trying to sort him out a breeding situation with another jackahuahua cos he's quite expensive and a pure breed (as much as a combo dog can be a a ""pure breed"" but you know what I mean)

When she birthed her first pup she came running up to my side of the bed at 4am with it proudly sitting by her feet. She had this super happy expression on her face with a furiously wagging tail. It's like she was saying ""Wake up! Look what I made!! You wanna see the newest pack member and *maybe* help me snuggle it in??"" It was the craziest way I've ever been woken up. I kept a close eye on her until she delivered the rest, but I took a bathroom break at one point. I thought I had some time before the next one came, but nope. I heard noises by the bathroom door and when I opened it there she was again with yet another new puppy. She was all waggles and cute dances. I'm sure it was more of a nervous thing where she felt safer with her trusty human by her side... but I prefer to imagine she was just so darned proud of herself she had to share the moment with me."

cjmadson,fe5z6fp,t1_fe502k8,Hip replacements are a tough recovery but in the end so worth it. My grandpa had both replaced and it ended up being so worth it
lepilote,fe6cy6r,t1_fe5z6fp,This is so nice to hear. My dad had his first hip replaced a couple weeks ago and recovery has been tough to watch. He's planning on replacing the other later this year and I'm worried for that recovery.
Agile-Flatworm,fe6dgly,t1_fe6cy6r,Physical therapy has to happen. Don’t let him skip it at all.
cjmadson,fe6e0vr,t1_fe6dgly,Therapy and keeping active outside of therapy too. My grandpa’s whole life changed after he got them replaced.
Sillyist,fe55s4x,t3_ensrsd,Her little dance.   Adorable.
anonthrowawayprime,fe5ecsy,t3_ensrsd,My Grandma is 75 and still driving her convertible. Drinking a beer.  Working. So experiencing new things is hard but she’s always willing. Gotta love it!  Thanks for sharing :)
melpem,fe5fc6q,t1_fe5ecsy,"My mum always says that growing old is a privilege that not everyone gets to do. Your grandma sounds amazing, I hope that’s how I live at 75  too"
Grassblox311,fe671gz,t1_fe5ecsy,For a second I thought you were saying that she did those things all at once.
anonthrowawayprime,fe6756w,t1_fe671gz,"I mean, I wouldn’t rule anything out. She’s pretty badass, sans driving under the influence (she doesn’t do that lol)."
melpem,fe5its7,t3_ensrsd,[She also got a spare ](https://youtu.be/xh_2Gt1hg_Y)

hennypenny2015,fe5uwo0,t3_ensrsd,"Yes, she looks so fit. Hope I'm this active when I'm 75. She might need to join a league with this talent!"
melpem,fe5wnsw,t1_fe5uwo0,"She had a double hip operation last year, she never stops, always running around. I will show her all the comments tomorrow  she will be amazed. A birthday  to remember."

johnhughesathon,fe64n19,t3_ensrsd,Plot twist: she’s been in a bowling league for decades!
melpem,fe655y5,t1_fe64n19,"Ha, Have you seen her throw the ball, I thought they were going to charge us for the floor damage. We were calling her 'kingpin' but she didn't get it. She actually  loved it and I wish we had taken her years ago. We told her we were going ice skating so she was pretty relieved"
johnhughesathon,fe6lieu,t1_fe655y5,I love the video and her celebration dance!!  The best!
M3xicanJoker,fe4ocfx,t3_ensrsd,That’s great. Also nice to bowl when not a lot of people distracting in the next lane.
inventas,fe6aic4,t3_ensrsd,That gate reset thing came down ultra fast...
scottydanger22,fe6cnhi,t1_fe6aic4,Yeah wtf was up with that? Are my usual ancient alleys with CRT touchscreens behind the times or is this bar overactive?
Miss_Rebecca,fe6g47u,t1_fe6cnhi,"I bowl in a league every week, and that’s not typical. The only time I see something like that is when people try to beat the timer in the 10-minute practice round before the league starts. “Three seconds left? I can make it!”"
pickausernametheysay,fe5cog4,t3_ensrsd,"Go, mom! I hope I’m that happy and active at her age. She’s lovely ❤️"
hawwkfan,fe621rs,t3_ensrsd,10/10. Would have on my bowling team.

Cindex9183,fe539wu,t3_ensrsd,"Well you did actually buy it. Bowling ain't free. People always say you can't buy happiness but they are wrong.


Adorable though :) awesome she can still have fun!"
melpem,fe58h6l,t1_fe539wu,"Sorry I meant the dance but yes you are right her grandchildren bought her the bowling for her birthday today, the dance was a freebie 😃"

Tsunami120,fe69c23,t3_ensrsd,"She is absolutely precious! Enjoy every moment with her, she looks wonderful to be around! ❤️"
foxfire,fe63a7m,t3_ensrsd,"Aww, I love her little dance!

Reminds me of my 57-year-old mom, took her and my cousin's kids to mini-putt, she got a hole-in-one at one point and it was such a 'OOOHHHHH!!!!!' moment for all of us which is something that never really happens. It reminded me that I should take my mom out for activities more often. We usually just stay home and watch animated Disney movies (her faves) or take walks at the mall."
This_Bitch_Overhere,fe641nl,t3_ensrsd,"My nine year old and seven year old recently beat their old man fair and square at bowling. When I see them celebrating their wins and congratulating each other on good games, I hope that they keep their good humor and spirits with them. Your mom went bowling for the first time and she looks and embodies everything happy I ever want my kids to feel. Hug her, love her and treat her well!"
Williams088,fe6dtsh,t3_ensrsd,Love this! Her victory dance is so cute
SoDakTex91,fe6e17k,t3_ensrsd,My aunt passed away very suddenly this last year at just 63 and she loved bowling. She loved teaching others to love bowling almost more than she loved the sport itself. Something about this just reminds me of her and reminded me to never take things for granted ❤️❤️
melpem,feaeyyo,t1_fe6e17k,"I am so sorry for your loss, your aunt sounds amazing. Life is for living, memories  are made x x x"
SoDakTex91,feag8ac,t1_feaeyyo,She really is the most amazing human I’ve ever known! It definitely has given me a new perspective on life.
pastelgothbear,fe6gcyu,t3_ensrsd,queen
Californian-Cdn,fe6ghrn,t3_ensrsd,"This is amazing. 

Two things.

1) I have a mom who is 71. Your mom reminds me of her by trying new things and, from what it seems like, is a fun-loving and amazing woman.

2) I’m 35 now. We are closer than we’ve ever been. The fact you spend time with her brings her more joy than she can ever tell you. You seem like an excellent human and these memories will be something you both talk about for years to come.

Thanks for sharing."
Seoulja4life,fe6ig03,t3_ensrsd,She’s hustling you. Acting like a beginner is the oldest trick in the book.

snowgimp,fe6fypp,t3_ensrsd,"I’ve seen folks well near 100 bowl a perfect game (working at the bowling alley). It’s one of the few games seniors can excel at even picking up later in life. Tell her she should keep at it! As a coach, happy to help if she’s interested in picking up some pointers. Happy for her!"
mr_munshun,fe6gnmt,t3_ensrsd,"Everybody does the bowling dance when they get a strike, even if you’ve never bowled before."

scuttlepuff,fe6vyi9,t3_ensrsd,Ive seen older ladies at my local bowling alley play and it looks like they were so happy . I played next to an 80 year old lady and she would hit strikes non stop. It just shows that tech over power wins in bowling. And they were the best people to play next to.
Cashforcrickets,fe53wnw,t3_ensrsd,I'm not exactly unfit....but bowling makes my legs and butt cheeks sore!  Lovely memory here.

Gryffindor85,fe6dbvb,t3_ensrsd,Is there any reason she’s never been bowling before? It seems like such a common activity depending on what country you’re from.
melpem,fe7376y,t1_fe6dbvb,"UK and no reason she has just never been, she has never been to crazy golf either  but we will fix that pretty soon. I think we will give ice skating a miss"

So much pain (I still believe the hospital was negligent with aftercare pain pill prescriptions but that's another story)  You're a strong girl, just witnessing what he went through, I wouldn't wish that on anybody. I'm not sure if your Surgeon/Doctor said your leg will never be the same, feel cold because of the steel rod etc. but if it's any consolation my bf is absolutely fine now. No issues whatsoever. Good on you and proud of ya!"

giceman715,fdvfjp7,t1_fdsefh0,"Broke my pelvis and have 2 screws now. I can assure you with allot of dedication through pain and sweat you will get the results you want. Just fallow you’re doctors and rehabilitation instructors orders and you will come out on top. Just remember it’s a marathon and not a race. 


P. S. They will instruct you to do at least the minimum, I was pushing myself hard with determination. So if they tell you to do 20 reps during an exercise you do 25. Those last five are way more important that the first 20."

I still tell people that I broke it ""playing rugby"" though and let them imagine it happened in some heroic tackle or something else less embarrassing than how it really did during time off with me looking like I got hit by a sniper 20ft away from the closest player then getting carried off by my dad"

AshMoon98,fdsmrwz,t1_fdsmfzb,Literally! Considering I was pretty healthy and one small fall broke both bones I'm worried one small trip and it's completely gone again! Crazy how easy bones are to break haha
gunner_jensen,fdtr23c,t1_fdtpt4n,"...no, I feel like that would be the better story."
NklbckWasSabotaged,fdutg9r,t1_fdufi11,Should’ve walked away man!
ScaryPrince,fdtt5ro,t1_fdsmrwz,"After getting hurt the hardest part is not freaking out that you’ll get hurt again.

I was in a car accident 2 years ago and hurt my back (herniated disc). I had back surgery to fix it 1 year ago, I’m finally doing pretty well and rarely have symptoms. But I am constantly worried that the pain will come back and every time I get a nerve tingle in my leg I have to consciously focus and try to convince myself it’s not going to get worse again.

But it gets better. The better I feel the easier it is to tell the fear of it happening again to go away. Every day it’s a little easier. Good luck and get well!"
YangReddit,fdu3sfi,t1_fdsmrwz,"Just curious, did you drink milk growing up or now"
Munnit,fdv79s2,t1_fdsmrwz,"Hey! Hopefully you’re being told this by your ortho surgeon/physio, but just in case... Bones aren’t that easy to break, but if you land awkwardly, it can happen! 

You’re young, so you’re bones should heal well! In fact, we know that bones heal to 100% their previous strength in 6 weeks. So you won’t have any kind of weakness there. :) 

Just make sure you do your rehab and follow your exercise programme. (and I agree with you in the vid, keep the crutch for now, weaning off them too early can create other aches and pains!). If for some reason they forget to refer you to physio, bug the consultant/your GP until you do! 

Also in the U.K., most of us are vitamin D deficient, so I take little tablets year round - it helps with bones, among other things. So if you’re worried, pop to your local saino’s and pick up some tablets. :) 

Well done on your progress, you’re doing fab! Keep going!

thisnametaken2,fdu4ipv,t1_fdsmrwz,"If you happen to have a history of drinking a lot of diet sodas (and not a lot of milk)... then you might want to consider getting a bone density test. 

An orthopedic surgeon told me that combo leads to osteopenia (low bone density) and a high rate of bone fractures from relatively minor falls. Apparently the phosphorus in the soda reduces the body’s absorption of calcium."
ParadoxOO9,fdvpb7c,t1_fdsmrwz,"The human body will never make sense. Some people can fall off scaffolding whilst drunk and not pick up a single injury, you then have other people that can put weight down weirdly walking downstairs and break an ankle."

AshMoon98,fdv8am4,t1_fdv79s2,"Yeah I've been seeing a wonderful set of NHS physios every 2 weeks since before Christmas, doing tonnes of exercises to try and get the movement back in all the bits I fucked up aha I'm definitely not at no crutch confidence yet anyway, currently instructed to use one crutch as much as poss which has already helped massively with getting my strength back! That and also I'm very stubborn so tend to not let everyone help me with things aha 

Thanks for your advice will invest in some vitamins ;)"
just-onemorething,fduh8uj,t1_fdu4ipv,"Bone density tests can be an important tool. I am on prednisone long term (10 years now) so I occasionally have one. 

But the thing is, I haven't broken a bone since I was a kid, whereas I've slipped joints and torn ligaments lots of times. Physical therapy to develop the muscles that stabilize the joints are important!"

mladyKarmaBitch,fdttku8,t1_fdtp92e,Youll get there im sure. My boyfriend had a similar injury except it was tib+fib spiral fracture. He also has a rod but only 4 screws. Just try to remember that it is a temporary condition even though im sure some days seem impossible. Its been 6 months since his injury and hes basically back to normal in terms of ability to do things.  Good luck. I hope your recovery is speedy. Suffering from the injury will end.

It took 6 months and 30 PT appointments to take my first steps.  I still have a slight limp but I do have a rod from knee to hip in my femur and enough hardware in me to supply a hardware store.  I get to schedule an appointment here soon to start removing hardware though.  Im excited!

Like, I know which is which but I don’t know if it’s Tibula and Fibia, or Tibia and Fibula. It’s like these two cities by where I live that are Claremont and Montclair... but who fucking knows, it could be Clairmont and Montclare. I’ll never know bc it’s stupid. Just give them distinguishable names man. 
Anyway, sorry about your leg."
IamSortaShy,fdvbf1b,t1_fduesm8,Huh. I grew up in soCal and I've always heard of Claremont and Montclair but never realized they were spelled sideways from each other.
jackmassey11,fdt8j0c,t3_emziui,I dislocated my patella and and tore my MPFL exactly a month from today. I just took my first steps today at PT. I know you’re injury is much than mine but this progress is the best feeling in the world. Congratulations!

JustJaguar,fdu1f6j,t3_emziui,"I wish you quick healing, and further strength for your recovery! I broke (shattered into 3 pieces, rods had to be inserted) my right tibia in 2016 November and it was a pain in the butt, but with my dad, who took me swimming a lot in next year's spring, I gained my right leg function back in no time! I advise you to go swimming as well, it does lots of good to you❤"
AshMoon98,fdv0qvf,t3_emziui,"Just woke up to all your amazing comments and awards! Thank you so much for the support! 

Since I broke it I've been in a bit of a dark place, it's been difficult to get out of bed (and not just physically) so reading all the comments of other people journeys and their recoveries has definitely put a bit more pep in my slightly wonky steps! 

To those still recovering, I hope it's going well and I hope one day we can all skip off into the sunset with 2 working legs! 

Xx"
tothebeat,fdw221m,t1_fdv0qvf,"I can relate to being in a dark place after a serious medical issue. I had all kinds of thoughts of how I'd never be able to do the things I used to do.

nazioli,fduv47w,t1_fdtk8ce,"I also broke my fifth metatarsal four weeks ago. Hang in there, it will be alright. Keep your foot warm, and use elastic bandages when you need to step on it. Really helps with pain and the swelling. Try to exercise your ankle in hot water and try to make an 'o' with your fingertips time to time. Little bit of massaging also helps. I am not a doctor but using some vitamin B pills is also a great way to accelerate healing process. Be careful buddy, we will be alright and running in the fields this spring :)"
verndyn,fdvy05d,t1_fduv47w,"What a wonderful club we’re in haha.  Thanks for the advice. Doctors never explained anything to me because I was getting treated on *christmas eve* so I’ve been in the dark about recovery strategies this whole time. I broke the bone right at the joint where it meets my toe, so it’s the top  outer edge of my foot that hurts. Goodluck on your recovery too!"
indigo_tortuga,fdtkqmx,t3_emziui,This was me today!!! I broke my fibula and after 3 months of non weight bearing and walking with at least one crutch and a boot for another month I finally took a step on my own foot!

mladyKarmaBitch,fdtszuz,t3_emziui,Way to go! I hope you get moving more and more. Its so tough. My boyfriend had a tib/fib spiral fracture in july. He had surgery and had a rod put in. Hes now pretty much back to his old self with a minor limp. His biggest complaint is socks that are too tight around the top because standing a lot makes his leg swell a bit still. Get yourself some loose socks and youll be golden! Good luck! I hope you heal quickly.

Yesterday my physical therapist showed me with my bad leg stepped forward how to roll all my weight onto it and lift my good foot off the ground.  I went from a fraction of a second to 3 seconds to 10 balancing on my bad leg.  I'm not going to lie - I broke down crying.  I had to take a moment before getting back to doing the work.

xxMattyxx317,fdtzkc1,t3_emziui,"Congratulations! I’m super happy for your speedy recovery!

My SO just brought your post to my attention. I’m in a similar situation. I got hit by a car (as a pedestrian) at the beginning of November,  had an open ankle fracture where both fibula and tibia were broken, required surgery, and a 3 day stay in the hospital. I was on bed rest for 6 weeks where I kept my ankle elevated 24/7 and just worked on my leg and breathing exercises (bruises ribs sucks). I have a total of 2 plates and 9 screws which are permanent, but I’m cool with it. I have a badass scar now and am working on range of motion exercises. I’m still keeping off of it and even returned to work since my boss could accommodate me. Hopefully my X-ray next week will show the tiny fractures are completely healed and I’ll be weight bearing again.

Did you suffer any nerve damage at the site of the break? I’m curious to know how it feels when taking steps. It’s really the only thing I worry about with my recovery."
AshMoon98,fduzokr,t1_fdtzkc1,"Wow that's sounds crazy! So sorry to hear that! I have a bit of nerve damage yes, my big toe on my right leg is completely paralysed at the moment, and I have no feeling in it :/ I call it my droopy toe though and I do think it looks funny aha. I don't know if I'll ever get that back, apparently it can take 4 months for the nerve to heal and then we'll have to see if I'll be a droopy toe gal forever haha

I had some muscle damage in my ankle which meant I had drop ankle and it sorta hangs down, but physio is helping to sort that out :)

Wishing you a speedy recovery!"

ggwp_0001,fdu8bli,t3_emziui,"Congrats!

I broke my right tibia/smaller parallel bone (idk how to call it in english, in french it's peroné) in 2006 during gym class in high school. I think I spent around 2-3 months in crutches, and I remember everytime I would get out of bed, my leg would go from a flat position to vertical position. I could feel the blood (I think?) rush down the leg and it hurt a lot. 

I was so happy when I took my first steps normally again. Enjoy them!"
Drewsawed,fdu8tee,t3_emziui,That’s amazing I hope your recovery goes well same thing happened to me back in 2013 (I was long boarding in a street with headphones on I was dumb af) I can’t stress enough do the physical therapy and than even more physical therapy I didn’t do nearly as much as I should have and I already feel the pains when the weather changes too drastically especially in the winter and I know pretty much exactly when I’m going to start feeling arthritis. I hope your recovery is swift though you look like a champ
Wolfcolaholic,fdua20p,t3_emziui,"That ""I'm proud of you"" 

""Thank you"" at the end is great

Also, unrelated, and just being nice here, nothing creepy, you're absolutely stunning. Nice job not blowing up like a balloon as many people do when they're bed ridden and out of commission for awhile. 

 Myself and 3 of my friends all have had a broken leg and 3 of them all gained massive weight over the course of the next half year. 

I didn't, but I did develop a nasty painkiller addiction that lasted a little while, but hey, i looked great at the end of it 🤣🤣"
Queen_ona_Bean,fduamaq,t3_emziui,"I feel your pain and frustration! I broke the head of my tibia and dislocated my knee at the end of November. I am about one and a half months post-op and have another one and a half months before I can try to take my first steps. Seeing this video, knowing how hard it is and seeing you take your first steps and how happy you are have lifted my spirits and help me look forward to the day I can start learning to walk. 

Do you feel like your injury has changed the way you view regular things like walking, showering, cooking or even making your bed on a regular basis? For me all the things I only just realised how I took them for granted after my accident and I feel like I’ll appreciate it a lot more from now on. Keep being strong and soon I’ll join you with my first steps!"
AshMoon98,fdv2nr3,t1_fduamaq,"Yes! For the whole time I was pretty imobile after the surgery all I wanted to do was get back to doing the little things! I didn't really care about cooking but now all I want to do is be able to make dinner for me and my bf! And get in and out of the shower myself! One of the most frustrating things for me initially was not being able to carry anything, we have a small flat but I couldn't walk with my crutches AND carry my bottle of water into the living room, and I used to get so mad, now I'm on one crutch mostly and having a free hand has really done something for me ahah"
Queen_ona_Bean,fdzxtkf,t1_fdv2nr3,Yes there was so many times I got frustrated with not being able to carry anything too! I would try to carry my water bottle with my mouth and just end up dropping it! Did your surgeon tell you when you should be fully walking again or is it more just going at your own pase? I think I would’ve rather broken just my leg bones rather than my knee cause it’s driving me nuts to being able to fully bend it! Also I hate not being able to sleep on my stomach anymore!

Did my tibia and fibula several years back, never got the screws or plates taken out as they told me it wasn't necessary and my insurance would have considered it an elective surgery.

Regaman101,fdtuauy,t3_emziui,"That's great! Keep it up!! It only gets better, trust me. (Previously broke Tibia,Fibula, and Femur in half on the same leg at once) My biggest advice to you would be to make sure you don't favor the good leg. It's damn hard but if you do that you'll avoid a lot of long term pain. Speaking from experience as I didn't do this xD"

porterica427,fdtyg1j,t3_emziui,HELL YES! I recently tore all my hamstring and adductor tendons. Bed/crutches bound for 3+ mo. Those first steps are so scary but so rewarding. Learning to walk again as an adult is... confusing. But Keep at it friend! You got this! Each day is a new record 👏🏼
PUSHTONZ,fdtz0gk,t3_emziui,I broke both of em too and walking felt completely normal and foreign at the same time. You'll be good until you're in your 30s and you can complain about it hah

I will never take walking for granted again. Being in a wheelchair for a few months really put it in perspective. Congratulations on the recovery!"
bazooka30,fdu228j,t3_emziui,Does it feel like you're learning to walk again? Does it still hurt? Was it frustrating when you couldn't walk? What bothered you the most?
Zorops,fdu26rc,t3_emziui,That magical moment when you realize that someplace that used to hurt for a long time doesn't hurt anymore.
HollowCow504,fdu2as6,t3_emziui,Congratulations! I broke my tibia and experienced the same joy at taking my first steps a few months later. I unfortunately had some setbacks and have had to go thru this a few times  - keep your chin up if things don’t work out! It will be hard but keep at it! And lots of PT! Good luck!
parkbench22,fdu2ulk,t3_emziui,"I had to relearn how to walk after knee reconstruction a little over a decade ago, and it was the most humbling and difficult thing. Recovery is really hard, as weird as it is to say to someone I don't know, I'm proud of you"

All is not lost, you will never run like you did before, but you will be close.  Best of luck on your recovery.

P.s.  walking on crutches for 7 months sucked."

Randi_Scandi,fdu5heu,t3_emziui,"YOU GO GIRL!

Last year I broke my tibia, made a dent in my knee socket, and ripped a small tear in a tendon in the heel. Result was a surgery with a metal plate, four giant screws and some donor bone to keep the joint together.

Waking *hurt* in the beginning.
You are so powerful to do this.

The first time I was able to bend my knee enough to sit on my knees, I outright started crying right there at the gym."
haxius,fdu66e2,t3_emziui,"I went through this 2 years ago (motorcycle accident). Once you get back on both feet like this, recovery will accelerate. And with the IM nail work they are doing now (combined with proper therapy).... in about 4 more months it will be like it never even happened. :)"
sharksscareme,fdu6go6,t3_emziui,"Shattered my leg 10 years ago in high school. Rib and fib 4 total breaks, 2 on each. Rod through tib with pins holding it at my knee and ankle and a plate around my fib with 8 screws. I spent 5 months in a bed or with crutches and it was one of the most depressed and lonely I have ever been. The first part was horrible but you just got past the worst part. It’s all better from here— you got this! 


Have fun with metal detectors btw. Never had an issue but I always get stopped and wanded on sensitive ones."
MapleYamCakes,fdu70xg,t3_emziui,"Congrats!  You’ll quickly regain normal movement and muscle strength.  Don’t be discouraged.  Take it slow but challenge yourself.  Try not to put too much pressure on your hip to compensate while walking.  Don’t be afraid of walking, jogging, running, for a few steps.  Your body can handle it, it’s a mind game.

Source: me, I broke my tibia and fibula in a baseball game 17 years ago as a teenager.  The surgical solutions and technology were not as advanced then and I was in a hard cast from ankle to hip for 3 months.  Severely atrophied coming out of it.  You will heal and you’ll be just fine!"

I'm even *currently* annoyed when people celebrate my improvements or lament my set-backs. What do you expect me to do? Wallow in misery and never even attempt recovery?

RawketLeeg,fdvjygd,t3_en4o5r,These amazing little fighters are one of the (many) reasons why nobody should be exempt from vaccinating their public school kids.
Rosiebelleann,fdvvb2v,t1_fdvjygd,Amen. When my daughter was in treatment we were terrified she would catch something from some child with idiot parents. Even chicken pox can kill these kids their immune systems are so compromised.
Marie-Jacqueline,fdw341y,t1_fdvvb2v,"If this in itself would not be reason enough to vaccinate!

You, as a parent have enough on your plate with your daughter being very ill. 

There's already a lot to worry about. 
Difficult decissions to be made. 

In all of that be there for your daughter. 

Having to worry about those that decide that, for unfounded reasons, they have the right not to vaccinate. 

But they never seem to feel  responsability for those who's immunesystem doesn't work well."

BonvivantNamedDom,fdvqw9b,t3_en4o5r,"Even though he looks awkward, and probably feels awkward, he still will be happy about the whole thing anyways. You people need to realise that feeling awkward from time to time is not bad. But in days of ""social anxiety"" people get very uptight about that emotion and try to categorise it as bad. Trying to distance themselves from it and not experience it, and if they do they just shut down and try to blend it out what makes the feeling even stronger.   


Thats the ""social anxiety"" for a lot of people. Just being not very social, then feel the awkwardness of a new situation without being able to appreciate it because of the prior mentioned reasons."

Yogashi,febkzpp,t1_feb3c4v,Can't stress this enough but learn to monitor your caloric intake. It's way more effective to consume less calories than it is to lose weight through exercise.
plagueisthedumb,febhx5w,t1_feb3c4v,"Not OP but if you would like some tips send me a PM. My wife's job for the past 12 years has been weight loss transformations, she can give you some starting tips"
SeleneCortez,fecc13n,t1_feb3c4v,"I'd say, stay consistent and do very small baby steps. Don't feel like running for thirty minutes today? That's 100% okay, just do 10 minutes and build up over time. This way you don't feel stressed and give up. Same with diet. I'd say start by eating what you normally do just with more veggies and more water. Gradually, cut back to healthier options and less sat fats."
CuriousKyle7,fec8jxb,t1_feb3c4v,"Variations of Calorie restriction,exercise, intermittent fasting or eating just one meal a day."
serpentear,feck43c,t1_feb3c4v,"Limit your meat and processed foods.

Eat waaaay more vegetables and fruits. Just by starting your day with a whole, real apple, you are delaying the next time you eat by a ton, you won’t even want to snack.

Less oil, less salt.

Fat in your food is not necessarily the enemy.

If you think you’re hungry drink an entire glass of water, wait five minutes and see if you’re still hungry. If you are still hungry and you eat, drink and entire glass of water after your first portion.

Human beings are extremely efficient at running long distances, if you really want to burn fat start hitting the weights."
youtubecommercial,fecgksx,t1_feb3c4v,myfitnesspal or other similar apps allow you to calc your calories. I don’t input workouts but rather treat them like extra credit.
GKnives,feche9t,t1_feb3c4v,"I find cooking at home and doing no baking at home, tends to do a good amount. Like making exclusively the amount of food you need for the meal. You run out of time to overeat."
3995346,fecm8be,t1_feb3c4v,"Yup! Google tdee calculator. Eat 500 to 1000 less daily calories than that.

In addition, I did several things, but the following is all meaningless without that deficit:

R/keto
R/Omad
And used x3bar daily

In addition to those things, I eat a large amount of protein daily, 180 to 220 grams.

I have some mental wellness and mindful strategies in place as well to help me stay strong mentally.

That's it

I have countless easy recipes and menu hacks and plan my days food intake before I leave the house for work. 

Disclaimer: there are many avenues to successful weight loss but they all start with a calorie deficit."
SashayIntoMyBed,fecnxmk,t1_feb3c4v,"Diet diet and more diet. 

That doesnt mean ""go on a diet"" it means count calories and expend more calories than you consume.

If you consume 2000 calories a day, you will lose weight to begin with. I'm assuming if you're overweight you will be eating way above this amount.

Go for long walks every night together. Take water or a hot tea in a flask (no sugar) and enjoy the time together.

Youd be amazed at how fast you'll lose weight."

Trolio,fecd8gs,t1_feblzgw,"While that's been a good premise, the reality is not all calories are created equal due to their effects on hormones; a good example is sugar. 

As a general protip for obese weight loss, intermittent  fasting has been shown to reduce weight without or with less excess skin, keto+IF increases the likelyhood of excess skin reduction.

If you're wondering why that's desirable, look up some of the pictures of dramatic weight loss.

E: it's also been found that someone who gets 6 hours of sleep vs 8 will store more fat from the same amount of calories."

madguins,fec97io,t3_eobm9r,"That’s amazing! But simultaneously frustrates me for my coworker/good friend. 

She’s a 350lb+ 5”1 woman and her bf 6”0 and exponentially as big. They’re in their mid 30s and she needs surgery on her uterus to have kids (they want to) but needs to lose a significant amount of weight first or the surgery AND pregnancy would be incredibly dangerous. She also can’t walk even a block without needing to stop and has to take uber everywhere. 

She always turns to me saying how she’s been so healthy and is a healthy size despite being on water pills and pre diabetic meds. Even for a “snack” today she had 2 cheese sticks, 2 sugary granola bars, and chocolate almonds and said how healthy it was. 

It kills me seeing her continue to gain weight but it’s hard towing the delicate line between positive encouragement and unwanted statements. But in the end she won’t be able to have the kids she wants if she doesn’t change. Her bf and her enable each other in a bad way so it’s great to see a couple that’s enabled a positive change."

I almost gave up because I thought it was impossible for me to pass that subject but the faculty handling the course helped me, he talked to me personally and offered to help me by taking extra classes just for me and that helped me a lot. He motivated me and told me i could do it and just made me believe in myself and I did clear the subject. So you too can do it man, just talk to someone who can help you and motivate you and give your 100%, you can surely do it. Don't worry too much and all the best."

karl1952,fe1il58,t3_enld9z,"Way to go--CONGRATS!

I was diagnosed with Adult ADD (today ADHD) while I was in the Navy.  I was a Senior Chief (E8). I don't know about today but in the late 80s, Ritalin was a no no.  So my stimulant of choice was coffee (black)--30 to 50 cups a day.

My wife was a Lt Commander (yes,  we have a mixed marriage), and in the process of talking with a Navy Doc at Portsmouth Naval Hospital,  the subject of ADD came up.  He (Captain) said to my wife: ""Your husband doesn't need a drug anyway-- he's a Senior Chief, he made it.""  She blew up and said: ""Maybe if he could take Ritalin,  he would be a Captain now!"" The doctor shut up.

I had been in a Navy commissioning program for enlisted back in there 70's, and did not complete my degree at the University of Washington. Turns out,  noy only do I have ADD, but I am learning disabled.

That disability was diagnosed when i was in my late 40's, working on my engineering degree at the University of Houston. I got priority seating, and double time for testing , as well as an isolated,  private room. (4 hours for an engineering test still was not enough time for me; ha ha ha.)

I ran out of time for my VA benefits,  had enough credits for a math degree,  earned that degree, got my teaching credentials, and ended up teaching high school and college math.

I was in my early 50's when I received my math degree. 

One of the side benefits of being diagnosed with ADHD/LD is, my students saw what I went through to finish my formal education, and many of my students did really well, because they no longer felt like they were 'LOSERS'.

So, good job for hanging in there.  I hope you can look back on your life when you are 67, and be happy with your accomplishments.

And YES, everybody has some level of ADHD, AND a Learning Disability-- just different levels, and in different areas.

Enjoy your life--you have a gift!"

crowleysnow,fe2xvv5,t1_fe1il58,"i’m in the process of diagnosis right now and, like you, people didn’t believe i had it because i “made it,” as in i’ve always had good grades and i just graduated with honors in a STEM degree. what your wife said really got to me. i’m doing good for myself but, hell, if i was medicated my degree could have been from MIT. i could have been a valedictorian."
sorrysuperman,fe2m4s2,t1_fe1il58,"That's a really inspiring story. Thanks for sharing! I have been feeling incompetent for all my life. I am 30 and have multiple degrees. But, I always feel that I have given only my 60-70% in each of the degrees. I could have worked hard on my previous degree and scored better grades, better experiences, better rapport with professors and colleagues. I got a PhD recently and I still feel very incompetent as I did not do enough and worked hard enough. I just hope to be someone to feel proud of once I grow old. I guess, I should just keep working hard and enjoy my life, as I make of it."

tehramz,fe2ln6l,t1_fe2kzf9,I’m 39 and I’m pretty certain I have ADD. I would love any tips you have.
Catinthehat5879,fe2xa06,t1_fe2kzf9,"Tip one: WRITE IT DOWN. No, you won't remember. Get a calendar to record appointments, homework due date, and exams, and a to do list for homework and whatever else. Re write the to do list as often as you need to, and make sure it's in a small notebook or pad of paper so that you can refer back to it.

Tip two: EVERY LITTLE BIT HELPS. Sleeping 4.5 hrs is better than 4. Spending 5 minutes on that long term project a week ahead of time helps even if that's all you get done before the day before. Take two minutes to pick up your room and organize your desk even if it really needs 4 hours. People with ADD are perfectionists and procrastinators, and the idea of doing a tiny bit feels stupid since its such a big task. It's not, it helps a huge amount, and helps break down mental blocks.

Tip three is more general but figure out what kind of study system works for you and stick to it. I liked loose leaf paper, and had a smaller binder I would bring to all classes and a larger binder at home I used for all classes. After an exam, notes until that point would go in the larger binder. I also else make those 1 sheet study guides where you dump all possible information in tiny font; those I kept in a paper protector in the small binder so that I could reference them."

UpUpDnDnLRLRBA,fe2nm32,t1_fe2ln6l,Get diagnosed and get Adderall or Vyvanse. It'll change your life.
neish,fe2w61i,t1_fe2ln6l,"I'm 32 and found out I'm ADHD this past summer. First thing to know is that ADHD, like autism and many other neurodevelopmental conditions, is a spectrum disorder. Many of us who have made it to adulthood without a diagnosis have done so because we have learnt coping strategies that have worked for us. Some of these coping skills are good and effective, and some you'll find you need to revisit as you come to understand how ADHD affects you. 

So first thing, I recommend reading Driven to Distraction. It really helped me see and understand that ADHD isn't just hyperactive little boys, and that it is truly a lifelong condition but that it also doesn't have to be a lifelong struggle. 

You should also know that ADD as a diagnosis has been rolled into ADHD as a subtype. There is ADHD inattentive type (formerly ADD), ADHD hyperactive and ADHD combined. The best way to describe the differences between them is innatentive types are inwardly hyperactive—racing thoughts, ruminating, daydreaming etc. Hyperactive type is outwardly focused—always moving, talks lots, might enjoy physical activity or taking risks. Combined type is, well, you get the best of both worlds. 

ADHD is one of the most well researched conditions out there, and there are lots of resources and support and many different options to help you adapt and cope beyond just medicine. Medicine helps many of us, but some people don't respond to it either. Structure, schedules, cognitive behavioral therapy, exercise, diet, mindfullness—all can play a role in managing the things you might struggle with. 

I recommend the ADHD subreddit, they are some of the nicest and most understanding people. Twitter also has a great community, too, with lots of people who know exactly how it feels to be on this journey :)"

KZedUK,fe3ebeu,t1_fe2nm32,"Methylphenidate is also an option, which isn’t an amphetamine."
UpUpDnDnLRLRBA,fe2txfy,t1_fe2qyz0,"Neither of those are meth. They are amphetamines (or in the case of Vyvanse a prodrug which is metabolized into dextroamphetamine), but they are different molecules with different behavior in the body. It seems a lot of people think they are the same, but they are very much not. There's also a huge difference between taking a very controlled oral dose of a therapeutic amount of a pure substance made in a pharmacological laboratory vs snorting/smoking (or however people use meth) an unknown quantity of a substance of unknown purity and unknown origin."
pangalaticgargler,fe2tv51,t1_fe2qyz0,"That’s like looking at chemo and saying is there anything other than poison.

nenonen15902,fe2wxvu,t1_fe2uc0n,"i mean neither does desoxyn, but that's meth. as someone who has been prescribed adderall, concerta, and ritalin before it's pretty frustrating when people downplay the effects of these prescription drugs. maybe i just had a shitty doc who over prescribed me but i started on 10mg adderall a day and eventually was up to 30mg. it changes your personality and perspective, and not everyone wants that. i know i didn't and i'm now off all medications and i feel like my old self again. those drugs certainly can help with academics and general performance in almost anything due to how well they get you focused, but they're not without their own major side effects and drawbacks."

I am prescribed Adderall. Yes, the effects can be downplayed and it does change your personality but for people that actually need it, it is a life saver. The differences between meth and regular ADHD drugs are also underplayed. How many people using Adderall would fit as the poster child for “faces of meth”? Not many. Meth is to adderall what spice is to normal weed."

[SciShow Psych - Why Stimulants Help ADHD](https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=yoX0vEDn5a4)

*****
As a person diagnosed late in life I have the benefit of experiencing life before and after treatment. And the ability to recognize and convey what children aren’t necessarily able to. 

My kid was diagnosed after a long and thorough process due to fears of unnecessarily medicating and trying everything from food changes and structure (we already lived like automatons just because we noticed structure minimized some of the behavioral issues). It wasn’t long before my wife recognized that I did many of the same things (impulsive, unable to regulate attention, mishear things but no identifiable hearing issues) that she recommended I discuss it with some professionals. 

I was hesitant but ultimately convinced (childhood history, etc showed the same patterns over my lifetime) and started on a very low dose of adderrall. Not long after taking it I turned to my wife and said “So that’s what you mean when you say think before you speak”. When I’m not on my medicine it isn’t that I fail to consider the possible side effects of saying something. That doesn’t happen. It’s a straight from idea to speaking. It’s hard to explain what it’s like to say something only to realize what you said after it’s out. I don’t mean thinking “uh... they look upset... let me evaluate that”. I mean saying something and then hearing it as an observer in the room.  There have been countless times where I’ll look at my wife and say “I can’t believe I just said that” 

With medicine that’s much better. Of course nothing is 100% and as people we all say/do stupid things. That’s just human. 

With that in mind I’d like to try and explain some misconceptions. Some I’ve even held myself (again... I had my own trepidation)

***Everybody has it***

Everybody has inattention and distractions. That’s true. With ADHD it’s more a matter of severity. Everybody has some sleepless nights. But insomnia is an issue because of its severity and impact. Same for sleepiness compared to narcolepsy. 

My point being that everybody experiences forgetfulness, etc. But not day in day out. I start sentences and forget to listen to the response. Leading me to ask for them to repeat their answer. Not every now and again... multiple times a day. 

I’ve put remotes into the freezer (it was in my hand when I grabbed something and then the phone rang.... and voila. The remote ceases to exist since my brain shifts gears to the call and forgets to put the remote somewhere). We all have those moments.. again, multiple times a day. 

***Misdiagnosis***

This definitely happens. The existence of a misdiagnosis doesn’t mean that a disorder does not exist. For example if 1/100 cases of blood tests showed HIV positive status. That mistaken result doesn’t mean there is no HIV patient. The key are rates. 

Here’s some info from the CDC they have a conservative rate of 5%.  They suspect it’s higher but let’s use 5% as a baseline. If an area has a rate of 10% there is likely a good deal of misdiagnosis since that’s a statistically significant variation. It may actually be 6.2% or 3.8 %. 

Additionally any people with ADHD who aren’t diagnosed are also included in misdiagnosis stats. 

There are also conditions that look like ADHD but aren’t. For example severe anxiety. It’s hard to think, concentrate, etc when you’re brain is at full throttle fighting intrusive thoughts and excessively worrying. 

Continued...."
Coldfreeze-Zero,fe1tek9,t1_fe1aw8h,"It isn't, I have ADHD and you really do not want to have it. I can't think of any reason as to why someone wants to have it."
Adama0001,fe2dbnr,t1_fe2daib,"***Medicine***

While not the only solution it is the clinical gold standard. Meaning it had the best overall outcomes in a given group of people. 

Drug companies are out to make money and their exploits in pushing drugs are well known. That doesn’t mean that the existence of a medicine is purely for that purpose. For example blood thinners work wonders for people at risk of clots. While there are cases of that condition that can be treated with aspirin and not warfarin there are legitimate cases where a person can’t take aspirin due to its effect on the stomach or other interactions. Thus, some medicines can be replaced with others but that doesn’t mean they are unnecessary. 

And the profit motive of a company or industry doesn’t prove a disorder doesn’t exist as much as it shows a different issue that needs to be addressed. 

Ritalin and other stimulants have been studied for decades. I suspect it’s one of the most studied drugs due to the time on market and the average user of the drugs are children. 

Many people think that it’s like methamphetamine and that it suffers the same addictive problems and side effects. In reality the prescription meds are substantially lower doses specifically to address these issues. And again, with decades of usage and research there are no causative relationships to problems. 

That doesn’t mean that there aren’t studies that show addictive behavior in users of these drugs. However you have to keep in mind that part of the condition itself is impulsiveness and novel seeking behaviors. A prime groundwork for addiction and if you look at people diagnosed later in life there is a tendency to see risky behavior such as arrests for dangerous driving, addiction to other drugs (even though they weren’t treated as children, etc). Eg a higher rate of addiction in the ADHD population exists in both those treated and not. 

These medicines help by speeding up the pre-frontal cortex thus allowing it to do a better job of suppressing every impulsive thought and action. Think of the pre-frontal cortex as a kind of sleepy guard/keeper who realizes the lion got out of the cage right after. The medicine helps that part of the brain to be more alert to do its thing. Such as better short term memory, impulse control and behavior management. For example at work while you’re whittling away at a task if people start walking down the hallway you don’t think to not pay attention. Your brain realizes it but you don’t consciously act on it. After awhile a few more people and your brain says “hey... check this out” and you notice and then think.  Maybe it’s a fire. Or a meeting. I better check it out. With ADHD there is no filter. We either hear everything and have to work to tune it out (exhausting) or get hyper focused (especially in novel experiences such as games) and don’t recognize it (not the best idea if there’s a fire). 

***Alternative treatments*** 

there are various ways to treat the disorder and it all comes down to how much a person wants to change/structure their life in order to minimize/avoid medication.  Getting a lot of sleep, good diet and exercise are all very helpful. As they are to anybody. 

In cases of those using medication many find that doing so helps with the others. It’s hard to be consistent with an exercise regime when you’re fighting an uphill battle with will-power (we all do) with an proverbial elephant on our back (something extra fun for those with ADHD) I really should hit the gym but then I’m distracted or doing something else (12 hour game marathon). I shouldn’t eat the cookies but again that impulsive and distracted brain finds it easy to live in the now and not think about the later until after the fact. 

For those who want to go without meds structuring your day to minimize these things helps. No bag of chips or candy on the desk where you’ll mindlessly eat. Very structured time for tasks to minimize forgetfulness (I always do laundry on Tuesday so if it’s Tuesday i need to do the laundry). I always fold clothes Tuesday night. So I need to remember to grab the clothes right. Exercise and meditation and designated times for structure are great. 

For some people that’s sufficient and I say all the more power to you. In other cases it isn’t and it’s best to get medication to help. In  cases of medication you still have to do these other things. 

***Misconceptions*** 

*Will Power/accountability* - some think that recognizing ADHD exists is some kind of cop out for personal responsibility. In reality it isn’t. And I still have will power. I just have to exercise it differently just as somebody with a family history of alcohol or substance abuse can make informed choices to avoid situations that can be a problem. 

When visiting a friend in the hospital I stand/sit with the TV at my back. Easier to focus on them. Taking my wife out to dinner?  I choose a restaurant that has less distractions. 

*ADHD means you can’t focus and thus if you can it means you don’t have it.* - that’s an unfortunate consequence of the names Attention Deficit Disorder/Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. In reality it’s a Deficit if Attention regulation.  Both in staying focused/ignoring some stimuli and in breaking away from something (games, cool new project). 

*Childhood only* - In the cases of ADHD people think that people out grow it and that, by itself, disproves it’s existence. However, as you grow up you tend to gravitate to jobs and opportunities that work with who you are. Delivery driver or other jobs that allow for moving or more novel experiences. And lots of history of jobs that don’t such as repetitive work in a factory, etc. 

In general as an adult you have more control over your day to day and can structure things to accommodate. And often that includes self mediation such as caffeine or other stimulant uses. 

Unfortunately for some it’s life changes that cause things to break down.  Kids, new job requiring non-novel tasks (congrats on the promotion... now you do weekly and quarterly reports for the team in addition to your stellar sales records). These are the times when adults find their structure and workarounds start to fail."

Maxdecimeri,fe2w6kj,t1_fe2dbnr,"Thank you for covering so much of the spectrum of ADD and other such disorders. The only way I could read through a post this long is by starting at the end. I read the whole thing paragraph by paragraph backwards. Whenever I'm presented with a lot of information that is what i do. It helps with the anxiety. Don't know what that says about me. Finishing a book can be challenging but that's a bit different. I have read plenty but it's a fight between my mind wandering and not having absorbed the last page or two and getting into that hyperfocus and not letting go. I don't know if it's ADD, OCD, severe anxiety, or a cocktail of all three. It's exhausting trying to keep my mind disciplined all day everyday. Sorry for the ramble but this post and thread struck a chord."

meeowburt,fe2mf0k,t3_enld9z,"I was diagnosed with dyslexia and adhd very early. (2nd grade and in 6th respectively) I have figured out a very effective system in order to achieve my goals and do well in uni and even have been able to stop taking medicine for my adhd. 

The key to my success I believe is built in distraction time... With my adhd and dyslexia it takes me longer to review and I have shorter patience (unless its something engrossing and I get laser focused). So, the way I combat this is setting a rigid time schedule for distractions to happen. For example, let's say I have a test in 3 days and i have yet to study for it. Instead of doing 5-6 hours a day of straight studying I take 5 hours total to do studying each day. I will spend 2 hours studying then find a stopping point and do fuck all for an hour. Its important to not think about anything you just studied. Focus on your distraction of choice. For me that video games. After the hour is up I finish my activity and switch back into studying. This built in distraction time ensures that even if I was wavering in concentration in the first two hours I feel like I'm doing a new activity and I have this refreshed sense of purpose and study for 2 hours again. This has helped me tremendously with grades and just general life projects. You can adjust the distraction times and study times a bit for yourself. But, I find that any time I spend studying past 2 hours I slow down significantly and my mind wandering becomes unable to be controlled and I pretty much waste my time anyways. 

I hope you guys benefit from this! If you have any questions pm me!"

If you don’t mind, what were your first thoughts when you decided to get diagnosed and when you ultimately got diagnosed?"
combatwombat90,fe17d4i,t1_fe12cz2,"My wife suggested I might be dyslexia in 2014/15 and I went on a waiting list for 9 months to get very cheap testing in 2017. Looking back through school it was pretty obvious. 

 I thought I had very bad memory or even early dementia in the later years of uni. I thought everyone had a bad time writing down numbers and reading out loud. I think I am bright and I didn't understand why I couldn't pass exams or concentrate in lectures. 

When I found out it was a massive relief and I was so happy that I could get tools and methods to help. I practice reading out loud most nights and remembering numbers and use study methods to help. Caffeine helps and trying to practice mindfulness."
DumbestGeniusEver,fe2rgo4,t3_enld9z,Don't want to be a dick but is that degree worth anything? If I interviewed someone and found out they took 11 years to do a 3yr course I'm probably not hiring them.

I’m very much in the same boat as op.  I want to be an electrical engineer, and I love that work so much I’m ok with being on a six year track.  I have a 3.1 gpa, I’m horrible at math (an important subject for engineers), I take twice as long to study as everyone else, and I’m 35 with over 30k in debt.

For the people who are asking for tips, resources and support, I highly recommend visiting your university/college Student Accessibility Services/Disability Services office. The staff there are trained to help you navigate being a student with a disability and can help implement academic accommodations to reduce the barriers you may be facing. 

Students with learning disabilities, ADHD, mental health issues, or physical/sensory/mobility impairments can register with their services. You don’t even need to have an official diagnosis - if you’re struggling and want to chat, go make an appointment  - at the very least they can guide you towards some resources that may help you!"

I had a feeling I had it growing up as I never study or paid attention in class as well as my brother, dad and my uncle being diagnosed with it. A teacher in high school even gave me the name sally side straddler because I would face my legs to the side of the desk and tap my leg the whole time. It was very difficult dealing with ADHD and school. School systems are built around children that can sit and study a long time and become more successful due to it. I felt at a disadvantage every minute compare to other kids in class. It also didn’t help that I came from a small town in Wisconsin where everyone is a factory worker to moving to the woodlands, Texas which everyone is an oil exec. Every kid had a tutor and a nanny where I had to teach and feed myself. One thing people don’t realize though that having ADHD can make one very passionate if you can get their focus on something. I was determine to be the first person in my family to graduate college. After 5 years I graduated with an economics degree and might even get my masters. It is possible to do it even without medication. It is a lot harder but more rewarding."

I'm currently trying to save money so i can afford some community college courses, as i dont qualify for any grants (that i know of), but im still really nervous to do it. I graduated HS with like a 1.4 GPA,  and actually have education based PTSD that makes any home work a psychological trial, my mother was just.... The absolute worst and didnt seem to get the memo that yelling at me about how i wasnt good enough till i cried, and then backing me into a corner and yelling at me more, netted zero useful things, and never once got me to finish a piece of homework successfully, and as an adult has left me in such a state that the idea of homework makes me cry and have a panic attack ... Ive got a very uphill battle, and its scary, and i still worry i dont have what it takes."

jillyann1,fe3h2p8,t3_enld9z,"I was 28 when I graduated, found out I had ADHD afterwards. I think I took Calculus 7 times and General Chemistry ten times. I worked (successfully) as a chemist and still couldn’t pass that class. I knew the stuff, I just couldn’t get it into memory and on paper at the right times. 

I finished my MS (a two year program) in a year after figuring out how to work around it and channel it to my advantage. 

I so wish I could go back and tell myself that I wasn’t stupid. It’s so easy to fall into the understanding that you’re “just not cut out” for something. If you want it- you’re cut out for it."

daisy0723,fdjfohh,t3_elnws6,I read it to my youngest son after his father died. We bonded over Harry Potter and then Percy Jackson. It's been 6 years this February and he is my only kid who reads. He just finished reading Stephen King's Dark Tower series.
Oy_theBrave,fdjlgup,t1_fdjfohh,Long days and pleasant nights. Y'all will meet again in the clearing at the end of the path.
Yinxi,fdjsgfq,t1_fdjfohh,"Hooray for kids who enjoy reading! 

I just wanted to wholeheartedly recommend ""the Wheel of Time"" series. It's 14 big books, and I could describe the feeling it gave me as a mix of Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings. I was always a huge Potterhead but now I can honestly say this is the best series I have ever read.... I hope he'll give it a shot!"
5quirre1,fdjrthm,t1_fdjfohh,"Harry Potter was what sparked my love of reading, Percy Jackson is on my list, but my next serries (after I finish Lord of the rings) is dark tower."

I also recommend showing Agatha Christie books for your kid! I used to love them as a child because her mysteries are cool, but getting a peak of Victorian England is even cooler."
Tapan681,fdk27fk,t1_fdjfohh,Harry Potter and Percy Jackson shaped my childhood. I still read/listen to them time to time. Those 2 series have a special place in my life

SlamJammer3000,fdjx4b0,t1_fdjvltp,Do you have any book recommendations to fill the void? I finished Dark Tower books like 15 years ago and still think about them almost every day.
jesus-christ-of-ems,fdlpqwl,t1_fdk27fk,I used to get grounded from reading because of these books... years later I just started rereading both series’
daisy0723,fdk4auy,t1_fdk3kc0,I did actually. A couple of months ago I commented about it. I never expect anyone to really respond to my comments. I usually just stay on 1.

Yinxi,fdkk4fx,t1_fdkf5va,*Tugs braid furiously*
ravenslxnd,fdjxe96,t1_fdjx4b0,"To me it's been 5 years only and I'm still in denial, so now I'm reading all Stephen King books to find the references Roland left on them.

Lord of The Rings is good, but it's dense and not nearly as meta. A Song of Ice and Fire is good, but it doesn't come close. The closest I ever got to feeling the same thing was with The Hollow on Netflix but it's just because of self awareness of the show itself.

I don't think I'll ever find a series this good. If I could erase one thing from my head, would be this series, so I get to experience it all again."
venusofthehardsell,fdjzmg6,t1_fdjx4b0,"Different books that sucked me in:

The Golden Compass, The Subtle Knife and The Amber Spyglass by Phillip Pullman.

Dune by Frank Herbert. Then Dune Messiah, Children of Dune and God Emperor of Dune.

The Girl With All The Gifts. It’s a zombie apocalypse story but the characters, world building, scientific zombie origin and especially the ending are fantastic.

There are other worlds than these."
maltamur,fdjyjkf,t1_fdjx4b0,"If you want some humor mixed with your fantasy- Terry Pratchett.  His discworld series is amazing  and will tide you over for awhile.  

He has 3 main series- witches, wizards and police.  There’s also death, mort and a few outliers and later books that combine them all.  I usually recommend starting with either the police series or the witches."
Tapan681,fdm60i1,t1_fdlpqwl,"Oh... was it because of religion conflict or something like that?

I am glad you read them later. I found OOTP to be the most ""real"" and interesting now,as  a child I didn't like/understand Harry's behaviour and that's why OOTP used to be my least favorite book"

Yinxi,fdk4vlr,t1_fdk1nps,Do it!!! They're turning it into a tv series so once you're done reading you can about start watching haha
jeremiahfira,fdk8e4l,t1_fdk1nps,"Highly suggest Brando Sando. I've been reading his stuff since he finished WoT, and my daughter is 12 now and just finished the first Mistborn (she's already read most of Sando's YA series, which I suggest to adults as well). I also just gave her the first WoT book, so here's to hoping she reads that next!"
redddit_rabbbit,fdlkib2,t1_fdk1nps,"I would recommend Stormlight Archive over Wheel of Time (though I would definitely read both!). Wheel of time is done, though, and Stormlight Archive won’t be for a while. 


Stormlight is...just amazing. Really incredible."
trumpet_23,fdk8fmf,t1_fdk4zq0,"All of his Cosmere stuff is really good. Mistborn was more YA than the others in the Cosmere, so if you wanted something more serious, you can't go too wrong with the others. 

If you want to dive in head-first, start with the Stormlight Archive. 3 books out so far, all huge, all great. Very deep world-building with a huge story. He has 10 books planned (book 4 comes out this November), which shows the breadth of the story he's trying to tell with them. 

If, because of your tepid response to Mistborn, you want to wade in a bit more first, go for Elantris or Warbreaker (both of which are stand-alones). I personally preferred Elantris over Warbreaker, but I really enjoyed them both. Both have much smaller stories than Mistborn or Stormlight."
wren24,fdjxwea,t1_fdjxe96,"I'm reading Insomnia right now and it's scratching that Dark Tower itch really nicely. Direct references to the Tower itself, ka, etc."
SlamJammer3000,fdkfoco,t1_fdjxe96,"Thanks! Nice recommends. I've read LOTR and asoiaf but I will check out The Hollow. 

I actually never read the last chapter of The Dark Tower just so it wouldn't be over. Still not sure what happens at the end."
jesus-christ-of-ems,fdm67i3,t1_fdm60i1,"No I just used to constantly read and read for days on end and ignore what I was supposed to do.

wanted797,fdjppf0,t3_elnws6,"I remember as a kid I never read books or wanted to read. When I was in year 1 at school (6 years old) we had a sub teacher for a long time and she started reading us Harry Potter. She then left when our normal teacher came back and never finished the book. My mum told me to borrow it from the library and we read it together. 

When we got on to the second book she always said she didn’t have time to read anymore. So I went off on my own and slowly and painfully got through them all. 

It wasn’t until I was about 22 she told me she did it on purpose to make me read. At 25 I found out I was dyslexic. I’m still a slow reader but I love books."
hlnhr,fdjwamm,t1_fdjppf0,"That’s a touching story ! That’s what moms do. Did you get all the made up words alright in HP though ? Even as a not dyslexic person, I still find it hard to remember everything lol"
Healaa,fdjz1do,t1_fdjppf0,Fellow dyslexic here! I always always hated reading books growing up as I was so frustrated that I couldn't keep up/keep it in. I found graphic novels aged 17 odd and changed everything and it feels amazing to digest stories that way. I'm currently 3/4 of the way through watchmen and cant put it down!

Kerisnescaryn,fdkq9mc,t1_fdjppf0,"Fellow dyslexic here. There is a font that helps. My ereader is so much easier to read now. It is open sourced so should be easy to get. My husband got it for me but I'll ask him when he gets home where he got it and edit my comment.

Edit: font name is Open Dyslexic."
wanted797,fdmq5vs,t1_fdjwamm,"I remember asking my mum words haha.

wanted797,fdmqbba,t1_fdjz1do,"Yeah I love books and power through them when Im into them. I still get words wrong and read slowly compared to most people.

aspiecat7,fdjuua2,t1_fdjpkrq,"Most people who had a decent enjoyable childhood will feel like others are missing out if they didn't experience the same things as them. This is somewhat of a cliche for parents. Some parents will try to force their childhood experiences onto their children.

A Goofy Movie is an example of this cliche in film. Goofy is afraid his son Max is going down the wrong path, so he tries to recreate his childhood experience with his own father. Goofy feels he came out ok because of that experience, so it should work for his son too. Which it doesn't and only pushes his son farther away from him."
MostDopeVet,fdk3f8p,t1_fdjpkrq,"Well dudes mom probably didn't have many options to read going up, depending on when she went blind. There's still a lot of communities that can't adapt to people with special needs, so I could see something like this easily happening.

Plus, if you're told for long enough that you can't do something, you won't try."
cat_prophecy,fdkapk7,t1_fdjpkrq,"I'm with you. I really hate how snooty people get about reading books. I don't really find reading fun any more and I mostly listen to audiobooks, if even that.

Something wrong?"
videohead85,fdk27or,t1_fdjq964,"I don't think so. It sounds like it just isn't your preferred way of consuming media, and that's ok."
swarleyknope,fdkihaa,t1_fdjq964,"My dad was never into books. 

He was intellectually curious and loved learning about new things, picking up new hobbies, meeting new people and hearing about their lives, traveling and learning about other cultures, etc., but the idea of reading a book just never appealed to him. 

Books just aren’t everyone’s thing. 

(TBH, this post kind of rubs me wrong - it seems so patronizing & egocentric to be bothered that someone doesn’t share her interest in reading.)"
SethsUtopia,fdjn5jh,t3_elnws6,"The ending did make me smile however, the general post sounds kinda crappy. Someone being consistently pushy for their hobby that the other party has shown clear disinterest in, and going on to say he didn't have a fulfilled childhood... I didn't even know, and still doubt, reading to your child is such a norm. I've certainly never had it and quite frankly would never have wanted it; I find fictional books incredibly boring, and there is nothing wrong with preferring other media.

The end is also redundant and makes this sound fake, why the hell does he have to read the book to her, why not an audio book?

I don't mean to be a kill joy, I just hate the idea of claiming someone lost their childhood just because it wasn't the same as yours."
Seranta,fdjsx7g,t1_fdjn5jh,"I have aphantasia. In short I do not see pictures in my head, nor do I hear sounds. So this means nearly all books I've ever tried has been a real slog to get through. People wil however always insist that I actually do enjoy reading books."
AASJ95,fdjsb6k,t1_fdjn5jh,"Same thoughts I had.  My dad is disappointed that my husband “doesn’t read” and brings it up repeatedly over the 25 years we’ve been together. Actually, hubby does read: news, comic books, mechanic manuals and trade publications, plus kids’ books to our toddler. He just doesn’t read novels because he doesn’t like them but my dad find this unacceptable."
LoExMu,fdjnhxs,t1_fdjn5jh,"I also didn‘t get read to in childhood. Mainly because when I was young, my mom wasn‘t long enough in my country to be able to read properly (even tho she could speak clearly). I didn‘t miss anything, I read books with pictures and in the end still developed a liking to books (for like 2 years?). I don‘t see what‘s so wrong about not being read to in childhood."
Hanede,fdjv4x8,t1_fdjn5jh,"It says the guy appreciated her attempt to find a book (which eventually succeeded), so he wasn't disinterested in the topic and she probably wasn't pushy.

You might find fictional books boring now but come on, if you were two or three years old you wouldn't be very critical.

""Why does he have to read the book to her instead of an audiobook?"" The point is not just letting her hear the book. Reading a book to someone is a bonding activity, he's sharing the book with her."
thiccubus8,fdjut06,t1_fdjn5jh,"Reading to children (and children reading frequently in general) helps with their intellectual development. In adulthood it’s not quite as advantageous to read on a regular basis, but it does still help keep you “sharp”. It’s also an opportunity to bond. 

I can see someone who was brought up with parents who read to them and who is aware of what I stated above being a bit sad for someone who wasn’t read to; it’s normal to want those you love to experience the positive things you got to experience. And it’s not “crappy” to want to share those experiences, especially if the other person is on board, and apparently the boyfriend appreciated it.

Also, she didn’t say he lost his entire childhood, she said he missed out on an aspect of childhood, which he did. There are many things that are pretty much unique to being a child and growing up, and being read to by your parents is one of them. So, while it’s not a part of *everyone’s* childhood, it is an aspect of childhood as a general life stage that he didn’t have."

I wonder how ""wholesome"" this post would be if it were a man making a comment about of ""devastated"" he was that this girl had never been fishing, or never watched anime or played D&D."
issiautng,fdjtrph,t1_fdjsx7g,"I have aphantasia too, but I love to read! It's more relaxing than any other type of media because it goes straight from the source to concepts, which is closest to my natural thought process. I think because I don't form pictures in my head to think, I don't process tv/movies as well. And I cant listen as fast as i can read, so turning up the speed on audiobooks to the max i can understand doesnt help."
Odysseus_is_Ulysses,fdjtfz9,t1_fdjsx7g,That sounds kind of horrible ngl. How does thought occur to you?
oyechote,fdjyhsg,t1_fdjsx7g,"Woah! I didn't even know there was such a thing. TIL.

This might be a silly question, but, if you have seen an anime and then read a manga is it still the same? Are you able to recollect character dialogues in their voice?"
SaffellBot,fdk4y82,t1_fdjsx7g,Books spend so much effort building a scene. I never really realized growing up that I would just scan character and scene descriptions to get to the part where the story actually kicked in.
SethsUtopia,fdjwqkb,t1_fdjv4x8,"Well I can't speak for two or three year-old me as I wouldn't have any memory of it, but for as long as I can remember the only reading I've enjoyed is non-fiction, and I'm certainly not the only one that feels this way. Despite this I generally dislike reading and find it boring, however it's how I learn best as it offers the most in depth explanations compared to any other medium.

I will partially concede to the rest of your message, I just wanted to clarify that people including children can already know if they would prefer an alternate means to consume fictional content than books. Saying ""come on"", is not a justification to associate being read to as a necessary aspect of having a fulfilling childhood."
Seranta,fdjuado,t1_fdjtrph,"It's funny how we are opposites here. TV/Movies work a lot better for me because I now see Harry Potter, while in the book I have absolutely no clue what he looks like. I can associate a lot more with the person Harry when I see the movies than what I read the book. I read a fair bit of manga/manwha as well."
Seranta,fdjtpnq,t1_fdjtfz9,"I only hear my own voice. Which is awkward when I have a song on my mind to be honest. It's probably for the better having had it my whole life rather than having gotten it at some point in my life, as I don't know what my life is without it."
Bananawamajama,fdkc908,t1_fdjtfz9,"I have it too.

When I think about something, I just think in terms of words. Like talking to yourself. I always thought that's how it worked for everyone, I thought the idea of picturing something in your mind was supposed to be a metaphor.

If I focus, I can kind of picture things in my head, but not persistently. It's like a reverse blink. I can get like a flash of an image, but I couldnt really tell you any details about what I pictured. Just a general idea of shape or color. And I really have to make a conscious effort to do it."
Seranta,fdk3g8d,t1_fdjyhsg,"I can do it in my voice, but not theirs."
SaffellBot,fdk5v4l,t1_fdjyhsg,The ability to create sounds in your mind and the ability to create imagines in your mind are separate. From interacting with the community it seems like the normal for people to have both though .
issiautng,fdjvo7e,t1_fdjuado,"Huh. Harry Potter was always one of my favorites! I guess to me, the way Rowling describes him is how I would describe my friends- wild, black hair, green eyes, skinny. I dont ""see"" any of my friends if they're not right in front of me either, but I still have affection for them and can enjoy their antics from stories or in online chats. If I've seen the movie too recently, I dont enjoy the book as much because my brain keep trying (and failing) to see what happens instead of just jumping straight to understanding. Its distracting to be attempting to picture or hear the characters. Often times, I'll love a character's personality by the end of a book or series and not be able to tell you the first thing about their appearance. And I love it that way."

Axelnomad1,fdjxfgh,t1_fdjwt2a,I really enjoy reading random comment threads because you never really know what you will find.  Like I enjoy books but I feel like I get less enjoyment out of then unless I set aside sufficient time for them which is hard to do for me.
SoloRules,fdka23f,t1_fdjwt2a,"There is a difference between opening a good book and reading subtitles on TV show. I agree with reading informative text on internet, but that's about it. When I said mindlessly scrolling your phone I meant spending hours on social media etc."
cat_prophecy,fdkausk,t1_fdjwt2a,"This guy only reads the classics which are superior in every way and not just actually the equivalent of YA novels of their time.

TheBoozehound,fdjbwjr,t1_fdjbuv6,Braille’s been around for quite a bit.
LoExMu,fdjnl50,t1_fdjbuv6,Audio books maybe?
ThanosTheT1tan,fdjd6io,t1_fdjbvmh,"You can’t put a book in brail really, it would be thick AF. I mean I guess you can but it would be big probably"
Oookulele,fdjtwj2,t1_fdjbvmh,"So, I study to become a teacher for visually impaired students and idk about the blind population elsewhere but at least in Germany statistics say that only 10% of the blind know how to read braille at this point in time. Maybe she only lost her sight later in life or went blind due to diabetes which often coincides with nerve damage to the fingers that may make reading braille tedious. It also becomes a harder skill to acquire the older you are and these days technology like screen readers make it possible for blind folks to get by even without braille fairy well (even if it's not ideal)"
5quirre1,fdjryyo,t1_fdjbwjr,"Yes, but the books are massive. I have seen a braille copy of an old goosebumps book, the ~100 page kids books.. it had to have been at minimum 8/11 page size, and probably at least a third of an inch thick."

NeshOxe,fdl9ld8,t1_fdk0ccg,That seems a bit far fetched. But I have done the same thing to one of my friends now that I remember. Kinda went like  “oh how do you not like playing games”
anothermanscookies,fdlap8p,t1_fdl9ld8,"It’s a thing. People think I’m just too shy to dance at weddings or just want to be invited to the dance floor. No, I’m good here. Please have fun. I will be actively bored, silly, and uncomfortable on the dance floor. It’s not about embarrassment or lack of alcohol. I just don’t like it and the burden of proof shouldn’t be on me to explain why I don’t.

I’ve done the same thing with games. I love table top games(but also hate a few specific ones) but have a friend who never wants to play any game of any kind(even drinking games when we were younger). It’s a bit mystifying to me but I’ve come to accept it."

She was sad because he missed out on something, but as she says, it was because his mum was blind. I didn't get anything from this that says she was not longer attracted to him, or less into him because of it. In fact, she says she found a book he did enjoy and she loved that he read the book to his mum.

I'm an avid reader and it always kinda blows my mind that there are people who don't have the love of books and stories I do."
hankbaumbach,fdlcf5e,t1_fdj69sy,Exactly! Modern human beings never engage in hyperbole when they are writing and they always mean precisely the words they use every single time!

coswoofster,fdjwwd9,t3_elnws6,As a literacy teacher I can tell you that there are lots of parents who don’t read to their children. (And not due to a disability).  Technology is so prolific making it easier to plunk a tablet in their hands. These kids grow up not knowing the joy of snuggling next to their parent and talking about the pictures and the story. There is a huge affective side to literacy that is being lost. And same parents then wonder why kids hate to read when they get to school. Why would they read if their parents never nurtured the love.  This child at least had a mom who  told him stories and spent time with him. Likely why he appreciates a good story but never self nurtured the discipline of reading text. All it takes a a good book and he will now be hooked for life.
couldbestabbed,fdjx0mq,t3_elnws6,"I fully believe my mom reading Harry Potter to me when I was 4 is what helped me love books. Although even before that I would take all my toys out of my toy box, sit in it, and look at my picture books. Then in 3rd grade I had an amazing teacher that made it a point to read to us. If we were good, he'd take us outside to do it if it was nice weather.  I also remember there was a restriction on what age level books we were allowed to check out at the library in elementary, but I read too fast and they became too easy, so the librarian got my mom's permission to grant me an exception, and it was like a whole new world opened up. In high school I'd check out five books at a time and have them back in two weeks. Exposing kids to books really makes a difference in their lives growing up.

The thought of never having any of that is almost devastating."

She would order books out of a catalog at a 100 bucks + a pop and have to wait 2-3 months get the shipment.

Reno83,fdjzidm,t3_elnws6,"It's a heartwarming story, but I hate the general premise: I'm disappointed you don't like to read for fun. I know reading is important and being able to read well is a trait of many successful people, however, people who read for fun always have this air of superiority. There are other forms of media out there that are more appropriate for other people's brains to digest information or entertain themselves with. Now, somethings you have to be able to read and comprehend, but why would I spend days reading Harry Potter when I'm an audio/visual learner and find the movie (series) much more rewarding. I know, I know, ""the book is way better."" Personally, I prefer to binge Netflix than read, I do enough reading for work."
beingjac,fdk5aqp,t1_fdjzidm,"We all have our preferences. I don't think reading books means someone is superior. I personally prefer movies/tv shows over books.

Reno83,fdk88lr,t1_fdk5aqp,"Agreed. It's just the choice of conjunctions, ""...I met a guy I really, really liked, **but** he didn't read..."" It kind of gives the impression that not reading is an undesireable trait or he is somehow lacking. For example, consider this phrase: ""The girl was cute, **but** she liked cats."" Her preference for cats should have no bearing on her cuteness, nor should it be a basis for not considering her as a person of interest or potential partner. In context, after reading the entire post, the reason he didn't read is quite unfortunate. Maybe ""...I met a guy I really, really liked that didn't read...""

I enjoy reading fiction, although I haven’t much lately due to other time commitments. When I do listen to an audiobook it takes a lot longer than reading the same book.   

The only efficiency I get out of audiobooks is being able to listen to them while driving. But since driving requires attention, I find I can’t focus enough on the audiobook and have to frequently rewind to re-listen to bits I missed. So generally I prefer audiobooks that I have previously read as a book, so I already know the story and if I get distracted by something else I can still follow along with the narration without have to rewind."

I felt more intimidated than he did; I was just really hoping people would be patient with him and now complain about a little guy being in the way. 

All the other kids there were really awesome. They helped him when he fell, let him have his ""turns"" and gave him high fives. As it turns out, skater culture is pretty friendly."
pm_me_your_nostrills,fdzhwco,t1_fdts49k,Did you mean would've?
LastBaron,fdyxavs,t1_fdtw4wx,"I never understood why skaters got a bad rap as being troublemakers. I only knew a few skaters back in middle school/high school but they were almost universally this sort of laid back wholesome dude. The “worst” thing they did was smoke some weed (considered a bigger deal 20-30 years ago). 

But they had no time for vandalism, or starting fights, or any of that stuff. They were too busy skating."
122899,fdxdtde,t1_fdvg1go,"yeah, all the skaters i know are super nice people as well"
Liz4984,fe3zpcc,t1_fdzhwco,"Oh, yeah! Didn’t even catch that. My iPhone autocorrects my stuff all the time."
HeadbangerNeckInjury,fdyxs44,t1_fdyxavs,"Yeah we all smoked weed but were good enough lads, the worst thing we did was skating around our school at night and the caretaker lived next door and would chase us around the grounds.

No cameras then either, he saw us in school the next day with an angry look on his face."
TitsOnAUnicorn,fdzo6lt,t1_fdyxavs,Because people are closed minded dicks and need an easy target to demonized and be better than without actually having to work on thier character. Skateboarders just happen to be that easy target to those people for whatever reason. It's a lot easier to make a monster of someone than to get to actually know them.
MunmunkBan,fdzt2p6,t1_fdyxavs,I grew up on a surfing strip.  Weed and laid back really.  Less arseholes than a lot of other sub cultures.
lordpiglet,fdzz70l,t1_fdyxavs,Because they (we) are stereotyped as being anti-authority and not liking to be told what to do.   Some of this is definitely part of the culture.
grangry,fdxzkgg,t1_fdxdtde,I’m glad it’s this way now. When I was skating (years and years ago) the scene in my town hated kids and didn’t treat them very well.
fuckdjkhaled,fdyypxn,t1_fdxdtde,"That’s been my experience too and a big part
of what got me into skating. Except max, fuckin prick"
LastBaron,fdyzca5,t1_fdyxs44,"Lol exactly!  90% of the rules they broke were done so they could skate as often as possible and in as many places as possible. 

Twisted deviants, they were not."
122899,fdyzyee,t1_fdyypxn,yeah fuck max
fuckdjkhaled,fdz6ngv,t1_fdyzyee,He was the type of kid who thought he was better than everyone at everything then got butt hurt when someone proved him wrong. Damn good skater tho lol
Infinityand1089,fdzqjj4,t1_fdyzyee,What an asshole...
scrumbagger,fdtxspg,t3_en2ir0,"I can guarantee if she went to the park when people were there they would help her and push her around, the skaters I knew when I was in HS were some good people.   

That smile at the end gets me every time..."
dmmge,fdua2ux,t1_fdtxspg,"Can confirm. The skatepark kids are some of the nicest kids in my city.

Reminds me of a few months ago, a younger kid probably around 7-8 did his first ollie and a group of older boys instantly surrounded him, cheering him on to do it again and going wild when he landed it the second time."
EnglishTeachers,fdx5t7s,t1_fdtxspg,High school teacher here. My skaters and metal head students are always the most polite!!!
scrumbagger,fduhrkx,t1_fdua2ux,"Oh hell yeah! I have seen the same but it was a little guy busting a kick-flip off a box, was a beautiful thing to see a whole park cheering on the kid, we all want that feel."
Libxi,fdx916k,t1_fdx5t7s,"As a Metal Head, I can personally confirm this!"
lol_and_behold,fduttl1,t1_fduhrkx,"The closest thing I've come to this feeling as an adult, is if you go indoor climbing. People are always cool and encouraging to beginners and cheer you on a lot, and if you come often, people know which problems you're struggling with, so when they finally sit, it's often some comraderie stoke."
scrumbagger,fduz4jm,t1_fduttl1,"huh, thats pretty cool! I'm really into backpacking and there is definitely a comradery on the trail. Me and some buddies ""saved"" a father and son who had not planned to be on half dome at sunset. It felt fucking awesome to be able to help people that really needed it."
HeadbangerNeckInjury,fdtfe4k,t3_en2ir0,"Nicest thing i have seen so far this year.

They are always so appalled ""you gotta love your mom she gave birth to you. How could you do that to your mom?"" Well you know cause she is a terrible person. The silver lining is that my step-mother is amazing and she really gave me a mother figure i could trust and love again. At this point she is my mom. And I love her."

hexa161,fe97nm7,t3_en2ir0,"putting that in spoiler because i don't want to ruin the post's mood but like...

 ||not to be that person but like...

She kinda gambled her kid's life for the selfish purpose of having a kid. Sure i get the whole trying to fix problems, but in the end she still gambled someone's existence in order to try and have a 0% chance of having a perfect life, and if she didn't want her kid to have a perfect life then she willingly let someone suffer by being born

I know this is depressing and all, but watching that made me a bit sick inside. We could stop all of this suffering, for everyone, yet we just get kids for us to be happy, which is a selfish decision if you ask me

I know this is a bit depressing, but i feel like its not fair to let people gamble a child's life without their consent for selfish purposes, idk...||"

My sister and the other woman were on the floor hugging and she gave my sister her sash.  This was her 2nd wedding and my sister to feel extra special since this was her 1st bachelorette party. And hopefully the only one.

Reneeisme,fe5xnww,t1_fe5jsvx,"OMG YES.  The heartfelt advice I've received at midnight from some drunk total stranger in a bathroom.  And the advice I've blurted out to some crying women in the same.  I mean, drunk girls in general are the best to confide in.  There's all the emotion, and empathy, and all the usual walls are down.  But something about the bathroom just takes it up a notch."

PM_Me_Nordic_Legends,fe5vcn6,t1_fe5srzw,"I was at waiting the men's room in a bar last night. There were two guys who knew each other and we're talking, and whenever a new person a walked in someone would shout a warning not to use the stalls (they were fucked up), but for the most part we stared at out feet while we waited, then when someone got to the single working urinal, they'd feel incredibly uncomfortable knowing that they were 5 feet away from a crowd of men who also had to pee, and it was just uncomfortable silence for everyone. Meanwhile I could definitely hear giggling and drunk shouting from the adjacent women's room, so I can only imagine the schenanigans happening in there."
haanyaa,fe60l03,t1_fe5srzw,"I can attest this as well. I was at a bar washroom before my performance (i perform pop dances at bars), was just going to finish my business and go. I ended up doing eyeliners for two girls, did someone’s braids, and hugged one that was crying because she just broke up. When I was performing with my group I can hear the girls cheering me at their booths, pronouncing my name with a slight slur because they are drunk. 

Stranger friendship in the women’s washroom is way too underestimated.

Oh and I invited the girl that broke up to my house to play games on my PC with me to get her mind off of things. She wasn’t super into the Steam games so we had a fun time drinking iced tea and playing fireboy+watergirl. She majored in arts and I do compsci, so our lives would’ve never crossed at any other places. 10/10 i would’ve go to bar bathrooms just to make new girl friends and make sure they can go home"

savor_today,fe163be,t1_fe05twi,"Do a lot of research. They’re actually quite the handful as in they’re very timid creatures. It’s not what you think of when you think of a dog being all excited for life with no fear. It basically wants to curl inside a blanket for 90% of life. It’s not begging to go for a walk, on adventures or anything you normally think of in a dog. It can sometimes take 30 minutes to use the restroom bc it’s slightly windy, and a loud noise happened type things such as simply a car driving by. You have to have a shit ton of patience. If something is happening in the house that you need to raise your voice to someone to stop something falling over, it’ll think you’re yelling at it. They don’t like loud noises and take everything personally. 

Know what you’re getting into. This could be great for someone who’s retired, works from home, and lives in a quiet and warm environment. Better than getting one and abandoning it basically is all I’m saying, since that does tend to happen with breeds like these. They’re cute as hell, fun in small bursts, and very very sweet- but don’t expect a normal dog. Almost more like a timid cat."
Omophorus,fe2hbeq,t1_fe05twi,"If you want a smaller greyhound that's sturdier and less timid, check out whippets.

BraveNewNight,fe2iaua,t1_fe1ufy7,"> suggest walking them at least 5 or 4 times a week 

Normal dogs need walkies 2-3 times a day. That sounds extremely low maintenance for a dog"
546875674c6966650d0a,fe2xzvd,t1_fe2iaua,"These guys don't need multiple walks a day, true. They would much rather sleep curled up next to you 80%of the day. But, for everyone's sanity 2 or 3 times a week, in a safe confined park/area, let them off leash for zoomies. 

Mostly they are more emotionally needy than many typical breeds. They are often called 'velcro dogs' because of their strong bonds they make with their humans. 

However, I don't think the timidness has to be a thing. My boys are fairly fearless, and are very outgoing and social. I think that is also mainly due to me not treating them as fine China like many owners do. They are more delicate that about or a Shepard, but not made of glass really.

fightingkangaroos,fe6muwq,t1_fdzyhvx,"Lol in a way, yes. Our first rescue is a 20 lb mutt who's a very alpha male so we had to get females that were smaller so he wouldn't start fights with them. He watches over them like crazy, he grooms them and if the girls start play fighting he gets upset and breaks it up. If we go for a walk and someone gets too close to the girls he'll put himself in front of them to protect them and the girls wont eat unless he does. Whenever they sleep they either sleep all side by side squished together and with all of their butts touching and facing different ways. 
The girls had a sister but she was adopted before we got there, they were named after the Powerpuff girls so we have Bubbles and Blossom.

Crash3636,fdy3p17,t3_enav4r,This makes me think of my dog and if she misses her siblings. I found her at a shelter and would have no hope of ever finding her siblings. Actually makes me sad.
EssentialHeart,fdyky38,t1_fdy3p17,She has you. She’ll be fine :)
OrCurrentResident,fdysl4b,t1_fdy3p17,It’s often a bad thing to adopt littermates together. So don’t worry about it.

Crash3636,fdytk2n,t1_fdysl4b,Can you elaborate?
OrCurrentResident,fdyyld6,t1_fdytk2n,I just grabbed the first link without reading but it’s called [littermate syndrome. ](https://blog.betternaturedogtraining.com/2013/07/18/littermate-syndrome/)   It’s a high separation anxiety co dependency syndrome.
abrookman1987,fdzyek5,t1_fdytk2n,"They come with their own pack, so they won’t integrate into their new one as well."

MrSnowden,fdzcam5,t3_enav4r,We adopted two cats. Turns out they came from the same household. And hated one another. The big one Bea up on the fluffy one every day. So sad. Then we got a puppy. They united in hate for the puppy and the big cat began protecting the fluffy cat.  Then] enemy of my enemy is my friend.
UnsolicitedDogPics,fdy2oqc,t3_enav4r,Well that was adorable.
ppadru1,fdz58zk,t3_enav4r,It’s like they want to embrace each other but aren’t equipped with the right physical bodies to do so
Kamiks0320,fdzfwvh,t3_enav4r,I sometimes feel bad for dogs when they're super happy they literally would like to explode but they can't
DewyMossEmpire,fdxegjv,t3_enav4r,Ugh this is too emotional for me rn .
Gorborg,fdywiie,t3_enav4r,There're way too many feel good stories about litter mate addoptions on reddit. Ive heard a lot of stories about people who addopt litter mates because they feel bad for separating the puppies and later have to get rid of one anyways because the dogs were put of control.
Wiryk9,fe0abpp,t1_fdywiie,"Yep. Hate to be that person, but you’re right to say that adopting two puppies at the same time is a risky move. It’s called “littermate syndrome.” *It doesn’t happen to everyone,* but it’s important to watch out for the signs regardless. What ends up happening is that two puppies who are around the same age and are raised together (they don’t need to be littermates) can become co-dependent and may not focus on bonding with their owner or with other pets. It’s like they become each other’s security blanket. This has a negative impact on socialization and training. Eventually, the puppies mature once they reach 1-3 years old (depends on the breed). Sometimes they still get along (but now they are extremely bonded to each other to the point one cannot be removed without the other one having a meltdown), sometimes the siblings become intolerant of each other and end up fighting.

Keep in mind that littermate syndrome hasn’t been formally studied/researched very thoroughly, so it is unfortunately the kind of thing that is only brought to awareness by trainers or behaviourists who have observed it. This is common in the dog world since ethologists had not bothered studying dogs until around 30 years ago. If I had to make an educated guess, I would imagine that the impact/severity of littermate syndrome has a lot to do with the breed and temperament of the puppies, the manner in which the puppies are raised, and the owners themselves."

Koreeos,fdq3qs3,t1_fdq1g0h,"Isnt the average income in New Zealand like 2k less than the US? For a country with 323 million less people, that seems pretty good to me"
Saysoup,fdq1phv,t1_fdq1g0h,"While food may be expensive, houses cost more than both your kidneys, I still like to think our inequality has plateaued a few years ago and we’re just stuck like this. All in all cool birds here 10/10."
Yzard27,fdqyfwe,t1_fdq1g0h,Lower average income doesn't make much of a difference if costs of living are also lower. Average salary where I live (UK) is also lower than that of the US ( $39k USD in the UK Vs $56.5k USD in the USA). I don't think that the average person here has a shittier life than the average person there though. Income isn't the only thing that determines quality of life.

tiaradactyl,fdllaus,t1_fdlet0n,I mute every video that has music over the actual sounds. Sure this has the regular noise in the background but it's annoying as fuck listening to someone's chosen sappy song rather than actually hearing what's going on.
Caasi72,fdletym,t1_fdlet0n,"Jesus, I sure did say video a lot"

sammich4allseasons,fe5fzs6,t3_enr9ha,"Reminds me of my goldfish. He was a mere table decoration (among many others) at my high school graduation dinner. Afterwards, when staff were cleaning up the tables I asked what were going to happen to the fish, which they told me they were going to dispose of them, and if I was interested in keeping him I could take him home in the decorative vase.
He lived 5 years in my care, and though he was a common comet goldfish, he deserved better than a life thrown away."
Breyze19,fe5gbon,t1_fe5fzs6,"Cute story, thank you for sharing!"
Jordy999,fe613yq,t1_fe5fzs6,"I had a similar experience. After some gala I saved all the goldfish from the tables, and ended up adopting them out to my co-workers. I can’t believe people still use animals like this."
AnnyPhoenix,fe5gwph,t1_fe5fzs6,"Aww, thanks for sharing, got me irrationally angry and happy at the same time. Poor fish, I'm just so happy you took him."

DiamondCreeper123,fe65x02,t1_fe65vy8,"Wow, I didn’t even know that, TIL."
Blacktigerlilly42,fe6y6j0,t1_fe6ie31,Huh?
ToxicPilot,fe66tvw,t1_fe65x02,They usually have much shorter lifespans in captivity because people don't take proper care of them. Goldfish cannot live in a bowl. They need lots of room and a very robust filtration and aeration system because they produce a lot of waste.
DiamondCreeper123,fe66we4,t1_fe66tvw,"Yea, totally forgot about that."
justahumblecow,fe6ewkf,t1_fe66we4,"Not to mention the fact that they are a species of carp and even the $0.50 goldfish at the pet store can grow upwards of 12 inches long.


Here's the thing, they will stay small in a small bowl in the same way that a child's feet will stay small if you bind them with wire. Any fish kept in a tank too small will eventually die a painful death as their bones stop growing but their organs continue to grow inside of them, being slowly and painfully crushed by their own size."
larryismydog,fe6jsbr,t1_fe6ewkf,"When my dad was a kid, his parents put a gold fish in their stock tank.  That thing grew to be almost a foot long. I know he wasn’t lying because they stuffed & mounted it."

salqura,fe5r6xt,t3_enr9ha,One time I was cleaning my fish bowl and my fish fell down the drain and my uncle rushed over and took the pipe off and he was there and alive! My uncle got pulled over for speeding but the cop let him go when he heard the story
Karihaber23,fe6fw3n,t1_fe5r6xt,"I have a similar story! When I was a kid, my dad was cleaning the fishbowl and my fish jumped out of the temporary bowl she was in. She ended up down the sink drain/garbage disposal. My dad fished her out with a spoon and she was fine. Had a few tiny scrapes on her though. 

Same fish also survived a tank explosion. We had the fish in an aquarium for some time until the side of the tank just exploded one night. The water, pebbles, and some decorations flooded out. My fish was fine but my brothers fish was crushed my a ceramic sign."

fanciestofnancys420,fe67c47,t1_fe3yxyj,"I’ve saved a road trippin’ beta with a cold bottle of water.   His bowl flipped over in the car, and it was all I could do.  He was a G.   Never know!"
OxymoronicallyAbsurd,fe6oxhc,t1_fe3yxyj,"Probably, especially with the dirty floor"
Hanede,fe7rgb2,t1_fe3yxyj,"I mean it was already in a bag with water to begin with, it's not like the man was transporting the fish in a fish tank on the train."
snakesearch,fe5rq0m,t1_fe42c45,"what if you shake up the water in the bottle, would that provide enough dissolved oxygen?"
heatedcheddar,fe6kzu6,t1_fe5x1ks,"Not just that. When you properly set up a fish tank, you let the water ""cycle"" for a month until the chemicals are just right. The water from a water bottle wouldn't be closed to the levels of a cycled fish tank. 

Also, fish need some kind of disturbance on the waters surface to get oxygen into the water.

Wonderful thoughts, very sweet, but this post is no fun when you keep 10+ fish tanks 😓"
Hanede,fe7r62g,t1_fe6kzu6,"Well yeah but the fish didn't spend all his life living in that coffee cup with bottled water. Also it was previously in a bag with water, which didn't have any cycling either. It was just being transported (hopefully to a proper tank)."
heatedcheddar,fe8pq11,t1_fe7r62g,"The bag of water would be cycled, though. Assumedly, that bag of water would be from its already established fish tank at the pet store. And it really depends on the levels in the water bottle - if it has a high ammonia (which some water does, cause it kills bacteria, I believe) it won't work even temporary.

And we have to assume all these factors added with the fact that the goldfish's slimecoat is messed up and the dude is stressed after flopping on the ground and being put in foreign water."

just-onemorething,fe61ne2,t1_fe4aubv,"Tbh, it might sting a bit but as long as he gets him into proper water soon, bottled water would likely not bother him in the long run. What would be more of a danger is his slime coat being disturbed by flopping on the floor and being scooped up, along with whatever coffee, sugar or artificial sweetener, and milk residue was in the cup."
Nhinja,fe639ow,t1_fe4aubv,Any kind of water is preferable to suffocating on a train.
javatata,fe6ftpf,t1_fe4aubv,I kept a fish for a few years on tap water
Calligraphie,fe6449r,t1_fe4bo21,"As per a science experiment I did in high school biology, fish are in fact affected by caffeine and also get the jitters."
justahumblecow,fe6f851,t1_fe6449r,"Fishes' brains are actually pretty similar to humans' in terms of chemistry and reactions to different chemical balances. It's for that reason (and others) that some drugs that are meant to affect mood are tested on fish!


It's also why painkiller drugs were able to be used to prove that fish feel physical pain (still don't know why that myth exists)"

cornylamygilbert,fe6lo74,t1_fe5zomg,uhhh more importantly the temperature change would shock the fish
CaptainCroft,fe6bzd0,t3_enr9ha,The fish probably still died. You just can't move fish from one source of water to another. They need to be acclimated. The shock can still kill them.

DrunkOnThatGoodSushi,fe5x09d,t3_enr9ha,"I love the hypocrisy of us humans. Like, how everyone is all ""Yeah!

Breyze19,fe5xrqb,t1_fe5x09d,"You have a point there, but as humans, we assume that them living is better than them not living, even if it's not a particularly enjoyable life"
G47_51,fe6kdbx,t1_fe5x09d,And they are going to have fish for dinner soon enough too. They don’t give a crap about THAT fish.

just-onemorething,fe61uah,t1_fe5x09d,Being a fish in a good home can be a magnificent experience. I know my fish are as happy as any fish can be.
Zanki,fe63avm,t1_fe61uah,"Mine are healthy, have nothing to fear, live in a tank big enough for them and have full stomachs. Keeping them in a cage sucks, but at the same time, they can't miss what they've never had. They live in low tech planted tanks, all natural beyond the filter, bubbler, heater and light. It's as natural a life as I can give them without setting them free."
AnandShakti,fe5ugv5,t3_enr9ha,Yeah!!

All jokes aside, I’m also losing weight and getting close to my goals. It is the absolute best “life upgrade” anyone can do, to actually feel comfortable in your own skin.

It’s not about being better looking than those around you, it’s about being better than your former self. To physically look and to *feel* the results of NOT wasting the limited time in your life. 

Fuckin’ A-1 mate."

I am in the exact same situation you were in but a little further down the line and while you never get to feel awesome all the time, the difference is night and day compared to being overweight.

She can't get the hang of ""go into text app, find my name from the previous conversation, click on it, type in text"".  She always, unfathomably, messes up somewhere in the process -- it can take her 5 minutes to send a very simple text.  Shockingly, I managed to teach her how to use Voxer to send me a voice message!! It is hysterical, she always starts out by telling me who it is. ""Vernicious, this is yaw mutha..."", as if 1. I can't tell it's her from the fact that it's her name and picture next to the conversation, 2. I can't tell from that accent lol.   She also leaves a ""goodbye"" as if we were talking on the phone and she's saying goodbye -- she cannot adjust to a non-telephone-call type interaction.  This is actually not annoying, it's a ""make me smile"" whenever she does it."

My mom.has Netflix and as we all know it allows for multiple screens, so she insists both her sisters use hers. Most people don't think much of sharing with their loved ones lmao"

navicitizen,fdwv1k7,t1_fduvqj5,"I saw an interview once of homeless person explaining what their pet does for them. That pet gives them a reason to live again. It was very moving.

sketchapt,fdxwub7,t3_en5nrl,"Think about all the behavioral issues house dogs pick up from being left alone all day, under socialized, under exercised, etc. 

Now think about what homeless dogs get: constant exercise, constant human companionship, constant new situations/environments/people to learn how to behave. 

Dogs are migratory pack animals and frankly, a homeless life provides a lot more opportunities for them to do what they do naturally, migrate, adapt, learn."
cRuSadeRN,fdzvlpr,t1_fdxwub7,"I feel like dogs taken care of by homeless people have a better experience because of that. They are out, taking in all the sights and smells, always being stimulated and learning.

The sort of society that cares more about the guys dog than the guy himself isnt doing him a great service. Yea fuck the so called activists for their shitty behavior.

There's an old hospital in my city that was turned into a residence for the elderly folk..it wouldn't be a stretch to turn something like that or buy vacant buildings and turn them into a sort of halfway house (don't snap I'm not implying anything about drug use in the homeless communities or anything like that my brain can't think of the right verbage I'm looking for) where they can get help applying for assistance and paying small rent for basic amenities and help setting up savings to get them moving from there..I'm in NO way able to make this a reality but it's an idea..maybe someone reading this has the resources and contacts to get a ball rolling somewhere. Sometimes all you need is someone in your corner.
DeliciousGlue,fdwjgpx,t1_fdwej4i,"At least where I live there are a fair bit of those types of buildings, but the problem is that the occupants kinda get stuck there, not being able to move on. It's still great that they have a roof over their heads and a safe, individual place to live in(shelters are god awful violence and rape centrals). It's a shame that these people tend to need way more help to actually transform their life beyond the living situation than what we as a society have allotted as resources."
z00k33per0304,fdwyprl,t1_fdwjgpx,"My Gramma used to say ""it takes a village to raise a child"" same can be applied to most anything I think. It's easy to talk about a problem but we (not us specifically us as in the larger hive mind of society) need to make it a priority to find people to actually make a difference. Have these kinds of places set up and have dedicated staff or qualified volunteers from banks or life coaches or whatever the majority of people using the service need to succeed and thrive. Sucks that I'm not in a position to make any of it happen and peeves me off to think that the ones pointing saying it's an issue haven't put as much thought into it as we are now."

Because ""There will come a day where they will have to choose between eating and feeding their dog, and they won't choose the dog."" I love the rescue so far, but that statement made me so sad. It felt really ignorant about homeless people and how they treat their pets."

DeathMavrik,fdh7vbh,t3_elc5fy,"its hard to remember that this 'therapy' is essentially who gets killed first  


so I can completely understand why he looks half  angry half happy"
DoggoPunch,fdhsfiq,t1_fdh7vbh,What do u mean the therapy gets killed first
will1999bill,fdik7h8,t1_fdh7vbh,"Not exactly. I had ALL (2.5 years beyond treatment now) and went through the chemo. The idea is to kill your immune system. ALL is essentially white blood cells that never mature and die. They crowd out your normal white blood cells to the point that there is pressure in your bones and it actually hurts. You become susceptible to infection and that's what kills you.

 The first six months are the hardest and your immune system is hit the hardest then. But, since everything is made in your bone marrow, the chemo also lowers your platelets and red blood cells. They can't target just your white cells. I got sepsis from my own internal bacteria and almost died from that. Also had pneumonia a couple of times throughout treatment. Note that there are different regimines  for different people. Age, physical condition etc. come into play. The younger you are the harder they can hit your immune system to get all of the ""cancerous "" cells."
the1992munchkin,fdhssmf,t1_fdhsfiq,Either the cancer cells get killed by the drugs or the body will totally be whacked to the point where it's less painful to live with cancer than to continue with the treatment.
SoVerySleepy81,fdht1yz,t1_fdhsfiq,"Chemo is poison. Basically it's a gamble when toxic treatments have to be used. Who is going to win? Will the patient be able to outlast the cancer? Chemo is used because it's the only thing that works for a lot of cancers but that doesn't mean it's a healthy thing for your body. It can cause infertility, weaken the immune system, cause secondary cancer etc. So in this case either the chemo kills cancer or it (the cancer) kills Matt."
Madmordigan,fdhtluw,t1_fdhsfiq,It's getting you as close to death as possible without killing you to kill the cancer.
DeathMavrik,fdhx6ew,t1_fdhsfiq,"depending on the therapy chemo/radio you are trying to kill cells that are exactly the same as every other cell in your body except for the big difference of having malfunctioning DNA that is calling for a completely uncontrolled growth cycle. Most therapies try to go for the fact that these fast growing cells are extremely greedy/hungry and will try to accumulate anything that is meant for the whole body. 

With chemo, your putting in strong chemicals that are meant to target cells that are abnormally fast growing, however there is no other way for us to tell those drugs to NOT go for the healthy cells too so you are killing both parties. But the hope is that these chemicals will kill the cancerous cells before they kill the host which can be alot harder if they are stage IV cancer which means the cancer has spread through your body.

Radiotherapy is just irradiating areas that are known to have the cancerous cells to destroy the rest of their DNA in the hopes that you can minimize the damage. But again there are healthy cells in that area too so there are casualties on both sides.

I am in NO means an expert but the problem with cancer is that a piece of YOU malfunctioned and your body can't recognize it so we have to try and use its greedy nature as our one advantage to kill it, all the while trying to figure out other means."
DeathMavrik,fdjfmuy,t1_fdik7h8,"Thank you for sharing your story, and also thank you for the explanation of your treatment! I haven't studied cancer treatments too well  but I just based it off of the most basic understanding that i was taught and we didn't cover it too in depth in class as it wasn't the main subject matter.  


Also nice job kicking its ass!"
will1999bill,fdikg2n,t1_fdhssmf,You can't live with ALL. It will kill you quickly. You will die from infection if it doesn't go away.
MC1R-OCA2,fdive23,t1_fdht1yz,"It's the chemo kills the cancer, or the cancer kills Matt. If you stop chemo, the cancer would still kill him."
will1999bill,fdikoih,t1_fdhx6ew,You put it the best. But the chemo won't kill you. The cancer or infection kills you.
SoVerySleepy81,fdivk9a,t1_fdive23,"Thank you, I was looking at my comment and couldn't figure out quite what was wrong."

jacksonismydog,fdit746,t1_fdiodv3,I cry my eyes  out every time.  I am always super happy for them but at the same time I get angry.  Not at my friends who won because I know what their fight was like. I just pity myself as I lay there mainlining poison and thinking about  when I  didn't have cancer.  Then I think what it has done to my family. It will be my turn one day.
stanleythemanley420,fdjt6te,t1_fdit746,You got this and ring the hell out of that bell when it's your turn. ❤
human_promise,fdkfp3l,t1_fdit746,"Do you think there should be a bell for this? I’m curious what kind of an impact it has. I really hope that you get to ring it! ... (And that the cancer will go far, far away) :)"
jacksonismydog,fdlhw4i,t1_fdkfp3l,"Sure, ring a bell if it makes you happy. The impact on me is minimal but the impact on the bell ringer is HUGE! I think it is important to understand completely that ringing the bell says you are done with chemo, not necessarily cancer. Chemo is a step in the cancer process that continues long after they unplug my bag of poison. After chemo I can expect a battery of tests for life and other procedures that for me include joining two halves of my intestines together. The bell simply means you are done with the worst thing that can happen to a person (the meds them self). Cancer sucks but chemo sucks at a whole new level. I'm so happy with the outpouring of support,  but folks need to know the end of chemo is not the end of cancer. Running around saying someone beat cancer because they stopped chemo is not necessarily factual and can end up as a bitter and sad disappointment. Sadly once my chemo is done and the tests level out and my insides are all back together, I will still be looking over my shoulder for cancer at every move. You get it once and you are now prone for getting it again. I can be 4 months free of stage 4 colon cancer but get lung cancer in four years. I'll always worry when I get a cough a bad headache or wonder should I give up bacon and hot dogs or grilled steaks or black jelly beans. I will not know I've beaten cancer until I die of old age. I'll ring my bell in thirty years, then I'll know I beat cancer.  I am a low key person by nature and I don't really need or want the world to know a lot about me. The friends I've made in treatment know what I go through as I know what they are up against. We don't need bells to tell each other what is going on. My loved ones know whats up as do all the great people who help me get better. I'm not sure of where the bell comes from but if you want to ring one because you finished chemo then do it loud and proud, you earned the right to. For me is says I'm done with that part of my trip but I learned not to celebrate too early because it usually ends in disappointment. I do not want to be disappointed over chemo. You will know I am off of my chemo when I drink a glass of iced tea with actual ice cubes or I eat ice cream or maybe an ear of corn on the cob. I'll take a hug and a wish for good luck going forward. I know this sounds kind of pissy but chemo messes with emotions and I have good days and bad."
human_promise,fdo6hup,t1_fdlhw4i,"I can only imagine how it is, and even though I’ve been through this and that, I am probably not even close. It must be hard to know if it is coming back or not, if hope it doesn’t weigh too heavy on you. Hopefully medicine will advance rapidly, and cancer will become less of a threat than it is today. For some people, their time isn’t even worth much because they think they got infinite, and for others a couple of days would be the dream unavailable. 

I wish you well my friend, and if it is any consolation- nobody knows for sure they will get to grow old, so I guess in many ways we all want to ring that bell when we get to that age, whenever that will be.

Good luck, and a big hug."

Just a heads-up for other college students who might be considering a gift to their professors: depending on your school's policies, it's entirely possible that your professors can't accept a gift (at some state colleges, it might even be illegal). 


Source: know a state college professor who had to decline a gift at the end of last semester. Apparently, her place makes a huge stink of it. 


Still, props to OP for making their prof feel appreciated."

I moved to the opposite side of the globe from my best friend two and a half years ago and one of the saddest things I have to deal with is all the good times I'm missing with him because of the time difference and the cost of flights. This made me instantly tear up thinking of what it will be like the next time I get to hug him.

Defence must be actively encouraging their employees to do this. Keeps public perception of troops positive so that if you question America starting another war for profit you are insulting these ""American Hero's""."
snklFrtz10,fdju8u3,t1_fdjrkju,"Lol, no. The opposite actually. They are told not to travel in uniform so as not to become a target if something were to happen. I agree with you on the changing thing. Dude absolutely had time. Probably been home for days. He likely did it for photos and internet points. Also, sorry about all the fires."
mac2914,fdk86bv,t1_fdjrkju,He wanted to hide in the bushes to surprise his bud.  Why go home to change into hunting camo when he could just wear his ACU.
Rafaeliki,fdjynml,t1_fdju8u3,I've seen many times when the military sponsors someone to surprise their family at an NBA or NFL or MLB game and they are wearing full attire.
snklFrtz10,fdk0bei,t1_fdjynml,"Yup. That's definitely a thing. But that doesn't have anything to do with a dude showing up in uniform to surprise a buddy at his wedding for a cell phone video. Department of Defense still discourages travel in uniform. Sometimes it is required though (escorting a fallen comrade, for example)."

imjustherefortea,fdrwur6,t1_fdrviuj,"Have... have you seen childbirth? The baby literally uses their skull first to spiral down the pelvis, out of the cervix, then the birth canal and then the magic trick of popping out from a pretty limited space!

All while the mom is actively pushing their being out. Their skulls are durable, and not gaping open, but more like shards of skull protecting it, which fuse together to form one hard skull after 1-2 years. The baby is fine, although I understand your initial worry.

Sometimes during birth they get this huge contraption out named forceps, which is like a salad tong only baby sized, or even a suction cup they put directly on the baby’s head, and then they lean back and yank the baby out. Babies are durable."
novi-lunium,fds106m,t1_fdrwur6,Omg I've never heard of the suction cup! That is a funny thought.
YaMommasBabyDaddy,fds3afh,t1_fds106m,"Yeah, there's been a bit of departure from the suction method in the past year. I'm not personally sure what it was but we're good friends with the OB that delivered our daughter and she said there had been a few negative publishings about it around the time we were pregnant. 

Our daughter was pulled out with forceps and they do look like tongs made from tiny golf clubs."

Logar,fe7s3jz,t3_eo24uq,What causes someone to regularly get panic attacks to the degree that one would need a dog for assistance like that? Is it some kind of psychological affliction?
Katph1830,fe7xjo8,t1_fe7s3jz,"Anything can trigger a person with severe panic attacks. A sound, a type of person, so many things. I’ve seen someone have one severely and it’s brutal to watch the horror they internally go through."
delicate-butterfly,fe87pov,t1_fe7s3jz,Sometimes my brain will think of something completely random and then I’ll spiral thinking about that thought until I work myself into an anxiety attack. I have generalized anxiety and borderline personality disorder to give you a little more info.
volcom2096,fea4koj,t1_fe7s3jz,"Regular panic attacks can be caused by an anxiety disorder and/or PTSD. 
I have both, but have PTSD from 2 separate rapes (13 years apart) that I was the victim of. Like others below said, most things are caused by triggers, at least for those with PTSD. Sometimes I have no indication of what the trigger was, and other times I immediately know what caused it. 

Recent example to give you a run through of my anxiety attack:
Yesterday I was finishing my hair and put in a new hair pomade I had bought. I instantly had this dread come over me like I was going to die. I realized the trigger was the pomade. It smelled just like my second rapist’s hair, that I got a good whiff of when he raped me. 
Even though I knew it was just a smell, the amygdala part of my brain processes the familiar smell as extreme danger and was drowning out my logical thought processes. I was trying my best to talk through it logically, but my brain had already won. I was breathing very heavily, to the point of hyperventilating, and my heart rate had jumped to 140, (I got a alert on my watch). I had tears streaming down my face, and was seeing dots as I was near passing out from the hyperventilation. I couldn’t think it through how it was just pomade and that I was fine, and safe, and that “he” wasn’t here. My physical symptoms were so overpowering and frightening that I couldn’t get there. I haven’t had a trigger that bad in a while, and I wasn’t quite prepared for it. I ended up pacing around my room, bawling uncontrollably, and then slumped to the floor with my head on my knees. 

About 25-30 minutes in, I managed my breathing  pattern enough to realize I needed to break the cycle. I pulled up YouTube and put on a guided mediation video for anxiety attacks, and then put on my neurostimulation headband and laid in bed. It took about an hour, and my pillow was soaked from tears, but I got through it. A few hours later I went to a Hot Yoga class and sweat out the remaining anxiety and tension. Today I’m completely exhausted physically and mentally.

I wish I could afford to get a therapy dog."
annabananner,fe7wpse,t1_fe7s3jz,Could be PTSD?
muted-peach,fe993jb,t1_fe7s3jz,Could be panic disorder
Logar,fe8bbdm,t1_fe87pov,"Thank you for sharing that. I can imagine that must be challenging. I hope you find effective ways of catching that spiral early and stopping it in its tracks because unless you truly have things going on in your life worth panicking about, I can imagine it being frustrating and self-defeating."
Logar,fea94p9,t1_fea4koj,"Thanks for the detailed explanation and for writing all that out. I realize now that it makes sense that many sufferers of panic attacks actually also suffer from PTSD, rather than just having ""bad thinking habits"", and this understanding increased my respect for those who suffer from it.

Now I'm no expert on this, but I can only recommend one thing to you and that is to check out an accupressure therapy called EFT. No promises, but if this can help even a little bit it will have been worth it. Check out this video for an idea and please let me know what you think:

https://youtu.be/lumv7tJRCPw"
helloyousexythink,fe849mt,t1_fe7wpse,Most likely. Panic attacks can happen anywhere. Like for example. Someone i used to know was horribly sexually abused as a child and she has a panic attack when she sees a man wearing certain coloured jeans. She has to leave.
HirizaKyo,fe958pw,t1_fe8bbdm,"The spiral might also be intrusive. Something you didn't wanna think about, can't stop yourself from thinking about, and completely ruins the mood. Over all, my panic disorder is the most annoying and life destroying thing in my life. Hopefully there will be something in the future to be able to help all of us."
Logar,fe9rqku,t1_fe958pw,"I hope the same, friend. The frustrating part is that it does not appear, based on the replies I'm reading here, that panic attacks have anything to do with any physical affliction of the brain, but rather are the result of (excuse the simplification) a *habit*, if you will, of negative thinking, possibly triggered by some sensory stimulus. It appears so *curable*, but I'm sure that it appears much more outside of one's power from the point of view of someone actually suffering from these panic attacks."
HirizaKyo,fe9sr6y,t1_fe9rqku,"Kinda depends! I've been to therapists and doctors and the only thing I've been told is that I don't seem to have an outside stimulus causing panic attacks and they mostly happen at random. Obviously sometimes it's negative thinking, but then sometimes I'm just doing nothing and all of a sudden my heart races, I start feeling like I'm blacking out, and I struggle to get to the phone to call my significant other to help calm me down. Idk maaaaaan. Our bodies are weird. All I can do is just lay down flat on my back spread eagle and talk to the one I love and the super inconvenient panic attack will stop eventually :)"

MrBeanieManDude,fe7qkz7,t3_eo24uq,How though?
be-c-c4,fe8l7rb,t1_fe7qkz7,"Lots of anxiety response dogs are trained using body language ques and breathing sounds, some are trained to detect the smell of a high heart rate but unless the handler has a different condition where their heart rate needs monitoring or the dog naturally pick up on it it's less likely to be trained because it's more difficult and unnecessary to actually train. Basically how they train it is they shape the alert (what they want the dog to do when they see the que) then they pair the command for the alert with the que. The behaviour shown by this dog is even simpler to train because if you notice the dog is putting his snoot in her hands when they started training this they would have had a treat in the hand, done the behaviour (holding hands to face) with a treat in their hand the dog would then attempt to find the treat and be rewarded, eventually you can remove the treat and the dog will continue the behaviour and the reward will be pats (tactile stimulation for the owner), then the dog craves pats as a reward so basically hands up in face means snoot in hands and then after hands come down forced pets after doing this repeatedly along with other commands having been trained such as leave it and stop you have a fully formed alert and response."
mike117,fe7soic,t1_fe7qkz7,"Dogs can probably hear your breathing and maybe even your heartbeat, when trained properly they can detect things no person ever could."

1istheloniestnumber,fe3ck2e,t3_enoufk,It takes a hell of woman to accept such a large change in her marriage.
kingsOTHERjester,fe3mk85,t1_fe3ck2e,"Depends, I guess.  The obstacle is accepting the change in *sex life* and closet space.

The the funny shit they say and their opinions on cats and what color they want the livingroom to be is all the same.  

So if you define marriage as person+plumbing, yes.  But if you define marriage as person you hang out with forever...less so.

That being said, yeah, monogamy might be a pickle since we can’t CHOOSE to be gay or straight."
Flakester,fe6ligx,t1_fe3ck2e,It sure does. But it also doesn't take away from women who couldn't do it.
Persephoneve,fe5g6nc,t1_fe3mk85,"I mean I'm as bi as they come, but if my boyfriend went through a transition that would still put strain on our relationship because I would have to get to know the person that she was repressing. That doesn't mean it's a deal breaker, but I think it's unfair to say that ""plumbing"" is the only reason that then relationship may not work."
biffertyboffertyboo,fe5rccp,t1_fe3mk85,"I have heard several stories of people whose spouses game out as trans, and their personality changed radically, because they had built a false personality that aligned to the gender they had been assigned at birth. It doesn't necessarily happen every time, but even if you're coming from a personality focused point of view that doesn't mean it might not lead to serious issues."
11never,fe5uacf,t1_fe3mk85,"I agree with all of this, except the last bit if you are demisexual.
If my spouse told me they were a different gender it would change nothing because I only want to have sex with them because they are *them*. It's not like I'm not attracted to their body, but I'm attracted to their body because it is theirs. Does that make sense?

Different strokes, ya know?"
GfxJG,fe5a82e,t1_fe3mk85,"Regarding your last point, bisexuality exists, and is more common than homosexuality. So could be the wife just doesn't care about genitalia."
Zranka,fe6fsle,t1_fe3mk85,"I hope people don’t define marriage in either of those ways. You marry a person for their whole being, not one or two specific aspects of it. If a person goes through a change that drastic then they basically need to re-establish their relationship with the people around them."
WatchingMonsters,fe619ml,t1_fe5g6nc,"Yeah, I am bi too, but if my husband transitioned, I would not be attracted to him as a woman at all. People like to minimize sex as being “genitals” or marriage being something beyond sex, but for many, many people , those things aren’t true."
kingsOTHERjester,fe5y4cc,t1_fe5g6nc,"
I guess I figure if they were repressing parts of themselves *that have nothing to do with plumbing*, and that changes their opinions on cats and living room paint, then the person you fell in love with never existed.  That’s not on you.

Cat stuff? Now we’re talking dealbreaker."

comet4taily,fe831y6,t1_fe5rccp,"I think it's more that with such a big change in your life, you grow as well, and change and therefore you do become a different person. You get to express in ways you didn't before and that changes you as well. I don't think it's fair to say that it's a false personality."
kingsOTHERjester,fe6g0fl,t1_fe5uacf,"Perfect sense.  

(Well...to me, it does.)"
ChronicallyOwlish,fe6kbsn,t1_fe5uacf,"Except this isn’t always true, either. I am demi and sex is an on and off again thing as my wife transitions. There is an aspect of getting to know her in her new body, of her body changing, of the mechanics of sex changing, of parts of her personality that were previously suppressed coming to the surface. Our love didn’t change, but sex did. Until it happens you can’t say 100% that absolutely nothing would change and your attraction wouldn’t go through hiccups. I thought the same thing, but it turns out there is a lot involved in being attracted to your best friend. Things are just as complicated for demis as they are for everyone else."

a.  He is a weightlifter not a powerlifter.  Olympic weightlifting focuses on two disciplines: the snatch and the clean and jerk.  Powerlifting focuses on three: the bench press, the deadlift, and the squat.  There is no Olympic category/competition for powerlifting.

b.  The lift at 258kg was a clean and jerk, not a snatch.  A clean and jerk brings the bar to the shoulders, and then overhead, whereas a snatch brings it overhead in one continuous motion.  The current world record for both lifts is held by Georgian lifter Lasha Talakhadze with 220kg for the snatch and 264kg for the clean and jerk."

SconesForHours,fdnpslm,t1_fdmezf3,She’s a pit mix. They always say they’re something else because people don’t want pit bulls.

davecg,fdynf6v,t1_fdwkj6j,Yea I've always thought using kids to pressure sell your product is kind of shitty.
violetbaudeliar,fdx6fc8,t1_fdwtre9,"Yeah cookie season was always when it was freezing. I remember standing outside of Golden Corral and making a kiiilling, I mean we almost sold half (which is alot). The best part about it was going inside to ask for rolls (which were complimentary) and getting warm. I hope the girls got to keep the money, I know how much selling just a few boxes helped so I can only imagine how much it helped that group getting every box gone."
TheAtomak,fdxjmau,t1_fdwtre9,"Why though, why are you spending so much time building funds for their business?"
LadyStarbuck1,fdxjt75,t1_fdxjmau,"Because it teaches girls math, business skills, money sense, and public speaking. The girls are proud of themselves. It’s an important thing for them. It’s not about the money. It’s about the pride they have in themselves when we’re done."
f33f33nkou,fdzsuql,t1_fdxjt75,Except its 99% about the money. Girl scouts doesnt give a shit about team building money management skills. Maybe at one point they did but I thinks it's pretty damn naive to think otherwise now. Girl scout cookies are to make a profit for girl scout company
pineapple-panda,fe0amk5,t1_fdxjt75,This sounds like it was written by an EA pr representative. Might as well say it gives them a sense of pride and accomplishment to sell cookies in the freezing cold for a troop to profit.
LadyStarbuck1,fdzt0h1,t1_fdzsuql,"I mean, it’s not though. Are you active in the Scouting community? You can 100% opt in or out of the sales. We didn’t do sales last year, and this year we’re doing minimal. 

I think it’s naive to think that you can’t have one thing without the other. Yes. We make money for the corporation. But the troop gets loads and the girls have a freaking blast. And that’s what matters."

Olealicat,fdtmcd3,t3_en280n,"I love the Greater Cincinnati Area. If you even feel charitable visit your local children’s hospital and/or volunteer your time and/or money to the places and charities that support the families of those children. 

The Ronald McDonald House in Cincinnati is absolutely amazing! They give families of sick children a place to stay and help with medical care. 

Here’s a link to volunteer... https://www.rmhcincinnati.org/volunteer/

Here’s a link to donate... https://www.rmhcincinnati.org/donate/donate-online/

I also wanted to mention The Dragonfly Foundation, who helps support families of sick children.
