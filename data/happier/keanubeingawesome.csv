whalepopcorn,fdp8gsr,t1_fdopf3x,At least he didn’t have it all over his face like Costanza.
Active_Monk,fdp8nk9,t1_fdopf3x,Who are the Alamedian's fighting?
Lavaheart626,fdpm1m9,t1_fdopf3x,I'll be honest as a introvert with a bit of social anxiety. It'd be kinda funny to have headlines like this. It's really harmless imo. It's not like they're taking something he said out of context and spinning it as something bad or some other bullshit some news sites do sometimes to famous folk.
redspade117,fdp0ai9,t1_fdowmp6,"they probably just bought the footage

edit: nope, they just picked it up from twitter. even more innocuous"
Kurtsey,fdp0mfd,t1_fdowmp6,They didn't dedicate much since you can see the twitter handle they took the video from at the top of the pic.
80BAIT08,fdpg57t,t1_fdp1sjp,People get off on him being alone. Part of the romanticisation

YeahBuddyDude,fdpk6fx,t1_fdp1sjp,"Seriously. The guy even said all the attention makes him uncomfortable and this sub is just like ""OMG HES SO HUMBLE HE'S AMAZING.""

The dude seems awesome, but if you really like him, support his films and lets stop being so weird about it against his wishes."
Civ_Noob,fdpogem,t1_fdp1sjp,Reddit chastises other people for following celebs and then do a 180 and circlejerk over keanu reeves. Its also really creepy and weird how people are using this post to validate their introvert “alone time” bullshit
NML02,fdpfr6m,t1_fdp0ai9,he took a picture with her too..he doesn’t care lol
beagle-juice,fdqcrl9,t1_fdp0ai9,Imagine some dude goes down with a camera crew to watch Keanu sit there eating ice cream taking guesses at what he's thinking about and what flavour he got... I'd watch that

DayZeros,fdpasvv,t1_fdooh2k,This! I love being a lone to enjoy myself. But I am not lonely. Introverts unite!

I’m in a pretty good spot socially after a couple years of knowing no one in my then-new city so that factors into it as well. 

Doesn’t help that 2 of my best friends and I work in the same group so we travel for work together. It has led to some awesome nights though.

I helped Christian Bale when his youngest son was just born. Right before he was filming vice I ran into them outside my favorite breakfast place, which happened to be his too. It was called Early World in Brentwood. We chit chat outside and then walk in at the same time. 

As we were all walking in, we walk right past Josh Duhamel... who I also actually helped when his baby was born. 

Josh didn’t remember me (which probably made the “I feel swag af” reaction on my face awkward) and they just didn’t even recognize each other. 

And then the host sat my group right in between them and I got play the avoid awkward eye contact game the whole time. 

Anyways that’s my story. They’re both awesome, awesome people. I’m just another introverted Redditor."

cheesesnax,fdp7qsz,t1_fdp6tlo,Ha- fellow cheese! Didn’t even notice your username!
Yurichi,fdp89cb,t1_fdp4zxg,"> Alameda
They've been closed for like months though. Health inspection problems."
Epileptic_Fishe,fdpbc7q,t1_fdp4zxg,"Unfortunately after Loards’ health code violation stuff, Tucker’s is quite literally the only option besides Baskin Robins lol"
danielgies,fdp92kl,t1_fdp6fpd,"Ohhh right, I forgot that popped up over there. I normally avoid Webster unless I'm desperate for a corndog."
Cheez-lt,fdp7wdx,t1_fdp7qsz,I don’t even like cheez-its that much. Goldfish are much better
Starslip,fdpdria,t1_fdp89cb,"Aw no, they've been open forever! Is it closed permanently?"
Cheez-lt,fdpajhj,t1_fdp92kl,"Lol I like my shifts, they usually aren’t too busy because there are a lot of ice cream spots in Alaneda"
Mevspcp,fdpnnvr,t1_fdpdria,No they will be open again soon. Saw some updates there recently
Starslip,fdpogxp,t1_fdpnnvr,"Oh, that's great, thank you. My grandma used to take me there sometimes when I was a kid, would have been a shame if it was gone."
GDFanarnia,fdoqbrk,t3_emgoc9,My biggest question is why is he in Alameda?? Like you have to go out of your way to go there.
GalvanEyes,fdorbln,t1_fdoqbrk,"I’m guessing this was during the filming of Matrix 2.  They filmed the highway scene there on an unused stretch of tarmac.  He wasn’t really even in the highway scene, but that’s still my best guess."
Acerbic-heart,fdore90,t1_fdoqbrk,Filming the new matrix movie.
CorpseProject,fdowi65,t1_fdoqbrk,I hope he went to Tucker’s that place is great.
Butthole_Alamo,fdplsak,t1_fdoqbrk,What’s weird is Fox 11 is not a Bay Area news station. We have Fox 2. I guess this was significant enough to broadcast outside of the Bay.
Entrical,fdotam3,t1_fdorbln,This is recent and from filming Matrix 4
gojirra,fdpe6k8,t1_fdore90,Most people don't know about the clone fields of Alameda.
DangKilla,fdpyhh9,t1_fdore90,"Really? I grew up on Alameda. That’s where the Matrix Highway was built. I went to see it since I was back in the area a few months after, but they had tore it down. It was on the old NAS Alameda base."
danielgies,fdp0htg,t1_fdowi65,"I was gonna' say, Tucker's is the only legit ice cream in Alameda."
L8night_snack,fdp3it5,t1_fdowi65,He went to Baskin Robbins lol
chooties-,fdp7k5m,t1_fdowi65,I believe he went to Baskin Robbins
GalvanEyes,fdotcv7,t1_fdotam3,"Oh, even better!"
koobear,fdp320d,t1_fdp0htg,Life is uncertain. Eat dessert first.
eyetracker,fdoxka9,t1_fdotcv7,"They closed the Webster or Posey tube for ""maintenance.""

Also Matrix 2 was a built set, I think, on the closed naval base."
danielgies,fdpc5x8,t1_fdpbdv7,I also just found out that Loard's was shut down a while ago.
CorpseProject,fdpnfat,t1_fdpbeuy,"Right, lame. Someone get that man to Tucker’s."
cheesesnax,fdp6lyj,t1_fdoxka9,You used to be able to see the freeway scene on the Google satellite image of the Naval Air Station. I couldn’t make it out today though as a lot of building has gone on in the past few years.

Not in matrix sense I guess where everyone has agency but, in more of a Truman Show scenario. I have never thought about how the physiological thrillers I deeply enjoy may leave traces for contemplation for the actors themselves. I mean if I considered how much pondering and thought was put into a philosophical concept as a result of my actions I don't know how I would react.

BurningArrows,fe6p9pt,t3_enps0r,I tried playing that game and absolutely hated the mechanics. But Keanu would certainly work for the role.
Edymos,fe6t2as,t3_enps0r,There's only one man who can play Adam Jensen and his name is Elias Toufexis.
84theone,fe82366,t1_fe6t2as,Yeah the dude looks and sounds exactly like Adam Jensen for some odd reason.
OushnikSG,fe719q0,t3_enps0r,U read my mind.. have thought of this since HR got released..
ScratchinWarlok,fe7ato7,t3_enps0r,Id watch this.
zombays,fe7dw3w,t3_enps0r,sure why not?
Slaisa,fe7eb2o,t3_enps0r,Keanu would make an amazing anything
xerxerxex,fe7gb4f,t3_enps0r,Kinda felt like Timothy Olyphant would be the ideal choice
Omen_Omega21,fe7stdk,t3_enps0r,He has a long ass neck damn
IJragon,fe3zkzh,t3_enps0r,"10-20 years ago maybe. He's too old, now."
CH_Blackgate,fe40zp2,t1_fe3zkzh,"10-20 years ago he was...hmm, lemme see here, probably 4,500 approximately.  I guess they may want someone on their double digit 30s for Adam... I'm sold though."
JohnnyNoArms,fe543fa,t1_fe3zkzh,I don't see why the age would matter.
Luciferisflash,fe5efo0,t1_fe3zkzh,He literally does john wick right now. Which he does majority of the stunts for. Gtfo.
84theone,fe82k7w,t1_fe543fa,Adam Jensen is 34 in human revolution and Keanu Reeves does not look like a man in his 30s anymore.
JohnnyNoArms,fe83a6m,t1_fe82k7w,Adam Jensen doesn't have to be 34.
84theone,fe851qg,t1_fe83a6m,"The characters age is tied to a specific and important in universe event that happened 34 years prior to the events of human revolution. Most of what happens in the first game happens specifically because of this one event. 

He has to be younger than the augment tech companies, given the experiments performed on him as a child."
JohnnyNoArms,fe88q94,t1_fe851qg,Surely that can be altered in a TV adaptation or movie.

jefferyt51,fdhvfcb,t1_fdhffum,"No, there’s other band members too.  But understandable mistake."

sammyaxelrod,fdnf738,t3_em5n52,Every time I see Keanu it amazes me how normal he is...think about people like kim Kardashian who would NEVER say something like this and millions of little girls worship her. It makes me sad
TheOriginalBoxcar,fdnujnk,t1_fdnf738,"We’ll just be the millions of people who worship Keanu for being a genuinely good person, and use him as a rolemodel for ourselves."
8-bit-brandon,fdobmpq,t1_fdnf738,"If you look at the disparity between how they grew up it’s pretty obvious why. They are trash, and he should be made a saint"
ninja_savage98,fdonsoi,t1_fdnf738,Yes because Kim Kardashian doesn’t donate to charity or hasn’t used her platform to free innocent people from death row. Nah she’s a piece of shit that curb stomps babies. Let’s all just murder her and the entire family hell yeah we’re such good people!
Yogashoga,fdo22dv,t1_fdnujnk,"Worship is a strong word. Should only be used if we’re building a temple for Keanu. 

Should I setup a gofundme for a Keanu themed temple, our true lord and savior?"
nahteviro,fdoew1f,t1_fdo22dv,I 100% support this Reeveligion

Hissing_Fetus,fdo8bjv,t3_em5n52,His hair looks fantastic
spookyparkin,fdo300x,t3_em5n52,"Guys I love him as well, but all he did here was answer a standard question in a standard way..."
Iggyol,fdo3fdw,t1_fdo300x,"He didn’t say any one person was better than any other, that was the awesome bit."
nahteviro,fdofbug,t1_fdo300x,"Which is why people like him. He’s standard and it makes us feel like he’s on our level, not some massive celebrity"
ShakurWallace,fdoem55,t1_fdo300x,Isnt that like 90% of this sub?
spookyparkin,fdo3wis,t1_fdo3fdw,"I mean fuck man most actors would have said ""they're all great"" if anything he dodges the question. 

He's done some awesome things but this is just silly"
Iggyol,fdo440w,t1_fdo3wis,Fine
Daddychellz,fdoa530,t3_em5n52,Lol usually reporters will keep jabbing for a more direct answer but they know the media/public will eat that up all the same because it’s keanu.  I love it
MonsterEars,fdonkj4,t3_em5n52,You can’t help but love that man
Travisx2112,fdo00lm,t3_em5n52,"Gah, that warmed my heart 😊"
