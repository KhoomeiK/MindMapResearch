3720-To-One,fdkrk22,t3_elvxdy,What keeps the discs in the back from spinning out of place when the dial is turned again?
MSgtGunny,fdktphr,t1_fdkrk22,"The discs aren‚Äôt directly connected at all. They each have a notch that the one in front can catch and start to turn. Which is why you usually alternate turning clockwise and counterclockwise. And if you over rotate one way or another, it moves the back discs out of place."
ThisHeresThaRubaduk,fdktt9p,t1_fdkrk22,[Heres a video explaining how a combination lock works.](https://youtu.be/sftkP4CjjZs)
drewmeister,fdkulqd,t1_fdkrk22,"It occurred to me that this must be why combination locks spin multiple times to set each disk and has a decreasing amount for subsequent numbers. For example, spin left 3 times, right 2 times, left 1 time is how my master padlock works. So, as I understand it, each full rotation in a direction engages an additional disk. Spin to engage disk 1, keep spinning for disk 2, and so on.

Perhaps this illustration is simpler than the actual mechanism, or perhaps this has something additional that isn't immediately obvious."
PM_Me_UR_Muffin,fdl8vi2,t1_fdkrk22,[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8z0f7kPQEw&feature=youtu.be&t=1m30s) may help explain it.

TheRealKidkudi,fdkwx14,t1_fdktphr,"The only real ""safe"" I've had experience opening, you had to turn the dial past zero twice before going to the 2nd number. How does that work with the disks? I've always been mildly curious, but I guess never curious enough to look it up."

WarrenG21,fdkynvo,t1_fdkwx14,It‚Äôs the same thing you need to get them so the last disk is in motion.  You can see how it works at the start of the video. Need to turn the dial enough so you engage the last disk.
pseudozombie,fdl5wy5,t1_fdkwx14,"I think the other replies missed your point that you turn passed zero twice for the SECOND number, which means it isn't for a reset.

My theory is that the first number was close to zero.  I have had combo pad locks where if one number is close to the next number, it requires an extra spin. I think this is due to how the notch is constructed.  Maybe to prevent the setting of two disks at once. 

Now.. how would it be constructed? Not totally sure, but my guess is that there is another disk in between the 1st and 2nd, with a smaller diameter, but has a notch on both sides. So, once you set the 1st disk, to get the second one to engage the other direction, the 1.5 disk needs to do a full revolution."
Crayola63,fdlgq50,t1_fdkwx14,"Going around a second time ‚Äúcollects‚Äù the third disk. If you go all the way around once, you‚Äôve got the first and second disks connected. Going around a second time means that the second wheel rotates fully and grabs the third wheel."

TJ03wannabe,fdkrspl,t3_elvxdy,Interesting! Does that mean when opening a safe (with the combination) you can start by turning either clockwise or anticlockwise as long as you alternate?
Boukish,fdkworc,t1_fdkrspl,"(CCW counterclockwise, CW clockwise)

Nope.

Think of it this way, on a clock face. If the combination is 12, 6, 3, 4 and you have to go CCW 12, CW 6, CCW 3, CW 4 - what happens? You go all the way left to 12, then right to 6, then left to 3, then right to 4 - you didn't pass 12 on the way from 6 to 3, and you didn't pass 6 on the way to 4. 

What happens when you go the other way? You start at going clockwise to 12, going CCW around to 6 - we're okay so far. Then you have to go clockwise again to 3, *which passes 12 again and moves that*, then on the CCW way from 3 to 4 you again pass 6, which moves that, so now 3 and 4 are correct but 12 and 6 have been moved 3 and 2 spaces respectively and are no longer correct."

Source. Bank branch manager."
Redtwooo,fdlg1ea,t1_fdld53g,"The real security for bank vaults tends to be that they're built into the structure of the building, and under constant surveillance, with highly restricted access. 

Nobody (as far as I've ever heard) actually breaks into vaults the way heist movies make it seem, because you're going to get caught. You can't just walk in and start cracking without the bank employees stopping you. If you start with a bank robbery you have silent alarms and video surveillance to deal with, to say nothing of the customers and employees who all likely have phones capable of live streaming the whole thing. 

Do banks even have like stacks or bundles of cash sitting around in the vault? I would think it'd actually be in locked containers, so it's not tempting the employees to just grab a stack of twenties and pretend it was never there. 

All in all I would think it'd be more trouble than it's worth to get into a vault, because you're definitely going to get caught either at the scene or shortly thereafter, and unless you're robbing a super high end bank most physical stores don't even store all that much money anyway, just enough for the day to day transactions I would think. The big banks would keep any big cash reserves at the federal reserve banks, smaller banks I'd still think most of their money is also stored offsite."

It's different here on Earth because of our equatorial bulge. The most important variables here are distance from the center of gravity and your density. The poles on Earth are closer to the center. Also, the average density of Earth is obv much less than any star, and so the effect of conservation of momentum (centri-fuck whatever word you want to use, fugal or petal, momentum in an arc wanting to go straight is what you're describing) does has a small effect on reducing the gravtiational force the equator feels. 

On a star, or black hole, the density is so far past the threshold that conservation of momentum wanting stuff to go straight is neglible, and the dense stuff is so much more uniform on average overall that the shape is forced by this extra gravity into a much more evenly spherical shape. With that equal distance from the center, and the speed and density being so great, time dilation measurably increases the existence of stuff near the equator of the star that it's gravitational pull during each *relative unit of time* is greater than at it's poles. 

This is why stuff escapes at the poles, and the accretion disc of a black hole surrounds the equator and matches spin direction, and why solar systems behave the same way, generally.

Romenhurst,fe4j5k0,t1_fe4g5aq,"> Which is why Hawking radiation escapes from the poles of a black hole, if I'm remembering right.

[Hawking Radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_radiation) can occur anywhere at the event horizon, not just the poles. The ""radiation"" from an accretion disk you're referring to is called an [Astrophysical Jet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysical_jet) and can occur around neutron stars too.

Also, we may not have a thorough understanding of *why* these jets happen yet.  
*From the wikipedia article:*

> The formation and powering of astrophysical jets are highly complex phenomena that are associated with many types of high-energy astronomical sources. They likely arise from dynamic interactions within accretion disks, whose active processes are commonly connected with compact central objects such as black holes, neutron stars or pulsars. One explanation is that tangled magnetic fields are organised to aim two diametrically opposing beams away from the central source by angles only several degrees wide (c. > 1%). Jets may also be influenced by a general relativity effect known as frame-dragging."

audiophilistine,fe5f384,t1_fe52a1p,"What makes it spin? Well nothing in the universe is truly still. Spin is just something that happens. 

How does it spin so fast? It used to be a massive star many times the size of our sun that probably spun relatively slowly. When that star ran out of fuel and blew up, the star's core remained behind and the spin increased by the conservation of angular momentum. 

If you spin around in a desk chair or bar stool with your arms out, you will spin slowly. When you pull your arms in you will spin much faster. Your mass hasn't changed, but the same energy that spun you slowly with your arms spread spins much faster when you take up less space. 

Finally, space is frictionless, so it will just keep spinning. An object in motion tends to stay in motion."
anotherjakeenglish,fe5efc7,t1_fe52a1p,"They spin due to angular momentum, IIRC, the same way every celestial object does (see planets, other stars, space rocks, nebulae, etc.). However, since their mass has been compressed massively from their original size, they spin much faster; at their equator, instead of spinning along a circumference a few million kilometres long perhaps bimonthly, they spin along a circumference 60km long at most, and, to conserve the momentum, they therefore spin much faster - hundreds of times a second."

The sun resists collapse because of pressure generated by fusion.

For stars below 10 solar masses, this remnant will be below ~1.4 solar masses become a white dwarf. 

For stars above 10 solar masses (and below 29), this lack of fusion will result in a collapse that produces a supernova and leaves behind a neutron star remnant. 

Neutron stars can range from 1-2 solar masses. Much larger than that and they will overcome neutron degeneracy pressure and collapse further into a black hole."

WikiTextBot,fe7rgns,t1_fe7rfog,"**Atomic orbital**

In atomic theory and quantum mechanics, an atomic orbital is a mathematical function that describes the wave-like behavior of either one electron or a pair of electrons in an atom. This function can be used to calculate the probability of finding any electron of an atom in any specific region around the atom's nucleus. The term atomic orbital may also refer to the physical region or space where the electron can be calculated to be present, as defined by the particular mathematical form of the orbital.Each orbital in an atom is characterized by a unique set of values of the three quantum numbers n, ‚Ñì, and m, which respectively correspond to the electron's energy, angular momentum, and an angular momentum vector component (the magnetic quantum number). Each such orbital can be occupied by a maximum of two electrons, each with its own spin quantum number s.

This absolutely massive ball, size wise, is smaller than you‚Äôd run in a marathon, or likely, commute to work.

This ball, almost 2 times more massive then our sun, is spinning 70,000 times faster then a standard 5.56 round.

Some napkin math puts these dead stars at 1.05x10^38 joules. A standard nuclear bomb is 4.8x10^15 joules. It is 25000000000000000000000 times more powerful then a nuclear bomb. 21 zeroes.

Batbuckleyourpants,fe6j30n,t1_fe6ek5c,"I know. I'm fine with Whatever lets me spread awesome nuggets of cool facts. Hope you both found it interesting. Have an upvote even.

Edit: Fuck it, silver."
Batbuckleyourpants,fe6iryg,t1_fe6g1b5,"Good question. Take our star, Think of it as a massive explosion that has been going on for the last 6 billion years, it burns hydrogen, and turn it into mainly Iron through a  nuclear fusion.

The sun is so massive, that going by modern science, is has enough hydrogen to keep that going at least another 6 billion years before running out of fuel (hydrogen). Ironically, it is going to burn brighter and brigher.

When the sun ""stop exploding"", the matter that was being pushed out by the explosion in the core, will implode. At that point, it will ironically expand, to the point where the sun will engulf a quarter of the inner solar system, before collapsing into a dwarf star. Our star is tiny enough that it does a tiny bang, eat the earth and Venus, then settle down into a tiny dwarf star, that spend the next million billion years at the very least, cooling down into a black dwarf, a star that would have to be so old, no such star yet exist in the universe.

Now, take a star 10-30 times the size of out star. when these stars run out of ""fuel"" or hydrogen to keep pushing matter away from the core, these fuckers go off in a BIG way. First, the most destructive events in existence happen, a supernova release a blast of energy strong enough to strip the star of any matter that is not locked into the core by gravity. It will send trillions of tons of matter into space, until all we have left is an EXTREMELY dense core, so dense it has several times the mass of our sun, squesed into the size of a couple of city blocks... This is a neutron star, and they are fucking terrifying to the point where the human mind is only able to understand it by comparing it so multiples of tiny tiny things, like ""A thousand trillion Hiroshima per second"".

What is more, The remains of the star is now a cloud surrounding the collapsed star, the matter starts ""dropping"" into what is now a neutron star, every atom that strike the surface of the neutron star, speed it up a tiny tiny bit more, adding energy to what is basically already an energy bomb, until it is a monster weighing **at least** 2 times as much as the sun, spinning around at a quarter of the speed of light. We don't have the technology to even come close to replicating that.

So, You now have a ball of matter, so dense physicists start to throw their hand up in confusion, it spin around so fast we cant even replicate it using modern science, and the fucker sometime randomly goes **BOOM** in a big way\*\*,\*\* for reasons we don't yet fully understand, and the energy released turn any potential life that dares to be a thing within light-years of it, into a the consistency of a burnt pizza.

The only reason humans are even a thing, is because for the last billion years, these terrifying things have been a LONG way away from us at the moment."

layers_of_grey,fe22q4g,t3_enmtl3,this is cool but i think you could improve it by adding some kind of marker to one of the latitude lines so the viewer can keep track of one rotation.

3. It might also help to start with a couple of seconds at full speed"
Allesmoeglichee,fe2wefw,t3_enmtl3,"Next up in the book of ""things humans cant relate to"": Comparing the rotational speed od the sun and a blackhole."
Dy1ooon,fe2bjk2,t3_enmtl3,What makes it spin so fast? Is it the extreme density?
mangledeye,fe38k28,t1_fe2bjk2,"Conservation of angular momentum. 
You know when ice skaters spin sometimes they pull their arms together and that makes them spin faster?
Same thing with everything else. Now imagine a cloud of gas that maybe rotates once in a million years, but it is slowly coalescing into a blob, and eventually that collapses into a star conserving the same spin, except the blob is much smaller and thus it's spin becomes faster as the star forms, ""bringing it's arms(stuff) together"".
Now that we have a super massive star formed it's spinning much faster, since all that area has become smaller, conserving the momentum.
Super massive stars , as they die and explode sometimes can avoid the collapse into black hole if all things are right in their situation. Instead when they form heavy elements in their core they collapse into a neutron star.
Did you know that atoms consist of 99.9% of empty space? We don't fall through ""solid"" objects because of electro magnetism.
When an object has enough mass the gravity (weakest force) finally has enough power to collapse that empty space, and all the matter left within the star after supernovae, collapses (not enough fuel to keep it lit anymore) into a relatively solid neutron. That is what a neutron star is. 
And most of that angular momentum (spin) remains, except now this star has shrunk from the size of Mars' orbit to the size of Manhattan.
Hope this makes sense to you."

More detailed explanation: As you may know a particle can only be in certain definitive states, called quantum states. In a neutron star the neutrons are so densely packed and so energetic that every quantum state is already completely filled up to really high energies. The proton coming out of the decay can only have a maximum amount of energy which is way lower than the energies these neutrons already have, so there is no available state for the proton."

Riko_e,fe6xn8s,t1_fe5onit,"Conservation of angular momentum. Think of it like a figure skater or ballerina spinning.  When they want to spin faster, they pull their legs inward.  A star is similar.  When you have a spinning mass get smaller while retaining that mass, it spins faster. The formation of neutron stars during supernova compresses a lot of mass into a small radius.  This pulsar is estimated to be two times the mass of our sun with a radius of 16km, so all of that mass is tucked into a 16km ball, it's going to spin very fast."

a-physicist,fe75xgg,t1_fe61x5q,Yes but it's pretty dangerous around there. Many neutron stars emit very high energy gamma rays or X-rays and all neutron stars emit high amounts of UV radiation. It would look pretty cool otherwise because neutron stars are so hot that they have a blue colour

Ronfarber,fe3d7v2,t1_fe34zae,"No, the neutron star is much smaller than the earth."
BluePinkGrey,fe6w692,t1_fe34zae,"Neutron stars are heavy bois. Basically, once a star‚Äôs core is converted to iron it can no longer fuse. This causes the core to cool. As it cools, it becomes denser. This increases the force of gravity, which accelerated the process, causing the core to collapse in on itself violently. This squishes the core so much that the spaces between the atoms are removed, and nuclei get pressed up against each other. This makes the neutron star billions of times denser than regular matter. The end result is the entire mass of the sun (sometimes as high as 1.5 times the mass of the sun) squished into a ball just 16km across or so.

Even though they‚Äôre small, they‚Äôre so hot and bright that we can still see them."

a=(v^2)/r (formula to calculate centrifugal force. V is speed, r is radius)

v= ehh fuck it


The result I got was:

323 821 427 747 759.1 m/s^2

I don't understand this... how can a magnetic field be more dense than lead when it has no mass? I thought it was a reaction to mass movement?"
Innomen,fea2kk6,t1_fe6wqgp,"Correct me if I'm wrong but I think they mean that lead, being matter, can be mathematically thought of as a given amount of energy (e=mc\^2), and that the energy density of the magnetar's field exceeds that energy value.

Like, if you converted lead directly into energy in the form of magnetism you'd still only have a field 1/10,000th as strong as a magnetar. To reach the right value you'd need something 10,000x more dense than lead?

All I can say is that the intensity of the thing blows my mind.

Here's another quote from the same link:

It‚Äôs reassuring that I‚Äôm hearing more and more that we‚Äôll always need humans because business without human is so vulnerable (hackers, thief, electricity cost, major bugs, something breaking, etc.)."

Churning out 2-3m base level toilets can be done with a lot of automation that takes into account things glaze thickness on asymmetrical or uneven surfaces, but if you're only making 10k designer toilets of a few varieties, its more cost effective to have a human on the controls to do eyes-on QC than try to implement automation on that line."

Irrelevant details: we ended up not getting china at all as we would end up with her grandmother‚Äôs anyway, and who uses it?

Clay particles are small and flat, but each side of the particle has an opposing charge, so the negative side of one particle is attracted to the positive changes of another particle.  Water activated the charge, and acts as a lubricant for the particles.

The Kohler town history is fascinating as well, and there is a Kohler plant museum where you can see all of the old and new models Kohler has including work from artists, retired colors, and showrooms of insane new products.

In the event the author visited, heads were placed in chicken roasting pans (cuz that's about the right size for a head) and injected with a saline solution to ""plump them up.""

The author commented that she assumed the cut would be a clean one with something like a band saw, but it was jagged and rough and looked like a serial killer with a hack saw had done it. 

Surgeons were mostly very respectful, and were prescribing face lift procedures when the author visited.

What needs to be said is *it doesn't matter if you're beautiful or not.* Beauty doesn't really mean anything, but it exists.

I also just sorta never thought about plastic surgery, and I thought that it was neat to learn how it's practiced"
TimeWizard333,fe3ca21,t1_fe3asc9,"There is a movement towards using augmented reality and full projections of virtual bodies to teach anatomy.

MikeLinPA,fe2li4z,t1_fe1y199,Except many people end up looking bizarre. Too many examples to name.
CollegeSuperSenior,fe206mi,t1_fe1y199,Well said. Aging is basically the process of dying so it is only natural that people would want to fight if they can afford to do so.

ddrcecbvdhdfdrdbdfrd,fe2dbpw,t1_fe1zgpw,"There is always a fucking weird and over tight look to them though. Nobody really looks 40 when they are 50 because of plastic surgery. It ain't photoshop and the benefits don't last, while the negative aspects don't age well. So you have a really rapid drift and the knee jerk reaction is to fix that with more surgery."
kabneenan,fe2kcqj,t1_fe2d1yp,"This resonates with me and I think more people need to understand this. As a woman over 30 who has never been beautiful, people who try to tell me otherwise just come across as disingenuous. I'm not attractive, I know that and I've made peace with that. I have a lot of other positive qualities that I nurture and celebrate. 

So when people try to complement my looks while ignoring literally everything else about me it's more irritating than if you'd said nothing at all. Women - and everyone else - are worth more than just their looks.

And before people try to argue I just can't take a compliment, there's a difference between ""your makeup looks pretty today"" and a hesitant ""you're pretty in your own way."" The former I will take graciously, but the latter is fooling no one."

Hraunar,fe4fq5y,t1_fe38geo,You can't even tell when it's done right. And a lot of people aren't going to tell you either.
HarveyCMoreau,fe2fsoo,t1_fe2dbpw,"I mean, I have at least 2 coworkers, one 44 and one 25 who have work done. They just look oddly ‚Äúperfect‚Äù I guess but you couldn‚Äôt tell it‚Äôs specifically plastic surgery"
DG729,fe2qgeh,t1_fe2dbpw,You only think that because you only notice the bad ones
Devil_Demize,fe2g1ue,t1_fe2dbpw,Well a lot of them before surgery got to this point would use tape or botox everywhere which made their saggy skin just look tighter but still saggy at the same time which prompted the unnatural look
Beanicus13,fe3engp,t1_fe2dbpw,Nah. That‚Äôs just the bad ones.

kabneenan,fe32mwu,t1_fe2s2xh,"Sure, hence the latter part of my comment. There's a difference, though, between looking groomed and fit and being beautiful.

It helped her market and end up with a wildly successful makeup company, and probably will make her hundreds of millions of dollars...

Not a bad deal for a little plastic surgery."
RdmGuy64824,fe37hyt,t1_fe2rsvl,She went from one of the ugly ones to one of the not so ugly ones. And now she‚Äôs the richest one with a makeup empire. Not a terrible move.

whyisthis_soHard,fe2g1lx,t1_fe263yx,"Just to clear it up for your weight comment, personally- I‚Äôm 52 kilos, there was no weight change my entire life. My friend who is the same age, lost 80kilos, no turkey neck. Which brings back to the original claim, it‚Äôs just not that simple to do this and do that, it‚Äôs variable and to each their own. And with that, everybody wants to feel pretty or handsome and sometimes a little pull and tuck changes their life."
arcelohim,fe3nift,t1_fe32mwu,"There is a societal constructed image of beauty. It is changing like fashion. Yet there also is this underlying beauty that we can all possess. It is in our eyes and how we conduct ourselves.  I have seen gorgeous people that are ugly. 

But more importantly, Nevia cream everyday. the one from the can. 

And also trying to be happy and creating a positive environment. 

I still believe that we all have the capability of being beautiful. At least to someone."

blankblank,fe39lc9,t1_fe37hyt,"Personally, I think that is part of why the Kardashian Jenner clan is so successful in cosmetics. 

They aren‚Äôt that naturally beautiful, but through surgery, laser hair removal, fashion, makeup, and photoshop they have radically altered their appearance. 

Other, also not that genetically gifted people, probably see them as aspirational figures. They think, with just a little filler here and there and some lipstick they too can remake themselves."
IndecisiveAxiom,fe5quai,t1_fe5itdl,"Just clarifying for people who might not know, since your statement lacks that pertinent information."
kabneenan,fe4538m,t1_fe3nift,"You're getting a bit philosophical on me. I'm not trying to argue that physical beauty is all there is - in fact, I argue precisely the opposite in my initial comment. I am more than my skin, same as anyone else. I am attractive enough as a whole person (meaning more than just my appearance) that I haven't repulsed my husband after 16 years, haha.

There is, however, objective beauty and you're right! Exactly what features are described as objectively beautiful change over time. I'm quite sure my most prominent features have never been en vogue. And that's okay with me! It only bothers me that other people don't accept that and behave in a manner that feels patronizing and ingenuous."
ChancedLuck,fe3eyio,t1_fe3clu9,"I wouldn't call what they have a better life. It's how they use it that makes it better or worse. Kings had kingdoms and money, the Jenners just have money. They also aren't trying to give anyone a better life, maybe if you liked to ""look"" and ""feel"" pretty you go buy their products but... Yeah"

A-Bone,fe8hk11,t1_fe7u9av,"*'Industry is my name, hydrogenation is my game'*

-American food industry, post WWII  

The rise of hydrogenation really helped transform industrial food production.  

[Hydrogenation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogenation) was an important technological advancement because, among other things:

- It allowed vegetable oils to replace animal fats in many products (setting aside the animal deaths themselves, vegetable oils are vastly cheaper and easier to works with in massive quantities)   
- It imparted the characteristic of allowing the vegetable-based fats to have much higher melting points (they do not melt at room temperature, which is why you never have to stir up Skippy peanut butter and Crisco can be left unrefrigerated for instance), making them more stable at room temperatures, eliminating the need for refrigeration and extending shelf lives. 
- It reduced the likelihood of products going [rancid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rancidification), a process of oxidation or hydrolysis that gives foods bad tastes and odors and can be dangerous. 

HOWEVER.... This came at the cost of creating* a class of molecules that are damaging to health.. wow... shocking right?  The solution is worse than the problem....  

This is why we've been hearing about the controversy around 'trans-fats' for years...  These are the molecules created during hydrogenation that the human body has a hard time dealing with..  

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_fat
 

*these types of fats do occur naturally in small quantities, but not anywhere near the rates that they do in processed foods that have been chemically hydrogenated."

A-Bone,fea085a,t1_fe8kfin,"No problem.

I encourage everyone reading this to learn a bit about the different types of ingredients in their diets and make food choices by thinking about 'what are the ingredients in this and are they processed?'  

You don't have to be a chemist or a doctor to learn the basics about foods and how they are metabolized (or not metabolized) by the body.    

In this case, none of these fats are dangerous if you eat them very rarely, but many people eat processed or highly processed foods every day.  

The harms accumulate over years and years.  

The rise of lifestyle related disease has become an epidemic in the last couple of decades, in large part due to the nearly constant availability of highly processed foods eaten on a regular basis.  

I love a Coke and a bag of chips as much as anyone, trust me, but I also know that they should only be consumed occasionally.     

Make simple choices:  eat foods you understand and that someone could make with basic ingredients at home.  If you are eating things that you would need a PhD in chemistry and years of chemical-engineering research in an industrial lab to make, then these are ones to steer clear of other than as a treat."
aSLJDGHASDf,fea8n8q,t1_fea10va,">They did not.

Yes, lots of people did.  There was overwhelming evidence that the introduction of trans fats in the 1910s caused a huge increase in a number of dietary diseases, and many doctors and scientists warned about this.  But procter and gamble had a lot of money, and bought a lot of advertising saying that saturated fat is bad for you and margarine and shortening are good.  They even bribed organizations like the american heart association to endorse margarine despite the overwhelming evidence that it causes heart disease."
A-Bone,fea3jji,t1_fea10va,"There may have been a few chemists that suspected that these chemicals would be harmful, but I'd honestly be surprised if the ORIGINAL engineer who figured out how to make this chemical reaction occur had a good understanding of human physiology and how the body processes these molecules.  

Those pioneering food-scientists just knew that what they were doing modified something to have a characteristic that was desirable.  Its still a fat, it still behaves in large part just like its non-hydrogenated counterpart.  

That said, the research on the negative health effects of these fats goes waaaaaaaay back.. like the 1940's and 1950's... and was, unsurprisingly, quashed for decades by the forces you describe.

https://www.vox.com/2015/6/17/8793937/why-fda-banned-trans-fats

That's the crazy part.. how far back this goes.  

Proving direct harms is hard in the US, otherwise the lawsuits surrounding the use of these products would be along the lines of what the tobacco industry faced in the last 20 years... who knows though... It might get to that point someday if states can prove that these companies knew that what they were producing was harmful."
A-Bone,fe8xlcw,t1_fe8pu2v,"'Quickly'??  

I would politely dispute the use of the term 'quickly'... In geological-time maybe.. but these products have been around for generations and are still sitting in people's homes today.  

In the United States the slow move from 'partially' hydrogenated to 'fully' hydrogenated fats and other alternatives has only occurred *very* recently 

Trans fat labeling only started in 2006.

It wasn't until 2015 that the United States Food and Drug Administration made its final determination that partially hydrogenated oils do not meet the requirements for inclusion as an ingredient '[Generally Recongized as Safe (GRAS)](https://www.fda.gov/food/food-ingredients-packaging/generally-recognized-safe-gras)'

[This update from the the US FDA in 2018 ](https://www.fda.gov/food/cfsan-constituent-updates/fda-extends-compliance-date-certain-uses-partially-hydrogenated-oils-food-denies-petition-certain) notes that the elimination of partially hydrogenated fats was extended to this year 2020 to allow industry time to reformulate and test alternatives.

That still doesn't mean that fully hydrogenated oils are good for you or even close to good for you.  Thought they may only have a small impact on cholesterol levels compared to partially hydrogenated oils, they do have an impact on inflammation which in some cases will be  classified as an autoimmune disorder and has another whole host of problems associated with it."

bluewing,fe8hgth,t1_fe7umrt,"Here in the US, for the longest time it was illegal to add the food dye to margarine made for retail. This was a concession to the dairy industry to prevent confusion between the real butter and margarine. So the the stuff was white in the store. And it came with a little packet of yellow food coloring you added and mixed in when you got home.

I can remember as a small boy growing up in rural Minnesota seeing such margarine in the grocery store in the early 1960's. But it disappeared nearly over night by the mid 1960's."
WhatYouDo2dayMatters,fe8h9e1,t1_fe7umrt,"A lot of places banned colored margarine, or banned margarine outright,  in order to protect the dairy industry.

WikiTextBot,fe7ke6g,t1_fe7kdml,"**Margarine**

Margarine (, also UK: , US:  (listen)) is a spread used for flavoring, baking, and cooking that was first made in France in 1869. It was created by Hippolyte M√®ge-Mouri√®s in response to a challenge by Emperor Napoleon III to create a butter substitute from beef tallow for the armed forces and lower classes. It was named oleomargarine from Latin for oleum (olive oil) and Greek margarite (pearl indicating luster) but was later named margarine.Butter is made from the butterfat of milk, whereas modern margarine is made mainly of refined vegetable oil and water. In some places in the United States, it is colloquially referred to as oleo, short for oleomargarine.

MightyRoops,fe8h8xz,t1_fe84iau,"Old _original_ footage is often high quality because proper film has a really good ""resolution"". The reason so much old footage you see on TV or the internet looks bad is because it's a recording off of a TV or a digital scan of a copy that has been lying around in storage and deteriorating for decades.  
You can't really calculate a resolution for an analogue film because there is no analogue counterpart to a pixel but some videographers say that 35mm film is comparable to 4K.  In fact, even if someone found a pristine original film roll from a 50s movie the digital scan could be low quality because the resolution and quality would be bottlenecked by the scanner itself."

Dither is an intentionally applied form of noise used to randomize quantization error, preventing large-scale patterns such as color banding in images. Dither is routinely used in processing of both digital audio and video data, and is often one of the last stages of mastering audio to a CD.

A common use of dither is converting a greyscale image to black and white, such that the density of black dots in the new image approximates the average grey level in the original.

beeman1979,fdribzm,t1_fdri13n,"Bee hives sit outside exposed to the sun, and if you use beeswax or low temp paraffin wax you‚Äôll find the sun liquifies the wax even when the ambient temperature is cool.  

That isn‚Äôt ideal when you are trying to work the bees and everything slips out of your hands while trying to move stuff lol.

Paraffin is petroleum based, and although I cannot point toward legitimate research in support of the following, we feel that limiting exposure to petroleum based products is in the best interest of bee health.

If your operation is disease free then using beeswax would work, but the problem with is that it‚Äôs melt point is far lower than paraffin.  When you‚Äôre trying to work hives/pull honey it would be a bugger."
reddit_give_me_virus,fdqwljd,t1_fdqkt6c,"Perhaps oils? AFAIK some oils have even have slight antibacterial properties too. I use something that is a combo of beeswax and orange oil for unfinished wood.

It's not something I'd use outside though since it doesn't last long. However a straight oil is fast to apply and could even be sprayed on."
redpandaeater,fdue7zd,t1_fdqwljd,"At that point you'd probably want a drying oil that polymerizes to form a solid.  Gotta be careful there with your wet rags so they don't catch fire as it oxidizes.  Another possibility would be a resin like shellac, or maybe even copal.  Both have been used as wood varnish in the past, though the downside of a resin compared to drying oil is they'll still dissolve when exposed to plenty of solvents like ethanol.

As for oils, tung is a very solid choice since it fully hardens."

AFB is a spore. The spore can spread by attaching to a bee while they're pollinating.

beeman1979,fdtenrf,t1_fdteean,"Ah, sorry.

Guess bee keepers aren't carpenters, or very bright."
beeman1979,fdt7f7y,t1_fdqs646,"If you were only dipping in paraffin to control AFB I would agree, just burn it.

But all wooden bee equipment needs to be protected from the elements.  Traditionally this was done with paint, which is crap and requires a lot of maintenance.  Then guys tried dipping in different sealants but it was so so.  Paraffin wax is becoming more prevalent, especially in Canada.  Low cost, low maintenance, long lasting.

I dip all of my new boxes once.  I re-dip my brood supers whenever they come home to be scraped/sorted/etc.  My honey supers are re-dipped as required, which can be 10-15 years."

With the carding it's making all the fibers face the same way.

PapaBearsLittle,fdkrttn,t3_elndln,"I remember doing this on a class field trip, in Toronto we have Black Creek Pioneer Village which is open air heritage museum set like an old pioneering town. It has ""over 40 19th century buildings decorated in the style of 1860s with period furnishings"" and a few original restored structures, ""buildings include Dalziel Barn, period Houses, the original Strong family farm buildings, a water-powered Grist Mill. a general store, a blacksmith shop along with 10 other trades building, a hotel, a church, and a one-room schoolhouse"" all of what you're free to roam.


When I was in grade school we had class trips three to four times a year and Pioneer Village was always one of those trips (as well as the Toronto Metro Zoo) and over the years I remember pulling wool, using a loom to create a blanket and learning how to make and bake biscuits using a stone oven, all hands on. 


It's unfortunate that kids only get one class trip every year now, they miss out on so much.

cjhveal,fdnummx,t3_em1ujq,"For those still wondering about the differences (from wikipedia):

Walk: three feet on the ground at roughly all times

Pace: a two-beat gait where both legs on the same side move together, e.g. Front right and hind right.

Amble: a transitional movement between Walk and Pace, where the same side legs move almost together but not quite. (It looks like the walk they show here is already kind of ambling?)

Trot: a two-beat gait where opposite feet hit the ground together, e.g. front right and hind left 

Canter: a  three-beat gait which has one beat for a hind leg, one beat for a diagonal strike (like the trot) and one beat for the remaining front leg, e.g. HL, HR+FL, FL

Gallup: a four-beat gait in which all four feet are lifted from the ground."

In this movie  you can see T-Cells killing cancer cells.

The cancer cell line is MC38-OVA, a transduced colon cancer cell line that expresses the ovalbumin (OVA) model antigen.

T-cells, coming from OT-I mice, carry a transgenic T-cell receptor responsive to OVA residues 257-264 (SIINFEKL peptide) in the context of the MHC I H2kb.

In this experiment, activated T-cells called ‚Äúeffectors‚Äù (see link for more details), are incubated with MC38-OVA cancer cells. Upon recognition of their target (the OVA residues on the MHC I H2kB of the cancer cells), T-cells induce the killing of the cancer cells. However, this does not happen all the time and many cancer cells survive."

WallflowersAreCool2,fdlj58x,t3_el9dih,That is amazing to watch.  How long is this taking? Is the video sped up?
zryan3564,fdm6yuv,t3_el9dih,It's like the T cells suck the juice out of the cancer cell until it turns inside out. That's cool to watch.
MagicStar77,fdm5w1x,t3_el9dih,"So the more T cells, the more cancer free?"

FalstaffsMind,fdl2li1,t3_elxxp5,"I read once that because LED traffic lights run so cool, that snow accumulates on them in northern climes, and they had to add a heating element to prevent this from happening."
Jimmy_Fromthepieshop,fdl9gz8,t1_fdl2li1,In really advanced countries they put little roofs over each light to stop snow covering them.
FalstaffsMind,fdlacl4,t1_fdl9gz8,"Yes, but depending on conditions, the snow accumulates on those little roofs and blocks the lights above."
Trollgiggity,fdm4vdc,t1_fdlacl4,Led traffic lights can be fitted with heaters to melt the snow and stop it from accumulating. [Technology Connections](https://youtu.be/GiYO1TObNz8) made a video about this very thing.
Jimmy_Fromthepieshop,fdo1d7g,t1_fdlacl4,I see your point. But on the ones I've seen the upper roofs are bigger than the lower ones so it still doesn't happen. I've never seen a traffic light blocked by snow.
Sir-Mattheous,fdl4abs,t3_elxxp5,As a baby I thought there was a little baby inside changing the colors. Like that was their job and they worked their shifts inside of traffic lights. How they got in? I dunno crawl across the wires and drop in from a hatch I guess.
zryan3564,fdm6rir,t3_elxxp5,"I thought traffic lights were white light with a green, red, or yellow filter."
ThePurpleDuckling,fdl08oq,t3_elxxp5,Amazing what 8 LEDs can do.
saulsa_,fdl85e9,t1_fdl08oq,They can‚Äôt melt the snow off the lights though. So that gets fun.

boogaman55,fdk9r5o,t3_elug68,"This is actually called ""crack seal"" used on asphalt roadways as a maintenance operation to extend the lifespan.  The cracks have to be within a maximum threshold and cleaned.  It is a oil based tacky substance when dried and should never be used in sidewalks."
Sushi_ma,fdkhkew,t1_fdk9r5o,I used to test this stuff. Soooo messy...
WarPopeJr,fdkhb35,t1_fdk9r5o,Why not
DavidNipondeCarlos,fdklz53,t1_fdk9r5o,Especially on hotter days these days? It gets sticky.
Sawathingonce,fdlfm4o,t1_fdkhb35,Because tacky? Sticks to shoes / creates a huge mess perhaps?
WarPopeJr,fdlj09i,t1_fdlfm4o,Wouldn‚Äôt they need to let this dry on roads before cars drive over it? Same idea with sidewalks there would be tape blocking off the area
Sawathingonce,fdljjj7,t1_fdlj09i,"Idk not an expert, just guessing and downvoted for the effort"

PWH187,fdknp07,t3_elug68,This must be in more fluent towns and communities. My town slaps down a big uneven mess of gravel and tar that creates a huge bump until it degrades away again.
boogaman55,fdlcwcw,t1_fdknp07,That's called chip seal typically used in places without curb or gutter. It can be used in tandem with crack seal. It's a great maintenance product extending the road life by a maximum of around 7 years depending on the road use and weather conditions.

PTEHarambe,fdx3b5j,t3_enah44,Ok but why though
RDeezBurger,fdx43hu,t1_fdx3b5j,"I think what's happening is the fluid cannot pass between the gears. So, it's required to split and flow around the outer perimeters. And in order to do so, it must push the gears around with it. Finally when the fluid meets at other side, it exits."
BeardedBandit,fdxm0b3,t1_fdx43hu,"Yeah, this seems right. In the very beginning you can see the liquid or bubbles latch onto the top gear's teeth and the leave when it reaches the other side"
jcrice88,fe04kjf,t3_enah44,This is a lobe gear pump.
Byronzionist,fdxfu3w,t3_enah44,No its not
IReallyDontWantAName,fdx2txw,t3_enah44,So the gears spin against flow?
lady622,fdxfciw,t1_fdx2txw,"Yeah, I know nothing at all about this stuff, but it looks backwards to me."
fransschreuder,fdxkc8o,t1_fdxfciw,"The flow goes around the gears, doesn't take the shortest road you see the bubbles go around. It feels counter intuitive, but if you think about it it is logical. Where the two gears meet, the pressure only faces one of the gears teeth, because they are behind the other. In the other direction the fluid will push to both the upper and lower gears teeth, so the direction is that way."
Hatefiend,fdyss0a,t1_fdxkc8o,Wait so is this how all hydraulic machines work? I thought the fluid involved pressure and the multiplication of force or something?
