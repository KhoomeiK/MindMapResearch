Seriously asking, because when I donate it's usually money. Not because it's easy, but because I've been told the organization can do more with all the money pooled together than people individually buying things they think are needed.

Then I'm thinking if he does this every year then they must have said something at the children's hospitals to him about the hats and need them for something. Do they give every kid a Santa hat in hospitals to make them feel better around the holidays or something?"

Imagine being stuck in a bed. For days. Maybe weeks, months. You're only travels are going for tests, imaging, and surgical procedures. Maybe if you are lucky you get to get up and walk to the bathroom
 Maybe you have a needle sticking into your arm, and maybe one in your leg. Wires with electrode pads stuck on your chest. At least in ICU you get a nurse in 30 seconds. On the regular floor ...30 minutes for a pain pill feels like forever. Santa...

 A magical man in a red stocking hat shows up with gifts. And for just a moment ... there is something novel. Some new person. Not the same old doctor, nurse, weird nurse assistant bed pan helper guy. Finally... a moment where someone that is giving something that doesn't hurt...It is not a shot or another stabby blood draw on an already sore vein.  It's a hat. A simple Santa hat. Not a shower 2 in one wash cap that you get to use on bedrest. A real hat. To wear. How neat.


the magic of Santa must be revered. 


I say gift on! Hospital stays are horrifying and that was a sugar coated G rated snippet."
Tevo0617,feckt37,t1_febavqp,"Well what if the hospital just ended up spending the money on full priced Santa hats for the kids once Xmas came around? 

My children’s hospital story: 
 My son jumped off of a roof and impaled himself on a broken branch. He almost died. He had to have emergency surgery and had a colostomy bag for 6 months. 
 During his stay at Fort Worth’s children’s hospital, I was walking down the hall way. There was a tiny little girl with a walker and a nurse, walking towards me. When I passed her, she looked up at me with a huge smile and said “I’m walking!” I lost it. It was one of the sweetest things I’ve ever seen in my life.
The joy and heartbreak that goes on in that place is astronomical"

Imagine a world where instead of throwing everything away at a complete loss, stores were required to donate those items. Clothes that no one has bought and are scheduled to be removed, holiday foods that aren't close to expiring, even things like holiday candy that stores overstock would surely brighten someone's day. I suppose in the end though the logistics of gathering the items, inventorying them, and organizing the donations would cost more than just throwing everything away."

CheesyString,febiex8,t1_feaw4xx,"Hi, I work for Target but we usually push all our seasonal stuff for about week or two depending on inventory and it usually takes about two days for stuff to reach 50% off and it takes about a week for everything to reach the 90% clearance. Once that happens you usually have about a couple days before we salvage everything but once again it depends on the store's inventory. My store still has Christmas stuff and its 90% off."
whythishaptome,febvegd,t1_febiex8,"I work at target too, and it gets cleared out pretty quickly, but there are still a few things there. I was doing plano the day after Christmas and stuff was already 50% at my store. They also start moving the Christmas stuff to a smaller area like a week and a half before Christmas, which is kind of annoying if I am doing Fulfillment. Finding ornaments is a bitch as it is."
GenosHK,fearvpl,t3_eo8q79,"You can also do this in the next few months with coats, gloves, hats, and scarves that go on clearance."
DOOKIEFOOKIE,feat6bx,t1_fearvpl,"Yes!!! And they often go on clearance when there's still some winter months left, so if you are donating them, or giving them out to people who need them, you are a hero and they will sing songs about you!!!

zereldalee,febl13v,t1_fearvpl,Great idea! I buy toys and stuffed animals that have been deeply discounted after the holidays so I have them to give to Toys For Tots the next year.
ComputerGeek365,febbtyx,t3_eo8q79,I'm not saying this to brag but when I  used to work at a pet store I would buy all of the left over Christmas cat toys because I could buy them for almost nothing (less than 10 cents a piece) and donate them to local shelters.

FreshTomatos,febaziu,t3_eo8q79,"When I was maybe about 10 years old, I had internal bleeding from a presumed tobgan wipeout. This lead to me urinating blood, very scary time of my life... anyway it all happend over the course of Christmas, I had to stay at the hospital with an iv in (the nurse who gave me my iv was new, it took her 3 tries to get the needle right, ouch but thanks for your services) I had my own room at the hospital which was nice, there was a couple other kids there as well, as the hospital had a rec room area, I dont remember many of the faces. I was very hungry, I wasnt allowed to eat because if I had to get a camera down my throat the next day I could throw up and die during the scope. Lame. 

Anyway, that night I was taken to a room full of blankets, quilts, to be exact. They were very 90s athsetic, which would make sense the year was 2004 after all. 

Anyway, the whole room was quilts made and donated to the hospital for the children as gifts when they go through somthing difficult. Like sad boys and girls who are upset that santa wont be able to find them. I was one of thos children. 

Later that night, I must've woke up because of how hungry I was but I saw a man, dressed as santa or as I saw it, actualy santa. And straight out of a movie he lifted his finger and said shhhhh and left. After putting out a bionicle and a chocolate santa. I ate the fucking santa, and my mom who was asleep in the chair she wakes up and sees me eating it... reminding me I cannot eat, I was quite nervous due to my mothers nervousness of my intake of well food. 

Lucky, for me, I didnt have to have the scope done. So the eating of the chocolate was okay! And I got a Nintendo DS and a zelda GBA game, four swords. 

Anyway TL;DR kudos to the people who do these things for the hospitals. Had a hospital I was in as 10 year old over Christmas eve. Was scared santa wouldnt find me, they gave me one of many hand made quilts and santa himself visited me in the night. (Cool there is hospitals that have this sort of thing happening for the children there on christmas eve)"

And I feel you on the cynicism...we should celebrate people who do good, but in some cases it feels like applauding they wealthy for throwing a bone to hungry dogs. There are problems that we should be able to address (or even prevent) without having to rely on charitable donations to address. I feel charitable work can also be seen as a reason that systematic changes are not needed (I.e., “we don’t need the government to help address X, look at all the private generosity”)."

Many kids are often too sick to react much and some parents are too distraught to really care about gifts for kids that may not live long enough to enjoy them... But for the most part people are wildly grateful for a small gesture in that stressful moment."

One thing I will never forget about our experience is all the kindness. Volunteers that bring their service animals, the people who sew pillowcases for the kids, the gifts she was given because we almost had to be there on Christmas day.

Powerlevel-9000,febnq69,t3_eo8q79,WalMart would never give these to him because he isn’t a nonprofit but he could probably work something out and have them donate them straight to the hospitals. Retailers are surprisingly good at giving things away. The local Lowe’s gives the fire department 500 smoke alarms every year that the fire department give out to homes that need them for example.

I haven’t set foot in in wal mart in several years, but last few times I did there were always huge lines of customers and only one, MAYBE two employees working the cash registers.

>Volcanic lightning is an electrical discharge caused by a volcanic eruption, rather than from an ordinary thunderstorm. Volcanic lightning arises from colliding, fragmenting particles of volcanic ash (and sometimes ice),[1][2] which generate static electricity within the volcanic plume.[3]

So this was taken in Cavite which is a few kilometers away from Tagaytay (where the volcano is). The ashfall hasn't fully reached Cavite yet at this time which is why the sky is pretty clear still. The guy was helping by washing down the windsheld, windows and lights of the cars fleeing so they can get to their destination safer and before the ashfall gets really bad.

I live in Manila but I used to live in this place. I'm not Chris, but based on the discussion on Facebook, someone said that the guy wore protective stuff as time went on (a neighbor probably - in provinces like this, people are pretty close). Also, he wasn't the only one helping, there was a row of people. However, it's 1 AM now and there have been a few earthquakes in the area, so I believe the guy is home and safe at the moment.

BTW the original Chris commented on Facebook and he said that his passenger chose the music, lol.

Onceabanana,fe336mi,t1_fe2wcrk,"The problem with dusting off the ash is that it is abrasive and will scratch the heck out of your car and glass. Water is advised so you can wash it away gently. As long as the water doesnt pool with the ash and wont create the heavy mud, then you are good. Another problem is dry ash will spread into the air, scatter, and could be a health hazard. The challenge here is to make sure it gets filtered before getting into the sewage. But since this is the area near the volcano, evacuation is priority, thus the good guy helping people with their windshields. So far we are getting reports of vehicular accidents and some cars even falling in ravines due to bad visibility and road conditions (its raining in some parts). I am hoping these are not true, kind of hard to verify all the stuff being posted and shared online.

I was there a couple of years ago and paid to ride the smallest horse I had ever seen to the top of the volcano. 

What struck me most was that the entirety of the tiny island’s inhabitants owed their livelihood to this tourism. I wonder how they and all those horses are getting out and where can they go

The lake surrounding the island also has a lot of fisheries. Those are probably doomed as well."

Sonymax400056,fdvnedl,t3_en60f9,When you take being a healer to the next level
Jfire25931,fdx6r2l,t1_fdvnedl,"Thats honestly a great mindset for healers and other support players to have. You aren’t responsible for JUST in-game stuff. A good healer or support can mend a group’s morale and make sure everyone is in good spirits. Honestly the real world aspect of being a good healer is a strong reason why I am a heal main, AND why I’m a brain and behavioral major. There is a lot more overlap than one may think. To any aspiring heal or support mains, my main tip isn’t about game mechanics or knowledge, it is to make sure your team isn’t socially falling apart and to check in on guildies or pug regulars if they’re goin through some shit. Not only is it helpful to them in a real way, but often it makes the game more enjoyable if everyone is in good spirits even if you wipe or fail a bunch."

Two_Tone_Anarchy,fdwvlnt,t1_fdwjnhm,As someone who played multiple dps in different games. If the tank could maintain fuckin aggro we wouldnt have this problem
gquinn18,fdx97xk,t1_fdx4yee,Correct
FuckReaperLeviathans,fdx931p,t1_fdwn225,"And then you have tanks like me who blame themselves for everything. DPS manages to aggro another bunch of mobs and gets himself killed while we're all dealing with the current group? My fault, I should have pulled them off him. Healer sits merrily under AoE warnings and makes no attempt to move? My fault, I should have moved further away from him so he wouldn't have been covered by the AoE markers. DPS fails a dps check in time and gets us all wiped? My fault, I should have been adding my damage to his.

Basically I end up taking it as a personal failure every time a party member but me takes damage."

KittenOnHunt,fdvtcz6,t1_fdvb8pr,"I had a problem like this but on a way smaller scale. My grandpa called us and he cried and moaned from pain on the phone and said to help him. I never, never never heard my grandpa cry before. He's pretty tough. So it was very Clear he had problems, especially because we knew he had problems with his heart a lot before. I called 112 (German Emergency Number) and said that my Grandpa that lives in another city (25~ Kilometers) away called us and he needs help. The guy on the phone questioned me and said ""well yeah but then you're on the wrong number, this is for your city. Also how can you know why your grandpa needs help, when he only called you?"" I told him to dial me to his city so I can call help for him as I don't know the specific number for his city. He did it and then I called help. I will never understand his dumb questioning and why he didn't just do it. Easyly wasted like 2 minutes in an emergency. Fuck this guy"
mightysparks,fdw0exm,t1_fdvb8pr,"A guy on a forum I admin posted he was going to kill himself one day.

Youlookcold,fdvz5ap,t1_fdvb8pr,"She had his address, it says in the article."
MystikIncarnate,fdwo5jq,t1_fdvb8pr,"Generally you can't.

In the article, the caller had the address of the person already, but, didn't have their phone number.

The trick is, if you call 911/112 it will take a relatively long time for your local service to contact the service near the person and get help to them, the best thing to do is to look up the police service non emergency number in that area and call that, they're present at all times and usually less busy than the 911 service. You get to talk to the region directly and get the help to the person by cutting out several layers of people trying to relay the message through the 911 offices.

I'm guessing this is why cops showed up first, the American called the UK police hotline, so they were first to respond."

NotYourIT,fdwee0y,t1_fdvo4hk,"Still worth a shot. I was a 911 dispatcher for a while and we had a similar call that a woman was going to kill herself. The man calling only knew here name, guessed an age, and the name of the big city she lived in, 5 states away. It took us over an hour of searching and calling but eventually we got all of the info needed and the local PD found her in the bathtub prepared to carry out her plan. I didn’t get all of the details but their dispatch called us in the end to let us know she was okay. It was a bit surreal to see so many agencies work together at 2-4 AM to find this woman with so little info."
_Rastapasta_,fdwjb17,t1_fdvo4hk,"Idk about this individual situation, but sometimes, before my sister has a seizure, she can tell it's about to happen about 30 seconds before it does.

rabidhamster87,fdvwh93,t1_fdvtcz6,"I don't know about Germany or emergency dispatchers, but when I worked in IP relay we were coached to ask questions before dialing when someone wanted emergency services.  I hated that, so I didn't do it, and I ended up putting through and having to relay a phone call for a deaf person who had simply locked their keys in their car.... I always asked questions before dialing after that.  Maybe they have a similar protocol for similar reasons?"
alex_moose,fdwtuot,t1_fdvtcz6,"LPT:. Look up the direct dial number for emergency dispatch in the cities in which your loved ones live, and add them to your contacts.  In the event of an emergency like this, you'll be able to call the correct department directly.

In the United States and some other countries, you'll be looking up the ""non emergency"" number - it's impossible to dial 911 or its equivalent from out of the area.  But in many places, the emergency dispatchers also answer the regular phone number, so you'll still have reached the best person to get help.

If you can't find the number yourself, have your friend or relative contact their local department and ask what number to use.  You do the same for your city, and then swap information with them."

Zeikos,fdvo6l1,t1_fdvekr8,"The issue is that usually if you phone the emergency number of another country you get routed to your country's one, so as the woman said she had to call the non-emergency line, which well is not the best when it's an actual emergency."

YeaTired,fdvwsds,t1_fdvuw9z,Hypothetically you could tell them to contact Sony or Microsoft with their username and maybe the emergency services could get the address of the username?

Noxava,fdwnqzb,t1_fdwee0y,"Don't get me wrong, it is always worth a shot, but realistically, if you have no clue about where he lives outside of the country (or even city), it will be extremely difficult to get help to them. Imagine if you know the friend is from Salvador and you live in Sofia"

DiscountFCTFCTN,fdvvbg4,t1_fdvo6l1,"Do country codes not work for emergency numbers?

What’s the difference between the FBI and the paramedics?"
LaRealiteInconnue,fdvzkcf,t1_fdvwsds,Hypothetically yes. But at least in the US that’d require a warrant and a probable cause to get that warrant. A person calling from another country because someone maybe in trouble without an address wouldn’t suffice. Id say at that point if you have their full name and at least a city call the precinct in that city and ask for a wellness check. Don’t think it’d would work for super common names or in a big city 🤷🏻‍♀️
Eleaniel,fdw51nx,t1_fdvwsds,"Hypothetically yes, but I'm not sure that the companies would be ""fast"" enough to answer"

rabidhamster87,fdw3aij,t1_fdw0idv,"I don't know if it's around anymore, but there used to be a free online service intended for the deaf, hard-of-hearing, and speech disabled that allowed them to make regular telephone calls through the internet via an operator like me.  Basically, they'd get on the website, connect to an operator, give the number they wanted to dial, then the operator would call the number, and pretty much act like a ""translator"" of sorts, speaking everything the  caller typed and typing everything the  answerer on the other end said.  


It was honestly really cool.  Deaf people would use it for all kinds of stuff from calling a store for their hours to calling family and friends, and even emergency calls.  Unfortunately, because it was a free service on the internet, it got super abused by people who didn't actually need it though. I'm pretty sure it still exists in some form, but I think it lost a lot of necessity when smart phones became a thing."

Which I suppose makes sense - there are enough Americans that visit the UK that eventually *some* of them will need emergency help, and they might panic and call 911, you might as well have that number redirect to 999 if you can."
Higgs_Br0son,fdwivy0,t1_fdvvbg4,"No, that's a cool idea, but that wouldn't work. They're not actual phone numbers, more like a code that tells your phone carrier to route the call to the nearest emergency call center."

PM_Me_Nordic_Legends,fdx8v8v,t1_fdw1l5h,"I was reading this article the other day about how intelligence agencies have been resorting to hiring foreign hackers to break into the phones of suspected terrorists because Apple and Facebook and Google won't cooperate with law enforcement. Apparently, one of these hacks was discovered by Facebook, who sent a notification to the people that they had been hacked, including an ISIS terrorist who was planning a major attack in Europe. The terorist's phone went dark, as did all the other ones. So yeah, these companies care so much about their privacy policies and won't break their rules for anyone, even if lives are on the line (and yet somehow Cambridge Analytics got the personal information of hundreds of thousands of Americans.

It's one of the first things we were trained to do at my station in regards to missing persons. I'm not sure of the exact circumstances of your situation, but it's shameful that they didn't provide you with even this basic level of assistance.

Who knows what could have happened if she didn’t do what she did. He could have had another seizure, fallen, etc."
WoodsWalker43,fdwz9fd,t1_fdw6fit,"That's kinda true, depending on the person, but you still shouldn't leave someone alone during/after a seizure. You should always make sure they aren't on their back because they can vomit and choke. You also want to make sure their head and limbs aren't hitting anything harmful, remove glasses, etc. while seizing, though you shouldn't try to hold them still either. Plus, the risk of having another seizure is elevated in the 24 hours after a seizure, so you generally at least want to keep the person in earshot during that time. EMS generally isn't necessary unless the seizure is too long, or if another seizure hits shortly after the first.

I've had probably a half dozen or so good gaming friends over the past 20 years who've had my home address for one reason or another, but usually to send gifts and shit.  When you're spending anywhere from 2-8 hours a day with someone every day, it's natural you're going to grow close.

Firestronaut,fdvv61c,t1_fdvmcs1,"A local non-emergency number. They can upgrade the call to emergency from there. 

I had to call Irish emergency services with only a name and an approximate location after a young girls mental health diminished online. She was threatening suicide, and was a mess. Normally she held her shit together well.

Emergency services were able to find her from the information given, and her family thanked me after getting her some acute mental health care. 5/6 years later, she's finished university, had a baby and is finally in a good place in her life."

Killtrend,fdvx6fm,t1_fdvw4rv,You can’t dial 911 for Florida if you’re in Cali for example. You gotta be there to be routed. The job emergency number was a genius idea. They still answer and can dispatch.
mickeymouse4348,fdxzgh3,t1_fdvw4rv,Fun fact: That’s why if you use a landline you can get the correct 911 operator faster. If you call 911 on a cell phone you’ll get a state or county operator who will ask for the location of the emergency and route your call to local dispatch

It just depends on the schedule for the day which button you click to process calls for the day. Same computers, same consoles, same resources. 

If it’s an emergency call 911. You’re not bothering us I promise. Those calls don’t wait. If you call non-emergency and it’s a period of busy call volume you may not reach anyone because they’ve all switched over to accept emergency calls."

Trucknessa,fdy6p1b,t3_en60f9,"A very similar situation happened to me when I was 16. I've been diagnosed with epilepsy since I was 14 and I would have a grand mal seizure (the ones where you shake) every 3-4 months. I'd always warn people that I did have epilepsy and I'd give them instructions on what to do because a lot of people freakout and have no idea what to do. I'd also tell that if I felt a seizure coming, I'd say elephant. At the time, I've never been able to feel one coming but I've always said in case it were to happen.

This one night I was home alone because my dad was working a 24hr shift (he's a firefighter) and a few of my friends from school and I were playing GTA. Out of nowhere, I felt a seizure coming so I yelled elephant through the mic. Thankfully 2 of my friends had my dad's number so they called him. He got in the firetruck with everyone in his station, turned the sirens on, got to our house within minutes and I got rushed to the hospital because I nailed my head on the corner of my desk and was bleeding like crazy. If it weren't for my friends, it could of been a lot worse and to this day I still thank them for that."
CroissantAficionado,fdvrckd,t3_en60f9,"There’s an app called “what3words” that can be used when you’re in a location you don’t, everywhere in the world has been split into equal squares with dedicated words to that square, this can been used by police and emergency services to locate you! I have it just in case I’m ever lost"
hhhhh-hhh-hh,fdvvodz,t1_fdvrckd,"It's also proprietary (so you can't use it in an app without their express permission), and requires internet (so their ""goal"" of giving addresses to the addressless can't really happen)"

barsoap,fdw6usv,t1_fdvrckd,"So... to look up those words you need some kind of position information, say, latitude and longitude from GPS. Then you relay those words to emergency services, which are then going to convert them to latitude and longitude to send to a vehicle, who are then going to see a blip on the map.

How about cutting out the middle-man and just telling people your position *in bloody numbers*."

Catsrules,fdxg7bb,t1_fdw6usv,The point is the three words are easy to remember and comunicate vs lat and log that are not easy to remember at least for most people.
meiyouL5,fdx1fr6,t1_fdw6usv,Gah. I was in a large park in nyc once when I found someone unresponsive. Took 8 minutes for 911 to figure out where I was. I had GPS but they couldn't use lat/lon.
hhhhh-hhh-hh,fdw5yyn,t1_fdw0yyz,"Or literally just lat/long coordinates, which also have the benefit of being able to tell if you're 3 metres or 30000 away."
plopzer,fdw7cgk,t1_fdw5yyn,Converting wgs84 lat/lng to distance in meters is not computationally simple. Its the whole reason why epsg:3857 web mercator is a thing.
hhhhh-hhh-hh,fdw87la,t1_fdw7cgk,"Not exact conversion, just the fact that w3w changes the 3 words completely every square: so index.home.raft isn't anywhere near index.home.square, for instance. That makes it a crappy way of giving a location, because if your GPS's connection cuts out halfway through the journey, you can't even tell if you're pointing in the right direction."

allycat863,fdx5qfa,t3_en60f9,Something like this happened to me recently. A few months ago I was woken up at 3am by someone pounding on the window. It was the police and they demanded I let them in the apartment. Turns out that my roommate had attempted suicide. He had posted about wanting to do it on reddit and a police officer from another state read the post and they were able to send the police to our apartment. Not entirely sure how. But a reddit stranger saved my friends life that night.

booboo4512,fdwig68,t3_en60f9,Seizures are frightening but really hardly threatening.  If its diagnosed a trip to the hospital  afterwards is often unnecessary.
sheloveschocolate,fdwniu8,t1_fdwig68,Yes they are depending on what type of seizure it is. There are 40 known types of seizures some do need a hospital visit e.g tonic/clonics if it goes over a certain amount of time. Seizures like absent seizures dont require a hospital visit.

He walks up to her.. explains who he is.. gets down on one knee..

“Will you marry me Senpai?”

She scoffs, rolls her eyes, and everyone around her starts laughing. His heart drops to the floor. He suddenly transcends into an overwhelming feeling of rage.

SparklyTentacle,fdvr56r,t3_en60f9,I have a good friend with epilepsy and she'd be pissed if someone called her an ambulance because of a seizure. That shit is expensive.
zxanthion,fdvsjiv,t1_fdvr56r,In 1st world countries you generally don't pay for ambulances.
cec772,fdvvjsp,t1_fdvr56r,"My roommate in college had a seizure and was mad. But from what I remember, not so much because about the ambulance,  but because there isn’t much they really do but observe, and now there’s a record of it, and could affect things like drivers license.  (Something like having to be seizure free for 3 years?)"
CraftyDrews,fdvtpp8,t1_fdvr56r,"Where I live calling an ambulance and going to the hospital costs nothing. 

Yet my brothers best friend got mad at him for calling an ambulance when she got an epileptic seizure. He found out it was because his friend didn’t take her meds, and he asked her why, and it was because she takes it with her breakfast, but she never eats breakfast. So my brother started bringing her breakfast to school, which she got mad and embarrassed about, but he was mad at her for neglecting her meds and pointed out that he was the one handling her epileptic seizures. 

I don’t know how it ended but I haven’t heard him telling about more seizures since then."
starych_ziemniakow,fdvv00f,t1_fdvr56r,iirc it doesn’t cost money in the UK thanks the the NHS. That’s mostly the US where healthcare is privatized and based on profit.
SauronOMordor,fdvxx9l,t1_fdvr56r,"I live in Canada and yeah we generally pay for ambulance rides too, but in the grand scheme of things, $500 is worth the piece of mind and anyone who would be mad at someone literally trying to save their fucking life because they are scared and know something is wrong but don't know what else to do is an asshole."
gravityisweak,fdvv0vp,t1_fdvr56r,Not necessarily life threatening but there was no way fire her to know.
Arbornaut,fdwhpni,t1_fdvr56r,"I have epilepsy and uncontrolled seizures. It really depends on the situation. If no one knows I have epilepsy and they see me convulsing and not breathing and turning blue - I cant be mad at someone for calling an ambulance. It has actually saved my life in the past, so I'm grateful. I'm lucky that I only pay a co-payment fee in Canada, so I can understand your friends situation. All you can do is try to explain your epilepsy to people, and how to tell when it is an emergency. The main thing is timing the seizure - if it lasts more than 6 minutes, it is a medical emergency epilepsy or not. Breathing can often stop during a seizure, and if the patient doesn't come out of it on their own, they need medical attention immediately. I went into a coma once from a seizure that wouldn't stop, and woke up in the hospital not knowing who I am or what happened. I'm so happy someone called an ambulance for me that day. I've had hundreds of seizures alone with no major problems, but that doesn't mean it can't be an emergency again- and I hope my friends and family know when to make that call if they see it happen. Just to reiterate - seizure should last 2-3 minutes, but if they do not come out of it in 6 minutes, call an ambulance. During convulsions do not try and restrain them or move them, just make sure their head is protected from hitting something hard or sharp. When convulsions stop, try and place them on their side in case they vomit or have a lot of bleeding in the mouth from a bit tongue. Stay with them and talk calmly to them when they come to - they will be confused and disoriented, so they may panic and lash out. Sorry if this is all well understood already, just putting it all out there for anyone who is interested."
yukicarlee19,fdvwwhr,t1_fdvsjiv,My parents paid 600$ when I fainted in 2008 for an ambulance. It's probably way more expensive nowadays.

Arbornaut,fdwno4k,t1_fdwm8h8,"It depends... if they deem the ambulance unnecessary in Ontario, they charge $250. I'm really not sure how they determine that, but in my case I wasnt breathing and went in to a coma, so definitely necessary."

bastardbarber1,fe014ep,t1_fe00rli,"You can... atleast in Tennessee you can use a fixed blade straight razor as long as you have more than one so it can sit in the barbicide for the recommended amount of time, same with shears/clippers/trimmers.


Many barbers use medical gloves because 
A.) dudes hair is obviously probably greasy the grease can transfer to the clippers and you run the risk of dropping them.

B.) hair can splinter and get stuck in your hands and it’s very painful, if it’s not painful and goes unnoticed it can get infected and you can lose your whole hand. If you look at barbers on Instagram and YouTube this is common practice old guys just don’t do it because their hands have built a callous for it. Elegance barber company makes gloves specifically for barbers."

bastardbarber1,fe033yx,t1_fe02t66,I can’t speak for this guy but I still refuse cuts if there’s open soars or parasites. What state are you in? Most states allow the use of conventional straight razors no barbers use them besides hipsters though because it’s a million times faster to change the blade rather than strop it. You acting like you know how to prevent the spread of disease in my line of work when I studied it and to take state tests to prove my knowledge is also laughable. Dudes doing it on the street cause most homeless are embarrassed to come in the shop if they care about their hair AND this is during a time he won’t have to pay boot rent so he’s not loosing more money then he already is. That’s why I don’t do it in the shop anyway.

EevelBob,fdyznf6,t3_enc81p,"Sorry, no other backstory. I took this picture when my wife and I were in Philly last Saturday 1/4, so just guessing that maybe he does this once a month, or on the first Saturday of the month? We walked past him and up a few more blocks around 4 PM, crossed the street and walked back down the other side. When we came back, there were 2 more people standing nearby waiting their turn, so he might have some regular schedule for giving out free haircuts in the area."

This guy has been doing this for years now in Philly. I assume people there know where/when to find him.

My city has a large homeless population and I may or may not have been in that situation for a few months. ,ಠ_ಠ  Anyways, there was a young man giving out free haircuts at the bus terminal downtown (where all buses meet up eventually). The owner of the 7-eleven noticed the man giving free haircuts, as it was drawing a small crowd (line) of 10 or so homeless people. He called the cops and the cops arrested the guy who was giving free haircuts. Apparently it's illegal in my city."

**Around 480 million animals are feared to have died in Australia’s bushfires, including nearly a third of the koalas in New South Wales's main habitat.**

These catastrophic megafires are worsening the extinction crisis we’re already facing.

**Here is some general advice for helping wildlife during bushfires**:

1. **Take domestic animals with you if you evacuate** or keep cats indoors and dogs under control wherever possible so that wildlife can flee safely through your yard if needed.
2. **Leave out bowls of water for animals fleeing the fires**, use shallow bowls with a few sticks or stones on one side to allow smaller animals to escape if they fall in.
3. **Keep a cardboard box and towel in the boot of your car** in case you find an injured animal that you can safely contain without putting yourself in any danger.
4. **If you rescue an animal that has been burnt, do NOT attempt to feed it; wrap it loosely, ideally in 100% cotton fabric, place it in a ventilated box with a lid and keep it in a dark, quiet place whilst waiting for a rescuer or for transport to the nearest vet.**
5. **If you can safely take injured animals to your nearest vet do so**, as injured animals will require urgent vet assessment. If you can also contact your local wildlife rescue service or WIRES: 1300 094 737
6. **Do not approach injured snakes, flying-foxes, large macropods, raptors or monitors as these must be rescued by trained specialists**, for these species please call WIRES first for rescue assistance on 1300 094 737.
7. **If you own a swimming pool and live near where fires are burning** there are some simple things you can do to assist wildlife who may be seeking water. 

Always drape something over the edge of your pool so that animals have a surface to grab hold of and climb out. A length of heavy duty rope or even a bodyboard, secured at one end to something heavy outside the pool, is ideal as it does not absorb water and provides a platform for an exhausted animal to rest on. 

Pool steps are also frequently too high to allow animals an easy exit and placing bricks or large stones to the side of each step can make it easier for animals to gain a foothold and climb out. 

Always check your pool regularly (twice daily) including in the skimmer box. If you do find any animal trapped in a pool, call WIRES immediately on 1300 094 737 for advice.

e_nathan,fdmid7j,t1_fdlkdrq,Yes you’re correct !
e_nathan,fdkgwct,t1_fdkegwd," Good question ! The toxicity of chlorine is really dose dependent.

PetMD says: “Pool water contains very dilute levels of chlorine, and is unlikely to cause chlorine poisoning in humans or animals.”

Obviously fresh non-chlorinated water is best, but in an emergency like the wildfires are, dilute chlorinated pool water consumed over the short-term should not pose a significant risk to the health of wild animals."
ziggymango,fdjc61i,t3_elod3o,How clever!
Ranaestella,fdjl107,t3_elod3o,How chill are koalas that you can just pick one up and contain it in a playpen? Are they just nautrally docile or are these ones injured?
Benfromsyd,fdjpjmg,t1_fdjl107,"They're pretty chill mostly because of their diet which is mostly leave which gives them little energy. Along with Most of them are actually exhausted at the moment due to the fires and lack of water. 

All mammals also like to wrapped in a blanket which acts as a pouch or a natural mother's protection or whatnot. Which you'll see is done in most photos.

Otherwise, like a cat. To be picked up from behind and their bum given support. Their claws will leave marks. 

Edit: Been on the beers."
imsickandicantspell,fdlbaw9,t1_fdjl107,They aren't chill (I work in wildlife rescue in Australia) these are just injured and stressed ones. The males get very territorial and they are incredibly strong and can easily claw your arms. They won't hurt you as long as you leave them alone. But with stuff like this you have to be careful with them.
tgibook,fdjsnr9,t1_fdjpjmg,"They are not at all what you'd expect when you hold them. They're very docile but dense and heavier than you'd think. Their fur is coarse not soft. They smell horrible because they hang out stacked on a tree trunk and pee on each other. They have pretty gnarly talons.

All in all though, I'd hold one everyday if I could! So totally worth it."

tjfraz,fe2d3n4,t1_fe0bk8t,When my roommate docks and makes its happy sound I say “thank you señor roomba”. My roomba is Spanish for some reason.

Lord412,fe2fxxw,t1_fe160ww,Just so you know roombas are Christmas presents. (This is a joke. Some guy got his wife a room and she was offended and upset about it. I can’t find the post.)

Kid: you know what would really tie this room together?  Poop!"
Lord412,fe2i682,t1_fe2gv54,I truthfully get excited about any gift. And I would get excited about a roomba! I think he gave us to much personal information about his relationship and since he traveled so much and wasn’t around enough so people called him the asshole lol. The comments in that section were wild. Lots of bitter people.
D3M0N5L4Y3RS,fe2inrt,t1_fe2i682,"Bitter because they don’t have a sweet, sweet roomba probably"

And yes, the Roomba is pretty awesome. It's nice to come home to a vacuumed floor. I feel like an incredibly boring person to say this; but my dream before owning a house is to be able to afford a housekeeper and meal prep service. A roomba is well short of that of course but it still feels like a small step in the right direction lol."

akoli,fdvbll2,t1_fdv61tn,I had a friend who used to have them regularly. He wasn't sure what set him off . He would get this angry look in his eyes and his neck would start to cramp and seize up ... We just got him to ground and made him safe and comfortable. It would pass after ten minutes and we would just go on with the work day. His were obvious but I know others who just come on instantly.
transpercy0456,fdvbrnm,t1_fdv61tn,"Idk about other people so all based on my own experience, yes I can tell when I'm about to have one. The feeling is like that weird feeling you get after pulling an all nighter mixed with feeling like you're about to faint.

Atmoist,fdvceb7,t1_fdv61tn,"I personally can feel tonic clinic seizures coming for up to about an hour. It’s a weird skittish feeling that almost gives me tunnel vision, and feels like I can’t think straight as well as being very jumpy, shaky etc. This slowly builds up until I have the seizure. So not very often do I just drop without knowing what’s coming. Hope this helped :) this is just personal to me and everyone has different problems with their epilepsy"
GingerSnapz1620,fdvirf3,t1_fdv61tn,"It's not stupid at all. They're different for everyone. There are many types of seizures / epilepsy from what I've learned. A lot of people do have the auras, mine happen in my sleep so I never know they're coming, and usually don't know they even happened until my bf tells me."
RSGK,fdwiu29,t1_fdv61tn,"Some people with epilepsy have a focal seizure (""aura"") before it generalizes into a tonic-clonic seizure (""grand mal""). Sometimes these focals last long enough for someone to get themselves in a safe position and/or take rescue medication to prevent a tonic-clonic. But a lot of people's focals are so disabling or brief that it's not a useful warning. And many people get no ""aura"" at all, they just have a tonic-clonic without any warning."

GingerSnapz1620,fdvoji9,t1_fdvo019,I didn't know anything about it before my first seizure. And I still didn't / don't know as much as I should a couple years later... So it's okay.
drfjgjbu,fdwk3pm,t1_fdwfhe6,"It makes sense with how deja vu supposedly works. Your brain starts storing short-term memory as long-term so you feel like it's happened before. So it happening right before a seizure would be like your brain saving your progress before the system crashes and reboots. 

That's the theory anyway. I don't really know how either process works, and I don't think there's a real medical consensus either."

minicpst,fdw283c,t1_fdw101c,"I had a seizure during a short EEG last month. The doctor who read it said I didn’t have epilepsy because the EEG was negative. I told the tech going in that it would be negative, even if I seized. Right after I had it I said, “it’s not showing anything, is it?”  He was non committal in his answer. Sure enough, nada. Not sure why my doctor wanted it, since it’s be negative. 

The EEG only picks up surface scans. 

I haven’t had an MRI since. I had one in July of 2018, before my diagnosis, due to a jaw injury. That showed them I had no lesions or tumors, and that my brain had no scarring. Not sure if it shows differently for epileptics. I suspect not. But he was at least able to tell me it wasn’t due to concussions or having a 59% O2 stat once."
GingerSnapz1620,fdw2uxf,t1_fdw283c,"Wait, so what you and I were told was different. They told me I have epilepsy, because they can't tell me why I have seizures.

Nah, that was number four of the month. I had seven in December/this month (seizure free six days now) and I’d had 34 between my first and starting meds in the hospital. 

Epilepsy, I’ve got it. And I can tell you exactly where in my brain misfires. 

That doc was just wrong. I waited until my neuro was back from holiday vacation to make changes so I wouldn’t have to reexplain it to so many people. I’m on a new med now and it’s helping. My second new med in a month. That one didn’t work."

wosmo,fdvfgup,t1_fdsv40i,"She called the non-emergency line, which is actually a damned good idea.  It’s like calling the police station instead of 911 - it’s a regular phone number with a regular area code, so it’s just like dialling any other number (instead of being routed by magic and pixies like 911/999).

So the whole thing was probably a lot more realistic than it sounds - stick “widnes police” into google, and their local number (with international dialing code!) shows in the info box at the side.  

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-merseyside-51063009

In the video half way down the page, they have some of the call recorded.

(This isn’t to downplay what she did; calling the other side of the planet isn’t remarkable anymore.  Googling a phone number isn’t remarkable.  Actually keeping your head on and deciding you should, instead of assuming there’s nothing you can do from here, very much is)"
mockingblue,fdvjpr3,t1_fdsv40i,"I actually had to do this once. I was watching my out of state friend do a stream on twitch and he ended up passing out on camera. We called his number to see if we could rouse him, tried contacting anyone in his vicinity, but finally I had to resort to looking up in the number of the police station in his city. In my experience, it was incredibly easy for me to speak to someone and give details. I was upfront and told them I was watching someone on a live stream who had passed out and that I was not in the state. I told them that first so they wouldn’t think I was pulling a prank. I then gave them his name and his age and they put me on hold. They returned and asked me to confirm a physical description (“Does he have this color hair?” Super easy questions) and said they had found his address and would dispatch a team. They took my name and phone number as a precaution, and later when they reached my friend they told him that a person with my name had sent them in order to confirm that he knew me. Everything turned out really well and despite the fact that I didn’t have a lot of information, they were able to piece it together.

I assume calling your emergency number and explaining something's going on internationally, they'll be able to patch you through - no clue though"

When that didn't work I just had to hope the non-emergency would work, it had an option for talking to a real person...and I can't tell you how quickly I clicked that button.

Maybe we should establish something like this on the EU level. Just for cases like this."
aperson,fdvtpyo,t1_fdvfgup,Some non-emergency numbers are routed the exact same as the emergency number.
wosmo,fdx90jk,t1_fdx753r,"It’s a tough one. We have 112, but you can’t dial it from the the US. Everything that makes an emergency number useful, makes it difficult to call from abroad. 

Calling the local station probably was her best bet. What I’m curious about is how that’d work out of hours - ours closes 8pm, and I game at 2am. And tbh, if someone in the EU is mostly gaming with Americans (regularly enough that Miss Texas has his home address), it’s probably because they’re a night owl."
untergeher_muc,fdxa23c,t1_fdx90jk,I was thinking of just a number where you can call and then they redirect you to the right local station.

NolinNa,fduic3q,t3_emzuje,My husband tried to imply today that online friendships were less valuable than face to face ones. I argued to him that they have the potential to be the most authentic and genuine. This is a great proof for me of how impactful they can be
FinalDoom,fdum9f6,t1_fduic3q,"I want to say that's an incorrect belief held by those who didn't grow up with the internet. But who knows.

Anecdotally, I only have one remaining long term friend that I met in real life first. The vast majority of my long term friendships are online, and some of them I've still not met in person (mostly out of the country). Not counting newer friendships that haven't yet stood the test of time. Those online friendships are also more quickly and deeply authentic, while it takes much longer to reach that point in person many times. Probably for me that's due to communication efficiency differences."

NolinNa,fduo87x,t1_fdum9f6,"I totally agree with you that it can be a generational difference. My hubby is only 36 but isn’t tech savvy and is also an extrovert who makes superficial friends very easily. Given that he doesn’t have experience with making distant but meaningful friendships so I had to explain it to him as “imagine pouring out your true self, thoughts, heart and soul. And the worst thing that happens is you no longer talk or have any association with each other.” I find it so much easier to be authentic to people online who play no “influential” role in my day to day life. At times I have social anxiety and face to face interactions can be draining. But to have someone accept you without fear of interrupting your work or family life and still loving you is incredibly peaceful and relieving. My online friend and I have been friends and stayed in regular contact for 15 years. Even though we have never met he’s played a huge role in my life <3.  I wish everyone could have a friend like that."

So yeah technically it has alcohol, but you have to drink A LOT to feel the effects. I have a low tolerance and I'd need 3-4 beers at 5% to feel tipsy (1-2L).

ChoosingIsHardToday,fdkb5mv,t1_fdj5jc0,A 0.5% beer is fine. In fact it's actually safe to still consume alcohol in small quantities while pregnant (an occasional glass of wine for example) during the first trimester. I'm pretty sure we just harp the no alcohol while pregnant thing because people don't understand moderation.

You're only supposed to greet, check receipts and check cams if someone asks you too. The worst part is, if you ask someone to stop because you saw them stealing, they can just keep walking. You have to then grab pics, if there are any good ones from the shitty security cams and file a bunch of shit for a fucking report. Best buy doesnt call the cops unless they absolutely have too."
Lutya,fe9zyr3,t1_fe9jooo,"Former Best Buy employee here (like 15 years ago). We were instructed NEVER to confront a thief beyond talking for two reasons. 1. The thief could sue for assault and battery. 2. We had a loss prevention associate stabbed and put in critical condition after confronting a thief. 

No amount of petty theft was worth the cost of  hospital bills or a civil suit from a business perspective. We had several managers and employees fired for escorting thieves by the arm etc to the office."
bklyndamsel,fe9pbgl,t1_fe9jooo,"because if a robber breaks into my house and hurts himself, I can get sued. Weird but true."

Putting hands on anyone unless you're putting them in cuffs will get you fired and likely get you a law suit for assault due to how the laws are in Hawaii. And to make it even better, if you're a ""visual security officer"" like how I was and not an ""investigator"" you're completely unable to do anything with the cameras, you're expected to stand motionless at one of the several entrances (and you're likely the only one doing this) and just stand there. You're not allowed to do anything like patrols or even talk to anyone that the ""investigators"" are tailing, if you even look in their direction you get bitched at."

RIP_FartMaster,feac6m1,t1_fea7ubt,"Best Buy employees used to earn an annual bonus based on how well the store beat it's estimated shrink, so there was legitimate incentive at one time to stop shoplifters, as they were literally taking money out of your pocket.  I worked at a store that outperformed it's shrink significantly and ended up with a little over $1000 on a bonus check, which was uncommon but not rare.

To my understanding now, it's no longer a shrink bonus, but a profit-sharing one that take shrink into account and does not kick in for employees unless the store surpasses their estimated operating profit by at least 3%, where the old one was directly tied to shrink only.  You used to be able to get a bonus on shrink if the store underperformed, as the one I worked at did due to long-going construction making it difficult for shoppers to easily get in and out (we had missed yearly operating profit by about 1% that year despite this, but only the managers garoused because they were also the only ones eligible for that)."

It just isnt worth it. Security is there to ""Observe and Report"", not be cowboys."
tunaburn,feca1q1,t1_feaeqwy,You dont own it. Best buy does. And you sign a contract that forbids you from assaulting anyone over theft. Not to mention you are not allowed to assault people over petty theft even if it is yours legally.

Dominus716,febtc0d,t1_febrpti,"As someone else said, the simple thing of there being any form of security beyond cameras (most of the domes you see on the ceiling are empty BTW) prevents the casual shoplifters. The people that actually go through with it usually planned ahead of time."

Dominus716,fecymvg,t1_fecx98l,"$15.50 is either decent or extremely mediocre depending on where you live tho. While I was at Macy's I was getting $12-ish/hr in Hawaii while working at their flagship store. $12/hr (even with me having previous security experience and having been in higher positions) doesn't really go much of anywhere in the Honolulu (almost as bad as NYC). I was  20-21 at the time. Now, at 23, I'm a Sgt (supervisor) for a major security company, in the alarm/camera center for a semi-major East Coast US bank, making 18/hr with 40-80 hours a week depending on what I accept for overtime and I'm actually in a position to do something rather than just standing around all day. I'm also no longer in Hawaii and located in WNY which is super middle-class it hurts. Able to afford my own apt, all bills, food, and basically anything I would want to purchase. In Hawaii, making 18/hr would still net me fuck all. 

The differences between positions for security is insane. There's what I do, there's the guys standing in branches/stores (one of the worst), there's people in office buildings or hotels (varies based on the building but usually pretty good), there's people working concerts/other events (really iffy), people at airports (amazing if you do overnights and are in their parking lots, legit could bring my PS4 and TV to work and play games for 8 hours since nothing happened besides letting plows through when it snowed). It's so massively different it's insane."
kittenkin,fe9ua6s,t3_eo5aav,"I worked at a Best Buy and we were trained endlessly to not stop robbers. Our GM phrased it like “you’re lives are more important than anything in here”. We did occasionally catch shop lifters but honestly it was only our GM who did that and he reasoned that he wasn’t as important as we were. 

I don’t think Best Buy should have fires her but she went against the policies we were trained in a lot. You do not try to catch someone who could be a danger and you do not know who has a concealed weapon so you are trained to assume everyone is a danger."
d7mtg,feaemzn,t1_fe9ua6s,Why do they need a guard then?
Robord,feahf3l,t1_fe9ua6s,"This isn't just Best Buy either. It's a big liability/insurance thing for pretty much every major retailer. Loss Prevention is just meant for keeping track of shrinkage, they aren't supposed to act like town guards in Skyrim."
thisisjustforroastin,feafkyq,t1_feaemzn,presence will stop *most* people.
bbrumlev,feagf1t,t1_feaemzn,"Guards are only to deter casual shoplifters. Just knowing someone has seen you makes most people a lot less likely to steal- thus, greeters at many large retailers. 

It also might make their insurance rates better, but I don't know about that."
kittenkin,feaibeh,t1_feaemzn,I can’t speak for this store but at mine they aren’t actually security guards but are product processing and they all take turns each day covering the door. They’re watching the cameras to alert the GM who would deal with stuff.

2) that’s why like 99% of the stock is locked up or empty boxes at Best Buy
3) have you never been assaulted by one of the blue shirts? We would follow every single customer around attempting to harass you with our help. That’s probably the best deterrent of theft. You buy things to get us to stop helping."

The cashier step in front of the cart and  asked why the receipt was in the car if the man was inside the store. The man immediately ran for the exit and ran towards the parking lot. The cashier made a call to someone in store and she ended being called to the manager's officer. I hoped she was called to write a report and not to be reprimanded."

blitzkrieg9,fe8uyqg,t3_eo5aav,"That's cool and all, but Best Buy is right to fire her. Stopping thieves from robbing a large multinational corporation IS NOT WORTH IT!  Potential lawsuits and injuries are way more significant than the loss of a few hundred dollars in electronics.  

Employees at all large companies are trained not to resist but to call the police instead."
Luguaedos,fe9d5pr,t1_fe8uyqg,"To clarify ""injuries"" can mean anything from a broken arm to getting stabbed. I worked at a BestBuy where the loss prevention person at the door assumed there was a mistake and was reaching to take the bag assuming the person was being cooperative. She got her arm broken by a 20 year old kid who did not give a single fuck. I also saw a supervisor who is over six feet tall and super athletically built who tried to follow someone out the door get a knife pulled on him. The thief did not look back and did not stop walking he realized someone was behind him and he just opened a box cutter and held it out to the side. The message was clear. He did not follow the thief out the door.

Anyone who has the courage to just walk out the door with something stolen likely has the courage to hurt you to ensure they do not get caught. The risk to your personal safety is not worth whatever they took.

This is why BBY has a 0 tolerance policy to this."
Nelson_Universe1218,fe8xs82,t1_fe8uyqg,Sad part is you're not wrong.

Jaderosegrey,feaf9ta,t1_fe9d5pr,"I would only agree with the policy because there might be a risk of some innocent bystander getting hurt (for example if the thief pulls out a gun and ends up shooting someone else).

Otherwise it is only the security person's decision to put themselves at risk."

blitzkrieg9,feajt40,t1_feagb6e,"That sounds good. And as a private citizen you can stop a shop lifter and perform a ""Citizen's Arrest"".  You are also protected by Good Samaritan laws. But as an employee of Best Buy, you are specifically trained that while on the clock you UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES are allowed to forcibly restrain a person for suspected theft. Ever. End of story."
Luguaedos,fe9jzv6,t1_fe9jpno,Why the hell would you risk your life for your job unless your job were to keep other lives out of risk?
Luguaedos,febckcq,t1_feaf9ta,"Except it is not their or your decision. The loss prevention person is there to do a job. She or he is not there to do what they want. They are hired to watch for instances like that, call the police, and act as a witness. You don't do your job in the way you are supposed to, what happens?

Your boss told you not to do the thing, your boss told you there was a zero tolerance policy regarding the thing when you were trained, you did the thing. Managers and coworkers do not want to go home knowing that an employee is dead or in critical condition somewhere because they tried to prevent someone from running off with an XBOX that's probably covered under insurance."
RoboGandalf,fe9li2g,t1_fe9jzv6,"When I started I was a dumb kid and loved the thrill of it and enjoyed fighting thieves and people bigger than me.

Jaderosegrey,febpvq9,t1_febckcq,"Good point. I'm just thinking the policy should not be there in the first place. Of course, you should do the job in the way it has been described to you.

MyModernLife411,feapaj8,t3_eo5aav,"So my thoughts on this. Best buy was right to fire her. AP/LP employees are, often, not trained police officers or investigators. Their job is to observe, gather evidence, and report, that's it. Large companies, such as Best Buy are insured out the butt for this type of petty crap so it's not worth fighting over. Let the police get them."
spugliong,feaaedu,t3_eo5aav,Whatdoes she do for dana now?
MaDJohnson57,fearwug,t3_eo5aav,The eagles need a left guard. She needs to use her hands more. Good strong base. Great stance. Very aggressive at the point of attack. Leans into blocks instead of driving. Finishes plays through the whistle. You cant teach athleticism and attitude and she has tons to spare of both. Good choice early 2nd round
xithbaby,feb0oe2,t3_eo5aav,"I worked for Walmart and currently Walgreens. They fire if you confront thieves. Only managers can do anything and they have to have proof with out a shadow of a doubt the person stole. Even if I psychically see the person steal it’s not enough. They have to watch the video which they never take the time to check. 

People walk out of Walgreens with baskets full of items, not a thing I can do about it. I’ve reported many too. 

When I worked for Walmart, I was a people greeter. I could only tell the person to not come back if they stole. If they sneak past you, oh well. They didn’t want me calling police or anything."

In Arabic typing online that letter is replaced with 3. So it would be 3lla.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayin#Arabic\_%CA%BFayn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayin#Arabic_%CA%BFayn)

It's a letter that English speakers cannot usually pronounce without a lot of practice.

NagsUkulele,fdraov3,t3_emrwal,What a fantastic person
banter_control,fdruvxi,t3_emrwal,If the story is true he is a hero but burns like that dont heal and leave that kind of scars in a couple of days. So something is wrong about this.
wanderer3131,fds9b6s,t1_fdruvxi,That's what I was thinking....
_PINK-FREUD_,fdsfaj9,t1_fdruvxi,Giving him the benefit of the doubt-- could be due to English being his second language.
Drail,fdt9r8h,t1_fdsfaj9,"The meaning of few, several, a couple is a usual slip up from ESL folks. The weird part is that the rest of his comment is fairly well written, just some small grammatical errors.

Always, when I see ""share this to do X!"" I become skeptical. But the overt brotherly love shown is fitting for their culture.

Who knows. I really hope it wasn't just a few days ago, no bandages on a fresh open burn would be concerning."

SteezyAs314,fdsuut4,t1_fdsjabi,It’s crazy we live in a world where managers don’t recognize when someone has worked really hard for them.

HR once gave me hell about it, I just said ""I'm already missing out on 3 days of pay, you expect me to pay a doctor to tell YOU I'm sick too?""

It was dropped there, but that was certainly the start of them getting rid of me.

whocanpickone,fdve2gt,t1_fdudf4w,It varies. Some people get paid sick days / time off. Some part-time & some hourly workers do not.
eloveandapplesauce,fdvqih2,t1_fduwpjo,"It depends on the company... a lot of office jobs specifically do get sick days (or a lump of “paid time off” to be used for vacations or sick days, however needed).

SamaireB,fdunw4y,t3_en011z,"Many years ago when I was 22, I had a part time job while goung to grad school. I'm saying part time, but it was 30 hours a week on top of school. It was at a consulting company, so tons of mobey in the firm. I made an ok amount but obviously not much - enough to make a living, but no real luxuries, which of course at that age was fine.

My boss did some coaching on the side and one day I proofread a document/article for him that he had written on brain and behavior. He made a reference to a particular book and I thought it was fascinating. When I gave him back the doc I told him so. This was around 6.30pm. The next morning, I come to the office and find a gift on my desk, complete with a personal note. He had gone to the bookstore after 7 the night before to buy me that book, simply because I mentioned in passing how interesting I thought the topic was. We're talking about a senior partner here who more or less worked around the clock and was travelling all the time.

I had been invited many times to 250$ lunches and stuff - obviously an insane luxury for a 22-year old student of middle-class background - and even generous birthday gifts from the office were the norm. But somehow getting that book was the most thoughtful gesture from any boss I ever had. A little often goes a very long way and it takes very little to be a decent human being."

When we did my performance analysis, she took off a point because I’m “not always available when teleworking.” Because of that one meeting *she agreed to change*.  
That was the day I polished up my resume and started planning my exit.

Deadrocks,fdp66ug,t1_fdnftcg,My mother used to be a special ed teacher and she taught both me and my sister signs when we were young and we really were able to sign before we could verbally communicate. Weird to watch myself signing in old videos since I don’t remember any of it. Lol
jeffreywls,fdnk9wu,t3_ema6rf,Why can't we just teach everybody sign language as children?  It's not like it would fill up their brains and they couldn't learn to speak.
gurkanboll,fdomci7,t1_fdnk9wu,"I taught my baby simplified sign language because I read about it enabling them to communicate much earlier than with spoken words. We did eat, drink, pee, poo, look. She learned spoken language at a normal age but a lot of words were weird and she didn't seem to be able to locate us by sound. Turns out she had a one-sided hearing disability, which we discovered at the 3 year check-up. Doctors said that the early signing was probably why she had such a normal language development despite her disability."

TanguayX,fdl3ojb,t3_elwcr6,"This is amazing. People at a good vet are some of the best people in the world.

Years ago, my dog went in to have a growth removed from his chin. When he was coming out of anesthesia, he had a seizure and died suddenly. I was obviously devastated, but what really surprised me was their reaction. They were so disturbed that after a while, I was consoling them. They took it HARD. The vet called me and seemed like he was going to cry.

They sent my dog’s body out for an autopsy, which they paid for, to find out what happened, and didn’t charge me for his surgery. It was tragic, but not for one second did I think that they took it lightly or didn’t care what happened to my boy."
letsdancemonkey,fdlfl71,t3_elwcr6,"When my cat was put down a couple years ago, our vets sent a card with a packet of forget-me-not seeds to plant.

Krazykatlady93,fdlu02h,t3_elwcr6,I’m sorry for your loss 💜 I am happy they did this for you. I’ve had a few vets do it but my favorite (if I can call it that. Most cherished? Idk) is when my foster kitten died the vet did this for me along with his footprints. They had never done that before and have never done it again when I’ve lost fosters. due to his illness we couldn’t have his body or ashes so the footprints were the best thing to ever receive in the mail
OhioMegi,fdlz0b6,t3_elwcr6,"It’s so hard to lose a pet. My vet sends cards and it’s very nice.  My last cat Millie even had her paw print.  

General question though- why do some people write pet names with quotation marks?"
bluecrush129,fdm22d3,t3_elwcr6,"When my horse died, the vet sent a bouquet of flowers."
Reggaemylitis250,fdm4p2f,t3_elwcr6,"My sympathies, OP. I had to put my kitten Allan to sleep two months ago and my heart is broken.  My vet sent me a beautiful card with all the staff that were there when I had to say goodbye. It was a very kind gesture and it was nice to know they loved him too and understood how hard it was to let him go. I was on Reddit and stumbled upon this comment, so I’ll pass it along. It wrote it out and have it stuck to my wall for the really difficult moments:

“When you put down a pet, you are taking away their pain and making it your own. And that is one of the most selfless, loving things you can do for another creature. That alone is proof that your pet had the absolute best life and best owner that they could have had.” 

Take care of yourself, OP."

sammi-blue,fdm8f2a,t3_elwcr6,"Sorry for your loss. We had to put one of my cats down a little over a year ago (she was old and very skinny, we could tell that she wasn't very happy anymore), and another one of my cats ran away in Juneish and there hasn't been a trace of him since... My dog is getting old as well, and while I think he's still got a while to go I know that it's mostly downhill from here. Losing a pet fucking sucks and it's something you never quite get over. The best thing to remember is that she's in a better place now and that you probably gave her an amazing life."
Gucci-Croccs,fdmb4i6,t1_fdm8f2a,I appreciate the kind words friend. Give a hug to the ole pup for me! It’s crazy how fast time goes with them. They may only be there for 12-16 years of ours lives but we were there whole life. They treasure every moment with us and we cherish every moment with them. Have a good night friend.

I like to think that most people are good and conscious of the world around them, just most of them are ignorant to the effects their actions have on the world around them. See your environment and paying attention to your environment is very different and I think we’re getting better and better at it, but you can’t gauge our level of progress by videos on the internet because they don’t give a real perspective of how much this is actually happening. Being clear, it would be great if animals never got caught in our trash, but I’d venture to guess that fewer animals get caught in trash now, than they did 10 years ago.

BlueStoneArt,fdjecl7,t1_fdicr0q,"In the kindest way, as someone who used to work with the homeless, most homeless have income.  They have welfare, food stamps, disability, or even VA benefits.

The lack of income is not the issue that is facing the homeless community. It is multi layered.

The biggest issue is that land owners eliminated all the low cost housing that was occupied by this population. Single room occupancy hotels were common on Skid Row and served a purpose of providing housing to them for very cheap. For $20/night or $200/month (whichever) a person had a room, a bathroom, and the ability to refrigerate food and cook a bit.

ALL of that housing is gone. All of it.

The answer is not more free stuff.  The answer is building housing, not shelters (which are horrible places that most homeless avoid). HOUSING.  And not FREE housing either.  Free means it will be ruined. Housing that is very low cost and doesn't require background checks and great credit.  Just a room. It's all they need.

The tinyhouses that everyone is so hot for, hated by the homeless. It's a tent with a lock. Flimsy lock. No heat. No plumbing. No electicity. No ability to cook. No refrigeration. No Windows even.

But the tiny houses make liberals feel super good and like they are doing something.

Anyway, just thought I'd share since you werent aware that it is a very rare homeless person that has NO income.  Some (emphasis on some) who panhandle make over $30k a year, tax free. That is the truth. Most who panhandle will make $100 a day fairly easy and more if in the right spot. Tax free."

Summer has always meant thunderstorms, but in recent years, the storms still come but bring little to no rain with them. Tinder-dry bushland + lightning strikes + no rain immediately following = bushfire crisis.

So yes, there was some arson (people who do this are assholes), but it was only a handful of cases, as opposed to the almost 100 cases of lightning strikes or an accidental fire (such as one caused by a car crash and the cars catching alight, spreading to nearby bushland, etc)."

-Maj-,fdkmiz3,t1_fdid7jz,Thank you.  That’s a really heartwarming story.
hannakengu,fdjd5tl,t3_eljv93,"I wish I could do something like this. I’m currently recruiting for an entry-level position at my company and got a bunch of really bad applications from who I can reasonably assume are Syrian refugees. I would love to teach them how to apply for jobs and help them  find suitable jobs, and my hear breaks that I have to refuse them for the job we have (it requires very fluent written language skills which they clearly don’t have). I can’t even reach out and offer help because the applications are literally so bad they don’t have contact information."
bawng,fdjsxdr,t1_fdjd5tl,"To build on what the other commenter said, ask your boss if you could actually start some little program officially within the company. It doesn't have to be much, just a little leaflet or something with information and phone numbers that could be relevant for refugees.

It'd be great PR for any company."
Meewol,fdjpl5z,t1_fdjd5tl,"Is there help and support for them that you do know of? 
You could potentially include in your ad for “Refugees enquire within”. 
Give them information on where they can apply for benefits, housing support, free medical aid, translators and charity teaching English classes. 

These are examples, I don’t pretend to know the support in your area. Perhaps there’s none. But I’m saying that you don’t have to give someone a job to give them support. Sharing your information of this new and scary area they’ve found themselves in could be a massive help as well as a welcoming gesture."
GnawingOnAPickle,fdm8vn2,t1_fdjd5tl,"Keep doing what your doing man, your the person we all meed!"
hannakengu,fdjtynt,t1_fdjsxdr,"I wish my company was big enough to do that, but I don’t think we have the resources..."
hannakengu,fdjtpfm,t1_fdjpl5z,"Singling out a group of people, especially one of obviously different nationality or ethnicity, in a job ad would be illegal af in my country. I think the only reasonable option I have is to volunteer at shelters/help organizations or find a way to befriend/create a personal relationship with refugees to help them. There are big help programs, but it’s often very institutionalized, bureaucratic and faceless."
Meewol,fdjw3dl,t1_fdjtpfm,"Very good point, I think I misspoke my point before. 


To those wanting to help you should include a separate sign to encourage refugees in to get the support or advice you have to offer. 
I forget that it can be a difficult subject to traverse in some places because it’s so common where I live. Most places have a separate notice directed at the different types of refugees we have here. It’s in banks, GP’s, grocery stores, housing agents, churches, and tons of other places that I don’t even register any more. They often provide a lot of the advice I suggested in my original comment or else information on where to find the help they’re looking for."

Top_hat_owl,fdk35yw,t3_elrpeb,This dude is amazing but it still makes me depressed that he has to since the government or organisations can't/won't help
Mnstrdg,fdkaodu,t1_fdk35yw,Homelessness has so many factors. It's rare that the lack of housing is the cause.
Top_hat_owl,fdkdh5t,t1_fdkaodu,"True, but better social help, more job programmes etc would help prevent people from having to sleep on the street. Plus, more low rent housing wouldn't be a *bad* thing tbh"
Wyliecoyote22,fdlx3po,t1_fdkaodu,"One of the best proven solutions to homeless is actually providing the homeless with a home. Food, shelter, clothing are the 3 basic human needs. Without one or multiple of those needs being met people are more likely to experience addiction, suffer from mental health problems like depression, and participate in criminal activity. By providing someone with one or more of those needs their life will generally greatly improve. With a permanent address people can apply for a license. With a license they can get a job. With a job they can get health insurance. With health insurance they can see a mental health professional. It wouldn’t help every single person and you can’t help people who don’t want to be helped, but the fact is very few of the homeless want to be homeless."
dwntwndnvr,fdkm0vm,t1_fdkdh5t,"In Denver where I live, there so much help out there for our homeless, but it scattered all over the city!  And since they won't allow them on the trains and busses with their carts and other belongings, they can't get to them.  They also require a current ID's.  To get one, you need a current address. They are homeless...it's an awful catch 22"
Top_hat_owl,fdkq1ho,t1_fdkm0vm,"It's such a complex issue, one of those ones that probably can't be ""solved"" but they really do need to give whatever systems they have an overhaul. Also hostile architecture is the worst, whether it's for people or birds"

IzzyDane,fdq9dbx,t3_elrpeb,"Years ago I read a story about a mobile van/shower unit that traveled around the city giving homeless a chance for a hot shower. I think it was in the bay area in CA. Such a great idea. People may want to better themselves, but once one is down so low it's hard. Maybe getting that chance to take a shower, brush their teeth, & get clean clothes, it could give someone the opportunity to apply for a job. If that's what they want to do."

The subway platform at Dundas station was packed with commuters  like any typical Wednesday when John Paul Attard noticed a man walk by  and then lower himself onto the tracks.

Attard, a Toronto  Transit Commission collector, says his intuition kicked into gear  immediately. Within seconds, he had the TTC cut power to the station \[and\]  called transit control. Amid all the bustle, he quietly sat down at the edge of the platform and looked into the man's eyes.

""I said to him, 'Are you having a bad day?'"" Attard said. ""He  says, 'Yes, I want to hurt myself.' That's when I just kind of embraced  him and hugged him."""

I agree that people can often get a little too upset and maybe throw an unwarranted hissy fit at times about things when political correctness is taken too far, but I also think that it’s important to consider the context of what is happening and not let that reaction negate what the root of the problem may be."

OwnTheInterTubes,fdkfxy4,t3_elvfya,"We adopted Flash from our local shelter about five months ago. We used to have a dog who died of old age and it took me a while to get over him. Flash was a bundle of love and joy. We got him around the same time I lost my dad and Flash helped me through my grief. He was loved by everyone who came across his way. We had kids of our friends sob in grief when they heard that Flash had been killed in front of our driveway. He loved visiting our neighbors yard and was walking back across when it happened. My wife and kids were right there watching him and could not stop the car in time because of the speed. It hit us hard and we still think about it every day. I had an autoship order with [Chewy.com](https://Chewy.com). Last week I spoke to them about canceling the order. Danielle was so kind. And yesterday, I found a box of flowers waiting on our doorstep. I had a hard time controlling my tears. My company, one of the most well recognized brands in the world, did not send us flowers when my dad passed away. But Chewy does this for a dog who will bring them no more business. Just wanted to share my appreciation for their thoughtfulness and kindness.

Vortesian,fdnqrmk,t3_emb2y1,"Jazz musician here. I’ve worked with two blind pianists in my life. Both blind from birth. Both had amazing aural and memory skills better than most sighted players. 

I was working one night at a big restaurant. You’d call it a residency now but we just called it a steady gig lol. Anyway we knew all the waiters. After we finished a tune Alan was thinking of the next tune so I just sat there looking at him, waiting. It was a full dining room and all I could hear was the sound of a hundred conversations. Then Alan laughed and said that waiter 1 and waiter 2 were laughing at some other waiter who wasn’t there. There were like ten servers working that night. 

Ok, so I didn’t even notice these two waiters, who were standing a good ways away. I look over at them but couldn’t hear their voices at all over the talking and eating noises of the diners. 

So here’s the kicker. Alan is a good ten years older than I am and has the normal amount of musician hearing loss from playing a ton of gigs with loud drummers in his life. So even with his reduced acuity, he could still discern their conversation."

> Lifting fines has had a surprising dual effect: More patrons are returning to the library, with their late materials in hand. Chicago saw a 240% increase in return of materials within three weeks of implementing its fine-free policy last month. The library system also had 400 more card renewals compared with that time last year.

> ""It became clear to us that there were families that couldn't afford to pay the fines and therefore couldn't return the materials, so then we just lost them as patrons altogether,"" said Andrea Telli, the city's library commissioner. ""We wanted our materials back, and more importantly, we wanted our patrons back.""

> The Chicago Public Library started looking at data that showed socioeconomic disparities within its system. Telli said low-income communities had more overdue fines than some of the more affluent neighborhoods of Chicago. It wasn't that Chicagoans in poorer areas were necessarily racking up more fines, she said, but rather, those patrons were unable to pay the overdue balances.

> According to Chicago Public Library's internal analysis, some 30% of people living on the South Side of Chicago couldn't check out materials because they had reached the $10 fine limit for overdue materials. That ratio, however, dropped roughly 15% among cardholders on the more affluent North Side. Nearly a quarter of blocked accounts belonged to children under 14.

> Having library fines stand in the way of people searching for jobs and social services ""just seemed counterintuitive to us,"" Telli said."

Xoshi7,fdhy81l,t1_fdgsjx2,"On the other hand, people with over due books don't bother to return them because they can't afford the fines, with fines on your account you can't rent more books, so why bother making a trip to the library to return the book.

Everyday_Hero1,fdlqlfx,t1_fdlpr4b,I'll never find a more noble reason to snort a fat line.

MySpotInTheStars,fdnub4g,t3_em1gl7,I don't think bolstering addiction and profiting from it while donating 10% is really what I'd call being a bro
YesImaBanker,fdodyn5,t1_fdnub4g,hes helping in the ways that he can
MySpotInTheStars,fdoj9c6,t1_fdodyn5,"Hes dealing crack, Come on man, profiteering off addiction and a national tragedy is not a bro, is the bar really that low for you?

This is like praising a sex trafficker because for every girl sold 5 bucks goes to charity. Seriously come on bro"
Everyday_Hero1,fdpnq1r,t1_fdoj9c6,comparing willing use of a high cost party drug to the sale of a human slave is a bit of a leap buddy.
Everyday_Hero1,fdpnky6,t1_fdphgem,"Exactly, this is no different to any other business having a ""X amount of sales goes to charity"" sale.  
He has a product to sell, and a client base to sell that product to, so either way the sale of the coke is going to happen regardless.  
So for him to say Im gonna put 10% towards charity, without raising his prices, I would call that a bro move because he is giving away his a good portion of his profit on the sale to charity when he doesn't have to at all."
Everyday_Hero1,fdt1zrt,t1_fdrtl66,"You judge your fellow human how ever you want my friend, at least they put money towards something needed."
GMD463,fe0ftry,t1_fdrtl66,I hate this idea that is pushed where everyone blames the dealer and not the user. He didnt force those people to come to him and force them to use the drug. They chose to do it. Yes drugs are powerfull but in the end the user made the chose and does so every time they use. Tons of stories of people getting clean because they chose to do so proves this.

BrightBluePajamas,fdjc2zc,t3_elnvvk,What are some of the projects the foundation has done?
geldersekifuzuli,fdje8b1,t1_fdjc2zc,"I am definitely not the most knowledgable person about their all projects. I am a Turk living in the US. Here is as I know:

&#x200B;

In some cases, people are reaching Haluk Levent on twitter. Ahbap, the charity foundation, has brach in almost all cities. (You can check his twitter, lots of posting and pictures he tagged). Haluk Levent asks volunteers in that city to investigate the case. After the investigation is done, if it's a small amount like $500, then Ahbap pays for it. This money comes from donations and Haluk Levent himself. If there is a serious amount of money is needed such as over $10k, then Haluk Levent says on twitter ""whoever pays for this expense, I will sing for him/her personally, cook for them"" etc. This is the most mediatic, visible thing that this charity foundation is done. But, there are lots of big things they are doing and hard to see because they aren't happening on social media much.

&#x200B;

But here are a few organized projects I know:

* Providing a scholarship for students
* Planting tree
* Helping animals
* Helping families in need

Here are various examples what Haluk Levent and Ahbap have done:

* There was a big wildfire in Turkey. He organized a charity concert for planting new trees. Around 5 more bigshot Turkish stars joined him.
* A student missed the national exam which is held once a year. He found a sponsor for this student's one-year education expense.
* Found a sponsor for a young boy's prosthetic leg expense. So, now he can walk.
* A poor artisan lost his shop in a fire. He renewed his entire shop and gave him the ability to continue to work."

geldersekifuzuli,fdj5kij,t3_elnvvk,There are lots of things to say about this guy. Here is his twitter account. It's worth seeing:[https://twitter.com/haluklevent](https://twitter.com/haluklevent) (despite it's Turkish)
