winniesmom123,fdh5wog,t1_fdg2bgw,I want one of those beds for myself!!
Ebox3rchamp,fdfs0gk,t3_el47gf,Look at that belly..aww soooo cute. I’ve got a corgi/border collie mix but she’s old 8+ lol. She’s like a little pig with her legs. She’s the best dog I’ve ever had. She’s sooo sweet and smart. She’s adapted to every situation in our household like an awesome person would. Even though she’s older she such a good baby. 💛
trock21hug,fdfs6e5,t1_fdfs0gk,Awwwwwwww❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
EEUU09,fdfnrtt,t3_el47gf,The fact that this only has one upvote after an hour is a crime

ClosetGangsta,fdrdq56,t1_fdr9k76,"Thank you! He’s adjusting really well; mostly sleeping so far though. Lol. His bed is 10x bigger than he is, but he loves it."
athanathios,fdrfj0a,t1_fdrdq56,"That's great and the opposite of my baby, she had FOMO and never rested and was always up! She now has a nice big crate she LOVES at 4 years old. Have the BEST time with your baby!"
thisnolelovespups,fdrow11,t3_emut4m,Go Noles! And adorable pup
ClosetGangsta,fdx9t7f,t1_fdrow11,Thank you!
HappyLittleTrees17,fdrpwoj,t3_emut4m,"I have a cattle dog as well and she is just THE BEST. They call them Velcro dogs since they are so loyal and he will be your shadow. One word of advice: take LOTS of videos. I took a lot of pictures of my pup when she was younger, but I wish I had taken more videos."
ClosetGangsta,fdxa8jl,t1_fdrpwoj,He’s so chill I can’t believe it. He’s definitely got an interesting personality already!
bluemeep,fdry5g3,t3_emut4m,"Cutie! Be careful with dingo bones when they're still little, though. The knobs are just the right size to be hazardous if they try to swallow the whole thing at once. We had to do a doggy heimlich because of one of those previously."
ClosetGangsta,fdxawm4,t1_fdry5g3,"Oh wow! He wound up not liking them anyhow, so I guess that’s a good thing."
krnhitokori,fdsksoq,t3_emut4m,Cowboy corgi?
ClosetGangsta,fdsqy6t,t1_fdsksoq,Yes!
silly_booboo,fdvvqt6,t1_fdsksoq,What is a cowboy corgi need to know
krnhitokori,fdtoo2b,t1_fdsqy6t,"omg. 

My girlfriend has a heeler and I have an insatiable love for corgis. 

I've now decided I need a heeler and cowboy corgi in addition to the corgi I will eventually have. 

Please keep us updated!!"
ClosetGangsta,fdx9o1n,t1_fdvvqt6,They’re a cross between a corgi and an Australian Cattle Dog. :) He’s so mild tempered its unreal. He’s perfect!
krnhitokori,fdxmvu7,t1_fdx9o1n,"In addition to this,   


I""m not usually a big fan of people crossbreeding bigger breeds with corgis given the higher risk of issues and larger dog weight on a corgi frame.   


But heelers are already a slender build (to me) and I can't resist those corgi/heeler eyes."
HappyLittleTrees17,fdre98y,t3_emut4m,I love him
ClosetGangsta,fdxb25q,t1_fdre98y,Thank you!
mglatrn,fdsafe7,t3_emut4m,"I love him, what’s his name?"

Farrt1,fe05xs8,t1_fe05nzn,"Georgia, local breeder"
hectorduenas86,fe061va,t1_fe05xs8,"Ohh, I live in South Florida and always heard that most Corgi Breeders were way up North. Do they have a website or anything similar to contact them?"
thegreenestfield,fe0a8dk,t1_fe05xs8,Go Georgia! What part? I'm going to UGA in Athens
Farrt1,fe08jzt,t1_fe061va,PWCCA is where I found my breeder. They sort them by state and you can email or call them
Farrt1,fe0absx,t1_fe0a8dk,Some small town 2 hours east of Atlanta. Well worth the drive
hectorduenas86,fe0955d,t1_fe08jzt,I think it’s the same website I used to look form breeders down here. Supposedly it’s the official organization’s website. Thanks.
