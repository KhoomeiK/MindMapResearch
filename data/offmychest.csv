RTTR91,emaut1,top_level,"She died on her 29th birthday. I am filled with regret.

&#x200B;

We were really good friends in undergrad. Even when I moved to Germany to do a Master's, we were still in touch and talking. Two years later by the time she moved to Germany, we would talk now and then but we were not as close anymore so much so that I never made the effort to go see her. Then I moved to Canada and got busy with work and studies and we would rarely ever talk. My last message to her was last year this time for her birthday. When Facebook sent me a notification for her birthday yesterday, I told myself that I would message her later but deep down I wasn't even sure if I should do it. She was on my mind days before the crash and I keep asking myself why the hell I didn't text her to say hi or to ask her what she is up to.

&#x200B;

What I can't stop thinking about is those minutes after the plane caught on fire; it must have been extremely scary to see the masks fall off and to know you are heading for a crash. I don't know if she burnt to death or if her body got destroyed during the crash. Nobody should have to go through that much fear and pain. While I know that I will accept her loss at some point, I don't know what will happen to her family. They say the worst thing for a parent is to outlive your child.

&#x200B;

I'm oscillating between extremely sad and crying hysterically to feeling nothing and being empty.

&#x200B;

Her death rattled everybody's cage. We all started to call each other up again, talk, cry and sympathize. We all promised each other not to drift apart again and touch base more frequently. I don't know how long that promise is gonna hold but I am going to try my best no to lose friends to distance, work, exams, relationship and etc.

&#x200B;

But hey people let's be kind to one another, take care of each other and value the friendships we once made. Life is too short and you never know when somebody's time is gonna come. Death is always looming around the freaking corner and the only thing we can do is to be there for each other every chance we get.

Edit 1: Thank you everyone for your kind messages. I am deeply sorry that some of you had to lose people in your life that you cared about.

Edit 2:  Thank you for not making this political. We already know that our government shut down the plane which is making the pain so much harder to process."
De5perad0,fdnlgt5,t3_emaut1,"I had a friend that died in the VA tech mass shooting years ago. She was shot by the gunman at point blank in the classroom. I had the same thoughts about how terrified she must have been and how horrible it was.

Az_aval,fdnxzlv,t3_emaut1,"As I was looking through the list yesterday, I suddenly realized I knew a girl on that plane as well. We weren't very close, but her aunt had taken me in for years and I knew her family well. We'd taken some trips together in Tehran.

I kept imagining her typical Iranian goodbyes with the family. All the excitement and pride of her going off to study in Canada. I remember when she had asked me years ago about how the application process works for Canadian universities. She'd finally done it. 

Then I kept imagining the moment her aunt heard, her grandmother, her parents and uncle and all the faces I saw everyday. What it must have done to them, what they're doing now. The crying and wailing and mourning. Sadly, I can't be in touch with them anymore but the whole thing is shaking me up so much and I wish I could be there for them. They haven't left my thoughts.

I hadn't even thought about her final moments, but damn I've made a flight out of IKA so many times.. You settle in for that long flight all excited for what's to come then.. What you described. Goddamn."

adipocerousloaf,fdnjvnv,t3_emaut1,"fuuuuuck. i can somewhat sympathize. when i had lost my mother, i had not seen her for 4 years already. then she was gone about a month after she called to tell me she was dying. not as unexpected and sudden like the great loss of your friend...

my point is: regret can fuck you up EVEN MORE that the loss. it will be hard to let that part go - to not feel so responsible. your entire circle of friends will have to train your minds to not do the ""shoulda coulda woulda"" talks. it is fucking very hard not to go there. do not let the regret stay too long. THAT is the part that haunts if you let it. share stories about her with each other. tell her you love her aloud, with your friends or even by yourself. it feels good to let them know, even if they cannot hear you.

keep you guys heads up. best of luck. it takes a long time if you allow it to, but you are in control of the regret part, not the other way around. hugs all around from me to you and your friend circle."

Sharchomp,fdo6723,t3_emaut1,"OP, I'm really sorry for your loss. 

In May 2019, one of my best friend from college passed away in a road accident. He was 25, engaged to his childhood sweetheart and was a great person. Our last conversation was a few weeks before that and we argued because I had to drop out of a trip that a few college mates had planned. I was pissed at him for not understanding how hard my life was at that point. Then I heard about his passing and it broke me. 

It's tough to pull yourself after something so terrible. But time heals the wounds and even if it isn't the same as it used to be, you should know that it'll be allright. 

This May, my other friend from college (we were a trio) and my dead friend's fiancee are going to go on the trip (the one I had dropped out of) and we will do it for our fallen bro.

Stay strong internet stranger"
jayemadd,fdoany9,t3_emaut1,"I am so sorry for your loss. What you are experiencing is shock, and that is normal. You will process the normal grieving process as everyone does in their unique way. It's entirely normal for people to grow apart because, you don't think that someone you personally know is going to die any second. With it being her birthday, I'm sure she was flooded with a lot of other messages from friends and family, and I'm sure she was surrounded by love. Her last conscious moments were probably rather happy.

As for the scenario of her death? There was no cabin fire or ""faulty wiring"" as the Iranian government was quick to respond; the plane was shot down. Her death was extremely quick if not almost instantaneously. She probably had maybe a split second to realize what was happening, if anything, and therefore did not suffer. 

I lost my dad when I was very young to an armed robbery. He was shot point-blank in the head, and learning that he had probably a second or less to even register what was going on was very comforting to me. It made me realize that even though the situation and scenario looked gruesome as a bystander, to him there was no suffering or fear. 

Hopefully any of these words can be some source of comfort to you."
cokoletmelk,fdnkftq,t3_emaut1,"I am terribly sorry for your loss. Please don‚Äôt blame yourself for the things you didn‚Äôt do.

The night before he got into the accident I was in your shoes, had been thinking about him but hesitated to reach out and ask how he was doing; until it happened, he died in a vehicle accident.

You must feel very heartbroken and devastated, OP. Please know that it‚Äôs not your fault and this too shall pass. Enjoy this grieving period, cherish the moments you had had with her, how lucky you are to have met a person like her.

I hope you feel better soon! *edit: here‚Äôs a virtual hug*

Bruzote,fdonmyi,t3_emaut1,"Sorry for your loss and pain. I had an uncle (my mom's young cousin, actually) perish in a commuter train fire. My whole office and I were eating out together at a tavern with the TV on by the bar. The news team went live with the lead train car engulfed in flame. I wondered the same as you, what was it like for the victims? Half an hour later in the office I got a call that my uncle was in that same train car. I am so glad we were not close, but I still I had to fight any tendency to wonder about what happened in that train car. There is no point in it. Don't do it. You're entitled not to wonder and even obligated to your own health not to think about it. Nothing good will come of it. I had flashes where I would remember the horror of thinking about his fate, but I let them pass without holding them.

After 9/11, countless thousands (millions, even?) wondered about the experiences of the people they saw on TV. If they were like me, this practice caused unnecessary suffering and they learned to be more self-disciplined - even mature - the next time a horror hit. They learned to simply not think about it (which, btw, is not pretending it didn't happen). I also learned to practice that approach while serving with a volunteer first aid squad. You don't get points or get closer to the deceased or serve their memory by wondering about the suffering of victims of terrible events. Once you accept that, you can let it go."

My brother died in a fire and before we knew the details this was what I expected to see in the hospital, terrible 3rd degree burns, the horrible pain that goes with it. But the smoke kills you way before the flames even reach you. It‚Äôs still not a great way to die but much quicker.

I‚Äôm sorry for your loss. Even if you weren‚Äôt that close before it happened. Reach out to the family. Even if it‚Äôs months from now. People tend to forget or just ignore after 3 or 4 months. But the family grieves forever. Sympathy comes hard and fast that first few weeks but you are in shock and numb. Months even years after the fact no one remembers and that is when I wanted to hear from people the most. Just to know people are still thinking of your lost loved one.

Think of the good times and not their final moments. Bring up happy memories or stories they might not ever have heard. It‚Äôs hard. It will always be hard."

It's been three years now and I have come to terms with the fact there was nothing I could have said or done. We ended on good terms and I am so thankful for that.

aoayame,fdoyhhw,t3_emaut1,"One of my friends from work and I were starting to actually hang out more. We were planning to hang out after Christmas, but Christmas Eve was hard. My family is very toxic, and at the time my boyfriend was abusive, so it was hard.

I used to leave work and tell everyone, ""don't die"", but I had been a bit short with her, because her family was wonderful and I was jealous. We were alone in the backroom, and I did apologize, and told her how good she was to deal with me and everyone else being assholes, but I hoped her holiday would be wonderful and better than mine. 

I smiled, and for the first time in months left without saying, ""don't die.""

She was found the next morning dead in bed. The report sound vaguely like suicide, but her doctor had, in my opinion, miss diagnosed pneumonia, and he was friends with the coroner, so was marked as an unknown reason for a 26 year old to die in her sleep.

 I still think about it often. It's been almost 10 years. I wish I could have done something, or texted her later to check in on her since I know she got home closer to midnight, but I didn't.

I'm still friends with some other ex co-workers, and we often hang out, but we don't really talk about Erin very much, and if we do, it's still like she is just a friend you have not seen in ages."

There isn't anything that I could possibly say to make the process of grief easier. When my best friend died on the operating table I often felt guilty talking about her to others out of fear that it would look like I was ""stealing"" the grief from her family who were in deep pain and suffering. I tried to appear strong and stoic and support them, but I found out that talking about it is extremely important and I hope you are finding that comfort in talking to your friends. In any tragedy there is a bittersweet reality check that grounds people and makes them remember what matters in life.

She is not in pain at this moment, surprisingly...yoga helped me to rationalize this a bit better... but you will find yourself constantly thinking about her pain, and her fear, and you will feel guilt for no reason. The emotions come in waves and sometimes its anger and other times its apathy, lean into it, and stare at it, don't bury it... and make sure to visit a therapist if it feels a little too overwhelming for you hun.

Take care."
exceive,fdnv11u,t1_fdnhtf0,"As a person who has lost a daughter and a brother (10 and 5 years ago respectively) I second YYCchatterbox's comment.  

People talking to me about those I have lost does not hurt me as it would seem it should. Not in the first days, not later. It is very comforting to me when someone shares an anecdote. Often it is a glimpse of a part of my daughter or brother's life that I wasn't there for, which makes it sort of one more moment of being together.  

Weirdly random things used to hurt. Right after my daughter died, I was at an event where somebody received an award that she had received and had been proud of, and I had to leave. It wasn't the kind of award that is held by one person at a time or anything where this other person's receiving it diminished my daughter in any way, it was just... random.  

Oh, yeah - not random things: cliche platitudes about ""a better place"" and similar trite nonsense caused me internal rage.  Don't do that.  If you can't think of something real to say, silence is a kind and acceptable option.   

My point is, you never know what will set a grieving person off. Go ahead and talk about the person who is gone - maybe ask first. And as long as you are there with kind intent and paying attention to the grieving person's expressions, their pain is not your fault."

You were a friend of hers for a long time, and that undoubtedly had an impact. That goes the other way too. You may not have talked to her recently, but she was on your mind, and everything she ever did and told you influenced how you think today.

I think it might help to think less about how she is gone, and more about how she lives on in you, in your memories and in your own personality.  The best thing you can do is share some of that with others, so they know just how special she was."

My grandmother passed away two days ago, the became extremely ill this past friday with her heart giving up and fluids in her lungs. The entire extended family watched over her in the hospital, we are (not including partners) around 40 in the family and very close. This had happened before though and she always lived through it and got better so a lot of people were not ready to give up even though the doctors told us there was no hope. My younger sister was also pregnant and her and my grandmother shared the same birthday (october 22‚Äônd) so my mom had been saying that she was certain that she would give birth the same time my grandmother would die (she‚Äôs due on jan 19‚Äôth). 
Well, on tuesday night she finally passed just before 10pm, with around 20 of us sitting with her, it happened peacefully but obviously there were a lot of tears and hugs, I saw my mother cry for the first time. On our way home it was 5 min past midnight and my sister commented that my mom had been wrong since she was 5 min too late. Lo and behold my sister goes into labour and just before 10am gives birth to a healthy baby girl. 10pm is also 22:00, my grandmother died around that time and 12 hours later my sister gives birth.. their birthday is 22.10. The entire family is spiritual and we all like to think my grandmother was reborn as my sisters daughter. And if nothing else, the birth brings a tiny bit of joy into a very sad time for us."

I lost my mom, not unexpectedly, this year and I've been trying to make a point of reaching out to people whenever I think of them or something reminds me of them.  They don't have to know it's because I lost someone, but it's just so I can tell the people I care about that I indeed care about them.  You can't reconnect with your lost friend, but you may find a lot of peace and beauty coming from your reaction to her passing.

They died along with their two little girls, returning after a visit to see family over the winter break. 

We are completely bereft, and reeling in shock.

The idea that they were killed by a missile is horrifying. That it was an incident edging on an act of war is simply unthinkable.

I did not have to go through the extreme horror of hearing about it while it was still in the NEWS and everybody was denying responsibility. I was forced to look at the BIG picture. (I do not believe in God. Otherwise it was his planning and responsibility. He could have stopped it but did not. And he knew it would happen because he is The Supreme Being.) So. It happened and still think about her. I remember how she was and the philosophy she espoused.) I pay it forward. I will help others, in her name. Her goodness is given to others.

Svataben,fdmywr4,t3_elxt3x,"Yeah, so as per usual, this kind of thread brings out all the worst creeps, invalidators, victim blamers, sexism against men (I'll get to that below), and really inappropriate jokers.

The ban-hammer is wearing down from all the shit I've dealt with in this thread.

---

Let me remind you all of the fact that sub rules are in effect.

Also, I'm going to specify:

- This is a thread on a specific topic. Trying to derail with ""*But what about women mistaking friendliness for hitting on them???*"" is not what it's about.   
- The fact that you're having a hard time getting laid, is not an excuse for hitting on women in inappropriate contexts, including the work place.  
- This is a serious thread about a serious topic. Your jokes are not funny, but they are violating rule #1. Guess what happens to a lot of people who violate that rule. Guess...   
- When you excuse away men's sexually harassing behaviour as somehow inevitable, you're being sexist against men. Men *can* control themselves, and most men *do* do that.   
- Victim blaming gets a fool banned. It is not the victim's fault that someone chooses to be inappropriate. Being desperate, lonely, whatever is not an excuse.  
- Do not fall pray to the myth of the bumbling male. Faaaaaaaaaar the most of these guys are perfectly socially capable, and manage to be just fine around everyone except the person they want to sexually harass. And those who are excusing their behaviour with loneliness or whatever are *choosing* to use that as an excuse, which is not ok.   
- To the guys who feel like they're the victims, because they're now afraid to hit on women because they might be seen as creeps (and to the guys who want to meet new people regardless of gender): You're bothered because you're scared of being slightly inconvenienced/limited/not liked. These women fear being attacked. And this thread is not about you. Consider for a second that you should also be blaming the creeps for their chosen behaviour and the consequences.

Edit: And we moderate for gendered slurs, including various forms of ""bitch"". That sets of auto-mod, even if *'ed out. I have approved a few who were quoting what they got called by others, but avoid using them if you want people to see your post."
curlyq0131,fdli99x,t3_elxt3x,"I had so many guys come to my work and hit on me and I'm just supposed to be polite.

Hes talking to me about his family, I finally say ""is your wife okay with you talking to women like this"" his response ""my wife and I have an open arrangement"" ""my husband and I dont, please leave"" haven't seen him since, thank God."

I obviously didn‚Äôt call, but I told my managers and people started walking me to my car. It was odd. How he knew it was my car, I still have no clue.

Edit: it was also part of my job description to make small talk with the customers as they waited so to make it seem more like a connected community. So I was just picking something to say to be nice as he waited for me to bag his groceries.

Edit: some spelling"
matthewrodierphotos,fdmnk6m,t1_fdli99x,"As a man I've always thought it's a good policy to not hit on women that have a job where they have to be nice to strangers.

monster-baiter,fdms7pc,t1_fdmpx6u,"yea the topic of men feeling invisible and never ever getting complimented comes up on reddit every now and then but i always think, well women would love to give out more compliments if more men could take it in a non-creepy way! i dont have this problem where i live but when i was in the US i learned damn quick to not casually talk to a dude and not even make eye contact or id be stopped, talked to endlessly or harassed 10 times a day (and even with headphones on and looking down on the floor id still get talked to or harassed a lot). i wouldnt think of giving out compliment in that kind of environment. men in my country have definitely have a much more casual tone with women thank god!"
DoctorCaptainSpacey,fdnrq4u,t1_fdmpx6u,"I had a guy at work once apologize BEFORE complimenting my dress bc of shit like this.

Like, he wasn't being crude or gross or even complimenting ME persay. He just wanted to say my dress was lovely. He didn't say anything that would even remotely be harassing or weird. Just a nice compliment from one human to another. But he still started off with ""I hope you don't take this the wrong way"".

Even a man should be able to say a woman's dress is nice without anyone jumping to him harassing her. He's not over there telling me I'm hot or he'd ""hit that"" or something gross."
matahdatah,fdnedmn,t1_fdndlk9,Rape and domestic violence (stalking is a behavior of domestic abuse) are about power. Men that push women after she says ‚Äúno‚Äù can‚Äôt handle a woman taking power over their bodies. I hope you are very happy with your child.
TriceratopsWrex,fdmu45y,t1_fdms7pc,"I think it's a self-perpetuating cycle. 

Men think women are interested in them because we usually only get compliments from family and significant others, and women don't give compliments because it's seen as interest when they do."

Just because someone (accidentally or not) makes eye contact with you or looks at you, doesn't mean they want you to approach them / speak to them / call after them.

Just because someone exchanges pleasantries with you, doesn't mean they're interested in you in any way, shape or form.

Dead_before_dessert,fdlufmj,t1_fdlsrhk," Not OP, but I understand that your curiosity is coming from a good place. 

Let me put it this way... I have been overweight. I've had terrible dye jobs. I've been in amazing shape with my hair and makeup on point.  My level of attractiveness has fluctuated wildly in the last decade and it has honestly never made much of a difference in the ""attention"" I get from random men.  

If anything, when I look better I get harassed *less*.... possibly due to attractive woman being inherently intimidating, possibly from a difference in my confidence when I feel like I look good.

I can tell you with 100% certainty though that I've never been able to take random attention on the street to mean ""you're attractive"". 

Sometimes it's a guy trying awkwardly to give you a genuine compliment but you can usually tell what's going on there. 

A LOT of the time men who are aggressively following you, invading your space, or just generally harassing you, aren't legitimately hitting on you or trying to compliment you.  They're getting off on the fact that they're making you feel uncomfortable and small.  A lot of times the fact that you are meek, young, unassuming, and unlikely to cause a scene makes you a more likely target... your level of ""hotness"" doesn't really seem to come into play."
tartancushion,fdlt0xs,t1_fdlsrhk,"All women experience harassment, regardless of what they look like."
redlion_29,fdmevx0,t1_fdlsrhk,"I'll reiterate with emphasis, because it's critically important: *ALL* women regularly experience this kind of harassment,  regardless of what they look like or how they dress.  

There's no trade-off or choice to make, not even hypothetically.  In fact,  I'd say women who may be conventionally ""less attractive"" may possibly experience it more frequently, because guys somehow either feel emboldened or like they're doing her a favor.  

Whether I'm in the country, the suburbs,  or near my office in busy downtown,  I am constantly monitoring those around me and feel vulnerable. I have been cat-called, followed, and propositioned forcefully in all these places - literally on my own damn driveway, talk about feeling vulnerable - dressed in sweats or professionally.  This has happened to me consistently since I was 11 years old (wtf!?), through my 20s when I was more conventionally attractive... and continues now that I'm basically a chubby middle-aged mom.  

The fact that women continue to need to explain these facts in threads/ conversations/ media/ litigation... and that there are still men who just don't GET what their female friends/coworkers/ partners/ daughters/ sisters/ mothers/ hell, even GRANDMOTHERS face literally every week... it only further demonstrates why the disrespect continues.  Women can voice this till we're dead -- but only if & until men rebuke their peers consistently and urgently for crass, disrespectful, and yes threatening behavior, this will continue to be the reality of women in modern society."
dumbguts,fdlun19,t1_fdlsrhk,"I know this is hypothetical, but there are actually women and men out there that *make themselves look less attractive* just to avoid the assault of all kinds already. No one would trade attractiveness for unattractiveness I don't think, because how you look is...how you look. Often you can't do anything about it. What needs to stop are people (men AND women) that think it's okay to assault someone that's minding their own business. We live in a world where some can't feel good about themselves and look attractive because of the disgusting people that assault."
agkldfjlfsdjfl,fdlu5s5,t1_fdlsrhk,"The girls who get targeted the most are the ones who seem shy, or like they won't retaliate (by yelling or whatever).  That's why pre-teen and young-teen girls get catcalled so much.  It started for me around 11 (and peaked around 16), which is when it starts for most girls.

Being attractive isn't nearly as much of a factor.

Edit:  I'll add, though, that skinny girls get catcalled more, so your body *does* matter.  Usually when a guy catcalls he's far away, or when he assaults you (like groping in a club) he's behind you or it's dark.  So what your face looks like doesn't matter-- the guy doesn't even see it.

Edit 2: To (I guess) answer your question as much as possible, I'm glad I'm thin.  But that's for a million different reasons, and the negative male attention doesn't really factor in.

However, many girls who are sexually abused as children try to make themselves as unattractive as possible (with hygiene, weight, clothing etc).  I don't think it makes much of a difference in whether they'll keep being abused, but yes, some women who go through severe trauma choose to be unattractive to try to avoid it.

Edit 3: (hopefully the last) Also, my thoughts about my own looks/attractiveness don't center around men as much as your comment suggests.  I like doing my makeup, wearing nice clothes etc. more because of other women, not men.  If women were dressing for men we'd all look like strippers all the time (or those instagram girls with only male followers).

I eat healthy and do yoga mostly for my own mental health and confidence.  Again, not to be attractive for men.  Your comment seems very 'man-centric'.

Edit 4: Ok, I had one more thought.  A man catcalling a woman on the street (""hey sexy"") is very similar to a high school bully (""hey fugly"").  In both cases, they're not targeting someone because they're attractive or unattractive.  They're just doing it because they're insecure assholes who want to feel 'tough', and they target the people they think won't stand up for themselves.

I'm guessing that bullies and catcallers are mostly the same people, too."

All you want to do when you meet someone is list your accolades, show off how cool you are etc. to the point that that isnt you at all. Basically right now random interactions with people is so fucked from beginning to end, that you just stare at your phone now a days so hard you don't even see whats in front of you anymore, literally. 

I know I got on a tangent but for all those dudes like me who know that randomly approaching a woman out of left field just isnt the way: The organic you comes out when you shut out all the noise and give yourself time to make your own decisions about who you are, what you like and what you wish to stand for. This is the only way you be truly happy, and true happiness radiating off you I would say is the best way to attract someone. People love to be around people who are so themselves you can literally tell they don't hear the noise. They will enrich your life, man or woman, and this is definitely a prerequisite to being in a relationship you think you'd actually want to be in.

norbat,fdmuglz,t1_fdlg25g,"I SO understand where you‚Äôre coming from here, and I know I (a woman) sometimes think I‚Äôm being obvious when I‚Äôm really not. I may have a solution for this conundrum though - if you‚Äôre not sure if someone is flirting or just being friendly, give them your number and say ‚Äúdo with it what you will‚Äù/‚Äúgive me a call if you want‚Äù (in a friendly way ofc). That way, both of you kind of have to initiate contact, and I, at least, wouldn‚Äôt think any the less of you if I wasn‚Äôt interested, or feel threatened (so long as you didn‚Äôt keep badgering me about it if I didn‚Äôt contact you, but I think that goes without saying for you)"
Reachingout365,fdly153,t1_fdlg25g,I would continue to do what you're doing. No need to assume anything else.
KxngTxna,fdlltla,t1_fdll3hx,"As a cashier I make conversation with my regulars... it makes my day and their day better.. it doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that I‚Äôm interested. If you do ask her out, don‚Äôt make it awkward if she says no, take it in stride!"
WingsofRain,fdlod1n,t1_fdll3hx,"Okay look, if you‚Äôre interested and you think she might be interested, then **politely** ask her out. If she says no, then respect that and back off. There‚Äôs nothing to fear as long as you treat her like a human being and respect her boundaries.

This PSA has been brought to you by your local female."
LaMadreDelCantante,fdm9j1p,t1_fdll3hx,"Its generally not cool to ask someone out at their work, where they HAVE to be nice to you.  I know that can be frustrating,  but there it is.  

Thinking back to when I worked retail, I MIGHT have been okay with a guy mentioning his plans for the weekend and saying, hey,  you should come to X and hang out if you want. Not like a date, like to join in on plans you have whether I show up or not.  And accept no or maybe as an answer without pushing.  Then if she shows up and you get along,  maybe ask her out there, away from work.  If she doesn't show and doesn't say anything about it next time you see her, let it go. That's about the most non-creepy way to see if she might be interested."
throwaway92715,fdlo3gb,t1_fdll3hx,"Well... to be fair... I think there are plenty of scenarios where they *actually are* attracted to you, which is what might make it so confusing.  I've actually asked out a few cashiers who have been really friendly and gotten their numbers and gone on dates with them.  And we didn't have any kind of overtly sexual flirting or whatever, because frankly I don't do that and neither do a lot of women, we just had a friendly conversation with a little blushing and some dodgy eye contact.

So.  I think the important part (as always) is just to be kind and respect others' boundaries.  Unless there's some social barrier like they're married to your brother, there's nothing wrong with asking someone out after you've had a friendly conversation.  Just... you know... don't go too far, and if they say no, accept it."
buhlot,fdm7xzq,t1_fdll3hx,"I used to frequent a Sbux every day before work and there was one cashier who kept comping my drink and starting convos... in the drive-thru.

She was cute, but in the off chance that she was just being nice, I *did not* wanna be **that guy** who has to find another Sbux drive-thru for my morning coffee."
Venricht,fdlq3kr,t1_fdll3hx,"The painful reality is they will always assume that if you ask her out or w/e, that you HAVE to fuck, date, initiate a romantic relationship.  
Long gone are the days where you could befriend someone this way."

Cues.

For the record too I agree with everything you're saying, and not having seen black mirror yet you make me want to dive into it.

>I know I got on a tangent but for all those dudes like me who know that randomly approaching a woman out of left field just isnt the way: The organic you comes out when you shut out all the noise and give yourself time to make your own decisions about who you are, what you like and what you wish to stand for. This is the only way you be truly happy, and true happiness radiating off you I would say is the best way to attract someone.

Unfortunately that's not the message that is repeated loudest or most often out there. If you want to be happy, you have to be a man, you have to go and get the girl, impress her with how strong/brave/good you are, just keep polishing your game, eventually you'll score with women, then you can sleep with a whole bunch of them and use that to brag and sleep with more of them.

It's a horribly sexist approach, full of toxic gender roles and expectations, but that's closer to what most guys hear than what you said about true happiness. ""True happiness"" for many is not about how you feel about yourself, it's about how often you've scored and how hot the women were, and you just gotta keep trying to pump those numbers up to be even more successful. It's a horribly toxic way to see relationships.

>This is the only way you be truly happy, and true happiness radiating off you I would say is the best way to attract someone.

Yeah but that's gay man. A real guy is just hot and has game so he can sleep with all the women he wants

We need a massive cultural change, and we need it 15 years ago."
Iffycrescent,fdlmij1,t1_fdlltla,"Yeah I don‚Äôt necessarily think she‚Äôs interested in me, but I figured there was no harm in asking.  Good advice though.  Thanks."
Iffycrescent,fdlr6e8,t1_fdlod1n,Yeah absolutely.  The only reason this post took the wind out of my sails is because I really don‚Äôt want to be seen as the guy that OP‚Äôs post was about.  I‚Äôd be mortified lol
Svataben,fdmxfj4,t1_fdlo3gb,"Yes, but then they got to choose the risk of being hit on in the work place, and the risk of being seen as unprofesional by co-workers and bosses.

They had something to lose, and chose to risk it.

You didn't choose for them/force it on them."
marocu,fdloe0f,t1_fdlmij1,It might be awkward going back if she says no

OP‚Äôs mainly referring to those that automatically assume that the woman wants to fuck them simply because they smiled or had a conversation. Or the guys that don‚Äôt take no for an answer. At the end of the day, women just want to be respected. As long as you treat that woman you‚Äôre interested in with respect, I guarantee you she‚Äôll be fine with you asking."
Iffycrescent,fdlq8bl,t1_fdloe0f,Truly though lol.
Iffycrescent,fdlsmhs,t1_fdlsa4r,Cool.  Thanks for the reply.  You honestly made me feel better.
VoiceSC,fdm258f,t1_fdlq8bl,"It's really not.  If you ask her out because you're interested, she says no, you just say ""no worries!"" and act like you always did.  You're not gonna stop going to a store because you applied for a job and didn't get it."
howsadley,fdn2phc,t1_fdlsmhs,"A few people are trying to encourage you to ask the cashier out, but this post is filled with stories by retail workers who DO NOT want to be asked out ‚Äî even respectfully ‚Äî while they are working. They‚Äôre required to be nice to you at work and don‚Äôt feel comfortable forcefully turning down an invitation. It also encroaches on their workplace, where they want to feel safe, have some privacy, and be respected by managers and coworkers. Although you‚Äôre just living life while you‚Äôre in the store, this is their work. I wouldn‚Äôt do it."
Iffycrescent,fdmapx8,t1_fdm258f,"You‚Äôre right.  I was halfway kidding, but also not really."
WingsofRain,fdngem3,t1_fdn2phc,"Said retail workers in the stories were uncomfortable usually because someone that they didn‚Äôt know just came right up and asked them out simply because they made eye contact or smiled or were polite (because you‚Äôre right, that‚Äôs their job). Personally, I wouldn‚Äôt even bother initiating friendly, casual conversation with someone unless I felt a bit comfortable with their presence.

Crescent‚Äôs story tells me that the woman he‚Äôs interested in is comfortable enough to initiate a conversation, then she would likely be comfortable enough for him to ask her out. POLITELY, mind you. While she isn‚Äôt required to say yes or no either way, it won‚Äôt be the end of the world as long as he approaches her in an appropriate manner, and then immediately backs off if she declines. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with asking someone out as long as you respect their boundaries...that‚Äôs what so many of the other women here are angry about."
AceofToons,fdmebxg,t1_fdmapx8,I mentioned above that my best friend started out as someone I asked out and she wasn't interested. So we kept hanging out as friends and now I have the greatest relationship

I get that its not really controllable and ive seen it all so no judgement. But what you CAN control??  Grinning and winking lasciviously at me while you drip pre-cum on my nitrile gloves and making comments like ""I bet a young thing like you ain't never seen one like that before!"" all proud. üôÑ I always purposely mis-interpret it and reply kindly, with a little shoulder pat, ""Its ok, Mr. Jones; no need to be embarrassed around me; the average penis is 4-6 in. hard but PLENTY of men are a bit smaller than that and that's TOTALLY FINE!!!""   with a huge, encouraging, sickly sweet smile.

Compliments like these are also typically pretty safe:

""You're really good at [projects like this/proofreading/ editing...], would you mind helping me out?""  - The key here is to compliment her intelligence or abilities. Hopefully she'll be flattered that you asked for help and as you're working together, you'll start small talking.

They then decided to misinterpret it and then hit my wife up saying I was flirting with everyone.

I was piiiiiiiisssssseeeedddd."
badpandaunicorns,fdls3oh,t3_elxt3x,"THANK YOU! I get people or men who walk up to me all the time and just start trying to get my attention. Like ""hey, hey girl!"" Or my creepiest one was a guy on a very empty bus sit uncomfortably close to me. I literally got up and moved away from him to the nearest woman on the bus on the next stop. 

I have been followed to friends houses, through public spaces and places I didn't even think some one would follow me. By random men who often will follow for a while. 

Here's the thing. You might want to cut into that alley way or dark space thinking   he's gonna stop. He's not. Get to some where where there's cameras, lots of people or in your last case go to the nearest person and start talking with them. I am super paranoid because I've had stalkers and people try to follow me home. 

Seriously I can't do with conflict or danger. I don't look that strong, but I've broken noses and arms. 

Girls seriously take at least one self defense or basic martial art class. One move might save your life. Remember the soft spots. Groin, nose, and eyes are the biggest ones. For my female friends who are a little more tactical. There are knives small enough to be pendants. No they aren't exactly the best defense. But you might be able to cut your attacker just deep enough to get away.

Amazon has one about three entries down that's just perfect enough to fit on a key chain. 

Keep it accessible, keep it near and if all else fails. Scream bloody murder."
tincersgirl,fdmsq8x,t1_fdls3oh,"Just to add, this is great advice, but I‚Äôd never recommend people carrying weapons who are not competent with them or knowing a ‚Äúlittle‚Äù self defence. 

That often turns out far more serious eg you are instantly de armed and they now have a weapon, or you ‚Äúthink‚Äù you are far more skilled than you are and thus do not run when you had the opportunity.

The eyes, posture and assertiveness are your friends...if you are feeling vulnerable make sure you stand/ walk like a soldier, like you own the place.....look the directly in the eyes/ or straight through their eyes...it‚Äôs very uncomfortable for someone who has been presuming you are the weaker person, smile with only your mouth and speak directly at them whilst maintaining the stare.

Alicestar78,fdll3s9,t3_elxt3x,"This right here. I just had a discussion with my SO about how should a woman go about neutrally or without causing a major scene communicate to a strange man that what they have just said or done was completely unnecessary and matter of fact down right rude/insulting/hurtful/creepy ( I could keep going but ..yeah) or maybe in some cases borderline criminal. 
This conversation occurred after an incident I had at a check out register with another male customer. He wanted to be nice and let me go ahead of him, I politely declined, I‚Äôm in no rush, thank you though. His reply was ‚Äú but your cute and I‚Äôm single‚Äù que dumb grin.
This. Ruined. My. Day. 
Why tf was that necessary. He could have said, just wanted to be nice and I would have appreciated the gesture. He could have said nothing and I would have still appreciated the gesture. He could have started talking about the weather and I would have gladly engaged. Instead he made sure to make me feel uncomfortable somewhere .
Sorry for the long rant. Also, my SO said stop being a coward and make a scene. His answer pissed me off but after a lot of thought I realized he is right.

I was nice to one guy and saw him in a reflection just staring at my butt.  As soon as I turned around, he looked up real quick and his face got red before he looked away.   When I stopped being as nice to him, he got angry and rude.

My coworker was asked by one of our most difficult clients if she has a boyfriend. When she said no, he chimed, ""Oh *really*?""  Another said, ""A pretty little thing like you?  You aren't seeing anyone?""

But man some of the things people say and do to try to get in bed with you is insane. Most of it is just a little annoying. When I worked retail it was insanely common. Once had a guy, who visited often, and every time he would tell me how much money he makes (Seriously dude, I live comfortably. Money isn't a winner for me), always wink at me, until it just led up to him just randomly whispering to me how big his dick apparently was. Told him I wasn't interested, and then just thought I was playing hard to get...

Now this other guy that started showing up, I'll have to give him genuine credit. He was smooth. At first just making conversation with me and slowly working to nice flirting. Unfortunately wasn't highly interested, and he took it very well. Even though I don't work there anymore, he'll still hold friendly conversation if we cross paths as customers.

You're nice to someone, make random pleasant chit chat at parties or whatever and even some women will accuse you of flirting. I'm a straight female but have been accused of flirting with females too. I don't understand when being nice suddenly meant you want to get off with them.

So my stop came up, I got out of the train, still listening to music, and as I am walking I see the guy walking really close to me and looking at my phone. I just ignored him but then he started talking to me, I didn't hear him at first, because I had my HEADPHONES on, so in a last effort to avoid the situation I just started walking faster, but this fucking dude grabs my shoulder and continues talking to me. So I take my headphones off, I don't stop walking (I had to switch trains) and he starts asking me for my name and stuff so I tell him my name, I try to be as polite as possible since at this point I was pretty scared(he was pretty big), and we get to this place where you can go left or right to catch the subway in the two different directions, and he asked me which one I had to go, I told him, and he said ""ah...too bad, I'm going the other way"" and I was pretty relieved that finally this agony was going to end. So I try to say goodbye, but he says ""you have 5 mins to your train, let's talk"" I'm sweating like a motherfucker and shitting my pants I try to think of ways to get out, because I can in no way endure another 5 minutes of talking to this creep, but as I'm thinking he puts his hand on my shoulder again (I know this type of touch really well, it is no way done with good intentions, plus why the fuck is this guy touching me) asks for my phone number, so usually I just change the last digit, but what he said was ""give me you phone, so I can call you"", I panic, there are still some minutes left till my train comes, I can't run, because he's holding me, so I give him my phone, say I have to go, he called almost immediately, but I managed to get on the train and blocked him. I cried on the subway, because I always feel so helpless in these situations and men (and women for sure) don't understand how traumatizing an experience like this can be for a person. It is not ok, to go up and talk to random people, which clearly have 0 interest, and it is totally unacceptable to invade someone's personal space and touch them without permission. Have a great day!"
halberd0,fdn43xi,t3_elxt3x,Its because MOST people arent polite. Its like a luxury nowadays
nightsmystic,fdn57f8,t3_elxt3x,"Ugh I hate when this happens.... smiling doesn‚Äôt mean anything other than I‚Äôm being nice... yesterday for point..... I was outside of a coffee shop, on the phone, I smiled at a guy as we made eye contact.... few minutes later he came and knocked on my window telling me to roll it down!!!!!! I just looked at him and motioned ‚ÄúI‚Äôm on the phone‚Äù‚Äî then left without getting coffee."
usagicchi,fdn77dx,t3_elxt3x,Nice username!!
DKS97,fdn8ovr,t3_elxt3x,"I can say it can be confusing (sometimes) as generally speaking most males go a long time without getting anything close to a compliment or something positive from other people. 

It just takes the right person to leave it be, as soon as they realise kinda thing. 

That being said, I know that a lot of people are just relentless and creepy. I just wanted to voice the minority. :)"
GiuliettaBrunetta,fdn8vt7,t3_elxt3x,Ugh. Yes. You‚Äôre being friendly with a guy because you thin you‚Äôre becoming friends and then he gets mad at you when he makes a move and you reject him. ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt have flirted with me!!!‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt. I was being a kind and friendly friend.
VegetablesAreWeird,fdna43e,t3_elxt3x,"I was working at a place where I was the only woman, that place had a lot of foreign men working there, and they would usually come and ''talk'' to me, borderline harassing me. (asking me where I lived, when I was done at work, if I wanted to go and work out with them, which gym I was going to, boyfriend, my sexuality etc..)It truly scared me, and since then I've become really scared of certain guys, doesn't mean all men, but some guys are really scary.

EDIT: And everyday, at end of the day after work when I was walking home, those guys would usually be standing outside smoking, basically staring me down where I was going."
StreetBob37,fdnb3kb,t3_elxt3x,"Lol omg.. being a guy I don‚Äôt know how many times I‚Äôve seen this with my friends and always trying to pull them away, I always understood it but wow how bad it is sometimes. People need to learn way better than just being nice"
mellllo16,fdnbyae,t3_elxt3x,"This. 

Gosh, this is so annoying."
PoisonRoseX,fdnhg4q,t3_elxt3x,"Thank you! Also if the person providing customer service for you happens to be female, probably a good 99.99% of the time shes only being nice because it‚Äôs her job. Continuing to hit on her knowing she has to be nice and put up with it does not improve your chances with her - instead you just become that annoying and rude guy that doesn‚Äôt understand no."
NeverTectonic,fdnht4v,t3_elxt3x,"Fam, we don't even have to be nice to them to get this situation. We could be minding our own business, doing our do, not smiling, not even looking at them, and blokes still find a way to get all up our grills.

I've been in a ratty-ass t-shirt and pj pants, going to the pharmacy, and have had dudes holler at me from inside a car, asking if I had a boyfriend. There was nothing about my body language that showed I was doing anything else but going towards the pharmacy. I quite frankly looked like a hob goblin.

I've had headphones in, waiting at a bus stop in the middle of winter in the biggest coat imaginable, and the same type of situation, but a bloke on foot who would not leave me TF alone.

I've been waiting for the train and had some rando ask me if I remembered him, when I'd just moved to the city 1 month ago, and I'm taken. Started asking if I remember dating him; I look like his ex, yadda yadda yadda.

I had a dude who I'd see and smile at because he was a neighbor, just smile. Not trying to pick him up, just smile, and then he tried to give me a gift and bring me to his house, muttering something about how his wife wouldn't be happy about this, but thinks I'm his Juliet. No.

Some dudes propositioned me for paid sex while on a busy city street. I have no idea why they thought I'd be into that, or if they thought this worked with women, ever. I wish I was making that one up, but I'm not.

It's so ubiquitous at this point that women will get cat-called, harassed, followed, or hit on simply for existing in a public space. Don't even have to smile, just have to be existing.

It's tiring."
GirlSurfer,fdni6l6,t3_elxt3x,"I second this. A very stern "" you're making me uncomfortable."" No explaining or apologizing. Any sensible person would back off at if someone said this to them. Assuming he's a creep though he will probably try to justify himself. But if you don't budge from ""you're making me uncomfortable"" he really can't argue with that. Just don't make the mistake of apologizing or negotiating with him. Sterness is the key."
gmenchaca,fdno2h3,t3_elxt3x,"This is the one thing I wish mean understood clearly.  Being nice doesn‚Äôt mean, ‚Äòyes, have what you want.‚Äô"

Jadudes,fdlmmop,t3_elxt3x,"Absolutely true, and it‚Äôs sad that more and more people are beginning to think like that. The *real* issue and misunderstanding is when you and the girl actually do start fucking, and not knowing if it‚Äôs just a casual thing because of hook up culture; or if they actually are interested in you."
fmail_delivery_man,fdm4t04,t1_fdlmmop,At that point I recommend asking the other person.  It might feel uncomfortable at first but it‚Äôll save you both a lot of time to just figure out what you want and how you‚Äôre feeling.

Reachingout365,fdlvasj,t3_elxt3x,"OMFG this!!! I frequent grocery stores, the gas station, and the weed dispensary because I'm disabled (invisible disability; CPTSD, it's a ""disability"" in that it you know, limits me a lot,) and I don't own a vehicle, therefore, I bike a lot. So I frequent stores a lot for my errands. It is a small town. 

In the past 3 years, I've had 5 occasions of a store worker hitting on me, and it makes me feel uncomfortable to go back in.

I don't get it. I was re-traumatized in 2017 and as a result don't sleep well, I often look tired, and yet.... to me, a tired looking woman is one you want to leave tf alone. I'm so avoidant, I couldn't be anymore unavailable in my life then right now, also, stores is NOT the place to start a relationship. I've even had dudes try and bike next to me ""for a bike ride"" no. 

I had a 50 year old cashier hit on me after us having several friendly conversations I thought nothing of. Next thing he does is asks my name, asks if I'm going to the may fair, then says ""I guess I'll see you there"" excuse me?! No! He kept doing this until eventually I lost it and said ""for fucks sakes"" under my breath and rolled my eyes. I find the older they are, the worse... the younger ones/ones my age tend to get the hint faster. But it's so creepy. We were always friendly and I assumed he was just being friendly, then it slowly started to look more and  more like he was singling me out. (Making friendly convos about my purchases everyrime; I assume that is just friendly. Apparently it wasn't, which is manipulative; cause then guess what? You call them out, they can back pedal and gaslight and claim ""thy were just being friendly"" when their unwanted advances are rejected to avoid getting in trouble, and to make you seem crazy.) 

Like this guy at the weed dispensary; he's cute tbh, which makes me more uncomfortable cause they usually feel that's an advantage.... I'm friendly and he's tried to make a personal connection everyrime I come in. Ffs. I just want the weed to help with my insomnia and CPTSD and I'm out; not where to flirt. I've literally spent more money on delivery just to avoid going in. Cause I need it but I'm so shy and anxious and it make me uncomfortable. I already worry about how I'm coming across.

Oh and I had another dude freaking stalked me and left  notes on my apartment door because I accepted a favor he offered. Ffs.... leave me alone. Like if I want a relationship I WILL make myself available and even be the one to initiate. But never in my normal day to day life. They're so entitled."
casteel23,fdm3e0k,t3_elxt3x,"Fucking THIS
I am a LESBIAN in a relationship and am generally very polite to everyone (out of actual niceness and actual FEAR). I don't want to fuck you random dude on the street/anywhere else. I just want to get back to the comfort of my many cats."
AuRevoir3,fdng478,t3_elxt3x,"Agreed. I think it's fine if they're not creepy about it/they respect your boundaries but if they have a sense of entitlement about it, they can fuck right off. They go on about how they need this, that and the other because ""i'M a MaN aNd YoU wOuLdN't UnDeRsTaNd"" but then they act like a petulant little boy. You're not a man if you act like that.

I hope everything is as perfect as it's going, but just keep your eyes open for any sort of questionable things when you finally get to meet them.

Jpeg_artifacthunter,fdrn8ox,t1_fdqzws5,"I think this is a little less sketchy since he's on the night shift, if anything it gave him something interesting to hope for/look forward to while doing whatever his work was. At least, that's my take."
nomoresweetheart,fdr6wlq,t1_fdqzws5,"It is a bit over the top but it depends on the relationship. A lot of long distance couples fall asleep in calls, when you can‚Äôt cuddle it can be nice. Depends on the people. But yeah, caution when meeting is definitely best.

querico,fdrryl7,t1_fdrn8ox,"Yeah, it sounded to me like he just kept the call going on his phone as just a background thing while he did normal work tasks. Not like he was just sitting there staring at it waiting for OP to wake up."

cactusdreamz,fdl766m,t1_fdkrh10,"It's absolutely possible to just reduce the amount you drink.  In the past I drank entirely too much, went to AA meetings on and off for years, even went to rehab.  The philosophy I have built is that our minds are extremely powerful, and while I respect the AA community and all of the support one can gain in meetings, I've never liked the aspect of it that teaches that you are completely helpless and powerless to addiction.  I disagree and believe that we can all gain self control.  I understand that it's not that easy or simple, and some people are better off completely removing the temptation to drink altogether, but I also think there is something to be said for taking control of your mind and not believing that you are helpless.  IMO it's a dangerous thing to think that you can't have control over your addiction, and will often times become an excuse as to why you had that 5th glass of wine etc.  I respect any path somebody chooses to take in order to become healthier, but have found for me personally that I can still have a glass of wine with dinner or a beer at a bar with a buddy without going over the limit.  Just wanted to say I believe from personal experience that you can be a unicorn! Much love to you, you're doing great friend."
86_Hilux,fdnf9m4,t1_fdkrh10,"I believe it has much to do with your mental state! Wanting to change is the initiation of the process, but it‚Äôs mentally not letting your left hand know what the right hand will do next!

When I just do it and not give my self that warning shot, I then kept my right hand from knowing what my left hand is thinking.  This might just be me?

I just wanted to say this, and don‚Äôt let it discourage you: in fact, let it motivate you. But there is a large chance that your children do know that it‚Äôs a problem for you, at least they may have a feeling. And that feeling is still devastating. Kids are more perceptive than we ever give them credit for. My mom tried to hide things from me that I caught on to, and I never told her I did, so I‚Äôm sure she thinks it stayed hidden from me too. Just some food for thought. I wish you the best of luck on your journey!"
MrRogueducky,fdjp9x0,t3_eloypz,"Well done!!! I know it‚Äôs different for different people, but it is possible to taper down alcohol use. I went from drinking a bottle of wine a day, to three a week, then two a week and finally down to one a week and now it‚Äôs not even one a week. Granted it wasn‚Äôt easy, it took me a couple of years, not just to gradually cut down, but to feel comfortable and happy with it. I started exactly the same way as you have, just one less glass here and there. It no longer feels like a fight, it just feels natural. It took time but it‚Äôs totally worth it, you can do it!"
rottingfruitcake,fdkh3wg,t1_fdjp9x0,"This has also worked for me. I think people need to understand that teetotaling isn‚Äôt the only way to reduce alcohol intake. For me, I‚Äôm not out to get drunk every night. I don‚Äôt drink during the day. But I‚Äôd built my evening habits around a bottle of wine. Just like any other learned behavior, you can unlearn it.

vellise8,fdkhwqj,t1_fdkh3wg,"I agree completely. I was drinking way too much my last year in law school. Now that nightmare is over and I can see how I was and how badly I was coping. Instead of giving up alcohol all together I decided to cut back to every other day, then only on the weekend, to one day a week. Drinking on the weekend does not work for me b/c it can turn into a 4 day drink fest. 

Do what works for you. Skipping just one day, one glass, one anything is a step in the right direction."

Do tell on your modifications ??"
Portlandbuilderguy,fdl67f3,t1_fdk9f9z,"Basically I substituted a mineral water as my first choice when ever I would habitually be having a drink. My habit was to come home, have a beer and decompress from my day. This would turn into 2-4 drinks, tv then bed time. All I did was substituted a mineral water then I would go for a 10-15 minute walk around the neighborhood instead of that first drink. Amazingly this was enough to rejuvenate me and I would find something positive rewarding and productive the rest of my evening. I don‚Äôt even do that anymore. I do t even think about drinking anymore. In social occasions I drink mineral water on the rocks with a lemon twist, this allows me to avoid the ‚Äúwhy aren‚Äôt you drinking?!‚Äù Statements. I absolutely have zero urge to drink anymore because I feel fantastic and the slight dull depressed state that I existed in for so long is gone. I will drink again, I have not quit.

Anyway, last year, I was dry for almost 4 months and only then realized how abundant alcohol use/shoving down your throat via advertising, bars everywhere, workplace drinking, etc etc etc is.  It‚Äôs absolutely mind blowing.  I feel so deeply for those struggling because the strength it takes to keep away is unreal.  For that simple fact, you win every time you choose not to have a drink!

clea_vage,fdl14bn,t1_fdkstan,"I did a dry month a while back and I drank so much Kombucha haha. Now, my husband and I are doing a dry January because we found ourselves drinking at least 2 drinks pretty much every night. I would start with good intentions, i.e. *I'll only have one glass of wine!* But most nights, that quickly led to me pouring *a little more* into my wine glass as the night wore on.

I'm hoping dry January will give me a nice reset on perspective and break the bad habit. Luckily, more and more places are getting decent non-alcoholic beers. I find that is nice alternative when out with friends. I still get the feeling of holding a beer and drinking without the consequences.

Also, I've heard from people that drinking pomegranate juice or tart cherry juice in a wine glass can be a nice alternative to wine. No, it doesn't taste anything like wine, but it imitates the look and feel of enjoying a glass of wine."
iwantonethree,fdl21k4,t1_fdl14bn,"Yes there are quite a few non alcoholic beers that actually taste like beer!  There is however, no non alcohol wine that actually tastes like wine .... which is a bit shit when wine is your drink of choice.  Good on you doing dry January !"
Simply92Me,fdjo3tp,t3_eloypz,"Congrats OP. This a huge step forward in it's own right, you making conscious decision to cut back is worth being proud of! As others have said, resets and set backs happen so don't give up! 

I would consult a doctor before quitting cold turkey, and I would suggest looking into AAA meetings if you haven't already."

beersticker,fdkue3c,t3_eloypz,Late comment but I went from having a couple to few beers every single night to not drinking at all. One day I woke up and just didn't want to anymore and it's been about 4 months now. I can't give you a reason why I changed but I did. I just don't have the drive anymore. I'm glad you stopped!

iwantonethree,fdkqzsm,t1_fdjj1je,"Seriously - heavy willpower. Hey am I convinced it will last ?  No.  But I‚Äôm so so determined and desperately want to be able to drink ‚Äòlike other people‚Äô rather than have to become a tee totaller forever.  Many will say I‚Äôm dreaming but I‚Äôm trying so hard.
My problem is I‚Äôm incredibly psychologically addicted - so it‚Äôs ingrained in me to reach for the bottle and then just top it up again and again without really thinking about it.  So I‚Äôve got to create new neural pathways.
So I said to myself ‚Äòyou don‚Äôt need that‚Äô 
‚ÄòYou‚Äôve had two one more wont feel any better you‚Äôve got the best of it‚Äô
‚ÄòYou can have another one tomorrow‚Äô
‚ÄòYou will feel way better in the morning if you don‚Äôt have another one‚Äô
‚ÄòYou won‚Äôt wake up dry and disgusting in the night if you have a cup of tea‚Äô etc etc.

Distraction.  Go and talk to a neighbour / do the dishes / walk outside and think about what colour to paint the house ... anything that breaks that habit and starts to create new neural pathways.
Hey all the science says I won‚Äôt succeed and will end up succumbing to alcoholism.  

I want to be the exception."

It‚Äôs the combination of drinking with  Naltrexone in your system that  leads to extinction. But you probably knew that. My friend also got nauseous and stopped TSM.

This morning though, I'm drinking Columbian hot chocolate! It's got a kick!

Happy hot drinking!"
merrythoughts,fdk2b9l,t3_eloypz,"Great job, friend. I too have to make a conscious effort to not get another drink. And to not drink anything a few nights a week.

xjw308,fdk3rdw,t3_eloypz,"That's awesome... I used to take breaks now and again, just to make sure I didn't start forming any habits.  I don't think I'm an alcoholic, but I can get into patterns of drinking fairly easily.  And then if it's just to fit a pattern, what's the point, right?

A friend of mine who drank a little more than myself went to just drinking on the weekend, and that made a huge difference for him.  He lost about 15lbs, and has a lot more energy day-to-day.  FWIW I switched to using cannabis for stress and pain relief, which has worked amazingly for me.  I don't know if that's legal, or an option for you, but perhaps something to consider?  I know people have different opinions, so I never want to offend anyone.  For myself, since doing that, I've honestly gone from a couple drinks (almost) every evening, to (maybe) a few drinks a month.  I buy single, or maybe 4-pack beers, and they'll sit in the fridge for a month sometimes.  I save a lot of money, and generally feel better.  I've tried RX and nothing helps as much.

You should be proud!  Nothing wrong with baby steps! 

:)

TL;DR - Tapering off can work, and I personally endorse it.  And if you're open to exploring other options, finding an alternative could help."
iwantonethree,fdkupc4,t1_fdk3rdw,"Thanks for your support.  I agree - I believe I can taper, it comes down to extreme willpower and changing habits .  Habits CAN be broken I just know it.

Just so you know, tapering works for many people. But it's not about ""I'm allowed <x> many drinks"", it's about ""I am done drinking more now."". Abstinence may be necessary for some, but many others simply need to train themselves to have the right habits, and setup the right environment. What you did is perfect; giving yourself an alternative by default."

pointlessly_pedantic,fdkbmsz,t3_eloypz,"Idk what you've read, but a few therapists I had seen mentioned some dangers of going cold turkey (for me it had to do with it potentially risking exacerbating my depression and anxiety). But from experience, I had found that tapering off worked for me when it was done on purpose (with concrete goals) and with learning about how to control the triggers (like common contexts or events that tended to lead me to drink) as well as adopt healthier alternatives when possible (kinda like tea for you, but for me it was coffee or soda or something). I think if you continue to work at the tapering it could really build momentum. 

Also, you should be damn proud of yourself. It's hard. Making the conscious decision to choose a non-alcoholic beverage when you know you'd like some booze takes serious strength."
katietheemt,fdkbu2r,t3_eloypz,"Way to go! Tea is good, very very good."

Throwaway19995674,eml4h2,top_level,"It's been a rough week. Over winter break, one of the nicest 5th grade students we had decided to commit suicide. She didn't leave a note, didn't tell anyone she was going to do it, and no one knows why. She was not bullied and was very well liked at school and her parents could be strict but are very loving. (Edit: What I mean is, she was a kid who does get punished when she does wrong, but also praised relentlessly when she did right. In this day and age parents are constantly letting their kids get away with everyone -- my student did not, but her parents also loved her and constantly talked about how amazing she was. While true, we do not know what went on at home, it appears to everyone who knows the family including some staff who were very close that the family were not unkind.) We all found out this past weekend and the kids have been alright about it at school. I'm the art teacher so I saw her once or twice a week depending, and have been her art teacher for three years.

I didn't really cry. I'm not the most empathetic person. I recognize a situation is sad but it's rare for something to effect me emotionally a great deal. As the week went on it was on the back of my mind constantly... Mostly just trying to understand it, and feeling sorry for her classroom teacher and friends who were close.

Today after school was the wake, and all the teachers who knew her went. It was an open casket and I was getting teary eyed. Then her classmates started showing up and that was horrible. I wish the parents had kept them home to be honest, no ten year old should see their friend in a casket. All of the kids know she killed herself too, despite us trying to keep that private. The kids are all crying and that's when I started to really feel it. I overheard one student say ""We all loved her so much, why did she do this?"". There were kids curled up in corners just sobbing. One girl came up to me and just latched onto me and cried.

I finally let loose and cried my eyes out the entire 45 minute drive back home. I feel so incredibly sad for these children who lost their friend. No ten year old should lose a friend but it's even worse that they know she chose to take her own life and they'll never know why. This has all been so traumatic for them and it hurts me a lot. 

Tomorrow is her actual funeral and a lot of teachers who had her before are taking the day off to go, including two of the 5th grade teachers. I am not, because I guess I'd like to be at the school for those kids. It might be hard for them with their classroom teacher gone and it might make them feel better to see at least one of their teachers they know at school. But I'm also scared that tomorrow will be a hot mess.

Don't really know what the point of my rant is. Just wish I could wrap my head around this."
yellnhollar,fdppqus,t3_eml4h2,"Many of these kids are probably seeing death of someone close for the first time.

On point (A.) one of the worst things I was told non-stop as a child was ‚ÄúYou think life is hard now, just wait this you‚Äôre an adult!‚Äù Yes, some of the things I was struggling with were not as important as I made them out to be in the scale of my lifetime, but in my ‚Äúnot fully developed brain‚Äù one of the things I found myself thinking was ‚Äúif this is really as good as it‚Äôs ever going to be, then I don‚Äôt want to be alive to see get it worse.‚Äù If your child is complaining that a teacher is being unfair to them; please take the time to listen to them. Sure it might be something as simple as ‚Äúthe pop-quiz was unfair‚Äù or it might be a teacher is targeting your child for one reason or another. You have no way of knowing what goes on in the classroom, and even if it is nothing just ask yourself how you would feel if anytime you complained about your boss, that your partner/friend/whatever turned into a ‚Äúwho has it worse game.‚Äù and if it really is a case of the kid is just being complaining, agree that it sucks for now  but hey at least as adult; you can decide you hate your boss/teacher/job  and try to find a new one. 

This leads to another thing that I think we as adults forget; kids actually have so little freedom to make choices, but are far too often held responsible as if they do have that power. 

I can recount dozens of times when I was punished for being late to school, or not having homework, not having supplies, or not meeting for group projects when 

1. I had 0 control over the fact we could not leave the house until my younger sister was dressed and ready..

2. I trusted my parent who wanted to check my homework and told me it was in my backpack when it was not, or the fact the class was misbehaving all day so a teacher assigned several worksheets as punishment the same night my parents demand I go to church, or have a sports practice, or have a social event that I‚Äôm not allowed to skip, but I also have to be in bed on time giving me no time to do it.

3. I can‚Äôt make my single mother carve out time to to drive me across town for a group project when she‚Äôs supposed to be at work

4. When my mother is trying to decide what bills do and do not get paid this month, and we don‚Äôt have the money to buy a posterboard/new paperback book/non-sense supply of the week is; I as 10 year old cannot make her and shaming me in front of my classmates and making me miss recess for not having it isn‚Äôt going to help her pull money out of her ass.

I‚Äôm not going to get as much into (B.) because that could be a thesis all it‚Äôs own, but bullet points are:

1. The world moves so much faster, and it can really mess with a baseline of normal. For a ‚Äúsmart kid‚Äù (define that however you want) them just watching the news night can be stressful as hell because it seems like every night the world is about to end. If every day the news talks about how thousands are losing their jobs and homes. They‚Äôre going to ask ‚ÄúCould my family  be next?‚Äù

2.  We put so much pressure on children these days. They need to get good grades in grade school, so they can take advanced classes in middle school, so they can take AP classes in high school, so they can get scholarships to a good college, so they can get a good job or else they will be homeless. And don‚Äôt forget to stuff their schedule with extra curricular so they can advance in those as well. Yes, growth and development are important but there‚Äôs a difference between ‚ÄúWork hard in school‚Äù and ‚ÄúYou are always inches from a lifetime of failure.‚Äù

3. Everything is on the internet. And the internet never forgets. It‚Äôs not just about what your child puts or does on the internet, but what other people can put on the internet about your child. If some idiot schoolmate/family/whoever puts a first and last name of a post about something, it could very well end up being the first result on the google page a future employer looks at. So when Grandma decides to make a public FB post  about an embarrassing childhood incident, remember that they make get asked about that in a future job interview.

4. 20 years ago Susie would think Jane is fat, and call her a name. It may not be remembered by the next day. Today Susie can think Jane is fat and call her names, create photoshops and memes and get the whole class in it in a matter of minutes to a level that break a person in a matter of hours. Schoolyard bullying can now follow you 24/7 with a written record in case anyone forget what you were being bullied about or decides that the joke is funny again even when your kid thought it was over!

TLDR; it‚Äôs so very easy for parents to assume ‚Äúit could never happen to my child‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a good parent so I would notice‚Äù; but the reality is without being inside your kids brain, you might not notice until it‚Äôs too late because what you see as a bump in the road, they see as a fatal collision. Keep open communication with your kid, remember to actually listen to what they are saying, and be ready to offer the help they actually need based on what they say, not based on what parent brain fires off in the first 15 seconds while it juggling 20,000 things.

windupgodzilla,fdq0i3m,t1_fdppqus,"As someone who was a suicidally depressed 10-year-old, I can tell you that my ‚Äúwhy‚Äù was the mortal terror and unrelenting loneliness of having cruel, narcissistic parents who presented to the outside world as ‚Äústrict but very loving.‚Äù I talked about it (edit: my suicidal ideation) to friends and word got around to parents and faculty at my school. My parents sent me to therapy for a year to save face but it didn‚Äôt really get better from there.

I‚Äôm 46 now and, while today I‚Äôm doing mostly ok-ISH, I spent my most of my life dealing with panic, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorders, and substance abuse.

ShutUpAndEatYaBeanz,fdq9mjy,t1_fdppqus,"you'd think a person so young wouldn't do that sort of things or even have those thoughts at such a young age but it happens and it's more frequent then we realise. I at the age of 12 overdosed on my brothers Ritalin and a bunch of pain killers, mum said I was ruining her marriage with my step dad and that I was ruining the family. So I had the mindset that it'd be better for everyone if I wasn't there. I had lots of other stuff influence me to do that but nothing I'm gonna talk about. I'm only 17 and still going through shit but after quite a few suicide attempts and self harm I've realised that it isn't worth the pain that you're going to put other people through. If anyone is having any suicidal thoughts please call lifeline or message me I'll help the best I can."
soupyy_poop,fdqt0jn,t1_fdppqus,"*(This is not placing any blame on any parent who has lost a child to ending their own life. Merely a wake-up to those who are fortunate enough to still have ours alive and to make sure we're mindful enough for them)* 

It's so hard to recognize anyone's signs of mental illness because everyone exhibits it differently. The duty of a parent is to have constant *open* communication with your children and allowing them to *feel* as if they can communicate with you - not just you sitting there saying ""Why didn't you tell me?!"" But when they speak up, you give a reaction that isn't comforting. The other thing is parents negating their child's problems and thinking ""Meh, you'll have real problems when you're older."" That's so heartbreaking to anyone, and that will only create distance between you and your child. 

My own son is 12. I had missed the signs of him going through depression because it melted so easily with the change of schools (going into middle school), puberty angst, and sad feelings (that I was aware of) from us moving out of his childhood home. He always struggled in school, so I never thought any different when he was struggling in middle school until he was *failing* everything. As a single mom I thought I had a great enough relationship with him, but obviously I was still not creating the room for him to feel okay to open up to me when he was going through that. 

Eventually, one night of me lecturing him about his grades he finally broke down crying and opened up about all the things he's been feeling and hiding from me. My baby even had the awareness of saying he felt like he should speak to someone about it (meaning a therapist). At that exact moment is the most crucial moment for any parent and the next step determines how much your child can rely on their own parent. I chose to hug him, hold him, let him cry as much as he needed, and finally breathe out all his emotions he felt he needed to hide. By the next morning at 8am I was on the phone with insurance, had a therapy appointment set by that following Monday, and called his pediatrician to inform him of what's going on. 

Granted, I also grew up with a mother who has severe depression and attempted to end her life a couple times. I knew what neglect could lead to and I wasn't taking the chance with my only child; I realized I got really lucky by catching it when I did. Things could have been so much worse if I continued to obliviously chalk up his symptoms to ""his age."" It keeps me on my toes to think of the possibility that could have happened if he kept feeling he had to hide his feelings from others, and it was a wake up call for me as a parent that I need to work on the type of space I'm creating for expression for my son."
aizawashota,fdqz2h4,t1_fdppqus,"I was suicidal from the age of 9. That was when I first woke up and thought 'I wish I would have died in my sleep'. Had no idea why, because I hadn't thought of it before. But then it just got increasingly worse and never stopped.

But my story might be a bit different: I had incredibly loving parents and grandparents and siblings. My parents sacrificed so that we could have everything we wanted (within reason). No one had ever assaulted me and I wasn't bullied for the most part. Like I said, I just woke up and that was it for me. I developed severe OCD and no one recognized it as such. My mom knew what OCD was but didn't think kids could get OCD, so both parents just yelled at me for the things I was doing (yelling in frustration, not in an abusive way). I didn't know what depression or OCD was, so I was completely lost. I knew something was wrong, but I didn't know how to fix it. I wanted out so badly because I just wanted it all to stop. My hands were cracked and bleeding from all the washing and I couldn't touch things. Like even my own stuff. I'd have to use my wrists or sleeves to pick something up. I couldn't drink out of a glass that I had put down. Even if I hadn't left the room and I knew no one had been in there--it didn't matter, because my brain was convinced someone must have drank out of it, so it was contaminated. I couldn't ever get clean enough. I thought everyone in the world was looking at me and laughing. I thought that people could hear my thoughts, which made my obsessive thoughts WORSE and made my anxiety raise even higher. It was a vicious cycle I couldn't break out of.

Anyways, that was just some examples of what I dealt with in my brain. While my outside life was fine and I was loved and always treated well, I still wanted to die every single day. It was always my first thought when I woke up. If I had known suicide was a thing, I might have attempted it, too. But the internet wasn't as available as it is today, so I didn't learn about it until I was a teen. 

So it very well could be that this little girl was suffering from something like that. I never told anyone how bad I was suffering. Maybe she didn't tell anyone, either. The poor thing. My heart goes out to each and every child struggling with mental illness (or just struggling in general). No one should have to experience that, and especially not children. And it makes me sick to my stomach knowing that there are so many kids out there like me and I can't do a thing about it. Suffering in silence is the worst."
MlleSemicolon,fdqssuj,t1_fdppqus,"No mental illness is necessarily required, though... There are exceptions, of course.

Speaking from experience, a kid lacks the perception that there's a way out if abuse is a factor. Unfortunately the way out becomes taking their own lives."
Sushikrazy,fdquesg,t1_fdppqus,Not all kids that are bullied tell anyone about it so their might have been bullying happening. It is hard but it is good for kids to learn the true possibilities from  someone being so depressed and not feeling they can let anyone know.

arsenicKatnip,fdr67zc,t1_fdppqus,"Honestly, I get the kid's side of it.

Now, with introspection, sure, your issues as a child don't seem that bad.

But growing up, you're belittled and told, constantly, it'll get worse. You have it so easy, your issues don't matter, your feelings don't matter. Especially as a boy, you're expected, bullied into just dealing with things. You're supposed to be big and tough and strong.

Your feelings don't matter, you're supposed to be okay, everything just gets worse and you'll see.

How the hell is that okay, to treat a kid?

I get it, what parent thinks their kid is going to kill themselves. But you have to remember, a majority of loved ones have no idea because they don't listen, they don't take concerns seriously, or they're too busy.

Until it's too late. From elementary to high school grad, I can't even count on two hands the amount of friends I had that attempted or successfully passed away at their own hands.

Kid's problems shouldn't be dismissed. Listen to them. They're people too."
Throwaway19995674,fdq5tnm,t1_fdppqus,"It's been very confusing. All of the staff have been trying to think back but she truly was a very happy, smiley kid all of the time. The counselor told me that she looked through notes and had met with her multiple times but never once did she mention being sad about something relating to herself but rather was worried about her classmates. What she did tell me and I agree with is that children can be impulsive, and as we all know don't recognize the weight of their actions. There is no way for a 10 year old to really understand death. The glamorized idea of suicide from TV shows, movies, etc might be in their head where everyone feels sorry for being mean to them after, but they don't really get that they will be dead and gone. She just wanted to escape a moment that was too painful for her for whatever reason, and did that. It shows it was a bit more ""impulsive"" because she hadn't told anyone or written a note and these days kids tell nearly everyone everything over their phones.

The only ""sign"" I noticed was her being a bit more withdrawn and not putting in much effort in art class anymore but that is so so common in 5th graders so it's hard to really think of that as a sign.."
vanduran5,fdsio2v,t1_fdppqus,"Back in 2009 (when I was 10), my parents were struggling to keep our house when the economy tanked. They kept shouting ""We're gonna lose the house! We need to get second jobs!"" and it scared me. It made me believe that we might've been homeless again. And being a 10-year-old with anxiety and paranoia, I internalized that fear and never told anyone out of fear of being bullied.

I remember having suicidal thoughts at that age because I had a plan to reveal that secret on my deathbed when I'm old, but I realized that would've taken forever, and I just wanted the pain to stop.

I may have been a very specific case, but yes, kids that young can be suicidal."
MsFaolin,fdpzl9s,t1_fdpyyde,"The listening and taking it seriously is so important. My home life was not great, when my mom married my step dad I became really depressed, around 9 or 10. Her marriage with my dad was abusive and she didn't protect me. It was only like 2 or 3 years between the marriages.

I tried to tell her that I was sad. I didn't know how, so I just said ""I have so many problems"". I was crying as I said it.

Her and my step dad laughed at me because ""how can a child have so many problems"".

I didn't know what suicide was back then but if I did I feel I may have taken that option. (This was the 90s so there wasn't the same media presence as there is now that may have given me more info on suicide) 
When I was a teen, I attempted and self harmed. Still never got help. 

I read something somewhere which said
Listen to your kids for the little stuff, because later when they have big stuff to talk about they won't come to you. It was big stuff to them all along."

oneidadreamer,fdq6pio,t1_fdpyyde,"This was an amazing reply, and OP you sound like you do not credit yourself for being a very empathetic person.  You may not cry or feel deeply saddened in the traditional sense, but you have the love and consideration to be at both the wake and the school the next day as a calm shoulder for her classmates to cry on.  I find that incredibly empathetic!  

  One small point I wanted to add to the beautiful entry above is to also remember that most children do not have the vocabulary or conversational skills to tell us that 1. they are depressed 2. they don't know what to do about it, and 3. they may not even know that is what they are feeling.  I regret that for many years I often saw my daughter's exhaustion and stomach aches as her way of trying to get out of her homework or chores.  Now that she is 19 I know that from a very young age she was struggling with severe depression, but didn't know how to tell us.  This culminated in the physical symptoms I could see.

  Thank you for the love and energy you give these little people everyday.  If I could wave my magic wand teachers would receive the paychecks of NBA stars, not borderline poverty wages.  You are on the frontlines of the struggle to help raise moral and compassionate children in a world that is often unmoral and cruel.  Thank you for all you do!"
passicnfruit,fdqaqef,t1_fdpyyde,"I have nothing to add because you hit every point I wanted to mention and then some, with an eloquence _and_ clarity I couldn‚Äôt very well rival. Especially your point about ‚Äúyou think you have it hard, but adults have it worse‚Äù (or as I was often told, ‚Äúthis is the best time of your life!‚Äù) being a horrible, ignorant thing to say to someone so young and suffering, that hit really hard. As I‚Äôm graduating college soon, I still hear this from people (as I have my whole life), and I still think the same, to some degree (I have my days): ‚ÄúIf this is the best time of my life (or if that time has already passed), shouldn‚Äôt I just end it now? Isn‚Äôt that what you‚Äôre telling me I should do?‚Äù

I don‚Äôt feel this so much anymore, but before, eh, maybe even this semester, and okay, maybe still sometimes now, the whole ‚Äúif I‚Äôm not doing great in everything, then I‚Äôm a failure and I will be homeless‚Äù was always on my mind as a kid. In high school, I would hit myself because I was disappointed that I didn‚Äôt talk to my advisor in middle school to put me two grades up in math classes so I could 1) be with a couple of my friends who skipped, and 2) get into community college math courses during high school. I would cry for wasting my lunch period eating, when I could have taken lunch P.E. so that I could fill my regular P.E. slot with another AP, and I hated myself for taking less than, I‚Äôm not even sure now, but something like less than 10 APs during high school. (Looking back, I want to say it was so ridiculous, but when school is your entire life, the only thing that gives your measly, undistinguished life meaning, and you feel like you‚Äôve failed at it (or done less than the most you could do, which to some, is effectively the same as being a failure), it‚Äôs really not so ridiculous.)

I recall being in early grade school, no older than six or seven, when I would spend some recesses sometimes on the other side of the large tree between the classrooms and the fence/road, praying (non-religiously, though I did often think that if there was a kind god, that it would grant my wish) for a car to spin off the road and crash into me. After that tree became off limits (different ages had different play areas; older kid play areas were further away from the street and the fence) I would fantasize about overdosing on my father‚Äôs medicines (of course not knowing anything about what it‚Äôd be like, failure rates or anything), or committing seppuku (as if I had/could produce honor by doing so). The urge never really went away, but it manifested in different forms throughout the years. I spoke once in high school to my mom about wanting to commit suicide; I expected her to say, ‚ÄúI know‚Äù or something to that effect, but it was as though the thought had never even crossed her mind. It was so shocking to me, that something that haunted me, maybe not my every waking hour, but on a fairly regular basis, so heavily, could be so utterly unrecognized as even distantly relevant until mentioned explicitly by me. (She‚Äôd never, ever pressured me to do anything she thought I might find unpleasant (taking whatever higher classes, or extracurriculars) (to the extent that I‚Äôm pretty sure if I told her I wanted to drop out (pre-suicidal confession), she would let me do so without a question) (all of my Asian friends with tiger moms are envious of me, and I know it was an immense privilege for her to be this way, but I also wish she would have more or less forced me to do some things, because I still feel like I‚Äôm lacking things my friends with stricter parents now have (skills with sports and instruments for the most part)), but after I told her, she backed off even more, if that‚Äôs possible.) (I lost track of parentheses at some point but it‚Äôs 5am and I‚Äôm not going to proofread. Woo!)

I don‚Äôt know what came over me to make me want to spill so much of my childhood/academic trauma here; this was really meant to be a one or two line ‚Äúthank you for writing this wonderful, in many ways quite perfect (and I don‚Äôt use that word a lot/lightly) assessment‚Äù, but.. this happened.

FlamingOtaku,fdqpqv3,t1_fdpyyde,"For what it's worth, I have pretty first-hand experience with all that. The first time I made a plan to commit suicide was in 4th grade. Between some bullying, anxiety and depression, a teacher who essentially bullied me and made me feel ostracized from the ELP class I was in for 3 years prior, and my mom not paying much attention to me due to college, it was rough. It happened again in 6th grade, and was bad enough that I had to transfer to a new school."

He is in an ""amazing"" school system, but the expectations on the teachers and then the kids result in a prison like situation. He is 12 and taking the SAT's next month, it's such bullshit. 

How did you remedy your situation? He told me yesterday he's still depressed so the hunt for therapy is on again, but that will take a bit. Any advice will help. Your post is dead on to what we believe and experience."
Skyleria,fdq3z0p,t1_fdpyyde,"I have a friend at work who I'm quite close with tell me how his (recently turned) 10 year old daughter has this online game that her and her class mates all use. The bullying is terrible e.g. friends will say to the daughter that they're signing off, when actually they went into a new private chat as they didn't want to speak to her.

Because everyone in her class uses it then the parents can't exactly forbid it, instead they have a set maximum time she can spend on it. If they do forbid it, then they're daughter will go into school the next day with kids snickering at the gossip they did behind her back.

I was born in 95 which meant I was just before the whole online thing at school and i am sooo lucky for it. I feel sorry for kids these days. (Edit) yeah I do remember MSN being about and facebook starting out but it still wasn't really a thing when I was at school. I'd rather go out and play football with my mates or something, and that was the same for most people I think.

In my opinion I wouldnt want my kids to have these online profiles until they're 14 atleast (this was when I discovered Xbox 360 cod4 online and wasted a lot of life) but would rather later.

I'm curious though, do others agree that kids should be banned until they're a certain age? Or should all parents of a class agree to not allow their kids use the internet?"

Mazon_Del,fdslewi,t1_fdpyyde,"One point I read years back that resonates with me and I like to remind people, which gels nicely with your content.

Never try to make light of the problem your child is having or the physical/emotional pain they are feeling. The first time your kid stubbed their toe might literally be the worst physical pain they've ever felt in their entire life. The first bad breakup for your teen might be the worst emotional pain they've ever felt.

YOU know that these things are ultimately temporary, meaningless, and in a decade or so if they even remember it they can become a funny story, but right now your kid is hurting deeply and they want it to stop but it isn't and nothing they feel now indicates that this pain will ever go away. And here comes their parent who always helped them before...and is telling them to suck it up, this is nothing, other people have it worse, they are being silly/stupid, etc.

The result isn't that you've made them feel better, or that they will suddenly go ""Oh wow, I'm being dumb. Thanks mom/dad!"". The result is that you've made them feel worse AND they now know they cannot go to you for help, because you'll just dismiss the problem entirely.

Which means that in critical moments, they might consider going to you...and then decide there's no point since you won't be any help to them."

But people studying medicine and the likes are taught from quite an early age that a single failure will ruin any possibility of pursuing their dream career. Every exam is a ""do or die"" situation.

It is a terrible pressure to put on young people. They need to be able to fail from time to time to be able to learn from those failures and, especially, to learn not to fear failure."

Last year, she was bullied and threatened nonstop by a girl that claimed sole friendship with her, threatened to get her in trouble with the teachers or with me if she tried to be friends with anyone else. I gave her all the advice I could think of, but no amount of reassurance or telling her to just kick that girl to the curb (as in don't have anything to do with her, not physical violence, just to be crystal clear) seemed to get through to her.

Why? Because my kids are intelligent and we don‚Äôt give them iPhones to play with. Relatively speaking, they‚Äôre out of the loop. They play outside all the time even though it‚Äôs a tiny backyard in a packed-together neighborhood. They learn at their own pace in a way that works for them. We have a curriculum. We hit benchmarks. 

Are my kids sheltered? Of course. A byproduct of homeschooling. That being said, we watch R rated movies. We let the kids swear as long as it‚Äôs never done maliciously. We talk candidly to them like little adults, more or less. It‚Äôs a fun family. I REALLY LIKE my kids. I like how they are and how I‚Äôm raising them to be. I see how jaded and *savvy* kids are these days - watching porn at like 7 and 8? Happens all the time. Kid leans over and shoves a phone in your kid‚Äôs face with a video of some cartel guy getting his head chainsawed off. That‚Äôs a brand new fold on your kid‚Äôs brain. 

Or your 11 year old daughter being told by the 11 year old boy she likes that she needs to suck his little dick if she really likes him. And don‚Äôt worry, we won‚Äôt have to lose our virginity because we can just buttfuck! This is honestly how it‚Äôs going in middle schools right now. We live in a huge suburban area that‚Äôs very gun-heavy - now we have to think about school shootings too? Fuck me. Combine that with all the extra shit you need to do for public school (wake your kids up too early, etc) It just doesn‚Äôt seem worth it.

I would just like to give a different perspective on your bullet points concerning statement A, because all of those 4 points would have been non-issues for most people in Germany, where I am from. I don't want to put my country on a pedestal, as it often seems to be done on this website, just provide the basics. And, mind you, we have lots of problems in the schooling system ourselves and things seem to continuously get worse, somehow.

1. For most children at the age of 10 it is normal to leave the house and go to school by themselves (with a group of friends/classmates). Of course, some people drive their children to school or they have to rely on public transport, which can be late, but then the children won't be blamed for that. So they already have a responsibility for being on time.

2. Okay, this could happen here, as well, didn't think it through that well. But that sounds like a really ambitious and strict family? I guess most children don't experience the same.

3. Here, your classmates don't live so far away. Oh well, I forgot about the children from villages. They have to be driven around... I will still send this comment but my aim was to give a different view on all that stuff and I just now realize how hard it can be for children everywhere in the world.

4. People in many states of Germany can get financial assistance by the state so that they can afford the materials for school."

I talked to other students and teachers about my parents but as a kid couldn't articulate what about their parenting style was awful or why I was miserable. I come from an upper middle class family and didn't lack anything material. My parents blamed me for the way they treated me. There were a couple of incidents I told people about that made them look horrified. I stopped talking about it.

My father doesn't ""believe"" in psychiatry, I suspect because he believes he couldn't possibly have sired a child with any built-in imperfections. I have ADHD, panic disorder, GAD, and severe depression. My brother is so severely bipolar that he's permanently disabled. Neither of us got help growing up, and both of us were punished regularly for behaviors we couldn't control.

Even as an adult, my parents have been very generous in some ways, and very cruel in others. I went no-contact with them about a year and a half ago, when I had a severe mental health crisis. Unsurprisingly, they've never even tried to find out why I stopped calling, and beyond curiosity I doubt they care. I'm sure in their minds it's all on me. The fact that they've never called me really tells me all I need to know.

Isopodness,fdqcwsq,t1_fdq5tnm,">There is no way for a 10 year old to really understand death.

As a formerly suicidal ten year old, I don't think this is true. I had experienced the death of a family member and understood its permanence. I might not have understood death as deeply as I do now, but I did understand that my life would end forever. That was the whole point. I wasn't influenced by media; I just found my life circumstances unendurable and needed a release. It felt like a logical decision at the time. 

I had planned my suicide for months, and that plan included a method and a timeframe. I did not intend to leave a note. If I had gone through with it, from the outside it would have looked just like this girl's death. I felt genuinely happy because I knew I wouldn't have to suffer much longer, so nobody would have thought I was depressed. 

The part I didn't understand was how my death would have affected anyone else. I didn't think anyone would really care beyond a passing sadness, so I didn't take anyone else into account. I could not have comprehended how deeply upset my parents would have been. I certainly wasn't thinking of teachers or classmates. I might have even thought that people would be glad that I wasn't a burden anymore. 

I guess I'm writing this because I remember how frustrated I felt with adults at the time. I felt like my problems were trivialized, as if I'd just had a bad day or a bad week. I remember adults blaming kids' negative feelings on tv or music. I am sure it feels better to think this was a rash mistake done on a whim in a moment of temporary weakness, but please at least consider that this might have been planned by someone who was suffering deeply, long term, on a level that you were unaware of. Understand that kids are capable of suffering on this level and they are not naive about suicide."
OoBigDaddyLongLegs,fdqnbsi,t1_fdq5tnm,"I think you need to really consider the posts describing just how much a ten year old can understand about death.

School was an escape and suicide was an option in the back of my mind every day.  If something unusually bad would have happened at school (getting bullied, a teacher targeting me, a teacher repeating things my mom would say, etc) it probably would have pushed me to suicide.

Vysharra,fdqrkbh,t1_fdq5tnm,"Suicides rarely leave notes. That‚Äôs a product of Hollywood. Suicide is, inherently, a selfish act (of desperation, of pain relief, of escape, etc) and leaving some emotionally wrought manifesto about her mental state to explain it to you was never a consideration. Otherwise she would have been in the state of mind (and have the strength, clarity, *language*) to describe her suffering instead of acting it out.

Someone who never talks about themselves? They don‚Äôt have anything positive to say. Never allowing herself to feel sad (everyone should have sad days if they‚Äôre expressing themselves honestly)? She‚Äôs overwhelmed by the emotion, perhaps by the intensity, perhaps by a lack of healthy emotional development.

If you take anything away from this, I hope it is two things: 1) suicides happen in clusters, yes even in innocent little school children who you believe don‚Äôt understand death in the age of information and 2) that perhaps with some guidance, this girl might have been able to express her suffering (impulsive? Where did she learn how to kill herself? Her perfectly nice family watching graphic horror shows?)

Please teach a module that uses the emotional language wheel to teach children that there are words and concepts for their complicated emotions. They might still be developing but they already have some of the most complex brains on the planet. We have evidence that people can carry trauma from the *womb*, so no child is automatically immune from the ravages of trauma, PTSD, or mental illness.

There are courses for educators regarding coping with mental illness and encouraging mental well being in their students. Please consider taking some active measures in her memory to help cope with your loss."
redvelvetsmoothie,fdqb4zg,t1_fdq5tnm,"In no way do I mean to sound paranoid or disrespectful but has the police been 100% sure that this was a
suicide? 

I just can‚Äôt wrap my head around the fact that a 10 year old would do such a thing yet alone commit to physically take their own life. 

There has to be evidence that this child looked up a guide or something on the Internet. Were there any drawings in your class or sketches that could‚Äôve indicated she was depressed or was asking for help?

On another note, I think it‚Äôs necessary that your school provides at least a day or two to speak about mental health to the students and explain to them who they can reach to if they‚Äôre in need to open up.

The students cannot by through the year and pass this up as ‚Äúsomething that just happens‚Äù, it is in dire need that adults ‚Äî especially their teachers speak about this. Even to the parents. We cannot have another child going the same route. May that sweet child Rest In Peace."

The glamorized idea of suicide from TV shows, movies, etc might be in their head where everyone feels sorry for being mean to them after, but they don't really get that they will be dead and gone. She just wanted to escape a moment that was too painful for her for whatever reason, and did that. It shows it was a bit more ""impulsive"" because she hadn't told anyone or written a note and these days kids tell nearly everyone everything over their phones.

I know you're probably not meaning anything bad by this and that you most likely just don't know, understand or realize multiple things at play here but goddamn, I kinda just want to punch you for this little bit...Not only is this kind of thought among adults why no one around her saw the warning signs, it's also what makes a lot of the situations like this even worse for the children who have problems, are depressed or are contemplating suicide. That kind of trivialization of their problems, pressures and emotions can be really toxic.

>(I lost track of parentheses at some point but it‚Äôs 5am and I‚Äôm not going to proofread. Woo!)

Good. Screw the parentheses. Yay! And look: you let go of something.

One thing I learned about not ""meeting my potential"" (being perfect) is that ""not very good"" in my estimation is actually *good enough.* And I tell you, I still flinch from that phrase ""good enough."" There have been many things I did not do, sometimes didn't even start, because I didn't believe I could satisfy my ridiculous standards. But turning in something really is better than nothing! Whatta ya know!

After sailing through high school and failing college (hey! No one explained how different it was, told me what skills I needed, or how to do any of it), I was still beginning to learn about BS (bullshit). I can BS my way through something even if (I think) I don't understand it. Even if it won't be good enough -- *for me!* ***Not good enough is often good enough.*** Sometimes people even think it's praiseworthy!

#Not good enough is good enough.

Do the thing. Ask for help if you're having trouble. I didn't begin to realize until almost 11th (of 12) grade that I could ask for help when I was lost! I didn't even know help was what I needed. So, ""Ask for help if you need it,"" wouldn't be useful to me. Keep asking, if you don't get what you need. Ask the same person(s) or someone else. My sister taught me this:

>People want to help. Sometimes they only need to be told help is needed.

She is pretty danged insightful.

So, screw the parentheses! Full steam ahead! Or, y'know, drop anchor. Whatever is necessary, whatever you can do. You are more than good enough. <3"

Personally, I'd say that there should be a sort of gradual introduction using a couple of stages.  Something like, the kids start off being supervised online, the same way they're supervised when alone outside.  They can ""help"" you do and check things, like when they ""help"" you cook or check the mail or do basic gardening.  Slowly transition from them watching you do internet/household things, to you helping them do internet/household things. Once they're fairly independant, have them choose an Internet Name -- what username they'll tend to use, what they'll ask people to call them, etc, and be sure they understand not to tell anyone their real name or address, and how to avoid giving out personal information in general.  Let them start doing solo adventures on the internet, with little conversations afterward about how it went or if they saw anything interesting.  They probably shouldn't register accounts for anything without your direct supervision, until they have a solid handle on the personal information thing, and how to avoid malware / adware / scams.  Encourage them to choose a new internet name on their birthday each year, or every other year, and give them gradually more and more independence, until they get into their late teens to early twenties.  Awkward or embarrassing incidents won't follow them from one username to the next, and this will help them learn how to balance different rules/manners for different places.

When they're ready, and start thinking about either work or higher education, help them set up things like bank accounts and an email address that's just their real name, and so on.  Encourage them to keep using the informal internet names / identities for 99% of their online life, and save their real name for important or official business."
Vindicator9000,fdrnagi,t1_fdr4we2,"This is so true, and I'm not sure why for so many people, it seems to start around 4th grade.  It's like you suddenly go from being a kid to having all of this terrible weight on your shoulders.


For me, the origin of my problems is easy to pinpoint.  I was a happy, social, and popular third grade kid with barely a care in the world.  My family moved to a different country halfway through 4th grade.  I went to three different schools that year and had no friends.  I had no experience making friends because I'd never had to before.  I overcompensated, and was bullied.  Teachers cut me no slack for gaps in my knowledge caused by moving in the school year.  I had previously been one of the smartest kids in my grade, and so I had no idea of how to ask for academic help.  My grades got bad, and my parents cut me no slack because I didn't know how to tell them I didn't understand things.

4th grade was the first time that I remember wanting to die, and it only got worse from there.

I was teased mercilessly, and bullied constantly.  They would follow me home every day and beat on me the entire way.  I hated my life and wanted it to end.

Then, in 7th grade,  I got to do it all again!  We moved back to the states.  Between 6th grade and high school, I went to five different schools.  I began to seriously consider suicide.  In eighth grade, I fell in with a bad crowd because we had moved to a VERY small and insular town... my 8th grade had 30 kids in it, and they all already had friend groups.  The 'bad' kids were the only ones who accepted me, so that's who I hung with, and I got into trouble.  I started self harm in high school.  I was vandalizing stuff... Just a terrible kid, and I felt like it.  In college, I began to make actual plans to end my life, when my depression suddenly lifted due to factors that I still don't understand.

I could go on and on, but my suicidal ideation started in 4th grade, and I hear that from so many other people.  I'm not sure why it's such a common age.  My depression didn't end until my early 20s, and to this day, I'm not sure why my depression ended.  It was only then, outside depression, that I was able to take a hard look at my life and realize that so much of my self loathing had roots in circumstances outside of my control.  I had been hating myself for years, for reasons having nothing to do with me.

The thought of sad kids is so sad to me.  My older son is 9 now, and he's exactly the sort of kid that I was.  He's very popular, and social, and has lots of good friends and hobbies, but I can tell that he's the type to hold his cards close to his vest.  I can see that he wears a facade to keep people from knowing what he's truly thinking.  I can see already that if he's struggling, he's going to do it in silence, and it scares the hell out of me.  I love him to death, and I don't want him to go through what I did.

Best wishes towards you... I hope everything worked (works) out for you."

I don't know this child and what they were going through (neither did anyone else really) but having suicidal thoughts and actually going through with it at such a young age really isn't as uncommon as you might think.... 


From 1999 - 2015 there had been over 1300 suicides by children 5-13 in the US alone. Roughly one child under 13 every 5 days for 17 years and with the way that technology has progressed since then, I imagine that has only gotten worse since a child might be bullied online without anyone else ever knowing... Those are also only the ones that actually went through with it, the number of children who have those thoughts, hurt themselves or make attempts but manage to survive it are significantly higher. It's absolutely heartbreaking but a lot of times, those children probably go through this without anyone ever knowing or showing signs. Or the child tries to express it in their own way, and no one ever takes them seriously because people don't like to think that a child is capable of understanding or feeling that way.  


I only say this because my first attempt was at age 9, and no one ever knew or tried to get me help until I was 12 and that was only because I hurt myself publicly which prompted the school to give my parents an ultimatum, ""Get her mental help, or she's expelled"". My dad tried to fight it because even though he knew I did it and I had mentioned the fact that I felt depressed, he told me ""Children aren't capable of feeling negative emotions."" And then my mom said that it was up to God if I died or not so it wasn't their place to try and stop me or interfere with God's plan for me."

HyperboleHelper,fdsxeen,t1_fdrvg6i,"I was HS class of 82 in a public school in Tucson and we took college classes during my time. Advanced students mostly got Freshman English out of the way by taking a once a week night class at the community college. There was some sort of AP English-like course for senior English that got you prepared to take your CLEP test, but was a new class the year before I graduated, so it was very new.

Another thing that was different, even though there were plenty of math classes, College Algebra was as far as you could go. After taking Algebra whichever grade you were ready for it (usually 8th or 9th), it was followed by a full year of Geometry where one spent 1/2 of the time doing formal proofs. There was also Algebra 2, Trig, Analytic Geometry, and College Algebra. Calc wasn't offered yet but we had kids getting into some big named schools.

Now, personally, I took the 80s free ride, but even in the early 80s, some schools were preparing for the future."

catsonskates,fdv61ru,t1_fduo5eu,"I had an incredibly hard time throughout school. I‚Äôm gifted and me genuinely loving learning made me an outcast (though I also had undiagnosed autism but that wasn‚Äôt the source of my loneliness). It wasn‚Äôt cool to care about anything useful, only sports and boys and fashion etc. I‚Äôve always been very artistic and had no problems in drawing, which only seemed to make others less inclined to like me (people don‚Äôt like those who get through no problem).

My classmates were nice to me individually and genuinely appreciated when I helped them understand school problems, they didn‚Äôt seem to expect me being kind to them even though they bullied/excluded me. But if others needed help, what kind of person would I be if I didn‚Äôt share my gift to help other people‚Äôs lives less difficult? Everything changed when they were together around me because it wasn‚Äôt deemed acceptable to be cool with me. I think they were just afraid of getting outcasted themselves. Some of my teachers did try to help, but they just did ‚Äòt know how. Group projects for extra credit where the groups were pre-chosen always helped my social interactions, maybe you can suggest it to your daughter‚Äôs teacher(s).

I didn‚Äôt really tell my parents about the social exclusion and bullying, because 1) I didn‚Äôt realise what was happening 2) in my head all my parents could do to help was tell my teachers and my teachers couldn‚Äôt help so it was pointless to make my parents feel as bad as I did. Tell your daughter that you won‚Äôt go run and handle things or make decisions without her knowing, and that you‚Äôd rather she shared what‚Äôs going on than be left in the dark. That you‚Äôre proud of her no matter what and sharing feelings is comforting and she‚Äôll be less alone in her problems. If my mum told me that, I‚Äôd know she wouldn‚Äôt talk to my teacher or the other kids‚Äô parents without asking me first and I‚Äôd know that she was already aware things weren‚Äôt okay so I wouldn‚Äôt feel guilty or like a failure for telling her.

Some things just felt so pointless or embarrassing to share with my parents. In 2nd grade my best friend (an autistic boy who got sent to a school for misbehaved children) pinned me down on the classroom floor, putting his weight on top of me holding my hands above me, while the entire class was around us and cheered. He was stronger than me and I was terrified. At some point my teacher came in and pulled him off me. Not much later he was sent away because he was deemed too unruly for regular school. What do kids do with something like that? By 4th grade the entire class bullied me how I‚Äôd pinned him down because I had a crush on him and I loved being on top. I couldn‚Äôt tell my mum because that meant explaining the event leading up to it and it was too embarrassing and hurtful to even mention. In hindsight, this ‚Äúteasing‚Äù was the first time I truly got depressed. I felt completely powerless and hurt that they would take such an attack on me and turn it into a cool little joke. By that point I didn‚Äôt want to be their friend anymore, they were just cruel. 

What saved me was my mum listening to what I loved to do and find ways to get me in those clubs outside of school with other kids. I loved gymnastics (which I practiced for 10 years) and it gave me confidence. I made friends there who actually loved talking with me and joking around. In gymnastics you always have to go 100%, because going half speed means breaking your elbow/collarbone/neck. It‚Äôs happened many times at practice. Running to the end of a beam to do an acrobatic dismount and landing it gave me confidence. Sprinting to what would normally be a broken bone and succeeding made daily tasks‚Äô scariness pale in comparison. I was also in an art group for almost 15 years. A teacher and a group of age peers who enjoyed drawing as much as I did. This showed me that there were places I fit in and belonged. It gave me hope for the future and patience to stick it out in school. I hope my experiences can give some insight and help you find the best way to help your daughter. Kids deserve to feel safe, loved and appreciated."

If that child was OP‚Äôs daughter‚Äôs main friend, she likely relied on the friend to pick her as class partner, to sit next to her on the bus for field trips, etc. I had only one friend that would sit next to me on the bus in grade school. She eventually made another friend that she liked better than me, so she would sit with me for a few stops until the new friend got on the bus then would move away from me to sit with that other girl for the rest of the ride.

MlleSemicolon,fdq4b27,t3_eml4h2,"First time I thought of dying by suicide was during winter break. I was in 8th grade.

Here's the deal: summer breaks, winter breaks... are prime seasons when kids are at high risk of taking their own lives. The support network that they would otherwise find through counsellors, teachers, etc, isn't there. If for any reason they find themselves in crisis at home, they can't just talk to someone in school. In the case of abuse in the hands of parents (my situation), they may fear that talking to a friend's parent might just eventually get found out by the parents, in which case shit will hit the fan even harder.

Just speaking for myself here, but don't be so quick to think of some parents as ""strict but loving"". From the outside looking in, so were mine. Yet you'd be appalled at how emotionally, verbally, physically abusive some parents still are nowadays,  under the guise of ""we're strict but it's for your own good."" However you see your students' parents behave in front of you, I'd wager is a small, ""curated"" sample of how they treat  their children behind closed doors.

And I'm talking about ""nice parents"" with income in at least high six - to seven figures in some on North America's richest postal codes.

P. S.: I know it wasn't intentional but please consider updating your language. One commits a crime. In Canada and 50 US states and territories suicide is legal.

Edit to add: I was first abused when I was still crawling. First bullied by classmates at 5. By the time I was 8 I had been to two open casket funerals (relatives) and knew damn well about the finality of death. At 10 I had already been brainwashed that I wasn't a good daughter, despite outstanding grades and never causing trouble to teachers. Always tried being helpful to classmates because that was the only way I could be remotely accepted."

It was terrifying to realize that our teachers and parents couldn‚Äôt protect us from the dangers of the world and from death. It was upsetting to find out the world wasn‚Äôt the place we thought it was and that we‚Äôd never see it the same way we had seen it the days prior. We had to learn to mourn. We learned that everyone expresses grief differently. We were kinder to each other for a long while after and we bonded closer through common peril.

Ah.. i too understand that persistent guilt :("
beige-king,fdtizrr,t1_fdtfvnh,"She had a bad life but for the majority of my growing up she seemed happy, she seemed okay.  I had a good upbringing despite the fighting in my early childhood, and the anxiety and the depression. Both my parents loved and supported me through everything and I owe everything to them. My mom was my best friend, she taught me so much and she was the person I looked up to most, she was strong and passionate about so many things and taught my sisters and I to be passionate and love openly and not be afraid. When I graduated high school that's when she started her downward spiral.  She attempted suicide and that day she told her friend that if she really did ever want to kill herself she'd drive her car into a semi.. so when we called her friend and told her the news, she told us what my mom said to her. We knew that my mom committed suicide and did not just get into an accident."

I tried not to show it and apparently I did a great job at it because if you ask anyone they‚Äôd say I was the happiest child, but Inside I was the total opposite. 
i had major anxiety which then caused my depression and suicidal thoughts. nobody knew.
I didn‚Äôt understand what was going on with me and I think that‚Äôs what messed me up. I was a 10 year old going insane because I didn‚Äôt know what was wrong with me &  I was overthinking which caused me to become worse mentally. I wanted to die.
& I didn‚Äôt know anything about mental health till i was about 13 which is why i then knew that what was wrong with me was anxiety and depression. 
The whole time nobody knew what was going on with me & i suffered in silence till my parents found out when I was 14.

elubow,fdq46kx,t3_eml4h2,"When I was in 5th grade (don't know how old I was), one of my best friends killed himself. Some say it was accident. He hung himself with his karate belt. I showed up at his house like 30 minutes after they found him asking if he could come out and play because I was a kid. They just said he couldn't come out while his mom and sister stood at the door and cried their eyes out not telling me anything besides the fact that he couldn't come out. 

So I went home and told my parents. They called his parents and then I got a prompt lesson in death. This was nearly 30 years ago and before the internet was big. So my lesson about death at a young age hit and hit hard. But it's been a valuable one that taught me to live my life. My friend's funeral had an open casket. I still remember his body to this day like it was yesterday. 

Even as a kid, the lesson that death comes for us all has helped me live my life. Perhaps you can take some solace in the fact that while it isn't easy for them now, it will likely be a great lesson for them growing up. It will also probably bring the class together more (unity through pain and such). It did that for my class. Although this is not a good thing, the silver lining wasn't all bad for my group."

Now, more than any time, those kids need to be jolted & to see that death **IS** indeed a final decision that cannot be taken back. I wish the kids in the neighboring schools could see her, as well, so they too would know the finality of suicide. Ten year old's can still be reached.

Same exact thing...No note, no sign of being bullied, she was loved by her family & was a great kid. She was also in 5th grade. She hung herself. We were all shocked & didn't understand why she did this.

Then... the truth was revealed. She did some stupid fucking challenge that she found on the tik tok app that supposedly if she hung herself she would feel ""good"" kind of like a euphoric feeling. I'm sure she had no idea she would die. It was absolutely fucking terrible. I could not get over it. I cried for weeks. I kept asking myself why? & how? Why did this happen? Why is there a stupid challenge telling kids to do such a horrible thing? These people who create these challenges are fucking sick. Then I kept thinking how? How did she do this? She was just hanging out in her room & was found with a scarf around her neck tied to the bed. What went through her little mind as she was doing this? I'm crying typing this...it is such a tragedy. No parent should outlive their children. Especially this young.

I'm still not over it. It breaks my heart. If you ever need someone to talk to please feel free to message me."

TexasFordTough,fdraqw4,t3_eml4h2,"It has to be one of those times where the hard reality of mental health and how little we know from the outside of someones mind.

I lost my best friend 5 years ago to suicide. She was 16. The sweetest person you'd ever meet in your life, had so much family and friends who loved her dearly, she was well liked by everyone and never suffered mistreatment.

She also had clinical depression, which we didn't catch until less than a year before her death. She was so good at hiding it, she didn't want to burden anyone with it. She didn't know why she had all these horrible sad thoughts about her and her life when she knew how much she was loved and cherished. 

The meds and therapy worked for a while, until they didn't. And again, she hid it very well for a while. She purposefully overdosed on multiple over the counter pills a month into her family trying to work with her therapists and doctor on how to successfully combat the depression again. 

Your student reminds me a lot of Becca. And it breaks my fucking heart. Its absolutely heartbreaking when it seems like there was no reason, and you can never really know the pain they suffered."

We are all still trying to grasp what were the reasons she could have for leaving, and what sort of emotional state she has to be in order to leave without a note. 

At first I was afraid that it was some kind of stupud internet challenge; it was a surprise to everyone as her behavior did not indicate that she was unhappy. She carefully planned it, fashioned a well tied knot she learnt from girl scouts during extra curricular activities at school. 

Why? Is it really because she really hated school so much? We are all left with questions, no closure.

I might be wrong, but think the kids would need you to be a pillar for them. It's traumatizing and I highly doubt that they know how to feel. If any of them want to talk about it you should try to be there for them even if that means leaving your class for some time. But recess and lunch is ideal, though this situation is far from that and someone might need you urgently. I would try to tell them that we all grieve in different ways and no one should expect to feel a certain way. Whatever feelings arise should just be let in and expressed. The week and month after are especially extreme in that sense, so I think it should be okay to let someone have a timeout in class if they don't feel like doing any work. Or even spend some time outside if that'd be better. I hope I was able to help. I'm so sorry and my heart goes out to you and everyone who knew her"

Isopodness,fdrq7h8,t1_fdqktme,"I shared my story earlier in the thread, but just wanted to answer and say that this isn't a new phenomenon. I'm in my 40s now and was suicidal as a child. I am sure I wasn't the only one. 

If I showed any signs at all, they would've been subtle. I would feel a sense of peace when I'd lie in bed and work through my plan for the hundredth time. I'd think, 'things are bad but it's ok because there's a way out.' I wasn't seeking attention or trying to send a message. I accepted that things were what they were and would not change. I was done with life and just wanted out. My feelings about my death were kind of clinical and empty; I felt hollow and drained. I could still laugh at a funny movie or enjoy a favourite meal, but there was a kind of mental exhaustion behind it all. I don't think it's something that even perceptive parents would catch, because I did have good days too. But even on my best days, my resolve to die did not go away. 

Also, I did not trust adults at all. I felt like they saw me as naive and easily manipulated, as if I'd believe whatever they said if they used a kind tone. I knew they thought I was too young to understand their motives. I understood plenty of things a lot better than anyone ever thought. It is far easier for a child to deceive an adult than the other way around."

I‚Äôve had a brother attempt to commit suicide, and even though that was many years ago, I still get a hole in my stomach if I don‚Äôt hear from him for a while.

From an outside observer (no kids), I think a few things contribute to kids being inexplicably sad, maybe a sadness they can‚Äôt even articulate to themselves. Probably true for adults too.

Don‚Äôt know if the following apply to this kid. But here goes:

- Time spent indoors, lack of sunshine, fresh air, access to nature, and lack of movement/play (specifically outside).

-Normal parental arguing, and not being able to understand why it‚Äôs happening.

-Feelings of incompetence at school or a sport or something else important to their life. 

-Boredom, tying into first point.

-Humiliation in some way.

-Loneliness. Not always apparent on the surface, and being misunderstood can compound loneliness.

The last three points as factors in why people don‚Äôt succeed in school (but also these have stuck with me in looking at why people have problems in life) were drilled in by Art Pearl, a professor of civic engagement at U of Oregon. 

Just my two cents."

norwegian,fdw3zzb,t3_eml4h2,"Might not be relevant to this incident, but it's believed that many deaths ruled as suicide are actually autoerotic asphyxiation accidents. More than 1000 americans die from it every year. 10-12 year olds probably dont have the knowledge of the dangers of this practice. I remember the case of a bright 12 year old Norwegian girl who suffocated with a belt tied around her neck, hanging from a door. Maybe a scientis or someone could find out a safe way to do it, because what is happening now to our youth is devastating."

My 10 year old cousin has nerf guns and I saw him ""act out"" putting it to his head, but he accidentally pulled the trigger and then started crying because he just shot himself in the head with a nerf gun.

It's not like gay is a plus in the pros/cons list. If you're a shitty hetero partner, you'll make a shitty gay partner (not saying you are). That is some seriously simplistic thinking.

I've never really talked about this stuff on reddit before bar maybe recounting one or two fight stories that happened at that place but that brought up a really amusing story in my mind and I want to share it. Was getting off a train in Carlisle a few months ago and heard some guy with a really thick Scottish accent yelling ""Hoi there, Kim! Kim! Is that you!"" then when I turned around to see what this guy was yelling about I saw him pointing at me, as soon as he saw it was me he ran up and I got a huge bear hug from this ageing gay dude who was a regular at the club I used to work at. I still say hi to the regulars from that place whenever I see them about, great crowd."

i don‚Äôt know why you thought you could invade my personal space. first it was the toothpaste isle, then feminine products isle, then the dog food isle, then the soda isle, then the chips isle, and then you somehow ended up at the cash register at the exact same time as i did. then you loitered at the front, pretending to look at gift cards. you left a few seconds after i did and i ended up sprinting to my car. you had your phone out the entire time, my mom asked me if i thought you were taking pictures of me.

i have never felt so unsafe in my life. throughout the entire time i was there, he didn‚Äôt get anything from any of the isles he followed me into. i was wearing a skirt today, which wasn‚Äôt unusual, but i felt it was my fault for not covering up more. or maybe if i had worn jeans, and not done my makeup, i could have had a peaceful shopping experience, instead of an almost traumatic one.

men, women, anyone. other people‚Äôs space is not yours to invade. leave people the fuck alone. to anyone who reads this, please be aware of your surroundings. there are creeps and weirdos everywhere. i had trouble sleeping when i got home, and had very little
appetite. i wonder what would have happened had i not noticed, and i worry for the safety of anyone else who has to encounter this fucking weirdo. i feel like i should have spoken up,  but men like this have a history of taking rejection poorly. 

bottom line, please be safe out there. please.

edit: thank you guys for all of your support. i‚Äôve taken your advice and have emailed target customer service about what happened. my dad is going to take me back so we can let the managers and asset protection team know about the situation, and i think i‚Äôm going to file a police report. i‚Äôm also going to start carrying mace with me at all times. i cannot thank you guys enough for all of the support, it really means a lot to me. if there is a next time, i‚Äôm not going to let myself be a victim again."

ERnurse12,fe356fv,t1_fe0ogok,"Hijacking the top comment to get this out there. A few years ago, in my state, there was a huge ordeal about this exact situation at Target. The people were following around young women (some with children) and attempting to kidnap them when they were going to their cars. They would basically follow them around the whole time they shopped and then quickly go to the parking lot as the woman walked to her car. The police discovered it was part of a sex trafficking ring and they were hitting up Targets because their specific demographic of victims shopped there. It happened at multiple Targets across our state and I believe the FBI ended up uncovering 2 trafficking rings because of the information obtained from people reporting these situations. As I‚Äôm sure others have said, the worst possible thing you can do is leave the store alone if you find yourself in this situation. Find someone inside who can help you and then report it to police when you‚Äôre safe. Glad everything worked out ok."

It basically means that sometimes we‚Äôre too polite or too afraid to be rude to strangers who are sketchy and that‚Äôs how a lot of young women end up in dangerous or life threatening situations. If someone is making you feel uncomfortable you have EVERY right to be rude or ‚Äúweird‚Äù to make sure you feel safe. You might end up being rude to someone who has no malicious intentions, but at the end of the day I think it‚Äôs more important to feel safe than to be right about that kind of thing.

bohemianbruja,fe4lpnr,t1_fe1yt27,"im sorry you've been exposed to this disgusting behavior at all, let alone so early in life. I dont know how brazen you, but these type of fuckers are cowards. if you find yourself in a similar situation again, wait until someone is nearby (employee or shopper, youd be surprised how many strangers will jump to protect you) and verbally draw attention to the situation. ""hey! you've been following me for 6 aisles and you're not shopping at all! I'm notifying an employee that it looks like you may be trying to harm me!"" I've said something similar and they have always panicked, and (especially when I was a teen) adults nearby would become involved. it's a scary idea, but calls attention to the situation in a way they cannot avoid.

I'm torn that the world maintains its disgust and cruelty, but I am so fucking proud of you for being aware. please understand these fucks are sick in the head and theres nothing you did that drew that sicko to you. wear your skirts, don your makeup, strut around in heels because none of that is a problem. they are and I'm glad u let target know because he will try his shit again and because of you that location is a safer place."

Act like you're photographing a product that is in their direction... but photograph them... and then make a pretend phone call to tell someone you found what they were looking for to throw them off... that's one way to casually sneak a picture."

nobrainer-,fe5ulf3,t1_fe5tyxa,"Ugh sadly, I feel you on this. A woman recently tried kicking in my apartment door and when my bf called the police they said there‚Äôs nothing they could really do because she was just an ‚Äúunwanted guest‚Äù."
AwkwardCan,fe5w9pb,t1_fe5tyxa,Wow. That's so disheartening to hear. Hopefully this never happens to you again!
pamela271,fe1pqav,t3_enknog,"This reminds me of a true crime show I saw on Netflix about surveillance cameras solving crimes. There was a young woman who was abducted and killed outside of a walmart in the parking lot but the images in the parking lot were too grainy and far away to identify the guy. 

So the detectives looked at the inside cameras looking for anyone who seemed like they were following someone or just not really shopping. Someone who was randomly walking around looking at people instead of shopping for stuff. 

There was one guy they noticed following a woman around until she met up with her husband. Then he went away and started randomly walking around again.

They were able to identify the guy and long story short, charged him with the murder of the other girl.

It makes me shudder that the first woman, if not accompanied by her husband, might have been murdered instead. 

I think you should call police so that they can identify him just in case someone comes up missing in your area. He might be dangerous."
uhthrowawaysrry,fe1rsxj,t1_fe1pqav,"will do! the more i think about it, the more i wonder what the fuck he was actually doing."

Bikerbob57,fe29hvd,t3_enknog,"Being bold enough to loudly confront men like that, usually deters them. And let's others in the store see them immediately. These asshats aren't going to approach you,  think about it they lurk behind you. Pull your phone out and take a picture of them, and tell them you're doing it too. They will beat feet to get away from you. Asking for help, loudly. 'Can someone help me, this creep has been following me, and I don't feel safe'. Keep your power, and take theirs, because that's really what it is to them.

When you're ready to leave the store, have an employee escort you to your car, if you're alone. Even though you're scared shitless, don't let them know or see it."

iamusingbaconit,fe60xz4,t1_fe29hvd,My colleague once tried yelling at the creep but he still continues lurking. Even the security standing there knew about his behaviour but couldn't charge him or so but just stood beside my colleague. So I don't know if that actually helps  sometimes... And taking photo right in front also risk encountering those violent ones to attack you instead. I'm not playing that card.

QuietKat87,fe1qqo0,t1_fe0yov1,"Or to another place thats busy.

I'm not sure where this person  is. Im assuming the US. But in Canada you can't just walk into a police station. You have to use the outside phone and get dispatch to patch you inside.

I had someone follow me once when I was in my car. 

I thought about going to the police station, but then I'd have to get out of my car.

I went to a busy restaurant instead. Parked right up by the window and flashed my high beams. Everyone inside looked out and the creeper drive off quickly."
kittyk0t,fe1v5c6,t1_fe1qqo0,"Depending on the area, you can absolutely (in the US) walk into the police station. As a kid where I grew up, you'd walk in and the front desk people were the general dispatch people for the police force of that area as well."

One morning I finally got the courage to go out without my parents and ended up in the 7/11 opposite my hotel. While I was in there a huge guy, definitely 30+ and over 6ft kept bumping into me on purpose. As a classic English person, I apologised every time even though he was pushing into me, and eventually one of the staff noticed and kicked him out. He bumped me again on his way out then stood outside waiting for me. I was in tears by the time I‚Äôd managed to get the courage to leave the shop directly behind a group of other customers and half sprinted to my hotel room. I had my first panic attack that day, and refused to go out without both my father and mother accompanying me for the rest of the trip. I still haven‚Äôt been back to the US since. Some guy with an ego complex in a 7/11 ruined a whole continent for me."

I was at a TJ Maxx that i frequent a lot and thought it was odd to see a older rough looking man alone looking through the home decor aisle since it‚Äôs almost always women, but it was close to Mother‚Äôs Day and I assumed he may be looking for a gift. Every aisle I went to, he was quickly there. Sometimes you end up in the same place as another shopper, but I still felt very uncomfortable and wanted to test something. So I walked allllll the way down to the children‚Äôs clothing section and BAM he was there. I freaked out and bee-lined across the store to the center, where it was women‚Äôs clothing and full of other women. I look up to see where he is and we make direct eye contact, as he hid between two aisles in the kids section.. and he was TOUCHING HIMSELF through his pants. I was terrified and didn‚Äôt know what to do except leave. I was worried maybe I was imagining it, but I wasn‚Äôt. I ended up calling the store and informing them after, but I wish I hadn‚Äôt been so scared to say something."

There was an incident at Michaels where there were 2 men following a young girl around and she noticed they were texting back and forth and calling. She got management to walk her to her car and reported to the police. 

I‚Äôm so glad that you were aware of your surroundings,it‚Äôs so important! Next time get someone to walk you to your car. 

I make my daughter carry wasp spray in her car, it shoots up to 20 ft, it‚Äôs not illegal and if you hit them in the eyes they will go down. She also has mace but, it could back fire if the wind is blowing and end up in your face. 

Be careful and be aware is what, I tell my kids."

skirts are everyday wear, there's no excuse for what that guy did, and while a massive confrontation isn't feasible in most scenarios if he ever bothers you again let him follow you for a bit then find a clerk ""to show you where to find something"" and while hes bringing you there tell him that there's a guy following you and not to leave you"

This is a lesson to me too, even if I am mostly in pants. edit and I do feel ogled even if I am in clothes that do not draw attention to my body. It is disgusting, these people are despicable.

Just to highlight, if you feel unsafe, just yell for help. A girl in another post was asked about the hours she would be away from her house and she gave too much away. It does feel like there's plenty to lose, being in this position and it sucks."

I called 911 and they told me to drive straight to the police station, which was out of the way and he still followed me. The police followed me home and watched me shut garage door.

This happened to me at home goods. This guy didn‚Äôt look like the regular clientele, he was in pj pants and didn‚Äôt have a basket or cart. He just suddenly appeared on every aisle I was on, or the one across from me. I thought he was just staring at my baby who is super cute, I couldn‚Äôt blame him. But then I decided to juke him out and walk toward the front and act like I was leaving but I turned the corner and stayed in the store last minute. A few seconds later I watched him leave the store. Then he came back. He was attempting to keep it casual and look around at the displays in the front, while he scanned the rest of the store. When I saw that, my blood turned ice cold. I was terrified. I thought of the worst things: human trafficking, kidnapping, assault, did he want me? The baby? Both of us? Luckily my friend was with me at that point and we left the store together. I purposefully drove in a direction so he couldn‚Äôt see my plates on my car. I told my dad and the advice I gave you is what he told me."
DaddyBishop,fe2kwdf,t3_enknog,"Im sorry this happened to you. This has never happened to me, but I know this can be a scarring situation. Please do not feel like this is in any way your fault. Yes you wore a skirt and yes you did your makeup, but so do thousands of other people!

His actions were his own. Do not let what some sicko did influence your future decisions! I understand it is scary and unnerving and you probably want to avoid skirts and makeup because of it. If you do, I hope eventually you feel well enough to dress the way you want to. There are many kinds of people in the world, some are like that guy, but I think he represents a very small amount of the population.

I assume it was a popular shopping place and that you will probably be there again. And so may he. Be prepared for that in case you see him again. If this happens again (whether it is the same guy or not), find an aisle with an employee. Tell them about your concerns. Something like this:

""Excuse me. Dont look right now, but there is a man who I feel is following me around your store. Can you please notify security or a manager?"" And then let the employee know what the man looks like and/or what they are wearing. I have been the employee in that situation before. Any good stores will have plans for this especially if they do have security. The store can then ban the person from ever coming back and if they are a big store like Walmart, generally they will find video footage and take face shots of the person and send a warning out to their other stores to warn as a potential threat.

Once again, please do not blame yourself! It is NOT your fault. If you are having trouble dealing with your emotions about this, seek help right away. Dont let it fester as it could affect your mental health as well! Take care and be safe!"

smrster,fe3z9vu,t3_enknog,"I watch so many crime shows, and several of them have started out this way. A woman being stalked around a store. He follows her out (or walks out slightly ahead of her) and attacks her at her car. I‚Äôm glad you are safe and taking extra steps to ensure yours and others safety."
ClaraFrog,fe4hyh0,t3_enknog,"Great that you will report this to the police! This is extreme behavior and you could save lives with your report-- either your own, or the lives of others, by raising this guys profile on police suspects lists. Surely, this is not this guy's first time. This is kidnapping behavior. I suggest doing it as soon as possible, while video surveillance both in-store and of the parking lot is still available. As an additional precaution against accidental deletion, l suggest a written request to Target that they save in-store and parking lot tapes for the time period as well as earlier and later in the day. Who knows what the police could learn.

I think you have a great head on your shoulders. I suggest avoiding going anywhere alone for a while. In case this guy saw your license plate as you left, or in case he has been tracking you for a while and this was his first approach.

If you carry mace, I suggest you do a practice spray, so you know how it comes out, of the cannister.  Some streams from different manufacturers come out differently, I am talking about how the product itself sprays, not how you press the trigger.  Having done a practice spray will greatly improve aim if ever you ever actually need to use it.

I used to carry pepper spray when I went out. My dad gave me this advice, when he gave me my first can of pepper spray: ""Daughter,"" he said, ""this spray will only be of use to you if you can get to it to use it, so 1.) never let anyone know you have it, no matter how much you trust them \[even guys you think you really know, you you could end up needing to use it on\]. And, it is that much harder to get to, if someone knows you have it 2.) Don't let your girlfriends know you have it because they might trust someone and mention it 3.) keep it someplace you can get it fast""

I followed that advice to the letter. Even when talking to a guy who advised me to carry spray, I'd still say, ""yeah, that's a great idea, I should do that.""

This is how I kept my spray on me: the spray had a safety lock and spray button at one end, and a little ring at the other end. I took a luggage tie from an airport tag-- those little white elastic bands that come off with a hard yank-- I connected the end ring to a safety pin via the luggage tag elastic, and I safety pinned it under my skirt or shirt on the side of my dominant hand, so that it was about 2-3 inches up from the hem. If I needed it, with one hard yank it would be in my hand and ready to go.

So once you are as safe as you can be--try to put this out of your mind. Have your plan, but then let it go. See yourself as safe.

You probably already know most of this. Great instincts!! Thanks for your great post."
SatireDiva74,fe4lubr,t3_enknog,Had this happen to me in my 20‚Äôs at a mall. It was scary. The guy followed through stores and then even into Victorias Secret. I went to mall security and asked them to walk me to my car.  Idiots think they are being sneaky.
camohorse,fe51jfu,t3_enknog,"For the record, it‚Äôs not your fault. I‚Äôm an 18 year old woman who wears jeans and camo hoodies everyday. I‚Äôve been leered at by creepers before. It doesn‚Äôt matter what you look like. Creepers will go for anyone who they think may be young and vulnerable. They don‚Äôt care about if their victims are wearing a skirt or a pair of dusty jeans. They just want to prey on the vulnerable, because well, easy prey. It‚Äôs disgusting, but it‚Äôs a thing. 

I always take extra precautions when I‚Äôm out in public. Where I live is very safe, but there have been a few times where the hair on the back of my neck has stood on end. I avoid going to the store alone at night, and when I do go out at night to hang out with friends, I always make sure someone knows exactly where I am, who I am with, and when to expect me back home. Also, when the party‚Äôs over and I‚Äôm headed home, I always make sure I have a trusted friend to escort me to my car. Some may call it paranoia, but I call it common-fucking-sense. 

Where I live (Colorado), human trafficking is a growing problem. I take absolutely zero chances. If I don‚Äôt feel safe, I go to a friend or an employee for help. Even if there is no obvious threat, it‚Äôs ok to ask for help if you don‚Äôt feel safe. Employees aren‚Äôt just there to stock shelves and give you directions to the right aisle. They‚Äôre trained to help people who don‚Äôt feel safe. They‚Äôre trained to escort people to their cars. They‚Äôre trained to deter bad guys. 

Also, friends are good deterrents, especially if they make up a decent group of people. Safety in numbers is key. Also, as sad as it is, male friends are better deterrents than female friends. I always request to have a guy walk me to my car vs another girl because, even if that dude isn‚Äôt ripped, he still sends off a very clear message to pimps and creepers to stay the fuck away that oftentimes, most girls can‚Äôt deliver. Sometimes, having two girls vs a guy and a girl attracts predators even more. So, always go out in large numbers, or get a guy to escort you to your car.

Also, I recommend you learn self defense training. I‚Äôve been trained in self defense for years. Most of what I learned is now muscle memory. Even though I know I can‚Äôt actually fight off a male attacker, I can probably put up enough of a fight for him to give up. Human traffickers don‚Äôt like to be seen. If you fight and make a lot of noise, they‚Äôll get the fuck outta dodge in less than a minute. They target the small and young because they see us as an easy target. Don‚Äôt let yourself become an easy target. Do whatever the fuck you can to deter the creep. Make noise. Call him out if you‚Äôre in a busy store. If he gets too close, use physical force to get him away from you. Do whatever you can to keep yourself safe."
Aldirick1022,fe1zro5,t3_enknog,"If you ever feel unsafe in any store you should find an employee and tell them what is happening.  I have worked security at several grocery stores. When something like this has happened we have taken the person to the pharmacy area and sat them down. This area has more cameras and more people. 

One time we had to call for a police officer as the assumed stalker was loitering around the entrance. The officer escorted the woman to her vehicle and followed her in his vehicle out of the parking lot."

gr8googamooga,fe296ml,t3_enknog,"I had a similar experience. I was so scared I knocked over an entire display trying to maneuver to get away from the man. This drew a lot of attention - which helped. 

I will never forget that day."
Phantom1130,fe2epyf,t3_enknog,"Do you remember what time you were there?  If not, you can find out from your receipt if you still have it. You can let the asset protection team know what time you were there, what areas of the store this happened in, etc. They should probably be able to pull CCTV surveillance of your visit and find out what the guy looks like. I would do this ASAP though because I don‚Äôt know what their retention rules are on security footage."
merepsull,fe2evix,t3_enknog,"I had something similar happen to me. This man was following me around the store and kept asking me to go on a date with him. I kept telling him no and that I am married but he wouldn‚Äôt stop and he would not leave me alone. I was way too nice... I regret not getting mad and telling him off! I also regret not letting an employee in the store know or even calling the police. I think all the time about where that man might be now and what he has done since. It is not normal behavior and certainly a red flag. 

It is not your fault AT ALL and it‚Äôs hard to know what to do in the moment. I‚Äôm still not sure what I would do if it happens again... I‚Äôm so glad you are safe. I‚Äôm glad you were aware of your surroundings and noticed him following you. I hope it never happens to you again!"
factfarmer,fe2mvp9,t3_enknog,"It was *not your fault because of what you wore!* If this ever happens again, you might need to ring an assistance button (or ask your cashier) to quietly call security so they can monitor this person. You did such a good job to notice this person. Stay aware!"

Glad you‚Äôre following people‚Äôs advice and going back and letting the shop know who to look for! Hope they find him. 

Ps I don‚Äôt mean for this to be patronising or demeaning to you. Jic it came across like that."
miscaccounts,fe2tvw5,t3_enknog,"this isn‚Äôt your fault whatsoever! you don‚Äôt have to ‚Äúcover up more‚Äù, and i can assure you he wasn‚Äôt following you just because you had a skirt on. wearing skirts is normal, and you shouldn‚Äôt blame yourself for wearing normal clothing to a store. he wouldn‚Äôt preyed on you anyways, skirt or not. he‚Äôs a creep and a human trafficker, skirts don‚Äôt matter to him. you could get followed when you‚Äôre in sweatpants and a shirt 3 times as large.
and it‚Äôs his fault for being flaming human garbage.

don‚Äôt be worried about wearing skirts out, this wasn‚Äôt your fault. go rock that skirt

ps. i think other commenters have told you this but if you ever notice anyone doing this again, go to customer service and tell them. and then ask to be escorted to your car. even if lets say it isn‚Äôt obvious and you aren‚Äôt 100% sure, they‚Äôll still escort you to your car. its better to be safe than sorry"
ThinCrusts,fe2w8ba,t3_enknog,"Fuck people like that, just trying to make others feel unsafe around them. I wish you had the courage to speak up in front of other shoppers/employees to back off from you or something. I get it though, when you're scared/nervous your mind just goes gray.

Some people are just creeps, some people don't know better, some people think they're entitled or untouchable.

I hope reporting the incident to Target does something, with the amount of cameras stores have nowadays, they better have caught his face. I need to keep that in mind next time it happens too. I never thought about reporting them to the store."

QueenLazuli,fe4od91,t3_enknog,"I was a victim of harassment and let me tell you something that helped me.

I felt it was my fault and that if I didn‚Äôt do XYZ then he wouldn‚Äôt harass me. I felt scared and intimidated until I had this epiphany. What would my mom or grandma do? My mom was once yelled at by a racist employer and she got up and yelled right back him saying ‚Äúyou want to have this conversation in the parking lot? I will not put up with this disrespect from you sir and if you are done then let me get back to my work‚Äù.

My mom didn‚Äôt put up with that toxic bull shit and neither should I. Neither should you. This is not your fault and I am proud of you for being strong enough to go back. I was terrified when my I screamed at my harasser to leave me alone and called my mom crying after. I was proud though because I refused to put up with his shit."

QueenLazuli,fe4q08h,t1_fe4p2vd,"Thank you, but I wasn‚Äôt super brave. I felt I was shaking and it took a while for that first word to leave my mouth, but once it did I felt empowered. I screamed at him and in front a whole room of people, and everyone was staring. I had people asking if I were okay and he ran away scared. I had friends walk me to my car and I am thankful I never have to see him again.

I carry pepper spray on me and a pocket knife just in case. If this happens again think of someone in your life that gives you strength and ask yourself, ‚Äúwould person put up with this bullshit?‚Äù No they wouldn‚Äôt and neither should you."
brenna55,fe54dy3,t3_enknog,It doesnt matter what you're wearing. It is NOT YOUR FAULT AT ALL. I have a creeper that stares at me at work in a grocery store and Im always wearing jeans and long sleeves and never wear makeup. Gross old dudes are just gross and want to creep on young girls.
KCgardengrl,fe581yd,t3_enknog,I am glad you are following up on this. The Target folks can check out video and may be able to figure out who he is along with police if you do it very soon. I am not sure how long Target keeps video. He may have done this to other females either at this Target or other stores. Good for you for listening to your gut!
ELS1002,fe5tczg,t3_enknog,"I might have missed something obvious, but is it possible he was a secret shopper?

uhthrowawaysrry,fe5tmyt,t1_fe5tczg,"i don‚Äôt think so, the fact that he followed me outside and had a camera on me leads me to think he wasn‚Äôt a secret shopper. also the fact that he loitered around after i paid and was heading out."

It was really scary and completely unnerving, especially Bc it was day time and he wasn‚Äôt following me to mug me I know this Bc there were tons of other people he could have mugged who were much ‚Äúeasier‚Äù targets. ( mugging people on the street is common where I‚Äôm from)"

Tibbersbear,fe2y78c,t3_enknog,What a fucking creep. Don't feel guilty for wearing what you want. I'm so sorry this happened to you. He was definitely a creep and was being disgusting. He probably would have done it to someone wearing jeans too.

Jogress,fe3grcb,t3_enknog,I've had a similar experience at Target before too. I was about 8 years old and was walking down the aisle with my mother.

It was probably one of the most unnerving encounters I had at such a young age.

natleff,fe48olq,t3_enknog,"This is in no way your fault. I'm so sorry you experienced this; I'm 16 and don't even feel comfortable leaving my house in anything that covers less than jeans for this very reason. Being catcalled and followed has made far too many of us feel scared, but know that you are not helpless in these situations and it is NOT your fault. Have your phone in your hand. Call someone you know if you think that'll make him leave (I've called my dad, made jokes about how long he spends in the gym (he doesn't), asked him about when he would be there to pick me up, said ""see you in a few!""). If you feel unsafe, find a store employee and make a scene! Any man who will do this to you will certainly do it to anyone else. You were alert, and you were lucky. If you make a scene it becomes that much less likely he'll get away with this next time. 
I support your decision to carry pepper spray. Arm yourself with whatever you can and stay vigilant. You deserve to wear what you're comfortable in. You deserve to shop comfortably and sleep soundly at night. Take whatever steps you need to so you can do these things! Keyring weapons and multi-tools, hell, even a pen can be more than plenty to defend yourself.

""STOP FOLLOWING ME."" While staring directly at him.

enc312,fe4r7nj,t3_enknog,"I'm sorry you went through that. The guy was clearly scary and awful. I hope you have taken at least one minute to credit yourself with the intelligence and good sense to pay attention to your surroundings. I hate to say it, but that ability is priceless for women and girls. 

I'm sure scores of people have already said this, but I'll say it again, because it can't be said enough times: You were not in the wrong for wearing a skirt, or doing your makeup. You are free to wear whatever you want, and do or not do your makeup as you see fit. It is not your job to repel predators. **Your only job is to be you.** You should be free to move about in the world without fear. 

I'm glad you're taking steps to help yourself, and to get Target to sit up and take notice. And you should file the police report. Who knows how many other times that dirtbag has done what he did to you to other people. Do everything you can to take back control. And maybe if it happens again, you go to customer service, or management, in the moment, and get help. You should have to be traumatized on your shopping trip to Target.

If anything like this happens to you immediately find an employee. Stay in bright, public areas like customer service. Get a video and/or loudly call them out. A lot of people are saying this same stuff but I think it should be said as much as possible."
LonelyKnightOfNi,fe51tn2,t3_enknog,"Not your fault, and definitely don't take it personally.He may have been an creep, or he may very well have had a mental disorder (I work with the developmentally disabled, some of them can look and appear so normal on the surface you'd never guess) All in all I think you've taken the right precautions in getting yourself some mace and contacting target. Life, while beautiful, can be full of harsh obstacles, strange psychoses, and often times just plain misunderstandings.   
But don't let that get ya down and cause you to be fearful of the world! Maybe take a martial art class while you're at it. Empower yourself, know that not everything is black and white but at the end of the day you can be equipped to take back control of a situation when need be."
AlwaysSunnyDragRace,fe568ju,t3_enknog,"This is terrifying. I‚Äôm a guy but also had my share of this. I don‚Äôt have legs and use a wheelchair, so I attract plenty of stares, which I‚Äôm used to. But from time to time there will be the person taking a picture, or following me through out all the store. Sometimes when it‚Äôs an older man (I‚Äôm 26) and I see insistent following I do get worried because I know there are freaks put there attracted to my disability and I get scare on what they may do. Fortunately, nothing has happened but I try to not go alone."
ldrandcaffeine,fe5a6ua,t3_enknog,"As someone that works at Target, fyi to you or anyone else that this might happen to: Tell a Target team member and we can get our AP guy to help handle the person.

SpikySheep,fe5c0w8,t3_enknog,"If you find yourself in a similar situation again just just ask any stranger if you could stay with them for a bit until the weirdo goes away. I, and every guy I know, would be more then willing to stay with you and keep you safe. The vast vast majority of people are normal and will help you if they know something is wrong. Most of the time they don't help simply because they haven't seen anything wrong, they are away in their own world doing a normal boring shopping trip."
Griffinsilver,fe5doxj,t3_enknog,"What a creep! 

I had this happen to me at a grocery store when I was 18. I got followed from aisle to aisle then outside. I sprinted to my car and booked it home. I found out from a friend who worked there later that I can ask for an escort to the parking lot if it ever happened again."
fredsiphone19,fe5jld6,t3_enknog,"I‚Äôd like to mention that if a store employee isn‚Äôt handy.(which happens sometimes in large stores.)


Your average male is hardwired to protect you from predators.  

I realize this is fighting fire with fire, but if I‚Äôm mesmerized in the toothpaste isle (which has happened before, man, there are a lot of brands) and some teenager tells me some dude is being creepy, ill confront him in a millisecond, no questions asked."
HizzOVizzA,fe5oin8,t3_enknog,"I was a 22M when something like this happened to me. It was only a couple of days before my birthday, and I had just crossed the street. A creepy guy who looked like a drug addict came up to me and whispered that I had the most natural boner, and that he could tell I needed to pee. I was trying to back away, but I was so scared that he would try and hurt me. It was until a random civilian walked up to me and asked if I was okay. I walked with the civilian and the creep left us alone. The civilian escorted me to a Shoppers Drug Mart, and told me how to get to the nearest train station because I needed to get home. 

I am so sorry this happened to you, OP. That man was clearly in the wrong and doesn't know how to respect women. You are a human being with thoughts and feelings. You matter. None of this is on you."
Schmaron,fe5pmyx,t3_enknog,"I used to work for Best Buy and traveled between stores. I asked to be escorted to my car once after a customer made some inappropriate things to me and followed me around. 

Most stores will have an Asset Protection, or Loss Prevention employee. If not, see out an associate. And don‚Äôt blame yourself. This man would have done this no matter what."
angrygnomes58,fe5s9qp,t3_enknog,"First of all, your clothing had NOTHING to do with this. This is a pervert being a pervert. He would have done the same thing if you were wearing long pants or a baggy top. 

If you‚Äôre ever in this situation again, bring it to an employee‚Äôs attention. People like that need to be brought to store security‚Äôs attention. It‚Äôs also possible he may have done this before and is unwelcome in the store. 

More importantly, when something like this happens ***DO NOT LEAVE THE STORE ALONE***. Ask an employee to walk you to your car. Even if you think he‚Äôs left the store, even if you haven‚Äôt seen him for a while......you don‚Äôt know. He could be in the parking lot. He may have other people with him in the parking lot. Err on the side of caution."
theonewhoknocks1976,fe5wo3k,t3_enknog,"1.  Not your fault.  
2.  I‚Äôve worked in retail for 20 years (target/Home Depot/Lowe‚Äôs)-IF for any reason, you feel unsafe, find ANYBODY that works there and let them know.  We appreciate knowing and we will help you.  
3.  Some people are just plain weird, creepy cretins that enjoy creeping people out.  Still, not your fault. 

I can‚Äôt tell you how many customers we‚Äôve had to ‚Äúban‚Äù because they outright threatened an employee, creeped them out, or creeped out another customer.  You don‚Äôt want them there and neither do we. We‚Äôve walked customers (and employees) out to their cars just for the peace of mind, and for their safety.  Sometimes, we‚Äôve even ‚Äúdelayed‚Äù the creepers exit while the other person being followed left.  

Good on you for letting them know."
skincare_obssessed,fe61p9g,t3_enknog,When I was in college my roommate and I were harassed by two men at an atm and followed home so I and unfortunately many people empathize with you. It‚Äôs so scary and I‚Äôm sorry it happened you. Know that that man would have been acting creepy regardless of what you were wearing. It was absolutely not your fault and clothing doesn‚Äôt give anyone permission to violate your personal space. Proud of you for remaining vigilant and keeping yourself safe. Definitely report this incident!

I've dealt with creeps before and it does make you feel disgusting (and in my case, angry; luckily I don't have to worry about safety as much depending on the area but still: respect is respect. Period!)

defiant-heart,fe6e9pv,t3_enknog,"yeah. had something similar happen a week ago at this store that's around the Midwest.

a weird guy kept on looking at me, and there was also this other guy he was talking to. saw him on two different occasions.

I was probably being paranoid but my cousin says he hears of these stories about someone's sister or whatever being approached in those stores."
mabb3693,fe6f5v0,t3_enknog,"My friend had a guy follow her home one day. She called the cops and they told her to go to her house since it was close.

Then she got angry and turned her bicycle around and started peddling as fast as she could towards him, yelling like a crazy person at him. He was startled and booked it out of there."
bounybeard,fe6fsl4,t3_enknog,"When I saw the title of this thread my thoughts were that you had just accidentally caught a security/LP guy doing his job. I've worked retail security before and definitely creeped a few people out following them around and while I was in uniform and displaying a badge in accordance with British law I know in a lot of other countries including America they don't have to be and would be much more creepy.

&#x200B;

But that doesn't seem to be at all the case here, fuck this guy. If you're ever in a situation like this again go find a security guy, 9 times out of them we'll ban them from the store if they're pointed out. We don't like creeps either and they're bad for business. Also the carrying pepper spray sounds like a good shout.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Also if you do get a security guard and have a choice between which one to approach in this kind of situation first go for a woman and after that trying and find a younger man but older than 25."
Jawsy_,fe6gi54,t3_enknog,"This has happened to me before. I was out grocery shopping with my mom. There were two men who were following me around. They would walk by me and make sure they got my attention. 

At first, I thought it was just a coincidence that I kept seeing them, but then they would walk down the 5-6 different aisles that I went to and it felt too common. Then they started attempting to get my attention/see my reaction, and it was very uncomfortable!!

Sorry you had to go through something like this too! Its terrible especially since the person following you was most likely taking pictures. Its so gross. What human being would do that?"

Just know that in no way is it your fault for wearing a skirt or doing your makeup. This person making you uncomfortable in an environment that should always be safe, is absolutely the one in the wrong. 

I hope that nothing like this ever happens again to you."
jwatroba,fe1qobr,t3_enknog,Oh girl I‚Äôm always aware because Similar things have happened to me since I was a teenager. I‚Äôm 39 and the struggle is real but I always aware and I‚Äôm a little gal but strong as fuck. I know what and what not to do. Next time have someone take you . to your car please. Never go to a parking lot after being followed. I had someone follow me all across town and it wAs horrible. Got on the highway and called my husband terrified to park and be followed. A guy at subway he‚Äôll I was probably 16 tried asking me the time in the parking lot after grabbing Lunch. He sat in the back waiting for innocent pray. I remember this day so vivid. I rolled the window down but locked my doors when I felt weird like I knew. Then he put his hand on my window rolled half down to talk and he was wearing a watch. He saw me react and I popped my car in reverse and he got in his car so fast and drove off
skorpianmafia,fe2s7zl,t3_enknog,"I get you being uncomfortable but you definitely should have been very vocal and loud about him following you. it‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs going to do anything in the store surrounded by people and cameras. with what you did, he thought the whole time he was being sneaky and that you didn‚Äôt notice him at all and only feeds his ego and problem. I saw another comment about looking for a couple or a big guy with a kid to tell which is a great plan,  as soon as he sees you walking over to people he will either walk away and hide or stand close enough to still watch you. I hope you realize that it wasn‚Äôt your fault and that you can wear whatever you want and act however you want and that creepo was In the wrong. It‚Äôs not just girls that get this too but guys as well. I was in a store last week and some older guy followed me and then In one of the aisles he got very close to me asking me questions. I felt uncomfortable immediately and was prepared to beat the shit out of him if he tried anything. Taking self defense classes will also help with your confidence because you know that no matter what happens you can defend your self from creeps."
StarDustLuna3D,fe1uygi,t3_enknog,"I remember one time in Wal-Mart a guy was *clearly* hitting on me. He asked for my number, I said ""I'm flattered, but I have a boyfriend, and so not really looking to date anyone else."" Like I was just trying to let this guy not waste his time you know?

He would not take no for an answer, kept following me around the aisles. ""What you're not allowed to have friends? All i want is your number."" Boi. I said no. 

And just to be clear, my issue wasn't that he asked me for my number. But that he refused to leave me alone when I said no.

I do not understand why men can't just respect other people's spaces and answers."

I was wearing an oversized sweater and sweat pants. 

It is NOT your fault!!!!!! You should be allowed to wear what ever the fuck you want and feel safe. This is a problem and I'm scared it will never get better. 

Also, why is it usually older people????"
okaybutnothing,fe4b9i5,t3_enknog,"There are a lot of good suggestions here and I‚Äôm glad you (and everyone reading this thread) have those tools under your belt now.  And it‚Äôs been said before, but I want to reiterate - what you were wearing has no bearing.  Creeps gonna creep, unfortunately.

I‚Äôm a 45 year old mom.  About a year ago, I was doing mom stuff at the grocery store after work, wearing my work clothes (think conservative business casual) and my big winter coat.  A dude smiled at me and I shot him a smile back and then went about my business.  Then I noticed him in every aisle for the first few.  Then he started trying to talk to me every time we crossed paths.  The ‚Äúhey baby, come talk to me!‚Äù kinda stuff.  I told him I was in a hurry and continued about my business the first few times.  

Then it turned to, ‚ÄúYou think you‚Äôre too good to talk to me, bitch?‚Äù  At that point, I spotted a guy stocking the shelves further along the aisle and loudly said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to talk to you, thank you.‚Äù  That got the worker‚Äôs attention and when the guy who‚Äôd been trying to chat me up started telling me I was an ugly dog and barking at me, that was all the worker needed to nab one of their security people.  They escorted him out of the store and then hung around until I was done my shopping so they could walk me to the parking lot, where the dude was still hanging around.

So all of that is to say, it sincerely doesn‚Äôt matter what you wear, creeps will continue to be creepy.  And if you‚Äôre looking cute, it‚Äôs not an invitation to creeps.  I guess it also tells you that, even when you‚Äôre 45, you still have to deal with shit like this, which is such bullshit I can‚Äôt even.  Argh.  

Glad you‚Äôre safe.  Most people are good."
throwawayimnotgay3,fe5oq7l,t3_enknog,what a weirdo haha like who stalks people
CriticalErrorka,fe29z85,t3_enknog,"There's a lot of good advice here. 

Don't feel bad for how you handled the situation. It's hard to think straight when we are frightened.

Remember that the majority of the public, and all store employees, are available to help you. 

Don't feel bad about what you were wearing. Creeps are gonna creep, regardless. You probably could have worn a hotdog suit and he still would have followed you. Wear what you want.

If it ever happens again, do not go out into the parking lot alone. Preferably, call the creep out while you're in the store. At the absolute minimum, get a store employee to walk you to your car. 

Never be afraid to make a scene. If your gut is telling you something is wrong, then something is probably wrong. Get help. 

Let your fear turn to anger. How DARE this guy follow you and make you feel threatened when you're just trying to shop. Let that anger wash away all reservations you have about getting help. 

I'm so glad you had a good awareness of your surroundings. Keep that up. I honestly don't know if I would even notice someone following me around a store, because I spend so much time trying not to look directly at people.  

Stay safe!"
ItaLibra,fe2fm5s,t3_enknog,What a CREEP ! Wish you had said something to someone. And you shouldn't have let him follow you out the store. I would still tell someone at the store or file a police report. That situation is potentially dangerous.

Next time try to get a picture or something so we can all have an idea what someone doing something like this might look like. Did you see what vehicle he left in? Once again that‚Äôs so shitty.

Iwillforgettomorrow,fdzuybg,t3_en5coa,"If it rained 5 times harder and for 2 weeks straight I would be happy.  That assumes, of course, that it doesn't result in flooding.  Although it's good news, it's only enough to help containment up here in the mountains.   The megafire here (Gospers) is still ongoing.  It's anticipated to continue until at least March, when 'normal' (I use this VERY loosely) rain fall amounts might help.  There is still a very high possibility of flora and fauna extinction from this fire season, and on a scary scale.  

I hope next year will be better, but I anticipate it will be at best the same and quite likely worse.  We can only hope the government tosses SM out on his ass and gets a new PM who will acknowledge the importance his constituency includes people not named Gina Rhinehart."

AdamantiaGoneWild,fdzko1e,t1_fdzhvmt,"When I was raped I was 13 to 14, now I'm 16 close 17. My actual first time was almost 6 months ago, so I guess it took me 6 months of trying if you don't count the rest of the years that I didn't have any vaginal/anal sex.

Maybe the months that I was inactive played a role too, I'm not sure, sorry.

AdamantiaGoneWild,fe0cw02,t1_fe02ys9,"Personally, I didn't really do anything about it and if I'm honest I regret it. I didn't tell anyone for a long time, didn't go to a therapist. I didn't want my family to know that I was raped, they still don't know. Basically I acted like nothing happened to everyone.

I told my bf I was raped after our first time and from then he is always really careful. I always tried no to think about what happened, but the more I tried the worst it got for me, so I try to peacefully except who I am. 

I would advice you to go to a therapist like u/empowertherevolution said, just don't do what I did."
empowertherevolution,fe09zcx,t1_fe02ys9,"I‚Äôm so sorry this happened to you. From my own experiences, therapy has helped me so much.

ComedyofaTragedy,fe0g1sq,t1_fe02ys9,"Slightly hijacking because I'm not OP, but was assaulted a year ago and took/am taking those steps to be intimate with my partner again.

axebodyspray24,fe04z1x,t3_ena73m,"I understand completely. I was sexually assaulted when I was 11 and every time I would get even barely intimate with someone, I would break into a panic attack and could barely calm myself down most times unless I left the room I was in. I got a new boyfriend about 6 months ago, and we didnt really get intimate for a few months. I told him about being sexually assaulted and he said ""I love you and I promise to never try and hurt you. If you think you're ready to try anything with me, let me know and I promise to be as gentle and calm as I can. Let me know if it ever take it too far and dont be afraid to tell me to stop."" I cried because I'd never been treated with such respect before. When we did end up getting intimate, I had no fear through the whole thing. Nothing (bad) happened. I cried after because I didnt freak out during or after it. I still get nightmares occasionally, but he's always there to help. I love him so much. Happiest moment of my life, too. Stay safe OP, we're all here for you."
aremarten,fe089kl,t3_ena73m,"I am SO proud of you for getting to a place where you not only trusted your boyfriend with your vulnerability, but you trusted yourself.

sickestpussy,fdztp5f,t3_ena73m,"This is amazing! It took me 7 years until I allowed a man to touch me after my rape, and the intimacy is so real when you can actually focus and not feel so overwhelmed. I'm so happy for you! Here's to healing!"

mrcrumpetman,fe90k70,t3_eo4j99,"Thank you for this! Also just curious, how did you find your therapist and are you paying out of pocket for their service? Im in the US and I tried seeing a therapist but it cost 200$ just for 1 appointment because my insurance doesnt cover much at all. Just wondering if anyone knows of a good cheapish service."
nicky3123,fe98pg5,t1_fe90k70,"I'm in the US, my appointments cost $50 a session, which is pretty average to my knowledge. Depending on your insurance, there is a number on the back of your card, or it is usually on their website, that will help connect you with only therapists that are covered. I believe there is a website as well, if you are blue cross blue shield or upmc that is findadoc.com or just google find a doctor then put in all the filters you want once you've found the website"
Womenarepeopletoo69,fe98obt,t1_fe90k70,Some therapists accept a sliding scale where you pay what you can. Find a few in network and ask when you call.
BeautifulRebellion,feaaf45,t1_fe90k70,"Check to see if there's any state funded clincs near you. They're not the best, but it's definitely something. They usually have a sliding scale fee depending on how much you earn a month"

docdede,fe94s15,t3_eo4j99,"Dude, I must say that my therapist and several other friends told me the same thing. I heard the advice but actually never listened. After a traumatic event in the end of last year, I finally understood what they meant by that. 
I'm still struggling, though. It is not an easy task since I've been like this since I can remember. The key is, oddly enough, what Dory says in ""Finding Nemo"": Keep swimming. One day, things will turn around. Keep on going forward. Now that you know that you need to stop punishing yourself, you'll notice the difference in your actions and thoughts. 
I hope you have a blessed 2020 and a great 20's decade my friend."
omegagasp,feaivbo,t1_fe94s15,"Thank you so much friend. Sometimes it's hard to listen when the mind is so clouded, and even harder to break the habits and be kind to yourself.

DELTAS7V7N,fe99s4b,t3_eo4j99,I too have been told this by my therapist.. but I just cant seem to grasp the concept. I dont understand how to maybe? I dont really feel like I have control over my subconscious thoughts that enter my mind.
omegagasp,feaia56,t1_fe99s4b,"I have the same problem, it's a hard concept to grasp and I also have a ton of work ahead of me to change my own habits and negative thoughts. The subconscious is the worst enemy in all of this. But I'm positive we'll get there, don't give up!"
withbellson,feb4rs6,t1_fe99s4b,"I feel like therapy is an ongoing iterative process.  If you have this voice that goes ""omg you deserve every bad thing you get"", good therapy very gradually installs this other voice that responds to the first voice, ""cut that out, you are a good person and you are doing the best that you can.""  And noticing but not *listening* to the first voice gives you the opportunity to let the second one in."
DELTAS7V7N,fecjj9f,t1_feaia56,Thank you. I'll try my hardest. Glad to hear you had such an amazing breakthrough. Those always feel so great.
DELTAS7V7N,fecjg0b,t1_feb4rs6,You may be on to something here. I have noticed that second voice but never gave it enough power I guess.
fake-troll-acct0991,fe95ald,t3_eo4j99,"One of my old therapists blew my mind with a single sentence in the same way. I was preparing for a major meeting at work that could potentially have had career-impacting repercussions. Naturally I was a nervous wreck. I rambled on and on about how big the meeting was, and how my lazy co-workers were making our department look bad by not pulling their weight, and how ruined my life would be if things didn't go well...

After listening patiently to all my anxious thoughts, my therapist leaned forward and quietly said, ""it sounds like you've chosen to assign a lot of meaning to this.""

I'm pretty sure that my brain audibly misfired. Then I burst into tears.

That day was the start of me learning that I could assert my sense of agency before big things like this, that I ultimately did not have to worry about things if I could choose another way of thinking and practice it every day."

omegagasp,feakw3j,t1_fe96kzg,"Thank you for reaching out. You don't need to have it ""bad enough"" so to speak in order to ""deserve"" to see a therapist, quite the opposite, actually. I believe that every person should seek out a professional to talk to regardless if there's been something traumatic happening or not, it can be truly insightful. And talking to someone who's unrelated to anything going on in your private life can offer different perspectives on matters as well. So yea i think it's a good idea that you talked to a therapist, do something good for yourself so you can stop to doubt yourself :)"

balletowoman,fe9ecao,t3_eo4j99,"Reminds me on a session I did at work about resilience. I thought it would all be techniques on how to cope, how to be stronger, shaking off bad habits and dusting yourself off after something bad happens to you, and while it was a bit of that, what struck home was the message ‚Äòlove yourself‚Äô and ‚Äòallow yourself to feel imperfect and not beat yourself up for it‚Äô. True dat!"
MtOlympus_Actual,fe9gl2o,t3_eo4j99,"""You need to learn to love yourself.""

This is easily the most common advice a therapist will give.

And for me personally, it's the hardest thing to achieve in the world.

I think anyone who struggles with mental health has a lightbulb moment when they learn that loving themselves is the key to everything. It's just. so. hard."

Catseyes77,fe9rzqn,t1_fe939b0,"A new therapist takes a while to get to know you and for you to open up.  But after a while it should feel very comfortable and productive.

If you are seeing them for a while and it does not feel good find someone else.  Not every therapist is the same or has the same way of doing thing. You need to find someone it clicks with."

gloomy-burrito,fe9xwex,t3_eo4j99,"I started going to therapy after I finally left my abusive cheating ex. I knew that when it was over and he was gone I was gonna fall into that pit of depression I usually fell into and beg for him back like I normally did. But there was something about this last time , i knew I had to do something and I managed to seek out help and find a therapist.

She was the same. Would tell me things I‚Äôd never thought about before and I started learning that I was worth more than I had been beaten down to believe.

Unfortunately she had to close her practice because she wasn‚Äôt making enough money which I understood because she was so great she wouldn‚Äôt charge her clients very much because she genuinely wanted to help and cared about that more than money. I couldn‚Äôt afford it when I began seeing her and she let me continue the sessions at a very low fee. 

I learned a lot from her and she helped me so much. I wish I could still call her or email and tell her about my day or how I need help. 

I can feel myself slowly start slipping down again sometimes but I am with someone new now that really cares about me and doesn‚Äôt let me fall.

auraysu,feaox51,t3_eo4j99,"Thanks for the reminder!

I've been reminiscing a lot because most of what happened happened around this time a year ago.  I was put through hell and I cracked after the last straw and lashed out. I was eaten by guilt for the longest time.

I've started treating myself more kindly and reminding myself that my reaction didn't come from nowhere. It's generally not a good idea to be stuck in the past, but affirming to myself how he abused me has helped me stop punishing myself for reacting to his abuse. 

I still believe he's a good person. My friends beg to differ, but what one said really stuck- ""It doesn't matter if he's a good person or not- it doesn't change that he treated *you* poorly"". It allows me to uphold the belief that he can learn from what happened and grow and be happy, but that the pain I felt over what he did to me is also valid.

Everyone deserves good things. But we can only appreciate good things once we see things for how they are."

I don't know what to do actually, but she makes it hard on me as well.. Specially that She only cares about  herself and what she wants at the moment.

So I do as little as possible to make yet another day pass me by. Revealing the truth - I am lazy, selfish and without gratitude. 

So no sorry, I cannot. A good person, a motivated person - now they deserve kindness. But I know my true worth, and the truth is - there's simply nothing there. I've been filling a leaking cup and have run all out of water. 

In truth, I only stay to keep my kids mental health stable, as losing a mother permanently damages people. I have to exist just so their concept of a mother rings true - and to be honest I resent them for that.

LuckyCracidae,el94i8,top_level,"I want to tell everyone because I am so proud of myself, but I can‚Äôt really share it with anyone...so here I am.

I decided it was a new year, and I have been stuck in some really toxic and crappy habits and relationships lately. My close friend was visiting and saw the state I‚Äôve been in and she helped me to realize that I deserve better. I was involved with two consecutive people who were really abusive to me. The first one actually physically hurt me and the second one was extremely  controlling, vindictive and emotionally abusive. He would demand to see my phone and phone bill, check to see where I was all the time, he even threw a fit on me for spending time with the friend I mentioned above....like a major fit. All of this was coming from someone I wasn‚Äôt committed to. I‚Äôm not sure how I ended up in relationships like that, but after so long of being treated poorly, I started to feel like I deserved it. I felt like I had no one to turn to except the abuser, so I did my best to make him happy. Then my friend came to visit, and she‚Äôs a very strong and independent woman. She has so many qualities that I admire and after just being around her for those couple of days, I felt like this weird fog had been lifted. She saw this person lose it on me and actually stood up for me. I was embarrassed and speechless. She was concerned for my well being as an outsider with a much clearer perspective. 

Anyway, cut to the new year. My friend has made it a point to be a bit more available because she saw that I needed a different type of presence in my life. Not that she wasn‚Äôt available before, but you know, people are busy. I messaged her about a crush I have had on someone at work for some time....I didn‚Äôt pursue it because 1) I was absolutely terrified. He is in a much more superior role than me and I just assumed he wouldn‚Äôt ever be interested in someone like me...and 2) I thought he had a girlfriend. Anyway, I mentioned it to her and she said something that I guess resonated with me. She said ‚ÄúWhy in the world would you be scared? You‚Äôre funny, gorgeous, sweet, considerate...you should absolutely say hi to him if that‚Äôs what you want to do.‚Äù I guess no one has ever really given me that type of confidence boost before, so I was a bit friendlier...basically a ‚Äúhow‚Äôs your day?‚Äù Which is more than I had ever been brave enough to say before. He was friendly back! I picked up on some very subtle interest from him....very subtle. So subtle that I thought it may be wishful thinking. I reached out on social media and he messaged me! We already went on a date! I‚Äôm trying not to get my hopes too high but I‚Äôm on cloud 9. He was considerate, sweet, affectionate. It was seriously the best day I‚Äôve had in so long and I‚Äôve been riding the high ever since. I‚Äôm so attracted to him too. I had started to get to a point where I had accepted that I would never find someone I was stoked about, and I would certainly never be successful if I dared pursuing someone I actually had a crush on. So even just that single date is a win in my book. 

Here‚Äôs to hoping there‚Äôs a second one :) 

TLDR : I‚Äôm an introvert but reached out to my crush who I thought would never in a million years want to go on a date with me, and we went out on a date the very next day."

I feel like half of the people in this world are super hard on themselves, and if only they could see themselves the with other people‚Äôs eyes their confidence would soar. It sounds like your friend who visited was able to give you her eyes. Treasure that friend.

As for the hot guy, I hope things work out for you both, whether it‚Äôs a short term or long term relationship.
Rupaul says‚Äòif you can‚Äôt love yourself, how in the hell can you love somebody else!?‚Äô (Amen!) and it‚Äôs so true.  It seems like you‚Äôre beginning to love yourself so I hope 2020 continues to be a period of growth, change, and self love for you."
LuckyCracidae,fdh9e0i,t1_fdgtau7,"I love Rupaul and that phrase! It is very true. I‚Äôve struggled with loving myself for a long time. It‚Äôs weird...my friend who was giving me that confidence, and talking me up like that...that has never been a common occurrence in my life, and it‚Äôs amazing what a difference it makes. I cherish our friendship. Thank you for the kind words :)"
Shad0WTF,fdgc3ks,t3_el94i8,"Keep going, your bright days are close :)"

VegetablesAreWeird,fdgkw06,t3_el94i8,"You are so brave! I'm extremely introverted, and would never be able to do that. Im so happy for you!"
zhaocaimao,fdgtzgj,t1_fdgkw06,"You are able though. In my experience this is definitely  one of those ‚Äòfake it til you make it‚Äô things.

I‚Äôm introverted by nature and always terrified of rejection, whether in romantic or personal relationships. Talking to strangers terrifies me. 

Somehow I ended up in a job that requires me to be social so I had to get on with it. 

It‚Äôs still hard to make those first steps of introducing yourself to a stranger, but it (almost) always works out. Most people are nice. 

I would never have put myself out there for myself, but I had to do it for work.

Now I‚Äôm in a relationship and my boyfriend constantly remarks about how social and chatty I am. 

I‚Äôm still an introvert, I don‚Äôt get energy from being in social situations so need to carve out time for myself, but I‚Äôm so much more confident than I ever was."
Evenyx,fdgn2n0,t3_el94i8,"It kinda sounds like your self esteem was hindering you, not the fact that you're introverted.

No-Self-Edit,fdhsa0r,t3_el94i8,"There is introverted, there is shy, there is insecure. 

The way I understand it is that these three things don't have much to do with each other. You can be introverted and very confident in your self. Most of the introverts I know are like this, or have grown to be confident while I've known them. 

Maybe most shy people are also introverted, but I definitely have the friend who want to meet people but want others to take that step  for them. Is you are shy but very social I doubt you are an introvert. The very definition of an introvert is that extensive socializing is exhausting and annoying. A little is good, though. 

I think your story is about an insecure person bring surrounded by bullies, who finally realized they were pure diamond thanks to a good friend. You can stay introverted or shy, but never go back to insecure."
tloz_muse04,fdhykpu,t3_el94i8,"I'm so proud of you!  Well, not really proud, but I just did the same thing and it worked as well so I guess it's the same feeling.  I'm so glad you got over the previous people..  It can be hard to detach yourself from bad people either because of guilt or feelings of obligation.  (it's especially hard for introverts like us) So, great job!  Happy new year btw. :)"

skitts_56,fdhyn6p,t3_el94i8,"I'm not very good at being social so I was wondering, what was the ""very subtle"" interest that you picked up on, how did he show you that he was interested?"
LuckyCracidae,fdi43jt,t1_fdhyn6p,"He replied and asked me how my day was going. I felt hints of him wanting to join into conversations I‚Äôve had with other people before, but he had actually later admitted that he was also shy and introverted. Lastly, after I initiated conversation, he made it a point to have a direct eye contact conversation with me about a work thing that he had never done before under similar circumstances, and slightly touched my arm as he was leaving. Slightly....barely. Haha"
skitts_56,fdi9z2v,t1_fdi43jt,"Thanks for replying that's helpful :) How did him touching your arm come across to you? because I feel like that can be creepy if done incorrectly, was it good because he did it very lightly and you knew him already, and therefore didn't feel unsafe at all?"
LuckyCracidae,fdiejns,t1_fdi9z2v,"I think the touch came because I had inched forward the communication just a tad and he noticed. It was actually like he barely touched me really. He went over some work stuff with me and kinda did a little subtle tap with his hand on my arm/elbow region saying ‚Äúok?‚Äù As if he was confirming I understood the ‚Äúwork stuff‚Äù lol. No way I felt unsafe, we were at work and he is extremely professional."

LuckyCracidae,fdh9r5d,t1_fdh0a2d,"Yes, I am an empath. My friend actually said that about me when she was here. I appreciate that insight. I think knowing that can sometimes be a vulnerability helps me to avoid those kinds of people....but it seems they find me. Thank you for your kind words :)"

Khlbmh,elnaun,top_level,"My daughter called me last September with a story of how her washing machine hose broke. She said the apartment complex blamed her and were illegally kicking her out. My daughter has four kids, two boys ages 4&5 and twin girls that just turned three at the end of the year. At the last second she informed us she also had a young puppy. My wife and I have two dogs, a four bedroom house and all the kids are grown and moved out. Obviously I said of course they could move in. The only money she would be responsible to pay is the increase in utility and food, that way she could get on her feet ASAP  and get on with life. We made it clear she could stay here for however long that may take, not a problem for us at all! Things were great at first, of course adjusting to a house full of kids and all that goes with was a shock but also a blessing. Small things started happening that sent up yellow flags, but nothing I can‚Äôt fix, this is my daughter and grandkids we are talking about. 

It turns out my daughter is a full blown meth head. This person walking around our house screaming at and cursing everyone is not my daughter! She is verbally abusive and threatening to become physically abusive toward the kids. She now refuses to pay any thing, won‚Äôt discuss rehab, and keeps the kids locked in her room with her all day except to eat. The mess they leave behind is incredible. They have three out of our four bedrooms and you can‚Äôt walk in any of them because of the clothes trash and whatever else is on the floor.  I‚Äôve tried talking and threatening to kick her out, she says fuck off she‚Äôll leave when she‚Äôs ready.

Tomorrow I will go to a couple of rehab places and see what my options are, if they don‚Äôt give me any I will try and get the police involved.  The back lash honestly has me scared as hell. I have very little doubt if the police come they will find drugs in MY house! If they take the kids and give them to the father he won‚Äôt let me see them, we have never had a good relationship. I know it‚Äôs what I have to do and it‚Äôs for everyone‚Äôs good but damn this sucks hard! 

 For anybody that read this, thank you. I just had to vent and if you believe in any type of god I ask for your prayers."
BallastTanker,fdj593g,t3_elnaun,"Lawyer up, too. Perhaps, in the best interests of the children, you can come to an agreement with their father about custody sharing. The person inhabiting your daughter's skin is an unfit parent right now. She needs her actions to have consequences. Would you have let her come home (in hindsight) if there were not children involved? They are her ticket right now to manipulate you.

&#x200B;

So sorry for all of you, including the kids' father."
m00nf1r3,fdkb47l,t1_fdj593g,Just wanting to echo the point about the lawyer. Grandparents have legal rights as well!
the-thi-pot,fdj2ib7,t3_elnaun,"I‚Äôm so sorry. For a father to see his daughter go down a path of drugs wouldn‚Äôt be easy. What you‚Äôre planning to do will benefit her and her children. Your family will be in my prayers!
best of luck!"
bnk0129,fdjay18,t3_elnaun,I hope for your grandchildren‚Äôs sake that you get those babies from her. They need you to. Or at least removed from her if you don‚Äôt want the responsibility of 4 kids.
ComplexDes,fdj66iq,t3_elnaun,I have three girls and I pray they never struggle like this.  I would recommend you speak with your attorney prior to contacting anyone.  They will know what your rights are concerning your property and family and the best way to guide you through what seems to be a difficult and emotional path.
theDynamiteJet,fdje1ps,t3_elnaun,"Wouldn't Child Protective Services (or the equivalent in your area) be a better option to start with than the police? I know CPS gets a bad rap (and sometimes they make horrible decisions) but my understanding is that when somebody comes to them proactively they are a lot more understanding. In any case whatever you decide to do, best of luck to you. The biggest concern should be the welfare of the kids (which I'm sure it is)."
PinkSushi11,fdkbpui,t1_fdje1ps,"Maybe for the children but the police need to be involved if op's daughter has any hope of getting treatment from the system, even if that means jail time."
trasha-,fdjaniw,t3_elnaun,"You‚Äôre doing the right thing for her, the kids, and for the rest of your family as well. It will not be easy at all, but it is what‚Äôs best. You‚Äôre a caring father by the sound of it and that‚Äôs at least a start"
etphonetrome,fdkfi7y,t1_fdjaniw,This. Good luck to you OP.
imadoggomom,fdjftwd,t3_elnaun,"Vent, rant, scream as much as it takes. But make sure the children are safe, even if it's with their father. They are the most vulnerable in this picture. Hope your daughter gets straightened out, and you find peace with your impossible decisions."
stormdude28,fdj5f39,t3_elnaun,"Done with grace and kindness you are doing the right thing.
Your daughter may thank you in years to come though I feel she's not ready.
At least try and get custodial custody of grand kids if you can."
yellnhollar,fdjfa37,t3_elnaun,"I don‚Äôt know, It‚Äôs a hard decision. I would be more inclined to call social services, the cops will have to anyway. It‚Äôs so sad she won‚Äôt go to rehab. She will lose those babies for a very long time. Which is good but so sad. She really needs help and it is way over any bodies head except for professionals. I do not envy your situation."
chickenbby123,fdjft6r,t3_elnaun,"Wow I finally found somebody who is in the exact same position as my parents are except instead of meth, it‚Äôs cocaine, prescriptions and alcohol. Good for you for finally standing up to your daughter. It gets exhausting and frustrating after so long of dealing with that mess and you‚Äôll thank yourself in the end. I don‚Äôt believe you can admit her to rehab unfortunately though, we tried with my sister but because she‚Äôs an adult, only she is allowed to admit herself for help."
Character_Menu,fdj4i0y,t3_elnaun,"Vent all you need. My daughter  is only 9. But, I can see how hard this is for you right now. Don't give up."
TheKimboShow,fdjm44k,t3_elnaun,"My uncle and aunt are currently extremely into meth. My dad and mom went and picked up my 2 younger cousins (two months ago) and got a lawyer to get guardianship. I am the only child (33F) and am already moved out so they are currently in my old room. They have a lawyer and have been communicating with social workers as well as attending a court hearing regarding my cousins (13M and 10F). I definitely suggest consulting a lawyer because if they didn't then my cousins might have ended up in a foster home instead of with family.

I do understand that my experience is a tad different  from yours but I think keeping your grandchildren in your care, kicking your daughter out but also communicating with the father will help. If your grandchildren do end up with him then maybe an honest and genuine conversation with him about what is going on will open up a relationship again enough to where he will let you be a part of their lives."
keljej,fdjl56k,t3_elnaun,"When I was little my grandmother did for me what you‚Äôre about to do for those kids. It‚Äôs not easy, but after about 10 years of having a stable life I am eternally grateful to her. You are doing something amazing üëçüëçüëç"
PhunkyMunky76,fdjmo9c,t3_elnaun,"My little brother is a heroin and pain pill addict. He might be doing meth too. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through this, drugs fuck up everything it touches. They‚Äôll take a great person that everybody loves and turn them into an entirely different person whom nobody wants around. Those kids don‚Äôt deserve what they‚Äôre getting from their mom and if being with their father is going to be better for them, as opposed to them being with your daughter, then do the right thing. It‚Äôs unfortunate that love can hurt sometimes. Nobody in my family will have anything to do with my brother because of his drugs. He won‚Äôt hesitate to rip us off, or anyone else for that matter. He threatened to kill me once, but my response to that ensured he‚Äôd never come around to try it. But it sucked. Had to cut him out of my life, I‚Äôve got a wife and kids and they don‚Äôt deserve a drug addict tearing their life down. Neither do you or your grandkids. 

I hope she manages to get away from the drugs. I really do. I‚Äôve never been the parent of a drug addict, but from a sibling point of view... it‚Äôs horrifying."
thisisastrangeplace,fdkd99d,t3_elnaun,"I‚Äôve been that daughter in many ways. So I think I can give you a different side of perspective. 

You say the kids father and you haven‚Äôt had a good relationship. But the question is is he the healthier parent for the kids at this time. As a father you know if someone you dislike came to you with a level head and attitude with a concern for your child there is a level ground ( in most cases) if he has the means to care for the kids maybe that‚Äôs something your daughter may need to kick her in her ass to get right. 

With the kids safe and else where maybe you can handle your daughter with what ever forces you need and it won‚Äôt be too traumatic for the kids. 

Your daughter needs her life to be altered enough to make her uncomfortable in order to change. She thinks her parents won‚Äôt actually pulled the trigger just like I did. Once she knows you mean business maybe things will alter

Good luck."
emadarling,fdjj3ru,t3_elnaun,I'm sorry you and your grandkids are going through this.  I have no words of advice...
NotDoctorPasta,fdjjrjo,t3_elnaun,"Stay strong OP, you are doing the right thing. Wishing you all the best, my thoughts are with you"
Wilful_Fox,fdjkvy7,t3_elnaun,"The sooner you do this, the quicker she can start on the road to recovery. The life of those children is paramount right now. Hopefully your daughter comes back to you. 
Stay strong, you are doing this because you care, the consequences are hers, not yours. She has done this and if she accepts help, she can get better & attempt to remedy what damage has been done. 
Life is just so bloody hard."
syntheticproduct,fdjln0h,t3_elnaun,Good luck. You'll be in my prayers tonight.
Taylor-Blackwood,fdjnpag,t3_elnaun,"I would definitely speak with a lawyer. Sometimes you can have a hard time kicking people out of the house (depending on the laws where you live) without giving them an eviction notice. If the children go to the father and he will not allow you to see them, file for visitation rights with the courts. Or, if you're willing, file for partial/full custody, depending on how much responsibility you wish to take on and if their father can be counted on to raise them properly.

Addiction can destroy a family.  I am so sorry that you are going through this right now. I hope that everything works out for the best."
jdshowtime12,fdjsdg0,t3_elnaun,You‚Äôre the dad she needs right now.

Heisenberg0712,fdkxq8o,t3_elnaun,This story hit me like a truck. Sincerely hoping for a peaceful outcome
lisalovestodd6969,fdjj5cs,t3_elnaun,CPS will do nothing but take the children then seperate them into different foster care homes. Your daughter has to help herself unless you are willing to pay her rehab and SHE IS WILLING TO GO... The best thing would be if she would get help but I don't think she will.. At least try to work with the children's father on visitation .. Is he for sure gonna take all the children ?  I just don't want them seperated .. I would definitely get a restraining order against your daughter cause she will play you.. She will lie .. Steal.. Anything to stay where she is .. Prayers.. Drugs took my niece in October and she had 5 years clean .. Drugs suck and ruin familiesüò¢
cdra1981,fdjk07j,t3_elnaun,I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through this. I can‚Äôt imagine how hard it must be. You are doing what you have to do for your family. It‚Äôs the right thing.
riverkaylee,fdjksgm,t3_elnaun,"I am so hoping for you this goes the very best it can. I'm sure child protection wouldn't want the children looked after in the manner they currently are. You're doing the best you can with a horrible situation. I hope, genuinely, that you get to keep the kids. I would love to know how you go. If you ever feel up to posting about it."
brand_spanking_grew,fdjl52n,t3_elnaun,"I‚Äôm sorry that you were having to go through this. One of my best friends brother is doing the same thing, he is literally trying to destroy everyone around him and he acts like he doesn‚Äôt even care about his children. You are doing the right thing by trying to get this situation under control because not only is she hurting herself she‚Äôs hurting everyone else and the kids don‚Äôt need to see that. I‚Äôm proud of you for being brave and doing what‚Äôs best for your family- you‚Äôre showing her tough love and it could save her life."
CanIBreakDownNow,fdjluv3,t3_elnaun,"Kick her out. It's harsh, and it's going to be very difficult to deal with but get her out of the house and keep the kids with you. If she calls the police on you, you should be able to explain the situation to them. They however, will more than likely bring child services in to the equation. How are the kids father doing? Is he stable enough to care for them. In the event of child services getting involved and he is in a position to properly care for them then it is likely that they would chose that option first. As someone has already stated, get a lawyer involved because as grandparents, who are willing and capable of looking after the kids, you should be awarded, at the very least, visitations. A court can rule that he cannot withhold access to your grandkids.   
You are in horrible position. I can't imagine it's easy for a parent to have to do something like this, but as long as she has a ""safety net"" she isn't going to do anything to get better. She needs to hit rock bottom. She needs to know that she can't just show up and get food/shelter and, and whenever she needs it. Unfortunately, like heroin, meth is one of the worst addictions. OP you might be lucky to get her into rehab and things turn around for the better immediately after that. But don't count on it. You need to stand firm with her and you need to realise that you and your wife are in for a few years of hell. Protect the kids as best you can. They didn't ask for this.   


I know my uncle told his eldest daughter after she skipped out of rehab for the 7th time (he had paid for each one) that the only thing he wants to hear about her is when they phone to say she was dead. It broke his heart. He ended up moving, not telling her where he lived. It was a long, long process. 10 years later, they now meet for lunch dates and keep in contact via messaging. He still won't tell her where he lives."
haaskalbaas,fdjmgb0,t3_elnaun,"Sorry, man. So difficult, but rest assured you are doing the right thing."
MythicalDisneyBitch,fdjms8d,t3_elnaun,"I'm so sorry you're in this position, it's so shitty when you have to be cruel to be kind. You're doing the right thing for everybody involved. Nobody in this situation is safe right now."
Rottenfleshmeat,fdjn9qr,t3_elnaun,"I'm so sorry this is happpening to you. I have a brother that struggles with a heroin addiction and when he takes it, he's a whole other demon. I can't imagine being a parent and having to deal with it. My parents turned to the bottle of rum."
tdavilas,fdjofue,t3_elnaun,"Im so sorry for what you are going through.

This sounds really hard to be involved in. This may be an opportunity for you to become closer to your wife and grandkids. (If you feel like it, obviously)

I hope all turns out to be fine. Honestly."
K8-tha-great,fdjp5u0,t3_elnaun,"Taking action. Is the right thing, otherwise, she will continue this way.

It is very hard when you consider what may happen, but it is for the good of the kids, and as you know, they have to come first.

This is very hard, I don‚Äôt doubt. I am sorry this is happening to your family."
aeigupto10yr,fdjqrmn,t3_elnaun,Stay strong. Do what‚Äôs right. I‚Äôm so sorry that you have to do this. But what you did and are about to do come out of love. I hope things go well.
Aztecrasta,fdjrgjf,t3_elnaun,"Police can‚Äôt do anything, it‚Äôs a civil matter not a criminal. What you can do is file for emergency custody of the kids through the court for the grandkids and get a restraining order against your daughter. Have her served and removed from your home. Also notify the father of these actions."
anonymousforever,fdjy46x,t1_fdjrgjf,"If they suspect she has drugs in those rooms and won't let them in, they can probably call the cops and allow them to search. It is their house after all.  A simple call to a lawyer should be able to let them know for sure they can do that. Plus, that lets them disclaim ownership of said drugs and get the stuff out of reach of the kids."
anewnothingness,fdjt8qj,t3_elnaun,"Talk to the kids father. Explain that you only want the best for the kids, maybe he would allow you to see them if he sees that?"
SW33TPO1SN,fdjulel,t3_elnaun,"I can‚Äôt imagine what you are going through.  You have to do what‚Äôs best for you, your daughter and your grand children !  
The abuse of drugs is hard to help someone with. My cousin abuses heroin and has abandoned his three year old and blows her off. AFTER her mother abandoned her at one. 
I hope your daughter can recover from her addiction !"
jvsews,fdjx98k,t3_elnaun,Sorry yes it sucks. Evict her offer to keep the kids no visit unless clean get legal eviction and legal help. It not this damaging nightmare will continue with you in it. Sorry
steffnizzle,fdjxv35,t3_elnaun,"I‚Äôm so sorry to hear you are going through that. My sister had a meth problem too, and while she didn‚Äôt have kids, she was back and forth between living with my parents and living with abusive boyfriends. They would take her in and she stole their credit cards. She‚Äôd leave and then come back crying that the boyfriends were abusing her. Some days with her would be calm and enjoyable, but most were filled with angry outbursts and fights when she was coming off the drugs. I wish I had helpful suggestions, but my sister unfortunately passed away before she could get the help she needed. We did find out that she had a mental illness on top of the addiction, so that has helped to bring some peace to my parents as they have done a lot of work to raise awareness about it. I hope your daughter will accept the help you are trying to give her, and that there is a way she can recover without you and your wife losing access to your grandchildren ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Understanding-Seeker,fdk5ox7,t3_elnaun,"As an adult,  you can't force her into rehab. That will have to be court ordered.  You need to contact the police and tell them that your daughter is doing illegal things in your house and ask that she be removed.  You'll likely need proof like video or pictures.  Don't give her a heads up.  If you have no proof,  you'll likely have ro go through the eviction process since she's established residency.  You can give the police permission to search the home for evidence. Ask the police for help with the children also.  They can help you with a protective order and the courts can order family counseling.  Both you and the kids will need it.  The police will also contact CPS. I would let them do it because they will then have record that you are trying top remove her from the home.  Otherwise they may remove the kids and you still have to deal with her.  CPS will evaluate the state of your home if you are wanting to keep the kids with you and help you establish guardianship.  Drug addictions destroy families and you are right in trying to intervene.  Hopefully one day,  she'll thank you for it."
RubySoho222,fdk7c98,t3_elnaun,"I ask that when you confront her, that you do so when there are people and support around. 

My mom went through something similar with my brother and when she finally confronted him, he went into a rage and took his life."
JerrieBlank,fdkq8hj,t3_elnaun,"Oh man!  Hang in there dad? This is going to be hell.  First of all, child protective services will take the kids temporarily, get your girl into jail or rehab.  Be decisive and quick.  The kids need rules and parameters.  If you don‚Äôt have other children to step in and help, and if your daughter isnt coming back from addiction, you might consider putting them up for adoption.  These are young kids and you and your wife can‚Äôt start over.  They deserve a great family.   All hard stuff but doing the right thing now will save so many lives from anguish and destruction."
EmSpracks79,fdkqhgz,t3_elnaun,"I can't imagine how hard this is going to be. But you know that is absolutely the right thing to do. I really hope your daughter gets clean and is able to become the mother she needs to be for those kids. 

Sending some prayers your way. Stay strong."
CarmellaS,fdkrkvy,t3_elnaun,"Absolutely get an attorney experienced with these types of cases - it will be likely be a family law attorney (I don't think there are attorneys who refer to themselves as 'addiction attorneys, perhaps there should be), preferably one who has experience with custody arrangements for children of drug-addicted parents. You can get a referral through your local or state bar association, or possibly through a rehab center (ask to speak with their attorney, if they'll let you). I can't stress how important this is. If possible speak with two or three attorneys and take the one you're most comfortable with even if s/he is more expensive. The extra cost will pay for itself as they should be quicker and have better solutions than a less experienced attorney.

You are almost certainly going to have to work with the children's father with respect to not only legal custody but their care on a day-to-day basis. As I'm sure you know, four children between the ages of three and five require a tremendous amount of work, especially because these children have had trauma living with their abusive mom. I can't imagine a single dad (or mom), presumably working full-time, suddenly having responsibility for all four will be able to competently handle the situation unless he has extensive backup. You can help with this and continue to see your grandchildren; however, if you go this route it will probably also involve mediation or joint counseling because of your previously poor relationship. Also think about whether you and your wife would want to be (or should be) the primary guardian for the children, hopefully with the Dad's support. (I'm NOT saying you 'should' want to do this; it may or may not be a good option). Are there funds available if you do this? Is there other support (respite services, etc.) that can be accessed? What about other support, i.e. the father's extended family?

Clearly there's a LOT to think about and your (and the father's) position as to what is 'best' may change over time. IMHO the most important thing right now is to get together a good team to support both you/your wife and the children. This should definitely include their teachers (who are in a position to notice behavioral issues early), any other therapists/counselors/other support persons your grandchildren and/or daughter will have seen, your attorney, etc.

Best of luck to you. You have not inherited an easy situation but with persistence and patience your grandchildren should continue to grow and thrive.."
positivityfox,fdktsyu,t3_elnaun,My heart goes out to you. My brothers are heroin addicts so when I was living with my parents I dealt with very similar situations. Im so sorry you are going through this and it's a very hard choice to make but ultimately going to the police is the best option. Call CPS and DHS about the kids. I truly do hope things work out for the best and your daughter gets help and your grandkids have a good childhood. You are so strong it takes a super human to make these choices. Addiction is a nasty disease and affects the loved ones of an addict as well. Check out if there's a narcanon near you it really helped give me a different view
kkruse929,fdl9fbm,t3_elnaun,Good luck.  Its hard but you are saving her life.  Ive lost someone really close to me bc no one knew she was an addict.

I'll add a little tidbit tho. Years ago I was very surprised to find out how well loved and regarded I was by one of my best friends. She just had never had occasion to tell me.

Sometimes we don't know how the other person feels, and it's nice to tell them.

Excuse me for the unasked advice tho."
belexma,fe5pj7f,t1_fe5ohxb,"well yeah, I didn‚Äôt ask for it but I‚Äôm glad you told me anyway. It‚Äôs a good advice, thanks"
cluelessexpecting,fe751aj,t1_fe5pj7f,"To add to this, have you ever told your friends how much they mean to you? If not they may be thinking the same thing, thinking they don't mean as much to you as you mean to them. Just another way to look at it. 

If it's always about you being the one getting people together, making plans etc people will go with that as long as someone else takes that role. I actually had a chat with a friend a few months ago. I told her how it always feels like I make the plans and she often bails last moment. It feels like she isn't making any effort etc. She apologised, didn't realise she was giving that I pression and since then we have met nearly every week and she's the one who makes the plans or suggests something to do. Sometimes it's just getting the courage to have those conversations. No one is a mind reader so let them know how you feel and you may be surprised."
Rosyredelectricblue,fe5qyed,t3_enrwa2,"Yeah. I'm the friend that Rally's everyone together, makes plans, wants to party hard on birthdays and have holidays at my house...but no one texts me first, or goes out of their way to check on me, etc. I've had the same friend group for years and I love being with them but I always wonder if they feel the same."
Less_Struggle,fe6bsyb,t1_fe5qyed,"Yes, I feel/felt the same way about how you have too text someone first or start the conversation first idk and I have had many people and I still have people on my life that I just feel a way about them and u think they are throwing dodges or hints that they are into you but when u take a shot or tell them how you feel you feel and look embarrassed because they have no type of feeling at all."
jpabrams,fecv6v0,t1_fe6bsyb,"These people you're talking about are probably just introverts.  It's not that they don't like you, it's just that it takes a lot of energy for them to be around people."
MissPandoraCrow,fe5r8vy,t3_enrwa2,"I always felt like that and it was proven when I dropped the rope.  


Most of my friends ended up turning nasty and I just decided to stop making so much effort, since then I haven't really spoken to any of them. No big fights or arguments.   
I just stopped trying and the friendship ended."
george_ganna_,fe6g828,t1_fe5r8vy,That sucks dude.
goldconcon,fe8ekt8,t1_fe5r8vy,"i'm sorry you went through that. i think that sometimes you have to ask yourself if your kindness is being appreciated and repaid, or if you're just humoring people who don't really notice and don't really care. sometimes the answer is to look after yourself and your own health and well being, to don't care about making any special effort for other people, because there is never a guarantee that anybody else is going to do it for you"

SpicySnapple,fe5qwrh,t3_enrwa2,"Totally get it. A few months ago, I went through a whole horrible situation. 

Long story short, my best friend of 5 years ignored me for 2 weeks then cut me off as much as she could. She never said sorry, and i thought she didn't care about what happened at all. Her exact words were ""I just don't enjoy hanging out with you anymore."" I found out very recently that she had actually sobbed when she told somebody else all this, she just never showed me that any of it mattered to her.

 After the fact, i have trouble trusting people, but I've surrounded myself with a much better group of friends, and I don't feel like I'm walking on eggshells around them"

ychris3737,fe9ceub,t1_fe739ne,"I can resonate with a lot of that as well. The worst of it is actually when it comes to romantic relationships and dating. They‚Äôre not family or friends and have no obligation to maintain any basic level of trust or respect for you, and yet I go on to putting them on such pedestals and spending time with them just to feel like I matter to some complete stranger even though they can be a complete waste of my time."
Bojibly,fe60dp0,t3_enrwa2,"Well, not really. I mean something to my wife and her to me. 

Outside of that, no. I keep people at a distance, I don't trust them. I don't maintain real relationships with anyone, not even my parents or other family members, nor the people I work with everyday. Just a persona so I can make it through the day.  No friends that I hang out with, chat with, or talk to. 

If my wife isn't interested in camping, fishing, canoeing, or whatever it is that day then I just go alone. 

Outside of one relationship, people don't have any meaning to me."

LeonTucker,fe7mzmq,t3_enrwa2,There was this girl i liked for about 5 years but it was weird because she was like a best best friend. They told me they liked me but i found out they didn't so i totally understand what you mean. I guess some people don't realise how much people care until they don't have it anymore
Elaw00d,fe8281e,t3_enrwa2,"I heavily relate to this atm.

Me and my best friend planned on going to Japan with each other which eventually turned into a group holiday. I was fine with that, as long as I could spend my time with her. She was my priority. After realising that I actually liked her, we started seeing each other but she wouldnt give the same energy back, not meeting up because she‚Äôs tired etc but would meet other friends. She then decided to split the group so she can chill with other people and avoid other people also coming on the holiday, leaving me with the other group. She doesn‚Äôt care about me anymore, even though I gave her my best. I find it sad that the people you trusted for the longest time stabs you in the back."

However, I try to check up on all my friends in our circle when I can, especially the one who‚Äôs always going above and beyond for everyone else. Even your seemingly toughest friends need to be reminded that they don‚Äôt need to be Superman/woman all the time and you have their back."
EndMeRighteously,fe8tekj,t3_enrwa2,"I understand completely. It used to be a fear/insecurity of mine that my friends didn't like me. A few years ago, that fear was validated by people who I thought I could call my friends. I went through a deep depression that lasted over a year. 

At the end I was able to move on and I made new friends. I made friends who would tell me, unprompted, that they were glad to be my friend. I had friends who fought tooth and nail to get me to go out with them, even when I would shoot them down multiple times because I wanted to keep myself locked away from other people. My advice is to find friends that you can know without a doubt like you as much as you like them."
bunt4ro,fe90u6b,t3_enrwa2,"i often actually feel the opposite. im a diagnosed sociopath and get a bit uncomfortable thinking about how people have stronger connections to me than ill ever have to them.

i have many really really amazing friends, but when it comes to every relationship i have (familial or platonic or romantic) i find that i dont have deep Connections to them. For example, i love my friends a lot but if one of my friends suddenly never talked to me again i wouldnt feel anything. It would simply be the past and i wouldnt ever think about it again. It makes me and others depressed when it comes to how hard it is for me to Care about bonding and keeping relationships. 

i just wish that i had a genuine feeling keeping me grounded to the people i know and love."

rKakki,fe95emp,t3_enrwa2,yea thats why im not emotionally attached to anyone. not a good strategy i gotta say but better than suffer for others.
Zephyr-in-the-West,fe968ph,t3_enrwa2,"I totally get this. I would always be the one reaching out and actively pursuing friendships. I had to limit contacting people to chat or invite them to stuff because they would never contact me back. Or worse, they were only contacting me so they could trick me into doing stuff for them nobody else would.

I found that valuing my time and abilities ends the bad friendships quickly."
weird-potato66,fe96l8s,t3_enrwa2,All the time.
Koala181,fe9e0bz,t3_enrwa2,Your not the only one and it sucks
brianar11,fe9wite,t3_enrwa2,"Absolutely. my ""best friend"" which is an odd term but, she's my ""best"" friend yet she doesn't ever care about me.  she only messages me when something with her and a boy happened and I dont even always get that, I can message her a funny video or simple hey how are u and I get no response or a zero effort one word response. But to her shes perfect, and im the one who's always acting weird. it sucks! I think about her everyday not in a bad way but just like if something reminds me of her or if something happens and id like to tell her which now I dont because there's no point, but I dont think she remembers im here half of the time. makes me very depressed. But the highs are high and the lows are low and I can't seem to cut it off because I excuse the lows for the highs. I did decide though that im going to stop reaching out, so far thats lead to no communication but maybe thats what I need to stop caring about her."
pinkchestnut,fea5gi5,t3_enrwa2,"Yes, it's tough.. I don't want to give too much because of that."
makethevoicesquiet,fe6smy8,t3_enrwa2,Yep. Recently with though this with one of my best friends. I noticed more and more that it was me making all the effort. I texted her asking if she actually wanted to be my friend and no answer. I didn‚Äôt hear from her from 2 months and then one day she randomly contacted me apologizing for being a crappy friend but then continued being a crappy friend. Now it‚Äôs been a couple months since we even last spoke. Honestly though it‚Äôs better this way. We shouldn‚Äôt settle for crappy one-sided friendships. I realized I deserve better. Even if it means way less friends. One great friend is really all you need.

Fairyunderthefount,em58kf,top_level,"I wrote an AmA last night which gained some traction and many people wanted to know my story, I had a few other details that I wanted to share I felt a need to get it off my chest. 

I was in my first year of college when I met a boy in the city I was had moved to. I had a shitty childhood spent at foster homes and I didn't get on well with my foster parents, I was out of that town and had met a really great guy. At first we got on great and went on a few dates we became a couple... 

He was kind, charming and I genuinely thought I loved him. He told me that he worked for a startup IT company which ran a website and spent alot of time traveling for clients and such. Over the next few months of dating he took my virginity and we talked of working together, he offered to bring me on a business trip and show me his job. We were going to the other side of the country and we were going to road trip. I was so excited, and I genuinely felt I was in love.

Being a penniless college student at the time he paid for everything, motels, food and gas. About four days into the road trip he stopped the car in the middle of nowhere he then pulled a gun on me and his whole demeanor changed. He said a man was coming to take me away and he said that he had sold me over the dark web as a sex slave. He then put a cloth over my mouth and I soon passed out. I woke up in a room and a stranger told me that I now owed him the price that he paid for me and I was to work for him in his brothel and strip club until I paid the debt. He said that my name was now Estelle while I was his, my fucking name changed by another human being. He then raped me and then tied me down and branded me on the bottom of my foot to hide the burns. He then threatened to hurt my friends and knew I had two sisters and would hurt them too. 

After two years of being, abused, forced to take drugs, developing a serious drug habit which only made my debt spiral out of control and selling my body just to survive. I managed to escape the life after being arrested for posession and I was brave enough to tell the police what had happened to me, my pimp and ex where both arrested and imprisoned. I checked into rehab and went back to school. I ended up leaving the country for a fresh start but fell quickly fell into old habits as I couldn't find a job. I started doing escort work and working as a web cam girl to pay for my tuition, I became Estelle again, a name that I fucking hated, I chose to use the name professionally as a massive fuck you to the world. I refused to take drugs so I began to start drinking heavily. My lowest point was when i learned that one of my friend from the brothel and also someone who was kidnapped had taken her own life. I hated myself, I couldn't stop selling my body while I was captive, i couldnt stop selling my body if i was free. Everything i did to kill the pain ended in just more pain, addiction and sadness. 

I knew I needed to stop selling my body, shake the addiction and get my life on track and while I didnt do drugs at this time I was scared shitless of relapsing to that as well. Fortunately a friend helped me get a job as an admin temp at her work, which I excelled in, and after a few months my manager put me on permenantly! I also started working out at my local crossfit, which helped me kill my drinking.

I also met this guy at work... another IT guy ironically and after about a year of working together we started dating, this time it was completely different. He respected me and he accepted my past.  Not only did he say that but he fucking proved it!

I never knew relationships could be this good. I get to share my life intimatly with someone so kind, sweet and gentle. I also have learned that sex is something that I get to enjoy and not use to survive and have began to enjoy it for the first time in my life. I had been so scared of not finding a partner, I felt no one can get below me, I am the lowest as far as girlfriend/wife potential goes. But when I least expected it, I found the love of my life. We've been together for over three years and we are getting married at the end of this year. I never thought love could be this good!

I still struggle with my past, but I just try to get through each day and remind myself that I am a clean, respectable, hard working woman, who is loved by friends, sisters and a magnificant man. I am a survivor and a fucking fit warrior goddess!"

You're story is so heartbreaking but inspiring as well. You should write a book (only if you're comfortable too obviously don't mean to sound rude in any way) but write it so others who have suffered though the same can see that they too cab be happy and have an amazing life and that they should love themselves so another can love them as much as they deserve. I Can't imagine how hard you worked to achieve your goals with so much trying to pull you back ans keep you down it really just amazes me Some one can be so strong.

I started taking vitamin D3 as recommended by my doctor for skin issues, digestive issues, and depression and it has made a world of difference. If you still need a bit more help in coming days, i highly recommend it. The sunlight vitamin!!

But doesn't it feel so good?! Keep the momentum going. Proud of you!!"

Before you know it you will be cleaner and more organized too!  Like my closet all jans and pants hang in one section. Tops in another, sweaters, jackets, etc it make it easier to find what your looking for and saves sooo much time! Good luck to all clean2020!"

I am happy for you, I know how hard the battle can get and the shame/guilt that follows. Feels great to have done it, hah? Try to form a habit of it, set some time on the weekend, cleaning regularly will make it less of a burden. Don‚Äôt be harsh on yourself when you can‚Äôt follow through, it will happen, just don‚Äôt give up. I think it will make you feel better, the burden that you‚Äôve felt lifted will make some room for more joys in life."

FalafelsOnWaffles,fe60eqg,t3_eno95k,"Cleaning a room and finishing it is like holding your pee and finally going to the bathroom. The relief is amazing. I need to clean my room, but I've kept putting everything off as soon as I get home from school recently. Turns out I've got an iron deficiency anemia. It had been making me more lethargic and tired every day. I was weak. Not really an excuse, but it made things harder. Today was the worst, I didn't want to leave my bed and I've been stumbling around a lot. It was as if I was in molasses. My dad finally got me some iron supplements so things will probably get better. Might not be depression, but I feel I can relate and understand in some way. I know how hard it can be to complete what seems like a simple task. If I could I'd give you a high five right now. I think I might clean my room tomorrow."

Karjo2000,en0lq3,top_level,"When I was in high school, I worked at an assisted living facility as a dietary aide. It was a tough job full of emotional labor, but I really did enjoy it, particularly when it came to the residents themselves. One resident in particular became one of my closest friends. She was incredibly hard-of-hearing and it was very hard to discern her words when she spoke, so very few residents and workers paid her any mind. She always seemed a bit isolated, so I tried to let her know that I noticed her, usually by smiling at her and telling her hello, et cetera. She was one of the sweetest, warmest people I've ever met, always eager to greet me with a hug at the beginning of my shift and to tell me about her day. Over the next few months we became incredibly close, always chatting after I had clocked out, usually about my academics or her family-- while she had no friends and was unmarried, she loved her family dearly and was always excited for when they came to visit, which was less frequently than she (or they) would have liked. As an autistic teen, I could relate to the feelings of loneliness and isolation that she felt, and as weird as it sounds, I think that we really relied on each other for comfort.   


About 3 years after starting my job and becoming friends with her, I had graduated high school and community college, and was preparing to move about 8 hours away for university. I told her I would be moving a few months before I left, and while it was difficult for both of us, we both understood that it had to happen. I gave her my mailing address for my dorm so that we could write letters to each other (she didn't have a smartphone, and since her hearing was so poor, talking on the phone wouldn't work). My last day at work was bittersweet. I received a lot of hugs and wishes for good luck from my residents, but after clocking out, I was given one last hug from my best friend. We stood there in the hallway, hugging and crying-- everyone understood why. I told her that I would come visit for Christmas, and that we could write to each other in the meantime. Leaving work that day was one of the hardest things I've ever had to force myself to do.  


She and I wasted no time-- almost a week after moving, we started writing letters to each other. She would write about how much she loved me, and how excited she was to see me again. I loved hearing from her, and her letters really comforted me in such a lonely time. The only problem was her handwriting-- the mailman had trouble reading her envelopes, so her letters would usually come in a few weeks after she sent them. I was worried at first after not hearing from her, but I soon became accustomed to the longer waits. I couldn't shake the worried feeling altogether, though. She was in her mid-90s and had begun writing about how she was feeling sicker than usual. Thankfully, I'm still in touch with my old co-workers, including a few CNAs, so I knew they would take good care of her and let me know if something happened.  


I was already starting to book my hotel back home when I got the news-- my friend had died. I don't know what happened, and I didn't bother to ask. I was devastated, despite knowing that it was probably just her time to go. I was mostly upset that we didn't get to see each other for Christmas-- something that she had been looking forward to since spring. I wished I could have been there with her in her final moments.   


It's been a little under a month since she died. I ended up not going home for Christmas and instead staying in my dorm. I try to keep a positive outlook when it comes to death; I tried to remind myself that she lived a long, happy life. That helped me recover from the grief and sadness relatively quickly. I still think about her every day, however. I just try to think about how strong our friendship was, and how we helped each other with our company.   


Today when I checked my mail, my heart sank. It was a letter from her, dated only about a week before her passing. I could barely choke back tears as I ran back to my apartment to read it. She wrote about how much she loved me, and how excited she was to see me ""soon"". She wrote about how she was so excited to give me a big hug on Christmas. Instead of feeling distraught, I almost felt a strange sense of comfort while reading it. It was almost like we really did get to see each other one last time before she left. It's a weird feeling-- I know I should be crying, but I feel incredibly happy. Not because she's gone, but because I had the privilege of knowing her. I'm not religious by any means, but I almost feel like she's watching over me.   


Thank you for everything, Clara. Rest in peace."

Awanderer1991,fdu3us9,t3_en0lq3,"My hope for you is that you can see her in your dreams. My dad passed away in 2014. It's been rough. It doesn't happen often, but every couple of months or so I have a dream about him. He never says anything in my dreams, but I talk and catch him up on my life. We often go for a hike together, like we did when I was growing up, so we're surrounded by forests and mountains, or slot canyons in the desert. I always get a long tight hug from him before I wake up, and I wake up feeling like I just saw him in real life and had a great visit with him. I hope you find your friend in your dreams too."

angry-orchid,elo8yn,top_level,"This is too disgustingly cute to admit to people I actually know but TL;DR: my cat recognized my long distance bf from his singing 

My cat is VERY shy and scared of any people or noise. My bf, who lives several thousand miles away, is an INCREDIBLE singer. He hadn‚Äôt ever met my cat, but would meow to her over the phone, hoping he‚Äôd win her over. She was concerned by the meowing, but when he started singing on the phone one day, she was so delighted that she knocked the phone out of my hand, nuzzling it while purring and chirping. She gravitated to the phone whenever he was singing, and sometimes ran and sat on my lap if she heard his voice at ALL.

Then the bf came to visit for the holidays and she was TERRIFIED by the stranger in the house for a full day. The morning after he arrived, I was getting ready and he was downstairs singing while waiting for me. As soon as he started singing, the cat jumped up and RAN down the stairs to him, let him pet her, and sat next to him in total delight while he sang to her.

She‚Äôs very selective about people, so I‚Äôm taking this as a good sign."
iamatriffid18,fdjcyz1,t3_elo8yn,Cats know what's what. Your boyfriend must be a great guy.
spillbv,fdjh7gd,t3_elo8yn,"This is lovely. I used to sing to my cats when they were kittens, and to one of them in particular, who liked to lie on my chest while I lay down and sang. Now that they're grown up, his brother couldn't care less if I was singing but he still likes to lie down and, I guess, feel the vibrations as I sing. I wish I could know what that feels like to him!"

killjoy_x,elldgh,top_level,"So this is something that has been bugging me for a while when it comes to SOME lgbtq+ members. 

It‚Äôs great that you‚Äôve found who you are and are happy with it. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with that in any way. It‚Äôs great, and it‚Äôs great if you want to celebrate that. But you don‚Äôt have to keep talking about it all the time. Cause after a while it‚Äôs gonna get old and frankly, obnoxious. 

Like yes, I get it, you‚Äôre gay and proud and that‚Äôs great. But honestly, I don‚Äôt care. I don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre gay, straight, pan, trans, whatever. If that‚Äôs the only thing you can talk about, then that makes you a pretty boring shell of a person. 

Take me for example, I‚Äôm bi and I don‚Äôt go around mentioning it to everybody around me every single day, and keep referencing it. I barely even tell anyone, it‚Äôs just one tiny part of me. There is so much more to a person than their sexuality. And it‚Äôs kind of hard to have a normal conversation with someone when they keep talking about ‚Äúgay this and gay that‚Äù all the time, and always steer the conversation to something sexuality/gender related.

EDIT: I just wanna clear something up that some people might have gotten wrong. I‚Äôm not saying that it‚Äôs not okay to talk about your partner or something like that. It‚Äôs more that some people like to take just ONE thing about themselves and make it into their whole identity. This doesn‚Äôt only apply to lgbtq people, but this post was more aimed at them because it‚Äôs the group of people that I have seen be most obnoxious about it. 
But this might as well apply to, let‚Äôs say, stoners. Again, if you make your whole existence about smoking weed and 4/20, always sneak it into conversations and keep making weed jokes, then guess what? You‚Äôre equally as empty. Find a damn hobby, pal."
my_account_8,fdisxsg,t3_elldgh,"this isn't just limited to the LGBTQ community- potheads are like this, sports fans are like this, motorcycle enthusiasts are like this- it's really gross imo when someone chooses a single facet of an identity and makes it their ENTIRE identity... like they're some sort of NPC and only have one character trait"
killjoy_x,fdit4ny,t1_fdisxsg,"You‚Äôre right on that, I completely agree. I guess for me the lgbtq just stood out from the others cause it‚Äôs what I see most often."
PatheticWasteOfALife,fdj4rg2,t1_fdisxsg,"Yeah I agree, I think with things like sports they're so ubiquitous that we just don't think about it though."
Spooky_Tree,fdj5yxr,t1_fdisxsg,"That reminded me so much of my pot head co-worker that decided we were close friends, and has no idea how fucking annoying she is. At one point I mentioned that I've never done any kind of drugs, because it pertained to the conversation, and she replies with ""will I'm gonna change that real quick!"" Like no, you're not, just leave me alone."
stranger_than_fishin,fdiwagw,t1_fdisxsg,"I'm glad you mentioned this, I was thinking the same thing. I'd say it's very true for potheads especially. I've learned to just accept that people are going to be what they are. Sometimes is annoying to me and I'll try to find common interests or just spend less time with them."
-Chris_Davies-,fdjcl7f,t1_fdisxsg,"You‚Äôre sooo right about potheads. Believe me I love to smoke, but its never the topic I bring up. Other friends I have constantly revolve around it. Whether its different strains, different ways of smoking or best high experiences. Noone gives a fuck. Its weed. Its personal preference and how you wanna smoke and what u wanna do when your baked. So I dont care when ppl keep pushing their ‚Äúspecial and revolutionary piece of knowledge‚Äù."
CanIBreakDownNow,fdjmp54,t1_fdj5yxr,"Man, I love my weed. But unless someone else has brought it up first, I'm not telling anyone about it. And then, what the hell is with these people who are like ""oh, you don't, well I'm going to change that"". Fuck off right to hell. Alcohol is the absolute worst, ""do you want another drink"". Um, no thanks, I've enough. ""Unacceptable, here's another drink"". And then I'm the bad person because they paid for a drink I said I didn't want and now I'm not going to drink it. Man, there are way too many ""adults"" who need to grow up!"
callisiarosato,fdjbwqn,t3_elldgh,"i read something once that compared the way people often act just after coming out as a second adolescence. a lot of people can't be their true selves when they're going through actual adolescence, so when they finally figure out who they are, that excitement can come out in some awkward, teenager-like ways.

i know it's true for me - when i moved away from my homophobic family i had a phase where i couldn't talk about anything but how a) i got away from my abusive family and b) i was *gay*, and i didn't have to hide it. it's a lot less of a novelty to me now."
suenologia,fdjm1ri,t1_fdjbwqn,"was going to mention this. identifying part of one‚Äôs identity is a process for people and part of that process is *becoming* the identity and being consumed by it. everyone is at different stages and while it might seem annoying (especially if you‚Äôve already been through it) for someone to act like they have one singular personality trait, it may be that they‚Äôre just enthusiastic about having found something about themselves that they *can* share with the world; so they do. once they‚Äôve gotten comfortable, they usually stop talking about it and start merging whatever it is with the rest of their identity.

that being said, sometimes queer people who don‚Äôt know a lot of other queer people *really* ramp up the LGBT+ identity when they meet someone like them because *no one else would understand what they‚Äôre talking about* ‚Äì again it comes from a place of comfort and enthusiasm."
InOutUpDownLeftRight,fdjhgee,t3_elldgh,I hate coworkers who only talk shop after work. I am done working Bob- give it a rest. Work isn't my identity.
Unfair-Introduction,fdj6orw,t3_elldgh,"as someone who is bi too, i completely agree. people who generally make one thing their whole personality (like an orientation or even dumb stuff like smoking weed or constantly screwing around) are typically super narcissistic. It's super annoying too because there's so many people like that who take it upon themselves to try and represent a whole group of people. Usually they're so narcissistic that honestly it spreads more bigotry/hatred in any parties involved :( But however I don't think just a gay man casually bringing up his boyfriend would count like this. I'm directing at people who only wear pride shirts,make every political statement about homophobia, and act like being gay is some xbox 360 achievement."
SpookyAlchemist,fdjbvem,t3_elldgh,"I've noticed a lot of young people I know so this, but it always seems as some sort if self-acceptance/coping mechanism. I see it less in older folks."
C282,fdipvpz,t3_elldgh,I understand this 100% I‚Äôm a gay man and my sexuality is the last thing I ever talk about in fact I never talk about it unless I‚Äôm asked about it. The lgbt+ community has so many different levels it‚Äôs unreal. I always say you have rupual drag race gay and casual gays. One insist on announcing there sexuality to there entire Facebook feed and the casual gay could care less if people know or not. Some would say i have internalized homophobia and to that I would say there‚Äôs just different types of gays. As I always say though what ever floats ya boat.
hepatitisF,fdjjij5,t1_fdipvpz,"I completely agree. Regardless of the fact that rupaul drag race gays are gay men, their personality is obnoxious. Whether they were gay women or straight men or straight women or trans people non binary or anything else, being super loud and dramatic the way they are (at least on the show) is obnoxious. Just because they are a protected group (and should be) doesn‚Äôt mean those types should be free from criticism about their demeanor"
tacokato,fdjjjif,t3_elldgh,"There was a thought provoking post about a man who gives LGBTQ+ extra space and time. It talked about how marginalized groups kind of have two identities. Their vulnerable self, and the defense self they put up as a protection. Eventually when the person ages, they have to pick which aspects of each to keep as their identity. While the older gays may have it figured out I think it‚Äôs kind to let the younger gays do so too."
garbagecanmonster,fdipknn,t3_elldgh,I find that ppl who say stuff like this don‚Äôt realize just how often hets talk about being straight so when gays do it the same amount they think we‚Äôre being excessive. If I legitimately I told my straight friends to stop talking about being straight every time they bring up their boyfriend or whatever in casual conversation I‚Äôd come off as a rude asshole.
MrYondaime,fdiwnda,t1_fdipknn,"Funny that when society used to look at gay people they would only focus on that feature. Ricky Martin? Well that's that gay singer. Your cousin is gay? People will refer to him as ""the gay cousin"". People made so that gay people where labeled for being gay and not by other defining features. Now that some people are ""gay and proud"" they're like ""well we know you are gay, but you don't need to be so gay all the time!""."
killjoy_x,fdipwr2,t1_fdipknn,"It‚Äôs one thing talking about your relationship, problems, hardships or even positive aspects of things. But it‚Äôs another to just plainly talk about your sexuality, to just keep making the same ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gay, and this is funny because gay‚Äù jokes or references."
thatHiddenDarkness,fdjizcs,t1_fdipknn,"It's one thing to bring up your significant other, as they are a person. But straights don't walk around going ""I'm straight and proud."" unless it's because we're tired of hearing the ""gay and proud."" We don't mind people having something that's a part of them, and expecting to be accepted the same as others, but at the same time having it directly flung in our face gets kind of old. There's letting something be a part of you, and then there's letting it take you over.

It's like that annoying character in a game that goes ""I'm a mage!"" every two seconds. Yes. You throw fire. We get it. You're a mage.

Or that poorly written erotica that just keeps mashing in whatever kink and mentioning it in every paragraph instead of just telling the story.

Like all things, it's presentation.

Versus say, being a real life Mary Sue. (And while yes, rejection sucks, don't try to force people to accept you either. Just smile and let them have their own space. You're more likely to be someone to respect then, in their eyes, instead of a nuisance).

Because that's what constantly throwing a single personality aspect in someone's face is.

A nuisance. It screams ""look at me!"" instead of simply existing. Except the ""look at me"" is being shoved in their face. That only breeds annoyance and resentment."
whisky_pancake,fdjub0b,t1_fdipknn,"I don't think you are grasping the concept...    
Talking about your heterosexual partner is not ""talking about being straight""."
garbagecanmonster,fdir8af,t1_fdipwr2,Straight people do the same shit with jokes all the time and it doesn‚Äôt bother me at all. You‚Äôd have to be ignorant on purpose to say straight people don‚Äôt regularly make jokes that depend on their sexuality to be relatable.
InOutUpDownLeftRight,fdjr1gp,t1_fdipwr2,"I have many gay coworkers at my job. I am friends with them but I go silent when they say a sassy thing about someone else- typically a woman. Many times it is something that would be inappropriate for a straight man to say about a woman- but they think they have a pass for being gay. It‚Äôs usually said aloud in a joking manner towards the woman. But it‚Äôs just not funny. Even if a woman said the same thing. I guess they think the response should be, ‚Äúüò±üò≥Shut up you.

Justmoi21,fdko3ud,t3_elldgh,"I could‚Äôve written this!  I feel like our society pushes people to be like this and you‚Äôre right, your sexuality is only one part of you as a whole person.  It‚Äôs like I wanna tell them to love and accept their whole selves not just the lgbtq part."
the-willow-witch,fdjdwj1,t3_elldgh,Why does it bother you so much. Leave people alone. They‚Äôre not hurting you.
fenellabeach,fdjlicc,t3_elldgh,"Queer people spend our entire life until adulthood (and sometimes beyond) hiding who we are to protect ourselves. When we can finally be open about our sexuality / gender, sometimes we go a little over the top, to compensate for lost years. Who cares? Theres strength in claiming your identity, it's nothing to be ashamed of. Go get angry at homophobes and transphobes instead of at your friends for celebrating their existence."
dumbthotonly,fdj9icy,t3_elldgh,"I think its a more popular trend in among the LGBT youth, which is fine, but ultimately there's a fine (and potentially dangerous) line between being comfortable in yourself vs making your sexuality consume ur lifestyle"

BaseReddityt,fdjix8v,t3_elldgh,"This. I have people like this. And it gets obnoxiously annoying when they start demanding media change things for them. Like they can‚Äôt feel represented or connect with a character unless they‚Äôre gay, trans, bi, black, female, etc etc.. Fuck your sexuality/race/gender/etc. You have a favorite food, a favorite color, small things that people know you for, you have a favorite show and movie. Sexuality/race/gender/etc is not a personality trait. 
A character in a movie or show or game does not have to be gay and black for you to connect with their feelings of abandonment or loneliness. 

I don‚Äôt have to be Japanese to relate to Edward Elric and his brother in what it feels like to lose a parent. Or feel like I‚Äôm looked at differently because I‚Äôm not like people around me. Or connect to his feelings about how he was helpless in protecting Nina.

I don‚Äôt need to be black to understand blades struggle with not knowing who he is. Or even hating part of himself.

I don‚Äôt have to be white to get Sam and deans need to protect people from the thing that haunts them. 

It‚Äôs about the CHARACTER not the looks. And it‚Äôs about who you are as a person, not the things you can‚Äôt help and have no control over."

deelovely86,fdkq8d5,t3_elldgh,"I agree.  Your sexuality is part of who you are but shouldn't be the only thing that defines you as we person.  Be proud and be loud but have something, anything, else to say. Similarly, how you choose to eat is a great part of who you are and can be shared with others but if it is all that you have, then you should consider digging deeper. I believe we all have a lot more substance apart from how we eat and have sex."
Spazznax,fdl322v,t3_elldgh,"I don't believe it's anyone's place to decide what anyone else should use to define their personality. If someone wants to use a fictional book of magic school as an identifying part of their personality, then you get to decide if that's someone you want to associate with. Same with gender identity. It's something they're passionate about. For many of them it's this liberating experience that is one of the most defining points of their life and it's their choice to express as much or as little of that in their identity as they like. Your choice is to interact with people like that, not to decide whether certain details should be a bigger or smaller part of their identity."
SillyBlackSheep,fdmmhoo,t3_elldgh,"I get what your saying. I've met people whom you are referencing. To me it's like that hillbilly who only talks about NASCAR. It gets boring and a little annoying. I mean, if the conversation is already heading that direction, or if you're just making a subtle joke about it it's cool. However I have met people where that's like the only thing I actively know about them at all times. I'm bisexual, but I don't often reference it and I don't feel any less normal. I mention it so little that I forget some people don't know or I have friends that I have told this to but they have forgotten themselves.

smallfry1234,fdmaz0r,t3_elxjzl,"Feel all the feelings. Connect to yourself. 

I don't have much in the way of photos from my childhood because I went into foster care at 10 years old. My maternal grandmother sent me four pictures of me as a toddler and baby a few years back and it was weird to see myself as such a small person. I'm a bit of a writer so I kind of defaulted to writing a story for the little girl in one of the pictures. I absorbed all the details of what I was wearing, standing near my mother with one hand on her leg, my expression as I'm seeing someone take my picture, and the body language that even a toddler shows. It ended up a pretty emotional exercise, because I thought about all the things I didn't know yet and hadn't experienced yet at that age, and all the things I already had been exposed to. That might be too much for you, but know that no matter what emotions are coming up for you, it's just part of your process. Sending love."

_123EyesOnMe_,elkbeu,top_level,"Found out yesterday. We weren‚Äôt close or anything, but I‚Äôm pregnant so I‚Äôve been seeing the chiropractor once or twice a week for the past 6 months. He was so kind and friendly, and would talk to me about parenthood and how it changes you and about his daughter. Yesterday I went in to see him, and was annoyed that a different chiropractor was there. I mentioned on my way out that I would see Dr. Brian later in the week. He said, ‚ÄúOh, you don‚Äôt know....‚Äù 

He died of a stroke, alone in his home on Christmas Eve. He was in his 40s, not even an old guy. Nobody realized until he didn‚Äôt show up on Christmas Day. He had a sweet 9 year old daughter who lives with his ex, but other than that, no friends or family, so they aren‚Äôt even having a service for him or anything. Just like that, gone forever.

Idk why I‚Äôm thinking about this so much. Wasn‚Äôt close with the guy at all, but just thinking about the last time I saw him, it was 4 days before he died. And we were chatting about Christmas and plans and I told him I‚Äôd come back after Christmas. Neither of us knew. I guess you never know, do you? When your time is going to up. It‚Äôs unplanned and just happens like that.  I am thinking about all these things a lot today."

happi_hippo,eob6f7,top_level,"First of all trigger warning, obviously don‚Äôt read this if you‚Äôre sensitive to this type of content. 

When I was 7 or 8 I had a cousin who was my very best friend (Nathan will be his name). We were always together, and always looking for adventures. From scheming on how to steal candy from my grandma‚Äôs pantry to creating little businesses to earn pocket money from our relatives, we were always up to something. 

Every now and again he would want to go play with the older boy cousins though, and as much of a tomboy as I was, I would a lot of the times go off to find other things to do.

An older cousin, Nathan‚Äôs older brother, would find me and come up with ‚Äúgames‚Äù to play or things to do. Initially they would be really fun, until they started getting strange.  A game of ‚ÄúHide and seek‚Äù turned into hiding in a closet and him making me sit on his lap which wasn‚Äôt fun, so I‚Äôd tell him and made a fuss until he let me leave.

A situation like this happened where Nathan was off doing something else, and as grooming does, things escalated and this cousin convinced me to go up to a bedroom to ‚Äúplay pretend‚Äù. He pulled me close to him but wouldn‚Äôt let me leave this time. I froze up, and all I could say is ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like this game‚Äù 

Just then the door swung open and there was Nathan. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been looking for you, c‚Äômon let‚Äôs go play.‚Äù I was let go of, and Nathan and I continued on to go play as if nothing ever happened. 

After that I never put myself in a situation where I was alone with that cousin ever again, I was always with Nathan. I knew I was safe with him, we never talked about it ever again but a silent understanding was formed, he was my protector. 

I didn‚Äôt confide in an adult until I was older, and unfortunately it was only after my other female relatives had told their parents they had been molested by this guy around that same time. 

They didn‚Äôt have a Nathan watching out for them, and I‚Äôm just grateful that I did. 

We don‚Äôt talk often, but we‚Äôre still close. He‚Äôs doing well now, and getting married this summer to a wonderful person who is perfect for him. I‚Äôm so happy he‚Äôs doing well and am always going to be cheering him on in life."

doc_maker,elpxn8,top_level,"I'm currently creating a documentary about a man who's been promoting his own personal ""alien conspiracy theory"" with all it's unique quirks and characteristics and what not. He has a large, rather unknown online presence through his series of websites where he has collected testimonials of different people that subscribe to his theory and is rather well known locally.

During my preliminary research I did find one or two local news reports on him from 2003-2005 and that was about the only mentions I could find of him in the news. They were mostly objective, neutral reporting hinting at the fact that this is an absurd theory, but that was about it. It's what'd you expect from a news report on alien conspiracy theories. During my first interview with the man, let's call him Earl, the first thing he said to me was, ""I don't want to be ridiculed- I don't want to be ridiculed anymore"" I could understand he was hesitant to do the interview as I know that, of course, he's faced opposition and been ridiculed some before, but he went on to tell me just how many times he's been taken advantage of by the media. On countless occasions ""Journalists"" have emailed or called him saying they'd like to do an ""unbiased"" and ""objective"" news report on him. Earl welcomes them into his own home, makes them food and tea, and sacrifices an entire day of his admittedly fleeting life to tell them his story and beliefs for free. Do you know how these journalists repay him? A few days later they *always* release a opinion articles calling him an absolute nut, societies worst, making paragraphs of jokes at Earls expense. I could literally hear the pain in his voice as he said this. One time SNL came to his house disguised as news reporters and did a whole ""segment"" on him. Imagine his surprise when he appeared on national television that Saturday being mocked in front of the country.

It was difficult, but I was eventually able to reassure Earl that I had no malicious intent and just wanted to tell his story, though sadly he had to cut the interview short. Do you know why? Do you want to know? He was going to a support group for victims of traumatic events *that he helps run*. This man is retired and spends literally all his time giving back to the community and those who need it most and never, ever speaks of it either online or in interviews. I only know this because I pried somewhat.

These *""journalists""* come to this elderly mans home under false pretenses, deceive him, and then go on to create click-bait character mockery articles of him, essentially depicting him as this useless member of society and tarnishing his name when in all actuality I'm sure Earl has contributed more to society than any of these comedians or journalists have done or will ever do. And worst of all he has no way to rebuttal or defend himself.

It makes me *so* fucking mad that we as a society think this sort of thing is entertaining, laughing at someone elses expense to such a degree. Admittedly, I'm guilty of this in the past, though I think it will be harder for me to laugh next time.

You need to remember that the person you're laughing at is just like you. Every time Earl speaks or I look at a picture at him, he reminds me of my grandfather before he passed away, which I think is honestly where most of this comes from... Just holy shit, guys, what the fuck. Treat this man like a fellow human. He has legitimately done *nothing* wrong!!!!

Everyone makes fun of this man, but he is genuinely smart, legitimately. Even if you want to discount his current work, one thing you can't discount, which is also a common factor reporters want to dismiss during their ""journalism"", is that he is a former technical writer for NASA, the FAA, Boeing, and many other large respectable companies. He's very well spoken and it's a shame that most of his interviews are practically worthless, being distorted and twisted for some reporters ""just be glad you're not him"" article."

doc_maker,fdlf44p,t1_fdlelyx,"Well of course I do. Humor can be found in a lot of things, but again, we are- *they are* laughing at his expense. They lied to him, deceived him, and came into his home under false pretenses. Jon signs off of the segment by saying, ""Good undercover work, Nancy"", but in reality there was no story, it was just a long drawn out segment to mock this man and the people around him. Bullying him is what they're doing, simply put.

&#x200B;

I don't believe he's crazy, as I don't think you need to be crazy to subscribe to conspiracies (i don't subscribe to his own personal theory, though), but from the perspective of Jon they're quite literally mocking mentally ill people who were so very excited to finally share their story with someone who found it interesting, only to find out what it was truly for *after it aired.*"
solucid,fdlg001,t1_fdlf44p,"He claims they lied to him, deceived him, and came into his home under false pretense.

If you're making a documentary, I'm assuming you have some knowledge of release forms and agreements. I'm fairly certain ""Comedy Central"" and ""The Daily Show"" were probably both listed there more than once.

Now if he is mentally ill, then I'll agree, don't exploit the mentally ill. If he is of sound mind, but chooses to ignore what science shows us, well then...I think he is fair game for laughs."

swimlover99,elf9uy,top_level,"I have been a naturally serious person every since I was a baby. Literally people came up to my mom and were like ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs so serious!‚Äù when I was a baby. 

When I say, I‚Äôm naturally serious, I mean that I my face is stoic a lot of the time. I‚Äôm not one of those people that walk around with a smile on their face all the time even if I am happy. It‚Äôs just not a natural thing for my body to do. I do smile, laugh, and joke around with family and friends during my free time. I know how to have fun. Sometimes I am more serious depending on what I‚Äôm taking about. I don‚Äôt choose to be this way, it‚Äôs just how I am. 

I have nothing against people who smile all the time, but I am against people judging me and other serious people who don‚Äôt smile all the time. Also I do smile at people if they smile at me cause I don‚Äôt want to be rude. I just don‚Äôt have a smile on my face all the time. I usually have a naturally serious face.

I‚Äôve been judged for being naturally serious for many years. I‚Äôve been told I should smile more many times. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with being naturally serious. Just because I‚Äôm serious doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm a mean person or anything. I‚Äôm a very nice person. I‚Äôm not very judge mental, I‚Äôm not fake, and I‚Äôm a true friend. 

I don‚Äôt want to be someone I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôve never been a fake person or wanted to be that way. People in society say that we should be accepting different groups of people, but then tell people like me that we should change who we are. 

I also feel that I‚Äôm judged more for my seriousness cause I‚Äôm a woman. Women are expected by many women and men to smile all the time and we keep hearing that it‚Äôs trait that men desire in a woman. I have nothing against men who like women who smile all the time, but men (I know not all men do this) shouldn‚Äôt tell women to smile cause it‚Äôs what they find more attractive. Women aren‚Äôt obligated to fit their definition of what attractive is. 

I‚Äôm sick of the judgement towards serious people, especially serious women. Our society goes on and on about how we want to be accepting of diversity as we should be. However, we only seem to be accepting of diversity if it fits the realm of political correctness. Of course we should be politically correct but we should also accept people with different personalities outside of the realm of political correctness. 

To all the serious people out there: Embrace your serious personality. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with who you are. I‚Äôve often hated myself for my serious personality, but it‚Äôs just a part of who I am. Serious people, don‚Äôt try to change who you are just because some people can‚Äôt accept that not everyone naturally has a smile on their face all the time even if they are feeling happy.

Edit: Thank you for the silver kind redditor!"
CarltonJuma,fdhj92a,t3_elf9uy,Nice to see someone else who gets it. And also people should know it doesn‚Äôt mean we are rude because we take ourselves seriously and mostly focus on ourselves

cakecakmcbeefcake,fdivpzv,t3_elf9uy,"I totally get this, but in the opposite way.  I smile too much.  I laugh all the time, and if I‚Äôm not laughing, I‚Äôm sleeping.  Even when I‚Äôm sad or depressed, there‚Äôs a permanent smile on my face.  

I remember in high school a drama teacher actually holding me back in class and telling me that I look like a buffoon and need to ‚Äúknock off the phony act.‚Äù  That hurt.  I cried, and even when I was crying, I was cracking jokes.  Because I‚Äôm such a deeply feeling person, laughter and smiling is my natural guard and pacifier against pain.  

I have to deal with people being bossy and rude all the time to me because they think I‚Äôm stupid because I‚Äôm always nice.  I‚Äôve been looked down on, belittled and bullied for being a smiley person more times that I can count.  The worst thing is when someone acts genuinely surprised when I start talking about politics and religion and philosophy...like they‚Äôre literally flabbergasted that I‚Äôm not a moron.  

I can‚Äôt help smiling.  I‚Äôve honestly tried to smile less this year, because I want to be taken more seriously, and I don‚Äôt like it.  Why can‚Äôt I just be me?   

So I get it.  In the opposite way."

They said ‚ÄúThat makes you look like an idiot.‚Äù"

imaginexcellence,fdj6o9h,t1_fdj6bfw,"They didn‚Äôt say it in an asshole way. It was just a part of their culture. 

It‚Äôs not how you may think, there is plenty of freedom there, despite the negatives. Daily life is very similar to mine (I‚Äôm in the US): they have jobs, houses, go out to happy hour after work, etc. 

No doubt the current regime sucks, but the citizens are a lot like us."
swimlover99,fdlayb5,t1_fdj6o9h,"Even though it‚Äôs part of their culture, they still shouldn‚Äôt say things like that. It‚Äôs rude. Also isn‚Äôt it true that people can get arrested for ridiculous things in Russia that are totally legal in America?"
imaginexcellence,fdlurjm,t1_fdlayb5,"I guess it‚Äôs hard for me to judge it as rude, since I had seen their culture up close. The guy who said it wouldn‚Äôt have thought it was rude. I think it‚Äôs because their culture is very ‚Äúno nonsense.‚Äù  In the US, I totally would have thought it was rude, but somehow, there, it was just general conversation. 

As far as getting arrested for things that would be OK in the US, I didn‚Äôt really see it. I drank a lot with my friends, visited the usual tourist traps, did some shopping. But mostly we partied. I never saw an instance where ‚Äúpartying‚Äù as we know it in the West turned into something scary. 

The one thing I will say, in Russia, being gay is like being gay in 1950‚Äôs America. Every gay person I met was afraid of being outted, and they had ‚Äúanti-gay propaganda‚Äù laws. Since I‚Äôm straight, I wasn‚Äôt worried, but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend Russian travel if you‚Äôre gay."

Sgtfridge,fdif5gg,t3_elf9uy,"While I accept your statement as fact society has always deemed people that have the aura of ""unapproachable"" a subconscious threat. Humans are social creatures on a very primal level and it's very easy to box people into categories with very little insight to their personality vs their mannerisms.

2. Get help with the drinking. Go to your doctor, AA, therapy, whatever is available in your area. 

3. Get therapy for depression. Again, go to your doctor if you're unsure of what to do, or straight to therapy if you can.

You only have one life, and it's worth saving. Work on your issues, defeat them, get a fresh start. You don't have to plan out your entire life. Just do the next right thing. Take it one step at a time. I promise you there is so much out there that is worth living for."

I got a ride to the guys dorm but he wasn‚Äôt up to giving me a ride back home. I only had enough money for basic necessities but I had to instead spend it on an Uber. There were no drivers available because of how late it was, but I kept trying and that‚Äôs when you accepted my request. A $42, 38 minute long Uber ride from one city to another. I‚Äôm sorry I couldn‚Äôt tip you and I‚Äôm also sorry if I seemed scared I was only 17 at the time and it was 4AM. No cars in sight except only a few travelers maybe. You could‚Äôve done anything, but instead you just gave me great company and a ride home. I felt so safe.. I hope all is well. Thank you..."
