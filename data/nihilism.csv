In all honesty though, I think it’s a fundamentally flawed statement. Who is the one who would have asked to be born or not? The self is an illusion reinforced by the ego. 

You weren’t forced to do anything. This just *is*, there is no choice, it was not forced. That’s like saying that the ocean is being forced to produce waves."

That's such a terrible argument that everyone keeps using. You CAN'T leave anytime you want. It takes a lot of trauma and mental disease to override natural self-preservation instincts. Even though suicide is probably the logical option for most people, you can't just do it."

NihilHS,fe96sq5,t1_fe8iu63,"Then to say that we're forced to ""exist and suffer"" isn't the whole picture either. We're forced to suffer *and* be happy.

Perhaps that isn't satisfactory to a pessimist, but I don't think nihilism is inherently pessimistic (in that regard). Consequently I have to agree with jackrunit above. The attachment of values to the concept and to therefore arrive at either pessimism or optimism is not an attribute of nihilism but a mechanic of human cognition. In other words, one could be a nihilist and also be optimistic, pessimistic, or neither. The emotional response you have doesn't have much to do with nihilism itself.

It *might* be true that there is a tendency for pessimism with nihilists, but from the perspective of nihilism, neither pessimism nor optimism is preferred."

But I have a feeling that some on that list may be out of control with their rage, even if justified. But, as I said, there are many non-toxic, excellent pro-feminist forums and sites on the web. The one you are referring to seems to be the /only/ feminism sub on Reddit. Perhaps r/women might be better behaved?

Freedom is not something that everyone has to the same extent. If you don't care about being free, you won't make any efforts to become free. That's the reason why so many people are just miserable slaves of society or religion.

This is nihilism. Nihilists know that their life has no purpose. So they can do whatever they want whithout thinking about restrictions made by society.

And the murder=jail=not free argument is also bullshit because this has nothing to do with freedom but with morality. OF COURSE you can kill anybody for no reason!! But why the frick would you do that unless you are an immoral piece of garbage. Someone who wants to be free would not think about taking other people's freedom away."

What are you talking about flying? You cannot fly because you are not a bird. Hello, this is real life speaking! Humens cannot fly, and not being able to fly has nothing to do with freedom because humans are not meant to be able to fly (again, sorry for my bad english lol).

You are not understanding the concept of freedom for example because you wrote that we are not free from cultural conditioning which is just wrong!! Of course you are. If you choose to follow that cultural shit of your country even though your culture pisses you off, you are just stupid.

concentrate on your breath.


oh, a thought came up. from where did it come? did you control it?
obviously not.
the thoughts just pop into your mind with no control at all.
how exactly can you have free will if you cannot even control what thoughts come into your mind?

are depressed people just free to think of something else and not be depressed anymore?
or traumatized people just free to think of something else and forget what happened to them?

= free will doesn't make any sense with everything we know about psychology and neurology.
the concept of a personality only make sense because it is a somewhat static thing, exactly because people are not free to change.

My mind is limitless. It can imagine the most impossible of scenarios, but I can never be capable of achieving them because when I get out of my mind, and realize I'm a physical body, that is bound by universal laws, I realize the things that I dream of, I can't do because the laws don't permit me. My physical body isn't equipped to break those laws.

parkerjames29,fdhr89r,t1_fdhjhlp,Free Will exists it’s usually people who don’t want to take Personal Responsibility that believe free will doesn’t exist so they don’t have to take any responsibility for their actions/choices/circumstances.

It’s like being gay/bi it’s a choice whether you think those choices you made to get to that point are good or bad is up to your view/opinion but they are still Free Will choices you made to get to that point.

do you really think anyone would ""choose"" to be gay even if it is a big disadvantage (in the past, being gay was very risky), if they could just choose to be straight? seriously?
in some countries being gay is still punished with the death penalty.
obviously people don't choose their sexual orientation.


and if you have a mindset of personal responsibilty, from where does it come? did you choose to have this mindset?
no, it's the result of your education and childhood, and your upbringing, and also genetic factors.

do you really think lazy & depressed people prefer to be that way ? do you really think they just could ""choose"" to not be lazy and depressed?
being lazy and depressed is not an advantage in any way, so why would someone, with ""free will"", decide to be like that?"
VoidMaster85,fdibnu3,t1_fdiagf7,"so then smokers (or people with other addictions) should easily be able to stop their addictions because the thought to stop clearly crossed their mind at some point.
psychology tells us a different story.
and if your next argument is now that people just don't really want to stop, then they must be extremly confused about their motivations (which also doesn't seem like ""free will"" to me), as when asked they clearly state they want to stop, but for some reason, can't.

the reality why most people fail, is quite easy to explain if you give up the free will myth:
the ""addiction"" is nothing but a physical structure in your brain.
(the more addicted you are, the more this structure is integrated into the reward systems of your brain)
for your addiction to end, this structure has to disappear.
but physical structures just don't disappear overnight.
if people go cold turkey, the structure slowly disappears, because there are biochemical processes.
but if you ""just smoke a little bit"" the structure will be reinforced and reintegrated, also by biochemical processes.

where is the free will in all of this?"
