plug_play,fdhi9e3,t3_elfilp,Was it you?
brevit,fdhitp3,t1_fdhi9e3,Yes.
4theSkyrim,fdhk4h3,t1_fdhitp3,Oh jesus
laxr87,fdhlfjs,t1_fdhitp3,"Yeah, that‚Äôs 100% creepy as fuck. Be safe, my dude."
ohpee8,fdibfj3,t1_fdhitp3,You need to beat your barber's ass next time you see them
cheddarfever,fdhpz5g,t1_fdhitp3,Oh god that‚Äôs super creepy
Helium902009,fdjx7kf,t1_fdhitp3,"Well I know they shouldnt have taken the picture, but Im glad they did."
rosepirate018,fdhvvvg,t1_fdhitp3,omg! I wasn't expecting it to actually be you.
brevit,fdhle55,t1_fdhk4h3,Yea... was a little freaked out. On the plus side I've always been curious what I looked like from behind lol
xmontygx,fdjagp5,t1_fdibfj3,"I was thinking the same thing 

Lopsided af"
brevit,fdilbae,t1_fdikqyp,"Hey, it was SuperCuts."
CLErox,fdhlnag,t1_fdhle55,Who is it that is texting you?
HentaiSniper420,fdiuyq2,t1_fdhle55,"honestly props on looking good from a seated position from behind. that's like the most unflattering angle to see somebody from, since it really accentuates love handles if you have them, but you look good from that angle. also your butt doesn't look weird or anything. keep up the good work proud of u fam"
NotChristina,fdii505,t1_fdhle55,"For some reason this reminds me of an ill-fated first date I went on a couple years ago. Met on an online dating site, decided to go hiking. I chose a very public mountain with a short hike to the top. Guy is late, kind of creepy, and not very sociable. He asked if he can take photos of me. Being weirded out, I declined. 

Later that night he texts me photos of me he had taken when he was behind me. Just...why?"
hereisalex,fdigv3k,t1_fdhle55,Well I mean the best place to find out what you look like from behind is probably Grindr so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
ObiWansDealer,fdjo0h9,t1_fdhle55,BOI u look shit hot from the back go u
BurrStreetX,fdi6lbl,t1_fdhle55,I‚Äôd like to find that out as well.
nana7777777,fdrujnk,t1_fdhle55,that's the spirit lol
brevit,fdhltgw,t1_fdhlnag,I don't know who it is. I blocked them. It's a gay dating app that shows the people closest to you. I have my face picture up on it so not unreasonable that people would recognise me. But taking a sneaky pic then texting it hours later asking if it's me is creepy af.
dfslkjbnltalrvlxdguh,fdka5qv,t1_fdhlnag,Someone on grindr
brevit,fdivmxk,t1_fdiuyq2,Haha thanks dude. Just need to sort out that fade lol
JCharante,fdju7e1,t1_fdii505,"Oh jeez 

That's a power move, but like, oh my gosh no"
thebestyouneverhad_,fdhnqzn,t1_fdhltgw,"Holy shit, what the fuck"
CLErox,fdhm4an,t1_fdhltgw,Oh Jesus.. even worse than I thought.  I thought it was a weird girl or boy that you kinda sorta know.
PM_ME_KNEE_SLAPPERS,fdhp6jk,t1_fdhltgw,"> dating app that shows the people closest to you.

I'm an older guy but I can't for the life of me understand why anyone would want this."
RickRudeAwakening,fdi7je6,t1_fdhltgw,The fact that someone hasn‚Äôt made an app like this and called it Gaydar is really a shame.
LuckyWhip,fdhsru0,t1_fdhltgw,"Also if you allow it, it'll show your distance down to the feet, so if he saw something like ""20 feet away"" on your profile he knows he can probably just look around and see you. Still tho, i can't imagine someone sending that not intending to intimidate you."
im_twelve_,fdi2zxu,t1_fdhltgw,"I'm assuming they were trying to be funny, like ""hey I totally saw you earlier, isn't it cool that we were coincidentally in the same place? Lol"" 

But they definitely could've just said, ""Did you happen to be at so and so place earlier? I was there and I think I recognized you! Didn't want to say hi in case it wasn't though. Haha"" Instead of sending a fucking shot of your back, wtf?"
ScrimpyCat,fdi8yvt,t1_fdhltgw,"Any of those apps which display user proximity can be used to pinpoint someone‚Äôs location. [Grindr](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grindr#Potential_triangulation) was probably the most notable one to have these issues, maybe they even still have the issue (if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre using?). 

They might‚Äôve found you by coincidence, or it could be the creepier alternative and they tracked you down. Either way be careful. If you wanted to err on the side of caution you could disable location tracking/services whenever you‚Äôre not specifically using the app."
mcmoonery,fdi3rlx,t1_fdhltgw,My best friend made me download it once so we could keep tabs on a creeper. I‚Äôm a straight woman so it was a bizarre little window into his life.
IcePhoenix18,fdi92c9,t1_fdhltgw,"It would be a ""quirky"" way of saying ""haha, we're literally in the same building! Who's gonna say hi first?"", but hours later? Creepy af!"
unsmashedpotatoes,fdifb97,t1_fdhltgw,The hours later part makes it creepy
Fey_RL,fdiwwah,t1_fdhltgw,"It's crazy how much of a difference there is between just saying ""Hey I think I saw you at \_\_\_\_ earlier today! Were you there?"" (which can be perceived as pleasant and a cool coincidence) or completely ruining it by sending a secretly taken photo instead."
viktor_izaak,fdhpbjn,t1_fdhltgw,Celebrity status :D
captaingrowler,fdi2xhj,t1_fdhltgw,I‚Äôve found that people that use those apps can have a tendency towards predatory.
killamonjaro90,fdid9k2,t1_fdhltgw, I always hide my distance because of these weird people lol. I've only been asked if I'm in a location never had some creep snap a Pic like that üòÖ. Stay safe
traktier,fdijidb,t1_fdhltgw,Idk sounds kinda gay
IronBrowncoat,fdhwkb5,t1_fdhltgw,How scary! Glad you're ok and things didn't escalate further!!
WitnessMeToValhalla,fdhxgh9,t1_fdhltgw,"Creepy af. I‚Äôve seen that before, dude seems the proximity of the user and figures out who they are and sends a stealth shot. Bunch of wimps"
FnfHeat,fdinxsu,t1_fdhltgw,What‚Äôs creepier?  hours later or knowing he Tinder stalking you?
lovebuggy3,fdiv8xr,t1_fdhltgw,what's the app
mandiexile,fdj1p2g,t1_fdhltgw,"That kind of happened to me once. I was out with friends and this guy started talking to me, then pulled up my OkCupid profile and said ‚Äúis this you? I messaged you and you never responded.‚Äù Awkward as hell."
Spazzle17,fdjxcdj,t1_fdhltgw,"Try not to get murdered, because that's creepy as fuck."
pototo72,fdj070i,t1_fdhm4an,"And slight distinction, it's a hookup app, not a dating app"
Robizard,fdhqcg7,t1_fdhp6jk,It‚Äôs because some  people use it to hookup with whomever is nearby.
FallenErasGame,fdhpiui,t1_fdhp6jk,"I mean I doubt someone would want to be dating someone half way across the world from them, but you have a point."
bluescrew,fdhw3ef,t1_fdhp6jk,Because they're at a bar or club and they want to hook up but without having to be brave and approach anyone
riveroceans,fdi33wb,t1_fdhp6jk,"One of my friends liked or whatever a guy she worked with, he swiped the other way. She said it made work a litttle ackward."
pototo72,fdj09kj,t1_fdi7je6,I guarantee it exists or did exist and was a really shitty app.
PersikovsLizard,fdjt2ar,t1_fdi7je6,"It exists, it was a perfectly good website about 12-15 years ago but did not make the transition to mobile."
Ebmoclas,fdjv3yd,t1_fdi7je6,"There used to be a dating website called Gaydar, back in the day. It was exactly like dating apps are today IIRC. I spent waaay too much time on that website considering I'm straight."
Friendly_Fishstick,fdi8gq7,t1_fdi5fgz,"Probably Grindr, they do that."
spicycookie314,fdiy81l,t1_fdiv8xr,"horny alert

edit: that‚Äôs not the name of the app i was just calling you horny haha"
rubyshroom,fdjg71a,t1_fdj64ga,"It's from an app, so they didn't have OPs number"
brevit,fdk8smb,t1_fdj070i,I was trying to make us look good in front of the straight people
morriere,fdjkjz0,t1_fdj070i,its both
DifferentPassenger,fdhrak6,t1_fdhqcg7,I always am surprised at the sheer number of gay men who are within 5000 feet of me
PM_ME_KNEE_SLAPPERS,fdhrg6x,t1_fdhqcg7,"I honestly get that it would be easier to find a hookup but it just doesn't sit right that people you don't know can find out about you, just like this thread."
hdr96,fdiw83e,t1_fdhpiui,"Its not for everyone, but it can work for some. Did long distance for 6 years, now i've been living with her for almost a year, and our 7 year anniversary is just around the corner."
OldManDubya,fdivvyd,t1_fdhw3ef,More because they're at home and horny and want someone to come over/not have to walk/drive a million miles to hook up with them.
jerichosway,fdjh3wq,t1_fdi33wb,There's no way for her on any app to even know if someone swiped left on someone unless they admitted it though?
Doiihachirou,fdjeilz,t1_fdj09kj,It's probably just a beeping noise you can activate with touch so you can point it at your friends and giggle
captaingrowler,fdidhmq,t1_fdic7w8,"I‚Äôm not only talking about gay apps. I‚Äôm also referring to straight apps. 

I‚Äôve come across predatory women. Predatory men pretending to be women. 

Cousin has shown me predatory straight men she has come across. And I have many gay friends that have come across predatory men. 

Also, Britain‚Äôs most prolific rapist raped hundreds of men he lured into his apartment. 

So don‚Äôt give me that BS. Any of these apps are a great outlet for predators.

Hell I just found out there‚Äôs an app that underage people use for dating and pedophiles pretend to be teens on there."
lovebuggy3,fdl9bet,t1_fdiy81l,"oh i'm not gay hehe, its for my buddy who's HELLA lonely teehe"
DrHob0,fdk9fc4,t1_fdk8smb,"I'm bi. You already are good lookin'. Ayooooooooooo. 


Fuck, that one hurt me."
aman1420,fdi3tlj,t1_fdhrak6,They are gay in single file to hide their numbers
WeCame2BurgleUrTurts,fdjjfeu,t1_fdhrak6,"It's scary that most of us aren't flaming beacons of fabulous, isn't it? We could be anywhere and anyone."
Dwarfherd,fdj4nc6,t1_fdhrak6,"Well, some of them could be bi."
nuephelkystikon,fdjn4bf,t1_fdhrak6,And that's just the desperate ones.
Passerine_,fdicdhd,t1_fdhrg6x,"They can only know information that you put on there, there‚Äôs an option to hide your exact location too"
zaboomafoo_420,fdjydvm,t1_fdhrg6x,Most people don‚Äôt have face pics/identifying information on their public profiles on this app
FallenErasGame,fdjp1o7,t1_fdiw83e,"Yeah, it‚Äôs not something I would do, but I can see why you would do it, it probably decreases chances of them turning up outside your window at midnight or something on the plus side."
riveroceans,fdjhwnq,t1_fdjh3wq,He never responded to her swipe would have been a better choice of words.
brevit,fdhnso7,t3_elfilp,"Some background as a few people are asking: 

Yes - it's me in the picture. 

No - I do not know this person and had never spoken to them before. 

I was in a cafe near my house. The app is Grindr which shows you people located close to you. My face picture is on my profile, so I guess he recognised me and took a picture. Unlike tinder, you can chat to anyone so he was able to message me the picture, but didn't send it till later (for some reason!). After this I just blocked the profile (after going WTF and taking a screenshot)."
im17,fdhriv6,t1_fdhnso7,Time to move
Verified_Ass,fdj6fx7,t1_fdhnso7,"This happened to my friend too. We were working at a froyo shop together and he received a message on Grindr saying ‚Äúyou have a nice smile and I like the red shirt (our uniform) you‚Äôre wearing :)‚Äù

It said the sender was like 32ft away or something. What a creep."
Blaze_Falcon,fdhp25x,t1_fdhnso7,How does it feel having you're own stalker?
coltsfootballlb,fdijuif,t1_fdhnso7,"What was the other profile like? Was there a face, and did you recognize seeing them at all?"
brevit,fdhs5yu,t1_fdhriv6,This stuff is really not too unusual where I live. This isn't the creepiest message I've got by a long shot!
brevit,fdikcty,t1_fdijuif,Can't really remember tbh. Didn't notice anyone in particular.
erineegads,fdi593d,t1_fdhs5yu,Let‚Äôs hear the creepiest story!
brevit,fdi9aaf,t1_fdi593d,"Probably the creepiest thing that happened was one night I got a text from an unknown number and it was some guy accusing me of having sex with his boyfriend the previous night. I had no idea who this guy was but I did know his boyfriend and had met him once about 8 months prior, although I didn't know he had a boyfriend and had only ever texted him a couple of times since.

He then told me that he **knew** that we had sex because the previous night he had **followed his boyfriend** after he left a bar and followed him **to my apartment building** and watched him go in (I have no idea how he knew where I lived). It's true that the boyfriend had texted me the previous night, super drunk, and asked if he could come over. I said no, but I guess he still came to my building for some reason and it's an open door so he could have come in without me knowing (he was pretty wasted).

It went on for ages and I told him that I didn't do anything with his boyfriend and I was asking him how he got my information, like my phone number and my address. All he said was ""a mutual friend"". Uhhh ok... which one?? He wouldn't tell me. I showed him to a few of my friends and no one knew who this person was so I think he was lying and probably got my details through stalking me or going through his boyfriend's stuff.  

He then told me that he and his boyfriend had broken up that day because of this (and apparently a long history of cheating). 

THEN... and this is the kicker...  then started to hit on me, saying stuff like ""you're very cute btw"".

You couldn't make this shit up. I have the screenshots of the conversation somewhere if you are interested I can dig them out."
Cataclyst,fdj1xis,t1_fdi9aaf,"He was jealous of his boyfriend and wants revenge sex. He definitely got your number from taking his boyfriend‚Äôs phone. 

To avoid this situation in the future, don‚Äôt meet up with men who hide their faces and relationship status in their default profile. They‚Äôre almost all cheaters, and someone who is dishonest about something like that can be dishonest about sexual health."
Treemurphy,fdiovae,t1_fdi9aaf,"id love screenshots, so would a few subreddits too"
insipido,fdihplr,t1_fdi9aaf,"Go for it, please!"
nightpanda893,fdj7r7i,t1_fdi9aaf,I‚Äôm guessing the whole thing was a plan to get to the end game of hitting on you.
IllyriasAcolyte,fdhlcuf,t3_elfilp,"Here we see a Grindr user in his natural habitat, breaking social conventions and possibly also stalking laws to ensnare a mate."
Laundry-Detergent,fdhnrxu,t1_fdhlcuf,i‚Äôm straight so i‚Äôve never used grindr but god the things i hear about that app are genuinely scary. that‚Äôs not even counting how it‚Äôs made specifically for horny dudes
IllyriasAcolyte,fdhosob,t1_fdhnrxu,"I've had mostly positive experiences with it, but I've heard a lot of horror stories. Like any dating app, it's had serial killers and shit, but it seems more prone to ghosting than most apps."
iCoeur285,fdivzpn,t1_fdhnrxu,"In my state we had an older man lure a young man on Grindr, and he ended up stabbing him, cutting open his throat, and then eating his testicles. He had him strung up in his basement like a deer for days. It‚Äôs super sad and fucked up."
LebronsHairline,fdjsdlr,t1_fdhnrxu,Is it not just Tinder but specifically for the gay community? Tinder has the exact same risks.
silverpixiefly,fdizn8w,t1_fdivzpn,What the fuck? I don't even know what to do with this information.
PinkAndSkulls,fdj1f3c,t1_fdivzpn,I saw that article somewhere on Reddit earlier. It was so sad.
Slayro,fdjyasz,t1_fdivzpn,Oh my goodness! I just read about that yesterday. Absolutely awful!! üò£üò£üò£
iCoeur285,fdj166h,t1_fdizn8w,"It‚Äôs really shocking because he is from a small community, I actually know his cousins. Jeffree Star actually donated $20,000 to his family to help with the service. It is nice to see the community really come together for this family, but it‚Äôs sad that it‚Äôs even needed at all."
nightpanda893,fdj7k6v,t1_fdj1f3c,You should see the statement from the victim‚Äôs dad. Basically he blamed him saying this revealed his son‚Äôs ‚Äúdark side‚Äù. And people wonder why gay guys hide shit like this and end up in dangerous situations where no one even knows where they are when they go to discreetly meet someone.
iCoeur285,fdj3bn6,t1_fdj1f3c,"It‚Äôs so surreal having it happen in a small community. I‚Äôm used to things like drug busts happening around my hometown, but I‚Äôm not used to insane killers who may have been a serial killer in the making."

Stoney_Kitten,fdhme4n,t3_elfilp,"That reminds me of when I was over on the mats at the gym doing a core workout, and this dude plopped down next to me and pulls up my tinder profile and was like ""is this you?"" And I was like ""crap... yep. What's up."" Long story short I have no back bone and dont really know how to leave conversations without upsetting people, I ended up finger painting with him all day. What that was I have no idea. 

Also, we hadn't matched, I remember swiping left. So no clue how he pulled it up."
BullHonkery,fdieed1,t1_fdhme4n,Finger...painting.
Stoney_Kitten,fdifu2s,t1_fdieed1,"Not where you were expecting that to go, were ya?"
BullHonkery,fdig9qu,t1_fdifu2s,The perfect place for a line break.
Stoney_Kitten,fdii72q,t1_fdig9qu,"Whoops, I see what's happening, my bad, I'm exhausted!"
fuzzballsoflove,fdj6ck3,t1_fdii72q,...is finger painting a euphemism now?
Stoney_Kitten,fdj6gf9,t1_fdj6ck3,It is not. There was also water color

gothbaseball,fdij604,t3_elfilp,"There was a guy on campus who had a crush on me last year who thought it was cute to send me ‚Äúsniper‚Äù snapchats. Where it‚Äôs zoomed in on me walking somewhere from far away without me knowing, with sniper crosshairs drawn over me. It wasn‚Äôt cute."
Huckdog,fdiwo3t,t1_fdij604, I'm sorry but that's super fucking creepy.
littlepinkpwnie,fdhjc4e,t3_elfilp,"If it was you, totally creepy. If it wasn't you, still not funny but just a bad joke."
paper-frog,fdhm22g,t3_elfilp,"Yeah, the ""Lol"" really does nothing to make taking a creep shot of you seem casual and okay"
amaryllius,fdhkoys,t3_elfilp,I always wonder when people text me they saw me somewhere why they didn't just walk up to me and say hi
timetojudgepeople,fdhor14,t1_fdhkoys,Extroverts be like
amaryllius,fdhu2ji,t1_fdhor14,"Well if you are just shy and don't want to talk, all fine. Just don't be a creep and text me afterwards."

LavenderWaterColor,fdjade4,t1_fdi5ma0,So sassy.
pixiemeadow,fdihcod,t3_elfilp,This reminded me of the creepy time my boyfriend‚Äôs ex sent him a picture of our house to let him know that she moved in across the street
slimydad,fdhjmgc,t3_elfilp,I‚Äôve gotten these texts before and I always hated them. Weird that it‚Äôs ‚Äúwas this‚Äù instead of ‚Äúus this‚Äù like they waited until u were gone to send the creepy message
jmbravo,fdhkyvv,t3_elfilp,Creepy as fuck. Why people do this? Nobody likes that lol
simplyrichy_,fdj2u8p,t3_elfilp,I had this happen a few times. Creepiest was when I was at Macy‚Äôs buying a gift and I get a message on the app. Yup. A picture of my rear in the shorts I‚Äôm wearing. I kept walking straight out the door. Creeped out. Followed by another message complimenting my butt and telling me what all he would do to it if I gave him a chance. Def. creepy! :-( I‚Äôve deleted the app since then.
BoyishBite,fdizyp2,t3_elfilp,"bro I had somebody walk up to me at my job, asked me to help them with their photos as I worked in a photo center at the time and then started talking to me about how he found me on Grindr and how nice I looked, how nice I was to help him(my job?)...kept asking for when I got off work. dude was 30 years older than me..."

syncopacetic,fdiwkni,t3_elfilp,Oh man. My SO‚Äôs ex was apparently sat across from me on the subway one day. She took pics of me and sent them to him with me none the wiser. Legit never even met the woman.
KajaIsForeverAlone,fdj26pp,t3_elfilp,Grindr brings out the creeps
Emm_777,fdj4sdo,t1_fdj26pp,"It really does, I've almost been kidnapped Fucking. Twice. No one should have to worry about that when trying to get some good dick"
WienerWuerstl,fdjibd3,t3_elfilp,"I've had that happen to me on Grindr too, twice, and both times at the gym. Both times from profiles without a face pic. One guy got offended when I told him it was creepy just taking pictures of strangers at the gym, the other one showed at least some remorse, said sorry and said that he was just shy and didn't think it would come across as creepy. 

I don't get why you wouldn't just write the person ""Hey, think I just saw you at X."" (and include a picture of themself). How do they expect people to respond to something like this?"
Munchingpears,fdhx5mn,t3_elfilp,"Creepiness aside, that is a nice back. Props for that"

kangaesugi,fdjeyr3,t3_elfilp,"Omg back before I transitioned I tried using Grindr and I got a message saying ""are you sat at the other end of the bar?"" And like honestly I deleted the app immediately lol

hlnhr,fdjx0h1,t1_fdjw1yb,"Yeah I was about to say the same thing. It looks quite polite and was done in the moment, not afterwards. Could have been a nice moment I guess ?"
Ebmoclas,fdkpvwi,t1_fdjx0h1,"It's not something I would personally do, but if done to me when we are both at the bar then it's not something I would freak out about. Just personal preference I guess. If you're going to put your face out there on a location based dating/pick up app, it shouldn't come as that much of a surprise when people try to date you/pick you up."

dyld921,fdho2tk,t3_elfilp,ITT: Straight people are confused by Grindr once again
panzerschnapp,fdi286o,t3_elfilp,It would be funny if you knew the person and weren't sure if it was them and so never said anything but then later realized it was them and then told them via message.
brevit,fdi2or2,t1_fdi286o,Yeah that's about the only context I can see it being not creepy. But if I knew someone I'd probably just say hi lol
Avenray,fdibx55,t3_elfilp,"Oh grindr, you rascal."
TwinJacks,fdid2p5,t3_elfilp,Oh shit... after reading that this wasn't from your friend.. thats super creepy
BoredomBee,fdjffz0,t3_elfilp,"Run.

Fucking. *Run.*"
LethalDoseMLD50,fdj3b0s,t3_elfilp,I met my BF of 8 years in Grindr. Initially started as just a hook up. I rode down on my motorcycle to hook up with him in the woods.  Was fucking hot.  Anyway I didn‚Äôt think much of it other than it being a good time.  But when I got home that night I had a text from him asking if I got home safe.  I knew it right then.  That text  lit a spark.  We‚Äôve been together for 8 years now.
Shoegarlace,fdhlv9v,t3_elfilp,Did you find out who it was?
Im-Real-Human,fdhnh10,t3_elfilp,Any background to this? Is it a friend or a family member?

brevit,fdk85ei,t1_fdjot83,"what's a foil fade? 

So I can ask never to have one again lol"
havocgreef,fdldppl,t1_fdk85ei,The difference between a 0 fade and a skin fade is big. Using foil shavers to remove all hair at the base of the fade changes the look completely. Foil shavers take it down to where you can't even feel stubble. Game changers.

Zer0Rebel4,fdl0t5j,t3_elfilp,Thats honestly terrifying
TheAmazingJuicyBeast,fdl3jlh,t3_elfilp,I mean doesn't Grindr give super accurate distances? I think I remember a next door neighbour being on Grindr and it saying he was a feet away. I can't say I am too surprised this happened and I know I will probably get shit on for saying this but the guys message probably wasn't meant to be as creepy as the guy made it
Katyt1828,fdp1i7n,t3_elfilp,If it‚Äôs a friend then it‚Äôs probably supposed to be funny but if it‚Äôs not someone you‚Äôre pretty close with then it‚Äôs extremely creepy.
Jokic4mvp2020,fdi432x,t3_elfilp,Not ‚Äúis‚Äù this you but ‚Äúwas‚Äù this you. Implying that you are now someone else. That makes it creepier to me.

TryingToBeReallyCool,fdp80lq,t1_fdp230n,Reward of one nut for information leading to it's safe return
NakariLexfortaine,fdpls41,t1_fdp230n,"It's simple to help someone locate a recently lost penis, be it naturally detachable or sentient and possibly dangerous.

First check the medicine cabinet. It's a common place to find someones detachable penis, and, oddly, sentient penii show an instinctual drive to put themselves in there.

Second contact anyone you've been around for the last 24-48 hours. Ask if they remember seeing a lone penis, possibly looking cold and lonely. Maybe someone took it home, looking for a good time and thinking this was an easy lay? It happens.

Finally check any market stalls around. You can frequently find a wide variety of penis on sale. Strays often end up scooped up by one of these Flesh Merchants, promised a good home, and sold to the first customer who just knows someone they wouldn't fuck unless it was with someone else's junk.

Sadly, in most cases of sale, capture, or unexpected sentience, the best hope is the penis finds its way back home before the STDs win out. Others just... Die on the streets. Occasionally you find a runaway, loaning itself out for another hit, another shot down the main vein.

We always try to find the original home, but it often just doesn't work out. One of them has changed too much, or there's a new penis in town and the two can't settle. We've lost too many good dicks to getting turned out, and they just slip away. Another statistic. We try, but there's only so much you can do."

UltraMegaSuperGay,fdvbpbu,t1_fdv8g3r,A person who is attracted to trans people but only for fetish-y reasons.
LittleSparrow24,fe46e26,t1_fe44z0r,"Not always. I don't advertise the fact im transgender (and I don't hide it either that's how trans people get killed)

 I'm lucky that I pass pretty well, to me telling me them I am transgender is an act of trust because basically what I'm telling you them is ""yo I don't have a vag o have a dick"" and telling someone about my genitles requires me to trust them to at the very least not make a huge deal about it. If it happens they ain't into girls with dicks that's totally fine I wish them luck on dating and we go our separate ways. If they are open to it or are all about it then hurrah :) 

I let them know before we meet / if it gets serious so that way it's fair on them and me.

I would define them as a chaser if they knew instantly that I'm a girl with a ding dong and they went to me only for that reason. Which I suppose is more applicable to grinder than tinder which is why I hardly use  grinder tbh.

Sorry to rattle on and on haha"
b3anz129,fe4h3d1,t1_fe46e26,"Oh no it‚Äôs cool, I appreciate that. I just hope you don‚Äôt find my questions offensive. 

I think I understand how being fetishized can feel dehumanizing. With that said, it‚Äôs pretty normalized in society for people to put high value on certain physical traits, think height or cup size. So in that sense don‚Äôt you think that trans-preference can be a thing or is it somehow not the same?"

imafreakininja,fdw1892,t1_fdvvhxo,"[From Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sealioning)

> The term originated with a 2014 strip of the webcomic Wondermark by David Malki, where a character expresses a dislike of sea lions and a sea lion intrudes to repeatedly ask the character to explain. ""Sea lion"" was quickly verbed the term gained popularity as a way to describe online trolling, and it was used to describe some of the behavior of those participating in the Gamergate Controversy

Edit: An important thing to note is that it's not just the asking questions in bad faith that's malicious, it's that the ""sea lion"" frames themselves as an innocent person just asking questions when really they're anything but the sort. They try to get the other party mad so that they can instead say ""wow look at how irrational this person is, I was just curious and asking questions!"""

I mean I live in New York and have a fair amount of gay friends, mostly male.

Had drinks spilled at me, been glared at or called out...idk convinced me to leave. Thought it was just me but my girlfriend noticed too and experienced the ‚Äúwhy are you here‚Äù vibe when she was by herself.

I think it is part of being a cis-man tbh, but idk. Some sort of privilege you can‚Äôt let go of. But for my trans friends who have dated straight guys vs guys familiar with the community, I will say dating straight men 50/50 has put them in positions of danger. Whereas gay men will simply not hit them up. At all.

If you're a MtF woman as the strange fellow makes it seem, then why are you on Grindr, a place that I believe is for homosexual men(or at least men with a preference towards men.) I can understand FtM on Grindr since they identify as males, gut with MtF it feels like a contradiction to one's identity. I apologize once again if I come off as rude or ignorant, but I would really like it know!"
Itachifan33,fduc3to,t1_fdst16w,I'm not sure. I feel like some people on there could be bisexual or they were on grinder before coming to terms with being trans.

chibikyo,fdwnqdr,t1_fdst16w,"Grindr was originally made for men who have sex with men, and it really is mostly used as a hookup app even if it is supposedly a dating app. However in the last year (might be almost 2 years now) the developers realized it was being very heavily utilized by trans people and that there wasn't a good dating or hookup app for trans people so they decided they could make a few changes and accommodate them, so they added the trans tribe, and gender and pronoun fields and I think there may have been a couple other things they did that I'm forgetting about."
Scissorluv70,fduhwuy,t1_fdst16w,"There‚Äôs not really a dating app for trans people, so most default to grindr.

methyltransferase_,fdxat4a,t1_fdst16w,"AFAIK it's mostly about safety and practicality. 

Men on Grindr are far less likely to murder their trans girlfriends/hookups in a homophobic panic. 

Also, since men don't go on Grindr to find cis women, they don't whine about feeling ""tricked"" by a trans woman existing there. So they're less likely to harass trans women or report their profiles until they get autobanned."
Lebender-Geist,fducwii,t1_fduc3to,"I understand being bisexual (which is why I specified males in general who have attraction to other males. That wording may have been bad but it was made to keep things open for other sexualities that could involve two men being together) Your second statement does make sense to me. One would think that someone would leave Grindr after said self discovery, but who am I to predict other's lives. It seems like a perfectly viable option to me.

I hope your next Grindr chat goes better and you land a stud not a creepy dud. Take care."
Murgie,fe18nx9,t1_fdtb15a,">So the only reason this person wants to transition is to fulfill a sexual fantasy?

Well, the only thing we have to judge them on is a fetishtastic spiel on a dating website, so how sound a conclusion we can come to is up for debate. 

But otherwise, yeah. Looking for these sorts of red flags is part of the reason why doctors typically require a psychiatric professional to sign off on a patient's diagnosis of gender dysphoria before they're willing to prescribe hormones. Another big one is when the main thing they're looking for is for others to treat them in the way they perceive men or women to be treated by society in general."
webbgirl88,fe1hg5f,t1_fe18nx9,"I actually already knew about the process an individual has to go through psychologically in regards to transitioning. I'm not under the naive assumption that doctors hand out hormones like candy. To undergo hormone replacement therapy as well as to physically transition one must expect to face an emotional and exhausting process. It can even take a toll on the strongest person since it's such a cathartic journey. 

Because transitioning from one sex to another can be hard on both mind and body, patients considered for treatment are assessed by a mental healthcare professional. Each therapist or psychiatrist specialize in facilitating therapy specific for this operation. If any patient exhibits signs that continuing the transitioning process would not be in their best interest then transitioning is postponed. 

I do, however, appreciate you posting your information for those unfamiliar with the psychological aspects of transitioning. Some people don't know the lengths trans people must go through to become their authentic selves. It is has never been an instantaneous process nor an easy one. It is due to such truths that I responded as incredulously as I did to OP's post."

It's tricky to find a person who will be there for you."

Tetsuro2099,fe2p63p,t3_enjjwb,"Hot tip: ""You don't seem like a whore"" pretty much one of the worst things you can lead with"
Lovurr,fe2qs9x,t1_fe2p63p,"What about ""i liked that pajamas you wore yesterday"""
LatrodectusGeometric,fe37u8q,t1_fe2p63p,This is true. My husband initiated our first date by positively comparing me to a prostitute.
christhasrisin4,fe3akh0,t1_fe2p63p,"How about, ‚Äúyou look like you could be a really successful whore if you wanted to be.‚Äù"
The_FriendliestGiant,fe2stb4,t1_fe2qs9x,"It's college, might well have worn those jammies to lecture."
Libtarderace,fe35r95,t1_fe2qs9x,"Then ""They didn't make you look like a whore."" for the immediate flub."
Tetsuro2099,fe392gq,t1_fe37u8q,Hopefully he topped the night off  by deigning to grant you some of his precious respect like a true gentleman
Tetsuro2099,fe3b2wj,t1_fe3akh0,Now that's class!
OneHandedPaperHanger,fe37v1v,t1_fe2xij2,"This dude absolutely deserved to get grilled. She pointed out exactly what he was wrong about. Even though it‚Äôs not her job to educate him, she did anyway."
cowboysvrobots,fe31p4x,t1_fe2xij2,Being ignored does not give the same lesson as being told what you‚Äôve done wrong
TheCuntCake,fe3imrx,t1_fe2stb4,Happy cake day!
LatrodectusGeometric,fe39wq5,t1_fe392gq,It actually started a long conversation about whether he was trying to make a terrible joke or doing a really bad job of awkwardly flirting that led to us deciding to go on an actual date.
neurotopica,fe3k1er,t1_fe37v1v,"Totally within OPs right to call him out... I agree. 

Just commenting on the effectiveness (I.e impacting this guys behavior toward women moving forward). But if it brought the OP pleasure / enjoyment, more power to her."
The_FriendliestGiant,fe3rygq,t1_fe3imrx,"Oh hey, thanks!"
Cheeriope,fe3i4la,t1_fe39wq5,What did he say initially? Sounds like a cute story in the end.
halfdecent,fe3h0v8,t1_fe320yx,"No one said it was OP's responsibility. You just said that you didn't see the point in putting the guy down, and the guy above guessed that OP was trying to teach him a lesson.

Some people like to help others be less of an asshole I guess? What a thought"
LatrodectusGeometric,fe3oef3,t1_fe3i4la,I had an incident involving a large amount of glitter that contaminated my face and he made a comment assuring me that I would certainly fetch a high price in my new line of work as an escort.
Cheeriope,fe4qbw6,t1_fe3oef3,lmao I love it!!
hylian_john,fe2ti9g,t3_enjjwb,"""Eh I'm just an asshole I guess lol"" well no shit you are. But I think he thinks women find that endearing about him. Also opened with ""You looked good at the gym."" Definitely was staring way to long at you and possibly at other women. But good thing you aren't into hookups cause that's morally wrong. üôÑ

Edit: *Endearing not enduring. Cause I'm a little dumb lol"
anguillias,fe3nay0,t1_fe2ti9g,"yeah he definitely seems like a creep!

(btw, not to be an asshole, but 'enduring' in this context is written 'endearing')"
hylian_john,fe3ni8s,t1_fe3nay0,"Oh thanks, good looking out :)"
Natinatt,fe5i668,t1_fe45vy9,Sarcasm isn‚Äôt for everyone
Pnic193,fe5w742,t1_fe45vy9,They're sarcastically making fun of the guy being a hypocrite. He creeps on girls at the gym but preaches about the moral sins of hookups. At least thats my interpretation
Katakalysmic,fe5ilam,t1_fe5i668,It's hard to understand sarcasm through text
Katakalysmic,fe6jk57,t1_fe5w742,"Yeah I got that now, theres times where I just dont understand sarcasm"
WrXquisite,fe5pxj2,t1_fe5ilam,Pretty sure thats why they added an eye roll emoji.
VeryAwkwardCake,fe2k4qq,t3_enjjwb,'you are not a whore will you sex me'
andromedex,fe2x30n,t1_fe2k4qq,Madonna whore complex. They want a virgin whore.
OnlyBeenBannedOnce,fe2l0gk,t1_fe2k4qq,Yeah that‚Äôs kinda weird. My ex(well the one I had the really bad breakup with) was a bit like that after we broke up except she called me a fuckboy after she asked if we could hookup.
ACasualMayEpic,fe2lxsm,t3_enjjwb,"Double standard because he says he already had his ""hook up days"". 
It's fine to have preferences but to openly say that you respect certain women less because they've done the same thing you've done is wrong. 
By his logic, she shouldn't respect him either for being a whore."
d3f3ct1v3,fe2mxjb,t1_fe2lxsm,"""I mean I still respect you dude, but like not as much as if you were a nice boy who has morals."""
IstgUsernamesSuck,fe3024k,t1_fe2lxsm,"They really don't like when you point that out though. Like, it breaks something in their brain. Every time I've pointed out the hypocrisy the dude went into meltdown mode"
ACasualMayEpic,fe9ay1m,t1_fe3024k,"Because how dare women hold themselves to the same lax standards as men hold themselves to? 
How dare women not save themselves for the ""nice guy""? 
Lol"
BrownishYam,fe2x9bv,t3_enjjwb,On behalf of all of us whores..thank you!!
phunwithphysics201,fe2knv5,t3_enjjwb,‚ÄúI‚Äôm just an ass hole I guess.‚Äù Looks like it.

Loved your reply to him."
brando56894,fe3kmac,t1_fe2otys,I could hear him scrambling to make it sound right hahaha
isonponeple,fe2qo89,t3_enjjwb,‚ÄúYou aren‚Äôt a whore‚Äù is that supposed to make a girl swoon?
orangeskydown,fe3nhqt,t1_fe2qo89,"""Sweet! Finally, I've met a man who will criticize my clothing choices for being 'too slutty' and desperately try to keep other men from hitting on me by controlling how I look!"""
PainInTheAssWife,fe5dgmm,t1_fe3nhqt,"What every woman dreams of, am I right? *cringe*"
ClownsInMyPants,fe34uej,t3_enjjwb,"
Its like those dudes who put ""lol"" after everything so they can backpedal and say they are joking when called out, if he admits hes an asshole first then its acceptable to act that way."
PainInTheAssWife,fe5dlmj,t1_fe34uej,"Also gives him the out of saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just joking, you‚Äôre too sensitive‚Äù"

riannargh,fe6hchf,t1_fe5th05,"You could've said ""not a lot of girls have it"" instead of ""people"" for maximum irony"
smexyghost69,fe6hfr5,t1_fe6hchf,"Eh, doesn't matter. Either way people get the gist of what I was trying to say. And how is it ironic? I don't understand."
riannargh,fe6nzvc,t1_fe6hfr5,"Just because you were putting other people down in your compliment. Obviously it's no where near as bad as the ""not like other girls"" kind of compliments, I just thought it was funny."
smexyghost69,fe812p4,t1_fe6nzvc,"But clearly the dude in the post was complimenting her while putting others down. He was not oblivious to the fact that it wasn't a compliment. He's not a girl so wouldn't my compliment still make sense?? ü§î

I'm not trying to argue, I just genuinely don't know."
GrandpaDallas,feanigg,t1_fe812p4,"The joke is the guy in OP's picture is complimenting a gal by putting others down, and you're complimenting OP for calling him out on that. 

/u/riannargh just pointed out it'd be ironically funny if your comment ended with ""Not a lot of **girls** have it so it's always nice to see when people do"" because you'd be complimenting the OP by putting other women down."
smexyghost69,feao6kk,t1_feanigg,"Ohhh, I just realized what they meant. This whole time I was misreading their comment. üò¨ sorry"
saint_annie,fe2m1r3,t3_enjjwb,OP didn't let up on this moron for even a second. What a gem!
Vaguely-witty,fe4l646,t3_enjjwb,"God I hate that last line. That's a dude who's salty and is playing it off like he's joking around and YOU took it badly. I hate it. Thats a man who clearly is not as good at the game as he thinks he is.

Also in my experience he's gonna try again. Give it a week to a month."
TheHoundsOFLove,fe678sv,t1_fe4l646,Yeah that last line proved he learned nothing.
