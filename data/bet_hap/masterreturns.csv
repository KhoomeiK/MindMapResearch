Two tiger attacks occurred at the San Francisco Zoo, in 2006 and 2007, both involving a female Siberian tiger named Tatiana (June 27, 2003 ‚Äì December 25, 2007). In the first incident, a zookeeper was bitten on the arm during a public feeding. In the second incident, one person was killed and two others were injured before police shot and killed Tatiana.

ImJustPassinBy,fdhwv6o,t3_elh42k,There‚Äôs a special place in hell for those who deliberately steal dogs.
OohYeahOrADragon,fdi4ap3,t1_fdhwv6o,"A friend of mine had a Rottweiler that kept showing up on his back porch. He thought he must've belonged to someone and took him to the vet. He was microchippped to a family. In California. We're on the east coast. 

Turns out this sweetie had been missing from his family for 2 yrs. One of the daughter's ex-boyfriends had wanted revenge for getting dumped. So he took the dog to his house. Well, then the ex-boyfriend's family moved to the east coast and he took the dog too. 

He took care of the pup until the family saved enough to come get him."
Flavz_the_complainer,fdia624,t1_fdhwv6o,"Ok sad story time. I used to know a guy lets call him Andy who had a mate called James who lived on a very sketchy estate in north London.

Whenever I would go round to Andys, James would be there with this gorgeous little pitbull who he rescued from being used as a breeder dog from a puppy farm. 

Apparently the runners of said puppy farm had figured she was all used up and just dumped her on the street. Enter James who found her and nursed her back to the picture of health and she clearly loved him very much for it.

Anyway one day I go round and I see James is there without her, which is unusual. So I ask
‚ÄúHey James, what happened to the dog?‚Äù
He just gave this pained expression and I noticed Andy giving me the *stop talking about that* gesture behind him.

After James had left Andy told me what had happened. James was out walking the dog on his estate and the thugs that ran the puppy farm saw that the old girl was healthy again. 
So that night they broke into his family home, put knives to his mum and dads throats and said ‚ÄúGive us the dog or we cut them‚Äù
Obviously the dog went with the scum.

Never found out what happened to her after that but nothing nice I imagine. Still makes me sad to think about to this day because you could tell she really loved James for rescuing her. 
But in the end it was all for naught."

Has he been ok for you health-wise? I really wanted to get Great Dane when I was looking to get a puppy (ended up getting a bloodhound) but I kept reading that they often encounter health issues early in life. How‚Äôs your guy been? He‚Äôs so cute!"
ninjasrcool,fdqj05m,t1_fdq4lme,"Nothing serious! He turns two in April. 

The most serious things he‚Äôs gone to the vet for have been: neutering, and twice for me knowing he‚Äôs stolen and fully eaten socks. The first time he ate two socks, one pair of underwear and a fabric headband (he stole my gym bag) the second I thought it was a rope from a toy (I watched him on my security camera) turned out to be underwear. The vet will ask if you want it back as a joke üòÇüòÇ"
cr0ss-r0ad,fdrwvsx,t1_fdq4lme,"I've had Great Danes around me all my life. Since the fairly recent death of my last Dane, this is actually the first time in my life I've ever been without one. They're delightful, but you're not entirely incorrect about them having health issues. All three of the Danes we've had over the years were unfortunately felled by health problems, the first developed problems in his liver (i think it was his liver, I was only young when he died), and the second had a twist in her stomach. *However*, they were quite old when it happened. The first was 8/9, which is quit a good age for a Dane. The second was over 10.

My last one became arthritic, and was no longer able to support his own weight, so we put him down because he was suffering all the time, but he had managed to keep kicking about till the ripe old age of 11/12, which is longer than the average life expectancy, so that made it a little easier. He also had heterochromia (one blue and one brown eye) and went almost totally blind in his latter years. He was happy and loving right up until even the very end.

Before that though, the biggest reasons we ever took them to the vet prior to the big sleep was to have them neutered, and the blind one once stubbed his toe in the garden and split his nail so we had to get that fixed."
ImRickyAndImSticky,fds06q1,t1_fdqj05m,How did they handle that? Did he have to get surgery or did they like.. pull it back through his throat. I have no idea how these things work lol
ninjasrcool,fds8e5q,t1_fdrwvsx,"Aww I‚Äôm so sorry to hear that! So glad they lived long healthy lives :)

The toenail part reminds me Freddie once cut the pad on one of his feet running around in snow, most likely on ice or a rock. He was totally fine though. Didn‚Äôt even need stitches!

I‚Äôm hoping he stays around as long as your angels did ‚ù§Ô∏è"
ninjasrcool,fds57gf,t1_fds06q1,"It‚Äôs a great question! 

The first time I‚Äôd only realized after I‚Äôd gotten home so it was a little too late to do endives vomiting since I could only take him he next morning. They still tried it and he threw up one sock, mind you I only thought he‚Äôd eaten the socks. 

They had to take xrays, but he wouldn‚Äôt sit still so they had to knock him out to see where it was in him & if vomiting was safe at that point. Then I monitored him and he threw everything else up.

He‚Äôs pooped whole socks out before when I didn‚Äôt even know he‚Äôd eaten them -__-

The second time I‚Äôd just parked at work and check him on my camera and he‚Äôd JUST eaten what I thought was the rope, called the vet and rushed home and they did vomiting right away and he was fine

He‚Äôs learned his lesson. I forget socks out all the time now and he just ignores them."

ReluctantlyHuman,fdksx45,t1_fdk8j5o,"I actually wonder if this is why he doesn‚Äôt pay more attention to the dog when he comes in. I believe part of that training is almost ignoring the dog when you come home, and only really paying attention once they have settled down."
ZzShy,fdltizo,t1_fdk8j5o,"I would be willing to bet the reason here is that the owner has trained the dog to stay out of the Genkan, which is a small lowered area at the entrance to a house or apartment meant to keep shoes and such.

Jimmy_Fromthepieshop,fdrgwqe,t1_fdr6iig,That's unusual. All puppies I've had/experienced have been extremely social and I'd be a bit bummed out of I got one who didn't want to play or have so much attention. But if your little fella works for you then that's great!

Lezonidas,fdsahku,t3_emtv6i,A Lab that is not fat and doesn't like to cuddle and to be pet? It must be a mix. I've never seen a lab like the one you're describing xD
Scout_Puppy,fdsc0rz,t1_fdsahku,"Nope a full bred American Lab. Lurking on a lab forum it seems to be common for the first year or two. 

Also I definitely see more cuddly behavior as he gets older.
