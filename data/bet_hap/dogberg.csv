sparhawk817,fdiyfug,t1_fdiu0yp,"> The **genitalia** of the **female** closely resembles that of the male; the clitoris is shaped and positioned like a penis, a pseudo-penis, and is capable of erection. The **female** also possesses no external vagina (**vaginal** opening), as the labia are fused to form a pseudo-scrotum.

Slavic-spaghetti,fdiypv8,t1_fdiyfug,Wack
WikiTextBot,fdiygdd,t1_fdiyfug,"**Spotted hyena**

The spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta), also known as the laughing hyena, is a hyena species, currently classed as the sole extant member of the genus Crocuta, native to Sub-Saharan Africa. It is listed as being of least concern by the IUCN on account of its widespread range and large numbers estimated between 27,000 and 47,000 individuals The species is, however, experiencing declines outside of protected areas due to habitat loss and poaching. The species may have originated in Asia, and once ranged throughout Europe for at least one million years until the end of the Late Pleistocene. The spotted hyena is the largest known member of the Hyaenidae, and is further physically distinguished from other species by its vaguely bear-like build, its rounded ears, its less prominent mane, its spotted pelt, its more dual purposed dentition, its fewer nipples and the presence of a pseudo-penis in the female.
