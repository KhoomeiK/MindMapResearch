EDH,fpi2cyd,t1_fpho9lp,1588632300.0,"I mean, every deck has a theme. If you're talking specifically about tribes, then yes I made a rat tribe deck and sort of a faerie tribe deck. Even so, I like to a deck that is still good at what it does. A complaint that I get about my decks is that I ""overcommit to the concept"" but I feel like I'm just putting in cards that make sense.

I'm thinking of making a new deck themed around [[atla palani]] and making/sacing eggs for just random creatures. I think I can enjoy that if I make the mechanics of my deck revolve around eggs and the result just be random creatures. I just hope it isn't hated because it technically cheats out creatures."
EDH,fpi0f4c,t1_fpht16n,1588631219.0,"Thanks for the reply

I've already tried option B an C. They didn't like the group hug decks because they felt like whoever won was because of whatever group hug effects I was doing or that they couldn't play their decks naturally. When I tried using one of their decks I just got super bored because I didn't feel like I was doing anything. 

I have done some of option A, which is obviously the correct solution, but I don't think I've quite got through yet. I'm hoping this thread will help me prepare for next time I try. I'm a little afraid that the truth is that my group just does not enjoy any level of competition"
EDH,fphlnrd,t3_gd9p0f,1588623463.0,"Tldr: My playgroup think I build decks that are too powerful, but in my opinion their decks are just really bad. How do I convince them to build better decks or how do I enjoy building and playing bad decks?

I'll add link my decks at the end in an edit

My playgroup complains that the decks I run are too powerful and way too fast. The things that I do are going ""too far"" and my decks are ""too easy"". But I don't run even one infinite combo on any of my decks, nor do I have any stax-like effect in any of my decks except [[propaganda]] in one of my decks. 

However, my decks are just average in power in my opinion. I think the issue is that they're building pretty bottom-tier power level decks (budget is not an issue though). Every time I reveal my win condition everyone moans like ""why do you have to do this?"". Their decks mostly are constructed like the 2019 commander precons where their deck kind of does things but doesn't have any kind of definite wincon. The only other deck in my playgroup that gets flack is my friends straight precon Ur-Dragon deck that is ""way too powerful""

My decks for the most part are ""My cards have good synergy: if you leave me alone, I win turn 8-10"" but I feel like any half-decent deck should have that. At my local game store I rarely win because my opponents often have good removal, threat assessment, but above all else an actual win condition to follow up with.

Win cons I use and get complaints about:

- [[Simic Ascendancy]]

- unblockable Voltron

- [[Coat of Arms]] + lots of tokens

- Lots of tokens + no opponent has a board whipe

- [[exsanguinate]] + [[ashnod's altar]] + lots of creatures

- [[alela]] + [[bolas's citadel]] = lots of tokens + good boardstate

- [[notorious Throng]]

- [[Nekusar]] + any wheel effect

- [[Xyris]] + any wheel effect

I don't feel that any of these win cons are unfair or unmanageable. I've already started making less and less powerful decks but at this point I feel like to continue playing with this play group I'm going to have to make decks that just don't have a win con or take 15 turns to even start going (making the game very long)

I guess I have 2 questions:

How can I convince my playgroup that my decks are not nearly as powerful as they seem to think and should make better decks instead of complaining about mine?

Or

How can I build a low-tier deck and still have fun? I don't like decks that don't have any synergy or plan

Bonus question

Are my decks more powerful than I think?

Decks:

Most played: Tokens + anthems: https://deckstats.net/decks/149427/1542785-faerie/en

Played twice: Nekusar: https://deckstats.net/decks/149427/1577557-wheel-and-deal/en
Everyone refused to ever play against this deck ever again when I revealed [[forced fruition]], even if I said I'd take it out

Second most played: Counters matter (accidentally Voltron): https://deckstats.net/decks/149427/1542790-twin-commanders/en

Played only once: Snake-spam Draw: https://deckstats.net/decks/149427/1624072-snekusar/en

Played once: Too many fucking rats: https://deckstats.net/decks/149427/1593205-rats/en

Played a few times: My weakest deck, but somehow ""orzhov is too easy"": https://deckstats.net/decks/149427/1626651-thine-queen-is-here/en

At least one person in my group refuses to play against any one of my decks, hence ""played once"" or ""played twice"""

saltierthancrait,foxd7s3,t1_fovm898,1588140491.0,"This reminds me of how Disney originally learned how to create enjoyable dark rides. At first, none of the rides featured the main character. This was because you were supposed to play the part of the main character, but no one got that and guests would complain constantly about not seeing the main character in their own ride. So, Disney learned their lesson and began including main characters in their dark rides. 

This sounds like they're making the same mistake all over again, but this time for an entire section of the park(s)."

Win cons: 

- Spam powerful fliers (sometimes shrouded or indestructible)

- [[Notorious Throng]] into an extra turn and kill everyone

Also, what cards do you think I can toss from this deck? I think I need some counterspells in this deck but I just find all the cards in it too fun to part with at the moment."
