visualnovels,fpihuq4,t1_fpigzld,1588641219.0,"I'm not a stickler for dumb controversies. Like, ""OH! IN THE JAPANESE VERSION THEY USED THE WORDS BIKINI, BUT IN THE ENGLISH RELEASE THEY TONED IT DOWN TO SWIMSUIT."" That seems really excessive over nothing. I just want nothing cut out of the original game. Even the schmexy scenes. And in regards to playing the japanese vers., I can read japanese, but I think my enjoyment would be maxed out in English, because I can then think less about what I have to read. 

Also thanks for the recommendations! I watched the aokana anime so I know it's a decent pick and I'll check out Maitetsu -Pure Station-!"
