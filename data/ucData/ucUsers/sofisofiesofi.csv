Personally, I would agree that they aren't the greatest tool for measuring faculty expertise but they are, at least for the department I worked for, taken very serious. I never got see any consequences for poor performing faculty.  Nonetheless I think they are important in qualifying great professors for tenure."
CalPolyPomona,fp3z4tr,t1_fp3m9oa,1588288543.0,They will determine financial hardship based off 2019-2020 FAFSA. So no forms other than FAFSA.
UCSantaBarbara,fozz81g,t3_gad7tb,1588199519.0,"I understand what you mean, I sort of questioned the same since *everyone* seems to be so outgoing. In truth, the campus community is so diverse and chill.

 I'm going there next year for grad school but would often visit as an undergrad; I would always have the best of times visiting the campus, the beach, friends, everywhere there! Mind you I am shy and didn't think I'd fit in. My undergrad uni was soo conservative but UCSB is such a welcoming, inclusive and non-judgy community. 10/10 recommend you consider it."

Im so sorry that happened to you, I hope you feel better soon."
tax,fnrgu67,t3_g3glec,1587188537.0,"I am also 22, uni student, claimed as dependent, and not receiving stimulus. I agree it sucks but as another poster noted - the $$ isn't supposed to support us. It is intended to *stimulate* the economy. Tbh the IRS doesn't care about our individual situations.

Does your institution offer any support resources? You might have better luck utilizing their resources, if any."
GradSchool,fnb6744,t3_g0ourd,1586809914.0,"I’m in a similar boat. Accepted into masters program (education) but not offered any funding. My advisor made it a point that MA don’t often get funded as uni grad funding is focused on PhD programs. PhD also get considered for TAships over MA students. I am still unsure how I’m going to afford it but it is the program I desire to attend.

If this is the institution you truly want to attend and finance isn’t a huge issue then I’d suggest to consider attending."
