muacjdiscussion,fpm6k1c,t3_ge8sxa,1588726590.0,"I've got light skin, and a neutral undertone (it can lean more cool or warm, but that typically is related to time of year - winter is cooler bc no sun, summer is warmer bc sun).

I definitely go for a couple colour types. Most typically, oranges, peaches, corals, then almost bronzer shades. I've got reddish/orange hair, so these also look nice with my hair imo.

* Burt's Bees Bare Peach
* Milani Coral Cove
* Hourglass powder blushes in general
* Besame cream in Apricot
* Em Cosmetics serum blush in Sunset (I think that's the name....orange one)
* BECCA Endless Bronze and Glow (I swirl it together for a blush - was LE and idk if it's available anymore)
* Glossier Cloud Paint in Beam and Dusk

Burt's Bees Bare Peach is up there for most flattering, as are most of the creams (although I would say the Glossier Cloud Paints are far and away the most pigmented, so have had to tone down some disasters).

I think maybe the BECCA Endless Bronze and Glow is my more ""unexpected one that worked"" - it's a combo of two highlighters (I think....one is very pink, but more of a highlighter than a blush imo), then a bronzer. Mixed in the pan, it ends up being a really lovely glowy blush. I live in it during summer, is one of the few products I bought a backup of because it is just really lovely.

I think most any blush can ""work"", but for me it has to be a cohesive full face look. When a blush hasn't worked because of the shade, it's usually been it didn't work with the look. As for which ones ""work"" more, it tends to just be my preferences of more orange/peach or nude, as they end up being pretty effortless with my complexion and hair colour.

""Worst"" are probably purples. I like the idea, and I used to love them when I had violet-black hair, but it can go real Halloween with my current orange-ish hair. That, or look bruise-y. Can still do a cohesive look, I just rarely want to, I guess. I also just do not like purple lips, which I feel like I match my blush to my lips a lot, and do not like purple on myself for the lips. Love it for eyes, tho.

3 blushes I'd keep forever:

* Burt's Bees Bare Peach
* Em Cosmetics Sunset
* BECCA Endless Bronze and Glow

Afraid of: uhhhhh maybe legit green/blue lol. I just don't think it'd work with how I like to do makeup, but have seen really amazing IG makeup that mess with more ""unusual"" blush colours.

Wishlist blushes:

* Fenty creams (I actually ordered the orange already, but it's not shipped yet - if I like it, would consider Strawberry Drip)
* Westman Atelier creams
* Charlotte Tilbury Pillowtalk blush"

I feel like it is in part a trend wave, where now it is almost pass√© to some, despite like....every trend is a different technique. Some work amazingly and become staple routine aspects, while others move on."
muacjdiscussion,fplxgyt,t3_ge7tag,1588721357.0,"I think Hourglass has had (or maybe currently does have) the ALP's in a palette option where you can pick which ones are in your palette. What I'd love is if that extended to blushes and bronzers by them, so you could potentially make your ideal trio.

Cream pan shadows that fit the typical 26mm circle pans so you can do your own palettes with the general standard of circle pans. I know some brands have cream palettes (Revlon has had one for decades), but fort he most part, it's cream singles in pots right now. Individual circle pans to do your own range/mix with powders, would be great.

More serum blushes. I like Em Cosmetics, but the shade range is a bit boring. I also would like to see more options/brands getting in on it. Also, maybe a serum bronzer of a similar formula.

Hourglass cream blushes and bronzers to go along with the stick highlighters. I have the Sheer Illume trio and love it, however the highlighter is the weak link for me. But, this does tell me they can make beautiful cream blush and bronzer. And they have the stick highlighters, which are lovely. So, would be amazing if they ended up going for blush and bronzer options in similar packaging (could differentiate the packaging as well by colour between the three products, as I dislike when brands make packaging too similar unless they do really distinct stickers like Fenty that help colour code stuff). I would also love for the Illume trio to come back and with more shades, but if they opt to go individual cream sticks and have a better shade, that also works for me. I think the highlighters are 5-6 in total, so a range of at least 5-6 bronzers I think would also be a pretty solid range for skintones."

muacjdiscussion,fpjl76r,t1_fpf4hil,1588672686.0,"I have dry skin and use retinols regularly without flaking, but avoid hyaluronic acid because I find it can dry me out. This seems counter-intuitive, but climate plays a big part for me. I'm in a rather arid place, and it actually pulls moisture out of my skin, ultimately making my skin flake horribly. I tried many hyaluronic serums, and thought I was going crazy until I learned that that could even happen. I can use hyaluronic if it is lower in the ingredients list of other products without issue, however a full on serum (especially with retinol causing my skin to be extra dry) resulted in some of the flakiest skin of my life.

I've also found mild physical exfoliation can really help chemical exfoliation/retinols, as sometimes the dead skin sticks around and needs a little clearing up. Nothing overly harsh or drying, but enough to clear it up a bit then going in with hydrating products."
muacjdiscussion,fpjkq6g,t1_fpd4nsy,1588672177.0,"I currently have the Glow Recipe one! I like for a light moisturizer. I don't think of it as very oily/greasy, personally. I would consider repurchasing, however it's in the vein of a light layering moisturizer to me or one I can wear during the day. This one I do notice soaks into my skin, so it doesn't work overnight for me unless it is layered with other hydrating products.

For a more hydrating one, Fresh's Lotus Night Cream (blue packaging - the name is like an endless sentence). It is lightly citrus scented (I notice it when I smell it, but it goes away very quickly once applied). It has been my most repurchased moisturizer, and at peak dryness times, I'll use it day and night. It works well under makeup when applied thinly, and is really nice overnight. It sometimes comes up as a mini/GWP, which is how I first tried it and bought it after panning.

My skin is dry, sensitive to silicones but not fragrance."

muacjdiscussion,fpjjot0,t1_fpey7rr,1588671050.0,"Em Cosmetics serum blushes are the most hydrating and dewy looking I've tried. They're also more sheer, and I wouldn't say they are the most buildable (purely because building up = SUPER shiny bc serum nature). They have good payoff despite that, but would look into images and videos in use, especially if a deeper skintone, just so you can get a better idea of what it will do. I've got Sunset (think that's the whole name - orange one) and it doesn't have any shimmer, but is a really nice glossy/hydrating blush.

Juice Beauty cream blushes are also nice and hydrating.

Rituel de Fille has a nice cream blush formula, a bit drier than Juice Beauty, but also more pigment. I have Delirium/red orange looking one. The metallic to it is subtle, and the sheen I get from it is more the cream formula than that metallic imo.

Glossier cloud paints I really like, but I wouldn't call them glossy/dewy. They aren't hydrating, but I wouldn't say they dry my skin out. Would call it more  matte finish (granted, I haven't tried the more metallic ones). Very pigmented though! If you're willing to, can totally mix like a serum or moisturizer with a tiny amount, and it'll act more like a dewy cream blush.

I just ordered a Fenty one (orange..........I really love orange lol), but have no opinion on it personally. From what I've seen, they are looking to be dewy/hydrating, sorta like the Juice Beauty from swtches, but depends on the shade you choose on the pigmentation vs sheerness, also metallic or not."
muacjdiscussion,fpjj57b,t1_fpepfp9,1588670464.0,"Preference - I've had amazing and garbage brushes that were synthetic and natural receptively. With both, not all are equal. There are different grades and qualities of natural bristles, just as different brands synthetic bristles can range greatly. Function can also dictate what you want. Also brush care (or lack thereof) can deteriorate brushes of either variety over time.

Wayne Goss has synthetic brushes that are on par with some of my most expensive and preferred natural bristle brushes and are now the bar for synthetic bristles that mimic natural bristles (both in feel and the ""flop"" of longer ones). Also really like Hourglass' synthetics."

Ulta I also got some replacements, after just giving up waiting for a 20% off.

I'm transferring in Fall, so this is just...spectacular timing. I'm also in a major that is largely lab time, so being fully online is not feasible for a decent education for it. I have to look into what other courses I could potentially take that would still work toward graduation requirements if not major requirements for upper division. 

Upside is I was already planning on double majoring, and my second major wouldn't be the worst online. It's just not what I planned for. I also think it may potentially set me back at least one semester from graduating in 2 years after transferring, purely because of how often certain major-specific courses are offered, and I'm not sure what that means for financial aid."

If this was some multiple choice thing where there was a ""none of the above"" option, then I suppose it's less nefarious, but if it's unsolvable and the only ""solved"" option is a trap, not sure what this professor expects."

I've also seen a lot of waning in discussion boards (first couple weeks very active/almost everyone posted, now it's very slow and 1/3rd of class is responding).

I did have the advantage of already taking multiple online classes in tandem with in-person (12 online units, 13 in person units), so while I haven't loved the transition, it wasn't a totally foreign concept vs most people I know fully did not sign up for online classes and are hating them."

I don't know deadlines for Common App, but UC deadline is November 30th for the following Fall semester (so this November for Fall 2021).

If your degree takes 4 years, it's $160k.

I'm expecting one B, the rest are A's, and then am in a 1 unit P/NP course I'm passing.

Worth noting: I'm an art major. These courses are 5 art history courses (4 were already online, 1 in-person), then 4 art courses, and a 1 unit exercise course. Because they are so closely related, it works for me. I also work on campus (TA for two classes, then am the lab tech), so I essentially was on campus 8AM-8:30PM M-F until we got moved online. My social life was purely what I could have at school, otherwise I went home and was doing HW.

If I was taking a much broader breadth of courses, I do not think I would be doing so well. I've done 18 unit semesters a decent amount, and some of those I mixed it up, and managed all A's, but I think 18 is my max for a more ranging course load (and it also really depends on the courses).

The reason why I went for so many courses is I'm transferring in Fall, and I realised I mucked up something (was looking at the wrong requirements - regular AA rather than AA-T), so suddenly had to pack on the Art History. I didn't want to compromise the Art courses I was in because I was really excited to take them, so figured I'd try it out and drop by the first drop date if needed. Then I just stuck it out and was managing fine. 

Even with covid-19, I'm pretty on top of all my work, because you have to be with so many courses. I'm going to either UC Berkeley or UC Davis in fall, so to me is was worth it.

Would also look into extracurricular options, as there is a section in the application where you can add in not necessarily academic things you are doing.

Then also got into UCB which I thought was such a long shot/applied because I had the option to apply for free, and now I have to really look at both options. I got a pretty solid aid package from UCB which would make it really feasible (something that I thought would also be unlikely). I have to check on the other UC (I did something stupid with my password for their portal, so have to call during the week to reset it and see what their aid offer is). It's a lot to consider!"
berkeley,fntmchm,t3_g3iriw,1587244544.0,"It sounds like you may have gone for a really competitive major and other schools recognized that! I was rejected from a bunch of schools when I was applying to be a freshman, so can relate the sting. I feel like I'm also in a relatively less competitive major, which allowed some leeway for some not amazing starts at the first Uni I went to then the proceeding ""figuring myself out"" time at CC. You have a lot to be proud of despite this!"
berkeley,fntlo5b,t1_fnrq6bm,1587244153.0,"I definitely thought I was waitlisted or rejected because of that email! I'd already heard back positively from two other UC's (and found out from Congratulations emails), so assumed decision would be from a similar email, so really was like, ""Okay, this is fine, Berkeley was my long shot I threw in for kicks anyways"" then was pleasantly surprised!"
