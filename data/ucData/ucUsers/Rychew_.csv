WhitePeopleTwitter,fpmwy13,t1_fpmogbt,1588743905.0,"The original comment was saying that Kim K and Paris Hilton were counterexamples to the point the post made, which is to say that their careers did not get destroyed by the leaked nudes.

The second comment added on, saying that the people involved in the Fappening also served as counterexamples since they too did not have their careers destroyed by their leaked nudes.

And finally you come in, saying that the Fappening people are diff from Kim K since their fame came about in different ways. What the next person's point (that you rudely disregarded) is that your comment is irrelevant to the discussion. It does not matter that the J Lawrence was already famous, the whole discussion was about whether or not their career was destroyed by the leaked nudes. Maybe youre the one who should comment somewhere else. Your ""point"" is irrelevant to the discussion. It does not separate the Fappening from Kim K *in regards to the post*."

Really seems like it's a big deal for you

Sure, doing a rolling stop incorrectly can maybe ruin someone's life, but you can say the same thing for everything. Making a right turn on a red incorrectly can cost someone's life. The way I see it is that if you have experience doing rolling stops, you are no safer than I'd you were driving on a street like any other day. Again, people can still make mistakes when doing rolling stops, but you can also make mistakes when doing other things, so that isn't a valid line of reasoning"
