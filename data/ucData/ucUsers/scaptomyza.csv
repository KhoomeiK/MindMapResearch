TheLastKingdom,fpl4hnr,t1_fpk2nkt,1588706211.0,"Yeah, I’m excited, but I wasn’t a fan of Odyssey. I felt it had too much bloat for my liking. Haven’t tried Origins though!"

berkeley,fox2cti,t1_fowoodt,1588132424.0,"Does the sunk cost fallacy apply here? As much as I’d like to not feel like my money is wasted, I would be happier safe than sorry. Important to note that I do live in the Bay Area, so compared to most, it’s easier for me to change my mind at any time.

Also, if I lived elsewhere, I wouldn’t want to fly/drive to the apartment only to discover that I want to go back because the surge of people back on campus has lead to another local wave of infections. It may be better to wait and let time tell before making any final decisions."
