AerospaceEngineering,fp71ams,t3_gbnssd,1588362235.0,"I get how you feel I am a first-year as well. I have not bothered with applying to internships since I knew I would immediately be declined. Instead, I've tried to apply to research programs on my campus, which I have also been declined since they are targeted more towards second and third years. One of my declined applications explicitly said that and it frankly hurt quite a bit. I feel pretty hopeless as well and the pandemic isn't really helping.

&#x200B;

In terms of advice, I've just been told to bolster my experience by either joining a project team or starting my own project through an organization. Other than try to stay positive! Look out for opportunities, and as a second-year, there will surely be more chances to land an internship. Another thing is that if you can you might want to find someone on campus that can give you guidance and recommend you to other people or programs. I am lucky to know someone over the past year that has given me a lot of support and advice. I am sure there is some kind of resource on campus that can aid you. You just need to reach out."

UCSD,fno3bsd,t3_g2x6vb,1587110524.0,"First of all, what you are proposing is highly unlikely. Although it initially does not seem like many professors creating asynchronous or synchronous lectures, posting material, and being accomodating to students of different timezones and those at the mercy of the technology itself is a very large workload for them.  To have them do all that in addition to in-class lectures would be far too much additional work.

The UC system will either go all or nothing, not in between with the additional resources as they would then have to pay for all the normal staff back and utilities, but also pay for all the zoom licenses.

I would love to go back to campus and take classes like normal, but this is not an appropriate solution for the school, and public health since it is simply better to quarantine rather than risk the exposure. After all the virus can live on surfaces for a while and it's not like those desks would be cleaned frequently."
UCSD,fno2r2h,t1_fnn11x8,1587109935.0,"Well, Sixth College has been treated as a lesser college since its the youngest one and does not have an official name. In addition to it having a ""bad"" location and dorms in relation to the rest of the campus. We tend to be called very homey and campy since Sixth looked like a campsite hence ""Camp Snoopy"". The apartments did not share this same vibe, but they are very isolated. As someone who lived in the apartments walking anywhere on the west side would take 20 minutes. We also didn't have the best market or dining hall.

Things will be different this year with the introduction of Seventh College (lol) and the new dorms/facilities that look AMAZING. That is if we actually get to see it if classes are no longer remote.

For the more in-depth stuff, I felt that Sixth use to suffer in social events since the apartments and dorms were split due to construction and again with it being separated from a lot of the west side of campus (lots of events were held in Revelle if I recall). It should be easier to socialize and stuff again with the new location.

I'd say you shouldn't worry about Sixth College. Everyone's pretty chill and nice like every other college. I am sure you will enjoy it. Just attend events regardless of which college holding it and just do your best to get involved with others.

From a fellow sixer."
