I think it'sÂ **ridiculous**Â to even have to open my mouth to explain to anyone in attendance why a black resource center is necessary! I think information on why black students need additional support is publicly available to you, if you'd bother to inform yourself on struggles faced by black students or our retention rates or if you had anyÂ **logical**Â grasp on the history of racism in this country and how UCLA is an institution that does not doÂ **nearly**Â enough to combat that burden.

And I'mÂ **really**Â tired of your misleading portrayals of this referendum and the way in which USAC money is spent when your energy could be better spent actually informing people of the answers to those questions, if that was something you actually cared about! I would also like to reiterate Isabel's ask of what community you represent because I haven't heard an answer to that, and I haveÂ **never**Â heard you use the word ""community"" prior to you organizing against this referendum, so I really do think it's ironic, honestly, for you to have learned the term ""community"" from us, only to attempt to use iy against us, because I highly question your understanding of the concept of community, and I consider you aÂ **false representation**Â of the stem community because I am a black stem major!! And black students are severely underrepresented within the stem community, and they will continue to be because people like yourself explicitly refuse to support their need for resources! I think you areÂ **really**Â a disappointment right now; I think it isÂ **shameful**Â that you have the audacity to run for president on a platform of ""N student fees"" or striking down a black resource center against a black woman!! And, inÂ **no way**Â do you challenge students' consent by advocating for the people you're pretending to represent!

And I wish you and your misinformation, honestly, wouldÂ **exit the chat**, because I honestly find itÂ **insulting**Â that I have to engage with you on this!! I can't believe you came to a meeting where people explicitly called us n\*\*\*\*rs in this chat to open your mouth to say that you aren't willing to publicly support the necessity of a resource center to increase the overall support of black students on this campus!!

So, I think if you are going to continue to abstain, make it clear that it's your own choice not to vocally back these communities, but no administrator instructed you to do so! And, I think you have the choice to express your standing outside of the vote and youÂ **failed**Â to do so! And, you are still my general representative 2, somehow, and I an calling on you to explain and take accountability for yourÂ **pitiful**Â stance and explicitly renounce anti-blackness because students should be able to know who they're voting for!!

I'm otherwise tired, so that's me, but, I expect an answer."
