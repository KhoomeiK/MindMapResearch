UCSD,fo5qj0f,t3_g5s7lu,1587532613.0,we didnt sign our lease until late august last year and summer session is online so dw. It wasn't hard for us to find housing at that time because we went through an apartment building it might be slightly cheeper to take over someones lease but if its ending before summer your gonna waste more money than you would have saved on the lease .
UCSD,fo5p3xq,t1_fnxo457,1587531439.0,"thanks friend yeah I see a therapist which has been helping im doing better  now that im adjusting more, I fixed my sleep schedule by using some melatonin which helped a lot. I knew going in that online would suck ass for me i made it a priority during school usually to never miss a lecture cos i knew watching podcasts did not work for me, but tbh if i have to pnp like most of my classes this quarter its chill that option really made me feel better. Im deff gonna make sure i go to all office hours !"
