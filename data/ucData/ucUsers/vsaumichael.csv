Everyone should know that people holding office positions are going to be slandered by the people, regardless of how good or bad they are, so why complain?"
ucla,fpffwuh,t1_fpffpu2,1588570063.0,I don’t think they were aware that this was a copypasta
ucla,fpffcoe,t1_fpff54l,1588569598.0,Im trolling some other rant post

ucla,fni99zz,t1_fni8i9c,1586976145.0,"Robert Watson and his mob were making fun of Orion Smedley, the only member of USAC who is against raising student fees, on the basis that he is a stem major. That’s their argument to “bully” him into giving up his fight."
ucla,fni6fnl,t1_fni686k,1586974775.0,"It’s because if one says that white people aren’t being oppressed, so they don’t need a student center for them. It’s wrong to say that it’s impossible to be racist towards them."
ucla,fni5qxo,t1_fni3l2n,1586974444.0,"You’re the ones playing the race card by saying that everything that is not in favor of African Americans is anti-black. It doesn’t work that way. Stop having a “victim mindset” and look into the matter. USAC did something wrong, they shouldn’t be demanding more fees from students."
ucla,fni5cnh,t1_fni53pb,1586974250.0,Imagine the outrage people will have if the reverse happened. Say a white student center in an African American majority school. And saying that white people can’t be victims of racism is wrong.
ucla,fni51l5,t1_fni4at8,1586974102.0,Don’t all lives matter though? I don’t get the whole undermining the black life thing. It’s equal. ALL lives do matter after all..
ucla,fni3mcs,t1_fni2put,1586973405.0,"Its the black students’ choice that they chose to come here. If they are all in the name of equality, why not have a normal student center that is aimed towards everyone, and not one specific race? That, Robert Watson, is racist. Not “not wanting to pay the fees to help black people.”"
ucla,fngfqzl,t3_g1m2oo,1586930836.0,"DO NOT vote for anyone that is tied to the “For The People” organization. That is the organization that currently “runs” the USAC, led by current president Robert Watson"
ucla,fnge9h7,t1_fngdobg,1586929573.0,"I mean him alone can’t pass referendums by himself as a single representative. Robert Watson and his “For The People” mob shut down anything that doesn’t profit the USAC members’ wallets, so you can’t really blame him. We have to drain the swamp."
ucla,fngdtfb,t3_g1i25k,1586929206.0,"The external vice president is Johana Guerra Martinez. All part of the “For The People” organization that current USAC president Robert Watson is under.

This upcoming election, DO NOT vote for any “For The People” members. They’re all trying to raise our fees during these hard times, and their best argument will be that they will claim that you are a racist. Don’t give in to the pressure. Make sure you guys vote for the right people."

ucla,fnc5a71,t1_fnarzhh,1586828915.0,Look up Li Wenliang. The chinese authorities silenced his warnings to the public as he died from “coronavirus” causes.
ucla,fnae60x,t1_fn8ebbh,1586795926.0,"Murdered the Chinese independent doctor “whistleblower,” denied the US request to send scientists to investigate the virus, threatened to deny the export of pharmaceuticals, reported to the WHO that the virus does not transmit from human-to-human, the list goes on and on, but yea you can just blame the US for everything."
ucla,fn8ayek,t1_fn7z0tt,1586737644.0,"China lied, people died. They could’ve done such a better job at containing but decided to hide it."
ucla,fn7wjpc,t3_g00nvx,1586729067.0,Thanks China!
