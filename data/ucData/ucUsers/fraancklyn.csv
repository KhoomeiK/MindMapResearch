StarWars,fpfz11p,t3_gd887n,1588588813.0,"As someone who just saw this in Popular and who has not once watched anything Star Wars related, this is one of the two main reasons why (next to it just not being my general thing/genre). I've encountered several fans, including friends of mine, who as soon as the topic pops up become absolutely unbearable. There are people among you guys who show simply disgusting behaviour towards others, for not watching Star Wars, for liking parts they don't, for liking actors they don't and it's the worst.

Glad to see large parts of your community are better than that and that you distance yourselves from those toxic twats by making memes like this. Wakanda forever (or something)"

See? Just did your thing. Just because you (claim that you) say a thing without malice doesn't mean your wording can't be shitty enough for someone to see it that way and therefore just as it's your right to say what you said it's peoples right to criticize you for it. Which I did.

Also the point still stands regardless of whether she can still see this. A German saying that rougly translates to _The way you yell into a forest determines how the echo will sound._ Considering that you go around disrespecting someone but being offended that someone else doesn't respect you in return, that proverb might be one you want to live by from now on if not hearing mean stuff is your goal."
